About the Authors
Sean Walberg has been a network engineer for nine years. He’s been in the 
information technology field since 1994 and has worked on development, 
technical support, systems administration, and network engineering.
When not working, you can find Sean playing with his three energetic sons or 
in the kitchen cooking.
You can find Sean’s contact information and links to other writing at 
http://seanwalberg.com.
Derek Torres is an author and technical communicator. He has extensive 
experience working for software companies in the United States and in 
Europe. He has authored or coauthored several books on Windows operating 
systems and, most recently, BusinessObjects XI Release 2 For Dummies. He is 
currently based in Paris, France.
Joel Durham is passionate for all things technological. Whether it’s a multimil­
lion transistor integrated circuit or a really cool mouse, Joel has a deep desire 
to check it out. This personality trait at various times delights, amuses, and 
sometimes even infuriates Joel’s wife and two children, with whom he lives in 
upstate New York. Joel worked on this particular book for the simple reason 
that wires infuriate him. The battle to clear out and ultimately eliminate the 
nests of thin, black, metal-wrapped-in-rubber snakes behind the desks and 
tables in Joel’s house has become a top priority. The mice that drive the cur­
sors of Joel’s computers are wireless, as are the keyboards. Joel’s PDA and 
MP3 players sync sans cables. If he could, Joel would also get rid of video, 
audio, and even power wires—but that last one appears to be a long way from 
becoming reality.
Loyd Case  is a technology writer and analyst covering PC platform, graphics, 
digital media and gaming technologies. He’s written extensively for a wide 
array of publications, including Maximum PC, PC Magazine, PC World and 
others. He began writing for Computer Gaming World back in the 1990s, when 
no one wrote about technology for gamers. When not working, you can find 
him playing board games, PC games or behind the viewfinder of his digital 
SLR. Loyd is married, with two daughters.

Introduction
I
 still remember when I got my first cordless phone. Suddenly, I didn’t 
have to run to the kitchen when the phone rang, I just carried the phone 
with me. I could make a phone call from wherever I was. Wireless meant 
freedom, and this is just a phone that I’m talking about!
Wireless technology can make your life easier, and it’s not just limited to 
saving you from getting up to answer the phone. You can free up space on 
your desk with a wireless keyboard and mouse, and you can even move 
your laptop around the house and stay on the Internet with a wireless net­
work. You can be productive wherever you want to now.
Cellular technology is another area of wireless growth. A phone that once 
had to be carried over your shoulder now fits on your belt and offers a 
video camera, location tracking, and Internet access. With Bluetooth, you 
can have a wireless headset, which eliminates a lot of embarrassing fum­
bling when a call comes in.
Most types of devices have embraced wireless functionality in some form 
or another, and given how convenient it is to get rid of wires, you should be 
looking to do so whenever possible.
This book covers the whole spectrum of personal wireless technology, 
from your computer to your cell phone, and even your home entertainment 
system. There’s not much we can do about those pesky power cords, but 
that’s what batteries are for! Read on and find out all the ways your life can 
get easier by using wireless.
About This Book
Wireless All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies is all about wireless tech­
nologies. It covers just about everything, from networking to digital TV 
broadcasting to cell phones.
If that sounds like a hodgepodge for one book, think again. The book is sepa­
rated into topic specific minibooks, each written by an author who is an 
expert in the field.
With this book in hand, you can do all kinds of cool things:
	
✦	 Choose the right wireless networking hardware
	
✦	 Install and configure a wireless network in your home or small office
	
✦	 Troubleshoot your networking hardware

2
System Requirements
	
✦	 Configure printers so you can use them across your network
	
✦	 Plug security leaks and keep them plugged
	
✦	 Connect your laptop computer to wireless networks while on the road, 
as well as keep it constantly supplied with power
	
✦	 Connect and synchronize smartphones and handheld devices with wire­
less networks
	
✦	 Purchase, configure, and use a BlackBerry e-mail device
	
✦	 Choose and use cellular telephones
	
✦	 Use media servers to play your music and view photos on your home 
entertainment center
	
✦	 Set up your own weather station
	
✦	 Use GPS technology for things like finding your way home and locating 
cemeteries for genealogy research
The first time a technical phrase is used in the book, it is italicized, so look 
out for that.
System Requirements
For the sections about wireless networking, we assume you are running 
Windows XP or Windows Vista (or perhaps you’re an early adopter to 
Windows 7) on your computer. Earlier versions of Windows don’t let you 
connect to a wireless network with the ease of later editions of Windows, so 
we recommend upgrading to one of these three Windows versions before 
setting up your network.
We don’t cover Mac OS X or Linux in this book. It’s not because they aren’t 
wonderful operating systems conducive to wireless networking. Instead, 
whole books are devoted to both operating systems and wireless network­
ing, so I focus on what most people are running these days. Whatever your 
view on monopolies, Microsoft still dominates the market.
Not everything in this book is about Windows-based computers. You find 
chapters on new third-generation smartphones and other handheld devices — 
and even an entire minibook on GPS. Obviously, you need some of that equip­
ment to get the most from those chapters.
What You Don’t Have to Read
Actually, you don’t have to read anything if you don’t want to. It’s a free 
country. But I bet you didn’t pay to not read this book. Assume you want to 
read everything that’s precisely on topic and not a sentence more.

3
Book II: Planning Your Network
That’s okay. You can skip two types of information without losing the big 
picture:
	
✦	 Information marked by a Technical Stuff icon, which I discuss a little 
later in this introduction. This information appeals to your inner geek, 
but it’s not absolutely necessary reading.
	
✦	 Sidebars. These bits and bytes are off the beaten path. They’re interest­
ing (I hope!), but not essential.
Still, these two groups of information make up a small portion of the book. 
Reading them won’t consume that much time. Plus, you will make me happy 
for having read them. (This book contains a hidden wireless transmitter that 
reports back to me what you have and have not read, so don’t think I don’t 
know.) 
How This Book Is Organized
Wireless All-In-One Desk Reference For Dummies contains eight minibooks, 
each of which focuses on a general wireless topic. We wrote in a way that 
lets you easily find the topic you want to read about, skipping the others for 
the time being. For example, one minibook focuses on wireless networking, 
while another contains information about cell phones and other wireless 
technologies. When feasible, we’ve kept an entire minibook about one topic, 
such as networking or GPS. This is what the eight minibooks contain.
Book I: Pulling the Plugs
I tell you about all the ways to cut your cords and live in a wireless world. 
Wireless technology has an advantage to its wired counterpart in that you 
can move anywhere and stay in touch. There’s the rub: You’re always in 
touch. Do you really want that? I also talk about some wireless Internet 
access technologies and how to choose one.
Book II: Planning Your Network
The nitty-gritty starts here, with talk of hardware such as routers and adapt­
ers. If and when you’re ready to network wirelessly in your jammies, from 
the safety of your own den, you should take a crack at these chapters. Or at 
least take a peek. Already there and wrestling with some of your products? 
Hardware troubleshooting advice to the rescue. 

4
Book III: Configuring Networks
Book III: Configuring Networks
First, I start off with the basics — you’ve got to crawl before you can walk, so 
what better place to start than by explaining Windows’ wireless networking 
capabilities. That would, of course, include a look at an old Windows favorite 
called plug and play technology. From there, we’ll learn how to use some 
of the more advanced networking features, especially Windows Vista’s new 
Network and Sharing Center. We’ll also lean how to manage your wireless 
networks both at home and on the road. Did we forget to mention that we’ll 
cover other important features, such as creating a bridge between wired and 
wireless networks, as well as how to share a printer? Finally, we’ll help you 
make sure that your network is busy doing its thing. 
Book IV: Security and Troubleshooting
This brief but power-packed minibook makes you aware of the dark side of 
wireless computing and lets you know what you can do to best protect your­
self. You can begin by getting a grip on the accounts that are available on 
your home network, and those instructions are here. These troubleshooting 
ideas are another way I help you keep your system running smoothly.
Book V: On the Road Again — But Without Wires
This book covers a wide variety of wireless technologies. It starts innocuously 
enough with your laptop, but moves on to handheld devices. It also covers 
how to strike the right balance when using your laptop on the road, so that 
you can take advantage of wireless technology while still thinking about bat­
tery life. You’ll also learn how to synchronize your wireless devices — both 
laptops and handheld devices, such as mobile phones and PDAs. Speaking 
of wireless handheld devices, we’ll also take a look at smartphones running 
Windows Mobile and check in on our old friend, the BlackBerry, and see how 
it is doing as it is rivaled by high-end mobile phones, including the iPhone. 
Finally, we’ll take a look at how to stay connected on the road, using both hot­
spots in public places or using a wireless broadband card, which allows you 
to connect securely from just about anywhere on the planet.
Oh, before we forget, we’ll take a look at another cool gadget called the Slingbox. 
This relatively new gadget allows you to watch your television or DVD player 
from anywhere in the world — provided that you’ve got a high-speed connec­
tion and your host has the proper Sling Media equipment installed. 
Book VI: Other Networking Technologies
Starting with cell phones, this book discusses selecting a service plan and 
choosing a phone. It also talks about some other important issues, like 

5
Book VIII: The Global Positioning System
health concerns and number portability. A second chapter talks about a 
similar topic: cordless phones. Which cordless phone technology should 
you choose? The technologies of both cellular and cordless telephony are 
evolving, and they’re getting better all the time. 
Another wireless technology, but one that gets less attention, is the Family 
Radio Service (FRS). With two or more FRS radios, you can stay in contact 
with people within a mile or so of each other while on vacation and elsewhere. 
This book also covers the heavily popular short-range networking technology 
called Bluetooth and the wider range and infinitely useful Wi-Fi technology. 
Finally, I go through some wireless peripherals you may want to include on 
your desk to help get rid of that snake’s nest of cords behind your computer. 
Book VII: Wireless Home Technology
Wireless in the home means a broad array of gear oriented toward entertain­
ment and leisure activities. We’ll show you what it takes to start streaming 
video and audio that lives on your PC to your living room entertainment 
center. If all you care about is getting your music where you want it in 
your house, we show you how to do that, using products like Logitech’s 
Squeezeebox or the Sonos ZonePlayer.
If you want to see HDTV you’ve recorded on your PC, we show you how to 
do that as well, using media center extenders and even game consoles.
In today’s Web-oriented world, though, you’re not limited to media that 
lives on your local PC. There’s a wealth of video and music content available 
through streaming services on a wide array of Web sites. Watching or listen­
ing on your PC is easy, but we show you the hard stuff: watching Web-based 
TV and listening to Web radio in your living room. We say “hard,” but it’s 
easier than you think.
Wireless technology has even invaded that seemingly nondigital technol­
ogy, reading books. Amazon’s new Kindle eBook readers are connected to 
Amazon.com’s online service wirelessly, allowing you to buy an electronic 
version of a bestseller and be reading it minutes later on your Kindle 2 or 
Kindle DX — no PC needed.
So while wireless is great for on the go portability and for business, it’s also 
terrific for improving your home entertainment experience. So kick back, get 
some tunes on, and fire up your eBook reader. 
Book VIII: The Global Positioning System
The global positioning system (GPS) is the U.S. government’s gift to all of 
humankind. It’s a series of geosynchronous satellites that tell wireless GPS 
receivers exactly where they are at all times — and exactly how to get where 

6
Icons
they are going! Read about the technology behind it and how you can use it, 
but be sure to check out my tips regarding what to look for and what options 
to think about when you choose a GPS unit. After that, I describe some 
common GPS terminology that helps you in your quest, whatever it may be. 
Finally, you discover a couple of ways to use GPS technology that go beyond 
simple navigation, including an amazing and growing game called geocaching.
Icons
I point out some issues or topics to you with the use of icons. 
	
A tip is a helpful bit of information that hopefully helps you accomplish a 
specific task a little easier. By flagging tips with icons, you can quickly find 
nuggets of helpful information.
	
Everyone needs a reminder now and then about something that’s already 
been mentioned. That’s where the Remember icon comes into play. 
Sometimes, the icon indicates something that’s common sense or that you 
already know, but I point it out just in case.
	
Whoa, Betsy! You should know some important things, and I point out these 
with a Warning icon. Heed these or proceed at your own risk. I keep these to 
a minimum so that when you see one, you know it really is important.
	
Are you a geek? There’s nothing wrong with that, as geeks now rule the 
world. If you see a Technical Stuff icon, it’s likely the content is something 
you’ll enjoy reading because of its technical bent. Geeks aren’t dummies, but 
Dummies books are for geeks, too. Even if you’re not a geek, it can’t hurt to 
discover something new.
Where to Go from Here
Scissors ready? The next step is to begin cutting the wires that constrain 
your lifestyle. Instead, embrace radio waves and all things wireless! (Don’t 
actually embrace them, as that effort is futile. They also can fry you; just 
look inside your microwave oven while it’s running. But you know what I 
mean.) Lie upon the psychiatrist’s sofa, as it were, and reject your old, 
constrained, wired life. Free those demons.
See you in the wireless world!

Chapter 1: Living Without Wires
In This Chapter
✓	Saying goodbye to the wired life
✓	Connecting to the world on the go
✓	Dealing with the downside
P
repare to do away with wires. Technology is terrific, but until recently 
the term has also been synonymous with snakes nests of cables under 
every table, counter, and desk in the whole darn house. No longer must this 
be the case.
This chapter introduces you to the ways of wireless. Wires have all kinds of 
downsides and few positives, and we take a look at the good parts of remov­
ing as many cords, cables, and technological tethers as you possibly can 
and still have your gizmos function the way they should. I cover wireless 
broadband, clearing cable clutter from beneath your household surfaces, 
and always knowing exactly where you are with a GPS device. Moreover, I 
talk about keeping connected to the world while on the go and the wonder­
ful world of Wi-Fi.
There are downsides to living wirelessly, and you can glance at them, too. 
Wireless stuff is usually “always on,” and that can be a hindrance. Find out 
why, and much more, in this introductory chapter.
Bidding Adieu to Wired Life
When you think about it, wires can be a real hassle. They limit your ability 
to move freely and to place things where you want them. A very good exam­
ple of this is the ordinary everyday telephone. If you use a wired telephone, 
you have to sit at your desk or stand next to the wall phone to have a con­
versation. If the doorbell rings, you have to tell the person on the other end 
of the line to hold on while you go see who’s at the door. If you’re using a 
cordless phone or a cell phone, you can simply continue your conversation 
while you walk to the door.
A whole world of wireless possibilities
Now multiply the convenience provided by your wireless phone to include 
the whole multitude of gadgets that fill your home. Just imagine how these 
additional examples might apply to your situation:

10
Bidding Adieu to Wired Life
	
✦	 You’re stuck with a slow dial-up connection to the Internet. Broadband is 
tempting, however, even if you’re out of range of your phone company for 
a DSL connection or cable and fiber connections are unavailable. Consider 
a satellite connection. Even though the latency of such a hookup is worse 
than that with the aforementioned broadband solutions, you can still 
download big files, stream rich multimedia content, and perform other 
bandwidth-intensive tasks far more efficiently than you could with dial-up.
	
✦	 You’re pretty much solo at your computer. By adding a wireless network 
to your home, you can share files, printers, your Internet connection, 
music you’ve downloaded, and multiplayer games without the hassle of 
running wires. If you want to move a PC from one place to another, you 
can do it and not worry whether a handy network outlet is nearby. Why, 
you can even take your wireless laptop out into the backyard and surf 
the Internet in a lawn chair under your favorite tree.
	
✦	 You’re stuck at home waiting on messages and phone calls. With a wire­
less PDA, you are within reach of e-mail at your favorite coffee shop — 
you don’t have to worry about missing that important message from a 
potential new client. You may even listen to an Internet radio station, so 
you don’t have to listen to the rants from a fanatical talk radio show host. 
Figure 1-1 shows an example of a text message using a Pocket PC. Book V 
talks more about PDAs.
	
Figure 1-1:

and receive 
messages 
with the 
built-in 
messaging 
application. 	
	
✦	 You’re sans cell phone. It’s hard to imagine another device that can 
help you keep in touch nearly as well as a cell phone. With it, you can 
quickly check to see what someone’s scribbled notes on your shopping 
list really mean. Don’t take a chance that what looks like sour cream in 
someone’s poor handwriting is actually whipping cream!

Bidding Adieu to Wired Life
	
✦	 You’re sick of the wiry clutter at your desk. Cutting the wires to your 
keyboard, mouse, printer, and other devices sounds like a sure way to kill 
your computer, but wireless peripherals are simply so much more con­
venient than their wired counterparts — especially if your desk is such a 
mess that you haven’t seen the top of it in years. You can use a proprie­
tary wireless standard, Bluetooth devices, or even the forthcoming WUSB 
(wireless universal serial bus) to connect peripherals without wires.
	
✦	 You’re a home entertainment technology junkie. Now, you can set up 
one computer to hold all of your music from your CDs or from Internet 
downloads, and play that music on your home entertainment system 
without putting an ugly PC in the living room and without running 
another tangled mess of wires.
	
✦	 You love radio but hate commercials, and the terrestrial stations don’t 
play the type of songs or talk shows you enjoy. With satellite radio, the 
choices are much more numerous, and many shows are commercial-free!
	
✦	 Your family vacations seem more like battles over who can or cannot 
read a map. You’re going to love how GPS technology can keep you from 
ever having to ask directions again. Figure 1-2 shows my GPS receiver as 
it determines my exact position.
	
Figure 1-2: 
With a GPS 
receiver you 
never have 
to wonder 
where you 
are.
	
I guess if that list doesn’t have you thinking about the possibilities for a wire­
less life, nothing will — but even this list only scratches the surface.
Cutting the cords
Now that you’ve seen some of the ways that you can go wireless, what’s next? 
Actually, that depends. You probably have to do some shopping, either to 
replace existing wired equipment or to add wireless equipment. In either case, 

12
Bidding Adieu to Wired Life
it helps to plan ahead because so many different types of wireless equipment 
exist, and you want to make sure the things you buy work together. That’s 
where this book helps.
Consider the example of the wireless home computer network. As you 
discover in Book III, home computer networks adhere to several different 
standards, and it’s important to make sure that all the equipment you buy 
for your home computer network works with the same standard. As you 
discover in Book VII, the type of equipment you choose for your home 
computer network can have a great impact on how useful your network is 
in supplying entertainment options.
	
When buying wireless equipment, go for the highest performance you can 
afford. That way you won’t close off your future options because the equip­
ment you bought can’t handle the demands of the need to process more 
data. Also, you can postpone the inevitable need to upgrade your equipment 
in the future.
Keeping your options open
Once you get the wireless bug, it can be awfully tempting to want to get rid 
of every cord. As tempting as that may be, just remember that you prob­
ably want to keep your options open. You might, for example, want to make 
sure that you have at least one wired phone in your home because cord­
less phones typically won’t work if there is a power failure — unlike wired 
phones, which generally don’t need a separate power supply. (Even though 
the handset on a cordless telephone runs off rechargeable batteries, the 
base station that it uses to connect to the phone line must be plugged into 
a power outlet to function.) Of course, if you have a digital cable phone 
system, all bets are off; the cable system needs power to supply phone ser­
vice whether or not your phones are corded.
Remember, too, that just because some of your old, existing equipment is 
wired doesn’t mean that it no longer serves any purpose. Sure, you probably 
prefer the convenience of playing music through your home entertainment 
system, which is connected to your computer, but that won’t do you much 
good if you want to listen to some old, vinyl records. (I’ve never seen a PC 
with a built-in turntable.)
	
Don’t forget to stock up on batteries when you go wireless. While some wire­
less devices come with built-in rechargeable batteries, others don’t. Some 
wireless devices run through batteries at an amazing rate; consider buying 
a battery charger and rechargeable batteries for your devices. They’re 
expensive at first, but they certainly save money in the long run. You may 
want to check out iGo (www.igo.com) or Batteries.com to find just the 
battery you need.

Connecting to the World on the Go
Connecting to the World on the Go
Wireless devices really do open up a whole new world for you, and not 
just when you’re at home, either. Sure, it’s pretty obvious that a cell phone 
enables you to connect to the world when you’re on the go, but other wire­
less devices offer plenty of on-the-go options, too.
Connecting your PC on the go
To successfully communicate with someone, you generally have to both be 
using the same language. It doesn’t really matter what language that happens 
to be, as long as you both understand it.
Likewise, computers need to use a common language to communicate. 
Modern wireless home networking equipment uses one of several standard­
ized methods of communication that were developed to enable different 
brands of computers and networking equipment to successfully interact. 
You may have heard of these standards — especially if you’ve tried wading 
into the sometimes confusing world of wireless networking. These standards 
go by names like 802.11n, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a, but they also are 
known by the slightly less precise Wi-Fi label.
	
Even though the Wi-Fi label is applied to all four wireless networking stan­
dards doesn’t mean those standards are identical. Of the four, 802.11b is the 
slowest but also the least expensive when you’re buying hardware. 802.11g 
and 802.11a are rated for similar speeds (about five times as fast as 802.11b) 
but are incompatible with each other because they operate on different 
radio frequencies. 802.11b and 802.11g are generally compatible with each 
other, but can only communicate at the slower 802.11b speed. Just how fast 
are these different standards? That’s impossible to say because your results 
vary greatly, depending on dozens of factors (which you discover in Books 
II and III). Then, of course, there’s 802.11n, the newest and fastest standard, 
which is still emerging as this book is being written.
What does all of this have to do with connecting your PC on the go? Wi-Fi 
isn’t limited to use on home networks. Wi-Fi is also for wireless office net­
works and is becoming widely available in other places, too. Want some 
Internet along with your coffee? Every Starbucks coffee shop now offers 
customers a Wi-Fi connection. (This type of connection is often called a hot­
spot.) If you’d rather have a Big Mac and fries while you surf, head on over 
to McDonald’s — most of their stores have free Wi-Fi connections, too. Look 
for hotspots in airports, book shops, and lots of other places as well.
Head on over to the Wi-Fi-FreeSpot Directory (www.wififreespot.com) to 
find free high-speed Internet access hotspots.

14
Addressing the Downside: You’re Always On
Wi-Fi hotspots generally have a very limited range. In most cases you need 
to be within the building to get a reliable connection (and some hotspots are 
specifically designed to limit the range so that you can only connect if you’re 
inside, where you are expected to be patronizing the store). Even those hot­
spots specifically set up to cover a broader area typically only spread their 
signal a few hundred feet from the hotspot’s antenna, though, so Wi-Fi isn’t a 
good option if you can’t settle in one place close to the hotspot.
What can you do if you want a wireless Internet connection but aren’t 
always within range of a Wi-Fi hotspot? One option is an AirCard from Sierra 
Wireless (www.sierrawireless.com). The AirCard comes in several 
models — each one designed for a specific type of service. Some models 
connect via the Sprint PCS Network, some with the AT&T Wireless Network, 
and some with other flavors of cellular service, too. Generally you should 
do your homework, choose the service plan that’s right for you, and then 
buy the AirCard that works with that service. Sometimes cellular service 
providers even offer special pricing on the AirCard because they know that 
once you’re hooked, you’re probably going to spend a lot of money on your 
monthly service plan.
Connecting for voice and messages
Even though most people think of computers when they think about con­
necting on the go, sometimes a PC is overkill. Sometimes all you need is 
simply the ability to send and receive text messages. A couple of different 
types of wireless devices easily handle this duty:
	
✦	 Wireless PDAs, including some models of the Palm and the Pocket PC, 
can easily send and receive text messages.
	
✦	 The BlackBerry is a wireless device specifically designed for various 
types of electronic messaging, including e-mail and instant text messag­
ing. It has a small, but serviceable keyboard for entering messages.
	
✦	 Most cell phones now support short messaging service (SMS) so you 
can send and receive text messages. Apple's iPhone is a very popular 
PDA/smartphone.
You read more about connecting on the go in Book V.
Addressing the Downside: You’re Always On
If the wireless world has one big problem, it’s that always being connected 
means that people can contact you at any time. Sure, it’s convenient to flip 
open your cell phone to quickly ask someone a question, but don’t forget 
that it is just as convenient for someone to dial your cell phone number and 
interrupt whatever you’re doing.

Book I 
Chapter 1

15
Addressing the Downside: You’re Always On
But once again, you shouldn’t limit your concerns simply to the fact that 
anyone can call your cell phone at any time — that is, unless you’re on vaca­
tion and you’re trying to get away from it all!
Your wireless network is always on
Wireless home networks are awfully convenient because you can simply fire 
up your PC anywhere within range and connect. This convenience has its 
dark side, too. As long as your wireless network is working, a neighbor or a 
stranger driving by can conveniently try to connect to your home network. 
Remember, the fact that your wireless network doesn’t require someone to 
connect using a physical network cable means it’s much easier for someone 
you don’t want on your network to gain access.
You can, of course, apply some security measures to make it harder for 
people to break into your wireless home network. In fact, it’s not only pos­
sible, but it’s also essential that you enable your wireless network’s security 
features if you don’t want to run into serious problems. See Book IV for more 
information on this very important topic.
Your wireless gadgets are probably open, too
Imagine how difficult it would be to keep your automobile safe if the manu­
facturers were in the habit of delivering cars without locks because they felt 
that locks were too complicated for the average driver. In most major cities 
you’d probably be able to measure in minutes (or hours, at the most) the 
time before your car was stolen.
Unfortunately, the manufacturers of many wireless devices do something 
similar to building cars without locks. Rather than building in advanced 
security features (or, as is the case with wireless home networking gear, 
leaving the security features turned off by default), manufacturers often opt 
for dumbing down their products so they work as soon as you take them out 
of the box. Bluetooth-equipped cell phones present an easy target for snoop­
ers for this reason. (See Book VI for more information on Bluetooth technol­
ogy and the security risks that are involved.)
In reality, the manufacturers probably are correct; so few people bother to 
read the technical sections of their product manuals that enabling features 
that increase security would result in many calls for help from new users. 
Or, even worse from the manufacturer’s perspective, it could result in prod­
ucts being returned to the stores because “it doesn’t work.”
You can go a long way toward protecting your wireless world by taking a few 
minutes to understand (and use) whatever security measures are offered 
by your wireless devices. Remember, the harder you make it for a thief or 
a snoop, the more likely he’ll move on and find an easier target. Even the 
simplest security measures often deter thieves unless they’re specifically 

16
Addressing the Downside: You’re Always On
looking to get at your data. Thieves looking to score any data, or leech any 
Internet connection, typically skip the security-enabled devices and con­
tinue on their way.
Taking back control
Yes, going wireless does make life more convenient, and often a lot more 
fun, too. Keeping things in perspective is important, as well as making sure 
that the convenience isn’t overshadowed by letting the wireless devices con­
trol your life, rather than the other way around. You do have the ultimate 
weapon if you’re willing to use it, and that’s the on/off switch.

Chapter 2: Choosing 
Internet Access
In This Chapter
✓	Using satellites for Internet access
✓	Microwaving without food
✓	Maximizing access with WiMax
You probably connect to the Internet using DSL or cable modem service, 
both of which deliver data over fat broadband connections, mean­
ing they feature fairly wide bandwidth and allow data to download fairly 
quickly. (If you’re going online via a dial-up connection, I hope you’re con­
sidering switching to broadband access before venturing much farther into 
this book. Speedier broadband access is practically required for connecting 
to the Internet nowadays, if you don’t want to spend your life in front of 
your computer, waiting for Web pages to load and programs to download.)
But what if you live in an area that doesn’t have either DSL or cable modem 
broadband service? What’s a computer user to do? (Thank goodness you at 
least have access to Dummies books!) If you live someplace where the local 
telecommunications providers haven’t gotten around to offering broadband 
service, or if you live too far out of range of them to be able to offer you a 
high-bandwidth pipe, you can always turn to at least one other option.
In many cases this option is satellite Internet access. In some areas, you 
might be able to subscribe to something called fixed wireless, which means 
the company broadcasts a signal directly to your home (and you back to 
them). Both of these options can be expensive, but they are options.
In even fewer areas, entire cities or city centers are covered by Wi-Fi access, 
a topic I also talk about in Book V, Chapter 5.
	
I cover another wireless Internet technology that uses the cellular telephone 
network elsewhere in the book. You can find information about cellular-
based packet data networks in Book VI, Chapter 1. In addition, some cel­
lular carriers have launched so-called 3G (third-generation) networks that 
provide mobile data services, and 4G is on the way. I cover this in Book VI, 
Chapter 1, too.

Using Satellite Service
Using Satellite Service
Just like satellite TV services deliver television programming directly to your 
home, satellite Internet providers provide you with broadband access that 
you can use to do anything you would do on the Internet over DSL and cable 
modem services.
Satellite service is great for folks who are off the beaten path (or don’t 
even have a path nearby). The service might also be an alternative if you 
simply dislike your current DSL or cable modem provider, but beware some 
downsides:
	
✦	 You need a clear view to the south, as that’s where the satellite is in 
geosynchronous orbit — right over the equator.
	
✦	 Bad weather can slow or cut off your Internet access, just like heavy rain 
and snow tend to disrupt satellite TV service.
	
✦	 Trees that grow in your satellite path are not your friends. And as I 
learned the hard way, don’t set up service in winter, when the trees 
have no leaves. As soon as spring comes, those leaves will grow back 
and obstruct your once-great, clear view to the south.
	
✦	 Expect more latency than you experience with a typical cable, DSL, or 
fiber broadband connection. It takes time for the signal to get from the 
satellite to a receiver/transmitter dish, and a similar amount of time for 
the signal to get from the dish to the satellite. Thus, some time-sensitive 
Internet activities such as gaming and VOIP (voice over internet proto­
col) don’t work well with a satellite connection.
StarBand by Spacenet
StarBand by Spacenet satellite service is available throughout the entire 
United States (yes, even Alaska and Hawaii), Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. It’s a two-way, always-on broadband service similar to DSL and cable 
modem service. It works with PC and Mac, Linux, and Unix, although tech 
support only provides help with Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP 
Home, and Windows XP Professional and Mac OS X — that’s according to 
the FAQ on the company’s page.
StarBand evidently used to have a service that 
let you mount a satellite antenna on your RV 
so you could stay connected no matter where 
you traveled in the United States. Now, accord­
ing to the FAQ on the Web site, that’s not 
possible. The antenna both transmits and 
receives information to and from the satellite, 
and such a connection requires too precise an 
installation to allow travel.
Traveling with connections

Choosing Internet 
Access
19
Using Satellite Service
Monthly service fees start at $69.99 for Nova 1000, a tier with download 
speeds up to 1 Mbps and upload speeds up to 128 Kbps. A one-time equip­
ment fee includes the satellite dish and satellite modem, and that costs 
$299.99. An installation fee also applies, as StarBand requires that a profes­
sional install the equipment. Self-installation is not allowed.
A second tier of service, called Nova 1500, offers download speeds up to 1.5 
Mbps and upload speeds up to 256 Kbps, and it starts at a monthly rate of 
$99.99 (plus equipment and installation charges).
HughesNet
HughesNet, formerly DirectWay, which itself was formerly called DirecPC, 
offers a satellite Internet service very similar to StarBand’s. For its home 
package, it advertises up to 1.0 Mpbs for download and 128 Kbps for upload.
The service provider also limits to 22 the number of concurrent Internet 
connections. Unlikely a problem for simple Web surfing, but once you have a 
Web browser, e-mail program, music download software, and other Internet 
applications working all at the same time, the 22 connections begin to want 
for more.
HughesNet has many pricing plans, offering Home, Pro, ProPlus, Elite, and 
more, each of which has different tiers of bandwidth both upstream and 
down. Furthermore, you can choose whether to purchase or lease the neces­
sary equipment. The sheer number of possibilities makes it impossible to 
list all the prices you might pay for HughesNet service, but expect to pay 
between $99 and $299 upfront for equipment and $59 to $349 monthly for 
bandwidth.
Both StarBand and HughesNet employ some­
thing they call fair use or fair access poli­
cies. In a nutshell, the policies may limit how 
much bandwidth you can consume in a given 
time period. They’re designed to keep a 
small number of users from monopolizing the 
services.
StarBand “reserves the right, and will take nec­
essary steps, to prevent improper or excessive 
consumption of bandwidth used,” according to 
its fair access policy. It does, however, relax 
the policy during the wee hours of the morning. 
As for HughesNet, it too relaxes its fair access 
policy in the middle of the night. “Currently, 
you can use your HughesNet service for sev­
eral hours during the middle of the night (the 
“Download Period”) with relaxed application 
of the Fair Access Policy. The hours of unre­
stricted use shall begin no later than 2:00 AM 
and end no earlier than 7:00 AM eastern time.”

Maxing Out with WiMax
Maxing Out with WiMax
A lot of people in the wireless arena are asking, “Whatever happened to 
WiMax?” WiMaxstands for world interoperability for microwave access. It’s 
a broadband wireless service that has the capability to provide service for 
people who get around.
One firm predicted that by 2009, more than 7 million subscribers worldwide 
would be using the fixed version of WiMax (not including mobile uses). 
What’s so great about WiMax is that it’s like having ubiquitous Wi-Fi access. 
Whether you’re in your home, in your backyard, or in your car, you would 
have constant Internet access. Somehow, WiMax didn’t jump into the center 
of the arena like many people thought it would.
WiMax had, and still has, the possibility of providing fast Internet access 
throughout a metropolitan area (unlike a local multipoint distribution 
system, which I describe next). Think about cell phones and how they 
continue to work as you move around. You don’t have to turn off your cell 
phone when you leave your house and then turn it on again when you get in 
your car, so why should you have to do that with wireless Internet access? If 
WiMax ever makes the kind of splash that pundits once predicted, you won’t 
need to do that.
WiMax requires new access adapters in desktop and laptop computers 
because it’s incompatible with Wi-Fi technology. While it’s been slow to 
catch on, there are a few WiMax devices on the market — it will be interest­
ing to see if they take off or simply fizzle out.

Chapter 1: Getting Started
In This Chapter
✓	Figuring out your needs
✓	Surveying your wireless network
✓	Understanding radios
✓	Making a shopping list
Just five years ago, wireless networking was expensive and difficult to 
set up. Fortunately advances in technology have lowered costs and 
increased features, resulting in something that’s both affordable and easy 
to set up. In fact, it’s hard to ignore wireless networking now because it’s 
everywhere!
Wireless networking has many benefits, including:
	
✦	 Mobility: If you can drag your computer somewhere, you can get on your 
network from there. You don’t even have to shut it down! Take your com­
puter from the kitchen to the bedroom without having to close your work 
or tell your chat buddy “BRB” (that’s “be right back” for those who were 
wondering).
	
✦	 Fewer cables: Technically, there’s only one less cable, but I’ve found 
that the network and power cables are the most bothersome. Now all 
you have to worry about is power, and I’m sure you’ve got more power 
outlets than network drops in your house.
	
✦	 Expandability: Adding a computer to a wireless network takes a few 
mouse clicks. Adding a computer to a wired network often takes a drill 
and a lot of cable. Plus, you have to make sure you’ve got enough net­
work ports. Guess which is faster to get up and running?
This chapter gets you started building your own wireless network. First, 
you need to determine what it is that you want to get out of your wireless 
network. Next, you find out how wireless networks work, and apply this to 
finding any potential trouble spots in your house. Finally, we get you ready 
to go shopping!

Figuring Out What You Want to Do
Figuring Out What You Want to Do
Before you even think about how to build your wireless network, take some 
time to figure out what you want to do with it. Hey, maybe you don’t even 
need wireless. Would this be a bad time to mention your bookstore’s “no 
refunds” policy?
When it comes down to it, networks connect people. You might connect to 
gain access to a service such as e-mail or the Web, or you might connect 
to share some files between two computers. Wired or wireless, a network’s 
value is in the connections it provides.
You can do pretty much anything on a wireless network that you can on a 
wired network. Your requirements affect the kind of equipment you need, 
so it’s important that you think about what you want to do before you open 
your wallet.
Think about which of the following you’d like to be able to do:
	
✦	 Access the Internet. The Internet’s a big place, and to see it you have to 
connect your network somehow.
	
✦	 Share files. Do you have more than one computer in your home? Do you 
want to be able to get files between the two? Or maybe you’re looking 
for a separate device to store files on, and you need to connect to that. 
Are these small files, large files, or huge files? Even though USB key fobs 
are cheap, you can’t beat the convenience of being able to copy files by 
the drag-and-drop method.
	
✦	 Watch video. Services are available that let you watch video over the 
Internet. You may also have a device that will let you watch TV over 
your home network. Either way, video introduces some demands that 
not every piece of wireless equipment can accommodate. 
	
✦	 Play video games. If you’re a gamer, then you know how network condi­
tions can affect your game. You can’t control much on the Internet, but 
you can make sure that your network’s not the problem.
	
✦	 Print. Printers are coming with wireless capabilities now, so you can put 
your printer wherever you want, or move it whenever you need.
Give some thought to devices you have that may already be wireless capa­
ble. They may need an upgrade, or alter your plans slightly, depending on 
their age. You don’t want that old PC you got from your aunt dragging down 
the speed of your network if you can avoid it.
Finally, think about where in your house you want to use your computer and 
wireless peripherals. We get into the details about range shortly, but a wire­
less solution for a living room will be different for a 30-room mansion, espe­
cially if you also need Internet access down in the guest mansion. What’s 
that? Your guest mansion’s empty? When can I move in?

Going the Distance
Going the Distance
Just like your favorite radio station, the radio waves from your wireless 
network can’t travel forever. And even if they could, your computer doesn’t 
have the power to talk back.
Unlike your favorite radio station, the distances involved are much smaller. 
A radio station’s coverage is measured in miles; your network is measured 
in feet.
	
Why, you ask? Isn’t all radio the same? Not by a long shot! A radio station’s 
power output is around 100,000 watts; your wireless devices are under a 
tenth of a watt. Frequency plays a part in it, too — higher frequencies travel 
shorter distances. Your wireless network’s frequencies are at least 20 times 
as high as your radio’s.
The wireless engineers at the IEEE are constantly updating their standards 
to give you faster speeds and better distance. (Incidentally, IEEE used to 
stand for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, but taking a page 
from a famous fried chicken chain, they have rebranded themselves just as 
IEEE, which is pronounced “Eye-triple-E”) These standards are supposed to 
ensure that if you buy two products from two different vendors, they can 
work together.
IEEE standards for wireless have a name starting with 802.11 and ending with 
a letter. Each letter is a different standard that may or may not be interopera­
ble with other standards. We talk about the standards in the next chapter, but 
just so you have an idea, here are some of the ranges of the various standards.
Table 1-1 shows ranges you can expect in a typical indoor environment. Note 
the use of the word typical. Depending on your hardware, your environment, 
and where you place your devices, you may see better or worse distances.

It’s Wireless, Not Magic!
It’s Wireless, Not Magic!
In the previous section, you learned that your wireless network has a limited 
range, and that it’s hard to place a finger on what that range will be. In this 
section, you find out what kind of things cause problems with wireless signals.
A simple wireless network consists of a central radio, called an access point, 
that connects to a wireless transmitter/receiver in your computer, game con­
sole, or portable device. The access point is responsible for everything on 
the wireless network, so it’s important that your equipment and the access 
point have no problems communicating.
Wireless isn’t magic. It’s a radio wave. Radio waves follow the laws of physics, 
some of which have the end result of damaging radio signals to the point 
where they can’t be decoded. A signal that can’t be decoded is useless to all 
involved; the result is a slow (or nonexistent) network.
In general, wireless problems fall into two categories: interference from 
other radio waves, and interference from physical objects.
Interference from other radio waves
Whatever country you’re from, your government likely regulates which wire­
less frequencies can be used, by issuing licenses to people for certain parts 
(bands) of the radio waves. The governments do this in part to make sure 
that multiple people don’t try to use the same frequency and step all over 
each other. (They also do it because they get large sums of money out of the 
deal.) Have you ever played with remote control cars when two people pick 
up a transmitter with the same frequency? Oh, what fun that is, when the 
single car tries to respond to two sets of commands.
Wireless network devices operate in unlicensed bands. Unlicensed bands 
are free for anyone to use as long as they abide by the rules the government 
set out. These rules, for one, limit the power output of a device so that your 
transmitter doesn’t interfere with your whole block.
Anything transmitting in the ranges that wireless radios use (2.4 GHz and 
5 GHz) is a potential source of interference. Other wireless networking 
devices can cause problems. This is why the IEEE specified several channels 
within the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. These channels are on slightly different 
frequencies so that two devices can coexist. We go over a lot more informa­
tion about adjusting your channels later in this chapter, but for now, remem­
ber that having two access points on the same channel is a bad thing.
Microwave ovens emit interference in the 2.4 GHz range, which as you now 
know is the same as what your computer’s trying to use. Playing with your 
access point’s channels is not going to do much here, because microwave 
ovens interfere with all of them.

Your best bet for dealing with microwave ovens is to get them as far away 
from your computer and access point as possible. For example, I’ve got my 
microwave oven in one corner of the house and my access point on the 
opposite corner on a different level. This arrangement usually works unless 
I’m trying to use my computer in the kitchen with the microwave on.
Another source of interference is from cordless phones. Phones generally 
come in 900 MHz models, and, you guessed it, 2.4 GHz. Cordless phones 
bounce around from frequency to frequency to try to avoid interference. 
You’ll probably find that the wireless network causes you more problems 
while talking on the phone than the other way around, though. However, if 
you’re having periodic network problems and can’t pin a cause on it, you 
might want to check and see if someone’s talking on a cordless phone at 
the time.
Interference from other items
Radio waves can be interrupted in flight by almost any solid object. Walls, 
doors, furniture, and even glass can degrade your wireless signal.
Walls are likely to be your biggest concern. In general, the bigger and thicker 
the wall, the worse it’s going to make the signal. Simple drywall walls may 
not cause a problem, but brick or stone walls, or metal (such as a concrete 
wall reinforced with rebar), are going to cause problems.
If your house has several levels, then try to determine what kind of material 
is between the floors. In a house, it’s usually wood, which is only a mild 
barrier to radio waves.
The easiest approach to dealing with interference is to place your access 
point as close as possible to the places you want to use wireless. If you find 
some dead areas, you can try moving your access point. In the worst case, 
you buy a second access point or a repeater to give service to the dead 
zone. It’s a lot cheaper than knocking down walls, after all.
Radio engineers have also found other problems caused by walls and 
furniture that have to do with the way radio waves bounce off of things. 
The 802.11n standard has features to deal with these.
Preparing to Shop
When wireless standards were first introduced, the cost of wireless was 
obscene. Access points ran in the thousands of dollars and were marketed 
to big companies with buckets of cash. Unsurprisingly, the technology was 
much slower and difficult to manage.

28
Preparing to Shop
Now, competition in consumer-grade computer equipment has driven down 
prices, and advances in manufacturing have allowed engineers to do more 
with less.
Prices in consumer electronics tend to follow an interesting pattern. First, 
the cost is high as a new technology is introduced. As the technology gains 
ground, the price drops as competition enters the market. This should not 
be a surprise.
The technology life cycle
If you’ve followed any area of technology, 
you’ll know that stuff keeps on getting better. 
Cameras get smaller, computers get faster, 
and televisions get bigger. You might expect 
that you’d have more options and be able to 
choose how fast you want your computer to 
be, but that is rarely the case.
When making parts for electronics devices, it’s 
in the manufacturer’s best interest to make as 
few versions as possible. Over the past couple 
of decades, Intel has made chips for comput­
ers that run from 4 MHz to over 3 GHz. Digital 
cameras started out well under a megapixel 
but have now blown past 12 megapixels. USB 
memory keys started out at megabyte, and now 
they’re replacing your hard drive. But try to go 
to a store and find the full array of products? 
Not going to happen.
Part of it is that people are buying the higher 
end gear, but it’s also that it costs more to 
make the old stuff. Chip-making machines have 
already been retooled for the newest chips. 
The chips to make a computer’s wired network 
card run at the original 10 megabits per second 
cost a lot more than the ones that let them run 
100 times faster.
At the same time, manufacturers shoot for cer­
tain price points. In the 1980s, a new computer 
cost around $2,000. The next model was faster 
and had more space, but it still cost around 
$2,000. Once the old model was sold out, it 
wasn’t being made anymore.
This $2,000 price point carried on for a while. 
Then the introduction of the Internet drove 
demand for computers up, and advances in 
manufacturing (and the increased demand) 
drove the manufacturer’s cost down. Now that 
$2,000 price point is much closer to $400.
The same goes with cellular phones. The price 
of phones has stayed the same, but you just get 
more features. Phones now have cameras and 
built-in MP3 players and can play video games. 
It’s hard to find a basic cell phone now. The 
demand is low, and it’s getting so cheap to add 
the phone or MP3 player that it makes more 
economic sense to not offer the bare-bones 
version.
Every so often something disruptive comes to 
a product that makes the current technology 
less desirable. Plasma and LCD televisions 
made older tube televisions cheap, for a while, 
as manufacturers tried to get rid of their parts 
inventory and to make a profit off their soon-to-
be obsolete technology while they could. When 
a new wireless standard is on the horizon, the 
current technology drops in price. The popular­
ity of wireless made the price of wired network 
equipment take a nosedive as manufacturers 
tried to keep the sales coming in.

However, as the technology matures, the cost stays within the same range; 
you just tend to get something that’s smaller, faster, or more feature rich 
than the device that came out the month before. Instead of staying on the 
market, older equipment just goes away as it gets replaced. Prices fall only 
after something really innovative happens, usually because the manufactur­
ers want you to stay with that technology instead of the new thing.
Within the price range of a particular technology, you find that the latest and 
greatest model costs the most. If you want to save a fair bit of money, you 
can get something with 90 percent of the features and speed of the device 
that happened to be new just a little while ago. You can also go really cheap 
and get a knock-off device made by a company you’ve never heard of. Each 
has their advantages and disadvantages.
All that said, the next section has a list of the types of equipment you’ll be 
looking at, along with the expected price range.
Putting Together Your Shopping List
Here’s where you get familiar with the types of equipment you might need 
and devise the list of what you need.
	
✦	 A wireless access point connects your wireless network to your wired 
network. The access point’s job is to manage the wireless network and 
relay messages between the wireless and wired devices. An access point 
costs between $50 and $150, depending on the technology.
	
✦	 A wireless router is really a few devices in one box. It’s a firewall that 
connects your network to the Internet and provides some network 
services and safety along the way. We go over these features later. The 
router also has a built-in access point. Optionally, the router can have a 
few wired network ports.
	
	 Wireless routers, like the one in Figure 1-1, go for $50 and up, depending 
on what extra features are on them and how fast they go. Most quality 
routers are in the $100 range, though. A wireless router can also be used 
only as an access point by plugging it in a certain way and not configur­
ing all the features.
	
✦	 A wireless range extender (shown in Figure 1-2) is used to boost a wireless 
signal for areas where the signal is weak. These, too, are like access points 
(some can double as an access point). As long as the extender can receive 
the signal well, it can rebroadcast at a higher power to extend the range. 
You should be able to find range extenders for $50–$100.

✦	 On the computer side of things is the wireless NIC. For laptops that don’t 
have wireless built in, you need a notebook adapter, sometimes called a 
PC card for your computer. These devices cost from $50 to $150, depend­
ing on features and the standards the card supports. Figure 1-3 shows 
such an adapter.
	
Figure 1-3:

✦	 If you are upgrading a desktop machine, you have a couple of options. 
You may buy either a PCI card that goes inside the computer or a USB-
based one that plugs into a free USB slot. Note in Figure 1-4 that the 
PCI-based card has an external antenna, which is helpful in obtaining the 
best signal, especially if your desktop is in a tight spot.

Putting Together Your Shopping List
Nothing says you can’t use a USB adapter with a laptop. You’ll find the PC 
card is probably more convenient because part of the card is inside your 
computer.
Wireless cards for PCs cost about the same as their laptop counterparts, 
though you may pay slightly more for the benefits of an external antenna.
To get your shopping list started, you’ll want an access point or a router, 
plus a wireless card for each device you want to get on the network. Take 
stock of your existing computers; they may already have a wireless NIC 
built in.
Don’t pull out your wallet just yet. We’ve yet to get into the various options 
you have underneath the wireless umbrella. There are different radio stan­
dards, frequencies, antennas, and routers . . . I’m getting excited just think­
ing about the possibilities!

rowse the aisles of your favorite electronics store, and you will find a 
dizzying number of equipment choices at all price levels. You’ve got to 
choose between the various 802.11 standards, whether you need a router or 
an access point, which brand to buy, and which optional features you want. 
Did you need wired ports? So many choices, what do you do?
In this chapter, you find out what hardware you need to get on the Internet 
and to build your wireless network. After you read this chapter, you can con­
fidently make a purchase. You’ll also want to make sure your Internet connec­
tion is up to par. You are likely to have a few Internet access options available 
to you, so you’ll want to make sure you know what each option offers. 
The information in this chapter can help you form the foundation of your 
wireless network, so the best place to start is where the Internet meets 
your house.
Exploring Your Options: DSL or Cable
If you watch television for a while, you can see lots of ads for Internet 
access. Several companies are vying for your business, and they’re all offer­
ing something slightly different. How do you cut through this noise and buy 
the right product for you?
Before you get much further on the topic, though, your decision might 
already be made for you. Maybe you’re in a location where you’ve only got 
one option. Maybe you already have something. In that case, feel free to skip 
this section, or read on if you’re interested.
Look at the flyers that come in your mailbox or newspaper. Look at your 
telephone and cable bills. Chances are you’re being offered a choice 
between digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable. Usually both options are 
called “High Speed Internet,” or some flavor of that. But read the fine print, 

34
Exploring Your Options: DSL or Cable
it’s probably one of those. If it comes from the phone company, it’s DSL. If it 
comes from the cable company, it’s cable.
Depending on where you live, you might be offered a satellite service, or 
even a fiber-based service. You also should have the option of dial-up. So 
many options! My head is spinning!
All other things being equal, your decision comes down to comparing speed 
and cost. How fast do you need your Internet to be, and how much do you 
want to spend?
Sharing the road
Even though the term information superhighway died a merciful death many 
years back, it’s sometimes helpful to think of the Internet as a road system. 
When you browse the Web, or receive e-mail, your computer sends informa­
tion in the form of packets to the other end, which can be a Web server or an 
e-mail system. The other end looks at these packets and sends the response 
back to you in a new series of packets. These streams of packets are often 
called traffic.
It might help to think of these packets as cars on a road. Your Internet con­
nection is a small road that can carry so many cars. This road connects to 
bigger roads that eventually lead to superhighways that are many lanes 
wide. Depending on who you’re trying to talk to, they may be located right 
off the highway in the case of a busy Web site, or they may be on a road 
much like yours in the case of a small Web site or home user.
Just like cars on a road, Internet traffic sometimes gets congested if too 
many cars try to use the road. Only so many cars can fit on a single lane, 
which means information takes longer to get between the two sides.
Dealing with DSL
DSL is an Internet service that is delivered over your regular phone line. The fre­
quencies that make up voice fall within a small range, so a DSL modem throws 
the Internet signals into the space that’s left. At the phone company, these 
Internet signals are pulled out by a device called a DSLAM (what it means isn’t 
important, but it’s one of the coolest acronyms in the networking field).
The Internet goes on the higher frequencies, which means every phone jack 
in your house needs a filter placed on it so that you don’t hear the noise gen­
erated by the high frequencies, and your phone doesn’t affect the quality of 
the data transmissions.
You can choose from a wide variety of DSL, and only your Internet service 
provider knows which ones are being used. You can find that you usually get 
the appropriate DSL modem provided as part of the service, so don’t worry 

Book II
Chapter 2
Choosing Hardware
35
Exploring Your Options: DSL or Cable
too much about buying one of your own. However, do make sure this is 
the case if you are looking at DSL. You then plug your network into the DSL 
modem.
The advantages of DSL are that you have a dedicated connection between 
your computer and the service provider, rather than sharing it with your 
neighbors. However, your Internet traffic eventually merges with your neigh­
bors in the provider’s high-speed core, anyway. DSL offers good speeds, 
and because it’s delivered over your phone line, you can usually get a price 
break by bundling your DSL and phone service.
DSL is usually offered in different grades, such as 1 Mbps down and 384K up. 
This means you can download files at 1 million bits per second, or roughly a 
compact disc’s worth of files in an hour and a half. The upstream speed isn’t 
as important because the bulk of your Internet usage is downloading. Having 
1 Mbps down is adequate for Web browsing, but having 3–5 Mbps is more 
desirable. (It goes up from there, so if you plan on downloading a lot of files, 
then look at higher plans.) 
Contemplating cable
Cable-based Internet uses some TV channels for sending and receiving the 
Internet signals. A cable modem plugs into your TV jack, you plug your net­
work into the cable modem, and you’re off to the races.
Cable is a shared medium, so the connection between you and the service 
provider is shared, usually with your neighborhood. Cable is capable of 
higher speeds than DSL, so this tends to even out.
Like DSL, you require a modem (but not a DSL modem). The usual practice 
of cable companies seems to be to charge a rental fee for the modem or to 
allow you to buy your own. Cable modems tend to follow only one standard 
called DOCSIS, so finding a compatible cable modem is easier. If you want to 
go down this road, ask your cable company for a list of supported modems 
and follow it to the letter!
Cable, too, is often sold in various grades. These grades are likely to be faster 
than DSL, but remember, you are sharing your connection. Usually the basic 
package is good enough to get you started, and you can easily upgrade later. 
	
Don’t forget to ask about bundling opportunities if you’re a cable subscriber.
Debating dial-up
I only mention dial-up in here to tell you to avoid it. It’s slow. It doesn’t cost 
much less than a basic high-speed DSL or cable package. You can’t use your 
phone when you’re on the Internet because your computer is using it, which 
defeats the purpose of wireless. Did I mention it’s slow?

36
Going over the Letters
Just remember that both DSL and dial-up are delivered over the same phone 
service. Dial-up requires you to use a modem in your computer to make a 
call to another modem at your provider, while DSL injects the Internet sig­
nals on top of your voice calls (which you don’t notice). DSL is good, dial-up 
is bad.
Oh, yeah, and dial-up is slow.
Exploring FIOS or FTTH options
Depending on where you live, you might have the option of getting fiber optic 
cable delivered to your home. You might see it called FIOS (Fiber Optic Service) 
or FTTH (Fiber to the Home). Pronouncing the two might get messy, though.
Fiber optic cable can deliver a lot of speed. It’s reliable, too. This extra speed 
will cost from “slightly more than cable” to “a lot more than cable,” depend­
ing on how fast you want to go. But, if the option is available to you, it’s 
worth looking at. You will be able to get speeds much faster than cable or 
DSL. Depending on the provider of the fiber, you may be able to get better 
entertainment offerings, such as high-definition television and video on 
demand over the same fiber.
Going over the Letters
Getting set up with Internet access (if you don’t have it already) takes a 
few days, which gives you time to think about the kind of wireless network 
you want.
The eggheads . . . I mean engineers . . . at the IEEE have been improving 
wireless standards to make them faster and more reliable. The IEEE 802.11 
standards describe how wireless signals are transmitted and decided and in 
traditional geeky fashion have names such as 802.11a, 802.11b, and so forth. 
Over 20 standards exist in the 802.11 family, although consumer products 
only advertise support for a handful of them.
The Original — 802.11
The first one didn’t have a letter after it, but it provided 1 or 2 megabit 
service at 2.4 GHz. It worked, but given the state of industry in 1997, it was 
expensive and bulky. They were the size of a shoebox!
The other standards out there are amendments to 802.11.
Improving on things — 802.11a and b
Despite coming out at nearly the same time, 802.11a and 802.11b are very 
different. The 802.11b improves on the original standard by giving up to 
11 megabits over the same 2.4 GHz frequency. This increase in speed drove 

Book II 
Chapter 2
Choosing Hardware
37
Going over the Letters
adoption of 802.11b networks, which pushed manufacturers to build smaller 
and cheaper devices.
802.11a on the other hand runs at 54 megabits per second, and at the 5 GHz 
frequency. You get a lot of noise at 2.4 GHz, so the IEEE thought it best to 
get out of that band. There’s also more room up there, which means you 
can have more radios operating in the same area without stepping on each 
other. The downside is a slightly decreased range; indoor networks are usu­
ally rated at around 100 feet for 802.11a and at 150 feet for 802.11b. Needless 
to say, unless your gear has both a and b radios in them, you have to choose 
one or the other.
Mass market appeal and low prices made 802.11b the winner here, so you 
won’t find much 802.11a gear out there. The market for 802.11a is mostly com­
panies that are willing to spend some extra money for the benefits of 802.11a. 
802.11b has been superseded by 802.11g. You can still find some 802.11a 
gear out there if you’re buying for a company, but you’re likely not going to 
find it on the shelves of a store. 
Giving you 1999 speeds in 2003, it’s 802.11g!
802.11g got the 2.4 GHz radios to the speed of the 5 GHz radios, only a few 
years later. 802.11g is also backward compatible with the b standard, so you 
can use an older network card on your g network, albeit at the lower speed.
	
There is a significant downside to running an older b radio on a g network, 
though, which is that the whole network’s performance is degraded even if 
one b radio is joined up. In the worst case you get 802.11b performance, so 
it’s worthwhile to upgrade any legacy 802.11b clients if you’re going to run 
802.11g.
That aside, 802.11g provides good speeds, good coverage, and it’s cheap. 
Despite being released in 2003, this version is still current. If you look at 
what’s on your store shelves, or if you already have a network card, chances 
are it’s 802.11g (or n, but I cover that next).
802.11g is a good choice for the price conscious buyer, or the user that 
doesn’t need anything fancy. At 54 mbps, 802.11g is still faster than your 
Internet connection, and still lets you shuffle files between computers with 
ease. If you already have 802.11g adapters built into your laptop, then this is 
the most straightforward option for you.
802.11n. Or is it pre-n? Or draft 2?
As of the writing of this book, there’s no 802.11n. Although 802.11n has been 
worked on for years, it’s still in draft form. But look in the stores, and you’ll 
see 802.11n devices for sale, how does that happen?

38
Going over the Letters
A patent problem with a part of 802.11n is preventing the standard from 
being completed.
In the meantime, an industry group called the Wi-Fi Alliance has developed 
a certification program for devices to ensure that they comply with draft 2.0 
of the 802.11n standard. This means that any device that’s branded Wi-Fi 
CERTIFIED™ 802.11n draft 2.0 is interoperable with another device with the 
same brand. The logo is shown in Figure 2-1.

A device that is certified to draft 2 of the 802.11n standard can be upgraded 
to the final 802.11n standard by only a change in software. I talk about 
upgrading your router later, but for now, just understand that if you buy a 
certified product, you shouldn’t have to buy anything else to upgrade once 
those lawyers get finished.
	
802.11n operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, and is backward com­
patible to a, b, and g radios. It also doubles the range of 802.11g to 300 feet 
and can operate at speeds of up to 600 Mbps. That’s fast!
Behind those impressive numbers, though, is some marketing magic. You 
only get the benefits of 5 GHz if your equipment has 5 GHz radios (that 
means both your access point and wireless card). Such devices are labeled 
dual band, meaning that they have both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz capability. In 
the interests of dropping costs, though, many 802.11n devices only have the 
2.4 GHz radios.
802.11n gets most of its speed from running larger channels and running 
them in parallel. For this to happen, the frequency has to be clear and the 
device has to have multiple antennas. At the 2.4 GHz range you probably 
have interference from other networks that causes 802.11n to degrade to 
smaller channels. Most consumer devices have two antennas, which is twice 
as good as one, but only half as good as the four that are required to get up 
to 600 Mbps.
It’s not all bad news for 802.11n. There are still improvements on 802.11g 
that make 802.11n faster than g, even in the worst case. If you have a need 
for speed, then 5 GHz 802.11n is where you want to be.

Book II 
Chapter 2

39
Going over the Letters
Another benefit to the dual band radios is that you can run your 802.11n cli­
ents in the 5 GHz range and leave the 2.4 GHz band to the 802.11b/g clients. 
This way you can make sure your speed-hungry devices aren’t slowed down 
by legacy adapters.
Compatibility concerns
Wireless devices are generally downward compatible with other devices in 
the same frequency. Therefore, you can mix 802.11b and 802.11g because 
they’re both running at 2.4 GHz, but not with 802.11a at 5 GHz.
Keep in mind that just because something’s compatible doesn’t mean that 
it’s going to run as well as it could. Even with an 802.11g card (54 Mbit/s, 
remember?), you’re limited to 11 Mbps on an 802.11b network.
When your access point’s capabilities exceed that of the clients, you still 
have problems. An 802.11g access point will instruct all clients to operate in 
a slower compatibility mode if even one 802.11b client is connected. 802.11n 
has some protections to prevent this problem with legacy clients but still is 
not as fast as an 802.11n only network.
802.11n will coexist with 802.11a, as long as you’ve got a dual band net­
work card in your computer. This limitation isn’t too much to worry about 
because 802.11a network cards aren’t terribly popular.

Purchasing a Brand Name
At the moment, 802.11g provides good speed and coverage, and 802.11n 
expands on that. If speed is a concern, go with n. If your laptops already have 
a b or g radio, then consider starting out with 802.11g and then upgrading in a 
year or so after 802.11n is finalized and the gear comes down in price.
Purchasing a Brand Name
Go to the store and you’re going to see an assortment of products, all by dif­
ferent manufacturers. The first part of the selection process is finding which of 
these boxes have the features you want, followed by picking a manufacturer.
You’re going to see a few manufacturers, some you recognize, some you 
don’t. I recommend going with a name-brand product instead of a cheap, 
white, box knockoff, especially if you’re choosing 802.11n. Have a look for 
the following:
	
✦	 Do you recognize the manufacturer? Do you see the same manufacturer 
being advertised by different stores? If so, chances are it’s a reputable 
brand that different stores are willing to stand behind. Also consider 
that an established brand has the resources and desire to maintain the 
software that makes your wireless card work.
	
✦	 Does the manufacturer offer a toll-free support line? You may need to 
call for help at some point.
	
✦	 Does the deal seem too good to be true? Cheap equipment is made cheaply.
	
✦	 Do you see certification logos? This is your guarantee that the device 
will interoperate with other vendors’ equipment.
	
✦	 Do you need to supply other parts? Read the fine print carefully; some­
times items shown on the box aren’t inside the box.
A few bucks extra on a name-brand device will almost certainly save you 
frustration down the road. Talk to some friends, neighbors, or coworkers to 
find out the brands that they like or dislike. 
Routing and Bridging
You’re going to have a network in your house, and it’s going to connect to 
your service provider’s network. To get between networks, you have to route. 
These networks are connected by a device called a router. This router is the 
part that lets you get out on the Internet. Routers also incorporate a firewall, 
which is a protection mechanism from the bad guys out there on the Internet. 
Pretty much every wireless router out there has a built-in firewall.
If you’re connecting parts of your own network, you want to bridge. Maybe 
you’re making your wired network bigger by adding more ports. Maybe 
you’re adding a new wireless access point to an existing wireless network.

Expanding Your Wireless Network
Take a look at Figure 2-2. The connection from the Internet service provider 
(which is drawn as a cloud, because you can’t have a good network drawing 
with at least one cloud) comes in to the router. Anything to the right of the 
router is part of the internal network. On the internal network is a device called 
a switch, which allows you to add wired ports to a network. One of those ports 
connects to an access point, which brings in the wireless computers.

Routing and 
bridging.

The router is routing between the stuff on the left and the stuff on the right. The
network on the right is made up of the switch, the access point, and all the 
computers. The switch and the access point bridge all their connections to 
each other, which is how a small network grows.
Thankfully, you rarely have to worry about this because most routers you 
buy combine the router, the switch, and the wireless access point. If you 
need to connect some wired computers in, then make sure your router has 
enough ports, or that you’ve got an extra switch that you can connect to the 
router to add the ports.
Expanding Your Wireless Network
Before you go thinking “my house is so big, one access point will never be 
enough,” give it a try. You might be surprised at what one access point will 
do, especially if you’re using 802.11n.
If that one access point leaves you with dead spots in your house, try 
moving the access point around (if you can), to see if that helps. Turning an 

42
Expanding Your Wireless Network
access point 90 degrees can make a difference. If that doesn’t clean up those 
pesky dead spots, then you have to look at alternatives.
Upgrading your antenna
Your access point may have removable antennas, in which case you can try 
to find a better antenna. The short, plastic antennas that are what you prob­
ably got with your access point (the highly technical term for these are a 
rubber ducky antenna) are optimized to spray radio energy in all directions 
such as a big sphere. Other antennas are made to spray in one direction, or 
in a doughnut shape.
Changing your antenna is becoming a less attractive option as time goes on. 
Some access points have moved to internal antennae, and with the multiple 
antennas in 802.11n, replacing several antennae is just a pain. Adding more 
devices is becoming so cheap that worrying about your antenna is probably 
not worth it.
Repeaters and range extenders
The easiest approach is to add repeaters, or range extenders, to your net­
work. These devices listen to the existing wireless network and rebroadcast 
the signal. Because of this, you can expect a repeater to increase your wire­
less range by about 150 percent in one direction, as shown in Figure 2-3.

43
Expanding Your Wireless Network
Wireless range extenders are the easiest way to get what you want, even 
though they’re not the most efficient way about going about it. As you can 
see from Figure 2-3, the range extender has to be inside the coverage area of 
the main access point (white circle). This scenario has a fair bit of overlap 
between the two radios: a large part of the extended coverage area (dark 
circle) is already covered by the main access point.
When shopping for range extenders, also remember that some wireless 
access points can be configured as a repeater, which is the same thing. They 
both do a fine job of extending the signal, but knowing that you have the two 
options helps you comparison shop.
Creating multiple access points
The solution that gives you the best range is to use multiple access points 
and then to bridge them together. Figure 2-4 shows how this works.
	
Figure 2-4: 
How to 
connect

points.

This option reduces the overlap between the two wireless zones because the 
two access points don’t have to see each other over the wireless network. 
However, the two access points must somehow be connected over the wired 
network. Given that the benefit of wireless is avoiding wires, this option is 
cumbersome to set up. Figure 2-4 does show some overlap between the two 
access points, so that there is no dead zone between the two.
Multiple access points can also be helpful if an entire floor is inaccessible 
from the main access point. A repeater won’t work in your basement if the 

44
Dealing with Wired Devices
signal isn’t strong enough, and your only option might be to run a cable 
between two access points.
Dealing with Wired Devices
After all this talk about wireless, you still have to deal with some wires. You 
may have a PC or a video game console that doesn’t have a wireless adapter.
Consider replacing your computer with one that has built-in wireless capa­
bility. But if you can’t do that, you got three options: 
Wire it, upgrade it, or bridge it.
Wiring a computer
The first option is to simply embrace your device’s lack of wireless and run a 
cable from your router to computer. Your router probably has a switch built 
in, which is a device that’s there to provide several wired ports. Figure 2-5 
shows the switch ports on the back of a router.
	
Figure 2-5: 
Switch 
ports on the 
back of your 
router.
	
In theory, wiring a computer is easy. If your computer is in the same room as 
the router, then run a cable of appropriate length between the two devices, 
and you’re set. If your computer is in another room, you’ll have to think of 
the least disruptive way to get there. The cable simply plugs into one of the 
switch ports on the router on one end, and into the Ethernet port of your 
computer on the other.
	
Run the cable along the baseboard of your wall if you can, or under a strate­
gically placed rug. Avoid bare cable, it just looks bad and people tend to trip 
over them, especially when carrying fragile things. If you do have to drill, try 
to drill in closets to avoid an ugly mess.

Book II 
Chapter 2
Choosing Hardware
45
Dealing with Wired Devices
Speaking of cable, you want Ethernet cable rated at category 5e. You may 
also see category 6 cable or some fancy thing with connectors coated in pre­
cious metals, but for a home network you’d just be throwing your money 
away. Even better, find a friend with cabling experience to do the work for 
you in exchange for dinner.
Wiring up your computer works, but you bought a book on wireless net­
working, not wired networking. Unless your computer is really close to your 
router, avoid the mess and pick one of the other options.
Upgrading a computer
Most computers have some expansion slots that let you add peripherals, 
such as network cards, to your computer without having to buy a com­
pletely new computer. With this option, you go out and buy the appropriate 
adapter for your computer, and then install it.
The key here is to make sure that you’ve got the right adapter for your com­
puter. Computers are getting faster and smaller, and the expansion cards 
follow the trend.
Desktops
Desktop computers have two options, depending on the capabilities of your 
computer and how much work you feel like doing.
The traditional method is to install a PCI card (that’s peripheral compo­
nent interconnect, for those of you who need to know these things), which 
is a card that goes into specially designed slots right on the motherboard 
of your computer. The slots are aligned such that one edge of your card 
sticks outside your computer’s case, which allows for easy connection of an 
antenna. (Chapter 1 of this minibook shows a PCI-based network card.)
Most computers that you buy will have a free PCI slot, but the only way to 
make certain is to check. You should see at least one blank panel on the 
back of your computer (it’s about 4 inches high and slightly over half an inch 
wide). If you open your case, you can see an empty slot for the card.
Opening the case isn’t for everyone, and improvements in the Universal 
Serial Bus (USB) have made it possible to get the same speeds without the 
hassle. If your computer has a free USB 2.0 slot then you can buy a USB-
based card for around the same cost as an internal one.
Figure 2-6 shows the USB slot from a typical desktop computer.

46
Dealing with Wired Devices
	
Figure 2-6: 
USB slot on 
a desktop.
	
When buying an adapter for a desktop machine, be it USB or PCI, keep in 
mind where your computer is and where the antenna would be. An antenna 
that’s buried under a pile of books, or is stuck in a cabinet, will not per­
form as well as one that’s got room to breathe. I’d recommend an external 
antenna with a cable for PCI cards.
USB adapters are also used with laptops, so are often designed to be small. 
You can take a USB adapter with an integrated antenna and attach a USB 
extension cable to it if your desk layout hides the antenna. Your adapter 
might come with this cable — check the box to make sure.
Laptops
Laptops follow the same idea as desktops; however, the technologies are 
different. If your laptop doesn’t have wireless built in (or it’s an older tech­
nology and you want to update), then you can go down the USB route, or an 
adapter.
USB devices for laptops work the same way as they do on desktops, except 
that you want something that’s small and unobtrusive. Before you buy, look 
at where your USB ports are. If you dock your laptop, consider whether or 
not you need wireless while docked.
The other option for laptops is a peripheral card, much like the PCI card 
from a desktop. Laptops are a bit more refined, though; they have standard 
card types that plug into the side of the computer.

Book II 
Chapter 2
Choosing Hardware
47
Dealing with Wired Devices
There are currently two popular types of laptop cards — the PC Card (some­
times called CardBus) and the ExpressCard. ExpressCards are a newer (and 
by newer I mean faster) version of PC Cards. The name is also better, don’t 
you think?
Laptops have been shipping with ExpressCard since at least 2005, so chances 
are you already have an ExpressCard slot. You might also have a PC Card slot. 
The two types of cards are available in the same width (and not compatible), 
so it’s not obvious from looking which one you have.
If you look at the pins inside the slot for the card (you might need a flash­
light, and will certainly need to pop out the plastic holder), you find that PC 
Cards have a wide connector, almost 2 inches wide, and have protruding 
pins. The ExpressCard’s connector is slightly over an inch wide and has 
more of a card interface.
To make things even more confusing, ExpressCards come in two widths. One 
is the ExpressCard/34 which is slightly over an inch wide (34 millimeters for 
those of you who understand metric), and ExpressCard/54, which is about 
2 inches wide. The connector is the same, but you can’t use the 54mm card 
in a 34mm slot! There should be a plastic guide inside the slot, though, that 
allows you to use the 34mm card in the 54mm adapter. Figure 2-7 shows the 
two ExpressCard variants.

When in doubt, check out the documentation that came with your computer, 
especially the sales brochure.
Bridging a computer
Bridging is remarkably simple — you buy a device that speaks wireless on 
one side and has a network jack on the other. This device bridges the wire­
less to the wired, so that the computer thinks it’s on a wired network, but 
everything it sends goes out to the wireless network.
This option is great for video game consoles, where you may not have flex­
ibility in what you can add. Some models can behave as a bridge for use at 
home and a standalone access point if you and a bunch of friends decide to 
get together with your consoles or computers and play multiplayer games.

In This Chapter
✓	Unpacking your hardware
✓	Plugging equipment together
✓	Configuring your router
I
f you’re ready to set up your router, you likely have all the equipment 
you need. For most of you, this will be the most foreign part of the whole 
process. Don’t worry! In terms of difficulty, I rank this as easier than setting 
up a home entertainment system and slightly harder than falling off a log.
In this chapter, I discuss the router. If you bought some network adapters, 
you can set those aside for now. First, you get acquainted with the equip­
ment, and then I explain how to put it together and get it going!
For those of you with foggy memories, or who skipped ahead, the router is 
the device that connects your home network to the Internet. The router hides 
all your internal computers and acts as a firewall, which helps to protect you 
from the bad guys out there. Your router probably has wireless built in, so it’s 
going to take care of getting your wireless computers connected.
Unpacking the Box
Clear off a table and start unpacking the router box. You should see
	
✦	 A router (if you don’t see this, then pack everything up and take it back 
to the store)
	
✦	 A power supply
	
✦	 A network cable (3-inch to 6-inch long, with a square plug on each end)
	
✦	 CDs and documentation
	
✦	 Antennae, depending on the router you bought
Your box might come with some other goodies, such as a network card, if 
you bought a combination package, or some other odds and ends that the 
manufacturer threw in.

Figuring Out Where to Put the Router
Figuring Out Where to Put the Router
The router needs to be placed close to where your Internet service provider’s 
equipment (such as a cable modem or an ADSL modem) is located. Ideally, 
this area is as close to the center of your house as possible, to maximize the 
wireless range.
So, you’ve found a central location with a bit of breathing room for the 
router. It’s near a power outlet, and is out of the way enough that you’re not 
going to trip over it.
	
Grab some masking tape and a marker before you start setting things up. 
Tag your cables as you go along so that someone looking for a free outlet 
doesn’t pull your cable modem’s plug, or you don’t forget which port plugs 
into what, should they get separated.
Plugging Everything Together
Before you start hooking equipment up, throw together a quick picture of 
what you’re trying to build. Figure 3-1 shows an example of a network.
Starting on the left, you have your cable modem, which is probably already 
plugged into your phone or cable line. The cable modem hooks into the exter­
nal side of your router. Your router connects wirelessly to your workstations, 
and optionally through a wired interface to any devices that need it.
While you’re configuring your network, you can connect your PC to the 
router using an Ethernet cable. After you’ve set up the router, you can begin 
using your wireless network.
Handle with care
If your cable or DSL modem isn’t in a good spot, 
then you might consider moving it somewhere 
better.
Moving a cable modem means that you have 
to find another cable jack in the house and 
plug the cable modem into that jack. Be care­
ful, though, especially if you had someone from 
the cable company come out and set up your 
equipment. The installers for cable modems 
optimize your house wiring to give the best 
signal to the modem, so changing jacks might 
hurt your Internet speeds. Thankfully, you can 
just move things back if something goes wrong, 
or call your provider for a signal check if you’re 
unsure.
For ADSL setups, you can move your modem 
to any phone jack. You have to make sure that 
all the other phones in your house have a filter 
on them, which prevents noise from the phone 
from interfering with the Internet signal.

Connecting the router to the Internet
Your cable or DSL modem will have one Ethernet cable coming out the back of 
it. To help you find it, I’ve taken a picture of my cable modem in Figure 3-2. An 
Ethernet jack looks a lot like a regular telephone jack, except the Ethernet jack 
is wider than the phone jack.

52
Plugging Everything Together
Your router has several Ethernet jacks on it. Your router connects your 
internal network to the Internet. It’s expecting the Internet to be on a certain 
port. This port might be labeled:
	
✦	 Internet
	
✦	 Outside
	
✦	 WAN
	
✦	 External
Whatever it’s called, this port is marked differently than the other ports. 
	
1.	 Plug the router’s Internet port into your cable or DSL modem’s 
Ethernet port.
	
2.	 Hook up the power adapter to your router and give it a few minutes to 
get started. 
	
	 You should see lights on both your cable or DSL modem and the 
router, indicating that a connection was made. Sometimes the light 
is right underneath the port itself, sometimes it’s on the front of the 
device.
	
3.	 Unplug the power from your router until you’re ready to set it up.
	
When plugging in an Ethernet cable, it should click. Give the cable a gentle 
tug. It should not fall out of the port that it’s plugged in.
Plugging your computer into the router
Now that you’ve found the Internet port on the router, the inside ports 
should be pretty easy. They are likely numbered and in a group, possibly 
with a label like Ethernet.
Plug a cable from your computer’s Ethernet port into the first Ethernet port 
on the router. Now you should have something like Figure 3-3.
Congratulations, the hardest part is over! It’s time to configure the router.

Configuring the Router
With your router at default settings, you might be able to turn your router on 
and be on the Internet in a matter of minutes. Even if everything works for 
you, going through the configuration steps is a good idea. Doing so improves 
your security, you can upgrade your router’s software to the latest version, 
and you might even find it fun!
Depending on the router you buy, it may come with a CD that takes you 
through the configuration section. Feel free to use it, because they gener­
ally do a good job. You should still read through this section because it 
describes the settings you want to look at, and you may have to resort to the 
method we describe below.
I’m also using a Netgear router. If you have something different, the screens 
will look different but the process will be similar.
	
If you are having problems with a step here, jump over to Chapter 8 for some 
troubleshooting information.

54
Configuring the Router
Logging into the router
Your router is configured by using your Web browser by entering a URL 
pointing to the gateway. The URL you enter is either printed on the router 
or is in the manual that came with your router.
Maybe your dog ate your instruction manual before you got a chance to 
copy down the URL, and it’s not on your router. That’s fine — there’s a way 
to find it.
	
1.	 From the Windows Start menu, click on Run.
	
	 A pop-up box appears above the Start button, asking which program you 
want to run. 
	
2.	 Type in cmd and press the Enter key.
	
	 A black window opens. 
	
3.	 Type ipconfig and press the Enter key. 
	
	 I’ve pasted what I see.
Your window should look something like Figure 3-4. Look for the line starting 
with Default Gateway. The gateway is 192.168.1.1, which is the address of my 
router.
	
Figure 3-4: 
Determining 
your IP 
address and 
gateway.
	
If you don’t have an address, or it starts with 169.254, then make sure that 
your computer is properly connected to the router. You see a status light on 
both the router and the computer’s Ethernet port if you have a connection.
Whichever way you find it, open up your Web browser and enter the address 
of your router. On my Netgear router it is http://routerlogin.net, but 
it works just as well with http://192.168.1.1 that I learned earlier from 
the ipconfig command.
After connecting, you are challenged to log in, as shown in Figure 3-5.

The password is printed on the router or in the manual. You can also try a 
username of admin and a password of passwordfor many models.
	
If you lost your manual, the site www.routerpasswords.com has the 
default username and password for many models of routers.
After you’ve logged in, your router will probably check for software updates. 
If you are prompted to upgrade your router, you should do so. If you got an 
error that no Internet connection could be found, don’t panic! You might 
need to make the changes in the next section.
After the router upgrade completes, for better or worse, you are sent to the 
wizard (no, not the pointy hat kind! I mean the menus that help you set up 
your Internet connection).
Setting up the Internet connection
The first stage of the configuration wizard is the Internet setup. Figure 3-6 
shows the initial question that asks if you want the router to determine the 
Internet connection type.
Let the detection process proceed, because it can save you some time. After 
the detection runs, you are given an option to review your settings and to fill 
in any missing information about your Internet connection. Figure 3-7 shows 
the configuration screen for the Internet connection.

The Does Your Internet Connection Require A Login option is set to No. The

the Internet connection properly.
Do you need to log in?
Cable Internet generally doesn’t require a login. If you have ADSL, it depends 
on your provider. If your ISP gave you a username and password when you 
signed up, or if the detection failed, then you probably need a login. If you 
had to run software such as the WinPoET on your computer to get on the 
Internet, then you need a login.
If you do need a login, follow these steps.
	
1.	 Select Yes at the Does Your Internet Connection Require a Login 
question. 
	
	 Your screen changes to something such as Figure 3-8.
	
2.	 If your ISP is listed in the ISP section, select it. 
	
	 North American users typically use the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) 
protocol to log in, which means you select Other for your ISP. For those 
in Europe or Australia, you probably use PPTP (Point to Point Tunneling 
Protocol). When in doubt, call your ISP and ask.

4.	 Confirm you have an Internet address by selecting Router Status from 
the main menu. 
	
	 If all went well you see an address on the Internet port. The status light 
on the router corresponding to the Internet port also changes to green.
	
If you ran software on your PC to log in to your ISP, then you can uninstall it 
now. Your router is taking care of logging in for you.
Congratulations, you’re on the Internet!
Working with your ISP
Some Internet service providers are picky about who they let on the Internet 
and will not let you on from a different computer. This situation is most 
often the case with cable modems, because the ADSL service with a login 
identifies people by the login. From the ISP’s perspective, your router is now 
the only person using the Internet because all your local devices are hidden 
behind it.
The first thing to do is to reboot your cable modem. Doing this clears out any 
computer associations should the restriction be made on the cable modem.
If that doesn’t work, try plugging your computer directly into the cable 
modem (another reason I told you to label your cables!). If your computer 
works but the modem doesn’t, then you need your ISP to intervene.
Give your ISP a call and tell them that you just installed a new router and are 
having problems connecting. Ask if you’re being restricted based on your 
computer. Also let them know the outcome of plugging in the computer.
If you aren’t getting anywhere with your ISP, and your computer works but 
the router doesn’t, you can tell the router to act like your computer. Go back 
to the Basic Settings menu and scroll all the way to the bottom to the Router 
MAC Address section shown in Figure 3-9.
Increasing security
Security is a tradeoff between the risk of something bad happening and the 
frustration you’re going to encounter trying to prevent it. We could talk for 
hours about all the things you could do to keep bad guys out, but in the next 
couple of sections, I focus on some simple fixes that can make a big difference.
Remember, you’re never truly secure; all you can do is make your network 
hard enough to break into that the bad guys go somewhere else.

Changing the router login information
Most routers come with a default username and password of admin and 
password, respectively. Want to guess the first thing someone is going to 
try? That’s right . . . “password” is a good way to describe what the word is, 
but as a password, it makes a bad one.
Change that admin password!
The screen to change your password is found under the Set Password menu 
item, as shown in Figure 3-10. You are prompted for your old password, 
which is probably “password” in case you’ve forgot.
Here’s my advice for choosing a good password:
	
✦	 Make it at least 8 characters.
	
✦	 Put at least one number and one uppercase character in your password. 
Passwords are case-sensitive, so G and g are not the same.
	
✦	 Make it memorable, but not obvious. If your name is Sarah, you might 
try something like saraH500. Maybe you like cats, so try 100Meows.
	
✦	 Avoid too many letters that look the same, such a zero and a capital O, 
or the number 1 and a lowercase l.

60

Figure 3-10: 
Changing 
your

trator 
password.
	
Finally, write the password down and put it somewhere safe (and some­
where that you’ll remember). That’s right, I told you to write the password 
down! Doing this is often frowned upon, but think of it this way:
	
✦	 You’re not protecting Fort Knox, it’s your home network. That’s not 
saying your personal stuff isn’t important, but with a password that’s 
good enough, you’re still making it harder to get in. Remember that 
security is a tradeoff between safety and convenience.
	
✦	 You’re going to store the password somewhere safe, like a filing cabinet. 
You’re not going to tape a sign to your front window with the password 
on it.
	
✦	 Someone has to first get on your network before they’re going to be able 
to log in to the router. 
	
✦	 If you’re still paranoid, ignore my advice and make up a complex pass­
word. I won’t be offended, really.
Keeping others out of your network
If someone could connect to your wireless network, he can surf the Internet 
from your ISP. That’s not such a big deal, but you’re now responsible for 
what they do. If something bad happens, the police will track the perpetrator

Secondly, software is available that can intercept your network traffic. At 
best they see which Web sites you browse to, at worst they pretend to be 
your bank and rob you blind.
Protect your Network!
Figure 3-11 shows the Wireless Settings screen. At the top is the name of the 
wireless network called the SSID (Service Set Identifier). This makes your 
network unique. When you start off, it’s usually set to the name of the manu­
facturer, such as Linksys or Netgear. Not only is a default SSID a magnet for 
hackers, it could cause conflicts if your neighbor is at the defaults, too. This 
setting is not a secret, so choose something obvious enough that if you saw 
it in a list, you’d recognize it.
Leave the channel at Auto — your router will choose the best channel to use.
For the mode, pick one of the higher ones. The options I get are 45 Mbps, 145 
Mbps, and 300 Mbps. This is a wireless-N router, so it’s capable of the full 
300, but I’m in an area with some interference from neighbors so I dialed it 
back to 145. Try different settings and see which one works the best for you.
The security options dictate what sort of encryption level is used. None is 
the default and means that anyone can connect without a password. We 
know that’s a bad thing.

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is old and broken. Someone sitting outside 
your house could break your password in a matter of a few minutes. I’m not 
even sure why vendors bother offering it; only ancient computers don’t sup­
port anything better.
WPA and WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access versions 1 and 2, respectively) are 
the current standards. WPA2 is newer and somewhat better, but some com­
puters only support the original WPA. I recommend enabling both WPA and 
WPA2 — clients that support WPA2 will use it, and others will use WPA.
You see the box for the passphrase when you select one of the WPA options. 
A good password is the key to your network’s security. You can write it 
down, but this Netgear router leaves it as plain text so you can look it up 
easily. (You have changed the admin password for your router, right?)
Dispelling a couple of myths
Wireless has come a long way since it first came out, and people have 
learned a lot about security over the years. The following list explains what 
not to do. 
	
✦	 Don’t use WEP, use WPA2, or WPA if your computer doesn’t support 
WPA2.
	
✦	 Don’t bother with restricting clients by MAC address. These addresses 
can easily be spoofed by bad guys.
	
✦	 Don’t hide your SSID; you just make it harder on yourself, and it’s still 
easy for someone parked outside your house to find your SSID. Even the 
credit card companies have taken this restriction out of their require­
ments for businesses that take credit cards.

✓	Configuring your DHCP server

I
n Chapter 3, I explain how to set up your wireless router. And in Chapters 
6 and 7, you discover how to set up wireless printers, computers, and 
even network-attached storage. But, before you can do this, you must first 
find out about addressing — the topic of this chapter.
The Internet works because everything on it has a unique address, and the 
devices that run the Internet are very good at getting information between 
two addresses. Before your computers and printers are ready to talk on 
your network, you have to make sure they have an address.
There’s a protocol called DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, 
that not only is the way to automatically address the computers on your 
network, but knowing the acronym is a great way to impress your geek 
friends.
Later in the chapter, I go over other related services that might come in 
handy some day.
Understanding DHCP
To first understand DHCP, you must know a bit about addresses. The most 
popular analogy is the snail mail system.
Through rain, sleet, or snow
To send a letter, you first put your message in an envelope, then you write 
your return address on the corner of the envelope and your recipient’s 
address in the middle, and finally drop it in a mailbox. There’s a stamp 
involved in there, too, but the Internet doesn’t need stamps; they gum up 
all the gears.

64
Understanding DHCP
Someone comes by and empties all the mailboxes into a truck. Trucks are 
emptied into a collection center. The mail is sorted based on the destination: 
envelopes are sent on trucks or planes at a facility that’s closer to the desti­
nation, eventually working their way into a postal carrier’s bag and in your 
friend’s mailbox. 
Finally, we talk about Internet addresses
As I said earlier, each computer on the Internet has a unique address, 
which is a number instead of a street name. Each time data (such as an 
e-mail) is sent over the Internet, the data is wrapped in a packet that has 
the addresses of the sender and the receiver of the packet. The devices that 
run the Internet look at that destination address and get the packet one hop 
closer to its destination. The next hop device does the same thing until the 
final hop — the destination — processes the message.
Incidentally, those devices that run the Internet are called routers and are 
similar to the one you have at home. The major difference is that the rout­
ers that run the Internet are more powerful because they have a lot more 
addresses to deal with, and yours only needs to worry about the one that 
your ISP gave you.
So, what does an address look like? You already saw one in the last chapter, 
where you ran the Windows ipconfig command. My address was 192.168.1.2, 
and I could see that the router’s address on the wireless side was 
192.168.1.1. My router also had a second (external) address that the ISP gave 
it, such as 24.79.42.159, which belongs to the cable or DSL side. The router’s 
job is to send packets between these two networks, and it needs an address 
on each network to do that.
Hiding addresses
Earlier in this chapter, I said that every device 
on the Internet has a unique address. But you 
may have noticed that both your router and 
mine have an address of 192.168.1.1, which 
makes it not unique. What gives?
Your router also does something special called 
address translation. The networks starting 
with 192.168.x.x are meant to be private, that is, 
never seen on the Internet. Your router takes its 
address on the ISP side (such as 24.79.42.159, 
in my case) and uses that instead of your 
computer’s address (such as 192.168.1.2) when 
relaying your packets to the Internet. 
When responses come back, the destination 
is the router. The router remembers who was 
actually talking and changes the destination 
back to 192.168.1.2 or whoever was talking.
From your ISP’s perspective, there’s only one 
person using their service — your router. 
Clever, eh?

Deciphering DHCP

Understanding DHCP
I still remember my first job out of school, which involved managing a small 
network. About 40 computers were on the network, and every time I added a 
new one, I went to a spreadsheet, picked the next available address, made a 
note in the spreadsheet, and then set up the computer with that address.
Manually specifying addresses is time consuming and error prone. If two 
devices on the same network try to use the same address, neither of them 
can talk. Additionally, some of the possible addresses are invalid, and using 
one will cause problems on your network. Addressing is clearly a job for a 
computer, not humans.
DHCP solves these problems by letting a computer hand out the addresses. 
This computer keeps track of who has which address and periodically 
makes sure the addresses are still in use. DHCP is simple enough that it’s 
built into almost every router on the market, so you can probably start using 
DHCP right away.
At a high level, when your computer starts up, it sends a message to all the 
computers on the network that says “I need an address!” If there’s a DHCP 
server on the network, it finds a free address and responds with, “Here, have 
this address!” Your computer responds with, “Thanks!”
Sounds like a breeze, eh? Of course, it’s more complicated than that, but you 
don’t have to worry about the gory details. Understand, though, that DHCP 
is an ongoing thing. Your computer must periodically remind the router it’s 
still there, otherwise the router will reclaim the address for someone else. 
This usually happens every 12 to 24 hours and is handled automatically by 
your computer.
The last thing to remember is that it generally doesn’t matter what address 
your computer has, as long as all the rules are followed. DHCP makes sure 
you follow the rules, so it doesn’t matter if one day you’re 192.168.1.2 and 
when you boot up the next day you’re 192.168.1.50.
Your DHCP server
By default, your router almost certainly has DHCP turned on; otherwise, you 
wouldn’t have been able to connect to your router in the first place!
Jump over to the Advanced LAN settings of your router, which I’ve shown in 
Figure 4-1.
In Figure 4-1, you see that familiar 192.168.1.1 address, which is the IP 
address of the internal side of your router. That address stays constant 
even though the rest of the addresses on your network will be dynamic. The 
reason is that the computers need to find your router by its address in order 
to get out on the Internet.

66

Figure 4-1: 
Advanced 
LAN 
settings.
	
Don’t worry about the subnet mask; it just tells your computer how big the 
network can get (big enough). And that RIP stuff, pretend it’s not there.
What you’re really after is the configuration on the second half of LAN setup, 
starting with Use Router as DHCP Server. This option is selected, and it turns 
on and off the DHCP functionality. If for some reason you want to turn it off, 
you deselect this button and click Apply.
Underneath the DHCP on/off switch are two lines that let you set the range 
of addresses that DHCP uses. You can see that the first three boxes are 
grayed out, and they happen to have the same values as the IP address of 
the LAN interface. This is intentional; if you were to change one of those 
values, you’d be handing out invalid addresses.
You can only change the last value, which can be a number from 1 to 254. 
Number 1 is already taken by the router itself, so this router is already 
handing out the maximum number of addresses. These addresses start 
at 192.168.1.2 and go up to 192.168.1.254, for a total of 253 possible 
addresses. 
Underneath the starting and ending address fields is a place where you can 
reserve addresses for computers, so the same computer will always get the 
same address. Just hold on to that thought.

Chapter 4

Understanding DHCP
Turning off DHCP
After all that talk about the great things DHCP does, why would you want to 
turn it off? You probably don’t need to, but DHCP can get in your way. Int 
the following sections, I go over some ways to make your new life with DHCP 
work for the best.
Reserving your spot on the network
Sometimes you’ve got some software that needs you to do something called 
port forwarding. This means that the router is going to let some connections 
from the Internet directly into your computer. I’m not going to get into port 
forwarding in this book, but your software manual has more detailed instruc­
tions on what’s needed to make it work. Port forwarding needs an address 
on your network to which to forward the packet.
DHCP gives out addresses that can change. If your router is trying to send a 
packet to one address, and you’ve got a different one, what do you do? Turn 
off DHCP? No!
What if you could still use DHCP but be guaranteed the same known address 
all the time? No one else would be handed out that address. That’s called a 
reservation. You’re simply reserving the address from the DHCP server.
Go back to Advanced LAN Setup and click Add. A screen like the one shown 
in Figure 4-2 appears.
	
Figure 4-2: 
Adding 
a DHCP 
reservation.
	

68
Understanding DHCP
You need the IP address you want to give your machine, your computer’s 
MAC address, and your computer’s name to complete this form. MAC stands 
for Media Access Control, and it is part of a protocol that defines how net­
works work. It’s also something you’ll be able to forget about except for this 
one trick: To find out your MAC address, open a command window (Start➪ 
Run➪cmd) and then type ipconfig /all. Figure 4-3 shows the result.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Results of 
ipconfig /all.
	
Look for the line that says Physical Address. Mine is 00-18-DE-05-9C-15 Type 
that address in the MAC address field, along with your IP address and name, 
and click Add. Presto! That address is yours forever.
You may be noticing in Figure 4-2 that my MAC is listed right above the field. 
In fact, if you click the radio button on the left side of that table, it’ll even be 
prefilled in the form, effectively letting you make any dynamic address per­
manent with two clicks.
	
It’s good to know how to reserve an address the long way, because not all 
routers support that shortcut. 
Just give me static!
In the context of computers, static electricity is usually bad. Static addresses, 
though, aren’t. Sure, they’re harder to manage, but if only there were some 
way we could make them work without having to turn off DHCP.
This one is fairly easy to solve. When looking at the DHCP configuration, 
you saw that you could change the range of DHCP assigned addresses. 
Change it to give some space on one side, such as lowering the upper limit 
to 199. DHCP still offers addresses from 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.199, and 
anyone that wants to put their address in manually can use 192.168.1.200 to 
192.168.1.254.
Some network-attached printers don’t understand DHCP and need to be 
addressed statically. The same goes for much older computers, especially 
computers designed to be servers and not for daily personal use. Fair 
enough, just give them an address in your static range.

Book II 
Chapter 4
Deciphering DHCP
69
Understanding DHCP
	
If you do break out a separate area for statically addressed machines, it’s a 
good idea to make a note of it somewhere.
DHCP, get out of my hair!
Sometimes you just want to turn off DHCP. You only want one DHCP server 
on your home network. If you have another device that’s doing the job of 
DHCP and you plug in your device, then you’ll have two devices handing out 
addresses. 
DHCP is so simple that most devices come with it turned on. As you add 
more pieces to your network, you’ll probably come across the situation 
where you get two DHCP servers. Make sure to turn that second (or third, or 
fourth) server off.
As a case in point, these combination router–access point–switch devices 
are roughly the same price as an access point, so you might just come 
home one day with a second router to expand your new wireless network. 
Configure wireless, turn off DHCP, and give the new router a different static 
address, and you can plug it into the rest of your network as if it were an 
access point. Just remember to leave the Internet port unplugged, because 
your first router is providing the path out to the Internet, and the new one is 
bridging your computer between the wireless and wired inside networks.
But wait, there’s more!
Looking back at the results of ipconfig /all from Figure 4-3, a bunch of other 
information is there. Most of it isn’t that noteworthy, but tI discuss two in 
the following sections. 
Default gateway
The Internet is one big game of Hot Potato. One guy throws his packet to a 
router, who throws it to the next router down the line, all the way until it lands 
at its destination. To join in, you have to know where to throw your packet.
Your default gateway is the place that your computer sends all the packets 
it doesn’t know what to do with (for people on your local network, you can 
talk directly to them). DHCP tells you the address of your gateway when 
handing out the address. You can see that this address is 192.168.1.1, which 
is your router.
Without a default gateway, you’re not going to get on the Internet.
DNS servers
This chapter has talked a lot about addresses like 192.168.1.1, but you’ve 
probably never typed one into your browser. You’ve always typed URLs like 
http://example.com/, right?

70
Understanding DHCP
DNS, the Domain Name System, is what translates those names that you 
understand into the numbers that computers understand. It’s like the phone 
book of the Internet.
Most routers make themselves the DNS server and relay your requests to 
your ISP’s DNS servers. Sometimes they just tell you to talk to your ISP’s 
name servers directly by handing out those addresses. Either way is good.
The funny thing about DNS is that you can be connected to the Internet, 
but without DNS, you’ll get nothing but errors when you try to do anything. 
That’s because your computer has no way to figure out how to convert the 
names to IP addresses, and you probably don’t know the addresses off the 
top of your head, either. The address is required for your computer to con­
nect to your destination, such as a Web server: a name won’t cut it. 
Troubleshooting DHCP
If you get an address through DHCP, then DHCP is working great. It’s pretty 
simple that way.
With DHCP, you usually don’t end up without an address. If there’s a prob­
lem, your computer will assign itself an address starting with 169.254, which 
is called the autoconfigure address range. This address isn’t helpful, because 
it’s not one of yours and therefore can’t be used to talk to the Internet.
If you get this autoconfigure address, then make sure you’re within range 
of your access point. Sometimes you get enough strength from the wireless 
signal to see the other side, but not enough to have any meaningful con­
versation, such as the whole, “Hey, I need an address” song and dance that 
starts things off.
Other times, the problem is related to your wireless drivers, especially if 
you’re trying to get equipment from two different vendors to play nicely 
together. You need to check to see if you can hookup using a wired connec­
tion, and download some updated drivers.
Of course, if you’ve turned off DHCP on your network, or never had it in the 
first place, you’ll see a lot of those 169.254.x.x addresses until you set up a 
static address or turn on DHCP.

A
fter your wireless router is up and running, you are ready to install 
the wireless network adapters. Unless you were fortunate enough to 
have wireless functionality built into your computer, you’re going to have to 
plug something into your computer so that you can get on the wireless net­
work. That something is a wireless adapter, and they come in all shapes and 
sizes. In this chapter, you find out how to install different kinds of network 
adapters.
Installing a USB Adapter
USB adapters can be used in both laptops and desktops. Some USB adapters 
are sleek, little numbers that are designed to be unobtrusive in a laptop, and 
some are larger but flatter and are designed to be hidden on a desk. They’re 
easy to install in either case, which is why we’re looking at them first.
The USB adapter I’ve been working with is from NETGEAR and is of the 
laptop variety. However, it includes a USB extension cable and a simple 
bracket designed to be Velcroed to the wall, so it’ll work equally well on a 
desktop. Have a look at Figure 5-1 to see what I mean.
A spare USB port is, of course, a prerequisite for a USB adapter. If you have 
USB ports but none are free, consider an inexpensive USB hub that splits 
one port into four (or more). If your computer doesn’t have USB, the only 
way to get a port would be to add a PCI expansion card.
USB devices are hot swappable, meaning you can insert and remove them 
without powering down your computer. Be careful about the removal part, 
though; if you’re storing anything on the USB device, it might get lost unless 
shut down properly!

Installing the drivers first
As magical as it might seem, your computer needs to be told how to do 
everything through software. You’re probably familiar with installing appli­
cation software such as a word processor, spreadsheet, or games. Another 
class of software is called drivers, which are smaller pieces of code that tell 
Windows how to work with hardware. Chances are the piece of equipment 
you just bought came out after Microsoft released your version of the oper­
ating system, so Windows probably doesn’t know how to deal with your new 
card without the right drivers.
In some cases the hardware is generic enough that Windows will work fine 
using its default set of drivers. If the hardware I’m installing includes its 
own drivers, I always use those. Vendor-supplied drivers are going to have 
the latest fixes and are usually faster than a generic version. After all, if the 
vendor made the hardware, I trust its drivers.
When installing the vendor’s drivers, you usually get the opportunity to 
install the vendor’s wireless management software, which is much better 
than the software built into Windows. It’s a win-win situation.

7.	 After you agree not to engage in any radio warfare, you’re asked if 
you want to use the built-in Windows configuration (Figure 5-5) or to

always install the vendor’s, so select that option and click Next.
Understanding legal restrictions
Despite the various 802.11 standards being 
agreed upon internationally, some federal gov­
ernments have slightly different limits on which 
frequencies can be used. As a result you get 
some oddities where some of the higher 2.4 
GHz frequencies are legal in Japan, but not 
the United States, so they get a couple of extra 
channels than us.
If you’re prompted with a legal message like the 
above, it’s best just to fill in the proper country 
and rely on the software you just installed to 
know which frequencies can be used.

At this point your wireless card is installed and ready to go. If you continue 
along with the wizard, you’ll be able to get online right away. I’m going to 
stop here and pick it up again in Chapter 6, though.
Plug in the adapter
Identify the USB port on the back of your computer and plug in the USB 
adapter (or the cable, if you’re using the cable.) It should take only slight 
pressure, so if it’s not going in right, try flipping the adapter over. If you 
think pliers might solve your problem, you’re probably wrong.
Figure 5-6 shows me plugging in the cable to a USB port on my desktop.
Your computer will probably emit a satisfying beep indicating the adapter 
was inserted correctly, and then you’re off to the races. The next chapter 
tells you how to log in to your wireless network.
Using USB
USB is a pretty nice technology. You can pull the adapter from one computer 
and move it to another if you want, or only have it plugged in when you need 
to use wireless (like any peripheral, a USB wireless adapter uses power even 
when you’re not using it).
	
Keep in mind that if you move the adapter from one computer to another, 
you need to install the drivers on both computers, but only once. The con­
figuration is stored on the computer, not the adapter, so you’ll have to set 
up the wireless networks separately.

Finally, be careful! Although the adapter is pretty resilient, after you plug 
it into the computer it’s not too happy being pulled at or bent. If there’s a 
downside to USB, it’s that it sticks out of the side of your computer. People 
who worry about bashing their adapter might be wise to use the desktop 
adapter and stick it to their monitor; the worst that happens is the cable 
breaks.

Laptop users have another option called PCMCIA cards, PC Cards, or 
ExpressCards. PCMCIA stands for the Personal Computer Memory Card 
International Association, though I always remember it as “People can’t 
memorize computer industry acronyms.”
ExpressCards are the newer standard, and replace PC Cards. Depending on 
how old your computer is, you may have one of each or only ExpressCard 
slots. Either way, these cards slide inside the base of your laptop, leaving 
only an antenna sticking out.

PC Cards might also be a good choice for older laptops with the slower USB 
1.1 ports, which run a lot slower than the PC Card interface.
The D-Link DWL-G630 card I’m using here follows a similar setup process to 
the other hardware we’ve looked at.
	
1.	 Make sure your PC Card isn’t plugged in. Just like the USB installation 
procedure, you install the drivers before the card.
	
2.	 Start the installation program by inserting the CD that came with the 
card into your CD drive.
	
3.	 Click Next.
	
	 A dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7.
	
Figure 5-7: 
The D-Link

4.	 Insert the PC Card into one of the slots in the side of your computer, 
like in Figure 5-8.
	
	 Do this gently because you don’t want to bend any pins inside your 
computer. If the card doesn’t fit, check to see if you are trying to plug an 
older PCMCIA card into an ExpressCard slot (you will see a small piece 
of plastic inside the slot which is designed to prevent you from plug­
ging the wrong type of card). A hardware detection dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 5-9.
	
5.	 Select Cancel to return back to the manufacturer’s installation process.
	
	 You may see a screen like the one shown in Figure 5-10 that indicates 
that the driver hasn’t passed logo testing.
	
6.	 You are using the manufacturer’s driver, so you can safely select 
Continue Anyway.
	
7.	 Wait while your computer installs the software.
	
8.	 After the installation quits, click the Exit button to exit the process.
	
9.	 Reboot your computer with the wireless card still inside.

PCI Cards are a reliable way of getting a desktop onto the wireless network. 
To add a new card to your machine’s motherboard, you must open up your 
PC. After everything’s closed up, the network card becomes a permanent 
part of your computer. The PCI Card has no risk of getting unhooked acci­
dentally, lost, or having coffee spilled on it. Well, maybe you’re not safe from 
the coffee, but I think you get my drift.
Going over some ground rules
You’re going to be opening up your computer and working inside it. I’d sug­
gest it’s turned off while you do that. No, actually, I insist that your computer 
is turned off while you work inside it. Humans and electricity don’t mix well.
Like a fuzzy cat, you’re a natural collector of electric charge in the form of 
electrons. Collect enough electrons by shuffling your feet on carpet, rubbing a 
sweater against other items, or just picking a bad day to work, and you can turn 
those excess electrons into lightning bolts known as static electric shocks.
Those lightning bolts find their way to ground through the most efficient 
path possible, and all those electronics in your case provide such a path. 
The problem is that your computer is made to run on 12 volts, and those 
shocks that you’re throwing around like Zeus run in the tens of thousands. 
Shock the wrong part and you’ll be an unhappy computer owner.
Fortunately, protecting yourself while working inside your computer is quite 
easy. Follow these suggestions:
	
✦	 Don’t wear a heavy sweater, sweat pants, or dangly jewelry.
	
✦	 Keep all parts in their protective bags until you need them.

80
Cracking Open That Case!
	
✦	 Keep a hand on the computer case at all times to ground yourself.
	
✦	 Get your tools ready in advance so that you’re not building up charge as 
you run around the house.
	
✦	 Hold on to cards by the edges and don’t touch the contacts or 
components.
Also, keep a small dish handy to hold any screws you might have to remove. 
That’s got nothing to do with static electricity — those screws are small!
Installing the drivers
Just like the other devices we installed, you want to install the CD that came 
with the card before actually installing the card. It’s remarkably similar to the 
USB and PC Card procedure; in fact, it’s so similar that I’m just going to point 
you back to Step 2 in the previous section instead of reproducing it here.
Opening the case
Unplug everything from your computer’s case and put it on your desk. The 
goal here is to separate the lid from the rest of the computer so that you can 
access the components inside.
Every computer is different, though. Rest the computer on its feet and 
have the buttons facing you. Look on the sides of the computer for buttons 
that you can push in to release the top. Push these in while rotating the lid 
upward, and it should open like a clam.
Failing that, look at the back of your computer for screws that hold the lid to 
the rest of the chassis. Some computers require that you turn a thumbscrew 
to release the lid, which slides back to reveal the parts inside.
Figure 5-11 is what my computer looks like. The button visible on the side 
releases the back of the cover, which swings upward to reveal the inside.
Accessing the PCI slots
Figure 5-12 shows the edge of the wireless card. This is a standard PCI card 
(Peripheral Component Interconnect) that you can use to expand your com­
puter.
	
1.	 Peer into you open computer case and look for some slots that would 
fit this card.
	
	 You should see between two and five in parallel against the back edge of 
your computer. Some computer designs have a riser board that comes 
out of the computer’s motherboard at a 90 degree angle.

	 Figure 5-13 shows the PCI slots in my desktop. You may see slots that 
look similar but are offset somewhat. These are generally not PCI, and 
you want to avoid them.

2.	 Notice that the case of the computer has openings to the outside but 
are probably covered up at this point (you can see such an opening 
back in Figure 5-13).
	
	 When properly plugged in, one edge of the PCI card shows to the out­
side of the computer through one of these openings. Take a moment to 
figure out which PCI slot you’re going to use and which opening on the 
case corresponds to that slot. The two don’t line up perfectly, though, 
so you can use your card as a guide to figure out which port is to be 
used.
	
3.	 Depending on your computer, you might have to undo a screw on the 
case to allow the card to go in. You replace the screw later to hold the 
card down. You may also have to punch out part of the case to make 
room for the card — be careful! Other computers might use a clamp 
mechanism to hold down all the PCI cards at once.
	
4.	 Gently line up the PCI card with the slot, and then make sure it’s 
straight against the case so that the connectors on the card show 
through the outside.
	
	 Figure 5-14 shows the card all ready to go.

5.	 Push down with your fingers on the edge of the card until the card is 
properly seated.
	
	 The card should be level in the case, that is, both sides of the connectors 
should be in the slots to the same depth. The edge of the card that shows 
outside the computer should also be seated snugly against the case, with 
the notched edge flush with the case and ready to be fastened.
	
6.	 Screw the card down to the case or replace the clamp as appropriate.
	
	 Take a last look for forgotten tools and replace the top of the case.
Attaching the antenna
You will see some connectors protruding from your wireless card when 
looking at the back of your computer, as in Figure 5-15. Screw the connec­
tors from the antenna onto those connectors. Make sure they fit snuggly, 
but hand-tighten only, please. Your card might indicate which cables go to 
which ports, so follow those directions. In the Linksys PCI card I’m using, 
the middle port is marked in blue, but it corresponds to a blue tag on the 
antenna cable. The other two ports can go in any order.

84

Finally, put your computer back in its spot and hook up all the cables. Make 
sure the antenna cord is free of the other cords, and put the antenna some­
where where it will be unobstructed. That’s it!
By now you’ve got your USB or PCMCIA network adapter plugged into your 
laptop and the drivers installed. If you’re a desktop person, then you’ve con­
quered your computer’s case and installed a PCI card, or you took the USB 
route.
Either way, you’ve got a functioning network card and a wireless network 
that’s just begging to be used. The next chapter looks at getting your com­
puter online.

Chapter 6: Getting Your 
PC On the Net
In This Chapter
✓	Configuring Windows XP and Vista
✓	Using your wireless utilities
✓	Measuring your signal strength
✓	Using your laptop on the road
T
his chapter covers how to get your computer on a wireless network. 
First, you take a look at how to configure a wireless network within 
Windows XP without the benefit of your wireless utilities. Sometimes those 
utilities just don’t work as well as you’d like, and you have to resort to the 
old standard.
After looking at using the default wireless configuration, you see how life 
can be made easier by using the manufacturer’s utilities. For those that are 
still running Windows 2000 or earlier, you need to use the manufacturer’s 
utilities in any case.
Vista is the latest release from Microsoft, so after looking at Windows XP, 
you find out how wireless is configured in Vista. A lot has changed in Vista, 
so it’s worthwhile looking at it separately.
Finally, you discover what else you can see in the wireless world. If you’re 
ever on the road, this information can come in handy, because you’ll have 
to find a different network to connect to.
Configuring Windows XP
Before you can configure wireless networking in Windows XP, you need to 
find out some information about the network you’re currently connected to. 
You may think that I’m putting the cart before the horse, but knowing what 
a properly configured network looks like makes it easier to follow along 
when configuring your own network.
Microsoft developed the Wireless Zero Configuration system (WZC) short) 
for configuring wireless inside Windows XP. The name implies that there’s 
no configuration for you to do; unfortunately, that’s not necessarily true. 

86
Configuring Windows XP
You put a password on your wireless network, so you know that at some 
point you’ll have to type it in. But WZC for short tries to make most of the 
other choices on your behalf.
Figuring out if you are connected
The system tray, way down in the bottom right of your screen, contains a 
bunch of icons that give you both a status indicator of some aspect of your 
system as well a quick way to access options.
Figure 6-1 shows my system tray when I’m connected to the wireless net­
work. The icon of the computer with the radio waves refers to wireless net­
work adapter.
	
Figure 6-1: 
Hovering 
over the 
network 
icon shows 
the network 
status.
	
If a red X shows, you know that you aren’t connected to your wireless net­
work. But if an X does not appear, you know you must be connected to some 
network. Hovering the mouse over the icon brings up the network status. 
From there, you can find out some information, such as
	
✦	 This computer is connected to the myhome network.
	
✦	 The connection speed is 54 Mbps (Wireless G or A).
	
✦	 The signal strength is excellent, which is the best you can get.
	
✦	 The computer is connected to the network (but you already knew that!).
	
The example in this section shows a signal strength of excellent. Other 
options are very good, good, low, and very low. As you can imagine, those 
are fairly subjective. I look at some better ways to measure the strength but 
in the meantime shoot for excellent through good.
Checking status
That information from the hover was nice, but you can find more help by 
clicking your mouse a few more times.

Book II
Chapter 6
Getting Your PC 
On the Net
87
Configuring Windows XP
Right-click on the wireless adapter icon in the system tray and select Status. 
Something like Figure 6-2 appears.
	
Figure 6-2: 
The Status 
page for a 
wireless 
network 
adapter.
	
At the very top you see two tabs, General and Support. The General tab 
gives a lot more information than you had before. You can see the status, 
name, and connection speed of the network. The duration tells you how long 
you’ve been connected, and instead of the nondescript signal strength, you 
get a display from 0 to 5 bars (which really maps to the same scale as before, 
but looks a lot nicer!).
In the section marked Activity, you can get an idea of how much data you’ve 
sent and received. The actual numbers aren’t important, other than for 
curiosity’s sake, but sometimes you want to make sure that you’re able to 
transmit and receive. If your computer is supposed to be working, but the 
received packets counter isn’t increasing, you are having a problem receiv­
ing data.
The final point of interest on this tab is the three buttons along the bottom 
(right above the Close button, which closes the window, and is not at all 
interesting). You’ve got three options here that you can use later:
	
✦	 Properties: This button takes you to the adapter’s property configura­
tion window, which has everything from IP addressing to firewalls.
	
✦	 Disable: Pressing this button disables your adapter and then changes to 
an Enable button. Pressing the button again re-enables the adapter.

88
Configuring Windows XP
	
✦	 View Wireless Networks: You use this later to show all the wireless net­
works that your computer can see. You can then pick the one that you 
want to connect to.
The Support tab, shown in Figure 6-3 has more information about your 
connection.
	
Figure 6-3: 
The Support 
tab within 
the Wireless 
Network 
Connection 
Status page.
	
The Support tab shows you your IP address, mask, and gateway. Recall from 
Chapter 4 that if you see an IP address starting with 169.254 that something 
is wrong with your computer or network, because those addresses are only 
used when DHCP fails to work.
You can click on the Details button to get even more details, but usually 
knowing your IP address is enough.
	
The most important button on this page is the Repair button. If you click this 
button, Windows disables your adapter, re-enables it, and then goes through 
the connection sequence again. Often, if everything else looks right but 
things still aren’t working, using the Repair button fixes the problem.
Configuring wireless, the zero configuration way
Ideally, Windows will take care of all the technical details behind wireless 
configuration. All you need to know is the name of the network and the 
password.

Configuring Windows XP
With that in mind, open up a list of the available wireless networks. You 
get there either by right-clicking on the adapter icon in the system tray and 
selecting View Available Wireless Networks or by double-clicking on the 
same icon and pressing the button marked View Wireless Networks. Either 
way you go, you see a dialog box as in the one shown in Figure 6-4.
	
Figure 6-4: 
The list of 
available 
networks.
	
When you pull up the list of available networks, your computer stops trans­
mitting and receiving on the wireless network and starts listening for any 
networks that might be in range. This list is then displayed to you.
Several pieces of information in Figure 6-4 help to find the right network 
to connect to. First, the SSID (Service Set Identifier) is displayed in bold. 
The SSID is the technical term for the name of the network. Here I can see 
renfrew, which is the name of the network I configured earlier on. Off to the 
right is the now-familiar signal strength icon. Along the bottom of each row 
is a description of the type of security the network uses. Anything with a 
padlock requires a password to join. The text to the right of the padlock 
describes the exact protection being used, which Windows takes care of on 
your behalf.
Finally, the gold star on the rightmost side of some rows indicates that this is 
a so-called preferred network. A preferred network is one that Windows will 
automatically try and connect to. In addition to the star is a behavior, such as 
Connected for the network you’re currently connected to, and Automatic for 
networks that Windows has been told to automatically connect to.
If you think that a network should be on the list, but it isn’t, click the Refresh 
network list under Network Tasks.

90
Configuring Windows XP
Joining the network
Join the network you want by double-clicking on the row for that network. If 
the network is secured then you are prompted for a password.
In the dialog box shown in Figure 6-5, you must enter the same password 
you entered when you configured WPA protection on your router. Type the 
password twice and click the Connect button. After you’ve connected to the 
network, you are returned to the list of available networks.
	
Figure 6-5: 
Entering 
the network 
key.
	
You’re connected now — congratulations! You can confirm this by noting 
that the word Connected appears next to your network in the list of wireless 
networks or by hovering your mouse over the network icon in the system 
tray.
Configuring wireless, the longer way
Sometimes the network you’re connecting to doesn’t advertise its existence, 
even though it’s still there. This is often the case at businesses, where at one 
point in time, hiding your wireless network was considered a security bonus.
Hiding your network doesn’t solve any security problems; all it does is make 
it slightly harder to connect.
	
If you’re playing around as you go, you might find a faster way of getting to 
certain menus than the way I’m showing you — which is great! I’m showing 
you the foolproof one.
Follow these steps to connect to a network when you know its configuration 
but don’t see it in your list of available wireless networks:
	
1.	 Right-click on the wireless adapter icon in your system tray and select 
View Available Wireless Networks.
	
2.	 Select Change Advanced Settings.
	
	 The Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog opens.

3.	 Select the Wireless Networks tab shown in Figure 6-6.

	 This dialog is used to manage all the preferred networks.
	
4.	 Create a new profile by clicking Add, which is found at the bottom of 
the window.
	
	 The window shown in Figure 6-7 pops up has three tabs: Association, 
Authentication, and Connection. Most of the work is in the first tab; in 
fact, we’re just going to glance at the last two.
	
Figure 6-7:

92
Configuring Windows XP
	
5.	 In the Association tab, type the SSID of the network you’re trying to 
connect to, which is the same as the name of the network.
	
	 This value is case sensitive, so “myhome” is different than “MYHOME” 
and “MyHome.”
	
6.	 Make sure the Connect Even If This Network Is Not Broadcasting 
checkbox is selected.
	
	 This option is important for networks that are hidden. Checking this 
option tells Windows to actively look for the network rather than waiting 
to hear the network announce itself.
	
	 The Wireless network key section is the trickiest part. If you set up 
your network following the instructions earlier on, you will be using 
WPA2-PSK authentication and AES data encryption. Make sure to choose 
WPA2-PSK and not WPA2! The PSK means Pre-Shared Key, which refers 
to the password you set up on your router. The non PSK version is used 
in enterprise networks where you are authenticating against a directory 
server.
	
7.	 Type the network password in the section that asks for the network 
key. Confirm this value in the next line.
	
	 If you are unsure of this information, plug back into your router and 
make sure. It’ll save a lot of frustration later.
	
8.	 Make sure that the This Is a Computer-to-Computer Network checkbox 
is not selected.
	
	 Figure 6-8 shows a dialog that’s been filled out. In the Authentication tab, 
everything should be grayed out if you are using WPA2-PSK or WPA-PSK.

9.	 In the Connection tab, make sure that the Connect When This Network 
Is In Range checkbox is selected.
	
	 If you don’t have a WPA2-PSK option, then your computer’s software 
might be out of date. Upgrade Windows XP to at least Service Pack 2, 
which includes WPA2 support. Alternatively, search http://microsoft.
com for KB893357, which is the patch that provides WPA2.
	
10.	 Click the OK button to exit the configuration and then click OK again 
to exit the properties window.
	
	 If you have configured the network correctly, and the network is within 
range, Windows connects.
Managing your preferred networks
A computer can only be connected to one wireless network at a time. 
Sometimes, you run into a situation where your computer can see two net­
works that it knows how to log into, and the computer must decide which 
network to log into. You control this decision by ordering your preferred 
networks. Windows chooses the network that’s highest on the list.
	
If you ever connect to a default network like NETGEAR, D-link, or Linksys, 
make sure that you move it down to the bottom of your list of preferred 
networks. Your computer doesn’t know the difference between the network 
you connected to at the coffee shop and your neighbor’s insecure wireless 
network, because all it has to go on is the name. With the defaults at the 
bottom, you avoid the embarrassing situation where you connect to your 
neighbor’s network when you should be connecting to your own.
Go back to the Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog by right-
clicking on the wireless adapter in the system tray, selecting View Available 
Wireless Networks, and then Change Advanced Settings. Figure 6-6 shows 
this dialog. Look at the Preferred Networks section. You can select any net­
work and move it up or down using the appropriate buttons on the right. If 
you want to view the connection’s settings, highlight the name of the net­
work and click on the Properties button.
You may adjust the priority of any network you have used, no matter if you 
configured it manually or let Windows set it up for you.
Using Wireless Utilities
The Windows Zero Configuration method isn’t too difficult, but you need to do 
a lot of clicking to find what you want. Wireless support in Windows XP was 
almost an afterthought, so it’s no surprise that there are some annoyances.

94
Using Wireless Utilities
Modern network adapters come with a utility for managing the network 
connections which takes over from Windows Zero Configuration. You must 
choose to use one or the other — both cannot be active at once. The wire­
less utility from the manufacturer has its own configuration database, mean­
ing that if you switch back to WZC at some point, you lose all your settings.
Still, I prefer to use the manufacturer’s utility because it usually has a nicer 
interface and often provides more troubleshooting tools than does Windows.
If you are running an earlier version of Windows, such as Windows 2000 or 
Windows95, then you’re pretty much stuck with using the manufacturer’s 
utility.
Finding a network
Just like the WZC procedure, you connect to a network by picking it from the 
list of available networks.
	
I’m using a NETGEAR USB adapter and the associated utility called the 
NETGEAR Smart Wizard. If you’re using a different adapter, your screens are 
going to be different. Most of the utilities are similar, so just click around 
until you find what I’m talking about.
To find a network, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the utility by finding it from your Start menu, or by double-click­
ing the icon in the system tray.
	
	 I’m not talking about the Windows network adapter icon, but the new 
icon that was created when the software was installed.
	
2.	 Select the Networks tab to see the list of available networks.
	
	 The NETGEAR utility is the only one I’ve used in which I had to click on 
a tab to get to the list of networks; all the other ones started off at that 
screen. The screen is shown in Figure 6-9.
	
	 You get a list of all the available networks, along with an indication of 
what wireless standard is used, the security mode, and the strength 
as measured by a percentage. The column marked N indicates 802.11n 
capable networks.
	
3.	 Double-click on your SSID (linksys in this case), which brings up the 
dialog box you see in Figure 6-10.
	
	 Wi-Fi Protected Set up (WPS) is a simplified method of connecting to 
wireless networks. Rather than typing in passwords and any other secu­
rity settings, a different approach is used. A WPS capable router has a 
PIN number printed on it, a WPS button, or both. If you supply the PIN

during the connection, then your computer can negotiate the shared 
secret directly with the router. Alternatively, you can press the WPS 
button on the router, which puts it in a mode ready to pair up with your 
computer.

then prompts again to see if the router has a push button.
	
5.	 The router does indeed have a push button, so click Yes.
	
	 The next screen, shown in Figure 6-12, asks you to press that button.

tings. All you need to do is press a button or read a PIN off a sticker.
Configuring Vista
Microsoft’s Vista operating system came several years after Windows XP, 
and Microsoft decided that they should build wireless support in from the 
ground up. As such, wireless configuration is much smoother in Vista than it 
is in XP.

97
Configuring Vista
Rather than choosing between using Windows for configuration or the 
manufacturer’s utilities, Vista integrates the two. You are free to use either 
approach because the two integrate with each other. Because of this inte­
gration, Microsoft has changed the technology’s name from Wireless Zero 
Configuration to Native Wi-Fi.
Listing available networks
Start off by displaying the list of available networks. To do so, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	 Click Start and then click Connect To.
	
	 You get a familiar-looking window showing the list of available networks, 
as shown in Figure 6-13.
	
Figure 6-13: 
Vista’s list 
of wireless 
networks.
	
	
	 Just like the Windows XP version, you can see the name of the network, 
a signal strength, and a list of the security measures used on the 
network.
	
2.	 Double-click on the network you want, and if it’s a secure network, 
you’ll be prompted for the password just as in Figure 6-14.
	
	 Note that this time around, you only have to type in the password once. 
If you select the Display characters button, then everything you type will 
be echoed to the screen instead of just displaying stars.

3.	 Click OK to save the connection and have it start automatically.
	
	 Vista introduces more security features, one of which requires you to 
assign a context to a network connection. After you have connected to 
a network, you are prompted to assign a location, which you can see in 
Figure 6-15.

	 You have three options:
 
• Home: You are using this on a private network, such as at home. 
Your computer can be discovered on the network, and firewall 
restrictions are somewhat relaxed.
 
• Work: You are using this connection at work, where your computer 
is managed by an IT department. This location is virtually identical 
to the Home location, except that the firewall is further tuned to 
allow management connections in.
 
• Public location: You are using your computer in an untrusted net­
work that’s outside your control. The computer will be hidden, and 
the firewall is very restrictive. The shields are up, and phasers are 
set to kill!
	
4.	 Select the Home option.
Confirming and changing settings
Figure 6-16 shows the Vista system tray. Look at the picture of the two com­
puters with the globe. The icon indicates you are connected to a network 
(otherwise there would be a red X on top), and the globe indicates that you 
have a path to the Internet through this connection.
	
Figure 6-16: 
The Vista 
system tray.
	
Hovering over this icon gives even more details. From the box that appears, 
you can see that this computer is connected to the renfrew network and has 
access to both the local network and the Internet. The house to the left tells 
you that the security location is Home. Finally, the signal strength is four 
bars out of five, otherwise known as Very Good.
To the Control Panel!
Launch the Control Panel by choosing Start➪Control Panel. Then choose 
Network and Internet➪Network and Sharing Center. (If you haven’t noticed 
by now, everything in Vista seems much cleaner than before, just harder 
to find!)
The Network and Sharing Center is shown in Figure 6-17. Along the top you 
can see the same information you learned from the icon in the system tray. 
The bottom half shows you all the security settings. In Figure 6-17, you can 
see that this machine is configured for very limited sharing. You may click 
on each row to change the setting.

buttons to achieve the same thing). The Add button adds a network in much 
the same way that Windows XP does it.
But what’s my address?
Our final stop in the Vista configuration is to find your network informa­
tion, which is helpful to know if you ever call your service provider for help. 
From the Network Sharing Center, choose the Manage Network Connections 
option. Double-click the wireless adapter, and you see Figure 6-19.

This dialog box is almost exactly like the Windows XP counterpart. You can 
see that this adapter has access to the Internet through IPv4 but has limited 
IPv6 connectivity (this is nothing to worry about, as most of the Internet 
uses the IPv4 connections, and Vista’s trying to get ahead of the curve by 
setting IP version 6),
Again, just like Windows XP, you can see the connection timer, speed, 
strength, and packet counters.
The Details button shows the exact IP addresses involved.
Pushing Boundaries
At some point, you’re going to venture out of your house and connect to 
another network, such as one in a hotel, airport, coffee shop, or another 
building.

102
Pushing Boundaries
Your computer is perfectly capable of keeping track of multiple configura­
tions, so connecting to a new network won’t cause any problems when you 
return home.
Most public networks are wide open and have no security. They employ a 
captive portal, which lets you connect to the network but immediately redi­
rects you to a login screen where you must log in, pay, or otherwise identify 
yourself before getting on the Internet. Remember that your wireless session 
is available for anyone else to capture, so be careful about typing in credit 
card numbers and passwords unless the Web site is protected with Secure 
Sockets Layer or Transport Layer Security (you see a lock in your browser 
window if this is the case, and the address bar might even change, depend­
ing on which browser you use). Book IV, Chapter 1 discusses browser secu­
rity in more depth.
Also, pay attention to which network you are connecting to. If you are at 
a hotel, you may want to check with the front desk to find the SSID of the 
network you should connect to. There may be other open networks you can 
connect to, but you’d be using someone else’s network, and you can’t be 
sure what they’re doing to your traffic.

✓	Printing wirelessly
✓	Using wireless file storage
✓	Adding an access point
O
ne drawback of being wire-free is that carrying your printer every­
where you go is a little tricky! Rather than plugging into the printer 
every time you need to print, let’s get your printer on the network, too! 
Many printers come with network adapters, so there’s no reason you 
shouldn’t be able to print from wherever you happen to be.
Having your computers on the same network also means they can share 
files. In this chapter, you discover a way to have a permanent file server on 
your network.
Finally, if your wireless network doesn’t reach somewhere, I look at adding 
another access point to your network to expand that reach.
Printing Wirelessly
Several years ago, the traditional way to get a printer on the network was to 
shell out big bucks for a printer that supported it, or to buy an adapter that 
had a parallel cable on one end and a network cable on the other. These 
devices cost between $50 and $100. I’m not sure about prices in your area, 
but that’s as much as an entry-level printer.
Over the past few years, printers have both dropped in price and become 
more feature rich. One of the features you can expect to see on some new 
printers is a wireless network card. This means that the printer can be 
placed anywhere there’s a power outlet. The extra cost to get a model with 
the wireless card is minimal, and it’s only going to get lower.
For example, the device I’m demonstrating here is a color inkjet printer that 
also copies, scans, and faxes. It’s got an 802.11g wireless adapter that can be 
found online for $150.

104
Printing Wirelessly
Just like the network adapter you installed earlier, you’ll need some drivers 
for your printer. This time, the drivers tell your computer how to communi­
cate with the printer over the network and how to operate the extra features 
such as scanning and faxing.
	
As usual, if you’ve got a different printer than the one I’m using, your screens 
will be different. However, the steps are similar.
Before you get started, have a look at the documentation that comes with 
your printer. The printer I’m using comes with a note that says if you intend 
to use the printer on a network that you should ignore the quick start guide 
and refer to the network installation guide.
Plug your printer in and install the ink cartridges per the directions in the 
manual.
To set the wireless configuration on the printer, you first have to get it set 
up on the wired network. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Plug the Ethernet cable that came with the printer into the back of the 
printer and the other end into your wireless router.
	
	 Figure 7-1 shows the network port on the back of the printer.

	 Your printer picks up its initial address from DHCP.
	
	 If your printer is nowhere near your router, bring your router to the 
printer rather than the other way around. The only thing you lose is 
Internet access, which isn’t needed for the installation anyway.
	
2.	 Put the CD that came with the printer into your CD drive, and you see 
the initial screen, shown in Figure 7-2.

3.	 Click the Install button to begin the installation.
	
	 After accepting the license and going through the introductory screens, 
you are prompted to indicate if this is a network installation or not.
	
	 You see a couple more screens of information, after which you are asked 
how you’re connected to the printer (shown in Figure 7-3). Method one 
is the simplest, as you are already set up that way (despite the picture in 
Figure 7-4 showing the computer plugged into the network, it works just 
as well over wireless).
	
4.	 Select Next and the software attempts to discover the printer.
	
	 If your computer has the Windows firewall enabled, then a dialog box 
appears so that you can make a firewall exception. Figure 7-5 shows the 
dialog box, to which you should select Unblock.
	
5.	 After a moment, your printer will be discovered, and you can con­
tinue clicking Next until you are asked how you want to print, as 
shown in Figure 7-6.

6.	 Even though the printer is plugged in now, you eventually want to get 
it on the wireless network, so select Wireless.
	
	 The software will scan for available wireless networks and then present 
a list of SSIDs that you can connect to, which is shown in Figure 7-7. This 
is almost identical to how you chose which network to connect your 
computer to.
	
7.	 Click on your network name to select it and then click the Next button.

If you noticed the WPS option during the setup, then good for you! For some 
reason, the current documentation specifically tells you not to use WPS, 
but after you’ve done the initial installation it works fine. This way would 
be handy, for instance, should you move the printer to a different network. 
From the control panel on the front of the printer, select Setup ➪Network 
Settings➪Wireless LAN setup. From there, you can change the network set­
tings, including performing a WPS setup. You still need the driver on your 
computer to print, though.
Sharing Files Wirelessly
Sharing files between computers over a network, wired or wireless, is noth­
ing new. However, you do find a few disadvantages:
	
✦	 The computer with the files on it has to be turned on. The current 
trend is to save energy by turning off computers when they’re not in 
use — which is good.
	
✦	 The computer with the files on it has to be connected to the network. 
If the file you need is on a laptop that’s not at home, you’ve got a problem.
	
✦	 It’s more difficult and less secure to share files with the Internet. If you 
want to grab some of your home files when you’re at work, for example, 
the usual solution is to expose one of your home computers to the 
Internet.

Add to this that external USB storage is becoming larger and cheaper. For 
much less than $200, you can get a 1TB disk that can be used on any com­
puter in your house, without having to take anything apart. Unfortunately, 
after you plug one of those bad boys into your laptop, you have no more 
mobility!
With the latest crop of home you simply plug the external hard drive into the 
router, configure file sharing, and presto! You have a permanent file server 
that you can store your stuff on. In Figure 7-8, I show a picture of the back of 
a Linksys WRT610N which has such a feature.
	
Figure 7-8: 
A USB 
port on a

device.
	
A router draws far less power than a computer, is always available, and its 
position in the network is ideal for performance. The router is also able to 
share files to both the internal network and the Internet at large because it 
sits on both of those networks.
Setting up file storage
Start by plugging your USB storage device into the USB port on your router 
and then log in to your router’s administrative interface. On the Linksys 
WRT610N you access the storage configuration from the Storage menu, 
which is shown in Figure 7-9.
The menu shows you details about the disk that’s currently plugged in. 
Above, you can see I have a 2GB flash disk drive plugged in. This is a good 
sign because it means the router has recognized the drive. If you don’t see 
any drives, double-check that the USB cable is plugged in all the way and 
that the hard drive has power.

110
Sharing Files Wirelessly
	
Figure 7-9: 
The storage 
menu.
	
The disk details, shown in Figure 7-9 also include a column called Create 
Share. Depending on how your disk is set up, you may or may not see a button 
in that column that also says Create Share. If you do see the button, then you 
can skip the next section. If your view is like that shown in Figure 7-9, you need 
to format the disk.
Formatting the disk
Disks must be formatted and partitioned before they can be used. This 
process lays out certain structures on the disk that the computer uses to 
remember where files are placed and which parts of the disk are free.
You can format a disk many different ways; however, not all formats are 
supported by the router. It’s easy to determine if you have to format your 
disk again — if you have the option to create a share, then you don’t have to 
format the disk. Additionally, you can see some partitions listed in the top 
table.
	
Formatting a disk deletes everything on that disk. Gone! Kaput! Copy your stuff 
off the disk to another computer before you format; otherwise, it’s gone!

Book II 
Chapter 7

111
Sharing Files Wirelessly
Follow these steps to format a disk:
	
1.	 After you back up your data, look down to the Format Disk section of 
the Web interface. Check the button next to the name of the disk and 
push the Format Disk button.
	
	 You receive a warning indicating that everything on the disk will be 
deleted, as shown in Figure 7-10.
	
Figure 7-10: 
A warning 
before 
formatting a 
disk.
	
	
2.	 If you are sure you’re ready to format the disk, click the OK button.
	
	 After you’ve done that, you are asked to supply the name of a partition 
(see Figure 7-11).
	
	 A partition is a way to split out a disk into multiple logical disks. This 
formatting process assigns one partition to the disk, using all available 
space, so the name of the partition isn’t that important.
	
3.	 Type the name of a partition and click the Format button.
	
	 You are asked again to confirm that you’re okay with any data on the 
disk being wiped clean, after which the router can chug away while it 
formats the disk. This may take a few minutes, depending on the size of 
your disk.

112
Sharing Files Wirelessly
	
	 After the formatting is complete, you are returned to the main storage 
menu (see Figure 7-12) showing the partition that was just created. Note 
that the Create Share button shows up along with the partition.
	
Figure 7-11: 
Supplying 
the name of 
a partition.
	
Figure 7-12 also shows that a shared folder called public has been created. 
Before you can use this share, though, you must take care of some of the 
default security settings.
Dealing with security
After you format the disk, the router creates a directory called public and 
shares it out with the name of Default. When you connect to a network share 
you must provide a username and password to connect with, which pre­
vents the wrong people from getting at your data.
The router has created two users by default and given them access to the 
share. One user, guest, can only read the data, while the admin user can read 
and write. This is okay, but you want to set the passwords to something you 
know and control. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the Administration submenu (the one to the right of FTP server, 
not the one to the left of Status) to see a list of the users and groups as 
shown in Figure 7-13.

4.	 Finally, click Modify User to save the change. Repeat this process for 
the Guest user.
Connecting to the file share
While you’re in the administration menu, make a note of the Server LAN IP 
Address. It’s the address of the router, which will now be your file server 
address.
	
1.	 From the Start menu, select Run, then two backslashes followed by 
the IP address of the router. I’ve shown this in Figure 7-15 using the IP 
address of my router, which is 192.168.99.1.
	
2.	 After you click OK, you are asked to log in (see Figure 7-16).
	
3.	 Type the admin user and password where prompted and select OK 
(you can also select the Remember my password box if you don’t want 
to have to log in all the time).

After you’ve logged in, you see a list of file shares available (see Figure 7-17). 
The Config file share contains a link to the administrative interface of the 
router; the Default file share is the one you set up earlier.
	
Figure 7-17: 
The list of

With this all done, you have a centralized place to put your files that never 
goes away!

116
Adding an Access Point
	
Make sure to back up your data, either by periodically burning files to DVD 
or making copies on other computers. Or, the other way around, this central 
file share makes a fine backup site for your local files, should something 
happen to your laptop.
	
Some of these devices have some features on top of the file sharing. For 
instance, the Linksys WRT610N can act as a media server which will be auto­
detected by Windows Vista and some other universal plug and play capable 
software. Any media files on the shared hard drive will be instantly acces­
sible to your audio software!
Adding an Access Point
Chapter 1 pointed out that wireless waves don’t travel forever, especially 
if dense objects like walls are in the way. It’s possible that you’ve got some 
wireless dead spots in your network, or even a whole area such as an out­
side workshop. Moving your router around might help things out, but at 
some point you need a second access point.
The general idea behind a second access point is that you plug it into your 
internal wired network and give it the same wireless settings as the router. 
If the radios are on two different channels, then your computer will pick 
which radio to associate with, based on signal strength. If you roam from 
one radio’s space to the other, then your computer moves over to the other 
access point.
	
That’s the theory, anyway. In practice, I’ve found that the built-in Windows 
wireless software doesn’t do a great job here, and that you’re better off 
using your manufacturer’s software if you plan on roaming between wireless 
zones. The worst case is that you have to reconnect when you move from 
one zone to the other.
This is a very effective technique for expanding your network. Your only 
requirements are an access point and a cable to go from wherever the 
access point is back to your Internet router.
The trouble I’ve found with access points is that they’re hard to find. I was at 
an office supply store doing some research, and I found a dozen varieties of 
wireless routers, but no access points.
Fear not! You’ll soon learn how to turn a router into a simple access point. If 
you’re upgrading your router anyway, you can keep your old router to pro­
vide lower-speed coverage to a different area of your place.

Book II 
Chapter 7
Setting Up Other 
Hardware
117
Adding an Access Point
	
We’re going to be turning off some features that make it easier to connect to 
your router, but nothing that’s irreversible. If you’re stuck, do a factory reset 
on the router and you’ll be able to connect again. Usually this involves push­
ing the reset button while rebooting your router. When in doubt, check the 
product documentation.
Converting a router into an access point
A wireless router is really a regular wired router with a built-in access point. 
All you need to do is avoid using the router part, and you’ve got yourself an 
access point.
Wireless routers generally have one Ethernet port that goes to the Internet, 
and about four ports for connecting wired devices into your internal net­
work. These four internal ports are bridged to the wireless side, meaning 
that they are on the same network.
With that in mind, if you connect the internal ports of two routers together 
you’ve got yourself two wireless networks that are connected. See what I 
mean in Figure 7-18. The goal here is to provide some extra coverage in the 
basement where the signal is low.

As long as those two radios are on different channels, it doesn’t matter 
which one you’re connected to because you’ll always be in the same net­
work. A few things to keep in mind, though:
	
✦	 Only one of the routers can be connected to the Internet. The other 
router’s Internet port is not used.
	
✦	 You need a special cable called a crossover cable to connect two rout­
ers together. It looks the same as a regular cable but one of the ends has 
some of the wires crossed.

118
Adding an Access Point
	
✦	 Only one DHCP server is needed for the whole network. If you had two 
DHCP servers going, there would be a lot of confusion. To make things 
simple, the DHCP server goes on the router that’s connected to the 
Internet.
	
✦	 The two routers must have different IP addresses. If they were the same, 
they’d fight, and your computer would not know how to get out to the 
Internet. Again, in the interests of simplicity, the router connected to the 
Internet will keep its address; the other router will pick a new one.
Despite having these four caveats, it’s not too hard to do, especially if you 
do it in the right order.
To keep things straight, the router that connects to the Internet is called the 
Internet router. The new router is called the expansion router.
Reconfiguring the expansion router
The first order of business is to reconfigure the expansion router. The easi­
est way to do this is to plug your computer into the router on one of the 
Internal ports, with the Internet disconnected.
The router I’m using is an older Linksys device that I’m repurposing to 
expand my wireless footprint. As usual, it may look different than yours, but 
the concepts are still the same. To reconfigure the expansion router, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Navigate to the Wireless menu and change the network name (SSID), 
so that it is the same as that on your Internet router.
	
	 Remember that case matters! See Figure 7-19.
	
Figure 7-19: 
Reconfigur- 
ing the 
SSID on the 
expansion 
router.
	

Book II 
Chapter 7
Setting Up Other 
Hardware
119
Adding an Access Point
	
2.	 After you’ve set the SSID, move over to the Wireless Security menu 
and change the security mode and key to the same thing as what 
you’re using on the Internet router, as shown in Figure 7-20.
	
	 Disable DHCP on the expansion router and change its address to 
something that doesn’t conflict with the Internet router.
	
	 On this access point, both tasks happen on the same screen. If your 
router has the features split, then make sure to change the address last! 
After you change the address, you won’t be able to connect to the router 
until you hook it into the Internet router, at which point you’d have two 
DHCP servers, which wouldn’t be great!
	
	 Figure 7-21 shows the screen to disable DHCP and change the IP 
address.
	
3.	 Change the Local DHCP Server setting to Disable.
	
4.	 Change the local IP address to something different than that of the 
Internet router. My Internet router’s address is 192.168.99.1, so I’m 
using 192.168.99.2 for the expansion router. Note that the first three 
numbers are the same, only the last one differs.

	 You might also note that the Internet connection stays on Obtain an IP 
automatically. This setting doesn’t really matter anymore because the 
expansion router won’t be plugged into the Internet.
	
5.	 Click the Save button.
	
	 After you save the settings, you will lose connection to the router 
because it’s using a new address. (This is expected, and it’ll come back 
in the next step.)
	
	 You should already have a crossover cable run from your Internet 
router to the expansion router.
	
6.	 Plug this cable into an internal port on each router.
	
	 The port number doesn’t matter, but it has to be the internal port. Don’t 
use the Internet port on the expansion router!
You can now connect to either router using their address in your Web 
browser. You can access the Internet, and any other computer on your net­
work, while associated to either of the access points. In fact, you shouldn’t 
even know which network you’re on!

T
echnology always works, right? I don’t believe that either. Many pieces 
have to come together correctly to put a Web page on your computer 
and get your e-mail delivered so that it’s a wonder that it works at all.
Sometimes parts break or just don’t work the way you want them to. You’ve 
just built a wireless network; it’s quite probable that something needs to be 
fixed.
In this chapter, we look at fixing your network problems, or at least getting 
far enough that you can point the finger at your service provider.
Before You Begin
Was your wireless network working, then you did something, and then it 
stopped working? Even if you did something, that shouldn’t have made a dif­
ference. Maybe you installed some new software, changed a name, or were 
rearranging some cables.
If so, undo what you did. If it’s not undoable (such as moving cables 
around), make sure everything was exactly the way it was before.
Most computer problems happen because something was changed. It’s okay 
to change things, but when the change makes your computer break, backing 
out of the change is faster than fiddling around.
Coming Up with a Plan
Successful troubleshooting means following a plan. I’m not talking about a 
detailed written plan — most often a picture on a scrap of paper can suffice. 

122
Coming Up with a Plan
Generally, you start at one end of the network and work your way through to 
the other end until you’ve found the problem.
Defining the problem
Before you start anything, define your problem. Framing this definition in 
terms of what you are trying to do that’s not working is important. Some 
good descriptions are
	
✦	 I’m trying to browse to http://example.com, but my Web browser says 
“Host not found.”
	
✦	 I’m trying to get my e-mail, but Outlook tells me “Invalid password.”
	
✦	 I’m trying to get the sports scores, but my Web browser just returns a 
white screen.
Note that in all cases the problem description includes an error message, 
or at least a description of what you are seeing, along with a description of 
what you’re trying to do. This information helps guide your troubleshooting 
and will be essential information if you have to call someone for support.
A few bad problem descriptions are
	
✦	 The Internet is down.
	
✦	 My e-mail is broken.
	
✦	 My site doesn’t work.
These phrases don’t communicate anything to people trying to help, nor do 
they describe the problem.
If you have multiple computers in your house, then you should check to see 
if the problem exists on some of those. Doing this helps differentiate a com­
puter problem from a network problem.
Drawing a picture
It may sound corny, but drawing a picture can help your troubleshooting 
considerably. A picture helps you understand how all the parts go together, 
which guides your problem solving.
You can see a sketch of my network in Figure 8-1:

work to the router, which connects to the Internet, through the cloud known 
as the Internet to the Web site.
Is the error message trying to tell me something?
Now that the network layout is fresh in your mind, look at the error 
message that comes up when you try to perform your task. Is it pointing 
out something?
For example, if your e-mail client tells you that the username and password 
are wrong, you should jump straight to verifying those items. Sometimes, 
though, the error message doesn’t make things any clearer for you, which 
means that you need to continue to troubleshoot.
Is the problem the same for all sites?
If your problem has to do with a Web site, then check another Web site to 
see if it has the same problem. Sites such as Google.com, yahoo.com, and 
ebay.com should generally be available, unless the problem is more local.
If you can get to other sites, then chances are your site is having problems, 
and you’ll just have to wait it out. You could call a friend and ask if they’re 
having the same problem, just to make sure.
If other sites seem to be down, too, then the problem is probably on your 
end, and it’s time to fix it.
If Web sites work, but e-mail doesn’t, then there’s little point in following the 
guidelines in this chapter. You’ve shown that the Internet works and that it’s 
a problem with your ISP. Skip straight to calling your ISP.

Looking at Your PC
Looking at Your PC
Starting at the left of the network diagram, you want to make sure your com­
puter’s working correctly.
Before you start checking your PC’s settings, can you log into the adminis­
trative interface of your router while connected to the wireless network? If 
so, your PC’s probably okay, and you can skip to the next section. If not, it’s 
time to troubleshoot the PC.
Repairing your network connection
In Windows XP, right-click on the network adapter icon in your system tray 
and select Repair. Your computer disables the network adapter and then 
brings it up.
In Vista, right-click on the network adapter icon in the system tray and select 
Diagnose and Repair.
Rebooting the computer
If resetting the network connection doesn’t work, then reboot your com­
puter. I know it’s a pain, but this is Windows after all, and sometimes it 
needs the computer equivalent of a swift kick in the behind. Rebooting 
solves a lot of problems.
After a reboot, Windows gets a fresh chance to do things in its own order 
and from scratch, which is often enough to fix a problem with the computer.
Checking the wireless association
At this point, you’ve rebooted your computer so you know that it wasn’t 
some sort of transient thing that most computers experience. Looking back 
at the network diagram, the problem must either be between you and your 
router, the router itself, or with the rest of the Internet.
If you can, try plugging your computer into the router using an Ethernet cable 
instead of using wireless. If things work with a wire, then the problem must be 
with the wireless connection. If not, you can troubleshoot the router.
Go back to your list of wireless networks (see Chapter 6) and make sure 
you’re connected to the right one! If your computer loses connection to your 
original access point, it will try to find another one and associate with that, 
even if it doesn’t belong to you or work properly. You might not even notice 
this happening at the time.

Book II 
Chapter 8
Troubleshooting 
Network Hardware
125
Looking at Your PC
If you’re not connected to the right wireless network, or you’re not connected 
to any network, review Chapter 6 to configure your computer. Try it with both 
the built-in Windows configuration and your vendor’s configuration tool.
	
Pay close attention to the signal strength as you configure your network. A 
low strength is a sign that you need to either move your router to a better 
spot or add a second access point for more coverage. Put your computer in 
the same room as the access point while configuring, just to make sure.
Incorrect passwords are often the culprit when dealing with association 
problems. Review the settings on the wireless router and make sure that 
they match those on the computer. If Wireless Protected Setup is available 
to you, then use that method.
If, after all that, you can’t associate with your wireless network, skip ahead 
to the end of this chapter and upgrade your router firmware and your com­
puter’s drivers.
Verifying your IP settings
If you’re able to associate with an access point and you are still having prob­
lems connecting to the Internet, then it’s time to make sure you’re getting a 
proper address.
In Windows XP, right-click on the adapter in the system tray and select 
Status. Then click on the Support tab and click Details.
In Vista, choose Start➪Control Panel➪Network and Sharing Center. Click on 
the Status link next to your wireless adapter and then click Details.
You are looking for the following information:
	
✦	 IP address (or IPv4 address in Vista)
	
✦	 DHCP Server
	
✦	 Default gateway
	
✦	 DNS Server
Checking the IP address
The IP address identifies your computer on the network. The IP address 
probably begins with 192.168, though it could also begin with 172 or 10. 
These are the reserved private network addresses and are used for people 
behind routers.

126
Looking at Your PC
If your IP address begins with 169.254, then you aren’t getting an address 
from your DHCP server. If a computer doesn’t hear from a DHCP server, then 
it picks one of these addresses. This is okay if you have computers that want 
to talk to each other, but it will not work with your router.
Pay special attention if your computer roams between networks, such as 
home and work. Sometimes Windows doesn’t pick up a new address when 
it changes networks, and it is vital to have a proper address. This is why the 
first step in troubleshooting is to initiate a repair operation on the adapter 
or reboot the computer.
DHCP and your gateway
Your DHCP server should be the address of your router. It should also be 
the same as your default gateway. If you don’t have a DHCP server set, then 
your computer might be set with a static address. Generally, you want to 
pick up a dynamic address.
If you have an IP address beginning with 169.254, then it’s possible that your 
router does not have the DHCP service turned on. If so, it’s best to do a fac­
tory reset of your router and start from scratch.
If your DHCP server is different from your gateway, then you might have two 
DHCP servers running on your network. Recall from Chapter 7 that you only 
want one DHCP server, and it should be the device that also plugs in to the 
Internet (and should therefore be your default gateway).
You should also have a gateway set. The gateway is the device that your 
computer uses to send information to the Internet.
Changing to DHCP addressing
If you don’t have a DHCP server set, then your computer is probably hard 
coded with an address (also called a static address). To work properly on 
your network, you want to use DHCP addressing.
	
If your computer was set up with a static address for a reason, such as to 
work with an office network, then you have to switch your settings every 
time you change networks. It would be worth your time to find out if you can 
use DHCP on the other network.

Looking at Your Router
You should be able to connect over the wireless network to your router. If 
not, make sure of the following:
	
✦	 Do you have DHCP enabled on the router?
	
✦	 Is the computer able to associate with the wireless network?
	
✦	 Can you connect to the wireless router’s Web interface using its address 
(such as 192.168.1.1) over the wireless network?
The “Looking at Your PC” section covers these three items in detail.
If you’ve got through the previous section and still can’t connect to the 
router, then skip ahead to the end and look at updating drivers.
Look back at the network diagram. Because you can connect to the router, 
you know that your computer is all right and the wireless network works. So, 
the problem is either the router or the router’s connection to the Internet.
Rebooting the router and ISP equipment
Reboots fix a lot of things, and your Internet connection is no exception. Pull 
the power from your cable or ADSL modem and your wireless router, count 
to five, and then plug them back in.

130
Looking at Your Router
While you’re at it, make sure that all the cables are plugged in properly. 
Ethernet cables have a tab on the connector that prevents the cable from 
falling out, so a gentle tug on the connector verifies that everything is 
locked in.
Also verify that the devices have power. All devices differ, but they all have 
some sort of light to indicate that they’re on. If, after all this work, you real­
ized that you forgot to plug something in, don’t worry; it happens to the best 
of us!
Give things a few minutes to settle and check again.
Bypassing the router
By now, you’ve checked all the common problems with the router and 
you’re getting close to the point where you’re going to have to call someone 
for help.
Take your router out of the loop by plugging your computer directly into 
your Internet connection. For cable modems, this is fairly straightforward, 
but for ADSL connections you sometimes need some special software.
If you’re able to connect to the Internet with your computer directly plugged 
in to your cable or ADSL modem, then your ISP is off the hook. The problem 
must be with your router. (I go over this in the next section.)
If you still can’t browse the Web with your computer plugged in to the 
Internet connection, then your provider’s probably at fault. You might want 
to skip down to the “Before Calling for Support” section.
If you’ve successfully connected to the Internet with the router before, and it 
just stopped working, then it’s probably a problem with your provider. Make 
sure that you’ve rebooted everything, and then jump down to the “Before 
Calling for Support” section.
Setting the connection type
If you remember way back to when you set up the router, you were asked 
if your Internet Service Provider requires a username and password to log 
in. This information is required to authenticate to the provider and get your 
service. If this information is wrong, then you won’t be able to log in.
Similarly, if the router is configured to log in, but your provider isn’t expect­
ing it, then you have problems.
First, check to see if you’re getting an IP address from your provider. On the 
NETGEAR router, click on the Router Status link, which is in the Maintenance 
section and is shown in Figure 8-6.

Book II 
Chapter 8
Troubleshooting 
Network Hardware
131
Looking at Your Router
	
Figure 8-6: 
The router 
status 
screen.
	
The section of the router status screen headed Internet Port contains the 
information pertaining to your Internet connection. You can see that an IP 
address of 24.79.141.14 has been assigned, and that DNS servers have also 
been given (it is all right that the IP address and the DNS servers look noth­
ing like each other).
If you have an Internet address of 0.0.0.0, then it means that you’re not con­
nected to your provider, or your provider is having a problem.
In this event, check the cable between your router and the modem, and 
between the modem and the provider, to make sure they’re attached and in 
the right port.
Go back to Chapter 3 and make sure your router is set up correctly. If every­
thing seems fine on your end, see the next section to make sure the router’s 
firmware is up to date, and then call your provider.
If at this point all indications are that things should be working but they 
aren’t, you still can’t pin the blame on your router or the service provider. In 
this case, it’s best to work through your service provider first to verify that 
the Internet connection is working, and if that is successful, to call the sup­
port line for your router for further troubleshooting.

132
Upgrading Software
Upgrading Software
When software is written, the possibility of bugs being introduced exists. 
One of my favorite quotes about software development is, “If debugging is 
the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of 
putting them in.”
Sometimes software is shipped with bugs (either knowingly or unknowingly), 
and sometimes changes to other software introduces new bugs.
Thankfully, most devices ship with the ability to upgrade software in the 
field. For routers, this means that you can upgrade the firmware that runs 
the hardware. For wireless adapters, this means that you can upgrade the 
drivers.
The downside is that you need to get on the Internet to get the latest 
updates. If you are upgrading to regain your Internet connection, then you 
have to use a working computer to get the appropriate software onto a USB 
pen drive or a CD-ROM.
	
To find the latest software upgrades, go to the home page of the device’s 
manufacturer, and look for a link called either “Support” or “Drivers and 
Downloads.” You’ll need to know the model number of the device you have.
Upgrading router firmware
Your router is a special purpose computer and needs some special soft­
ware to make it run, much like your computer needs an operating system 
like Windows to run. For routers, the manufacturer provides the operating 
system. The router comes with a version of the software, but periodically 
updates are released.
Updates are a good thing for you, the consumer. A few years back, when the 
wireless encryption standards were in a state of flux, manufacturers were 
able to release updates containing the latest standards. This way, custom­
ers could be using the latest security protocols without having to buy a new 
router. When the 802.11n standard makes it out of draft form, you should be 
able to download an updated version of your router code that will bring you 
into compliance.
The software that a router runs is called firmware, which is some geek’s way 
of talking about something halfway between hardware and software.
Download the firmware from the vendor’s support site and store it on your 
computer. If you got the file as a .zip file, then unpack it first.

Book II 
Chapter 8
Troubleshooting 
Network Hardware
133
Upgrading Software
Most manufacturers recommend doing upgrades while connected to a wired 
port rather than wireless. This is because if the connection is interrupted 
during the upgrade, the router will only have part of the new image, and it 
might not run correctly anymore. The technical term for this is called brick­
ing your router, because a failed upgrade usually renders the device with the 
same functionality as a brick.
	
1.	 Look for a menu item within the router’s Web GUI that talks about 
upgrading.
	
	 Figure 8-7 shows the upgrade menu from the NETGEAR router.
	
2.	 Click the Browse button to locate the image you downloaded and 
click OK.
	
3.	 Click the Upload button to send the software image to the router.
	
	 The next screen prompts you to confirm the version number on the 
router. In Figure 8-8, you can see that the current revision is 1.2.0.8, and 
I’m trying to upgrade it with the same version.

4.	 Click Yes if you want to continue.
	
	 The router displays a progress bar and thinks for a while before reboot­
ing and bringing you back to the main menu.
	
Don’t touch your computer while this process is happening. Go grab a coffee 
or something. It’ll finish on its own!
That was easy, wasn’t it?
Upgrading your network drivers
The network drivers control how the physical adapter interfaces with the 
rest of the operating system. Changes to the operating system sometimes 
mean that you have to update your driver. Sometimes new wireless features 
are added to the adapter that allow you to be more compatible with other 
wireless networks.
While you’re upgrading your drivers, you may as well upgrade the wireless 
utilities. In fact, doing both at once is usually easier than going the long way 
and upgrading your drivers.

Book II 
Chapter 8
Troubleshooting 
Network Hardware
135
Upgrading Software
Most manufacturers release a self-installing package that automatically 
updates your wireless drivers and the wireless utilities. It’s remarkably 
simple to use.
For this example, I went to the Intel support site and searched for 3945ABG, 
which is the wireless card model I have. I know this because it’s printed 
on the bottom of my computer. I was then asked to choose my operating 
system. Finally, I saw the screen shown in Figure 8-9.
The following options are available:
	
✦	 The first option is to download only the wireless drivers. Doing this 
updates the adapter to the latest code, but it won’t touch the manage­
ment tools. The key words here are drivers-only.
	
✦	 The second option is to download the drivers and management soft­
ware. This includes both the wireless drivers and the connection utility. 
This option is the better choice in my humble opinion, even if you don’t 
use the vendor’s management utilities.

136
Before Calling for Support
Click the Download link, accept the agreement, and then save the file to a 
directory, such as your desktop. Run the program that you downloaded and 
follow the prompts. It’s fairly uneventful.
Before Calling for Support
If you got this far, then you’re calling either your ISP or your router manufac­
turer for support. That’s all right, because that’s what they’re there for. You 
can do this before you call to make the process go quicker, though.
	
Whatever you do, don’t get mad at the person on the other end of the phone. 
Doing so just makes the repair take longer. Remember that he didn’t cause 
the problem — they’re trying to help you. Introduce yourself and greet them 
by name.
No matter who you’re calling, make sure to have the following things handy:
	
✦	 A concise description of the problem and what you think should be 
happening
	
✦	 An estimate of when the problem started
	
✦	 A list of what you’ve done so far
	
✦	 A description of what your network looks like
If you are calling your service provider, make sure that you know the 
following:
	
✦	 Your account number or billing address and what kind of service you have
	
✦	 A description of which lights are on the modem and what color they are
	
✦	 The last time you rebooted your computer and modem
If you are calling your router manufacturer, have the following handy:
	
✦	 The model number of the router in question.
	
✦	 A description of which lights are on and what color they are.
	
✦	 A summary of what you’ve tried. Does the router work if you are wired 
in but not wireless?
The people on the phone will start by asking many of the same questions 
that have already been asked in this chapter. Just go with the flow — they’re 
just trying to make sure the common problems have been covered.

Chapter 1: Exploring 
Windows Networking
In This Chapter
✓	Windows XP makes wireless easy
✓	Plug and play . . . hopefully
✓	Choosing the kind of network you want
M
icrosoft introduced an easy wireless network setup and configuration 
with the release of Windows XP in 2001. Prior to that, installing any 
kind of network using Windows computers was often a hassle and usually 
unpredictable. Skip ahead to 2009, and subsequent editions of Windows 
(most notably Vista and the new Windows 7) have made things even easier! 
In many cases, it’s as simple as turning on your computer or flipping a 
switch on your laptop.
If you have a typical setup, which includes a modern PC and networking 
equipment released in the past one or two years, creating a wireless network 
should be a snap. If all goes well, you can install a wireless network adapter 
in your PC, and you’re almost ready to connect with your chosen wireless 
network. The best part is that once you set up your wireless network, it’s 
completely low maintenance — don’t expect to have to toy around with the 
settings very often. Now, cross your fingers (I’m watching, as is Microsoft) 
and venture into the relatively painless world of Windows XP and wireless 
networking.
Installing Is Child’s (Plug and) Play
Most of the work of installing a wireless network is done by the computer 
as part of the operating system’s plug and play feature. That means after 
plugging in your adapter, it should be installed automatically (or close to it). 
You may have to install a driver or supplemental piece of software to inter­
act with the hardware, but it’s a very easy procedure to perform.
With modern wireless technology, installing the necessary hardware into 
your computer is usually so-called plug and play. In other words, the pro­
cess is supposed to be mostly automated: You plug in your network adapter 

140
Working with the Network and Sharing Center
(a card that transmits and receives signals over your wireless network), and 
the operating system is supposed to recognize, install, and configure it with 
minimal action on your part.
If you have newer hardware, this should be the case most of the time. If 
you’re trying to use an older or obscure network adapter (stay away from 
the bargain bins!) or own a computer that you bought more than, say, eight 
or nine years ago, this might not be the case.
And remember that I’m talking about Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later 
here. If you’re running an older operating system, all bets are off. My advice: 
Upgrade to Windows Vista before you pursue this course called wireless net­
working. If you’re one of those home computer users that just isn’t comfort­
able using Windows Vista for whatever reason, then you’ll want to make sure 
you’re using Windows XP Service Pack 2 at the very minimum or plan on 
upgrading to Windows 7 upon availability. In order to remain consistent with 
Microsoft’s current offering at the time of publishing, I work with Windows 
Vista in any relevant procedures.
Just because Windows can configure your network adapter doesn’t mean 
you want it to do so. You may find that the utility software that came with 
the adapter provides more features and better feedback about signal 
strength and other basics. For example, the Intel Pro Wireless Network 
Connection is a more than capable alternative to Windows’ Network and 
Sharing Center.
In that case, let Windows’ plug-and-play feature handle the installation, and 
you can look to the network equipment maker for the software to add any 
extra features that Windows doesn’t add automatically. Just remember, if 
you decide to use a third-party application to manage your computer’s wire­
less capabilities, it completely shuts Windows out of the picture until you 
decide to revert.
Working with the Network and Sharing Center
My Network Places is replaced in Windows Vista with the Network and 
Sharing Center, as shown in Figure 1-1.
The Network and Sharing Center is really a one-stop shop for all of your net­
work needs; it truly is the hub of your broadband experience. When you first 
access the center, as discussed in the following sections, you will find out 
a lot about your network. For example, Windows draws a basic schema of 
your network connection that shows your computer, the name and type of 
network location, and finally to what you’re connected (the Internet!).

Working with the Network and Sharing Center
	
Figure 1-1: 
The new 
Network 
and Sharing 
Center.
	
From the main panel in the Network and Sharing Center, you can find out 
more information about your network, such as the name and access you 
have. While it’s a more text-based version of the aforementioned schema, 
this section lets you rename your network. Remembering Mike’s Network 
is easier than remembering Network 24, which is default Windows fashion. 
This section is also important because it indicates whether or not you actu­
ally have Internet access. When everything is running smoothly, it says Local 
and Internet. Should you see only Local only, you know you’ve got problems 
on your hands and you should consider rebooting either your computer or 
your wireless router.
The second section of the main pane concerns your file sharing options 
(Sharing and Discovery). By default, all available menus are collapsed but 
can be expanded to set your preferences. Each option is represented with a 
green light (on) or a gray radio button (off), indicating the status. The shar­
ing options also extend to printers, media files, and public folder sharing. I 
recommend only enabling these options when you are working on a private 
network, such as at your home. If you are in a public place, you will really 
want to think twice about making key folders on your computer available to 
everyone within wireless range.
The left side of the Network and Sharing Center displays a series of tasks 
and related topics. With respect to wireless networking, these tasks allow 
you to either set up a new wireless network or connect to an existing, avail­
able wireless network within range of your computer.

142
Working with the Network and Sharing Center
So, when do we actually get to meet the Network and Sharing Center? How 
about right now? The following sections provide several ways for you to 
access it in Windows Vista.
Accessing from the Windows taskbar
Here’s how you access the Network and Sharing Center from the taskbar:
	
1.	 Right-click the network icon (two screens joined with a planet Earth) 
in the right-side of the taskbar, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	
	 The corresponding contextual menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Network and Sharing Center.
	
	 The Network and Sharing Center appears in a separate window.

Accessing from the All Programs menu
Perhaps you are more old-school and like to use your keyboard to locate 
Windows features:
If you grew up using Microsoft Windows as 
your primary (if not only) operating system over 
the years, you’re undoubtedly familiar with the 
legendary Windows folders: My Documents, 
My Pictures, My Music, and so on.
Windows Vista offers a few new changes to 
that tried and true practice. First, you’ve likely 
noticed that Vista has dumped My. More impor­
tantly, Vista offers a second set of documents 
called Public folders. These folders, which 
include Public Desktop, Public Documents, 
Public Downloads, and so on, as shown in the 
figure, let you make specific files and folders 
available to others on your computer or your 
network. To use them, simply drag and drop 
the file or folder into the corresponding Public 
folder. These folders are accessible from 
Windows Explorer.

Mingling with Different Networks
You can create two kinds of networks with Windows:
	
✦	 Infrastructure: Chances are you want to create an infrastructure net­
work, which is the traditional network that uses a DSL or cable modem 
connecting to your computer directly or through a router.
	
✦	 Computer to computer: You also see this called a peer-to-peer or an ad 
hoc network. It’s a connection made directly between one computer and 
another.
As always, each has advantages and disadvantages.

144
Thinking about an Infrastructure Network
Thinking about an Infrastructure Network
Most likely, when you think of a wireless network, you’re thinking about an 
infrastructure network. Book II is essentially about creating an infrastructure 
network. I avoid repeating that information here.
However, anytime you communicate between a wireless access point (such 
as a wireless router) and a wireless network adapter, you’re moving infor­
mation over an infrastructure network. When you’re on the road and using 
a coffee shop’s wireless access, you’re connecting to an infrastructure net­
work. Your computer is connecting through a wireless access point, which 
in turn connects to the Internet.
In most cases, it just makes more sense at home to set up and run this kind 
of network instead of a computer-to-computer network.
Creating a Computer-to-Computer Network
A computer-to-computer network means exactly that: Your computer is 
wirelessly connecting directly to another computer. This is known as an ad 
hoc network. Both PCs need wireless adapters, of course. Windows XP also 
will need to be set up to handle a computer-to-computer network connection.
At one time, a computer-to-computer network may have been cheaper to 
create because you didn’t need a router. Instead, one computer can con­
nect to the Internet and the other PC can wirelessly share that connection. 
Declining hardware costs provide no reason to use a computer-to-computer 
network when what you really need is an infrastructure network, which 
requires a router and possibly other hardware.
You can use a computer-to-computer network in your home or on the road, but 
a wireless network usually has specific applications, including the following:
	
✦	 On a business trip, you and a colleague can connect your laptops wire­
lessly, allowing you to share files without the use of a router or other 
wireless access point.
	
✦	 Anytime you’re mobile, the network moves with you because you don’t 
have to lug routers or other hardware (aside from your laptop).
	
✦	 Anywhere an infrastructure network’s wireless access point is unreach­
able; a computer-to-computer network provides an Internet connection, 
provided one of the computers is connected to the Internet.
	
✦	 If you don’t want to rely on the hardware in an infrastructure network, 
a computer-to-computer network provides redundancy. If a router goes 
down on an infrastructure network, the whole network stops working.

Creating a Computer-to-Computer Network
With a computer-to-computer network, another computer can always 
share the load. (This assumes more than two computers are in the 
computer-to-computer network.)
Creating a network for work
Depending on your network configuration at work, it may be possible for you 
to connect to your servers or computer at the office from home or on the 
road. To do this, you must first connect to your office’s network and then 
use the Remote Desktop Connection application, which allows you to con­
nect directly to a specific machine or server.
Before trying to create a connection to your office’s network, verify with 
your IT or helpdesk team that you are authorized to create such connection. 
You also want to make sure that you have the parameters and login settings 
necessary to log on successfully. Of course, for security reasons, be sure to 
log off from the network or your remote computer when you are done with 
your session.
To connect to a work network, you need to first connect to a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN), which lets you act as if you were plugged in at the office. 
This type of network is covered in Book V, Chapter 6.
After you are connected to your VPN, go to Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪Remote Desktop Connection. Once you add your credentials 
(available from your company’s network administrator, if you don’t already 
know these details), you can access your computer exactly as if you were 
at work.
Enabling Internet sharing
After you have a computer-to-computer network set up, you can configure 
one computer to share an Internet connection with the other computers. I 
don’t recommend using this fast and dirty way to share broadband access 
unless you have no other choice. It’s slow compared to using an infrastruc­
ture network with a router.
If you can, try to build an infrastructure network where a router does the 
work of divvying out IP addresses to each computer and, most importantly, 
hides the network behind a firewall.
This method is really a last-ditch effort when you need to share an Internet 
connection. With the advance of networking and wireless technologies in 
recent years, it’s hard to believe that this option is still available!

Available Networks
In This Chapter
✓	Finding out about wireless networks
✓	Adding a preferred network
✓	Watching your network
✓	Setting some advanced preferences
A
good thing about wireless networks is that you don’t have those pesky 
Ethernet cables to tie you up in knots. I can still remember back in the 
old days when I’d have those drab, gray cables running from room to room. 
I also remember constantly tripping over said cables; fortunately, those 
days are gone! That doesn’t mean that wireless networks are always easy 
to set up and use. Hopefully, you’ve made it past the rough spots and are 
ready to actually transfer data around your home.
Maybe your wireless network is ready to send data between your living 
room and second-floor bathroom. If so, make sure your PC can see the 
router and any other access points. That’s where Windows Vista’s Connect 
to a network feature in the Network and Sharing Center, formerly known as 
Available Networks for Windows XP, enters the picture.
I also discuss some ways to monitor your network’s signal strength and 
capacity. Other chapters discuss similar network troubleshooting and main­
tenance topics:
	
✦	 Book II, Chapter 8 gives you some help troubleshooting network adapters.
	
✦	 Book III, Chapter 5 discusses how you confirm your wireless network is 
working.
	
✦	 Book IV, Chapter 3 gives you some tips for solving wireless networking 
problems.
Discovering What’s Out There
Notice that the title doesn’t say who is out there. After all, this chapter’s 
about wireless networks, not dating. If you’re still interested in finding 
what’s out there, read on, because you’re in the right place.

148
Discovering What’s Out There
The Connect to a network feature lets you see what networks are available — 
for dial-up, VPN, and wireless. Available means that they’re out there, probably 
close by. The list should include one or more of your own networks, if all goes 
well. If you don’t see your networks, be concerned.
If you sort the list to only display available wireless connections, the list is 
displayed by signal strength, which is indicated by a series of bars (much 
like the ones used by mobile phones to display signal strength).Your 
network(s) should be at the top of this list; if it’s not, it should be quite 
closer; otherwise, we should discuss where your wireless router is stored, 
not to mention where it is that you tend to do most of your work.
In some cases, you see neighbors’ wireless networks. That doesn’t mean 
that you can connect to those networks, though. (I tackle that issue in more 
detail, along with other security topics, in Book IV.)
You likely won’t see wireless networks where the owners have intentionally 
made them invisible to public viewing. The geeks can still discover your net­
work name, but it’s one tool in your security toolbox. After I tell you about 
monkey wrenches and screwdrivers (I’m trying to milk this toolbox metaphor), 
I talk about how you can make your network mostly invisible in Book IV.
	
1.	 Right-click the network icon in your Windows notification area.
	
	 A menu appears.
	
2.	 Select Connect to a network.
	
	 You see something like Figure 2-1. The dialog box lists Available 
Networks. In this case, Dog is the network and Livebox-bbcc is the neigh­
bor (possibly the one with the barking dog and who insists on partying 
every weekend).

3.	 Click the name of the desired network and click Connect. 
	
	 If the selected network requires a network key, now’s the time to type it 
in this screen of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-2.
	
Figure 2-2: 
You need 
to know the 
security 
key for a 
secured 
network 
before you 
can use it.
	
	
	 Some networks require a network key, which is basically a password 
with so many unrelated letters and numbers that only a Jeopardy con­
testant can remember it. You can tell if the network requires a network 
key because it is labeled as a security-enabled network.
	
	 What if an available network requires a network key, but you don’t have 
one? If you’re sure it’s your network or one you’ve been invited to use, 
you should ask its administrator for The Magic Key. Unfortunately, 
“abracadabra” doesn’t work here.
	
4.	 If a network doesn’t require a network key (labeled as an Unsecured 
network), click the Connect Anyway link as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
	 If you do use an unsecured network, be aware that your data may be 
visible to other parties. Though there is some security risk in using 
unsecured networks, you can take precautions (and others that Windows 
automatically takes for you in this case, which I will discuss later).
	
	 It’s a scary option, I know, but select it for now. I tackle security issues 
in another chapter. That’s it! You’re done.

yourself 
into.
	
You can do something that ensures almost always having a working Internet 
connection. In one word, it’s called redundancy. Say a DSL line now comes 
into your house. Well, call up the cable company and order its cable modem 
service, too. Now use one connection for your wired network and the other 
connection for your wireless network. If one goes down, you can easily 
switch to the other Internet connection. Too bad you can’t do that with 
electrical service!
When you went to your local electronics store 
to buy a laptop, or a wireless router/card, you 
likely noticed that 802.11 (followed by a/b/g/n) 
appeared on the box. These are wireless 
protocols that are used to designate a set of 
standard for wireless communications. For 
example, if you are using 802.11a (which is 
very unlikely these days), you know that your 
wireless connection is operating on a certain 
frequency and has a set data transfer rate.
There are currently four protocols used for 
wireless communications. The oldest are “a” 
and “b” — which are also the least powerful. 
I’d say that “g” is the most commonly used pro­
tocol, but it will quickly be replaced by the “n” 
protocol, which has only been available for a 
relatively short amount of time. When you buy 
a wireless router, you must make sure that your 
laptop computer or wireless card is compatible 
with the router. If you buy an 802.11n wireless 
router, but only have a “g” compatible card, 
you won’t be able to take advantage of the high 
performance of the “n” protocol.
To get a good idea of the difference between 
the various protocols, here are some facts and 
figures:
What the heck is a, b, g, n?

Viewing Available Networks
If you followed the previous set of instructions, you’ve made it past the 
initial gatekeeper. You can view all available networks now. After follow­
ing the steps in the preceding section, you find yourself in the Wireless 
Properties dialog box.
As I mention earlier, you may see your neighbors’ wireless networks on the 
list. Ignore them, as it’s the right thing to do. Hopefully, they’ll do the same 
for you. Besides, you were wise enough to enable security on your wireless 
network, so there’s no chance of them getting on, right?
If the stars are aligned, you see your wireless network along with other kinds 
of networks on the list, as shown in Figure 2-4. Again, in the example the 
network is dubbed Dog, which does not reflect on myself, my cat, or my net­
work hardware.
You can refresh the list of available networks by clicking the — yes! — 
Refresh button, which is above the list of networks, to the right (across from 
the Show scroll-down list). If you’re in a neighborhood with lots of wireless 
networks, you’ll probably see this list constantly change as some networks 
go live and others shut down.

You can configure an available network from the Manage Wireless Networks 
page, which is available from the Tasks list in the Network and Sharing 
Center. Configuration options include changing the network name (which is 
also called the SSID) and the wireless network key. Here’s how you configure 
an available network:
	
1.	 In the Network and Sharing Center, click Manage wireless networks 
under the Tasks list.
	
2.	 Click the name of the network you wish to configure.
	
3.	 Right-click and select Rename. (The network name becomes an enter­
able text box, as shown in Figure 2-5.) Rename the network and click 
outside the box.
	
	 A dialog box appears warning you of the consequences of such actions. 
Validate this dialog box. The network appears in the Manage Wireless 
Networks page with its new name.
	
4.	 Right-click the name of the network and click Properties; click the 
Security tab.
	
	 The following dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-6.
	
5.	 You can make one or more changes to Association settings:
 
• Toggle Network Authentication between Open and Shared.
 
• Change the Data Encryption setting to Disabled or WEP. If you select 
WEP, you can enter a network key and make other related changes. 
WEP is discussed in Book IV, Chapter 3, which covers the implemen­
tation of wireless network security.

Managing Preferred Networks
Managing Preferred Networks
You also can make an available network a preferred network. This gives 
some networks priority over other networks in case Windows has several 
from which to choose. It also lets you save custom configuration settings 
so you don’t need to make them twice for the same network. When you find 
yourself in an area covered by a particular wireless network you used in the 
past, you’ll be all set to connect.
In Windows XP, there was actually a dialog box called Preferred Networks. 
Now it’s handled from the Manage Wireless Networks page. Here’s what you 
can do from this page:
	
✦	 Add a network
	
✦	 Remove a network
	
✦	 View a network’s properties
	
✦	 Reorder a preferred network’s position
Each time you connect to an available network, the network is added to 
the list of preferred networks. But just because a network appears under 
Available Networks does not mean it’s automatically added to the Preferred 
Networks list.
Connecting with your peers
Most wireless networks are called access 
point, or infrastructure, networks. That means 
your computer connects to the Internet 
through a wireless router or other access 
point. Chances are, this is how you’ll set up 
your wireless network.
But there’s another way (isn’t there always?) 
you can create a wireless network by con­
necting two or more computers together. A 
computer-to-computer network lets you skip 
wireless network routers and other access 
points. Instead, PCs talk directly with one 
another, transmitting and receiving data 
through their network adapters.
A computer-to-computer network is also 
known as a peer-to-peer or ad hoc network. 
One name wasn’t enough, so the Lords of 
Geekdom bestowed it with three names.
The obvious advantage is cost: You don’t pay 
for as much networking hardware. One com­
puter usually serves as the gateway to your 
Internet connection, assuming some of the 
duties of a dedicated hardware router. Peer-to-
peer networking also is handy for connecting 
a PC to a wireless print server, or networking 
two TiVo units.
If all you want is to wirelessly connect to PCs 
in your home, it may be the answer. I discuss 
the actual set up of these networks in Book III, 
Chapter 1.

Book III 
Chapter 2
Managing Available

155
Managing Preferred Networks
Of course, the Add a network feature lets you do more than just add your 
own network. For example, let’s say that you’ve been using a new wireless 
connection that is available to you, but your computer insists on always 
looking for, and connecting to, an older wireless connection. You can add 
this network while it’s in range, and it adds it to the list of preferred wireless 
connections. From there, you can use the Move up and Move down buttons 
to rank its priority. You can also create an ad hoc connection (computer-to-
computer) from the Add a network feature in this page.
Adding a preferred network
Follow these steps to add a preferred network:
	
1.	 Click the Add button.
	
	 A Wireless Network Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.
	
2.	 Enter the network’s name and other details.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 You’re done. That’s all there is to adding a preferred network.

Removing a preferred network
This is how you remove a preferred network:
	
1.	 Select the network you want to remove.
	
2.	 Click the Remove button.

Viewing an Available Network’s Signal Strength
Viewing a network’s properties
You can view a preferred network’s properties by following these steps:
	
1.	 Select a preferred network.
	
2.	 Click Properties.
	
	 That now-familiar Wireless Network Properties dialog box appears. 
Make whatever changes, additions, or deletions you like to properties.
	
3.	 Click OK to finish.
Reordering preferred networks
Windows (XP, Vista, and 7) starts with the first network and moves down, so 
you’ll want your most-used networks toward the top of the list. Here’s how 
to move preferred networks on the list:
	
1.	 Select a preferred network.
	
2.	 Click either Move Up or Move Down. You can also drag-and-drop a 
network from the list to its preferred location in Vista.
	
	 The preferred network is reordered in the Preferred Networks list.
	
3.	 Repeat as many times as necessary to rearrange the order of preferred 
networks.
Now you’ve reordered your life — or at least your list of preferred networks. 
It’s a good start, though!
Viewing an Available Network’s Signal Strength
You’ll be happy to know there’s a simple way to view the strength of your 
wireless network’s signal. It doesn’t provide a great deal of information, but 
it’s enough to know whether you ought to, say, move your wireless router 
closer to your computers.
A good time to check your network’s signal strength is when you first set it 
up and anytime you move your PCs or other network hardware. By moving 
components just a few feet from their original positions, you might find that 
the signal strength drops. In that case, you can scurry about, putting every­
thing back in place.
Then, with thinking cap firmly applied, you can reconsider where you’ll 
move your equipment.
There are other software and hardware tools for viewing your network’s 
signal strength. I’ll discuss them in a later chapter.

Viewing an Available Network’s Signal Strength
To view a simple but helpful visual graphic showing your network’s signal 
strength, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Mouse-over the network icon in the Window notification area.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears.
	
2.	 Look at your computer’s connections; the strength is displayed next to 
your network’s name.
	
	 A small bar graph provides a quick look at the strength of your wireless 
network’s signal, as shown in Figure 2-8. If four or five bars are high­
lighted, you’re enjoying strong, robust signal reception.
	
Figure 2-8: 
With 
four bars 
highlighted, 
this network 
is cranking. 	
	
	 If three or fewer bars are highlighted, you have a pretty weak wireless 
connection. Read Book IV, Chapter 3, which helps you solve wireless 
network problems like this one.
On the road again
Many of the topics tackled in this chapter also 
apply to mobile computing. When you’re in 
an airport, for example, you hopefully see one 
or more wireless networks available for 
your use — although some or all may require 
payment.
When you’re in an airport or other public area 
(or even in one of your company’s offices) 
where you expect to return on a future trip, 
you can add the network to the list of preferred 
networks. If you need to make any special con­
figurations for accessing a particular network, 
you can save them for the next time you con­
nect to the same network.
Monitoring signal strength becomes even 
more important on the road. Here are some 
examples:
	✓	 By moving just 50 feet to a new loca­
tion, your airport connection may grow 
stronger.
	✓	 If you’re in a strange office, you may not 
know that the steel walls are blocking a 
nearby network. By moving around and 
checking signal strength on your laptop, 
you find the best spot for (wireless) 
networking.

Book III: Configuring Networks

Chapter 3: Creating Bridges
In This Chapter
✓	Bridging two or more networks
✓	Building the bridge with hardware
✓	Doing what you wish with a bridge
N
o, this isn’t a chapter on civil engineering. And I’m not going to tell 
you how to build a bridge on the River Kwai, although I may in an 
upcoming sequel. (Naturally, I’ll be playing William Holden’s part after I 
shed a few pounds.) Instead, this chapter is about bridging two or more 
networks.
Huh? A bridge is software or hardware that connects two or more different 
networks together.
Huh is exactly what I said when I first learned about creating a bridge 
between, say, a wired Ethernet network and a wireless network. What is it? 
Why do I need it? Is the Big Bang overrated?
If all goes well, instead of “Huh?” your response by the end of this chapter 
will be “Duh!” These are times when I would want to bridge two or more 
networks:
	
✦	 You’re adding a wireless network and want it to piggyback on an exist­
ing wired Ethernet network. The wireless network has access to the 
same things — hardware and data — as the wired network does.
	
✦	 You want to bridge two wired Ethernet networks. This occurs mostly 
in business environments, but it could occur in a home, too. The wired 
networks are physically separated and the most convenient way to con­
nect them is by creating a bridge.
	
✦	 You want to extend the range of a wireless network. By bridging two 
wireless access points, you can expand the signal range without laying 
any wires.
You can use a wireless access point as a bridge, if the access point’s hard­
ware is equipped to handle the task. Not all wireless access points can be 
used as a bridge; it must specifically say it can be used as one.

160
Bridging with Windows Vista
Bridging with Windows Vista
Windows Vista makes it easy to create a bridge between two or more net­
works connected to the same computer.
You need a network adapter, which serves as a communications point 
between your computer and the network, for each network you want to 
bridge. If you’re bridging a wired network with a wireless network, your com­
puter needs two adapter cards: one for the wired network and one for the 
wireless network.
Creating a bridge
Use the following steps to bridge two networks in Windows Vista:
	
1.	 Click Start.
	
	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Network and Sharing Center; click Manage network connections 
from the Tasks list.
	
	 The Network Connections dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1. 
Be sure not to click Network from the Start menu; it opens the Network 
page. (I know, it gets confusing!)
	
3.	 Select the networks you want to bridge.
	
	 The networks you select are highlighted. You can select multiple con­
nections by holding down the Ctrl key as you click each network.

	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Network and Sharing Center; click Manage network connections 
from the Tasks list.
	
	 The Network Connections dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Right-click the network you want to add to the bridge and select Add 
to Bridge.
	
	 Windows Vista adds the network to the bridge. The Status column in the 
Network Connections column shows Bridged once the network has been 
added to the bridge, and it also appears in the Network Bridge section of 
the page.
Removing a network from a bridge

Chapter 4: Configuring Printers
In This Chapter
✓	Sharing a printer on your network
✓	Adding a network printer
✓	Switching the default printer
A
 wireless network is about more than just sharing Internet access 
and your multimedia files. You also can do things like share a printer 
among all the computers on your wireless network. I don’t need to tell you 
how helpful that can be these days, especially when more and more house­
holds are using multiple computers.
In this chapter, I explain how to set up printer sharing across a network, as 
well as how to add a new printer and change the default printer.
Learning to Share
You can add and select printers that you will use over your wireless net­
work. For instance, you might be sharing a laser printer on your network 
and want to add a color inkjet printer that’s connected to another computer 
to your network. Here’s how to share a local printer on your entire network:
	
1.	 Click Start.
	
	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Control Panel.
	
	 The Control Panel appears.
	
3.	 Click Printer in the Hardware and Sound section.
	
4.	 Do one of the following:
 
• Right-click the printer you want to share and select Sharing.
 
• Click Change sharing options and confirm the operation.
	
5.	 Select the Share This Printer button.

166
Learning to Share
	
6.	 Type a name for the shared printer, in the text box as shown in 
Figure 4-1.
	
	 Try to choose a name that’s meaningful to you and to others who use 
the network. Printer is simple, but not very meaningful, especially if you 
have more than one printer on the network. Better examples include 
Upstairs Laser and Basement Color.
	
Figure 4-1: 
A 
meaningful 
name is 
better than 
a short 
name.
	
	
	 There is no longer a character limitation when naming your shared 
printer; however, be mindful that there are some characters that cannot 
be used. For example, the uses of slashes or other special characters 
are not allowed. If you use an illegal character, don’t worry about it, 
Windows shows you the error of your ways. It is then up to you to cor­
rect it. It’s important to learn from one’s mistakes.
	
7.	 Click OK.
	
	 An image of two people appears, which fortunately replaces the open-
palm hand that appears superimposed on the printer’s icon, as shown 
in Figure 4-2. (I think the shared icon looks like a guy in a rather boring 
family portrait, but that’s me. I may die young from cynicism, but at least 
there won’t be any nasty surprises ahead.)
	
	 You’re all done here. Move along, move along.

Feeling Selfish and Turning Off Sharing
Just as you giveth, you can taketh. It may occasionally be a good idea to turn 
off your printer sharing. For example, if you know that you’re running a bit 
low on ink or paper (and hey, those cost a lot of money these days!), you may 
want to limit access to your printer. If you know that you’re going to be tying 
up the printer for a few hours and can’t bear the thought of anyone encroach­
ing on your territory (or simply sliding in a quick print job), then you may 
want to pick up your marbles and go home, or simply un-share your printer.
If, after setting up printer sharing on your network, you decide that you no 
longer want to share the printer, you can easily switch it off. Just follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 Click Start.
	
	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Control Panel.
	
	 The Control Panel appears.
	
3.	 Click Printer in the Hardware and Sound section.
	
4.	 Do one of the following:
 
• Right-click the printer you want to share and select Sharing.
 
• Click Change sharing options and confirm the operation.

168
Adding a Network Printer
	
5.	 Deselect the Share This Printer button.
	
6.	 Click OK.
	
	 The sharing symbol disappears from the printer’s icon. That’s it for 
switching off printer sharing. If you want to add a network printer, 
mosey on over to the next section, please.
Adding a Network Printer
Windows Vista usually installs printers for you automatically if you’re con­
necting the printer directly to your PC; if you’ve been around computers 
since the Windows XP (or even Windows 95) days, then you likely know this. 
Of course, this might not be enough. There are other computers out there 
just waiting for you to print your prose. If you want to add the ability to use 
a printer that’s connected to another computer on your network, rather than 
one connected directly to your computer, you need to follow these instruc­
tions for each printer you want to add.
Sharing must be enabled before you can add a network printer. You must 
enable sharing from the computer that connects to the printer you want to 
share.
To add a new network printer, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click Start.
	
	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Control Panel.
	
	 The Control Panel appears.
	
3.	 Click Printer in the Hardware and Sound section.
	
4.	 Click Add a Printer from the menu just under the file menu.
	
	 The Add Printer wizard appears.
	
5.	 Click Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer.
	
	 The list of available printers appears, as shown in Figure 4-3.
	
6.	 Select a printer and go to Step 7; otherwise, if you cannot find the 
printer you want, click The Printer I Want Isn’t Listed option and 
carry on.
	
7.	 Do one of the following:
 
• Select Browse for a Printer if you don’t know the printer’s name and 
network address.

Book III 
Chapter 4

169
Adding a Network Printer
 
• Use Select a shared printer by name, if you know the printer’s name, 
and Add a printer using a TCP/IP address if you know the network 
address. Skip to Step 10.
	
	 The Browse for Printer dialog box appears.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Selecting 
a network 
printer.
	
	
8.	 Wait for the newly selected printer to go ahead and configure, and 
think of a new name for your printer.
	
9.	 Type the name in the dialog box shown in Figure 4-4 (or leave the 
default name, it’s really up to you!) and then click Next.
	
	 The congratulatory message appears, letting you know that your 
network printer is now installed.

10.	 Do one of the following:
 
• Select Finish if you want to finish any remaining work with the 
wizard.
 
• Select Print a test page if you want to make sure your new printer 
really works!
	
You just added a network printer to your personal computing arsenal!
Changing the Default Printer
You can change the printer that Windows Vista uses as its default printer. The 
default printer is the one where your print jobs automatically go. Although you 
can always choose another printer on the network (if there is one), doing noth­
ing means your default printer handles the job.
Usually, your default printer is your local printer (the one hooked up to your 
computer), but you can choose to make a network printer the default printer. Of 
course, you may want to look twice and make sure that you’re online; otherwise 
it’s likely that your network printers won’t appear. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	 Click Start.
	
	 The Start menu appears.
	
2.	 Click Control Panel.
	
	 The Control Panel appears.
	
3.	 Click Printer in the Hardware and Sound section.
	
4.	 Right-click the printer you want to have as your default printer.
	
5.	 Select Set as Default Printer.
	
	 A white check mark on a green circle appears on the printer icon. It indi­
cates that the printer is now the default printer, as shown in Figure 4-5. 
You’re done.

Your Network Works
In This Chapter
✓	Checking your signal strength
✓	Monitoring your network’s activity
✓	Avoiding possible signal obstacles
✓	Handling interference
“E
ureka!” That’s what you hope comes out of your mouth after setting 
up a wireless network. You may want to yell from the rooftops, or 
wherever you can find the tallest antennae that your new wireless network 
is running without any problems. Hold that thought: First check on your 
network’s health. That includes viewing the signal strength as well as moni­
toring its activity (that is, the network traffic). After all, what’s the point of 
having a wireless network if it is an underachiever?
Flexing Your Signal Strength
You’ll be happy to know of a simple way to view the strength of your wire­
less network’s signal. This method doesn’t provide a great deal of informa­
tion, but it’s enough to know whether you ought to move your wireless 
router closer to your computers. Sometimes that’s all you really need to 
know. Don’t forget — a wireless connection is always weaker than a tradi­
tional, wired connection. In other words, you’ll experience slower download 
speeds than a wired connection. That’s why it’s important to make sure 
your signal strength is as strong as possible, to guarantee the best possible 
results from your wireless network.
You should check your signal strength at two different times:
	
✦	 When you first set up your network
	
✦	 Anytime you move your PCs or other network hardware
Moving components just a few feet from their original positions may cause 
signal strength to drop. In that case you can scurry about, putting everything 
back in place. Then, with thinking cap firmly applied, you can reconsider 

172
Flexing Your Signal Strength
where you’ll move your equipment. You also have to take in to account the 
realities of where you installed your network; for example, the layout of your 
house if this is a home network. For example, I live in a building from the early 
1800s; the walls are quite thick, so if I put my laptop on my desk, next to the 
wall, I don’t get a very good signal. If I move my laptop just a few feet behind 
me, the signal jumps to full strength.
Windows Vista has several built-in tools for testing your network. I discuss 
these in Book IV, Chapter 3.
To view a simple but helpful visual, just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Right-click the network icon in the Windows Vista notification area.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears.
	
2.	 Identify the desired network.
	
	 Next to the network connection is a small bar graph that provides a 
quick look at the strength of your wireless network’s signal, as shown 
in Figure 5-1. If four or five bars are highlighted, you’re enjoying robust 
signal reception. This is much easier than in past versions of Windows, 
where you actually had a procedure to work your way through simply to 
see if you had a decent connection or not.
	
Figure 5-1: 
With 
four bars 
highlighted, 
this network 
is cranking.
	
	
	 If only three or fewer bars are highlighted, you have a pretty weak wire­
less connection. You’ll want to read Book IV, Chapter 3, which helps you 
solve wireless network problems like this one.
	
3.	 When you’re done viewing your signal strength, move your mouse 
away from the pop-up menu.
	
You can also find out the strength of your network using a more procedure-
intensive way. The Network and Sharing Center, shown in Figure 5-2, opens 
and tells the strength with text. Here’s how that text breaks down compared 
to the bar graph:
	
✦	 Excellent: Your network is just full of energy. This is equivalent to four 
or five bars.

Book III
Chapter 5
Confirming Your 
Network Works
173
Monitoring Your Network
	
✦	 Good: Your network is doing a fine job. This is equivalent to three bars.
	
✦	 Fair: Your network is doing an OK job, but it’s not living up to its poten­
tial. This is equivalent to two bars.
	
✦	 Poor: Your network is an underachiever. You may want to start shifting 
things, because you likely only have one bar.
	
Figure 5-2: 
The 
Network 
and Sharing 
Center 
also shows 
signal 
strength.
	
A more sophisticated way of measuring signal strength is discussed a little 
later in this chapter. Using a third-party software program, you can get a 
pretty accurate read on the strength of nearby Wi-Fi access points.
Monitoring Your Network
After you’ve decided which wireless networks you want to connect to, some 
Windows Vista tools can monitor those networks. One of these tools is in 
the same dialog box that shows your signal strength. Another is a real-time 
graphical network monitor that’s part of Windows Task Manager. In the fol­
lowing sections you learn how to use these tools. Most people use these 
tools simply to establish that their network is up and running properly. For 
example, if your network seems a bit sluggish, these tools will show you 
whether or not data is getting in or out.
Viewing your network’s activity
In the Wireless Network Connection Status dialog box, you can see how 
much data is moving in and out of a PC over your wireless network.

174
Monitoring Your Network
Here’s how you view it:
	
1.	 Confirm that your wireless network is enabled.
	
	 If it’s not, enable it. If you’re also running a wired network, disable it. If 
you’re using a laptop computer, it may be as simple as flipping a switch.
	
2.	 Right-click the network icon in Windows Vista notification area.
	
	 A pop-up menu appears.
	
3.	 Select Network and Sharing Center.
	
	 The Network and Sharing Center appears.
	
4.	 Click View status on the Connection row of your wireless connection.
	
	 Select the General tab if it’s not already selected.
	
5.	 The Wireless Connection Status window appears.
	
	 In the Activity area you can monitor bytes sent and received, as shown 
in Figure 5-3. If there’s a number below Sent but a zero is beneath 
Received, your wireless network may not be working properly. If there 
are at least three-digit numbers under both Sent and Received, your net­
work should work.
	
6.	 Click Close.
	
	 That’s it for one view of network activity!
	
Figure 5-3:

Viewing a real-time networking graph
To monitor your wireless network, just follow these steps:

Book III 
Chapter 5

175
Monitoring Your Network
	
1.	 Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
	
	 This is affectionately known by many as the Vulcan death grip. But in 
Windows Vista, instead of immediately rebooting your PC, it displays the 
Windows Task Manager dialog box. If that still freaks you out, you can 
always use Ctrl+Shift+Esc or right-click an open space on the Windows 
taskbar and go on to Step 2.
	
2.	 Select Task Manager.
	
	 You see several tabs at the top of the dialog box. By default, you are in 
the Applications tab.
	
3.	 Select the Networking tab.
	
	 A graph like that in Figure 5-4 shows your wireless network’s activity in 
real time. In this example my wireless network is using about 1 percent 
of its capacity. The bandwidth I’m using appears consistent because I’m 
streaming music over the Internet.
	
Figure 5-4: 
A graphics 
display 
shows your

while a 
text area 
supplies 
other useful 
information.
	
	
	 If you also have a wired Ethernet network active, you see two graphic 
windows. One window shows the wired network while the other window 
shows the wireless network.
	
	 The bottom window shows a bunch of information about your wireless 
network. For starters, you see the Adapter Name, Network Utilization, 
Link Speed, and several columns displaying your network’s throughput 
(how much of the network’s capacity is actually being used).

176
Monitoring Your Network
	
4.	 When you’re done viewing your wireless network’s activity, close the 
Task Manager.
	
	 That’s it! See how easy it is to monitor your wireless network’s activity?
Changing the networking information you see
When viewing the Networking screen in Windows Task Manager, you see 
some detailed text information below the glitzy graphical display. It’s easy to 
change the columns displayed there:
	
1.	 In the Windows Task Manager, choose View➪Select Columns.
	
	 The Select Networking Page Columns dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-5.
	
Figure 5-5: 
Choosing 
the 
information 
you’ll see 
in the 
networking 
graph
	
	
2.	 Select or deselect the boxes next to columns you want to display.
	
	 The default selections are usually sufficient. However, you may want 
to see something specific, or your network administrator may ask you 
to add columns while diagnosing a problem with your network. For 
example, you might want to see the number of bytes that were sent or 
received in order to see exactly how much data has been flowing across 
your network.
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
	 Any column changes appear in the text area.
	
4.	 If you added columns, you may need to resize the Windows Task 
Manager dialog box to see them. Point the mouse over the Task 
Manager’s outline until you see a double-headed arrow and click and 
drag to resize.

Stumbling Upon NetStumbler
	
5.	 Close the dialog box when you’re done viewing the Networking 
screen.
	
	 You’re done — and you’re one step closer to becoming an experienced 
wireless network administrator.
Stumbling Upon NetStumbler
Although you can get a rough reading on your signal strength from Windows 
and monitor your network, another tool gives you a more detailed view: 
NetStumbler. It’s free for home users (commercial and government users 
are encouraged to donate $50 per copy). This application is recommended 
for any users who are still working with Windows XP. At the time of print­
ing, NetStumbler does not support Windows Vista, which makes support for 
Windows 7 even less likely.
Written by Marius Milner, NetStumbler runs under Windows and monitors 
the signal strength of nearby access points. You can select an access point 
and NetStumbler displays a real-time graph showing the strength.
You can use it on your desktop PC to see if it’s close enough to the transmit­
ter and if the signal is too noisy, which indicates interference or physical 
obstacles. Better yet, you can install the software on a laptop computer, 
moving around your house or business to measure signal strength in various 
places.
Downloading and installing NetStumbler
To download the program, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to www.netstumbler.com.
	
	 The NetStumbler Web page loads.
	
2.	 Click Downloads (located on the left side of the main menu).
	
	 The Downloads page appears.
	
3.	 Click NetStumbler and save the program to your desktop or to another 
location you can remember.
	
4.	 Double-click the downloaded NetStumbler setup program.
	
	 The Setup dialog box displays the license agreement, once Windows 
Vista knows that it’s fine to install the program.
	
5.	 After reading the agreement, click I Agree.
	
	 The Choose Components screen appears.

178
Stumbling Upon NetStumbler
	
6.	 Select the type of installation.
	
	 Complete is the default type.
	
7.	 Click Next.
	
	 The Choose Install Location screen appears.
	
8.	 If the installation directory is acceptable, click Install.
	
	 You can click Browse to choose another directory. The program installs 
when you click Install.
	
9.	 When it says Installation Complete, click Close.
Using other apps
Windows offers some solid, yet not stellar, networking monitoring tools, as 
we’ve seen in this chapter. Some other viable alternatives are available if 
you want to get a second opinion.
Be careful, not all third-party applications are decent quality simply because 
they’re “not” Windows. Also, many are likely to either come at some cost 
and work only for a limited amount of time (either a full- or limited-access 
version). Be sure to check into such details before trying other applications.
For Windows Vista users, or any Windows 7 early adopters, you may 
want to try WirelessMon. This application, which is also available on a trial 
basis, works well under Windows Vista (even 64-bit). It is available at www.
passmark.com.
The best advice I can give you is to perform a Web search for network moni­
toring applications and see what works best for you. Many applications offer 
the same or similar features for varying prices. In many cases, it’s simply a 
question of personal preference.

Chapter 1: Looking 
at Internet Threats
In This Chapter
✓	Understanding the threats
✓	Discovering who the bad guys are
✓	Understanding the security tradeoffs
T
he Internet is a great place; you can read about any subject you want to 
(and many you wish you’d never heard of). You can buy anything online 
and have it delivered to your door. You’ve got immediate access to your 
bank, credit cards, investments, and other financial information. Heck, you 
don’t have to leave the house if you don’t want to.
With all these new ways of doing business on the Internet come people 
trying to make a dishonest buck. On the Internet, some people are trying to 
part you from your hard-earned money without leaving their keyboard.
Not to scare you, but a whole lot of bad stuff is on the Internet. Fortunately, 
knowing about it goes a long way to avoiding it.
Finding Out about Bad Software
Software is the stuff you load on your computer to do work and have fun. 
Your word processor, Web browser, and spreadsheet are all software. 
Someone (or a group of people) sat down and wrote the software with the 
goal of trying to solve a problem you had in exchange for you buying the 
software.
What if those people didn’t care about helping you, but thought they could 
write software that stole your online bank account number and password? 
Or what if they just thought it would be fun to delete all the files on your 
hard drive?
Software like this is called malware, which is short for malicious software. 
(Have you ever noticed how computer people like to make up words?) 
Malware is any software that intentionally does harm to a computer, without 
the computer owner’s consent.

182
Finding Out about Bad Software
There are many different types of malware out there, and I cover these in the 
following sections.
Understanding viruses
In the physical world, someone gets sick, coughs on you, and the next thing 
you know, you’re in bed for a couple of days. Computer viruses are much the 
same, just without the bonus of time off work.
When you happen to run a piece of infected software, the virus tries to rep­
licate itself. Maybe it infects a few other programs on your system, maybe 
it hijacks your e-mail client and e-mails itself to 100 of your closest friends. 
Either way, the virus tries to make its way onto other machines.
Before the Internet, viruses traveled pretty slowly because you’d have to 
share the program over a floppy disk to move the virus around. With the 
advent of the Internet, viruses started incorporating network functionality.
Viruses aren’t limited to programs, such as games and word processors. 
They can be hidden in e-mail attachments that look normal, or inside docu­
ments themselves. Newer viruses don’t even need to be run; they spread by 
taking advantage of network services built into your machine.
One day in 1999 people started to get e-mails from friends containing a 
Microsoft Word document as an attachment. As soon as the document was 
opened, special code called a macro was run that made the user’s e-mail 
software send the virus to the first 50 people in the user’s address book.
This virus was very effective for several reasons:
	
✦	 The e-mail came from the victim, so people were inclined to trust it.
	
✦	 People weren’t careful in what they opened because nothing like this 
had ever happened before.
	
✦	 It took very little effort on the user’s behalf to propagate the virus 
because the macros were an integrated part of the word processor.
Viruses don’t necessarily do damage by themselves; what matters is the pay­
load. If the virus’ objective in life is to replicate, it’s merely annoying. If the 
payload deletes your computer’s files on April Fool’s Day, that would be bad.
Getting protection from viruses
Software called anti-virus software runs on your computer and is constantly 
on the lookout for virus activity. Most anti-virus (AV) software inspect all the 
files on your hard drive periodically and also give a quick scan to any pro­
grams you run, at the time that you run them.

Book IV
Chapter 1
Looking at Internet 
Threats
183
Finding Out about Bad Software
I cover AV software later in this chapter. Not only do you need it, but you 
need to keep it up to date. AV software works by looking for signatures, or 
patterns, of viruses. To update your AV software means to get the latest set 
of signatures. Fortunately for you, any decent AV package will automate this.
The second way to keep virus-free is to keep on top of your operating system 
patches. In late 2008 and early 2009, a virus called Conficker was running 
around the Internet. Conficker spread by many different means, but one of 
the most effective was by exploiting a problem with Windows that had been 
patched several months prior. Because most people didn’t install the latest 
operating system updates, they were vulnerable. We look at patching in the 
next chapter.
Finally, the first line of defense against virus infection is to use your head. If 
you receive a random e-mail with an attachment, don’t open the attachment. 
Only get software from reputable sources, or friends. And use your anti-virus 
software to scan things after you download them.
Spyware and adware
Spyware and adware are two types of malware that hide in the background 
and try to make money for the creator. Spyware tracks the Web sites you go 
to and uses that data to make money. The author might be interested in the 
data themselves, or they might be able to sell the information to someone 
who is.
Adware is software that displays advertising inside it. This initially wasn’t 
bad — some instant messaging services originally displayed small ads to 
keep their service running. As usual, though, people started writing code 
that would force itself upon the machine and change the ads that a user 
saw. For example, an ad for jewelry on a Web site might be replaced with an 
ad for something else, with the owner of the adware getting a cut if you buy 
anything.
This last scenario might seem like it’s not a problem; but even so, adware 
takes up resources on your computer and makes it slower. Adware also 
cheats Internet businesses out of their money.
Other types of spyware, called keyloggers, take your keystrokes and send 
them to the creator. This includes anything you typed into your online bank­
ing site.
The lines between adware and spyware have blurred to the point where it’s 
all generally called spyware now. Whatever it’s called, you don’t want it on 
your computer.
Most of the lesser forms of spyware come from toolbars that you randomly 
happen across on your Internet travels. Anything offering free smileys, “free 

184
Finding Out about Bad Software
screensavers, or something that enhances your Web browsing experience 
with a free deal finder toolbar probably contains some hidden nastiness. The 
program may work as advertised, but it will probably leave spyware that will 
be around long after you get bored with the software you downloaded.
These spyware packages are often distributed through a technology called 
ActiveX that is only supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer. There are 
few ActiveX components that are worth using, and a good part of the rest is 
spyware.
Spyware is often found in illegal downloads, especially software that pur­
ports to crack the copy protection on various legitimate pieces of software. 
Say what you will about the legal aspects of copyright protection, but the 
level of malware out there is atrocious.
Somewhat tied to the illegal downloads of software is downloads of illegal 
movies. The movies themselves don’t contain anything bad because they’re 
just data. However, trying to view the movie prompts you to download 
some software to properly decode it in the form of a piece of software 
called a codec. Guess what’s in that software? Figure 1-1 shows a user being 
prompted to download a new codec in order to watch a copy of a new movie 
that was downloaded over the Internet.
	
Figure 1-1: 
A prompt to 
download a 
codec.
	
Does the codec contain malware? To find out, you should enter some of the 
details into your favorite search engine and see what other people have to 
say. Or, just stay away from media files like that.

Finding Out about Bad Software
Be selective about what you download and run. No matter what the ad says, 
you can’t download a current version of Microsoft Office for only $4. Even if 
it does contain an illegal version of Office, it’s bound to contain a bunch of 
nasty malware that you don’t want.
Try to find an anti-virus package that includes anti-spyware functionality, 
too. This software tries to block the installation of the spyware and also 
prevents spyware from calling home to transmit the sensitive data that was 
stolen.
	
Don’t download any extensions to Internet Explorer. In fact, don’t run 
Internet Explorer at all. Firefox is a much faster browser and does not suffer 
from as many attacks as Internet Explorer. Whichever browser you choose, 
make sure you’re up to date.
	
Be careful when installing software that has been suggested from a recent 
download. When you are prompted to download anything, take a moment to 
research what is being offered to make sure it’s not malware.
Zombies and botnets
The final stop in our whirlwind tour of bad software brings us to zombies 
and botnets. In the movies, zombies are dead people that have been reani­
mated and spend their time looking for tasty human brains to eat. They’re 
especially fond of groups of people who decided to split up so that they 
could find a way out of the abandoned building faster. I’ve never understood 
why people do that.
Anyway, a zombie computer is one that has been infected with some sort of 
malware that allows it to be controlled remotely. The infection is such that 
the owner of the computer doesn’t know what’s going on because the com­
puter operates normally (but maybe slower).
Take a few thousand (or a few hundred thousand) of these zombified com­
puters and you have yourself a botnet. The people who run these botnets 
make their zombie computers send e-mail spam, try to defraud advertisers, 
and even try to take down major Web sites. They may do this for their own 
uses or rent out their botnet to people who are in need of such services.
Needless to say, you don’t want your computer to be a zombie! There’s no 
upside, and you don’t want to be giving out system resources for sending 
spam and taking down Web sites.
Zombie software gets on your computer the same way that other malware 
gets there, such as through strange e-mail attachments or in infected files 
taken from unscrupulous Web sites.

186
Avoiding Bad People
Avoiding Bad People
The last section talked about bad software. Bad people made that software, 
but there’s another class of bad guys that are out to scam you directly.
Most of these schemes aren’t new; they’re just some old classics that have 
been adapted for the Internet. People have been writing bad checks for 
decades: the Internet just allows them to expand their reach.
Spam
If you’ve had an e-mail address for more than 10 minutes, then you’ve seen 
some spam. Spam is an unsolicited commercial e-mail, which is a fancy way 
of saying that someone you don’t know sent you an e-mail trying to sell you 
something.
The nature of e-mail means that it costs about the same to send out a million 
e-mails as it does a handful. There are no stamps to buy, no envelopes to 
stuff, and no address labels to print. A single computer can generate thou­
sands of spam e-mails per hour, and if you use the services of a botnet, you 
can blast out a few million e-mails in no time at all.
Spam is sometimes hard to differentiate from regular commercial e-mail. 
Sometimes you get added to a mailing list from a company that you dealt 
with, and you start getting a monthly newsletter. As inconvenient as it is, 
spam is a much bigger problem.
The idea behind spamming is that the spammer sends out an offer for a 
product. The types of products usually associated with spam are
	
✦	 Pharmaceuticals, especially male performance enhancing pills
	
✦	 Knockoff watches or clothing
	
✦	 Illegal software
	
✦	 Financial products such as loans
	
✦	 University degrees
All good stuff, right?
Spam is bad for several reasons, including
	
✦	 The sheer volume of spam makes your ISP do extra work to process the 
e-mail, and you do more work to find the e-mails you’re really looking 
for. This makes e-mail less efficient as a communications medium.
	
✦	 The way that spammers send the e-mails out is often destructive to mail 
servers.

Book IV 
Chapter 1
Looking at Internet 
Threats
187
Avoiding Bad People
	
✦	 The products being sold are usually a scam, illegal, or just plain low 
quality.
As tempting as it may be to be able to lose weight with only a small pill being 
sold at a ridiculously low rate, stay away.
	
Also be careful about how you give out your e-mail address. Posting to 
public forms sometimes exposes your address, which spammers harvest for 
their lists. Free Web-based e-mail providers are plentiful; it helps to have a 
separate account for posting to public forums.
Spam is often the vehicle for phishing attacks, which I look at next.
Phishing
Ever received an e-mail from your bank telling you that it was important that 
you go to their Web site and fill in some missing personal information? Ever 
received the same information from a different bank, one that you don’t deal 
with?
These e-mails were probably part of a phishing scam. Phishing is a play on 
fishing, as in “fishing for suckers who will give me their bank information” 
(and another made up word!) With this personal information the bad guy 
can get into your bank account or can get credit cards in your name (also 
called identity theft).
Here’s a step-by-step look at a scam:
	
1.	 Bad guy sets up a Web page that looks a lot like a particular bank’s Web 
site, with a form asking for your credit card number, social security 
number, mother’s maiden name, bank PIN, and anything else he can 
think of.
	
2.	 The bad guy sends out millions of e-mails that look official and that ask 
you to visit your bank’s Web page using the link in the e-mail.
	
3.	 You just happen to use that bank, so you click on the link and fill in the 
form.
	
4.	 The bad guy cleans out your bank account from the safety of an Internet 
café in a foreign land.
That e-mail from the bank may look authentic, but here’s what you might not 
know:
	
✦	 Making an e-mail look like it came from whoever you want, including 
your bank, is easy.
	
✦	 Making an e-mail look official and important is easy.

188
Avoiding Bad People
	
✦	 Making the link shown on the screen take you to a different site is easy.
	
✦	 Scammers can use many ways to trick people into thinking they’re on 
their bank’s Web site, when in fact they’re on the bad guy’s site.
Figure 1-2 is an e-mail that looks like it came from an auction site I use. It 
looks a lot like other e-mails that come from the site, but if you look where 
my mouse is hovering on the link, and the link that shows up in the status 
bar, they’re different!
	
Figure 1-2: 
An e-mail 
from an 
online 
auction site. 
Or is it?
	
What’s happening here is that the phisher is trying to trick me into going to 
his site, where he’ll try to get me to log in using my real username and pass­
word, at which point he can do bad stuff.
That hover trick is not always reliable, though. The only way to be certain is 
to copy and paste the URL that shows on the screen instead of clicking.
If you are presented with such an e-mail, it pays to view it with some skepti­
cism. Keep the following in mind:
	
✦	 Some sites that are especially prone to phishing attacks will include 
your username in the subject or e-mail to show you it’s not a phishing 
scheme. If you don’t see this, beware.
	
✦	 Banks will not request personal information over an e-mail or on a 
random Internet page. When in doubt, call your bank and ask.

Book IV 
Chapter 1
Looking at Internet 
Threats
189
Avoiding Bad People
	
✦	 Most Web sites that deal with sensitive information post a policy on 
their Web page describing whether or not they do send such e-mails out 
and what sort of protections they use.
When in doubt, pick up the phone or just delete the e-mail.
If you use the Firefox Web browser, or Internet Explorer version 7 or later, it 
adds some additional phishing protection. Clicking on the link in the previ­
ous figure brings you to Figure 1-3.
	
Figure 1-3: 
Trying to 
view a 
phishing 
site.
	
This screen is presented by your Web browser, and it indicates that the site 
in question is known to be a phishing site. It’s not perfect, but it’s an addi­
tional layer of protection.
Be very careful about what private information you give over the Internet, no 
matter what format. Scammers are getting cleverer. Identity theft is serious 
and can cause you a lot of trouble.
Rebills
The rebill, or the negative option billing scam, is usually legal but very shady.
The essence of the scam is that you sign up for a free trial of some prod­
uct and only have to pay a couple of dollars shipping. What you missed in 
the reams of fine print is that after your trial expires, you’ll be charged a 
hefty sum every month to continue on the program. It’s usually a couple of 
months before you know and can get off the program.
This type of deal has been around for a while, especially for music clubs. 
The scammy version is different, though:
	
✦	 The terms of the agreement are not made clear. You might have to go to 
another page or scroll down to see the catch.

190
Avoiding Bad People
	
✦	 Often the trial starts from the day you sign up, not from when you get 
the product. People find that their credit card has been billed for the 
first month before they’ve even received the trial item.
	
✦	 The product itself is poor, either by not living up to the medical claims 
made or, in the case of make-money-fast type offers, is simply public 
domain information.
	
✦	 The company’s contact information is not made clear in case you want 
to complain or cancel your subscription.
	
✦	 It takes several hours of dialing to get through to customer service to 
get off the product.
These types of scams are all over, from advertising on popular Web sites to 
spam. Often you see the product on a personal Web site from a person pur­
porting to have used the product to lose weight or make thousands of dol­
lars. This person probably doesn’t exist; the seller has just made them up to 
try and get you to sign up for the trial.
	
Beware of anything offering a free trial that requires a shipping charge, and 
always check the fine print. Check your credit card balance online periodi­
cally (having a separate credit card for Internet purchases is also helpful), 
and call your credit card company at the first sign of abuse.
Another version of this involves your cell phone. You are given a free ring 
tone, or told that you need to provide your cell phone number to get the 
results of a test you just did. After you provide your cell phone number you 
are quietly signed up for a service on your cell phone that bills you every 
month.
You won the lottery!
Ever got an e-mail like one of the following?
	
✦	 Congratulations! You won the Internet lottery!
	
✦	 You have just inherited $1 million from a long-lost relative.
	
✦	 I need you to help me get $5 million out of my country. You can have 
40 percent for your efforts.
These are all scams.
The way these go is that you chat back and forth with the person, and at 
some point, they come up with a story for needing a few dollars, such as $50 
to process some paperwork. If you pay that, more charges keep piling up for 
various things until you realize you’ve been had. This is called the advance 
fee scam. See Figure 1-4 for an example.

Figure 1-4: 
The 
advance  
fee scam.
	
I really don’t think that Mr. Frank has the $6.3 million dollars. Just ignore 
e-mails like this.
These types of scams have been around for years, but the Internet has made 
it easier for scammers to find their victims. At one point many of the scam­
mers were based out of Nigeria, so you will find this called the Nigerian scam 
or the 419 scam (419 is the section of the Nigerian criminal code dealing with 
such fraud). An Internet search for these terms uncovers a variety of differ­
ent ruses used for the scam, along with some hilarious stories of people get­
ting the scammers to do all sorts of silly things.
Looking at the amount of spam I get involving this scam, I can only assume 
that people are still falling for it. Indeed, I have seen a few stories in the 
news. One person was taken for $150,000, which gives you some idea of how 
bad it can get.
Check washing and the overpayment scam
Check washing is a process where a check that has been written on has the 
payee and amount removed (washed off), and a new value and payee put 
on. This was around before the Internet, but again, the Internet has made it 
easier to find victims.
Intercepting the check is surprisingly easy, so the scammers have a wide 
variety of potentially blank checks to choose from.
This scam generally works two ways. The first is that you are offered a job 
to process paperwork at home, which ends up being to cash some company 

192
Avoiding Bad People
checks. You send the money to your “employer,” sometimes minus a small 
commission to you.
What has happened is that a legitimate check has been intercepted and 
washed, and your name has been put on it with a new dollar amount. You 
deposit the check, your bank advances you the funds, and then you send the 
money away. Usually you are told to use Western Union, which is an untrace­
able system.
Eventually the bank finds out when the check bounces and takes the money 
back from you. But you’ve already sent the money away!
The second way this happens is that you offer something for sale online, and 
someone buys it from you. When it comes time to pay they try to give you a 
check for more than the sale price with some excuse for why. You are asked 
to send the difference back to them.
Of course, the check bounces, and you’re out whatever you sold and the 
cash.
To avoid this scam:
	
✦	 Beware of any deal where you get a check and have to send money back.
	
✦	 Never accept a check in response to an online dealing unless you know 
the person. Look into trusted systems, such as PayPal.
	
✦	 Never send any payment to someone you don’t know by an untraceable 
method, such as Western Union.
	
✦	 Keep your checkbook safe and watch your bank account for the checks 
you issue. This will help prevent one of your checks from being used for 
the scam.
	
✦	 Remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Credit card stealing
Compared to all the other types of scams, this one is downright uninspiring:
	
1.	 You buy something online using your credit card.
	
2.	 The Web site you bought it from is hacked into and your credit card 
number is stolen.
	
3.	 Your credit card number is used to buy stuff, sticking you with the bill.

Book IV 
Chapter 1
Looking at Internet 
Threats
193
Avoiding Bad People
Fortunately, most countries have laws dealing with credit cards such that if 
you notice the fraudulent transaction before your bill is due, you can dispute 
the charge and not have to pay it when it’s shown to be fraudulent. Still, it’s 
an inconvenience to have this happen.
	
One sign to look for when paying over the Internet is that you are using 
a secure connection. A secure connection means that anyone watching 
your traffic will not be able to see the information inside because it is 
encrypted. Figure 1-5 shows an Internet Explorer window that is using a 
secure connection.
	
Figure 1-5: 
A secure 
connection.
	
In the address, note that the URL begins with https instead of http. This 
indicates the connection is encrypted. Also note the picture of the lock. This 
indicates that the site you are browsing is the same one that was certified 
to use the security. Some older Web browsers place the lock in the bottom 
status bar instead of in the URL.
The certificate itself is no protection against someone coming in after the 
fact and stealing the data. This is an unfortunate part of the Internet and 
security. The credit card companies are still rolling out their security 
standards across their merchants, which will enforce rules protecting your 
information.

194
It’s Not All Doom and Gloom
	
It is a good idea to keep a credit card for use only on the Internet, and to 
keep the limit fairly low. This makes it easier to spot fraudulent transactions 
and limits your liability should problems arise.
It’s Not All Doom and Gloom
This chapter has shined a spotlight on some of the darker parts of the 
Internet. I didn’t lead off with it to scare you. In the next couple of chapters, 
I cover tools you can use to protect yourself.
Tools by themselves won’t help you, though. You need to be smart before 
you open that attachment, or get your credit card out. The bad guys prey on 
greedy people. Don’t be one of them.
You can find a lot of good stuff on the Internet, and the bad guys shouldn’t 
keep you from it.

✓	Protecting your wireless network
W
hen networks were all wired, you’d know exactly who was on your 
network because they’d be connected by a cable to your switch. 
Unless someone snuck a 200 foot cable out your window, you could rest 
pretty soundly knowing that you and your family were the only users on 
the network.
With wireless, your neighbor’s teenage son (never did trust the kid. . .) 
could be sneaking into your files, or that strange, white unmarked van 
across the street could be spying on you. Maybe I’m just getting paranoid. 
Or am I?
Knowing Your Network
If you want to defend your network, then you need to understand how it’s 
put together. Each component has different properties and is defended dif­
ferently. You can look at your network as if it were made up of two parts:
	
✦	 The Internet connection
	
✦	 All the stuff on the inside, like your computers
The next sections cover each of these in turn.
Protecting the Internet connection
What happens on your Internet connection is your responsibility. If some­
one on your network does something bad, willingly or unwillingly, then the 
Internet service provider has your name on their billing records and will talk 
to you first. If cops get involved, you get the first interview.

196
Knowing Your Network
Problems are not unheard of. Consider the following scenarios:
	
✦	 ISPs sometimes implement a cap on the amount of data that can be 
transferred on a given connection as part of the monthly rate, after 
which they charge a fee based on usage. Most people will never touch 
this cap, but if someone were to use your connection to download 
movies all month, you could blow past this limit without knowing.
	
✦	 You’ve been following the advice in this book about keeping your com­
puter safe, but the person borrowing your Internet connection hasn’t. 
They get infected, their computer becomes a zombie, and the next thing 
you know you can’t send e-mail because your provider has turned off 
your e-mail because of spam complaints.
	
✦	 A scammer finds that they can use your Internet connection if they park 
their car across the street. They use it to commit fraud, and the police 
get involved. The ISP traces the messages back to your address.
Although the scenarios may seem far-fetched, they have happened.
I’m not saying you can’t share your Internet connection with your neighbor, 
or that you should rigorously inspect everyone’s computer that enters your 
door. You can still lock down your network and share the password so that 
just your neighbor gets on while keeping the bad guys out. If the neighbors 
aren’t that computer savvy, maybe you could lend them this book (or better 
yet, get them their own copy!).
War driving
War driving is a play on a pre-Internet activity 
called War Dialing. In War Dialing, someone 
dials every phone number in a particular range 
of telephone numbers, looking for computers 
that answer instead of humans. This technique 
used to be very effective at finding unprotected 
computers because the systems administra­
tors used to use dial-in modems as a way to 
remotely manage their systems and were often 
not very thorough in their security practices.
If you’ve ever seen the movie War Games you’ll 
recognize this. If you haven’t, you should look 
it up. Despite being over 25 years old it’s still a 
great flick!
War driving involves driving around a city with 
a computer and a wireless card, looking for 
open (or easily crackable) wireless networks. 
It’s been refined to the point where you can tie 
in a GPS unit and end up with a map of all the 
networks, with the exploitable ones highlighted.
The bad guys will use war driving to find open 
access points they can use and abuse. Make 
sure you’re not on their list!

Knowing Your Network
The stuff on the inside
Your network may include your computers, video game consoles, and 
maybe a file sharing device or two. If someone can connect to your wireless 
network, then they can connect to your computers and file storage servers.
More sophisticated attackers can pretend to be your gateway and force all 
your Internet use through their computer using a process called spoofing. 
Anything you look at on your computer is passed through the attacker’s 
computer. Even though your bank uses encryption when you view their Web 
page, you still have to be careful to make sure that the attacker isn’t feeding 
you bad information.
	
Your computers have files on them that you’d probably rather keep private. 
You may not have anything to hide, but you still don’t want to share all your 
files with people. Tax returns? Letters to the lawyer? If you wouldn’t stick it 
to your front door, then it’s worth spending some time to protect.
Hackers versus crackers
Throughout this chapter and others, I might use 
the term hackers and crackers. You’ve prob­
ably heard the term hacker before and have 
heard it being used in the context of a bad guy 
trying to break into your computer.
The word hacker has a long and distinguished 
history, however. Hackers were the people that 
advanced computer science not by exploiting 
weaknesses and doing harm, but by using 
their intelligence to pull off feats of skill (called 
hacks). Hackers would build computers out 
of spare parts or come up with brilliant ways 
around limitations.
As other intelligent people used their skills for 
evil, the media applied the name of hacker to 
them. These are the bad guys: the people writ­
ing software to steal information, or coming up 
with ways to game systems to their advantage.
It’s insulting to the hacker community to asso­
ciate these bad people with them, so we use 
the term cracker, much as in a safe cracker.
In this book, I don’t have the need to refer to 
people in the hacker sense, so I’ll just use 
cracker, attacker, or, even better, bad guy.
There’s a third class of people that I’ll call 
researchers. These people try to find weak­
nesses in systems in the name of improving 
them. They’re trying to break the security sys­
tems before the crackers do, so that the sys­
tems can be fixed. These guys are on your side.
Unfortunately, the public nature of research 
means that the crackers eventually learn about 
the problems and use them to their advantage.

198
Choosing Wireless Security
People from the Internet
So far I’ve been talking about people trying to get into your home network 
over the wireless connection. There are also people trying to get in from the 
Internet. Fortunately your firewall blocks any connections from the outside 
coming in, unless you deliberately turn that feature off. Don’t do that!
Most of the attackers coming from the Internet are computer programs that 
are scanning your service provider’s network, looking for vulnerable hosts. 
Your firewall protects you against these scans because it only allows con­
nections that your computers make out to the Internet and not new connec­
tions from the Internet to the inside of your network.
All that said, if you run a program that’s got a virus in it, all bets are off. We 
talk about getting anti-virus protection in the next chapter.
Choosing Wireless Security
Wireless networking, by nature, involves throwing your data over the air­
waves and hoping only the recipient is the one listening. As more people 
used wireless, more important information was carried over the air. As more 
important information was sent, the incentive for people to try and listen to 
it increased. As people tried to listen, the engineers in charge of the wireless 
standards tried to keep up.
Here’s a summary of the wireless security protocols available to you.
WEP
When 802.11 was introduced by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE) in 1997, the standard called for vendors to optionally pro­
vide security through Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). WEP encrypted the 
data that was sent over the radio so that people listening in couldn’t read it 
without the key.
WEP had some problems from the start. The key used to decrypt the data 
was static, meaning it never changed. To get on a WEP-protected network, 
everybody had to share the same key. As you can imagine, it became easy to 
figure out the key because it often got posted to the wall so people wouldn’t 
forget it.
Secondly, the United States had some rather peculiar regulations at the 
time dealing with the export of encryption capable products to other coun­
tries. Back in 1997, encryption fell under the International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations (ITAR), which regulated the export of weapons out of the coun­
try. You couldn’t export missiles, nuclear weapons, night vision goggles, and 
any encryption the government couldn’t break.

Book IV 
Chapter 2
Using a Safety Net
199
Choosing Wireless Security
As such, WEP went out the door with pretty weak encryption, even for 1997. 
But it was all we had. Some people used it, some people didn’t.
Fast-forward a few years, and people are starting to look closely at the 
security of WEP. The U.S. government relaxed their position on encryption, 
and WEP was upgraded to something less embarrassing. However, some 
researchers found that by listening to enough traffic you could deduce the 
shared key. As people poked deeper into WEP, they found that even less 
traffic was needed, and you could even cause the access point to generate it 
if the clients weren’t generating traffic. The time to crack a WEP key is now 
down to a minute, even with the stronger encryption in use.
Yes, you heard me right. Someone can listen to a WEP-protected network 
and have the key before you even notice they’re there. With the right 
antenna, they could be farther away.
This isn’t going to do. Something better is needed.
WPA
The IEEE started work on the 802.11i standard, which dealt with wireless 
security. As usual, trying to get a bunch of engineers to agree on something 
takes its time, so the Wi-Fi Alliance took some of the in-progress work from 
802.11i and came up with the Wi-Fi Protected Access standard (WPA).
WPA solves the key problems that were the downfall of WPA with a protocol 
called the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). TKIP’s job is to rotate keys 
constantly so that the problems WEP had won’t happen again.
WPA had a major constraint in that it was intended to run on older access 
points by means of a firmware upgrade. This was because WEP was so 
broken that the industry wanted to protect access points in the field. 
Therefore WPA uses some of the same encryption techniques as WEP, just 
implemented in a better fashion.
WPA also introduced the concepts of a pre-shared key mode (PSK) and an 
enterprise mode. PSK mode requires a key that’s known to all participants in 
the wireless network, just like WEP. Enterprise mode allows you to use your 
enterprise login credentials to log in to the wireless network, eliminating the 
need for a shared key.
Even though enterprise mode is better security, it requires servers and 
services that people at home just don’t have. The acronyms and standard 
names required to implement this mode are astounding. So, you’ll always 
want to use PSK mode if you’re ever given the option.

200
Choosing Wireless Security
WPA was a significant improvement upon WEP. Eventually, researchers 
found ways to mess with WPA networks. WPA is not as completely broken 
as WEP, but it is possible to inject packets into a WPA-protected network. 
With this ability, an attacker could still redirect the entire network’s traffic 
through a computer of his choosing.
WPA2
Third time’s the charm, right?
The IEEE finally finished 802.11i, and the Wi-Fi Alliance called it WPA2. The 
Alliance also made implementation of WPA2 a mandatory part of Wi-Fi compat­
ibility testing. Without WPA2, vendors couldn’t put the Wi-Fi logo on the box.
WPA2 got rid of TKIP and went with the Advanced Encryption Standard, which 
is the same that the U.S. government uses for protecting its secrets. The ear­
lier WPA standard was also revised to allow AES to be used instead of TKIP.
To date, there are no direct attacks against WPA2. That hasn’t stopped 
people from trying, though!
Even though the bad guys can’t exploit weaknesses in WPA2, they can try to 
guess your password. So pick a good one!
Deciding what to choose
If you’re setting up a wireless network, you want to be using WPA2. Most 
access points have a mode that allows both WPA2 and WPA to be used. If 
you have older clients that only support WPA, then this mode will work.
It’s easy enough for me to say “use WPA2” when you’re setting up your own 
network, but what about when you use other people’s networks?
Hotel networks generally have no encryption or security at all. Anyone can 
connect, anyone can read the packets in the air, usually called open mode 
or an open network. Access to the network is usually protected by a captive 
portal, which intercepts you when you first start using the Internet, and only 
lets you through after you’ve registered.
Captive portals provide no protection for you; they’re there only for the con­
venience (and usually, profit margin) of the hotel.
Connecting to these unprotected networks is okay as long as you’ve pro­
tected your computer (see Chapter 3) and realize that anything you send 
over the network is visible by anyone. Browsing the Web is fine. Logging into 
your secure bank account is secure as long as you validate the site’s certifi­
cate like I showed in Chapter 1.
WEP should be considered in the same boat as an open network.

Exploring Network Security Features
As technology advances, the CPUs going into routers get faster and faster. 
The processing power required for the basic routing and firewalling is 
negligible, so there’s ever increasing room left for more features.
You’d think that manufacturers would cut back and put the bare minimum 
CPU in, but the way the industry works is that older chips cost more to buy, 
so it ends up being cheaper to put more oomph inside the box.
Most manufacturers have several features in common, though some may 
implement them slightly differently. Some features are handy, some not so 
much, and some will completely expose your computer to Internet attackers. 
In the following sections, I identify when and where you’d want to use them.
Understanding the SSID and password
The network name (SSID), password, and security protocol (such as WPA2) 
are your first line of defense against attackers. You’ve seen earlier how 
WPA2 is currently the best protocol to use, and you probably gathered that 
the password is important.
The only known way to break into a WPA2 PSK (pre-shared key) network is 
to guess the password. The crackers know this and have come up with ways 
to guess passwords at incredible speeds.
The WPA/WPA2 key that encrypts all the data in the air is derived from both 
the password and the SSID. One of the optimizations the crackers use is to pre-
compute these keys by using a list of popular SSIDs and popular passwords.
If you make sure that your SSID is unique, such as the name of your street, 
your pet’s name, or something else unique, perhaps followed by a number, 
you’ll be sure to stay off this list.
The most important thing to do is to choose a complex password. If you’re 
using Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS), you don’t even have to remember it!
Figure 2-1 shows where you configure the SSID, protocol, and pass­
word for the network. Here the SSID is “walberghome,” the password is 
“W1r3l3ssB00k,” and the network uses WPA2.
	
Search the Internet for “top 1000 ssids” and you should find, surprisingly 
enough, a list of 1000 of the most common SSIDs out there.
With a unique SSID and an unguessable password, the crackers will have to 
find another way in!

202

the SSID,

and

SSIDs and passwords are case sensitive. Use a lowercase SSID, and work in 
some uppercase letters and some numbers into your password.
Using advanced wireless settings
When wireless first came out and the low-strength version of WEP was all 
that was available, people came up with a few methods to increase the secu­
rity of their network.
Security is always a tradeoff between protection and convenience. As you 
add more security measures, it becomes more complex to use whatever it is 
you’re protecting.
And so, too, it is with wireless. Two ideas that people came up with were
	
✦	 Hide the existence of the SSID
	
✦	 Find the hardware addresses of the machines you want to connect and 
only let those in
With today’s technology, both of these are poor protections against attack. 
Not only do they make your wireless network terribly inconvenient for you 
to use, but they don’t improve your security.

Book IV 
Chapter 2
Using a Safety Net
203
Exploring Network Security Features
On the surface, hiding your SSID makes some sense. Your wireless access 
point broadcasts its network name periodically so that your computer can 
know when it should connect. Turning off this feature means that someone 
driving by won’t know the access point is there and won’t try to break into it.
The problem with this is that it is still possible to deduce the presence of a 
wireless network because of the wireless traffic. After that, there are various 
ways to figure out the SSID.
The second idea involves making a list of the hardware addresses of the 
wireless cards and telling the router to only allow those addresses to use the 
network. Figure 2-2 shows the properties of a wireless card. The hardware 
address is the same as the physical address.
	
Figure 2-2: 
Showing the 
hardware 
address of 
a wireless 
NIC.
	
Not only is it a pain to administer, spoofing a MAC address is trivial. Spoofing 
in this example means that the attacker is using your MAC address instead 
of his; your access point is none the wiser.
Browse to Wireless Settings to see where these features are configured (See 
Figure 2-3). The Enable SSID Broadcast controls whether or not your SSID is 
broadcast. Click the Setup Access List button to set up the MAC addresses 
that can connect.
	
These features don’t do much to protect your network but do cause serious 
usability concerns. At one point, using these features were requirements 
for companies transmitting credit card data over wireless networks, but the 
requirements were dropped in late 2008 because the tradeoff wasn’t worth 
it. If even the credit card companies don’t think it helps security, then it’s 
not worth doing.

So why did I even bring it up? If you do some reading on the Internet, you 
may come across a page talking about it. I wanted to make sure you knew 
the reasoning and history behind the recommendation and the tradeoffs 
involved.
Allowing incoming connections
A firewall’s job is to block bad packets and allow good packets. At the very 
simplest level your router’s firewall does this by blocking any connections 
that were initiated by outside hosts and allows anything that was initiated 
from the inside. That’s why you can request Web pages from your computer, 
but people can’t open your file shares from the outside.
Most applications behave under these circumstances. Firewalls have 
been around for ages, even before the first home router. The nature of the 
Internet is also client-server, which means you (the client) request stuff from 
the server, and not the other way around.
That’s not to say there aren’t applications that break this mold. Peer-to-
peer file sharing and online gaming are two notable examples. In these 
applications, the server sometimes has to push data to you, or you must 
accept a connection from another client to pull a piece of data. The firewall 
prevents this.

Exploring Network Security Features
Port forwarding is a feature that lets you take certain inbound connections 
and forward them to a particular host on the inside of your network.
	
The firewall is preventing incoming connections for a good reason — they’re 
usually insecure. When setting up port forwarding, be careful to only for­
ward what you need.
To set up port forwarding, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Determine the port to be forwarded, which should be provided by the 
application or its documentation.
	
	 Figure 2-4 shows a dialog from a file-sharing program, indicating that the 
incoming port is 59534.
	
Figure 2-4: 
Determining 
the port 
to be 
forwarded.
	
	
	 Every application is different, and some (like the one above) choose 
random inbound ports. Just because the example above uses port 59534 
doesn’t mean that your application will.
	
2.	 Navigate to the Port Forwarding menu in your wireless router’s 
administrative interface, which is shown in Figure 2-5.
	
3.	 Ensure that Port Forwarding is selected. Check under Service Name to 
see if the name of the protocol is there.
	
	 (If it is, skip over the next section.)

Adding a custom service
The NETGEAR router comes with some predefined port forwarding proto­
cols. If your protocol isn’t on the list, you have to add it.
	
1.	 Select the Add Custom Service button to get to the screen shown in 
Figure 2-6.
	
2.	 Fill in the details about the port to be forwarded.
	
	 The name of the service is what you want it to be. In this case, I used the 
name of the application.
	
	 There is only one port to be forwarded, so I’ve put that in as both 
the starting and ending ports. Finally, the traffic is to be forwarded to 
192.168.1.100, which is my laptop.
	
3.	 Click Apply, and you are taken back to the port forwarding screen 
showing your new configuration (see Figure 2-7).

Exploring Network Security Features
Forwarding a known service
If the service is already known to the router, such as FTP, then you can 
select it from the main menu and enter the address of the server. Allowing 
incoming FTP traffic would be helpful if you wanted to set up a file server on 
the inside of your network.
Port triggering
The downside to port forwarding is that you have to know the address of the 
computer that wants to use the forwarding. This inconvenience is usually 
minor, but if it is a problem for you, then port triggering is an option.
Port triggering waits for an internal computer to make a predetermined type 
of connection to the outside. Upon seeing the connection, the router sets up 
a port forward to that computer.
The configuration of a port trigger is similar to that of a port forward, except 
that you must identify the outbound traffic, and you don’t need to specify an 
internal host.
Usually a port forward will suffice, though, and if you need a port trigger, 
then your application’s documentation will specify that.
DMZ server
In the security field, a demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a network that’s in 
between the inside and the outside, and all traffic must pass through a 
firewall. Companies put servers that they want to be Internet accessible in 
there, such as Web and e-mail servers. The servers can’t be trusted as much 
because they’re exposed to the Internet, so the firewall also dictates how the 
server can talk back to the company’s internal network.
The DMZ server on a home router is the catch-all host that all unknown traf­
fic gets sent to. Think of it as a port forward of all the ports to one server. 
Good or bad, incoming traffic gets sent to the server you specify.
Browse to the WAN Setup screen shown in Figure 2-8 to set up a DMZ server. 
Select the check box and type the address of the server, and all the bad guys 
can talk to your internal device.
	
Avoid using this feature. That computer is going to get a lot of attacks. That 
same computer is also free to talk to any computer on your internal network, 
so if it gets compromised, you can expect more to follow.

VPN passthrough
Your employer might let you work at home using a virtual private network 
(VPN) tunnel. This gives your computer a secure tunnel over the Internet 
back in to your place of employment.
VPNs don’t always play nicely with home routers. If you’re having problems 
with your VPN, check to make sure that the VPN passthrough options are 
enabled (also shown in Figure 2-8).
Reviewing Internet policies
Your router is likely able to perform some more extensive filtering on what 
goes in and out, rather than just assuming everything that goes out is good. 
Some of this functionality is rather advanced and specialized, but some of it 
falls under the “why didn’t they think of that before?” category.
One of the more handy features allows you to block Web sites based on key­
words in the site’s name, or in the page itself. If you’ve got kids around, this 
is especially helpful to make sure they don’t wander into some of the seedier 
parts of the Internet.

210
Exploring Network Security Features
	
It is technically possible to block other applications, such as instant messag­
ing, but chances are your router won’t be able to do it. Chat programs are 
notorious for evading firewalls, even going so far as to masquerade them­
selves as Web traffic. For that matter it is possible to get around the Web 
filtering, so it should not be considered a substitute for proper supervision.
To block sites based on their content follow these steps:
	
1.	 Navigate to the Block Sites menu, which is shown in Figure 2-9.
	
2.	 Enable blocking by selecting the Always option.
	
3.	 Enter your keywords one by one into the keyword box where indi­
cated, pressing Add Keyword in between each one.
	
	 Figure 2-10 shows a screen where blocking has been enabled and net­
gear has been added. If the word netgear appears in either the URL bar 
or the page itself, the site will be blocked.
	
	 Different routers are configured differently. For example, the Linksys 
routers maintain two separate block lists, one for the URL and one for 
keywords in the Web page.
	
	 If you know the name of the site you want to block, you can enter it as a 
keyword. If you just want to block individual words, that’s fine, too. You 
can do both at the same time.

4.	 When you’re done with the list, click the Apply button at the bottom 
of the screen.
	
	 You can always come back and adjust the list.
If someone attempts to go to a blocked Web site they will see the message 
shown in Figure 2-11.
This message, in no uncertain terms, tells you the site has been blocked.
	
Some routers do not display a message. Instead, they reset the connection 
to the Web server, triggering an error in the Web browser. It’s not as obvi­
ous to the user but still has the same effect.
Finally, if you would like to know what sites that people are going to, and if 
there were any blocks, click on the Logs menu (see Figure 2-12).
Here, you can see that someone tried to go to netgear.com but was blocked. 
The time of the infraction and the address of the computer are also logged.

If you need more control
Blocking Web sites containing one of a handful 
of keywords is a pretty simple way of attack­
ing the problem of keeping your kids from bad 
Web sites. If that’s not good enough for you, 
then consider a subscription service that cat­
egorizes Web sites and lets you decide which 
categories are good and bad.
These services are used by either installing 
software on the computer that’s to be filtered 
or by integrating with the router. Few rout­
ers support this integration, so go looking for 
a router that supports URL filtering with an 
external service if you want that option. Be 
forewarned, the router will probably cost a bit 
more than a router without the feature.
In addition to the cost of the router or software, 
you’ll probably have to pay a regular subscrip­
tion fee for use of the block list, which would 
include updates to the list.
Many business grade routers with integrated 
firewalls are starting to incorporate Web fil­
tering, virus scanning, and more advanced 
(and automatic) firewalls. It’s only a matter of 
time before this technology makes its way into 
home routers.
Whatever software or hardware you use, it’s 
not a substitute for proper supervision. Putting 
the family computer in the living room, where 
everyone can see it, might be a cheaper and 
easier option.

ecurity is a process, not a product. Even the best software out there 
won’t protect you if you don’t use it properly. Fortunately, there’s a 
lot of good software built right into the operating system, and this chapter 
focuses on making it work for you.
Security is also a tradeoff between convenience and risk, so I look at a few 
places where you can choose to take a less aggressive security posture in 
return for less intrusion on your life. It’s a fair trade — there are no wrong 
answers.
Throughout this chapter, I focus on the Windows Vista security tools. Other 
than a basic firewall, the older Windows XP has virtually nothing built in and 
therefore relies on third-party tools. Vista isn’t perfect, but it’s leaps and 
bounds ahead of XP.
Visiting the Windows Security Center
The Windows Security Center (WSC) was introduced to Windows XP in 
Service Pack 2, and was improved as it was carried forward into Vista. The 
job of the security center is to monitor the status of various security-related 
settings and to give you an easy-to-read view of your security posture.
The picture of the shield with the exclamation mark in Figure 3-1 is your first 
indication of a problem.

instead of a yellow shield, as shown in Figure 3-2.

The difference between warnings and serious problems in this case is sub­
jective. Either case should prompt you to check and see what’s going on, 
though.
Double-click on the Security Center alert icon to bring up the security 
center, which is shown in Figure 3-3.
The WSC is broken down into four separate areas:
	
✦	 Windows Firewall: This area protects your computer against incom­
ing and outgoing connections, which is an additional layer of defense if 
you’ve already got a hardware firewall.
	
✦	 Automatic updating: This service automatically downloads and applies 
patches if you’d like, which ensures your computer is always up to date.
	
✦	 Malware protection: This area shows the status of both anti-virus and 
anti-spyware software.
	
✦	 Other security settings: This area is a grab bag of extra security features.

Each item in the Windows Security Center is shaded according to its status 
and also provides a line of text to further describe the status. Based on the 
dark shading, you can see that Figure 3-3 has a serious problem with the 
firewall because the firewall is turned off. The other elements seem to be 
healthy.
If you don’t see an icon in your system tray, your computer probably meets 
all the requirements of the Windows Security Center. If you still want to 
check, go to the Control Panel and then click on the Check this computer’s 
security status link.
Exploring the Windows firewall
The Windows firewall’s job is to inspect the network packets that go in and 
out of your computer and to decide if they’re allowed or not, based on the 
configured policy. The policy is changed over time based on feedback from 
the user. For example, using a new program might prompt you for permis­
sion to allow that particular program to make the network connections.
The firewall tracks down connections to the application. One application 
may be permitted to make a Web request, but another application might not. 
By doing so, you have an increased chance of spotting malware because you 
will be prompted when the application tries to make a request that is out of 
character.

Turning on the firewall
Turning on the firewall is a straightforward process.
	
1.	 From the Control Panel, click the security icon to take you to the 
security menu within the control panel.
	
	 This is shown in Figure 3-4.

3.	 From the Firewall Settings window, select the On (Recommended) 
option and click the OK button.
	
	 Your shields are now up!
Living with the Windows Firewall
If firewalls were foolproof, then you’d never have been given the option of 
turning it on — it would be just a part of Vista you never thought about.
Unfortunately, the firewall is not perfect, and it can’t react to every situation. 
By default, the firewall blocks incoming connections. But what if you need a 
connection to come in?
When an application requests the ability to listen for incoming connections, 
and the policy would block that, you are given the opportunity to override 
the block through the dialog box shown in Figure 3-6.

Figure 3-6:

to allow a

The dialog box shown in Figure 3-6 is light on details. You’re being asked 
to decide whether or not an application should accept connections. If you 
allow it, the Windows firewall will allow incoming connections into this 
application.
To be clear, the application has requested the privilege of accepting con­
nections. The first question you should ask is “Did I just launch that applica­
tion?” If the query came while you were in the middle of browsing the Web, 
then you should be extra cautious. However, in this case, I ran the program. 
If you’re not sure which program generated the alert, then check the dialog 
box because it’s listed there.

220
Visiting the Windows Security Center
After you determine that the alert was as a result of a program you chose 
to run, you should ask “Is this the type of program that accepts network 
connections?”
On the Internet, a client (your computer) connects to a server to get some 
information. The connection is always made from one side to the other, and 
having a connection come in to you if you’re a client is rare.
Therefore, if you see an alert asking you if you’d like to accept connections, 
you should qualify the last question by asking yourself why someone would 
want to connect to me.
You want incoming connections on the following scenarios:
	
✦	 When you’re running some server software such as an FTP server.
	
✦	 When you’re running a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing program that 
shares out parts of the file as you download the rest.
	
✦	 When you’re running some remote control software and want people to 
be able to control your computer.
It’s also important to note that if you’re behind a router, then people from 
the Internet can’t make direct connections to you and wouldn’t be able to 
connect to the application anyway. There are exceptions to this, such as if 
you’ve enabled port forwarding (see Book IV, Chapter 2).
If you want to allow the application to receive connections, then click 
Unblock. If not, click Keep Blocking.
Using automatic updates
Software isn’t perfect. Actually, if you spent some time as a software devel­
oper, you’d be continually surprised when it works at all. A popular quote 
among developers is “If we built buildings the same way we built software, 
the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization.”
Despite Microsoft’s biggest efforts, bugs exist in Windows. Some of them are 
pretty tame such as “screen doesn’t redraw properly.” But some of them are 
pretty bad like one that surfaced in late 2008 that allowed anyone that could 
connect to your machine to take it over. Oops.
Patches are pieces of software that fix bugs. Think of using patches as patch­
ing up a hole in a wall, or in a bike tire. Microsoft releases these patches 
every month, and you can download them to make sure your computer’s 
software is up to date.

Book IV 
Chapter 3
Protecting Your 
Computer
221
Visiting the Windows Security Center
The problem is that Microsoft software often has bugs and, therefore, it tends 
to release a lot of patches. Chances are you won’t remember to download every 
single patch every month. Figuring out which patches are necessary is also a 
problem. So Microsoft introduced Windows Update some time ago, and more 
recently, made it install patches automatically, should you allow it.
In Figure 3-7, the line corresponding to automatic updates has been pulled 
down to show some more details.

If you choose the Let Me Choose option, the screen in Figure 3-9 appears. 
You can select one of the following options:

you get to choose the time the updates happen.

aren’t downloaded automatically. I find this option to be troublesome 
because I like having the updates happen when I’m not using the 
computer.
	
✦	 Never check for updates: If you want to do it by hand, choose this 
option.
	
I recommend setting your system up for automatic updates, so you won’t 
miss an update.
Checking for updates manually
The automatic updates only download the patches that Microsoft deems 
critical. Every so often, check for updates manually; doing so lets you down­
load all the optional updates.
Going through the process manually after you first install your computer is 
a good idea. Usually, you have some updates that require the presence of 
earlier updates, so even after going through the updates once, you may find 
that you’re not fully patched. Only the manual process gives you the confi­
dence that you’re up to date. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 From the Control Panel, select Check for Updates from the Security 
menu.
	
	 The screen shown in Figure 3-10 appears.
	
Figure 3-10: 
Showing the 
available 
updates.
	

224
Visiting the Windows Security Center
	
	 In Figure 3-10, you can see that the system has 57 important updates to 
download. If you are curious about what they are, you can click the View 
available updates link.
	
	 This screen also lets you confirm your automatic update settings. Here 
you can see that the system is configured to update nightly at 3 a.m., 
and that it’s never been updated.
	
2.	 Ignore the optional updates for now and click the Install Updates 
button to begin the update process.
	
	 Sometimes the updates come with a license that you must accept to 
use. In Figure 3-11, the license is for the Windows Malicious Software 
Removal Tool, which is the built in anti-spyware product. I look at this 
later, but for now, you have to accept the license terms and click Finish.
	
Figure 3-11: 
Accept 
the license 
terms.
	
	
3.	 Wait while your system downloads and installs updates.
	
	 The time it takes to do this depends on the speed of your computer and 
how many updates you have.
Your computer will be usable during the update process, but don’t expect 
peak performance. There’s a lot going on during the update process, and at 
times your computer might feel sluggish.
After the updates are installed, you get confirmation, as shown in Figure 3-12.

If you read the message on the screen, you can see that you’re being 
prompted to reboot to finish the updates. You can do so now, or close the 
window to reboot later.
If you choose to reboot later, then you are periodically reminded to reboot 
by means of a dialog box that pops up from the system tray, shown in 
Figure 3-13.
	
Figure 3-13:

You can continue to postpone the reboot as long as you want.
When you finally reboot, the process takes longer than normal because 
updates are being processed.
Some updates depend on other updates already having been applied. The 
first time you apply updates you should go back and check to make sure all 
updates were applied correctly.

1.	 After the reboot, go back to the updates window by going to the Control 
Panel and selecting Check for Updates from the Security menu.
	
	 Figure 3-14 shows that there is one important update and 20 optional 
updates.
	
2.	 Click on View available updates to get details of these 21 updates.
	
	 Figure 3-15 shows the available updates. The important update is a 
security update, and most of the rest are regular system updates. If you 
are curious, you can enter the identification next to the update, such as 
KB931099, into the search engine at Microsoft.com to find out the details.

3.	 Choose the updates you want to install by checking the box next to 
the name. If you want to select them all, you can check the button at 
the top of the dialog.
	
4.	 Finally, click on Install to begin the update process.
	
	 You might have to go through this a couple more times before you’re 
all up to date. However, after you’re done, you are told that there are no 
new updates available, as in Figure 3-16.
	
Figure 3-16: 
No new 
updates are

After all of that, your automatic updates take care of you, and all you have to 
worry about is performing the odd reboot.
Protecting against malware
Microsoft Windows spawned an industry of malware authors eager to make 
a buck off of computer users. The malware authors were fairly successful, 
which itself was the drive behind the good guys to come out with anti-
malware products.
Anti-virus products have been available long before the Internet was com­
monplace and have managed to keep pace with the virus authors. Anti-
malware software has not been as successful as its anti-virus brethren. 
Finally, with the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft bundled its own anti-
malware software with the operating system.
Microsoft calls this software Windows Defender. It is bundled with Vista and 
also downloadable from Microsoft.com for Windows XP and 2003.

228
Visiting the Windows Security Center
Sadly, Windows Defender doesn’t do anything for viruses. You’re on your 
own there, so I’ve got a free alternative for you later on in this chapter.
Looking at Windows Defender
	
1.	 From the Control Panel choose Security and then click on Windows 
Defender to open Windows Defender, shown in Figure 3-17.
	
	 In the figure you can see that everything is just fine according to Defender.
	
2.	 If you want to scan your computer right away, click the Scan button at 
the top. If anything pops up, you can deal with it right there.

Bundled security software
If you’ve bought a computer recently, espe­
cially from a retail outlet, you might find that it 
comes with anti-virus and anti-malware soft­
ware. If so, great! But, please check carefully, 
because many of these are time-limited trials 
and will stop working after 30, 60, or 90 days.
If, after the trial, you’re happy with the soft­
ware, then by all means buy it. Windows Vista 
was designed to work with third-party anti-
virus and anti-malware products. Make sure 
that you understand what you’re signing up for, 
such as recurring billing.
If you don’t want to keep the software, make 
sure to uninstall it to avoid being nagged about 
buying it.

Other than that, Windows Defender doesn’t provide a whole lot of options. 
It’s nowhere near as interesting as anti-virus.
Installing anti-virus software
Many companies are selling anti-virus software. You can expect to pay 
around $30–$60 for the software, depending on the features, and to pay that 
every year for upgrades and updates to the virus signatures. Packages at the 
upper end (and higher) include more than just anti-virus and anti-spyware; 
they help you with spam, identity theft, and a whole host of other problems.
There is, however, a free anti-virus package out there. AVG is a company 
that produces anti-virus and anti-spyware software with various features. 
They offer their base package free for noncommercial use. If you don’t 
already have anything else, I highly recommend AVG.
If you scroll to the bottom, you can see the download link, which is shown in 
Figure 3-18.
Upon clicking the download link, you are redirected to another site for the 
download. If you are using Internet Explorer, you might get the warning shown 
in Figure 3-19. If so, click on the warning bar and then click Download File.

The AVG toolbar provides some enhancements to Internet Explorer that can

Be careful about which toolbars you install because you don’t know if they 
contain malware. The AVG toolbar is a helpful toolbar and alerts you if you 
try to install a toolbar containing malware.
Continue following the prompts until the software reports that installation is 
complete.
Configuring the first run
After you install the AVG anti-virus software, you are prompted to configure 
it through the first run wizard. For the most part, you can accept all the 
defaults, though there are a couple of screens where you might choose to 
select an alternate option to the default.

The first screen is shown in Figure 3-23. Click Next to continue.

Follow the instructions on the screens to complete the installation. You may 
or may not want to choose the following options:

✦	 Agree to provide information about detected threats to AVG: This 
option is disabled by default, and you may want to consider enabling it. 
Turning on this option sends information about what the software finds 
back to AVG for product improvements and virus research. Any informa­
tion that could identify you is stripped before it is sent.
	
✦	 Change my default search engine to Yahoo!: If you installed the tool­
bar, this option changes your default search engine to Yahoo!. By default 
this is selected; if you prefer a different search engine, then deselect it.
You go through a few screens, the software updates itself with the latest 
virus definitions, and then you are protected.
Verifying that you’re protected
You know you’re protected from viruses two ways, as shown in Figure 3-25.

The first indication is that the Windows Security Center isn’t complaining 
about the anti-virus (go to the Control Panel and then find Check this com­
puter’s security status, or see the earlier section called Visiting the Windows 
Security Center). In fact, if you look at the Malware protection section, you 
see the following:
	
✦	 Virus Protection: AVG Antivirus Free reports that it is up to date and 
virus scanning is on.
	
✦	 Spyware and other malware protection: Windows Defender and AVG 
Anti-Virus both report that they are turned on.

234
Visiting the Windows Security Center
Finally, look in the system tray to see the new AVG icon (the four colored 
boxes).
You’ve got virus protection. You’ve got spyware protection. Let’s move on.
Other security settings
By now you’ve set up some pretty good defenses. Your computer updates 
itself regularly. It has a firewall, and its anti-virus and anti-spyware sensors 
are busy looking for any signs of malware.
You could stop right here and be fairly worry free when browsing the 
Internet. But being safe on the Internet is much more than the software you 
run; it’s also the decisions you make.
I’m pretty sure you’re going to approach the Internet with a cautious eye and 
make good decisions, but even the best of us clicks the odd dialog box with­
out reading it too closely. So, I’m going to show you a couple of safeguards 
that you can use to further protect yourself against the bad things out there.
Creating separate accounts for administrators and users
Windows Vista is a multiuser operating system. This means that the system 
recognizes that you are different from someone else based on a username 
that you provide. Vista recognizes you by your account, which has a name 
and a password.
Using separate accounts means that you can keep your files separate from 
other people that use your computer. Maybe you want to protect stuff from 
being deleted; maybe you want your nosey sister to stay out of your stuff. 
Either way, one user can’t touch another user’s stuff.
Accounts also have privilege levels — either a standard user or administrator — 
in Vista. The account you’re using now is probably the one you created when 
you set up the system and is an administrator. In this section, you create a stan­
dard user account for day-to-day use which limits your exposure if something 
gets by your malware filters. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Go to Control Panel and select Add or Remove user accounts.
	
	 The list of user accounts appears, as shown in Figure 3-26.
	
	 In the figure you see that there is a user called Sean, who is an adminis­
trator and has a password. You can also see a disabled guest account 
that you will not use.
	
2.	 Select Create a new account to start creating the new account.
	
	 The form you see is shown in Figure 3-27.

	 The username I have selected is “Fred.” Note that the account is to be

default).
	
3.	 Click on the Create Account button to continue.
	
	 You are taken back to the previous menu, and you can see the new user 
(see Figure 3-28).

It is possible to reset passwords as an administrator, but heed the warning 
in Figure 3-28. If you end up using the encrypted file feature, you risk losing 
your files.
Logging in
The next time you start your computer (or if you select Logout from the 
Vista menu) you will see your new user available to use. Log in with that 
user and do your work as normal.
Should you need to assert your administrative might, you don’t have to log 
out and back in again as your administrative user. Simply right-click on the 
icon you want to run, and select Run as administrator, just like in Figure 3-30.
	
Figure 3-30: 
The Run as 
adminis-
trator option.
	
After you release the mouse button, you are prompted to log in as your 
administrative user, as shown in Figure 3-30.
Simple, eh?
Running as a regular user makes sure that any software you run can’t do too 
much damage. It’s just a good thing to do.

User Account Control
User Account Control (UAC) was introduced in Vista. Formerly, if you 
were an administrator, you had rights to modify anything on the system. If 
you weren’t an administrator, you were constantly running into problems 
because, well, you couldn’t modify anything.
As a result, people just logged in as administrators because it was the path of 
least resistance. UAC tries to solve this problem by withholding administrative 
access from a user (even an administrator) until they approve the action.
You’ve probably noticed dialog boxes like the one in Figure 3-31.
	
Figure 3-32: 
The UAC 
dialog box.
	
If you see something like that, then you know you’re being asked to do some­
thing at the administrative level. Programs that need administrative access 
have a special shield icon next to them in the control panel.
Go ahead and click on Continue if you had run the program indicated. If it 
pops up for no reason, or on a file you downloaded from the Internet, it’s 
time for caution! Fire up your anti-virus software and scan the file first.

eb sites can be temperamental. Sometimes they work, sometimes they 
don’t. I think it’s related to how badly you need the information on the 
page, but the scientific community is still undecided on that one. Either way, 
we live in an imperfect world, and not everything works all the time.
In this chapter, I present a few ways to find out if Internet problems are your 
fault or that of the other end and provide some general guidance on how to 
proceed after that.
If a Web site isn’t working for you, the most obvious thing to do is try a dif­
ferent one. If that one works, then maybe you should just try your first Web 
site later.
Confirming Your Network Settings
Before you go blaming the other guy, look at your network settings to make 
sure that you’re actually connected to your network.
	
1.	 From Vista’s Control Panel, select the View Network Status and Tasks 
option.
	
	 This takes you to the Network and Sharing Center, shown in Figure 4-1. 
The Network and Sharing Center is the starting point for configuring 
various aspects of Vista’s networking features.

From this window, you can see that Windows Vista considers that you have 
Internet access to the IPv4 network.

Network Problems
241
Confirming Your Network Settings
Even though Vista thinks you have Internet access, you want to verify this 
yourself. Click that Details button at the bottom of the window to see the 
network details shown in Figure 4-3.
There are a few important numbers here:
	
✦	 IPv4 IP Address: Your Internet address
	
✦	 IPv4 Default Gateway: Where you send all your packets to in order to 
get onto the Internet
	
✦	 IPv4 DNS Server: The machine that takes care of resolving names like 
http://www.dummies.com to the IP address of the machine
Computers and networks are constantly 
evolving. Network protocols are standardized 
ways of talking between computers. 
Standardized protocols let your mobile phone 
request a Web page from a supercomputer 
across the ocean — they’re both speaking the 
same language.
When the Internet as we know it began, it ran 
a protocol called IP — the Internet Protocol — 
Version 4. Guess what version we’re running 
30 years later? That’s right, Version 4.
IPv4 works great, but the problem is that it 
wasn’t designed to be used as much. The 
addresses used in the protocol, which identify 
the sender and the recipient of the packet, are 
only 32 bits long, which roughly works out to be 
a number between 0 and 4 billion.
Therefore, you could have 4 billion hosts on 
the Internet. However, various rules govern­
ing how hosts get laid out and how stuff works 
together bring that number down significantly.
With something like 6 billion people in the 
world, cell phones, and multiple computers 
per house, a lot of pressure is placed on those 
4 billion addresses. It’s not possible to make 
the address field bigger, so something has to 
be done.
The smart people that keep the Internet going 
managed to tweak the way the protocol works 
to extend the life of the addresses. One of 
these ways is the use of private addresses 
like 192.168.1.1 that you see in your home net­
work. Private addressing has done a remark­
able job of extending the time before all the 
IPv4 addresses are depleted. The so-called 
“death of the IPv4 Internet” has been predicted 
for years, and somehow we always make it 
through another year.
In the early 1990s work was started on the 
next-generation IPv4, which was eventually 
called IPv6 (IPv5 is something completely dif­
ferent and isn’t used). Windows Vista supports 
IPv6, but chances are your service provider 
doesn’t, nor do most of the Web sites you want 
to go to. So for now, don’t worry that your IPv6 
network doesn’t work.
IPv4? IPv6?

242
Pinging Around
	
Figure 4-3: 
Network 
connection 
details.
	
Your IP address probably starts with 192.168, but don’t fret if it doesn’t. 
However, if it begins with 169.254, then you’ve got a problem.
	
169.254.x.x is called the DHCP Autoconfigure Network. If a computer isn’t 
given a proper address by the network, then it makes up an address in the 
169.254 space. An address like this is a sure sign that your computer can’t 
find its DHCP server.
If you’re getting one of these addresses, then the problem is between you 
and your ISP. Begin by rebooting your wireless router and then your com­
puter. If that doesn’t solve the problem, refer back to Book II, Chapter 8 for 
instructions on how to troubleshoot your computer and wireless network.
Pinging Around
Underwater sonar relies on measuring sounds to determine where an object 
is and what it looks like. Active sonar generates sounds and measures the 
reflections that come back.
The Internet has its own version of a sonar ping called the ICMP Echo Request 
(ICMP being the Internet Control Message Protocol, which is like the traffic 
signals of the Internet). If you want to see if a host is alive, you send it an echo 
request. If it responds with an echo reply, then you know the host is there.
Of course, no one goes around saying “I’m going to send an ICMP Echo 
Request to that host and see if it comes back”; they say, “I’m going to ping 
that host.” Unsurprisingly, the command to initiate these tests is called ping. 

Book IV 
Chapter 4
Troubleshooting 
Network Problems
243
Pinging Around
Your host generally responds to pings automatically unless this feature is 
disabled or blocked.
	
Be careful about relying on negative ping results. If a ping doesn’t come 
back, then it’s possible that the site is down or that the pings are being 
blocked somewhere. It’s a fairly common (but not terribly effective) security 
policy to block ping requests going to servers.
Ping is a command line tool, which means it doesn’t have a point-and-click 
interface. But don’t worry, it’s easy to use.
Getting to the command line
The first step is to open up a command prompt (sometimes called a shell, 
DOS prompt, or command line).
Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Command Prompt.
You are rewarded with a black window, like the one you see in Figure 4-4.
	
Figure 4-4: 
The 
command 
prompt.
	
This window is the command prompt. Way back when, you used to interact 
with a computer by typing in commands rather than using a mouse. Things 
have changed since then, but Windows maintains a command line for the 
benefit of people managing the computer and troubleshooting.
Pinging your default gateway
The first order of business is to make sure that you can ping your gateway. 
You know the gateway’s address from when you looked at the network con­
nection details earlier.
Simply type ping followed by the IP address of the gateway, separating the 
two with a space. Then press enter. You should see something like Figure 4-5.

244
Pinging Around
	
Figure 4-5: 
A 
successful 
ping of the 
gateway.
	
By default, the ping command tries four times and reports on the status of 
each one. In Figure 4-5, you can see that all four tries are reported as suc­
cessful because the ping program indicated that the replies were received. 
The bytes and TTL (time to live) are uninteresting now, but the time field 
tells you how long each ping took from the time the request was issued to 
the time it was received. The first ping took 21 milliseconds, and the rest 
took 4 ms or less. It is normal that the first one takes longer.
If you lose some or all of the pings, you see a message like the one in 
Figure 4-6.
	
Figure 4-6: 
An 
unsuccess-
ful ping.
	
“Request timed out” means that no response came in the allotted time, 
which is usually 2 seconds. Most sites on the Internet are within 350 ms of 
you, so 2 seconds is almost like forever! Because you’re pinging the gateway, 
you should expect less than 10 ms, except possibly for the first response.
If you receive a few replies and a few timeouts, that’s usually a sign of packet 
loss. Losing a few packets here and there is normal, but again, if this is the 
gateway, then you might have interference and should go back to Book II, 
Chapter 8 for instructions on troubleshooting interference.

Network Problems
245
Pinging Around
Pinging your Web site
Now that you’ve got this magical tool that can tell you whether or not a com­
puter is alive, you can apply this to test if your Web site is there or not.
	
Ping only verifies that the computer is there; it doesn’t check to see if the 
Web site works.
When pinging a Web site, ping only the name of the Web site. For example, 
with www.dummies.com/some/page.html, the name of the server is www.
dummies.com. The http:// says that the address describes a Web page, and 
everything between that and the first slash (/) is the server name. The rest, 
including that first slash, is the path to the file. In this case, it’s /some/page.
html.
Behind the scenes, ping is going to translate www.dummies.com into an IP 
address. If it is unable to do so, then you will get the error message shown in 
Figure 4-7.
	
Figure 4-7: 
Ping is 
unable to 
resolve 
www.
dummies.
com.
	
Both Figure 4-6 and Figure 4-7 show unsuccessful pings, but they were 
unsuccessful for two different reasons.
Although the pings that timed out knew the destination address, they just 
never came back. When ping couldn’t find www.dummies.com, that meant 
that it had no idea who to send the pings to.
If you get the second error about the hostname, then it means you’ve either 
typed in the hostname wrong or you’re having a problem with your DNS 
server.
DNS, the domain name system, resolves names like http://www.dummies.
com to an IP address that your computer can communicate with. If that link 
isn’t made, then you’re not going to be able to reach the Web page.

246
Pinging Around
Assuming that you can ping your gateway, you should reset your ADSL 
or cable modem and then your wireless router. Doing this resets the path 
between you and the name server.
If the name resolution is successful, you either get your replies back or you 
won’t. If you get your replies back, then you know you can reach the other 
side. If not, it’s possible that the site is blocking the pings, or they might 
really be down.
If you don’t receive any replies to your ping, try a couple of other Web sites 
to see if the situation is more widespread.
Tracing the route
The Internet is made up of big, expensive computers called routers, and their 
sole purpose is to send your traffic to an adjacent router that’s one step closer 
to your destination. Therefore, you’re sending your data to your ISP’s edge 
router, who will forward that inside their core, probably to another provider, 
and so forth, until it’s time to send the response back the other way.
You can trace the path to your Web site to see how far along the path you 
get. Keep in mind that these traces are meant to be read by network engi­
neers, but you can still get an idea if the problem is close to you or not.
Use the curiously named tracert command to trace the route. You must also 
specify the name or address of the site to trace.
	
Why not traceroute? If you were on pretty much any system other than 
Microsoft Windows, you would use traceroute. But way back in the old days, 
Windows only allowed file names to be eight characters long. That require­
ment has long been eliminated, but you still see a few commands with 
slimmed-down file names.
The first example is a site that successfully works. Figure 4-8 shows the path 
from my home to www.unpluggedandonline.com, a site by the author 
about consumer wireless.
The first hop is 192.168.1.1, which is the wireless router, and then to the 
wireless router’s default gateway. Hops 3, 4, and 5 have names (on the right) 
ending in shawcable.net, which is my Internet service provider. The traffic 
is then handed off to ThePlanet, which is another service provider. The final 
hop, number 11, is the Web server itself.
The trace completed successfully, which means we know there is end-to-end 
connectivity. We could have just used ping to find the same information, but 
tracert gives the whole path. The numbers on the left give the cumulative

latency (maximum, average, and minimum) up to and including the particu­
lar hop. Between hops 3 and 4, you can see latency takes a jump, presum­
ably because it is a long haul link from my city to the coast.

248
Pinging Around
The trace starts the same and then diverges at hop 3. Hop 11 claims that the 
request timed out, which is the same response that ping gave. Tracert will 
look for up to 30 hops, so the rest of the path is more timeouts.
Even though the tracert failed, you can conclude that the packets are getting 
out of your Internet service provider and out onto the Internet. Any prob­
lems are likely going to be out of the control of your service provider.
	
The names on the right generally give some idea of where that hop is. For 
the path to www.unpluggedandonline.com, the path was probably going 
East to Asburn, Virginia, then to Dallas, Texas, where the server is located. 
www.dummies.com seems to be going Chicago to New York to New Jersey. 
It’s entirely possible that you might see paths crisscrossing the country.
Figure 4-10 shows a trace to an address that dies right after hop 2. This is 
generally the point where all the subscribers are collected into the ISP core 
network, so for the trace to die here indicates your provider is stopping 
something.
In this case, it turns out the address being traced is unknown.
	
Figure 4-10: 
The 
traceroute 
dies very 
quickly.
	
The final pattern you see is called a routing loop. The trace bounces between 
the same few hops until the trace times out. This occurrence is rare; if you 
see it you should just wait for it to clear itself out.

Finding Out if Other People Are Having Problems
Finding Out if Other People Are Having Problems
I’ve suggested earlier that one way to check if a Web site is really down is to 
ask someone else. If you can’t get to it, and they can’t get to it, chances are 
the problem lies closer to the Web site than it does for you (for this to work, 
the other person should really be in a different house).
That said, it’s somewhat intrusive to keep on asking someone to check a 
Web site for you whenever you have a problem. That’s why I really like 
http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com. This is a Web site where you 
can type in the name of another Web site, and it’ll happily tell you if it can 
reach the site or not.
Figure 4-11 shows http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com loaded, with 
www.dummies.com typed into the input field.

on my end.
However, if you check a site that is actually down, you get a different mes­

Getting Information About a Web Site
Have you ever wanted to contact the owner of a Web site, but couldn’t find 
out whom to call or e-mail? Maybe you’re trying to get more information 
about a product, or get in touch with the owner of a Web page. Sometimes 
it’s hard to get someone on the phone.
I’ve got two ways for you to find a name.

Book IV 
Chapter 4

Network Problems
251
Getting Information About a Web Site
Using a search engine
Search engines are huge farms of computers that comb the Web and keep 
track of what’s out there. When you need to find something, the search 
engine looks in its index of Web pages and pulls out what you’re looking for.
Most people go to a search engine and type in query phrases such as “real 
estate agent,” which tells the search engine to find all the pages that are 
about real estate agents. Search engines also support some other ways of 
querying them that let you be more specific.
One of these ways is to use the site operator, which limits your search to a 
given Web site. You then look within the site for common strings like “con­
tact us” or “e-mail.”
Most search engines support the site operator, which is simply the word 
site, followed by a colon (:), then the name of the web site you’re looking 
for. To look for the phrase “contact us” on the dummies.com Web site, you 
would search for site:dummies.com contact us, as shown in Figure 4-14.
	
Figure 4-14: 
A Web 
search  
for site: 
Dummies.
com  
contact us.
	
Fortunately for me, the first result was the one I was looking for. Sometimes 
you have to try some of the other results or try a variant of “contact us,” but 
if the page exists on the Web site, you’ll find it.

252
Getting Information About a Web Site
This technique is also good for finding other information. If you were to 
search for “site:dummies.com wireless all in one,” you would see all the 
results for this book on the Dummies.com Web site.
Checking the domain registration
If you were to get a domain name of your own (as opposed to using space 
on someone else’s), then you’d have to register the name. The registration 
process requires that you give some contact information, which is stored in 
a public registry. People can query this registry, called the Whois database, 
in order to find out how to contact the owner of a domain.
Depending on the company that owns the domain, the name you get back might 
be a generic phone number or it might be the owner of the company. Most 
larger companies will register as a generic entity like “Name registrations,” but 
the e-mail address and phone number will go to a real person. This prevents the 
company from having to update all their domains when people change jobs.
That’s no problem, because half the battle is finding a living, breathing, 
human being to talk to. After you’ve got someone on the line, a few kind 
words should get you the person you’re looking for.
Figure 4-15 shows the front page of http://dnstools.com, which is a site that 
automates the lookup of a domain’s owner. Browse to the site and enter the 
name of the domain you want to search. You can see that I’ve already filled 
out “dummies.com” and have made sure that the Whois (Domain Name) 
check box is checked.

Book IV

253
Getting Information About a Web Site
When you click the Go! button, you are given the registration information for 
the domain. You usually get several names back:
	
✦	 Technical contact: This is the person you’re supposed to call with tech­
nical problems about the name, so it usually leads to the company’s IT 
department.
	
✦	 Billing contact: This is usually the accounts payable team. “Billing” 
refers to who pays the bills for the cost of the domain registration and 
not about customer billing.
	
✦	 Administrative contact: This is a generic business contact.
If you don’t see all of these, don’t fret. Sometimes, companies combine sev­
eral of the roles into one contact record. Doing this makes it easier for you, 
as there are fewer people you have to try!
	
When contacting these people, explain how you found their name and what 
it is you’re looking for. Chances are this person won’t be the exact person 
you need, so try to get them to put you in touch with the person you do 
want to talk to.

f you think of the network as only being something that you have in your 
home, you’re missing an awful lot. Having the ability to connect your 
laptop PC to a network opens up whole new worlds for you. A networked 
laptop PC not only shares files on your home network, but connecting a net­
worked laptop PC is also far easier while you’re on the road. In this chapter, 
you read about a number of options that make your life on the road with a 
laptop a lot more convenient.
In many ways, a networked laptop PC is identical in operation to a net­
worked desktop PC. Topics such as network security, user accounts, and 
basic network setup, covered earlier, also apply to a networked laptop PC. 
Therefore, this chapter concentrates on topics that are specific to your 
laptop PC and its use while you’re away from home.
Discovering Your Options for Wire-Free Access
Connecting on the road is not necessarily the same thing as connecting at 
home. You have different options that might work better in some circum­
stances than in others. To some extent, the options that are best for you 
depend on a number of factors that you have to weigh carefully.
Before choosing your on-the-road connection options, you should ask your­
self a number of questions:
	
✦	 Do I need to be able to connect wherever I am?
	
✦	 How important is my connection speed?
	
✦	 Do I need real-time Internet access?
	
✦	 What is my budget?

258
Discovering Your Options for Wire-Free Access
The following sections take a look at a number of options that are based on 
your answers to these questions.
Choosing the expensive option
Wireless data plans sure have come a long way over the years. With the 
arrival of 3G and 3G+ in the United States and in Europe, wireless broadband 
cards for PCs are all the rage. Most often this means setting up an account 
with a provider, such as AT&T Wireless, Sprint, or Verizon Wireless. With 
this type of service you can connect wherever there’s network service — 
almost any urban/suburban area and even in rural areas. If you need to get 
broadband service from the top of a mountain in the heart of the Rockies, 
then perhaps you need to learn what vacation is all about.
Each network provider offers a similar plan, but you should definitely do 
your homework and make sure that you pick a provider that’s right for you. 
You should research things like equipment compatibility with your machine, 
network coverage, and terms of the contract. As with most things in life, the 
devil is in the details.
What makes this type of connection more expensive than most other 
options is the service contract that you have to sign with the service pro­
vider. Not only do you get the oppressive service contract, but you might 
also be stuck with a rather high monthly rate and potentially limited ser­
vice. For example, you may have download restrictions, in order to prevent 
network saturation, or your monthly fee may go up, depending on your 
bandwidth usage. Even though you might not think that you download a 
lot of data, if you enjoy streaming video or audio, then you likely use more 
than you think! Also, you’re likely to spend a monthly fee compatible to the 
price of a mobile phone subscription. Therefore, if you don’t end up using 
your wireless broadband card much one month, your price per megabyte 
becomes quite costly!
This option is good for road warriors, but it’s really not a viable option for 
a full-time home solution. You’ll want to enjoy the benefits of a traditional 
high-speed internet connection, which is still much, much faster than the 
speeds offered over wireless internet broadband.
Choosing somewhat limited option
If connection speed is the factor that’s most important, you probably need 
to consider a solution that trades off long range to provide higher speed. In 
this case, a Wi-Fi connection is probably your best option.
Wi-Fi hotspots are pretty easy to find, especially in most large cities. Coffee 
shops, fast food restaurants, hotels, and even quick print shops offer access. 
In some cases this access is free, while in others you have to pay a small fee. 

Book V
Chapter 1
Putting a Network 
in Your Lap(top)
259
Getting Carded
Many mobile phone providers also offer hotspot coverage on their network 
on a monthly or per-use basis. This option is good for those who travel occa­
sionally or work at coffee houses.
If you have a home network, you probably already have all of the equipment 
you need to connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot. You know that this type of connec­
tion provides speed, but that the signal only travels a limited distance. You 
can’t, for example, generally expect to connect several miles away from the 
hotspot.
Choosing the gimme-it-all option
Okay, I can hear you saying, “I want it all.” In other words, you want to con­
nect wherever you are and you want high speed, but you don’t want to 
spend a lot of money.
I wish I could offer that option. What I can offer you is the good news that 
wireless is now a widely embraced technology in the United States, which 
means it’s hard to go someplace and not have a wireless connection within 
earshot, or phone/computer shot.
Many of these services are free, but some still require some sort of payment. 
Most travel-oriented places, such as hotels, airports, and convention cen­
ters, offer free Wi-Fi connections to customers. Eventually, we should get to 
a point where free connection is always available, even if it isn’t always the 
best option.
Getting Carded
Installing and using your wireless card is very similar to installing and using 
any other PC Card in your laptop. The process consists of three main steps, 
but the order of those steps depends on a number of factors. The steps (in 
no particular order) follow:
	
✦	 Install the necessary driver software in your laptop PC.
	
✦	 Insert the card into the slot on the side of your laptop.
	
✦	 Configure your laptop for the selected service.
Reading the user manual that came with your wireless card is extremely 
important. That manual tells you the correct order for performing the installa­
tion steps, and the order is often dependent on the operating system version 
that’s installed on your laptop. That is, you may have to install the software 
drivers first on some operating system versions, and you may have to insert 
the card first on others — and this is for the exact same wireless card!

260
Getting Carded
No matter what type of wireless card you use, you can greatly extend the 
battery life in your laptop PC by either turning the card off or removing it 
when it is not in use.
Using a wireless data card
If you’ve ever bought a mobile phone, you’re probably aware that each 
device that uses the network has to be activated before it can be used. 
Buying a wireless data card and installing it into your laptop is only the first 
part of the task.
Although different mobile carriers follow different procedures, generally 
once you sign up for service you have to provide the unit ID for your wire­
less card to the carrier, who activates the card. As is the case with cell 
phones, the activation is specific to a particular unit ID, and this means that 
if you replace the wireless card, you need to cancel the old activation and 
then activate the new wireless card.
	
Wireless data providers offer a broad range of service plans (just as they 
do for voice service). In general, though, you sign up for either a specific 
amount of monthly data transfer or a specific amount of connect time. 
Running over your allocation can become quite expensive, so it’s important 
to not only sign up for the correct plan but also to monitor your usage to 
ensure that you don’t run up huge overage charges. Of course, any provider 
worth its salt also offers unlimited plans at a robust price.
Depending on the network that you’re connecting to, you’ll likely find that 
the wireless cellular data card functions much like a dial-up modem, only 
without wires. That is, you’ll use a small application (provided by your ser­
vice provider) to connect to the cellular network as needed and then discon­
nect once you no longer need the connection. These days, most wireless 
data cards are USB, so plug-and-play technology means that you’re up and 
running in no time.
Using a wireless network card
Using a wireless network card in your laptop is really the same thing as 
using your wireless home network on any of your PCs. The primary differ­
ence with a laptop PC is that it’s portable, and this enables you to take your 
laptop places where you can connect to other networks besides your home 
network. In fact, this means that the whole world of Wi-Fi hotspots becomes 
available to your wireless networked laptop PC.
	
Before you buy a wireless network card for your laptop PC, remember that 
many laptops now come with a wireless network adapter built in. Also, 
Windows Vista has quite capable wireless networking features built in, so 
you probably don’t need to rely on additional applications to help you locate 

Book V 
Chapter 1
Putting a Network 
in Your Lap(top)
261
Getting Carded
Wi-Fi hotspots. In fact, you’re not likely to find many laptop PCs made within 
the past couple of years that don’t already have a sufficient network card 
already built in. However, if you are using a laptop PC that is older, it is pos­
sible that it might not have an integrated network card, or even more likely, 
it might not be compatible with today’s more advanced wireless protocols.
You may have read about wireless security in previous chapters. Wireless 
security when you’re on the road with your laptop PC can be somewhat of a 
mixed bag: Some Wi-Fi hotspots are wide open, and others use the full range 
of available security features. In some cases you may be given a username 
and password that function for a limited period of time, or you may need to 
enter a security key to match that in use by the access point.
Even when you have all of the information that you need, making the con­
nection can sometimes be a bit difficult — especially if you need to enter the 
WEP or WPA security keys, because the configuration methods for wireless 
network cards can be rather confusing. In the past, a third-party application 
may have proved helpful in managing your wireless networks on your laptop 
PC. However, Microsoft has gotten their act together, and Windows Vista 
offers a wonderful Manage Wireless Network window, as shown in Figure 1-1.

Not only does it remember all those routers to which you’ve connected over

and keeps a pecking order, so that you always connect to the right network 
and the right time.

Getting Out and About
Getting Out and About
Laptop PCs are made for travel, but that doesn’t mean life on the road is 
always easy. After all, a lot can go wrong — especially if you’re depending on 
your laptop to help you do business or even just keep you from becoming 
lost in some strange locale.
I won’t bore you by repeating a bunch of pretty obvious information, such 
as how attractive laptop PCs are to thieves. Rather, look at some topics that 
can help you get more use from your laptop while you’re on that road trip.
Finding Wi-Fi hotspots
Because this book’s focus is on wireless topics, it makes sense to begin the 
discussion on traveling with a laptop PC with the subject of finding Wi-Fi 
hotspots. Quite simply, Wi-Fi hotspots are likely your primary means of con­
necting to the Internet and for sending and receiving e-mail.
A number of Web sites have lists of Wi-Fi hotspots. A quick Google search 
produces hundreds of hits. Some of these sites are better than others, but 
none of them are up-to-date enough to be your single source of information. 
Most of these sites depend on information supplied by volunteers, although 
some use lists of hotspot providers that are in some way affiliated with the 
site. Still, the lists do give you a starting point.
If you’re going on a road trip you may want to print out a couple of hotspot 
lists for your destination before you set out. That way, you have some idea 
of where to begin looking for an Internet connection.
Once you’re in the general area of a Wi-Fi hotspot, you have several choices 
for locating a usable signal:
	
✦	 Break out your laptop PC and see if the built-in software can find the 
Wi-Fi signal and allow you to connect.
	
✦	 Fire up your laptop and use a program or feature like Manage Wireless 
Network window (as mentioned earlier in this chapter) to locate any 
nearby Wi-Fi signals and then to make a connection to one of them.
	
✦	 Visit a Web site, such as www.thegobutton.com, and download a Wi-Fi 
finder. This quickly finds any free hotspots for you to connect or shows 
you the strongest ones available.
Of these three options, they are all equally good. Again, it comes down to a 
question of personal preference. There are some users who prefer using the 
out-of-the-box solutions that Microsoft provides. Other users may feel more

comfortable using a third-party application, such as the Go Button, as shown 
in Figure 1-2. At the end of the day, these options all provide the same ser­
vices, even if they don’t always follow the same path to get there.

Power backup on the road
Although not strictly a wireless issue, keeping your laptop powered while 
you’re on the road can be a challenge. Even the most power-stingy laptops 
don’t last through a full day of constant use on battery power, and if you’ve 
opted for one of the more power-hungry units, you are lucky to get more 
than about two hours on a full charge.
When you’re traveling, the weight of all of your equipment can become a 
real issue. It seems like the longer the trip, the heavier all of those separate 
little power adapters and cables seem. Sure, each one might weigh just a few 
ounces, but when you’re dragging everything down a long airport concourse 
to the farthest gate, that can feel like pounds.
One way to cut down on your travel weight is to buy a single power supply 
that works with all of your portable devices and with the power outlets in 
your hotel, your rental car, or in an airplane. While it’s true that the manu­
facturer of your laptop probably doesn’t offer such a great power supply 
solution, some companies do. For example, iGo Mobility Electronics, Inc. 
(www.igo.com) has just such a product. You can see it in Figure 1-3.
If you’re really going out to get away from it all (but can’t quite give up on 
your laptop), you might want something like the Notebook Solar Laptop 
Computer Charger from Sierra Solar Systems (www.sierrasolar.com/
manufacturers.php?manufacturer_id=144) shown in Figure 1-4. This 

264

handy unit can charge other devices like your cell phone when it isn’t 
powering your laptop and does good things for the planet by using solar 
power, too.
You may find that the higher-capacity solar charger is a good investment 
because it charges your laptop’s battery faster.

Printing while on the road
Some years ago when e-mail was first becoming popular, a number of pun­
dits predicted that we were rapidly moving toward the “paperless office” of 
the future. It probably would have been a good idea to invest in the stocks of 
paper companies at that time, because it’s pretty clear that we’re a long way 
from eliminating paper.
When you’re on the road, it can be difficult to find a convenient way to print 
those documents that simply can’t wait until you get back home. Sometimes 
there simply is no choice — you have to get a printout.
Carrying your own printer
There are those who like to carry their own printer with them on the road. 
Personally, I think it’s a great idea weighed down by reality. Even the most 
travel-compatible personal printers still require space in my travel bag.
If you do opt to bring along a printer, you shouldn’t expect the sort of print 
speed or paper-handling capabilities in a portable printer that you take for 
granted with a desktop printer, but then I really don’t want to try packing 
along my HP Color LaserJet on a trip, either.
The available models are always changing, but you can find a quick list of 
what’s available on Amazon.com and by searching for “small travel print­
ers.” It’s hard to stay one step ahead of technology, where new hardware is 
always becoming smaller, cheaper, and offering better performance.
For true road warriors, you are better served by using the print services that 
are available in your hotel.
Using a printing service
Another on-the-road printing option you may want to consider is a printing 
service such as PrintMe (www.printme.com). This service is available at 
some Wi-Fi hotspots, and it enables you to print to a printer at the hotspot 
without loading any printer drivers.
If a FedEx Kinko’s print shop is nearby, you may find their printing service 
pretty handy, too. See www.fedex.com/us/officeprint/main/index.
html for more information on getting signed up for this service.
Printing using a USB key
Any office you visit probably has a printer you could use if only you had a 
way to get your document to that printer. Few people are likely to want to 
open up their network so you can access it, but there’s no reason you can’t 
use a little innovative thinking to get around that problem.

266
Lounging at Home
One very simple solution is to use a USB memory key such as the SanDisk 
MiniCruzer (www.sandisk.com), shown in Figure 1-5, to transfer your docu­
ment to a PC on the network and print it from that PC. You can even open 
the document directly from the USB memory key so that you aren’t storing a 
copy of the document on the PC connected to the printer.
	
Figure 1-5:

data 
between  
dif­ferent 
PCs.
	
USB memory keys are extremely handy because they enable you to quickly 
exchange data between different PCs using a very tiny package that easily 
fits into your pocket. All modern PCs have USB ports, and the USB key 
simply appears as an additional disk drive. To a great extent. USB keys have 
replaced floppy disk drives, and they’ve become very popular because they 
hold so much more than a diskette and work with any PC.
Faxing: Your last resort
If you can’t find any other way to print but absolutely must have a printout 
of an important document, the desperate have one last resort: sending a fax 
to a nearby fax machine. True, the quality of the printout probably won’t win 
any awards, but when you’re out of options, it pays to be resourceful.
To send a fax, you either need a modem in your laptop PC and access to a 
phone line or Internet access and an account with an Internet-based fax ser­
vice, such as eFax (www.efax.com).
Lounging at Home
Thus far this chapter has primarily focused on the mobile uses for a net­
worked laptop PC. However, no law says you can’t have a little fun with your

laptop when you’re at home. Consider the following ways that having a wire­
less laptop PC might enhance your home life:
	
✦	 On a nice, summer afternoon when you’re stuck working on a report for 
that boss who always drops a bomb on you just before the weekend, 
why not take your laptop out to a shady spot in the backyard and work 
out there? You still can do your online research, thanks to your wire­
less Internet connection, and who knows — maybe the fresh air will 
inspire you.
	
✦	 If you’re having some friends over for a cookout on your deck, take your 
laptop and a set of speakers out, too. Then you can listen to an Internet 
radio station and never have to worry about changing CDs on your 
stereo system.
	
✦	 It’s amazing how much information is available on the Internet these 
days. If you need to recalibrate your underground sprinkler system, tune 
up your furnace, or track down the wiring harness layout in your car so 
that you can add a CD changer, the information is probably online some­
where. If you take your laptop to your job you can view the information 
onscreen as you work and have easy access in the event you need a bit 
more detail.
	
✦	 When you’re absolutely out of ideas of what to make for dinner, bring 
your laptop into the kitchen. With the multitude of cooking-related 
sites, you can quickly find a whole bunch of ideas for recipes using 
ingredients you have on hand.
Wireless laptop PCs are awfully handy, whether you’re a road warrior or 
simply want a convenient PC that you can move anywhere in your home 
without a second thought.

t’s hard to believe how widespread the use of wireless devices is these 
days. In fact, not so long ago (try as few as five years ago), you were 
pretty limited in options. At the time, your options were basically limited 
to a Pocket PC or Palm personal digital assistant (PDA). If you we’re in luck, 
the device may have had Wireless access but likely few places to actually 
use it.
Fast-forward a few years to the present and, my, has the world changed! 
First, the former market leaders barely have a seat at the table anymore. 
Technology moved quickly and combined the best of both products to 
create a new series of smartphones. Of course, wireless devices aren’t lim­
ited to souped-up mobile phones; Apple offers the iTouch, which is basically 
a smartphone without an actual phone. The current kings are Windows 
Mobile and Google’s new Android operating systems.
Any device that is Internet-driven offers wireless capability. If it doesn’t, it’s 
not worth discussing. After all, even printers offer wireless capability these 
days! Wireless devices offer widespread Wi-Fi connectivity, so that you can 
connect to your network or a wireless hotspot while at home or on the road. 
These devices let you truly organize and manage your life, which may be a 
troubling sign for our future, if you think about it.
In this chapter I talk about connecting both a handheld computer and a 
functioning router to a wireless network. After you’re on the network, you 
can do just about anything you can on your desktop computer:
	
✦	 Check your e-mail.
	
✦	 Surf the Internet (albeit on a much smaller screen).
	
✦	 Access PC files located on your network. This includes documents, as 
well as video and music files.

270
Reaching Out to the Wireless World
You also can skip the cradle you normally use to synchronize information 
between your handheld computer and desktop computer. Instead, you can 
do it over your wireless network.
Want to check your mail but the ballgame is in the ninth inning? No problem, 
as now you can connect to your network and access your messages (and the 
scores of other games) while lying on your couch. It’s a rough life, and I feel 
your pain.
Reaching Out to the Wireless World
Connecting your wireless device to a wireless network is very easy. In fact, 
the wireless connectivity aspect is so important to wireless devices that it’s 
been that device makers minimize your role in connecting to a network. For 
more devices, connecting to the Internet isn’t much different from how you 
do it with your personal computer.
Here’s how you connect your wireless device to a network:
	
1.	 Turn on wireless networking if it’s not already enabled.
	
	 This step is different for each device. Some devices may require you 
to call up a connectivity-related settings page or perform some sort of 
key manipulation to turn on your wireless connection. For example, in 
Figure 2-1, an HTC mobile device simply offers a switch-type button. 
Alternatively, you can also use Start➪Settings➪Connections➪Wi-Fi and 
select the check box to enable wireless connectivity.
	
2.	 Select an available hotspot that is detected by your wireless device 
and validate it.
	
3.	 Select Internet Explorer or any other Web browser of your choice that 
is supported and available on your wireless device.
	
4.	 Browse to a Web page to confirm your wireless connection is working. 
That’s all there is to it.
When traveling, your mobile device can connect to a Wi-Fi network as easily 
as Windows Vista can since Windows Mobile and Vista share similar zero-
configuration technology. This makes it simple for them to detect and con­
nect to nearby Wi-Fi networks.
This saves you the hassle of configuring your device every time you’re in 
range of a wireless network. Of course, as with Windows Vista, once you 
connect to a wireless network with your wireless device, most devices will 
remember the security key (WEP/WPA) so that you can quickly recall a fre­
quently used network. If you connect to a new network, you’ll still need to 
know the security key to connect the first time.

Using other devices
The first section of this chapter was designed for those of you using 
Windows Mobile devices. However, accessing your network is just as easy, 
or sometimes even easier, using other platforms.
For example, if you are using an iPhone, simply access the Settings button 
on the touch screen and select Wi-Fi. From this page, you can opt whether 
or not to turn it off. When Wi-Fi is enabled and connected to a network, the 
standard Wi-Fi connection icon appears on the phone. What’s particularly 
cool about the iPhone is that it always tries to connect to the last connected 
network. If it can’t find it, it will go through its list of known networks until it 
finds one that works. Otherwise, you can always select the desired network 
and enter its password (if necessary).

272
Reaching Out to the Wireless World
If you’re using Android, things can be even easier. If you use Android’s Wi-Fi 
Toggle widget, it’s as simple as clicking a button on the phone’s toolbar. 
Otherwise, you have to go through the Settings menu, which is accessible 
from Home➪Menu➪Settings➪Wireless controls. The Wireless controls page 
lets you turn on or off your wireless connection.
Manually configuring your network
You can manually configure the wireless network settings if you are using 
Windows Mobile, which is helpful if the automatic network connection 
feature is not working or you have some special situation. Here’s how you 
access the configuration settings:
	
1.	 Click the selectivity icon, shown in Figure 2-2, at the top of the screen.

Chapter 3: Synchronizing Devices 
over a Network
In This Chapter
✓	Synchronizing with Windows Mobile
✓	Synchronizing with other operating systems
✓	Using RSS feeds
I
’m assuming that you’ve successfully connected your wireless device to 
your wireless network and are ready for the next step: actually using that 
wireless link to move data across the network. If you’re not there yet, check 
out Book V, Chapter 2, which provides the instructions for connecting.
In this chapter, I discuss synchronizing your wireless device with informa­
tion on your desktop PC. Wireless synchronization has made some prog­
ress, but it has also taken a few steps back at the same time. While that may 
sound contradictory, it’s very much true. For example, most systems (hello, 
Symbian and iPhone) don’t have any wireless synchronization options avail­
able at the time of press. Windows Mobile, on the other hand, does offer a 
wireless synchronization, but not everyone can use it.
I also tell you how you can add content to your wireless device (such as 
news and articles) using RSS feeds and your RSS hub. You can update your 
wireless device using the RSS hub and take reading material when you 
travel.
Getting Windows Mobile to Coordinate
You can synchronize your wireless device using Windows Mobile with your 
computer in two ways. You can
	
✦	 Connect the device to your computer using a USB cable.
	
✦	 Connect wirelessly and update your device.

280
Getting Windows Mobile to Coordinate
If you are running Windows Vista, you will use the Windows Mobile Device 
Center to synchronize your device with your computer. The version that 
shipped initially with Windows Visa has been updated, so be sure to update. 
It’s important to make sure you have the most up to date version for com­
patibility with the most recent wireless devices, which is available at 
www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/synchronize/
device-center-download.mspx.
	
How often you synch really depends on how often you update your wireless 
device and computer. Personally, I tend to only sync data such as contacts 
and appointments, so I only need to sync when I update Outlook. However, I 
use my wireless or 3G+ connection to update other applications, such as RSS 
Hub, which I discuss later in this chapter.
Running with Windows Mobile Device Center
Windows Mobile Device Center is the new and improved version of 
ActiveSync, which went the way of the dodo bird when Windows Vista was 
released. It has a much more intuitive, graphic-friendly interface that is easy 
and comfortable to use. The first time you plug your wireless device to your 
computer running Windows Vista, it automatically opens the Mobile Device 
Center and configures your device with Windows.
If you still need to start the Windows Mobile Device Center, here’s how 
to do it:
	
1.	 Choose Start➪All Programs.
	
2.	 Select Windows Mobile Device Center.
	
	 The application opens and displays the name and a picture of your wire­
less device, if properly connected, as shown in Figure 3-1. If no device 
is connected, a generic image of a wireless device is displayed and says 
“not connected.” Your wireless device is automatically synced.
	
3.	 Select Mobile Device Settings.
	
4.	 Click Connection settings.
	
	 Make sure that Allow USB connections is selected. If you want to be able 
to sync wireless using Bluetooth, make sure that the Allow connections 
to one of the following option is selected with Bluetooth in the drop-
down menu.
	
5.	 Click OK.

Running with ActiveSync
You can use Microsoft’s ActiveSync software to wirelessly synchronize infor­
mation between your wireless device and your desktop computer. Usually I 
don’t discuss Windows XP in this book, but since there are enough users still 
working with this operating system, do keep in mind that you must install 
Microsoft ActiveSync before you can synchronize your wireless device with 
information on another computer on your network. You can download the 
latest version of ActiveSync from www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/
en-us/downloads/microsoft/activesync-download.mspx.
Before you can synchronize your wireless device, make sure the settings are 
correct on the ActiveSync software running on your desktop PC.
Now, let’s synchronize:
	
1.	 Click Start➪All Programs.
	
2.	 Click Microsoft ActiveSync.
	
	 The ActiveSync dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Click File.
	
4.	 Click Mobile Device, if you have more than one device connected or 
registered with Active Sync.
	
	 Menu of available wireless devices appears.
	
5.	 Select the wireless device that you want to synchronize, if necessary; 
otherwise your device appears as shown in Figure 3-3.
	
	 In this case, there is only one device, and it’s called HTC87. (Sometimes 
even computer stuff is easy to follow.)
	
6.	 Click File.
	
7.	 Click Connection Settings.
	
	 The Connection Settings dialog box appears.
	
8.	 Confirm that this choice is selected: Allow Network (Ethernet) and 
Remote Access Service (RAS) Server Connection with This Desktop 
Computer.
	
9.	 Click OK.

Syncing information for your wireless device
Here’s how you initiate synchronization from your handheld computer from 
your wireless device. Be careful, though, this shows you how to initiate the 
synchronization from your wireless device and not your computer; it doesn’t 
show how to do it on a wireless network. In other words, you need to have a 
USB connection to do this. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Start➪System.
	
	 The System dialog box appears.
	
2.	 Click ActiveSync.
	
	 ActiveSync screen appears.
	
3.	 Click Sync.
	
	 Your wireless device shows Connecting and then Synchronizing, shown 
in Figure 3-4.
When it’s done, the screen displays Not Connected. The ActiveSync software 
on both your PC and handheld show the last date and time they connected 
to each other. If the synchronization is not occurring, make sure you have 
a working wireless connection and that your Pocket PC is close enough to a 
wireless access point.

Make sure Microsoft ActiveSync is also running on your desktop PC.
Syncing information wirelessly
You also can synchronize your wireless device by using Bluetooth wireless 
technology instead of a Wi-Fi connection. Bluetooth works over a much 
shorter range — about 30 feet — but can be an easier way to connect your 
handheld to your desktop PC at close distances. In addition, with the intro­
duction of more and more Bluetooth-enabled cellular telephones, it’s also 
a way to synchronize information between your laptop computer and your 
mobile phone.

Getting Other Platforms to Coordinate
Getting Other Platforms to Coordinate
This chapter demonstrates how you can synchronize your wireless device if 
you are using the Windows Mobile operating system, but it’s worth remem­
bering that all mobile device platforms offer this capability as well.
Each platform has its own proprietary software package that allows you to 
transfer data (e-mails, contacts, files, pictures) between your computer and 
the wireless device. In most cases, this is done using a USB connection. I 
recommend using the documentation provided for your wireless device that 
will certainly show you how to set up synchronization.
Generally speaking, your wireless device ships with a CD-ROM that allows 
you to install the necessary software on your computer. Once you con­
nect your phone to the computer using USB, your computer automatically 
launches and recognizes the wireless device.
For example, if you are using a Nokia N95, a suite of applications is provided 
to let you synchronize your data quickly and easily, as shown in Figure 3-5. 
Not only do these proprietary applications provide you with synchroniza­
tion tools, but also additional applications to help you handle other often-
used features, such as for photos and music.
If you are using a Palm-based wireless device, such as the Treo, you can use 
Treo Desktop to synchronize your data, as shown in Figure 3-6. This device 
is a little more complicated, as it also requires you to have Palm desktop 
installed, along with a sync user. In other words, you need two separate 
applications to sync your device!
	
Figure 3-5: 
Nokia also 
allows 
you to 
synchronize 
files, music, 
and photos.
	

286
Using RSS Feeds
	
Figure 3-6: 
For Treo, 
you need 
two applica-
tions to

data.
	
If you want to synchronize your device wirelessly, you’ll need to make 
sure that both your computer and the wireless device support Bluetooth 
technology.
Using RSS Feeds
When wireless devices first became the rage, there was a program called 
AvantGo that was extremely valuable to users. It allowed you to take reading 
material when you traveled, or to update the information from your device 
while you were on the road over a wireless connection and read a miniature 
version of the newspaper.
Of course, like all good ideas, it became copied and was soon made obsolete 
by its peers. This is the sad story of AvantGo, which was made redundant 
and eventually stopped publishing in June 2009. Though there are a number 
of imitators available to take AvantGo’s place, the most useful application 
for obtaining information on the go is the RSS feed.
This publishing format is a widely used standard for publishing Web content – 
including blog posts, news articles, and multimedia – as an XML file or feed that

Chapter 3

287
Using RSS Feeds
can be read by a reader on your desktop computer or wireless device. Likewise, 
you can also “subscribe” to RSS feeds on Web sites that allow you to track its 
content easily from your e-mail client or an RSS reader.
Similar to AvantGo, an RSS reader (such as RSS hub) allows you to select 
content sources (for example, Yahoo and BBC News) called channels to 
which you can subscribe. Using your wireless network connection, you 
can update the channel’s content, which is displayed as a list of entries, as 
shown in Figure 3-7.
By double-clicking the article header, you can obtain the first few lines of the 
article as shown in Figure 3-8, followed by a link, which can be clicked to dis­
play the rest of the article in your device’s Web browser.

A number of RSS readers are available for use with wireless devices. Most of 
them offer a similar group of features; the right one really depends on your 
personal preferences. I choose to use RSS Hub because it was included on 
my wireless device and satisfies my requirements for getting information 
quickly.
To use RSS Hub on Windows Mobile:
	
1.	 Click Start➪Web➪RSS Hub.
	
	 The program launches and displays All Categories.
	
2.	 Click Refresh to update each channel in the list for the category.
	
	 If you wish to organize your categories, click Menu➪Categories➪

Figure 3-10.
	
5.	 Click Finish.
	
	 The newly selected channel(s) appear in the list of channels.
If you have an unlimited data plan and have the necessary battery life on 
your phone, you may want to set RSS Hub’s options to auto-update feeds. 
This is of value if you find that you like to catch up on the news and read RSS 
feeds regularly. The advantage is that the information is always up to date 
(you can determine how often it is refreshed), but it can also be a disadvan­
tage. First, if your data plan is not unlimited, you must watch that you do 
not download too often lest you go over your allotment for the month. Also, 
every time your mobile device performs a content refresh, it uses battery 
power. If you need to use your phone frequently during the day and don’t 
have the ability to charge your device until the end of the day, this could 
waste valuable batter life.
To set auto-update settings, from RSS Hub, do the following:
	
1.	 Choose Menu➪Options.
	
2.	 From the Auto Update Mode drop-down, select the desired update 
cycle.
	
3.	 Using the next group of drop-down menus, select the frequency for 
the automatic update.

Hopefully, now you have a good idea on how to keep your wireless device 
up to speed — and in sync with your desktop computer. Having a wireless 
device that has information, such as e-mail addresses, that isn’t available 
when you use your desktop can be pretty frustrating. Save yourself some 
time, tears, and gray hair by making sure the two have the same information.

Chapter 4: Picking a BlackBerry
In This Chapter
✓	Setting up the BlackBerry
✓	Grabbing your e-mail
✓	Using BlackBerry as a phone
✓	The future of BlackBerry
T
echnology can be quite an amazing thing, especially when you think 
about how far Internet and mobile technology have come in relatively 
so little time. Not so long ago, a little device that hooked on your belt and 
could make calls around the world, surf the Internet, and send e-mails 
seemed like something out of the year 3000.
One device, called the BlackBerry, helped realize that future. If you look 
back just a few short years, sure, it lacked many of the standard features 
that most people take for granted today, but it still was one of the first 
devices out there that truly helped you go mobile!
Of course, BlackBerry faces some stiff competition from other device manu­
facturers. This competition resulted in BlackBerry improving and updating 
their offering to be more in line with what mobile office users really need 
today, including wireless capabilities and touch screen technology.
Whether or not to make the move to BlackBerry really depends on you, your 
preferences, and how you actually plan on using your mobile device. For those 
who like the all-in-one nature of the device (e-mail. Internet, applications), 
but also prefer having a keyboard for typing, you may want to check out the 
BlackBerry Web site at www.blackberry.com and see what’s cooking!
Avoiding a Raspberry
A BlackBerry is a suitable way to communicate for several reasons:
	
✦	 It’s wireless, so you can take it with you wherever you go.
	
✦	 It’s small and light, fitting in a holster you can wear on your belt.
	
✦	 It gives you around-the-clock access to your e-mail.
	
✦	 It provides 24-hour access to the Web.

294
	
✦	 It works well with corporate e-mail systems, so workers can easily use 
their BlackBerrys to stay in touch.
	
✦	 Newer models provide touch screen technology, which makes navigat­
ing your device even easier
Of course, these features were once hot selling points, but now they are 
so standard that I wouldn’t even tout these features. As I said before, what 
really sets the BlackBerry apart from the rest — even after all these years — 
is its keyboard feature.
	
You can read more by visiting the BlackBerry Web site at www.black
berry.com.
Which carriers offer the BlackBerry? Here’s a short list, which doesn’t 
include smaller telecommunications (or telecom, if you want to be sleek, 
too) providers:
	
✦	 AT&T Wireless
	
✦	 Cingular
	
✦	 Nextel
	
✦	 T-Mobile
	
✦	 Verizon
When you subscribe to BlackBerry from one of these services, make sure 
you read the fine print carefully. Some providers may offer a voice and data 
plan that allows you unlimited Web and messaging access, as well as a cer­
tain number of minutes per month. Other plans may only offer data plans 
and charge you a higher-than-normal voice rate for calls made using your 
BlackBerry.
Picking a Model, Any Model
The decision about which BlackBerry model to use may be made for you 
if you have a particular cellular phone carrier in mind. Whichever model 
that carrier has is the one you will get. They may sell more than one model. 
(Models with built-in cell phones are similar to the PalmOne Treo 600, which 
is one of the mobile phones I discuss in Book VI, Chapter 1. They also are 
similar to the Sidekick II, which I write about later in this chapter.)
Ask yourself some of these questions when deciding which BlackBerry 
model to purchase:
	
✦	 Is the newest technology important to me? Or do I just want functionality 
and can leave the stylish technology to the hipsters?

Book V
Chapter 4

✦	 Which models are available from my carrier of choice? If you like ABC 
Wireless, but they don’t have the model you want, you may need to go 
with another carrier or settle with the BlackBerry model they provide.
	
✦	 Do I want a color screen or is a monochrome screen okay? Remember 
that e-mail messages, for better or for worse, read the same either way.
	
✦	 Do I want to have a touch screen to easily access my applications or can 
I live with the standard kind of screen?
Currently, Blackberry is definitely a competitor with other smartphone ven­
dors; though it seems that they are more in catch-up mode than innovation. 
For example, the most recent model, Storm, doesn’t offer Wi-Fi capabilities, 
something that is corrected in the upcoming Storm2 release. BlackBerry also 
released their first touch screen device a full 18 months after LG, then HTC.
The current series available is the 8900+ GPS Wi-Fi Series. This series 
includes the BlackBerry Bold (9000), BlackBerry Curve 8900, BlackBerry 
Tour (9630), and BlackBerry Storm (9500/9530). 
What makes these models so popular is that they offer everything a profes­
sional or high-end phone should: decent graphics, high-speed Internet/wire­
less capabilities, e-mail (including push mail), and GPS capabilities.
Navigating a BlackBerry
BlackBerry owes much of its popularity to its ease of use. Other than the tra­
ditionally laid out keyboard — although much smaller, so get those thumbs 
in shape — the device has very few buttons. It has three non-keyboard buttons:
	
✦	 Phone button: Push this button to go to the screen where you either can 
pick a phone number from your address book or enter a phone number 
from the keyboard.
	
✦	 Trackwheel: You can whirl the wheel with your thumb and then press 
when you reach something you’d like to do, such as run an application.
	
✦	 Escape key: Press this when you’re in an application and want to return 
to the main menu. Think of it as the key that helps when you get lost: 
You can escape to safety.
Turning it on and off
Start where all things BlackBerry start: the on button. On some models, it’s 
the silver button on the far-bottom right of the keyboard. On the Storm, 
it’s the button on the side of the device. If you press and hold this button, 
the BlackBerry turns off. Push it again and the BlackBerry turns on.

Sending and receiving e-mail
Sending and receiving e-mail through the BlackBerry certainly is what has 
made the brand name synonymous with portable, mobile e-mail messaging.
You can receive e-mail through a BlackBerry three ways:
	
✦	 Personal e-mail account access through the BlackBerry Web client. This 
is for e-mail addresses like my@emailaddress.com.
	
✦	 Business/corporate e-mail access through the BlackBerry Enterprise 
Server, which lets workers grab their messages from Microsoft Exchange 
or IBM Lotus Domino.
	
✦	 BlackBerry e-mail via an e-mail address that looks like mlelrick@black
berry.net. You receive messages through BlackBerry Web client. These 
addresses are assigned to you by BlackBerry.
Reading e-mail messages
E-mail is the first application on the BlackBerry screen, so it’s fast and easy 
to jump right in and check for messages. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	 Making sure the e-mail icon is highlighted, click the trackwheel.
	
	 The e-mail message screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.

2.	 Double-click the trackwheel to open the message.
	
3.	 Click the Escape button when you want to return to the main menu.
	
	 Otherwise, use the menu to perform another function on the e-mail mes­
sage. That’s it.
	
	 The first click of the trackwheel opens a menu that, in addition to open­
ing a message, lets you do these things:
 
• File a message
 
• Mark a message as unopened

	 One Time E-mail screen appears.
	
4.	 Type the e-mail address.
	
	 You can use the spacebar to insert the @ sign into the e-mail address. 
Clicking the spacebar a second time inserts a period into the address. 
This lets you enter an address quicker because you don’t need to press 
any special keys to access the symbols and punctuation keys.
	
5.	 Press the Return key.
	
	 The Subject line appears.
	
6.	 Enter a subject.

Making a phone call
You can make a phone call from the BlackBerry a couple different ways. One 
way uses the dedicated phone call button on the top of the unit, while the 
other involves selecting the Phone icon on the device’s Home screen.
To use the dedicated phone call button, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the dedicated phone call button on the top of the BlackBerry.
	
	 The Phone screen appears.
	
2.	 Select One Time Dial or begin entering the number.
	
	 The Enter Phone Number dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Enter a phone number.
	
4.	 Select Call.
	
	 BlackBerry dials the number.
To place a phone call from the Home screen, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Phone icon.
	
	 The Phone screen appears.
	
2.	 Select One Time Dial or begin entering the number.
	
	 The Enter Phone Number dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Enter a phone number.
	
4.	 Select Call.
	
	 That phone on the other side should be ringing.
Clicking a telephone number in an e-mail, for example, makes the BlackBerry 
call that number automatically. In addition, if you click an e-mail address 
inside a message, the BlackBerry automatically composes a message with 
that address. It also works with Web addresses; clicking them fires up the 
browser.

Browsing the Web
Using a BlackBerry to access the Internet used to be like using a spoon to 
dredge the ocean. Most Internet sites are not designed for viewing on such 
a small screen, although the BlackBerry is a way to read Web content in a 
pinch. Fortunately, the newer Blackberry models have improved browser 
rendering, and more and more Web sites are developing mobile versions of 
their Web sites to facilitate surfing on these small, handheld devices.
There are several ways to open a Web page. Here are the steps for entering a 
Web address in the BlackBerry and visiting that Web site:
	
1.	 From the Home screen, click the Browser icon.
	
	 The Browser Bookmarks screen appears.
	
2.	 Click the trackwheel to view the menu.
	
	 The menu appears.
	
3.	 Click Go To, which brings up the Go To dialog box.
	
4.	 Enter the Web address.
	
	 I already told you about the trick of pressing the Space key to insert a 
key. You also can press Shift + Space to insert a forward slash (/).
	
5.	 Click OK.
	
	 BlackBerry’s browser loads and, hopefully, the Web site you requested 
appears.
Special versions of two popular Web sites are designed for small Web 
browsers l: www.google.com/wml and mobile.yahoo.com/home. I dis­
cuss many of these Web services and others in Book V, Chapter 2.
If you’re strolling through Boston’s Logan 
Interna­tional Airport and you look a little shady 
to Massachusetts State Police officers, a 
BlackBerry may be unholstered long before 
a gun is drawn. The state police are using the 
devices to perform background checks on sus­
picious individuals. The BlackBerry connects to 
a database called LocatePlus, which contains 
information from various sources about more 
than 200 million U.S. residents. The database, 
based on the data, assigns a security rating to 
everyone. All of this information is available via 
the BlackBerry.

Chapter 5: Finding Wi-Fi Hotspots
In This Chapter
✓	Using Wi-Fi directories
✓	Dreaming about airports, hotels, and clouds
✓	Thinking about security
Your laptop and your smartphone are set up for wireless networking, 
and you’re restless to connect to the Internet somewhere outside your 
home or office. You’ve heard about hotspots, which are places with public 
Internet access. How can you find them?
Luckily, you can turn to several places for this information before venturing 
from home. In this chapter I talk about Wi-Fi directories, as well as some 
public projects that are trying to make wireless access available to every­
one. Of course, with the preponderance of hot spots these days, it’s really 
easy just to turn on your wireless device and see what’s available! From 
restaurants, to hotels, to bookstores, more and more businesses are offer­
ing some sort of Wi-Fi coverage — some free, some paid.
Getting Thee to a Directory
How do you find Wi-Fi heat in the spots you plan to travel? The quickest 
way is to do some homework before you leave, searching one of several 
large databases on the Internet for hotspots. Table 5-1 describes some of 
the largest online directories. WAP is a security protocol that scrambles 
your wireless communications to keep them from prying eyes.

criteria. A search results page is 
shown in Figure 5-1. A group of mini 
directories separates free hotspots. 
Offline versions are available. You

Paying for the Goods: Commercial Providers
I wish everything were free (except this book!), but sometimes you need to 
turn to commercial Wi-Fi providers when you travel. I present you with a list 
of the major ones:
	
✦	 T-Mobile at www.t-mobile.com/hotspot/. The nation’s largest 
public hotspot provider sells Wi-Fi access at 45,000 locations worldwide, 
including Starbucks, FedEx Kinko’s copy centers, and Borders book­
stores. It also provides service in some major airports, as well as the 
frequent-flyer club lounges for Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and 
United Airlines. As I write this, T-Mobile has three different ways to pay 
for access:
 
• T-Mobile Unlimited national. The subscription includes unlimited 
minutes for $9.99 a month for qualifying T-Mobile voice customers.
 
• Unlimited national. The subscription includes unlimited minutes for 
$29.99 a month if paid a year in advance or $39.99 a month if paid 
month to month.
 
• DayPass. You can purchase this prepaid access for no minimum 
commitment. It costs $7.99 for 24 continuous hours.
 
• Pay as you go. It costs $6 per login for the first hour with a minimum 
user session of 60 minutes, with additional minutes costing 10 
cents each.

Paying for the Goods: Making a Commitment
306
	
✦	 Boingo Wireless at www.boingo.com. This large provider of hotspots 
boasts more than 100,000 locations. Boingo charges $9.95 a month for 
unlimited connection time in North America. For world travelers, there 
are more sophisticated (read: expensive plans) that run $59.00 per 
month.
	
✦	 Wayport at www.wayport.com. Wayport is now AT&T Wireless, which 
offers a national plan for $19.99 per month. Plans for Europe are also 
available to national customers.
Paying for the Goods: Making a Commitment
If you’re a road warrior, as I have been over the years, it’s likely that you’re 
going to want something a little more reliable than rolling the dice on a free 
Internet connections or an underperforming, yet expensive, option. Up until 
a few short years ago, hotspots were our best option. Of course, the problem 
was that arranging your schedule to only be in places that offered a Brand X 
hotspot was hardly convenient or practical.
Entering the 21st century, wireless providers took a new approach and 
stopped advertising their hotspot access and replaced it with a full-blown 
wireless broadband service. Rather than depending on your wireless device, 
these subscriptions were solely for laptop or netbook users and depended on 
a USB-device that you would use — along with an application — to connect to 
your provider’s broadband network over a GSM, 3G, or 4G network. The down­
load speeds for these connections are more than adequate for most business 
travelers; however, it’s important to note that performance is still not as fast 
as at home over your wireless connection. Currently, most providers in the 
United States provide connection speeds of up to 1.4MB/1.5MB.
Searching made easier
T-Mobile used to offer a helpful tool called 
Connection Manager, which helped you find 
a nearby hotspot. It was replaced by Web 
Connect, which doesn’t appear to offer this 
feature — rather, it’s a plug in and go feature — 
but you can still download Connection Manager 
online if you’re really interested in using it; just 
don’t expect any support from T-Mobile.
Boingo Wireless has similar software avail­
able for Windows computers and Pocket PCs. 
You can download it from www.boingo.com/
download-boingo.php, though a mobile version 
is also available for download. It also helps you 
connect to Boingo’s virtual private network 
(VPN) service, which means you make a secure 
connection to the company’s network so that 
all of your Internet traffic is encrypted (read: 
jumbled and hence safer). It’s a virtual loincloth 
for public hotspots.
A handy feature that both utilities share: They 
detect all nearby Wi-Fi signals, whether or not 
they’re part of the companies’ network. You 
can easily connect to any of these detected 
hotspots.

There are five major mobile broadband providers in the United States; you 
might recognize them because most of them also offer voice plans. They are
	
✦	 Verizon Wireless: One of the major players on the mobile broadband 
scene, Verizon offers a variety of plans for mobile devices such as 
netbooks, laptops, and USB modems that range from a day pass ($15/
session) to monthly plans ($39.95–$59.99) that offer 250MB and 5GB 
monthly allowances, respectively. Verizon also offers a variety of plans 
for other mobile devices, including handsets or smartphones (www.
verizonwireless.com/b2c/mobilebroadband/).
	
✦	 AT&T: A solid network with a good coverage page; AT&T offers a 
number of data plans for handheld wireless devices, such as smart­
phones and BlackBerry devices. There is also a single data plan for 
mobile laptop broadband. This package offers up to 5GB traffic per 
month for $60. (www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/
cell-phone-plans/data-connect-plans.jsp).
	
✦	 Sprint: Another one of the major players; it is now teamed up with 
Nextel to offer pretty impressive coverage. Sprint offers a variety of 
plans for mobile devices, including its Sprint wireless broadband cards, 
which let you connect to Sprint’s national wireless broadband net­
work. The mobile broadband connections range from $59.99 to $69.99 
(if you’re a voice customer) (http://nextelonline.nextel.com/
NASApp/onlinestore/en/Action/DisplayPlans).
	
✦	 T-Mobile: T-Mobile offers a pretty reliable network that always seemed 
to be around when I needed it. They offer not just standard data plans 
for wireless devices, but also BlackBerry and SideKick (a T-Mobile 
original) wireless data plans. These plans range from $39.98 to $59.99 
per month (www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/Cell-Phone-
Plans.aspx?catgroup=Indvidual-cell-phone-plan&WT.mc_
n=Individual_PlanFirstTile1&WT.mc_t=OnsiteAd).
	
✦	 U.S. Cellular: This is probably the least robust option available in terms 
of coverage, but it does offer some good plans for the budget conscious. 
Data plans (not all high speed) range from $9.95 (bare bones service) to 
$49.95(http://easyedge.uscc.com/easyedge/jsp/plans.jsp).
Going Public
The beauty of Wi-Fi networking is its mobility. It gives you the freedom to 
wander far from home and still have a solid connection to the Internet. You 
can find Wi-Fi hotspots around the globe, with the United States, Europe, and 
Asia leading the way as they add thousands of new access points every year.

In airports
Second to your hotel room, where do you spend most of your time during 
a business trip? It’s probably not in the meeting or at the conference. More 
likely, it’s the airports you pass through, especially with the increased secu­
rity that forces you to arrive earlier and stay longer. Of course, layovers add 
to the fray.
That’s why it’s a good idea to know, before you leave on your trip, which air­
ports offer what Wi-Fi services. Some may offer free access, a combination of 
limited free access and commercial access, or commercial access only.
Generally speaking, paid wireless access will run you about $9.95 for 24 
hours or $49.95 per month for unlimited service. If you’re stuck in one of 
these airports for several hours, ten bucks may seem like a bargain as you 
pull out your laptop to check your e-mail.
Here’s a list of major airports and some of the wireless Internet services 
they offer:
	
✦	 Chicago O’Hare International. Concourse and Boingo are the provid­
ers here, which cover terminals 1, 2, and 3. Unlike many other airports, 
these services don’t come for free.
	
✦	 Los Angeles International Airport. Boingo Wireless rules the roost here 
and covers no less than seven terminals.
	
✦	 Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport. Boingo and T-Mobile provide 
coverage in various areas throughout the airport, though Boingo is your 
cheaper option if you plan on surfing more than an hour.
	
✦	 Atlanta Hartsfield International. A-town offers one of the most exten­
sive airport wireless lists, offering Boingo, Concourse, Sprint PCS, 
Access, Opti-fi, and T-Mobile. I forgot to mention that none of them are 
free.
	
✦	 Denver International Airport. Not surprisingly, Boingo is the mile-high 
Wi-Fi provider (are you sensing a trend?).
Obviously, any of these services can change in an Internet minute. However, 
these snapshots of Wi-Fi access available in the larger airports at least gives 
you an idea of what’s out there. As with other hotspots, you can check avail­
ability on one of the hotspot directories listed in Table 5-1.
In hotels
Not so long ago, it was a pretty big deal when I found a hotel offering high-
speed, wired Internet access. It beat a slow, dial-up connection, and I was 
able to work better in my hotel room.

Now it’s almost expected, especially among mid- to high-end hotels, that 
you’ll have wireless Internet access from your room and possibly the lobby, 
too. Note that wireless access outside the United States is generally not free 
and can cost upwards of $25 per day. For example, these large hotel chains 
offer some services (if you’re in the U.S.):
	
✦	 Hyatt. Most of the chain’s more than 200 hotels have Wi-Fi access; 
currently there are 414 properties that offer wireless. The service is 
available in the lobby, other public areas, and some guest rooms. Hyatt 
charges a daily rate that varies by location.
	
✦	 Marriott. More than 1,200 of Marriott’s hotels have wireless Internet 
access. Hotels include Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels & 
Resorts, Courtyard, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, Fairfield Inn, and 
SpringHill Suites. Access is available in hotel lobbies, meeting rooms, 
and public spaces.
	
✦	 Hilton. As one might expect, almost every Hilton property (including 
Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn) offer wireless access. Generally 
speaking, the Hilton properties charge a daily fee for Internet access; 
however, its partners (notably the two mentioned here) offer compli­
mentary wireless access.
	
✦	 Sheraton. Owner Starwood Hotels & Resorts has Wi-Fi connectivity in 
more than 150 Sheraton, Westin, and W hotels in the United States. It 
also provides access to about 40 properties in 10 countries and regions 
across Asia Pacific.
	
✦	 Omni. All U.S.-based Omni hotels offer high-speed wireless access. In 
some hotels, this is limited to certain rooms or public areas.
	
✦	 Best Western. Yep, you read that right. Even the lower end of the hotel 
industry is embracing Wi-Fi. And how: Best Western plans to install wire­
less access in 2,300 properties throughout North America.
In the (city) clouds
A new movement is equipping many city centers with Wi-Fi access. The Wi-Fi 
service areas, called city clouds or hot zones, are a way for cities to differ­
entiate themselves from other business and tourism centers. In many cases, 
the hot zones are dual use, with police and fire workers using it along with 
residents and visitors.
It is good PR: If you can check your e-mail on your Wi-Fi–enabled laptop or 
PDA while visiting a city’s downtown, aren’t you more likely to remember your 
visit and have good feelings about the hospitality? Covering several or more 
blocks beats isolated hotspots at coffee houses and other limited locations.

Here’s a small selection of cities and states offering wireless access:
	
✦	 New York City. In the Big Apple, thinking big is part of living. Officials 
are planning a Wi-Fi network for public safety employees. The price tag: a 
staggering $500 million to $1 billion. For the general public, you can find 
wireless access virtually anywhere just due to the sheer size of the city.
	
✦	 Washington, D.C. You can get free Wi-Fi access from the front of the 
Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and the Capitol visitors’ site. 
The nonprofit group deploying the network has a hot zone stretch from 
Capitol Hill to the Washington Monument.
	
✦	 San Francisco. The real San Francisco treat is the city’s plan to install 
360 solar-powered bus stops with Wi-Fi across the city over the next 
couple of years.
	
✦	 Seattle. If you’re sleepless in this city, sometime in the future you might 
be able to access what city officials hope will be border-to-border wire­
less Internet access. Of course, this city has what seems like a limitless 
number of coffee shops ready to provide you with Wi-Fi coverage in the 
meantime.
Not surprisingly, the United States is the nation 
with the most hotspots. In fact, it has more 
hotspots than the next nine nations on the 
worldwide top ten list combined. The source of 
this list, JiWire (www.jiwire.com), counts over 
273,000 hotspots worldwide.
	✓	 United States: 66,312
	✓	 China: 28,678
	✓	 United Kingdom: 27,458
	✓	 France: 25,573
	✓	 Russian Federation: 14,457
	✓	 Germany: 14,434
	✓	 South Korea: 12,813
	✓	 Japan: 11,607
	✓	 Sweden: 6,634
	✓	 Taiwan: 5,386
When it comes to U.S. cities with the most hot­
spots, New York City tops the list. Interestingly, 
half of these cities are in either California or 
Texas, as the map shows.
	✓	 New York City: 885
	✓	 San Francisco: 871
	✓	 Chicago: 788
	✓	 Seattle: 624
	✓	 Houston: 600
	✓	 Los Angeles: 499
	✓	 Atlanta: 451
	✓	 San Diego: 422
	✓	 San Antonio, TX: 416
	✓	 Austin, TX: 411

✦	 Spokane, Washington. Its dual-use Wi-Fi network covers a 100-block 
area that is a mile long and a third of a mile wide.
	
✦	 Rio Rancho, New Mexico. This is the first city to offer city-wide, free 
wireless access. It’s also home to Intel’s primary manufacturing center.
	
✦	 Austin, Texas. A volunteer effort is under way here to keep Wi-Fi free.
	
✦	 St. Cloud, Florida. The city is offering free Internet access, with its hot 
zone covering an area about 20 city blocks.
	
✦	 Paris. For those of you traveling in Europe, there is an extensive public 
wireless access system in Paris. Many parks and other public spaces 
offer free wireless internet access. It’s not uncommon to see people in 
parks with their laptops, working.
McWireless and others
What’s left after the other locations? In many places, such as Seattle, Wi-Fi–
equipped coffee shops are all the rage. (If you live in Seattle, check out the 
Caffeinated and Unstrung Web site at www.seattle.wifimug.org.) 
Wireless Internet access is also making inroads to fast-food restaurants and 
sports venues.
Retailers
Schlotzsky’s Delis, Apple retail stores, Panera Bread, and Krystal Restaurants 
are among the national chains that have Wi-Fi in at least some of their 
locations. Not only can you buy goods and services from these places, you 
can go online:
	
✦	 Starbucks: While this national coffee shop famously keeps its customers 
wired, it also offers Wi-Fi access. The company says that Wi-Fi users stay 
in its stores longer, with the average wireless session lasting about 45 
minutes. Now it’s safe to drink and (hard) drive.
	
✦	 McDonald’s: I’m not sure how many people take their laptops or PDAs 
to a McDonald’s to get some work done, but 15,000 of the restaurants 
worldwide now offer wireless access. I’ll have a salad, a large fry — and 
my e-mail, please.
	
✦	 FedEx Office: It took T-Mobile six months to wire (unwire?) this copy 
center’s 1,000 U.S. locations. They welcome your use of the stores as 
surrogate offices.
	
✦	 UPS Stores and Mailboxes Etc: After starting with AT&T to offer high-
speed access to customers, they were unceremoniously dropped, and 
I’m not quite sure what’s on the menu anymore.

Stadiums and arenas
During baseball game broadcasts, I’m surprised how many people I see in 
the stands chatting on their cell phones. Maybe providing wireless Internet 
access is the next logical step? The San Francisco Giants is offering free Wi-Fi 
access to its baseball fans. Now you can attend a day game while checking 
your e-mail, making it appear you’re working. You also can check on scores 
and stats — anything you can do at home is available. The Charlotte Bobcats 
basketball team offers a similar service. Other stadiums and arenas have 
toyed with the idea, too.
On the road
You can be between points A and B and still get online:
	
✦	 Airplanes: German airline Lufthansa has on-board Wi-Fi access. With 
regards to the U.S. market, Delta and Virgin America are the most 
advanced so far. This service is provided by Gogo Inflight, which is 
available at http://gogoinflight.com/.
	
✦	 Truck stops: Truck drivers need Wi-Fi access, too. There’s family to 
e-mail and paperwork to file. Offering access differentiates one truck 
stop from the other, providing a competitive advantage.
	
✦	 Highway rest areas: Texas, Iowa, and Maryland think they know how to 
encourage tired drivers to stop more often at highway rest stops: Offer 
them wireless Internet access from the comfort of their vehicles. It’s 
especially a boon to truckers and RVers. With the security lines in air­
ports being so long, the highways may become an important alternative 
to business travelers.
	
✦	 Campgrounds: The state of Michigan installed Wi-Fi access in a state 
park campground. It plans to do this in other state parks, as well. I’m 
sure this is happening elsewhere, too. My idea of roughing it is watch­
ing TV on anything other than a big screen, so battling insects in a tent 
and foot fungus in the shower is not within my definition of reality. Yet I 
understand many folks like this return to precivilization days. Now they 
can swat the mosquitoes while surfing the Web. Progress!
Clenching Your Security Blanket
	
Most, if not all, of the public hotspots I discuss in this chapter provide unse­
cured wireless Internet access. That means you’re out there naked, baby. 
The guy with the tall latte at the next table can easily access your laptop 
or PDA files if you’re not careful. Use a firewall and buckle down your file 
access, as I discuss in Book IV, Chapter 1. If you’re connecting to a corpo­
rate network, do so through a virtual private networking (VPN) connection, 
which I discuss in Book V, Chapter 6.

Don’t send out personal information like credit card numbers unless you’re 
connecting to a Web site that encrypts the data before sending it. You can 
tell if it’s a secured site by the Web address, which usually begins with https, 
and a closed padlock icon appears in your browser.
T-Mobile, which operates hotspots in Starbucks locations, is very clear that 
you’re on your own when it comes to security. “The T-Mobile HotSpot net­
work is based on evolving wireless technology and is not inherently secure,” 
it says in a security statement posted on Starbucks’ Web site. “We there­
fore cannot guarantee the privacy of your data and communications while 
using the HotSpot service.” The statement cautions that an unexplained 
loss or deterioration of your connection could mean that a nearby hacker 
has gained free access to the Internet using your HotSpot username and 
password. If you suspect that’s the case, logging out knocks the freeloading 
hacker off the Internet. T-Mobile suggests you then call its customer service 
department.
While I cover many of these security issues elsewhere, they’re worth men­
tioning here as you consider connecting to a public hotspot. There’s no 
need to be paranoid (believe me, I know), but vigilance is diligence. T-Mobile 
makes these security recommendations:
	
✦	 Don’t leave your computer or device unattended. (Duh! The worst secu­
rity is a stolen laptop.)
	
✦	 Don’t loan your computer or device to someone unfamiliar to you. (You 
might be a Dummy, but you’re not an idiot.)
	
✦	 Watch for over-the-shoulder viewing of your login, credit card number, 
or other personal information.
	
✦	 Log out of Web sites by clicking Log Out instead of just closing your 
browser or typing in a new Internet address.
	
✦	 Create passwords using a combination of letters and numbers, and they 
should be changed frequently. (This is always good advice.)
	
✦	 Keep passwords and account numbers secure; don’t store them on your 
computer or device or share them with anyone.	
	
✦	 Avoid using Web-based e-mail or instant messaging that uses clear, 
unencrypted text to send confidential information.
	
✦	 Remove or disable your wireless card if you’re working offline and you 
are not planning to connect to a hotspot.
Any way you sip it, it’s worth letting this advice brew and considering it the 
next time you connect to the Internet through a public Wi-Fi hotspot.

W
ireless networking security is an evolving area. Though wireless 
networking has some built-in security features, you can’t be as con­
fident with it as you can with wired networking. What if you want to wire­
lessly move information from your PC to a computer located elsewhere? 
You’re in an airport, using public Wi-Fi access, and you want to connect to 
an office computer — and don’t want anyone to see the information you’re 
sending. How can you pull this off? I’m glad you asked.
I show you how to create and use what’s called a virtual private network 
(VPN) to move your data safely over a public network such as the Internet. 
When you create a VPN connection, you’re creating a virtual tunnel. Everything 
moving through this tunnel is encrypted, or scrambled, so it’s safe from prying 
eyes. Once the data reaches the computer on the other end, the information is 
decrypted so users can see what you sent.
Setting Up a VPN Connection
Follow along with these steps and you find it’s pretty easy to set up a VPN 
connection (one of which is shown in Figure 6-1). If you have set up other 
network connections using Windows Vista’s Network and Sharing Center, it 
is even easier for you.
Here’s how you set up the VPN connection:
	
1.	 Click the Start menu and select Control Panel.
	
	 The Control Panel opens.
	
2.	 Click Network and Internet.
	
	 The Network and Internet dialog box appears.

	 The Network and Sharing Center appears.
	
4.	 Under Tasks, click Set up a connection or network and then Connect 
to a workplace.
	
	 Figure 6-2 shows this being done. The Network Connection dialog box 
appears. Despite the menu selection’s name, the VPN connection can be 
made anywhere, not just to a company network.
	
5.	 Select whether to create a new connection or use an existing connec­
tion, as shown in Figure 6-3.
	
	 This procedure creates a new connection.

Connecting to a Remote Computer Using VPN
If you’ve set up a VPN connection on your computer, you can connect to 
a remote computer that accepts incoming VPN connections. Ask your net­
work administrator whether a remote computer accepts VPN connections. 
(In the next section I show you how to create an incoming connection for a 
Windows Vista machine.)
Here’s how you connect to a remote computer using VPN:
	
1.	 From the Network Connections dialog box, double-click the VPN 
connection.
	
	 A connection dialog box appears.
	
2.	 Enter the remote computer’s username and password, as shown in 
Figure 6-7.
	
	 You can get this information from your network administrator.
	
	 If you select Save This User Name and Password for the Following Users, 
everyone with access to your PC can connect to the remote computer. 
The username and password are saved on your computer, so users 
won’t need to know that information to connect.
	
Figure 6-7: 
Entering a 
username 
and 
password.
	
	
3.	 Click Connect.
	
	 You see the Connecting dialog box shown in Figure 6-8.
	
	 If the connection is a success, your Virtual Private Network icon in the 
Network Connections dialog box says Connected.

You can disconnect a VPN connection by right-clicking the VPN connection 
icon and selecting Disconnect. You can use the icon to reconnect whenever 
you want by clicking it.
Creating an Incoming VPN Connection
Windows Vista lets you create an incoming connection so that other users — 
maybe even yourself while on the road — can connect to your computer 
using a VPN connection.
The Home edition of Windows Vista can only accept one incoming VPN 
connection at a time. The Professional version allows multiple incoming 
connections.
These steps create an incoming connection:
	
1.	 In the Network Connections dialog box, click File➪New Incoming 
Connection.
	
	 The following dialog box appears, once you get past the User Account 
Control, as shown in Figure 6-9.
	
2.	 Select the user(s) with an account on the machine and click Next.
	
	 The network will accept incoming calls from these users. Once you click 
Next, the Allow connections to this computer dialog box appears.
	
3.	 Select Through the Internet, as shown in Figure 6-10.

Chapter 7: Taking Home with You
In This Chapter
✓	Watching TV around the world
✓	Taking off with Slingbox
✓	Making the most of the experience
I
 know this sounds bad, but I love watching American television. Except 
for the abundance of commercials, it’s like hunting through a junk shop. 
You’ve got loads of channels and only a handful of shows worth watching. 
One of the things I missed about home when I moved to Europe was all the 
shows that I would miss.
Thinking back a few years to my first stint living abroad in the late 1990s, 
technology was nowhere even remotely close to where it is today. Back in 
the day, phone calls back to America were outrageously priced, dial-up was 
the norm here, and streaming technology? Forget it.
Jumping ahead to 2009, times certainly have changed. For starters, my ISP 
has download speeds that I hadn’t dreamt possible just a few short years 
ago. Thanks to VOIP technology, I am able to have a local number from the 
United States so family and friends can call me for the price of a local call. 
Finally, thanks to one great leap for mankind, I can watch my beloved sit­
coms (and here’s a special shout-out to DVR technology for surmounting 
the seven-hour time zone difference).
This chapter explores my latest toy, the Slingbox, from Sling Media, which 
allows me to watch television remotely with very little setup. Thanks to 
Slingbox, VOIP, and Web cams, I can feel like home even when I am thou­
sands of miles away.
Watching TV around the World
The Slingbox, in my humble opinion, has to be one of the coolest, more 
practical gadgets for road warriors of the past 20 years. It’s especially useful 
for those who travel out of the country frequently.
Once you take care of the hardest part (finding someone who will share 
their television with you), installation is easy, and you’re on your way within 
minutes. Of course, there is some mild inconvenience for the host, as I dis­
cuss later in this chapter.

Taking Off with the Slingbox
326
Using proprietary software, you can log on to your account, where you regis­
ter your Slingbox, and then watch television live through your computer or 
wireless device. When you are connected to the Slingbox, you literally take 
over the television on the other end of the internet connection. This means 
that you control the sound, and more importantly, the channel!
The benefits are in spades, however, as you can enjoy the feeling of sitting 
on your favorite sofa back home watching your favorite shows. The only 
thing missing is a batch of mom’s homemade chocolate chip cookies. There 
are no geographical limitations to using the Slingbox; you can live in the U.S., 
Germany, or Japan and log in to watch a Slingbox that is hosted in France, 
Brazil, or Canada. It’s proven to be quite useful when out shopping with the 
kids; I can log on to the application on my smartphone and watch cartoons 
in the United States as we’re shopping in Paris.
Taking Off with the Slingbox
There are a few items that you’ll need to buy before you are up and running. 
Even though the installation process is pretty straightforward, you’ll have 
to have some familiarity with wireless technology and a general level of 
patience for computers.
To get an idea of what you’re going to need to get started, visit the Web site 
www.slingmedia.com. From a technical standpoint, you’re going to want to 
make sure that you have a wireless network already configured in your home, 
or wherever you intend on installing the Slingbox itself. This means that the 
Slingbox is expecting to find a wireless router to which it can plug in.
After the network requirements are met, you can pick what kind of Slingbox 
you want to buy. The SOLO model allows you to broadcast your incoming 
satellite television transmission both over the local television and though 
authorized users over the Internet. The PRO-HD model lets you go one step 
farther — you can connect multiple devices, so that you can include DVRs, 
DVD players, satellite television, and so on in high-definition quality.
The Slingbox provides ample online documentation, but the following is a 
quick and dirty way to get started. Again, while it’s not difficult to set up, 
it’s like preparing a fancy recipe. The individual ingredients may be easy to 
prepare, but mixing them together at the right time may prove to be a more 
difficult maneuver to make. These instructions apply to the host — in other 
words, the person kind enough to share their television with you.
	
1.	 Make sure that you have all the necessary equipment.
	
	 Locate the back of your satellite receiver, where input and output cables 
are plugged in.

Book V
Chapter 7
Taking Home 
with You
Taking Off with the Slingbox
327
	
2.	 Plug the cables from the Slingbox to the back of your satellite 
receiver.
	
	 This allows the incoming satellite signal to be processed by the receiver 
(decoder) and then be sent as output to your Slingbox.
	
3.	 Plug the Ethernet cable from the back of your Slingbox to an open 
port of your router.
You may want to plug in the Slingbox to an electrical socket for good mea­
sure. Experience has taught me that a little bit of electricity also helps move 
things along. Once plugged in as described above, you should notice lights 
on in front of the Slingbox, which means that the Slingbox is receiving data 
and able to broadcast it.
If you have set up your home network in a way that your television/satellite 
television connection is not in the same room as your wireless router, do not 
fret. Slingmedia offers a dapper little device called a SlingLink that you can 
connect between your wireless router and your Slingbox to create a wireless 
connection between the devices when they are not in the same room.
Now that your host is ready to broadcast, it’s now up to you to get things 
ready on your end. This is a simple process, but it does require a little bit of 
configuration on your end, so look sharp!
	
1.	 Sign up for a free Sling account.
	
	 You can do this at https://betasecure.sling.com/account/login.
	
2.	 Download the Slingbox software.
	
	 You can do this at http://downloads.slingmedia.com/. You’ll want 
to first download SlingPlayer software for either Windows or Macintosh.
	
3.	 Install the software.
	
	 This is a straightforward installation; double-click the installer that you 
downloaded in Step 2 and follow the instructions.
You’re almost ready to go at this point! Click the icon that is installed on 
your desktop to launch the SlingPlayer software. The SlingPlayer appears as 
shown in Figure 7-1.
The first step is to click Log In, which is in the upper-right corner of the 
window. If you do not log on, you cannot configure the Slingbox now, nor 
will you be able to watch the SlingPlayer in the future. The Log In dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 7-2.

Once you are logged on to your Sling account, you will need to configure the 
Slingbox. This is something that you will likely only need to do once (unless 
you have to reinstall the software one day), and it will require some help 
from your Slingbox host.
	
1.	 Choose Connect➪Slingbox Directory.
	
2.	 Click Add.
	
	 The New Slingbox Entry Properties window appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-3.

3.	 In the Connection section, add the Slingbox ID.
	
	 You guessed it; you need to get this number from the back of the 
Slingbox. Pick up the phone and call the person hosting your Slingbox 
for you, or go to the room with the Slingbox in it and jot that ridiculously 
long ID number down.
	
4.	 You can add an administrator password if desired.
	
	 This is helpful if you want to watch the Slingbox and boot someone else 
off who is already watching it.
	
5.	 Click OK.
	
	 The new Slingbox appears in the directory, as shown in Figure 7-4.

connection and make sure it is properly configured, as shown in Figure 7-5.
	
Figure 7-5:

way around the world, it optimizes for the best possible.

You’re finally all set to watch your streaming television from anywhere 
around the world. What is strangest for me is watching shows in Europe and 
seeing the advertisements for stores or restaurants back home that do not 
exist here. More than once, I’ve said to myself, “grab your coat, kids, we’re 
heading out! Wait a minute, doh!”
I should also point out that although the SlingPlayer software is free, you can 
purchase a version for mobile. If you have a wireless device that supports 
Internet access (a given, these days), you can buy a version of almost any 
mobile operating system, as well as iPhone. For more information on this 
version, check out www.slingmedia.com/go/spm.
As a frequent user of the mobile version, I still marvel at the fact that I can 
watch NBC from the comfort of the subway with amazing clarity. Given the 
advances in smartphone technology, I can watch on a rather generous-sized 
screen, without having to sacrifice sound quality.
The Slingbox itself can be somewhat pricey, admittedly. However, if you do 
enjoy watching television and are frequently on the road or not in the country, 
its money well spent.
	
To truly make the most of the experience, I recommend watching on a com­
puter with a proper screen size. I also hooked up some high-end speakers 
to my laptop so that I could enjoy the full cinema-like sound of what I was 
watching.
Depending on your computer’s capabilities, it’s also possible to hook up 
your PC/netbook/laptop to your television and to watch the SlingPlayer 
through your own television instead of a small PC screen.
As technology teaches us, where there’s a will, there’s a way. With Slingbox, 
I now have yet another piece of home closer to me, which really does prove 
that the world is indeed getting smaller.

t’s bad enough that buying a cellular phone and wireless network­
ing equipment is so complicated. Now, with new options for cordless 
phones, even that once straightforward purchase is forcing you to reach for 
the aspirin. Consider me the aspirin — and you don’t even have to call me in 
the morning. In this chapter I discuss the different kinds of cordless phones, 
the advantages of one over the other, and a technology term or two.
You have choices when it comes to buying a cell phone and choices when 
installing wireless networking. Now, consider your standard telephone: 
when you decide to cut its cord and go wireless, you also have choices. 
Thankfully, cordless phones aren’t nearly as complex as smartphones or 
Wi-Fi networks, but there are different types of cordless phones that use 
various technologies.
Cutting the Cords
If you’re over 35, you probably remember the days when one of the only 
telephones in the house was a corded model mounted on the wall, possibly 
with a rotary dial. The only way to increase your distance from the phone 
was to purchase a longer cord. Although it might be possible, wrestling with 
a 300-foot cord so you can chat as you move from the kitchen to the garden 
to the garage is a bit impractical.

336
Cutting the Cords
Around 1990, when the FCC assigned bandwidth in the 900 MHz frequency 
range, cordless phones first became a real alternative to corded telephones. 
While there were cordless phones before that (usually with big, metal, tele­
scoping antennae), the newer frequencies were a big jump in clarity and 
range from the old 43–49 MHz band.
As manufacturers began making digital models, cordless phones grew even 
more practical; they were more secure (allowing for less eavesdropping) 
than analog versions. Also, more channels are available for use by the cord­
less phone to communicate between the base station and handset. A wider 
range of channels means interference is more easily thwarted. The break­
down is as follows:
	
✦	 10 to 25 channels for inexpensive 900 MHz phones.
	
✦	 20 to 60 channels for most 900 MHz phones.
	
✦	 50 to 100 channels for high-end 900 MHz phones and for 2.4 and 5.8 GHz 
phones.
Table 1-1 breaks down the megahertz and gigahertz by range.

Analog phones
Analog cordless phones act like a plain, old AM/FM radio. They convert 
sounds waves into radio waves, transmitting them between the cordless 
phone and its base station. Anyone with a converter and a radio scanner 
can eavesdrop. (Selling police and fire radio scanners that pick up 900 MHz 
transmissions is illegal; 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz phones are out of range of most 
radio scanners.)
When you and an analog handset get too far from the base station, you hear 
static over the conversation until you can no longer communicate with the 
base station. These phones also are prone to static from interference. Figure 1-1 
shows analog versus digital communications methods.

Many new cordless phones — and I recom­
mend making sure this is true of the one you 
purchase next — use a technology called 
DSS, or digital spread spectrum. The digital 
part of DSS means your conversation is con­
verted from analog sound waves to digital 1s 
and 0s. (You can buy a digital phone that does 
not use DSS, however.) The spread spectrum 
part is less clear, though it has something to 
do with the radio spectrum. This technical term 
is vague until you discover what it is, how it 
works, and why you want it.
First, why you want it: DSS-equipped phones 
are much more secure than analog and plain 
digital phones. In fact, it’s nearly impossible to 
listen to a conversation taking place on a DSS 
phone because the listener only hears quick 
bursts of data that transmit very quickly across 
multiple frequencies. In other words, one data 
burst will be at frequency A, then next at B, 
and so on — and only the phone knows what 
frequency the next data burst will occur on. 
Everything happens so fast that it’s impossible 
to follow conversations sent with DSS unless 
the eavesdropper has very expensive and 
sophisticated snooping equipment. You can 
feel pretty confident that the personal informa­
tion you reveal during a telephone call (credit 
card numbers, social security numbers, and so 
on) on this phone is safe.
Second, phones using DSS suffer from less 
interference. Depending on different factors, 
they may also have a greater range than simi­
lar phones that don’t use DSS technology. In 
addition to being more secure, DSS is a more 
efficient use of the radio spectrum.
A DSS phone may also be referred to by fre­
quency hopping spread spectrum or FHSS.
What is this DSS?

338
Choosing Your Frequency
Digital phones
Digital phones convert sound waves into digital signals, which consist of 
a lot of 1s and 0s. If you tune into a conversation transmitted digitally, you 
can’t hear it without using equipment that converts the output into some­
thing humans can understand. When you go out of range with a digital 
phone, the conversation terminates suddenly with dead air. Digital phones 
offer no gray area between a good signal and a lousy signal. Their existence 
shows up on the time lines in Figure 1-2.

Some digital phones use something called digital spread spectrum (DSS). See 
the “What is this DSS?” sidebar in this chapter for further information. Not 
all digital phones have DSS, but all DSS phones are digital.
Choosing Your Frequency
Can you imagine if when purchasing a cell phone and a calling plan, you had 
to tell the company what technology you want to use? Of course, you have 
some choices when it comes to handsets and choosing a particular carrier 
for its network. You don’t have to tell the cell phone provider at what fre­
quency you want the phone to operate.
When you purchase a cell phone and calling plan, you make some technical 
decisions. These mainly concern the handset and its features, plus a carrier 
for the network. Cordless phone shoppers have their own set of technologi­
cal decisions to make, above and beyond the features offered by the model.
When shopping for cordless phones, you choose the frequency and some­
times whether the radio signals are analog or digital. Shopping for the 
phones in a store does little to narrow your decision making, other than 
deciding on the look and feel of the phone. Table 1-2 can help you start your 
comparison shopping before you set foot in a store.

You have an array of choices when purchasing a cordless phone. The impor­
tant option is the frequency band on which the phones operates. Cordless 
phones are available in 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz models. Generally, as 
the frequency goes higher, so does the maximum distance you can take the 
handset from the base station, and the clarity gets better. Watch out, how­
ever, for interference from other sources of radio waves, physical structures 
like walls, and the weather.
Here are what the three frequency bands offer.
900 MHz
You can buy one of these phones pretty cheaply, but many manufacturers 
are phasing them out, favoring instead the 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz models. If 
you’re on a budget, you can buy one of these analog models for less than 
you paid for this book — but I wouldn’t recommend it (the phone, not the 
book).
Why? The prices of 2.4 GHz phones are very reasonable and cover a larger 
area with less likelihood of interference. Also, higher frequency phones offer 
more conversation security: It’s fairly simple to listen in to a 900 MHz analog 
signal with the right equipment.
2.4 GHz
Quality and price meet here. This is the sweet spot for cordless phones; 
most of them made today operate in this frequency range. They offer more 
clarity and range than you get with a 900 MHz phone.
Given the number of 2.4 GHz models, you can find them in a wide variety 
of configurations, choosing the features you want and not paying for ones 
you don’t need. You can buy 2.4 GHz phones in analog and digital models. 
These phones are also available in multiple-handset models, which let you 

340
Featuring Cordless Phones
add more handsets as you need them. Some models let you have as many 
as eight — seemingly enough for every room of your house. While the addi­
tional phones need a nearby AC outlet, they don’t each need a phone jack.
You can find 2.4GHz phones in a huge variety of configurations with any 
number of features. Some contain digital answering machines. Some allow 
you to add up to eight handsets to the same base. Extra handsets usually 
come with a charging dock for which you need an AC connection, but you 
only need a phone jack for the base station itself.
Unfortunately, phones that operate in the 2.4 GHz range can interfere with 
some Wi-Fi wireless networks (802.11b and 802.11g, but not 802.11a or 
802.11n).
5.8 GHz
These phones have an exceptionally notable advantage over the other two 
kinds of phones: The 5.8 GHz band is less populated, but that’s changing 
quickly. Along with an increase in clarity and distance, cordless phones 
using this frequency are the perfect fit for a home that has a Wi-Fi network 
and other interference on the 2.4 GHz band.
The 5.8 GHz phones tend to be feature-packed affairs that get expensive 
quickly, although with the frequency growing in popularity it’s only a matter 
of time before cheaper 5.8 GHz phones emerge.
Featuring Cordless Phones
If the confusion over frequencies isn’t bad enough, you have to decide 
between a myriad of features when shopping for a cordless phone. From 
caller ID displays to multiple-handset models, you have much to discover 
before plopping down your greenbacks.
You find some of the features on cordless phones:
	
✦	 Caller ID. If you subscribe to caller ID service through your local phone 
company, this feature is a must. If the phone’s not enabled for caller ID, 
subscribing doesn’t make any difference. When you get an incoming call, 
the caller’s phone number and possibly the name (if you pay for this ser­
vice) appears on the handset’s display.
	
✦	 Call waiting ID. Call waiting ID is a cool feature. While you’re on the 
phone with someone else, you can see who is trying to reach you by 
glancing at the display on your phone. If you want to take the new call, 
you flash over to the other line. When you’re done, if the first caller is 
still waiting, you can flash back to him or her.

Avoiding Interference
	
✦	 Digital answering machine. I thought everyone who needs to record 
calls signed up for voicemail through their phone company. I guess not. 
Long gone are the days of cassette tapes; the answering machines built 
into these phones are digital, which have far less recording capacity. 
One benefit is that long-winded callers have fewer seconds to leave their 
messages, sparing you some rambling. Sometimes you can even set the 
length of messages your answering machine will take before cutting off 
the caller.
	
✦	 Multiple handsets. You can do several things with these phones:
 
• Add up to eight handsets (depending on the model) for use through­
out your home.
 
• Answer a call using any one of the phones.
 
• Transfer a call to and from a handset.
 
• Page a handset, making the setup similar to an intercom system.
 
• Plug each handset’s cradle into a power outlet; they don’t require 
separate phone jacks.
	
✦	 Two-line phones. These models can handle multiple phone lines. If you 
have a second line in your home, consider this feature. My household 
uses a two-line phone — one for business and faxing and the other for 
personal calls.
	
✦	 Speakerphone. This feature is always handy, especially when stuck on 
hold with a credit card company or other sadistic entity. You can push 
the appropriate button and leave the handset in its cradle, using the 
speakerphone located in the base station. Better still are handsets with 
speakerphone built-in; you can carry them around and have speaker­
phone conversations while you do other stuff.
Avoiding Interference
As I mentioned earlier, if you have a Wi-Fi network in your house, I don’t 
recommend the purchase of a 2.4 GHz cordless phone. If your household is 
constantly using a baby monitor, that could be a problem, too. Even micro­
wave ovens, which operate on the same frequency, can create problems. 
Never situate the base of your phone near a microwave, because if some­
body decides to heat up last night’s dinner while you’re on the phone, you’ll 
experience loud and annoying interference.
If your analog phone has interference, you hear it as static and hisses. A 
digital phone will probably fade in and out or have a shorter range, or even 
cough up sounds like buzzing or beeping (but not technically static).

342
Avoiding Interference
The best way to eliminate or reduce these kinds of interference problems 
is to move the phone’s base station around the house, seeing if a different 
location makes any difference. If you already have a Wi-Fi network and pur­
chased a 2.4 GHz phone without reading my wise admonitions beforehand, 
you still have hope. Just turn off the network when you’re using the phone 
and vice versa (as annoying as that can be). However, you may find the two 
coexist peacefully.

Chapter 2: Picking Peripherals
In This Chapter
✓	Cleaning off your desk
✓	Choosing wireless peripherals
You may be focusing on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks and forgetting 
some of the more “peripheral” uses of wireless technology. In this chap­
ter, namely, I’m literally referring to peripherals — for your computers.
A peripheral is really anything that’s not an internal, integral part of your 
desktop or laptop computer. Examples include keyboards, mice, trackballs, 
external hard drives, speakers, and game controllers. (It also includes print­
ers, but they’re covered in Book III, Chapter 4.) While these all once were 
tethered to your PC via wires, more and more of them are sold in cordless 
versions. In this chapter I highlight a few of the cordless peripherals you 
can buy.
Unplugging Your Desktop
Logitech, one of the largest manufacturers of cordless mice and keyboards, 
has shipped literally tens of millions of cordless peripherals worldwide, 
including keyboards, mice, and trackballs.
You may see peripherals called cordless or wireless. I guess I like wire­
less because this book isn’t called Cordless All-in-One Desk Reference For 
Dummies. It’s a good thing, too, as I picture a cordless phone disguised as a 
Dummies book. I’d love the look — I’ll gladly take a black-and-yellow phone 
any day — but holding a book to my head for an hour could be tiring.
Of course, some cordless peripherals still come with cords. The base 
stations usually plug into a USB port (found on the back or front of your 
computer) on your computer and then sit somewhere on your desk — but 
probably out of the way and out of sight. Others simply require USB dongles 
to communicate with your computer — no wires at all. 

344
Using a Cordless Mouse
One of the annoying things about corded, or wired, peripherals is when 
you attempt to move a mouse but the cord is hung up on something else on 
your desk. As you pull the mouse toward you to move the cursor down, the 
mouse stops, the cursor stops, but your eyes (and sometimes your hand) 
keep going. This little disruption can totally throw off your suspension of 
disbelief if it happens when you’re in the middle of a game.
Switch to a cordless mouse, and you’ll never experience that particular 
problem again. Of course, cordless mice have their own issues, but I’ll get to 
them a bit later.
Using a Cordless Mouse
Microsoft and Logitech are two of the largest makers of cordless mice. 
Various other companies manufacture similar cordless peripherals, includ­
ing game controllers, which are described later in this chapter.
Microsoft mouse
Microsoft has a massive line of cordless mice, including things like the 
Wireless Laser Mouse 7000, the Wireless Laser Mouse 8000, and the 
SideWinder X8 gaming mouse. It also has cordless notebook mice, which are 
more compact versions of standard mice, such as the Arc Mouse and the 
Mobile Memory Mouse 8000. Many of these operate in the 2.4 GHz range and 
allow for up to 30 feet of wireless range.
Bluetooth peripherals work similarly to the cordless mice and keyboards I 
mention in this chapter A Bluetooth base station can simultaneously inter­
act with several devices, including appropriately equipped cell phones and 
handheld computers. I discuss mice and keyboards that use Bluetooth wire­
less technology in Book VI, Chapter 5.
Logitech introduced the first radio-frequency 
(RF) cordless mouse in 1991 and the first cord­
less keyboard-and-mouse combination in 1998. 
Logitech cites a study showing that eight out 
of ten U.S. consumers know about cordless 
peripherals.
It’s a sizeable market, with Logitech estimat­
ing that retail sales of cordless mice and key­
boards total $230 million a year. That’s a growth 
rate of nearly 50 percent. It seems I’m not the 
only one cutting the cords and opting for a 
wireless desk.
Seems logical

Book VI
Chapter 2
Picking Peripherals
345
Using a Cordless Mouse
SideWinder X8 Mouse
A dedicated gaming mouse, the SideWinder X8 Mouse is equipped with a 
2.4GHz connection, a tilt scroll wheel, 12 buttons (7 of which are program­
mable), and something called Play and Charge. That’s a charging cable 
that allows you to continue playing even if the built-in battery dies during a 
gaming session. 
The grooviest thing about this mouse is that the thumb buttons, tradition­
ally placed horizontally along the left side of the mouse, are, in this mouse’s 
case, vertically placed for easier access. With programmable mice, gamers 
can program stuff they’d normally have to do with the keyboard to mouse 
buttons. This includes in-game actions like jumping, changing movement 
speeds (walk/run), ducking, and so on. 
Wireless Laser Mouse 8000
This killer mouse goes beyond optical tracking. Like most high-end, modern 
mice, it doesn’t use a ball or a visible LED for movement; it uses a laser. 
This makes for much more precise tracking over just about any kind of sur­
face you can imagine. The Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 also includes 2.5 GHz 
Bluetooth technology, a rechargeable battery, and more.
Logitech mouse
Logitech also has a wide range of wireless mice. You can order them online 
at www.logitech.com. 
This itty-bitty, portable mouse is the exact mouse I use with my notebook 
computer. It’s small, yet features big technology. It’s a laser mouse, it comes 
with a USB receiver the size of a nickel (literally), it’s oddly palm-friendly for 
its size, and it runs on two AAA batteries. 
I just leave the little receiver plugged into my notebook’s USB port all the 
time. When the computer goes to sleep, I just wiggle the mouse and it wakes 
right up. The mouse has two main buttons, two buttons nestled to the left 
of the standard left mouse button, and a scroll wheel with tilt sensors. (See 
Figure 2-1.)
It really has just about everything a full-sized mouse might feature, but it’s 
pocket-sized and easy to bring around the house, or even anywhere to which 
I may travel, and to use with my Wi-Fi enabled notebook for computing all 
over the place.

Trackballs
I’m no expert, but I’d say trackballs are a niche market. If you haven’t seen 
one, it’s basically a mouse with the ball on the top rather than the bottom. 
The unit stays in place as you move the ball (and hence, the onscreen 
pointer) with your fingers.
Trackballs are good for precision work (graphical work) and certain games. 
However, if you don’t know if you need one, you probably don’t. Logitech 
has two wireless trackballs. One is the Cordless TrackMan Optical and the 
other is the Cordless TrackMan Wheel. The TrackMan Optical is the fancier 
of the two and costs about $10 on the street. The TrackMan Wheel has a 
street price of about $50. Both models have lots of buttons. The TrackMan 
Wheel has its ball on the left side instead of on top. You use your thumb to 
operate the ball, rather than your fingers.
Finding the Home Row: Keyboards
You also can find keyboards that are wireless. Want to know more? Read on!
Microsoft wireless keyboards
Microsoft sells wireless keyboards and mice as a set. It offers about a dozen 
sets, some of which are Bluetooth enabled. The sets have different features, 
depending on the price tags. They range all over the place, from basic sets 
to elite sets.

347
Using a Cordless Mouse
Some of the keyboard sets come in ergonomic models, which I can’t stand. If 
you don’t know what ergonomic means, you probably have seen one of the 
keyboards, anyway: The keys are split into two groups, positioned at angles 
that more closely mimic the normal angles of your wrists. They cut down on 
injuries to your wrist but also typing precision. Bury me with my Logitech 
Wave keyboard (below).
Logitech wireless keyboards
Logitech also has a range of cordless keyboards and keyboard/mouse sets. 
The standout is called the Cordless Desktop Wave (See Figure 2-2). The 
Wave keyboard comes in a corded version; the Wave desktop has the same 
keyboard in a cordless form and a mouse to go with it. I prefer a different 
mouse, so I use the Wave keyboard without the mouse that came with it. 
Call me a rebel.

Wirelessly
In This Chapter:
✓	Starting out with digital music
✓	Deciding between wireless and wired
✓	Finding out about digital media adapter basics
✓	Using other gadgets
Your network is set up and ready to go. You’re surfing the net wirelessly 
from your laptop. Maybe you’ve got music streaming from your desk­
top PC to your laptop.
One problem: the home theater is in your family room. You have content on 
your PC that you’d love to see on the big screen TV, but getting said content 
from one to the other seems like a major chore.
The real chore is not streaming the video or music to your home theater. 
Once you have your network set up to talk to your entertainment system, 
streaming is easy. What’s hard, then?: asking the right questions.
In the next few chapters, I take a look at specific devices and show you how 
to set them up and connect to your wireless network. Think of these as 
examples; you may choose different gear, but the principles of installation 
and setup are the same.
In this chapter, I cover some basic knowledge, so you can understand 
exactly what I’m trying to do.
Entertaining the Wireless Way
The goal for a wireless entertainment experience falls somewhere between 
listening to audio on your $20 computer speakers and having a full-featured 
home media PC running a special version of Windows XP connected to 
your entertainment system. With the former, you get poor sound but few 
setup hassles. With the latter, you must invest much more money — at least

around $1,000 — to get a computer that directly feeds music, photos, and 
videos into your home entertainment center. (In fact, the home media PC 
becomes part of your home entertainment center.)
Instead, you want to take the content that already lives on your PC and 
deliver it to that home entertainment center. Most of the products I discuss 
are a compromise between those two extremes. You get the advantages of 
a dedicated device that does a few things very well with minimal hassle and 
that costs less than a full-fledged Media Center PC. Figure 1-1 shows a typical 
media player configuration on a wireless network.

Starting out with digital music
You choose your media adapter based on the type of content you want to 
play. If most of your music is bought or ripped from CDs using iTunes, you 
want a player capable of playing back music encoded with Apple’s AAC 
format. If your music is in Windows Media Audio (WMA) format, make sure 
that your player can handle WMA playback.

Book VII
Chapter 1

Yourself Wirelessly

Entertaining the Wireless Way
Note that all digital media players understand MP3, which is perhaps the 
most common format for storing digital music. 
	
There are wrinkles and variations to even the most common formats. For 
example, WMA can rip music from CDs losslessly. Apple’s iTunes also has a 
lossless ripping format available. Most music compression schemes throw 
away some data — usually not data that affects the actual sound. However, 
audio purists prefer formats that keep all the data. These lossless formats 
include Apple Lossless, WMA Pro Lossless, and FLAC (free lossless audio 
codec). Even players capable of playing WMA sometimes can’t play back 
music files encoded in WMA Lossless format, so be aware of your digital 
music players’ limitations.
Another potential sore spot is digital rights management, or DRM. DRM is 
a way of preventing unauthorized copies of digital content. Until recently, 
all music bought from the iTunes store was protected with a DRM scheme 
called FairPlay. Most digital media players that can play back AAC-encoded 
music can’t play back music protected with FairPlay DRM.
CDs are easy: There’s really only one type of 
audio CD, known as Red Book Audio CD, which 
is the actual color of the cover defining the CD 
audio standard. You buy a CD, and you can 
pretty much pop it into any CD player and feel 
confident that it will play.
The world of digital music is less well defined. 
When you rip a CD onto your computer, it may 
be stored an one of a number of different com­
peting formats. Apple’s iTunes, for example, 
uses AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) as its 
normal format. Windows Media Player and 
Microsoft’s Zune software encode music in 
WMA (Windows Media Audio). 
The reason for competing formats is so that the 
companies can protect the music from unau­
thorized copying — this is also called DRM 
(digital rights management). 
The closest thing to a universal standard 
for compressed music files is MP3. MP3 is 
MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 and was developed by 
the Moving Pictures Expert Group, a standards 
organization that has developed a number of 
audio and video standards over the years.
So if you want to buy hardware to play back the 
music you’ve stored on your PC, you’ll need to 
understand what format is being used.
A word on formats

The good news is that Apple now offers most of the music you can buy from 
the iTunes store in unprotected AAC. Microsoft is a little behind the curve 
but is starting to add unprotected music. Note that Amazon.com’s MP3 
download service sells all its songs in MP3 format with no DRM added.
Every picture tells a story
You know that big box of photos you have somewhere that you plan to orga­
nize any day now? Well, that day has arrived. Now that you can view your 
photos on your TV screen, why not take the time to scan in your photos so 
they’re available for use by these gizmos?
Both Windows and Mac have some fine software packages that help you 
organize your photos. You can scan them on a scanner, make some changes 
(like eliminating that dreadful red eye that happens when you use a flash), 
and organize them.
Adobe Photoshop Album (www.adobe.com; about $50) and Google’s free 
Picasa (www.picasa.com) software are both excellent photo management 
applications. Your printer may have shipped with one as well. The popular 
formats for photos include the following:
	
✦	 JPEG: JPEG is the most common compressed format for digital pictures 
and was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group. High levels 
of compression can reduce picture quality.
	
✦	 TIFF: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a picture format originally 
developed for scanners. TIFF supports file compression, but not at the 
cost of image quality. 
	
✦	 BMP: BMP stands for “bitmap” and was a picture standard developed 
for Microsoft Windows.
	
✦	 PNG: PNG, or Portable Network Graphics, uses lossless compression to 
make picture files smaller but maintains a high level of image quality. It’s 
not commonly used in cameras but is used often in Web design.
	
✦	 RAW: This is the pure, unaltered digital sample recorded by the camera 
during exposure. Every camera company uses a different raw format. 
RAW format is used mostly in digital SLRs.
In addition to the music itself, everyone makes 
playlists. You might be hosting a party and 
want to have a long playlist of catchy songs to 
set the mood. You might be working and want 
a background music playlist. There are three 
common playlist formats: M3U, PLS, and WPL. 
If you do make extensive use of playlists, you’ll 
want your DMA to handle the format you use.

The good news is that most digital media adapters capable of showing 
pictures handle most of the common picture formats. The confusion and 
variations in standards that prevail in the digital music world aren’t quite as 
common in the arena of digital photos.
Hollywood on a hard drive
Video and wireless networking are not quite like water and oil, but they’re 
close. If you’re going to move around video files on a wireless network, 
bandwidth on the wireless network becomes important. If you have enough 
bandwidth, your video playback is smooth and uninterrupted. If you don’t, 
the video will become jerky, frames will be dropped, and the whole experi­
ence will be terrible.
Early wireless routers and access points supported a standard called 
802.11b, which maxes out at 11 megabits per second (mbps). At first blush, 
11 mbps sounds good enough, but it really isn’t. The best DVD quality video 
pushes a maximum of over 9 mbps, and high-definition video can exceed 
20 mbps.
When 802.11b was released, another standard known as 802.11a also became 
available. Although 802.11a supported bandwidth up to 54 mbps, it wasn’t 
common in home networking products, since it was mainly targeted for cor­
porate use.
Since 802.11b, two newer wireless networking (Wi-Fi) standards have 
emerged suitable for home wireless networks: 802.11g and 802.11n. 802.11g 
boosts bandwidth up to 54 mbps (double that for some products), while 
802.11n supports throughput as high as 600 mbps, although most current 
products max out at around 256 mbps.
Book II, Chapter 2 talks about 802.11 options in depth.
The throughput differences between the technologies (b, g, and n) are strik­
ing, and you’ll definitely see an improvement with 802.11g networking equip­
ment, and even more with 802.11n. If you’re streaming video in real time you 
almost certainly need 802.11g equipment or better.
What kind of video can you watch on media players? Just about anything 
your media player can read. You may want to watch some home movies 
you’ve converted into digital format, for instance. A number of online movie 
rental and streaming services now exist, including services from Amazon, 
Hulu, iTunes, Xbox 360, and Netflix.
More video services are sure to follow, especially given Hollywood’s concern 
about content transferring illegally over peer-to-peer networks. As Apple’s 
iTunes music store has shown, people will pay for content. They’re willing to 
go the legal route as long as the options are there.

356
Entertaining the Wireless Way
Some of the more popular video formats include the following:
	
✦	 MPEG (MPEG-1, MPEG-2): Commonly used in Web video, DVDs, and 
other common commercial applications.
	
✦	 MPEG4: AVCHD high-definition standard, plus portable media players, 
including the iPod and Sony PSP.
	
✦	 WMV (Windows Media Video): Used by Microsoft’s Windows Media 
Player.
	
✦	 ASF (Advanced Systems Format): Another Microsoft standard for digital 
containers for streaming video.
	
✦	 AVI: Audio/video interleave is an earlier format for Windows video file.
	
✦	 Xvid / DiVX: These are based on MPEG-4, but with proprietary exten­
sions. They support high levels of compression with good quality.
There are more wireless media players that play only music than that play 
both music and video. That’s partly because manufacturers — at least 
until recently with the growing popularity of 802.11g — probably felt they 
couldn’t meet the expectations of non-geeky consumers. After all, video 
takes substantial bandwidth, which wired Ethernet and, in most cases, 
802.11g can deliver.
Ultimately, though, keep it simple. It may sound really cool to first rip a DVD 
onto your PC’s hard drive and then stream that movie wirelessly to your 
home entertainment system. In practice, it’s far easier to just pop the DVD 
into your home theater system’s DVD player — and you have all those nifty 
extras, which is often the real reason to own the disc.
What’s important is to create an environment that works seamlessly and 
without a lot of unnecessary tweaking. If you have video content that is only 
available by streaming, by all means, go for it. But if you have to turn on 
your PC every time you simply want to watch a movie, there may be easier 
solutions.

W
ouldn’t it be great to walk from your kitchen to your bedroom, then 
down to your family room, and be hearing music throughout your 
house? What if you could be listening to Miles Davis in your home office 
while your daughter listens to her favorite music in her bedroom? You can 
have all of this, using your wireless network, your PC, and networked digital 
music players.
This chapter explores the ins and outs of listening to music stored on your 
PC, anywhere in your home. You’ve invested your time and money to buy 
and download music from iTunes, Microsoft’s Zune service, Rhapsody, or 
other music services. Or maybe you’ve spent all that time ripping your mas­
sive CD collection onto your PC. Sure, you can listen to it in your portable 
music player, but why not listen to it on your home theater system, too?
Serving Up Your Digital Music
You’ve been busy ripping your entire CD collection using your favorite 
music player software. You’ve also bought digital music, perhaps from a 
variety of sources. That iPod or Zune player is an inseparable companion. 
But you can’t help thinking that something is missing, as you pop one of 
your music CDs into your CD player in your home entertainment system.
Stop right there. Why are you still using CDs to play music on your large 
format audio speakers? You can have your entire digitally ripped music col­
lection, with your customized playlists, playing on those superb-sounding 
home theater speakers that grace your living room. Banish your CD player 
forever, and replace it with a modern digital music player.

358
The choice of the best digital music player depends on what digital format 
you’ve been using for your music, which I discussed in Chapter 1 of this 
minibook. The other piece of the puzzle is how music is delivered from your 
PC (or another source, such as network attached storage) to your home 
entertainment system. That also depends on the digital music format you 
use and what software.
Using music software
More people use iTunes than any other digital music application. It’s avail­
able on both Macintosh- and Windows-based PCs. iTunes is tightly linked to 
the iTunes Store, where content can be purchased for instant download. But 
you can also use iTunes to rip your CD collection.
iTunes uses two different formats, depending on how you rip the music 
from your CD. One is known as Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), the other is 
Apple Lossless. Apple Lossless offers better sound quality, because its com­
pression doesn’t throw away data. AAC, like MP3, discards what it thinks is 
redundant data. Usually, the result can sound pretty good, but I’d suggest 
using the highest possible bit rate for the best results.
Microsoft’s Windows Media Player and the Zune player both use Windows 
Media Audio (WMA) audio format. Windows Media also offers a lossless 
compression option for the best possible sound quality.
One other option for lossless compression is known as FLAC (free lossless 
audio codec). FLAC is, as the acronym hints, free. It’s widely supported by 
many digital media players, but you need either a plug-in for Windows Media 
Player or some standalone application to rip your collection into FLAC format.
One of the problems with iTunes and other paid 
music services was the issue of content pro­
tection, known as DRM (digital rights manage­
ment.) A song bought from the iTunes store was 
almost always protected with Apple’s own DRM 
scheme, known as FairPlay. Although you could 
play that music on Apple players — iPods and 
iPhones — you couldn’t play protected music 
on networked devices.
Note that both WMA and AAC can have DRM 
assigned to specific music files. Networked 
digital music players usually cannot play 
DRMed content, so I suggest either paying a 
little extra money to buy DRM-free music, rip­
ping your music from CD or burning an audio 
CD, then re-ripping that CD into a DRM-free 
format.
Recently, though, Apple has removed content 
protection from most iTunes music. There’s still 
a lot of music out there on players that still have 
FairPlay DRM, however, so unless all those 
users re-buy their music, FairPlay will be with 
us for some time.

Serving Up Your Digital Music

Music in Your Home

You can use a number of ways to get your music from your PC to your home 
entertainment center; all do require additional hardware. I look at two exam­
ples of how you can do this: Logitech’s Squeezebox and the Sonos Music 
System.
The Logitech Squeezebox
The original Squeezebox was developed by a company called Slim Devices 
prior to being acquired by peripheral manufacturer Logitech. The philoso­
phy behind the Squeezebox was to make it simple to play your digital music 
anywhere in the house and to make the options flexible.
Currently, a number of Squeezebox products exist: Squeezebox Classic, 
Squeezebox Duet, Squeezebox Touch, Squeezebox Radio, the Squeezebox 
Boom, and the Squeezebox Transporter. In this section, I cover how to set 
up the Squeezebox Duet, a compact, two-piece unit with a remote control 
that behaves much like a portable digital music player, shown in Figures 2-1 
and 2-2.
The Duet’s receiver fits easily into small spaces and connects up to either an 
A/V receiver or to powered speakers. In our hookup, the Squeezebox duet is 
connected to an A/V receiver equipped with a pair of stereo speakers.
	
Figure 2-1:

iPod-like 
controls and 
a small LCD 
screen.

The Squeezebox can be connected via Wi-Fi but also has a built-in wired 
Ethernet connection. Audio output is either through a pair of analog stereo 
RCA connectors (for powered speakers) or your choice of digital coax or 
digital optical cables (for connecting to an A/V receiver).
That’s the Squeezebox Duet hardware. I show you how to use the hardware 
shortly. But first, you have to set up the software that enables music play­
back on the Squeezebox, which is called SqueezeCenter. (You may see refer­
ences online to Slimserver, which is the old name for SqueezeCenter.)
Setting up SqueezeCenter
You can install SqueezeCenter from the CD that ships with the Squeezebox 
or download the latest version from the Logitech Web site (www.logitech.
com).
The installer is a standard Windows installer, so after launching the instal­
lation, just click next and pick the default locations. At the end of the instal­
lation process, SqueezeCenter will launch. SqueezeCenter is actually a 
Web-based application, so don’t be surprised if your favorite Web browser 
fires up at this point.
Now you have to make a decision: Where is your music?
Most people have their digital music stored in whatever default location 
used by their digital music software. For iTunes running in Windows Vista, 
Serving Up Your Digital Music

Book VII 
Chapter 2

that’s usually Users➪<your user name>➪Music➪iTunes➪iTunes Music. For 
Zune, it’s Users➪<your user name>➪Music➪Zune. 
Alternatively, you may choose to have your music live on a home server 
or network-attached storage device (NAS.) That’s my choice for storing 
music. It’s convenient, safer than my desktop PC, since the NAS unit offers 
redundant storage, and accessible even when my PC is turned off. However, 
SqueezeCenter does require your PC to be running.
To use a network storage location, you first need to set up your network 
location as if it were a hard drive on your local PC; this is known as mapping 
a network drive. Simply open up your network location as you usually do, 
then right-click on the network folder and choose Map Network Drive, as 
shown in Figure 2-3.
	
Windows Vista calls user directories simply “music” or documents. Windows 
XP called its user folder “My Documents” or “My Music.” Windows 7 returns 
to this naming convention. So the iTunes music folder above would be 
Users➪<your user name>➪My Music➪iTunes➪iTunes Music.
	
Figure 2-3: 
Mapping 
a network 
drive to a

For the purpose here, I assigned drive letter G: to the music folder on the 
network. Any drive letter will do.
Now that a drive letter is assigned, let’s set up SqueezeCenter. If the 
application hasn’t already launched, go ahead and run it from the icon on 
your desktop or the start menu. I’m skip the Internet access bits for the 
time being and get to what that means in Book VII, Chapter 4. Right now, 
you just want to play the music you’ve stored on our local system or home 
network.
	
1.	 Because my own music is ripped in Windows Media Lossless 
format, I click the first check box. If you’re an iTunes user, click 
the second box, which allows SqueezeCenter to use iTunes. 
(See Figure 2-4.)
	
2.	 The next two steps look identical: Choose a folder for your music loca­
tion and then repeat the step for your playlist location.
	
	 In most cases, your music and playlists are in the same root folder. If 
you’ve stored your playlists in a different location than your music, you 
need to specify this in the second window, Local Playlist Folder shown 
in Figure 2-5.

	 When you click next after choosing your music folder, the screen will 
look the same, but the screen title changes to Choose Playlist Folder.
	
3.	 Now you can just click through.
	
	 SqueezeCenter scans your music folders, which can take a few minutes 
or over an hour, depending on how much music you have. Eventually, 
you’ll see the main SqueezeCenter screen populated with album art (if 
you click on “Albums”). (See Figure 2-6.)
Customized versions of the SqueezeCenter 
exist for non-Windows PCs and other digi­
tal appliances. For example, a version exists 
for NETGEAR’s ReadyNAS line of network-
attached storage devices, which have a ver­
sion of SqueezeCenter running directly on 
the ReadyNAS hardware. If you have such a 
supported device, then your Squeezebox can 
play music directly from the NAS device, and 
you don’t need to have your PC running. Check 
the Logitech support site for more informa­
tion. Note that the number of devices sup­
ported is limited, so if you like this idea, make 
sure the NAS box you’re considering supports 
SqueezeCenter.

Setting up your Squeezebox Duet
Connecting up the Squeezebox hardware is simple: 
Attach the analog stereo RCA cable or the correct digital cable to the input 
on the powered speaker or receiver. For example, on my system, I have the 
Squeezebox connected via a copper RCA digital coax cable to an input on my 
Onkyo A/V receiver — one that’s set up normally for a CD player.
If you’ve just unpacked the Squeezebox Duet, plug in the charging stand and 
charge the remote control for a few hours. The unit ships with two small 
power bricks — one for the remote charging cradle and the other for the 
Duet receiver. While the receiver needs to be near your home audio system, 
the charging stand for the cradle can be located anywhere in your home.
While the physical connections are easy, connecting to your wireless net­
work is a little more work. The Duet Remote has a small color LCD display 
and controls that allow you to navigate through the setup process. Stepping 
through the setup is pretty straightforward, but you have to know three 
things to connect the Squeezebox:
Serving Up Your Digital Music

Book VII 
Chapter 2
Streaming Digital

365
	
✦	 Your SSID. The SSID is the name that your router assigns to the wireless 
network. It may be something as simple as your router’s model name 
(such as D-Link DGL-4500) or some name you entered when you first set 
up the router.
	
✦	 Your security code. If you’re using WEB or WPA security, to prevent out­
side intruders from gaining access to your router, you’ll need to enter 
the WEP or WPA key.
	
✦	 The system name or IP address of the system that’s hosting the 
SqueezeCenter software. Note that the Squeezebox remote will try to 
find this, but you may need to manually enter it.
All this assumes your router is set up to automatically assign IP addresses to 
new devices on the network — most routers do.
After your Squeezebox is connected to the network, you can use the scroll 
wheel and buttons to easily navigate to albums, artists, or playlists and 
begin listening to your digital music collection on your home audio system. 
Now you can enjoy your audio collection using the full range of your best 
speakers.
Using the Sonos Music System
The Squeezebox is a cool standalone digital music player, but what if you 
want to have your digital music play back in multiple locations throughout 
your home? One solution is the Sonos Music System (www.sonos.com.)
The Sonos Music System can be wired or wireless but works very well in a 
wireless environment. Each Sonos unit can find other Sonos devices on the 
network, creating what’s known as a mesh network. If you have a large house 
that may have spotty Wi-Fi coverage, each Sonos box can relay the signal to 
the next one, filling in those Wi-Fi holes in your network coverage.
Why would you want a Sonos system? Simple: It’s easy to control mul­
tiple ZonePlayers using a single remote control. You can have different 
ZonePlayers play different songs or playlists in different rooms. If you like, 
you can add additional remotes, so your spouse can have his or her own. 
But one remote can control multiple players, wirelessly (see Figure 2-7). And 
the remote is not an IR remote, but uses a radio signal, so you don’t need 
line of sight.

The basic Sonos bundle consists of a ZonePlayer 120, a ZonePlayer 90 
(Figure 2-8), and a controller. The ZP120 actually has a built-in digital ampli­
fier, so you can connect them to bookshelf speakers anywhere in the house. 
The ZP90 is designed to connect to either powered speakers or a home 
audio system with an A/V receiver.
	
Figure 2-8:

ZP90 does 
require 
either 
amplified 
speakers or 
connection 
to an A/V 
system.
	
Setting up a Sonos system is even simpler than setting up a Squeezebox. 
First, plug in the remote control cradle into wall power and charge the con­
trol unit. While that’s charging, set up the ZonePlayers. In my house, I used a 
pair of ZP90s attached to two different rooms. One was attached to my home

Using the Sonos Music System
theater system, with a large A/V receiver and a 7.1 surround sound system. 
The other was attached to a smaller powered receiver that only had stereo 
speakers.
In both cases, the ZP90s were connected to the receivers via digital audio 
connections.
Once the remote is charged and the ZonePlayers connected, you pop the 
Sonos installation CD into your PC and run the setup application. Follow the 
prompts — they’re very simple.
During setup, the Sonos software will locate all the ZonePlayers and config­
ure them. You may need to verify a player’s existence by walking up to it and 
pressing a button on the front during setup. (See Figure 2-9.)
As with SqueezeCenter, you need to tell the Sonos software the location of 
all your digital music files, which can be on the local PC or on a network 
storage device.

You can set 
up playlists 
and manage 
music on 
your PC.
	
Unlike the SqueezeCenter, the Sonos natively recognizes file systems on 
network-attached storage devices. So if your music is on an NAS device, you 
don’t need to have your PC running.
Sonos now offers an iPhone/iPod Touch application to control ZonePlayers, 
so you don’t even need to use the bulkier Sonos control unit, though the 
Sonos remote is a little easier to use than the iPhone app.

A Word on Audio Quality
At first, spending $999 or more on a Sonos bundle seems pricey. After you 
get whole-house audio running, controlled by a single remote control, you’ll 
wonder why it costs so little.
A Word on Audio Quality
The era of digital music began when most people connected to the Internet 
via 56kb per second (or slower) modems. At that time, a 40GB hard drive 
was considered huge. So it was natural that the first digital music formats 
available on the Internet were highly compressed files.
When iTunes first started, the only format supported by the iTunes store 
was 128kbps AAC audio. On some music, you could actually hear artifacts 
in the music created when the compression software threw away what it 
thought was empty data.
Now, you have high-speed broadband connections and hard drives as large 
as 2TB. There’s no need to squeeze your music so hard that it loses real 
data.
Today, several formats exist that compress audio losslessly. This means 
that any data that represents actual music is retained. However, music 
compressed with WMA Pro Lossless, Apple Lossless, or FLAC (free lossless 
audio codec) are considerably larger than the highly compressed music you 
buy from the iTunes or Zune stores.
If you like the idea of lossless compression, you can set iTunes, Windows 
Media Player, or the Zune Player to compress in the company’s respective 
lossless format. One source for buying digital music is losslessly encoded, 
MusicGiants (www.musicgiants.com). The library at MusicGiants isn’t as 
large as the iTunes or Zune stores, however.
After broadband becomes ubiquitous, maybe losslessly compressed options 
will become part of the mainstream stores as well. Your ears will thank you.

treaming video over wireless networks is much more challenging than 
audio. Even full CD audio only pushes 176KB (that’s kilobytes) per 
second — hardly enough to challenge even an old 802.11b network in home 
environments. Newer 802.11g or 802.11b networks can handle multiple users 
and multiple CD-quality audio streams.
Video is another beast entirely. DVD-quality video, which is already com­
pressed with the lossy MPEG-2 codec, can consume as much as 9.8MB, or 
over 1.2MB. If you’re thinking about streaming high-definition video, you’re 
looking at bit rates that can approach 20 Mbps. Some pristine, well-mas­
tered Blu-ray discs approach 40 Mbps.
Then there’s the issue of quality of service. Quality of service, or QoS, 
is a nebulous term that tries to capture the idea that your video should 
look good. If you’ve ever watched a video streamed from the Internet, and 
noticed lots of interruptions or breakups in the picture, that’s poor quality 
of service. All the bandwidth in the world isn’t useful if your video stream 
keeps getting interrupted. Modern wireless routers and streaming applica­
tions are built to try to maintain a high level of QoS.
In this chapter, I show you how to maximize your viewing enjoyment while 
streaming video captured on your PC to your living room over your net­
work. You find out about video formats, how to enhance your PC to maxi­
mize throughput, and examine a couple of sample scenarios using existing 
hardware.
Understanding PC Video Formats
As with audio, video is captured and stored on your PC in multiple different 
formats. My goal is not to exhaustively cover all possible formats, but to 

370
explain the basic concepts in the context of getting that video from your PC 
to your home entertainment center.
In the old, pre-digital TV days, television was broadcast in purely analog 
formats. If you wanted to record and store an analog TV signal on your PC, it 
needed to be digitized. A number of different encoding methods emerged to 
convert the analog TV signal to digital format.
The key commonality is that all of these formats used some form of 
compression — usually lossy compression, which meant some of the data 
was actually discarded. Techniques such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, WMV, and 
H.264 can predict what the pixel will look like five frames after the current 
one is displayed, so don’t try to save the pixels in the four intervening frames.
What this actually means is that lossy compression can help reduce the 
bandwidth needed to stream video. Unfortunately, HDTV streams are 
already heavily compressed. A typical over-the-air high-definition broadcast 
can hit 20 Mbps. A cable or satellite HD stream ranges from 5 to 13 Mbps.
Windows Media Center in Windows Vista and Windows 7 can capture high-
definition broadcasts using PC capable tuners. If you want to capture digital 
cable TV shows, you need a tuner capable of ClearQAM capture. Those 
shows need to be unencrypted.
There are PC models built with Windows Vista that can use CableCard to 
capture premium shows which are encrypted by the cable TV provider. But 
you have to buy those PCs as a unit — you can’t add CableCard support to 
an existing PC.
Of course, you won’t want to simply watch TV shows streamed from your 
PC. While the PC can work perfectly well as a DVR (digital video recorder), 
it’s more interesting to use the PC to store and show videos you, your family, 
and friends have shot using digital and high-definition camcorders.
However you get the video into your PC, the tricky part is streaming it from 
your PC to your family room.
Using a PC to Maximize Your Viewing Experience
Before diving into how to display the video streamed from the PC to the 
home entertainment system, I need to talk about the PC that will be deliver­
ing the video.

People often just take whatever PC is handy — the home office PC, their 
laptop — and try to stream video to the TV from a general purpose PC. The 
result is often choppy video with strange compression artifacts. Now, you 
don’t need a dedicated video server. Your home office PC might be good 
enough, but you’ll need to tweak it a bit for best delivery of video content.
Here’s a brief rundown on common digital video formats:
	
✦	 MPEG (including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4): Developed by the 
Motion Pictures Expert Group, the various MPEG formats are perhaps 
the most common encoding scheme. DVDs use MPEG-2; some Blu-ray 
discs are encoded in MPEG-4. Satellite and cable TV often deliver their 
video in MPEG-4 format.
	
✦	 WMV (Windows Media Video): Microsoft’s proprietary video compres­
sion format.
	
✦	 H.264: This is a variant of MPEG-4, used in some Blu-ray movies and 
online video.
	
✦	 AVCHD: This format is common to high-definition camcorders and is 
actually one form of H.264/MPEG-4.
	
✦	 DiVX: This compression format is most commonly used on the Web, 
so if you download videos from the Web to your PC, they may be DiVX 
encoded.
	
✦	 Flash and Silverlight: These are almost exclusively used for streaming 
video over the Web, and it’s unlikely you’ll be doing much downloading 
of Flash or Silverlight video. Flash is a proprietary video format owned 
by Adobe, while Silverlight is a Microsoft product.
	
✦	 AVI, QuickTime, and Transport Streams: These are container formats — 
that is, they are wrappers around a compressed video stream (like MPEG, 
WMV, or DiVX). If you’ve ever wondered why your system can play some 
AVI files but not others, it’s probably because the codec (compressor-
decompressor) needed to decode a particular format isn’t on your system.
To properly decompress and view a video file, you’ll need the right codec 
software. As noted above, just because you can play a container format like 
QuickTime doesn’t mean that you have the correct codec. Modern operating 
systems, like Windows 7, have become much smarter about codec support, 
so it’s worth running Windows 7 if only to avoid having to hunt and down­
load the right codec to playback your video.
Using a PC to Maximize Your Viewing Experience

372
Now that you have some understanding of video formats, you need to know 
what your eventual target device will be. For example, if you know that 
you’re using a Windows Media Center extender, you know it will support 
Windows Media Video, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and possibly MPEG-4. It may not 
directly support AVCHD, which is the format that high-definition camcorders 
use. For our purposes, this is really all you need to know about compression 
schemes.
If you are sure all formats you use are directly supported by the digital 
media adapter, then the PC just becomes responsible for streaming the data. 
That’s a fairly straightforward process, and optimizing for sending out one 
or two video streams is fairly simple — I’ll get to the specific shortly.
On the other hand, if your target device doesn’t support the format directly, 
you’ll need software on the PC that will transcode the format on the PC to 
one that the display device will understand, then stream it to the device. 
What’s more, the transcoding will typically happen in real time.
It works like this. As you request a video from your PC, the PC knows that it 
needs to transcode the file to a format the display hardware understands. 
The transcoding is performed on the fly and then streamed to the TV. Some 
software needs to do this every time the video is streamed. Other soft­
ware will cache the transcoded files, so the next time you want to watch, it 
becomes an exercise in simply streaming the file.
All this sounds complicated, but the right combination of hardware, once 
properly set up, just works. All the transcoding, streaming, and other back­
ground tasks occur silently, without fuss, when you press the Select button 
on your remote control to play the video.
Maximizing streaming performance
You want the video stream to flow without interruptions. Ensuring your 
PC can send the video stream consistently, and without hiccups, is fairly 
straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:
You may have heard that graphics processors — 
the chip that powers the graphics card in your 
system — are capable of handling those proces­
sor intensive transcoding chores. That’s true, to 
an extent. A high-end graphics processor, such 
as an AMD Radeon 4890 or Nvidia 260 GTX 
Core 216, is actually a lot faster at most video 
transcoding than even fast quad-core CPU. 
However, only a few applications support the 
use of video cards for transcoding on the fly, 
and none of them are streaming applications — 
yet. But it’s worth keeping an eye on this rapidly 
developing area.

✦	 Set up a regular schedule to defragment the hard drive. As video is 
recorded to the system’s hard drive, then deleted, then re-recorded, 
parts of newly recorded videos can be spread out over large areas of 
the drive. This can result in poor streaming performance and choppy 
playback.
	
✦	 Use a big hard drive. If you’re capturing high-definition video streams, 
the bigger the hard drive, the better. Part of the problem is that a drive 
that’s almost full (or more than three-quarters full) tends to fragment 
more easily.
	
✦	 Minimize background services. This is particularly true if you have an 
older or lower performing processor. For example, a typical desktop 
PC really doesn’t need to run SmartCard services, telephony services, 
remote desktop services, Tablet Input Services, and others. Shutting 
those down will save memory and CPU cycles.
Maximizing transcoding performance
If your needs require the system to transcode a file into a different format 
before streaming, then you’ll need a beefy CPU and lots of memory. If you 
can swing a midrange quad-core processor or a high-end dual-core CPU, and 
4GB of RAM, you’ll be in good shape.
This is particularly true if you plan on transcoding and streaming high-definition 
formats. For that, you’ll definitely want a quad-core CPU, with at least 4GB of 
RAM, running a 64-bit operating system.
Why a 64-bit OS? The streaming and transcoding apps, like those that ship 
with products like the Sage TV HD Media Extender, aren’t really 64-bit apps 
yet. But a 64-bit operating system (such as Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit) 
actually gives a little more memory to 32-bit applications. And it won’t be 
long before media applications move to 64-bit.
Of course, you’ll also want to apply the tips and tricks I mentioned earlier for 
purely streaming applications as well.
Now that you’ve taken a look at video formats and system tuning, let’s look 
at three examples of hardware and software combinations for watching PC 
video on your HDTV.
Media Center Extenders
I’m using the term media center extenders generically, not just the Microsoft 
Windows Media Center variety. I show you two scenarios. One is based on a 
Windows Media Center Extender by D-Link. The other is the Sage HD Media 
Media Center Extenders

374
Extender. Then I’ll look at the issue of using a game console to stream video 
from the PC to the HDTV. Figure 3-1 shows some example hardware.
Sage TV HD Media Extender
Sage TV has made something of a reputation for being an alternative to 
Microsoft’s Windows Media Center. On the one hand, the user interface 
tends to be just a little less polished than Windows Media Center. On the 
other hand, it’s more powerful and flexible, allowing for heavy customization 
and offering very granular settings.
While you can use the Sage TV software on our PC, our focus here is using 
it in conjunction with Sage TV HD Media Extender. Setup is somewhat con­
voluted. First, you need to install two pieces of software on the PC that 
serves up the content: Sage TV and Sage TV Placeshifter. Installed along with 
Sage TV is the Sage TV server. The server is somewhat inflexible in that all 
content must reside on the PC where Sage TV is running. So you can’t use 
network-attached storage to store your video content.
What Sage TV offers is control over a vast array of features. The setup menu 
is one of the most complete I’ve ever seen (see Figure 3-2).

Sage TV’s 
setup menu 
offers a 
wealth of 
detailed 
settings.
	
Each submenu within Sage TV breaks options down into very granular detail. 
You can adjust overscan settings (useful if the PC is attached directly to a 
TV), pick the DVD rendering method, and more (see Figure 3-3).
The real problem is trying to figure out which settings are actually impor­
tant. It’s best to leave things at their default settings when you first start, 
then adjust settings as needed. For the most part, though, you can leave the 
PC software at their defaults and make changes in the Sage TV HD Media 
Center setup screen.
Many of these settings exist because of the differences in PC hardware. The 
Sage TV HD Media Extender itself also has a rich set of options you can 
change, though it’s somewhat simpler since the hardware is a known quan­
tity. The menus themselves, however, look and operate in a similar way, but 
you’ll use the remote control to configure settings, rather than a mouse and 
keyboard.

Installing the hardware itself is simple. You can use the included analog 
cables, but it’s much better to attach the device to your system using an 
HDMI cable. An HDMI cable doesn’t ship with the unit, so you’ll need to 
obtain one separately.
Getting the unit running with the Sage TV software is an exercise in running 
back and forth between the computer and the location where the HD Media 
Center is installed. You need to enter a code in the Media Center Extender 
that’s supplied by the Sage TV software, and that particular HD Media Center 
extender is locked to that specific PC.
After recording shows off the air, the Sage TV server software streams the 
media to the HD Media Extender. Note that the software doesn’t transcode 
formats, so if you have a video or audio format that’s not recognized by the 
HD Media Extender, the video won’t play back.

Once the device is set up, using the extender is pretty straightforward. You 
use the remote to navigate the onscreen menus, playing back recorded con­
tent, as you would any digital video recorder.
D-Link Wireless N HD Media Center Extender
Most flavors of Windows Vista and Windows 7 used by consumers have 
built-in support for Microsoft Windows Media Center. Table 3-1 sorts out the 
different Windows versions.

Windows Media Center Extenders are pretty much what they sound like — 
you’re essentially running Windows Media Center remotely, on dedicated 
hardware.
The D-Link Wireless N HD Media Center, also known as the D-Link HSM-750, 
is one such gadget. It attaches to your HDTV or A/V receiver via either HDMI 
or analog video. Curiously, if you use HDMI for video, you still need to attach 
a digital audio cable (either optical or coax) to your TV or receiver for audio; 
the HSM-750 uses HDMI for video only.
When you plug in the HSM-750 to a power outlet and turn it on, a Windows 
Media Center–equipped PC will automatically discover the device through 
Windows Universal plug-and-play capability, if the device is plugged into a 
wired network. If you’re planning on using the wireless option, you need to 
first configure the HSM-750 to connect to your wireless network, entering 
the SSID and security information (WEP or WPA key). After that’s done, the 
Windows system can discover the Media Center extender. (See Figure 3-4.)

Follow these steps to finish the process:
	
1.	 Click on the bubble to open a dialog box.
	
	 If you simply want to use the default settings, just click on the button 
labeled Allow, shown in Figure 3-5.
	
2.	 The next step is to connect the Windows Center software with the 
Windows Media Center extender.
	
	 When you first start up the extender, one of the setup screens should 
walk you through this. If not, scroll through the user interface with the 
remote and select setup, then select the Windows Media Center icon 
and press the OK button. You are eventually presented with an eight-
digit key, which you’ll write down and enter on the PC. (See Figure 3-6.)
	
3.	 After entering the eight-digit key, you can click Next several times to 
accept the defaults, shown in Figure 3-7.

ing aspect ratio (usually 16:9 for an HDTV).
	
	 Once connected, the HSM-750 behaves much like a Windows Media 
Center PC. The user interface behaves much the same. However, the 
HSM-750 may not support all the file and compression formats that 
the PC might support. For example, Microsoft’s own Windows Media 
Lossless compression codec for audio isn’t supported.
The HSM-750 can also act as a more general digital media adapter. If you’re 
an iTunes user, you can navigate (outside of the Windows Media Center 
interface) to any PC running iTunes. You’ll have to enable sharing in iTunes, 
but then you can play your ripped or non-DRM music. Network-attached 
storage with built-in iTunes or plug-and-play capability are also visible to the 
Media Center extender.
Finally, the HSM-750 connects to a number of different online streaming ser­
vices, such as Youtube, so you can watch content directly streamed from 
the Internet, no PC needed.

Game Consoles as Digital Media Adapters
Game Consoles as Digital Media Adapters
Game consoles can be used as general purpose digital media extenders. I’m 
not going to walk through the setup process for these consoles, but I will 
discuss each of the major consoles that support Media Center capabilities 
briefly.
Original Xbox
In its out-of-the-box form, Microsoft’s first Xbox lacked any Media Center 
capability. However, since the system was essentially a cut-down PC, enter­
prising programmers developed XMBC (originally the Xbox Media Center). 
XBMC is an open source project that’s free.
The XBMC team strongly suggests that the Xbox have a mod chip installed. 
This is an aftermarket chip that’s installed in the Xbox to bypass some of 
the DRM and other restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Installing a mod chip 
voids the warranty, but since most Xboxes are out of warranty by now, 
that’s not a big deal. You also can’t call Microsoft for help.
Also, XBMC doesn’t support high-definition playback unless the Xbox has 
been modified to upgrade the CPU.
For more on XBMC, check out http://xbmc.org.
Xbox 360
The Xbox 360 can connect as a Media Center extender in several ways. 
A Windows-based PC running Windows Media Connect (available with 
Windows Media Player 11 or later) can connect to an Xbox 360. Navigation is 
a little cumbersome, but it all works fairly well.
If the PC is a Windows Media Center capable PC, the Xbox 360 can also 
act as a Windows Media Center extender, similar to the D-Link HSM-750. 
Configuring the Xbox 360 Windows Media Extender is like any WMC extender 
hardware — generate an eight-digit code, enter it on the PC, and you’re off 
and running.
You can extend the capabilities of Windows Media Center 11 by adding an 
application called TVersity (www.tversity.com) on your PC. TVersity will 
even transcode formats that the Xbox 360 doesn’t natively understand into 
supported formats before streaming.
All in all, the Xbox 360 is a versatile media center extender, whose capabili­
ties can be enhanced by third-party software.

382
Game Consoles as Digital Media Adapters
Sony PlayStation 3
The PlayStation 3 is a DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) capable device. 
DLNA builds on the Universal plug-and-play standard to allow easy commu­
nication between disparate devices and PCs with media stored on them.
The PS3 is a capable media center extender, but lacks some of the tighter 
integration available with the Xbox 360. But if you have DLNA compliant 
media server software on the PC, or DLNA-enhanced network-attached stor­
age, it’s easy to navigate and playback media. As of Windows 7, Windows 
Media Connect is DLNA compliant, so you don’t need third-party software if 
you’re playing back supported formats.

Chapter 4: Listening to Music and 
Audio from the Web
In This Chapter
✓	Finding good entertainment on the Web
✓	Watching on your PC
T
he world of audio and video is changing. In the past 30 years, we saw 
the shift from broadcast TV to cable and satellite sources. Now, we’re 
starting to see the shift to Internet-based channels for TV and music. It’s 
even possible to forego paid services and get all your entertainment from 
the Web.
Alas, it’s not easy. There are a huge variety of sources, from user-created 
content like YouTube to repackaging of commercial TV and movies on Hulu. 
Help is at hand, however, with software that can help you sort through the 
choices and stream the content you want to watch directly to your TV from 
the PC.
In addition, companies that make Blu-ray players and HDTVs are now build­
ing the capability into their sets to directly access some of the content 
streamed from the Internet.
The biggest problem is the walls that content providers put up. Want to 
watch NASCAR? You need to go to www.ESPN.com. Trying to find your 
favorite movies? Hulu is one place — but not all movies are on Hulu.
In this chapter, I show you how to find that content plus explore some 
sources for music and video. Then I take a look at the hardware you might 
need to get that Internet content from your PC to the TV. Finally, we’ll take 
a look at some software packages that make life a little easier in getting your 
favorite audio or video to your home entertainment center.
Finding Content
The show you want to watch is almost certainly somewhere out there on 
the Internet. We’re not talking about illegal downloads. Instead, there’s a 
wealth of video and music legally available for your entertainment pleasure.

384
Watching on Your PC
The problem is finding all that content. Sure, you can search on Google or 
Bing to find a particular show, but doing so is a tedious process.
This issue of locating your favorite shows exists because the content pro­
viders seriously guard their intellectual property. So they put up walls that 
make it difficult to get to what you want to watch from a single source.
Progress is slowly being made to aggregate all the balkanized world of 
copyrighted video, movies, and music. Some of these solutions require a 
particular piece of hardware, while others are software based. Finding the 
best solution for your viewing and listening pleasure is still something of a 
compromise, but instead of dozens of Web sites, all you need is a PC and the 
right hardware attached to your home theater system.
In the next section, I begin with solutions that exist on the PC for watching 
movies, TV, and listening to music available on the Web. Then I show you 
how you can get that from the PC to the living room.
Watching on Your PC
You’ve almost certainly watched hilarious or moving user-created videos on 
YouTube. If you want to watch commercially produced shows, however, you 
need to look elsewhere.
Two providers of streaming content that also rent or sell hard goods, such 
as DVDs, are Netflix (www.netflix.com) and Amazon (www.amazon.com). 
I take a closer look at the Netflix streaming service shortly.
Recently, Hulu, shown in Figure 4-1, has become increasingly popular. Hulu.
com is a Web site that aggregates vast amounts of video — movies, TV 
shows, trailers, short subjects — into one easy-to-navigate site. Like broad­
cast television, Hulu pays for the shows by requiring you to watch adver­
tisements. The good news is that Hulu ads are generally shorter and less 
intrusive than broadcast TV ads.
If you are a serious sports fan, or perhaps love watching NASCAR, the indi­
vidual Web sites for the different leagues will often stream video. For exam­
ple, if you want to subscribe to an entire season of baseball, you can head 
over to the Major League Baseball site, www.MLB.com. The sports sites, 
such as MLB.com, do a great job of integrating stats, video, and interactive 
features.

Sitting in front of your PC isn’t the ultimate goal, however. You want to 
get that great streaming content onto your TV. There are ways of getting 
substantial amounts of entertainment to your living room with the right 
hardware — hardware that’s easier to set up and use than a PC.
We’re going to assume that you’ve got an HDTV and possibly an audio-video 
receiver and a surround sound speaker setup. It all looks and sounds great 
when watching broadcast shows or DVDs. I explain how to go further by 
streaming video in the next sections.
Using Xbox 360 for media
I touch on using the Xbox 360 as a Windows Media Center Extender (WMCE) 
in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
But the Xbox 360 offers additional streaming and downloadable video 
services. These include a variety of TV shows, music videos, independent 
videos, and movies. Some are somewhat obscure, some popular. Curiously 
lacking is sports content, which seems heavily weighted toward combat 
sports.

386
Watching on Your PC
While some of the content is free, most of it is paid through Microsoft Points, 
Microsoft’s attempt to manage pricing. If you can get the same content in 
different parts of the world, the point cost is the same — but the amount 
of money each point costs in real terms may differ. In the U.S. currently, 80 
points is equivalent to one dollar.
Movies range in point costs from 200 points for older, obscure movies in 
standard definition to 480 points for newly released Hollywood movies. 
However, movies are rented — which means the movie is watchable for any 
number of viewings in the first 24 hours and expires after 14 days.
TV shows are another matter. Prices are widely divergent, ranging from free 
to a staggering 4400 points for the UFC Live show, one of a number of fight­
ing shows on the 360. Unlike movies, TV shows don’t expire, so you can keep 
them on the Xbox 360 hard drive as long as you want — as long as you have 
drive space available.
The issue of drive space is a crucial one. The original Xbox 360 Pro had a 
20GB hard drive, barely large enough to hold a handful of high-definition TV 
shows. Watching a series — and keeping them on the system — was prob­
lematic. However, with TV shows, you can re-download a show to the same 
Xbox 360 if you’ve paid for it. The maximum amount of storage available is 
120GB for the Xbox 360 Elite — better, but in the era of terabyte hard drives, 
hardly substantial.
Also available on the Xbox 360 is the Netflix Watch Instantly streaming ser­
vice. You do have to have a Netflix subscription, and that subscription has 
to be a minimum $8.99 one, which leaves out those with a basic, two-disc per 
month plan.
You also need to set up the Watch Instantly queue on your PC using a Web 
browser. Although you can edit top lists in the Xbox 360 directly, it’s a bit 
clumsy, so using the PC Web browser is still easier.
Standalone devices exist that can accept streaming media from the PC. 
These include Windows Media Center Extenders, such as D-Link’s DSM-750, 
which supports 802.11n wireless connectivity. These devices generally layer 
some capability in addition to supporting WMC streaming from a PC. For 
example, the previously mentioned DSM-750 (Book VII Chapter 3) directly 
supports YouTube videos, provided your home has a broadband connection 
to the Internet.

Another interesting device is the SageTV HD Media Extender (www.sagetv.
com). The SageTV HD Media Extender is a combination of the SageTV soft­
ware running on the PC and the Media Extender hardware, which streams 
video captured by SageTV’s software.
If all you want is Netflix Watch Instantly on your HDTV, Roku (www.roku
labs.com) offers a $99 box that supports Netflix Watch Instantly plus 
Amazon’s own Amazon Video on Demand service.
DLNA hardware
	
DLNA is an acronym for Digital Living Network Alliance. DLNA is both an 
organization of technology companies and a standard developed by that 
organization for sharing media between the PC, HDTV, music players, cam­
eras, and other consumer electronic devices.
Hundreds of DLNA-certified devices, including a number of network-ready 
HDTV units, are available. DLNA is a pretty basic standard and has suffered 
from implementation differences between hardware manufacturers. In addi­
tion, even though the PC was a key component of the DLNA standard, no

Watching Internet TV in Your Living Room: PlayOn
Having DLNA-compliant hardware means removing any intermediary 
devices. Although having a Windows Media Center Extender or game con­
sole has its own benefits, soon you’ll be able to attach your HDTV, Blu-ray 
disc player, or set-top box to your network and stream content directly to 
your home entertainment system.
Some newer devices even have built-in services. For example, some LG 
HDTVs and Blu-ray players have the Netflix Watch Instantly service available 
on the unit.
Watching Internet TV in Your Living Room: PlayOn
Let’s say you’ve got a Windows Media Center Extender (WMCE) or an Xbox 
360 attached to your HDTV. Anything you can get on Windows Media Center 
on the PC is available in your console or WMCE device, right?
Not quite. As it turns out, services like Hulu and Netflix don’t stream from 
Windows Media Center to an extender or console. However, software exists 
which takes those video streams, transcodes their formats into a format that 
your device can understand, and pipes it directly to your networked home 
theater.
The software is called PlayOn and is available from MediaMall Technologies 
(www.themediamall.com). PlayOn is a PnP (universal plug-and-play) 
media server that runs on the PC.
PlayOn supports a variety of streaming Internet services, including Hulu, 
YouTube, CBS, ESPN, CNN, and Netflix Watch Instantly. Setting up PlayOn is 
simple. You download the software from PlayOn’s Web site and install it on 
your PC. (See Figure 4-3) Some services, such as Hulu, require login names 
and passwords, and you can enter these into the PlayOn configuration con­
trol panel. Others, like the CBS network, just stream directly from a virtual 
folder on the PC.

PlayOn has two issues that keep it from being more widely used: minimum 
PC requirements and limited hardware playback support.
PlayOn converts video formats on the fly as they stream from the source 
on the Web, to a format that the playback device can understand, a pro­
cess known as transcoding. What this means is that you need a pretty 
beefy system. PlayOn recommends a dual-core CPU with 2GB of RAM at a 
minimum for standard definition transcoding. High-definition transcoding 
requires a high-performance dual-core or quad-core CPU.
PlayOn support for playback devices is limited. Currently, PlayOn officially 
supports the following hardware for playback:
	
✦	 DirecTV HR21-100 HD DVR and HR20 receiver
	
✦	 D-Link DSM-510, DSM-520, and DSM-750 media extenders
	
✦	 Pioneer Elite Pro-1140 HDTV

✦	 Xbox 360
	
✦	 PlayStation 3
Other devices are unofficially supported, and you can find discussions about 
additional devices in the PlayOn forums.
PlayOn costs about $40, although they occasionally offer half-price specials 
on the MediaMall Web site. It’s really an elegant solution, slowly garnering 
wider support on a variety of networked playback devices due to its PnP and 
DLNA support.
Radio Internet: Web Radio in the Living Room
A wealth of radio-style programming exists on the Internet. These range from 
traditional radio stations simulcasting over the Web, to podcasts, to a range 
of other audio services, like the music recommendation service Last.fm.
In Chapter 2, we talked about devices like the Logitech Squeezebox and the 
Sonos Music Player. If you have one of these products, or something similar, 
you should be comfortable streaming music from your PC. What about all 
that Internet radio?
Now, take a look at the Squeezebox Duet as an example of something that 
can also act as an Internet radio player. First, you need to create an account 
on Logitech’s SqueezeNetwork (www.squeezenetwork.com).
After your account is created, you set it up in SqueezeCenter on your PC. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click on the Settings button on the lower right of the SqueezeCenter 
main window, shown in Figure 4-4; then click the SqueezeCenter tab.
	
2.	 Enter your SqueezeNetwork login information and click Apply and 
then Close. (See Figure 4-5.)

Other devices, such as those from Sonos or Roku, also allow access to 
Internet radio in your living room or family room.
Internet radio and video have come a long way since the days of choppy, 
highly compressed content. Now you have access to a vast array of content, 
from traditional media sources to edgy, new media producers working out of 
their homes and garages. Grab that remote, plop yourself down, and take it 
all in.

and Satellite Radio

O
n June 12, 2009, a remarkable thing happened in the United States: All 
analog television signals vanished. The digital television revolution, 
which began years before, has reached its climax. The federally mandated 
switch to digital television ended the more than half-century reign of analog 
TV. Not only were the old, bulky CRT TVs a thing of the past, but the very 
way TV signals were transmitted and processed inside the TV had changed.
A similar revolution was also occurring in radio. Over-the-air digital radio 
lagged behind satellite radio services such as Sirius XM, but both satellite 
radio and the emerging over-the-air HD radio bring radio firmly into the 21st 
century. I’ll look at the various options for digital television and radio, so 
you can understand the choices and better enjoy the wealth of digital con­
tent available from a wide variety of providers.
Making HDTV Choices
Purchasing a television used to be so simple. All you needed to know was 
what size you wanted. All analog TVs were built pretty much the same.
Then home theater became popular, and TVs became more complicated — 
but only a little. The TVs were still pretty much the same, although some big 
screen TVs used three small CRTs (cathode ray tubes) to project the image 
onto a screen, rather than one large CRT as the main screen. More choices 
of connections also became available. In addition to the little, yellow plug — 
composite video — you also had S-Video and component video. Many users 
simply connected their antenna or cable box directly to the antenna input 
on the TV.

394
Then HDTV arrived, and the complexity of choices exploded by an order 
of magnitude. Several different display technologies arrived on the scene, 
the number of ways to connect to those displays exploded, and confusion 
reigned. On top of that, different methods of delivery have competed for 
viewers’ attention, including cable, over-the-air, and satellite television.
The latest wrinkles include direct streaming of video over the Internet, and 
Blu-ray, the replacement for the highly popular DVD disc format.
Part of the mix also includes multichannel audio — 5.1 or 7.1 surround 
sound — once the purview of movie theaters. Now that you can buy TVs 
as big as 65 or more inches (diagonally measured), adding surround sound 
brings the theater into your family room.
The key thing to remember is that if you don’t have a TV with an over-the-air 
tuner, whether it’s built into the TV itself, an external DTV converter box, or 
part of a cable or satellite digital tuner, then you cannot receive over-the-air 
(OTA) DTV and high-definition broadcasts. Whatever else you buy, don’t 
forget this simple rule.
Understanding All Those Terms
The list of features that are printed on the side of an HDTV box seems to 
consist of a mind-numbing array of acronyms, numbers, and indecipherable 
terms. Surprisingly, you can ignore a lot of those features if all you want is 
a straightforward high-definition television. Many of the terms you see have 
more to do with issues like image quality or overall visual fidelity, rather 
than the basic stuff you need. In the following sections, I cover the basic 
terminology.
Display technology
When HDTV first became popular, flat panel TVs — plasma and LCD TVs — 
were very expensive. So rear projection was popular for a time. A rear pro­
jection system consists of a big screen inside a large box that’s mostly air. 
Inside the box is a small projector that projects the image through a series 
of lenses and prisms onto the large screen.
Rear projection HDTV
Because you need all that volume, rear projection TVs are bulky, even 
though the technology used in the projectors is small. There were two 
main types of rear projection TVs that were popular: DLP (Digital Light 
Processing), a technology developed by Texas Instruments, and LCoS (liquid

and Satellite Radio

crystal on silicon). In actual practice the differences are minor, but LCoS 
TVs are pretty much extinct. DLP still exists, but mostly in very large screen 
HDTVs.
Rear projection TV is still a great bargain if you want a really big screen. You 
can typically buy a 65-inch or larger DLP RPTV for less than $2,000. Some 
other features, such as 3D movies (those movies that require you to use the 
special glasses) may serve to keep DLP alive for a time.
But the real action these days are flat panel TVs. Two different types of flat 
panel technologies coexist today: LCD and plasma. Plasma HDTVs have tiny 
cells, each of which behaves almost like a tiny CRT. LCD TVs are much like 
the flat panel screens used on personal computers, but much larger. 
Flat panel TVs: Plasma versus LCD
Until recently, the differences in image quality between plasma and LCDs 
were substantial. LCD TVs were great in bright rooms but not so good for 
light-controlled environments — particularly a darkened room where you 
might be watching a high-definition movie with lots of low-light content. 
Plasmas were also much better for high-motion content, like sports.
Advances in LCD technologies have narrowed the gap considerably, though 
some differences still exist. Higher refresh rate — the speed at which frames 
are displayed on the screen — and new backlighting technologies, like LED 
backlighting, have made LCD TVs much more attractive. Today, the real 
difference is size: If you want something 50 inches and larger, plasmas are 
a better buy. On the other hand, 55-inch and smaller LCDs can be found at 
reasonable prices. 
At that crossover size — 50 to 55 inches — the choice becomes a matter of 
taste. Better quality LCD TVs cost nearly as much as (sometimes more than) 
a good plasma.
One issue that dogged plasma TVs for years was the problem of burn in. If 
you left the TV on for a long time — say, on ESPN — that little ESPN “bug” at 
the lower right of the screen would eventually become a permanent ghost 
image that overlaid everything else. That problem no longer exists. Similarly, 
plasma TVs had a reputation of consuming more energy than LCD TVs, 
something that’s a concern with green-aware consumers. But big LCD TVs 
use nearly as much juice as newer plasmas. 
Both LCD TVs and plasma panels had issues with the overall life span, but 
today’s models typically have life spans in excess of 50,000 hours to half-
bright. That means a good eight years or more. The technology is evolving 
so rapidly, that you’ll likely get a new TV before you notice any issues with 
fading images on plasma TVs.
Understanding All Those Terms

396
	
Ultimately, which technology you want is really a matter of preference and 
budget. The best advice is to take the time to view lots of content on the TVs 
you’re considering before buying.
Resolution
Display resolution as it applies to HDTV is simply a measure of the number 
of pixels on the screen and is typically shown as (number of horizontal 
pixels) x (number of vertical pixels). For example, many large-screen LCDs 
are 1920 x 1080.
Early HDTVs shipped in a variety of resolutions, including oddball pixel for­
mats such as 1366 x 768, 1440 x 900, and even 1024 x 1024 (using nonsquare 
pixels.) A number of digital TVs also supported something called EDTV 
(extended-definition TV), which was 720 x 480 pixels, but progressively 
scanned (see below). Thankfully, this silly bit of confusion has all but 
disappeared.
Today, it’s much simpler: You typically have 1920 x 1080 and 1280 x 720. 
These are often shortened to 1080p and 720p.
That p stands for progressive, as in progressive scanning. Progressive scan­
ning simply means that the display is generated by displaying the entire 
image at once. This differs from interlaced scanning, which displays alter­
nate images that are actually one-half the frame height. You’ll see references 
to 1080i, in which two images of 1920 x 540 are rapidly displayed in succes­
sion; each interlaced frame actually comprises one complete image frame.
This idea of interlaced versus progressive scanning is actually a holdover 
from the old days of CRT displays, when an electron beam painted the image 
on the screen by rapidly scanning the beam over the inside of the screen. 
Modern digital TVs can now just display the entire image at once.
Interlacing works because the two half-frames are thrown up on the screen 
so fast, your eye is fooled into seeing it as a single frame. This idea of pro­
gressive versus interlaced is important because broadcasters transmit HDTV 
images in either 720p or 1080i; there are no HDTV broadcasts in the U.S. that 
are 1080p.
Why, then, do you see so many larger displays that describe themselves as 
1080p? That’s because circuitry built into the TV itself combines the two 
interlaced half-frames into a single image before they’re displayed; this is 
known as deinterlacing. While home theater enthusiasts often argue about 
how well different HDTVs deinterlace signals, most current generation TVs 
do it well enough that the majority of viewers don’t notice problems.
Understanding All Those Terms

Book VII 
Chapter 5

and Satellite Radio
397
The new Blu-ray high-definition disc standard, on the other hand, does sup­
port 1080p, so Blu-ray content can take advantage of the full resolution of a 
1080p display.
The bottom line: if you’re getting a larger HDTV — above 32 inches — it’s a 
good idea to opt for 1080p display. 
Understanding standard definition
Standard definition TV is simply TV as it was shot and produced before the 
HDTV era. All your old favorites were shot in standard definition. SDTV, as 
it’s sometimes called, had very low resolution — 480i — and was designed 
to be displayed on old CRT televisions with electron beams that scanned 
across the interior of the tube.
This very low resolution relative to true HDTV is challenging for HDTVs to 
display well, but a good quality HDTV can at least show a presentable SDTV 
signal. Similarly, DVDs were also 480i, but the production quality of DVDs is 
typically much higher, so the problems aren’t as glaring when watching DVD 
movies. 
Understanding aspect ratio
While the issue of available resolution of HDTVs has simplified a bit, under­
standing aspect ratios is still a confusing topic. Aspect ratio is simply the 
horizontal resolution divided by the vertical resolution, and is typically dis­
played as (some number):(some number).
For example, 1920 x 1080, which is the maximum HDTV resolution, is 1.78:1 
(sometimes also referred to as 16:9); 1280 x 720 is also 1.78:1. This ratio of 
1.78:1 is actually built into the industry standard for HDTV.
So if all available HDTVs are 1.78:1, what’s the big deal? 
There are two sources of confusion: movies and standard definition TV.
Movies are shot in a variety of aspect ratios. In fact, there are too many to 
really discuss here; if you’re interested in the topic of movie aspect ratios, a 
good source is the Widescreen.org aspect ratio page: www.widescreen.org/
aspect_ratios.shtml.
Standard definition TV was modeled on the original Academy movie aspect 
ratio, or 4:3. You’ll also see 4:3 reduced to 1.33:1 — either format is correct 
and means the same thing. Worse, standard definition TV is effectively 480i, 
or 640 x 480 interlaced. So not only is the aspect ratio different, the effective 
resolution is much less. As Figure 5-1 shows, if the SDTV image is displayed 
on an 1920 x 1080 display, this is what you see.
Understanding All Those Terms

very small.
	
You really want to avoid this, and most HDTVs will allow you to stretch the 
image but maintain the correct aspect ratio, as in Figure 5-2.
You’ll still see black or gray bars on either side.
Many HDTVs try to intelligently scale the 4:3 image to fit the entire screen, 
but this can result in a distorted image. Many viewers don’t seem to actually 
care, preferring not to fiddle with the HDTV settings. It’s entirely personal 
preference, though image quality purists may cringe at this.

Wide-screen movies will show letterboxing at the top and bottom, rather 
than the left and right sides. Just briefly, this is what you’d see with the two 
most common wide-screen movie aspect ratios, 1.85: 1 and 2.35:1, shown in 
Figures 5-3 and 5-4.
Again, most current HDTVs try to scale the image to use the entire screen, 
with some distortion. Again, whether you do that or not entirely depends on 
how you value image quality.

That’s resolution, interlacing, and aspect ratios in a nutshell. There are many 
more considerations when buying an HDTV. Mostly, though, take along some 
content (DVDs or Blu-ray movies) with you when buying an HDTV or at least 
insist on watching some content that you tend to view often. Then choose 
the TV based on what you see on the screen.
Shopping for an HDTV
Now that you have an understanding of several key technical terms, let’s go 
shopping!
Consider the following items when shopping for an HDTV:
	
✦	 Budget: How much money are you willing to spend? Your budget deter­
mines what feature set you can afford and also affects the ultimate 
screen size of the HDTV you purchase.
	
✦	 Physical size: Have a huge living room and a small budget? Maybe a 
large format, DLP rear projection TV would work. On the other hand, if 
you have tight space constraints, perhaps because you have a particular 
piece of furniture that will house the HDTV, then that will dictate the 
maximum size of the unit.
	
✦	 Content Source: What’s the source of the HD content? If you want to use 
an over-the-air antenna exclusively, you’ll need an HDTV with a built-in 
tuner or you’ll have to make sure that an external tuner is part of the 
package. If you plan on watching exclusively through cable, then you 
may not need a built-in tuner. 
	
✦	 Connections: Finally, if all you want to connect is a cable or satellite 
box, you may not need many inputs. Similarly, if you’re connecting 
multiple devices through an A/V receiver, one input on the HDTV will 
suffice. But if you want to have many devices connected directly to the 
HDTV, then you want to have multiple inputs — as many as you have 
devices to connect.
Prices of HDTVs have dropped considerably in the past several years, and 
it’s not uncommon to find a 50-inch LCD for around $1,000 and a 50-inch 
plasma at nearly the same price — and those are the prices for 1080p. Above 
about 55 inches, prices increase much more rapidly, due to manufacturing 
constraints. Again, determine your budget and space constraints before 
going shopping.

As I noted earlier, make sure to watch some content on the HDTVs you’re 
seriously considering buying. Even good quality HDTVs may handle color, 
brightness, and contrast a little differently, so personal preference often 
has a strong impact on what you buy. Note also that most HDTVs in show­
rooms typically have their controls set to be very bright, with very saturated 
colors, so that the images “pop” on the showroom floor. 
One final word about buying: you should also make sure to buy your HDTV 
from a store with a solid return and exchange policy, in case the unit you 
buy simply won’t work in your viewing environment.
Understanding Content Sources
Assuming you actually want to use your HDTV to view shows, you need a 
content source. The three primary sources of HDTV programming are over-
the-air (OTA), cable TV, and satellite TV. A fourth source, streaming video 
from the Internet, is in its infancy but is rapidly becoming a popular alterna­
tive. Take a look at the options in the following sections.
Receiving TV over the air
Getting your programming over the air, using an antenna, has one key ben­
efit: it’s free. Depending on your location, you may have access to few or 
many channels of digital programming. Large urban areas can have access to 
30 or more digital TV channels.
I’m assuming your entire setup is fairly current. 
Whether your cable company is supplying you 
with a cable box or you’re using a home theater 
A/V receiver, the best way to connect your HDTV 
today is HDMI (high-definition multimedia inter­
face). HDMI carries both audio and video signals, 
so you only need one cable connecting a single 
source to the HDTV. It’s far more convenient 
than component video cables with separate 
digital audio cables, for example. Plus, HDMI 
can carry all the newer high-definition audio 
standards, such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD 
Master Audio.
A word about HDMI
Understanding Content Sources

402
All you need for OTA reception is a tuner and an antenna. Typically, you can 
buy a good antenna from the same source where you bought your HDTV. 
Note that some antennas are directional, while others can gather signals in 
all directions (omnidirectional.) Make sure to consult your dealer for the 
type of antenna best for your local area.
A good source of information on antennas and ways to help maximize your 
HDTV over the air reception is antennaweb.org, a Web site cosponsored by 
the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) and the National Association of 
Broadcasters (NAB).
If you’re lucky, you may only need an indoor antenna. Could the days of the 
rabbit ears be returning?
Even if you have cable or satellite TV, you may still want to have OTA recep­
tion. The reason is that over-the-air broadcasts actually offer better image 
quality, since satellite and cable providers often use heavy compression on 
their HD signals, reducing image quality. So if you have a choice of receiving 
a particular show through an OTA source, for from cable/satellite, get it from 
the local broadcast.
You also need an over-the-air tuner. OTA tuners are built into most modern 
HDTVs, but they’re also often included in satellite or cable TV set-top boxes.
There is one difference between getting digital TV over the air and the old 
analog broadcasts. With DTV, you either get a picture or you don’t. There’s 
no fuzzy image because of poor reception. Poor reception means no picture 
at all, with DTV.
Until recently, you could buy an HDTV without 
a built-in, over-the-air tuner. These were really 
just large monitors, not true TVs, and were 
often labeled “HDTV ready.” You had to add 
your own content source. Most HDTVs today 
ship with an included OTA tuner, but you may 
still stumble across the occasional model that 
lacks a tuner. Be aware of what you’re buying, 
since you need some source of HDTV content 
if you want to actually watch anything on your 
shiny new display.

Premium services: Satellite and cable
Satellite and cable TV providers are pay services, usually requiring a 
monthly subscription fee. If you want to add HDTV and premium channels 
(such as HBO or Showtime), you may need to pay additional monthly fees. 
The advantage of premium services is the lack of commercial interruption.
Note that cable and satellite often offer similar mixes of HDTV programming, 
though there is some exclusive content on the different providers. 
Receiving HDTV via satellite TV
Both local and cable channels broadcasting in HDTV are available from 
two satellite TV service providers, DirectTV and Dish Network. For an addi­
tional fee, you subscribe to local stations, receiving them via your satellite 
provider rather than over the air. However, the satellite set-top boxes also 
include OTA tuners, so you can hook up an antenna to them to get OTA 
HDTV from a single source.
Along with cable TV providers, satellite TV services are offering a package 
of HDTV content that goes beyond these local stations. They include new 
channels, such as ESPN HD, Discovery HD, HDnet (movies), HBO HD, and 
Showtime HD. 
You usually need to purchase or rent a new set-top box that receives HDTV con­
tent. This investment is on top of the one you make for the high-definition TV. 
One popular option is the DVR (digital video recorder), which enables you to 
time-shift your viewing. A DVR contains a large capacity hard drive that stores 
shows for later viewing, much like people did in the analog era with VCRs.
Receiving HDTV over cable TV
Receiving HDTV programming over cable TV is similar to getting it from a 
satellite TV provider. In some cases, you could have trouble receiving all of 
the local HDTV channels directly on cable, if the local cable provider hasn’t 
signed contracts with local TV stations to offer local content. However, you 
can still get those local channels through an OTA tuner.
As with satellite TV, local cable providers often offer DVR capability if you want 
to record shows for later viewing. A few cable companies are experimenting 
with virtual DVRs. A virtual DVR doesn’t actually store the show in a local set-to 
box, but flags it back at the cable provider’s server farm for later viewing.
Understanding Content Sources

404
Understanding Content Sources
Some HDTV TV sets offer CableCard slots. With one of these cards, you can 
bypass the set-top box and plug the coaxial cable into your TV. You insert a 
card into a CableCard slot, which carries information about the services you 
are allowed to view, as well as any limitations on the programming you can 
record.
TV over the Internet
A generation of new streaming video services, some free, some fee based, is 
emerging. Free services like Hulu (www.hulu.com) are gaining in popular­
ity. Like broadcast television, the Hulu service uses commercials to pay for 
the programming, though the commercial interruptions are typically briefer 
than broadcast television.
Companies such as Amazon and Netflix also offer streaming services. 
Amazon’s streaming service is pay-per-view. Netflix, on the other hand, 
offers their Netflix Watch Instantly service free to any current Netflix sub­
scriber who has more than the most basic subscription.
Image quality ranges from poor, if you have a slow, unreliable Internet con­
nection, to high definition, if you have a high-speed broadband connection. 
However, not all shows or movies are available from any single service.
Getting streaming Internet services to your TV is something of a challenge. 
You can use your Wi-Fi network to deliver content streamed to your PC to 
the TV. Some services, like Netflix’s Watch Instantly service, are available in 
a standalone set-top box which connects directly to your TV, or on the Xbox 
360 game console.
A new standard for connecting HDTVs to 
cable TV, known as CableCard, emerged sev­
eral years back, but it wasn’t widely adopted. 
CableCard theoretically allowed TV producers 
to embed a digital cable tuner in the HDTV itself 
that was independent of the cable provider. 
Once the TV was installed, you would call your 
local cable provider who would supply you 
with the proper CableCard for your area. The 
problem was that the first CableCard standard 
was one way, which meant that interactive 
services like video on demand still required a 
telephone connection. CableCard 2.0 attempts 
to address this key issue, but future adoption 
remains in doubt. For the moment, the better 
option is to buy an HDTV without a built-in digi­
tal cable tuner and go with the set-top box sup­
plied by the local cable provider. If you want 
to use TiVO HD, though, you’ll need to get two 
CableCards from your local provider, one for 
each of the cable tuners built into a TiVO high-
definition DVR.

Heavenly Radio
The Xbox 360 itself offers downloadable TV shows and movies for a fee. 
Similarly, Apple TV uses Apple’s own iTunes service to deliver video and 
music to your HDTV from the Apple TV box itself.
Emerging classes of HDTV and accessory products now have some of these 
services built into the unit itself. For example, some HDTV and Blu-ray play­
ers have Ethernet connections and can connect directly to the Internet, 
offering services like Watch Instantly directly on your TV — no PC needed.
Heavenly Radio
The era of driving in your car and listening to crackling and hissing radio sta­
tions interfering with each other is almost gone. The new era of digital radio, 
whether from satellite services like Sirius XM or the emerging generation of 
HD radio stations, will forever change the way we listen to radio.
Satellite radio
If you’re looking for all the possible radio programming you could ever want, 
you need look no farther than Sirius XM, which provides satellite radio ser­
vice nationwide. Most newer cars and many aftermarket automobile radio 
receivers offer Sirius XM. Of course, you do have to pay a monthly subscrip­
tion fee of $12.95 per month. The service does offer a lifetime membership 
for around $500, but you can only switch receivers three times during that 
“lifetime.”
HD radio
Digital radio is quietly, but rapidly, supplanting traditional AM/FM radio. It’s 
quiet, because digital radio coexists alongside AM/FM, but you do need new 
hardware to receive the HD radio signals. Many newer cars and home audio 
receivers now have HD radio tuners built in. The audio quality of HD radio is 
substantially better than typical AM/FM radio and nearly as good as satellite 
radio.

magine being able to carry dozens of books around with you, without the 
weight and bulk of actual books. Now imagine you can buy those books 
anywhere, anytime, and have them delivered nearly instantaneously, what­
ever your location.
That’s the promise of Amazon’s Kindle. I get into more detail about what an 
eBook is, but for the moment, think of it as a thin, portable device for stor­
ing and reading anything that can be converted into electronic text. The 
Kindle revolutionized eBooks by adding the capability to buy books and 
have them automatically transferred wirelessly to the Kindle.
I explain how eBooks work in this chapter.
Understanding eBooks
When people first look at eBook readers and compare their prices to other 
devices, like Netbooks (small, Internet-connected laptops), the initial reac­
tion is negative. After all, the second-generation Kindle 2 costs $299, the 
same price as many Netbooks. If you want the larger-screen Kindle DX, that 
costs a hefty $489.
Electronic book readers are built around a technology known as e-paper, or 
electronic ink. These are unlike the LCD displays in laptops in several ways:
	
✦	 The image requires no refresh, which means the text or image is con­
stant (no flickering). That makes it easier on the eyes and uses much 
less power than LCD displays.
	
✦	 The surface of e-paper is reflective, rather than requiring a backlight 
(as a standard LCD) or emitting its own light (as with OLEDs).
	
✦	 Current e-paper implementations are monochrome or shades of gray 
only, though color versions are working in research laboratories.

408
The extraordinarily low power draw, coupled with the reduced eyestrain 
relative to LCD displays, makes eBook readers compelling for actually read­
ing. I’ve read very long books on the Kindle for hours at a time, with almost 
none of the eye fatigue associated with extended computer use.
A variety of eBook readers exist, from companies like Sony, iRex, Samsung, 
and others. Amazon launched the original Kindle in 2007. The Kindle offered 
a 6-inch screen and four shades of gray. The Kindle’s key innovation was its 
built-in Whispernet capability, which uses Verizon’s CDMA cell network to 
wirelessly transmit books bought on the Amazon.com store to the Kindle.
The Kindle was followed up with the notably thinner and slightly lighter 
Kindle 2. The Kindle 2 offers longer battery life, 16 shades of gray, and faster 
page turning. Like the original Kindle, it has a small keyboard and a 6-inch 
screen. The Kindle 2 also has built-in text-to-speech capability and an audio 
output jack, which can be used for headphones or speakers. So you can 
enjoy having books read to you, even if you’re in the dark, or want to listen 
while driving.
Amazon also offers the Kindle DX, a larger, heavier version with a 9.4-inch 
display. Almost twice as heavy, at 18.9 ounces, and more expensive than the 
Kindle 2, the DX is targeted at students and others requiring more robust 
graphics support and native support for PDF files (the Kindle and Kindle 2 
do not natively support PDF).
The Kindles uses a proprietary file format which includes DRM (digital rights 
management) capability to protect authors from having their works illegally 
distributed. The format is actually based on the open Mobipocket standard. 
The Kindle readers can also natively read Mobipocket formatted files. Many 
free eBooks are available as Mobipocket files.
Now that we understand a bit more about the various Kindles, keep reading 
to find out how to use them.
Reading on the Kindle 2
The Kindle 2 (Figure 6-1) is a compact device weighing just a shade over 
10 ounces. The 6-inch screen seems small at first, but it’s easy to read, and 
page turning is fairly quick.

The power switch on the Kindle 2 has two purposes. If you quickly flick it, 
the Kindle 2 is put into a very low power sleep mode. The sleep mode still 
uses a little power, but the Kindle 2 can still remain in suspended animation 
for weeks without a recharge — provided you’ve also disabled Whispernet.
	
If you leave Whispernet on while the Kindle 2 is in sleep mode, Kindle books 
you buy from www.Amazon.com will still download automatically, but bat­
tery life will be reduced.
If you move the power switch, but hold it for several seconds, the device 
completely powers down. If you do this while the system is powered off, it 
powers up.
You buy Kindle books from Amazon’s Web site. That’s the only place to buy 
currently published work in Kindle format. However, other sources of free — 
as in zero cost — books are available in Kindle or other recognized formats. 
See “Reading free eBooks” later in the chapter.
Reading on the Kindle 2

The Kindle home page simply consists of a list of books, with the most 
recently read books at the top, as in Figure 6-2. One of the best features of a 
Kindle book is the automatic bookmarking. Whenever you exit a book, the 
reader will remember the last page read. When you return to that book, you 
can take up reading where you left off.
Navigating the book list is simple. A little nub in the lower right, between the 
MENU and BACK buttons, behaves like a tiny four-way joystick. You can navi­
gate down the book list by moving the nub toward the bottom of the Kindle. 
Moving it right opens a book; moving it left asks you if you want to delete a 
book. You can also open the book by pressing the nub into the Kindle, like you 
would a mouse button. If you do delete a book, you can always re-download 
eBooks you own from Amazon at no charge.
If you have multiple pages of listings — something that’s easy to do if you 
buy more than a few books — the Next Page button will take you to the next 
part of the book list. The Prev Page button takes you back.

The Menu button has two functions. When you’re in the book list, you can 
search the Kindle, shop for books (shown in Figure 6-3), change settings, and 
peruse the Experimental section, which includes a crude Web browser, an 
MP3 player, and the text-to-speech function.
When you’re reading a book, the menu shows alternative navigation possibil­
ities, including creating custom bookmarks, looking at the table of contents, 
or even adding annotations to what you’re reading. Each note is marked in 
the book with a footnote-like number. One very useful feature in the in-book 
menu is the ability to change the text size, making it easier to read in dimmer 
light or if your eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be. See Figure 6-4.
You can also use the joystick nub to move a cursor through the text. Pausing 
over a word causes a brief definition of the nearest word at the bottom of 
the Kindle page. Pressing the return key takes you to the Kindle’s built-in 
dictionary, if you want a more detailed definition.

Every time you read a book, that book’s title pops up to the top of the 
book list.
That’s pretty much it. The Kindle 2 is an extremely simple device to use — 
another advantage of using a dedicated eBook reader rather than a small 
laptop.
Reading Blogs, Newspapers, and Magazines
In addition to books, other content is available for the Kindle 2, as shown in 
Figure 6-5. These include popular newspapers such as The New York Times, 
Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Le Monde (if you can read French), and 
Reading Blogs, Newspapers, and Magazines

many more. You pay a monthly subscription fee, which varies, depending on 
the publication. Color pictures are rendered in 16 shades of gray, so those 
don’t look as good. But a newspaper supports most of the book-reading fea­
tures, making reading easy and convenient.
Subscriptions to popular blogs, like boingboing.net, Slashdot, Gizmodo, and 
tons of other blogs, are also available. Unlike reading them for free on the 
Internet, you do pay a subscription fee, but it’s typically only $1.99 for the 
more popular blogs and less for others.
If blogs and newspapers are available, what about magazines? In fact, a wide 
array of magazines are available. Text-heavy magazines, like those special­
izing in fiction, work best, while art heavy magazines are probably best 
avoided unless you have a Kindle DX.

Reading eBooks for Free!
So you have your Kindle 2. If you’re like most first-time users, the ability to 
have hundreds of books in your backpack, purse, or messenger bag proba­
bly went to your head. You bought a bunch of books you’re meaning to read.
Then your credit card bill arrives. Ouch.
Luckily, you don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on Kindle books. A vast 
array of books are available for free in either the Kindle’s own format or the 
Mobipocket format, which the Kindle can natively display.
Amazon itself has a large number of free Kindle books. Most are in the public 
domain. For example, you can download most of William Shakespeare’s 
plays for free (though only one at a time — the collected works cost a little 
money). Similarly, other classic authors, ranging from Charles Dickens to 
Alexander Dumas to Jules Verne, are downloadable for no charge.
Another source of free books in Kindle format is manybooks.net (www.
manybooks.net.) There are many more sources, too numerous to mention, 
but you can find a unified list of free eBook sources for the Kindle at ireader­
review.com (http://ireaderreview.com/2008/01/19/free-books-
for-the-amazon-kindle/).
Amazon also has a large assortment of titles that are not quite-free. 
Numerous classic titles from the golden age of science fiction (1930–1960) 
are available for 99 cents, for example.
So you don’t need to bankrupt yourself in order to completely fill up your 
Kindle with more interesting books than you’ll be able to read in a lifetime.
Converting PDF Files for the Kindle
If that’s not enough, there are even more books available in Adobe Acrobat 
PDF format. Although the Kindle DX natively reads PDF format, the original 
Kindle and Kindle 2 do not. So how can you gain access to the staggering 
number of PDF books (and other PDF documents) for the Kindle?
Two utilities exist to convert PDF files. One is Mobipocket Creator, which 
can be downloaded for free personal use from the Mobipocket Web site 
(www.mobipocket.com). Mobipocket Creator doesn’t actually convert to 
Kindle’s .AZW format but converts to the open Mobipocket format, which 
the Kindle can read. Mobipocket is extremely flexible, allowing for substan­
tial tweaking of the final output, but it is also a bit difficult to use because of 
all the options that must be manually set.

Book VII 
Chapter 6
Exploring the Kindle
415
Converting PDF Files for the Kindle
Another free tool is Stanza (www.lexcycle.com/). Stanza runs on the Mac, 
Windows PCs, and the iPhone. It’s also a tool for reading and downloading 
eBooks. Converting files is very simple, but the formatting is sometimes odd.
With either Stanza or Creator, you need to connect your Kindle 2 to your PC 
or Mac. If it’s a Creator Mobipocket file, you copy it manually to the Kindle 2 
document folder. With Stanza, you export it to the correct folder.
By far the simplest way to convert PDF files to Kindle format is to use 
Amazon’s own “experimental” service. When you buy a Kindle 2, you register 
an e-mail address: yourname@kindle.com. You don’t have to worry about 
any settings, and the formatting usually looks correct.
If you take the PDF file (it must be a PDF file free of DRM protection) and 
e-mail it to yourname@kindle.com, you’ll get back a file in Kindle format, 
delivered to your Kindle through Whispernet. Amazon charges 10 cents for 
each conversion.
If you’re converting numerous, small files, 10 cents can add up pretty 
quickly. If you’re willing to connect your Kindle to your PC and manually 
download the file, you can use the Amazon service for free by e-mailing 
the PDF to yourname@free.kindle.com. Amazon e-mails the converted file 
back to your Amazon contact e-mail (the one you use for your Amazon.com 
account). You’ll have to manually download the file to your Kindle 2.
In the end, the Kindle line of eBook readers represents a new way of reading, 
coupling the benefits of a large, online book retailer with an eBook reader. 
That makes the process of buying and reading books substantially easier 
than previous readers. Much of that ease of use is due to the Kindle’s built-in 
wireless service. So, what are you waiting for?

very once in a while, the U.S. federal government gives its citizens — and 
sometimes the entire world — a gift. When the government financed, 
launched, and began running the Global Positioning System (GPS), it did just 
that: gifted us.
GPS is a system for finding your place anywhere in the world. As long as you 
have a fairly clear view of the sky, where the two dozen (or so) satellites 
orbit the Earth, you have a pretty good chance of getting a GPS reading and 
finding your way to where you want to go.
Its uses are almost limitless:
	
✦	 Navigate the roads, letting more advanced GPS receivers lead you along 
street by street. Some models even speak the directions so you can 
keep your eyes on the road and not on the receiver’s display. You also 
know which direction you’re traveling in and how fast you’re driving.
	
✦	 Find a remote fishing hole — and then find your way back to your car. 
You can even keep your favorite hot fishing spot a secret because with 
GPS you’ve no need to leave any sort of marker that might tip off other 
anglers.
	
✦	 Hike in the woods without getting lost. Or at least if you do get lost, 
your GPS receiver helps you get un-lost. It’s the modern version of 
Hansel and Gretel, but the bread crumbs in this case are virtual, dis­
played on your GPS receiver as waypoints.
	
✦	 Find a lost child who is wearing a GPS receiver on his or her wrist.
	
✦	 Run or jog and collect precise information about your workout.
	
✦	 Make an emergency call with your new GPS-equipped cell phone and 
help the 911 dispatcher locate you even if you aren’t sure of your pre­
cise location.

Knowing Where You Are
Where are you? I know you’re there because you’re reading this book. You 
have to be somewhere to do that. But where are you really? In precise terms.
I can tell you where I am in precise terms:
N 42.96506 W 085.92599 Elevation: 744 feet above sea level
That’s with an accuracy of about 30 feet. Just enough to throw off a stalker 
or an angry editor. (I’m just kidding about the stalker part.) In the next chap­
ter, I explain how to understand that reading, but for now I just want you to 
see how accurate GPS can be.
How’d I get this reading? By using a very inexpensive GPS receiver called the 
Garmin eTrex. It was a $79 Christmas gift. It doesn’t talk to me and doesn’t 
display any maps other than a very rudimentary one, but it’s enough to get a 
basic reading from the GPS system. Figure 1-1 shows the eTrex. You can find 
out more about Garmin GPS receivers at www.garmin.com.

Many other GPS receiver models do show quite detailed maps. For example,

receivers and mapping programs not only tell you where you are, but they 
can tell you the best route from where you are to where you want to go. 
Figure 1-2 shows the Sony NV-U44 GPS receiver that not only shows your 
current position but can also keep a log of where you’ve been for later play­
back. Furthermore, it can hold a bunch of photographs on an SD card and 
use its screen to show off your family memories.

Achieving Missile Precision — Almost
Do you have a chimney somewhere in the world at which you’d like the U.S. 
military to fire a long-distance missile? Using GPS, they can do it. Assuming 
all goes well, the missile will find the chimney, make a downward turn, and 
take a ride straight down. GPS is relatively new, although Santa Claus has 
been using a similar technique for years.
How the military uses GPS
How do you think the U.S. military makes those precision strikes during con­
frontations? Soldiers take a GPS reading of the target, transmit it to artillery 
and air forces, and get the heck out of the way. The GPS coordinates and 
very expensive ammunition do the rest — at least they do if no one in the 
area is using one of the GPS jammers available from Russia.
Achieving Missile Precision — Almost

422
The military has an advantage over civilian GPS users: It uses some addi­
tional information to gain even more precision in GPS readings. The infor­
mation is encrypted so that civilians — read: enemies — can’t get the same 
precision. The U.S. military uses GPS in its missiles, its tanks, and other 
ground and air resources, and probably in ways that if I knew about they’d 
have to kill me.
Civilians can find their way, too
The precision the U.S. military achieves when using GPS for its guidance sys­
tems isn’t quite as precise when a civilian uses the service. It’s close enough 
for finding a fishing hole or navigating your way out of the woods, though.
The difference is so small, at least from a civilian perspective, that if I gave 
you the GPS coordinates for my front door, you might wind up at my back 
door — just enough precision to foil enemies without harming hapless 
hikers lost in the woods.
	
Actually, even civilian GPS receivers can have extremely precise measure­
ments using a system known as Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS). This 
system relies upon ground-based transmitters whose position is very precisely 
known. These transmitters broadcast a signal that is matched with the satellite-
transmitted GPS signal so that the normal positioning errors are reduced to 
such an insignificant degree that a WAAS-enabled system can be used to land an 
airplane in zero-visibility conditions. The WAAS system currently is only avail­
able in North America, but WAAS-enabled GPS receivers provide normal GPS 
accuracy even when they’re used in areas where WAAS isn’t available.
	
Most GPS receivers enable you to monitor the current signal to determine 
how accurately your position is being reported. Typically this information is 
reported using the following values:
Being selective
On May 1, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed an 
order turning off the Selective Availability fea­
ture of the GPS system. Selective Availability 
was designed to degrade the GPS signal that 
was received by nonmilitary users so that 
the location information provided by civilian 
GPS units would be less precise than that 
of military GPS receivers. The U.S. military 
still has the ability to use a similar Selective 
Deniability feature in war zones or when there 
is a global terror alert, but this feature is tar­
geted at specific areas rather than affecting 
all civilian users worldwide. See the article on 
GPS at wordiQ.com (www.wordiq.com/
definition/Global_Positioning_
System) for more information on GPS 
precision.

✦	 PDOP (Position Dilution Of Precision): A number representing the 
relationship between the error in user position and the error in satellite 
position using three coordinates. Smaller values are better.
	
✦	 HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision): A number similar to PDOP, 
but relating only to your horizontal position.
	
✦	 EHPE (Expected Horizontal Position Error): The error in horizontal 
position, which you can assume under current conditions. For example, 
Figure 1-3 shows that the GPS receiver is probably accurate to within 
about 27 feet when I captured the image.

Using GPS
What can you do with GPS and its receiver? As the list at the beginning of 
this chapter shows, the number of ways to take advantage of this free ser­
vice are numerous. Here I go into detail on a few of the more popular uses.
Taking a hike
A GPS receiver is a must-have accessory for the outdoor types among you. It 
helps get you to where you want to go like a map cannot and prevents panic 
when all of those trees start looking alike.
	
Still, as my Garmin manual cautions, it’s important to carry an old-fashioned 
compass and map with you whenever you hike in new territory. If your bat­
teries die or the trees prevent you from getting a good lock on the satellite 
signals, your GPS receiver isn’t much help. Also, if you’re trekking into some 
back country or there’s a possibility that the weather might turn sour, be 
sure to tell someone where you’re planning on going so they know where to 
start looking for you if you don’t return when you told them you’d be back.
Achieving Missile Precision — Almost

424
If I was an outdoors person, and I’m not (although I do go outside to get the 
daily mail), I would buy one of the fancy, new two-way radios that combine a 
communications transceiver with a GPS receiver. I discuss these in Book VI, 
Chapter 3, which is about Family Radio Service and other two-way radios.
On the road again
I have a horrible time getting to new destinations. Actually, I have a horrid 
time finding places I’ve already visited, too. I don’t know how many times 
I’ve driven to some strange city and found myself in the less glamorous parts 
of town rather than where I should be, safely in my friend’s driveway.
GPS to the rescue!
Instead of relying on memory and getting all of those numbered highways 
mixed up in my head, I can rely on a GPS receiver to provide turn-by-turn 
directions. I tell the receiver where I’m going — it knows where I am, of 
course — and it tracks my direction and speed and lets me know when it’s 
time to make a turn onto another highway or road.
If you’re hungry on the way, some advanced models can tell you where the 
nearest restaurant is located. The DeLorme Street Atlas programs include infor­
mation on literally thousands of points of interest including restaurants, gas sta­
tions, parks, campgrounds, and so on to make your trip far more enjoyable.
On a bike ride
It might not seem obvious at first, but a portable GPS receiver (or a PDA with 
a GPS accessory receiver) can be a wonderful addition for your bicycle. This 
is especially true if you set off on a road trip, but even mountain bikers can 
appreciate the way that a GPS receiver helps them find the trail in rugged 
back country.
If you do decide to bring along your GPS receiver on your bike, keep in mind 
that a bike presents something of a challenge to fragile electronic gear. Your 
local bike shop can probably supply a strong handlebar mount for the GPS 
receiver, but you may also want to shop carefully for a GPS receiver that’s 
rated for rugged use.
It’s a bird, no, it really is a plane
Private pilots travel in a world where the ordinary landmarks simply look a 
whole lot different than they do from ground level. It’s awfully hard to read 
road signs from several thousand feet in the air, so getting a little extra help 
in determining exact position is really important to a pilot.
GPS technology has become a very important tool for pilots over the past 
several years. Products like Anywhere Map from Control Vision (www.
controlvision.com) have simply revolutionized the general aviation

world because they’ve made it possible for virtually every flyer to realize the 
benefits of GPS mapping at a fraction of what it would have cost even a few 
years ago.
Just for fun
In the next chapter I talk about two other fun uses of GPS: finding goodies in 
a hobby called geocaching and finding your ancestors and their haunts in 
genealogy. I just mention them here briefly so you can decide whether you 
want to read more details in the next chapter.
Geocaching
By using your wits and a cheap GPS receiver, you can participate in some­
thing called geocaching. It’s really a high-tech treasure hunt. The treasure, 
or cache, is usually inexpensive items, but the fun is in the chase. With coor­
dinates in hand, you can drive to nearby locations, finding your way to the 
cache with GPS receiver in one hand and perhaps a can of bug spray in the 
other.
Genealogy
The use of GPS technology is just starting to catch on in the hobby of gene­
alogy, which is the search for your family roots. With a GPS receiver, you 
can make the drive to old family homesteads easier and even find relatives’ 
graves. Instead of requiring other researchers to retrace your steps on their 
own, you can provide precise GPS coordinates to make their hunt for family 
information and physical remnants easier.
Exploring Your Options
A wide variety of GPS receivers are available in all kinds of styles and with 
different levels of features. What you buy mostly depends on what its main 
use is, because a hiker’s GPS receiver must be much smaller than one meant 
to rest on your vehicle dashboard.
Choosing a portable unit
When choosing a portable unit, these are some of your choices:
	
✦	 Magellan at www.magellangps.com/en/
	
✦	 Garmin at www.garmin.com
	
✦	 Cobra at www.cobra.com
Each of these manufacturers offers an assortment of models aimed at dif­
ferent types of users. You probably want to look at several different GPS

receivers before choosing because the extra features that are included in 
the slightly more expensive models can greatly improve the convenience of 
using a portable unit.
	
If you intend to use your portable GPS receiver with your laptop PC, be sure 
to buy a unit that includes the necessary cables or adapters. These are typi­
cally not included with the least expensive models.
Driving around with a vehicle GPS unit
In the car, you have lots of options for using GPS, but don’t pay it so much 
attention that it turns you into a reckless, dangerous, inattentive driver:
	
✦	 You can buy a new car that has a fancy built-in navigation system. This 
is by far the most expensive option, of course, but it’s the only one 
that’s guaranteed to impress the neighbors (or make your boss start 
wondering if you’re being paid too much). Built-in navigation systems 
often have a hidden cost your dealer may “forget” to mention, though. 
In most cases you need to buy expensive map add-ons if you want maps 
for the entire country.
	
✦	 If you like the idea of a built-in GPS navigation system but aren’t in the 
market for a new car, the manufacturers of portable GPS receivers offer 
aftermarket units that can be added to your existing car. While these 
might not have quite the panache of a factory-installed GPS navigation 
system, they’re a lot more affordable, and you can move them to a new 
vehicle in the future.
	
✦	 You can also use a Bluetooth or another GPS receiver with a laptop PC 
and carry it along in your car. This option is far less expensive than 
the other two vehicle options I mentioned, and it has one feature that 
trumps both of them in a big way — the laptop PC’s screen is far bigger 
than that on any built-in vehicle GPS system. In addition, GPS mapping 
software for your laptop is far less expensive to update, so it’s far easier 
on your wallet when you want to know about the newer roads.
	
✦	 If you want the small size of a portable GPS receiver but you also want 
most of the advanced mapping options available with laptop PC GPS 
mapping software, you might want to consider pairing up a GPS receiver 
with a PDA. I talk about using a GPS receiver with a PDAPDA shortly, but 
this is an excellent choice in many cases.
	
No matter what type of GPS navigation system you use in a vehicle, it can be 
very dangerous to you and everyone else on the road if you don’t take the 
time to get to know the unit before you begin driving. In fact, unless the GPS 
navigation system uses voice prompts to tell you when and where to turn, 
it’s far safer to have a passenger handle the navigation duties than to try to 
watch the screen while you’re driving.

Merging your laptop with GPS
I’ve already mentioned how you can use your laptop PC for navigation in 
your vehicle. This is a very popular option among RV owners because they 
usually have plenty of room for the laptop and at least one passenger who 
can handle the navigation while driving. In addition, GPS mapping software 
for laptops generally includes the locations of RV parks so you may not need 
a big, printed RV park directory.
Another way to use GPS with your laptop is to combine your search for Wi-Fi 
hotspots, which I discuss in another chapter, with GPS. Using your laptop, 
you can drive around, essentially mapping hotspot locations. To aid in this 
quest, you may want to download a trial version of WiNc from Cirond (www.
cirond.com/winc.html). This extremely handy program quickly identifies all 
Wi-Fi connections within an area and helps you determine if you can con­
nect to them. Cirond even offers a PDA version called pocketWiNc, shown in 
Figure 1-4.

Using GPS with a PDA
I’ve mentioned several times that a PDA and a GPS receiver make an excel­
lent pairing. With the two, you have most of the size advantages of stand­
alone portable GPS receivers and a whole raft of capabilities that you won’t 
find in most portable GPS units. (You may want to pick up a copy of iPAQ 
For Dummies or PDA For Dummies — both written by Brian Underdahl and 
published by Wiley Publishing — to read more about what you can do with 
a PDA.)
Using GPS with a PDA

428
Saying Goodbye to AAA
Because different PDA models offer different expansion options, you’ll find 
several types of GPS receivers that work with various PDAs. I recommend 
checking out the products that are available from the following:
	
✦	 DeLorme at www.delorme.com
	
✦	 Sony at www.sony.com
	
✦	 Teletype at www.teletype.com
	
✦	 PocketMapStore at www.pocketmapstore.com
	
✦	 ALK Technologies at www.alk.com
In each case you should specify the type of PDA you own so you can get the 
proper GPS receiver.
	
GPS maps can eat up a lot of memory on a PDA. If you don’t already have a 
PDA, try to get one with built-in Bluetooth, so you can use the expansion slot 
for a memory card to hold your maps.
Using a GPS-enabled cell phone or smartphone
Nextel has a service called TeleNav that provides audible driving directions, 
automatic notification when you’ve gone off course, and locations of nearby 
businesses like gas stations and restaurants. You can read more at www. 
nextel.com/about/enterprise/wbs/gps/navigate.shtml. Other 
carriers have similar services. Visit your carrier’s Web site or call to see if 
they sell any GPS-enabled phones.
One very popular phone with a GPS integrated is, of course, the Apple 
iPhone. In fact, my doctor often brags to me while I’m lying on his table 
that he and his daughter went hiking in some backwater area of the United 
Kingdom, and when they got lost, she whipped out her iPhone and led them 
home. My doctor is an interesting fellow.
Saying Goodbye to AAA
	
Even though GPS devices rule so thoroughly, I recommend you don’t take 
AAA or any other paper map out of the loop just yet, especially when you’re 
using a GPS unit in the car. There’s still the chance the map data you upload 
is not up to date, that your batteries will go dead, or that you’ll have some 
other technical problem. Having a map gets you to the Grand Canyon long 
after your GPS receiver stops working. If you’re hiking, a compass and a map 
are essential, even if you have the best GPS receiver available. In that case, 
your life is possibly at stake, and you don’t want to rely on an electronic 
gizmo to get you out of the woods and back home.

Making a Connection with Your PC
	
GPS mapping programs for laptop PCs generally offer the option to print out 
both ordinary maps and those that show your selected route. These printed 
copies can serve as an excellent backup for your GPS unit and save you a 
trip to the auto club office.
Making a Connection with Your PC
There are quite a few reasons why I think you’ll find that having a connec­
tion between your GPS receiver and your PC awfully handy. Examine a few 
of them.
Upgrading software and maps
As I mentioned in the previous section, once you move beyond the most 
basic portable GPS receivers, you quickly get into units that display maps 
rather than simply numbers to indicate your position. You may have 
noticed, however, that maps have a certain amount of obsolescence built 
in. For some reason people want to build new roads, change the course of 
old ones, or even just rename existing roads. That’s one reason many GPS 
receivers offer the option to connect to your PC — so you can update the 
maps in the GPS receiver.
Downloading your life’s movements
Virtually all GPS units can store some record of where they’ve been. By 
downloading this tracking information to your PC, you can map out the 
route you took in getting somewhere. Here are some possible uses for this 
type of information:
	
✦	 Imagine how useful it would be to be able to print out maps of the trail 
to some hidden but beautiful picnic spot so that you could share those 
maps with your friends.
	
✦	 If you have a consulting business where you must visit your client’s loca­
tions, you could use your GPS track to justify the travel expenses you 
bill to the customers or that you claim on your tax returns.
	
✦	 Because the GPS track also includes information about the speed of travel, 
you might try to beat an unwarranted speeding ticket by convincing a 
judge that the GPS track is an accurate representation of how you were 
driving. I don’t think I’d bet on that working, but you’re welcome to try. 
(Just don’t blame me if the judge throws the book at you — remember, I’m 
not offering anything resembling legal advice here.)
	
✦	 You could put your GPS receiver in your car before you let your teen­
ager drive to the library and remind him or her that the unit tracks both 
speed and location. Who knows? It might just make your kid drive a bit 
more carefully.

Making a Connection with Your PC
Using your GPS with your laptop
Don’t you just love it when you can get the best of both worlds out of a 
product? Well, when it comes to GPS, it’s entirely possible for you to do so. 
There’s no reason why you can’t buy a small, portable GPS receiver that’s 
perfect for taking on hikes and then connect that same GPS receiver to your 
laptop PC to use with the far more comprehensive PC-based GPS mapping 
software for trip navigation in your vehicle.
Sure, you probably have to buy a portable GPS receiver that’s slightly above 
the bottom of the line, but virtually any of the portable units that include a 
PC connection cable as standard equipment can likely do the job. (You can 
check the PC-based GPS mapping software manufacturer’s Web site to verify 
if a particular portable GPS unit is considered compatible.)
	
GPS receivers work the best in vehicles when the receiver has a clear view of 
the sky. The optimal location in most cars is at the front of the dashboard as 
close to the windshield as possible. A small piece of rubberized drawer liner 
(like you find in the housewares section at your local store) goes a long way 
toward preventing the GPS receiver from sliding around as you drive.

Way in the World
In This Chapter

✓	Coordinating your coordinates

I
n the preceding chapter, I give you an overview of the global positioning 
system (GPS). Hopefully, that chapter gives you a good understanding 
of what GPS is, how you can use it, and how to pick a GPS receiver. It also 
shows you a number of different options to fit different circumstances so 
you also realize that GPS isn’t something just for a few dedicated hobbyists.
Now I’m going to take you to the next step, which is understanding how to 
read a GPS display. Most importantly, I give you a quick lesson in longitude, 
latitude, and related mapping terms so you know what your GPS receiver 
is telling you. You probably learned most of this in school, but if you’re like 
me, you slept through most of it.
Still, while this information is interesting, it’s more important to understand 
your GPS receiver so you can figure out how to get found when you’ve 
become lost. After all, it’s unlikely a latitude and longitude reading will help 
much when you’re lost in the middle of, say, the Adirondack National Park 
without any idea of how you got to wherever it is you are.
Giving Some Latitude to Your Longitude
Maybe you remember latitude and longitude from geography class, maybe 
you don’t. It’s an international way to indicate your location in the world. I 
don’t think in international terms too much, though, so let’s take a few min­
utes to review what latitude and longitude mean.
Figure 2-1 shows a world map divided by latitude and longitude lines. If you 
know the latitude and longitude values of any location on the planet, you 
can use those values to find that location on the map.
A GPS receiver does its magic by listening to signals from the GPS satellites and 
then tells you where you stand, also in the geographic sense, by determining 

432
your precise latitude and longitude. In fact, that’s how a GPS receiver is able to 
display your location on a map. It simply takes your latitude and longitude num­
bers and figures out where that position is on the map.

A Quick Course on Mapping
This isn’t a book on mapping or geography or even GPS, so this is a very 
short introduction to the three things you should know about: latitude, 
longitude, and elevation. Even so, this basic information should enable you 
to begin using your GPS receiver for simple navigation. It also helps you 
remember a few easily confusing facts.
A bit of simple geometry
Okay, you knew this was coming, didn’t you? Yes, it’s necessary to have just 
a brief review of geometry to make certain that we’re all speaking the same 
language:
	
✦	 When you divide a circle into degrees, there are 360 degrees in a com­
plete circle.
	
✦	 Both latitude and longitude are measured in degrees, which is often 
shown using the ° symbol.
	
✦	 For the purposes of navigation, the Earth is considered to be essentially 
round. Flat Earth societies don't have a leg to stand on.
	
✦	 Because latitude and longitude both indicate a position on a round 
planet, the total number of degrees around the Earth in either latitude 
or longitude is 360 (even though, as you discover shortly, the values are 
expressed a bit differently, they do add up to 360).
	
✦	 Fractions of degrees are measured in minutes, with 60 minutes in 1 
degree. The symbol for minutes is '. Don't get geometrical minutes mixed 
up with temporal minutes.
A Quick Course on Mapping

Book VIII
Chapter 2

433
	
✦	 Likewise, fractions of minutes are measured in seconds, with 60 sec­
onds in a minute. The symbol for seconds is ". That's to further confuse 
people who use the clock on their GPS devices.
	
✦	 Sometimes, though, fractions of degrees are expressed using decimal 
values rather than minutes and seconds. The results are the same, 
but just a bit of math is involved in converting between the two. For 
example, 39 degrees and 30 minutes could also be shown as 39.5 degrees 
(because 30 minutes is one-half of a degree). It could also be shown as 
39° 30'.
That wasn’t too bad, was it? Now that you’ve got the simple geometry out of 
the way, see how it applies to latitude and longitude.
Latitude
The lines of latitude run east and west around the globe. The equator is basi­
cally a line of latitude. Latitude is shown as degrees north in the Northern 
Hemisphere and as degrees south in the Southern Hemisphere. Starting at 
the equator, which is zero, when you go north, the north latitude rises to 90 
degrees when you reach the North Pole. When you go south of the equator, 
the south latitude reaches 90 degrees when you hit the South Pole.
So, for example, Reno, Nevada, is located at approximately 39 degrees and 30 
minutes north latitude, while Los Angeles, California, is at about 34 degrees 
north latitude. From these two values you can tell that Reno is farther north 
than Los Angeles — and that’s without looking at a map.
Longitude
The imaginary lines of longitude run north and south. The zero-degrees 
longitude line runs through Greenwich, England, which is called the prime 
meridian. If you went west of the prime meridian and a friend went east, 
you’d eventually meet up at the International Date Line. You would go 180 
degrees in both directions. (Remember how I told you the numbers would 
add up to 360?)
In the Eastern Hemisphere, the longitude is given as degrees east. In the 
Western Hemisphere, longitude is given as degrees west. You may also see 
west longitude expressed as a negative value. That is, W119° is the same 
as –119°.
Going back to the earlier example, you find that Reno is at about W119° 50’ 
while Los Angeles is approximately W118° 15’. Hey, wait a minute! That puts 
Reno west of Los Angeles, doesn’t it? Well, yes it does, and that’s exactly 
why understanding a little bit of geometry is so important. (Go ahead, look 
on a map and you see that Reno actually is farther west than Los Angeles — 
you can win a bar bet with this one.)
A Quick Course on Mapping

434
Elevation
Elevation is basically the distance you’re standing above the level of the 
world’s oceans, called sea level. If you’re on a high mountain, you’re obvi­
ously at an elevation much higher than sea level.
When using a GPS, you must receive signals from a fourth satellite to mea­
sure your elevation. You only need three visible satellites if all you need is 
your two-dimensional position in the world. GPS receivers typically display 
2D to indicate a two-dimensional fix and 3D to indicate a three-dimensional 
fix. A fix is simply the navigational term for knowing your precise location.
Coordinating Your Coordinates
Latitude lines are always parallel to the equator and to each other. 
Longitude lines, however, are not really parallel to each other because they 
meet at the north and south poles.
One important result regarding the difference between latitude and longi­
tude lines is that a one-degree change of latitude is always equal to the same 
distance (ignoring elevation differences, of course), but a one-degree change 
of longitude varies. Look at how this can be:
	
✦	 Going directly north or south changes your latitude but not your lon­
gitude. One degree of latitude change equals just about 70 miles. You 
could figure out the circumference of the Earth and divide that by 360 to 
verify this, but your number comes pretty close if you do.
	
✦	 Going one degree east or west at the equator changes your longitude 
but not your latitude. Again, if you’re at the equator, one degree of lon­
gitude change is also about 70 miles (because the Earth is round, so the 
circumference around the equator is virtually the same as it is on one of 
the longitude lines).
	
✦	 Now, to blow your mind. Imagine that you are standing exactly at the 
north pole. Take one step south (that’s any direction from where you 
are). That places you about 3 feet away from the north pole. If you stay 
the same distance out and walk all the way around the pole, you’ll go 
about 20 feet. But that 20 feet brought you all the way around the world 
so you traveled through 360 degrees of longitude! A little math tells you 
that one degree of longitude change here is a bit less than an inch. How 
can this be? Well, the latitude lines are parallel (running east and west, 
remember), so the circles going entirely around the world are much 
shorter than they are at the equator. Because the longitude lines all 
meet at the poles, each of them is exactly the same length.

435
It’s easy to see how this could be confusing, so aren’t you glad that your GPS 
receiver does all of the math for you? And aren’t you glad that I went to the 
north pole to do the measurements so you wouldn’t have to?
Explaining How GPS Works
I’m not an engineer or anything close, but I think I can describe in simple 
terms how the GPS system works. It’s not like it’s — well, actually, in this 
case it really is — rocket science, but the general idea is fairly easy to 
understand.
Imagine for a moment that you have found three posts pounded into the 
ground in a triangular pattern somewhere in your yard. One day you’re 
down at the library, and you come across some historical records that men­
tion that the town recluse used to live on your property and that before he 
died he told someone that he had buried some treasure exactly 100 feet from 
the posts. Can you figure out where to dig without ruining all of the land­
scaping you’ve so carefully added to your yard?
Actually, that’s a pretty simple problem because there’s only one solution. 
If you tie a 100-foot string to each post and then see where the three ends 
meet, you’ve found the spot because there is no other place that’s exactly 
100 feet from all of the posts (as shown in Figure 2-2).
The GPS system works something like those three strings. Of course, it 
uses satellites instead of posts, but using several satellites, it can determine 
where you are, as you see in Figure 2-3. The rocket scientists figured out how 
to calculate the precise position of each GPS satellite, all of which are in geo­
synchronous orbit, at each point in time, and they know that radio signals 
travel at the speed of light, so throw in a little fancy math, and bingo!
Now, it takes not three, but four GPS satellites to fix your location. That’s 
because you need one more measurement than the number of dimensions to 
rule out multiple positions in the remaining dimension. Get it?
In the example of using three strings to find the buried treasure in your yard, 
you assumed that where the three strings touched the ground was where 
the treasure was buried. If you held onto those three strings and raised them 
up above the ground, you would find that they would still meet, even if you 
held them above your head. The same thing happens with the GPS satellite 
signals, but once you add a fourth signal there’s only one point that can be 
your location.

Figure 2-4 shows an example of how a GPS receiver shows a display of the 
satellites that are being tracked. In this case the display symbols indicate that 
four satellites are being used for navigation, and the 3D indicator near the 
upper right of the display tells you that the unit has a 3D fix. GPS receivers

often have more satellites in view than are being used for navigation simply 
because the data from some of the satellites might not be coming through reli­
ably enough for navigation purposes.

Reading a GPS Display
I own a Sony NV-U44 GPS device, but these examples are from my old Garmin 
eTrex GPS receiver. Like most modern GPS receivers, you can choose how 
to display your coordinates. That is, you can choose degrees, minutes, and 
seconds or you can opt for degrees and decimal fractions.
For example, my location in a digital format, according to the display on my 
GPS receiver, is this:
N 42.96506 W 085.92599
Using the degrees, minutes, and seconds display, the following represents 
the same location:
42° 57’ 54.4” N 85° 55’ 33.6” W
That means I’m in the Northern and Western hemispheres. To be exact, I’m 
in this location:
42 degrees, 57 minutes, and 54.4 seconds north of the equator
85 degrees, 55 minutes, and 33.6 seconds west of the prime meridian
Reading a GPS Display

438
That puts me in West Michigan. If you look at the digital equivalent of my 
location you can see how the 42 degrees, 57 minutes, and 54.4 seconds were 
simply converted to 42.96506:
N 42.96506 W 085.92599
The same was done with the second half of the coordinates. It’s 57 minutes 
of one way and 0.96 of the other. In other words, they’re the same coordi­
nates, just expressed differently.
That’s important to know because you may see coordinates expressed one 
way, but your GPS receiver may be set to display them another way. Usually, 
you can make a quick conversion to the coordinates of your choice by going 
into your receiver’s setup menu and selecting Units or something similar.
Figure 2-5 shows how a GPS receiver display might look using the degrees 
and decimal degrees option, and Figure 2-6 shows the display when the 
degrees, minutes, and seconds option is selected. Note that these two read­
ings do not show precisely the same location.
	
Figure 2-5: 
The GPS 
receiver is 
displaying 
coordinates 
using 
degrees 
and decimal 
degrees.
	
Due to rounding errors, you may not get precisely the same values when you 
try to convert between the two types of display. It’s always best to pick one 
method and stick with it to avoid these types of errors.
Figure 2-7 shows one very good reason why you may prefer to use a GPS 
receiver that displays your position on a map rather than using latitude and 
longitude coordinates. I don’t know about you, but it’s a lot easier for me 
to determine my location by looking at the map display than by reading the 
coordinate display.

Finding Your Waypoints
Waypoints are the essence of basic GPS navigation. At the simplest level 
waypoints are just the various points along the route between where you are 
and where you want to go. Even if you’ve never used a GPS receiver before, 
you’ve certainly used waypoints — you probably just didn’t use that name 
for them.
Understanding how waypoints work
To understand how waypoints work, consider the following set of directions:
Finding Your Waypoints

440
	
1.	 Take Highway 395 south to the junction of Highway 341.
	
2.	 Turn left on Highway 341.
	
3.	 Turn left at the intersection with Cartwright Road.
Those directions seem clear enough, don’t they? Well, waypoints work 
pretty much the same way except that waypoints are often indicated using 
geographical coordinates in place of the names or numbers of roads or other 
physical objects. In fact, that same set of directions could be expressed 
using two waypoints (because the directions tell you to turn in two places) 
as in the following:
	
1.	 Go to N39° 24’ 10.1”, W119° 44’ 46”.
	
2.	 Go to N39° 21’ 59.1”, W119° 39’ 59”.
	
3.	 Turn left.
Although it’s true that both sets of directions get you to the same place, the 
directions that use waypoints offer one distinct advantage over the direc­
tions that use highway names and numbers. Can you spot the important 
difference? The first set of directions is pretty useless without additional 
information — such as an assumed starting point. The sets of directions 
using waypoints need no other details because anyone with a GPS receiver 
can follow them, no matter where the trip began.
Even though this example only uses two waypoints, that doesn’t mean that 
you necessarily want to set off on a cross-country hike directly between 
the two waypoints. You might find a number of obstacles in your path that 
prevent that sort of straight-line approach. If you use a GPS receiver that dis­
plays maps, you might want to choose the option to create a route that uses 
roads rather than to create a direct route. (The method for choosing this 
varies according to the type of GPS receiver you use.) But even if you choose 
the direct route option, your GPS receiver shows you the distance and direc­
tion to your next waypoint, just as you see in Figure 2-8. This means that 
if you have to navigate around a steep hill, a lake, or even a large building, 
your GPS receiver shows you how to reach the waypoint.
Creating waypoints
You can create your own waypoints a number of ways. The precise methods 
depend on your particular GPS receiver, of course, but generally you’ll prob­
ably find that you have at least some of these options available:
	
✦	 Enter waypoints manually by entering latitude and longitude coordi­
nates before you set out with your GPS receiver. This method requires 
that you know the coordinates, of course, but it allows you to set very 
accurate waypoints.
Finding Your Waypoints

Book VIII 
Chapter 2
Finding Your Way  
in the World
441
	
✦	 The manual process may also be as simple as clicking points on an 
on-screen map. This generally won’t be quite as accurate as entering 
specific latitude and longitude values, but it’s far more convenient.
	
✦	 Most GPS receivers allow you to manually set waypoints at your current 
location. This method is very handy if you’re out for a walk in a strange 
city and want to be sure that you can find the way back to your starting 
point.
	
✦	 Many GPS receivers offer an automatic tracking option. Typically, this 
option creates waypoints at specific time intervals so you can later play 
back a record of your travels. If you use this option it’s a good idea to 
learn how to set the recording interval. That way, you can set a value 
appropriate to your mode of travel — shorter intervals for vehicular 
travel and longer intervals when you’re on foot.
	
Portable GPS receivers typically have a limited amount of available memory. 
If you set the recording interval too short you can lose your earlier recorded 
waypoints when the memory becomes full. As you can imagine, this could 
make it difficult for you to backtrack in unfamiliar terrain.
The popularity of GPS receivers has generated a whole new hobby — 
exchanging lists of useful and interesting waypoints. Web sites such as GPS 
Waypoint Registry (www.waypoint.org) are dedicated to collecting and 
sharing lists of these waypoints.
This chapter has helped you understand a bit more about how to use your 
GPS receiver. Although there wasn’t room for an entire course on the finer 
points of GPS usage, I’m sure that you’re far more comfortable about how 
you can use your GPS receiver to get from where you are to where you want

Book VIII: The Global Positioning System

Chapter 3: Exploring with 
the Rest of GPS
In This Chapter
✓	Exploring geocaching
✓	Using GPS to find cemeteries
✓	Finding your ancestors’ homesteads
A
 popular hobby called geocaching uses your GPS receiver to track 
down plots of small prizes hidden around the globe. GPS stands for 
Global Positioning System, and it can be used for more than simply finding 
your way out of the forest.
The second use is a more practical one. You can use GPS coordinates in 
genealogy research, both for finding cemeteries (and even specific grave­
stones) and your ancestors’ old homesteads, schools, churches, and other 
sites.
Seeking and Hiding with Geocaching
GPS is not only about using the technological equivalent of bread crumbs to 
find your way out of the forest. It also helps provide the basic navigational 
tools for geocaching, helping you pinpoint within feet the location of hidden 
caches that others have left for you to find.
When you’ve mastered the seeking, you may want to try the hiding part. 
You can create your own caches, maybe right in your backyard, that others 
can seek. There are even groups and Web sites dedicated to this hobby. 
Here are some popular geocaching Web sites:
	
✦	 www.geocaching.com
	
✦	 www.navicache.com
	
✦	 www.terracaching.com
	
✦	 www.earthcache.com
Check these out, lurk in their communities, and see which one is most 
exciting for you.

Nabbing the cache
Given the choice, you probably would rather nab cash. But geocaching leads 
to its own treasures, many of them you keep while others you take to the 
next cache location and exchange for something else. You can do this on 
and on, traveling across the United States and other countries (but mind the 
oceans, lest you find yourself with some wet cache).
For those who love technology, the outdoors, and a good quest, it’s a perfect 
hobby. It’s a little like a modern-day version of scouting, where you might 
have earned an orienteering badge for your skills with a map and compass. 
Now you’re using your map, compass, and GPS navigational skills. You can 
do it with friends and family; you breathe the clean air of mostly remote 
areas and improve your navigational skills for the day you might need them. 
(On the other hand, staying inside is safer and dryer. But I’m assuming you 
like the outdoors.)
In most instances the hidden caches are tucked away in a hidden location in 
a public place. Don’t expect to be digging for buried treasure in someone’s 
yard — if you do, you’re probably looking in the wrong place, and you’re 
likely to get arrested, to boot.
You don’t need an expensive GPS receiver for geocaching. An inexpensive 
model that’s $75 or even less is enough to get you going. Later, if you want 
a better GPS receiver that allows you to carry pictures and music and stuff, 
you always can spend a little more money ($150 to $200) for an advanced 
model. See Book VIII, Chapter 1, for more information about your options in 
buying a GPS receiver.
Having fun shouldn’t lead to forgetting about 
good old common sense. Consider these things 
before heading off:
	✓	 Travel in pairs.
	✓	 Let someone know where you’re going if 
you go out to look or hide a cache.
	✓	 Carry ID, water, and a flashlight if you’re 
hiking.
	✓	 Make sure you get permissions to hide a 
cache on property if it’s not yours.
	✓	 Make sure you know what the park rules 
are for hiding things.
	✓	 Follow your instincts, and don’t do some­
thing if your gut is saying not to.

You can find nearby caches by searching on the one of the Web sites listed 
above. At most such sites, you can search by ZIP code, state, country, and 
other variables. Once you find a cache you want to find, www.geocaching.
com, for example, has some suggestions for hunting it down:
	
✦	 Research the cache location. Buy a topographical map for remote 
cache locations. Use services like Google Maps (maps.google.com) or 
MapQuest (www.mapquest.com) to get driving directions for more 
easily accessible ones. Google Maps even has street level views of many 
locations, so you can familiarize yourself with the terrain in advance.
	
✦	 If you’re familiar with the area, navigate there using mostly the readings 
from your GPS unit. The site www.geocaching.com doesn’t recommend 
this for first-time hunters. However, you may need to use a combination 
of all three strategies to find a cache. Bringing along a compass is a good 
idea, too.
	
✦	 Drive as close to the cache location as you can. When you get within 
300 feet, check your GPS receiver’s margin of error. It could be between 
25 and 200 feet. The smaller the error, the more you can rely on your 
receiver’s reading. For the last 30 feet or so, circle the area to find the 
cache. For higher error rates, the circle is larger.
	
✦	 When you find the cache, at least write your name in the enclosed log 
book. If you want to take an item from the cache and replace it with 
another, that’s great, too. This is all done under the honor system, of 
course. You’re not supposed to find the cache, take all the loot, and run 
off for an early retirement.
	
✦	 When you leave your car, mark a waypoint on your GPS receiver. This 
way, you can find your way back to the car. Otherwise, you may need 
to wait for the next person who finds the cache, so they can lead you 
back to civilization. (For more information on waypoints, see Book VIII, 
Chapter 2.)
Hiding the bounty
Once you have mastered the art and science of geocaching, you may want to 
try your hand at hiding your very own cache.
As for goodies, you can put just about anything in your cache. Yes, even 
cash — which would make you a very popular person indeed on the geo­
caching circuit! Many caches contain inexpensive toys, CDs, and any other 
knickknacks you can imagine and that fit into the container used in the 
Seeking and Hiding with Geocaching

446
cache. Some people even include one-time-use cameras, asking all the find­
ers to take a photo of themselves (and, of course, then leave the camera for 
the cacher).
The site www.geocaching.com makes these recommendations for hiding 
your own cache:
	
✦	 Research the location. Look for someplace that may require some 
hiking, rather than an easy-to-find place close to well-traveled areas 
where someone may discover the cache accidentally.
	
✦	 Prepare your cache. Your best bet is a waterproof container. You can 
place the actual items inside sealable plastic bags like those you use 
for sandwiches. Include a log book (small spiral notebook) and pen or 
pencil so seekers can record their find. Consider including a goodie that 
finders can take with them, and asking them to leave something behind, 
via a note in the cache container.
	
✦	 Hide the goods. This is where you use your GPS receiver. Get the cache’s 
coordinates by taking a waypoint reading. For better accuracy, you 
should average the waypoints. If you’re using a low-end GPS model, this 
may require taking a waypoint up to ten times — you take a waypoint 
and then walk away, returning to do another one — and then finding the 
average waypoint measurement. This average is what you write on your 
container and in the log book, keeping a copy for the next cache you find.
	
✦	 Leave a note. Figure 3-1 shoes a typical geocache note.
	
✦	 Report the cache. This involves filling out an online form on www.
geocaching.com or another site. Information includes cache type, size, 
coordinates (of course!), overall difficulty and terrain ratings, a descrip­
tion, and optionally, hints.
What do you get if you take geocaching and 
substitute the GPS receiver with a compass? 
Letterboxing, a low-tech version of geocach­
ing. And in this case, letterboxing has nothing 
to do with black bars on your TV set.
Instead of taking a trinket and leaving one, as 
you do in geocaching, letterboxing involves 
leaving your mark at every treasure location by 
stamping a log book with your own customized 
rubber stamp. You use another rubber stamp, 
stored in the cache box, to stamp your own 
book, like a passport.
If you wake up one Saturday morning and find 
your GPS receiver’s batteries are dead, a simi­
lar hobby awaits you. That is, if you’re handy 
with a compass.
You can read more about letterboxing at www.
letterboxing.org.

Finding Your Ancestors
GPS receivers can help you find your way, plot your course, and always let 
you know where you stand in the world. One thing it can’t do is help you find 
your soul. Believe me, if it could, I’d be in better shape.
Enough about lost souls. I have something pretty close to a soul, and that’s 
discovering my past by tracking down where my ancestors have tread. Even 
if you know where deceased relatives lived, it’s often difficult to find their 
old homesteads.
A very grave matter
Speaking of souls, you can use your GPS receiver to find burial sites. Some 
kind people have already logged the latitudinal and longitudinal positions of 
some cemeteries and share them with others on a Web site called The U.S. 
GeoGen Project (www.geogen.org).
In many cases, it’s an even more difficult task to find old cemeteries, some of 
which aren’t as preened and tended to as those where our closest relatives 
rest. They may be in heavily wooded areas. Or, worst of all, vandals or devel­
opers may have tipped over or removed headstones so that you’re not even 
sure that what you’re visiting is a cemetery. If you have a map that lists the 
cemetery, have jotted down its longitude and latitude coordinates, and are 
heading there with a GPS receiver, you have a much better chance of actu­
ally finding it, like the person shown in Figure 3-2.

Cemetery
The original author of the first edition of this book enlisted his adventure­
some mother in a quest for a great-grandfather’s grave. They knew the 
cemetery, but not the location of the gravestone.
The author had the cemetery’s name, so I bet you’re thinking the rest 
was easy. Far from it. It was a large cemetery. There were thousands of 
gravestones, many of them flat against the ground so you could see them 
only after walking up to each and every one. And just finding the cemetery 
wasn’t easy.
Now imagine you have the GPS coordinates for the cemetery and that, 
maybe from another genealogist’s efforts, you even have the latitude and 
longitude of the actual grave. Now that’s something! Imagine the time you’d 
save. Even with GPS readings that have a margin of error of 20 feet or so, you 
have narrowed down the search considerably.
This isn’t a book on genealogy, and I’m assuming you can figure out how 
to narrow down your search of cemeteries where your ancestors may be 
buried. GPS technology isn’t going to help you find these sites unless you 
know they are places to look for family headstones.
Finding Your Ancestors

Chapter 3

Once you have a good idea of which cemeteries are good bets, either 
because they are close to where ancestors lived or are located on the family 
land, you can use maps and other tools to find the coordinates. From there, 
it’s a matter of using your GPS navigational skills to reach each one and 
check them out.
In addition to the U.S. GeoGen Project’s Web site mentioned earlier, a 
good place to look for coordinates of cemeteries is the Geographic Names 
Information System (GNIS). The GNIS contains information about nearly 2 
million U.S. physical and cultural geographic features. Many of these include 
associated latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to enter into your GPS 
receiver to help you find them.
Here’s how you do a quick search of the GNIS:
	
1.	 Point your browser at http://geonames.usgs.gov/.
	
	 The GNIS home page appears.
	
2.	 On the top, click Search Domestic Names (if you are looking for U.S. 
landmarks).
	
	 A query form appears.
	
3.	 You can search many different ways. To search for a specific cemetery, 
as shown in Figure 3-3, do the following:
	
1.	 Type in the name of the cemetery.
	
2.	 To narrow it down a bit, type in the county name and choose the 
proper state.
	
3.	 Select Cemetery under Feature Type.
	
4.	 Click Send Query.
	
	 The site can sometimes take a painfully long time to search, but eventu­
ally it displays a list of search results, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Where is (old) home sweet home?
As I do a bit of genealogical research to find the source of my genes, I some­
times come across confusing maps showing where this or that ancestor 
made his home. I can’t go to the grocery store without getting lost, so you 
can imagine my confusion when reading these homestead maps, let alone 
actually traveling to an old homestead.
Wouldn’t it be easier if I knew the longitude and latitude of places I want 
to visit and then use my GPS receiver to find them? Why, yes, it would be 
easier.

Finding Your Ancestors
Just like finding cemeteries with Uncle Sam’s (celestial) help, you can use 
GPS coordinates to help locate where your relatives migrated within the 
United States. Why not just use a map? Like I said, I get lost on the way to 
the bathroom, so simply finding a location on a map, perhaps in another 
state, and driving there is not a reasonable expectation.
Instead, you can use the GPS navigation skills you discovered in the pre­
ceding chapter to travel to locations you want to visit as part of your 
genealogy research. Remember, these towns may be so small that they are 
difficult enough to find on a map. By using your GPS receiver, especially one 
designed for automobile use, you can find those homesteads quicker by fol­
lowing the coordinates.
	
Don’t forget to write down and make available the locations’ coordinates to 
genealogists, homesteads, farms, county courthouses, and local libraries.
