Preface
This book is designed to provide various phrases for beginning 
learners of American Sign Language or those who wish to commu-
nicate with the Deaf. American Sign Language is the dominant sign 
language of the Deaf community in the United States and English-
speaking parts of Canada. Here are some key phrases for everyday 
communication concerning greetings, introductions, signing and 
deafness, health, numbers, time, money, and more—in short, basic 
survival phrases in American Sign Language.
 
This book is not meant to teach the fundamentals of ASL gram-
mar or offer a comprehensive array of phrases (longer discussions 
of ASL grammar and basics can be found elsewhere, and almost 500 
phrases can be found in The American Sign Language Phrase Book, 
Third Edition). Even so, those who consistently use these basic phrases 
may discover that they begin to understand some sign concepts and 
can build upon this foundation to continue learning American Sign 
Language.
 
It is important to be aware that American Sign is a visual-spatial 
language distinct from spoken English. It has its own grammar, and 
the order in which signs are put together is different from English. 
ASL grammar incorporates not only the use of facial expressions but 
head and body movements and the efficient use of space around the 
signer as well.

American Sign
Language for Beginners

1
Chapter 1
Basic Sentence Types
As I mentioned earlier in the Introduction chapter, facial expressions 
play a very significant role in ASL. In a spoken language, the rise and 
fall of the voice adds meaning to the words spoken. Imagine the vari-
ous ways one can say “I love you.” The characteristic rising of the voice 
toward the end of a question is another example. Facial expressions 
are to ASL as vocal inflection is to spoken English.
 
Throughout this book, you will note that the phrases are delin-
eated as statements or questions. The face has these duties and 
supplies additional subtleties and nuances of meaning. Signs have 
meanings in and of themselves just as words do, but these meanings 
are altered, shaped, enriched, and amplified by facial expressions. 
This is true especially when one asks questions in ASL. In general, 
when one asks a wh- sign (who, what, why, where, when, which, 
how, and how many or how much—see Chapter 2), the eyebrows are 
downward. All other questions usually cause the eyebrows to move 
upward—for example, questions that require an affirmative or nega-
tive response. To support an affirmative response, nodding of the 
head would occur, e.g., “Yes, I’m married,” or a shaking of the head 
with the “I’m not married” response.

2
Perfect Phrases in American Sign Language for Beginners
For a wh- sign question, the eyebrows usually go downward. The wh- 
sign question is also accompanied by a head tilt.
Eyebrows move upward for other questions and are usually accompa-
nied by a head tilt.

3
Chapter 2
Question Signs
The wh- sign may come at the beginning or at the end of a question, 
or it may appear in both places. If you wish to emphasize a question, 
place it at the end.

Verbs in ASL fall into three categories: nondirectional verbs, one-
directional verbs, and multidirectional verbs. Movement in verb signs 
may express who is performing an action (the subject) and to whom 
the action is directed (the direct object). This quality of movement is 
called verb directionality
 
The nondirectional verbs (like the one above) do not express 
either subject or direct object; therefore, these two things (subject 
and direct object nouns and pronouns) must be supplied.

23
Greetings, Introductions, and Common Expressions
I love you.
 
I 
LOVE
YOU
This is also a nondirectional verb.

24
Perfect Phrases in American Sign Language for Beginners
I see him/her/it.
 
I 
SEE
In regard to verb directionality, as seen in this example one-directional 
verb signs express direct object but not subject; that is, one-directional 
verbs move toward the direct object; thus, a noun or pronoun is not 
required.
I help you.
HELP
Here we see an example of a multidirectional verb sign in which the 
movement goes from the subject toward the direct object; thus, nei-
ther subject nor direct object is signed.

25
Greetings, Introductions, and Common Expressions
You tell me.
YOU
TELL ME
This is another one-directional verb sign.

That the 2 in the twenties is made with the thumb and index finger 
rather than the  index and middle finger—as it appears in the number 
22—is probably due to the fact that ASL has its roots in the old French 
sign language. In Europe, even hearing people count one with the 
thumb and two with the thumb and index finger.

The Manual Alphabet
When there is not a sign for an idea or concept, then fingerspelling 
using the manual alphabet occurs. Fingerspelling is used particularly 
with proper names; brand names; titles of books and movies; names 
of places and certain foods, etc. Mastery of fingerspelling can be 
achieved if you form good habits from the very beginning.
 
Here are some tips to follow when learning fingerspelling: 
 
1. Relax your fingers and, in turn, your arm and shoulder. Tension 
will impede clear formation of the letters, or “handshapes,” as 
they are called in the manual alphabet.
 
2. Let your arm hang down with your elbow to your side and 
your hand slightly in front of you. Do not allow your elbow to 
move away from your side and rise upward.
 
3. Do not try to fingerspell rapidly. It is important to maintain a 
constant rhythm, but do not bounce your hand. Speed will 
come naturally with time.
 
4. Pause for one-fourth of a beat at the end of a word if you are 
fingerspelling several words at a time.

5. Do not say the letters or words out loud or to yourself as 
you make them. Do not develop this habit, otherwise it 
will be exceedingly difficult to break once established. As 
you fingerspell a word, mouth the whole word. This is done 
especially with some Deaf people who have been taught to 
lipread words, not letters.
 
6. Practice with someone so you can gain experience reading 
fingerspelling.
 
7. In reading fingerspelling; look at the whole shape or 
configuration of the word rather than reading each individual 
letter or handshape.
