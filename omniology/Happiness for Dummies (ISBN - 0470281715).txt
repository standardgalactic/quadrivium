Dedication
I dedicate this book to the countless numbers of people who, in one way or 
another, have brought happiness into my life.


Author’s Acknowledgments
I want to thank a number of fellow collaborators without whose efforts writ-
ing this book would not have been possible or nearly as enjoyable. As always, 
I want to express my appreciation to my agent, Maura Kye, of the Denise 
Marcil Literary Agency. Once again, she has served my interests well!
The team at John Wiley & Sons, Inc. — in particular, Mike Baker, Elizabeth 
Kuball, Lindsey Lefevere, and Diane Steele — was a pleasure to work with at 
all phases of the project. I greatly appreciate their encouragement and pro-
fessionalism, as well as their thoughtfulness and patience throughout. Their 
collective enthusiasm for the For Dummies brand is defi nitely contagious.
Lastly, I want to thank my loving family — Catherine, Chris, and Rebecca — 
for their unending support for my life’s work and, more important, for bring-
ing so much happiness into my life each and every day.
I believe that happiness is the only really important goal, and yet we are all 
dummies when it comes to pursuing it in our everyday lives. If this book 
brings even one additional moment of happiness to the life of a single reader, 
then my time spent on this project will have been well worth it.

Introduction
H
appiness is an important part of life — no less than anger, sadness, and 
fear. It begins with life itself: What mother doesn’t recognize the look 
of happiness on the face of her newborn? Human beings are wired with an 
innate, neurological potential for happiness, but whether this potential even-
tually becomes a reality depends on how we choose to live our lives. In other 
words, happiness isn’t an accident, and it isn’t a gift from the gods — it’s the 
gift you give yourself!
Unlike Shangri-La, a mythical paradise on Earth, happiness is not confined 
to a particular place, nor is it the result of any one specific activity or life cir-
cumstance. Happiness is a personal state of physical, spiritual, and emotional 
well-being that you can experience anywhere at any time. This morning, for 
example, before I began to work on this book, I spent a few happy moments 
sitting in my driveway quietly watching my two basset hounds, Max and 
Dixie, experiencing another day through the many divergent smells on a crisp 
fall morning in Virginia.
If you’re like me, you’re far too passive when it comes to experiencing happi-
ness. You wait for it to find you instead of exercising your right to pursue it. 
It’s because most people are passive when it comes to happiness that happi-
ness seems so elusive! Face it: We live in proactive times. People around the 
world don’t wait for freedom — they fight for it. Wealth is no longer some-
thing you have to inherit (despite what Paris Hilton may think) — you can 
create it. People are living longer these days. Why? Because we’re learning 
that we can improve quality of life through the everyday choices we make. 
Happiness For Dummies tells you how to fight for, create, and live a long and 
happy life. It makes you the master of your own happy destiny!
About This Book
How do you know when you’re happy? Are you as happy as most people? If 
you have lots of money or a fancy title at work, shouldn’t that be enough to 
make you happy? What does happiness have to do with health? Is there such 
a thing as eternal happiness? Can you really make yourself happy by putting 
a smile on your face? Type B personalities tend to enjoy less material success 
than Type A’s, so why are Type B’s so much happier? These are just a few of 
the important questions that Happiness For Dummies answers.

Happiness For Dummies 
In writing Happiness For Dummies, I had five basic goals in mind:
 
 I wanted to show you that happiness is not a simple emotion — it’s an 
extremely complex experience that results from feeling safe, satisfied, 
and grateful. By understanding all the key ingredients that are involved, 
you can make up your own recipe for happiness.
 
 I wanted to tell you what happiness isn’t — it isn’t power, money, suc-
cess, or excitement. Happiness is something much more than that!
 
 I wanted to show you how to develop those personality attributes 
that maximize your potential for happiness — optimism, hardiness, 
and conscientiousness. These are not qualities that you inherit at birth 
through some genetic “good fortune” — they’re learned traits, and if you 
haven’t learned them yet, this book can help.
 
 I wanted to offer you actionable strategies for pursuing happiness. In 
other words, I wanted to show you how to get into the flow of everyday life, 
how to find the silver lining in what you otherwise might view as an all-bad 
situation, how to develop an abiding sense of self-confidence, and how to 
smile for the right reasons. Think of this book as your happiness toolbox!
 
 I wanted to emphasize the importance of striking the right balance 
between the essential opposing forces that constitute human life, like 
that between work and play or between selfishness and generosity. 
Happiness is never found at the extremes of life — it’s in the middle. 
That’s why they call it the “happy medium”!
Happiness For Dummies is not one of those 12-step books where you have to 
read and follow the advice of Step 1 before you can proceed to Step 2, and so 
on. It’s a resource book that contains everything I know about how to achieve 
happiness after four decades of professional experience, both as a scientist 
and as a clinician — and after more than 60 years of personal experience 
living my own life!
I did not want Happiness For Dummies to be another one of those pie-in-the-
sky books containing more fluff than substance. This book is intended to 
show ordinary people how to pursue and achieve happiness. Simply put, 
it’s a road map that guides you to the most sought-after destination in life — 
happiness. Buying this book means you want to get there — Happiness For 
Dummies shows you how.
Conventions Used in This Book
Happiness For Dummies is not a book about the science of happiness. Even 
though the principles contained in the book are based in part on science, I’ve 
eliminated all the professional jargon and instead used terms and concepts 

3
 Introduction
that the average person without a degree in psychology can understand. 
Instead of looking at tables and charts, you read about happy people — 
composites of real people like yourself who represent friends, relatives, and 
clients I’ve had the good fortune to learn from over the years. The quotations 
and two-person dialogs that I include in these stories are based solely on my 
recollections of conversations I had. And, yes, you find a few reflections on 
my own most memorable moments of happiness sprinkled throughout —one 
of the perks of being an author is sharing my experiences!
You don’t have to know psychology to understand Happiness For Dummies. 
But I do use a couple of conventions that you should be aware of:
 
 When I introduce a new term, I put the word in italics and define it 
shortly thereafter (usually in parentheses).
 
 When I give you a list of steps to perform, I put the action part of the 
step in bold, so you can easily follow along.
 
 When I list an e-mail address or Web address, I use a special font called 
monofont so you know exactly what to type.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
Look on the bright side: I won’t be giving you a test after you’ve had a chance 
to read Happiness For Dummies. So, you don’t have to read every single word, 
sentence, chapter, and/or part of the book to get your money’s worth. And 
don’t feel compelled to remember everything. If it strikes a nerve, believe me, 
you’ll remember it!
Throughout the book, I include lots of sidebars — text in gray boxes. Sidebars 
make me happy! Although they aren’t an essential part of the overall message 
conveyed in this book, they are things I thought you might find interesting. You 
can think of them as side dishes to the main course. If you’re hungry for every 
morsel of information there is on how to pursue happiness, then by all means 
gobble them up; otherwise, you can skip them altogether and still satisfy your 
appetite.
You can also safely skip any paragraphs marked with Technical Stuff icons (see 
“Icons Used in This Book,” later in this Introduction, for more information).

Happiness For Dummies 
Foolish Assumptions
I made a few assumptions about you when I was writing Happiness For Dummies:
 
 You want to be happy — but so far happiness has been elusive. You 
bought this book, not because you want or need someone to convince 
you that happiness is a good thing, but because you haven’t been able 
to achieve it on your own. You know it’s out there; you just don’t know 
how to find it.
 
 You’re open-minded about discovering more-efficient ways to achieve 
happiness. People don’t typically buy books simply to reinforce their own 
fixed ideas about life or to have someone else tell them about experiences 
they’ve already had. They’re looking for something new, something differ-
ent, something that will both guide and inspire them — something that will 
help them not only survive but, more important, thrive on life.
 
 You see yourself as part of the “let’s do it” generation and you want 
to be a player, not a spectator, when it comes to achieving true happi-
ness. This attitude portends one of the key personality traits underlying 
happiness — hardiness — which I cover in this book. You may be far-
ther along in your pursuit of happiness than you realized!
How This Book Is Organized
I organized Happiness For Dummies into 6 parts and 23 chapters. Here’s what 
you can find in each part.
Part I: Defining Happiness
In these first four chapters, I acquaint you with some basic ideas about hap-
piness as a universal emotion, the benefits that positive emotions have for 
health, the key ingredients that make up happiness, and what happiness 
isn’t. (Knowing what happiness isn’t is important because many people spend 
most of their lives searching for happiness in all the wrong places.) I show 
you how to calculate your HQ — happiness quotient — and help you com-
pare yourself to others so that you know whether you’re ahead of or behind 
the curve. I also explain how happiness is simply your nervous system’s 
feedback about whether you’re living the right kind of life — and fill you in on 
what right means in the context of achieving happiness.

5
 Introduction
Part II: Personality Attributes 
That Lead to Happiness
In this part, I introduce concepts — in this case, personality attributes — 
from the emerging field of positive psychology that greatly influence the 
extent to which you experience happiness. Not everyone learns early in life 
(if at all) to be optimistic, hardy, and conscientious, so in these three chap-
ters I show you how to be that type of person and get a leg up in your quest 
for happiness. It’s not hard — trust me.
Part III: Behaving Your Way 
toward Happiness
Chapters 8 through 12 show you specific ways to behave — always look for 
the silver lining, have a heart-to-heart with a higher power, make a daily con-
fession of the positives in your life — that increase your potential for achiev-
ing happiness. Chapter 12 talks in depth about the power of a smile and gives 
you a heads-up about which smiles will not bring you happiness. The idea 
here is that happiness is no mere accident — it’s something that you have 
to work for!
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance
If you’re like me, your everyday life is mostly out of balance. Sad to say, you 
approach life from one extreme or another — you work too much and play too 
little, you have too many hassles and not enough of life’s little pleasures, and 
you’re either too selfish or too selfless. Am I right? This part of the book helps 
you find a happy medium along some of the more important dimensions of life.
Part V: Achieving Happiness 
in Key Relationships
People tend to compartmentalize their day-to-day lives into three main areas 
of interaction — at work, at home, and in intimate relationships. The three 
chapters in this part offer situation-specific strategies designed to increase 
happiness. Interpersonal happiness is all about reciprocity — or, as the 
saying goes, “What goes around comes around.” Here I show you how to 

6
Happiness For Dummies 
calculate your workplace positivity ratio, which determines whether employees 
flounder or flourish at work; tell you which parenting style leads to a happy 
home life; and illustrate how marital happiness is really a three-legged stool.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you’re looking for quick ideas about how to raise a happy child or the ten 
most common roadblocks to becoming a happy person, or you just want an 
easy-to-remember checklist of personal habits or thoughts that foster happi-
ness, this is the part for you.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures in the margins throughout this book that are 
there to draw your attention to certain types of information.
 
This icon suggests practical how-to strategies for achieving happiness.
 
This icon alerts you to important ideas and concepts that you’ll want to

in hand.
 
Every once in a while, the scientist in me gets a little chatty, and when I do, I 
mark the paragraph with this icon. You can read these paragraphs if you want, 
but the information they contain isn’t essential to your understanding of the 
topic at hand.
 
This icon appears when I think a cautionary note is in order or when you need 
to seek professional help.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t have to begin by reading Chapter 1 and continue straight through 
to the end of the book. Each part and chapter of this book is meant to stand 
alone in its discussion of how to achieve true happiness. When I was writing, 
I skipped around, writing chapters in no particular order — when I finished 
one chapter, I looked at the table of contents to see what interested me next 
and went with that. It made the writing more fun. Feel free to do the same — 
choose a topic that interests you and dive in!

7
 Introduction
You may want to head straight for those chapters that focus on how to 
achieve happiness in your key relationships — at work, at home, and with 
your loved ones (Part V). Or you may want to take a quick look at the ten 
most common obstacles to happiness (Chapter 22). The choice is yours. 
In the end, it really doesn’t matter where you start — what matters most is 
where you end up, I hope a much happier person!
A word of caution
If after reading Happiness For Dummies and 
trying the behavioral strategies set forth in this 
book, you still find yourself struggling to find 
happiness, talk to a professional — a licensed 
clinical psychologist or mental-health coun-
selor, for example. Tell your counselor that 
you’ve already read Happiness For Dummies 
and, if she hasn’t already, suggest that she do 
so as well — that way, you can ensure that 
you’re both on the same page and she’ll know 
that you’ve already done your homework in 
trying to become a happier person.
I don’t recommend looking for a medical remedy 
for unhappiness — one that focuses on pre-
scribed medication. There is no known pill that 
will create a sense of enduring happiness, only 
ones that treat some of the obstacles to happi-
ness, such as depression.
Finally, if you’ve been diagnosed with clinical 
depression, you owe it to yourself to get help.

Depression For Dummies, by Laura L. Smith, 
PhD, and Charles H. Elliott, PhD (Wiley).

Happiness For Dummies 

Part I
Deﬁ ning Happiness

In this part . . .
I 
talk about why happiness is a universal emotion and 
help you begin to appreciate just how complex an 
experience true happiness is. I explain why there is no 
such thing as eternal, everlasting happiness and why it’s 
important to enjoy those precious moments. I show you 
how to quantify happiness and break down happiness into 
its various components — pleasure, gratitude, content-
ment — so that you know how close you are to achieving 
your goal of being a happy person. I also tell you where 
not to look for happiness — power, status, wealth, and 
success. If that’s all you pursue in life, you can only end 
up being unhappy! Finally, I explain what your nervous 
system is telling you when you find happiness — the 
answers to four crucial questions that determine your 
overall quality of life.

Chapter 1
Anyone Can Be Happy
In This Chapter
 Experiencing happiness anywhere
 Meeting some happy people
 Calculating you happiness quotient
 Benefiting from positive emotions
W
hat do children in an Israeli kibbutz, students at the College of William 
and Mary, and preliterate tribesmen in the wilds of Borneo share in 
common? Not their language or customs. It’s their innate ability to experience 
happiness. Nowhere on this planet is there a group of human beings who lack 
the capacity for joy, satisfaction, peace of mind, and well-being.
Unlike its counterparts — anger, sadness, and fear — happiness is a positive 
emotion. Happiness is the glue that binds us all together and underlies all 
forms of civilized behavior. Happy employees are more productive. Happy 
couples have more enjoyable sex. Happy children make good students. Just 
as anger repulses people, happiness attracts. Happy people enjoy more sup-
port from those around them and are more sought after in social situations. 
Happiness offsets the burdens of everyday life and can be a healing force for 
the injured and infirm.
In this chapter, I fill you in on the many benefits that come from positive 
emotions and show you how to assess how happy you are at any point in 
life. I show you that it’s possible to be happy no matter what your social and 
economic circumstances. And I introduce you to four people whose stories 
illustrate some key ingredients to how you can go about achieving happiness.
Happiness: The Universal Emotion
Happiness is everywhere — in every country, culture, big city, jungle, canyon, 
and apartment building in the world, anywhere that human beings reside. 
Thus, happiness — along with anger, curiosity, fear, disgust, and sadness — is 
considered a universal emotion.

12
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Psychologist Paul Ekman, professor emeritus at the University of California 
Medical School in San Francisco, spent his entire 40-year career circumnavi-
gating the globe, and everywhere he went he found the same smiling faces. 
His research pointed the way to our understanding that emotions are not 
learned behaviors — we’re born with them. What you can learn, however, 
are ways of accessing happiness.
 
Find a quiet spot somewhere — your favorite coffee shop, the YMCA, your 
local shopping mall, a park bench — and, like Dr. Ekman, observe the faces of 
people around you. Count how many smiling faces you see in a period of 30 
minutes. You’ll probably find that there’s a lot more happiness in the world 
than you imagined.
Happiness from the Individual 
Perspective
Other people are the best teachers, no matter what you’re trying to learn. So, 
if you want to know how to be happy, what better way to start than by asking 
people who show happiness more than most people?
I interviewed four people whose stories are not only interesting but instruc-
tive. Here’s what they had to say:
 
 Diane is a 64-year old grandmother of eight. She’s what’s known as a 
“mover-shaker” in the real-estate business, a very successful woman, 
who has an infectious laugh and looks much younger than her age. Diane 
has had, in her words, “a blessed life,” and her only major current stress 
is caring for an aging parent. She attends church regularly and has for 
most of her life. On a happiness scale from 1 to 10, Diane rates herself 
“at least 9” and she believes that people who know her would give her 
that same score. I asked Diane what the secret to her happiness is, and 
she said:
 
 That’s easy. I had happy parents. We didn’t have a lot of money, 
but they managed to make me feel special and a very important 
part of their lives. They were very positive about whatever I 
wanted to do when I was growing up. And, most important, they 
showed me I had a choice about how to see life — if you look for 
the positive, you’ll find it. And the same goes if you’re always look-
ing for the negative.
 
 That positive outlook Diane learned from her parents has served her 
well in her business. As she put it, “In real estate, looking for the positive 
helps when you have to deal with difficult people and I think it makes it 
easier for me to find solutions to problems.”

13
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
 
 Lanny is 74 and widowed. He has one grown daughter and two grand-
kids, who are the joy of his life. Lanny retired after a long and very suc-
cessful career as a stock broker, and now he spends a lot of his time 
doing volunteer work for various community agencies. He believes 
it’s important to give back some of the good fortune he’s accumulated 
throughout his life. Lanny also attends church regularly.
 
 At the time I interviewed Lanny, there were no significant stresses in 
his life, but there had been in the past — the deaths of four siblings, his 
parents, and his wife, all as a result of severe and lingering illness. Still, 
on that 1-to-10 happiness scale, Lanny rates himself a 10. He believes 
it’s important to look for opportunities to be happy and to work hard to 
achieve that end. His motto: “Only you can make it happen!”
 
 Like Diane, Lanny doesn’t look his age — he says, “I don’t frown and have 
wrinkles, so most people think I’m younger than I am!” He also believes that 
happiness has had a lot to do with the fact that he’s rarely been ill through-
out his life. Lanny says he owes much of his ability to be happy to his 
mother, who from the outset taught him to “go to bed every night thinking 
about something positive you did today.” He begins the day the same way, 
thinking about “someone I want to see today who means a lot to me” — this 
sets the emotional tone for his day. Lanny also makes a point of repeating 
to himself, both silently and aloud, “Life is good!”, which keeps him focused 
on the positives in the world around him. Finally, he thanks people he 
encounters for “sharing their smile” with him, which they’re glad to do.
 
 Janine is 56, has two grown sons, and is happily married. She spends 
much of her time lately doing volunteer work, which she describes 
as both a joy and a hassle, depending on which day you ask her. She 
attends religious services regularly. And you’d never guess it from her 
happy demeanor, but Janine has long suffered from chronic depression. 
Interestingly, part of her success in managing her depression comes as 
a result of her attempts to “keep others happy” — their happiness then 
bounces back on her and “helps me get through difficult times.”
 
 What’s her recipe for happiness? She says, “My mother taught me that 
‘pretty is as pretty does’ — in other words, a smile is more becoming 
than a snarl.” Her mother also taught her to “not say anything about 
someone if you can’t be nice,” which remains a guiding principle in 
Janine’s life. Her mother was a strong role model, a self-made woman 
with a generous spirit. Janine feels that happiness is a gift from her 
mother — a talent — that she, in turn, must share with the world. On 
the happiness scale, she rates herself a definite 9!
 
 Cecil is 60 and still actively employed in the insurance business, a profes-
sion he has succeeded at since high school when he began shadowing his 
father, who was also an insurance agent. He’s married to the same sweet 
woman he met decades ago, whom he credits with being a major influ-
ence in his ability to be perpetually happy — “She pulls me up in life and 
always has.” She’s also taught Cecil to “loosen up” and enjoy life — and, 
be the type of person who always sees the glass half-full.

14
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
 Cecil had a childhood illness that left him disabled, and he learned 
early on that humor defuses the awkwardness that often arises when 
you have a handicap. He attends church regularly and also looks much 
younger than his age. Cecil believes that happiness is crucial to good 
health — “At my age, I think it’s remarkable that I don’t take any pre-
scription drugs.” Laughter is Cecil’s medication to be sure. He is leg-
endary when it comes to telling jokes; as a close friend once said, “It’s 
impossible to tell a joke that Cecil hasn’t already told.” He believes that 
happiness is contagious and he’s apparently doing his best to infect the 
world around him.
Each of these people is unique in his or her own way, but there are some 
commonalities to their happy stories:
 
 They all attribute much of their happiness to the influences of significant 
others in their lives (parents, life partners).
 
 They all profess a belief that happiness is something you have to work 
for — you have to find it, it doesn’t come looking for you.
 
 They all believe it’s possible to be happy even when life doesn’t always 
go the way you want it to (for example, when dealing with aging parents, 
coping with depression, or grieving the loss of loved ones to debilitating 
illnesses).
 
 They all believe in a higher power and practice their religion, and they 
think that helps them have a positive outlook on life.
 
 They all believe in beginning and ending the day with positive thoughts 
that lend themselves to happiness.
 
 They all believe that happiness insures good health and keeps you look-
ing young.
 
 They all believe that happiness is something that increases with age (see 
the following section).
 
Talk to a happy person you know and see if you can find out what his secret to 
happiness is. If you’re like me, you’ll be surprised at how willing he is to talk 
about why he’s happy, who in his life enabled him to feel this way, and what 
he sees as the benefits that come from always being positive.
The Demographics of Happiness
Happiness is a very democratic emotion — it isn’t an emotion that’s avail-
able to only a certain group of individuals and not others. But there are some 
demographic characteristics that increase your chances of being happy. I 
cover these in the following sections.

15
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
Age
Age seems to increase a person’s overall likelihood of being happy. If you think 
that young people have the advantage here, you’re wrong. Most young people 
are happy to be sure, but research shows that you’re much more likely to expe-
rience happiness the older you get. In one survey, 38 percent of respondents 
aged 68 to 77 reported feeling “very happy” as compared to only 28 percent of 
respondents between the ages of 18 and 27. This same survey showed a sharp 
increase in happiness scores beginning at age 45 and continuing into the mid-
70s. (There was a similar decline in negative emotions with age.)
So, why do people tend to get happier as they get older?
 
 Older people have reached a point of satiation in life. They’ve had a 
sufficient amount of success and positive experiences to feel both grateful 
and content. Younger people are on the way, but they’re not there yet.
 
 Age alters a person’s expectations. Somewhere along the way, you real-
ize that you don’t get everything you want out of life and that life never 
was meant to be perfect. I tell people all the time, “If you want to be 
happy, you don’t have to like the way life is — you just have to accept 
that it is that way.”
 
 With age comes wisdom — a perspective that results from a combina-
tion of accumulated worldly experience and knowledge — not often 
seen as people muddle through the first half of life.
It’s no coincidence that the people I interviewed (see the preceding section) 
were all between the ages 56 and 74.
Marital status
Marriage also seems to make a difference in people’s happiness. Married 
people, generally speaking, are happier than those who are unmarried. This 
is true for both men and women. Marriage is one of the meaningful social 
The happiest country in the world
Finland is purportedly the happiest country in 
the world. Their secret, so say the Finns, is that 
they’re a culture of modest expectations. As a 
people, they want less out of life and are satis-
fied with what they have. Finland has a short-
age of workaholics and there is little disparity 
as far as wealth goes. They don’t suffer from 
all the social pressures and violence that typify 
most industrialized countries. They find a cer-
tain comfort in their collective humility — when 
it comes to materialism, they’re content being 
the underdog.

16
Part I: Defining Happiness 
ties I talk about in Chapter 16. Marriage brings coherence to people’s lives 
(Chapter 10), gives them an opportunity to be less selfish (Chapter 17), and 
allows them to tend and befriend those they love (Chapter 20).
 
Although most of the research looks at happiness in married people, I think 
it’s fair to say that these same benefits would accrue from other types of com-
mitted, long-term relationships as well.
 
Not all partnerships are happy. In Chapter 20, I point out the aspects of an inti-
mate relationship that make for a happy couple. These include
 
 Understanding that being in an intimate relationship means being your 
partner’s companion
 
 Creating a sense of equity and parity in the relationship
 
 Sharing interests, passion, and intimacy
 
 Avoiding contempt even when angry
 
 Practicing empathy
 
 Saying the magic words: “I am sorry.”
Education level
The more education you have, the happier you’re likely to be. This may be an 
indirect effect of the positive relationship that education has on a person’s 
earning power, health, ability to cope with the stresses and strains of every-
day life, and longevity. In short, education doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be 
happy, but it sure does increase your odds.
 
Sign up for a class or two at your local community college. Trust me, you’ll be 
happy you did.
Happiness at Each Stage 
of Self-Actualization
According to psychologist Abraham Maslow, a forerunner of the positive 
psychology movement, if you’re self-confident (as opposed to self-centered), 
enjoy solitude, have a need to serve the greater good, have a keen sense of 
humor, and aren’t afraid to be creative and unique in how you approach life, 
you’re a self-actualized person. Maslow said that happiness comes from sat-
isfying a hierarchy of needs in an orderly manner. He argued that you experi-
ence happiness at each of five levels of self-actualization:

17
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
 
 Level I: The first level of self-actualization has to do with meeting your 
basic survival needs — air, water, food, and sleep. At this level, happiness 
is more about having something to eat than it is about tender, loving care.
 
 Level II: The second level of self-actualization has to do with safety and 
can include everything from a safe neighborhood to a financial safety 
net that comes from having a supportive family or by working hard to 
put aside money for your retirement years.
 
 Level III: The next level involves a sense of belonging — that is, feeling 
loved and needed by others.
 
 Level IV: The fourth level has to do with self-esteem. Do you feel like you’re 
respected and appreciated by others? Do you like and respect yourself?
 
 Level V: The final level Maslow calls self-actualization. In essence, you’re 
there, you’ve arrived, you’ve reached your full potential, and you are 
your happiest, most unique, most creative self. Classic examples of self-
actualized people include Thomas Jefferson, Florence Nightingale, Albert 
Schweitzer, Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Mother Teresa.
Having satisfied each level of need/motivation, you then move on to the next 
all the way to the “peak” of what life has to offer.
So, ask yourself: How satisfied am I as far as biological needs, safety, love, self-
esteem, and creativity goes? You may be more self-actualized than you know.
Looking at the Benefit 
of Positive Emotions
Only in recent years have psychologists begun to appreciate the benefits of 
positive emotion — benefits that include everything from enhanced creativ-
ity to improved immune-system function. Dr. Barbara Fredrickson at the 
University of North Carolina, a leader in the field of positive psychology, 
posed the question, “What good are positive emotions?” and came up with 
the following possibilities.
Broadening your focus and 
expanding your thinking
Positive emotions — curiosity, love, joy, contentment, wonder, excitement — 
expand your focus of attention. When you’re angry, your focus narrows to the 
source of your frustration and the object of your wrath. Your mind is like a 
heat-seeking missile, bent on destruction.

18
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Contrast this with what happens when you get excited about something — 
your mind opens up and there’s a free flow of ideas and intellectual possibil-
ity. Curiosity abounds. This is precisely why passion is so essential to artistic 
endeavors. This is also why you need a high positivity ratio in the workplace 
(see Chapter 18) if you want a high rate of productivity and a healthy bottom 
line. In short, your brain works best when it’s high on happiness.
 
Dr. Fredrickson likens the cognitive changes that accompany positive emotion 
to a state of mania (great excitement), only in this case not the kind of mania 
that requires medical treatment.
All four of the happy people I introduce in “Happiness from the Individual 
Perspective,” earlier in this chapter, also enjoyed success in their respec-
tive careers. When I talked to them, I could hear the excitement and passion 
in their voices, whether we were discussing the challenges of dealing with 
difficult clients in the real-estate business or how to thrive in the insurance 
industry. And that passion had obviously not diminished despite their age.
Psychologist Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical 
School teaches his patients the art of mindfulness meditation — a Buddhist 
meditation exercise — as a means of expanding their awareness of those 
things they fear most, for example, chronic pain and depression. He has 
patients relax their bodies while at the same time opening up their minds. 
The irony here is that the more clearly you think about your pain, the less 
it distresses you. (If you’d like to try meditation, but you’re not sure where 
to start, check out Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephan Bodian 
[Wiley]. It includes a CD of guided meditation exercises.)
 
When Kabat-Zinn and others studied the brain activity that accompanies this 
type of meditation, they found that it was the left frontal lobe of the brain that 
was literally turned on — the part that scientists refer to as the “happy brain.”
Endorphins: The link between 
happiness and pain relief
The same chemicals that facilitate pain 
relief — often referred to as the body’s own 
painkillers — also underlie feelings of pleasure, 
joy, and contentment. Those chemicals are 
called endorphins, and they have an opiate-like 
effect on a person’s mental and emotional states. 
The so-called “runner’s high” is an example of 
endorphins at work, suppressing the pain that 
would naturally come from long-distance run-
ning. In addition to exercise, activities that turn 
the brain on to endorphins include all forms of 
creative activity, competitive pursuits (as long 
as you don’t get angry), fellowship with others, 
prayer, healthy sexual encounters, and being sur-
rounded by things of beauty.

Improving your ability to problem-solve
Psychiatrist Avery Weisman, in his wonderful book The Coping Capacity 
(Human Sciences Press), lists 15 commonly used coping strategies, including 
“Laugh it off — change the emotional tone.” That’s right, when you’re frus-
trated and you’re having trouble solving some problem that confronts you, 
what you need is a good laugh. Laughter unfreezes a “stuck” brain. Think of 
humor as a lubricant that allows the wheels — your thought processes — to 
once again move toward a solution. The mechanism that underlies effective 
problem-solving is creativity, which is your brain’s ability to come up with 
novel, unique answers to life’s many challenges.
In the ten years that I ran an outpatient rehabilitation program for chronic-
pain sufferers, one of the things that made our program more effective than 
most medically oriented programs was the fact that we went out of our way 
to create a positive environment for our clients. The four-hour-a-day, five-
week experience we offered our clients was about much more than shots and 
pills. Getting people who experience pain 24/7 to lighten up and laugh is no 
easy task, I can assure you. But, in the end, I’m convinced that laughter is the 
best painkiller on the market. Typically, within only a couple of days, strang-
ers whose only common link was their ongoing pain began to smile, giggle, 
tease one another, and, for the first time in years, exhibit a sense of hope and 
optimism. Suddenly, those who had steadfastly resisted engaging in any type 
of physical reconditioning were willing to tackle the treadmill, floor exercises, 
and exercise bike. In group discussions, patients were able to come up with 
creative solutions of how to live with pain — whereas before they could only 
envision a lifetime of misery and disability. They began to move about more 
freely — walking faster, limping less, and showing more signs of stamina. Pain 
management was now a possibility that they embraced rather than ran from.
Building physical, intellectual, 
and social resources
Positive emotions build the following resources:
 
 Physical resources: People are more playful when they’re happy — 
they’re interested in golf, tennis, marathon running, pick-up basketball 
games, adult softball leagues, scuba-diving, and water-skiing. Happy 
people are more likely to exercise on a regular basis. Part of this comes 
from the higher self-esteem seen in happy people. In short, happiness 
translates into physical fitness — stronger muscles, improved heart-lung 
function, and increased flexibility.

20
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
 This relationship between happiness and physical resources explains, 
in large part, why the Baby Boomer generation is expected to live longer 
and healthier than preceding generations — as a group, they’ve been 
happier and more physically active throughout their lives and they have 
no intention of changing any of that even after retirement.
 
 The next time you feel really happy, think about signing up at a local 
gym. That’s where all the other happy people are!
 
 Intellectual resources: People learn better when they’re in a positive 
frame of mind.
 
 I once attended a workshop conducted by Patch Adams, the controversial 
physician who believes that positive emotions have the power to heal. 
What was unusual about this workshop was having my nose painted red by 
one of his assistants — who was dressed as a clown — at the beginning of 
the afternoon seminar. He didn’t ask my permission — he just did it! And, 
you know what? The workshop was one of the best learning experiences of 
my entire professional life — I looked silly as hell, but I sure learned a lot. 
There’s something about humility that opens the mind, relaxes the body, 
and makes the brain more receptive to incoming information.
 
 The most effective schoolteachers are the ones who find ways to make 
education enjoyable — laughter makes kids pay attention and attention 
is the key to learning. The same is true when you go to a continuing edu-
cation experience; you want a speaker who is not only knowledgeable 
about his subject matter, but who can be entertaining.
 
 I tell my students at the community college to do something for fun 
before they sit down to study for a test and they’ll get a better grade. If 
you engage in a fun activity first, your brain will be like a happy sponge 
and absorb all that material.
 
 Social resources: Human beings gravitate toward positive people and 
away from negative ones.
 
 Think about the biblical prescription, “Do onto others as you would 
have them do unto you,” and decide how you want to be treated. If you 
want to be treated badly, then by all means act badly toward others. 
However, if you want people to smile at you, you need to greet them 
with cheer and influence their lives in some positive way. More often 
than not, this is what you’ll get in return.
Counteracting negative emotions
Happiness is one antidote to rage. Optimism can be an antidote to fear and 
cynicism. Joy is the opposite of misery. Humor defuses a desire for ven-
geance. Positive and negatives emotions can’t exist at the same moment in 
time. Embracing one negates the other.

21
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
Once when I was being treated for depression, I was fussing about things I 
thought my family had done to agitate me, when my therapist interrupted to 
ask, “Do you love your wife?” Without hesitation, I said, “Of course, I do.” He 
then told me to continue ranting and raving about my family, but I couldn’t. 
My head wanted to, but my heart was no longer in it — it happened just that 
fast. Whenever I find myself getting angry at the people closest to me, I ask 
myself that same question, “Do I love this person?” and the anger disappears.
 
The next time you find yourself feeling negative — upset, angry, sad — try 
replacing that with a positive feeling and see what happens. Think about 
someone who makes you laugh, something that excites you, some activity that 
pleases you — it may provide just the escape you need from those negative 
emotions.
Protecting your health
You probably already know that getting upset or angry can raise your blood 
pressure and, in the worst-case scenario, precipitate a heart attack or stroke. 
But did you know that positive emotions can lower your blood pressure and 
risk for cardiovascular disease? Well, they can.
The pioneering work of Dr. Barbara Fredrickson illustrated that when stressed 
people watched a film that left them feeling amused and content, that led to 
quicker recovery of heart function. She also noted that stressed subjects who 
smiled while watching a sad movie had a more rapid heart rate recovery than 
those who didn’t smile. Her thesis is that positive emotions undo the effects of 
stress and, therefore, protect a person’s health over the long run.
The wrong time to be happy
There is one situation in which happiness 
doesn’t pay — it’s when you’re trying to negoti-
ate a resolution to some type of conflict or bar-
gain with someone. If the opposing party sees 
that you’re in a good mood, he’s more likely to 
have a longer list of demands.
Research shows that parties concede more to 
an angry opponent than a happy one. So, if you 
want to strike a good deal, wipe that smile off 
your face and replace it with a frown — even 
if you don’t feel all that negative. It’s just good 
business!
Happiness detracts from the impression that 
you’re a tough negotiator. It also implies that, 
no matter what you say, you’ll be satisfied with 
whatever the last offer was. It encourages 
others to hold the line on what they’re willing 
to give you. So, the next time you go to buy a 
car or a new house — where negotiation is 
expected — put on your serious face. You can 
smile after the deal is done.

22
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Other studies have shown that something as simple as getting a light touch on 
your hand from a compassionate friend or the act of petting your favorite animal 
can also lower your blood pressure — and, neither requires a prescription, gets 
you into a hassle with your insurance carrier, or has negative side-effects.
Achieving Happiness Isn’t Always Easy
You’d think it would be easy to be happy, but that’s not always the case. You 
have to be aware. You can’t be in a hurry. And you have to welcome the expe-
rience. In the following sections, I show you how.
Being mindful
Mindfulness is about paying attention. Being mindful requires that you stay in 
the present moment — the here and now — which isn’t easy for folks whose 
minds are always dwelling on the past or skipping ahead to the future. If you’re 
paying attention to the world around you, then you’re said to be “mindful of 
your surroundings.” In the case of emotions like happiness, mindfulness has to 
do with being acutely aware of your inner feelings — something most people 
don’t do enough of.
Being mindful requires that you be able to focus your thoughts on one thing — 
how you feel — and nothing else. For some people, this is more difficult than it 
sounds. Often, for example, when I ask male clients how they feel about some-
thing, they answer by telling me what they think or what they did. They’re simply 
not used to thinking in emotional terms. In the more extreme case, I end up 
saying, “Look, I don’t care what you thought or what you did. I just want to know 
how you felt at the time — you know, like mad, sad, or glad. Which were you?”
Being mindful requires that you not critique, sensor, or judge whatever it is 
that you’re focusing your attention on. There is no right or wrong to how you 
feel. If you feel happy, that’s okay — if not, that’s okay, too.
 
You may be happier than you realize because you’re not paying attention. Your 
mind is always somewhere else — worrying about this or that, checking things 
off the never-ending to-do list, and so forth. If you stop for a minute to reflect — 
be mindful — you may be surprised at how good you feel.
Lingering in the moment
The dictionary defines lingering as “remaining in a place longer than usual 
or longer than expected.” Lingering is, in effect, a measure of time — in 
this case, taking time to enjoy a moment of happiness. Hurrying is just the 

23
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
opposite. When you hurry, you quickly jump from one experience or task to 
another. You tell yourself you don’t have time to stay with any one thing too 
long. Always moving forward, always too much left to accomplish.
In Chapter 15, I talk about some of the differences between Type A and Type 
B personalities and how this impacts the balance between work and play. 
Type A’s hurry; Type B’s tend to linger.
Kristin, a highly intelligent 30-year old, single woman, was very accomplished 
but also very unhappy. She was a workaholic, putting in at least 10 to 12 
hours at the office each day. If there was a task to be done, Kristin was the 
one to do it — definitely a Type A! When I asked her to tell me about her feel-
ings, she angrily replied,
Dr. Gentry, I don’t have time to have feelings — I’m too damned busy. 
The people who work under me, now they all have feelings. They’re 
always mad about something or upset because of this or that, which, 
believe me, gets in the way of their work. So, when you ask me how I feel, 
the honest answer is, “I don’t have a clue.”
When I finally succeeded in helping Kristin explore her feelings, she became 
painfully aware of just how sad, depressed, anxious, and defeated she felt 
most days. (Sometimes, in counseling, people end up feeling worse before 
they feel better.) This then begged the question: “Is this how you want to 
feel at work for the next 30 years, or would you like instead to enjoy your job 
and be happy with what you’ve accomplished?” I’m happy to say that Kristin 
chose the latter.
Bottom line: Some people allow time in their busy day for a few moments of 
happiness, and others don’t. Which kind of person are you?
Being happy about being happy
Some people just have a hard time letting themselves be happy. Take Rod, 
for example. He wants to be happy — he really does — but as soon as he 
finds himself enjoying life, he gets anxious. Deep down in his subconscious, 
Rod knows two things for certain:
 
 The minute he lets himself feel the least bit happy, something will come 
along and screw it up.
 
 For some reason, he doesn’t deserve to be happy.
Where in the world did Rod get these screwy ideas? The answer is: He got 
them by being raised in an alcoholic home by parents who were emotionally 
unstable, unpredictable, and at times violent. Rod and his brothers could be 
playing happily one minute and the next minute all hell would break loose 

24
Part I: Defining Happiness 
and somebody would end up hurt. “It was like you were afraid to let yourself 
relax and enjoy what you were doing because any second everything went 
from harmony to chaos,” he said. Thirty-five years later, Rod is still afraid, 
always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Without realizing it, Rod is being 
self-protective. The logic is simple: You can’t lose what you never had.
And why exactly does Rod feel like he doesn’t deserve to be happy? Because 
the child in him — that part of his personality that never really grew up — 
thinks like all children that “if my parents are angry or unhappy, it must be 
because I did something wrong.” Because the child did something wrong, he 
deserves to be punished. And what better punishment is there than a lifetime 
of unhappiness?
 
When you find yourself in a happy moment, does a little voice in the back 
of your head whisper, “Be careful, don’t let your guard down — you don’t 
deserve this”? If so, you may want to consider seeing a mental-health profes-
sional — part of a mental-health professional’s job is to help people quiet 
those lingering childlike voices that often get in the way of people’s adult 
lives.
Timing is everything
Maybe happiness is meant to be the exception 
rather than the rule. If you’re happy too much 
of the time, you might get too comfortable — 
too complacent — with the way things are 
and not want to change anything. For example, 
if people had been happy having to light their 
homes with candles, we wouldn’t have needed 
Thomas Edison to come along and invent the 
electric light bulb. If in the Old West, people had 
been happy with the Pony Express as the major 
communication link between east and west, 
we wouldn’t have needed the telegraph, tele-
phone, and eventual global telecommunication 
networks. If Americans had been happy using 
horses to plow their fields and take them into 
town, Henry Ford would never have brought us 
tractors and automobiles.
This could also explain why people tend to be 
happier as they grow older. Maybe it makes 
sense that young people are more frustrated, 
angrier, and more restless about life — these 
feelings provide the energy necessary to 
make things happen in terms of productivity, 
entrepreneurship, creativity, and invention.
What I’m suggesting is that perhaps happiness 
is wasted on the young and is an emotion better 
suited to people in the second half of life. Why 
else would 38 percent of people between the 
ages of 68 and 77 report being “very happy” as 
compared to only 28 percent of those between 
18 and 27?
Look on the bright side: If you’re under age 40, 
you have something to look forward to — a hap-
pier time of life. If you’re over 40, good news: 
You’re already well on your way to compound-
ing a life of happiness.

25
 Chapter 1: Anyone Can Be Happy
How Happy Are You?
Nearly everybody is happy at one time or another. Happiness, like all 
emotions — anger, pain, sadness — is a subjective experience, which means 
only you know how happy you are. On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 is not at 
all happy and 10 is the height of happiness), where are you right now? Divide 
that number by 10 (so if you said 6, divide 6 by 10, and you get 0.6, or 60 per-
cent) to get your happiness quotient (HQ).
 
Happiness scores tend to be skewed toward the positive end, which means 
that the average person either is typically somewhere between 5 and 10 
in terms of how positive he feels or he doesn’t want anyone to think he’s 
unhappy — probably a little of both.
If your rating HQ is 50 percent or below, you’re less happy than most people. If 
you scored 10 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent, you’re basically saying you’re 
unhappy. If your current HQ is 80 percent, 90 percent, or 100 percent, you’re 
doing something right!
 
Happiness scores fluctuate — more in some people than in others. Some 
people are consistently on the high end of the curve; others are typically on 
the low end. To track your HQ scores over time, rate yourself at the same time 
every day for 30 days. Make a few notations each day alongside your score so 
that, when you’re finished, you can go back and compare what was happening 
in your life on those days when you were the happiest versus those when you 
weren’t. Think of it as a happiness log.

E
very time my wife, Catherine, decides to make her legendary layered 
vegetable salad, it’s a happy day for friends, family, even strangers. This 
salad is not some simple lettuce-and-tomatoes concoction — it’s a carefully 
prepared mixture of 12 separate ingredients that, when combined, make for 
some very enjoyable eating.
Catherine’s salad recipe
 1. Layer the following vegetables in a tall 
bowl in the following order:
 
 1 small head of lettuce, shredded
 
  1⁄2 cup to 3⁄4 cup sliced celery
 
 1⁄2 cup to 3⁄4 cup chopped green pepper
 
 1 can sliced water chestnuts, drained
 
 1 small, red onion, sliced and broken into 
rings
 
 1 package frozen green peas, cooked until 
thawed and heated throughout
 2. Cover with 2 cups mayonnaise.
 3. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon sugar.
 4. Top with a heavy layer of grated Romano 
cheese.
 5. Refrigerate overnight or at least eight 
hours.
 6. When you’re ready to serve, garnish with 
the following:
 
 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
 
 4 medium-size tomatoes, diced
 
 1⁄2 pound crisp bacon, crumbled

28
Part I: Defining Happiness 
And, so it is with happiness. In fact, a salad is the perfect metaphor for happi-
ness, which is the end result of at least eight different components of psycho-
logical experience. As I explain in this chapter, some of these (like safety) are 
primary ingredients, while others (such as gratitude and a sense of satisfac-
tion) are important add-ons that enrich the happiness.
This chapter shows you just how close you are to that perfect psychological 
salad called happiness.
The Four Basic Ingredients
The foundation for true happiness consists of four basic ingredients:
 
 A feeling of safety
 
 A sense of satiation
 
 A sense of perspective
 
 Quietude
These four ingredients are essential if your goal is happiness. You can’t 
make chicken soup or chicken salad without chicken to start with. But your 
neighbor may put things in his chicken salad that you can’t imagine putting 
in yours. Think of these four items as the chicken, and the ingredients later in 
this chapter as all the optional stuff that you can choose to add or leave out.
Safety
Not everyone lives in a safe world. There are unsafe neighborhoods, where 
crime is rampant and all the windows have bars. There are unsafe relationships, 
where a person’s odds of being harmed — physically and/or emotionally — are 
exceedingly high. And, not everyone has a safety net when it comes to finan-
cial problems. Feeling unsafe carries with it fear, uncertainty, and bodily 
tension — hardly a context in which you can expect to be happy.
I once asked my friend Tony if he’d had a happy childhood. He said, “Well, yes 
and no.” When he was at home with his biological family, Tony was never really 
happy. His father was an unpredictable alcoholic — sometimes violent — and 
his mother vacillated between episodes of loving behavior and sudden attacks 
of rage. All the time he was with his family, Tony was tense, cautious, anxious, 
always waiting for things to change from good to not-so-good.
On the other hand, when Tony spent time with his aunt and uncle, who had 
no children of their own, he was immensely happy. Why? Because his aunt 
and uncle were good-natured people, who always seemed happy to have him 

29
 Chapter 2: The Recipe for Happiness
around. “I honestly don’t ever remember either one of them getting angry, 
much less losing their temper,” he said, adding, “If things were good, they 
stayed good.” Ironically, Tony felt safer — and happier — with his aunt and 
uncle than he did with his own parents.
How safe do you feel? If you don’t feel safe, you’re not happy.
Satiation
In simple terms, satiation means being full. A happy person is someone who, 
at least at this moment, is full. She has had enough of something (or things) 
she values.
You may be asking yourself, “But who decides when you have enough of 
something?” You do. It’s just that simple. You, and only you, are the arbiter of 
how much is enough. If nothing is ever enough for you, your search for happi-
ness is one without end!
Seeking happiness can be like walking on a treadmill. You tell yourself, “If 
only I had a boyfriend, I’d be happy.” Then, after you get the boyfriend, you 
find yourself thinking, “If only we were married, I’d be happy.” After you get 
married, you think, “If only I had kids, I’d be happy.” In other words, happi-
ness is always one step away from where you’re standing.
Take a minute and ask yourself this question: Which of the things I value in 
life do I have enough of and which do I not?
When enough isn’t enough
Eddie worked hard his whole life and, in the 
process, amassed a tidy retirement nest egg — 
several million dollars to be exact. But he’s still 
out there literally killing himself working every 
day at age 68. At least twice a month, he calls 
his long-time financial advisor and, in a tone of 
desperation, says, “Do I have enough money set 
aside to retire? My wife’s on my back, wanting 
me to stop working and just enjoy our remaining 
years together.”
His advisor — with great exasperation — tells 
him, “Of course, you do — you can live quite 
handsomely on the interest the money earns 
and leave the principal to your kids or whom-
ever you want.” Eddie remains unconvinced, 
and he continues to push himself day after day 
while his wife travels, enjoys their lovely new 
home on the lake, and visits with their children 
and grandchildren. For some reason, Eddie isn’t 
ready yet to say enough is enough — and, he 
isn’t ready to be happy.
It takes real courage to reach a point in life 
where you declare for all to hear, “Enough is 
enough!”  In other words, it takes courage to 
let yourself be happy.

30
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
No one has everything he wants. You may have enough money, but not 
enough friends. You may have plenty of friends, but not enough money. You 
can be happy even if your life isn’t 100 percent “full,” but you can’t be happy if 
your life is empty.
Perspective
Finding happiness requires that you take a step back from life and reflect on 
the bigger picture of what your life is all about. That’s called perspective — 
and, in today’s hectic world, not many of us have it! We’re far too busy climb-
ing or cutting down the trees in front of us to have any sense of the forest as 
a whole. What we really need is an aerial view of our own lives. Happiness, 
after all, is not about what you’re doing at the moment — it’s about the 
impact of what you’re doing on your life, positive or negative. If the impact is 
positive, happiness follows. If it’s negative, unhappiness follows.
What does your forest look like? Is it lush and green, or does it resemble 
something wrecked and ruined by the logging crew?
Quietude
Happiness cannot find you amidst a lot of noise — it finds you when you’re in 
a quiet place or circumstance. You need a place where you can get in touch 
with the other three basic elements of achieving happiness, someplace where 
you can appreciate how safe you feel, where you can see how satiated you 
are, and where it’s not so difficult to achieve some perspective. You have to 
get off the proverbial treadmill of daily life, stop running with the bulls (the 
ones that wear suits and ties, not the four-legged kind!), and give it a rest.
You may be able to find quietude in the following places:
 
 In a library
 
 In the sanctuary of a church, cathedral, synagogue, temple, or mosque
 
 On a walking trail through the forest
 
 At an out-of-the-way table in a small, quiet restaurant
 
 By the pool, when no one else is around
 
 On the beach, early in the morning or late in the day
 
 On the drive home after a long, hard day at the office
 
 On a long road trip
 
 In a lovely garden

31
 Chapter 2: The Recipe for Happiness
Here are places where you likely won’t find quietude:
 
 In a noisy restaurant
 
 At a popular bar
 
 In the middle of a college football stadium on Saturday afternoon
 
 At a wedding
 
 In a place where you’re competing with others
 
 At your office
 
 Running from place to place in a busy airport
 
 Fighting to maintain your place in line for coveted concert tickets
 
 In a car with hyperactive kids
 
What you’re looking for is a place where you can hear yourself think, free of 
distractions or responsibilities. Ideally, you want to be able to spend at least 
20 minutes a day in quietude. It doesn’t have to be in the same place every 
day, though — one day you may find your quietude in your garden, the next 
it may be at the beach. The important thing isn’t where you find the quietude, 
it’s that you find it in the first place, because, without it, you’ll have trouble 
being happy.
The Rest of the Mix
The four ingredients I cover earlier in this chapter are essential to any happi-
ness recipe. But after you’ve tossed those four ingredients into your mixing 
bowl, you can choose to add a dash of this or a splash of that. The “this” and 
the “that” are what I cover in this section.
The perfect happiness recipe would incorporate the four basics plus all five 
add-ons in this section. You can still experience less complete feelings of hap-
piness, however, with even one or two of these additional ingredients.
Satisfaction
Satisfaction is not the same as satiation (which is one of the four key ingre-
dients). Satiation is feeling that you have enough of the things you value. 
Satisfaction (some people prefer to think of it as contentment) is the sense 
of fulfillment or comfort that can, but doesn’t always, accompany satiation.

32
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Ever gone into a restaurant hungry and eaten until your stomach couldn’t 
hold any more? That’s an example of satiation — you’ve had enough food. 
Now, answer me this: How did you feel when your stomach got that full? If 
you felt satisfied — content that your stomach was full — you weren’t look-
ing for anything more to eat. But, what if your head was telling you, “As full as 
I am right this minute, I sure could go for a piece of pie”? If that sounds famil-
iar, you may have been satiated (full), but you were far from satisfied.
How satisfied are you with your current life situation?
Pleasure
Happiness is a pleasurable experience. It’s the feel-good emotion. Generally, 
you’ll have an easier time finding happiness when you’re leading a life that 
pleases you. If you hear someone say, “I’d do this job even if they didn’t pay 
me,” you’re listening to someone who derives great pleasure in her work. If 
you look at your husband and think, “I wouldn’t trade him for all the money 
in the world,” you’re obviously pleased with the person you go to bed with 
every night and wake up next to each morning.
The pleasures of everyday life come from both being and doing. Here are 
some examples of the kind of pleasure that comes from doing:
 
 Doing a good deed
 
 Doing a good job when others don’t
 
 Doing something because it’s right, not because it’s popular
 
 Doing the difficult things in life, like visiting a sick friend in the hospital 
or loaning money to a loved one knowing full well that he’ll never pay 
you back
An inspiration
My recently departed mother lived the last 
20 years of her life solely on Social Security, 
which amounted to around $1,000 per month. 
After paying her bills — which she was faithful 
about doing — she had only about $75 to $100 of 
discretionary money. Her bank account wasn’t 
full by any means. But, every time my brothers 
and I tried to help her out, she politely refused, 
telling us, in no uncertain terms, “Thanks, but I’ll 
get by.” My mother wasn’t satiated (she didn’t 
have enough where money was concerned), 
but she was satisfied (she was happy with what 
she had).
You can be satiated but not satisfied and you 
can be satisfied without being satiated. You can 
be both or you can be neither. They’re two very 
different things.

33
 Chapter 2: The Recipe for Happiness
 
 Doing something until it’s completed
 
 Doing a favor without being asked
 
 Doing something without being compensated
And here are the kinds of pleasures that come from being:
 
 Being healthy
 
 Being compassionate to those in need
 
 Being true to your word
 
 Being a good friend
 
 Being faithful in intimate relationships
 
 Being articulate and expressing yourself well to others
 
 Being tough or tender depending on the circumstances
 
Make a list of as many things as you can think of that please you. Now ask 
yourself this crucial question: When was the last time I was being that person 
or doing those things?
Gratitude
If there is one extra ingredient that comes the closest to insuring happiness, 
it’s gratitude. Gratitude is simply the readiness and willingness to show 
appreciation for those things that bring pleasure into your life. (See how 
interconnected these ingredients are?) Gratitude is the “thank-you” feeling 
that some people have throughout the day.
Gratitude is the opposite of entitlement — the idea that you deserve or are 
owed something from life (see Chapter 22). Entitlement has to do with what 
you feel is expected (or required) from others; gratitude is your response to 
the unexpected. When you eat out in a restaurant, do you say “thank you” 
every time the waiter refills your coffee or tea, or do you simply expect that 
he’ll do that as part of his job and let his behavior go unnoticed?
Helen and Kate are both midlevel managers at the same company. They 
each earn six-figure salaries. When the year-end bonuses are handed out, 
each gets a check for $2,500. Kate had expected much more, given how hard 
she worked throughout the year, so she’s disappointed and ungrateful. She 
tells her boss “thank you,” but the tone of her voice and the look on her face 
convey her true feelings: Kate is very unhappy. Helen, on the other hand, 
long ago vowed to herself that she would never expect a bonus. So, she’s 
thrilled with the $2,500, thinking of the trip she and her husband can take 
with the extra money. Who are you more like — Helen or Kate?

34
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
Begin each new day of your life with a few minutes of quiet reflection about all 
the things you have to be grateful for, and then, either silently to yourself or 
out loud, say thank-you for each item on the list. Trust me, there’s no better 
way to start your day and open yourself up to the possibility of happiness.
Serenity
Serenity has to do with peace of mind. Happiness can’t find its way into a 
mind cluttered by worry, anxieties, anger, stress, and who knows what else. 
Quietude is about finding a quiet place; serenity is about having a quiet mind. 
Of course, you’ll have an easier time finding serenity in a place of quietude.
Like most young professionals, Elizabeth isn’t able to experience a feeling of 
serenity the moment she first sets foot on the beach. Because of all the resid-
ual clutter in her mind about things left undone at the office and things that 
will need her urgent attention as soon as she returns from vacation, it typically 
takes at least three or four days walking the beaches, sleeping late, and enjoy-
ing a good novel before she begins to relax and feel a sense of inner peace. 
Because Elizabeth has learned this about herself, she’s smart and allows her-
self two full weeks at the beach. Before she came to this realization, just about 
the time she found serenity, it was time to pack up the car and head home.
 
Meditation is an excellent way to find serenity. Pick up a copy of Meditation 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephan Bodian (Wiley), to get started.
Well-being
Common sense will tell you that it’s easier to be happy when you’re feeling 
healthy or well than it is to feel happy when you’re sick. (Of course, it isn’t 
impossible for human beings to experience happiness when they’re not well — 
it’s just more difficult.)
I’ve spent the last 40 years of my career observing and treating men and 
women who suffer from one or another type of chronic, unremitting, mus-
culoskeletal pain (for example, chronic back pain). One interesting thing 
I’ve learned is that the one area of activity that these folks give up soon 
after injury is the kind having to do with social and recreational interests. 
Ironically, they’re more apt to continue engaging in household chores (vacu-
uming, preparing meals, washing clothes — all of which aggravate their pain) 
than they are to continue visiting family and friends, going to watch their 
grandkids play sports, or attending church. This leads me to conclude that 
the real reason that 70 percent of chronic-pain patients suffer from depres-
sion is not because of the pain itself, but because they’ve chosen to termi-
nate all activities that previously brought pleasure into their lives. In our 

35
 Chapter 2: The Recipe for Happiness
rehabilitation program, we work to help them resume (or find substitutes for) 
pleasure-giving activities that they can do even in their reduced state of well-
being. And guess what? Suddenly, we’re surrounded by happy pain patients.
 
Modern science has proven that peppermint and lavender both serve to 
increase subjective feelings of well-being, increase feelings of relaxation, and 
lead to more positive mood states. Tea, anyone?
 
You may need some professional assistance in order to achieve happiness 
if you’re not well physically or mentally. Don’t be afraid to tell your doctor 
that you’re unhappy and ask her to refer you to someone who has a back-
ground in health psychology or behavioral medicine (such as a psychologist).
How Close Are You?
If you want to know how close you are to happiness, I’ve created a little self-
assessment you can do. Remember: Be honest with yourself — otherwise the 
exercise won’t be helpful.
Circle one answer under each of the following questions:
 
1. Generally speaking, how safe and secure do you feel in your everyday 
life?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• A little: 2
 
• Fairly safe: 3
 
• Very safe: 4
 
2. All things considered, do you feel you have enough of what you need 
to be happy?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• Possibly: 2
 
• Probably: 3
 
• Absolutely: 4
 
3. Do you have moments when you look at the totality of your life rather 
than just the events of the moment?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• Occasionally: 2
 
• Regularly: 3
 
• Quite often: 4

36
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
4. How often do you find yourself in a quiet place or circumstance where 
you can have a moment of true self-reflection?
 
• Never: 1
 
• Seldom: 2
 
• Occasionally: 3
 
• Very often: 4
 
5. How satisfied are you with specific things in your life — finances, 
relationships, career?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• Somewhat: 2
 
• Moderately: 3
 
• Very much: 4
 
6. How pleased are you with your general life situation?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• A little: 2
 
• Moderately: 3
 
• Very much: 4
 
7. How grateful are you for the way your life is turning out?
 
• Not at all: 1
 
• Somewhat: 2
 
• Moderately: 3
 
• Very much: 4
 
8. How often do you have a sense of peace of mind?
 
• Never: 1
 
• Rarely: 2
 
• Occasionally: 3
 
• Much of the time: 4
 
9. How would you rate your overall state of mental and physical 
well-being?
 
• Poor: 1
 
• Average: 2
 
• Above average: 3
 
• Excellent: 4

37
 Chapter 2: The Recipe for Happiness
 
10. How often do you find yourself experiencing a feeling of contentment?
 
• Never: 1
 
• Rarely: 2
 
• Occasionally: 3
 
• Very often: 4
Add up the scores. If your total score is below 20, you’re a long way from 
being a happy camper. If your score is 35 or above, you’re either already 
happy or you’re right on the verge. And if you’re in between 20 and 35, you’re 
neither happy nor miserable.
 
This is a test you should take often, both while you’re reading this book and 
afterward as you employ many of the strategies I offer in these pages. It lets 
you know whether you’re on track or off track when it comes to finding 
happiness.
 
Take a minute and more closely examine your individual answers to the ten 
questions. Focus on those you had a low score on — either a 1 or 2. These are 
the ingredients that are missing from your recipe for happiness, and they’re 
the ones you need to work on. By focusing on these missing ingredients, you 
move closer to your objective of being a happier person.

or Jake and Jim, it’s the best of times and the worst of times.
Jake is 72 and retired, and he suffers from a chronic back problem that began 
over 15 years ago. He lives with his wife of 45 years in a modest, albeit paid-
for, home. He has some retirement savings but depends a good bit on Social 
Security. Most days, he piddles around the house with minor fix-it projects 
or finds himself helping out a friend or neighbor less fortunate than himself. 
Jake was born poor, had a difficult childhood, and suffered from a learning 
disability that kept him from completing his education and forced him into 
a lifetime of blue-collar employment. And, for most of his adult life, he had 
a bad temper that strained his relationships with his wife and children. And 
yet, despite all this, Jake is quick to tell anyone who will listen that “This is 
the happiest time of my life!”
Jim is 68, is in exceptionally good health, and, like Jake, has been married for 
over 40 years. He graduated from college and has run a very successful busi-
ness for years, leaving him with a nest egg of several million dollars, a nice 
getaway cottage in the mountains, a big new home in town, and a Cadillac. 
By comparison, his life has been easy and uneventful. And he’s never had a 
problem with his temper. But Jim isn’t happy.
Why is Jake happy with so little? And why is Jim unhappy with so much? Why 
is Jim still working as hard as he ever did and worrying incessantly about 
having enough money? Why hasn’t he spent any time at his mountain retreat 
in the past three years? Why doesn’t he travel and do more fun things with 
his wife, who’s enjoying her retirement years?

40
Part I: Defining Happiness 
In this chapter, I answer those questions. If you’re like me, you tend to con-
fuse happiness with culturally valued outcomes such as wealth, power, and 
success. This chapter eliminates that confusion! As the title suggests, it tells 
you where not to look for happiness.
What Money Really Buys
A recent headline in a newspaper says it all: “Market lapse makes way into 
retirees’ homes.” The article goes on to say that when the stock market goes 
down, people on fixed incomes suffer — they forego dinners out, do with less 
heat in the winter, and buy more store-brand items in the grocery store. Does 
that mean that they’re unhappy? No — but it does mean they’re less comfort-
able and less free to live their lives the way they may want to.
I’m not here to tell you that money doesn’t matter. It does. But it doesn’t buy 
happiness. In this section, I cover the things that money does buy.
Comfort
Money buys physical comfort. That’s true for everything from paper prod-
ucts to underwear and furniture. I learned early in my married life that the 
The richest man I ever met
Most people measure wealth in dollars and 
cents. In my opinion, another measure of wealth 
is how many people show up at your funeral.
For years, I had a next-door neighbor, Marion, 
who would do anything for you. He’d give you 
the shirt off his back — all you had to do was 
ask. He was a man of modest means. He never 
made a great deal of money, but he was still 
generous. The last years of his life, Marion 
suffered from progressive heart disease. He 
dropped dead in the middle of a conversation 
with friends and family at the beach.
His funeral was truly impressive! There were 
hundreds of people there — so many that the 
church couldn’t hold them all. When it came 
time for those in attendance to say a few words 
about Marion, people couldn’t wait to get up 
and give testimony to how he had impacted 
their lives in some positive way — people 
young and old, friends from World War II and 
recent acquaintances, neighbors like myself 
and members of his church softball team, dig-
nitaries from Duke University Medical Center, 
and on and on.
As I sat there listening to their words and qui-
etly remembering this good man, I couldn’t help 
but think, “He’s the richest man I ever met.”

41
 Chapter 3: Knowing What Happiness Isn’t
more comfortable a sofa is, the more it costs. The more comfortable the 
ambience in a restaurant, the more expensive the entrees. If you’ve ever slept 
on silk sheets and overstuffed pillows, worn expensive Italian loafers, or driven 
a Mercedes, you know what I’m talking about.
But comfort does not equal happiness. If it did, I wouldn’t have counseled so 
many wealthy people — lawyers, doctors, businesspeople — over the last 40 
years. Take Martin, for example, a 43-year-old man, who wears $2,000 suits, 
drives a $75,000 car, and brags about his two vacation homes — yet finds 
himself hopelessly depressed. Or Emily, who inherited a family fortune early 
in life only to find herself miserable and without any real friends in her late 
50s. They both live very comfortable lives — but they aren’t happy.
Support
Money also buys you emotional comfort in the form of support during trying 
times. That’s what lawyers, accountants, life coaches, financial advisers, psy-
chotherapists, bartenders, political consultants, publicists, and — if you’re a 
celebrity — “handlers” are all about. In one way or another, they’re all paid 
to help you handle your problems — financial, emotional, or legal. The more 
support you have at your disposal, obviously the easier it is to navigate the 
troubles of everyday life.
Here’s the kinds of support that money can buy:
 
 Emotional support: A life coach or therapist who is behind you 100 per-
cent and cheers you on through adversity.
 
 Informational support: An accountant who provides you with critical 
information on how to minimize your tax burden.
 
 Tangible support: Hands-on support, like an attorney who will come 
down and get you out of jail or a maid to clean your home.
 
 Appraisal support: Your family physician, who levels with you about 
your odds of having a heart attack if you continue smoking and don’t 
lose weight.
Freedom
Money buys economic freedom:
 
 Freedom from financial worry
 
 Freedom to pursue life on your own terms, instead of settling for what 
comes along

42
Part I: Defining Happiness 
 
 Freedom to take risks — for example, to quit a well-paying job in the cor-
porate world in order to start your own small business, where you give 
the orders instead of always taking them
 
 Freedom to vacation when and where you want rather than where you 
can afford
 
 Freedom to live life according to your wants rather than your needs
 
 Freedom to get the best healthcare possible
 
 Freedom to be generous to those you love as well as those in need
 
 Freedom to stand up for your convictions without fear of retribution — 
for example, losing your job
 
 Freedom to have as many children as you want
 
 Freedom to shop in the best retail shops
 
 Freedom from debt
 
 Freedom from the time constraints of a 9-to-5 job
 
If you want to know exactly how much economic freedom you have in your life 
these days, list your assets (everything you own outright) and your liabilities 
(everything you owe) and come up with your net worth. I can’t promise you’ll 
be happy with what you find out, but at least you’ll know where you stand.
The Elixirs of Modern-Day Life
An elixir is a remedy for what ails you. In modern-day life, that comes down 
to three things: power, success, and excitement. If you have enough of these, 
you’re bound to be happy, right? Wrong! In this section, I tell you why.
Power
Power means different things to different people. Political power, for exam-
ple, has to do with influencing the vote at election time or which laws get 
enacted in your community or state. Economic power is the power of the 
purse — as is evident when an abusive husband controls his wife’s daily life 
by only allowing her to spend money on the things that he values. There’s 
power of attorney, power of the press, police powers, and physical power, 
which far too many people use to intimidate others. There’s social power — 
often referred to as status (which, along with income, separates the “haves” 
and the “have-nots”).

43
 Chapter 3: Knowing What Happiness Isn’t
In the end, all forms of power involve having control over the world around 
you — something we all seek and aspire to, whether we realize it or not. 
Ironically, however, those with the most power often end up being the least 
happy. Here’s an example:
The CEO of a local corporation — one that did over $40 million dollars 
worth of business annually — visited my office a couple of years ago, 
asking for my help. His problem: “I’m tired of being a referee in physical 
confrontations between my top executives. Twice in the last month, I’ve 
had to get in between two of my vice presidents who were slugging it out 
in the executive men’s room. I don’t have time for this crap!”
The man was perplexed about the boorish behavior of his most power-
ful employees, given the fact that he paid them each a six-figure salary 
with all kinds of perks and gave them the kind of freedom to operate not 
often seen in most companies. He hired me to meet with his entire exec-
utive staff for three consecutive Saturday-morning anger-management 
workshops. What an experience that was — talk about some unhappy 
people!
It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what their problem was: 
They were all trying too hard to control each other in the course of 
everyday business. I gave them all a little test to measure how aggres-
sive they were — both in terms of achieving goals and engaging in 
demanding or confrontational behavior. I concluded that the odds 
of any 2 of these 11 executives having an interaction that wasn’t a 
power struggle were zero — that’s right, zero. These guys were 
literally trying to kill each other!
 
The very characteristic that enables people to rise up the corporate ladder to 
positions of power — aggressiveness — can also lead to their eventual down-
fall and a lot of unhappiness along the way.
Success
Power and success are two sides of the same coin. Success is a relative 
concept — it means you’re doing better and accomplishing more than the 
people you’re competing with.
The successful salesperson belongs to the Million Dollar Club no matter what 
she’s selling. The successful stock broker makes more money for his clients 
than all the other brokers. The most successful people in society end up 
wealthy, famous, on the covers of magazines, and, in a few cases, with the 
Nobel Prize or Pulitzer Prize on their living room mantles.

44
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Success, however, is sometimes accompanied by misfortune and tragedy. Ernest 
Hemingway, the American novelist, was without doubt highly successful — and 
he ended up killing himself. Martha Stewart, one of the most successful business-
women of our time, ended up serving a prison sentence. Winston Churchill and 
Abraham Lincoln — both successful political figures — suffered from chronic 
depression their whole lives.
In short, success is no antidote to misery and misfortune, nor is it a guarantee 
of happiness.
Excitement
You want excitement, go to Las Vegas, New York, Paris, London, Hong Kong, 
Hollywood . . . anyplace where there’s lots of action, brouhaha, energy, com-
motion, enthusiasm, tension, and passion. Go with whatever turns on your 
nervous system and pumps your body full of adrenaline and your brain full of 
dopamine. Gamble until you’re broke, shop ’til you drop, eat until your stom-
ach is in pain, dance until your feet lose all feeling.
Problem is, excitement can create the illusion of happiness. My wife and I 
love to visit Las Vegas, even though neither of us gambles. While we’re there, 
I always enjoy listening to people on the streets, late at night, laughing and 
telling each other how much fun they had losing all their money: “Did you see 
me at the blackjack table? I lost over $600! Can you believe that? I’m gonna 
hate myself in the morning, but damn that was fun!” Excited? Yes. Happy? No.
 
Make a list of ten things that excite you. Referring to the definition of happi-
ness in Chapter 2, ask yourself how happy you feel after doing each of these 
things — how grateful you feel, how satisfied you are, how much contentment 
and serenity you feel.
What they don’t say in the introduction
When I conduct workshops, I always enjoy 
being introduced by someone who recounts all 
of my many successes early in my academic 
career — administrative head of this, founding 
editor of that, author of this, that, and the other. 
It’s like a stroll down memory lane.
But what they don’t tell the audience in the intro-
duction is the price I paid for all that success — 
a nervous breakdown at age 45 that lasted for 
five unhappy years. I learned the hard way that 
too much of anything can be harmful — even 
success.

45
 Chapter 3: Knowing What Happiness Isn’t
The Problem with the Abundant Life
Between 1957 and 2005, the average income of Americans rose by a whop-
ping 278 percent, yet the percentage of those who described themselves as 
“very happy” remained virtually the same — around 30 percent. This find-
ing alone has convinced happiness researchers that a lifestyle of increased 
income has little effect on how positive a person feels.
There are three possible explanations for this:
 
 The hedonic treadmill effect: Each time you reach a new level of 
achievement, you adjust your level of neutrality — the point at which 
you feel neither positive nor negative about the world around you. And, 
then it takes something more to make you happy. In effect, you’re com-
paring what you have today with what you had yesterday, and it’s the 
change that leads to happiness, not the absolute level.
 
 If you make $30,000 a year, a $5,000 raise makes you happy — but only for a 
while. You quickly get used to making $35,000 per year, and now you won’t 
be happy until you get bumped up to $43,000. And so it goes, on and on and 
on. People on the hedonic treadmill are never truly happy with what they 
have — they always want more. And there is always more to want.
 
 Relative deprivation: People are constantly comparing themselves to 
other people — typically those who have more than they do — and they 
come away with a feeling of being relatively deprived when it comes to 
those things they think make them happy.
 
 For example, instead of being satisfied and grateful (see Chapter 2) 
that you live in a house twice the size of the one you grew up in and 
that your parents still live in, you end up feeling unhappy because your 
house is smaller than your neighbor’s.
 
 If you find yourself often making comparisons between your lifestyle and 
other people’s lifestyles, make sure you spend as much time  comparing 
your situation to those less well off than you are, too. That way, you’ll be 
much more content and grateful with what you have.
 
 Escalating needs: Human beings unfortunately have a shifting and — all 
too often — escalating sense of what they perceive they need to be satis-
fied with life. Simply put, the more you get, the more you want! It’s not a 
conscious, deliberate thing — most people are unaware of this aspect of 
human nature. But it’s there in the back of your mind, working on you — 
and, keeping you from being happy — all the time.
 
Negative emotions like envy, jealousy, greed, and resentment (see Chapter 22) 
are the emotional by-products of these types of unhealthy comparisons. It 
comes down to the fact that, instead of being happy with what you’ve got, 
you feel bad toward those who have more than you do. In effect, their success 
makes you feel less successful, their power makes you feel powerless, and their 
freedom makes you feel less free. It’s all about them!

46
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Happiness Is Not a Life-Transforming 
Experience
I wish I could tell you that one moment of happiness can transform your life 
from what it is now to something much better, but I can’t. Happiness is an 
emotion, and emotions are, by definition, short-lived — they come and go like 
waves on a beach. You’re happy, excited, joyful one minute — and the next 
minute, you’re not.
Although happiness doesn’t alter your life situation in any significant way, 
what it does is define the more prominent and uniquely positive circumstances 
of your life.
Each person is happy about different things, and those differences tell us 
something important about ourselves. For example, here are a few of the hap-
piest moments in my life:
 
 I remember, as a very small child, rolling an orange around the garage 
while my mother did the ironing. Something about watching that orange 
roll and roll or perhaps having my mother all to myself made me happy.
 
 I was very happy when I was allowed to go to the nearby Catholic school — 
even though I wasn’t Catholic. There was order in the classroom and they 
taught you more than in the public school. I know because I went to public 
school first, and it was dreadful!
 
 I was super-happy when my older brother joined the armed services 
after graduating from high school — because for the first time in my life I 
had a bed all to myself.
 
 I was very happy when a girl I asked out on a date actually said yes! (She 
wasn’t the first one I asked out, just the first one who said yes.)
Economic recession and your health
Believe it or not, Americans actually get healthier 
as the economy gets worse — during a recession. 
Economist Christopher J. Ruhm at the University 
of North Carolina at Greensboro calculated, in 
fact, that there are 14,000 fewer deaths when 
unemployment increases by as little as 1 percent. 
Why? Because as people have more time on their 
hands and less money, they lose weight, smoke 
less, exercise more, drive less — and, thus, have 
fewer accidents — and have less contact with 
people who may have the flu.

 Chapter 3: Knowing What Happiness Isn’t
 
 I was happy when my 11th-grade English teacher read my short story to 
the whole class, adding, “This young man has a gift.”
 
 I was happy when I got engaged to my wife, who’s still my partner after 
41 years.
 
 I was happy on the days each of my wonderful children were born — 
something I had to keep in mind when they were going through their 
teen years!
 
 I’ve been happy pretty much every day since I quit using alcohol a 
decade ago.
And here are some things — albeit positive — that never made me happy 
although you could argue that they should have:
 
 Making more money than most of my peers.
 
 Getting a new car.
 
 Belonging to the country club.
 
 Having my 100th article published in a journal. The first one or two 
made me happy, but after that it was just part of the job.
 
 Getting a promotion.
 
 Watching an upturn in the stock market.
 
 Getting a new cashmere sweater.
 
Take a quiet moment to yourself, close your eyes, and recall the ten happiest 
moments of your life. Who were you with? What were you doing? Where were 
you? Write them down on a piece of paper and then listen to what they tell 
you about yourself. Then make a second list, a list of positive events or cir-
cumstances in your life that you thought would’ve made you happy but didn’t. 
What does that list tell you? What you’re looking for here are what you value, 
your priorities.
 
Happiness occurs in moments, not hours, days, weeks, months, or years. 
Sometimes the experience lasts just a few seconds; other times it lasts as 
long as a few minutes. But inevitably it disappears. The trick is to enjoy the 
moment, to relish the experience, and to be mindful that it’ll be gone before 
you know it. What I do in this book is show you how to create and have more 
of these moments than you ever have before.

Chapter 4
Seeing Happiness as a Sign, 
Not a Symptom
In This Chapter
 Listening to your nervous system
 Finding the right fit
 Asking the important questions
 Making the necessary changes
Just as negative emotions like anger and depression tell you that you’re at 
odds with your surroundings, happiness is your nervous system’s way of 
telling you that you’re living a meaningful and healthy life — that you’re right 
with the world.
To say that Matthew wasn’t happy was an understatement. It was what 
you didn’t see and hear that was most telling. Matthew never smiled and he 
seldom laughed. There was no energy in his voice and the way he moved 
suggested an attitude of apathy or indifference. Matthew had a job, but not 
one that excited him — he sat in a cubicle all day interacting with a com-
puter screen, when what he really wanted to do was be out amongst people 
promoting himself as well as some product or service that could benefit his 
fellow man. This was what he dreamed of when he had a few minutes to him-
self throughout the day. But his job paid well and the benefits were great, so 
he was “stuck” in his present circumstance. “After all,” he rationalized, “why 
take a chance on doing what I really want to do when I’ve got a sure thing?”
Matthew wasn’t depressed. He didn’t exhibit any of the symptoms you nor-
mally expect with a mood disorder — sleep problems, irritability, sadness. 
But he clearly was unhappy and that was a sign that something impor-
tant was missing from his life. His nervous system was talking to him, but 
Matthew wasn’t listening.

50
Part I: Defining Happiness 
In this chapter, I explain how emotions work and why you need them. I also 
address the question of whether a person can have too much happiness. And, 
finally, I tell you the four most important questions you’ll face in your quest 
for authentic happiness, the answers to which may literally transform your 
emotional life forever.
Feedback from Your Nervous System
Most people actually believe that they’re in total control of their behavior — 
that they call the shots and that everything they say and do throughout the 
day is willful and intentional. Well, I’ve got news for you: No one has that kind 
of control over his life.
You don’t choose or decide to be hungry or thirsty — those feelings are 
created by your nervous system, which informs you when it’s time to get a 
drink or grab something to eat. If we didn’t experience hunger or thirst, we 
might never feed and hydrate our bodies, and then we’d die. The nervous 
system —the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal 
cord) and the autonomic nervous system (which regulates emotions) — has 
only one agenda: to help you survive. That’s why you need anger and that’s 
why you need to be happy.
Survival depends on feedback between your nervous system and you. If 
you suddenly find yourself irritated, your nervous system is telling you that 
you’re exposed to some type of unwanted stress or threat — it could be 
What are you leaking?
An expert on body language commented recently 
on a cable news show about how difficult — in 
fact, impossible — it is for human beings to con-
tain emotion. She explained that whatever we’re 
feeling on the inside sooner or later will leak out 
from behind our social façade for all the world 
to see.
Examples include the angry man clenching his 
fist while he smiles and attempts to keep his 
cool, the anxious woman who wrings her hand 
at the same time she assures her family and 
friends that she’s okay, or the person whose 
facial expression suddenly turns sad whenever 
there’s a lull in the conversation.
The good news is that not everyone leaks nega-
tive feelings — some people actually leak hap-
piness. It’s evident in their smiles, their hardy 
laughter, and the twinkle in their eyes. What are 
you leaking?

51
 Chapter 4: Seeing Happiness as a Sign, Not a Symptom
something as simple as being around an annoying person or being in a 
situation where it’s too hot. If you then remove yourself from that irritating 
circumstance (walk away from the person you find annoying or turn on 
the air conditioner), this tells your nervous system that it can stop feeling 
irritated — and, it does.
The same is true for happiness. If you suddenly find yourself feeling satis-
fied, joyful, and content, that’s your nervous system talking to you. What it’s 
saying is: “This is great! This is where you want to be. This is what makes you 
happy. I like this — let’s do more of this.”
Emotions provide a means of communication between you and your nervous 
system that aids in your survival. The healthier the dialogue, the longer 
you’ll live and the better your quality of life. That’s what the word well-
being implies and why it’s so often used interchangeably with the concept 
of happiness.
The “e” in your emotion
Emotion is a two-part word. The e stands for energy and motion implies move-
ment. Together, emotions — positive or negative — are a source of emotional 
energy that constantly move you toward and away from various aspects 
of your environment. If you’re not an aggressive person, fear causes you 
to move away from whatever you’re afraid of. On the other hand, if you’re 
aggressive, fear may cause you to confront that same source of emotion. 
The same is true of anger. An aggressive person will attack when angered, 
whereas a non-aggressive person will run away from whomever or whatever 
made her mad.
We’re all energized by happiness, too. Happiness makes you want to reach 
out and hug the world! It connects people and leads to supportive relation-
ships. As I mention in Chapter 2, happiness drives you to satisfy your basic 
needs for everything from food and shelter to more complex things like social 
belonging, acceptance, and self-esteem. It drives you to find ways of feeling 
safe and satiated — to have enough of what it takes to survive.
Sad, mad, and glad
Everyone has a range of emotions. These include everything from generic 
feelings like upset or nervousness to more specific feelings such as anger, 
sadness, curiosity, guilt, disgust — and, yes, joy.

52
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Emotions are there for a reason — they’re trying to tell you something 
about the way you’re living your life. The question is, what are your 
emotions trying to tell you? If you’re happy when you’re broke, maybe 
it means that money really isn’t that important to you after all. If you and 
your partner don’t have children, but you find yourself happy whenever 
you’re around other people’s kids, maybe it’s time to start your family. 
Your job is to learn from your happy moments how to live the life you 
should ideally be living.
Sadness lets you know what you’re most attached to. If you don’t feel sad 
when your dog dies, he wasn’t really your dog. If you feel sad when you move 
from a community you’ve lived in for 25 years, then you were involved in that 
community — if you don’t feel sad, you just lived there. Emotions tell the 
story of our lives — the happy years, the sad times, the angry moments — 
in a way that cannot be captured by words alone.
 
Take a few minutes and reflect on your emotional life. Ask yourself which 
emotions seem to stand out most in your memory. Perhaps the feeling that 
comes easiest to mind is sadness or joy. Now, ask yourself if your life story 
includes a healthy balance of sad, mad, and glad, or is it skewed toward one of 
these? If you had to sum it up, would you say you’ve mostly had a happy life 
or an angry life? Now, reflect on how you’ve felt the last three months and ask 
yourself the same questions. Is there continuity between your long-term and 
short-term emotional life? If you were happier in the past than you have been 
recently, why do you think that is? Has something changed? If you’re happier 
now than in the past, what have you started doing that accounts for this posi-
tive change?
There’s No Such Thing as 
Too Much Happiness
Negative emotions can be toxic. Prolonged sadness — for example, over the 
death of a loved one — can lead to a state of depression, which can itself be 
life-threatening. (Depression is linked to the development of heart disease 
and is a risk factor for heart attacks.) Too much fear can cause people to 
become housebound (a condition known as agoraphobia, which means “fear 
of public places”), have unrelenting headaches, and develop ulcers and high 
blood pressure.

53
 Chapter 4: Seeing Happiness as a Sign, Not a Symptom
The same is true if you experience too much anger. How much anger is too 
much? In Anger Management For Dummies, I define toxic anger as anger that 
is felt on a daily basis, that is intense (7 or higher on a 10-point scale), and 
that lasts for more than 25 minutes. Why 25 minutes? Because the majority of 
people are over their anger by this time.
The good news is that positive emotions, including happiness, aren’t toxic. 
You can’t be too happy. So if you find yourself in a happy moment, be thank-
ful for it, and hope it continues beyond 25 minutes!
 
The next time you find yourself having a happy moment, rate how intense 
that feeling is on a 10-point scale (where 1 is barely happy and 10 is ecstatic) 
and time yourself to see how long that feeling lasts. The happier you are, the 
longer it should last.
Being in Sync with Your Surroundings
Your emotions are affected by the world you live in — your physical and 
social surroundings. If you’re in sync with that world, you have a much better 
chance of achieving happiness.
Take Eric, for example, a man in his early 20s who was living in New York 
after graduating from college. Eric was extremely intelligent, and he had 
managed to land a high-paying job as an economist in a large corporate firm. 
At first, he enjoyed the excitement that New York had to offer — museums, 
concerts, Broadway shows. But it wasn’t long before he found himself feeling 
lonely and missing the simplicity of the life he had known back in Virginia. 
As the months passed, Eric became more and more unhappy, until finally he 
quit his job and moved back home.
Becky, on the other hand, loves living in a big city. She moved to Washington, 
D.C., seven years ago and she can’t imagine living anywhere else — even with 
the high cost of living, traffic problems, high crime rate, and tourists clogging 
up the streets. To her, the city is home!
And then there’s Paul, who’s somewhere in the middle. He likes the simpli-
city of the small town in which he lives — very little traffic, no long waits in 
restaurants, feeling safe walking downtown at night — but he has to admit 
that there’s not much there that interests him. Paul isn’t unhappy, but he’s 
bored.

54
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Where do you stand when it comes to being in sync with your surroundings? 
Would you describe your relationship with the world around you as a tight 
fit, a loose fit, or no fit at all? In the following sections, I help you answer 
these questions.
 
It’s not essential that you be in sync with all aspects of your everyday sur-
roundings — place, people, activities, motivation — in order to experience 
happiness. But, obviously, the more in sync you are, the happier you’ll be.
Happiness is a sign that you’re 
in the right place
Physical surroundings are more important than most people realize. The 
notion that a person can be happy anywhere if he wants to simply isn’t true. 
Place matters — and, by place, I mean things such as:
 
 The country you live in
 
 The region you live in (if you live in the United States, this includes the 
South, the Midwest, the East Coast, the Pacific Northwest, and so on)
 
 The climate
 
 The size of the community
 
 The architecture
 
 The terrain (for example, mountains, beaches, desert)
 
 The amount of sunlight you’re exposed to
 
 How close you are to your neighbors
 
 The type of housing you have (for example, apartment, house, cottage, 
loft)
 
 How much noise there is
 
 How “green” the surroundings are (for example, a concrete jungle or a 
place with lots of trees and parks)
Think about where you currently live. Now, ask yourself whether you’re 
living in a place where you can be happy. If the answer is yes, then you know 
that your environment is not the root of your unhappiness. If the answer is 
no, it might be. If that’s the case, you may consider a “geographic cure” — 
move to that sunny climate you long for during the winter or a city in which 
you’d be hard pressed to feel bored.

55
 Chapter 4: Seeing Happiness as a Sign, Not a Symptom
Happiness is a sign that you’re 
with the right people
Happiness is also a by-product of the social world in which you live — the 
people who surround you. Do you need to live close to family in order to be 
happy? Do you need to live around people your own age? Are you around 
enough people day in and day out? Are these people supportive? Do the 
people you spend most of your time with share your interests — cycling, 
sports, the arts? Are you in sync intellectually with those around you? 
Are you a single person in a world where everyone you know seems to be 
married? Are you a Republican working around a bunch of Democrats or a 
Democrat working around a bunch of Republicans? The answers to these 
questions may have a lot to do with how happy you are.
Think about the people who are around you — your neighbors, co-workers, 
family, and friends. Are you living around people who make you happy? If 
so, then you know for sure that people aren’t the reason you’re unhappy. If 
not, try making some new friends or looking for happiness outside of work or 
your neighborhood. There’s no law that says you can’t move back closer to 
your family if that’ll make you happy.
Happiness is a sign that you’re 
doing the right thing
Another part of your surroundings has to do with the activities you engage 
in every day. These include domestic activities (marriage and family), 
employment activities, and community activities (like participation in 
religious activities, sports, civic organizations, and the like).
Think about how you spend your time throughout the course of a week. 
Generally speaking, are you active enough? Do you find what you do at work 
meaningful or are you just in it for the paycheck? If you have children, how 
involved are you in raising them? Do you provide any type of community 
service — for example, building houses with Habitat for Humanity, helping 
out in a soup kitchen, or working as a volunteer for the Salvation Army? Do 
you do things on a regular basis to help your neighbors? Do you serve on city 
government? Are you a scout leader or a coach for a Little League team? Are 
you a mentor for kids who are having trouble in school? Or do you spend the 
majority of your time sitting at home, watching television, and heading to the 
kitchen every 30 minutes for another beer or bag of chips?

56
Part I: Defining Happiness 
Ask yourself whether you’re doing things that make you happy. If you 
answered yes, then it’s a no-brainer: Keep doing those things. If you 
answered no, try out some new activities — including some of those that I 
mention in the preceding paragraph.
Happiness is a sign that you’re doing 
things for the right reasons
In order to be happy, you not only have to be doing the right things, in the 
right place, with the right people — you also have to have the right motives 
for doing what you do. If the only reason you play golf with friends from work 
is so you can show them that your game is far superior to theirs — and you 
couldn’t care less about the camaraderie — then my guess is you’ll win, but 
winning won’t make you happy. If you show up at your kid’s baseball game 
only because your spouse will be angry with you if you don’t, that’s not the 
right reason. If you help a neighbor only because you think that means she’ll 
be obligated to help you out sometime in the future, you’re not really a good — 
or happy — neighbor.
Making change where change counts
I can’t tell you how many people I know who’ve 
made a dramatic change in their lives only to 
regret it later on. For example, one morning, 
Ramon abruptly left his wife of 30 years — he 
walked out the door, suitcase in hand, saying, 
“I’m taking some things over to my new apart-
ment now, and I’ll be back later this afternoon to 
get the rest.” His wife, unaware that her husband 
was that unhappy or contemplating divorce, was 
devastated. Ramon made changes — he dyed his 
hair, bought an expensive set of golf clubs, grew 
a mustache, changed his entire wardrobe to look 
younger, and basically alienated himself from his 
three grown children.
Was he happy after making all these changes? 
No, because he wasn’t making change where 
change counts. Ramon’s wife wasn’t the 
problem — the problem was that Ramon had a 
lot of pent-up anger and resentment about fail-
ures and losses in his life, he was clearly 
depressed, and he was lonely. Golf clubs and a 
mustache can’t fix that!
Reading Happiness For Dummies can help you 
decide where you need to make changes in 
your life in order to be happy. You can begin by 
focusing on those personality attributes — 
optimism, hardiness, and conscientiousness — 
that facilitate a sense of joy and well-being 
(Chapters 5–7). Then, you can start behaving 
more in ways that produce happiness — for 
example, getting in the flow, finding benefit in 
life’s many challenges, and living a coherent 
and confident lifestyle (Chapters 8–12). Next, 
you can start re-engineering your life so that 
it’s more balanced in terms of work-play activ-
ities, socialization verses solitude, and selfish-
ness versus generosity (Chapters 13–17). These 
are the changes that really count — the other 
things are only cosmetic!

57
 Chapter 4: Seeing Happiness as a Sign, Not a Symptom
 
Look at what you’re doing — all the activities of your life (from work to fun 
and everything in between) — and ask yourself, “Why?” Are you doing things 
with and for other people for the right reasons? If you answered yes, there’s 
nothing to change. And if you answered no, you need to come up with another 
reason for doing the same thing — for example, “I want to go to my kid’s 
ball games so he’ll have some positive memories of me when I’m no longer 
around” or “Golf is a great form of exercise — a lot easier than going to a gym 
and killing myself on the treadmill.”
Never Pass Up an Opportunity
You may not realize it, but life provides you with lots of opportunities for 
constructive change — the chance to correct things and get it right.
What determines whether change represents an opportunity or a curse is not 
the change itself, but rather what you do as a result of the change. If you get 
fired from a job you hate, and you decide to find another job that’s more to 
your liking, your life will be a lot happier. If you choose, instead, to find another 
job just like the one you lost, you won’t be happier. It’s really up to you.
 
Take a few minutes to think about your life and ask yourself, “How many 
opportunities have I had to change my life for the better?” Try to picture each 
of these times in your mind and remember exactly how you responded to 
those opportunities. Were they missed opportunities or did you turn your life 
in a new direction? Maybe you missed these opportunities because you were 
too pessimistic about the future (see Chapter 5) or you were thinking of these 
situations as catastrophes rather than opportunities (see Chapter 6). If you’re 
the type of person who has, in the past, made good use of forced opportuni-
ties (ones that you wouldn’t have chosen for yourself), then you’re in good 
shape for dealing with whatever comes your way next.

Part II
Personality 
Attributes That 
Lead to Happiness

In this part . . .
I 
share with you insights from the emerging field of posi-
tive psychology that will help you build toward the 
experience of happiness. If you want to be happy, it sure 
helps to be a “glass half-full” type of person — if you think 
you can be happy, you can!
In this part, you discover how to engage in what psycholo-
gists and psychiatrists call transformational coping (trans-
lation: “making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear”). And you 
begin to appreciate how being an ethical, honest, trust-
worthy person pays off when it comes to happiness. 
Bottom line: Your emotions — anger or happiness — 
reflect the kind of character you have and the person you 
truly are — it’s like a reflection in the mirror of life.
If you’re starting to realize that you’re not an optimistic, 
hardy, and/or conscientious person, don’t worry — it’s 
not too late! The strategies I set forth in these three chap-
ters can help you begin to develop these positive traits.

Chapter 5
Optimism
In This Chapter
 Quantifying optimism
 Winning the battle of negative expectations
 Moving beyond pessimism
H
appy people always see the glass as half-full — they’re optimists! No 
matter what they encounter in their daily lives — disappointment, 
illness, tragedy — they invariably see the possibilities for a positive future. 
Optimists expect to solve problems successfully, accomplish their goals, and, 
most important, expect to be happy.
In this chapter, I show you how to transform your world view — the way you 
perceive and think about your future — from one of cynicism and pessimism 
(“If something bad can happen, it will!”) to a more refreshing, positive outlook 
full of hope and promise (“Things usually work out the way I want them to”).
Why does optimism matter? Because if your future looks rosy, being happy in 
the present is easier.
What’s So Good about Optimism?
Beyond the simple reality that optimists are happier people (and happiness 
is what you’re striving for), optimism has other benefits as well:
 
 Optimists enjoy a greater degree of academic success than pessimists 
do. Because optimistic students think it’s possible for them to make a 
good grade, they study hardier and they study smarter. They manage 
the setting in which they study (choosing the library over the dorm 
room) and they seek help from others (fellow students, teachers) when 
they need it. (Optimism, it turns out, is almost as predictive of how well 
students do in college as the SAT — another reason not to be discour-
aged if you didn’t knock the socks off the SAT.)

62
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
 
 Optimists are less likely to become compulsive gamblers than pes-
simists are. Optimists are realists and they understand that, when it 
comes to wagering bets, the odds always favor the house. Pessimistic 
gamblers (which is what most gamblers are) believe in “long shots” 
more than they do their own ability to achieve success the “old-fash-
ioned way” through hard work and individual initiative. When optimists 
lose, they quit gambling. Pessimists, on the other hand, dwell on their 
losses and continue gambling — which actually increases the odds 
of losing — in an attempt to break even. And it doesn’t work!
 
 Optimists tend to set more specific goals than pessimists do (for exam-
ple, “I want to increase my sales by 20 percent this year”). The more 
specific and concrete your goals are, the more likely you’ll be to achieve 
success. The optimistic student has a goal of making a B+ average this 
semester; the pessimistic student simply wants to “do well” in school. 
Similarly, when it comes to achieving happiness, you’re better off having 
goals such as “I want to engineer a better balance between work and 
play” (Chapter 15) or “I want to double the number of uplifting experi-
ences I have week in and week out” (Chapter 13) than something as non-
specific as “I want to be happy.”
 
 Optimists are more self-confident than pessimists are. They believe in 
themselves more than fate. (They also bet on themselves more than they 
bet on the horses!)
 
 Optimists are more likely to be problem-solvers than pessimists are. 
When pessimistic students get a D on a test, they tend to think things 
like: “I knew I shouldn’t have taken this course. I’m no good at psychol-
ogy. I’m just wasting my time — and my parents’ money.” The optimistic 
student who gets a D says to herself, “I can do better than this. I just 
didn’t study enough for this test. That’s something I can remedy. I’ll do 
better next time.” And she will!
 
 Optimists persist and persevere. They’re not quitters!
 
 Optimists are more active in their pursuit of happiness than pessimists 
are. Are you waiting for happiness to find you? If so, I’m afraid you’re a 
pessimist. If you know that happiness is out there, somewhere in your 
future, and you’re willing to hunt for it (to use the strategies set forth in 
Happiness For Dummies), you’re an optimist. It’s as simple as that.
 
 Optimists welcome second chances after they fail more than pessi-
mists do. Optimistic golfers always take a mulligan (a redo swing with-
out penalty). Why? Because they expect to achieve a better result the 
second time around.
 
 Optimists are more socially outgoing than pessimists are. I love that 
line from the movie As Good As It Gets, when Carol Connelly (Helen 
Hunt) asks Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) why he wants a relationship 
with her, and he says, “You make me want to be a better man.” Socially 
outgoing folks believe that the time they spend with other human beings 

63
 Chapter 5: Optimism
makes them better in some way — smarter, more interesting, more 
attractive. Unfortunately, pessimists see little, if any, benefit from ven-
turing out into the social world.
 
 Optimists are not as lonely as pessimists are. Because pessimists don’t 
see as much benefit from socializing with others, they have far fewer 
social and emotional connections in their lives, which is what loneliness 
is all about. (I make the distinction between being alone and being lonely 
in Chapter 16.)
 
 Optimists utilize social support more effectively than pessimists do. 
They aren’t afraid to reach out in times of need.
 
 Optimists are less likely to blame others for their misfortune than 
pessimists are. When you blame someone else for your troubles, what 
you’re really saying is, “You’re the cause of my problem and, therefore, 
you have to be the solution as well.” Optimists have just as many trou-
bles as pessimists throughout life — they just accept more responsibil-
ity for dealing with their misfortune.
 
 Optimists engage in safer sex than pessimists do. Studies show that gay 
men who have an optimistic outlook tend to practice safer sex — fewer 
partners, condom use — than gay men who are pessimistic (you might 
say fatalistic) about their chances of contracting and transmitting HIV.
 
 Optimists cope with stress better than pessimists do. Pessimists worry, 
optimists act. A patient with coronary heart disease who is pessimistic 
“hopes and prays” that he doesn’t have another heart attack anytime 
soon. The optimistic heart patient leaves little to chance — instead, he 
exercises regularly, practices his meditation exercises, adheres to a low-
cholesterol diet, and makes sure he always gets a good night’s sleep. 
(Cardiologists love optimistic patients!)
 
 Optimists are more likely to engage in preventive healthcare than pes-
simists are (for example, wearing sunscreen to prevent skin cancer). 
Pessimists are always waiting to see how their health turns out, whereas 
optimists take a more hands-on approach to preventing illness.
 
 Optimists are less likely to become disabled from chronic pain than 
pessimists are. After 40 years of working with patients who have chronic 
back pain, I’ve come to realize that if all a patient can see is disability in 
her future, she behaves as a disabled person in the present. Pain man-
agement begins with the optimistic notion that you can have pain with-
out being all that disabled.
 
 Optimists are more likely to take vitamins than pessimists are. 
Optimists stay ahead of the curve as far as health and well-being go.
 
 Optimists are more likely to follow through with rehab after a heart 
attack than pessimists are. If you don’t believe rehab is going to do you 
any good, what’s the point? With some patients, you have to first reha-
bilitate the mind (change to a more optimistic outlook) before you can 
rehab the body.

 Optimists are less likely to suffer from depression or commit suicide 
than pessimists are. Optimists — even depressed optimists — can 
always see the light at the end of the tunnel. Not so for depressed pes-
simists. As far as they can see, it’s all an unending darkness, which is 
where despair and hopelessness comes from. (A big part of treating 
depressed people is doing everything you can to help them remain opti-
mistic until you can resolve their mood disorder.)
 
 Optimists have more robust immune systems than pessimists do. The 
essence of health psychology and behavioral medicine is the belief that 
mind and body are inextricably connected as a result of the way we live 
our lives. If you live a robust, healthy, and happy life — which is easier 
to do if you’re optimistic — you will have a robust immune system, that 
invisible shield that keeps you well and/or helps you regain your health 
when you’re get sick. Improved immune function is, without question, 
one of the consequences of taking vitamins, practicing safer sex, staying 
socially active, and engaging in health-promotion activities — at least, 
that’s the way optimists see it!
Optimism rocks when it comes to . . . well, when it comes to everything in life, 
from your health to your social relationships. Its benefits truly can’t be exag-
gerated or overestimated!
Keep on keepin’ on
My Aunt Lillian was the poster child for opti-
mism! She had a hard life, but she just kept on 
keepin’ on, always moving forward to the very 
end. Her parents died when she was a small 
child and she and her siblings ended up being 
raised in an orphanage. Lillian was involved in 
a traumatic car accident when she was in her 
early 20s, which left her with a crushed knee 
and a stiff leg. In part because of that, Lillian 
ended up marrying a man much older than her-
self and wasn’t able to have children.
She had to work her whole life as a secre-
tary — long before women actually wanted to 
work outside the home — never making much 
money. Her husband dropped dead one day, 
from a ruptured aneurysm, so Lillian spent the 
last 20 years of her life alone. She had a stroke 
in her mid-70s and ended up living the last ten 
years of her life in a nursing home, paralyzed on 
her right side.
Yet, through all that, Lillian never complained 
about life, always had a captivating smile, 
never had a negative word for anyone, laughed 
all the time, and made everyone around 
her — including me — feel good. I remember 
the night I had to tell my family that I had failed 
my PhD exams and might not have been able to 
continue with my doctoral training. The others 
looked shocked and depressed, but not Aunt 
Lillian — she just gave me a big hug and said, 
“Don’t worry, honey. It’ll be fine. It’ll work out. 
You’ll see.” Lillian was right.

How Optimistic Are You?
Not sure how optimistic you really are? I’ve devised a little assessment 
to help you see just how positive you are (or aren’t) about your future. 
Remember: Be absolutely honest with yourself to get the most out of this 
exercise.
Circle one answer under each of the following questions:
 
1. When you’re not certain how things will turn out in the future, you 
remain hopeful.
 
• Definitely false: 0
 
• False: 1
 
• True: 2
 
• Definitely true: 3
 
2. You believe that there are lots of situations in life that do not have a 
“silver lining.”
 
• Definitely true: 0
 
• True: 1
 
• False: 2
 
• Definitely false: 3
 
3. You believe that if you have failed in the past, you’re likely to fail in 
the future.
 
• Definitely true: 0
 
• True: 1
 
• False: 2
 
• Definitely false: 3
 
4. When you’re faced with a challenge in life, your first thought is 
always a positive one.
 
• Definitely false: 0
 
• False: 1
 
• True: 2
 
• Definitely true: 3

66

5. Just because people say something is impossible, that doesn’t mean 
that it is.
 
• Definitely false: 0
 
• False: 1
 
• True: 2
 
• Definitely true: 3
 
6. You see every day as a welcomed, new opportunity at life.
 
• Definitely false: 0
 
• False: 1
 
• True: 2
 
• Definitely true: 3
Now, add up your scores. If your score is 9 or higher, you definitely have an 
optimistic outlook. If you scored below 9, you have some work to do on the 
optimism front. Although these scores tend to be fairly stable throughout life, 
the good news is you can change them with some work.
 
Believe it or not, it is possible to be too optimistic. If you scored between 15 
and 18, you may be suffering from exuberant optimism — you not only believe 
that good things can happen in your future; you insist they will. I hope you’re 
right — but not all problems have a solution and you may not know when to 
give up and move on. (Don’t believe me? Check out the “Sixteen years and 
counting” sidebar in this chapter.)
Sixteen years and counting
A former client of mine came in for her first 
appointment, well dressed and with a smile on 
her face. We sat down and when I asked her 
how she was, she instantly broke down in tears 
and sobbed uncontrollably for the next 20 min-
utes. I could see that she was in a lot of emo-
tional pain, so I sat quietly and let her cry. When 
she stopped — with mascara running down her 
face, her silk blouse wet from all the tears — 
I asked a second question, “My gosh, how long 
have you felt like this?”
“Sixteen years,” she said, and then she cried 
for another 20 minutes.
The next question I asked her was, “Why didn’t 
you get some help before now — ten years 
ago, five years ago — why did you wait until 
today?”
I never will forget her answer: “I just thought 
things would get better.” This is optimism gone 
awry. You really can have too much of a good 
thing, and there’s no shame in admitting that 
things are bad and you need help.

Happiness: A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Life is not nearly the happenstance we sometimes like to think it is — and, 
that goes for happiness as well. You’d be better off forgetting about luck, fate, 
and destiny and instead thinking of your future as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
Put simply: The attitudes you have today largely determine how things turn 
out tomorrow.
Can’t never could
Here’s a conversation that Andrew had with his uncle many times while 
growing up:
Uncle: How are you? How was your day?
Andrew: Rough. I’m not sure I’m cut out for this type of work.
Uncle: Why not? You’re young and healthy. What’s the problem?
Andrew: It’s just hard work — more than I expected, I guess.
Uncle: Of course, most things in life are more difficult that we first imag-
ine. But we adapt, get used to it, and then it’s not so bad.
Andrew: I don’t know. I’m thinking about quitting. I just don’t think I can 
do it anymore.
Uncle: Son, listen to me carefully. Can’t never could!
If Andrew had a penny for every time his uncle said that phrase — Can’t never 
could! — he reckons he’d be a wealthy man today. The message was simple, 
but profound: If you convince yourself that you can’t do something, you’ll 
find a way to make sure you can’t. The more you think failure, the more you 
fail — in school, at jobs, in relationships. And the more you actually fail, the 
more you expect to fail. This is the vicious cycle of pessimism. You become 
your own prophet of doom!
 
Every morning before you begin your day, stand in front of your bathroom 
mirror and recite out loud ten times: “I am ready to take on life. Good things 
will come my way today — I know it. I will overcome any obstacles that I 
encounter.” Then go about your day as usual and see how things go.

I think I can, I think I can . . .
I believe that some very meaningful psychological lessons are contained in 
children’s books. I use them as therapeutic aides in working with troubled 
kids and even, in some cases, with my adult clients. One of my all-time favor-
ites is the story of The Little Engine That Could. I loved this story as a child 
and I still find it useful all these years later.
The Little Engine That Could is a story of optimism. It’s about how telling your-
self “I think I can, I think I can . . .” can lead to success. It also suggests that:
 
 Optimism is how you overcome unforeseen obstacles.
 
 Optimism is an essential part of helping others in need.
 
 Optimism isn’t necessary when life is easy — only when it’s hard.
 
 Optimism comes in handy when no one around you will help you out.
 
 Optimism is a great antidote to sadness.
 
 Optimism is available even to those who consider themselves 
unimportant.
 
 There are plenty of pessimistic people out there.
 
 Optimism is empowering — it provides the energy needed to move 
mountains.
 
 Everyone loves optimists!
 
Go to your local bookstore and pick up a copy of The Little Engine That Could. 
Put it in some conspicuous place in your home, where you can easily see it, 
and be sure to read it every day — maybe before you begin your day or the 
last thing at night. It’s a nice positive message to start your day with or 
sleep on.
Heart happy
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public 
Health, in a study of over 1,300 healthy men, 
found that pessimists had twice the risk of 
developing heart disease over a ten-year period 
compared to optimists. And this was true even 
after controlling for traditional risk factors such 
as smoking. You can bet this made the optimis-
tic men — and their families — happy.

 Chapter 5: Optimism
Winning the Battle of 
Negative Expectations
Joe, a middle-aged mental-health professional, is what I like to call a closet 
pessimist. On the outside, Joe looks and sounds like an optimist. He’s quick to 
offer advice to his clients, as well as friends and family, like: “Hey, it’ll work 
out — you’ll see” or, “Better times are right around the corner.” But when it 
comes to his own future, Joe is much more pessimistic. He says, “Every time 
the phone rings, my first thought is ‘Oh Lord, what’s wrong now?’ I hate that, 
but I can’t help it — it’s just automatic.”
Joe thinks like a pessimist. Like millions of others, he was raised in an alco-
holic, abusive home. Joe likes to put it this way, “In our family, we were 
always just one beer away from chaos. The future was very tentative.” As a 
kid, Joe learned to hope for the best but expect the worst — it’s how chil-
dren of alcoholics survive. The problem is, the pessimism of Joe’s past has 
persisted, and now it just complicates his present mental and emotional life. 
What was adaptive for the child is now a problem for the adult!
 
If you see yourself in Joe’s story, the good news is that you can win the battle 
of negative expectations. Remember: Anything that is learned can ultimately 
be unlearned. You learned to expect the worst, and you can unlearn it, too. 
Here are five simple rules to help you do just that:
 
 Accept the fact that you’re a pessimist at heart. You don’t have to go 
around sharing that information with just anyone, but you should be 
honest with yourself about the challenge you face in becoming a more 
positive-thinking person.
 
 Accept the fact that your first thought is always a negative one — 
that’s just a given. But don’t go with this thought, don’t dwell on it, and 
certainly don’t let it guide your behavior at that moment.
 
 Remember that it’s the second thought that counts. Learn to counter-
act your initial pessimism by substituting an optimistic thought. So, 
for example, “I’m not sure I can do this” becomes “Wow, what a great 
opportunity!”
 
 Separate the past from the present (and the future). Start saying, 
“That was then; this is now.” No longer link the chaos of your early years 
(or whatever negative experiences you had in the past) with the expec-
tations you have for things that come up in today’s world.
 
 Reward yourself for this self-initiated change in thinking. Give yourself 
a pat on the back, or head to your local coffee shop for your favorite 
drink.

Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
Moving Beyond Pessimism
 
If you’ve figured out that you’re a pessimist, what can you do to change that? 
Lots! Here are my recommendations:
 
 Don’t fight it — change it. You have to begin by accepting, not resist-
ing, the reality that you always start out with negative thoughts. 
Resistance is a waste of energy. The more you resist something, the 
more it persists — try not thinking about the word elephant and see 
what happens. All you can think about now are elephants! The key here 
is to change the way you think.
 
 Turn your thoughts around so that you never end with a negative. For 
example, instead of thinking, “I can do this, but it’s going to be difficult,” 
say to yourself, “It’s going to be difficult, but I can do this.” You want the 
last thing your brain hears to be positive.
 
 Put yourself in the company of optimistic people. Attitudes are con-
tagious. Who do you know who sees the glass as half-full? That’s the 
person you want to hang with!
 
 Develop a personal action plan for reconstructing your attitude. 
You’re stuck in your negative thinking and you need to get unstuck. 
Here’s a method for doing just that:
 
1. Identify some important or valued goal — something you want to 
achieve but have put on hold or been afraid to tackle.
 
 I recommend starting with something small — something that 
will take a minimum of effort, but have a big payoff. It’s important 
to think in terms of evolution — slow, progressive change — not 
revolution.
 
 For example, you might say, “I want to take a trip to Wisconsin to 
see my sister.”
 
2. Identify the incentives of reaching that goal.
 
 This is the reason behind the goal. For example, why do you want 
to go to Wisconsin to see your sister? You might say, “I want to 
feel the joy of reconnecting with family. I want a change of scenery. 
I want to escape the day-to-day routine back home.”
 
3. Ask yourself, on a scale of 0 to 10, how committed you are to 
achieving this goal.
 
4. List three things that you would need to do to accomplish this 
goal.
 
 For example, if your goal is to visit your sister in Wisconsin, maybe 
you need to map out the route you’ll take, call your sister and set a 
definite date to arrive, and rent a reliable, comfortable vehicle.

71
 Chapter 5: Optimism
 
5. Ask yourself whether you see any obstacles to accomplishing 
your goal.
 
6. Ask yourself how confident you are you that you can achieve 
this goal.
 
 You can be committed to something but not necessarily confident 
that you’ll win out. Commitment has more to do with making the 
effort, confidence more with your belief in yourself.
 
7. Start the ball rolling by doing the first thing you listed in Step 4 
that you need to do to achieve your goal.
 
 After you’ve completed the first step, reward yourself with a literal 
or figurative pat on the back or say out loud, “Good for me!”
 
8. Do the second thing you listed in Step 4. And then move on to 
the third thing you listed in Step 4.
 
 Don’t forget to reward yourself after each step — that keeps you 
moving forward.
What you’re trying to do here is change your pessimistic attitude by chang-
ing your behavior first. Normally, people think of attitudes as something 
that leads behavior — like a horse pulling a wagon. But I want you to turn 
that around and think of a change in attitude as something that follows 
behavior — in effect, putting the cart in front of the horse!
 
This “cart-before-the-horse” approach I’m talking about is the essence of what 
has come to be called behavioral medicine, a new approach to health and well-
being that I was privileged to help pioneer, where you literally behave your 
way into, in this case, happiness.
Exercise and optimism
Some years ago, my colleagues and I con-
ducted a small study of cardiac patients at a 
local hospital, administering a test of optimism 
and also seeing how compliant they were with 
the exercise rehab program to which they had 
been referred by their cardiologists. Not sur-
prisingly, there was a significant link between 
the two. Those patients who were the most 
optimistic exercised the most, and conversely 
those who exercised the most were the most 
optimistic. This suggests that, even if you don’t 
start out all that optimistic, you will be if you 
stick to the exercise program.

udy was a fascinating man. Born in the early 1930s in Germany, he 
became one of millions of Jews caught up in the Nazi Holocaust — a 
time of unspeakable horror. Rudy was a survivor of Auschwitz-Birkenau, the 
most notorious of the death camps. What I found most compelling, however, 
was the fact that he could talk endlessly about his experiences during the 
war without any trace of bitterness or distress. In one very real sense, he was 
a victim — but in another sense, he was not. Forty years after the fact, Rudy 
was a happy man, a successful architect, a loving husband and grandfather, 
and a good neighbor.
What was his secret? What enabled him to survive the nightmare of Auschwitz 
and go on with his life? What did he have that others less fortunate did not? 
The answer can be found in the pioneering work of psychologist Salvatore 
Maddi who first introduced the idea of the hardy personality. According to 
Dr. Maddi, hardy people are like hardy animals and plants — they are resilient. 
They survive adversity, weather the storms of everyday life — and in doing 
so, they grow stronger, more competent, and happier over the course of their 
lives.
In this chapter, I show you how to tell if you’re a hardy personality and, if 
you aren’t yet, how you can become one. Unlike Maddi and his colleagues at 
the University of Chicago, who were primarily interested in the link between 
hardiness and physical health, I want you to appreciate how hardiness also 
impacts on your psychological health.

74
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
The Recipe for Hardiness
Hardiness is a complex personality trait that is comprised of three essential 
elements. I call them the three Cs: control, commitment, and challenge. No 
one element is more important than the other — it’s the combination that 
counts.
So what’s the difference between hardy people and non-hardy people and 
how do the three Cs come into play? Hardy people:
 
 Want control over their own lives: Non-hardy people, on the other 
hand, depend more on luck, fate, chance, and the actions of other 
people — all things beyond their own control — to make the difference 
in how their lives go.
 
 Are committed to the things and people that matter most to them: Non-
hardy people feel alienated and detached from the world around them. 
Hardy employees, for example, love their careers, while those lacking in 
hardiness see work as just a job.
 
 Hardy people view life as a series of challenges: Non-hardy people see 
life as “one damned thing after another.”
In the following sections, I go into more detail on each of these three Cs.
Control
Do you want to be master of your own destiny? Do you feel confident about 
your ability to deal effectively with whatever life throws at you? Do you believe 
in that saying, “Success is 10 percent inspiration and 90 percent perspiration”? 
If people take advantage of you, do you say to yourself, “That’s just because I 
The Holocaust: Past versus present
A study of 38 Holocaust survivors showed that 
those who continued to relive the trauma of 
the past experienced far more mental-health 
problems — for example, anxiety, phobias, 
insomnia, depression, crying fits, suicidal 
thinking, hostility, and feelings of self-hate — 
in the years since the war than did those who 
had found a way to become less preoccupied 
with that dreadful time in their lives. Those non-
hardy souls who could not disconnect from the 
past became perpetual victims of this horrific 
experience.

let them”? Do you vote regularly because you believe your vote counts? If you 
answered yes to these questions, then you’re high on what psychologists call 
internal control: You believe that it’s what’s inside of you — intelligence, cour-
age, creativity — that ultimately determines how happy you are in life.
Bill is high on that internal control scale. When his left lung hemorrhaged at 
the age of 17, he suddenly found his whole world turned upside-down — he 
had a major part of his lung removed, had to drop out of school, and spent 
the next year trying to regain his health. Not one to be a victim, Bill thought 
to himself, “What can I do to get my life and health back?” The answer was 
simple: rehabilitation. And not just physical rehabilitation (although that was 
the place to start), but spiritual, social, and emotional rehabilitation as well. 
Bill worked out with weights and did strengthening exercises daily; he recon-
nected with his friends; and he began to spend a lot of his time appreciating 
life — thinking about how lucky he was to have a second chance. Bill was 
busy! And it worked. He went on to have a healthy and productive adult life. 
He’s currently alive and kicking at 61.
Believe it or not, Bill’s sister, Eugenia, suffered the same fate when she was 
about the same age. Unfortunately, Eugenia wasn’t high on that internal con-
trol scale. After having her lung removed, she refused to do anything on her 
own behalf to get well. Eugenia thought of herself as a fragile person. She felt 
sorry for herself, and she spent the rest of her life trying to get other people 
to take care of her in one way or another. Her destiny was literally in the 
hands of others. Tragically, she died at age 42.
The difference between Bill and Eugenia is a personality difference, not a 
difference in disease. Both suffered from a severe, chronic lung disorder 
that manifested itself early in life. The fact that Bill has outlived his sister by 
20 years (and counting) is no accident — Bill wanted to be in control of his 
future and Eugenia did not. It’s just that simple!
Take a few minutes, close your eyes, and try to imagine that you’re faced 
with the same health problem as Bill and his sister. Then ask yourself, “How 
would I respond to that type of adversity? Would I be more like Bill or more 
like Eugenia?” Finally, think about the long-term consequences of that last 
answer.
 
The key to the control aspect of hardiness is the word I — Bill asked “What 
can I do to help myself?” He told himself “I have to lift weights, I have to do 
the strengthening exercises, and I have to reconnect with my friends, if I want 
to regain my health and keep on living.” His sister only thought about you and 
me — “What are you going to do to make me well?”
 
Take ownership of your illness — or any other major problem you encounter — 
and you take ownership of your recovery.

76
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
Commitment
Hardy personalities have a deep sense of emotional commitment. They’re 
players, not spectators. Hardy people are passionate — they get involved in 
what’s going on around them and they begin and end each day with a sense 
of purpose.
What’s your purpose in life? What types of activities give meaning to your 
life? What are you enthusiastic about?  If one type of passion ends, do you 
find an alternative activity to commit yourself to?
Eleanor was a devoted mother to her two kids. She interrupted her career as 
a counselor so she could be home for them during their formative years. She 
cooked, sewed, went to school conferences, chaperoned band trips, cared 
for her children when they were sick, and made sure she instilled in each of 
them a set of values that would see them successfully through their adult 
lives. Eleanor had a passion for motherhood and she was a happy mom!
But eventually Eleanor’s kids grew up, left home, moved out of state, and 
quickly became busily engaged in their own meaningful lives. Eleanor’s job 
as a full-time parent was finished, but she wasn’t about to let go of the joys of 
interacting with and nurturing young people. So, she became involved in an 
all-volunteer community group that raised scholarship money for outstand-
ing high school girls. Eleanor couldn’t possibly imagine that what had started 
out as a few hours here and there would evolve into a year-round commit-
ment of her energies to this worthy cause. (Chapter 14 discusses the empty 
nest, which is what Eleanor might have experienced had she not restructured 
her life with a new set of meaningful activities.)
Hardiness and coping
Hardy personalities cope with stress differently 
than non-hardy people do. The hardier you are:
  The more likely you are to take a problem-
focused approach to things that go wrong 
in your life instead of just reacting to the 
emotions of the moment. Better to fix the 
flat tire than to stand there cussing and 
kicking the tire.
  The more likely you are to solicit support 
from others during stressful times.
  The less likely you are to waste your time 
wishing that things would get better (as 
opposed to making them better).
  The less likely you are to go out of your way 
to avoid thinking about or actually dealing 
with the problem at hand.

77
 Chapter 6: Hardiness
Which of the following areas of your life are you currently committed to?
 
 Intimate relationship
 
 Family
 
 Career
 
 Friends
 
 Hobbies or recreation
 
 Community
 
 Religion
 
 Politics
If the answer is “none,” you may feel alienated from the world around you. 
Well, you’re not alone, as Robert Putnam, professor of public policy at 
Harvard, suggests in his national bestseller Bowling Alone (Touchstone).  
Cultural changes in the American culture, he contends, have contributed to a 
sense of disenfranchisement among the general public. Putnam recommends 
a revival of communal activism, where ordinary people can regain a feeling 
of connection — belonging — more akin to that experienced by past genera-
tions. Specific examples include bringing back the arts into school (for exam-
ple, choir) and re-engineering the workplace so that it’s more “family-friendly 
and community-congenial.” Other ways that alienated people can find a sense 
of purpose and commitment include radio call-in talk shows (where you can 
regularly and safely become part of a meaningful dialogue) and Internet 
chatrooms.
 
In some instances, alienation has more to do with personality (for example, 
shyness) and emotional issues (social anxiety), in which case you’re better off 
seeking out the services of a mental-health professional to help you overcome 
your shyness and social anxiety. If you dive in to activities without strategies 
in place, you may just face the same anxiety all over again and retreat.
Challenge
Challenge has to do with how you look at stress. Are you one of those 
people who reacts to all problems and conflicts throughout life as if they’re 
catastrophes, calamities, or crises? That’s not the hardy perspective. What 
you want to do is view these same problems as challenges — in other 
words, events and circumstances that will test your courage, fortitude, 
and resourcefulness.

Consider the following exchange I had with a young man, Jerry, who had just 
been blindsided with the news that his work schedule was being drastically 
changed so that he no longer had any weekends free. When Jerry came in to 
see me, he was very agitated.
Jerry: This is ridiculous. They can’t do this to me. I don’t deserve this 
after all the years I’ve worked here. I’ve been a good employee, bending 
over backwards to help this company, and they stab me in the back. I’m 
going to quit this damned job.
Me: Quitting is always an option, but first help me understand what you 
see as the problem with this change in schedule. Exactly how do you feel 
it’s going to change your life?
Jerry: It’s going to change everything. I won’t be able to play golf with my 
buddies on the weekend. I’ll have to get used to working 12-hour days. 
Just everything!
Me: Do you see any positives here — any opportunity — or does it just 
seem like a catastrophe?
Jerry: Opportunity? Like what?
Cubs versus the club
For three years, my friend Rob and I were “den 
mothers” for eight young Cub Scouts. During 
that time, we planned a number of father-son 
excursions, providing an opportunity for dads 
to spend some quality outdoor time with their 
sons. To my amazement, not one father ever 
came along. I remember one occasion when we 
were going to spend the entire fall day walking 
through the deep woods surrounding the little 
village of Appomattox, Virginia, where Robert 
E. Lee had surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, 
effectively ending the Civil War. Father after 
father dropped their sons off with one excuse or 
another as to why they wouldn’t be joining us.
The last father to arrive walked his son up to 
me and said, “I appreciate your doing this for 
my son. I know you’ll have a great time. I wish 
I could come along, but I’ve got a tennis match 
at the club.” The expression of sadness and 
disappointment on his son’s face sticks in my 
mind to this day.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well, and 
that includes being a parent. Being a commit-
ted parent isn’t just about giving your kids food, 
shelter, and clothing, and it’s not just about 
buying them the latest video games or toys. 
It’s about being there with them, doing things 
together, and sometimes giving up the things 
you want to do in order to do the things your 
kids want. Think about how committed you are 
as a parent. If you’re committed to nothing else 
in life, at least be committed to your kids.

Me: Well, you’ve talked, for example, about how you wish you could find 
another job, but you didn’t have time during the week to look around. 
Now you will. We’ve also talked before about how you might like to take 
a course or two at the community college, but again most of the classes 
are during the week. Now you could pursue that possibility. That’s what 
I had in mind.
Jerry: I guess I wasn’t looking at it that way. What you say makes sense. I 
really would like to find another job, one with more of a future in terms of 
pay and advancement. I’m at a dead end where I am.
Me: Right. So even though this came at you out of the blue and isn’t some-
thing you wanted to happen, maybe you can make this work for you?
Jerry: I guess so — it’s worth a try.
Me: Absolutely, what have you got to lose?
Can you relate to Jerry and how he initially saw his predicament? Most 
people start out thinking of stress in all negative terms. All they hear is that 
little voice in their heads that says, “Oh, my God! This is awful.” But, even-
tually, either with some help or on your own, you can start to see that this 
really isn’t the end of the world — it’s a challenge, and you’ll see what you’re 
made of by how you deal with it.

Think Chinese
In Chinese, the word for conflict has a dual 
meaning: danger and opportunity. I like that 
because it gives you a choice both about how 
you view conflict and how you deal with it. 
Cultures that think of conflict as a bad thing 
tend to encourage their members to either avoid 
conflict or find ways to manage — minimize — 
it. In other words, they miss the opportunity!

Add up the number of times you answered True. If your score is between 0 
and 5, you’re low on hardiness. If your score is between 6 and 10, you have a 
moderate degree of hardiness. And if your score is 11 or above, you’re high 
on the hardiness scale. In the following sections, I fill you in on how you can 
increase your hardiness.
Non-hardy, Type-A personalities: 
The worst of the worst
You’re likely familiar with someone who exhib-
its all the characteristics of the Type-A person-
ality — the friend who never lets you finish a 
sentence without saying “Yeah, right” a dozen 
times, the person who finishes eating long 
before everyone else, the colleague whose eyes 
are constantly scanning the room while you’re 
talking to her, the client who’s a little bit too seri-
ous about life and who has an edge about him 
all the time. Type-A’s are the folks who, medi-
cal research has shown, are more likely to have 
heart attacks and strokes, as well as suffer from 
an assortment of other illnesses — and they’re 
the same folks who never seem to be happy.
Well, it turns out that if you lack hardiness and 
you’re also a Type A, as far as your health is 
concerned, you’re up the proverbial creek with-
out a paddle. To be specific: People who are low 
on hardiness and high on Type A are three times 
more likely to become ill (with everything from 
minor ailments to major diseases) than those 
who are high on hardiness and low on Type A.
If you think you may be a Type A personality, 
check out Chapter 15, where I tell you how to set 
yourself up to be a Type B — the type of person 
who is easy-going, laid back, patient, nonjudg-
mental, and would rather walk than drive.

82
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
 
If you scored 11 or above, you may have what I call exuberant hardiness — feel-
ing you can (or should) control everything, being overcommitted, and being 
too eager to take on challenges. Exuberant hardiness is a good way to end up 
burned out. Remember: As with most things in life, balance is key.
Transformational Coping
Hardy people cope differently with stress than non-hardy people do. Hardy 
people are less apt to take a step backward when confronted with one of 
life’s many curveballs. Instead, they behave in a way that transforms a bad 
situation into something better — this is known as transformational coping. 
Hardy people are optimistic (more about this in Chapter 5) — they believe 
that all situations, no matter how difficult, have a potential for a happy 
ending. And they tackle stress head-on rather than avoiding it.
Hardy is as hardy does
Hardiness is more about actions (doing) than it is about attitude (thinking, 
feeling). Hardy people do the following types of things:
 
 Volunteer in the community
 
 Vote
 
 Show up at municipal government meetings
 
 Write letters to the editor of the local newspaper
 
 Get involved in their kids’ activities
 
 Collect things — everything from bottle caps to teddy bears
 
 Go white-water rafting
 
 Take classes at the community college, regardless of their age
 
 Devote themselves to their pets
 
 Share their opinions about important matters with others
 
 Look for jobs with new challenges and opportunities
 
 Become advocates for abused and neglected children
 
 Help get out the vote for their favorite political candidates
 
 Run marathons

83
 Chapter 6: Hardiness
 
 Accept leadership positions
 
 Get regular health checkups
 
 Spend time with people they love
 
 Give to worthy charities
 
 Attend religious services regularly
 
 Take on the tough challenges in life
 
This is just a list meant to illustrate the types of things hardy people do. You 
can be a hardy person and not go white-water rafting, or you can be a hardy 
person and not attend church. The common thread connecting all these types 
of activities is that you’re actively doing them on a regular basis — and not 
just thinking about doing them.
The best and worst of times
Life is full of paradoxes. What often appears to be the worst of times ends up 
leading to the best of times. Take Roger, for example. Roger’s a man in his 
late 50s, who just found out his job as a midlevel executive had been termi-
nated. “I came in at 8 o’clock and there was a letter in my mailbox telling me I 
had been let go — and, I needed to be off the premises by 5 o’clock that day,” 
he said. “I couldn’t even get angry — I was in such a state of shock.”
Hardiness and exercise: The best of both worlds
In 1982, psychologists Suzanne Kobasa, 
Salvadore Maddi, and Mark Puccetti examined 
the effects of combined hardiness and exer-
cise in 137 middle- and upper-management 
employees at a large utility company. Exercise 
was defined in terms of how many actual hours 
each employee spent regularly engaged in 
both strenuous sports and non-sports activi-
ties (for example, gardening or home repairs). 
Employees were also asked to identify any 
common physical and mental symptoms and/
or diseases they had experienced; these 
included such things as bursitis, hay fever, 
psoriasis, depression, hyperventilation, nose-
bleed, migraine headaches, and gallstones.
What the doctors found was fascinating: Those 
employees who were low on the hardiness 
scale and who failed to exercise regularly had 
nearly seven times more illness than their co-
workers who were hardy exercisers. Those 
who either were hardy or who exercised (but 
who didn’t fall into both categories) were some-
where in the middle. Why not combine the two 
and enjoy the best of both worlds?

84
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
Roger wanted my advice on what he should do next: “How can I tell my wife 
that I no longer have a job, and who’s going to want to hire a guy my age?” He 
was clearly distressed.
I thought a minute and then asked, “Didn’t you tell me once you had a little 
business on the side that you enjoyed — something about jewelry?”
He said that, yes, he did sell jewelry — mostly diamonds — to family and 
friends. “And you find that sort of thing both enjoyable and profitable?” I asked.
“Oh, yes,” he replied. “I like how happy people get when they find out that 
top-quality diamonds can be affordable.”
My last question was “And, why was it that you weren’t in the jewelry busi-
ness full-time?”
Thanks for nothing everything
You may be able to relate to Roger’s story. 
You’ve suffered some misfortune in life, only to 
find out later on that it somehow changed your 
life for the better. Here’s a thought: Why not 
write an overdue thank-you note to the person 
who created that unfortunate circumstance? 
Remember:  Gratitude is one of the key ingre-
dients to achieving happiness (for a list of the 
other key ingredients see Chapter 2).  Here’s an 
example of such a letter.
 
 Dear Mr. Miller,
 
 I know it’s been a while since you fired me, 
but I wanted you to know what has hap-
pened to me since. When it first happened, 
as you can imagine, I was quite upset — 
angry even. I hated you for taking my job 
security and forcing me to look elsewhere 
for employment. But — and this is really the 
reason for my note — as it turned out, you 
did me an enormous favor.
 
 Seriously, I didn’t realize just how stressed 
and unappreciated I was when I worked for 
you until the job ended. It was only then that 
I began to appreciate how unhappy I was 
at work and why. Simply put, I was doing 
a good job (even though you didn’t see it 
that way!) at the wrong thing. It turns out 
that I’m a people person and spending all 
my working days in front of a computer was 
just not my cup of tea. I’m now doing what I 
was put on Earth to do: I’m working in retail 
clothing, where I meet scores of interest-
ing people every day. I literally can’t wait to 
get to work every morning, a feeling that I 
honestly never had when I worked for you. I 
know you didn’t intend for my life to turn out 
better when you fired me, but it has — and, 
I wanted you to know that and to say thank-
you for forcing me into a better career fit.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jane Doe
Remember: You don’t even have to actually mail 
the letter in order to get the benefit from the 
exercise — it’s the thought that counts!

85
 Chapter 6: Hardiness
Roger said, “Because I had a job and could only devote my spare time to it.”
I told him, “Well, now you don’t have a job, do you? So maybe you should 
think about starting a new career.”
Fast-forward five years, and Roger is the proud owner of a local jewelry store. 
Today he’s making more money than he ever did at his old job — the one 
that he’d still have if they hadn’t let him go — and he’s a much happier man. 
Getting fired is not always a bad thing, but that depends on what you do if 
and when it happens. Hardy people, more often than not, do the thing that’ll 
turn the worst of times into the best of times.
Using Roger’s situation as an example, I want to map out the process by 
which you can transform a potential disaster into an opportunity:
 
1. Clearly define the stressful situation facing you.
 
 In Roger’s case, he was fired without warning and suddenly unemployed.  
Even more important was his concern about finding a new job at his age.
 
2. Reframe the problem as an opportunity.
 
 Roger was understandably focused on what he had lost — his job — 
rather than on what he might conceivably gain from this unexpected 
change in circumstance. When faced with a problem that seems over-
whelming, ask yourself, “What does this change in circumstance free 
me up to do that I’ve been wanting to do, but couldn’t?” In other words, 
did closing one door open another? Most people have unrealized ambi-
tions that only come to light when allowed to by some alteration in their 
circumstances.
 
3. Identify existing resources that can be used in transforming the 
situation.
 
 Roger had strong family support, substantial savings to tide himself over 
until he could get his new career up and running, and a history of over-
coming other difficult situations in his past.
 
4. Develop an action plan.
 
 After I suggested that Roger use this opportunity to think about chang-
ing careers, the rest was up to him. He was the one who put all the 
pieces of a business plan together — product, financing, mission state-
ment, competition, overhead expenses. Getting from the worst of times 
to the best of times requires a plan!
 
5. Implement the plan.
 
 Roger was the one who ended up going to his local banker for a business 
loan. Roger was the one who met with real-estate agents to find suitable 
space for his jewelry store. Roger was the one who flew to New York to 
meet with jewelry suppliers.

86
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
 
6. Revise the plan as needed.
 
 When you’re implementing your transition plan, if you find that you 
need to revise some aspect of it, do it. For example, Roger’s new busi-
ness grew so quickly that he had to hire more associates than he had 
initially anticipated — definitely a nice problem to have, but one he still 
needed to solve for.
 
7. Celebrate the fact that you turned what looked to be a crisis into a 
success.
 
 It’s time to pat yourself on the back!

Chapter 7
Conscientiousness
In This Chapter
 Being honest and trustworthy
 Being appropriately engaged with life
 Understanding what ethics is about
 Going along to get along
I
n their wonderful little book The Roseto Story: An Anatomy of Health 
(University of Oklahoma Press), Drs. John Bruhn and Stewart Wolf 
described a small Italian-American community in eastern Pennsylvania 
called Roseto. The inhabitants of Roseto appeared to be immune from heart 
attacks despite rampant obesity, a high level of dietary-fat consumption, 
heavy cigarette smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Roseto was founded in 
1887 and didn’t have its first recorded heart attack until 1971.
So what was the Rosetans secret to health? According to Bruhn and Wolf, it 
was a set of protective social forces that included:
 
 Unusually close family ties
 
 Strong religious beliefs
 
 The fact that Rosetans revered the elderly
 
 An extreme sense of group identity
 
 A reliance on each other atypical of surrounding communities
To illustrate the role that social forces play in protecting Rosetans’ health, 
Bruhn and Wolf offer a case history of a man who died from a heart attack at 
age 41. The man had spent his whole adult life experiencing chronic unhappi-
ness. He wanted to go to college but didn’t because his wife discouraged him 
and he claimed he didn’t have the money for it — so he spent 22 years in a 
job that he hated. He admittedly disliked living in Roseto — saying, “I don’t fit 
in the town — I’m not like the Rosetans” — but remained there nevertheless. 
He had few friends and had little to do with family who lived nearby. And he 

88
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
didn’t belong to any of the many social and civic organizations that were the 
cornerstone of Rosetan life. According to Bruhn and Wolf, the man simply 
“found himself out of the mainstream of Rosetan culture,” a situation that 
they believed ultimately caused his untimely death.
What I believe killed this man was that he was living a lie his entire life. He 
claimed to be a devoted family man, yet in truth he had a strained relation-
ship with his wife and he had several extramarital affairs. He could afford to 
send his son to college and his two brothers paid their own way to college, 
so why couldn’t he afford to go himself? Another lie. He claimed to be “stuck” 
in his job but appeared to make no effort to find alternative employment. 
Another lie. All these lies, and the physical and emotional discomfort that 
accompanied them, he kept to himself. In the end, this was his undoing. 
In this chapter, I show you how the truth — not just telling the truth, but 
living the truth — leads to happiness. Conscientiousness is about truth, 
about ethics, morality, being forthright and trustworthy, having integrity. It’s 
also about self-discipline. When you meet a conscientious person, what you 
see is what you get — there are no hidden agendas and, thus, no burdensome 
stress. In Chapter 2, I talk about how safety is a prerequisite to happiness. 
Well, you can never feel totally safe if you’re living a lie — you’re always on 
guard that someone will find out the truth.
Are You Living an Honest Life?
 
It’s not always easy to know if you’re living an honest, conscientious life. 
Sometimes you have to ask yourself some tough questions and hope you like 
the answers. For example:
 
 Do you find yourself angry too much of the time? Anger is often the 
result of conflict and frustration. If you’re experiencing some type of inner 
conflict — for example, between how you feel and how you act — that can 
express itself in hostility to others, rudeness, or irritability. Other people 
keep trying to figure out what they’ve done wrong and the answer is 
“nothing” — the source of your anger is you!
 
 Do you find yourself feeling tense too much of the time? The human 
body is wired to be tense (heart pounding, blood pressure skyrocketing, 
muscles tightening, stomach knotting) for brief intervals whenever your 
brain senses some type of threat or danger. But the body is not designed 
to experience ongoing, chronic tension. That’s what causes stress-related 
illnesses like tension and migraine headaches, high blood pressure, ulcers, 
and coronary heart disease. Tension is not only a defense against outside 
threat; it’s also a defense against letting others know your true self.

89
 Chapter 7: Conscientiousness
 
 Do you find yourself apologizing too much of the time? You may spend 
a large part of your everyday life apologizing for one thing or another — 
“I’m sorry I was late,” “I’m sorry you don’t like what I fixed for dinner,” 
or “I’m sorry I’m not the perfect daughter.” I’ve found that most apolo-
gies are made not because the apologetic person has done something 
wrong — they’re simply apologizing for not being what other people 
want them to be.
 
 Do you find yourself feeling discouraged, disheartened, and dissatis-
fied most of the time? All these dis– feelings reflect a chronic state of 
unhappiness that most likely results from your not being true to yourself 
and living life on your own terms.
 
 Do you find yourself avoiding other people too often? If so, it’s most 
likely because you have some unfinished business with the person 
you’re avoiding.
 
 I loaned some money to a relative once, and he promised to pay me back 
soon. I would’ve gladly given him the money, but he insisted on it being 
a loan — he wasn’t looking for charity, just some help. Months went by, 
and I heard via the family grapevine that he had gotten back on his feet 
financially and was doing quite well, but he made no attempt to repay 
the money. We visited our family several times over the next year or two 
and each time he went to great lengths to avoid seeing us while we were 
in town — he had one excuse after another. I later found out that he had 
no intentions of paying me back because he didn’t believe you should 
have to pay family back for loans like you would a bank. I wish he’d 
just been honest with me and not let a couple of hundred dollars come 
between us.
 
 Do you shy away from the truth when it hurts? A friend of mine told me 
about when his sister died in her mid-40s from a serious illness. She was 
in a hospital, wasting away, and death was imminent. In a quiet moment, 
during what turned out to be their last visit together, she asked him, 
“Am I going to die?” Either the doctors had not been straightforward 
with her, or she wanted to hear it from the person she trusted most in 
this world — her big brother. His heart breaking, he thought a minute 
and said honestly, “Yes.” Then she asked her second question: “Will it 
be soon?” Choking the tears back, he said, “Yes.” A conscientious person 
tells the truth even when it hurts.
 
 Is there a part of you that you’re not proud of and that you don’t want 
other people to see? People who live secret lives are duplicitous — 
they’re deceitful, dishonest, and double-dealing. They appear one way 
to the general public and a very different way in their own private lives. 
Alcoholics and drug addicts are duplicitous. So are far too many politi-
cians. Husbands cheating on their wives are duplicitous, and so are 
wives cheating on their husbands. Duplicitous people are never happy 
because they’re afraid someone will discover the truth about them — 
and, because they make so many other people unhappy.

90
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
If you aren’t living an honest life, you can change. Here are some ways you 
can begin:
 
 Stop apologizing for who and what you are. If you’re a scoundrel, 
admit it. If you’re a decent person who fails to live up to someone else’s 
expectations, let that be their problem — not yours.
 
 Begin living your life as if it were, in fact, your own. Make your own 
decisions and accept the consequences that follow. Always be open to 
advice from others, but don’t take that as a mandate for how to live your 
life. If you do, you’ll always blame them when things don’t turn out in 
your favor.
 
 Make sure your outer self matches up with your inner self. Otherwise, 
you’re, as they say, a house divided against itself. 
 
 Confess to yourself what’s really behind all your anger and dissatis-
faction. In Anger Management For Dummies, I explain how easy this is 
to do.
Making sure you’re trustworthy
Are the people you work with, love, and depend 
on day in and day out trustworthy? Can you rely 
on them — for example, to keep their word and 
follow through with commitments? Can you 
entrust your innermost feelings and thoughts 
to them without worrying that they’ll betray 
you? And, conversely, can those same people 
trust you?
Trust is not only essential to intimate relation-
ships (see Chapter 20); it has a lot to do with 
how long you live. A friend and colleague, Dr. 
Ilene Siegler at Duke University Medical Center, 
and her associates studied the effect of trust 
on longevity in 100 elderly men and women and 
found that trust — the generalized expectancy 
that you could depend on others — was associ-
ated with:
  Better self-rated health
  Less illness-related disability
  Greater life satisfaction
  Fewer negative emotions (such as anger or 
loneliness)
  Longer life span
Study participants who were high on trust had 
half the mortality risk of those who described 
themselves as relatively untrusting.
Remember: You can extend the lives of those 
you love the most by being a more trustworthy 
person. That should make you and them happy!
If you really want to know if other people view 
you as trustworthy, ask five of your closest 
friends and family members to rate you on a 
10-point scale of how much they can count on 
you most days, where 1 is not at all and 10 is 
completely. Take the average of their scores 
and that should tell you whether you need to 
work on this aspect of your personality.

91
 Chapter 7: Conscientiousness
 
 Stop making excuses for not dealing with the part of life that’s difficult 
or painful. If you lack the courage to visit a dying friend in the hospital, 
just be honest and let her know that’s how you feel. Don’t try to tell 
yourself that you don’t have the time or there are more important things 
that you need to do. Otherwise, head to the hospital and realize that it’s 
a lot easier to live with your discomfort than it is to be dying.
How Engaged Are You?
Conscientiousness also means being engaged in activities that are personally 
valued. It’s not enough to consider something important or meaningful — you 
have to do it. If you believe it’s important to be charitable, but you can never 
find the time to spend a few hours in a soup kitchen or working with Habitat 
for Humanity, you aren’t a conscientious person. If you think it’s important to 
be compassionate, but you never put money in the Salvation Army kettle or 
contribute to the American Heart Association, you’re not a conscientious indi-
vidual. Conscientiousness is not about talk — it’s about action!
 
If you want to measure how conscientious you are in terms of engagement, 
answer the following three questions:
 
1. Does most of what you do everyday seem trivial and unimportant 
to you?
 
• Very Much: 0
 
• Somewhat: 1
 
• Not Really: 2
 
2. Do you care a lot about the things you do every day?
 
• Not Really: 0
 
• Somewhat: 1
 
• Very Much: 2
 
3. Do you think about engaging in meaningful activities more than you 
actually do?
 
• Very Much: 0
 
• Somewhat: 1
 
• Not Really: 2
The closer you are to 6, the more conscientious you are about those activi-
ties that give your life meaning. And, how does being engaged benefit you? 
Studies show that it’s linked to higher levels of positive emotion and life sat-
isfaction — two key components to happiness.

92
Part II: Personality Attributes That Lead to Happiness 
If you’re someone who’s not engaged at all, you need to ask yourself:
 
 What do I value in life? What are my goals? What do I want out of 
life — good health, wealth, long-lasting relationships? Be specific. 
There’s no right answer here — each of us values different things. 
Goals give your life a sense of direction, a destination toward which you 
can proceed. Without them, you’re just driving around in circles!
 
 How attainable are those goals? In other words, can you picture your-
self getting what you want most out of life? If not, what are the obstacles 
that keep you from succeeding? For example, if you’re a member of an 
ethnic minority, do you think that this will prevent you from becom-
ing financially independent? If you’re born into a poor family, do you 
believe that you’re destined to be poor your entire life? Are there skills 
you’re lacking that, if you acquired them, would greatly enhance your 
chances of realizing your goals? What could you do to make your goals 
more attainable? Have you thought about getting more education — for 
example, at the local community college? Would you be more likely to 
attain the things you value in life if you asked others for help — or is it 
more important to you to stand alone?
Substance over form
The word substance has many meanings, all 
of which are positive. When applied to human 
beings, it refers to being worthwhile, strong, 
solid, sturdy, impressive, and fundamentally 
sound. If you make a substantial contribution to 
the world, your life is said to have both value 
and impact — and, is looked upon by others 
with respect.
Form, on the other hand, has to do with appear-
ance — what people see when they look at you. 
Form can be deceiving, but substance never is.
A lot of unhappiness comes about from real-
izing that your life may be more form (looks 
good) than substance (very little impact). In 
other words, people may give the impression of 
being happy when, in fact, they’re far from it. 
Happiness comes from within and, if someone 
has made a substantial contribution to life, she 
has the full measure of happiness.
Erik Erikson, one of the great American psy-
chologists, noted that we enter old age with 
either a feeling of integrity, having spent our 
time on Earth being meaningful, or in despair 
over all the things we failed to accomplish and 
the goals we never reached.
No matter what your age, take a minute and 
reflect on how you want to feel when you near 
the end of your life. Better yet, take a minute 
to reflect on how you want to feel next week! 
Would you rather look back with a feeling of 
pride and peace of mind or a feeling of regret? 
You have a choice! You can alter your future at 
any point along life’s highway. Even today, you 
can choose to begin a new journey of great joy 
and fulfillment.

 Chapter 7: Conscientiousness
Examining Ethics
A friend of mine is an ethicist — he makes his living educating people about 
ethics in general and medical ethics in particular. He says that ethics is about 
behavior that has prescriptive value — in other words those things we should 
do if we want to live a happy and successful life. Ethics is not the same as 
morality, which more directly distinguishes between right and wrong. There 
are different forms of ethics. For example, the Puritan work ethic says that 
if people engage in constant labor for the benefit of society, they’ll achieve 
salvation. In modern times, the prescribed benefit is defined in terms of eco-
nomic prosperity and materialism.
According to my friend, it’s not all that difficult to know whether a person is 
ethical. If he’s doing what he ought to do according to society, he’s an ethical 
man; if he isn’t, he’s not. Ethical students refrain from cheating. Ethical thera-
pists avoid having intimate relationships with their clients. Ethical pro ball 
players refuse to cork their bats, use steroids, or put foreign substances on 
the ball to make it do tricks on its way to the plate.
An ethical person lives a coherent lifestyle (see Chapter 10), is more reliable 
in his dealings with others, and, thus, is more likely to achieve happiness — 
which can be viewed as a form of emotional salvation. Another sign that you’re 
dealing with an ethical person is the smile on her face (see Chapter 12). Why 
wouldn’t she smile when she’s doing what she ought to be doing?
 
You can become a more ethical person if you:
 
 Develop a set of principles to live by that conform to society’s expecta-
tions. For example, ascribing to the belief that “two wrongs never make a 
right” keeps you from answering bad behavior with more bad behavior.
 
 Always try to put yourself in the other person’s shoes. If you wouldn’t 
like someone to take advantage of you, then don’t take advantage of 
him. If it upsets you when someone you trust lies to you, remember that 
when you’re thinking about lying to someone else.
 
 Deal with others in a straightforward manner. Say what you think. The 
other person may not like it, but at least she knows where you stand.
 
 Are consistent. Don’t tell one person something in one situation and 
then tell someone else just the opposite in another situation.
 
 Seek to be righteous instead of always being right. Being right means 
you say or do something that is technically correct. Being righteous is 
a virtue that’s synonymous with being honorable, fair, and upstanding. 
The individual decides if he is right — society decides who is righteous.
 
Being ethical is not the same as being conscientious, but it is one important 
ingredient of conscientiousness.

Are You a Conscientious Objector?
To gauge how conscientious you are, take the following test. Be honest with 
yourself to get the most accurate results.
Circle one answer under each of the following questions:
 
1. Do you ever feel like you’re living a lie?
 
• No: 0
 
• Possibly: 1
 
• Probably: 2
 
• Definitely: 3
 
2. Do you have secrets you wouldn’t want anyone else — even your 
loved ones — to know?
 
• No: 0
 
• Possibly: 1
 
• Probably: 2
 
• Definitely: 3
 
3. Do other people consider you trustworthy?
 
• Definitely: 0
 
• Probably: 1
 
• Possibly: 2
 
• No: 3
Conformity counts
One aspect of conscientiousness has to do 
with social conformity — behaving in socially 
approved ways and espousing attitudes 
strongly endorsed by society. To conform — in 
Western society at least — means that you get 
as much education as you can, you hold down 
a job, you pay taxes, you vote, you salute the 
flag, you get married, you care for children, you 
respect your elders, you pay your bills on time, 
you stop when the light is red and go when it 
turns green, you wash your hands before you 
eat, you keep your dog on a leash, and so on.
One study showed that college students who 
were high on conformity seemed to do better 
under stress and were healthier than their 
counterparts who went their own way. And I 
bet they were happier, too.

If you scored 15 or less, you’re a highly conscientious person — good for 
you! If you scored 16 or above, you’re on the low side, suggesting that you 
may actually object — whether you realize it or not — to being conscien-
tious. If so, you may be keeping yourself from experiencing happiness.
In this chapter, I suggest a number of different ways to become a more con-
scientious person. Pick any one of these and make a concerted effort begin-
ning today to change that aspect of your behavior. Setting a goal for yourself 
is one step toward being a more conscientious person.

Part III
Behaving Your 
Way toward 
Happiness

In this part . . .
I
 offer you a range of proven behavioral strategies that 
will increase your potential for achieving true happi-
ness. The specific happiness tactics that I discuss here 
are all firmly supported by science, although I present 
them in understandable, non-jargon terminology.
I give you a simple five-step process for getting in the flow 
of life and experiencing the joys and pleasure that result. I 
show you how it’s possible to be happy even when you 
(or someone you love) is suffering from some type of 
unhappy life circumstance — like disease, unemployment, 
or post-traumatic stress.
You may also be surprised by how a simple, somewhat 
paradoxical writing exercise can lead to happiness and 
how empowering the right kind of smile can be.

W
hen Rachael hears her husband say, “I’m going up to the computer 
room for a while,” she knows that his pain has become unbearable. 
The victim of an industrial accident many years earlier, Don lives in a world 
of constant pain. The pain that began in his lower back now eclipses his 
entire body — a harsh reality that has left him unemployed, physically dis-
abled, and, at times, struggling to keep his sanity.
In the early years after his injury, Don relied on his doctors to provide him 
with pain relief. They tried a variety of painkillers and physical therapy, 
but nothing worked. Eventually, like millions of fellow pain sufferers, 
Don was left to manage his pain on his own. And that’s when he discov-
ered the miraculous benefit of “getting into flow.” Flow, according to Dr. 
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a Professor of Psychology at Claremont Graduate 
University in Claremont, California, is a state of positive consciousness that 
occurs in humans when they find themselves immersed in a challenging 
activity that is uniquely rewarding. Some people would suggest that flow 
comes from being able to lose yourself in some meaningful task, but actually 
it’s just the opposite. Flow is about finding yourself — your true self — by 
engaging in activities that make you happy.
If you were to ask Don what happens to his pain when he sits at his computer 
for an hour or two (prolonged sitting typically aggravates pain), he’d tell you, 
“I don’t have any pain — none. I’m absolutely pain-free. The pain only returns 
when I stop.” The key to Don’s pain relief, it seems, has to do with his ability 
to get into, instead of just getting on, the computer. Why is Don’s pain gone 
when he’s on the computer? Because Don loves working on the computer. 
He loves it so much that he enters a state of flow (a trance-like state where 
nothing else matters and you lose all track of time), which allows his mind to 
transcend his painful body. Flow works!

100
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
In this chapter, I apply the concept of flow to achieving happiness. I tell you 
why identifying the best moments of your life is important, and why you 
shouldn’t just settle for what you have in life, but pursue what you want. 
Finally, I lead you through a step-by-step program for getting into flow.
Where Flow Lives: Identifying the 
Best Moments of Your Life
If I asked you to identify the ten best moments of your life, could you do 
it? If it’s difficult for you, is that because you haven’t had that many “best 
moments” or because it’s been so long since you had one that you can’t 
remember? Are you just too busy trying to survive the modern-day rat race 
to have the time to think about such a thing?
I surveyed a small group of family and friends about the best moments in 
their lives — when they were experiencing pleasure that comes from flow — 
and this is what they had to say:
“A few years ago, I rebuilt a computer-injected spray truck at work. I ripped 
out all the old wiring, dismantled all the systems, and basically built a new 
truck. I did it all myself and I had a real sense of accomplishment.”
Twelve rules for achieving flow despite pain
Don is a happy man despite being in constant, 
disabling pain. How is that possible? Simple — 
he lives each day by the following 12 rules:
  Remember that you have the right to pursue 
happiness — no matter what.
  Stop being afraid of your pain.
  Be selfish — take care of yourself instead 
of depending on others.
  Accept yourself as you are — give yourself 
a feeling of legitimacy.
  Be your own best friend, not your worst 
enemy — don’t do things you know will 
aggravate your pain.
  Fight depression.
  Put your anger to good use (for example, in 
fitness training).
  Stay connected both intellectually and 
socially.
  Exert control where you can — be satisfied 
in controlling the little things.
  Look for small victories throughout the day.
  Have a focal point other than pain (for 
example, a hobby, your grandkids, your 
religion).
  Add some adventure back into your life — 
don’t be afraid to take a risk once in a while.

101
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
“I’m a photographer and I got a call telling me some work I had submitted 
to a major museum had been accepted for display. When I went there 
and personally handed off my work to them, it was a moment of great 
satisfaction.”
“I love to sew. That’s how I make my living — making women’s purses. 
It’s such a creative time for me. Time flies by. I don’t eat. I’m just into 
what I’m doing. The end result is what is so satisfying — each purse is 
unique.”
“I’m happy when I’m working in my garden — things are growing, bloom-
ing, and everything looks nice. It also makes me happy when I give away 
my plants — so that someone else can enjoy them like I do.”
“I love to go through old magazines that have stacked up over time. I can 
spend a whole day, sitting on the floor in my pajamas, leafing through 
hundreds of magazines, clipping out stories and coupons — all the while, 
as content as I can be.”
“The best moments of my life are the ones spent in my kitchen. I love to 
cook — preparing old favorites and trying out new, interesting dishes. My 
mother taught me to cook when I was a young girl. She was a great cook. 
We didn’t have a lot of money, but we ate like royalty.”
What do all these “best moments” have in common?
 
 The moments involve activities and experiences that people want to 
have in their lives, rather than ones they feel they have to have. You 
don’t spend your day culling through old magazines because it’s one of 
those chores you need to check off the “have to” list — you choose to 
do it because it makes you happy.
 
 Maybe the thought of culling through old magazines sounds about as 
awful to you as any chore you can think of. The key is that, for that 
person, it’s an activity she loves.
 
 The moments require your full attention. Getting into flow is a mindful 
thing. You have to be fully immersed in the moment. It’s an all-or-nothing 
experience.
Get  ting into flow versus going with the flow
Getting into flow is not the same as going with 
the flow. Going with the flow is about conform-
ing to the mainstream in terms of values, goals, 
and expectations — blending in, not rocking 
the boat, and being what other people want 
you be. As I discuss in Chapter 7, conformity 
counts when it comes to happiness, but so does 
marching to your own drum.

102
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
 
 The moments involve activities that are challenging and creative. 
Forget the routine stuff like cleaning the house, washing clothes, and 
most of the mindless things you do at work.
 
 The moments provide an immediate sense of reward. It’s the pleasure 
of the moment that makes it special. It’s not about delayed gratification, 
although some of that can be a good thing too.
 
 The moments involve doing something. Flow comes from utilizing 
skills — musical, mechanical, culinary — that you’ve developed through-
out your life. The more highly skilled you are, the easier it is to get into 
flow.
 
 The moments can occur anywhere — a tennis court, under the hood of 
a truck, or in your kitchen.
 
 The moments come from knowing yourself. Flow isn’t about losing your-
self, escaping — it’s about finding yourself, your true or authentic self, 
your happy self. That’s why each person has a different “best moment.”
 
What’s important is not what types of activities provide flow for my family and 
friends, but rather which activities in your life can serve in that regard. Take 
a sheet of paper and across the top write each of the following common ele-
ments of flow:
 
 Activities I Want to Do
 
 Activities I Can Become Absorbed In
 
 Activities I Find Challenging and Creative
 
 Activities That Provide an Immediate Feeling of Gratification
Now, in the left-hand margin, list activities you engage in at work and in your 
non-work life (leisure and relationship activities) that you think might pos-
sibly create flow. If you’re a teacher who loves what she does, you could list, 
“preparing lesson plans.” If you’re a collector, you could list, “checking out 
flea markets to see if I can find a new treasure to add to my collection.” Put 
a checkmark next to each of those activities indicating which, if any, of the 
flow criteria apply. Those activities that fit three or more of the criteria listed 
on top are ones that you should do more often if you want to experience the 
happiness that comes from flow. (Keep in mind that flow is only one source 
of happiness — many other sources are discussed throughout this book.)
Understanding Who You Really Are
One of the prerequisites of getting into flow has to do with knowing yourself. By 
that, I don’t just mean name, rank, and serial number: “I’m Doyle Gentry, a psy-
chologist, with a wife and two kids.” I mean something much more than that:

103
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
 
 What makes you tick?
 
 What makes you unique?
 
 What satisfies you and makes you happy?
 
 What gives your life a sense of purpose?
These are not easy questions to answer for some readers. In part, the difficulty 
lies in the fact that you may be too caught up in the daily “rat race” to have the 
time for some healthy introspection (examining one’s inner self). Also, if you’re 
one of those co-dependent personalities I talk about in Chapter 17, you’re more 
aware of what makes other people tick, what makes them unique, what makes 
them happy, and what gives their life a sense of purpose than you’re aware of 
these things in your own life.
I pose these questions now so that it will be easier for you to work your way 
through the four-step process of “Getting into Flow” outlined later in this 
chapter. 
 
It doesn’t take a lifetime to understand what’s unique about yourself. Some 
20-year-olds already have a clear sense of who they are — and can answer 
these questions without hesitation — whereas others who find themselves in 
the second half of life still don’t have a clue.
 
Every experience you encounter in life — good or bad — shapes and ulti-
mately defines who you are. Your job is to learn from each of those experi-
ences and progress, slowly but surely, toward what the eminent American 
psychologist Abraham Maslow called a state of self-actualization. According 
to Maslow, you can only get to this point when your biological needs are ade-
quately and consistently satisfied, when you feel secure, when you feel loved 
and supported by significant others, and when you have developed a sense of 
mastery over life — again, you don’t have to wait for the end of life’s journey 
to be self-actualized, and some never make it no matter how long they live. 
(For more about Maslow, check out Chapter 1.)
Some of the understanding of who you really are — what satisfies you and 
gives your life a sense of purpose — comes from experimenting with employ-
ment opportunities. That same understanding can also head off a midlife 
crisis. Both of these issues are addressed in the next two sections.
The importance of taking a bad job
Dr. Csikszentmihalyi noted that, contrary to what you might imagine, people 
experience more opportunities for flow at work than they typically do in their 
free time. But, that depends, of course, on whether you like what you do for 
a living or not. My wife and I encouraged our kids to get jobs from the time 
they were old enough to be responsible, beginning in the ninth grade, not 
just to make money or learn a work ethic, but so they could begin to discover 

104
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
which types of work suited them – and led to enjoyment - and which did not. 
Because you’re going to spend most of your waking life working in some 
capacity, you’re better off working at something that gives your life a sense 
of purpose and pleasure — something that allows you to utilize your strong 
points every day.
With each new job, including ones they had in college as well as after they 
graduated, we often heard them say, “This job sucks. I thought I would like 
it, but I don’t. The money is good, but I’m bored out of my skull — and, I’m 
getting depressed.” My answer was always the same: “Well, good, I’m glad to 
hear it!” Of course, my kids wanted to know what was so good about realizing 
that they didn’t like their jobs. And I always said, “It’s good because now you 
know one more thing you don’t want to spend your life doing — a job that will 
never bring you happiness. That frees you up to go out searching for some-
thing you’re better suited for.”
 
If you find yourself in a job or other experience that is making you miserable, 
think of it as one more piece of evidence that tells you what you don’t want to 
be doing. In other words, every time you find a job you hate, you’re one step 
closer to finding the job you’ll love.
 
Life is an experiment and, as with all experiments, you’re seeking truth — 
in this case, the truth about who you really are and what makes you happy. 
The way science works is that each time an experiment fails, it brings you 
closer to the truth. And so it is with life. The important thing is to keep on 
experimenting!
How to avoid a midlife crisis
Knowing who you really are not only helps you stay in flow, it will also keep 
you from experiencing the dreaded midlife crisis we hear so much about.
The notion that a midlife crisis is inevitable as soon as you turn 40 years of 
age is untrue. If you reach your 40s and you haven’t yet begun to live life on 
your own terms, you could experience a crisis. The good news is it doesn’t 
have to be this way.
Consider this exchange between myself and a 47-year-old man who came to 
me in a highly depressed, agitated state:
Client: I’m just so sick and tired of always doing what other people want. 
I never get to do what I want — it’s always “You need to do this; you need 
to do that; go here; go there.” There’s no end to it.
Gentry: So, tell me what you want to do this coming weekend.
Client: I have to go to my son’s baseball game on Saturday, and my wife 
wants. . . .

105
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
Gentry: (Interrupting) Excuse me, but I asked you what you wanted to 
do, not what they wanted you to do. Isn’t that what you’re complaining 
about — that no one asks about or cares what you want to do? Well, I’m 
asking.
Client: (Silent and looking more agitated)
Gentry: You seem to be having trouble answering my question. How do 
you feel right now?
Client: I’m upset — angry — because I don’t know what to say.
Gentry: Precisely. I can see you’re angry — your face is red and your 
fists are all balled up. Now, try to look at this from my perspective. 
You’re a middle-aged man who has done everything that life has asked 
or demanded of you. You’re a real boy scout! And, you’re successful as 
far as the material things of life go. But you can’t tell me how you want 
to spend one day of your life without referring to everybody else’s needs 
rather than your own. Does that seem right to you?
Client: (looking very sad and tearful) No, it doesn’t.
Gentry: Well, we’re agreed on that. Now all we have to do is help you find 
the answer to that question and maybe then you’ll start enjoying life for a 
change.
This man was in crisis not because of his age, not because he made a lot of 
money at his job, not because he had a lovely wife and three great kids — he 
was in crisis because he had made it halfway through his life and he had no 
clue about who he really was.
 
The time to deal with a midlife crisis is before it happens. Don’t wait for all 
the wheels to fall off — psychologically speaking — at the same time! The 
vast majority of folks actually enter midlife feeling pretty good about the way 
their life is going. They’re in flow enough to make life worthwhile and fun. And 
that’s what will sustain them during the second half of life. However, if you’re 
not one of those fortunate people, then you’ll definitely want to take steps to 
engineer more flow in your life, which I get to later in the chapter.
Being Happy Today — Not Next Week, 
Next Month, or Next Year
When it comes to flow, let your motto be: Procrastination be gone! Make 
today a happy day — don’t wait for tomorrow. Be proactive. Flow activities 
don’t always present themselves; you have to create them.
Imagine if the young woman earlier in this chapter had decided not to “waste 
time” going through old magazines. Imagine if the young man had decided it 
was too much trouble submitting his photographs for display in the prestigious 

106
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
museum. Imagine staying out of the kitchen, when you’re an excellent cook, 
because it’s cheaper to eat out when there’s only the two of you. In the absence 
of all these experiences, these folks would have a hard time being happy.
The dessert theory of happiness
Some people ascribe to the dessert theory of happiness — that is, they 
believe that their happiness only comes as a by-product of meeting other 
people’s needs. A wife, for example, may think the entree consists of satisfy-
ing her husband’s needs and wants, as well as those of her children, parents, 
in-laws, and so forth. If she addresses her own needs, it’s an afterthought — a 
sweet moment at the end of a long and tiring day. Problem is that by the time 
she gets to dessert, she’s lost her appetite!
Getting into flow shouldn’t be an afterthought. It should be something you do 
for yourself periodically throughout the day while you still have the energy 
necessary to be creative and fully utilize your skills in challenging activities. 
Reorder your priorities and have your dessert first. Take care of number one 
before you begin taking care of numbers two, three, and so on.
Waiting for the ship that never came in
You may also be one of those people for whom happiness is a reward that 
automatically comes as a result of honest, hard work. When I was a kid, my 
father frequently said that he was “waiting for his ship to come in” — alluding 
to the fact that the eventual reward for a lifetime spent in hard, honest labor 
was a little peace, relaxation, and pleasure at the end of life. Toward that end, 
my father worked tirelessly day in and day out without complaint. Other than 
when he went fishing, which was his way of getting into flow, I never remem-
ber him being happy. He lived a very unbalanced life — all work and no play 
(see Chapter 15) — and he paid for it by dying much earlier than most of 
his brothers and sisters. After we buried him and I was driving his old, ram-
shackle car back to his house, I couldn’t help thinking that he waited all his 
life for the ship that never came in.
Strive to be happy each and every day of your life. It’s possible to work hard 
and be happy at the same time. My father didn’t understand that, but I’m 
hoping you will.
Appreciating the importance of Being Happy Today will hopefully motivate 
you to take those steps I outline later on in this chapter that lead you into a 
state of flow — and, happiness.

107
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
Pursuing What You Want, 
Not What You Have
If you’re like me and millions of other folks, you spend the bulk of your time and 
energy pursuing what you already have in life rather than what you want. You 
get up every morning and pursue — continue, maintain, carry on with — the 
same job you’ve had for years. You pursue the same handful of relationships 
with family and friends that have provided you with comfort and support over 
the years. You play golf with the same foursome, at the same course, teeing off 
at the same time on the same day week after week. That’s what you’re doing. My 
question is: What are you not doing?
Redirecting your life with therapy
Self-discovery — and the happiness that results 
from it — is not always a planned thing. Nor is it 
a journey that everyone can take alone. That’s 
where therapy can help.
Sue was clearly skeptical when she was 
referred to a psychotherapist by her orthope-
dic surgeon. She was experiencing constant 
back pain, resulting from an injury at work, and, 
“How in the world,” she asked herself, “can 
seeing a psychologist help relieve my pain?” 
The answer — though not evident to Sue at the 
time — was “by restoring you to a happy and 
productive life.” Like most people suffering from 
intractable pain, she desperately looking for 
someone to turn her life around to what it had 
been before she was injured. A new, redirected 
life was not on her radar screen.
Sue was clinically depressed, hopeless, and on 
the verge of suicide. “What have I got to look 
forward to,” she asked “but a lifetime of pain 
and disability? I can never be happy again — 
doing the things I used to do — so what’s the 
point of going on?” Sue was at a standstill.
What her therapist helped her understand over 
the months and years ahead was that, when 
it comes to the human brain, pleasure always 
trumps pain. With the therapist’s help, Sue 
got her smile back (see Chapter 12) and for 
the first time in a long time she laughed more 
than she cried. Slowly but surely, Sue substi-
tuted new pleasures for old ones. In her prior 
life, before injury, she got into flow by mowing 
her 2-acre yard (she fancied herself the great-
est, most precise mower of all time with land-
scape skills comparable to a surgeon). In her 
reconstructed life, she became the “queen of 
comics” — spending hours on end search-
ing magazines and newspapers for cartoons, 
which she then distributed to friends and family 
(and even her doctors) on a frequent basis. And 
what was happening to her pain all the while? 
It had taken a backseat to feelings of joy and 
contentment and, thus, was no longer dominat-
ing her life. Sue is somewhere out there, I feel 
certain, having one best moment of her life after 
another — pain or no pain.
Remember: There’s no shame in seeking coun-
seling or coaching. It’s no different from seek-
ing out your lawyer for legal advice, seeking out 
a physician when your body tells you there’s 
something wrong with it, or seeking out the 
clergy when you find yourself wandering in the 
spiritual desert. It’s all about redirection.

Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
You’re not challenging yourself. You’re not building new skills. And you’re not 
proceeding toward Maslow’s final stage of personal growth and development — 
self-actualization, the stage at which humans are most happy. Without realizing 
it or consciously intending to, you’ve settled for security and support at the 
expense of self-discovery. This, quite understandably, eliminates a good bit of 
the anxiety and uncertainty that accompanies life change.
We’re happy when we achieve those things in life — at any stage — that we 
want. The problem is that as soon as we achieve them and we get used to them, 
they cease to make us happy. Then we have to find something else that we want 
in order to be happy once again. It’s what’s called the hedonic treadmill.
 
If you’re no longer happy with the status quo, here’s what you need to do:
 
 Explore life. Don’t be afraid to try new things — new foods, new vaca-
tion spots, or new types of reading material (the Wall Street Journal 
in place of your home town newspaper). Take your mind and body to 
places they’ve never been before.
 
 Question life. If you’re listening to the world news, don’t just passively 
accept what the commentator says — question it: “Do I agree with what 
she’s saying about the war in Iraq or not?”
 
 Examine life. Pay greater attention to what’s going on around you and 
put all those meaningful issues in your life under your own microscope. 
Abortion, racism, affirmative action, gay parenting, and government-
sponsored health insurance — none of these are simple issues and 
they need to be examined more closely before you decide how you feel 
about them.
 
 Judge life. Don’t be afraid to make your own judgments about what con-
stitutes right and wrong, fair and unfair, just and unjust, what will make 
you happy and unhappy — it’s your right.
 
 Ponder life’s possibilities. Don’t just settle for life as they way it is — 
consider, “What if things were different?” Open your mind to alternative 
possibilities no matter what aspect of life you’re dealing with.
 
 Experience all of what life has to offer. I had a lapel pin once that read 
“This is not a dress rehearsal.” How true! 
 
 Let yourself feel — even when what you feel is uncomfortable. You’re 
wired to have lots of different emotions — joy, anger, fear, sadness. As I 
point out in Chapter 4, emotions are your nervous system’s way of com-
municating with you without using words. If you shut off the feelings, 
you shut off the messages behind them.
 
 Learn to trust your feelings. Intuition is a good thing. Your brain is tell-
ing you, “I’ve been in a similar situation before and here’s what I think 
you should do right now.”

109
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
 
 Start looking at life as a glass half-full rather than half-empty (see 
Chapter 5). Optimism always leads to hope; pessimism all too often 
leads to despair. 
 
 Seek diversity in all things. Understanding diversity is really about 
understanding how each of us is unique.
 
 Let curiosity reign. Curiosity is the emotion that makes it easy for us to 
explore, question, examine, and ponder all of what life has to offer.
 
 Quit holding back on passion. If something makes you happy, let the 
world know it.
 
 Stretch, moving beyond your usual comfort zone. Every once in a 
while, try something unfamiliar, something more challenging than you’re 
used to, or something without a predictable outcome.
Getting into Flow: A Four-Step Process
So you’re sold on the concept of flow and now you want to get into flow in 
your life. But how? You’ve come to the right section. Here, I lead you through 
a step-by-step process that will help you get involved in something so deeply 
that nothing else will seem to matter.
Step 1: Identifying your sources of flow
Flow is the end result when you apply a set of skills to a challenging situation.
If you have skills but they’re unchallenged, the best you can hope for is a feel-
ing of relaxation that quickly turns to boredom. An example is someone with 
landscaping skills who is simply mowing the lawn.
If you find yourself in a challenging situation, but you lack the skills neces-
sary to deal with the situation effectively, you end up anxious or angry.  
If you lack skills and challenge, you end up disinterested, apathetic, and dis-
satisfied.

110
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
 
Start with a list of skills you possess that have to do with sports, hobbies, 
career, socializing, and artistic endeavors. Examples include
 
 Writing poetry
 
 Golfing
 
 Organizing social events at work and in the community
 
 Writing fiction or nonfiction
 
 Playing tennis
 
 Fly-fishing
 
 Coin or stamp collecting
 
 Participating in Civil War reenactments
 
 Painting
 
 Gardening
 
 All types of crafts — pottery, basket-making, jewelry
 
 Cooking
 
 Playing cards
 
 Wine-making
 
 Volunteering for political campaigns
You’re never too old to follow your dream
Even as a child, I had aspirations of being a 
writer. I dreamed of writing novels and being 
well-known like Hawthorne, Poe, Hemingway, 
and Michener. Writing came easy to me and 
my teachers often told me I had a “gift.” I was 
always happy when I was writing something — 
even my doctoral dissertation, if you can believe 
that! And, yet, I never even thought about writ-
ing as a career.
In college, I started out studying to be a chem-
ist, quickly switched to economics, then to soci-
ology, and finally to psychology — but I never 
gave a thought to being an English major. In my 
early academic career, I had no problem with 
academic writing — for many of my colleagues, 
writing was a chore, but not for me.
Only toward the end of my career did I finally 
allow myself to embrace the identity of a writer. 
I joined a literary guild and told my children, 
“After I’m dead and people ask you what your 
father did for a living, tell them he was a writer.” 
So, as I write Happiness For Dummies, I can 
honestly say I’m a happy man. My only regret is 
that I took 55 years to take the plunge.
If there’s something you’ve always wanted 
to do, now’s the time to do it! You’re never too 
old — I can attest to that!

111
 Chapter 8: Getting into Flow
After you’ve identified your skills, ask yourself three questions:
 
 When is the last time I did any of those things?
 
 Are there activities that I haven’t gotten involved with before, but that 
I’d like to do?
 
 Am I letting my skills atrophy by not challenging them?
 
If you’re a bridge player, have you ever signed up for a bridge tournament? 
How about trying out a new — and more difficult — golf course next time you 
play? If you’re a writer and you’re not ready to tackle the challenge of writing a 
book, why not submit an article to a magazine? (Either way you get your name 
in print!)
Step 2: Taking the plunge
 
Getting into flow is a process, and like any other process it has to have a 
beginning before it can have a middle and an end. Earlier in this chapter, I 
cover the importance of pursuing what you want rather than just settling for 
what you have, as well as the risks associated with procrastinating. Now is the 
time for action! Don’t spend the rest of your life standing on the edge of the 
diving board being afraid to take the plunge — go ahead and make a splash!
I often hear people — including myself — say, “I don’t have time to write, to 
play golf, to go cycling with a group of my friends in the mountains.” But the 
reality is, you have the same 24 hours you had on the day you were born and 
that you’ll have on the day you die — no more, no less. Getting into flow is 
not a question of how much time you have; it’s a question of how you choose 
to use it. Why not start using your time in ways that make you happy?
Step 3: Giving yourself enough time
Flow is a timeless state, but it does take a certain amount of time to get there. 
It’s not something that you can hurry up.
I had a client who came to me for help in stress management. I gave him an 
audiotape of a standard 20-minute relaxation exercise and suggested that 
he listen to it daily. When he returned the next week, I asked him about the 
tape and he said, “I haven’t had time to listen to it and, besides, you said it 
takes 20 minutes — don’t you have anything shorter?” Instead of challeng-
ing him, I gave him a 10-minute tape. The next week it was the same thing, 
“I really didn’t have time to listen to the second tape — do you have one 
that’s shorter, maybe four or five minutes?” You see how foolish this sounds. 
Telling yourself to hurry up and relax is just as senseless as telling yourself to 
hurry up and get into flow.

112
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
The irony is that after you get into flow, time no longer matters. You’re not 
even conscious of it. Time only matters before and after.
 
Flow is about being so highly engaged in an activity that you lose track of time. 
Take off your watch when you’re trying to get into flow — it only makes it 
easier to lose track of time when you don’t know what time it is. (You can find 
more about this in Chapter 15.)
Step 4: Making flow a regular 
part of your day
People make all kinds of other things part of their regular day — including 
negative things like anger outbursts, substance abuse, a tedious and boring 
job, and hot-button relationships. Why not add in opportunities for getting 
into flow, being grateful, and doing things you enjoy doing?
Jason used to come home from the office every day exhausted and in an irri-
table mood. More often than he would like, he ended up barking at his wife 
and kids over the least little thing. Evenings at home were not idyllic and 
not something he looked forward to. Then he changed his routine to include 
stopping off at a nearby school to walk on the track. He quickly developed a 
proficiency at walking and managed to cover between 3 and 5 miles without 
effort. The whole time he was walking, he was in a zone, oblivious to anything 
and anyone around him. He was in flow. When Jason finally arrived at home, 
he was in a positive, receptive mood and there was no more complaining. He 
was a happy man and so was his family.
 
How can you enrich your day and get into flow? If you rarely or never experi-
ence flow, start by trying to make flow a part of your week. When you’re get-
ting into flow once a week, try upping it to three or four times a week. And 
then try making it a part of every day.
Looking back — with regret or satisfaction
The eminent American psychologist Erik Erikson 
cautions that, at the end of life, human beings 
reflect on the kind of people they’ve been and 
the type of lives they’ve lived. If you’ve lived the 
right kind of life — one that made you happy — 
you’re left with a sense of satisfaction and integ-
rity; otherwise, you end your days with regret 
and despair. And as you face death, you’ll be 
comforted by all those best moments of your life 
that will easily come to mind.

n this chapter, I explain how to make sense out of adversity — it’s called 
benefit-finding. Benefit-finding is about finding the good in the bad. Not 
only can finding a silver lining in an otherwise bad situation ease your suf-
fering, it can produce a greater appreciation of what life offers, an increased 
connection with your inner self, and a heightened sense of compassion — all 
of which can lead to happiness.
An antidote to demoralization
Health psychologist Roger Katz and his col-
leagues at the University of the Pacific stud-
ied how patients with cancer and lupus coped 
with their illness. To their surprise, patients 
were more likely to report some benefit 
coming from their illness than they were to feel 
demoralized — helpless, cynical, defensive. 
They acknowledged, for example, that being 
ill helped them communicate more openly 
with their families and helped them be better 
friends. Benefit-finding was also associated 
with less pain and suffering — including anger, 
depression, and fatigue.

114
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
I asked Tom, a relative of mine who had a massive heart attack at age 45, if he 
thought that his life was in any way better off afterward. Tom said:
Oh, absolutely. It gave me a chance to reflect on my life — to look at 
where I was before and where I am now. Before the attack, I was work-
ing long hours and under lots of stress. I love my family, but I took them 
for granted. I realized that I wasn’t there for them except in a material 
sense, and I missed a lot. So, I shifted my priorities — now family comes 
first and work second. I’m part of their lives now, not just a stranger who 
comes home every night and puts food on the table.
The heart attack also changed how I treat people at work. I cut back 
my hours and began to let my employees and my partner take on more 
responsibility. I didn’t take back any of the stuff I had relinquished while 
I was in the hospital and during my recovery. And, I learned that I could 
trust them to get the job done right — something I hadn’t felt before. You 
might say we’re more like a family at work now, too. We depend on each 
other more than we ever have.
Something that happens so unexpectedly forces you to ask yourself 
what is really important in life. I know it did me. Truthfully, and this is 
going to sound funny, if I hadn’t had that heart attack six years ago, 
I’d be dead now.
Tom was presented with a challenge, and he’s found the benefit in it. Being 
able to do that in your own life will help you be a happier person. In this 
chapter, I show you how.
A picture of illness
In a class I was teaching on health psychology, 
I asked students to draw a picture of illness. I 
wanted them to depict in visual terms how they 
perceived the idea of being ill — and how they 
would act if they were ill.
After they were done with their drawings, we 
had show-and-tell, where each student had to 
come before the class and explain his drawing. 
Virtually everyone produced negative drawings. 
Illness, as they saw it, was gloomy, sad, limiting, 
and an experience that greatly diminished their 
life. No one wants to be sick. Illness sucks! But, 
if people expect to handle illness badly, they 
usually do. It’s one thing to experience physi-
cal pain — from cancer or arthritis — but it’s 
another to suffer emotional pain — bitterness, 
frustration, depression — which is what hap-
pens when people give in to illness and accept 
disability as an inevitability.
This is the point Mitch Albom makes in his 
powerful book Tuesdays with Morrie (Time 
Warner): It’s possible to die a horrible death 
without losing your sense of optimism, good 
humor, and zest for life.

115
 Chapter 9: Finding Benefit in Life’s Challenges
Having the Right Perspective
Unlike other animals, humans have the gift of perspective, and perspective 
is about choice! As I discuss in Chapter 5, you can choose to see life as a 
glass half-full (optimistic) or a glass half-empty (pessimistic). Similarly, in 
Chapter 6, I discuss the difference between a hardy person and a non-hardy 
person — it all comes down to whether you define problems as challenges or 
crises. Having the right perspective is a key to achieving happiness. In this 
section, I show you how to get perspective on the challenges you face.
Asking yourself whether 
the sky really is falling
When tragedy strikes, most people initially feel as if there’s no tomorrow. 
This response is nothing to be ashamed of — it just means we’re human. The 
key is moving beyond that initial response and getting some perspective on 
the situation. To accomplish that, it helps to:
 
 Think of what you’ve done in similar crisis situations in life. Similar 
doesn’t necessarily mean the same. For example, if you find yourself 
grappling with the bad news that you have prostate cancer, you might 
ask yourself “What did I do when I got fired from that job I had years 
ago – that I loved?” or “What did I do when my wife up and left me saying 
she didn’t love me anymore?” After all, a crisis is a crisis — if the sky 
didn’t fall the last time, it won’t fall this time.
 
 Recall what others have done in this same situation. How did your 
brother react when he found out that he had cancer? If you’re not sure, 
by all means call him up and ask him how he kept from panicking. Try 
looking at the sky from his perspective.
 
 Think in non-catastrophic terms. Instead of thinking “This is awful, ter-
rible, horrible,” say to yourself “This is bad — certainly not something I 
wanted to hear.” Remember: Your brain listens to what you think as well 
as what you say — if you think the sky is falling, your brain will act as if 
it is and you will end up feeling overwhelmed. 
 
When something bad happens to me, I too think of some of the worst times 
in my life and then ask myself if what is going on right now is that bad. 
Invariably, the answer is a resounding no. I tell myself, “Hey, if you survived 
the worst times in your life and went on to better times, the same thing will 
happen in this case.” And it does. If you’re younger than me (and most people 

116
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
are – I’m 64) and you haven’t had all that many crises in your life yet, adopt-
ing a non-catastrophic perspective may be difficult. It might help if you talked 
to someone older about the challenge you’re facing and see what they think. 
Parents can be helpful here along with life coaches, counselors, and clergy 
(especially if you’re dealing with a spiritual crisis). 
Being optimistic
Benefit-finding is greatly aided by having an optimistic attitude. Optimists 
don’t deny that bad things happen in life — they just refuse to dwell exclu-
sively on the negative. They leave open the possibility of finding the good in 
the bad.
Nancy, a young woman in her late 30s who had hurt her back while working 
as a nurse, was an optimist. “At first I was disheartened. I loved being a nurse 
and I hated losing my job. But I couldn’t continue to work with all this pain,” 
she said “Eventually, I decided to look on the bright side of things: Being 
unemployed — while not my choice — did allow me to be a stay-at-home 
mom to my three kids while they were growing up. We’re a lot closer, 
I’m sure, than we would have been otherwise. At least I have that to be 
thankful for.”
Ben, also in his 30s and a victim of chronic pain, was not an optimist. Ben 
could only see the negatives of what life had to offer following his injury — 
loss of income, no longer having contact with his buddies at work, and a 
perception of himself as being of no use to anyone. He was an angry man, 
bitter, and resistant to any notion that life could still be meaningful in 
some way. Sadly, Ben died of a heart attack at the age of 41, and even his car-
diologist admitted it was the result of a broken heart.
Optimists rebound faster!
A study published in the journal Health 
Psychology by researchers at the University 
of Helsinki looked at the effect of optimism and 
pessimism on how quickly 5,000 employees 
rebounded from a major stress — death or 
severe illness in a family member. Employees 
high on optimism had fewer sick days as a result 
of this type of stress than did their counterparts 
who were low on optimism. Whether employ-
ees were high or low on pessimism appeared 
to make no difference whatsoever.
Bottom line: Pessimism may not hurt you, but an 
optimistic outlook sure helps.

117
 Chapter 9: Finding Benefit in Life’s Challenges
There are some definite advantages to having an optimistic outlook. Here’s 
the short list (see Chapter 5 for a more extensive list):
 
 Optimists are more self-confident.
 
 Optimists are more likely to be problem-solvers.
 
 Optimists persist despite adversity — they’re not quitters.
 
 Optimists welcome second chances at life.
 
 Optimists are less likely to assign blame for their misfortunes.
Asking the Right Questions
Benefit-finding is the result of asking yourself the right questions about the 
impact of tragedy on your life. It requires some introspection, some self-
analysis, and a connection with your inner self. You have to decide if there 
is something beneficial about a negative life situation — others can’t do that 
for you.
What can I do now that
I couldn’t do before?
Loss, tragedy, and adversity leave people changed in some way. So when 
tragedy strikes, the first question you need to ask yourself is: What can I do 
now that I couldn’t do before?
Tom, my cousin who suffered a heart attack, found that he could do a 
number of things he couldn’t do before:
 
 He learned that he could delegate responsibility more at work and still 
run a highly successful business.
 
 For the first time in his life he was able to trust in someone other than 
himself.
 
 He was a better husband and parent, because he knew that it wasn’t just 
about being a provider and a care-taker.
 
 He was able to communicate more openly with family and friends.
 
 He was more emotional — he hugged more, cried more, and laughed more.
 
 He was able to reset his priorities, making his family number one and 
putting work in second.

118
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
When you add it all up, Tom’s answer to the question “What can I do now 
that I couldn’t do before?” was simple: “I can be a loving human being!”
 
Think about some misfortune you’ve encountered in your life and ask the 
same question of yourself. Give it some serious thought before you answer. If 
you’re not sure, ask someone close to you if she’s noticed any positive change 
in you since that event. The changes may be there — you just may not be 
aware of them.
Why have I been given this opportunity?
At this point, you’re probably saying to yourself, “Opportunity? What oppor-
tunity? How do tragedies and challenges give me opportunity?” Perspective 
is all about choice. And with choice comes opportunity — opportunity to 
choose how to respond.
The question is why you and why now? These questions are not simple. 
Sure, people say, “God doesn’t give you anything he doesn’t think you can’t 
handle,” but my guess is it’s more complicated than that. Maybe Tom got 
the opportunity to rethink how he was living his life at age 45 because, by 
that time, he had lived long enough to appreciate the patterns in his life that 
were destroying him. Patterns — good or bad — take time to emerge. Maybe 
his opportunity came then because he was still young enough and otherwise 
healthy enough to survive the event, whereas, as he himself suggested, had 
it occurred later on he would have died. Or, it could be that he’s been given 
this opportunity because there is some greater purpose to his life — some-
thing out in front of him — that he has not yet discovered.
 
You don’t have to believe in God or fate or destiny to believe that you’ve been 
given this opportunity for a reason. All you have to do is decide on what that 
reason is — you get to choose.
Coping: What works and what doesn’t
Research has shown that people who cope 
most effectively with life stresses, ranging from 
the minor hassles to the major catastrophes, 
do so by adopting a problem-solving approach 
to whatever they’re up against and utilizing the 
support of those around them. On the other 
hand, people who cope ineffectively with these 
same stresses tend to engage in wishful think-
ing (“I wish this hadn’t happened”), impulsive 
behavior (throwing a temper tantrum), denial 
(“Problem? What problem?”), and blame (“It’s 
their damn fault!”). The choice is yours.

119
 Chapter 9: Finding Benefit in Life’s Challenges
Am I up to the challenge?
My years of clinical practice tell me that most ordinary people are capable 
of surviving difficult — even monumental — challenges. Most people are 
much tougher and hardier than they realize. Remember: Hardy people have 
a strong sense of internal control (What can I do to benefit from this experi-
ence?) and they are actively committed to life before tragedy strikes. They’re 
also more likely to be happy than less-hardy people are.
 
Past history can be a clue to the future. When faced with some bad circum-
stance, ask yourself: How have I dealt with other misfortunes in the past? 
I managed to survive, didn’t I? (If not, you wouldn’t be sitting here reading 
Happiness For Dummies.) What did I do to cope that helped? Can I use those 
same tools now?
Making Sure You Realize the Benefit
Benefit-finding is not an automatic thing. You don’t suddenly think in the 
midst of some unfortunate circumstance in life, “Wow, this isn’t that bad after 
all.” Benefit-finding is a process — one that takes energy, requires that you 
forge closer ties to those around you, involves several stages of readjustment, 
and requires that you develop a concrete plan as to how you plan to change 
your life for the better.
Redirecting your energies
Dealing with adversity takes a lot of energy — physical and psychological — 
especially when you see your circumstances as beyond your control. Initially, 
what little energy you have can easily end up being channeled into negative 
thoughts, feelings, and actions, which keep you from moving forward with 
your life.
Ben, the pessimistic young man with the bad back, is a good example. He 
stayed angry for 11 years between the time of his disabling accident and his 
death. His wife wasn’t surprised that he dropped dead in the middle of an 
angry conversation on the phone one morning — she had been waiting for that 
day to come for a long time. As an expression of his never-ending anger, Ben 
had refused to associate with any of his former coworkers, rebuking them even 
when they reached out in compassion: “I don’t need people feeling sorry for 
me!” That mantle of anger finally became too heavy for his heart to bear.

120
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Too much of Ben’s energy was focused on his past and all the losses he had 
suffered because of his injury. A lot of his energy was also directed at ways 
to just survive the day — venting his anger on anyone who would listen in 
an effort to relieve built-up tension, moving back and forth from the recliner 
to the bed seeking comfort, and resisting efforts by family and friends to do 
something productive with his life.  Ben loved children and he had been a 
baseball player in his youth, so he was repeatedly invited to coach his son’s 
little league team. His answer was always the same — no! 
 
So, how can you redeploy your energy so that you don’t end up demoralized — 
feeling hopeless and helpless — by a challenge? How can you put the challenge 
to good use? Better yet, how can you use it to achieve some measure of happi-
ness? Simple, you have to:
 
 Shift your time frame. The benefit you’re seeking has to do with the 
future, not the past. Sitting around ruminating or sulking about the past 
will only keep you “stuck” where you are – in a state of perpetual distress. 
Make sure your mind stays focused on the days, weeks, and months 
ahead – “I’m going to run some errands for my wife this afternoon. I’m 
looking forward to spending time with my grandson later this week — I’ll 
take him to the zoo. Next month is when we’re going to the beach for a 
week — when I get down there, I don’t seem to hurt as much.”
 
 Focus on what you can control, not what you can’t. Ben can’t control 
his pain or get back all the things he lost because of it. What he could do 
instead is think about all the countless things he still can do which he’s 
not because he’s mired down in self-pity and regret (which are under-
standable, but nevertheless unproductive). Think ability rather than dis-
ability and, trust me, you’ll feel a whole lot better!
 
 Be productive in both thought and deed. Reliving a trauma that hap-
pened to you years ago day after day is counter-productive if you’re 
looking for a way to achieve a moment of happiness — all it does is 
bring back pain. Resisting all efforts to get you back into the mainstream 
of life is also counterproductive. Better to think “What can I do?” and 
then do it.
Mind over mat ter
A study of 136 patients who had suffered rheu-
matoid arthritis (RA) for an average of sixteen 
years revealed that those who acknowledged 
some type of interpersonal benefit from their 
illness were less physically disabled — walking, 
dressing themselves — than those who viewed 
RA as an all-negative experience.

121
 Chapter 9: Finding Benefit in Life’s Challenges
Forging closer ties to those around you
The vast majority of benefit that people find in the aftermath of misfortune 
comes from their interpersonal relationships — their connections to other 
people. People end up forging closer ties to those around them. How do they 
do that? They do it by taking the following advice:
 
 When loved ones offer you support, accept it with appreciation 
instead of pushing it away. This is no time for foolish pride which only 
keeps people at a distance. People want to help, so let them. And, always 
remember to say “thanks.”
 
 When others offer compassion and empathy, respond in kind. 
Remember: You’re not the only one in the world who’s hurting in some 
way. People need you as much as you need them.
 
 Educate others about your problem. You have to tell your story in a 
way that helps those around you understand all of what you’re going 
through and why you’re meeting the challenge the way you are. Don’t 
whine — educate!
 
 Discover the kindness of strangers. Friends often start out as strangers 
who want to help and the relationship evolves from there. If you turn 
away the kindness, you offend the person on the other end.
 
 Foster better relationships with professionals whose help you need. 
Doctors and lawyers (and, yes, psychologists) are human beings too — 
it never hurts to ask them “How are things with you? How’s your son 
doing — I heard he was in an automobile accident?”
Making the necessary adjustments
When human beings face life-altering challenges, they have to make adjust-
ments. In doing so, they must do three things:
 
 They evaluate the situation. “What just happened? How bad is it?”
 
 They make judgments about the situation. “I really don’t think I can 
handle this.” “This will work out.”
 
 They react to the situation. “I’m going to make someone pay for this.”
But, these evaluations, judgments, and reactions are subject to change over 
time. The changes are predictable and follow a rather specific pattern or 
sequence (known as stages of adjustment).
The first stage I call turnaround because what you really want initially is to 
believe that your misfortune can be fixed or reversed. The problem is that 
the kind of challenges we’re talking about in this chapter — cancer, lupus, 
arthritis, loss of a child, severe depression — can’t be undone.

122
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
The second stage has to do with survival, which typically involves a roller 
coaster of emotions — anger, sadness, fear — which is anything but enjoyable.
If you’re lucky (or get the right kind of help), you progress to the third 
stage — reconstruction. This final stage I like to think about as the “good 
news,” stage and this is where benefit-finding comes into play. As you begin 
to move beyond survival, you start to behave in ways that increasingly bring 
joy back into your life.
 
Which of the following three statements best describes your current attitude 
about significant challenges in your life?
 
 Maybe if I don’t think about it, it’ll go away.
 
 Why get up in the morning? I just want to hide in my warm, safe bed.
 
 My life has changed and I’ve changed with it — and, it’s not so bad.
If you chose the first statement, you’re in the turnaround stage. If you said 
the second statement, that suggests that you’re just surviving. And if you 
chose the third statement, that means you’ve entered into the world of per-
sonal reconstruction.
Making a revised life plan
Major life challenges involving trauma and loss disrupt your life and force 
you to redirect your energies, interests, and commitments. But how do you 
do that? It’s not easy to revise your life and move into a positive, more satis-
fying future. But these steps can get you moving in the right direction:
 
1. Create a positive mindset by sitting quietly with your eyes closed 
while opening your mind to the possibility of hope, optimism, and cre-
ative behavioral change.
Fighting spirit
Cancer patients who exhibit a “fighting 
spirit” — who accept the verdict of having 
a terminal disease, but who are determined 
to fight back by living a full life to the end — 
survive longer than patients who resign them-
selves to their fate or who appear overwhelmed 
by the bad news. The fighting spirit is about 
taking charge of every aspect of your daily life 
and dealing with illness on your own terms. It’s 
not about being angry — it’s about being the 
boss of your own life!

123
 Chapter 9: Finding Benefit in Life’s Challenges
 
 Take ten exaggerated breaths, breathing in through your nose and out 
through your mouth while silently repeating the word relax each time 
you exhale.
 
2. Identify a short list of valued life goals — for example, being closer to 
your family, becoming a more spiritual person, reconnecting with old 
friends.
 
 Goals give you a sense of direction in terms of the changes you want 
to make. Basically, you’re deciding what you want your life to stand for 
from this point on.
 
3. Decide what the incentives are for you to reach these goals.
 
 What’s the end game? Will you have greater peace of mind? Will you be 
happier? Will you live longer? Will you feel less alone with your suffer-
ing? Will you have a new lease on life? Be specific.
 
4. Ask yourself how committed you are to achieving each goal.
 
 The more committed you are — the more successful you’ll be.
 
5. Ask yourself how confident you are about making these changes.
 
 Commitment and confidence are not the same. You can be committed, 
but not all that confident — or, the other way around.
 
6. Consider what specific things you would need to realize each goal.
 
 Where would you start? How much support do you need? If you have sev-
eral goals, which one do you begin with? Make it easy on yourself — start 
with the smallest, easiest thing and work your way up to the big changes.
 
7. Identify any obstacles to meet your objectives.
 
 Do you have physical limitations that might interfere? Is depression a 
problem? Are other people’s attitudes holding you back?
 
8. Decide how you’re going to overcome those obstacles.
 
 For example, get professional help for your depression.
 
9. Begin — just start.
 
 It doesn’t matter what you do; the important thing is that you just do 
something.
 
 Change takes effort so you have to persist, even when the going gets 
tough. There’s no easy way to accomplish change.
 
 Change also takes time, so be patient. As the saying goes, “Rome wasn’t 
built in a day.” And neither is a reconstructed life. Focus on the destina-
tion, but enjoy the journey.
 
10. Reward yourself for whatever changes you make no matter how small.
 
 If change is rewarding, you keep at it — if it isn’t, you quit. It’s just that 
simple!

My own benefit-finding
Try as I might, I haven’t been able to find any 
way of reconciling or making sense out of my 
nephew’s death from leukemia. Allen was a 
great kid. He was easy-going, intelligent, and 
a good-natured soul. He never gave his parents 
a minute of worry, he was well-mannered, and 
I never saw him angry. Everybody loved him — 
for good reason. And then, one day shortly after 
he turned 13, he was diagnosed with cancer.
For three years, his doctors kept him alive — 
resurrecting him from death on more than one 
occasion. And, all the while, he remained hope-
ful, cheerful, and optimistic, shaved head and 
all, about his chances for a long and healthy life. 
He died at the young age of 16, and his family 
was devastated. To make matters even worse, 
his mother — my sister — died tragically three 
years later at age 42. Her doctors said it was 
because of chronic lung disease, but I think she 
died from a broken heart.
I was numb for a while and then angry, and then 
somewhere along the line I accepted the final-
ity and futility of the whole thing. The tragedy 
made me appreciate how lucky I was to have 
two healthy kids and reminded me that I needed 
to take better care of myself. I made the choice 
to give thanks for my kids and to take care of my 
body, and that was a positive outcome from an 
incredibly tragic series of events.

In This Chapter
 Finding meaning in life

 Surviving life’s difficulties
 Bringing order to chaos
T
he dictionary defines coherence as an experience that is logical, con-
sistent, and easily followed, and one in which the various parts stick 
together to form a whole. Psychologist Aaron Antonovsky defined coherence 
as an orientation — a way of thinking about the world — that leaves you with 
a pervasive and enduring feeling of confidence. Dr. Antonovsky suggested 
that you have a sense of coherence whenever you:
 
 Deal with life in a structured and predictable way.
 
 Have enough resources to meet the demands of everyday life.
 
 See these demands as both challenging and meaningful.
Careers provide some people with a sense of coherence; other people 
depend on marriage, family, or religion. What makes life coherent, in other 
words, varies with the individual.
In his book Unraveling the Mystery of Health: How People Manage Stress and 
Stay Well (Jossey-Bass), Antonovsky argued that coherence is linked to well-
being, one component of which is happiness. This is true, he says, even in the 
most adverse of life circumstances — for example, in a concentration camp. 
(Antonovosky studied how people survived in concentration camps.)
In this chapter, I show you how to achieve an abiding sense of coherence in 
good times and bad. I also offer strategies for dealing with periodic disrup-
tions in coherence and a way for you to assess how weak or strong your 
sense of coherence is at this very moment.

126
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Coherence = Confidence
A sense of coherence leaves you feeling confident about the life you’re living. 
That confidence comes from your ability to view the happenings in your life 
as comprehensible (that is, they make sense), manageable (you’re up to the 
task), and meaningful (they’re worthy of your time and effort).
James and Larry were both recently diagnosed as having chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). James took the news well. The diagnosis was no 
surprise to him, because he had been dealing with lung problems since he 
was a child — in fact, he had part of a lung removed when he was only 16. 
James understands that his COPD is the result of a disease, which tends to 
run in his family, and not because he was a smoker or worked in an environ-
ment laden with asbestos. He understands why (comprehensibility) he is ill, 
but then again illness has always been an integral part of his life.
He also believes he can manage his COPD (manageability) in a way that will 
provide him with quality of life for some years to come – again, he’s been 
managing his health for years. He was pleased when his doctor referred him 
to pulmonary rehab, and he’s optimistic that the twice daily inhalant therapy 
will improve his lung capacity (hence, the treatment is meaningful). He’s 
working hard gaining back the weight he lost over the past year — weight 
loss is common in patients with COPD.
James is living a successful, meaningful life and he’s not about to let that be 
cut short if he can help it. On his last check-up, his physician remarked, “You 
have an incredibly positive attitude about all this. You’re really an exceptional 
patient!”
Dif ferent strokes for dif ferent folks
A friend of mine for 40 years centers his whole 
life, year after year, around three things:
  Playing golf
  Religiously attending football and basket-
ball games at his alma mater, the University 
of North Carolina
  Going to Hawaii
As far as I can tell, he does these three things 
regardless of what else is going on in his life 
and, for that matter, whether he can afford to 
do so. What may not make sense financially, it 
turns out, makes a lot of sense psychologically. 
As long as he can look forward to these three 
things, life is good.
I, on the other hand, am confident, happy, and 
sane as long as I can write books, educate 
people, travel to different places, and have my 
life-long companion, Catherine, beside me at all 
times. My friend has his way, and I have mine. 
It’s up to you to figure out what makes your life 
coherent.

127
 Chapter 10: Living a Coherent Lifestyle
Larry, on the other hand, did not take the news well. It’s been months and 
he still hasn’t told his family or friends that he’s sick — a fact that he plans 
to keep secret as long as he can. It makes no sense to Larry that he has 
COPD – it’s incomprehensible. Sure, he’s been a smoker all his life, but he 
quit a couple of years ago and, besides, he’s always been healthy and robust. 
He’s been a successful businessman, an active husband and father, and he’s 
enjoyed physical recreation — skiing, tennis, cycling — for as long as he can 
remember. The idea that his lungs won’t continue to support such activity 
in the years ahead leaves him bewildered and depressed. Larry has entered 
a brave new world and he hasn’t got his footing yet. He doesn’t see how he 
can manage to do what it takes to remain in relatively good health – he hasn’t 
developed any skills over the years that will come in handy now.
When asked about pulmonary rehab, Larry said, “I can’t take time for that and 
run my business at the same time.” In other words, Larry is not up to the task 
(manageability) and does not consider rehab literally worth his time (meaning-
fulness). Although Larry has lived a meaningful life, the prospects of declining 
health and a curtailment of his normal, pre-COPD lifestyle leave him question-
ing whether he wants to fight the good fight or just give up. Larry isn’t too con-
fident about his future in terms of health, finances, or just plain old happiness.
The difference in these two men isn’t their illness — it has to do with their 
sense of coherence. That, more than anything, will determine the future 
course of their health and well-being. For James, COPD is just the latest 
challenge in his life-long effort to deal with chronic illness – for Larry, it’s 
an entirely new ballgame, one in which he’s forced to play for the first time. 
Most likely, he’ll eventually get the hang of it, but it’ll take some time and 
some assistance along the way.
 
Put yourself in their shoes: Your doctor has just delivered some bad news — 
you have breast cancer, a chronic and incurable pain disorder, or diabetes. 
How will you react? Will you handle it pretty well (like James) or be devas-
tated (like Larry)? Which of the three components of coherence — compre-
hensibility, manageability, or meaningfulness — would you have the most 
trouble with? When you look down the road, past the initial diagnosis, do you 
see yourself ever being happy again? Or is that part of your emotional life 
over? Think about these questions before you get a difficult diagnosis, and 
you’ll be better prepared to handle bad news of any kind when it arrives.
Coherence Isn’t One Thing, It’s Many
For most people, finding one thing in life that gives them the sense of confi-
dence they need to continue embracing life with all its twists and turns is easy. 
Some people discover early on how valuable education is, and they spend their 
entire lives continuing to learn everything they can about the world around 
them. For others, making money or going to work is the most important thing.

128
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
But there’s a problem with having only one source of coherence in your life: 
What if something comes along that takes that one thing away? What hap-
pens to your confidence then?
 
The trick is to diversify — to have multiple sources of coherence in your life at 
all times — and to always be looking ahead to retool your sense of coherence 
to fit the particular demands of whatever stage of life you find yourself in.
Diversifying your life
Stock brokers have one word for their clients — diversify, diversify, diversify! 
It’s the mantra of any successful investor and it should be the mantra for all 
of us when it comes to developing a sense of coherence.
What you need is a network of people and things in your life that collectively 
create a sense of confidence and satisfaction. The dictionary definition of 
coherence refers to various parts that stick together to form a whole. So, what 
are some of those possible parts? Consider the following:
 
 Engaging in intellectual pursuits, such as reading The Wall Street Journal 
every day or taking courses at your local community college
 
 Spending time with family
 
 Developing long-term friendships
 
 Building a career (as opposed to having a series of jobs)
 
 Fostering a spiritual faith
 
 Attending religious services
 
 Participating in civic organizations
 
 Volunteering
 
 Doing hobbies
 
 Caring for pets
 
 Working as a missionary
 
 Doing routine recreational activities such as golfing every Saturday 
morning with your friends
 
 Joining a book club
 
 Getting involved with your alumni association, such as tailgating at foot-
ball games or doing fund-raising for your alma mater
 
 Participating in community government
 
 Working on your marriage

129
 Chapter 10: Living a Coherent Lifestyle
 
 Participating in a prayer group
 
 Getting regular exercise — jogging, walking, cycling, swimming, aerobics
 
 Meditating
 
 Attending AA meetings or other support groups
 
Review this list and count the number of these activities that make up your 
day-to-day life. A healthy recipe for coherence would include at least five such 
activities carried out on a weekly basis.
 
The more of these, or similar, activities you engage in on a consistent basis, 
the stronger your sense of coherence.
Understanding how coherence 
changes with age
Erik Erikson, one of the world’s most well-known psychologists, talked about 
how each of the various stages of life — childhood, adolescence, adulthood — 
is made up of different personal and interpersonal agendas. For example, as 
children grow up, they first learn to trust the world around them, then exercise 
free will, make choices and become interested in different things, and finally 
develop an appetite for learning everything they can about the world around 
them. Adolescence is all about forming an identity — how you’re different 
from others — and seeking independence. Young adults are all trying to build 
a social and economic life and deal with lots of “firsts” — first marriage, first 
job, first mortgage, first car. Middle-age adults are consolidating their gains — 
things they achieved as young adults — and working hard to maintain families, 
careers, and their health. And, the elderly spend a lot of time reflecting back on 
life and deciding whether their lives were meaningful.
Meditation, stress, and health
Studies have repeatedly shown that people 
who practice meditation exercises on a regular 
basis enjoy better health over a lifetime, manage 
stress better, and live longer. In one study of 
154 New York Telephone Company employ-
ees, those who practiced mediation routinely 
over a period of 51⁄2 months showed significant 
decreases in depression, anxiety, hostility, and 
paranoia when compared to those who were 
non-practitioners. It was also suggested that 
meditation led to better coping, improved effi-
ciency at work, and greater satisfaction with 
life. Not a bad deal for something that can take 
as few as two or three minutes of your time!

Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Coherence — understanding life, managing life well, and feeling as if your life 
has value — changes as people age. To understand coherence in children, 
you have to be able to see the world through a child’s eyes. Parents are a 
child’s major, if not exclusive, source of coherence. Teenagers, on the other 
hand, make sense of the crazy, emotional world in which they live primarily 
through peer relationships and this, unfortunately, drives some parents nuts. 
Young adults rely on other young adults for coherence. And, somewhere 
in middle age, we begin to be the source of our own coherence. That’s the 
beauty of growing old!
The specific pursuits and activities that we rely on for a feeling of coherence 
at each of these life stages (see the preceding section) vary considerably and 
tend to be age-appropriate. It’s safe to say that few children belong to alumni 
associations or book clubs, but their parents can certainly enroll them in 
Sunday school classes and make sure they are a fully participating member 
of the family unit. Coherence is not a static experience, but rather something 
that changes and evolves over time. 
What to Do When Coherence Is Disrupted
Most of us have a plan for how we want to live our lives and we spend the 
majority of our time executing that plan. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, life 
cooperates with your plan, but not always. And, your sense of coherence — 
which is a by-product of that plan — is either temporarily or permanently 
disrupted. Common disruptions include such things as:
 
 The death of a loved one
 
 The loss of a job
 
 Divorce
 
 Life-changing accidents or illness
 
 Bankruptcy
 
 War
 
 Severe economic losses
 
 Natural disasters — floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires
 
 Identity theft
 
 Winning the lottery
 
 Imprisonment
 
 Outsourcing of jobs overseas

131
 Chapter 10: Living a Coherent Lifestyle
 
 The death of an industry — coal mining, steel mills, farming
 
 Having a special-needs child
 
 Being forced into early retirement
Life suddenly gets off track and the confidence that was so much a part of 
your life is shaken. During those times, you’re anything but happy. So how do 
you get back on track and regain your confidence? In the following sections, I 
show you.
Have a heart-to-heart with a higher power
The peace and tranquility that comes from a belief in a power greater than 
oneself is an antidote to unhappiness and the doubt and uncertainty that 
accompanies unexpected, unwanted changes in life. The nature of that higher 
power is not as important as the meaningful social tie (see Chapter 16) you 
have to that entity.
Duncan was a successful and happy man until he had a nervous breakdown. 
Suddenly, overnight, he was reduced to a shell of a man — unsure about his 
own self-worth and viability as a husband, provider, parent, and friend. He 
found himself on an emotional roller coaster, elated one minute and in utter 
despair the next. Duncan had lost confidence in everyone and everything 
around him, as well as himself, and there was no one else to turn to for hope 
but God. Duncan was in an emotional freefall and God was his safety net. So, 
he began a dialogue — prayer — with his higher power. God became the life-
line that helped Duncan maintain some sense of coherence in an otherwise 
chaotic world.
In order for prayer to work, you need to be honest in your conversation with 
your higher power. This is not the time to hold back. Admit your fears, your 
anger, your feeling of vulnerability, and ask for help. Recognize that you’re 
a human being — no more, no less — and not some invincible, superpower 
who can handle everything that life throws at you. This is what humility is all 
about.
 
Prayer is an act of faith and faith can be a weapon that helps you survive 
unhappy times. Take a few minutes each day and have a quiet conversation 
with a higher power. The nature of the prayer doesn’t matter. It can be a 
prayer of uncertainty (“Lord, I’ve lost my sense of direction and don’t know 
where to go from here”), a prayer of solicitation (“God, please grant me the 
courage to see this through”), or a prayer of desperation (“God, I feel so lost 
and alone”). The simple act of having faith is what’s empowering.

132
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Set aside the unanswerable 
questions of life
You are, by definition, rational, logical, and thoughtful. Why? Because you’re 
human, and humans are the only animal on the planet that have the immense 
brain capacity to interact with the world around them in a questioning manner. 
Other animals lack the ability to question life; they simply act on instinct.
But the human need to ask questions and have them answered to our satis-
faction can also be a problem. Not all questions in life have an answer, and 
that can leave people at a loss.
When my 16-year-old nephew died of leukemia, I sat in the church watching my 
poor sister and her family devastated by grief thinking, “This is stupid! It makes 
absolutely no sense. He was a great kid. What was God thinking anyway?” I 
wanted answers — something to satisfy the anger and confusion I felt at that 
moment — and was hopeful that the minister would provide those answers. 
And then a truly miraculous thing happened. The minister said, “I’m not going 
to stand here and try to explain why this wonderful young man’s life was cut 
short because I don’t know myself. What I’m going to tell you is that some 
things in life just don’t make sense and never will, in this life at least — and, 
that’s just something that you and I are going to have to live with. So, instead of 
sitting there asking the unanswerable questions, ‘Why this boy? Why this dis-
ease? Why now?’, I suggest we all set those questions aside and pray a prayer 
of gratitude for having had this young man in our lives for these few years and 
for all the ways he touched us all.” I found that very comforting.
 
What unanswerable questions are you struggling with? If you’ve asked ques-
tions for which you still haven’t gotten a satisfactory answer, maybe it’s time 
to set them aside. By the way, I think you’ll find that you rarely, if ever, seek 
answers to questions that have to do with things that are going right in your 
life — Why am I so good looking? Why am I more successful than most other 
people my age? What did I do to deserve this wonderful woman I’ve been mar-
ried to for over a quarter of a century? The unanswerable questions only come 
when our lives get off track.
Hardiness and prayer
Studies show a link between participation in 
religious services and hardiness (see Chapter 
6). Hardiness involves a sense of internal con-
trol, an active commitment to life, and the ability 
to view adversity as a challenge rather than a 
catastrophe. This is akin to what most religions 
teach when it comes to issues of faith, com-
mitment, and responsibility for one’s actions. 
Whether prayer leads to a hardy attitude or vice 
versa, the two seem inextricably connected.

133
 Chapter 10: Living a Coherent Lifestyle
Know how to begin and end each day
Coherence comes from structure and when that structure — those routine, 
meaningful activities that make you feel like you’re on top of life — is 
disturbed, you must slowly but surely replace that structure, not always 
an easy task.
It takes time to rebuild a life after the loss of a spouse to whom you’ve been 
happily married for decades. Finding another job that will provide you with 
as much satisfaction as the one you just lost can take a lot of effort. And read-
justing to civilian life after serving an extended tour of active combat during 
a war can be difficult. Daily routines that felt all too natural are now a thing of 
the past.
New routines are best developed by concentrating on the beginning and end 
of each day. Let the middle of the day take care of itself. Focus on tasks that 
meet the three M’s test — that is, something that makes sense, is manageable 
(within your power to do), and is meaningful. And keep it simple!
Here are some ways you may want to start and end your day:
 
 Spending a few minutes in quiet prayer
 
 Doing 20 minutes of light exercise
 
 Taking your dog for a walk
 
 Having breakfast at a restaurant where you’re considered a regular
 
 Sending e-mails to close friends and wishing them a pleasant day
 
 Spending 15 minutes in meditation
 
 Feeding the birds in your yard
 
 Having a neighbor over for coffee
 
 Having a conversation with someone who cares about you
Start and end your day the same way every day. These routines can be the 
building blocks for a renewed sense of coherence.
Count your opportunities and blessings
In an effort to achieve a more positive, confident mindset as you go through 
the day, be aware of all the opportunities life offers you as well as the bless-
ings that come your way.
I once heard a Baptist preacher say, “Folks, there are two kinds of people in 
this world. The first kind gets up in the morning, gets out of bed, walks across 
the floor, looks out the window and says ‘Good morning, God.’ The second 

134
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
kind gets up in the morning, gets out of bed, walks across the floor, looks out 
the window, and says ‘Good God, morning.’” Same three words, only with 
entirely different meanings. The first welcomes the opportunities and prom-
ises offered by each new day, whereas the latter can only see the problems 
of the past. If you think about it, just having another day to make something 
meaningful of your life is, in itself, a blessing.
 
Begin and end each day reminding yourself of at least ten ways in which your 
life has been blessed. Do you feel blessed with good health? Are you blessed 
by having people in your life who love and care for you? Are you blessed with 
certain talents and skills that not everyone else has? Are you blessed with 
children who are good citizens and are succeeding at life? Everyone has some-
thing in his life he can be thankful for.
 
Opportunities don’t always coming knocking on your door — sometimes you 
have to create them. Ask yourself what you can do today to create some new 
opportunity in your life.
Making Sense of Life: 
The Core Components
There are three core components to a coherent life, without which it’s dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to achieve happiness. These components are order, 
affiliation, and meaning. Each of these components is important in its own 
right, but it’s the combination of the three that determines where you fall on 
the continuum of coherence. I cover these core components in the following 
sections.
Order
Imagine living in a land where there were no rules, no laws, no customs, no 
rituals, no agreed-upon ways of relating to other people, no responsibilities, 
no expectations, and no consequences for your actions. That would be the 
land of chaos! Now, imagine how unhappy you would be.
To be happy, there has to be some rhyme or reason to everyday life, which 
means order. Order not only tells you how to behave and what to expect 
today, it tells you what tomorrow will be like.

135
 Chapter 10: Living a Coherent Lifestyle
The concept of civilization implies a sense of order. Some cultures operate 
under the so-called rule of law, which means that citizens learn to behave in 
certain prescribed ways that have legal consequences. Other cultures operate 
under the rule of force, which means the citizens live seemingly ordered lives 
out of fear. In either case, removing those rules inevitably leads to chaos.
How ordered is your life? Are you clear about what your world expects from 
you today? Can you tell what you’ll be doing tomorrow? Do you have a plan 
for today that you’ll follow no matter what? How many times during the 
course of your day do you answer specific questions by saying “I’m not sure,” 
“We’ll see,” or “It depends”? Is every day of your life a mystery?
If your life is more chaos than order, set down some rules you can live by 
(Do onto others as you would have them do unto you), be clear what it is you 
expect from yourself today and tomorrow (I’m attending community college 
or I have a job to go to), and don’t just be satisfied with living “one day at a 
time” – that sounds good, but it’s not too practical.
Affiliation
Humans are happiest when they are attached to and connected with the lives 
of others. (The opposite — to be detached or disconnected —is to be alien-
ated.) Affiliation is a positive thing; alienation is negative. Much of your sense 
of coherence comes from being a member of a family, a social or civic orga-
nization, a workforce, a political party, a religious community, and the like. It 
gives you a feeling of belonging and shared identity.
Affiliation is a vital part of the definition of who you are and what your life 
stands for. When someone meets you for the first time and asks, “I don’t 
believe we’ve met. I’m _____. And who are you?”, you answer by saying, “I’m 
_____. I just moved here from _____. I work at _____,” or, “I’m _____, the host’s 
brother-in-law,” or “Nice to meet you. I’m _____. I just moved in next door.”
If I asked you “Who are you?”, what would you say? If you’re not sure, it’s 
time you started filling in the blanks. Align yourself with some group at work, 
for example, they guys who play golf on Saturday or the bowling team. Join 
a volunteer organization where you can feel a part of a group effort — for 
example, Habitat for Humanity. Make a concerted effort to reconnect with 
your family of origin — most likely, they’ll welcome you back with open arms. 
Organize a small group to eat together every Friday night — something you 
(and they) can look forward to. The possibilities are endless.
In Chapter 16, I explain the difference between being alone and being lonely. 
Affiliation is about never being lonely, even if you’re alone.

Meaning
Viktor Frankl’s wonderful book Man’s Search for Meaning (Washington Square 
Press) makes a cogent argument for how a person can only achieve happi-
ness through a life with purpose. That sense of purpose, he suggests, can 
come from one of three sources:
 
 Some type of creative or constructive work or deed
 
 Intimate, loving relationships
 
 Rising above some tragic life circumstance (in Frankl’s case, the horrors 
of life in a German concentration camp)
A life that includes none of these three elements is, according to Frankl, 
empty and meaningless. And it is a life rife with unhappiness in the form of 
depression, violence, and addiction.
How have you managed to find meaning in your life? Today is a good day 
to start creating your meaning in life. Here’s how: Find an activity where 
you can forget about yourself and focus more on the needs of others — for 
example, becoming involved in the Big Brother/Big Sister program and doing 
what you can to enhance the life of a child. Find an activity that has more to 
do with your character — compassionate, entertaining — than your profes-
sion or career — psychologist, electrician. Think of someone you admire and 
start doing some of those things they do. Look around for things that every-
one agrees should be done, but no one wants to do — and, you be the one to 
do them. All of us look at the trash littering our highways and think “I wish 
somebody would pick that stuff up.” Why don’t you be that somebody and 
make the rest of us happy?

ou’re probably saying to yourself, “I thought confession was about con-
fiding in someone the things that I’ve done wrong — my transgressions, 
my sins, my shortcomings.” Traditionally, confession has been about con-
fessing the bad stuff, but there’s no law that says you can’t confess the good 
stuff, too.
I’m not suggesting that you get in line at your local church and confess to a 
priest — although some people find the Catholic confession a vital part of 
their lives. What I’m suggesting is that you use a technique called emotional 
journaling, in which you spend time every day focusing on and writing about 
all your positive thoughts, feelings, and events. Journaling about the good 
stuff can lead to increased happiness.
No penance required
In the Catholic faith, when you go to confession, 
you invariably end up performing some sort of 
penance — for example, praying the rosary five 
times, doing the stations of the cross, or recit-
ing “Forgive me Father for I have sinned” over 
and over. The penance is the price you pay for 
sinning.
But in the case of positive confessions, there is 
no sin. So, there’s no need for penance. Instead 
of being told “Go forth and sin no more,” what 
you need to tell yourself is “Good for you! You 
deserve it! Keep it up!” Forget penance — 
reward yourself for having the good sense to 
do what it takes to achieve true happiness. And 
that will add another layer of joy to what you 
already have!

Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Aaron spent most of his life asking God for things. He prayed that he would 
get the job he applied for. He prayed that nothing bad would happen to his 
two lovely children. He prayed for promotions, prayed that he and his wife 
would get along better, and prayed that he’d remain healthy.
Asking for what he wanted was the nature of Aaron’s relationship with his 
higher power. But that began to change, not all at once but gradually. Instead 
of asking God to give him things, he began thanking God for all the many 
blessings that had already come his way. He switched from a prayer of sup-
plication to one of gratitude. He started and ended each day by spending a 
few quiet minutes reviewing all the things he had to be thankful for — not 
only that day but all the days of his life. He thanked God for his happy mar-
riage, for his healthy children, for his parents, and for his friends. He thanked 
God for his intellectual ability, his ability to make a good living, and all the 
success he had enjoyed in his career. But most of all, he thanked God for the 
opportunities that came his way — things that he hadn’t engineered, didn’t 
expect, and was pleasantly surprised by, things he attributed to that force 
greater than himself.
When Aaron asked for things in his prayers, it meant that he felt empty, that 
something was missing. But when he started routinely thanking God for what 
he already had, it left Aaron with a full feeling, a feeling of satiation, which is 
one of the primary ingredients to achieving happiness (see Chapter 2).
On the other end of a confession
Recently, I met a wonderful young woman I 
know at the restaurant where I always eat 
breakfast. We were both leaving at the same 
time and we spent a few minutes in the park-
ing lot, where she told me about all the good 
things that were happening in her life, including 
being accepted into graduate school in a new 
and exciting field. The more she confessed how 
good her life was, the happier I felt. The next 
thing I knew, I was recounting all the things I 
have to be grateful for in my own life. We were 
feeding off each other in a very positive, natu-
ral, and spontaneous way.
The next time someone shares some bad news 
with you, listen for a while and be supportive 
— but then share some good news about your 
own life. You may worry that your good news 
will make the other person feel worse, know-
ing that you’re happy while they aren’t, but 
trust me, it won’t. What your good news will 
do is give that person a sense of hope — hope 
that maybe, just maybe, one day soon she’ll also 
have some good news to share with you. Think 
of your good-news confession as a lifeline to 
someone who’s swimming in troubled waters.

139
 Chapter 11: Making a Daily Confession
 
Everybody wants things — more time with the people they love, more money, 
more clothes, more vacation time, a better car, a better house. But the key is 
to shift your focus from what you don’t have to what you do. You don’t have 
to be religious or even believe in God to be thankful for what you have. The 
key is just to be thankful, period.
Confessing the Good Stuff: Thoughts, 
Feelings, and Actions
Psychology in general concerns itself with how and what human beings think, 
how they feel, and how and why they behave the way they do. Positive 
psychology does the same thing — only it focuses on positive thoughts, 
positive emotions, and positive ways of acting toward others. In making your 
daily confession — it needs to be daily to get the real benefit — you need to 
pay attention to the good stuff. Think about what went right rather than what 
went wrong. Look at that part of the glass that’s half full, rather than the half 
that’s empty.
Get in touch with positive feelings — love, compassion, gratitude — not feel-
ings like anger, dissatisfaction, and despair. Ask yourself, “What have I done 
today that’s positive, that made someone else’s life easier or better, or that 
made me a healthier and happier person?”
 
By simply paying more attention to the positive things you say and do each 
day, you’ll become a much more positive person — and, thus, happier.  
Positive thoughts
Over the years, a lot has been written and said about the power of positive 
thinking. All of it is based on the premise that what’s in your head — posi-
tive thoughts — inevitably influence what’s in your heart as well as how you 
behave. The golfer who stands on the tee and thinks to himself “What a beau-
tiful hole — I’m going to put this sucker (meaning the ball) right out there in 
the middle of the fairway” most likely will be happier with his shot that his 
friend who’s standing next to him thinking “Oh God, I hope I don’t hit it into 
the trees on the left.” I know because I used to be like his friend and that’s 
why I eventually gave up golf.

Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Here are some examples of the kind of positive thoughts that can lead to 
happiness:
 
 What a lovely day this is.
 
 There really are nice people in the world — like the driver who let me 
pull in front of him so that I could turn at the light.
 
 My partner is such a thoughtful person.
 
 I’m not rich, but I’m thankful that I have enough to pay my bills.
 
 I’m a very healthy person for my age.
 
 I’d rather have my friends than a million bucks!
 
 I am so much better off than a lot of people I see every day.
 
 I love the smile on that woman’s face at the checkout counter.
 
 I love it when I hear the birds start to sing — it means spring is on the 
way.
 
 That massage felt wonderful!
 
 It’s always great to hear from my kids — even when they have 
a  problem.
 
 I’m glad I found that nail in my tire before it went completely flat!
 
 If I could live my life all over again, I wouldn’t change a thing.
I must confess . . .
If you want to have a happy relationship 
(Chapter 20), be happy in your work (Chapter 
18), and have a happy family (Chapter 19), you 
have to let the people closest to you know 
how much happiness they bring to your life. 
Happiness should never be taken for granted 
— it needs to be shared.
A husband needs to tell his wife regularly — not 
just on Valentine’s Day — how happy he is that 
she’s his partner in life. How hard can it be to 
tell her, “At least once a day, I realize just how 
lucky I am that you married me”?
Parents need to tell their children how much 
they enjoy them despite the growing pains that 
inevitably come from raising kids. How difficult 
is it to say, “You’re one of the best things that 
ever happened to me”?
And, it never hurts to tell your employer how 
much you enjoy working there. Most people 
find it much easier to talk about what they don’t 
like about their jobs than what they do like. I 
know when I was in the business of managing a 
group of psychologists, I didn’t mind their criti-
cism nearly as much if they also confided in me 
what they liked about how things were run.
Starting today, make a point of telling someone 
you know “I must confess how much happi-

 Chapter 11: Making a Daily Confession
Take a piece of paper and write down 15 positive thoughts that would help 
me understand what’s in your half-full glass. If this exercise seems difficult 
and you have a hard time coming up with 15 happy thoughts, you’re prob-
ably spending too much time focusing on the negative. Don’t worry — if you 
keep up this exercise regularly, eventually you’ll be able to come up with 15 
positives.
 
Carry a notebook with you and write down every positive thought you have in 
a given day. Sometimes at the end of a long day it’s hard to remember all the 
positives you experienced, but if you write them down throughout the day, 
you’ll be able to reread your list before you go to bed and remind yourself that 
the day was actually pretty good.
Positive feelings
Happiness is not just about feeling joyful. It comes from other positive 
feelings that you and I experience in the course of everyday life as well. In 
essence, one good feeling leads to another. If you have enough of these other 
positive emotions, you can’t help but be happy.
What positive feelings have you experienced lately? Here are some examples:
 
 Awed
 
 Content
 
 Comfortable
 
 Compassionate
 
 Connected (as opposed to lonely)
 
 Generous
 
 Grateful
 
 Excited
 
 Humble
 
 Optimistic
 
 Relieved
 
 Righteous (for example, for having done a good deed)
 
 Satisfied
 
 Serene
 
 Upbeat

142
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
Use this list as a starting point, and write down any positive feelings you’ve 
had in the past 24 hours. If you have trouble identifying very many positive 
feelings, that’s a heads-up that you may be paying too much attention to the 
negative emotions or, in fact, that you simply aren’t feeling anything positive. 
Doing this exercise daily will help you become more aware of positive feel-
ings that are there — just unnoticed. If you aren’t having any positive feelings 
at all, day after day, then you probably need to get some professional help 
in figuring out why not — even mildly depressed people can feel upbeat and 
excited.
 
I didn’t include “happy” in this list, because happiness is really the composite 
of a lot of other positive emotions.
Positive actions
It’s not always what you think and feel that makes you happy as much as it is 
what you actually do in the course of a given day. When you’re making your 
daily confession, try to think of all the positive things you did in the past 
24 hours.
Here are some examples of positive actions:
 
 Held the door open for an elderly person at the post office.
 
 Slammed on the brakes to keep from running over a dog in the road.
 
 Picked up litter along the roadside.
 
 Returned a wallet I found in parking lot to its rightful owner.
 
 Sent a get-well card to an ailing friend.
 
 Took my dogs for a walk.
 
 Did the dishes so that my partner wouldn’t have to do them after work.
 
 Took a day off from work to sit with a friend who was undergoing 
chemotherapy.
 
 Said “thank you” to everyone who helped me throughout the day.
 
 Took time to go to the gym to exercise.
 
 Stopped to talk to a neighbor I knew was having a hard time with 
depression.
 
 Treated a friend to lunch.
 
 Went to bed early and got a good night’s sleep for a change.
 
 Smiled at everyone I came into contact with.
 
 Bought my partner some flowers.

143
 Chapter 11: Making a Daily Confession
Try to come up with 10 examples of positive actions you took that made you 
feel good in the past 24 hours. If you can’t come up with 10 things you did in 
the past 24 hours, make a list of 15 things you’ll do in the next 24 hours, and 
carry the list with you so you can make sure to do them. Eventually, these 
positive actions will become a part of your routine, and you won’t have to 
think about them consciously in order to incorporate them in your life.
 
Positive confessions need to start with the words: I thought, I felt, and I did.
Putting It Down on Paper
If you take just 15 or 20 minutes a day and write down everything positive 
you can think of that happened during the day, you’ll see on a daily basis 
how much you have to be thankful for. This journal is for your eyes only, to 
remind you of what you have to be thankful for or happy about.
 
Don’t think of this as a diary — you’re not going to keep it after you’re done. 
Here are some things to keep in mind as you write your happiness journal:
Confidant = confident
If you have a special person in your life, some-
one you can reveal anything to — good or 
bad — then you know what a confidant is. A 
confidant is someone with whom you have an 
intimate, one-on-one relationship that goes 
well beyond that of an acquaintance or even 
what most people think of when they use the 
word friend. Having a confidant means having 
someone to whom you can confess your true 
self — your feelings, thoughts, ambitions — 
without risking judgment or some form of social 
censure. It’s the most trusting relationship that 
humans have.
Remember: Having a confidant is healthy. Heart 
patients who could identify a confidant lived 
three times longer than those who could not. 
And if you’re a pregnant mother, having a con-
fidant increases the odds that your fetus will be 
born healthy by three times.
Be sure to share the good news with your con-
fidant, too. Sharing news about how well things 
are going in your life builds self-confidence. 
After all, you’re listening to yourself as you talk 
to that other person and you’re being reminded 
that things are going well. Your positive con-
fessions end up enhancing your own sense of 
self-esteem.

144
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
 
 Make yourself the audience. You’re writing this to yourself. It’s a 
private conversation — you’re not trying to impress anyone or to make 
someone else feel better. Fill the pages with self-references — words 
like I and me. Writing in the first person makes it a personal conversa-
tion between you and yourself, as opposed to a conversation between 
you and someone else. It also makes you responsible for the positive 
thoughts, emotions, and actions you write about.
 
 Forget the grammar. This is one writing exercise where grammar 
doesn’t matter. You don’t have to be an English major to confess how 
good you feel at the end of the day. Just write from the heart. Write 
without thinking too much — let your writing be spontaneous. No one is 
going to grade you, so you can forget the rules.
 
 Write until time’s up. Give yourself the full 15 to 20 minutes to complete 
this exercise. Don’t be in a hurry to make your confession. Enjoy it! The 
exercise itself should make you feel better, so make it last. If it helps, set 
a kitchen timer and write until you hear the bell — and, then just stop 
even if you’re in the middle of a sentence.
Confessing with a card
During the five years I was depressed, I 
received greeting cards from a man I affection-
ately think of as Uncle Bert — he’s slightly older 
than I am in years and centuries older than I 
am in wisdom, and he’s been a mentor through-
out my career. The cards always seemed to 
arrive at one of my low points — moments of 
true despair — and they had the desired heal-
ing effect that Bert constantly referred to in his 
handwritten notes.
The cards were joyous looking, brightly colored, 
and full of hope. What Bert wrote inside each 
card also brought joy to my suffering heart. Not 
only did he confess his concern for my well-
being and his appreciation for our friendship, 
he also shared his appreciation of the support 
I had offered him in the past. He consistently 
reminded me of what he called my “unique con-
tributions” not just to the profession of psychol-
ogy, but to the world at large. As he put it in one 
card, “You are realizing the poet/poem within.”
You can imagine how this cheered my sagging 
spirit and helped me slowly-but-surely recon-
nect with a feeling of happiness.
Remember: You don’t have to wait until some-
one is ill or there’s some special occasion to 
send someone you care about a greeting card. 
You can make any day you choose the anniver-
sary of your friendship, a celebration of your 
relationship, or simply a reminder — to them 
and to you — of what an important part he 
plays in your life. Why not let the people you 
care about know how you feel today?

145
 Chapter 11: Making a Daily Confession
 
 After you’re done writing, read what you wrote. Circle all the positive 
feelings you wrote about — like happy, excited, and relaxed. Underline 
all of the positive thoughts you wrote down (for example, “I reminded 
myself how fortunate I was to have a college education”). Put a check-
mark next to each positive action you took during the day. Now add up 
all those notations. Paying attention to the positive feelings, thoughts, 
and actions you wrote about will give you a sense of whether you’re 
getting a good balance of all three in your day.
This daily exercise serves as an active reminder of the fact that you’re prob-
ably having a better day than you realize.
Engaging in Group Confessions
When my wife and I get together for dinner with our Friday night friends, we 
don’t sit around and complain about all our problems. Instead, we share all 
the positive things that are going on in our lives. We confess to each other 
the good news, not just the bad. We try to uplift one another (see Chapter 13) 
in order to end the week on a positive note. I announce that “We finally sold 
our office building and now I can retire.” A younger member of our group, 
who has recently started a business of his own, tells us about a new contract 
he’s landed that will earn him a lot of money. His wife, who makes handbags 
for a living, talks about the successful show she had in a nearby city the past 
weekend. Another member of the group updates us on how well her daughter 
is doing in law school and how much she enjoys living in Florida. And so it 
goes. (Don’t get me wrong: If someone has a problem, of course, everyone 
will hear them out and offer support. It’s just that we don’t want Friday night 
to become a group therapy experience.)
 
If you’re not already involved in a regular group meeting with family and 
friends, where the conversation is upbeat and focuses on the good stuff, start 
your own group. The size of the group isn’t important — what matters is the 
character of the people (you want to choose optimists over pessimists) and 
the content of the conversation.
 
If you’re going to gossip about other people, make sure it’s positive gossip. 
Say good things behind their backs! For example, “Did you hear about Sally? 
She got that job she applied for? Isn’t that wonderful. I’m so happy for her.” 
Sally won’t know what you said, but you will.

146

What pain?
I have conducted a bi-weekly men’s pain group 
for several years for male clients who suffer 
from chronic, disabling pain disorders. Many of 
these men have been attending these sessions 
religiously for a long time and it’s been interest-
ing to hear how the essence of what they talk 
about has changed.
In the beginning, the focus of their confessions 
was the horrors of living in constant pain, the 
anger they had toward the medical profession 
for failing to fix them, their struggles with the 
insurance companies, and the strain that all this 
had put on their families. Now, years later, the 
same people spend virtually all their time talking 
about how positive life is despite ongoing pain. 
One talks about having a new home built — a 
dream that he thought he had lost because of 
his disability and loss of employment. Another 
talks about his recent fishing trip to the North 
Carolina coast and how much he enjoys the 
pain relief he gets when he goes fishing. A third 
talks about how pleased he is that his son has a 
good job and is happily married.
These men seldom refer to the word pain and 
they no longer look unhappy. They laugh, smile, 
tell jokes, and enjoy each other’s successes. 
If you ask them why they continue coming to 
these group sessions year after year, they’ll tell 
you it’s because they feel so much better when 
they leave and that good feelings seem to carry 
over into their everyday lives. They’ve long ago 
learned all there is to know about living with 
chronic pain — what they’re learning now is 
how to be a happy pain patient.

Putting On a Happy Face
In This Chapter
 Smiling worldwide
 Smiling for the right reasons
 Projecting a positive image
 Smiling as a means to an end
A
ccording to psychologist Daniel Goleman, author of the popular book 
Emotional Intelligence (Bantam), being able to read other people’s 
emotions is part of what makes human beings smart. And what exactly is it 
that we’re supposed to read? Their faces, of course. There’s the sad face, the 
angry face, the depressed face, the curious face, the hostile face, the kind and 
considerate face, the compassionate face, and the happy face.
How do you know a happy face when you see one? Simple: It has a smile. Not 
just any old smile, but a natural, unforced, authentic smile unlike any other.
In this chapter, I show you how to interpret the meaning and motives behind 
a variety of smiles, point out how empowering a smile can be, and tell you 
how intentionally putting on a happy face can brighten your spirits. I also tell 
you how to get your smile back if you’ve lost it.
Smiling: The Universal Language
Forty years ago, psychologist Paul Ekman, professor emeritus at the 
University of California Medical School in San Francisco, embarked on a 
psychological adventure to discover the origin of human emotions. He began 
his journey in New Guinea, where he quickly discovered that the preliterate 
South Fore people had the same emotions as people in modern, civilized 
cultures throughout the world. Unlike most psychologists, who study how 
people think and feel through spoken language, Ekman relied on people’s 
recognition of facial expressions of different emotions, and he took pictures 
of their faces.

148
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
What he learned by studying the South Fore people as well as countless other 
groups of people around the globe — from Broadway to Borneo — left him 
convinced that six basic emotions are universal among all cultures:
 
 Anger
 
 Contempt
 
 Disgust
 
 Fear
 
 Happiness
 
 Sadness
 
 Surprise
Think of these as the primary colors of your emotional life. All other 
feelings — disgruntled, confused, curious — are spin-off or secondary 
emotions.
The fact that emotions are universal and not bound to any specific culture 
means that they’re built in to the human nervous system. In other words, 
you don’t have to learn to be happy when you’re born — you come into the 
world already equipped to experience happiness. Infants smile and so do the 
elderly and that, in and of itself, is the language of happiness.
From Cradle to Grave
Emotions reflect a person’s temperament. Temperament is an inherited 
style of experiencing and expressing emotion — it controls both the tone 
and direction of your feelings. If you’re an ill-tempered individual, you 
move against the world in an angry, aggressive manner. (For more on this, 
Reading the students’ faces
My favorite part of teaching in college is watch-
ing the faces of students when they take a test. 
Some have looks of sheer terror (“Oh my God! 
Where did these questions come from?”). 
Others have blank expressions, which probably 
mirrors what’s going on in their minds. Far too 
many, unfortunately, have frowns (“I could kick 
myself for not studying for this test!”). And then 
there are the smiling faces, the ones that let me 
know how well-prepared these students are 
and point to how happy they’ll be when they get 
their grades. The looks on my students’ faces 
tell me all I need to know.

149
 Chapter 12: Putting On a Happy Face
check out Anger Management For Dummies [Wiley]). If you have an easy-
going, affable, good-natured temperament, you move toward the world, in a 
positive, cheerful way, with a smile on your face.
Temperament is defined during childhood and is fairly consistent over your 
lifetime. If you were a happy 8-year-old, you can expect to be a relatively 
happy 80-year-old — you’ll be the guy in the nursing home who all the nurses 
love! And if you were a whiney, difficult child, that may well be how you’ll end 
up in old age — unless you decide otherwise and you make a concerted effort 
to change. (Isn’t that one reason you purchased Happiness For Dummies?).
Continuity of temperament occurs for two reasons:
 
 People tend to seek out people whose temperament is just like theirs. 
The kids in my school-based anger management classes, for example, 
are all alike — irritable, fidgety, and ill-tempered. The temperament of 
the boys in my son’s Cub Scout den was quite different — relaxed and 
cooperative.
 
 People with similar temperament reinforce each other’s style of 
emotional behavior. The end result: “I’m happy, you’re happy, we’re all 
happy — or not!”
 
If you aren’t by nature a positive person, make sure you hang around with 
others who are. Let their good-natured ways rub off on you. Emotions can be 
contagious.
 
You don’t choose your temperament, but you can choose your companions.
Caution: Smiling can be contagious
It’s a proven fact that human beings tend 
to mimic each other’s emotional behavior. 
Professor Aron Wolfe Siegman, at the University 
of Maryland–Baltimore County, noted that in 
a two-person exchange one person’s verbal 
expression of anger led to an increase in the 
other person’s anger. This reciprocal “in kind” 
response serves to escalate anger to the point 
where it’s difficult to control. The exact same 
thing happens with sadness.
I love that scene from the movie The Odd Couple 
where Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) is left alone 
with two happy young women and, before you 
know it, everyone ends up in tears. It works the 
same with happiness. Hence the saying, “Smile 
and the whole world smiles with you.” The point 
is that positive emotions are no less contagious 
than negative ones.
Smile at the next ten people you see and pay 
attention to how many smile back at you. Don’t 
say anything, just smile. Then frown at ten 
people in a row and see how many smile at you. 
I bet you’ll notice a difference.

Interpreting the Smiles of Others
A smile can communicate all sorts of things, not just happiness. Behind every 
smile there’s a reason, a motive, some type of nonverbal message. When 
someone smiles at you, you immediately translate that facial expression 
into an idea to which you then respond — for example, “She likes me. She 
approves of what I’m doing. She’s my friend.” Or, you could take it a totally 
different way: “He’s being condescending. He thinks he’s better than me. 
I’ll show him.” The person who’s smiling is the messenger — your job is to 
figure out what the message is.
There are a variety of types of smiles, and I cover them in the following 
sections.
The lying smile
What underlies some people’s smile is a lie. They’re smiling and saying one 
thing, but thinking and feeling just the opposite.
Politicians are often guilty of the lying smile. I love it when a politician smiles 
and says that his adversary is a “good friend, someone I can work with across 
the aisle, and someone I truly respect,” when you and I both know that he 
really wishes his opponent would drop dead.
The stereotypical used-car salesman is often guilty of the lying smile, too. 
With a smile on his face, he says, “This car is a gem. It was owned by a little 
old lady who only drove it to and from her doctor’s office. You don’t have to 
worry about having to put any money into this baby.” Are you convinced?
Many people use lying smiles to be polite and avoid unnecessary conflict, 
particularly with those closest to us. They think it’s better to lie than hurt 
other people’s feelings.
Lying smiles are intentional — the person deliberately smiles to misdirect 
you from the fact that she’s lying. And, unfortunately, for some people, lying 
smiles are also habitual — the person uses them all the time.
The angry smile
Ironically, sometimes a smile tells you that a person’s angry. Their smile is 
actually an attempt to disarm you so that they can catch you off-guard with 
their anger. Angry smiles are most often found in conflict situations — where 
two people disagree or someone has failed to live up to another person’s 
expectations. One of the more obvious situations is in the workplace, where 

151
 Chapter 12: Putting On a Happy Face
an employee has been summoned by his boss for a little one-on-one dialogue. 
Don’t be deceived by the smile on her face as she welcomes you into her 
office and shuts the door — what comes next most likely won’t be pleasant!
An angry smile is often accompanied by hostility and sarcasm — “Well, I’m 
pleased you could find the time in your busy day to wait on our customers. 
After all, they do pay your salary.”  
The masking smile
Judy, a 40-year-old with chronic back pain, sat in my office with her husband. 
As I reviewed my impressions of the initial interview with Judy and the 
various test findings — both of which clearly diagnosed the fact that she 
was severely depressed — she began to smile and laugh at the very idea that 
she was upset about her physical health. The more I talked, the louder she 
laughed — until finally her husband turned to her and said, “Stop it. What are 
you doing? You’re being inappropriate. This man is trying to help you and 
you’re acting like this is all a joke or something.” Judy broke down in tears. 
Her happy façade had been penetrated. Judy suffered from what mental 
health counselors call “masked depression.” And, her condition had now 
been unmasked.
Misdiagnosing myself
My sister died tragically at the age of 42, after 
a long siege of chronic illness. For a year and a 
half before her death, I visited with her almost 
every week, trying to comfort her and give 
her some sense of hope that things would get 
better, even though I knew they wouldn’t.
When she died, I was eerily calm — relieved 
that her suffering was over. I felt no profound 
sense of sadness and, like a good psychologist, 
I told myself that I had no doubt dealt with her 
death by anticipatory grieving (literally griev-
ing in anticipation of a loss). For months, I went 
about business as usual, keeping busy with both 
my practice and my family obligations. I thought 
I was happy — by all accounts, my life was in a 
good place, despite this traumatic loss.
Then Christmas came, and I took a few days off 
to celebrate the end of a “good” year and relax 
a little before the upcoming one. It didn’t take 
long to realize that I had completely misread my 
own emotions. The first morning I had off, after 
my wife and kids left for the day, I found myself 
weeping like a baby “for no apparent reason.” 
I tried everything I could to get a grip on my 
emotions. Finally, I called a psychiatrist friend 
of mine, who quickly assessed that I was in a 
rather fragile state. That, it turned out, was the 
beginning of a bout of severe depression that 
lasted for five years. And, here I thought I was 
so happy.

152
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
The outward appearance of happiness — a smile — often masks negative 
emotions such as fear, sadness, and uncertainty, all of which are either 
suppressed (you’re aware of the feelings but don’t want to openly express 
them)  or repressed (even you are unaware of your true feelings).
The charismatic smile
Some people have a smile that lights up the room. They have a smile that 
attracts others around them much like a flame attracts moths. It’s simply 
irresistible. You can’t turn away from it and you find yourself caught up in 
their emotion.
These people have charisma — the ability to inspire others. Charisma is 
an admirable trait, something everyone would like to have, but few of us 
do. You can usually spot charisma in political leaders — everyone from 
John Kennedy to Winston Churchill had charisma. The prophets of the Old 
Testament were charismatic, as were Jesus and Mohammed. Social reformers 
like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi were charismatic, as was 
Mother Teresa.
We’re hooked by charismatic people the minute they walk into our world. 
Even before they speak, their facial expressions (always a smile, never a 
frown) convey an abiding sense of self-confidence, enthusiasm, personal 
magnetism, positive energy, and spiritedness. Charismatic individuals 
express emotions in such a way that it excites others. Their smile becomes 
your smile; their joy becomes your joy.
If you want to know if you’re charismatic, answer the following questions yes 
or no:
 
 When you laugh, do you laugh with abandonment — loudly and freely?
 
 Are you outgoing around strangers?
 
 Does your facial expression tell it all?
Charisma and heart health
One study showed that charismatic Type 
A’s — those who were more emotionally expres-
sive — were healthier than non-charismatic 
Type A’s. Interestingly, those who smiled more 
had less evidence of peripheral artery disease. 
It was the tight-lipped Type A’s who were most 
at risk. This may, at least in part, explain why 
the vast majority of Type A’s do not have heart 
attacks — they’re protected by their smiles.

153
 Chapter 12: Putting On a Happy Face
 
 Are you comfortable being the center of attention?
 
 Are you a hugger — especially when you like someone?
 
 Do people often tell you they’re “touched” by things you say?
 
 Do you have trouble keeping still when the music starts playing?
 
 Has anyone ever told you that you’d be a good actor?
The more questions you answered yes to, the more charisma you have.
The contemptuous smile
The contemptuous smile is, without doubt, the most destructive type. It 
conveys both anger and, even more important, the message that the person 
on the other end of the smile is worthless and disgusting. It’s the type of 
smile a person uses to put someone else in his place and to remind him just 
how lowly and disrespected he is.
Brandon’s subordinates are all too familiar with the contemptuous 
smile — they see it every day. Brandon is the classic Type A personality. 
He’s impatient, hard-driving, and isn’t satisfied unless things are done 
perfectly. Problem is: Brandon sees himself as superior and everyone else as 
fools. To say that other employees who work with him loathe him would be 
putting it mildly. Brandon doesn’t verbally criticize his fellow workers — it’s 
the look on his face that tells them how he feels.
This is also the type of smile that goes a long way toward destroying 
marriages (see Chapter 20).
The real deal
The Duchenne (pronounced doo-shen) smile tells you when a person is 
really happy. It’s the real deal — natural, unforced, authentic, unrehearsed, 
automatic, involuntary, spontaneous, and always signaling a feeling of joy. 
With this smile, not only do the muscles around the mouth turn upward in 
the shape of a grin but the muscles around the eyes contract as well — your 
eyelids droop and there is a wrinkling around your eyes. These changes 
around the eyes are what distinguish the Duchenne smile from all others.
As early as 6 months of age, infants display the Duchenne smile. Typically, it 
appears when they’re interacting with familiar people — for example, 
parents — and is not seen when they’re in contact with strangers. A mother’s 

154
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
voice or the mere sight of her face will elicit this type of smile, signaling that 
the child feels a sense of pleasure and contentment. Parents smile back, thus 
beginning the process of attachment or emotional bonding that is not only 
crucial for early survival but also serves as a foundation for the development 
of a healthy personality.
 
The next time you see someone smiling, look at her eyes and decide for 
yourself if this is a genuinely happy smile or not. It’s the only true test.
Empowering Yourself: Smiling
Because You Want To
Think about what a smile does for you. It attracts people. It says to the world 
“I’m a happy, confident, competent, satisfied person.” It makes it easier to 
build a support network — people who will rally to your side when adversity 
strikes. It helps you transcend difficult times. It lets others know at a glance 
that you’re optimistic (Chapter 5) and conscientious (Chapter 7). It conveys 
a feeling of power — potency, vitality, and hardiness (Chapter 6).
Deciding what you want others to see
During a sabbatical year in the Netherlands, I 
got to know a medical psychologist who had 
made a life study of the history of medicine in 
Europe. The way he went about it was intrigu-
ing. He found that the earliest hospitals had a 
scene carved in stone in the transom over the 
front door that depicted, in exact detail, what 
you would see if you went inside. By dating 
these stone structures, he could then trace the 
development of hospital life over time.
Your smile does the same thing. It shows others 
what’s going on inside you. If you have an angry 
smile, you’re obviously full of anger, hostility, 
and resentment. A lying smile means you’re 
chock-full of half-truths and outright lies. A con-
temptuous smile means that in your mind, you 
feel superior to everyone else around you — 
you’re important, they’re not. A Duchenne smile 
says to the world, “I’m full of joy!”
Decide how you want others to see you. Do you 
want to be seen as a liar, a contemptuous jerk, 
or someone who is conceited? Or do you want 
to be seen as someone with charisma and who 
is genuinely enjoying life?
The way to eliminate the negative smiles is to 
change what’s going on inside of you. If you’re 
angry, you need to find a way to deal with 
your anger — check out Anger Management 
For Dummies (Wiley). If you’re depressed, try 
Depression For Dummies, by Laura L. Smith, 
PhD, and Charles H. Elliott, PhD (Wiley).

155
 Chapter 12: Putting On a Happy Face
If you portray false smiles — lying smiles, angry smiles, smiles that try to 
hide how miserable you feel — you do so because you have to in order to 
keep dealing with the world in a dishonest way. These types of smiles, in 
effect, disempower you because the world can never know your true self. 
Instead, smile because you want to because of all the positive benefits that 
will come your way.
 
If you have a family, one of the shared benefits of a smile is that it says with-
out words, “We’re in this together,” which is the mantra of a happy family 
(Chapter 19).
Identifying who or what makes you smile
I don’t want to say that most people are clueless when it comes to knowing 
who and what makes them happy, but it is true that people’s understanding 
of the relationship between life circumstances and positive emotion is not as 
precise as it should be.
One simple, easy way to identify your particular sources of happiness is 
to rummage through old photographs and cull out the ones where you’re 
smiling. Some of those will no doubt be pictures of family gatherings where 
everyone is posing for the camera — looking happy for the camera’s sake 
whether you feel that way or not. But other pictures may capture moments of 
genuine happiness, as evidenced by the Duchenne smile on your face.
Examine those photographs carefully and ask yourself what the common 
threads are that connect them. For example, maybe whenever you’re in the 
company of certain people or whenever you’re engaged in some particular 
activity, you’re smiling. What you’re looking for here is a pattern — 
something that repeats itself. (In every picture where I’m with my wife, my 
children, my dogs, or special friends, I have a smile on my face — except for 
those years where I was struggling with depression, and then nothing made 
me smile.)
 
These pictures may come in handy in another way. If you have them 
scattered throughout your home or office, each time you look at them you’ll 
momentarily reconnect with the memory of those happy occasions — and, 
that will bring a smile to your face.
 
When you review your life through personal photographs, you may not 
find many, if any, photographs where you’re smiling — posed or otherwise. 
Over the years, I’ve had more than a few clients come in for therapy when 
they looked at all their friends and saw them happy and enjoying life, and 
realized that they’ve never felt that way. They’re hoping I can tell them why. 

156
Part III: Behaving Your Way toward Happiness 
And, usually I can. To begin with I check to see of any of those roadblocks to 
happiness I list in Chapter 22 are present — for example, are they a vindictive 
type person or do they have a positive history of drug abuse? We explore 
the issue of temperament and talk about whether their parents were happy 
people. And, one-by-one, we address all the other issues covered in this book 
to see where they’re falling short. (To be honest, I’d much rather work with 
a client who’s short on happiness than one that is long on anger — it’s easier 
and more fun!)
Face-making 101: Start with 
a smile and go from there
People are trained to think that emotions lead to actions — in other words, 
the outward expression of those inner feelings. And that’s true. But it’s 
equally true that actions can lead to emotions. An irritated individual who 
starts yelling and flailing about like a wild man will quickly find himself 
experiencing much more intense anger. If he doesn’t want to accelerate to 
the point of rage, he needs to talk in a reasonable tone of voice without all 
the aggressive gestures. Talking about something sad that has happened 
to another person can bring on a spontaneous feeling of sadness within 
yourself. And, believe it or not, you can make yourself happy simply by 
making a happy face.
 
Put a smile on your face and hold it for 20 or 30 seconds and then relax your 
face. Repeat this smiling exercise 10 to 20 times and see if you don’t suddenly 
feel more positive. Better yet, do this exercise in front of a mirror so that 
you can experience what psychologists call facial feedback — that is, your 
emotions begin to conform to your facial features. Assume that somewhere in 
your psyche there is this thing called happiness; the smile you’re putting on 
your face is just a way of letting it out.
 
The smile exercise is no different than any other form of exercise. The more 
you do it, the easier it gets. What begins as contrived eventually becomes 
natural.

157
 Chapter 12: Putting On a Happy Face
Nobody in my family gets angry
A young man in his late 30s came to counseling 
and when I asked him what his problem was, 
he said, “I don’t really know. I just don’t seem to 
feel anything. I have lots of success in my life, a 
pretty girlfriend, a nice car, but nothing excites 
me. I’m just sort of blah!”
Without much to go on, I asked some questions 
about his early childhood and his parents — for 
example, “What were your mom and dad like 
when they got angry?” His answer surprised 
me: “Oh, they never got angry.” Before I could 
ask another question, he said, “They might go 
for days not speaking to one another, some-
times weeks, but I never saw them angry.” In 
other words, his parents were so angry that 
they literally couldn’t speak to one another. He 
had grown up in a house of silence — where 
it turned out no one showed even the slightest 
trace of emotion, positive or negative. He never 
saw his parents openly angry and he never saw 
them happy.
No wonder he didn’t feel anything as he went 
about his day-to-day adult life. No one had 
taught him how to feel, how to be an emotional 
creature. So, that’s what I did. In the begin-
ning, I had to show him a variety of emotional 
faces and ask him to pick out the one(s) that fit 
whatever situation he and I were talking about. 
Each facial expression signified a different type 
feeling. In effect, I was teaching him emotional 
fluency — using words to describe emotions — 
something his parents had failed to do long ago. 
Later on, we began to explore why he felt the 
emotions he did, so that he could begin to relate 
emotional experiences to the people and things 
around him. I taught him not to be judgmental 
about his feelings — there’s no right or wrong 
about happiness or sadness. I taught him how 
to use all this information about himself to navi-
gate his way through life just like his friends. In 
the end, he was anything but blah.

Part IV
Striking the Right 
Balance

In this part . . .
I
 tackle the challenge of finding a happy medium along 
five dimensions of your lifestyle. The overriding mes-
sage in this part is that happiness is never found at the 
extremes of life — it involves a healthy balance, for exam-
ple, between work and play, structure and freedom, or 
selfishness and generosity. The emphasis is on ways to 
behave.
This is not one of those mind-over-matter discussions you 
often find in self-help books — suggesting, for example, 
that you can literally think your way into happiness. You 
can’t! What you can do are things such as generate some 
uplifting experiences to offset the hassles, engineer some 
positive rituals in your daily routine, work toward becom-
ing more Type B, discover how not to be lonely even 
when you find yourself alone, and become less 
codependent.
A cautionary note: If you start doing the things outlined in 
this part of the book, you may begin to appreciate just 
how unique a personality you are, how much fun life can 
be when you make yourself part of the equation, and how 
reenergized and reinvigorated you feel as a result. Are you 
ready for that? If so, read on!

J
onathan woke up looking forward to a relaxed, productive day puttering 
around his apartment. He didn’t expect to be hassled or end up in a foul 
mood, but he was. No sooner had he awakened than his wife announced that 
it was sleeting rain outside and he would have to take her to work because 
she’d forgotten to fill up her gas tank the night before. Jonathan said, “Fine,” 
thinking he would still have plenty of time to get to his 9 a.m. massage 
appointment, which he was really looking forward to. What he couldn’t 
anticipate was that he would get stuck in a traffic jam for over 40 minutes. He 
arrived late for the massage only to learn that the massage therapist had left 
for the day. As if that wasn’t enough, on the way out of the gym he noticed 
that one of his tires was almost flat. It was only 10:30 a.m. and already 
Jonathan concluded, “I don’t think this is going to be a good day!”
What Jonathan needed was an uplift — some small pleasure in life to offset 
the multitude of stresses he had encountered. He soon found it when he 
stopped at his favorite local restaurant, had his morning coffee, and was 
happily greeted by staff and customers alike. “The world is right again,” he 
thought to himself as he lingered over his newspaper enjoying one last cup 
of java.
In this chapter, I not only emphasize how the small stresses of everyday 
life can transform our mood and affect your health, but more important, I 
show you what you can do to balance out this stress and actually end up in a 
happy frame of mind.

162
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Knowing When to Sweat the Small 
Stuff and When to Let It Go
Most people make two mistakes when it comes to being hassled — 
experiencing the small, micro-stresses that come their way each and every 
day just as surely as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west:
 
 Because these stresses are not catastrophic, earth-shaking, life-altering 
events and circumstances, people think of them as unimportant and 
not worthy of their time or attention. I mean, after all, no one dies from 
a flat tire or a missed appointment — right?
 
 People treat these minor stresses the same as major stresses (such 
as being fired from a job, getting a divorce, learning that a friend 
has cancer). In the end, they see stress as stress, no matter what the 
magnitude.
The truth, it turns out, is somewhere in the middle, and finding that balance 
between these two extremes is how you get to true happiness.
Sweating the small stuff
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the big stresses in your life are not what 
keep you from finding happiness — the little stresses are what do that, 
not individually, but collectively. Little stresses pile up and, at some point, 
they begin to take their toll. This piling up of small stresses happens easily, 
because most people ignore the potential for hassles to do harm. They 
absorb the small hassles like a sponge, until they can’t hold anymore. Think 
of this as death by a thousand paper cuts.
The other reason people don’t sweat the small stuff is that the small stuff 
is part of their daily lives, not some unusual circumstance that infrequently 
comes their way. In effect, people consider these micro-stresses normal — 
just part of life.
But guess what? Medical research has shown that the impact of little, petty 
annoyances in the long run is far greater than that of the occasional big 
stress. And the more hassled you are, the less happy you tend to be.
The worst kind of hassles are those that are chronic — ones you experience 
repeatedly as part of an otherwise routine day. The grouchy neighbor who 
gives you the evil eye every day when you walk your dog past her house. The 
secretary whose first words to you when you come to work each morning 

163
 Chapter 13: Hassles versus Uplifts
are, “Have you seen the obituaries — so-and-so died of cancer?” Or the friend 
you regularly eat lunch with who always find some way to get you to pick up 
the check. Sound familiar?
 
 In the “Looking at How Hassled and Uplifted You Are” section, later in this 
chapter, I show you how to calculate when you’re in what I call the “red zone” 
as far as hassles go.
Letting the small stuff go
You can’t let go of the events that stress you, but you can let go of the 
physical and psychological impact that these events have on you. For 
example, in the introduction to this chapter, I tell the story of Jonathan. 
Jonathan couldn’t do anything about the sleet or the flat tire, but he was able 
to let go of his initial negative thought — “I don’t think this is going to be a 
good day” — and replace it with a more positive thought: “The world is right 
again.”
Uplifting experiences lessen the impact of stress. They do this by 
transforming:
 
 Tension into relaxation
 
 Negative thoughts into positive thoughts
 
 Pessimism into optimism (see Chapter 5)
 
 Agitation into calm
 
 Displeasure into pleasure
 
 Anger into love
 
 Sadness into joy
 
 Alienation into a feeling of being connected
 
 Chaos into harmony
Looking at How Hassled 
and Uplifted You Are
I’m betting you don’t realize just how hassled you are, partly because you 
tend to ignore and trivialize the small stuff, but, even more important, 
because you have no way to measure how much stress you’re under. Well, 
that all changes now.

164
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Look over the following list of minor stresses (or hassles) that people 
commonly experience and circle any of those that you’ve experienced within 
the past two weeks.
 
 I misplaced or lost something important.
 
 I didn’t have enough money to pay a bill on time.
 
 I felt like I had too many responsibilities.
 
 I was interrupted while I was working on something important.
 
 I had to wait in line at a store or bank.
 
 Unexpected company showed up on my doorstep.
 
 I had to fill out a lot of bureaucratic forms.
 
 I had a cold.
 
 Unexpected bad weather hit my town.
 
 My car had trouble starting first thing in the morning.
 
 My neighbors were noisy.
 
 I got poor service in a restaurant.
 
 I was late for an important meeting.
 
 A friend forgot our planned lunch date.
 
 I spilled something on my clothes.
 
 I found gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
 
 I forgot my doggy bag in a restaurant.
 
 I forgot my computer password.
 
 I forgot a haircut appointment.
 
 I didn’t have change for a parking meter.
How many hassles did you circle? Your hassle score should be between 0 
and 20. (The odds of your getting a 0 are remote — no one lives a totally 
stress-free life!) Write down your hassle score here:
My hassle score = __________
Now, do the same thing for uplifts. Look at the following list of events and 
circumstances that typically bring peace, joy, happiness, and satisfaction to 
most people and circle any of those that you’ve experienced within the past 
two weeks.

165
 Chapter 13: Hassles versus Uplifts
 
 I received an unexpected compliment.
 
 A friendly neighbor visited.
 
 I heard from an old friend I hadn’t talked to in a while.
 
 I found something I thought I had lost.
 
 I found something I really wanted on sale.
 
 I unexpectedly had some free time on my hands.
 
 A friend treated me to lunch.
 
 I spent a few quiet moments in a church, temple, or mosque.
 
 I spent quality time with my pet.
 
 I received a bouquet of flowers from an admirer.
 
 I got a hug.
 
 I found something unique to add to my collectibles.
 
 I beat my best friend at our favorite sport.
 
 I finished a project ahead of time.
 
 I started a new hobby.
 
 I worked in my flower garden.
 
 I saw a great movie.
 
 I went to the latest exhibit at the local art museum.
 
 I socialized with friends and family.
 
 Someone wishes me a “blessed day.”
How many uplifts did you circle? Your uplifts score should be between 0 and 
20. Write down your uplift score here:
My uplift score = __________
 
It goes without saying that people have their own idea of what constitutes a 
hassle and uplift.  One person may find “unexpected company” a hassle, but it 
could be your idea of a lot of fun.  The lists I’ve used here are typical of those 
used by psychologists, but you can make your own lists if you want.  Write 
down all the hassles — minor irritants - that have happened to you in the past 
two weeks and do the same for uplifts — little pleasures.  How many of each 
did you come up with?
 
Life is always in flux. Some days, weeks, and months are more hassle-free than 
others, and uplifting experiences tend to come and go. That’s why it’s good to 
recheck your scores from time to time to see how you’re doing.

166
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
What’s crucial to finding happiness is not how hassled or uplifted you are, 
but rather the balance between the two. This balance I call your Uplifted-to-
Hassles Ratio (UHR). To calculate your UHR, all you need to do is take your 
uplifts score and divide it by your hassles score. For example, if your uplifts 
score is a 4 and your hassles score is a 10, your UHR would be 4 ÷ 10 = 0.40. If 
your uplifts score is 12 and your hassles score is 6, your UHR is 12 ÷ 6 = 2. The 
higher your U-HR score, the better.  (You can make this calculation whether 
you’re using the scores you obtained from the lists I provided or your own 
self-generated lists — it’s all the same.) Generally speaking, any UHR score 
less than 1 is a problem, because it suggests that you’re definitely not at a 
happy medium when it comes to hassles versus uplifts.
 
Avoiding hassles is difficult. The easiest way to up your UHR score is to 
increase your uplifts.
How do you increase your uplifts?  Simple: You do little things that bring you 
pleasure. You don’t just wait passively to be uplifted — you make it happen!  
For example, you can lift your spirits by:
 
 Treating yourself to a delicious dessert in the middle of the afternoon.
 
 Spending your lunch hour sunning yourself on a park bench.
 
 Taking 20 minutes to meditate.
 
 Taking time to feed the birds who visit your yard before going off to 
work.
 
 Watching children at play.
 
 Daydreaming about positive experiences you’ve had in the past.
 
 Giving yourself permission to have that extra cup of coffee before you 
join the “rat race.”
 
 Enjoying a glass of wine at an outdoor café.
 
 Listening to some of your favorite songs while you drive from point A to 
point B.
 
 Reading a magazine article about something that interests you.
These are all things that you can initiate.  They don’t depend on what other 
people are willing or able to do that might please you.  They’re things that 
you have control over.
One of the things I liked most about the year I spent in Holland was the way 
the Dutch people celebrate birthdays.  When it’s your birthday, you get 
up in the morning and announce to everyone “Today’s my birthday!”  And, 

167
 Chapter 13: Hassles versus Uplifts
you keep doing that throughout the entire day everywhere you go.  Also, 
you bring your own sweets to the office to let everyone share in your day 
of celebration.  It’s not like here in America, where we depend on others — 
family, friends, and co-workers — to remember what day it is and to make 
sure we enjoy it.  The Dutch leave nothing to chance — they make sure their 
birthday is an uplifting experience for one and all.
Another way you can enhance your UHR score is to do something to uplift 
the lives of others. Instead of waiting for someone to hug you, go find 
someone to hug. Instead of hoping that your friendly neighbor will drop over, 
be the friendly neighbor and pay her a visit. Sure, you’ll feel good if a friend 
buys you lunch — but you’ll also feel good if you treat him. Any kindness you 
extend elevates your UHR score.
Uplifts and major stress
Both in their early 40s, Mattie and her husband, 
Sam, found themselves sandwiched between 
the normal duties of working and raising two 
children and at the same time being caretak-
ers for Mattie’s mother, who was in a nearby 
nursing home paralyzed from a stroke. Mattie 
was an only child, so the burdensome respon-
sibility of trying to reduce her mother’s suf-
fering fell squarely on her shoulders. She and 
her husband were religious in their efforts to 
minister to her mother each evening after they 
had worked all day, fed the kids, and left them 
home to do their homework and entertain them-
selves. They tried to be in good spirits despite 
the depressing nursing home environment and 
they reminded themselves (and each other) 
that this was a labor of love. But, the days were 
long and they found themselves exhausted as 
they headed from the nursing home to their 
own home — where they would then have to 
pick up their responsibilities as parents before 
finally heading for bed.
“It was a tough grind for those four months 
before mother died,” admitted Mattie, “but we 
have no regrets. What helped us most was the 
fact that we stopped along the way home each 
night and got ourselves an ice cream cone at 
the mall.” That simple little pleasure (or uplift) 
went a long way toward helping these two nice 
people keep their sanity through one of the 
more difficult times of their lives. Sam summed 
it up best when he said, “Don’t underestimate 
the power of an ice cream cone!”
If you’re not yet convinced of the survival 
value of life’s everyday pleasures, read Viktor 
Frankl’s masterful book Man’s Search For 
Meaning, in which he describes how a few 
small pleasures — an extra scrap of food, a 
beautiful skyline — helped him survive the 
Holocaust in a concentration camp and actu-
ally granted him a few blissful moments of hap-
piness. You’ll find all the proof you need in this 
small but powerful book.

Uplifts and depression
A study at Texas Tech University revealed 
that students’ hassle scores were positively 
correlated with scores on a standardized test 
of depression — the more hassles a person 
reported, the greater the degree of depression. 
Interestingly, they found no link between 
uplifts scores and depression. In other words, 
having lots of little pleasures in your life won’t 
by itself prevent depression. However, when 
these investigators examined the relationship 
between the ratio of hassles and uplifts to 
depression, they noted that uplifts seem to 
play a protective role in keeping depression 
symptoms at a minimum — in other words, 
uplifts don’t cause you to be happy; they buffer 
you from unhappiness.
Here’s a case in point: Alex had been seriously 
depressed for some time now and he was doing 
everything he could think of to improve his 
mental health. He was taking the antidepressant 
drug his psychiatrist had prescribed and he 
never missed his weekly therapy appointment, 
but his mood remained steadfastly negative. He 
felt useless, hopeless, and grossly inadequate 
when it came to coping with all the challenges 
in his life — those associated with running 
a business, being a husband, having two 
children, taking care of elderly parents, and so 
on. To say that Alex was unhappy would be an 
understatement!
One day, as he was reviewing all the distressful 
circumstances of the previous week, his 
therapist interrupted (something he rarely 
did) to inquire about what Alex planned to do 
the following weekend. Without thinking, Alex 
began to check off all the stressful obligations 
he had to his family — errands that needed to 
be run, chores around the house, attending his 
kids’ sports events — all the while looking sad 
and lacking in energy. His therapist interrupted 
again, suggesting that he wasn’t really 
interested in what Alex had planned to do for 
all these other people — he wanted to know 
what Alex planned to do for himself over the 
weekend.
Alex went silent. He couldn’t answer immediately 
because he wasn’t used to thinking about 
himself — his needs — and things he could do 
to bring pleasure into his life directly without first 
bringing pleasure into someone else’s life. His 
therapist said, “Maybe one of the many reasons 
you find yourself so depressed is that your life 
is out of balance — all stress and no pleasure. 
You know, Alex, the human brain needs a little 
pleasure once in a while, just like your physical 
body needs oxygen, food, and water.”
Alex thought about what his therapist said and 
realized it made a lot of sense, at least as much 
sense as taking a pill for depression every day. 
So, he began — on his own — to seek out the 
little pleasures of everyday life that he has long 
forgotten. He started making opportunities 
to meet a friend for lunch, volunteered in his 
community, and went back to church (ever 
since he was a child, Alex had always found 
Sunday sermons comforting and uplifting).
Alex was learning that therapy isn’t so much 
about healing the mind as it is about helping 
people get back on the right track — the one 
that leads to happiness and peace of mind. 
The more Alex fed his brain these little bits of 
pleasure, the better he felt, and the better he 
felt the more he wanted to uplift his own life 
as well as the lives of others. He was now 
in a positive cycle that would go a long way 
toward unwinding him from a devastating mood 
disorder.
Remember: Depression is a serious medical 
condition. If you’ve been diagnosed with 
depression, be sure to talk to your doctor 
about your treatment, and never stop taking 
a medication you’ve been prescribed without 
consulting with your doctor first.

169
 Chapter 13: Hassles versus Uplifts
Not sure if you may be suffering from depression? 
Here are some common signs and symptoms:
  Persistent feelings of sadness
  Spontaneous crying spells (or feeling like 
you need to cry but can’t)
  Loss of appetite
  Feeling alone even in the company of 
others
  Thoughts of harming yourself
  Waking up in the middle of the night and 
being unable to get back to sleep
  Increased irritability
  Difficulty concentrating or remembering 
things
  Fatigue unrelated to activity
  A declining disinterest in sexual activity
If you’ve experienced four or more of these 
elements of depression, talk to your doctor 
or a mental-health professional. Depression 
is treatable, and there’s no reason to delay 
seeking help.

Structure versus Freedom
In This Chapter
 Moving on with your life
 Enjoying doing nothing
 Understanding the importance of rituals
 Planning and un-planning
 Maintaining a sense of purpose
T
here is no question that human beings need structure — somewhere to 
go and something to do — throughout their lives, but it is equally true 
that they need a certain measure of freedom as well. Too much or too little of 
either makes for an unhappy life.
Consider the story of Brad. Before he was injured at the age of 46, Brad was 
a happy man. He enjoyed working — so much so that he always had two or 
more jobs at one time. He was a union steward, enjoying the respect of his 
fellow employees, and a highly skilled tradesman. With only a high school 
education, he had raised four healthy children, who were now married with 
families of their own. He was in exceptionally good health for his age, still 
married to his high school sweetheart, and debt free. Brad had a lot to be 
grateful for and he knew it. But then he injured his back, and all that changed 
in a heartbeat.
His doctors were unable to restore him to a pain-free life. Everything that 
had meant anything to Brad — that had given him a sense of purpose and 
identity — was gone, leaving him bitter and depressed. At his lowest point, 
Brad seriously considered suicide, but he decided otherwise. He also 
decided at that critical moment to find a way to once again enjoy life, to be 
productive, and to reconnect with the world around him. Twenty years later, 
Brad finds himself what I would call a “happy pain patient.”
He gradually restructured his life — building a new house, traveling, 
developing new hobbies, and hosting a weekly poker game for the guys — so 
that he now has less free time to sit around and dwell on his pain and more 
opportunity to make a positive impact on the world around him. And that’s 
what this chapter is all about.

Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Living a Life of Purpose
The subtitle of Rick Warren’s best-selling book The Purpose Driven Life: What 
on Earth Am I Here For? begs a question that is key to achieving happiness. 
What is the point of your existence? What is your purpose? What are you 
called to do? How is the world better off for your being here? What will the 
world miss when you’re gone?
Living a purposeful life doesn’t necessarily mean that life is static, 
unchanging. In other words, your purpose — why you’re here — stays the 
same, but the way you spend your time can change dramatically.
For example, at the beginning of my career, I was a dedicated academician, 
heavily involved in training students, and I was conducting research projects 
to enlighten the world about the relationships between psychology and 
medicine. I often spoke at national conferences and I was a prolific author. 
Then one day I quit all that and entered the world of private practice where 
I spent my time trying to ease the suffering of troubled souls within my 
community. No more white coats, no more entourage of students following 
me like little ducklings, no more applause at scientific meetings — just me, 
my clients, and the sanctuary of my small office. And now I spend most of 
my time writing self-help books and flying around the country conducting 
workshops for all sorts of professionals interested in things like stress, anger, 
and happiness. The activities and structure of my professional life have 
changed over the years, but the purpose has not: I am an educator — first, 
last, and always.
 
What is your purpose in life? Do you have one yet or are you still looking? 
Instead of searching for something — some task, activity, career — that you 
think will make you happy, turn it around and think about those times when 
you’re the happiest and ask yourself, “What was I doing at the time?”
Restructuring Your Life after 
a Major Life Change
The journey of life has many twists and turns. One minute you think you 
know what your purpose in life is, and then everything changes. You get com-
fortable with one type of structure — having a career, being a parent — and 
suddenly you’re out of a job. Then what do you do? Basically, you have two 
choices: You can sit and mourn for the rest of your life, or you can restruc-
ture your life into something different yet meaningful. The choice is yours.

173
 Chapter 14: Structure versus Freedom
Moving on after graduation
When I was a kid, moving on after graduation from high school was easier 
than it is today — your choices were limited. Parents didn’t invite their kids 
to hang around for a year or two while they were trying to find themselves. 
Nowadays, that’s all changed. Psychologists suggest that there’s even a new 
stage of development now called emerging adulthood, which is basically 
somewhere between adolescence and adulthood. In effect, it’s growing up 
but not moving on.
 
Assuming that you might be one of those many young people who, after 
graduating college, finds herself back home with your parents, here are some 
suggestions for restructuring your life:
 
 Be clear what it is that you expect of yourself now that you are back 
at home. Do you expect to act the same as you did when you last lived 
there? Or, do you see yourself as someone who is capable of living 
a more independent life now than when you finished high school? 
Remember: The more you expect of yourself, the less your parents have 
to expect of you.
 
 Talk with your parents about what you (and they) see as obstacles to 
you moving on with your life. Are economics an issue? Are there suf-
ficient opportunities for employment in your home community? Do you 
feel like your parents expect you to be their “child” again just because 
you’re back home?
 
 Imagine that you’re living on your own and set up a daily routine that 
you would follow were that the case. Think of your time at home as 
practice — a dress rehearsal — for what comes next in your life. If you 
would fix your own meals, do your own laundry, do your own ironing if 
you were on your own, then do these same things while you’re at home.
 
 Assume as much responsibility as possible. If you’re working, help out 
with the household expenses — buy some groceries, offer to pay a little 
rent, and chip in on the utilities. Also think about ways to help out that 
don’t cost anything, for example, mowing the lawn, washing your mom’s 
car, taking the family pet for a walk.  
 
 Set a specific time limit for how long you plan to remain at home. 
Better to say to yourself (and your parents) “It’ll help if I can stay with 
you for the next six months” than “I plan to be here for a while.” The 
more vague your time limit, the greater the chances that you’ll be with 
your folks longer than you (or they) want you to be.
 
 Set some specific goals for yourself that will move you forward. For 
example, decide where you want to live once you leave home for good. 
Do you plan to live in the same town only have a place of your own? 

174
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Or, do you see yourself living elsewhere? Start checking out housing 
possibilities so you have some concrete idea of what’s available and 
what it’s likely to cost you. Do a computer search of job opportunities 
in whatever city you’re planning to move to eventually. Work on your 
resume and make contacts with friends from high school or college that 
live where you’re planning to move.
 
 Let your parents know that it’s important that you move on to the next 
stage of your life so that they can do the same. That way you’ll both be 
happy!
Filling the empty nest
Another major life change occurs when children grow up and leave home 
for good. Parents who have devoted the lion’s share of their time and energy 
to their kids suddenly find themselves with a big empty space in their lives. 
Some handle that change well — others do not.
Kay is lost without her daughter, who is 35 years old and lives in another 
state. If her daughter doesn’t call her everyday by 5 p.m., she gets anxious 
and begins calling her daughter’s friends to see where she is. Rather than be 
embarrassed, her daughter has learned to check in with mom — hardly what 
she expected life to be like when she left home three years ago.
Kay is suffering from empty nest syndrome. For more than two decades, her 
daughter was her life — and now that life is gone forever, and Kay has done 
nothing to replace it.
Missy, too, has a daughter in her 30s living out of state. She doesn’t see her 
as much as she’d like, but Missy is happy that she’s enjoying the fact that 
her daughter is independent. When Missy doesn’t hear from her daughter, 
she assumes she’s busy and Missy understands. And what’s Missy doing 
in between phone calls from her daughter? She’s busy with her own 
interests — she does things with her friends, she travels. . . . In fact, Missy’s 
daughter sometimes has trouble getting in touch with her, and Missy tells her 
daughter, “Honey, your father and I have our own life now — get used to it!”
If you’re a parent like Kay, who needs to restructure your life, here are a few 
tips on how to proceed:
 
 Remind yourself that the real purpose of being a parent is to do every-
thing you can to ensure that your child will grow into an independent 
adult and them recognize that you’ve actually accomplished that.  
 
 Reconnect with friends your own age that you may have lost contact 
with all those years you were busy parenting. See if you can plug 
back into some activities — golf foursome, bridge group — that involve 
having fun but don’t involve kids.

175
 Chapter 14: Structure versus Freedom
 
 If you weren’t working while you raised your children, find yourself 
a job — doesn’t have to be full-time; part-time will do. And, don’t be 
afraid to try something new — if you used to be a nurse, but haven’t 
done that for years, maybe you’d enjoy working in retail for a change.
 
 If you’re married, get reacquainted with your spouse. Start dating 
again, in effect. Go off on some long weekends or vacations to places 
you haven’t been to in years, but used to enjoy, or better yet some place 
you’ve both always wanted to go but couldn’t because of the kids.
 
 Develop some new interests that you can share with your kids when 
you see them. Surprise them — let them know that they’re not the only 
ones who are growing and moving on in life.
 
 Find someone else to (unofficially) parent. My wife and I spend a lot of 
time with several young couples about the same ages of our children. 
They seem to enjoy having some older folks around to seek advice from 
and encourage them during times when things aren’t going smoothly — 
and, we enjoy being around all that youthful energy.
Ensuring a happy retirement
A 62-year-old man came to see me for counseling, and our conversation went 
like this:
Gentry: Why are you here? How can I help you?
Client: My wife and my doctor thought I needed to talk to someone. I’m 
having trouble getting out of bed in the morning and starting my day, and 
I’m also having some periodic chest pain.
Gentry: Okay. Tell me a little about yourself.
Client: Well, I’m retired. I got a buyout package last year that was too 
good to pass up. That’s pretty much it. My wife and I get along, our house 
is paid off, and I’m in pretty good health.
Gentry: I see. Had you planned to retire early?
Client: No. I’d planned to work until I was 65, but this came up unexpectedly.
Gentry: So, what are you doing with yourself now?
Client: I told you — I’m retired!
Gentry: I heard that, but what I want to know is what exactly do you do 
with your time? You know, activities.
Client: I play golf three day a week.

176
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Gentry: Anything else?
Client: I play tennis with some guys twice a week.
Gentry: Anything else?
Client: Not really. I read the paper every morning, but otherwise just 
tennis and golf. And occasionally we go out to eat with a group of friends.
I met with the man four or five times, explaining to him that he was showing 
signs of an impending depression and that he needed to get more involved in 
life. All he would say each time I made a suggestion was, “But I’m retired!”
After those first four or five visits, he disappeared, only to reappear on my 
appointment book several months later. Once again, he came in because 
his wife and doctor felt he needed counseling. He was beginning to 
experience intermittent panic attacks and his unexplained chest pain 
continued. When I asked him what was going on in his life, again he said 
simply, “I’m retired — a little golf and tennis and that’s about it.” I repeated 
what I had told him before about restructuring his life, he resisted, and again 
he disappeared after a few visits.
A few months later, he came in to see me again. As soon as he sat down on 
my couch, I said “Look, if we’re going to have the same conversation we did 
the last two times you were here, why don’t you just get up and leave now?” 
To my surprise, he wanted to stay and talk about what he needed to do to 
be happier. The good news: Today, he’s busy spending a lot of time with his 
grandchildren, traveling with his wife, and participating in a citizens group 
that loves to go to city hall and bug the town fathers — along with playing 
golf and tennis. He looks forward to getting up in the morning and there’s no 
more chest pain.
 
A healthy retirement should be a time of structured freedom — a time when 
you can live life on your own terms, but where you have somewhere to go and 
something to do each day.
 
If you’re thinking about retiring, have you considered how you’ll spend your 
free time? Do you have any hobbies or special interests outside of work? 
Do you have enough projects to keep you busy? Are there things that you 
and your spouse like to do together — shared interests? How are you fixed 
for friends? Having free time is one thing; loneliness is quite another (see 
Chapter 22). These are the kinds of questions you need to be asking yourself 
before you retire.
If you’re already retired and are still trying to “find a fit” in this new stage of 
life, my advice is the same: You have to find somewhere to go, something 
(meaningful) to do, and someone to do it with. I know a retired engineer who 
works at a golf course on weekends selling buckets of golf balls at the driving 
range and making sure everyone sticks to their assigned tee times. And, 

177
 Chapter 14: Structure versus Freedom
there’s the lawyer who volunteers at the local hospital, wheeling sick 
patients from place to place. As for me, since I love writing and books, I’m 
seriously thinking about getting a part-time job in a small, local bookstore 
after I retire — I can’t think of a better way to spend my time.  
Recognizing the Importance of Rituals
Much of everyday life is made up of rituals — established, predictable, pat-
terned behaviors that structure the day. There are morning rituals (brushing 
your teeth, showering, reading the newspaper), midday rituals (everything 
from the so-called “power lunch” to a simple baloney sandwich in your 
office), and evening rituals (a cocktail or two, dinner at 6 p.m., a few minutes 
of intimate conversation with your spouse, and — if you’re lucky — sex).
Rituals are a form of structure that actually make life flow more easily. 
They’re mindless — you do them without thinking. Perhaps most important 
of all, they orient you as to where you are and what you should be doing. 
Rituals are like an invisible watch — if you’re taking a shower, it must be 
morning! Without rituals, every day is a new day full of unpredictability, 
uncertainty, and the possibility of unhappiness.
Here are some examples of what I’m talking about — rituals you can incorpo-
rate into your life (if you haven’t already):
 
 Exercising first thing in the morning
 
 Having morning coffee with friends at a local restaurant
 
 Sitting for a few minutes of quiet contemplation, in meditation or prayer
 
 Getting a professional massage once a month
 
 Browsing through your favorite bookstore every Saturday morning
 
 Checking in via e-mail with loved ones once a day
 
 Enjoying a quiet cup of tea while reading the newspaper
 
 Taking an afternoon nap
 
 Enjoying some quality, one-on-one time with your pet
 
 Writing letters to long-distance friends once a week
 
 Watching your favorite evening news show on TV
 
 Attending religious services regularly
 
 Reading for a few minutes at bedtime
 
 Spending five minutes every day reflecting on all the things you have to 
be grateful for

178
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
Don’t become a slave to rituals — otherwise, they become tedious. If some-
thing more interesting comes along at the same time you normally take your 
afternoon nap, go for it! You can always nap tomorrow.
Knowing When to Plan and When Not To
Lately, it seems as if human beings need a plan for everything. Fewer and 
fewer people can get through the day without a BlackBerry or PalmPilot. 
Parents plan for their children’s college education when the kids are still 
in kindergarten. There are retirement planners, travel planners, wedding 
planners, and even people who — for a fee — will help you plan the perfect 
birthday party for your 5-year-old.
But as with many things in life, you can have too much of a good thing. 
Planning becomes excessive or unbalanced when every second is accounted 
for well in advance, leaving no room whatsoever for the three Ss: surprises, 
spontaneity, and serendipity:
 
 Surprise: Everyday life seldom goes exactly according to plan. There’s 
always a surprise or two in store for you somewhere along the way. 
Actually, surprises are what make one day different from the next. If 
your schedule is jam packed, any surprise — even a happy one — will 
be seen as an intrusion and will leave you feeling stressed.  
 
 Spontaneity: Sometimes it pays to act in the moment without a whole 
lot of thoughtful consideration. If a friend calls and wants you to meet 
them at Starbucks for coffee, don’t think about whether you should or 
not, just say YES!   
 
 Serendipity: The word serendipity literally means “happy accident.” 
You have a moment of serendipity when you run into an old friend on 
the street, when an appointment is cancelled and you have an hour of 
free time, or when you get two complimentary tickets to the opening 
of a new museum at the last minute. You’ll always have the plan. The 
question is, will you ever have this opportunity again?
No exceptions, please!
A dear friend of mine has been taking friends to 
college football games for years and everything 
about the day is a ritual. We leave at the same 
time, stop at the same gas station on the way to 
the game, park in the same spot, eat at the same 
restaurant, and stop at the same gas station 
on the way home. Once, he let his friends talk 
him into eating at a different restaurant and his 
team lost the game — and that was the last 
time there was an exception to the rule.

179
 Chapter 14: Structure versus Freedom
 
Allow for the unexpected, unplanned, and unforeseen events, circumstances, 
and challenges that come your way each day. If you take advantage of the 
opportunities that fall into your lap, instead of sticking religiously to a sched-
ule, you’ll make each day one of surprise, spontaneity, and serendipity — and 
increase your happiness, too!
Spending More Time Doing 
Absolutely Nothing
Some people simply can’t comprehend the psychological benefit that comes 
from doing absolutely nothing — nothing that’s productive, that is, in a 
material or tangible sense like building things or making money. On the other 
hand, when you do nothing, you produce a state of relaxation. Funny how
that works!
 
Here are some tips on how to spend more time doing nothing:
 
 Rent a dozen of your favorite movies and spend the entire weekend 
watching them. Your kids will love you!
 
 Get up on Saturday morning and head out for the day without any 
particular agenda or destination. If something along the road to nowhere 
catches your eye, stop.
 
 Waste some time at a flea market. Browse, don’t buy.
 
 When you have an unexpected snow day and can’t go anywhere, make 
sure you don’t get dressed, don’t work, and don’t do any chores. Think 
of the day as a gift!
 
 Spend the whole day reading your favorite novel — lose yourself in the 
author’s world.
Just enjoy being
My wife and I have two lovely children, both of 
whom live out of state. When we first started 
visiting them, they were always planning lots 
of activities — eating out in great restaurants, 
visiting museums, sightseeing trips — to 
entertain us.
But as time has gone on, they’ve slowly but 
surely come to appreciate the fact that my wife 
and I don’t need to be constantly busy. Mostly, 
we just enjoy being with them, since we don’t 
get to see them that much throughout the year. 
We’re perfectly content to just hang around 
the house with them day or night — doing 
nothing special and yet having a great feeling 
of togetherness. That’s what makes us happy.

 Plan a weekend so that when you go to work on Monday morning and 
people ask you what you did, you can say, with a smile on your face, 
“Absolutely nothing!”
 
 Take the advice I give in Chapter 15 and lose your watch. It’s much 
easier to do nothing if you don’t know what time it is.
Making Sure Your Life 
Is Like a Chinese Menu
In some Chinese restaurants, you can still order family style — choosing 
some items from Column A and others from Column B. Column A has the fan-
cier, higher-priced dishes, and Column B has less costly but still tasty treats. 
In the end, it’s the combination of A and B that made the meal unique and 
memorable.
That’s the way life is, too. Some of your daily experiences are no doubt signif-
icant (being told you got a raise or completing a project on time) while other 
are less so (a stranger letting you go ahead of her in the checkout line at the 
grocery store). But they’re all part of what makes your day positive — they’re 
stepping stones to achieving happiness.
Column A pursuits
What’s on your agenda today? What are the have-to’s? You have to do this; 
you have to do that. You have to go here; you have to go there. You have to 
see him; you have to see her. These are the things you consider essential 
to your social and economic survival. Most likely, they include some 
combination of the following:
 
 Going to the grocery store
 
 Picking up the dry cleaning
 
 Straightening up the house
 
 Paying bills
 
 Getting the car serviced
 
 Making a deposit at the bank
 
 Getting a haircut
 
 Feeding the dog
 
 Going to work
 
 Supervising work being done on your home

181
 Chapter 14: Structure versus Freedom
 
 Visiting a friend or family member in the hospital
 
 Getting your flu shot
 
 Taking your child to school
 
 Picking your child up from school
 
 Mowing the lawn
The more things you check off the list, the better you feel at the end of the 
day. You’ve met the basic necessities of everyday life. You’re surviving, but 
are you thriving? Not unless your day also includes some Column B pursuits.
 
Look over the list of Column A pursuits and check those that are on your to-do 
list today — and add any others that you have to do but that I haven’t listed 
here. This gives you a picture of just how structured your day is and what that 
structure looks like. Do you like what you see?
Column B pursuits
Think of Column B pursuits as your hidden agenda. Column B is all about 
want-to’s: You want to do that; you want to go there; you want to see her. 
Think of this as the icing on the cake. Of course, you can live life without 
them, but they sure make life a lot sweeter!
Consider the following examples:
 
 Sitting quietly and reading the paper before you start your day
 
 Filling up the bird-feeder so you can enjoy the comings and goings of 
your feathered friends
 
 Taking a leisurely walk around the block
 
 Meeting a friend for lunch
 
 Watching children at play
 
 Having a quiet moment of prayer
 
 Spending some quality time with your child after school
 
 Reading the comics
 
 Checking out a new clothing store
 
 Chatting with your next-door neighbor at the mailbox
 
 Taking a catnap
These are the little things that spice up your day. Use them to fill in the 
cracks between Column A pursuits — for example, meeting a friend for lunch 
in between picking up the dry cleaning and having the tires rotated.

182
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
How many Column B–type things did you do today? Chances are you had 
fewer Column B experiences than ones that fall under Column A — and that’s 
probably one reason you bought this book. If your life is full of Column A 
pursuits and short on Column B, restructure your day to make it look more 
like a Chinese menu — with choices from both columns.
Indulging Your Alternative Self
I believe that each person has two selves:
 
 The primary self, which dominates everyday life and is there for all to see
 
 The alternative self, which is not always free to express itself
Take Wayne, for example. When he’s sober, he’s a conscientious, hard-working 
man, the proud father of three children. Most of his friends know him to be 
a serious man, who always has something intelligent to say on virtually any 
topic. He’s deliberate — thinking before he acts — and not prone to impul-
sive behavior. He smiles a lot, but rarely laughs.
But when Wayne has a few drinks, he becomes a different person. He’s much 
more relaxed with his surroundings, more outgoing, more entertaining to 
those around him, more affectionate, sometimes loud and impulsive, and 
more playful. The problem is that Wayne has to get intoxicated before he can 
be his alternative self — and that often leaves him embarrassed and regretful 
the morning after.
Wayne’s challenge is: How can he indulge his alternative self without using 
alcohol? Instead of drinking, Wayne could join a local theater group where he 
could find a part where he could “play” his alternative self on stage — a lot 
of famous movie stars are introverts in real life. Or, he could be like my older 
brother, who used to dress up like a clown and ride around on a mini-cycle to 
the delight of children who’d come to see the Shrine parade.
 
Take a pad of paper and make two lists describing both your primary and 
alternative self. Describe each self by using adjectives — for example, industri-
ous, cheerful, cynical, happy-go-lucky, adventurous, conservative, and so on. How 
different are the two lists? How often do you indulge your alternative self? 
Does it take something like alcohol to release the side of you that most people 
don’t know? Are you the only one who knows your alternative self — do you 
only act silly when no one else is around?

 Avoiding burnout
S
o many people today are living an imbalanced lifestyle — but not 
because of a shortage of work. Let’s face it: It’s a hectic world out 
there, and you’re part of it! Don’t get me wrong: I don’t have anything against 
work — work is a good thing. It’s just that some people don’t know when to 
give it a rest.
Take Michelle, for example, a young woman in her mid-30s who has already 
risen to the executive level in a major corporation. She’s bright, talented, and 
a real charmer when it comes to people, but the key to achieving success so 
early in her life has been the long hours she puts in at work — she averages 
at least 75 hours per week. Definitely a good deal for her employer, but not 
such a great deal for Michelle.
When Michelle took her job, she had modest ambitions and was in no rush 
to advance — she saw it as an opportunity to learn new skills that one day 
would help her get to the top of the corporate ladder. Her life was more 
balanced then. She worked about 45 hours a week and got a lot done because 
of her excellent organizational skills — but she also had plenty of time for 
socializing, time to run marathons, time to correspond with her many friends, 
and time for her family. Michelle was happy then.
But life is subject to unexpected change. Suddenly Michelle found herself 
with a whole new set of opportunities and challenges that she simply could 
not fit into a normal work week. Something had to go, and guess what it was? 
If you said family, friends, and exercise, of course, you’d be right. The change 
wasn’t abrupt — it was more insidious, proceeding inconspicuously but with 
grave effect. Slowly but surely, Michelle became increasingly exhausted and 
an unhappy woman — successful to be sure, but unhappy nevertheless.

184
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
If you find that your life mirrors that of Michelle — too much work, too little 
play — this chapter offers you a way out. Here I give you some tips on how to 
rebalance your work-play life and, in the process, become more balanced.
Which Is More Important: Your Money 
or Your (Quality of) Life?
This was the question posed by a leading cardiologist in her keynote speech 
to a group of medical and behavioral science researchers at a conference I 
attended many years ago. I’ll never forget her first slide — a cartoon showing 
Burnout checklist
Are you burned out at work? Are you like a mis-
sile whose fuel is exhausted and is now careen-
ing down to Earth in free flight — disorganized, 
erratic, and inefficient? If six or more of the fol-
lowing statements describe you, you could be 
suffering from burnout.
  You’re accident-prone.
  You’re anxious.
  You’re agitated.
  You regularly abuse alcohol.
  You’re apathetic — you just don’t care 
about much of anything.
  You miss work a lot.
  You’re bored.
  You’re confused.
  You cry a lot.
  You’re cynical.
  You’re depressed.
  You have difficulty concentrating.
  You have frequent headaches.
  You have heartburn or indigestion.
  You feel hopeless or helpless.
  You feel hostile toward those around you.
  You can’t sleep.
  You don’t have any joy in your life.
  You can’t seem to bounce back after a 
weekend off.
If your score suggests burn out, here are three 
things you might try in an effort to “refuel” your-
self:
  Take some time-outs (breaks) during the 
work day and at regular intervals over 
time — long weekends, mini-vacations.
  Engage in as many flow activities as possi-
ble in the course of a work week. (Chapter 8 
offers a 5-step process for doing just that.)
  Take as many opportunities as you can to 
relax — meditate, work out in the gym, sit 
quietly and read a good book.   

185
 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
a well-dressed man standing in an alley at gunpoint, arms raised above 
his head, with this caption: “Your money or your life?” Needless to say, 
that cartoon got everyone’s attention and set the stage for several days of 
intelligent discussion about the role that societal demands and stress play in 
causing heart disease and premature death.
The point the speaker was trying to make was simple: Each one of us makes 
countless decisions each day that basically come down to this — which is 
more important, the quantity of your material possessions or the quality of 
your life? The answer you come up with speaks volumes, it turns out, about 
your prospects for a healthy and happy future.
 
Think about how many times a day you’re presented with this choice:
 
 You have to decide whether to attend your son’s Little League game or 
stay an extra hour at work.
 
 You can play golf with your buddies on Sunday or get a jump-start on 
the week ahead by going to the office for a couple of hours.
 
 You can actually take your vacation this year or not.
 
 You can turn down a promotion that will add a little bit to your 
pocketbook, but will also pile on the stress.
 
 You can limit your work hours to the time you’re paid for or you can 
always stay until the job’s done.
 
 You can take a lunch break — get out of the office, take a walk, spend 
the time thinking about what you’ll do in your off hours — or eat lunch 
in front of the computer.
What do your choices say about you, your health, and your chances for 
happiness?
Setting Yourself Up to Be More Balanced
In general, the people who can’t seem to pull themselves away from work and 
are highly stressed are Type-A personalities. And the people who are a bit 
more laid back and relaxed are Type B’s. To understand why Type A’s spend 
so much time working and too little time playing, you have to see the world 
from their perspective and contrast that with the perspective of Type B’s 
(see Table 15-1).

186
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Table 15-1 
Type A’s versus Type B’s: Which Are You?
Type A’s . . .
Type B’s . . .
Have a rigid standard for what con-
stitutes satisfactory performance. 
They’re continually striving to meet 
some illusory goal of perfection.
Demand less from themselves even 
though they fully intend to meet the 
requirements of the job. They settle for 
being a “good employee” rather than 
striving to be a “perfect employee.”
Feel the need to engage in multiple 
tasks at the same time, giving each 
task number-one priority.
Are more satisfied completing one task 
at a time before moving on to the next 
one. They tend to prioritize tasks, rank-
ing them as more or less important.
Attribute their success at work more 
to effort than ability. Ironically, they 
seem less impressed with their own 
abilities than others are.
Understand that success comes from 
both effort and ability.
View work as a competitive enter-
prise. They often initiate competition 
in noncompetitive situations. The word 
cooperation isn’t in their vocabulary.
Make good team players. They aren’t 
averse to healthy competition but enjoy 
working collaboratively with others.
Prefer working alone but end up feeling 
like they carry the burden of getting the 
job done squarely on their shoulders.
Are quick to share the responsibility of 
work assignments so that they don’t 
become burdensome.
Seek out “Type A” work environments, 
which promote a climate of competition 
and a sense of urgency. Time is money!
Seek out “Type B” settings, where the 
quality of the work performed is appre-
ciated as much as the quantity of work.
The 24/7 mindset
At some point in the past century, the mindset 
of industrialized countries throughout the 
world changed dramatically from the idea 
that machines were created to serve human 
beings (to make our lives more comfortable, 
more efficient, more productive) to the current 
notion that human beings are here to serve the 
machines. And, because machines are capable 
of working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so 
the thinking goes, you and I should do the same. 
Hence, the birth of the 24/7 mindset!
The 24/7 mindset originated in the manufacturing 
sector but has spread to virtually all types of 
work. Many people are never without their 
cellphones — they’re available to do business 
or solve work-related problems any time, day or 
night. To make matters worse, inexpensive and 
portable office equipment — computers, fax 
machines, copiers — make it possible to have 
your office with you wherever you go.
The point of all this? Technology has made it 
easier than ever to override your life choices 
with 24/7 work, favoring work over nonwork 
activities.

187
 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
If you see yourself in that Type A column, you can make a few key changes in 
your life to adopt some more of the Type B tendencies. I fill you in on those 
changes in the following sections.
Appreciating the arts
I can hear you now, “You want me to waste my time strolling through an 
art museum when I’ve got work to do?” My answer: “Absolutely.” Music, 
paintings, sculpture, poetry — these all provide opportunities to enrich 
the spirit, to appreciate the beauty of things rather than their utility, and to 
be inspired by artistic genius. The arts transcend the material world — the 
world in which your efforts are all-important — into the heart, soul, and mind 
of the artist.
When you’re standing in front of a beautiful painting or reading an awe-
inspiring poem, you feel humble — and, humility is a much welcomed 
antidote to the feelings of superiority and self-importance that so many Type 
A people have.
 
Make a point of spending some time at least once a month attending some 
cultural event — a concert, an art exhibit, a play. Better yet, sign up for a 
membership at a local fine arts center or museum, and you’ll be sure to 
appreciate the arts — after all, Type A’s always get their money’s worth!
Expanding your horizons
Type A’s are fairly monolithic thinkers — they’re always thinking about work, 
work, and more work. Type B’s, in contrast, tend to be global thinkers — they 
see beyond the work horizon into a world full of relationship possibilities, 
hobbies, recreational pastimes, conversation with friends and neighbors, 
spirituality, community service, patriotism, and an up-close-and-personal 
relationship with nature. When you think about it, these characteristics make 
Type B’s more interesting to talk to, the sort of people you’d actually want to 
get to know — and the type of person you’d actually want to be.
 
Imagine you’re at a wedding, and you’re trying to decide who to strike up a 
conversation with. There’s the successful businessperson in the corner who 
only wants to talk about work. In the other corner: a modest looking person 
who’s a sculptor and a community activist. Who would you choose? How do 
you want other people at the same gathering to think about you when they’re 
trying to make the same decision?

188
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Being curious
Type B’s have an abundance of curiosity that leads them to expand their 
horizons. If you’re a Type B, you have an eagerness to know all there is to 
know about the world around you — not just the work world. You seek a 
variety of life experiences, a diversity of relationships, and a difference of 
opinion with others. You’re curious about what and how other people think 
and feel about things of mutual interest. You’re not afraid to explore life 
beyond your own comfort zone, and you have a tolerance for uncertainty 
that is uncharacteristic of Type A’s.
 
Every so often, go to your local bookstore and buy a book on something you 
know absolutely nothing about — you may actually learn something new! Join 
a book club that discusses a wide range of topics. Check your local newspaper 
to see what’s happening in the community this weekend, and go and discover 
what it’s all about.
Type B is very un-American
The United States is in first place when it comes to being Type A and having the greatest poten-
tial for developing heart disease. In the following table, positive (+) values indicate more Type A 
behavior among the citizens of that country; negative (–) values indicate Type B tendencies. Deaths 
resulting from coronary heart disease are calculated per 100,000 people.

 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
Putting down the grade book
A Type-B colleague of mine was invited to make a presentation at a 
prestigious medical conference. When he was done and the applause had 
died down, a Type-A physician came up to him on the stage and said, “I 
like what you had to say. I give you an A on your presentation.” Instead of 
taking that as a compliment, my Type-B friend was offended: “Why do you 
feel the need to grade me? If you liked my talk, just say you liked it and leave 
it at that.” The Type-A physician appeared speechless, no doubt thinking 
to himself “What’s wrong with that? I grade everybody — my wife, my kids, 
people who work for me, even myself.” And therein lies the problem. Instead 
of simply appreciating people for who they are and enjoying the quality of 
whatever it is that they’re doing, Type A’s tend to quantify another person’s 
behavior by assigning a numerical value.
 
When you’re complimenting or criticizing another person — at work or 
elsewhere — forgo statements like “I see you brought your A game today” or 
“You certainly didn’t put 100 percent into this one.” A simple, “You did a good 
job” or “I have a feeling you’ll do better next time” will suffice.
Losing the watch
One of the core elements of the Type-A personality is their sense of time 
urgency — what the originators of the Type A concept, Dr. Meyer Friedman 
and Dr. Ray Rosenman, refer to as hurry sickness. Type A’s are ruled by their 
watches. If you don’t believe me, ask a Type A you know to surrender his 
watch for a whole day and see what happens. You may as well be asking 
him to stop breathing — “Are you serious? I can’t go all day without know-
ing what time it is. I have a schedule and I need to stick to it.” The relation-
ship Type B’s have with time is much more flexible — they’re not plagued 
throughout the day with thoughts about time passing too fast, not having 
enough time to complete everything, and time not being on their side.
 
Most likely it’ll be hard for you to relinquish your tie to your watch at first. 
Start by taking it off and putting it in your pocket or purse (that way you’ll 
know it’s close by!) for just half a day. When you get comfortable with that, 
you can progress to a full day. Who knows, you may even work you way up to 
the point where you can live without it for a whole weekend.
 
In Chapter 8, I showed you how to get into flow — engaged in an activity that 
seems timeless, effortless, and completely satisfying. It’s easier to get into flow 
if you’re not wearing your watch!

190
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Eating slowly
Type A’s do almost everything aggressively and that includes how fast they 
eat. When you’re eating with family or friends, are you the first one to clear 
your plate? When you’re having lunch with colleagues at work, do you eat 
fast so that you can get on to business? If you finish your meal and the other 
person is still eating, do you find yourself becoming impatient? If so, you’re 
definitely Type A.
 
Here are some tips on how to become a Type-B eater:
 
 Slow down. You might try taking a bite of food, putting your silverware 
down, and counting to 10 before picking up your silverware again. 
Diet experts suggest taking four to five bites per bite of food before 
swallowing. Be sure and drink liquid frequently throughout your meal — 
this will add to the time it takes you to finish eating.  
 
 Observe the people you’re sharing a meal with and try to eat at their 
pace — unless they’re also Type A’s!
 
 Whenever possible, don’t set a specific time limit for eating. Let 
yourself take as much time to finish your meal as you need.
 
 Don’t eat alone. People tend to take longer to eat when they’re with 
others, because they’re talking as well as eating.
 
 Think of eating as a social event. In many ways, eating is a form of play. 
Enjoy the experience!
 
 Don’t eat while you’re driving. Type A’s love to do more than one 
thing at a time. Not only is it too stressful to eat while you drive, but it’s 
dangerous!
 
 Stay away from fast-food eateries. The whole idea behind fast-food 
restaurants is to get your food fast and to eat it fast. No one goes to 
McDonald’s for a leisurely meal!
 
 Relax. It helps digestion. Try reading your newspaper before and after 
you eat — or, if you’re like me, your daily devotional. It also helps to 
turn off your cell phone.
 
Sometimes the smallest change in behavior can pay big dividends in terms 
of stress reduction. For example, in Anger Management For Dummies, I 
explain how simply lowering the tone of your voice can instantly reduce the 
intensity of your anger and, similarly, how loosening your grip on the steering 
wheel can help you combat road rage. Making small changes in how you 
eat (outlined in this section) can be just as effective in your efforts to move 
beyond your Type-A tendencies.

191
 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
Thinking of yourself as a small “i”
Type A’s love to talk about themselves. Their conversation is saturated with 
I, me, and mine. Rarely do you hear them referring to we, us, or ours. This 
tendency toward self-referencing is an expression of what psychiatrists call 
the narcissistic personality. Remember the evil queen in the children’s tale 
“Snow White,” who insisted on being the “fairest of them all” and went into a 
rage after being told otherwise. Well, I can pretty much guarantee she was a 
Type A.
Type Bs are more humble creatures. They lack the feeling of grandiosity and 
sense of entitlement that typifies the Type-A personality. They appreciate the 
truth in the comedian Woody Allen’s assessment that “We’re all bozos on the 
same bus.” And they think of themselves as a small “i” in the grand scheme 
of life.
 
Find activities to engage in where you aren’t the center of attention. I 
once worked backstage on a local theater production, building and painting 
props, while all the “stars” were rehearsing their lines. I felt wonderfully 
unimportant — and I loved every minute of it! Serve on the clean-up 
committee at your church or civic organization when you’re hosting some 
type of event — for example, a pancake or spaghetti supper. Park cars at some 
large community gathering — it’s a lonely job, but somebody’s got to do it! 
Walking to work — even when you drive
Type A’s are always on the run, everywhere they go. I call it tilting forward — 
their head is way out in front (thinking of where they’re going next) and their 
feet are hurrying to catch up. No wonder they’re so exhausted at the end of 
the day.
 
A simple but effective strategy for slowing down your Type-A engine is to 
force yourself to walk longer distances to and from work. This was the first 
tool I used to change my own Type-A behavior years ago. Instead of parking 
as close as I could to the entrance to Duke University Hospital, so that I could 
get into work quickly, I intentionally parked several blocks away so that I had 
to walk through the Duke Gardens in order to get to my office. Walking past 
all those beautiful flowers and fish ponds literally transformed the tone of my 
personality and set the stage for a Type-B day. This may sound unlikely, but 
as I mention earlier, sometimes the smallest change in behavior can pay big 
dividends in terms of decreased stress.
If you park in a parking garage, why not look for the vacant space that’s 
farthest away from the entrance? You won’t have as much competition that 
way. Plus, you’ll get some much-needed exercise — what could make you 
happier?

192
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Eliminating the number-speak
I happened to be eavesdropping on a conversation (okay, I admit it — I’m 
nosey!) between two psychologists eating in a nice restaurant one evening, 
and this is what I overheard: One of the psychologists (a Type A) was telling 
his friend about all the things he’d accomplished during the past year — 
how many articles he’d had published, in which prestigious journals, how 
much grant money he’d been awarded — when the other man (a Type B) 
politely interrupted and said, “Charlie, I get it — you’ve had a fantastic year. 
No question that you’re beating the socks off all of us in this academic rat 
race. But, hey, this is our one night together — let’s not spoil it with all those 
numbers. What I really want to know is how are you — are you healthy, 
happy, that sort of thing?”
The painful truth is, the rest of the world doesn’t care about how many 
successes you’ve had or how much you’ve accomplished — the only 
person that stuff is important to is you! Why not just say, “It’s been a really 
productive year,” and let it go at that?
 
From now on, when you’re talking to other people, try reducing (or better 
yet eliminating) all the number-speak, including references to your latest golf 
scores, how much money you’ve made in the stock market, how much your 
new car cost, the square footage of your new home, or how big a raise you got 
last year.
Pretending you’re a Dutchman
In the “Type B is very un-American” sidebar in this chapter, I point out that 
the Netherlands is a Type-B culture. I can attest to that not just because of 
the statistics, but because I had the good fortune to spend a year there as an 
invited guest professor many years ago. It was wonderful experience! And, 
although I didn’t learn to speak the language, I did learn the Dutch customs.
My first awareness that Dutchmen don’t have the same crazy Type-A work 
lives that we do in the United States came one day when I returned to the 
psychology department office a few minutes after noon only to find all the 
doors locked. After trying in vain to get into the building (I had some work 
I wanted to get done during lunch), I asked a passerby where everyone 
had gone. He said, “Sir, they all go home to lunch. They’ll be back at 1:30.” I 
couldn’t believe it — an entire medical school gone home to lunch. Amazing! 
Later that day, the chairman of the department explained to me that 
Dutchmen break their workdays into two parts and refresh themselves in 
between. I remember thinking to myself, “How un-American!”
Shortly thereafter, I had my second lesson in the separation of work and play. 
The chairman and his wife were hosting a little party for my wife and me, 
and I was talking about work with several of my new Dutch colleagues. The 

193
 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
chairman discreetly pulled me away and told me, “Doyle, you need to stop 
talking about work. Everyone is being very polite and not saying anything, 
but that sort of thing is simply not done here. These men and women work 
all day; after they leave work they want to talk about other things — soccer, 
family, travel, history, or what life is like for you in the United States. You can 
talk about work tomorrow at the office.” This time I got the message loud and 
clear — work when you work and play when you play and don’t mix the two.
 
You don’t have to leave the country in order to have a more balanced lifestyle. 
Just adopt some new ways of living and working from some of these Type-B 
cultures.
Identifying the Three Types of Play
In childhood, work and play are all the same. Play is how a child learns to be 
a social being — interacting and negotiating with peers — as well as problem-
solve. Play is how a child learns to follow rules. Play develops the creative 
side of the child’s emerging personality. And play is how children first learn 
to experience happiness. As a result, play provides a foundation for similar 
behavior in adults.
How often have you heard someone at work comment about another 
employee, “He doesn’t play well with others”?
Play is not one particular type of activity — it takes on many forms. The three 
most common forms are: solitary play, parallel play, and cooperative play. All 
are important and all should continue throughout a person’s life.
In the following sections, I cover each of the main forms of play, and tell you 
how you can incorporate this kind of play into your adult life.
 
It’s important not only to strike a healthy balance between work and play, but 
to balance out the various forms of play. Make time for each in your schedule 
of daily activities.
Solitary play
Solitary play is any fun and joyful activity that you do by yourself. Hobbies 
are a good example of solitary play. You’re occupied with something you 
enjoy — stamp collecting, woodworking, the New York Times crossword 
puzzles. And, you’re doing it all by yourself, which makes it the simplest and 
most accessible type of play. Consider the following examples:
 
 Pete loves to bake, spending hours in the kitchen by himself (his wife knows 
not to intrude!) preparing rich desserts for family, friends, and neighbors.

Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
 Toiya enjoys reading — she has ever since she was a child — and can 
spend an entire weekend alone curled up with her books.
 
 Jack collects miniature Chinese figurines — a hobby he picked up while 
serving in the Air Force overseas. When he finds himself getting stressed 
out at work, he takes a break and spends a few minutes thumbing 
through catalogs and thinking about his next purchase.
 
 Ramon, an investor, has a collection of pinball machines — some worth 
quite a bit of money — sitting in his basement. When he’s through 
working or just plain bored, he gets those pinballs moving!
 
 Alice loves jigsaw puzzles. Recently, at a flea market, she found a 
1,000-piece puzzle — something that should keep her occupied for days.
Do you have a hobby? When’s the last time you spent some time with it? If 
it’s been a while, think back to how much pleasure it gave you — maybe it’s 
time to reconnect. If you don’t have a hobby, no problem. Start by visiting 
your local hobby stores and see what sorts of things are available. See if 
anything catches you attention. You might be surprised at how many fun and 
interesting activities there are waiting for you.
Parallel play
Do you like to attend college football games on Saturdays in the fall? Are you 
that guy in the brightly colored vest who spends his weekend beautifying 
America’s highways by picking up other people’s roadside trash? Ever had a 
table at the local flea market, hoping that your junk could become someone 
else’s treasure? Do you enjoy browsing through craft fairs? How about 
playing bingo? Ever run a marathon? Have you ever taken a pottery class at 
the local arts center? Do you and your spouse enjoy sitting on the beach, 
separately reading your favorite books?
These are all examples of parallel play — where you’re doing something that 
gives you pleasure alongside others who are doing the same thing. Parallel 
play is social because of the context in which it occurs. It can also constitute 
a form of healthy competitive play — for example, you and the fan next to 
you are cheering for different teams all in the spirit of good-natured rivalry.
 
If you’re an introverted personality — someone who’s shy, reserved, and not 
all that comfortable interacting with other people — parallel play may be 
easier for you to engage in than cooperative play, which I’ll talk about next.

195
 Chapter 15: Work Versus Play
Type A’s also prefer to engage in parallel play, but for different reasons. Type 
A’s always prefer competition over cooperation and they like to play at things 
where they have all the control — for instance, one-on-one competition in 
golf or tennis instead of partnering up with someone else.
Cooperative play
Cooperative play involves interacting with others in some type of pleasurable 
activity where there’s a common goal. Team sports like football, basketball, 
and soccer are examples of cooperative play. When we lived in Texas, my 
family and I enjoyed attending barbeque and chili cook-offs, where teams of 
men and women would work together to create food that tasted out of this 
world!
Cooperative play is the most advanced, social type of recreation. It allows — 
not forces — people to integrate their skills and energies in a creative way so 
that the sum is truly greater than the parts. It’s a much more intimate type of 
play.
The happiest time
One of the happiest periods in my life was 
the time when I crewed on the bateaux (flat-
bottomed boats designed to transport casks of 
tobacco) down the James River. For a week at 
a time, hundreds of my fellow Virginians and I 
dressed in period costume, slept in tents along-
side the river, and poled our boats 138 miles 
all the way to Richmond. We were like kids 
again — laughing and playing — as we went 
along.
No one talked about work. No one talked about 
world events. No one engaged in any meaning-
ful or serious discussions about the economy or 
politics. No one read a newspaper or watched 
TV. There was absolutely no way to tell who was 
the psychologist, the surgeon, or the banker.
What we did instead was nap during the day, 
drink beer, have water-balloon fights with 
crews from other boats, and basically act silly. 
We cooked over open fires, had horseshoe 
competitions, bathed in the river, and sat up late 
into the night swapping stories. No one wore a 
watch — we went by “river time,” which trans-
lates into something like “We’ll get there when 
we get there and not until.” We revisited an ear-
lier time in history when life was less comfort-
able, but a whole lot more balanced.
This was cooperative play at its best.

196
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Cooperative play also fosters a sense of the small “i” that I talk about earlier 
in this chapter — where each participant is a part of some enjoyable activity 
rather than the “whole” of it. This type of play is preferred by Type Bs.
What’s your favorite type of cooperative play? How long has it been since 
you engaged with your playmates? Maybe it’s time to join in the fun. Here are 
some possibilities:
 
 Card games — like duplicate bridge — that involve partners.
 
 Riding a bicycle built for two — better known as riding in tandem.
 
 Joining a bowling team — low score buys the beers!
 
 A quilting club — my mother belonged to one for years and it kept her 
feeling youthful despite her advancing age.
 
 Book clubs — the reading you do on your own, but the fun is in the 
group discussions about what you learned and enjoyed about the book.

K
im headed off west towards the mountains of Tennessee, leaving 
behind the rolling hills of central Virginia. He was also leaving behind 
all the problems, responsibilities, and demands of his otherwise hectic, 
middle-class life. He was leaving behind all those people who defined his day-
to-day existence — his son, parents, brother, girlfriend, friends, and clients. 
Kim was en route to spend an entire weekend with someone who all too often 
seemed like a perfect stranger — himself. He wasn’t running away from the 
world of socialization; he was only taking a much needed leave of absence. In 
doing so, he was attempting to rebalance his life with 72 hours of solitude.
In this chapter, I explain why it’s important to have enough social connec-
tions, help you appreciate the many facets of social support, and show you 
how having a confidant not only leads to happiness, but can actually save 
your life. I also explain how you can be alone without being lonely. And I give 
you some tips on how, when, and where you have the best chance of finding 
a moment of solitude.
Recognizing That Happiness 
Doesn’t Occur in a Vacuum
Human beings are social creatures. We’re also wired for emotions, and we 
experience those emotions within a social context. We’re at our best when 
we’re engaging one another in the course of daily activities — at work and at 
play. If those activities are productive, constructive, involve mutual coopera-
tion, and contribute to our ultimate survival, we tend to feel joyful, happy, 

198
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
and satisfied. If they’re unproductive, destructive, or involve conflict, we feel 
just the opposite — anxious, resentful, and dissatisfied. What’s important is 
the nature of your relationships and the extent to which they’re supportive.
Do you have meaningful social ties?
By meaningful social ties, I don’t mean the usual, “Hey, how are you? What’s 
happening?” kind of superficial connections that make up much, if not most, 
of your daily routine. I’m talking about relationships — ties — that give your 
life a sense of purpose and without which you’d be just another lost soul.
One of my clients was dying from Lou Gehrig’s disease (ALS). He said, “I’m 
blessed with good friends — the kind of friends who you could go to in the 
middle of the night and ask to borrow their new Cadillac to drive from 
Virginia to California and, without a thought, they’d say yes.” Do you have 
meaningful relationships like that in your life?
What makes a social tie meaningful is that it is unusually close, special, and 
one that has far greater impact on your life than the more commonplace, 
casual relationships we all enjoy. I think it is safe to say that not everyone 
you know would loan you their new car for a cross-country trip “no questions 
asked.” Another way to decide if a relationship is meaningful is to ask your-
self, “How would my life change if she wasn’t in it anymore?” If the answer is 
“a whole lot — more than I want to think about,” then, no question, you have 
a meaningful tie with her.
How big is your network?
A social network is the quantity of relationships that you can draw on for sup-
port. Social support has to do with the quality of that support.
How big is your network? How many people in your life can you really count on? 
For Kim, the young man I highlight in the introduction to this chapter, his 
8-year-old son remains at the center of his life even though Kim is divorced 
from his son’s mom. Kim’s parents sometimes find fault with his modern way 
of life, but they continue to be proud of him for his many accomplishments. 
Kim is very close to his sister, even though they live far apart and have dis-
tinctly different personalities. And his girlfriend is the newest person in his 
life who gives his life some sort of meaning.
These five people form the basis of Kim’s meaningful social support network. 
They’re his safety net in trying times, his source of motivation and inspira-
tion, the sounding board he relies on when he’s faced with difficult decisions 
and the possibility of major life changes, and his primary source of self-
esteem. Kim belongs to these people — and, they belong to him.

199
 Chapter 16: Socialization versus Solitude
 
Thanks to the marvels of modern technology — e-mail, cellphones, 
text-messaging — you’re probably more connected than ever in terms of 
the sheer quantity of communications you get per day. But the actual number 
of close connections may be steadily declining. In 1985, one survey suggested 
that Americans had, on average, three close friends; by the year 2006, this 
number had dropped to only two. Even more striking was the fact that 
25 percent of those surveyed could not point to a single person they were 
close to. The size of the support network has also decreased, thanks to the 
shrinking size of American families.
Who’s in your network?
As people have become more mobile (moving away from their families of ori-
gin), more educated, more affluent, and more independent, the composition 
of their support networks has changed. Many people under 40, for example, 
may identify college friends and work associates as their most supportive 
relationships in place of siblings (due in part to the shrinking size of families) 
or even parents. Even fewer people would list neighbors as part of their net-
works. For more and more people, pets have become their significant others. 
And because more people postpone marriage well beyond their 20s or end up 
divorced, many of them can’t list a spouse as one of the people in their net-
work. Despite these changes, however, people can still have strong social 
networks and still get good support. As long as your network size is not 
“zero” and you have a meaningful relationship with those in your network, 
you’re in good shape. 
Where’s your support?
Some of your closest relationships may be with people who are far away geo-
graphically. Most of my best friends, for example, live in another state — the 
support they afford me is long-distance and not immediately available. My 
wife, on the other hand, has made many close friends right in our area. That 
makes a big difference — she doesn’t have to go far to enjoy an uplifting 
lunch (Chapter 13) with one of her girlfriends. Her support is much more 
accessible than mine is.
Are you receptive to support?
Not everyone takes advantage of the support that’s available to them — so it 
does them no good. If a close friend leaves a voicemail message asking how 
you are, call her back. If a family member offers to help you move, don’t tell 
him, “No, thanks — I can handle it.” If your lawyer gives you some good 
advice, take it.

Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Don’t be like Chris, a client of mine, who for years suffered from chronic back 
pain. Chris was a police officer and he lost his job after he was injured. His 
buddies tried to keep in contact with him — calling him frequently and com-
ing by his house to visit — but Chris made himself unavailable. He wouldn’t 
return their calls and he refused to go to the door when they came knocking. 
Chris was an angry man. And yet, all the while, he complained, “No one cares 
about me. No one gives a damn about me now that I can’t work.” His friends 
didn’t abandon him — he abandoned them.
What kind of support are you getting?
Support, according to sociologist James House at the University of Michigan, 
involves “a flow of one or more of four types of support between people.” 
These four types of support are
 
 Emotional support: You need to know that people are in your corner. 
You need to others to tell you, “I’m here for you no matter what.”
 
 Informational support: You need information, guidance, and advice 
about what to do or how to handle situations. People who can give you 
this kind of support include lawyers, clergy members, physicians, men-
tal health professionals, and accountants.
 
 Tangible support: This is the chicken-soup type of support. Tangible sup-
port includes things like a ride to the doctor’s office, a loan of money, help 
moving to another house, and watching your children so that you and 
your partner can enjoy a much needed night out on the town.
 
 Appraisal support: You need someone to give you honest, frank, con-
structive feedback about yourself — for example, that you never seem 
happy any more. This is not the type of support that typically comes 
from strangers or from acquaintances.
Giving tangible support when it’s needed most
People who’ve lost a loved one receive lots 
of emotional support (in the form of hugs and 
shared tears) and appraisal support (“You’re 
going to be okay. You’re a strong person.”). 
But what they get far too little of is tangible 
support — someone to take care of their kids 
while they make necessary arrangements or 
attend the funeral, someone to prepare meals 
that can be warmed up later and served to 
guests, someone to take care of pets, and 
someone to run routine errands.
If you know someone who’s recently lost 
someone she loves, try to provide this type of 
hands-on support. You’ll free up the bereaved 
person to do what’s most important — say 
goodbye to the person she loves.

 Chapter 16: Socialization versus Solitude
 
Take a minute and think about how connected you are to the world around 
you and how supportive those connections are. Then organize your thoughts 
similar to what you see in Table 16-1.

Misery loves company — and so does happiness
Emotions are contagious — and in some 
cases infectious. When you socialize, you 
may become a happier person or a less happy 
person. If the emotional tone of the group you’re 
interacting with is positive, you’re likely to feel 
positive yourself. If the reverse is true, you’re 
more likely to find yourself feeling negative — 
irritable, cynical, pessimistic.
I can best illustrate this point by telling you about 
two of the most memorable chronic pain rehab 
groups I conducted over a ten-year period. One 
I labeled the “Group from Hell”; the other, the 
“Black Angels”:
  The Group from Hell: This group consisted of 
four patients, all of whom had been injured 
at work, had lost their jobs, were in constant 
pain, and had not benefited from traditional 
medical or surgical remedies. All four were 
extremely negative — resentful and bitter 
about their circumstances, sarcastic, 
hostile, and highly resistant to my efforts to 
teach them how to cope with their pain in a 
way that left them less disabled. Every day, 
for four seemingly endless hours, they fed 
off each other’s unhappiness, reinforcing 
their pessimistic, hopeless view of the 
future. And every opportunity they got, they 
turned their collective anger toward me — 
which left me feeling equally dispirited.
  The Black Angels: This group was made 
up of three African American ladies who 
also were struggling with chronic pain, had 
been injured at work, and had lost their jobs. 
There was a marked contrast, however, in 
their attitudes and emotions from the very 
first day. All three came to the rehab facility 
with a smile on their faces and a warm, 
positive greeting. They left the same way 
four hours later. They laughed, encouraged 
each other during the fitness training, and 
generated an atmosphere of enthusiasm. 
They were eager to learn what we had to 
teach them and optimistic that rehab would, 
in the long run, ease their struggle with 
ongoing pain. And to show their gratitude, 
on graduation day they presented me with 
three wooden black angels, which they said 
would watch over me for the rest of my life. 
I was touched to the point of tears — and 
then we all had a group hug and they left, 
as always, smiling and laughing with each 
other.
Remember: Pain doesn’t make people un-
happy — people make themselves unhappy.

Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
When you’re finished with the exercise, ask yourself whether you have an ade-
quate support system. Is too much of your support long distance? Are you 
making use of the support that’s available to you? Would you be happier if you 
had more support? If you’re not receptive to those who want to support you, 
why not? If you’re lacking in support, what can you do to increase it?
The Benefits of Being Connected 
Being socially “connected” to the world around you benefits you in two major 
ways: It keeps you healthy and it makes life more fun.
My friend and former colleague, Dr. Redford Williams at Duke University Medical 
Center, published a landmark study in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association that looked at the importance of close personal relationships in 
determining one’s odds for surviving heart disease. He and his colleagues noted 
that heart patients who underwent coronary angiography were three times more 
likely to die from heart disease within the next five years if they were unmarried 
or could not identify a confidant — someone whom they could share their trou-
bles with. This striking difference in survival rates remained even when the 
investigators took into consideration the severity of heart disease suffered by 
each patient. Apparently, keeping unhappiness to yourself can be lethal!
 
You may find yourself at a point in life where you have no one to confide in — no 
one to talk to about the important things that are going on in your life, to assist 
you in overcoming obstacles, or to simply “give you a voice.” If this is the case, 
you need to begin reaching out — go where the people are and let them get to 
know you. Become a volunteer, find a hobby club to join, or show up the next 
time they have a young member’s event at your local art museum or Fine Arts 
Center. Remember: People don’t start out to be confidants — they start out just 
getting to know one another and things progress from there. If you’ve already 
tried that and still feel unconnected, I highly recommend filling that need 
through some type of counseling relationship — for example, with a mental 
health practitioner or a member of the clergy. Not only is there no shame in that; 
it’s the wise, smart and right thing to do!
The other major benefit that humans receive from being connected has to do 
with pleasure. Sigmund Freud once said that a happy, fulfilled life involves a 
balance of three things — work, sex, and play — all of which are meant to 
involve other people. Imagine spending your entire life playing by yourself!

203
 Chapter 16: Socialization versus Solitude
Working with pain clients, I learned that suffering — the emotional compo-
nent of the chronic pain syndrome — is not the result of the pain they experi-
ence, but rather the things they give up because of it. We’ve administered a 
disability questionnaire to our clients and time after time we find the first 
thing they give up as a result of pain is recreation — fun and games. 
Ironically, most of these individuals will continue doing routine household 
chores — mopping, sweeping, and vacuuming, all of which greatly aggravate 
pain — long after they’ve stopped socializing with family and friends. Part of 
the reasoning behind this has to do with the idea that pain and pleasure are 
incompatible — if you have one, you can’t have the other. Not true! The other 
reason is that in the American culture, people think that if you can’t work, 
then you don’t deserve to enjoy yourself. Again, not true!
Looking at the Importance of Solitude
You don’t need to talk most people into socializing — after all, humans are social 
animals. But solitude is another matter. Solitude runs counter to the demands of 
society, which depends on the efforts of all of us to contribute to the greater 
good. Taking time for yourself is often viewed as selfish and unproductive.
Solitude is also uncomfortable for many people because they’re learned to 
derive their self-esteem from activities initiated by their “other selves” — 
that is, their efforts to satisfy themselves by satisfying others. Your “other 
self” includes such roles as child, student, sibling, grandchild, Girl Scout, ath-
lete, employee, employer, church deacon, neighbor, and citizen. When you 
serve your “other self” you achieve some measure of happiness — true — but 
there are also important benefits that come from spending time with your 
“personal self,” that part of you that doesn’t need other people to be happy.
Support can save the fetus
In a study examining the relationship between 
stress and social support in pregnant women, 
researchers found that women experiencing 
“high stress” pregnancies were three times 
more likely (90 percent) to have babies born with 
complications — including miscarriage — if they 
also had little or no support from families and 
friends in the months preceding delivery than 
if they did have support available (30 percent). 
Bottom line: Making sure an expectant 
mother has an adequate amount of support — 
emotional, tangible, informational, appraisal — 
goes a long way towards insuring the healthy, 
normal development of their soon to be born 
child.

204
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
 Solitude allows your body to catch up with your mind. In this crazy 
aggressive existence that most people live in, we’re always tilting 
forward — our minds are way out in front of our bodies, thinking, ana-
lyzing, and planning ahead. Our bodies are just along for the ride. It’s 
only when you stop and get off the merry-go-round of daily life that your 
mind and body can once again get back into sync.
 
 Solitude allows your brain to rest. In a world of overstimulation, our 
minds are constantly in an overactive mode. Solitude allows your mind 
to detach from all the endless chatter coming from the environment 
around you — the radio, the Internet, conversations, street noise, traffic 
sounds, barking dogs — and rest for a change.
 
 Solitude jumpstarts the parasympathetic nervous system (the branch 
of the autonomic nervous system that calms you down). When you’re 
able to get some time to yourself, your muscles relax, your blood pres-
sure decreases, and your heart rate slows. Think of solitude as the anti-
adrenaline system that kicks on when there’s no longer a need for the 
fight-or-flight response.
 
 Solitude prevents burnout. Burnout is what happens when you’re sub-
jected to prolonged, intense, and unresolved stress. You run out of 
physical and psychological energy, and you act in a disorganized, ineffi-
cient, erratic manner.
 
 Solitude enhances creativity. Solitude frees the mind up from all the 
distractions of everyday life and allows it to focus more fully on one 
thing. It allows your brain to think outside the box and to come up with 
unique, extraordinary solutions to ordinary problems. That’s part of 
why artists — painters, sculptures, musicians, writers — spend so much 
time alone.
The difference between being lonely 
and being alone
Most people don’t understand the difference 
between being alone and being lonely. Being 
alone just means being by yourself, with no one 
else around. You can be alone in the shower, 
alone while driving, alone when you’re sleeping, 
and alone in your office at work. Being lonely, 
on the other hand, means that you’re absent 
from any emotional connection to the world 
around you — it’s as if the whole world in which 
you live is full of strangers. Some people feel 
lonely in a crowd, and some people who are 
completely alone don’t feel lonely at all.
One reason that many people avoid opportunities 
for solitude is that they equate solitude with 
loneliness. In fact, it’s only possible to enjoy 
solitude — time with yourself — if you’re 
emotionally tied to the social world around 
you.

205
 Chapter 16: Socialization versus Solitude
 
 
When you’re faced with a difficult problem — where there’s no easy 
solution — allow your brain to incubate. Incubation occurs when you 
step away from the problem, let it go for a while, and come back to it 
later. More often than not, the solution is readily apparent when you reen-
gage the problem. Why? Simple: While you’re off thinking about other 
things, your brain forgets about all those incorrect ideas you had before 
you walked away. In essence, incubation gives your brain a fresh start.
 
 Solitude can be a time of self-discovery. Solitude is your chance to 
learn something about yourself. Self-discovery is a process that involves 
asking and answering four basic questions:
 
• Who am I?
 
• What makes me unique?
 
• Where am I going in life?
 
• Am I comfortable with myself?
 
 
Self-discovery is something that can — and should — occur at each 
stage of life. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an 8-year-old child, a 
middle-aged woman, or an elderly man; the more you know about your-
self the happier you’ll be.
 
 Solitude allows you an opportunity to deal with the big questions in 
your life. At various times in your life, you’ll be faced with big questions 
like “Am I enjoying life the way I think I should given my current circum-
stances — job, finances, relationships?” and “I’ve been successful at this 
job for the past 15 years, but is this what I want to do for the rest of my 
working life?” It takes time and a lot of careful thought to come up with 
the answers. Such answers are more likely to come to mind in a quiet, 
introspective moment — solitude — than when you’re fully engaged in 
your usual day-to-day activities.
 
 A friend of mine, for example, was fortunate to be promoted to a top 
management position early in his academic career. By all accounts, he 
did a good job — managing to satisfy the demands of his superiors as 
well as the needs of his subordinates. But as time went on, he began to 
pay a price for his success. He developed a case of what psychologist 
Ad Appels, at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, calls vital 
exhaustion — excessive fatigue, increased irritability, difficulty sleeping, 
and feelings of demoralization.
 
 And then something interesting happened: He took a six-month sab-
batical and spent his time catching up on his sleep, taking his newborn 
daughter for long walks, reading, and enjoying solitude. Somewhere 
during that sabbatical, he began to think about whether he wanted to 
return to management or simply go back to being an ordinary profes-
sor. This question was not an insignificant one — it would determine his 
salary and his overall status within the university — but it was a ques-
tion that had never occurred to him before. After careful consideration, 
his answer was a resounding no. At the end of his sabbatical, he told his 

206
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
superiors what he had decided and they reluctantly agreed to let him 
step down. They weren’t happy — but he was!
 
 If you want to know if you’re suffering from vital exhaustion, ask yourself 
the following questions:
 
• Do you feel fresh and rested when you first wake up in the 
morning?
 
• Do you ever feel like a battery that’s losing its charge?
 
 If you answered no to the first question and yes to the second question, 
you’re definitely a candidate for vital exhaustion. This alone increases 
your chances of sudden cardiac death by 42 percent and, if combined 
with chronic anger, increases your chances by a whopping 69 percent. If 
this is the case, here are some options you should consider:
 
• Learn to control your anger better. (Anger Management For 
Dummies is a good place to start.)
 
• Cut back on smoking and alcohol use as these are highly corre-
lated with vital exhaustion.
 
• Take a few minutes to meditate each day (see Chapter 23).
 
• Read Chapter 8 and learn the 5-step method of getting into flow.
 
• Engage in an activity that is uplifting (Chapter 13) both in mind and 
body.
 
• Spend less time working and more time playing (Chapter 15).
 
• Start getting a good night’s sleep, exercise more, and eat a health-
ier diet (Chapter 23).
 
 Solitude provides an opportunity for perspective. When you’re caught 
up in the hassles (see Chapter 13) of day-to-day life, all you can see is 
what’s directly in front of you — the problem of the moment. If you want 
to see and appreciate the big picture of what your life’s all about, you 
have to step back and get a bird’s-eye view — and that’s exactly what 
solitude allows you to do.
Solitude = sanctuary
Traditionally, the term sanctuary has referred 
to a place of refuge and safety where a 
person can escape impending danger and be 
protected. Think of solitude as your source of 
spiritual, emotional, and mental sanctuary. It’s a 
safe harbor in an otherwise stormy sea. It’s the 
eye of the hurricane — where it’s calm and the 
winds don’t blow. It’s a place where you don’t 
have to be on the defensive and where there is 
absolutely no need for a fight-or-flight response. 
Solitude affords serenity — one of the many 
elements of happiness (see Chapter 2).

W
hat does Gordon Gekko, the villainous corporate tycoon played by 
Michael Douglas in the movie Wall Street, see as the secret to happi-
ness? Greed, of course. Greed — the ultimate act of selfishness — separates 
winners from losers, as Gekko sees it, and nobody in his right mind wants 
to be a loser. Greed produces wealth. Greed insures that you’ll always have 
more than you need — whether you’re talking about money, food, toys, or 
square footage. Greed seeks to satisfy self-interest only.
Psychologists Elizabeth Dun (of the University of British Columbia) and 
Michael Norton (of the Harvard Business School) have a much different take 
on happiness. Their research suggests just the opposite — namely, that by 
being generous and giving away money to others, whether they need it or 
not, people experience happiness. Their findings indicated that an individu-
al’s reported level of happiness is not correlated with how much money she 
spends, but rather on who she spends it on. Giving away as little as $5 a day 
creates a sense of joy and satisfaction at day’s end. Unlike greed, generosity 
only seeks to satisfy the interests of others.
So, who’s right? If your goal is to be happy, should you be selfish or gener-
ous? The answer: Both. You need to balance the two.
As I emphasize throughout this part, happiness is found somewhere in the 
middle of life’s extremes — somewhere between work and play (Chapter 15), 
socialization and solitude (Chapter 16), and so on. In this chapter, I show 
you how to move away from unhealthy selfishness on the one end and pride-
ful selflessness on the other. I remind you what it really means to be a good 
scout and why giving for the wrong reasons only leads to unhappiness. And, 

208
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
last, I tie all this to the issue of personal energy and offer some suggestions 
for how to revitalize your life.
Healthy Selfishness
Most people think the term healthy selfishness is an oxymoron. You may have 
been taught that it’s bad to be selfish. And you may have been taught that’s it’s 
better to be selfless — to always put others before yourself. Martyrs (people who 
sacrifice their lives for their fellow men) are the extreme example of selflessness 
and many people believe that martyrdom is the surest route to sainthood.
But consider this: Everything that you do everyday that contributes to your 
survival is an act of selfishness. The act of eating is selfish — but if you didn’t 
eat, you’d die. The same goes for drinking — severe dehydration leads to 
death. Sexual activity, even if it’s purely for the purpose of procreation is 
selfish — you’re having sex because you want children. Working is a selfish 
act — you want to earn money to spend on necessities and luxuries.
The distinction between healthy selfishness and unhealthy selfishness lies not 
in the act itself but in its consequences. Here are some examples of healthy 
selfishness:
 
 Catching up on your sleep when you’re exhausted.
 
 Participating regularly in religious services to satisfy your spiritual needs.
 
 Exercising several hours a week at your favorite gym.
 
 Having two drinks of alcohol per day — according to scientists, it 
relieves stress.
 
 Buying yourself a bouquet of flowers to brighten up your office.
 
 Lingering in bed for a couple of extra minutes every morning.
 
 Being honest because you know how burdensome life can be when it’s 
full of lies (see Chapter 7).
And here are some examples of unhealthy selfishness:
 
 Overeating to the point of obesity — it endangers your health and short-
ens your life.
 
 Smoking cigarettes — they’re a leading cause of cancer and heart disease.
 
 Unloading your anger on a family member just because it feels good.
 
 Drinking to excess.
 
 Refusing to wear a condom when you have sex.

209
 Chapter 17: Selfishness versus Generosity
 
 Blaming a coworker for a mistake you made.
 
 Always beating your kids at games just because you can.
Putting the “I” back in identity
There is such a thing as being too generous — giving too much of yourself, 
spreading yourself too thin.
Susie was that type of person. She spent every hour of her waking day 
anticipating and satisfying the needs of her husband, her two children, her 
elderly parents, her in-laws, her co-workers, and her neighbors. Meanwhile, 
she totally neglected her own needs. Susie told me once that she waited for 
the rest of her family to order in a restaurant and then — because she was 
responsible for the family budget — she always chose the least expensive 
thing on the menu for herself. “I want them to have whatever they want; I can 
eat anything,” she said. It was only after her divorce from her husband of 30 
years that she began to cook things she liked instead of always catering to 
her family’s appetites.
Is Susie an exception? No, there are millions of Susies out there, people 
whose identity, whose sense of self, is inextricably tied to the needs and 
wants of other people. They’re too generous with their time, too generous 
with their money, and too generous with their energy. They only think of 
others and never of themselves — and, mistakenly, they think this will make 
them happy.
There’s no “I” in you. If someone asks you about yourself, do you say, “I’m 
Juan’s mother,” “I’m Dr. Williams’s wife,” or “I’m Kate Bishop’s boss”? If 
so, then the way you think about yourself has more to do with these other 
people than it does about you. And the way you think about yourself has a 
whole lot to do with how happy you are (see Chapter 1). Susie was a good 
wife and mother — her family would attest to that — but she certainly wasn’t 
a happy woman.
 
Make today the day you begin putting the “I” back into your own identity. Start 
by honestly answering the following questions without any reference to your 
spouse, children, family members, or anyone else.
 
 What do I want to do on my day off?
 
 Where do I want to go on vacation?
 
 Who do I want to have lunch with this weekend?
 
 What book do I want to buy for myself today?
 
 What new hairstyle do I want?

210
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
 
 Who do I want to vote for?
 
 What kind of car do I want?
 
 Would I rather take a nap this afternoon or mow the lawn?
 
Everyone else around you, whose needs you’ve spent all your time satisfying, 
may not like it when you suddenly start putting some “I” back into your 
identity — and back into your daily schedule of activities. They’ve obviously 
had a good thing going and they’re not all that eager to have things changed. 
You’ll likely experience some resistance, but you need to persist anyway. 
They’ll get used to the new you — it may just take some time.
Being a good scout
Healthy selfishness is synonymous with being a good scout. The Boy Scout 
oath not only says that you’ll do your best to fulfill your duty to God and 
country and help other people at all times, it says you’ll keep yourself physi-
cally, mentally, and morally straight. Being a good scout, in short, means 
finding a balance between serving your own needs and serving the needs of 
others. Most people think scouting is just about skills — like cooking on an 
open campfire, learning life-saving techniques, or finding your way out of the 
forest when you’re lost — but it’s really more about preparing young people 
for a lifetime of happiness.
If your parent was an alcoholic
Unfortunately, like millions of other people, I 
was raised in an alcoholic home. And, like so 
many children of alcoholics, I learned at a very 
early age to care for others — my drunken 
father as well as those who suffered because 
of his drinking. I was forced to grow up too fast, 
skipping over much of my childhood and ado-
lescence, and adopting adult roles and behav-
iors way before I reached my adult years.
Someone asked me once how it was that I 
was able to assume a high-level manage-
ment role in a large institution before I was 30 
years old. “Simple,” I said. “When I was 15 years 
old — after my father walked out and abandoned 
us — I had to take care of three small children 
as if they were my own and run a household 
while my mother went to work. I already had 
15 years of management experience before I 
took over as head of medical psychology. And, 
believe me, compared to that, this job is easy!”
All children of alcoholics have psychologi-
cal “issues,” whether they realize it or not. If 
you’re the son or daughter of an alcoholic, even 
if you’ve been out of the house for years, do not 
under-estimate the legacy of alcoholism but do 
not be discouraged either. Other events and 
circumstances in life — as well as relationships 
with healthy folks outside the family — can help 
you grow and develop into a healthy personal-
ity. Support groups like Al-Anon (and Alateen 
for younger members) can offer a source of real 
hope, as can more traditional counseling rela-
tionships with mental health professionals. 

211
 Chapter 17: Selfishness versus Generosity
 
Take the scout pledge today and honor it every day for the rest of your life. It 
says, “On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country 
and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself 
physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.” What better formula 
for achieving happiness?
Taking time for yourself
Think about how you spend your time each day. If you’re getting 8 hours of 
sleep every night, that leaves 16 waking hours. Figure out how many of those 
hours you spend in the service of others (working, running errands, attend-
ing meetings, chauffeuring kids around town, cleaning house, paying bills, 
mowing the lawn) and how many hours you spend purely on yourself (read-
ing the newspaper, taking a nap, soaking in a hot tub, meditating, browsing 
Renewed and redirected energy
Call it exhaustion, call it fatigue, call it 
burnout — it all amounts to the same thing: 
Your body is short on energy. As I point out in 
Chapter 4, it takes energy to generate emotions 
like anger and joy. And it also takes energy to 
do those things that are essential to achieving a 
state of happiness. Without energy, you simply 
can’t be happy.
So, if you feel like a battery that’s losing its 
power, where do you get more energy? You 
get it from redirecting your energy away from 
activities that only serve the needs of others 
and instead toward those pursuits that reener-
gize and revitalize you.
Instead of spending your entire morning picking 
up your teenager’s clothes from her bedroom 
floor, why not take a walk around the neigh-
borhood and enjoy the sun on your shoulders? 
Instead of staying late at the office to catch 
up on other people’s work, why not leave at 
5 p.m. and meet an old friend to catch up on 
what’s happening in his life? Instead of running 
errands and crossing things off your to-do list 
seven nights a week, why not spend a night 
or two at home just hanging out with your 
kids? Instead of going to the office on Sunday 
morning to get a jump on the coming week, why 
not go to church and reconnect with your spiri-
tual side?
Some things in life take energy and other 
things create energy. Regular exercise creates 
energy — it leaves you feeling refreshed and 
renewed. A good night’s sleep does the same 
thing. Laughing creates positive energy. Hugs 
create an infusion of energy both for the hugger 
and the person being hugged. These are all 
activities that fall under the heading of healthy 
selfishness.
Here’s an exercise I use with my clients when 
we’re talking about what you have to do to make 
meaningful changes in your life:
 1. Stand next to a wall in your home or office 
and put your right hand on the wall.
 2. Now try to reach the opposite wall with 
your left hand.
 
 You’ll find that, try as you might, you simply 
can’t do it — unless you let go with your 
right hand. The message: Sometimes, in 
order to get where you want to go, you have 
to let go of something else.

212
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
through your favorite bookstore). If you’re like most people, the number of 
hours you spend on yourself is much smaller than the number you spend on 
others. In fact, given today’s busy world, I’d be surprised if the time you take 
for yourself amounts to more than two hours per day.
Here’s the question I want you to ask yourself: “Am I short-changing myself 
when it comes to how I allocate my time?” If you spend less than one hour a 
day addressing your own selfish needs, wants, interests, you are.
If you’re employed, how valuable is the time you spend servicing the needs of 
others? (Figure out your hourly rate at work.) Now, ask yourself: “How valu-
able is the time I spend with and on myself?” Is it worth the same as what you 
get paid to work for others? Worth more? Or worth less? Put a real value on 
it in terms of dollars and cents. Your answer speaks to how much self-worth 
you have. If you feel like the time you take for yourself is of little value, you 
won’t “waste” your time on yourself. On the other hand, if you see time spent 
on yourself as valuable, you’ll find the time for you. It’s as simple as that!
Too Much of a Good Thing: 
Generosity Gone Awry
Being overly generous can be unhealthy. The trick is to be generous without 
doing so at your own expense. A parent who takes from his hard-earned 
retirement savings to bail out his college-age kid who habitually runs up 
credit card debt and gets in trouble with the law is an example of generos-
ity gone awry. Although this kind of behavior may be well-intentioned, it 
invariably leads to feelings of resentment, outright anger, and strained rela-
tionships with loved ones. Being supportive is one thing — enabling bad 
behavior through misguided generosity is another.
It’s not the thought that counts
When you forget your wedding anniversary 
and use the excuse that you meant to get your 
spouse something, but your week just got away 
from you, don’t believe her when she utters that 
all-too-familiar phrase, “That’s okay, dear — 
it’s the thought that counts.” In the real world, 
intentions don’t count — only actions do. Even 
if your wife puts on a happy face (see Chapter 
12), you can bet your last dollar that it’s not the 
real deal — she isn’t a happy camper!
Everyone is full of good and generous inten-
tions. We think about reaching out to others 
in need, we fantasize about what we would do 
and how good we would feel afterward — but 
unless these thoughts reach the point of action, 
they never do us or anyone else any good.

213
 Chapter 17: Selfishness versus Generosity
 
If you’re not sure whether you’re engaging in excessive, unhealthy generos-
ity, ask yourself this basic question: “Can I afford to give this much money, 
energy, and/or time to this person without being unfair to myself?” If the 
answer is yes, go ahead. If the honest answer is no, don’t. You’ll have less 
regret later on.
When my daughter was very young, I used to read lots of children’s books 
to her. One of our favorites was a story about a little girl who collected dolls 
from many lands. Page by page, the book depicted dolls from different coun-
tries around the world — Italy, France, Holland, China — in native costumes. 
The child and her mother put each doll she collected in her bed until the bed 
was full. Then the child suddenly got an unhappy look on her face and said, 
“But, mommy, there’s no room for me!” Remember: You need to leave room 
in your life for yourself.
Giving the Right Way
If you act generously to others, shouldn’t you experience the “joy of giving”? 
It depends. If there is a positive motive behind your generosity — for exam-
ple, compassion — the answer is “yes”. If, on the other hand, your generosity 
is motivated by a sense of obligation on your part or a need to control others, 
then the answer is decidedly “no”. In other words, there’s a right way to give 
and a wrong way — one way leads to happiness, the other does not. 
The saga of the totem pole
A married woman in her mid-50s whom I had 
been treating for depression came into my 
office early one morning in an unusual state of 
distress. I could tell right away that something 
had upset her so much that she couldn’t control 
herself. She was tearful, shaking, and had an 
incredibly unhappy expression on her face. She 
said, “I had the most awful dream last night. I 
woke up shaking all over and my heart was 
pounding — I thought I was going to have a 
heart attack. And I’ve been crying ever since.”
I asked her to recount the dream and she 
said, “You know what a totem pole is, right? 
It’s a series of carvings on a pole that Native 
Americans use to tell a person’s life story — 
the highlights of what that person’s life was all 
about. Well, I found myself standing there look-
ing at my own totem pole. There was a carving 
of my husband, my daughter, my mother, my 
mother-in-law, my sister — all the people in 
my life. And suddenly I realized that one person 
was missing from my totem pole, and that was 
me. I wasn’t on my own totem pole. Here I am 
over 50 years old and I’m not a part of my own 
life.”
One day when you look at your totem pole, what 
will you see? Will you be on there somewhere 
or will you be like this nice, albeit sad, lady and 
realize that you’ve never had a real, loving, 
generous relationship with the one person who 
matters the most — you?

214
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
Giving only because you want to
If you’re going to be generous, make sure it’s for the right reason. Doing for 
others because you feel you have to rather than because you want to will not 
make you happy.
Too many people go through life acting on the principle of reciprocity — you 
scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours. If someone does you a good deed, 
you feel obligated to respond in kind. In other words, you’re engaging in 
what I call reactive generosity. If you’re only giving to people because you feel 
like you owe them (they had you over for dinner last month, so you feel you 
should have them over for dinner this month), it’ll be obvious to everyone 
involved. Why? Because you won’t enjoy the giving — you’ll feel resentful, 
and that resentment will come out in your behavior.
 
Stick to giving because you want to, and you’ll never go wrong.
Giving without control
How many times have you heard someone say, “After all I’ve done for you, 
I can’t believe you would act this way”? What that person is saying is, “I’m 
frustrated because I feel like my generosity hasn’t been rewarded.”
When you give, you need to give without strings attached — you need to be 
generous without any expectation of reciprocity or payback. True gifts are 
one-way transactions. They aren’t made out of a sense of obligation, nor do 
they obligate the recipient.
The generosity hormone
Researchers at Claremont Graduate University 
in California have found a link between the hor-
mone oxytocin and generosity. In their experi-
ments, subjects injected with oxytocin tended 
to be more willing to help out a stranger mone-
tarily than those who were not given oxytocin.
Oxytocin is released by the brain in social situa-
tions and appears to be the driving force behind 
our efforts to reach out and help others. The 
researchers also noted that oxytocin was more 
likely to be produced in situations where people 
feel nurtured and safe, and where others act 
toward you in a loving way — for example, 
when they give you a hug or a kiss.

215
 Chapter 17: Selfishness versus Generosity
Codependency: The ultimate form of control
I define codependency as a habitual, compul-
sive need to control the behavior of others as 
a means of feeling satisfied with and about 
yourself. To put it more simply, a codependent 
person can’t be happy unless he’s controlling 
other people. The codependent mother, for 
example, can’t be happy unless her son lives 
the way she wants him to live. The codependent 
husband can only be happy if his wife acts in 
ways he approves of. The codependent sister is 
happy only so long as her siblings do the “right” 
thing (as defined by her) and she’s resentful 
when they don’t.
Eddie and his mom, Joan, had a real problem. 
Eddie was trying too hard to be the dutiful son 
and Joan was trying too hard to be the good 
mother. They were driving each other nuts! 
To hear Joan tell it, “Every time I turn around, 
Eddie is dropping by and wanting me to go to 
lunch or something. Then I have to drop what 
I’m going to do with my friends and keep him 
company.” She would never tell Eddie this, 
because it would hurt his feelings, but this is 
how she feels.
To hear Eddie tell it, “She’s just an ungrateful 
witch. I try to do the right thing by checking in 
on her now and then, and all I get back is an 
ugly attitude.” He would never tell his mom this 
because it would hurt her feelings, but this is 
how he feels.
Neither apparently can be happy unless they go 
out of their way to satisfy what they perceive to 
be the needs of the other. So, what’s the solu-
tion to the problem? Eddie needs to learn that 
he can be a good son without constantly drop-
ping by his mother’s place unannounced. Joan, 
on the other hand, needs to learn that she’s not 
making herself or Eddie happy by going some-
where she doesn’t want to go and then pouting 
the whole time.
When Eddie gets this compulsive urge to be 
the good son, he needs to say to himself, “No, 
not today!” And when Joan feels a similar urge 
to drop what she’d planned to do today for her 
baby boy, she needs to say, “Sorry, honey, but 
I have other plans!” If and when they can both 
do these things, they can start enjoying one 
another for a change.
Here are some characteristics of a codepen-
dent personality:
  You find yourself saying “yes” when you 
really mean “no.”
  You routinely over-commit yourself.
  You expect yourself to do things perfectly.
  You feel like a victim much of the time.
  You wonder why you never have any 
energy.
  You rarely say what you feel.
  You find it difficult to have fun and be spon-
taneous.
  You have trouble standing up for your 
rights.
  You take things personally.
  You feel unloved even by your loved ones.
Remember: As far as science knows, there is no 
genetic basis for codependency. It is a learned 
style of relating to others — in essence, a bad 
habit — that can be unlearned.

216
Part IV: Striking the Right Balance 
You may not think you’re doing for others as a way of controlling their 
behavior, but you may be doing exactly that. If you give someone a gift of 
money — not a loan but a gift — do you get upset if she spends it unwisely? 
Can you hear yourself saying, “If I’d known you were going to spend the 
money on that, I wouldn’t have given it to you in the first place.” Does it irri-
tate you if you’re generous to someone and he doesn’t say “thank you”? Do 
you say things like, “That’s the least he could do after I went out of my way to 
be helpful”?
The best gift of all
Someone once said to me “You only truly give 
when you give of yourself” and I believe that’s 
true. I also believe that it’s that type of gift — 
one that is personal and unique — that makes 
us the happiest. I’m a writer, so writing this book 
is my gift to myself. I’m also a counselor and 
teacher, so every time I have an opportunity to 
reach out and comfort a friend who is suffering 
or educate some audience, I do so without hesi-
tation. These are the gifts that create our legacy 
and the spirit we leave behind.

Part V
Achieving 
Happiness in Key 
Relationships

In this part . . .
I
f you’re like me, you look for happiness in three types 
of key relationships: work, family, and with your signifi-
cant other.
Is your workplace a battleground, where co-workers never 
say “please” and “thank you,” but are quick to act out 
their hostilities toward each other? Did you know that the 
emotional climate of the workplace determines whether 
employees flounder or flourish at their respective jobs? In 
this part, I show you how to handle anger constructively 
so that you and others don’t leave work everyday feeling 
resentful and drained.
Would you like to actually enjoy being at home with your 
family? Simply sharing one meal a day with the entire fam-
ily can go a long way toward insuring that the rest of your 
family is happy to see you when you walk through the 
door at the end of the day. In this part, I provide other 
strategies for achieving happiness as a family.
And would you like to know which three elements make 
for a happy relationship and what positive psychology 
tells us about the benefits of “tending and befriending” 
those we love? In this part, I fill you in on that and more 
when it comes to intimate relationships.

 Establishing healthy boundaries
 Seeking win-win solutions
 Handling anger constructively
 Counteracting counterproductive work behavior
E
very Monday morning, it’s the same thing: Theresa dreads going to 
work. For her, work is the place where she is the most unhappy. Her 
immediate supervisor is a tyrant, screaming about the smallest mistake and 
treating Theresa and her coworkers with contempt. The days seem long and 
she’s always on guard, never knowing when the next eruption will occur. 
Theresa came to this job four years ago, a happy person with a laid-back, 
fun-loving, outgoing personality. Now, she’s quiet, introspective, serious, and 
cynical — she sees no hope for things changing for the better as long as she 
remains in this job.
Theresa’s behavior at work is also changing. She regularly comes to work late 
and often leaves early if her boss isn’t around. She’s started snapping at her 
fellow employees and, from time to time, engaging in malicious office gossip. 
Theresa knows that her behavior is wrong, but she’s so angry about how 
things are that she acts that way anyway.
 
Theresa has become a victim of what Dr. Paul Spector at the University of 
South Florida calls counterproductive work behavior. Counterproductive work 
behavior involves a pattern of negative, aggressive acts — directed at the 
organization or its employees — that is inevitable when working people get 
too angry and unhappy.
In this chapter, I help you understand why you may be unhappy at work and 
what you can do about it. The focus of this chapter is positive — positive 
ways to cope with anger, positive exchanges you can have with cowork-
ers, and positive strategies for conflict management. I also tell you how to 
calculate your workplace positivity ratio, which has an awful lot to do with 
whether you flounder or flourish at your work.

Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Calculating Your Workplace 
Positivity Ratio
A leader in the field of positive psychology, Dr. Barbara Fredrickson of the 
University of Michigan, says that employees tend to flourish (thrive, prosper, 
achieve success) or languish (finding yourself in a rut, going nowhere, and 
feeling unhappy) in large part depending on the positivity ratio of the setting 
in which you work. If the positivity ratio — that’s your positive emotions 
divided by your negative emotions — is approximately 3.0 or higher, you’re 
likely to flourish; if it’s less than 3.0, odds are that you’ll find yourself floun-
dering and unhappy.
 
Find a quiet time and place, maybe at the end of the day, to review Table 18-1. 
Circle ten emotions that you observed in yourself and your fellow employees 
today. Don’t focus on which column you’re choosing emotions from — just 
choose ten emotions.

number of words in the “Negative Emotions” column, and that gives you your 
workplace PR. You want your number to be 3 or above.
 
You can change your workplace positivity ratio by being more positive at 
work yourself. In the remainder of this chapter, I give you strategies for doing 
exactly that.

 Chapter 18: At Work
Loving What You Do
Sandra has been a school teacher for 30 years. When she started in the early 
1970s, teaching was relatively easy — children respected their teachers and 
did what they were told. Having kids stay on task — for example, learning 
multiplication tables or how to diagram a sentence — wasn’t all that difficult. 
The pay wasn’t great but, as far as society was concerned, teaching was clas-
sified as a “high-value” occupation. That isn’t  the case anymore! Sandra has 
to struggle with the kids every school day, from start to finish, all in an effort 
to educate them. The kids show her little respect; they often don’t comply 
with simple requests; and, there are constant disruptions.
Making Mom proud: Saying 
“please” and “thank you”
Almost every morning, Phil eats breakfast at 
a local restaurant, a small, quiet place mostly 
frequented by regulars like himself. It’s the type 
of place where the waitresses place your order 
without even asking you what you want — they 
know your order because they know you! Phil 
says, “I love this place because it’s so friendly 
and every one here seems to be in a good mood. 
A great place to start my day!”
During the 20 or so minutes Phil is there, he 
says “thank you” an average of five to six times. 
Given the fact that he eats there roughly 350 
days a year, that comes to a total of between 
1,750 and 2,100 thank-you’s per year. Boy, 
would that make Phil’s mom proud! As he 
explains, “She instilled in me the importance of 
being courteous, friendly, and civil with other 
people. She also taught me to say, ‘Yes, ma’am’ 
and ‘No, sir’ to adults.”
“Sure, I’m courteous at restaurants,” you’re 
thinking. “But what does this have to do with the 
workplace?” Simple. The word please is what 
you say before making a request as opposed to 
a demand — and people don’t typically respond 
well to demands. Demands brings out the aggres-
sive sides of our personalities — both overtly 
aggressive and passive-aggressive — which, 
in turn, leads to further problems. Similarly, the 
term thank you conveys an appreciation and 
respect for the other person and what he’s 
doing to make your job easier. If you don’t 
say “thank you,” the implication is that you’re 
not appreciative, and everybody likes to feel 
appreciated.
Start making a habit of saying “please” and 
“thank you” to everyone you encounter at 
work — from the janitor to the CEO. Make a spe-
cial effort to use these terms with the cowork-
ers you have the most difficulty dealing with. 
Who knows? Maybe this will be the beginning 
of new and happier relationships with those 
people. It’s worth a shot!

So, how is it that at age 57 Sandra continues to love teaching? According to 
Sandra, “I suppose a lot of it has to do with the fact that I really believe these 
are good kids and it’s not their fault that they’re hard to control — a lot of it 
has to do with how they’re raised. And, you know, I’m actually a pretty good 
teacher — I should be after 30 years! I guess I just love what I do — simple as 
that.”
Peter, on the other hand, doesn’t love what he does for a living — or, he 
wouldn’t have been sitting in my office once a week complaining about being 
unhappy. Peter is a high-priced architect and a senior partner in a major firm. 
He’s so accomplished at what he does that he enjoys the respect of his peers 
in the community and has amassed a considerable amount of wealth as a 
result of his labors.
So, why is Peter unhappy? All it took was asking a few key questions to figure 
that one out: Peter had been succeeding at a career that wasn’t of his choos-
ing. All the men in Peter’s family going back four generations were architects 
and, like it or not, that was his destiny. What Peter really wanted to be was 
a big league baseball player — which was not completely fanciful given his 
natural athletic abilities and his love of baseball throughout his school years. 
But his family reasoned that there was too much uncertainty associated with 
a sports career (not all good ball players make it) and, in their opinion, it 
wasn’t a serious, respectable profession. Peter was outnumbered, so he gave 
in and that was the beginning of a lifetime of unhappiness at work.
 
Do you love your work? If not, consider the following:
 
 Don’t think of your job as an all-or-nothing thing. Break it down into its 
various components — meetings, sales, dealing with subordinates — and 
focus on those activities that you enjoy most. That’s where you should be 
spending most of your time.
 
 Think of your work relative to the other aspects of your lifestyle. One 
reason that Sandra enjoyed her work was that it provided escape from 
major stresses in her home and family life. As she said, “It’s a refuge 
from all that other stuff that I just don’t want to deal with right now.”
 
 Consider the alternatives — if you weren’t doing this, what would you 
be doing? Believe it or not, no matter how much you dislike your job, 
there’s always something worse out there!
 
 Try to assign meaning to your work that goes beyond the routine aspects 
of your job description. All companies have a mission statement — find out 
what yours is and be part of that mission.
 
 Get those parts of your job that you don’t love behind you early in the 
day. From there on out, it’s all downhill.

223
 Chapter 18: At Work
 
 Make a conscious effort to increase the positivity ratio in your work-
place (see “Calculating Your Workplace Positivity Ratio,” earlier in 
this chapter).
 
 Act as though you love what you do, even if you don’t. That’s right, 
fake it! In Chapter 12, I tell you how you how you can empower yourself 
by putting a smile on your face.
 
 Find a compatriot, a fellow traveler as you journey through the work 
day, preferably someone who loves her work more than you do. Who 
knows? Maybe her optimism and enthusiasm will prove contagious.
 
 Start looking for a new job if you’ve tried everything you can think 
of to be happy at work and nothing works.  Be optimistic (Chapter 5) 
and tell yourself that there’s a job out there somewhere that suits you 
better.
Establishing Healthy Boundaries
One of the keys to happiness in the workplace is for employees to find the 
right balance between structure and freedom. Structure involves those 
formal and informal rules or codes of conduct that govern how you behave 
at work. More important, structure imposes certain boundaries within which 
you’re expected to freely operate — boundaries that are not to be crossed.
Crossing the line
Back in my academic years, I was once a 
member of a very powerful tenure and promo-
tions committee, which, in effect, determined 
whether faculty progressed and prospered 
in their careers. In one meeting, I made a 
favorable recommendation about one of 
the psychologists under my charge, which 
was subsequently denied by the department 
chairman — my boss.
Without thinking, I vehemently exclaimed, “I 
don’t think that’s fair not to promote this man!” 
The chairman replied, without raising his voice 
but clearly unhappy, “What does fairness have 
to do with anything?” I looked around the room 
for support, but the other committee members 
were all looking at their shoes. This wasn’t their 
fight. “Nothing, I guess,” I said rather meekly.
After the meeting was over, the chairman asked 
if I would stay for a minute. He closed the door, 
sat down across from me, smiled, and said in a 
quiet, but firm tone, “Doyle, I think maybe you’re 
confused about something. You’re a bright 
young man and I value your input on this com-
mittee. But your job is only to make recommen-
dations; my job is to make decisions. If I choose 
to support your recommendation, I’m sure that 
makes you happy — it should. But if I choose 
not to follow your recommendation, I don’t 
expect to hear about it. Do you understand, or 
are you still confused?
I had crossed a boundary without realizing it. I 
did it that once, but never again.

224
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Here’s a list of boundaries having to do with power, civility, and intimacy that 
you probably don’t want to cross if you hope to be happy at work:
 
 Don’t tell your supervisor that she is incompetent.
 
 Never take it for granted that you’ll get a raise.
 
 Don’t engage in gossip about fellow employees.
 
 Don’t roll your eyes or otherwise act with contempt when someone is 
giving you constructive feedback about your job performance.
 
 Don’t mistake friendly for flirtatious.
 
 Never develop intimate relationships with others with or for whom you 
work — it’s not only risky, it’s often against company policy.
 
 Don’t goof off just because the boss is away.
 
 Don’t treat you coworkers with less respect than you do your family.
 
 Never view those with whom you work as the enemy.
 
 Support is okay, but don’t invite co-workers to be therapists.
And, here’s a list of healthy boundaries that go a long way toward insuring 
greater productivity and a sense of well-being in the workplace:
 
 Always say “please” and “thank you” when interacting with superiors 
and co-workers.
 
 Be personable, but not too personal at work. Your fellow employees 
don’t need to know everything there is to know about your life.
 
 Always remember that even a bad boss is still a boss. Treat him as such.
 
 Where possible, confine work to the workplace — off-site, after-hours 
socializing is rarely about work.
 
 Treat a one-time kindness as a gift, not a precedent.
 
 If you get paid for eight hours, work eight hours.
 
 Reach out to coworkers in need without intruding in their lives.
Avoiding Toxic Coworkers
Negativity in the workplace is like a virus — sooner or later, it infects every-
one. In this section, I cover the main types of toxic workers, and give you tips 
for dealing with them.

 Chapter 18: At Work
The stress carriers
Ever work with someone who, when she enters the room, seems to instantly 
create chaos? Before she walked in, people were working away, productive, 
and in a good mood — but not anymore. Suddenly, tension permeates the air 
and all the good will between the employees evaporates. What was once a 
happy work place is no longer. Welcome to the world of the stress carrier.
Here are some ways to identify a stress carrier:
 
 A rapid, loud, or pressured tone of voice
 
 An aggressive body posture (for example, hand waving or finger pointing) 
 
 A defensive body posture (for example, arms crossed in front of chest)
 
 A tendency to talk over other people in a conversation
 
 Fixed, angry opinions
 
 Use of obscenities
 
 A tense facial expression (a frown or clenched jaw)
 
 A jarring laugh
 
 Head nodding
 
 Finger tapping
 
 A tendency to hurry up the speech of others by interjecting comments 
such as “Uh-huh,” “Right,” and “I know”
 
If you can avoid stress carriers, by all means do so.. Their unhappiness is 
contagious. If you’re around them very much, you’ll end up feeling stressed 
and out of sorts yourself.  But, if you can’t, inoculate yourself with thoughts 
like “I’m not going to let her ruin my mood,” “I can handle this — it’s not like 
I haven’t had to deal with her before,” and “This too shall pass!”  This’ll work 
the same as getting a flu or smallpox inoculation.  Remember:  People can 
only get to you if you let them.  (For more detail about Stress Inoculation 
Training, check out Anger Management For Dummies.)
 
Is it possible that you could be a stress carrier yourself? Check out the list in 
this section and see if you have any of those stress-carrier characteristics. 
Better yet, ask someone you work with who knows you well to examine the 
list and tell you what she thinks. Be careful, though: You may not like what 
she says.

The naysayers
Fred was the chief financial officer (CFO) of a large corporation that was 
undergoing drastic changes. The chief executive officer (CEO) had abruptly 
resigned, leaving the institution with significant financial and morale prob-
lems. Everywhere you turned, there was an air of uncertainty among those 
employees who remained. No one was happy.
An acting CEO had been named, whose job it was to carry the institution 
through this crisis — and she needed the cooperation of Fred and other 
members of senior management to make this happen. However, Fred was a 
naysayer, the type of person who always has a negative comment, refuses to 
consider the merits of other people’s suggestions, and balks at any attempt 
to change things.
The acting CEO had strongly admonished Fred on several occasions about 
always being so negative. But Fred persisted, until one day, right in the 
middle of a meeting, the CEO had heard enough. She abruptly halted the 
meeting, telling everyone else except Fred that they were excused. Two 
hours later, all the senior staff were called to another emergency meeting, 
at which time the CEO matter-of-factly advised them that Fred had decided 
to resign immediately and would be leaving by the end of the workday. 
Everyone was stunned, but not surprised — except maybe Fred.
 
Would you hang around someone at work who was sick with a cold — cough-
ing, sneezing, wiping his runny nose? I bet you’d stay as far away from him 
as possible to preserve your health, right? And you wouldn’t feel guilty about 
doing so either. Well, that’s exactly what you should do when you run into a 
naysayer.  However, if it’s impossible to avoid that person, counter his nega-
tives with some positives of your own — in other words you be a yeasayer.  
For example, you could say “Fred, I understand that you are concerned about 
what’s in our future, I am too.  But, I prefer to look at this as a time of opportu-
nity rather than a catastrophe (see Chapter 6 which deals with hardiness).”
 
No matter how high you are on the organizational chart, no one likes a nay-
sayer. If you’re the type of person who can offer both criticism and positive 
suggestions, don’t worry. But, if you’re all negative all the time, your days at 
your current job may be numbered.
Looking for Win-Win Solutions
Work — all types of work — inevitably involves conflict. Why? Because 
people who work alongside one an other are either striving to achieve the 
same goals — recognition and advancement — or they have different views 
about how things should be done at work. The conflicts themselves, it turns 

227
 Chapter 18: At Work
out, are not nearly as important as how you resolve them. And, in doing so, 
you’ll invariably use strategies such as:
 
 Competition: “I win — you lose.  It’s that simple.”
 
 Compromise: “It’s a give-and-take proposition.  Each of us gets a little of 
what we want even though we don’t get all of what we want.”
 
 Collaboration: “Why don’t we pool our resources and work together on 
this problem — be a team?”
 
 Accommodation: “Whatever — we’ll try it your way this time.  It’s not 
worth fighting about.”
Happy, satisfied employees are the ones who use a mixture of all these 
approaches to manage conflict, instead of relying on one particular strategy. I 
cover each of these strategies in the following sections.
Competition
Competition is a win-lose strategy for resolving conflict.  Competitive employ-
ees attempt to gain power (that’s where the term power struggle comes from) 
by winning arguments.  Healthy competition involves “winning without intim-
idating” others.  Unhealthy competition is about winning at all costs — it’s 
aggressive and ends up hurting others.  Most people don’t need to win every 
battle at work but a win every once in a while keeps them wanting to play the 
game.  Competition can be an advantage (a) when it occurs in an adversarial 
situation like a court battle or a sporting event and (b) because it signals that 
the employee is fully committed to some important issue or outcome.  In 
many work settings, competition is viewed as a sign of strength.
Overly competitive employees — those that invariably create a lot of unhap-
piness for themselves and those with whom they work — exhibit the follow-
ing behaviors when there’s a conflict:
 
 They direct personal criticism at the person with whom they’re having a 
conflict.
 
 They argue, make demands, and threaten others.
 
 They act with contempt — for example, roll their eyes or sigh while 
you’re trying to make your point.
 
 They’re quick to deny responsibility.
 
 They’re inflexible — it’s their way or the highway.
 
 Even their humor is hostile.

228
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Compromise
Compromise is a way of managing conflict in which each party both gains 
and loses something. You get some of what you want and I get some of what 
I want. Think of it as a trade-off, where nobody leaves empty-handed or 
unhappy.
 
You know what you want. Now all you have to do is figure out what the other 
person wants or needs in order to feel satisfied. Ask the other person, “What 
one thing would it take to make you feel right about resolving this conflict?”  If 
it’s in your power to give them that one thing, do so.  If it happens that that is 
the one thing that you absolutely don’t want to give in on, ask them if there’s 
maybe something else that would also make them feel right — most of us want 
more than one thing when we’re negotiating with someone else.
Not convinced that compromise is really possible at work? Here are some 
examples of compromise in the workplace:
 
 Edith needs Julie to stay a couple of hours overtime in order to finish 
a project that has a deadline. She knows Julie had planned to meet her 
boyfriend after work for a drink. Instead of telling Julie that she has to 
stay late, like it or not, Edith says, “I know you had plans and I hate to 
ask you to stay until we complete this project. But if you’ll agree this 
once, I’ll let you have an afternoon off later this week to compensate 
you. And I promise I won’t make a habit of this.” If Julie says yes, she’s 
giving up that after-work time with her boyfriend, but she’s gaining an 
afternoon off later; meanwhile, Edith loses Julie later in the week, but 
she gets Julie when she really needs her — now.
 
 Ted has a full agenda for the staff meeting and, because it’s Friday, he 
knows that the rest of the team wants to get the meeting over as soon 
as possible. He starts out by telling them, “Look, folks, we have a lot to 
go over this afternoon, but I’ll leave it up to you as to how quickly and 
efficiently we do that. If you stay focused, you can get out of here early”  
Ted is giving up control of the meeting (something a lot of executives 
don’t want to do); in return, his staff will have to give up their usual pas-
sive (sit quietly and let Ted run the show) approach to staff meetings 
and become much more assertive and organized.  This way, everybody 
wins.
 
 Katie wants a raise, but the budget is tight. Her boss tells her, “I’d love 
to give you a raise — you deserve it. But honestly, the money just isn’t 
there. What I can do — and what I want to do — is start giving you a lot 
more responsibility and authority about how things run around here, 
which will justify a big increase in your salary the next time around. 
Does that sound like something you can live with?”

229
 Chapter 18: At Work
Collaboration
When employees collaborate, they integrate their ideas and energies so that 
the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. This happens because:
 
 Collaboration generates new ideas. All parties feel freer to be creative 
in coming up with ways to solve problems and conflicts. No one idea or 
opinion dominates.
 
 Collaboration signals mutual respect for all parties involved. People 
believe their feelings and ideas have value.
 
 Collaboration requires a greater degree of commitment than other 
conflict management strategies like compromise and accommodation. 
Each employee feels a sense of true partnership — that is, not only are 
they part of the problem, they’re also part of the solution.
 
 Collaboration requires a willingness to move with rather than against 
your coworkers. This means there’s less resistance, less tension in the 
process of finding a new solution to the conflict.
 
The next time you find yourself in conflict with someone at work, start 
out with the mindset that you’d like to cooperate with the other person. It 
increases the likelihood that you’ll reach a win-win solution and keep every-
body happy.
Accommodation
It’s taken me a lifetime to realize just how powerful the word whatever is. In 
conflict situations, where cooperation is the order of the day but there is no 
possibility of compromise or collaboration, try accommodation. Some people 
think of accommodation as just another word for giving up or giving in — 
which, in a highly competitive society, is unthinkable. But it’s also a strategy 
for reducing or eliminating conflict that expresses a desire for harmony.
The word whatever can have many meanings, for example:
 
 Your way is fine; let’s go with that.
 
 I just don’t want to fight about this.
 
 I had my way last time — you can have your way this time.
 
 This issue is not the hill I want to die on.
 
 Obviously, this means more to you than it does to me.
 
 I’m trying to be reasonable here.
 
 Since you’ve got the upper hand, what’s the sense of fighting about this?

230
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
 
The next time someone at work says “I know a lot of you think we should go 
ahead and confront this problem, but I think we should hold off a bit and see 
what else develops” or “I know you and I don’t agree on this, but I feel pretty 
strongly about my plan of attack,” try responding with, “Whatever,” and see if 
the world ends.
Using Anger Constructively
It’s not anger that gets you in trouble at work; it’s how you express your 
anger. Charlie uses his anger destructively whenever he gets frustrated at 
his secretary. He hollers at her, berates her, and slams his fist on her desk. 
Elaine uses a more constructive approach to anger. She asks her secretary 
to come into her office so that what she has to say to her won’t be in public 
view. She starts out by telling the young woman that, for the most part, she’s 
satisfied with her performance at work, but in this particular instance she 
finds herself extremely irritated by a mistake that the secretary made. Elaine 
tempers her anger because she tries to put herself in her secretary’s shoes 
and knows that she wouldn’t like it if someone were yelling at her. Unlike 
Charlie, who just wants to vent his frustration, Elaine’s objective is to use her 
anger strategically to reduce future mistakes.
If you were the secretary, who would you want to work for?
In order to use anger constructively, you first have to decide where you want 
your anger to take you. If you’re Charlie, all you want is to blow off some 
steam. Elaine, on the other hand, wants to improve her relationship with her 
secretary — after all, good help is hard to find!
In the following sections, I help you use your anger constructively at work.
Avoiding anger
In one of my conflict-management classes at 
the local community college, I asked my stu-
dents to complete a test measuring different 
conflict-management styles and also one mea-
suring how often and how strongly they experi-
enced anger in the course of a week. I then took 
each student’s primary conflict-management 
style and calculated the average amount of 
anger that went along with it.
Interestingly, those who chose competition as 
their chief way of resolving conflict with others 
were far more angry on average than their 
counterparts who chose compromise, accom-
modation, or collaboration.

231
 Chapter 18: At Work
Step 1: Think about how you 
want to feel afterward
Many people believe that expressing anger in some outrageous manner (get-
ting things off your chest) relieves tension and leaves you feeling better after-
ward. Ironically, nothing could be farther from the truth. Psychologist James 
Averill at the University of Massachusetts, who has devoted his entire career 
to understanding anger, asked large numbers of people how they felt after 
they got angry with someone else. Believe it or not, the vast majority felt like 
crap: Sixty-nine percent still felt aggravated; 59 percent felt unhappy; and, 
a third or more felt ashamed, embarrassed, guilty, and anxious. Only one in 
five reported feeling pleased, good, or confident afterward.
The explanation as to why most of us feel bad after expressing our anger 
comes from the motives we have for expressing it — in other words, what 
do we hope to gain? Professor Averill found three motives that pretty much 
guide all expression of anger — all of which, in my opinion, are destructive:
 
 The need to assert my authority or to improve my image — selfish or 
self-centered anger.
 
 The need to seek revenge — to get back at a fellow employee in 
some malicious way. (In the “Counteracting Counterproductive Work 
Behavior” section, later in this chapter, I show you how this leads to 
counterproductive work behavior.)
 
 The need to vent pent-up frustration.
If you choose to use your anger constructively, afterward you will not feel:
 
 Like holding a grudge against a coworker
 
 Totally justified in continuing to dislike the other person
 
 Defensive in social situations involving the other employee
 
 Victimized by that person
 
 As though you’re going to explode any minute
 
 Pessimistic about being able to work effectively with this person in the 
future

232
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Step 2: Make anger about the 
problem, not the person
The focus of Charlie’s anger is on his secretary, while Elaine’s focus in on the 
mistake the secretary made. This is a key distinction between constructive 
and destructive anger.
 
Personal attacks make people feel defiant, indifferent, hurt, angry, and 
rejected — none of which is conducive to improved work performance.
 
Concentrate on what you’re angry about, not who you’re angry at.
Step 3: Look at what’s 
underneath your anger
This step is easier than you think. Why? Because the source of your anger 
is you! Your anger has to do with your expectations, your values, what you 
demand from your coworkers, your level of tolerance, and so forth. Think of 
anger as a mirror into your heart and soul. Charlie may be angry at his sec-
retary for some flaw or imperfection he can’t tolerate in himself. One of the 
reasons that anger can be constructive is because it tells you something — 
sometimes a lot — about yourself that you didn’t know.
 
The next time you find yourself angry with someone at work, ask yourself this 
question: Why am I so angry — what does my anger say about me? You’ll learn 
a lot more than if you ask the other person, “Why do you keep annoying me?”
Step 4: Be empathetic
Think about how you express your anger at work and then ask yourself how 
you would feel and react if you were on the receiving end of that behavior. 
Gives you a whole different perspective, doesn’t it? That perspective is what 
enables you to use anger constructively.
The ability to put yourself in the other employee’s shoes is called empathy 
and it comes in two forms:
 
 Mental empathy: Dr. Avery Weisman, a renowned psychiatrist at 
Harvard University, summed it up best by describing this type of empa-
thy as “having respect for another person’s irrationality.”

233
 Chapter 18: At Work
 
 Emotional empathy: Most people are familiar with this kind of empathy.
It’s when you actually feel the other person’s feeling.  Their sadness 
makes you sad.  Their nervousness makes you nervous.  Their unhappi-
ness makes you unhappy.   
Remember: Both types of empathy are important and ideally they both come 
into play when you’re trying to handle your anger more constructively. One 
is no better than the other — they’re just different manifestations of the same 
thing.
If you’d like to know more about empathy and its relationship to anger, check 
out two of my books, Anger Management For Dummies (Wiley) and ANGER-
FREE: Ten Basic Steps to Managing Your Anger (Quill).
Step 5: Engage in give-and-take 
conversation
Constructive anger expression, like all forms of effective communication, 
involves a two-person dialogue. A monologue is when you do all the talking, 
shouting, or lecturing and the other party sits there passively like a ventrilo-
quist’s dummy, speaking only when you let it. In Part IV of Happiness For 
Dummies, I emphasize the importance of balance, and what I’m stressing here 
is the need for a balanced conversation. First you speak, then she speaks, 
and so on until you hopefully reach a point of mutual understanding.
Step 6: Watch your body language
Most of the reactions people have to other people’s anger has to do with 
nonverbal behavior. Here are some types of body language that clearly do not 
signal constructive anger expression:
 
 Clenched fists
 
 Finger pointing
 
 Hand waving
 
 Grabbing the other person by the arm
 
 Arms crossed at the chest
 
 Narrowing of the eyes
 
 Glaring

234
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
 
 Frowning
 
 Loudly tapping the fingers
 
 Speaking rapidly or loudly
 
 Excessive head nodding
 
 Breathing heavily
Avoid these types of body language if you want to accomplish something 
useful with your anger.
 
Psychological research has shown that human beings are much more sensi-
tive to an angry look than they are to any other emotion. We’re much more 
alert to angry faces, for example, than happy faces. It’s as though our brain 
is constantly scanning the environment for the smallest sign of impending 
anger — so that we can prepare ourselves for the onslaught of negative emo-
tion that may eventually come our way.
Counteracting Counterproductive 
Work Behavior
Everything you do at work falls into one of two categories — productive or 
counterproductive. How effective you are as an employee is determined 
by the balance between the two. If you spend far too much time trying to 
look busy when you’re not, avoiding returning phone calls to someone you 
should, and arguing with coworkers, your work will suffer. These are all 
classic examples of counterproductive work behavior — which is the type 
of behavior that employees engage in when they’re angry, dissatisfied, and 
unhappy.
If you want to be happy at work, you must find ways to counteract that coun-
terproductive work behavior, which is what I want to discuss in this section.
Giving your employer a full day’s effort
In a survey I did with a group of 74 employees at one worksite, I found that 
five of the most common forms of counterproductive work behavior involved 
stealing time from the employer. Employees reported often observing their 
coworkers:

235
 Chapter 18: At Work
 
 Coming to work late without permission
 
 Taking longer breaks than allowed
 
 Daydreaming rather than doing work
 
 Leaving work early without permission
 
 Trying to look busy when you’re not
Sound familiar? There is a connection between being an unhappy, disgruntled 
employee and coming in late or leaving early. You could wait until someone or 
something makes you happier about your job, so that you can start looking for-
ward to working a full day. Or you could reverse the connection and decide to 
see if you’re happier when you give your employer a full day’s effort; if you do, 
you’ll get more accomplished and feel better about your individual productiv-
ity. Of course, I’m all in favor of the proactive approach — reversing that 
connection.
Treating your coworkers with civility
We live in a reciprocal world — anger begets anger, niceness begets nice-
ness. Problem is, we’re all waiting on the other guy to make the first move 
and then we react accordingly. Most of the things I cover in this chapter — 
conflict management styles like compromise and collaboration, using anger 
constructively, and simple things like saying “please” and “thank you” — are 
considered forms of civility.
The survey I mention in the preceding section suggests a number of uncivil 
behaviors that you need to avoid:
 
 Ignoring someone at work
 
 Being nasty or rude to a client or coworker
 
 Blaming fellow employees for mistakes that you make
 
 Insulting others about their job performance
 
 Refusing to help out at work
 
 Making fun of people at work
 
 Being verbally abusive to a supervisor or coworker

236
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
 
You can counteract such behavior by:
 
 Always be willing to help a colleague in need
 
 Owning up to your own mistakes
 
 Treating coworkers with courtesy, not contempt
 
 Finding ways to compliment others for their work
 
 Laughing with others, not at them
 
 Telling at least five coworkers per day, “Have a good day!”
Being a team player
Teamwork seems to be the mantra of most workplaces today. One indus-
try after another proudly heralds the fact that they’ve “gone to the team 
approach.” The problem with counterproductive work behavior is that it 
works against the team concept.
Ron, for example, would pick and choose when he wanted to be a team 
player. As vice president of marketing, Ron was a key player in the day-to-day 
operations of his company. When Ron was happy with the way things were 
going (usually because others were doing things his way), he was cordial, 
provided other VPs with vital information they needed, and accessible to 
everyone. But, when he was not happy, he would act like a contrarian — 
stubborn, oppositional, reclusive — for example, not returning important 
phone calls and e-mails to his colleagues. On more than one occasion, this 
cost the company money — large sums of money — not to mention alienating 
Ron from other members of upper management.
In order for teams to work, the team members must have:
 
 A cooperative attitude: Unfortunately, Ron is one of those people who 
cooperates when it suits him and doesn’t when it doesn’t.
 
 Complimentary skills with others on the team: Marketing was Ron’s 
area of expertise, which — when he cooperated — complimented his 
teammates in finance, sales, distribution, product design, and so forth.
 
 Performance goals in common with his team: One thing I’ve learned in 
consulting with both individuals and groups in the workplace is that it’s 
always dangerous to assume everyone has the same goals in mind. Most 
often, they don’t — which means that they often find themselves pulling 
in different directions at the same time and getting nowhere.

237
 Chapter 18: At Work
 
 A common philosophy about how to reach those goals: Even if every-
one on the team agrees on a goal, they may not necessarily agree on 
how to best get there. One team member may want to proceed slowly 
but surely toward the overall objective, while others may want to move 
full speed ahead. In order for the team to work, all the team members 
need to agree on how to get there.
 
 Mutual accountability: There’s no passing the buck when you’re a team 
player. It’s not enough to be accountable to yourself — you have to be 
accountable to everyone else on the team. And they have to be account-
able to you.
Creating good public relations
One of the most commonly acknowledged examples of counterproductive 
work behavior is complaining to people outside work about how lousy the 
place you work is. A lot of unhappy employees aren’t content to complain 
inside the workplace; they feel compelled to air the dirty linen with anyone in 
the community who will listen.
The thing is, complaining about your job doesn’t make you feel any better, 
but it makes those to whom you’re complaining ask themselves, “If the place 
is so bad, why on Earth does she continue working there? Is she not good 
enough to get another job?”
The other thing to consider is that an employer’s reputation, its credibility, 
is an asset — an asset which you as an employee share. When you badmouth 
your employer to others, you diminish that asset — and you and they both 
lose!
 
If you can’t say anything positive about where you work, it’s probably best to 
refrain from saying anything at all or, if asked, something fairly innocuous like 
“Oh, things could be better but, then again, no job’s perfect.”  If you can’t do 
that and you have a strong urge to complain about how bad things at work 
are, then I would recommend talking to a life coach or therapist — someone 
who can be objective and supportive at the same time.

lthough happiness may be the ultimate goal of a family, it shouldn’t 
be the primary focus. Instead, focus on the ways in which members of 
your family treat each other, and the happiness will follow:
 
 Happy families cooperate; unhappy families compete.
 
 Happy families share common goals and are accountable to each other; 
in unhappy families, everybody marches to a different drum and is 
accountable only to himself.
 
 Happy families know how to handle anger constructively; unhappy fami-
lies do not.
 
 Happy families support each other in good times and bad; in unhappy 
families, it’s every man, woman, and child for himself or herself.
Throughout this book, I offer lots of tips about how to achieve individual hap-
piness. In this chapter, I apply many of those same principles to achieving col-
lective happiness within a family. For example families need structure — rules, 
priorities, and goals (Chapter 14); they need to play as well as work together 
(Chapter 15); family members need to see each other smile (Chapter 12); and, 
they need to regularly acknowledge how happy they are to be a part of this 
family (Chapter 11).
Happiness is the glue that binds families together. Without it, families tend to 
fragment and become distant strangers, even if they love one another. If your 
family isn’t as happy as you know it could be, this chapter is for you.

Setting Priorities
Some families have priorities — things that they feel are most important and 
crucial to family life and success and that give the family a clearly defined 
sense of direction and purpose. Other families do not — they’re like tumble-
weeds, blowing this way and that and getting nowhere in particular.
Take the Johnson family, for example. Their home is full of books and maga-
zines. Every evening, the parents ask their children if they have homework. At 
the dinner table, they talk about what’s happening in the world and even dis-
cuss serious topics like abortion, whether kids should have sex in their teens, 
drug use, and whether it’s okay for people to live together before marriage. 
They watch TV as a family, and on Saturdays they all go to the local library 
and check out books. When the kids were little, the parents enrolled them 
in summer reading groups and took them to museums. And the parents are 
among the few who go to parents’ night at their children’s school. It doesn’t 
take a PhD to figure out that, in the Johnson family, education is a priority.
For the Elliott family, it’s all about game night. All three of their kids are 
involved in sports — Holly is on the school soccer team, Brad plays junior var-
sity football, and Mark is in Little League baseball. The parents attend all their 
games, sometimes dividing themselves up so that they can be at two different 
games at the same time. The family cheers for their favorite college team on 
the weekends as they watch the games together in the family den. The father is 
a member of a sports club and the mother organizes refreshments for Mark’s 
Little League games. This family’s number-one priority is sports.
And, then there’s the Gutierrez family, whose priority is socialization. They 
make their home available for all their children’s friends. There are big 
birthday parties for the parents as well as the kids. Last Thanksgiving, there 
were 25 friends and relatives for dinner, and at Christmas the house is full of 
people. The parents like to take group vacations with other couples and fami-
lies rather than just the five of them.
All of these families are happy — they’re just happy about different things.
Priorities provide families with:
 
 A sense of immediacy: What the family needs or wants to do first and 
foremost
 
 A sense of purpose: How this family wants to define itself
 
 A sense of importance: What the family believes is important
 
 A set of shared values: Values that all the family members share in 
common
 
 A sense of the future: Where the family’s heading in the days, weeks, 
months, and years to come

241
 Chapter 19: At Home
 
 A sense of stability: An agenda that doesn’t change from one day to 
the next
 
Try this exercise to help your family set its own priorities:
 
1. Find a time when the whole family can sit down together for at least 
an hour.
 
2. Pass out sheets of paper and ask each family member to write down 
three priorities he or she thinks the family has or should have.
 
 Give examples like the ones I mention earlier in this section. Also, men-
tion things like honesty, supporting each other, and health. Emphasize 
that this is not about your individual priorities — it’s about what you 
think the family should be doing as a group.
 
3. Then, one by one, have each member do a “show and tell,” sharing 
his list and explaining why he chose the things he did.
 
4. Don’t comment right away — wait until everyone has shared their list 
and then open the door for discussion.
 
 Are there any points of agreement — things listed by more than one 
family member? Are there any glaring omissions? Do family members 
see any obstacles to achieving these priorities? Is there anyone in the 
family who seems to not want to get onboard with these priorities? If so, 
don’t criticize them; instead say “It’s okay if you don’t want to share you 
priorities with us now, but we really do want to know what you think 
this family should be doing more of that we aren’t or less of than we 
are.” Leave the door open for them go join in later on.
The goal is to end the hour with a firm sense of what you value as a family.
We’re a working family
Like most middle-class families, my wife and 
I made work — having a work ethic, learning 
how to work, being a responsible employee — 
a cornerstone of our family values. At the dinner 
table, we talked about my work — the things I 
enjoyed and the problems I had — and when 
the kids were old enough, we encouraged them 
to find jobs. Both of our children had part-time 
jobs when they were in high school and they 
earned extra money working during Christmas 
holidays and the summer months.
We stressed the importance of being at work on 
time, of helping out their fellow employees, and 
showing initiative — which always pays off. 
And we talked about how education — another 
family priority — affords a person more options 
when it comes to employment. So, it should 
come as no surprise that both our kids have 
done well in their careers and don’t depend on 
us for financial support. All those dinner con-
versations must’ve sunk in!
Since we’re definitely Type A parents, what we 
didn’t talk enough about is how important it is to 
play (Chapter 15 talks about the need to balance 
work and play). That, our kids have had to learn 
more on their own.

Deciding What Kind of Parent 
You Want to Be
People have different hairstyles, wear different styles of clothing, and have 
distinct parenting styles, too. How your raise you children doesn’t just affect 
how happy they’ll be; it affects how they perform in school, whether they 
take up smoking, how likely it is they’ll suffer from depression, and whether 
they engage in risky sexual behavior.
According to psychologists who study this sort of thing, there are four main 
styles of parenting: autocratic, authoritative, permissive, and unengaged. The 
styles differ in terms of how much involvement you have in your child’s life 
and how much control you try to exert over your child’s behavior. Table 19-1 
illustrates the differences.
Table 19-1 
Parenting Styles

Parental Control
High

High

Unengaged
I describe the various styles in the following sections. Decide which one fits 
the relationship you have with your child.
 
Parenting styles are learned patterns of behavior — which means they can be 
unlearned at any point in life if you choose.
 
Have each of your kids review the following sections and ask them which one they 
think fits you. Don’t be surprised — and, more important, don’t be defensive — if 
they have a different view of how you parent. Ask them to explain their answer 
and give specific examples of why they chose that particular style. Maybe the 
truth lies somewhere in between what you and your kids think.
Autocratic
Autocratic parents tend to be involved in their children’s lives only so far as 
rules and punishment are concerned. They decide what the child does, who 
the child can be friends with, where the child is supposed to be, and ulti-
mately what the child’s life is going to be.

243
 Chapter 19: At Home
One autocratic mother told me that when her son was just 6 years old, he knew 
he was going to go to the University of Florida and be an architect. “Ridiculous,” 
I said. “A 6-year-old can’t possible conceive of what an architect is or, for that 
matter, what a university is. The truth is you and your husband decided what 
you wanted him to be and then made sure he fulfilled your dream.”
There is little, if any, back-and-forth dialogue between autocratic parents and 
their kids — everything is a lecture that embodies the message, “It’s my way 
or the highway!” Children raised by autocratic parents aren’t happy, but they 
are angry and afraid — the fear is evident, and their anger is often suppressed. 
How do they view their parents? As cold, harsh, and rejecting — not a very 
pretty picture.
 
If you want to know if you’re an autocratic parent, read the following state-
ment and answer true or false:
As a parent, I most often make the decisions about my child’s behavior.
If you answered true, you’re an autocratic parent.
Authoritative
If you’re an authoritative parent, you’re highly involved in your children’s 
lives and you’re not afraid to exert a reasonable amount of control over their 
behavior. You’re nice, but firm. You have a presence in their lives — doing 
things with them and showing up for things that are important. There is no 
mistake who is the parent and who is the child, even when they reach their 
adolescent years. You actually foster independence and self-reliance, which 
increase with age. You teach your children to be civil and responsible in 
dealings with others, including family members. You allow your children to 
find their voice and verbalize their own opinions, needs, wants, fears, and life 
goals. You punish when it’s called for but you aren’t heavy-handed — send-
ing your children to a timeout or grounding them is one thing, swearing at 
and threatening them is quite another. How do the children of authoritarian 
parents view their parents? As warm, accepting, and loving — despite the 
fact that parents exert control over their lives.
If you want your child to be a nonsmoker, make good grades, enjoy positive 
mental health, and not engage in at-risk sex, this is definitely the style you 
want to choose.
 
To determine if you’re an authoritative parent, answer true or false to 
the statement:
I ask my children their opinion but I generally end up making the decisions — 
for example, about curfew or at what age they can begin dating.
If you answered true, you’re an authoritative parent.

244
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Permissive
This is the style of parenting that kids love — at least in the short run. Why? 
Simple: Permissive parents let their kids do as they please, come and go as 
they like, set their own rules — all in the name of love. Permissive parents are 
involved in their kids’ lives, to be sure, but in a hands-off kind of way. They 
put few demands on their kids, set few if any limits on their social and emo-
tional behavior (hey, tantrums are okay — they don’t mean anything by it!), 
and allow them maximum independence. The one word that never comes out 
of the permissive parent’s mouth is no. It’s up to the kids to decide if smoking 
is bad for them. It’s up to the kids to decide what their curfew is, if they have 
one at all. It’s up to the kids whether they do their homework.
How do children view their permissive parents? Kids think their parents are 
wonderful, cool, and their very best friends. Problem is, these kids also end 
up being moody, defiant, rebellious, and unable to handle life when they 
don’t get their way. (They also make difficult employees when they enter the 
workplace and difficult partners in marriage.)
 
Are you a permissive parent? To find out, answer true or false to this statement:
My kids may ask my opinion, but I generally leave it up to them to make 
their decisions.
If you answered true, you’re definitely a permissive parent.
Unengaged
Unengaged parents are unaware of what their kids are up to, unavailable to 
them emotionally, and unwilling to assume their responsibilities as a parent 
beyond that of providing food and shelter, forcing them to attend school, and 
making sure they have the latest style tennis shoes. Unengaged parents come 
from all walks of life, from all demographic and socioeconomic groups.
Children of unengaged parents end up alienated from adults as well as peers. 
They have limited social and problem-solving skills and often use anger as 
a means of keeping others (whom they view as threatening) at a distance. 
They’re anything but happy. How do these kids see their parents? They don’t.
 
To see if this is your style of parenting, answer the following statement with 
true or false:
Do you know or care where your child is at all times?
 
If the answer is true, you’re an unengaged parent, and your kids are definitely 
at risk both to themselves and others. (These children can represent signifi-
cant danger to society.)

 Chapter 19: At Home
Balancing Interdependence 
with Autonomy
When I was a child, I saw a movie that showed how a mother bear loves, 
protects, and gives her total attention to her cubs for one year . . . and then 
abruptly chases them up a tree and walks away, leaving them to survive on 
their own. Thank goodness, humans take a little longer to make sure their off-
spring can live on their own (called autonomy) and with other people (inter-
dependence). Striking the right balance between these two opposite needs is 
essential to family happiness.
Children begin to strive for autonomy at the end of the first year of life, when 
they begin to walk. Their development of language makes them even more 
autonomous because they can tell their parents “No!” Autonomy really comes 
into its own when children enter their adolescent years. As a parent, you 
need to foster this emerging sense of independence — but not at the expense 
of family involvement. In other words, send the message to your child that “I 
want you to be an individual, but you’re still a member of this family.”
Interdependence means simply two or more people working together on a 
common activity or toward a common goal. It’s the old idea that two hands — 
or minds — are better than one. Examples of interdependent behavior among 
family members include
 
 Helping one another prepare family meals
 
 Parents helping children with their homework
 
 Everyone helping out with the yard work
 
 Attending to one another during illness
 
 Doing household chores together — washing dishes, doing laundry
 
 Taking care of family pets
Of course, they’re angry
I asked the kids in my middle school and high 
school anger management classes what kind 
of parents they had. Only a small number (18 
percent) saw their parents as fitting the authori-
tative style. The rest of them described their par-
ents as autocratic (32 percent), permissive (18 
percent), and unengaged (32 percent). No wonder 
they were angry and totally unable to relate to 
adults in the school environment — principals, 
teachers, counselors, even the resource officer 
assigned to the school. School for these kids was 
anything but happy.

246
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
 
 Playing cards and other types of games
 
 Outdoor recreational pursuits like cycling, fishing, camping
 
 Working on school projects together
In the following sections, I show you how to foster independence without get-
ting into power struggles with your kids and I talk about why it’s important 
that each member of the family have a clear job description.
Sharing power
The concept of power is fundamental to family life. People talk about ways in 
which parents can empower their children, about power struggles between par-
ents and children, and the power differential that exists between siblings of dif-
ferent ages. How families handle the “power relationships” that emerge — and 
change — over time in large part determines how happy they end up being.
Where there is a significant imbalance of power — for example, an autocratic 
father sets all the rules for his teenage daughter and threatens to punish her 
if she doesn’t comply — problems exist. At the very least, in this example, 
the daughter feels powerless, which can be a breeding ground for feelings of 
depression, defiance, or hostility. At the worst, the father and daughter will 
become estranged from one another.
For parents, the trick is to find age-appropriate ways of beginning to share 
power with their kids starting at an early age and continuing until they reach 
adulthood. Believe me, I know this task isn’t an easy one. Parents are often 
reluctant to relinquish power — “This is my house. I pay the bills here. And, 
I know what’s best for you.” And children generally want more power than 
they can handle at each stage of their development — “I’ll be okay with my 
friends at the beach. I don’t know why you worry so much. You just need to 
chill out.” This conflict is precisely what makes family life sometimes seem 
more like a wrestling match than anything else.
 
Have a family discussion — with the whole family — about power. Don’t allow 
these issues to play themselves out in an unconscious, unspoken, uncivil, and 
ultimately unhappy way. Other ways of sharing family power at different ages 
include: telling your 7-year-old that she can have a friend over to play and let-
ting her decide which friend to invite; sending your 11-year-old to the grocery 
store to pick up some items for dinner; letting your son pick out which kind of 
pizza the family will eat; letting the kids decide what the family watches on TV 
sometimes (my guess it won’t be CNN or Fox News); and, letting adolescents 
of driving age chauffeur the younger children to dance class and other after-
school activities.

247
 Chapter 19: At Home
Making sure everybody has a job
Imagine being hired for a job and not having a job description. They give you 
an office, a desk, and some filing cabinets, but no one ever tells you what 
you’re there for. Or, imagine that you’re on a baseball team, and you’re all 
suited up for the game, but the coach has never told you what position he 
wants you to play. You just sit on the bench, waiting, but there’s nothing for 
you to do that can make you feel a part of this team.
In happy families, everyone has an assignment, a job, a purpose, something 
he or she can contribute to family life. There are no spectators, and no one 
is allowed to sit idly on the sidelines. (This builds a foundation of commit-
ment which is vital to developing a hardy personality — more about this in 
Chapter 6).
Children — even very young ones — need to know what is expected of 
them. For example, you may tell your 4-year old, “Your job is to pick up 
your toys after you’re through playing with them. That’s not mommy’s job.” 
Adolescents need to know that their job is to spend a certain amount of time 
helping out at home — even though a million exciting and enticing opportuni-
ties exist elsewhere. The same goes for parents, whose jobs go way beyond 
simply putting bread on the table and chauffeuring kids around town (see 
Chapter 21).
 
Change the family dialogue to include the phrases It’s my job to . . . and It’s 
your job to. . . . Assuming everybody does his or her job consistently and well, 
how can the family help but be happy? If someone in the family isn’t happy 
because she doesn’t like her particular job (for example, cleaning up the 
kitchen after dinner) tell her it’s fine with you if she swaps with another family 
member (maybe her brother hates having to walk the family dog) just as long 
as everyone ends up with a job.
Fighting Fair
All families fight. The question is: “Do they fight fair?” Children fight for 
increased autonomy; parents fight for more respect. Families fight over ideas, 
values, how to spend money, curfews, who can drive the car, and the list goes 
on. There are winners and losers and sometimes there’s even compromise.
 
Happy families fight, too — they just do it fairly. In happy families:
 
 Parents and children fight “for” rather than “against” things. It’s one 
thing if a child fights for what he considers a more reasonable curfew — 
it’s quite another if he simply defies his parents at every turn, even when 
they’re trying to be reasonable.

248
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
 
 Parents use nonphysical means of discipline. This includes things such 
as grounding, time-outs, restriction of privileges like driving the family 
car, and extra chores.
 
 Conflicts are more often managed in noncompetitive ways. This 
includes: compromise (each person giving up something), accommoda-
tion (going along with what the other person wants to avoid further 
conflict), and collaboration (both parties working together to reach a 
mutually agreed upon resolution to the conflict). Happy families don’t 
often compete with one another, nor do they go out of their way to 
avoid conflicts, both of which end up leaving family members angry. (In 
the preceding Chapter 18, I show you how these ways of managing con-
flict also come into play in the adult work-a-day world.)
 
 Family members don’t treat each other with contempt. They don’t 
belittle, cuss, or demean each other — all of which are meant to inflict 
maximum damage on the other person, a person they supposedly love. 
(In the following Chapter 20, I talk about how this type of behavior, often 
learned in families, can ultimately ruin intimate partner relationships 
such as marriage.)
 
 Family members show emotional and behavioral restraint. In short, 
there are self-imposed limits to how emotions — like anger — are 
expressed. A mother may think about wringing her daughter’s neck, but 
she doesn’t. Family members allow themselves to be irritated or angry, 
but they stop short of rage or what I call toxic anger. (To appreciate the 
difference between anger and rage, check out Anger Management For 
Dummies [Wiley].)
 
 Fighting is just one thing family members do — it’s not the only thing 
they do. There are far more positive interactions than negative ones.
The mantra of a happy family
A happy family is one characterized by mutual 
support, interdependence, shared power, and 
at least one time a day when everyone gets 
together for a meal. All these ingredients are 
captured in what I believe should be the fam-
ily’s mantra (a sacred word, phrase, or formula 
that has magical power):
 
 We are all in this together.
I encourage family members to silently recite 
this mantra throughout the day — in good times 
and bad. And, on occasion, actually repeat the 
phrase out loud. For example, when your chil-
dren are upset with you because you won’t 
let them have something they want, look them 
straight in the eye and say, “Hey, remember: 
We’re all in this together.” I guarantee this will 
go a long way to defusing family conflicts and 
supporting the importance of family unity — 
together.

 Chapter 19: At Home
The Family Table: Sharing the 
All-Important One Meal a Day
The modern-day family finds itself in a major time crunch. Too much to do 
and not nearly enough time to get it all done. Parents are pulled one way 
(work, work, work!) and kids another (school, sports, dance classes, studying 
for SATs). You’re lucky if you have one meal a day together — but, actually 
psychologists say that may be enough.
The all-important one meal a day isn’t about the food as much as it is about 
the chance to maintain those meaningful social ties (see Chapter 16) essen-
tial to a happy family life. Mealtime is when family members can
 
 Catch each other up on what’s going on in their lives
 
 Negotiate changes in family rules
 
 Ventilate (allow to breathe, as it were, in contrast to venting which 
describes a volcanic eruption of raw emotion) their feelings without 
being judged
 
 Ask for advice
 
 Reinforce each other’s individual achievements
 
 Plan future events
 
 Make sure everyone is doing their family “jobs”
 
 Have intelligent discussions about current events
 
 Talk about spiritual issues
 
 Revisit their biological roots
It’s a time when family members can support one another be reminded that 
they belong to something greater than themselves.
In today’s super-busy world, getting together routinely for a particular 
meal — for example, dinner at home — may be difficult. That’s fine — then 
have breakfast together if that fits your family schedule better or meet for dinner 
at a restaurant. What is important when it comes to happiness is not the time 
or location, but rather the fact that the family spends some meaningful time 
together each and every day.

Don’t be a slave to family rituals
A slave, by definition, has no choice about what 
he does in life from one minute to the next.
Sallie is a good example of someone who is 
a slave to family rituals. Her teenage daugh-
ter comes home from school and announces, 
“There’s a big basketball game tonight. 
Everybody’s going to be there. So, let’s get to 
the gym early, okay?”
Sallie, who just got home from work, replies, “I 
haven’t started dinner yet and that’s going to 
take a while.” Ritual # 1: Our family must always 
sit down for a complete, full-scale evening meal 
no matter what’s going on.
Sallie fixes dinner, the family eats, and when 
they’re finished the daughter says, “Okay, let’s 
get going or we’ll be late.” Her brother and dad 
are ready to go, but Sallie isn’t — “You all go 
ahead. I’ve got to clean up the kitchen.” The 
family protests, “Come on — you can clean up 
later after we get home.” But Sallie is adamant 
about Ritual # 2: You can’t leave dirty dishes on 
the counter no matter what.
Looking rather unhappy, the family — without 
Sallie — heads off for the game. As if Sallie 
didn’t feel bad enough realizing she was miss-
ing out on a good time with her family while they 
were gone, she felt even worse when the got 
back home and her daughter ran in and shouted, 
“What a great game! You should have seen it. It 
came down to the wire — but we pulled it out. It 
was fantastic! The gym was packed. Everybody 
asked where you were.”
Remember: Rituals are just patterns of habitual 
behavior that make life a little more predictable 
and stable. But they shouldn’t be set in stone 
and you shouldn’t be a slave to them. Never 
pass up a good time just to get the dishes 
done!

eing in love is one thing. Being happy with your life partner is quite 
another.
Mel and Katherine found that out the hard way. What seemed like a happy 
marriage ended abruptly after 30 years, not long after their last child left 
home. Mel asked his wife to sit down one evening — an evening like any 
other — and they had the following conversation:
Mel: I don’t want you to get upset, but I’ll be moving my stuff out in the 
morning.
Katherine: What do you mean you’re moving out? Moving to where?!
Mel: The apartment I signed a lease on yesterday.
Katherine: I don’t understand. Why are you moving into an apartment?
Mel: Because I’m getting a divorce. I’ve already seen a lawyer and he’s 
putting together the paperwork.
Katherine: Divorce. Why? What’s wrong?!
Mel: I’m just not happy — I haven’t been for years — and I thought it was 
time to do something about it.
Despite Katherine’s pleas that they go to marital counseling, Mel had made 
up his mind and there was no turning back. What made this especially dif-
ficult for Katherine was the fact that she didn’t see it coming. “I thought 
we were a happy couple,” she said. “We never had a cross word, worked 
together to raise three healthy children, took care of our parents, worked 
in the yard together, paid our bills on time.” But apparently, something was 
missing — something important.

In this chapter, I examine why intimate relationships aren’t always as happy 
as they seem and tell you what you can do to avoid ending up like Katherine 
and Mel.
Understanding What Being 
a Partner Really Means
When you’re in a long-term relationship — whether it’s within a marriage or 
not — you have a partner. Your partner is your most intimate companion. 
And it’s companionship — not love, not sexual gratification, and especially 
not just having someone with whom you can split the monthly mortgage 
payment — that leads to happiness in intimate relationships.
Answer the following questions to see how good of a companion you are to 
your partner:
 
1. How willing or eager are you to accompany your partner through 
life’s journey?
 
• Not very: 1
 
• Somewhat: 2
 
• Very much: 3
 
• Absolutely 4
 
2. How willing are you to treat your partner as an equal in all things?
 
• Not very: 1
 
• Somewhat: 2

Add up the point values of your answers. A score of 25 or above indicates a 
strong relationship, at least from your end. If you want to know how good a 
companion your partner is, have your partner take the test. The combined 
scores should tell you the state of your relationship.
Balancing the Me with the We
A happy couple is one where the two partners retain their own separate, indi-
vidual identities while working together to meet life’s many challenges and 
accomplish mutual goals.
A friend of mine who’s a minister refused to continue the traditional marriage 
ritual where the bride and groom light a joint candle — symbolizing their 
union — and extinguish their respective individual candles. He argued that it 
was a mistake to ask the couple to forsake their individual identities in order 
to enter into the sanctity of marriage — and he was right!
On the other hand, it’s equally naïve to imagine that you can be in a commit-
ted relationship (one with no “back door”) — and be happy together — with-
out adjusting your interests, needs, and lifestyle to those of your partner.
The hard part is deciding just how much of an adjustment to make — and 
that’s where the idea of balance becomes important. For example, in my ear-
lier example of Katherine and Mel, the problem that led Mel to seek a divorce 
was that he made too many adjustments to suit his wife and essentially 
ended up with a marriage that was all about the two of them and not enough 
about him. He complained, “I’m tired of always doing what she wants to do or 
what the kids want to do. It’s my turn now. I’m going to do what I want from 
now on. I’m going to play golf with my friends, go where I want to go, eat the 
things I like, spend my money on things that I want.” For 30 years, it had all 
been about Katherine, his children, his parents, and his in-laws — and now it 
was all about Mel.
Having a confidant is good for your heart
Dr. Redford Williams, a former colleague of 
mine at Duke University Medical Center, found 
that patients undergoing coronary angiography 
(X-ray exam of blood vessels after injection 
of a radiopague material) were three times 
less likely to die from heart disease within five 
years if they were married and/or could identify 
a confidant with whom they could share their 
troubles. Interestingly, these remarkable dif-
ferences in survival rates remained even when 
Dr. Williams took into account the severity of 
disease suffered by each patient.

 Chapter 20: In Intimate Relationships
 
Think about how you spend your time on the weekends — who you’re with, 
the kind of activities you engage in, where you go, and so on. Now decide 
which of these are we activities and which are me pursuits. Examples of we 
activities include things such as:
 
 Meeting another couple for dinner
 
 Going to a movie together
 
 Attending church together
 
 Working in the yard together
Me activities include
 
 Spending some time by yourself browsing through a local bookstore
 
 Checking out the local flea market on your own
 
 Playing basketball with your buddies
 
 Going to the spa with your girlfriends
 
 Reading
 
 Having lunch alone with a close friend
Your disease is not my disease
For years, I worked with people who suffered 
from multiple sclerosis (MS) and the families 
of people with MS. The effects of MS are 
crippling not only for the person who has the 
disease, but also for the quality of the per-
son’s relationships — especially intimate 
relationships.
I once was asked to address a large group of 
spouses of MS patients at a regional confer-
ence. The experience was incredible — and 
sad. I started out by asking the audience how 
their spouses’ illness had changed their lives. 
One by one, they stood up and told heart-
wrenching stories about how they could no 
longer enjoy life.
One young man in particular caught my atten-
tion when he described — in tears — how he 
had given up everything he loved since his wife 
contracted MS. He no longer joined his friends 
on weekend cycling tours in the Virginia moun-
tains, no longer played pickup basketball with 
his friends from high school, and so on.
When I asked him why he had ended all those 
activities, he answered rather angrily, “Because 
she can’t do those things anymore because of 
her damned MS, and I have to stay home with 
her all the time.” I told him, as nicely as I could, 
that I thought he was making a mistake. I could 
tell he was already beginning to resent his wife 
and her disease, because of the disabling effect 
it had on their marriage. I assured him that the 
world wouldn’t end if he joined his friends on a 
biking expedition while his wife stayed at home 
with a friend.
I told him, “If you give up all the things you enjoy 
doing just because your wife has MS, you might 
as well have MS, too!”

How balanced are these activities? If the numbers are too unbalanced (more 
than 80 percent for one type of activity and less than 20 percent for the 
other), it’s time for a change.
 
The key to happiness lies in balance.
Thinking of Happiness in a Relationship 
as a Three-Legged Stool
Psychologists who study what makes for a successful and loving relationship 
have narrowed it down to three components:
 
 Passion: “I’m crazy about her.”
 
 Shared interests: “We enjoy the same things — travel, golf.”
 
 Intimacy: “I feel really close to him.”
Think of your relationship as a three-legged stool. If all three legs are in place, 
you have a secure feeling. If not, the relationship gets a bit wobbly!
 
A relationship that’s based on a combination of passion and intimacy but 
lacks shared interests is said to be a romantic relationship. A relationship that 
combines intimacy and shared interests but lacks physical passion is seen 
as a companionate relationship. And a relationship that combines passion 
and shared interests, but lacks intimacy, is referred to as a shallow orfatuous 
(means silly) relationship. What kind of stool are you sitting on?
Passion
In the three-legged stool analogy, passion is physical passion — the feeling of 
arousal you get when your partner walks into the room and catches your eye. 
Your heart begins to pump faster, your blood pressure goes up, and every-
thing about you gets turned on from head to toe. I’m also talking about the 
sexual interaction that comes from such feelings — holding hands, hugging, 
touching, and having sex. Passion is all about biology and adrenaline. Passion 
is about excitement!
Rate how you feel about your partner on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being no 
passion at all, and 10 being passion through the roof). Now, using this same 
scale, rate how you think your partner feels about you — better yet ask your 

257
 Chapter 20: In Intimate Relationships
partner! How do your ratings match up? Are they within a point or two of 
each other, or has one of you said 3 and the other said 9? Do you both feel 
that there’s enough passion in your relationship?
 
Passion doesn’t have to be sex. You can be passionate with your partner in a 
myriad of ways.
 
If one or both of you feels that there isn’t enough passion in your relation-
ship, I recommend reading Sex For Dummies, by Dr. Ruth Westheimer (Wiley). 
There you can find ways to bring more passion into your relationship, so that 
you’re both satisfied.
Shared interests
The best thing about having a partner who shares your interests is that you 
have a built-in playmate, someone to enjoy life with. My brother Gene and his 
wife, Syl, are a great example of this. They’ve been married for 50 years and 
they’ve enjoyed the same activities, activities that give their lives meaning 
and pleasure. Early on, they both bowled in a league; they were both in the 
Masonic Order (she was in the Eastern Star, he was a Shriner); and they spent 
many hours beautifying their yard. They grew exotic orchids. They were both 
heavily involved in Little League baseball when their son was growing up —as 
a coach and announcer at the games. They spent a lot of time bass fishing (my 
brother is still sore that his wife caught the biggest fish!). They go on gambling 
junkets. And they love to travel. They both compete in shuffle-board leagues. 
And, above all else, they’re both collectors — he has his coins and marbles, 
she has her figurines. No wonder they’re a happy couple!
On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 means you and your partner have no shared 
interests, and 10 means you do everything together), rate the degree to 
which you and your partner’s interests overlap. Ask your partner how he or 
she would rate this facet of your relationship.
If you’re on the low end (1 to 4) as far as shared interests go, try cultivating 
an interest in one thing that your partner enjoys. Ask him what he likes about 
that activity and if that’s something he thinks you could learn to like. Learn 
all you can about the activity — the more you know, the more it may appeal 
to you. If he’s an avid golfer and you’re not, maybe you could both work as 
volunteers at a PGA golf tournament in your area — my wife and I have done 
it several times and it’s fun. Or, find a new activity that neither you nor your 
partner have been involved in before but which interests you both. The 
important thing here is not the activity itself, but the fact that it’s an opportu-
nity for the two of you to do something enjoyable together.

Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
Intimacy
When most people see the word intimacy, they immediately think of sex. But 
the kind of intimacy that leads to happiness in a relationship involves much 
more than sex. It means
 
 Having a closeness not found in other relationships
 
 Knowing the other person’s secrets — secret wishes, desires, fear, and 
vulnerabilities
 
 Being cozy, warm, friendly, and comfortable
 
 Sharing confidences about things that matter most in life
 
 Communicating in an informal way
 
 Allowing each other to penetrate your innermost selves
 
 Sharing yourselves emotionally
 
 Knowing everything there is to know about each other
 
 Letting your guard down — and trusting that your partner won’t take 
advantage of you
 
 Thinking of the two of you as “one”
On a scale of 1 to 10 (where 1 is no intimacy at all, and 10 is absolutely inti-
mate), how would your rate your relationship? Ask your partner to rate your 
relationship, too.
If your relationship is short on intimacy, make a point of having some time 
alone with each other (That’s right — no kids!) every day. For example, take a 
short walk together after dinner — 30 minutes tops. Once a month, just the two 
of you go away somewhere “special” to catch up on what’s going on in each 
other’s lives. Spend 10 minutes of time cozying up to one another after you 
wake up in the morning and before you begin another busy day — or, take the 
last 10 minutes of the day right before you go to sleep to do the same thing.  
 
Intimacy doesn’t require a lot of talk — just holding each other quietly for a 
few minutes can speak volumes about how you feel about each other.
Avoiding the Dreaded “C” 
Word: Contempt
John Gottman, psychologist and author of 10 Lessons to Transform Your 
Marriage (Crown Publishers), believes that one aspect of communication 
between married couples inevitably leads to irreconcilable unhappiness and 
the ultimate downfall of the relationship: contempt. If you treat your partner 

259
 Chapter 20: In Intimate Relationships
with contempt (saying things like, “You’re a fool!”, “You make me sick to my 
stomach,” “I don’t know what I ever thought I saw in you in the first place,” or 
“I must have been out of my mind to want to marry you.”), all you can expect 
in return is unhappiness. Why? Because people who are on the receiving end 
of contempt feel humiliated, embarrassed, rejected, and demeaned — hardly 
a recipe for happiness.
 
Contempt involves criticism that is both hostile and conveys a feeling of dis-
gust (translated: You do not please me!). It also communicates an utter lack of 
respect for your partner — which is why, for example, you roll your eyes when 
she is talking to you about herself. Contempt is frequently seen in one-sided 
relationships where one party feels superior to the other. And, it has a number 
of negative effects on how you treat your partner, such as the following:
 
 Contempt will keep you from acting in a caring manner towards your 
partner.
 
 Contempt will cause you to treat your partner uncivilly.
 
 Contempt will prevent you from comforting your partner or her from 
comforting you.
 
 Contempt will stop you from acting with compassion towards your 
loved one.
 
 Contempt will rule out any hope of your complimenting your partner for 
something she has done in your behalf.
 
 Contempt makes your partner think you are unconcerned about his 
welfare.
 
 Contempt is the opposite of cordial — welcoming, good-natured, polite.
 
 Contempt flies in the face of courteous behavior.
According to Gottman, the antidote to contemptuous behavior lies in observ-
ing your partner more closely and looking for something she’s doing right. 
Find something you can admire in her — maybe she’s an unusually truthful 
person, someone who’s kind to strangers, or she makes a mean cherry pie. 
And, once you find it, let her know that you appreciate that part of her. By 
doing so, you elevate her status in your eyes which slowly-but-surely lessens 
that feeling of superiority that I mentioned earlier. The more you see her as 
an equal, the more you will admire her and she you.
Making Empathy the Norm
Empathy — the ability to walk in another person’s shoes — is the key to a 
happy relationship. An empathetic relationship is one in which each part-
ner makes every effort to know what’s going on in the mind and heart of the 
other. Empathy makes all these other things — acceptance, appreciation, 

260
Part V: Achieving Happiness in Key Relationships 
forbearance, forgiveness, tolerance, and understanding — possible. Empathy 
sometimes means giving your partner a second chance. Empathy can open 
the door for alternative explanations as to why people in relationships 
behave the way they do — for example, “She’s not really mad — she’s prob-
ably just tired. After all, she works hard all day, just like I do.”
Nearly all people in intimate relationships have moments of empathy here 
and there, but for many people empathy is more the exception than the 
norm. With happy couples, empathy is the norm. It’s consistent, predictable, 
and expected.
In the following sections, I fill you in on the two main types of empathy and 
how you can ensure they’re a part of your relationship.
Emotional empathy
Former president Bill Clinton scored some major political points when he 
spoke the now famous words: “I feel your pain.” Human beings love that type 
of emotional empathy — having someone able to relate to how they feel. It’s 
a form of emotional validation. When I work with chronic-pain patients, who 
show evidence of tremendous suffering — anger, bitterness, despair — I 
always say to them, “Of course, you feel upset and misunderstood. Of course, 
you’re frustrated and aggravated. Of course, you feel like none of your doc-
tors believe you. I would, too, if I were in your shoes.” I mean those words — 
and they know that I mean it. Communicating my emotional empathy to my 
clients gives me a lot of credibility that I wouldn’t have otherwise.
 
If you want to score some major marital points, listen to what your partner is 
saying. If your partner says, “I’m tired,” hear your partner’s voice. Instead of 
defending yourself against your partner’s feelings, by saying something like, 
“It’s not my fault you’re tired” or, “What am I supposed to do about it?” say 
something like, “Of course, you’re tired. Of course, you’re upset. Of course, 
you’re anxious.” And mean what you say.
Rational empathy
Avery D. Weisman, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical 
School, in his wonderful and insightful book The Coping Capacity (Human 
Sciences Press), refers to another type of empathy, one that requires “a 
respect for another person’s irrationality.” He’s talking about rational empa-
thy, which he suggests is a real, authentic desire to view the world through 
the other person’s eyes. Rational empathy doesn’t mean that you necessar-
ily adopt your partner’s way of seeing things — it just means that you try 
to understand and consider it. Rational empathy, in effect, keeps married 
couples from ending up strangers speaking a foreign language.

261
 Chapter 20: In Intimate Relationships
 
To master the art of rational empathy, you must:
 
 Be open-minded
 
 Be considerate when sharing your beliefs and ideas with your partner
 
 Be an active listener
 
 Place no demands on your partner
 
 Be willing to take turns in a discussion, no matter how heated it gets
 
 Let your partner finish his or her thoughts and sentences, without 
interrupting
 
 Be courteous and civil at all times
 
 Be accepting of the fact that there is more than one way to see things
 
 Be respectful of the other person
 
 Know that showing contempt is dangerous
 
Intimacy and empathy go hand in hand. The more you and your partner share 
with one another, and the more you know about one another — beyond just 
the superficial things in life — the easier and more natural it is to “walk in 
their shoes.”
Tending and Befriending: Reaching 
Out to Those You Love
Greg and Cindy have been arguing for hours about his having too much to 
drink at a friend’s wedding. Both are angry and some harsh words have been 
exchanged. “Nag, nag, nag — that’s all you I get from you. I can’t even enjoy 
Empathetic surgeons
Researchers at St. Louis University School of 
Medicine looked at the relationship between 
empathy and explanations for surgical outcome 
among 40 orthopedic surgeons. They found that 
those surgeons who were more empathetic — 
those who tended to adopt the patient’s point 
of view — were less likely to attribute failed 
back surgeries to psychological problems in the 
patient. In other words, they were less likely to 
think it was all in their patients’ heads. That’s 
the kind of surgeon I’d rather have.

myself without you having something to say about it,” says Greg. To which, 
Cindy responds, “Enjoy yourself? Hell, you were just plain drunk!” They’re 
nearing the point where Greg will predictably withdraw from the conversa-
tion and enter a world of silent brooding, while Cindy prepares to seek him 
out, apologize for losing her temper, and assure him that, of course, she 
wants him to enjoy himself.
According to Dr. Shelly E. Taylor, Director of the UCLA Social Neuroscience 
Laboratory, this scenario is all too common in men and women in dealing 
with stress and conflict. Stress triggers the fight-or-flight response in men 
and the tend-and-befriend response in women. Both are driven by sex-linked 
hormones — testosterone for males and oxytocin for females — and both are 
built-in response patterns that have evolved over the history of mankind.
Tending and befriending — reaching out to those you love — comes easy for 
most women. It’s their nature. And it goes a long way toward easing marital 
tensions and making for a secure and happy relationship. In other words, the 
fact that I’ve been happily married for over 40 years has more to do with my 
wife than it does with me. Like most men, my natural tendency has always 
been to attack or cut and run when things get too heated.
But men can learn to tend and befriend. And so can women for whom tending 
and befriending doesn’t come naturally.
Not exactly what she wanted to hear
I had a client who found a lump in her breast, 
had it biopsied, and went to her doctor to find 
out if whether was malignant. Her husband 
volunteered to go along for support. However, 
when they were told that the test was posi-
tive for cancer and she would have to have a 
mastectomy, her husband reacted angrily and 
caused a scene in the doctor’s office. To make 
matters worse, when they went home to digest 
the news, her husband got drunk and spent the 
rest of the day blaming her for her cancer. He 
actually said, “We really don’t need this right 
now — the expense and all — and besides you 
should’ve taken better care of yourself!” This 
was not at all what this poor woman wanted to 
hear as she faced the choice between death 
and disfigurement.
You and your partner may not have faced any-
thing as serious as cancer, or you may have 
faced situations just as serious. Either way, you 
have the power, in every situation, to be either 
the kind of person your partner can depend on 
as a source of strength, or the kind of person 
who adds to your partner’s pain. You can get 
ready for moments as difficult as this one by 
being there for your partner in the more ordi-
nary, day-to-day struggles. That way, when a 
crisis arises, you’ll have gotten in all kinds of 
practice, and you’ll be supportive without even 
having to think about it.

263
 Chapter 20: In Intimate Relationships
 
Tending and befriending others involves five main elements of social behavior:
 
 Be sympathetic or empathetic toward your partner. For example, you 
can say, “I know you’re scared — so am I. But we’ll get through this.”
 
 Don’t be afraid to reach out and make physical contact. Giving your 
partner a hug, patting her on the back, holding her hand — all these 
things signal to your partner that you’re in her corner and she’s not alone.
 
 Ask your partner, “Are you okay?” That one question helps your part-
ner begin to feel better. And it opens the door for him to share what’s in 
his heart.
 
 Be optimistic. People need support most when they feel helpless and 
hopeless. They need someone to tell them that better times are ahead. 
You can be that someone for your partner.
 
 Focus on your partner’s needs, not your own. Make whatever you say 
and do about your partner. For example, don’t start out by saying, “Your 
getting upset only upsets me. It only makes me feel guilty, like I haven’t 
done something I should have.” Trust me, that’s really not what your 
partner wants to hear.
Identifying the Three Most Important 
Words in a Relationship
I bet you thought I was going to say the three most important words in a rela-
tionship are “I love you.” Even more important are the words, “I am sorry.” 
These three words can do more for a relationship than any others. Whether 
Asking the crucial question: 
Are you enjoying the journey?
Most of us have it backwards when it comes 
to intimate relationships. They see the relation-
ship as the destination — when they’re single, 
they think, “If I just had a partner, everything 
would be okay.” So they do everything they can 
to find a partner as quickly as they can. After 
they’re in a relationship, they can relax — from 
that point on, they figure, things will take care of 
themselves, right? Wrong! A relationship isn’t 
a destination — it’s a journey. For some, it’s a 
reasonably smooth journey that lasts a lifetime; 
for others, it’s an all-too-brief and rather rocky 
journey that ends in a breakup or divorce.
The question that couples should ask them-
selves over and over throughout their relation-
ship is: “Are we enjoying the journey?” If the 
answer is yes, then you’re happy. If the answer 
is, “Um, I’m not sure,” “Well, sort of,” or “No,” 
then you’re not.

it’s “I’m sorry I was so selfish,” “I’m sorry I hurt your feelings,” “I’m sorry I 
forgot about our anniversary,” or “I’m sorry I had too much to drink at the 
wedding,” saying you’re sorry communicates to your partner that you accept 
responsibility for your part of the relationship and that you take ownership 
for any transgressions you bring to it.
And that’s really the basis of all mature relationships — accepting responsi-
bility for your own actions. Even the most childish and irresponsible people 
in the world can say, “I love you” and mean it. But it takes a real adult to say, 
“I’m sorry.” Which are you?
Love isn’t enough
My parents tried unsuccessfully for 23 years to 
find happiness in their marriage. It was difficult, 
to be sure, given the fact that my father was an 
alcoholic with a short temper and my mother 
could give as good as she got when they were 
fighting, which was most of the time. What I 
think was wrong in this up-and-down relation-
ship was the fact that both of them were too 
proud and too stubborn to say to the other, “I’m 
sorry.” I never heard either one of them utter 
those all-important words — and I think that’s 
why their marriage ended in divorce.
It isn’t enough to love your partner. You need to 
accept responsibility for your faults, your mis-
takes, the negatives you bring to the relation-
ship. When you do that, your relationship has a 
good chance of surviving.

I
 offer ten quick strategies for raising a happy child (no 
small task!) and ten personal habits that adolescents 
and adults can employ in their efforts to become happier 
people. Achieving happiness is not only about knowing 
what to do, but also about avoiding possible certain road-
blocks and pitfalls that lead to unhappiness. In this part, I 
point out those roadblocks so you can dodge them.

eing a parent is an incredibly challenging job, especially when it comes 
to your child’s emotional development. When they’re born, most 
children appear to be happy: They smile and coo — evidence of how satisfied 
they are with the nourishment and comfort provided by their parents. But 
this soon begins to change as their lives become more complex and their 
needs grow. The childish anger that typically emerges by the third month of 
life is the child’s way of communicating that, from his perspective, the parent 
is failing to meet his needs.
Although most infants are happy, maintaining that happiness throughout 
childhood and adolescence and into adulthood isn’t a given. For the most 
part, if children aren’t happy, it’s not because they’re bad or have some 
major psychological problem — it’s because they haven’t been taught how to 
be happy. And if they’re not happy when they’re children, you can bet they 
won’t be happy as adults. As a parent, one of the greatest gifts you can give 
your child is the gift of knowing how to be happy. Helping your child learn 
what it takes to achieve happiness is a parental gift that keeps on giving.
In this chapter, I show you ten ways to teach your child how to be happy on 
his own — without relying exclusively on you for his happiness. Teaching 
your child how to be happy is no different from teaching him to use the 
bathroom, tie his shoes, or ride a bike — all skills that are best learned early 
in life.
Make Sure Your Message Gets Through
If you want to teach your child something, you need to put yourself in her 
world — and recognize that her world is different from yours. Your kid is not 

268
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
a “little adult” who, though smaller in stature, is fully capable of understand-
ing grown-up ideas and language and following grown-up commands.
 
Listen to your child and adapt your language to hers. If you’re trying to teach 
her that being satiated is a good thing — and one of the key ingredients to 
happiness (see Chapter 2) — tell her, “Being satiated means the same thing as 
being full, honey, like when you’re full of ice cream. It means you don’t need 
any more.”
 
If your child can’t understand you, he can’t learn from you. I once had a 
neighbor — an engineer — who shared with me that he had explained to his 
2-year-old son the difference between AC and DC electricity so that he 
wouldn’t stick his finger in the wall socket anymore. A 2-year-old doesn’t 
understand — or need to understand — the finer points of electrical wiring. 
He just needs to know not to stick his finger in the wall socket. Focus on the 
message you’re trying to convey to your child, and then figure out the best 
way — not the most complicated way or the most technical way — to convey 
that message.
Be Your Child’s Emotional Coach
Nowadays, kids have all sorts of coaches — football coaches, gymnastics 
coaches, soccer coaches, people who coach them to get higher SAT scores, 
and coaches for the high school debate team. Regardless of the sport or 
subject, a coach is there to help kids become successful and competitive. 
What many kids seem to lack, however, is someone to coach them on their 
feelings — anger, fear, sadness, and happiness — and what to do with them.
That’s where parents come in. As the first and potentially most influential 
adult in your child’s life, you have a unique opportunity to be his emotional 
coach. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
 Make raising a happy child your primary goal. Put happiness ahead of 
other important goals — such as education, athleticism, popularity — all 
of which contribute to your kid’s success but do not, by themselves, 
make for a happy child. Not sure about that? Take a look at all the 
unhappy, troubled, young celebrities and professional athletes — not to 
mention all the grade-anxious adolescents heading off to prestigious 
universities in hopes of making their parents proud — and you’ll see the 
truth in what I’m saying.
 
 Be active and hands-on when you’re interacting with your child. 
Rearing a child is no time to be passive! Take your kid places where 

269
 Chapter 21:  Ten Ways to Raise a Happy Child
you’re happy and explain to him what it is about this place that creates 
positive feelings for you. For example, if you’re happy at the beach, take 
your child there and say something like, “I’m so happy when I’m at the 
beach, because I can swim and read and be with my family, and those 
are my favorite things to do.” Ask him where he thinks he would be 
happy — at the movies? the zoo? — and take him there.
 
 Do the same with activities. For example, if you enjoy reading, take your 
child to a local bookstore or the library and let him share in your plea-
sure as you browse about the store. If you love the smell of a new book 
(come on, who doesn’t?), find a book you like, open it up, put your nose 
inside and take a big whiff. Then ask your child if he’d like to smell it, 
too. Show him book covers you like and see if he can find book covers 
that he likes, too. It doesn’t matter if your child can read and under-
stand all the words in the book — you can still find ways to share 
the experience.
 
 Find games your child wants to play and play with him — don’t just tell 
him to find a friend or sibling to play with. Kids love it when their 
Happy days
Believe it or not, from my entire childhood, I 
have memories of just two happy days with my 
parents — one day I spent with my mom, the 
other I spent with my dad.
With my mother, it was on my tenth birthday. 
She managed to get rid of all the other children 
for a whole day, which she spent talking with 
me, letting me help her around the house, and 
letting me help make my own seven-layer 
birthday cake. It was a masterpiece in the 
making — we carefully stacked each layer, one 
on top of the other, as they came out of the 
oven, cementing them together with mint-green 
icing, until it was complete. The cake was 
beautiful, but what was even more beautiful 
was the fact that I had my mother all to myself 
for one day in my life and she seemed happier 
than I had ever seen her.
The day I spent with my father was just as 
memorable. He was a fisherman, but he rarely 
let us kids go along with him. Mostly, fishing 
was his time to relax, forget all the stresses of 
his life (including a family he couldn’t afford!), 
and drink a lot of beer. For some inexplicable 
reason, one day he up and announced that I 
could come along with him. Talk about 
surprised! The day was more than I expected. 
My father sat on the bank and fished. He didn’t 
really interact with me all that much, but he let 
me run around freely playing and entertaining 
myself. He gave me money to buy food and 
drinks (a rare thing, indeed). He was in an 
uncharacteristically good mood — no yelling or 
criticizing. And, for once, he didn’t seem to be in 
a hurry to move on to something else. He 
seemed happy, content — which allowed me to 
feel the same.
I’m grateful for those two days. They may not 
seem like much to you, but they meant — and 
continue to mean — the world to me.

270
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
parents get down on the floor with them and play. Talk with your child 
about the happiest, best times in your life (see Chapter 8), so he can 
begin wanting to experience such times himself.
 
 Be proactive. Don’t wait until you see that you child is unhappy before 
you do something about it. Be ahead of the curve. Get your child up 
early on Saturday morning and say, with all kinds of enthusiasm, “Let’s 
go have a really happy day — just you and me!” Be like Brando in The 
Godfather, and make the kid an offer he can’t refuse! I guarantee you, 
he’ll remember that day for the rest of his life.
Distinguish between Needs and Wants
Human needs are few: air, water, food, shelter — things that directly contri-
bute to survival. The rest of life is made up of wants. Your kid may want to 
get along with her peers, want to do well in school, or want to spend endless 
hours playing video games. Believe it or not, every kid wants to find some 
way to elicit the love and approval of her parents. All children want that — 
even when they say they don’t or act as if that’s the farthest thing from 
their minds.
Your job as a parent is to help your child find acceptable and effective ways 
to satisfy her wants so she can have some hope of being happy. You need 
to show her which wants — to be the “boss” in children’s games, getting a 
new toy every time she goes to the mall, having the last word in family 
discussions — will not bring joy to her life. (Chapters 2 and 3 give you the 
background you need to have this kind of conversation.)
Show Your Child That Generosity 
Begins at Home
The smallest of children can learn the joy of giving. At the holidays, when you 
see people ringing the bell for the Salvation Army, give your little one a little 
money to put in the kettle, and let him be the one to drop it in. (Put some 
money in yourself, too, so he sees that giving is something you value, too.) If 
your family attends church or temple, give your child some coins to place in 
the offering plate — and make sure he sees you putting money in the plate as 
well.

271
 Chapter 21:  Ten Ways to Raise a Happy Child
By the way, giving isn’t just a religious thing. If you don’t attend religious 
services, you can use the same principle to donate to charities. For example, 
every time you give your child his allowance, you can talk to him about 
charities that he may want to donate some of his allowance to. You can even 
use this as an opportunity to talk to your child about the things that matter 
to him. If he’s an animal lover, maybe he’d like to give a portion of his 
allowance to the local Humane Society or the ASPCA. If he’s a pint-size 
environmentalist, maybe he’d like to donate to Greenpeace or the Sierra Club.
Generosity involves not only giving material things, but also giving your time 
and attention. Be generous toward your child by allotting him at least as 
much time as you spend preparing meals, washing clothes, or talking with 
family and friends on the phone. If you’re eating with your child in a restau-
rant, turn off the cellphone and make him the center of your universe. (Over 
the years, I’ve noticed that, without fail, the kids who misbehave the most in 
restaurants are those who are ignored by their parents.)
Engage in generous activities as a family. You can volunteer to work at a soup 
kitchen one afternoon a month, or you can help out at the local animal shel-
ter. If you have an older person in your neighborhood, suggest to your child 
that he offer to rake the neighbor’s leaves or shovel her driveway.
And when your child does something generous — whether that’s offering 
to help you empty the dishwasher or giving some of his allowance to a 
charity — be sure to let him know how proud you are of him. You may be 
surprised by how happy your child is to get your approval. This is how you 
teach generosity — and generosity leads to happiness.
Who’s the rich one?
As a parent, it’s hard to know for certain 
whether you’ve done a good job in raising your 
kids. You hope so, but you’re always looking for 
a sign that you’ve done your job well. My son, 
Chris — a wonderful young man — told me a 
story that was truly an affirmation of everything 
his mother and I had done over the years to 
build a happy, functional family.
Chris and a college friend were Christmas 
shopping, and Chris was apparently buying 
some unique, thoughtful, and fairly costly gifts 
(at least for his budget!). His friend — who 
came from a wealthy family — asked him, “Why 
are you buying such nice gifts for your family? 
Why are you going to so much trouble?” Chris 
laughed and said, “Because they’re my family 
and I love them.”
The other boy had no response — he looked 
confused. That was one of those watershed 
moments when my son began to appreciate 
why he was so much happier than his friend, 
despite the differences in their respective 
pocketbooks.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Teach Your Child Mastery
The most unhappy children I’ve seen in my life are the middle school and 
high school kids I interact with in my anger-management classes. It doesn’t 
take a rocket scientist to understand why they’re so angry toward everyone 
they encounter: They’re lost children; misfits in a world where all the other 
kids are good at something — academics, sports, making friends — and 
they’re not. The saddest thing, though, is that these kids know they’re misfits! 
They have no discernable adaptive skills, they’re not aware of their own 
talents, they’ve never been taught how to problem-solve — so, all that’s left 
is their anger. They are, in effect, the masters of anger.
 
It’s as simple as this: Your job as a parent is to teach your child to be good at 
something. Here are just some of the things you can help your child be a 
master of:
 
 Reading: Reading is a lifelong source of joy for many people. Read to 
your child — even after she’s learned to read herself. Remember: Don’t 
just buy your child books; ask her about the books she’s reading.
 
 My editor remembers falling in love with the Anne of Green Gables series 
when she was a child, telling her grandma how much she loved the 
books, and being delighted when her grandma read the books, too, just 
so she could share the experience.
 
 Writing: This can include everything from having good penmanship to 
learning proper grammar to telling good stories. At its most basic level, 
writing is important as a form of communication. But when kids get into 
writing poems or short stories, it can be a great source of happiness.
 
 Playing well with others: Kids need to learn to get along with others. 
They need to learn to follow rules, learn what “fair play” means, and 
learn to take turns — all of which can be learned from playing games. 
Children who end up succeeding in life have mastered the art of cooper-
ation — being a team player. Kids who cheat and are always crying 
“foul” when they don’t get their way will be doing the exact same thing 
as adults later on in life.
 
 Being interested in what other children want or like: All children start 
out as the center of their own universe. They expect others — parents 
and kids alike — to be interested in what they want, which is reasonable 
up to a point. But your child also needs to appreciate that the world is 
full of lots of different people whose interests also need to be consid-
ered. That’s the real value of having brothers and sisters or playmates 
from next door — the child learns to share the world. Explain to your 
little one that “as bright as the sun is, it is only one planet in the entire 
universe,” and so it is with human beings.

273
 Chapter 21:  Ten Ways to Raise a Happy Child
 
 Coloring within the lines: When kids learn to color within the lines, 
they’re setting the stage for good organizational skills later on in life.
 
 
Coloring outside the lines is okay, too. If your child has an interest in 
art — whether drawing or painting or clay or papier-mâché — encourage 
that! If you don’t have a creative bone in your body, check in with the art 
teacher at your child’s school and get some ideas for things you can do 
to help your child have more fun with art at home. Or sign her up for art 
classes at your local art center or community center.
 
 Studying: Keep the focus here on having good study skills — for exam-
ple, getting homework done before watching TV or playing video games, 
knowing how to prepare for a test, and taking notes in class or on read-
ing assignments. If your child has good study skills, and she works hard 
at school, that’s all that matters.
 
 I’ve always seen schools as an arena where children first learn to 
achieve success, but I can’t stand those bumper stickers that say, My 
Child Is an Honor Roll Student at Such-and-Such School. I want to yell 
out the window, “Sure, teach your child to want to achieve great things 
in school. But for goodness’ sake, be proud of her even when she doesn’t 
make it to the top of the academic ladder, as long as she puts forth her 
best effort.” (The problem is, I’ve never found a red light that was long 
enough for me to say all that!)
 
 Being respectful of others: A disrespectful child will grow up to be a 
disrespectful husband, neighbor, and employee. Respect is just another 
way of saying “I value you and what you do.” Start by always saying 
“please” when you want your child to do something and “thank you” 
when she does it. Respect her opinion when it differs from you own — 
just because she disagrees doesn’t mean she’s an idiot. Respect is also 
about boundaries. Teach your child that it’s never okay to open another 
person’s mail, get in his mother’s purse, rummage through his sister’s 
dresser drawers, or take things that don’t belong to him. All of us have a 
right to both privacy and ownership.
 
 Playing sports: It doesn’t have to be anything super-competitive — 
Ping-Pong will do.
 
 Leading: Leaders aren’t born — they’re made. That’s not to say that 
some kids don’t initiate activities more than others; they do. But 
leadership skills and attitudes can be developed in all children. The best 
thing parents can do is give kids opportunities to lead — it can be as 
simple as telling a child, “You’re in charge of the family today — you 
choose how we’re going to spend our day.”
 
 Playing a musical instrument: If you don’t play an instrument yourself, 
you can still talk to your child about which instruments she likes and get 
her started with lessons or let her play in the school band or orchestra.

274
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Competing: You want your child to have a healthy perspective on com-
petition. It’s great for her to want to win and to work hard to excel, but 
you need to teach her that competition can be unhealthy, too. Winning 
isn’t everything, and competing with honor is key. (See the next section, 
“Help Your Child Be a Happy Loser,” for more on this.)
 
Nobody can be a master of everything. Look for your child’s natural interests 
and strengths and work to help her develop those. Of course, you still want to 
introduce her to new activities and help her get better at the things she’s not 
as good at, but don’t expect her to be the next Beethoven if she hates the 
piano and has no musical aptitude. Also, it’s only natural for you to want to 
share your interests with your child. If you were a jock in high school, maybe 
you’re dying to get your child into sports. The key is to pay attention to her 
interests and be happy yourself when she finds something she’s happy doing.
Help Your Child Be a Happy Loser
 
Don’t let your child grow up thinking that happiness is tied to winning — it’s 
not. But if your child thinks it is, he’ll drive himself nuts by constantly trying to 
win — at anything and everything — and he’ll hate himself and be unhappy 
when he loses. So how do most kids get the crazy idea that winning is 
everything? From their parents. If you charge out onto the ball field and scream 
at your child when he loses a game (or yell at the umpire when he makes a call 
you disagree with), you’re teaching him that winning matters more than 
anything — more than being kind, more than being respectful, more than 
anything. If you don’t teach your child to be a happy loser when he’s young, 
trust me, he’ll be a sore loser when he grows up.
Major-league jerk
When my son was a kid, he played minor-league 
baseball, for 8- to 12-year-olds. At that age, it’s 
all about pitching. If a kid can get the ball over 
the plate, you win. Otherwise, the pitcher walks 
every batter and your team loses big time.
One day, my son’s team was definitely losing 
big time. The boy who was pitching couldn’t get 
the ball anywhere near home plate, and the 
other team was far ahead. Finally, the coach 
came out and pulled the pitcher. The boy’s feel-
ings were understandably hurt and you could 
see he was crying as he headed to the bench. 
When the game ended, all the parents for both 
teams ran out onto the field to either congratu-
late or console their children. The losing pitch-
er’s father went up to his son, said, “I’ll give you 
something to cry about!”, and slapped the boy 
across the face. What a horrible lesson that boy 
learned that day: Winning is everything, and if 
you want to make me happy, you’d better win.

275
 Chapter 21:  Ten Ways to Raise a Happy Child
Some parents believe that it’s wrong — in fact, psychologically damaging — 
to beat their kids at a game. If I had a dollar for every time I heard some 
parent say, “You need to let them win regardless — it’s how you build 
self-esteem,” I’d be a much richer man today. Of course, you want your child 
to learn to win, but it’s just as important to show him that losing isn’t the end 
of the world.
Encourage All Forms of Play
Play is a major source of happiness for children as well as adults. Not only 
does it make children happy, but it serves as the foundation of a human 
being’s social development. The lessons people learn from childhood play 
highly influence their adult social lives.
But play doesn’t come in just one form. Here are the main forms of happiness:
 
 Solitary play: Sitting quietly and entertaining herself with some object 
or age-appropriate activity (like coloring). Kids between 2 and 5 years 
old frequently engage in this nonsocial type of play. Children who are 
comfortable with solitary play end up as adults who are comfortable 
with solitude and don’t feel lonely when they’re alone.
 
 Parallel play: Playing alongside another child. During this same time 
period, kids may start to play together but still engage in separate 
activities. For example, two children may play in a sandbox, each doing 
her own thing.
 
 Associative play: Playing with another child. As children grow older and 
enter their preschool years, they may interact with one another when 
they play (for example, playing house or school).
Children also need to be exposed to competitive play (including sports, such 
as baseball or soccer) as well as cooperative play (where they work together, 
such as putting together puzzles). They need to play at games with rules 
(like board games) and without rules (drawing a picture). As a parent, you 
should encourage all forms of child play.
Allow for Imperfections
At any age, striving for perfection can be burdensome, to put it mildly. 
Perfection is an ideal, not a reality. If you insist on having a perfect child, 
you’ll only end up disappointed and unhappy — and your child will see that 
disappointment in your eyes.

276
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
All human beings (including you!) have flaws, warts, frailties, and imperfec-
tions that, along with certain unique talents, define our personalities. So many 
young people in today’s world are literally killing themselves (suicide among 
adolescents is on the rise) trying to live up to their parents’ unrealistic and 
unattainable goals. Kids need to know that there is no such thing as perfec-
tion. They need to know that a C isn’t the end of the world. And they need to 
know that if they’re not the most popular kid in school, that doesn’t make 
them a loser.
Bottom line: Your child needs you to give her a break now and then. She 
needs to hear you frequently say, “I love you. No one is perfect.”
Teach Your Child Commitment 
and Perseverance
Two of the most invaluable lessons a parent can teach a child are 
commitment and perseverance. In Chapter 6, I tell you how being a player, 
not a spectator, is one of the three elements of a hardy personality — 
someone who is resilient and self-reliant; fully committed to life. Encourage 
your child to explore possibilities — try out for the track team; try out for the 
cheerleading squad; try out for the debate team. Never discourage her by 
saying things like “I don’t think you’d be good at that” or “That’s silly — why 
would you want to do that?” If she keeps trying to find the right fit — which 
takes commitment — she eventually will.
Perseverance means not being a quitter. You need to give your child a 
chance to finish something important, to feel the sense of pride and accom-
plishment that only comes at the end, and to be happy with himself as a 
result. A lot of adolescents who head off to college want to come home 
(and stay) sometime during their first semester because “It’s too hard and 
I’m not making the grades I made in high school.” (If you think that’s uncom-
mon, just ask any college administrator.) Parents should be encouraging, not 
accommodating — tell them they need to stay and work things out. In most 
cases, that’s just what they’ll do and they’ll thank you later on (and so will 
the college — it needs your tuition dollars!).
Let Your Child See You Happy
Emotions are contagious. If your child sees you looking sad and unhappy all 
the time, she’ll most likely end up feeling the same way. The good news is 
that the same is true for happiness: If your kid sees that you’re happy, she’ll 

277
 Chapter 21:  Ten Ways to Raise a Happy Child
likely be happier herself. Children need to see you smile (see Chapter 12), 
they need to hear you laugh, and they need to hear you say, “Today’s a 
happy day!” once in a while.
 
Scientists call the contagiousness of emotions emotional mimicry.
Al was almost 40 years old when he came in for counseling. I asked him what 
problems he was having and he said, “I’m not sure. I just don’t seem to be as 
happy as most of my friends, even though I have a better job and more 
creature comforts than some of them. We go out and do things socially and 
they laugh and seem to enjoy themselves, while I sit there and watch. I feel 
somehow disconnected from what they’re all about.” When I asked Al, 
“Would you say your parents were happy people, angry people, or anxious 
people?”, he said,
Truthfully, I don’t know. They rarely showed any emotion around me. I 
remember lots of times when we ate dinner and my mother would talk to 
me and then my father would talk to me, but they wouldn’t look at or talk 
to one another. Sometimes they would go weeks without talking and just 
leave notes for each another. Our house was always pretty quiet and I 
spent a lot of time in my room.
Al had no recollection whatsoever of either of his parents ever looking 
happy. It’s not surprising that he was having trouble being happy, too.
 
Kids are like sponges: They soak up everything around them. The single 
greatest things you can do to help your kids be happy throughout their lives 
are to be happy yourself, and to share your happiness with them.

A
chieving happiness is a journey, and as with any journey, there are 
many potholes and roadblocks along the way. Think of this chapter as 
a big orange cone, giving you enough warning to swerve out of the way.
An Unrealistic Sense of Self
You can easily tell that Jenna and Jamie are sisters — they’re both brunettes, 
they have the same laugh, and they both love pizza. But when it comes to 
personality, they couldn’t be more different. Jenna sees herself as “super-
woman,” able to succeed at anything she sets her mind to, and she expects 
perfection in herself and others. She’s brimming with self-confidence and 
what I describe in Chapter 5 as exuberant optimism. Jamie, on the other 
hand, has a much more negative view of herself — she downplays her abili-
ties and constantly looks at life as a glass half-empty. Neither, unfortunately, 
has an accurate sense of self. Jenna overestimates what she’s capable of, 
while Jamie underestimates her abilities. And this is why neither one is happy.
No matter what — or how much — she accomplishes, it’s never enough for 
Jenna. She always expects more of herself: “I should’ve studied more for that 
test and then I would’ve gotten an A+ instead of an A–.” Her bar for success 
is ever-increasing and always seems to be just beyond her reach, leaving 
her frustrated more often than not. Jamie has the opposite problem — she 
feels inadequate because she hasn’t enjoyed enough success in life. Why? 
Because she’s constantly selling herself short: “I shouldn’t have tried out 
for that job — I knew I wouldn’t get it.” By doing so, Jamie is denying herself 
opportunities to appreciate her many strengths.

Start listening to yourself. How often do you think or say the word should? 
According to cognitive psychologists, should is one of the most toxic words 
in everyday language. It conveys people’s expectations of themselves and 
others: “She shouldn’t do that,” “He should keep his mouth shut,” or “I’m such 
an idiot — I should’ve known better.” It also guides people’s behavior, making 
them want to do more (or less) than they’re capable of and less than what 
would make them happy.
Entitlement
A sense of entitlement — a feeling that you have a right to something — is the 
root cause of most people’s unhappiness. Parents are unhappy when they 
don’t get the love and respect from their kids that they think they’re entitled 
to. Husbands are unhappy when they don’t get all the sex they think they’re 
entitled to from their wives, and wives feel just as unhappy when there’s too 
little intimacy in the marriage. Employees feel unhappy when they fail to get 
the raise they feel entitled to, the promotion, or the freedom to take a day off 
from work whenever it suits them. Employers are unhappy if their workers 
don’t put forth effort they believe they’re entitled to.
 
Here are some things you are not entitled to:
 
 A spouse who always thinks as you do
 
 Children who always love you
 
 Employment — now or in the future
 
 Good health and a long life
 
 A computer that never crashes
 
 Cheap gasoline
 
 The respect and admiration of your peers
 
 A stable economy
 
 A car that starts on a cold morning
If you think you’re entitled to those things — and more — you may as well 
forget being happy. Instead, get used to feeling miserable.
 
Think of life as a never-ending series of negotiations. Work to earn the respect 
you want, instead of demanding it. Work for that promotion — don’t just wait 
to receive your entitlement. Negotiate ways to be happy in your marriage — 
make it more about give and take and try to appreciate your spouse’s needs as 
well as your own.

281
 Chapter 22: Ten Roadblocks to Happiness
Toxic Anger
Being happy when you’re angry all the time is impossible. And that’s what 
toxic anger is — experiencing intense anger on a daily basis. Anger is not 
inherently bad, but it can lead to health problems, unemployment, legal 
difficulties, financial woes, and dysfunctional relationships when you have too 
much of it. When it comes to anger, you need to think in moderation — it’s 
fine to get irritated or just plain mad, but rage is always a problem.
 
Here are some things you can do to manage your anger better and prevent it 
from being a roadblock to happiness:
 
 Ventilate more and vent less. Venting is about blowing up and losing 
your cool. Ventilation is what you do when you let your anger breathe, 
when you talk about your feelings in a reasonable and civil manner.
 
 Manage your stress better. Not everything in life is a catastrophe. Most 
of what you encounter on a daily basis has to do with manageable prob-
lems — so if it’s broke, fix it!
 
 Let go of the angry past. I have a rule that if I haven’t worn a piece of 
clothing for three years, it’s time to give it away. The same should be 
true of old anger. If you’re still angry about something that happened 
long ago, find a way to forgive and forget. Unburden yourself from the 
past and free yourself up to deal with the emotions of today.
 
 Confess you anger. Spend 15 minutes a day writing down all your 
negative feelings — anger, hurt, sadness — read what you wrote, and 
then literally throw away the piece of paper. This simple act can help 
you prevent your anger from one day to the next.
 
 Assert yourself. Don’t be a doormat, letting other people walk all over 
you. On the other hand, don’t aggressively attack everybody who does 
something you don’t like. Find the middle ground where you stand up 
for yourself without answering anger with anger.

Management For Dummies (Wiley).
Resentment
Resentment is the residual of unexpressed, unresolved anger. It’s like the 
stain that you see in a cup when you never finish drinking the coffee, the 
carbon that builds up in an automobile engine, or the creosote that lines your 

282
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
chimney when you burn too much wood too slowly. Resentful people look at 
life through darkened glasses, expecting the worst and being on the ready to 
defend themselves from harm. In effect, yesterday’s anger gets in the way of 
today’s happiness.
When I hear people say, “He’s been angry at me for years,” I correct them by 
telling them that anger is an emotion and, thus, an experience that is time-
limited. Anger comes and goes much like waves on a beach. Staying angry 
very long is physically impossible. What is possible, however, is feeling 
resentment for years, even a lifetime. Emotions come and go, but resentment 
can — if you let it — last forever.
 
Getting angry isn’t always a choice, but letting go of anger is. Based on my 
own research, I’ve concluded that 70 percent of people resolve their anger in 
less than half an hour. If your anger lingers beyond that point, it most likely 
will turn into resentment. Don’t be afraid to tell yourself, “Time’s up,” as you 
approach that 30-minute mark.
Greed
The message of the popular 1987 movie Wall Street couldn’t be clearer than 
when Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) shouts to stockholders, “Greed is 
good!” Gekko believes that greed creates competition, separates the winners 
from the losers, and is what ultimately translates into wealth. He makes a 
compelling case.
But greed also gets in the way of happiness — and for these very same 
reasons. If greed makes you the winner, then everyone else around you — 
family, friends, colleagues — end up feeling like losers. Greed may, in some 
cases, lead to wealth, but as I show you in Chapter 3, wealth does not ensure 
happiness — if it did, I wouldn’t have had so many wealthy people as clients 
over the years. Lastly, greed is all about competition, but happiness comes 
more from cooperation — an effort to act in harmony with the world around 
you.
Greed is not just about ambition (that is, about doing well in some aspect 
of everyday life). Instead, it’s about exuberant ambition — unlimited and 
insatiable ambition — that comes from wanting a bigger slice of the pie than 
anyone else has. Greed is another name for narcissistic ambition, where your 
own self-interests predominate over all others and where you feel entitled to 
be greedy, to take more than your fair share.

283
 Chapter 22: Ten Roadblocks to Happiness
Why do an increasing number of highly paid corporate executives end up in 
prison these days? Are they just another example of stupid crooks? No. What 
they are is greedy — they aren’t satisfied by making millions of dollars a year. 
They want more — and they feel they have the right to take as much as they 
want, no matter how much it hurts other people or destroys the very institu-
tions that made them rich in the first place.
Greed isn’t just about making money. People who are greedy about food end 
up struggling with their weight. People who are greedy about alcohol often 
end up alcoholics. People who are greedy about time tend to overschedule 
their days, having too many appointments in too little time. Those who 
are greedy about communication, tend to do all the talking without letting 
anyone else get a word in.
What are you greedy about? Is it keeping you from finding happiness?
Aggression
Aggression literally means “moving against the world.” Two types of aggressive 
behavior occur between human beings — achievement-driven aggression and 
combative aggression. Achievement-driven aggression can lead to happiness, 
but combative aggression definitely does not.
People who have achievement-driven aggression are
 
 Competitive
 
 Forceful in pursuing their goals
 
 Persistent
 
 Determined
 
 Direct in their communication
People who have combative aggression are
 
 Confrontational
 
 Impatient
 
 Demanding
 
 Intense
 
 Domineering

284
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Achievement-driven aggressiveness often leads to happiness, which is the 
result of a sense of accomplishment that comes from having done a job well. 
It gives you something to be satisfied about and a reason to feel grateful — 
both active ingredients in genuine happiness (see Chapter 2).
Combative aggressiveness, on the other hand, means you’re engaged in 
combat with everything and everyone that comes your way. Combativeness 
is about overpowering people, often as a means toward whatever it is that 
you believe you’re entitled to in life.
Achievement-driven aggression involves competing or fighting for something 
you value, whereas combative aggression always entails competing against 
the world.
 
Take a soul-searching moment and think about the characteristics of these 
two types of aggression. Ask yourself — and be honest — which of these 
attributes best describe you. Are you a mixture of the two or predominantly 
one or the other type of individual? Ask someone who knows you well to rate 
you, too. Maybe you’ll discover something about yourself that you didn’t 
know before — and begin to understand why happiness has eluded you.
Depression
Tens of millions of people worldwide are unable to experience happiness for 
one simple reason: They suffer from depression. Depression is so prevalent 
that it is referred to as the “common cold of mental illness.” When you’re suf-
fering from depression, you’re not just having a bad day. You’re experiencing 
a range of symptoms, including:
 
 Low energy, lethargy, and malaise
 
 Loss of appetite
 
 Sleep disturbance
 
 Spontaneous crying
 
 Irritability
 
 Negative self-image
 
 Guilt
 
 Suicidal thoughts
 
 Diminished sexual interest
 
 Social withdrawal
 
 Loss of pleasure

285
 Chapter 22: Ten Roadblocks to Happiness
The persistence and severity of these symptoms are what define just how 
depressed you are.
 
The psychiatric term for this loss of ability to experience pleasure — which 
prevents you from enjoying everything from food to sex — is anhedonia, a 
condition that may well reflect a breakdown in your brain’s reward system. 
Depression depletes the brain of dopamine, which is vital to the sensation of 
pleasure and, ultimately, happiness.
 
The good news is that depression is a treatable disorder. If you read the list 
of symptoms and realized that you’ve experienced three or more of them 
during the past month, talk to your personal physician or a mental health 
expert. The best time to treat a mood disorder is before it becomes disabling.

ment, turn to Depression For Dummies, by Laura L. Smith, PhD, and Charles H. 
Elliott, PhD [Wiley].)
Loneliness
You can be alone and still be happy, especially if you’ve managed to get 
into flow (see Chapter 8). But loneliness is another matter. Loneliness is an 
absence of an emotional connection with the world around you. You can be 
lonely in the midst of a large gathering of people, and not feel lonely when 
you’re by yourself. Happiness is more about belonging — having meaningful 
social ties to family, friends, and community — than about having money, 
power, and success.
 
Here are some ways you can become a more connected person and ward off 
loneliness:
 
 Be a community volunteer. Try to find activities where you’re actively 
engaging with other volunteers, such as Habitat for Humanity (www.
habitat.org), where you work on building a house. (And you don’t 
even have to know how to pound a nail!)
 
 Become a regular at a local eatery or coffee shop. You can eat or drink 
coffee anywhere, but if you make one place part of your daily routine, 
you’ll start to feel like you belong there — and you’ll get to know the 
other regulars.
 
 Sign up for a course at your local community college or adult educa-
tion center. Taking a class is a great way to make friends and learn at 
the same time.

286
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Get involved in historical reenactments. They’re still fighting the Civil 
War just about every week somewhere in the South, and the Renaissance 
is alive and well at Renaissance fairs throughout the country.
 
 Sign up for a yoga class. You’ll be able to be in the company of other 
people without having to be “on” the whole time.
 
 Join a local theater group. If acting isn’t your thing, paint scenery, sell 
tickets, or work as an usher.
 
 Join a civic group, such as the Junior League, the Lion’s Club, or the 
Optimists Club.
 
 Become a member of a hobby club, like a knitting group or a camera 
club. You can learn, play, and socialize all at once.
 
 Attend religious services and enjoy the fellowship.
Vindictiveness
Are you one of those people who believes in an “eye for an eye”? When 
you get angry, do you say things like, “You’ll get yours — I’ll see to it,” 
“Remember, what goes around comes around,” or “ Your time will come — 
you just wait”? If so, like it or not, you have a vindictive streak.
Simply put, vindictiveness is about getting even, settling scores, answer-
ing one hurt or insult with another. On the surface it’s about anger — and, 
expressing anger in some vengeful manner. But vindictiveness is really about 
hurt and pain. Vindictive people think that by hurting the person who caused 
them pain — whether physical or emotional — they’ll somehow feel better. 
The problem is, they won’t!
 
As far as I know, forgiveness is the only antidote to vindictiveness. At some 
point, you have to say to yourself, “I forgive that person for hurting me. What 
she did was wrong, but I forgive her. I won’t forget what she did, but I forgive 
her.” Repetition counts, so say that to yourself as many times as it takes to let 
go of the hurt.
 
Keep in mind that forgiveness isn’t easy. It’s a choice you make — no one can 
make you forgive another human being. It takes time. And it requires support 
and demands sacrifice — for example, you have to give up being the victim, 
you have to quit insisting that life has to be fair, and you have to surrender 
your right to revenge. (If you’re having trouble forgiving, check out Anger 
Management For Dummies [Wiley], where I go into more depth on the subject.)

 Chapter 22: Ten Roadblocks to Happiness
Drug Abuse
Patients in an ever-growing number of drug and alcohol treatment facilities 
throughout the world are learning one immutable truth: Chemicals are no 
substitute for real happiness. The euphoric high that accompanies drug use 
is only momentary and is more an illusion that a reality. Drugs don’t make 
you feel safe. They don’t generate a sense of satisfaction, gratitude, or sere-
nity — each an essential ingredient to happiness. And, of course, there are 
the predictable negative consequences — just ask an alcoholic the morning 
after a drinking binge.
Drugs are, for many people, a form of self-medication, used in an attempt to 
escape feelings of chronic unhappiness associated with mood disorders such 
as depression, pathological anxiety, and even boredom. I know because for 
several years I worked in an inpatient drug-rehab program and I saw what 
happens when people begin to detox — it isn’t a pretty sight.
 
If you’re consuming more than two alcoholic drinks per day (one if you’re 
female) and/or you typically have more than four drinks at one sitting (three 
if you’re female), you do not qualify as a responsible drinker. You need to cut 
back on your consumption — and if you can’t do it on your own, you need to 
get some professional help.
Chicken or egg?
Drug addicts experience anhedonia (the lack 
of the ability to experience pleasure) follow-
ing withdrawal from their drugs of choice. One 
possible explanation is that addicts take drugs 
in the first place to artificially create a sense 
of pleasure because their brains are incapable 
of doing so on their own. Another possibility is 
that the misuse of mind-altering drugs produces 
changes in the chemical workings of the brain, 
which result in a loss of pleasure. Either way, 
addicts are not happy people.

Ten Things You Can Do Today to 
Foster Happiness in Your Life
In This Chapter
 Making time for yourself
 Adopting a healthy lifestyle
 Being grateful
 Making a spiritual connection
 Inviting others into your life 
T
he main theme of this book is that happiness is no accident. You have 
to work to achieve happiness — the greater and more consistent the 
effort, the greater the eventual reward. In this chapter, I offer you ten simple, 
effective strategies that, if you make them part of your daily routine, will 
help you reach your goal of a life full of positive emotion. Think of them as 
prescriptions, think of them as the ten secrets to a happy life, think of them 
as the Ten Commandments of Happiness, think of them anyway you like — 
just make sure you turn thinking into action!
Establish and Stick to a Morning Ritual
If you want your day to be positive, you need to get off on the right foot. 
One way to do that is to have a little ritual that you can start the day with — 
something predictable, something that you do come rain or shine, something 
that doesn’t take too much time or energy but sets the stage and emotional 
tone for everything that comes after it. Rituals are examples of automatic 
behaviors that you do without thinking — and, that’s what you want early 
in the morning when you’re getting ready for the day ahead. Think of it this 
way: What starts off positive stays positive.

290
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
I begin each day going to a little coffee shop for breakfast, reading my paper, 
and spending 20 minutes with myself. I think of it as my little sanctuary — a 
time of peace and tranquility before I’m swept away by all the demands of 
the external world. My morning ritual strengthens and fortifies me for the 
day ahead.
My wife, on the other hand, gets up before I do, lets out our dogs, and spends 
20 minutes reading the newspaper and petting Max and Dixie. That’s her time 
for herself — and the dogs — and, I’m careful not to disturb it. (It’s one of my 
many excuses for lingering in bed until the last possible minute!)
 
Your morning ritual could involve exercising, meditating, praying, remember-
ing all the things you have to be thankful for, or writing compassionate 
notes to family and friends in need. (I cover each of these topics later in 
this chapter.)
Eat a Healthy Diet
A healthy diet is a source of energy and nutrients, both of which contribute 
to physical and emotional well-being.
 
Take, for example, the banana. Did you know that bananas not only provide 
a boost in energy (just ask athletes!), but they also help improve a person’s 
mood? Bananas contain a protein, tryptophan, which converts into serotonin, 
a brain chemical that sets the tone (positive or negative) of emotions. In that 
sense, bananas work on the same principle as antidepressants, which also 
elevate levels of serotonin.
 
To make sure you’re eating healthy, you need to:
 
 Eat a nutritionally balanced diet that includes daily food choices from 
all five of the basic food groups:
 
• The bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group: 6 to 11 servings
 
• The fruit group: 2 to 4 servings
 
• The vegetable group: 3 to 5 servings
 
• The milk, yogurt, and cheese group: 2 to 3 servings
 
• The meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts group: 2 to 3 
servings
 
 Eat three meals every day. Make sure you start with a good breakfast — 
it sets the stage for a healthy day.

291
 Chapter 23: Then Things You Can Do Today to Foster Happiness in Your Life
 
 Watch your portion sizes. If you’re eating crackers or chips, put them 
in a bowl or on a plate instead of eating straight out of the box or bag. 
Decide ahead of time how much you’re going to eat and stick to it — that 
way you won’t keep reaching into that box or bag after you’re full.
 
 Eat when you’re hungry and make healthy choices when snacking.
 
 Use sugar sparingly.
 
 Limit your caffeine intake to 250 mg per day. That’s equivalent to three 
cups of coffee. (Read the label on your favorite soda to see how much 
caffeine it has.)
 
 Eat a minimum of 1,200 calories per day. If you’re not trying to lose 
weight, you’ll probably need closer to 1,800 to 2,000 calories per day.
 
 Opt for lean meats and low-fat foods.
 
 Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day. Often, when people think 
they’re hungry, they’re really thirsty.

Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Jane Kirby, RD, and the American Dietetic 
Association (Wiley), and Nutrition For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Carol Ann 
Rinzler (Wiley).
Exercise
That old saying “Move it or lose it” is true. If you don’t get enough physical 
exercise, you have less energy and stamina to work at achieving happiness. 
The simple tasks of everyday life become chores, and no one looks forward 
to doing chores! To reconnect with the joy of living, you have to get your 
body moving again in a way that goes beyond your normal daily routine.
Many people confuse exercise with activity — routine physical activities such 
as housework or going up and down the stairs at home and work. Exercise is 
rigorous in nature — it gives your heart and body a workout, which means 
working up a sweat! You can exercise in a gym (on machines such as a tread-
mill or elliptical trainer) or on your own (by walking or jogging, for example).
What’s the best form of exercise? According to a friend of mine who owns 
and operates his own health facility, the best exercise for you is the one 
you’ll agree to do. In other words, as far as your body is concerned, what 
matters isn’t how you exercise but how often you exercise. And you’ll 
exercise more often if you’re doing an exercise you like. It’s common sense, 
really: If you can’t stand swimming, what are the odds you’ll make swimming 

292
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
a part of your daily routine? Not good. The goal is to find an exercise you 
really enjoy, because if you enjoy it, you’ll do it more often.
 
How much should you exercise? I recommend exercising daily for 25 to 30 
minutes or exercising four times a week for 45 minutes. For much more infor-
mation on the different types of exercise, how to know you’re fit enough to 
exercise, and how to measure your progress, check out Fitness For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, by Suzanne Schlosberg and Liz Neporent, MA (Wiley).
Get Enough Sleep
Sleep is essential to health and happiness. Yet, millions of people suffer from 
acute and chronic sleep deprivation. As a result, they:
 
 Show signs of increased irritability
 
 Have difficulty concentrating and remembering things
 
 Are ineffective at work
 
 Have a low tolerance for stress
 
 Are prone to emotional outbursts
 
 Lack stamina or endurance
 
 Are accident-prone
 
 Struggle to get out of bed in the morning
 
 Come across to others as pessimistic and sad
 
 Doze off during boring meetings or while watching TV
Does this sound familiar? If it does, you’re definitely not getting enough sleep. 
How much is enough? Children need around ten hours per night. An ado-
lescent needs eight to nine hours. Adults require seven to eight hours. And 
seniors can get by on roughly six hours unless they’re unusually active — for 
example, doing a lot of physical labor or continuing to work full-time into 
their retirement years. (Seniors often nap at least once during the day, which 
means they can get by with a little less sleep at night.)
 
Here are some tips on what constitutes good sleep hygiene — things that make 
getting a good night’s sleep more likely:
 
 Avoid daytime naps lasting more than 30 minutes.
 
 Go to sleep at approximately the same time every night, even 
on weekends.

293
 Chapter 23: Then Things You Can Do Today to Foster Happiness in Your Life
 
 Don’t exercise or engage in any stimulating activity (including work) 
just before you go to bed. Have a buffer period of about an hour 
between when you put down the activities of your day and when you 
close your eyes.
 
 Don’t use alcohol, tobacco, or caffeine within four hours of bedtime. 
You may think, “But alcohol makes me sleepy — won’t it help me sleep?” 
It may make it easier for you to fall asleep, but it’ll also make your sleep 
restless and cause you to wake up throughout the night.
 
 Don’t use the bedroom for things other than sleep and sex. That 
means no TV or reading while in bed.
 
 Don’t go to bed angry.
 
 Unclutter your mind. You can’t do anything to change what happened 
during the day, so what’s the point in rehashing all that stuff? And you 
can’t totally prepare for what tomorrow will bring.
 
 Make sure you’re sleeping on a good mattress. The money you spend 
on a new mattress is money well spent. The typical mattress lasts only 
about 10 to 12 years.
 
Sleeping pills — both over-the-counter and prescription — are never a good 
option for getting enough sleep. If you use them too often, they can produce 
negative side effects including daytime drowsiness, anxiety, and rebound 
insomnia when you stop taking them. Never take sleeping pills without con-
sulting your doctor.
 
If you follow all the tips in this section and you’re still having trouble getting 
enough sleep, you may have a sleep disorder. For more information, check out 
Sleep Disorders For Dummies, by Max Hirshkowitz, PhD, ABSM, and Patricia B. 
Smith (Wiley).
Meditate
Meditation is the oldest technique known to man for producing a state of 
inner calm and relaxation. All religions include meditation, in one form 
or another, as a primary way of achieving a spiritual connection. It has a 
variety of medicinal benefits — lower blood pressure, decreased muscular 
pain, improved sleep — in addition to leading to improved self-esteem and a 
general sense of well-being.
 
Meditation feels good because it increases the brain’s level of dopamine, a 
neurotransmitter that is key to the experience of pleasure.

294
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
To meditate, all you have to do is:
 
1. Sit quietly in a comfortable position.
 
2. Close your eyes.
 
3. Breathe through your nose and focus on each breath you take.
 
4. Each time you exhale, repeat a soothing word (such as one) or a 
phrase (such as I’m relaxed) to yourself.
 
 Continue this process for 10 to 15 minutes. Breathe easily and naturally. 
Keep a passive attitude throughout. The goal here is to let something 
positive happen, not make it happen.
 
These are just the bare bones of meditation. For much more information on 
meditation, including specific meditation exercises and guided medita-
tions on a CD, check out Meditation For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Stephan 
Bodian (Wiley).
Make a Spiritual Connection
Do you believe in a higher power, a being or entity that transcends human 
existence that you can turn to at various times for various reasons (reassur-
ance, guidance, peace of mind, hope)? If you do, you may be more likely to 
be happy — if only because you don’t feel so alone as you struggle with the 
ups and downs of everyday life and can “hand off” your problems when they 
become burdensome.
Are you suited for meditation?
Strange as it may seem, extraverts (outgoing, 
sociable, adventure-seeking, risk takers) 
are much more likely to practice meditation 
regularly than are introverts (quiet, thoughtful, 
reserved people). Maybe it’s because introverts 
already spend a considerable amount of time 
in quietude, whereas, for extraverts, meditation 
is something unusual and, thus, refreshing. 
Who knows?
The key is that meditation works whether you’re 
as chatty as Rachael Ray or as reclusive as 
Greta Garbo.

295
 Chapter 23: Then Things You Can Do Today to Foster Happiness in Your Life
It doesn’t matter which religion you practice, or whether you actually 
consider yourself religious at all (plenty of people think of themselves as 
spiritual, but don’t follow any particular religious faith). What matters is 
how often you make that spiritual connection. Research has shown that just 
showing up at a religious service of some sort once a week cuts your odds of 
developing heart disease literally in half. Now there’s something to be happy

In Chapter 6, I draw a link between hardiness and happiness. Interestingly, 
hardy people — those who have an internal sense of control, are actively 
committed to life, and are able to turn catastrophes into challenges — seem 
to have a greater spiritual connection than do non-hardy folks.
Be Thankful
Gratitude is one of the identifiable key ingredients to achieving happiness. 
First your needs are satisfied and then you’re grateful — that’s how it’s 
supposed to work. But for many unhappy people, that’s not the case. They 
find themselves neither satisfied nor thankful for what life has provided in 
the way of material things or opportunities.
 
If you don’t want to be one of those folks, begin or end your day with five 
minutes of quiet reflection on the things you have to be thankful for as you 
either look ahead to the day before you or recount how your day went. This 
is not a time for self-criticism (could’ve, should’ve, would’ve) or focusing on 
that half-empty glass. It’s your time to dwell on the positive — the blessings of 
everyday life — and appreciate the fact that much of what ends up making you 
happy comes from sources outside yourself.
Here are some examples of things you may be thankful for:
 
 Be thankful for your partner, who is there to comfort and support you in 
good times and in bad.
 
 Be thankful for your health.
 
 Be thankful that you are healthy enough to help others in need.
 
 Be thankful to the higher power (if you believe in one) that offers hope 
to the hopeless and help to the helpless.
 
 Be thankful for being sober (if you have a history of alcoholism).
 
 Be thankful for being in a positive mood (if you’re prone to depression).
 
 Be thankful to your children for giving your life meaning and purpose.

 Be thankful for the sunshine.
 
 Be thankful that you have enough money to take care of the basic 
necessities of life.
 
 Be thankful if others see you as intelligent, witty, or creative.
 
 Be thankful that you have the good sense to be thankful.
Think and Feel with Compassion
All world religions and all truly great figures in the history of mankind have 
one thing in common: They teach, preach, and exemplify compassion. 
Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Jesus, and Martin Luther King, Jr., all were champ-
ions of compassion.
I was raised in the segregated South during the days before and after the 
civil rights movement, and I believe Martin Luther King had compassion for 
white Southerners whom he saw as being prisoners of long-standing cultural 
racism. Thus, by seeking to free his own people, he freed whites as well, 
making the “new South” a much safer, more just, and attractive environment 
in which to live.
If you’re not sure if you’re the kind of person who regularly acts with compas-
sion, ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Do I believe that people who are less fortunate deserve my love?
 
 Am I nonjudgmental when I consider other people’s misfortunes?
Prayers of supplication versus prayers of gratitude
Sometime in my middle-age years — I’m not 
sure exactly when — I transitioned from nightly 
prayers of supplication (humble entreaties to 
God for things I thought I needed to make me 
happy) to prayers of gratitude for all that I had 
already received. I realized I was way ahead of 
the curve on the so-called good life — in other 
words, I already had more than my fair share 
of positive experiences in marriage, family, 
friends, economic opportunity, and career. To 
keep asking for more would, in my opinion, have 
been arrogant and ungrateful.
Today, if I ask God for anything, it’s on behalf 
of others — for example, my children who are 
young and have a lot of life left to live, friends 
who struggling with the inevitable events and 
circumstances unique to old age, and my 
beloved dogs. And, here’s the kicker: The less I 
ask for, the more I continue to receive.

297
 Chapter 23: Then Things You Can Do Today to Foster Happiness in Your Life
 
 Do I believe that one of the primary reasons I was put on this Earth is to 
help others in need?
 
 Do I have an “I’m for them!” attitude toward my fellow human beings?
 
 Do I believe that “What goes around, comes around” — in other words, 
that compassion breeds compassion?
If you answered “yes” to most or all of these questions, you’re well on the 
road to happiness. If your answers suggest you’re a little “light” when it 
comes to compassion, you might start by acting with compassion (that is, 
lend a hand where it’s most needed — see the next section) and see if that 
doesn’t change how you think and feel about others. 
Lend a Helping Hand
My Aunt Judy was right when she told me, “Doyle, God put us on this Earth 
for one reason and one reason only — not to make money, not to win every 
race we choose to run, but to help our fellow man.” I’m not talking about 
compassion — acting in sympathy toward the less fortunate among us (I 
cover that in the preceding section); I’m talking about lending a helping hand 
just because you can and because you’ll end up feeling happier if you do.
The best type of support is the kind that’s unsolicited — like my neighbor 
who started mowing my 2-acre yard one day without asking. I went outside, 
stopped her, and said, “You don’t have to do this — I know you’ve got plenty 
of other things to do today.” Her reply said it all: “I know, but I want to do it — 
I’m doing it as much for me as I am for you.”
What have you done lately to help someone else? You don’t have to be a 
knight in shining armor. The simplest things count, too. For example, in your 
everyday life you can do the following:
 
 When you see a young mother trying to get out to the car with a cart full 
of groceries and a few crying kids, you can offer to push the cart for her 
and put the groceries in her trunk.
 
 When you notice that your neighbor’s sidewalk is covered with snow, 
you can shovel it for him.
 
 When you see your kid struggling with his homework, you can sit down 
and offer to help him figure it out.
 
 When you see that the dishwasher needs to be emptied, you can empty 
it (and save your spouse or parent from having to do it).

298
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 When you learn that your best friend lost her mother, send her some 
flowers along with a note expressing your love.
 
 When someone you know (even if you don’t know them all that well) is 
going through a difficult time, add him to your prayer list.
 
 When you see a turtle crossing a busy street, stop your car, pick it up, 
and take it safely to the side of the road.
 
 When you see a notice in the newspaper soliciting volunteers for some 
worthy cause, pick up the phone and offer your services.
 
 When your local bookstore invites customers to purchase books that 
they will distribute to underprivileged kids, buy a couple and help open 
up a child’s mind.
Have a Sense of Humor
Lighten up! Try not to take life so seriously. Put a smile on your face (see 
Chapter 12). Don’t just read the sports page in the newspaper — read the 
comics! End the day by listening to your favorite late-night comedian. Spend 
some time with an irreverent friend, someone who has a healthy respect for 
the absurdities of life. According to the Bible (or The Byrds), “There’s a time 
to laugh and a time to cry.” Make sure you have the right balance between 
the two.

Ten Thoughts That Lead to 
Happiness
In This Chapter
 Looking ahead rather than behind
 Realizing your true purpose in life
 Knowing when enough is enough
 Transcending difficult times
 Giving yourself permission to be happy
H
appiness is a case of mind over matter. What you have in your mind — 
your thoughts — matter. Angry thoughts lead to anger, sad thoughts 
lead to sadness, and happy thoughts lead to happiness. In this chapter, I offer 
you ten positive thoughts that will help you find happiness.
Life Is Ahead of You — And That’s 
Where Your Focus Should Be
Focusing on the past is easier — after all, you know what that was. The 
future — what’s ahead of you — is far less certain. But think about it: Isn’t 
that uncertainty part of what makes life exciting and interesting? Something 
really wonderful — a new career opportunity, a new relationship — may be 
about to happen in your life. Your future is full of possibility; your past is 
already settled.
I’m always happy on New Year’s Day. Why? Because that’s the day I officially 
forget about the previous year and begin to look forward to the year ahead. 
I spend a few minutes reflecting on the unique challenges and opportunities 

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
that came my way during the past 12 months, and then I let that go so I can 
eagerly anticipate what lies ahead. It’s like being reborn once a year — I get a 
fresh new start, feel renewed energy, and give thanks for all the good things 
that haven’t happened yet but I’m guessing will.
People who are weighed down by the past are rarely happy. They spend far 
too much time looking backward instead of forward and, as a result, often 
overlook the positive things in their day-to-day lives. Are you one of those 
folks who’s walking through life with your head on backwards?
 
Begin each day with a few minutes of quiet time where you can reflect on all 
the positive possibilities that lie ahead in the next 24 hours. Open yourself up 
to the unknown, unforeseen circumstances of the day and trust that you’ll be 
able to deal with and benefit from whatever is in front of you.
It’s Never Too Late to Say You’re Sorry
We all screw up sometimes — we say things we regret later, we hurt other 
people’s feelings, we’re arrogant and selfish. (Hey, I speak from personal 
experience!) Although you can’t go back and undo your mistakes, you can 
say “I’m sorry” and mean it.
Is there a time limit — a statute of limitations — on apologies? No. It’s never 
too late to let someone know that you feel bad about behaving badly. She’ll 
appreciate your apology, whether it comes five minutes later or two years 
after the fact.
 
Apologizing for some transgression in your past is like removing a pebble from 
your shoe. It makes journeying through life a whole lot easier and less painful.
 
Thinking that you’re sorry for having hurt someone, by itself, is not enough. 
The apologetic thought needs to be acted upon. The person you hurt needs to 
hear you say, “I’m sorry for what I said or did,” and so do you. Silent apologies 
may feel good, but they don’t do a lot of good.
We’re Here to Help Each Other
My Aunt Judy put this thought in my head when I was a young boy and it’s 
been there ever since. She explained that we’re not on this Earth simply to 
get educated, earn money, buy things, mow the grass, or take out the trash. 
Those things have to do with survival. The ultimate purpose of life is to 
support, love, encourage, and assist one another in every way we possibly 
can. If you’re doing that, you’re happy. If not, you’re not.

301
 Chapter 24: Ten Thoughts that Lead to Happiness
 
Take a minute and ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Who have I helped today?
 
 Who needs my help today?
 
 What can I do that would be helpful to someone I care about?
 
 What’s keeping me from being helpful?
 
 How do I feel after I’ve been helpful to someone in need?
 
 If those I care about can’t rely on me for help, who can they rely on?
Get going and do something good for someone! You’ll be happy you did.
I’ve Had My Fair Share
Whether or not life is finite, I choose to think it is. When someone asks me 
why I don’t drink alcohol anymore, I answer by telling him, “Because I’ve 
had my fair share already.” My answer may not satisfy him, but it satisfies 
me. By thinking that I’ve had my fair share — that hypothetical quantity 
allotted to me in a lifetime — it was easier to get sober without thinking that 
I was being deprived of something that was rightfully mine for the taking. 
One reason most alcoholics have trouble stopping drinking, I’m convinced, 
is that they don’t feel they’ve had their fair share of booze yet. Until they 
believe they’ve had their fair share, no intervention in the world will likely 
prove effective. Along with the thought that you’ve had your fair share of 
something comes the feeling that you are satiated, satisfied and content — 
all key ingredients to achieving happiness (see Chapter 2).
All you have to do is ask
The ever-popular golfer Chi Chi Rodriquez loves 
to tell this story: As a youngster, his father con-
fronted a man in the middle of the night who 
was stealing bananas from their backyard. 
The man was their next-door neighbor, who 
had lost his job and was having trouble feed-
ing his family.  Expecting his dad to be angry — 
because they had little to eat as well — Chi Chi 
was surprised when his father cut a big bunch 
of bananas from the tree and gave them to his 
neighbor, saying, “If you need something to eat, 
just ask and I’ll give you part of what I have — 
you don’t need to steal.” That life lesson was 
not lost on Chi Chi, who has been an incredibly 
generous man throughout his long and prosper-
ous career, helping those much less fortunate 
than himself.

If you want to quit smoking once and for all, repeat over and over to yourself, 
“I’ve had my fair share of nicotine.” If you want to lose weight, tell yourself at 
some point during every meal, “I’ve had my fair share of food for right now — 
it’s time to stop eating.” If you’re tired of always dominating social conversa-
tions and want to hear what others think for a change, tell yourself, “I’ve had 
my fair share of air time — I want to let someone else take center stage.” If 
you’re tired of always being angry about one thing or another, say to yourself, 
“I’ve had my fair share of anger for one lifetime,” when you feel your buttons 
being pushed. (You can find many more solutions to excessive anger in Anger 
Management For Dummies.)
You Don’t Have to Get over the 
Bad Things in Life — You Just 
Have to Get beyond Them
As a therapist, I’m frequently asked by my clients, “How long will it be before 
I get over this?” My answer is always the same: “You won’t ever get over 
it — the best I can do is help you get beyond it.” Initially, this response is 
anything but comforting to the person who hears it because she thinks, quite 
naturally, that until she does get over this bad thing, she can never hope to 
be happy again.
The simple truth is that our brains hang on to bad memories, just like the 
good ones, forever. Getting beyond a bad event doesn’t mean that you forget 
that it happened — it just means that you have to detach emotionally and 
move on with your life.
When Juan’s brother died tragically of cancer at age 40, Juan was grief 
stricken. He couldn’t bring himself to talk about his brother — how much 
he missed him, all the good times they’d had together — without becoming 
tearful and feeling overwhelmed by sadness. When these feelings persisted 
after four months, Juan realized that he needed help and he went into 
counseling. It took a while, but eventually Juan got to the point where he 
could enjoy the good memories of all the years his brother was a meaningful 
part of his life. Juan has moved beyond his brother’s untimely death, even 
though he’ll never get over it.
 
In the appendix, I list a reference for Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning 
(Washington Square Press). I highly recommend this book if you’re struggling 
to get beyond some unfortunate circumstance in life.

 Chapter 24: Ten Thoughts that Lead to Happiness
Life Isn’t Fair — And the Sooner You 
Accept That Reality, the Better
Admit it: You want life to be fair, and you have your own idea of what fairness 
is all about. If your kids are healthy, if people appreciate all the hard work 
you do, and if you get the promotion you think you deserve at work, you 
think that’s fair. If your child gets sick, if no one appreciates your hard work, 
and if you get passed up for a promotion at work, you see those things as 
unfair. If so, you’re not alone. Most people associate “fairness” with good 
outcomes and “unfairness” with circumstances that don’t work out the way 
they want them to.
In Chapter 1, I tell the story of Cecil, a 60-year-old gentleman who began 
life with a childhood illness resulting in a physical handicap. Cecil’s secret 
to being a happy man was that he and his entire family accepted just how 
“unfair” his situation was, but then they moved on with their lives, treating 
Cecil as though he was normal, in every sense of the word.
 
Let philosophers and theologians spend their lives pondering what’s fair 
and unfair.  Put your energies into experiencing and dealing with life in more 
practical terms — for example, what works and what doesn’t when it comes to 
achieving happiness.
When in Doubt, Pole Left
For over a decade now, every summer dozens of bateaux (boats) along 
with hundreds of crew members journey 138 miles down the James River in 
Virginia. Crew members push the boats forward with long, sturdy poles, just 
as their predecessors did in the 1800s. Each day on the river is different — 
some days are uneventful, while others are filled with hazards, some serious 
enough to disable the boat and injure the crew.
The bateaux men have a saying that captures their thinking when they’re 
faced with some oncoming obstacle: “When in doubt, pole left.” The idea 
behind this saying is that, at a time of actual or potential crisis, indecisive-
ness is dangerous. Even if you’re not sure how things will turn out when you 
suddenly change course, doing something is always better then doing nothing. 
If you do nothing, you know where you’ll end up — on the rocks!

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
People who navigate the changing waters of life without a plan for how to 
react to adversity — to be decisive, take risks, change course — typically 
encounter more unhappiness than they would otherwise.
Water Flows Downhill
There’s a simple truth in that statement. Invariably, water does flow downhill. 
And that’s why this thought is so important. Too often, people try to make 
life seem more complicated than it is. We’re too analytical, we look for hidden 
agendas, and we second-guess everything and everyone. Even Freud once 
said, “Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.”
Many of my disabled chronic-pain clients have difficulty accepting help from 
others, including close friends and family. Why? Because they view these 
offers of help in a negative light — “They feel sorry for me. They think I’m 
not man enough to get the job done now that I’m in pain.” The simple truth is 
these good folks just want to help, that’s all.
The simple truth is . . .
I often use children’s books with adults in my 
anger-management classes. Each book usu-
ally contains one important lesson about how 
to better manage emotions. One of my favorites 
is I Was So Mad by Mercer Mayer (Western 
Publishing). Most of the book is about a young 
boy who continues to be mad because he’s told 
“no” by his family every time he wants to do 
something — filling up the bathtub with frogs.
He gets so angry he finally decides to run away 
from home. But before he can leave, his friends 
come by and invite him to play ball. His mother 
says “yes” and suddenly he’s not mad anymore. 
The simple truth:  People — children and adults 
— get frustrated and angry when they can’t do 
what they want, but that soon ends when they 
find something they can do that gives them joy. 
Happiness and anger can’t coexist. So the next 
time you find yourself frustrated by the way 
things are, look for something positive you can 
be happy about.

305
 Chapter 24: Ten Thoughts that Lead to Happiness
I Have What I Need
Humans have few actual needs — the things that are vital to our physical 
survival. We need air, water, food, shelter, and a certain amount of sleep, 
and that’s it. Everything else — jewelry, cars, fine clothes, a vacation home, 
a big-screen TV, $200 tennis shoes — are things we want out of life. Under-
standing the difference between needs and wants goes a long way toward 
finding happiness.
In Chapter 1, I talk about the fact that, although young people are happy, 
people typically report becoming even happier as they grow older. One 
reason for this, I think, is that for somewhere in midlife most people’s wants 
begin to decelerate, even though their needs remain the same. You still 
need to eat, drink, and stay warm, but you may not want a new car every 
three years.
I Deserve to Be Happy
In my lifetime, I’m amazed at how many people I’ve met who don’t feel like 
they deserve to be happy. And I’m not just talking about clients who have 
come to me for counseling — I’m also talking about my family and friends. 
They talk about surviving, “just trying to make do,” settling for whatever 
comes their way, or doing what it takes to hang in there.
 
Repeat to yourself out loud ten times each morning: I deserve to be happy.  I 
deserve to be happy. I deserve to be happy. Because you do.
 
Deserving something — like happiness — and feeling entitled to it are two dif-
ferent things. An entitlement means you have a legal right to that thing, which 
in this case you don’t. What you deserve is a chance, an opportunity to pursue 
and ultimately discover a sense of happiness. This book can provide a road 
map for achieving happiness, but it can’t give you permission to take the 
journey. That you have to provide yourself!

Biographies of Self-Actualized People
There are many biographies and autobiographies of celebrated people 
cited as examples of self-actualized personalities by psychologist Abraham 
Maslow. In addition to those I list here, Maslow included people such as 
Pablo Casals, Albert Einstein, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham 
Lincoln, Pierre Renoir, Albert Schweitzer, and Walt Whitman. Reading about 
the life of someone who has achieved happiness can serve as an inspiration 
in your own life.
