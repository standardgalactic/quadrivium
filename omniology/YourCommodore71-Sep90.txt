It was quite amusing to read in a certain other rag claiming to do
Commy 64 reviews that we're 'dead', kaput, no more, that we have
ceased to be. I know that we missed an issue on the shelves but that
doesn't mean that you're pushing up the daisies, does it? Does that mean
that if I miss footy training one Sunday I should be cremated or buried or
something? Well, you know what they say about chickens and hatching and
all that. A case of foot-in-mouth methinks.
Well gripes is gripes and on to lighter thangs. The new look VC gets more
and more funky, and has everything that a Commy 64 owner could want, ie.
games, games and more games, but you know that already, do you not,
John?
The best news is that we're still treading water and when we have learned
to do our ten metres doggy paddle, then you're in for some hot poopy stuff.
But putting my serious cap on for a moment, another point I'd like to put
my grubby ﬁnger on is the subject of software piracy. Don't do it! It's not fair
for someone, anyone, to take money out of the mouths of programmers,
development teams, journos, and even the largest of software houses.
Grandslam is gone, and so is Tynesoft, and God only knows how many more
will bite the dust if this disease carries on for much longer. And anyway for
every game that you rip off, the less money there is to be spent on the next
release, thus making for a poorer product. We all lose in the end. Be sensible
robbery is robbery no matter what tint your shades are.
That's it for now. I'll catch ya at the show (the ECES) in September
probably (I'll be the one hanging around PRETENDING to be drunk), until then
hang loose.

squiggy mess), never
get them wet (or they
multiply), and never,
ever feed them after
midnight.
*  2) They have now
appeared in two movies
and there is already a
third one planned.
* 3) Both ﬁlms were
directed by Joe Dante,
who is also known for
his direction of The
Burbs, Inner Space, and
a rather nasty horror
movie called The
Howling. He is currently
making a comedy ﬁlm
based on the comic
strip hero Plastic man.

has signed the license
to do a game based on
Gremlins 2, but I
suppose you already
knew that.
WISHING ON A
STAR
Space is a very,
very big place,
and there's
nearly as many games
based on it than it
contains stars. Accolade
tends to disagree,
'cause here comes Star
Control, a game for
action game enthusiasts
and strategy game fans
alike.
Apparently, in the
future we've got a big
prob. Although there is
this enormous star
cluster, it cannot
accommodate all the
alien races that make up
the Ur-Ouan hierarchy
and those that comprise
the Alliance of Free
Stars. So it time for a
rumble, and a big battle
is on the horizon with
yourself deciding the
outcome.
If you want you can
even get a friend to join
in the mayhem, and you
can smeg them (or vice
versa), ha, ha! And if
your a bit dubious
whether the fate of entire
races should rest in your
hands, you could let the
computer handle either
the arcade blasty
section or the strategic
bit, and you can control
the other.
Star Control will be
available around
September time.

SHAKING HANDS
WITH THE DEVIL
0
 US Gold has
announced the
imminent release
of a new Capcom
arcade conversion. This
one deals with the
controversial issues
surrounding the Middle
East, a tetchy subject
that is normally best left
alone.
But this time the
fundamentalists have
been ignored, and the
plot focuses upon
dodgy arms dealers
(and gammy legs I
should imagine) who
would rather that the
Middle Eastern wars
didn't end so they could
sell more and more of
their powerful weapons.
Now they're spreading
terror much the same
way that you'd spread
marmite, 'cept they
don't let it dribble out
the side of their
sandwiches.
You, as one of three
characters - Mickey
Simon (in a F-14
Tomcat), Shin Kazama
(Tigershark), and Greg
Gate (A-10 Thunderbolt)
- have to ﬂy around a bit
blasting the bad guys
and therefore doing your
bit for worldwide peace.
And there you have it.
U.N. Squadron offers
simultaneous two-player
shoot-em-up action and
will soon be available on
cassette and disk.
Also to come our
way is a role-playing
game (Aar Pee Gee)
based on that ﬂared
hero of the cosmos best
kept to a late night slot
on Satellite television,
and featuring all manor
of stupid irritating
metallic menaces, that
make very bad sound
effects kind of noises.
This'll be
programmed using,
roughly, the same
system as the AD&D
range, by SSI. And it is
based on the TSR game
of the same name,
which surprisingly
hasn't done very well.
Whether or not we'll
see it appear on the
commy this year is
another thing entirely,
but we can keep our
ﬁngers crossed can't
we?
Biddee, bidee, biddee!

WHEN THEY MET IT
WAS...
On Friday 13th July,
Rik, Jeffery Davy,
Paul Rigby and a
bunch of similarly unruly
journos were invited to
Loughborough at US
Gold's bequest and to
celebrate the release of
Murder (last issue's cover
game).
They all convened in a
three star hotel and before
they knew it, many, many
pints of alcohol were
placed before them, and
then it was off for a large
conference during which
the heckles from a select
few were rather more
interesting than the
speeches. Then there was
enough time for a few
games of pool in which a
YC team made up of Paul
and Rik narrowly lost to an
Emap team (which almost
made up for the drubbing
we gave them at
Terminator paintballing).
Then they were all
herded onto an ancient
coach and driven to this
rather superb mansion in
the middle of nowhere.
And after more bevies
everybody was treated to a
slap up meal, and a comedy
sketch performed by a few
actors, in which Geoff Brown
(US Gold's big boy) was
publicly humiliated, and boy
did everyone enjoy it!
After returning back to the
hotel and boogying down in a
nightclub until the early hours,
we can exclusively
reveal that Rik was the
last person to get out
of bed on the Saturday,
and he and Jeff were
the last of the rabble to
leave the hotel
thoroughly content. So
(according to Rik) it's a
big hurrah to US Gold,
and I'd like for my own
presence to be noted
for the next journo
bash!

TJC211W4A1
The YC review team are so cool that when they could
keep ice cubes in their underwear. But what do they do In
their spare time?
Rik "Eric Gumby" Hender son - Editor
Spare time? Spare time. hah! What little spare time Rik gets he
devotes to reading comics and ﬂicking jelly at Reliant Robin
owners. Mos t of his spare time comes on the train from London
to sunny Milton Keynes.
Ashley "Mr. Cr eosote" Cotter-Cairns - Games Editor
Ashley is a bowling man, and we don't mean that he struts
down the street waving his arms from side to side and hobbling
on each foot as if he's got some terminal gout. He's even got
his own ball, or so he says!
Beverly "Mrs. Yetigoosecreature" Gardner - Contr ibutor
Oor Bev spends an awful lot of time knitting and making ﬂans
and things. She has a wierd and percuhar tendancy to visit the
dentist incredibly often, it's almost as if she enjoys it.
THE SKOREBOX
Each game is given different ratings in the form of a wonderful froody
skorebox (notice the change of letter from 'c' to 'k in order to make it
even more fashionable).
El Graphics (out of 10)- This is what we think the games appeal is
presentation wise and graphically.
Sonic s (out of 10) - Does the music grate? Do the sound FX
come across as realistic?
Fix Factor (out of 10) - This is what we think the instant appeal
of a game is like. Does it grab your attention straight away? Or is
it too hard to get into?
f a  Hall-Life (out of 10). How long will the game retain your
interest? Minutes? Hours? Days?
Overall (out of 100) • This is the personal rating given by the reviewer
of how good they think the game is.
00-25 T h i s  game is so abysmal that the only reason anybody
would ever want to see it is for novelty value.
26-50 I n c r e d i b l y  dull, and not interesting in the slightest. Watch
'Hitman and Her' and you'll get the general idea of what I'm talking
about.
ek
51-75 N o t  too awful, and probably somebody's cup of tea,
although we'd rather stick to ginger beer.
76-84 
A
 good game with more going for it than most. It'd be best
to check these ones out in the shop before you buy them.
65-99 G o  out and buy immediately, these games are hot So hot
in fact that you'd be done for taking thorn into a no-smoking area. Any
game getting this score are announced as VC Fun Ones (the VC seal
of recommendation).
100
No game has
ever got this
rating, and any
game to ever get
this would be
the best that
anybody could
ever do on the
commy 64.
You'll know
when a game
this good comes
around because
all the games
players in the
world would
wander around
and bump into
lam posts and
things.

Rik wraps a
black blanket
around himself
and runs around shouting
"Hiya, yip, yip, hiyah!" Once
they released him from the
institution he set about this
latest in the pixelised
exploits of ninjas.
S
arcade machine? Howcum I
ain't seen it then? It's not as if
I don't go down the arcade or nufﬁnl
Actually Shadow Warriors isn't my
kind of thang anyway. I was put off of
beat-em-ups when Double Dragon
came out. Horizontal scrolling
landscapes that stop when there's a
ﬁght to be had, nah you can
keep'erm
Dragon Ninja almost changed my
mind, but didn't offer enough
variation in gameplay to hook me, so
Shadow Warriors with it's even more
monotonous action is hardly gonna
get me going, but it will appeal to
somebody.
Plotwise these kind of games
don't offer too much; you, as a ninja
in the nineties, must ﬁnd and destroy
an oriental demon who has taken the
body of one of today's greatest
warriors, Unfortunately he has sent a
plethora (cunning use of the English
language huh?) of 'ghoulish
assassins' to halt you in your
progress.
So you start in the slums of
ORS
somewhere similar to New York, and
you must progress along streets and
through different levels of action.
This is done by beating the frag out
of anything that moves, and things
that don't too. And when you've
gone through them, the villains get
bigger and tougher and carry logs,
which they are more than willing to
shove in places that you'd rather
they didn't. There are also leather
clad punks and sumo wrestlers,
amongst other harder to beat foes.
Luckily for you, you are the only
one left who has been taught the art
of ninjitsu, which means you can use
not just your hands, but your whole
body as a weapon. You can kick,
punch, backﬂip, throw, and dance
about like Michael Jackson probably.

If you kill a villain and they crash

icons give you energy or extra lives

Well, what can I
say other than
YOU ARE SO SLIME)!
We've been
overwhelmed here at Slime
City with tons of nasty
cheats, hints, pokes and
maps. As you can imagine,
this suits us just ﬁne 'cos
we don't want to have to
do any work, you want free
software and the software
companies want free
publicity. Happiness all
round! This month's
sponsors are RAINBOW
ARTS who will happily
provide copies of
TURRICAN and DOMARK
who have some nifty
ESCAPE FROM THE
PLANET OF THE ROBOT
MONSTERS t-shirts to give
away. Thanx to both of you
for being so low and
creepy!
As far as other rewards
are concerned, we have
another piece of good
news. We at the Slime City
have come up with a
somewhat superb idea
(even if I do say it myself).
We have decided to sort
you scumbags into ranks -
the more crud we receive
from you the better, 'cos
you'll be promoted. When
we've ﬁnally sorted out
prizes other than software
you'll be able to qualify for
a prize according to your
rank. Wear your disgusting
position with pride and say
'YAH BOO SUCKS to
anyone who is lesser then
you on the lists. As to
these ranks, here they
are:-
PRIVATE PRAT - maybe
you'll get a badge (when
we get them, that is)
CORPORAL CRUD - look
out for your t-shirts,
corporals
SERGEANT SLIME - if we
can con a software house
then you'll get a game
CAPTAIN COLOSTOMY -
pretty high ranking,
certainly a game or two
plus anything else we can
get for you
GENERAL GUNGE - the
slimer's highest rank.
Reach these dizzy heights
and you're looking at a day
ot;it roleplaying, but just
you try to get there! It ain't
going to be easy.
Something for gungy
people like you to dream
about.

gone? Bing tiddle tiddle

Squish._
S
yip, yilip, yip ptang! Now you
have got a rough idea of what
Monty Python's Flying Circus was
about. It was, is, and will be silly
willy, my name is Fred. In the
seventies it was a cult comedy series
completely in a different mould from
Oops Vicar I've Lost My Blender, and
all of those connected to it (other
than the recently departed, and
sorely missed, Graham Chapman)
have made mega bucks doing even
greater things.
Dressed in a woolly vest and
hanky placed ﬁrmly on head, you are
Mr. D.P. Gumby and have ﬁsh wibble
lost your brain. It has separated into
four parts and you must complete
Grumby in chicken guise, ﬂaps about
a bit and does bugger all else.
levels in order to get it back.
Uncannily enough (uncanny for a
game based on Python anyway)
there are four levels and in each level
you must collect tins of spam and
shoot various cheeses in order to get
those missing parts of your cerebral
lobes.
This is not easy though as blip,
blip, wobble bang, there are many
things that can go wrong. For
instance you could lose the spam
that you thought you had uncovered,
by it slipping down a pipe or
something. And there are a plethora
of Pythonesque baddies that pour
from every crack in the Dali-like
scenery.
In the ﬁrst level you transform
into a ﬁsh, and you must travel along
pipes that contain many cheesy
comestibles. You must shoot the
cheese in order to reveal tins of
scam or other items of food.
Sometimes though, the tins of spam
are plain for the eye to see and a
cunning use of shooting and
placement of your body are needed
in order to succeed in solving the
puzzle. This is more often than not,
so your own brain is needed to allow
you to pick up Gumby's.
The other levels have the same
gameplay, but Gumby changes into
different creatures including a bird
and would you believe it, a biped
humanoid (a man, to you or me).
Scattered around in obscure places
•
(you have to experiment in order to
ﬁnd them) are bonus levels that offer
much food.
Every time you touch a meany
you lose energy and you start with
three lives. Any food, including
spam, replenishes that energy, but
when your energy runs out your head
ﬂies off and ﬂaps around like a ﬁsh
out of water.
If you manage to complete a
level, and succumb the end of level
guardian, the amount of cheese that
you caused to explode and the
amount of spam that you collected
with be totalled up, and taken away
from your score (the score starts at
99,999,999 and plummets
downwards!). If you have collected
and shot enough you will get a piece
of your brain back.
The graphics are so yoinks splat
good that you'd be forgiven for
mistaking this version for the Amiga
one. The feel of the game is just
spankingly right, with more Python

10 things you never wanted to know about
Monty Python's Flying Circus
1) Halibuts are not just small, wet things with scales,
they are also a plot device.
2) T h e  parrot sketch is not a pencil drawing of a
parrot.
3) M y  father was not a lumberjack, nor did he dress
in women's clothing.
4) Adrian Pumphrey (Ed of Your Amiga) is likely to be
a member of the ministry of silly walks.
5) Accountancy is not boring.
6) Mo n ty was the name of a British tank colonel. A
python is a big snake. Flying means 'to ﬂoat in the
air'. And a circus is a performance by many in a
big tent. Therefore Monty Python's Flying Circus
means Colonel Snake's ﬂoating tent.
7) A  silly thing to do on a rainy day is to stand in the
rain.
8) Sp a m is a wonderful meaty comestible.
9) S o  is rat pie.
10) There are only nine facts!3
icons contained than the programs
themselves (thinking about it this
doesn't seem so silly). If you are into
surrealism, or then again even if
you're a ﬁsh, then this game is the
halibut for you (Eric, of course). It
also "breaks the ice at parties"!

PLAGUE
Plague is based on the immensely
popular old classic, Defender
(alright, it bears more than a passing
resemblance) and should be
treated as an excellent
version and not an
original game.
The
game is controlled entirely with a
joystick in port 2. The ship
accelerates in the direction of the
joystick and moves from one side of
the screen to the other to allow for
maximum forward view, Lasers are
ﬁred by
rapidly
pressing

addition, the ship is equipped with
three smart bombs which destroy all
aliens on screen. The bombs are
ﬁred by holding the ﬁre button down
for a longer period. In this way you
need never remove your hand from
the joystick.
The ship has considerable
momentum and it takes practice to
control it effectively. The object of
the game is to destroy all aliens in
each sector while protecting the
men who are stranded on the

dwelt in secret
caves somewhere
on Sark.
Only you,
Kron, with the aid
of your wounded
father, can escape
across the sea of
storms to a small
island where you
grow tall and
strong and vow revenge to your people. Your promise is
to kill Balzan and rescue Princess Zora by... That day

Adventure games allow the player to use skill and
imagination within the constraints of the program. The
real beauty of this is that the choice is up to you! When
you see the word 'instructions' enter your command.
The following list shows you some of the more often
used commands. (There are more, so trial and error is a
good ploy!)

landscape. The alien types are as
follows.
A) Flotation mines: These follow
a set pattern across the landscape
and provide a moving obstruction to
the player.
B) Planters: These hunt down the
men on the landscape. When
directly overhead a target man they
descend to capture him. The man is
then carried to the top of the screen
where he is absorbed and the player
mutates. If the planter is destroyed
before reaching harmlessly to earth.
C) Mutants: These ﬂy at high
speeds with the sole aim of
destroying your ship. Although they
are the fastest of the aliens, they
also have the most momentum and
are not capable of rapid changes in
direction.
D) Pods: On later levels these
pods hover motionless in space.
Destruction of a pod causes the
release of four swarmers. Using a
smart bomb will also cause the
release of swarmers.
E) Swarmers: These ﬂy at
constant horizontal velocity but can
change vertical velocity rapidly. They
operate in two modes. 1) Attack
mode, where they home in to your
ship. 2) Defensive mode, where they
try to avoid being destroyed during a
chase.
Contact with any of the above
aliens results in the loss of one of
your three lives. An extra life and
smart bomb is gained every 1000
points.
The radar screen shows the
position of all aliens and men in
relation to your ship, which is always
central on the radar. The radar only
updates twice a second and account
should be taken of this when ﬂying
at speed.
LOOK-TO - View your present location.
TEXT/WORDS - Allows you to follow the adventure with
text only.
PICT - Enables you to view pictures and text.
HELP/H - May or may not prove to be helpful.
LIST/INV - Describes all your current possessions.
SAVE - Allows you to save your current position within
the adventure.
LOAD - Loads a previously saved adventure.
QUIT - The easy way out when a solution is not
forthcoming.
One feature of Kron is the ability to make fairly complex
commands. For example 'Take the spade and throw it

Stand by to take part in an exciting
non shoot-em-up (is there such a
thing?), game of skill and judgement.
The idea is to cover a symbol, known
as a Posicon, by another symbol,
which is called a Neg icon, to form a
single unit, known as a Block.

Across the top of the screen is a
row of twenty Posicons. Along the
bottom of the screen, above the
score line, is a row of twenty
Negicons. The Posicons and
Negicons match each other and
together they form a Block.
The computer will select a green
Posicon and place it at random onto
the viewscreen. You must then use
your carrier vehicle to select an
appropriate Negicon, take it to the
Posicon and drop it on top, thereby
changing it into a Block.
To pick up a Negicon simply
place your carrier over your selected
Negicon so that it ﬁlls the carrying
area, and hold down the ﬁre button
for a moment. The Negicon will
change colour to indicate that it is
now under carrier control - release
the ﬁre button. To release a Negicon
from your carrier, again, hold down
the ﬁre button for a moment. If you
select a wrong Negicon you may
release it on any vacant part of the
viewscreen.
You score points for changing
Posicons into Blocks. Some
Posicons have a much greater
values than others so it is wise to be
choosy. Some of them have other
functions. For example one of them
gives an extra life.
Every now and again, a Gulper
will traverse the screen at a rapid
rate. This is harmless but it does
gulp up any Posicons in its path.
This can be useful because it creates
more space for the computer to put
Posicons down (some of which
could be very valuable).
Enemy missiles also traverse the
screen in swarms - one touch and
you lose a life. You can destroy them
with energy bolts, gaining points at
Negicon as there is
a danger that you
may lose it.
The game
ﬁnishes when either
you lose all your
lives (you lose) or
you cover all the
Posicons with
Negicons (you win).
The game is fully
joystick controlled
with the exception
of the following
keys:
The scientists at Washington are a
clever bunch. After genetically
engineering an animal to get rid of
the current drug problems, you
have taken form as a fat yellow
beast nicknamed Muncher. Your
mission Jim, is to eat all these
horrible drugs lying around the
Washington depots and eliminate
the crisis for years to come.
However in these depots remains
the ghosts of earlier drug takers,
who certainly don't like you
hanging around. But do not worry...
The scientists devised a plan of
sending fake dealers into these
depots to scatter plasma capsules
all over the buildin... "Hang on a
sec, this sounds suspiciously like
Pacman, but with a ludicrous and
very thinly disguised plot?" You all
cry. Well, er.. Erm.. Yes it is
suspiciously like Pacman, but
Pacman was good wasn't it?
Playing Muncher
To play Muncher, you move your
man around the maze gobbling all
those nasty drugs, and avoiding
those nasty nasties. However, when
you eat a plasma pill, you can get
the same time, but beware as some
of them travel just below light speed
- you may only just about see them.
To ﬁre an energy bolt simply
press your ﬁre button and
immediately release it. Be careful if
you are carrying a
I L
your own back on the 'orrible
ghosts by gobbling them up too.
Unfortunately though, the plasma
energy in the pills is only sufﬁcient
to last up to 5 seconds.
Muncher is played with the
joystick in port 2 using the normal
movements, but the tire button is
NOT used. If you can't hack the
pace you can pause the game with
any key except the Commodore
key and F7 which changes the
speed of the game, and Run/Stop
which quits the game. To continue,
press any key.
In total there are 15 depots to
complete, with a bonus building at
the end. At the start you have 4
men at your disposal. Can YOU
munch your way to the last level
without being caught four times?
(By the way, this game has been
protected against disabling
collision, etc. with cartridges, so
don't try to cheat!)

Unlikely. The game is more likely
to make you want to go on holiday to
the Carribean. It's basically another
game of multiple events with judges
and an overall score. Whilst I always
have an open mind about games I've
never really been a fan of
multisports, ﬁrstly because of
multiload cassettes and secondly
because they're no fun unless you
play with your friends. All of the
events are, oddly enough, based on
skiing or other snowy pasttimes.
You start the game inside
He's going ﬂat out ha, ha ! (Shut up - Ed)
Barney's ski shop. Here you can sign
up for the competition, and choose
either serious alpine activity or
mellow mountain schussing. The
latter means that the scores that you
acieve will not be saved for
embarrasing posterity. After leaving
the shop you can select the events
that you want to compete in. There
are ﬁve in all and you can play each
individually or compete in all of
them. The ﬁve events are snowball
blast, downhill blitz, snowboard half-
pipe, innertube trash and acro
aeriels.
Snowball blitz is a little like
Operation Wolf. Snot-nosed kids are
closing in to nick the snacks that
Barney has left you in charge of. You
have to stop them with snowballs.
The closer the kid the less he scores
you. You can face north, south, east
and west so you have to keep an eye
on the radar. Other thingies appear,
like abonimable snowmen and
eskimos. which can be balsted for
extra points.
Downhill blitz is a violent version
of Ski Sunday. You have to make
your way down to the bottom of a
very nasty slope as fast as you can.
The more stunts you perform from
the cliffs the better though. Basically
a race against the clock but posers

will be rewarded.
Snowboard half-pipe is an icy
adaption of the popular
skateboarding event. You have to go
as fast as possible back and forth
across a half-pipe, pulling jumps and
stunts. Things to avoid include falling
off and chainsaw rabbits! The faster
and more complex the tricks the
better the score awarded.
The innertube trash reminded me
of Toobin'. It's a race down the hill

Snow is actually a cold form of water. When water is
subjected to temperatures of zero degrees celcius or
lower it freezes. Ice is the result on a body of water
but droplets may become snow. When snow melts the
water miraculously reappears and you have to take up
waterskiing.
against either a friend or a guy called
Lester. You have to be the ﬁrst to
ﬁnish but making the other guy's
tube go ﬂat gives you a distinct
advantage. There are traps to watch
out for too as these may make you
come unstuck.
The last event is acro aeriels. You
have to do a ski jump and perform
loads of tricks. Staying up in the air
for as long as possible is certainly a
help too. There are some really wierd
tricks like the Moebius ﬂip and Daffy.
All of the events are fairly playable
and good graphically, but playing
alone is unlikely to be entertaining
for too long. See it before you part
with the readies.

TIME MACHINE
Time is relative.
Does that mean

prehistoric ages. Not a lot of
nightlife - unless Pteradactyl
clubs turn you on that is. The whole
planet seems to be a very hot place.
Still, I thought that I was going to die
when the terrorists tried to blow me
and the time machine sky high.
Instead of being killed the
contraption blasted me 10,000,000
years back in time and now I'm in a
lot of bother. Getting back to the
present day will be hard enough but
I've got to ﬁx the time machine as
well, as it's been damaged by the
bomb. Oh well, can't stand talking
for the next 10,000,000 years, so
much to do, so little time...
Time machine is the latest
venture from Vivid Image, the
Watford-based design and
programming team who were
responsible for the brilliant
Neandothal Man never had it so good
(until Ash. was bought lunch)
Hammerlist. Time Machine is a very
worthy follow up to that title, and
adds a new depth to the traditional
idea of arcade adventuring.
Professor Potts, the mad scientist, is
set to become the world's ﬁrst time
traveller. However, he is beset by
terrorists just before the machine's
ﬁrst operation, and is blown through
time to ten million years B.C.
This would be a problem for most
normal humans. However, Professor
Potts is by no stretch of the
imagination a normal person. He is
just a little bit eccentric. This is an
advantage, because it means that he
believes that his inventions will work
and so consequently they do,
because belief is a powerful force!
Unfortunately his precious time
machine has been damaged, as the
crystal that powers it has been lost in
time. With your help Potts has to
locate the crystal and repair the time
machine, thus avoiding the fatal blast
from the bomb forever.
The problem is that the presence
of the crystal has altered time, thus
effectively destroying the future! Just
think, YC would cease to exist and
there would be no mag that caters
for 64 owners exclusively. Anyhow,
Potts is a subscriber and he doesn't
want to miss a single issue, so he
sets about altering the course of
history to save the world.
Initially there is only one time
zone. This means that Potts has to
alter history signiﬁcantly enough to
create another age and so progress
on down time. Each age is made up
of a wrap around scene which is ﬁve
screens wide. Each screen has its
own features and items, all of which
have some use or relevance. This
use or relevance may not become
apparent for millions of years though
so don't hold your breath! At the top
of the screen is a radar type warning
system which spans the ﬁve different
time zones. This looks like a stack of
miniture screens. As you create a
time zone its corresponding set of
screens appears on the radar. The
screens show as either green,
orange or red. Green screens are
safe, orange shows that there is
some danger and red means that a
temporal calamity is about to occur

and that the Prof should get to that
screen pretty damn quickly!
The puzzles are very basic and
straightforward, for example the
planet is too hot at the start of the
game, and Potts has to ﬁnd a way to
cool it down. But this doesn't imply
that the puzzle is easy to solve, just
easy in theory. Being sucessful in
this means that a new time zone will
come into play with its own set of
problems. The game requires
switching between the various time
zones that you have created to solve
problems. Each screen looks similar
to its sister locations in the other
time zones but brilliant graphic work
means that each looks as if years of
erosion and evolution have occured
and so gives each zone a feeling of
uniqueness. One example of the
changes is the swamp - this is
lethally deep in prehistory, but by the
ice age is much shallower and safer
to cross.
In order to complete the game
you'll have to guide the Prof back
and forth through the time zones, as
different problems often need the
resources of two or even more zones
to solve. What may be inaccessable
in one time zone will more than likely
be available in the next. The game
has been wonderfully designed with
loads of great touches, like the
Pteradactyl eggs that release a
handy ﬂying taxi when shot with the
Prof's home-made laser hands (also
useful if the natives get unfriendly, as
they drain energy from one of your
four lives). Another of Potts'
inventions are the teleport boxes.
I wonder why they don't want me to go in there? Poll Tax prison probably!
Fax
Market Forces
Activision are marketing the game, which is good
because they've been around since almost as far
back as prehistory. And there are no plans to produce
a ﬁlm of the game entitled "Back to the Future 4: Prof
Potts sox it to em".
It looks as if we've got a jolly bunch of Arsenal supporters here!
These can be dropped on any screen
in any zone and can be immediately
returned to at a keypress. You only
have four of these at your disposal
though.
Graphically superb, technically
brilliant - and thankfully the game
only takes one load, which means no
nightmarish multiloading system for
each time you want to travel
between zones. I cannot recommend
this game highly enough. Most
deﬁnately the thinking man's arcade
game with lots of nice twists and
details. If you have any liking at all
for exploring and puzzle solving with
a test of the reﬂexes to boot then get
it yesterday.

features great gameplay
subtely woven into a long
poetic plot with heavy strategic
overtones and atmospheric artwork.
Blood Money is a horizontal
scrolling, hard 'n' heavy blast em to
little pieces type of game that makes
no apologies for itself. You are a
space pilot out to earn Blood Money
by shooting lots of nasties with your
guns. By collecting the add ons your
ﬁrepower becomes more and more
awesome and your blood lust
becomes all consuming.
It's not every day that a software
house is so honest about their
product. Many of them try to hide the
mindlessness of their shoot em ups
by wrapping them in loads of gloss
and story. Psygnosis abviously
believe that honesty is the best
policy and have gone to the other
extreme. The story (rather thin, as
you might imagine) is that you are
interested in going on a space safari.
There are four huge planets to visit.
Each one costs a number of your
credits. The higher levels cost more
to reach so you'll have to earn
enough from the lower levels in order
to progress.
The game can be played by one
or two players simultaneously. The
guise is of course teamwork but the
chances are that you'll end Up
ﬁghting over the power ups and
cash. The power ups include rockets
that shoot up or down the screen,
neutron bombs for improved
explosive power, a rear missile and
long range missile torgetter. Also
available are speed ups and extra
lives. These can all be bought from
the various in-level shops that
accept the currency you've been
earning.
As you ﬁght your way through the
levels you'll notice the wide variety
of alien death-dealing craft. From
magic mushrooms to wierd crabs
and other mutants, the common

HOME AND AWAY
I've just grabbed yer latest
copy of YC to hit the Aussie
newsagents (the June issue)
and it's mega-cool! I stuck the
tape into my datasette and
loaded the demo. Excellent!!! I
can't wait to buy the game! Only
next time make it a playable
demo.
Right, bung the other side in!
I loves the logic game! Only
when I go to enter my name it
goes back to the title screen
when I press ﬁre for my ﬁrst
letter, then I can't start another
game. Am I doing anything
wrong?
Looking through the
magazine I can say that it is
good, except that it should have
lots more colour (especially the
review screenshots). I buy two
other mags, Zzap and C+VG,
and they always have colour
reviews, so how about gettin'
the can of paint out and colour
the reviews (and other stuff)?
Also why don't you do arcade
reviews?
When you do posters, how
about sticking ads on the other
side instead of reviews, etc. as I
don't pull the poster out
because of this, I think it ruins
the mag?

DISAGREEMENT
I've just seen the latest VC
under your new direction and
although I think that it's rad,
cool and really brill, I disagree
with the review of Galaxy
Force (by Godzilla?).
He says that the graphics
are too blocky and jerky, but
so was the arcade machine,
and I feel that this is a very
good copy. The gameplay is
far more involved than Godzilla
says and here are the scores
that I would have given it:
Graphics 8
Sonics 7
Fix Factor 8
Half-Life 8
Overall 79
Still not quite a YC Fun One,
but a pretty decent game just
the same.

Cowabunga!
Now that the
turtles have been
transformed from comic
book heroes to big screen
legends, the big screen legends
have been transformed into comic
book heroes. This is the ofﬁcial
adaptation of the movie of the heroes in
a half shell, and as a taster to the
cinematic version it's brill,
This is mainly because the
adaptation is written by co-turtle
creators Kevin Eastman and Peter
Laird, and is superbly inked by them
too. There is plenty of action and a plot
that even Batty would be proud of. If
this is anything to go by, the ﬁlm is
gonna be a real stonkingly good one,
and you should all cram into the ﬂicks
as soon as it's out, but ﬁrst buy the
comic book and eat pizza and stuff.

After you've read the ofﬁcial adaptation
of the turtle movie you can read the
ofﬁcial parody, but don't expect
anything on the same par as Mad
spoofs as this is more in the line of
'Carry-On'.
The plot of the original has been
very tenuously used as a basis for
the plot of this'un and it could be
seen as much a parody of Batman
and related hype as the turtles
themselves. All the characters are
there in some form or another,
although their names have been
radically altered to suit small
comical abilities, although you must
be warned that the ninjistic
weaponry are based on American
items that were either sold over here
during the seventies, or have never
reached these shores.
Leonardo has become
Velveeduh, Michaelangelo is
Viceroy, Donatello is Toyoduh, and
Raphael becomes Pierrier (Splinter,
incidentally, is renamed Match-Stik
and looks very
similar to a furry
Mickey Mouse).
And the
humour
throughout
is very
American
orientated.
This is not
too hot, and it would
be best to take the mickey out of
the ﬁlm yourself than to read this
expensive parody.

DICK
TRACY
VS THE
UNDERWORLD
Fleetway
E1.50
Another hit ﬁlm based on a comic
character (and not the last by no
means) was Dick Tracy and in true
merchandising form there is a
revitalisation in Dick Tracy comics.
Reetway has got the right idea
though, and has released two new
Dick Tracy stories that deal with the
events that lead up to the movie, ie.
the origin of Breathless Mahoney,
the background of Al Caprice, and
the death of his girlie's father.
And instead of copying the
style of Chester Gould (the
creator of Dick) Kyle
Baker has made
his Dick Tracy
look not unlike
Warren Beatty.
His artwork is
fast, and very
atmospheric
(other samples of
Kyle's work can be
seen in the DC
graphic novels Justice
Inc.). The stories are by
John Moore and they are
very accurate, and great
fun.
If you want a taste of Dick
Tracy that is up-to-date and is
accurate to the Dick portrayed
by Beatty, buy this book and the
other two (including the ﬁlm
adaptation) they're absolute mega.
Rik Henderson
Coo, what a chunky book.
And this Judge Dredd-like
character ﬁnally gets a
Judge Dredd script
writer, and boy do the
similarities notice.
Alan Grant takes
the writing chores
on this ofﬁcial
adaptation, and
it needed
someone with
immense
experience to
make a comic
out of an incredibly
violent, gory movie (see
review elsewhere in this
column). Alan has changed the
plot quite radically in order to comply
with the Comic Book Code, and
possibly made it a dam sight more
enjoyable. It even ﬂows in a
different order (le. the meeting
with Alex Mumhy's wife is near
the end of the comic, and at
the beginning of the ﬁlm) and
makes a little more sense.
Robocop is put up
against a new designer
drug called 'Nuke', a
new Robocop
(surprisingly called
Robocop 2), and
just about 1000 new
directives such as
"Don't monopolise

although
it would
be hard to
judge on just
one issue it
looks as though
Dave has
performed his best
ever and Frank his
worst.
There is no doubt that Give Me
Liberty is superbly written, but the plot
very deﬁnitely smacks of the early Third
World War stories in Crisis. This may
alter in future episodes but at the
current time we have to sit and bear it
in order to appear fashionable.
Dave Gibbon's artwork is very good
indeed far better than his work on
Watchmen, and Robin Smith's
colouring is similar to a typical Jim
Baikie comic.
Although Liberty deals with politics,
it manages to do it in a way that
educates more than it lectures. If you
want something that is a better version
of what has gone before, this is your
kind of thang. If not, wait until the
second issue, and see if it changes
radically enough.

ROBOCOP 2
'18'

People said that Robocop (the original picture) was
overly violent, I disagreed. Nobody has condemned the
latest in the dude in a can's exploits, and I would say
that it's far more gory.
This is not normally a reason for me to dislike a ﬁlm,
but when nigh-on every minute is full of blood-spilling
action then the plot and the feel of the ﬁlm both
become secondary. Also all of the humour contained
within the original seems to have been watered down
and is scarcely represented in the sequel.
All is not doom and gloom however, the
effects are incredibly good indeed, and the
ﬁght sequences are very well
choreographed. There are lots of
'ray/boo events and the
dialogue seems to have
been thought about a
little more. Perhaps
the major problem
with the movie
is the
direction.
Paul
Verhoeven (the
director of the ﬁrst)
preferred to stick to Total
Recall, and instead Irvin
Kershner (who has also
directed The Empire Strikes back
and Never Say Never Again, two ﬁlms
that rely a lot on their action sequences)
takes the helm, and unsuccessfully in my
eyes.
This will be a killer on video and has already
made big bucks in the US. so it really doesn't matter
what I say, but under 18s aren't really missing much.

With the uncannily poor plot
backgrounds for most budget
games you'd think that the
greenhouse effect was down to a
select few software houses that
have decided to break down the
ozone layer in order to create a
storyboar
effect more like). Whether this is
true or not, in time honoured
tradition the planet Earth has died
due to the greenhouse effect,
according to the cover of Poseidon
Planet Eleven, and the human race
has upended and shifted to the said
planet.
Unfortunately this is not a nice
place to live, but there is an even
more horrible place, just below the
planet's surface. And also
unfortunately for you, you have to
go there, because the planet is
overheating and there are eight
crystals down below that will cool it
down if taken to the core.
In this arcade adventure you
plod around searching for the
crystals whilst all sorts of bugs and
beasties try to gnaw away at your
parts. It is vitally important to map
this'un but only if you can stay
awake for long enough.
The animation of the main
character is very poor indeed and
the graphics in general leave a lot to

you must help him to

progressing through six jam-packed and mega-fun
levels, avoiding obstacles such as Indians, snakes,
ghosts, spiders and falling coconuts, amazingly. You
have to be quick though as Ranger Smith and the
tracker dog will be sure to capture you and take you
to the dreaded zoo. Along the way are special bonus
items to collect such as picnic baskets, hamburgers
and toffee apples. For the smarter games player who

get it the more points (no, not

home or away round, followed by

unfortunately missed out.
There are over 1,000 questions

Of course, answer a question
incorrectly and it's over to the other

you're likely to do that as well, but if

Nemesis was nigh on the ﬁrst big

varied weaponry for your ship if you

guessed though there are hazards,
well a few. Gravity is a bit weird on
Planet 23 and can send you ﬂoating
(unlike A-Type, which was relatively
easy in comparison). Konami
originally converted it, and due to the
poor advertising campaign and the
distinct lack of magazine support it

That's about it really, which is a

There are many obstacles in his

And also scattered around are
bonus points in the way of objects

The controls are much the same
as those used in any games of this

portray a very cartoony feel and are

Makes sense dunnit! Four of Cod ies
best sports simulators are revitalised
on this excellent budget compilation,
and the most impressive thing is that
any of these games would still
impress if they were on their own.
Grand Prix Simulator is a little like
Super Sprint, and for my money this
was far better than its very own
sequel, and was one of the highlights
of the Codemasters range.
Pro Ski Simulator won countless
awards and rightfully so. The
controls take a while to get the hang
of but once you do you realise this is
fairly like a Super Sprint in 3D and on
snow. The graphics are pretty neat
too.
Pro Snooker Simulator is possibly
the weakest of the bunch, and you
can only play it with two players.
That said, it's better than Steve
Davis' Snooker and has a very nifty
option in the fact that you see your
cue, and you must hit the ball much
like real life.
But the grandaddy, and
undoubtedly the best, game on this
pack is BMX Simulator, the one
which Codemasters grew.
Programmed by Richard Darling
himself, everything is right about it
for a budget price.

MOM • HOW I LOVE iﬁt!
The South Bank, home of
the radist of skateboarders,
and a place to chill. In the 90
degree heat that we've had
this summer Rik Henderson
and his erstwhile
photographer Jeffery "Born
to Lig" Davy, trucked down
to the Museum of The
Moving Image and checked
out the dopest tourist
attraction around.
W
hot, HOT and you're
wearing your most
unfashionable jeans that you
possess (all the rest are in the
washing machine), along with your
baggiest of shorts) the last thing you
want is to hang around a packed
Waterloo Station waiting for a rather
late companion. But when he arrived
with shades on and dashing wildly
up the escalator with a large, metal
photography case ﬂapping around,
clubbing the other passengers, then
laughter just about quells any
tension set before hand. After this
any museum would seem like a
picnic in comparison.
But No. The Museum of The
Moving Image is no ham sandwich
and a litre of ginger beer, nope you
should be prepared before hand to
spend long hours of informative fun.
We strolled through the door
expecting it to be quiet and looking
forward to a couple of hours of
unhurried browsing, but there were
screaming hordes of Neighbours
fans sticking bubble gum in each
others hair and ﬂicking boogers at
each other and things. That's right it
was school-outing-aargh-where's-
the-teacher time? There were about
Mae West's Lips by Salvador Dail with Hitchcock's Spellbound Pali Paintings) in
background.
And for a moment we thought that this 'False Maria fr om Fritz Lang's Metropolis
was the real thing!
three groups of these rabble so we
had the right atmosphere.
Once we managed to burst our
way into the museum we realised
that it was arranged in a
chronological manner (it was set
through different time periods, John!)
so we had a look at the really dull
ﬂick animation parts, and quickly
sped to the 'What The Butler Saw'
naughty peephole machines. These
cost ten pee a go, so after we'd
blown the entire 'YC on the road'
budget and had one go we plodded
around to ﬁnd other exhibits that you
could poke, switch or prod.
Unfortunately it was very difﬁcult to
wade through the brat pack in order
to do so.
Luckily there is an abundance of
such gadgets, so for us cool cats it
was twiddle time in South Bank city.
And after we'd skipped past all the
intricate photography sections, and
the Birth of Hollywood (Mr.
Hollywood was waiting outSide
smoking a huge cigar), we came up
to the German expressionist period.
and scenes of a ﬁlm that was
suggested for the more mature of
visitors (we pretended to be grown
ups, so we could stick around).
Nothing much happened, just a girl
standing there with her mouth agog,
and a bloke with his mouth agog and
that was about it for us, so we
trucked over to the MOM! Control
Room and I watched ten minutes of
excellent footy on one of the sports
channels of satellite TV.
Then it was on to the coming of

sound, which was portrayed using
the ancient Al Jolson singing
Mommy, kind of touching don'tcha
think. Then it was a quick dash
through the animation studio, and
loads of kids sprawled around
drawing on Zoetrope strips in order
to see their work really MOVE. And
then, around the corner, came the
exhibit that really emphasises the
feel of MONK
The Hollywood set, in front of the
splendid reconstructed Odeon
cinema front (full size, an' all), is a
place full of things to do, and it is
here that we found the ﬁrst 'live'
exhibit, in the shape of an actress
portraying, well erm, an actress who
frantically tried to drum up some
interest in the American tourists
studying the wild western set.
Eventually a bunch of kids, with
Zoetrope strips clasped ﬁrmly in
mitts, strolled onto the scene and a
camera test was arranged with the
public forced to don cowboy hats,
and a great fun time was had by all,
even Jeffrey, although I will never
know how he got his camera in THAT
angle.
And from that moment there is
less to read and more to do, and
actors and actresses come from
every angle in order to force an
increase on the realism side. They're
a bit like the guards outside
Buckingham Palace, no matter how
much you verbally prod them, they'll
not stray from their roles. It is also a
lot more recognisable for us that
haven't been around for half a
century. And once you have passed
through the MOMI cinema, where
you can watch a whole ﬁlm if you so
much desire, and even seen the
projection room, it's TV time where
such stars as Mufﬁn the Mule and
Captain Scarlet are on show, along
with a few of the TVs throughout the
ages.
This is where they have an
enormous video jukebox, showing
pop culture from the 50s to current
ﬁlms. All you do is select a topic and
you'll see a few rad clips from one of
the better movies of the genre. I
predictable chose horror and we
were there for hours watching clips
from ﬁlms like Friday the Thirteenth
(it was amusing to see the forefather
of numerous horror ﬂicks, such as
Friday the Thirteenth 2, 5 and 12).

It was once we had gone down
the stairs that we realised that
something awesome was on us.
Something so sacred that for a
moment I thought we had found the
holy grail. But no, for there before us
was Kylie's Wedding Dress. Aaargh,
scream! What a moment for all the
Neighbours fans that stood around it
with blank expressions and mouths
open as if worshipping a new form of
god, the god of mass hysteria.
Fears were further realised at the
Neighbours exhibit where a bunch of
girls (who were standing in front of
Sooty sacrilege) watched the same
ﬁve minute clip of a November 1989
episode around three times. They've
been brainwashed, anyway Home
and Away is miles better.
We also had a good old chuckle
at Alf Garnet's bigotry in the toilet,
and it was then that the interview
with Barry Norman was a must for an
aspiring megastar like myself. Such
classic words were uttered from
myself ("what do you use your
television for, education or purely
entertainment?" says Bazza. "A ﬁsh
bowl", utters the biggest of Eds) that
all the spectators seemed to dash
with immense admiration to the loci
After such brilliance I didn't really
want to force myself reading the
news down everybody's throats too,
a few minutes of me on the box is
enough for now.
And a quick look at the Science
ﬁction display was about it. Down
the stairs was the special changing
exhibit (or so it says in my
programme), and my guess was that
it was in mid-special changing mode
because a load of builders were
shifting bits of wood around. Ah well.
So the day came to a close and
only because we skipped huge
sections. If we'd have stopped and
have done absolutely everything,
we'd still be in there now. There is so
much to see that this is one of the
most entertaining museum I have
ever been to. Forget crabby old
mummies and tombs the size of the
yellow pages, convince your teacher
to take the class to M O M  And if you
don't go to school (or you're bunking
off or something) get a parent to take
you, you'll learn so much about the
box in the corner of your room, or
the history behind the traditional ﬂea
pit. By the way it is not somewhere
to go snogging with your girlie/fella,
or else you might be mistaken for an
exhibit yourself.

Let's face it, how many
people do you know that
are called Tex Murphy? If I were
called Tex Murphy then I'd become a
private detective, just for the
advantage of not having to introduce
myself to as many people. However,
in Mean Streets you don't have any
option - you're stuck with the name.
Oh well, just avoid everyone and
pretend to be working.
Never mind the name. Your
nomenclaturical difﬁculties will be
forgotten when the ﬁrst paycheck
comes through the post. After all,
you have been hired to perform a
major investigation involving a
Professor, his daughter, a post
mortem and a hitman from Detroit.
Sounds interesting doesn't it. There
is however a snag, in the form of
extreme danger to life at the hands
of the hitman's gang and some very
hot pieces of lead in the form of
bullets.
The game is set in the future,
2033 to be precise, which is why
your car can ﬂy as well as having an
in-car fax and computer system.
There's even a car phone. All that's
missing from your yuppie image is a
stripy shirt, braces and a double-
barrelled surname. All of your
investigating is conducted from the
car, which is a very useful piece of

crime busting equipment indeed.
There are many different locations
available to visit, and the game is set
over a map of the West coast of
America.
Professor Linsky has apparently
committed suicide, but his daughter
Sylvia refuses to believe the police's
decision and so has hired you to ﬁnd
out the truth. The Prof was in
neurosurgery at San Fransisco
University, but left to work on a
secret project. Three weeks later, he
was found after jumping off the
Golden Gate bridge, with a witness
to the incident to boot. Your task is
to use all of your investigative skills
to suss out the truth and so convict
his murderers.
As is usual with investigation
games, you start off with a minimum
of information, only three locations
are revealed to you. These locations
are given in the form of co-ordinates
to input into your navigation
computer. The car then homes in on
the location and you can either ﬂy it
manually or use the autopilot to

types of building; private rooms,

them questions to glean information.
However, if the gang have taken over
a location then you'll have to ﬁght
your way in. They will no doubt be
armed with machine guns but you've
only got a pistol. The shooting
screen is an arcade game sequence.
The baddies shoot streams of bullets
at you. You can duck behind objects
and run forward, shooting at them
and avoiding the ﬂying lead. Its a
toughie even for good arcade players
and this might put off hardened
strategists. I would have liked to see
an option to skip this section of the
game but no doubt the programmers
thought it necessary.
The game is nicely playable and
has some great graphics, with an
unusual mix of ﬂight simulation type,
3D and side on view arcade modes
being used. Odd but good, with nice
use of colour and sound effects.
Mean streets is a nice product with
bags of lasting interest and good
presentation. One to look out for
later this year.

your hairline! Yes, a chance to
become Bruce Willis for the day and
take on the evil Hans Gruber. Can
you thwart his attempt to get rich
very quick, kill a few innocent
bystanders and destroy a tower
block?
Whilst the latter of his intentions
may please Prince Charles the other
two won't go down well with anyone.
Especially if you happen to be a
balding ﬁlm star whose wife is one of
the hostages! Not even Bruce Willis
could afford the $600 million that
Gruber plans to nick. But Gruber
hadn't reckoned with the power of
Love (or Brylcreem) and you decide
that enough is enough, and that
you'd rather have the wife back
because she doesn't have a life
insurance policy.
Anyone who's seen the ﬁlm will
no doubt recognize the plot. But on
to the game itself. The tower block
happens to be one of those
annoyingly large places that cleaners
get lost in and British tourists go to
for their holidays. As Brucie you have
to hunt down Gruber's gang one by
one, thus reducing the odds stacked
against you and increasing the

The ﬁlm of this game turned Bruce Willis overnight

also made a lot of money, though just how much
money I'm not going to tell you.
your wife, also in one piece. Our hero
can either use one of the many
readily available weapons to
despatch the bad guys, or do a bit of
the old one-two and pummel them to
death. This makes for an awful lot of
controllable actions from the joystick
but then who said that a hero's life is
an easy one?
The game is viewed from the
side, As you trog around the screens
Ah, me shins. That hurt you cad. I'm

you'll notice lots of terrorists to
bump off or be bumped off by. It's
therefore a good idea to get
aquainted with ﬁghting rather fast or
you won't be seeing anything, let
alone your wife, again. Assuming
that you manage to knock off a nasty
or two you can search them to ﬁnd
objects that will aid you, such as
weapons, ammo or whatever. Maps
of the various areas can be accessed
to aid your navigation. The lifts are
not operational; however life isn't

the ﬁre hoses to gain access to new

You have only twenty minutes of
game time to rescue your wife. As
well as all of your other problems,
there is Killer Karl to be reckoned
with. As in the ﬁlm, this ultimately
evil henchman hates your guts after
you killed his brother and now he
wants you dead. Survive his
attentions and you can have a crack
at Hans himself. He is holding your
wife hostage and you have to shoot
him without hitting her. Not easy
even for an ex-Moonlighter.
The graphics are nicely done and
very atmospheric. Sound is really
functional, though useful at times
you could probably do without it. Die
Hard is a big game. The long term
challenge exists only as a quest for
high scores though, and once
completed a couple of times I
couldn't see it holding too much
lasting interest. •

of great adventurers, the order

give you the best ﬁghting chance
against Zendick. There are four types
of party member. Each is
represented by a suite in cards, i.e.
hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades.
The spades are ﬁghters, strong in
combat but weak in the grey matter
department. Basically these brutes
hit anything that answers them back,
or even things that don't actually
move or speak.
Clubs represent the mages, who
are skilled in the use of magic and

spellcasting and also double as
clerics for when the party gets
injured. They are well versed in all
kinds of arcana, and whenever a
magical problem comes up they can
be reasonably expected to sort it
out. The hearts are adventurers, all-
round heroes who can become
advanced in all skills but rarely
become master of one in particular.
Finally the diamonds are archers or
assassins who are sneaky and
skilled in accuracy and quick death.
Not the person you'd most want
working behind the counter of a
chemist.
The characters can be viewed on
screen. This brings up a list of their
items in graphical form as well as
their vital statistics and armour class
etc. The mages have a spell book
that can be viewed and spells
selected. The game is joystick dhven
using icons, in other words you don't
need to type in any of the commands
whilst adventuring. Spells are
selected straight from the pages of
the book and cast at a press of the
ﬁre button.
You can dismiss characters from
the party, reprimand them for bad
actions or encourage them when
things go alhght. Dismissed
members can be resummoned if
necessary and the whole party can
rest to regain spell and hit points.
The movement is also icon driven
which I felt was a mistake, as it is too
easy to make a wrong turn by
misclicking on the rather small icons.
As you explore you are bound to
come across a monster or two. Most
people are unlikely to be diplomatic
in such circumstances and will no
doubt dive straight in to the fray.
Combat is a combination of clear
thinking, preparation and good
reﬂexes. Whilst you don't have to

Coo, doesn't it give you the willies?
ﬁght in real time you do have to
make the commands for the
characters to obey. This means
selecting spells and instructing them
to ﬁght in real time and a mistake
can be very costly. With practise
however you can get over the worst
of the difﬁculties. The problems
really are with spells because you
have to select the power of the spell
as well as its name which can take
all too long when you're about to
become a dragon's lunch.
Various magical items will be
encountered along the way which
will aid you in your quest. Powerful
weapons and armour, scrolls, rings
and wands of power are just a few of
the things you can expect to ﬁnd.
After a few hours your characters
can start looking like Arnold
Schwartzenegger on steroids! As you
progress and successfully perform
actions and make kills, your ratings
improve and you become even more
powerful. Unfortunately the monsters
also increase in might and cunning.
Bloodwych could have been a
really nice game, however its
ﬁddlyness makes it annoying to play
and at times so frustratingly difﬁcult
to control that you'll probably give
up. A nice try but it won't be
everyone's idea of their favourite
game ever.
