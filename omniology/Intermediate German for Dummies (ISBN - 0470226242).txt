About the Author
Wendy Foster was born in Connecticut and grew up in Scituate, Massachusetts. 
While studying in France, she traveled around Europe, and became curious about 
the German language and culture. After graduating with a teaching certificate and a
degree in French, she decided to return to Europe to study German. Her love of the
Alps inspired her to live in Munich, where she spent 30 years. During that time, she
studied German, completed her MA in French at Middlebury College in Paris, and
later learned Spanish in Spain. Her professional experience includes teaching
Business English, German, French, and intercultural communication skills, as well as
writing and translating. She recently returned to her New England roots, where she
works from her home overlooking a spectacular salt marsh that constantly beckons
her to go kayaking, walking, bird watching, and swimming.
Dedication
This book is dedicated to the marsh, its wildlife, Wingaersheek Beach, the Annisquam
River, and the man I share it with, Phil Kehoe.

Intermediate German For Dummies 

Introduction
You may be standing in the aisle of a bookstore at the mall perusing this book.
Maybe the mail carrier has dropped Intermediate German For Dummies on your
doorstep, so you’ve decided to rip open the bubble pack envelope because you love
popping those bubbles. No matter how you came across this book, acquiring more
German helps you in a myriad of ways. Like it or not, globalization is taking place at
an ever-increasing pace. German is spoken by more members of the European Union
than any other language, and Germany plays a leading economic role in the European
Union. You may be a businessperson, adventurer, or student — it doesn’t matter. But
unless you plan to live as a hermit, then in some way or another you’re bound to
come in contact with German. So get a head start and be ready to speak, write, travel,
and most of all, have fun auf Deutsch (in German).
Using this book builds your confidence in no time — well, okay, you do need some
free hours here and there, but the time you do spend using this book will pay off
down the road. Consider what you can gain from Intermediate German For Dummies
as the equivalent of having invested a huge chunk of money, time, and effort at the
local health club to become super fit for a trek across the Alps. The obvious differ-
ence is that you have to plunk out only a small chunk of change and some time and
effort in order to reap personal and professional gain.
About This Book
Intermediate German For Dummies is your key to success in becoming confident in
both written and spoken German. In this book, you get straight talk, the nitty-gritty,
and enough detail to see you successfully through any major and minor roadblocks to
communicating in German.
You’ll find this book very user-friendly because you can go through it in any order
you choose, zeroing in on your priorities. You can skim or, better yet, skip over the
grammar you don’t need. Use the book to find answers to specific questions you may
have on a topic that comes up while you’re writing. All the chapters have ample prac-
tice exercises following the grammar explanations so you can check whether you’ve
grasped the material. Flip to the end of the chapter, and you find the Answer Key for
the exercises with explanations pertinent to problematic usage. Without even realiz-
ing it, your German vocabulary expands as you cruise through the book. The example
sentences and exercises use practical, everyday German so you can flex your vocabu-
lary muscles as you complete the tasks. Most important, as you go through this book,
Viel Spaß! (Have a lot of fun!)
Conventions Used in This Book
To make your progress go as smoothly as possible, I use some conventions in this
book. They can help you spot essential elements in the text and exercises:

 I boldface the essential elements in verb tables, which may be information like
verb endings or irregular conjugations. Elsewhere, I bold German words and exam-
ple sentences.
 I italicize English translations that accompany German words and sentences. I
also italicize English terms that I immediately follow with a definition.
 The Answer Key at the end of each chapter has not only the solutions to the
practice exercises (in bold) but also italicized English translations. Answers have
explanations where I feel it’s important to clarify why the answer given is the
correct one.

Foolish Assumptions
In writing Intermediate German For Dummies, I made the following assumptions about
you, dear reader:
 You’ve acquired at least a smattering of spoken and written German, or better
yet, more, and you’re acquainted with some basics of German grammar.
 You’re willing to jump into German at the deep end and start swimming, even if
you do need some water wings at first.
 Your goal is to expand your knowledge of German so that you feel comfortable
in both speaking and writing the language. (Alternatively, you want to dream in
German.)
 You don’t want to be burdened by long-winded explanations of unnecessary
grammatical terms, nor do you care to hold a scholarly discussion in German
about Goethe’s Faust. You just want to you express yourself in clear and reason-
ably accurate German.
 You’re enthusiastic about having some fun while honing your German skills
because the last thing you want from this book is to be reminded of boring
school days where success meant figuring out how to: a) sleep and learn at the
same time b) skip class and not be missed c) wrap the teacher around your little
finger so that no matter what you did, you still got good grades.
If any or all of these statements describe you, then you’re ready to get started using
this book. Willkommen! (Welcome!) If you don’t have at least a basic understanding
of German, I suggest you first check out German For Dummies by Paulina Christensen,
Anne Fox, and Juergen Lorenz (Wiley).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts on general topics. In turn, these six parts are divided
into several chapters containing explanations, tables, and exercises. Each chapter
and appendix addresses a different aspect of the specific part. Here’s the preview.

Intermediate German For Dummies 

Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German
In this part, you reacquaint yourself with the world of nouns and verbs, numbers and
dates, word order and more fundamentals. See the mysteries of gender and case
unveiled. Part I also contains a practical guide to increasing your word power expo-
nentially. You understand how to retrieve newly acquired vocabulary and expressions.
Part II: Getting Started Now: 
Writing in the Present
Here you get the tools needed to construct sentences in the present tense. I give you
ample practice combining nouns and pronouns with verbs. I include info on asking
and answering questions, as well as agreeing and disagreeing. You see how to express
certainty and uncertainty and how to make wishes and requests using subjunctive
verbs. This part also shows you the six modal verbs that help you be polite, ask for
help, and talk about what you can do, want to do, should do, or must do.
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair
You want to sound like a native, right? This part helps you find out how to express
yourself using two-part verbs and reflexive verbs. It also delves into the finer points
of expressing yourself using adjectives of description. The chapters here show you
how to put adjectives and adverbs to work for you by making comparisons, show
how to connect shorter ideas with conjunctions, and touch on using prepositions.
Part IV: Looking Back and Ahead: 
Writing in the Past and the Future
In this part, you practice expressing yourself using past and future verbs. You become
familiar with the difference between the conversational past and the simple (narrative)
past, and you see how to choose the correct verb form to express yourself in the future.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Here you find my top ten easy and useful tips on the following topics: optimizing your
German (in other words, how to make your German writing the best it can be), and
avoiding pitfalls.
Part VI: Appendixes
The four appendixes provide an assortment of references to help you in your writing
and speech. The first appendix includes verb tables for conjugating verbs. The second
appendix covers case-ending tables to help you use nouns, pronouns, and adjectives

don’t understand or the German equivalent of an English word.
Icons Used in This Book
Consider these icons as key points as you take the journey through this book. You
find them in the left-hand margin throughout. The icons include the following:
Helpful hints like these would’ve made it a whole lot easier for me to feel more com-
fortable using German when I was living in Bavaria way back in the Dark Ages.
The Warning icon points out the hidden dangers you may encounter as you journey
through the deep forest of tangled words, slippery sentence structure, and the like.
This icon alerts you to key information that’s worth revisiting. You want to stash this
info in your mind because you’ll end up using it again and again.
Pay attention to these key points. By noticing similarities and differences between
German and English, you see patterns that show you how to assemble German into
meaningful statements.
This icon marks the core learning tool in this book: a set of exercises designed for you
to check your progress. Go ahead — grab a pencil and get started.
Where to Go from Here
Try scanning the Table of Contents for starters. Select a chapter that piques your
interest and take it from there. Read the section that presents a concept, point of
grammar, or guidelines. Study the example at the beginning of the practice section
and write your answers to a few of the exercises. You’ll soon find out what you know
or don’t know by checking your answers in the Answer Key at the back of the chapter.
When you’re satisfied with your results in one section, flip back to the Table of
Contents and find another section you’re ready to tackle.
Part I helps you assess what you already know. The other parts build up the confi-
dence you need in order to successfully expand your German horizons. Work at your
own pace, proceeding in any order you choose. Skip over sections you’re not ready to
do yet. If you don’t get the hang of a section, reread the grammar explanation, check
out the example sentences, or look at the first couple of solutions in the Answer Key.
Anytime you feel like you’re losing steam, mach eine Pause (take a break), close your
eyes, and dream about die Romantische Straße (the Romantic Road — an enchanting
route through some of the most picturesque parts of southern Germany). Before you
realize it, you’ll be dreaming of storybook castles and court jesters auf Deutsch (in
German)!

The Basic Building
Blocks of German

In this part . . .
I
magine you’re building a house. Regardless of whether
it’s made of bricks, wood, or cards, a well-designed
house all boils down to whether the foundation is solid
enough to support the structure above it. So it is with Part I: 
This is where you get a solid foundation for building your
German. Chapter 1 assembles the basic tools you need for
construction. Following this groundwork is Chapter 2;
there, you gain confidence in case and gender, which act
as the mortar that sets words into meaningful sentences.
With Chapter 3, you’re in the process of laying out some
supporting beams of German, including numbers, time,
dates, and nationalities. So far, so good. Chapter 4 adds
sparkle to your otherwise mundane construction job. You
get a jump start on increasing your word power by recog-
nizing groups of words that fit together logically.

Chapter 1
Assembling the Basic Tools 
for German Sentences
In This Chapter
 Understanding terms used in German grammar
 Identifying parts of speech
 Using a bilingual dictionary
You need some basic grammar tools to help you assemble winning sentences. In
this chapter, I explain the roles of the grammar tools — such as your trusty cases,
clauses, and cognates — to help you boost your confidence in German. Next, you need
to find some parts to build a sentence: parts of speech such as a noun, or better yet, a
couple of nouns, a verb, an adjective or two, and a maybe a preposition. These spare
parts, er, words, are easy to find in a big dictionary. At the end of this chapter, I give
you pointers on how to navigate your way through a bilingual dictionary.
Throughout Intermediate German For Dummies, you encounter the terms I describe in
this chapter. I use these terms to explain grammar, vocabulary, and the idiosyncrasies
of building sentences in German. If you’re not familiar with such terms, getting the
hang of the exercises in later chapters will take longer. Lingering here before jumping
ahead can save you time in the future. At the very least, scan the headings and tables
in this chapter quickly; when you see a term that you’re fuzzy about, stop there and
have a look.
If English is your native language, chances are you don’t need to bother with deciding
whether the words you’re using are verbs, nouns, or adjectives because you know
how to fit words together. Along the path to success in German, it’s a different story.
You’re prone to roadblocks caused by not knowing which word to use, how to use it,
or where to place it in a sentence. This chapter removes the barriers to your progress
with German.
Grasping German Grammar Terms
To get a firm grasp on German grammar, you need to make sure you can keep track of
the many terms you encounter. This section clears up any fuzzy ideas you may have
about the names for tools of German grammar, such as gender, case, and tense. (I use
terms for parts of speech in this section, but I give a fuller explanation of nouns,
verbs, adjectives, and so on in a separate section of this chapter.)

Conjugating verbs and understanding tenses
Verbs are the words of action, and a verb that isn’t yet part of a sentence is an infini-
tive or is in infinitive form. This is the verb as it’s seen in a dictionary entry, as in
wohnen (to live). In English, the to indicates that the word is in infinitive form; the
German equivalent is the -en ending on the verb.
When you conjugate a verb, you change the verb form so it fits in your sentence to
convey information such as which subject is doing the action and when something
happens. Conjugation involves breaking the verb down into its usable parts. Look at
the conjugation of the verb to work: I work, you work, he/she/it works, we work, you
work, they work. English has only two different spellings of work (with and without s).
The same conjugation in German — ich arbeite, du arbeitest, er/sie/es arbeitet, wir
arbeiten, ihr arbeitet, sie arbeiten, Sie arbeiten — reveals four different verb end-
ings: -e, -est, -et, and -en.
Verbs are conjugated in different tenses, which describe time. The three main descrip-
tions of time are past, present, and future. Here’s a briefing on the tenses I cover in
this book, with the relevant verbs underlined:
 Present tense: This tense describes an action that’s happening now, habitual
actions, or general facts. Look at the following sentence, which uses the verb
wohnen (to live) in the present tense: Ich wohne in den U.S.A. You can translate
it as I live in the U.S.A. or I’m living in the U.S.A. (See Chapter 5 for details on the
present.)
 Present perfect (conversational past): In German, the present perfect describes
something that happened in the past, whether finished or unfinished. It’s used in
conversational German. Ich habe in den U.S.A. gewohnt can mean I have lived
in the U.S.A. or I lived in the U.S.A. (See Chapter 16.)
 Simple past: The simple past is used in formal language to describe past actions.
Ich wohnte in den U.S.A. means I lived in the U.S.A. (See Chapter 17.)
 Future: The future, obviously, describes events that haven’t yet occurred. Ich
werde in den U.S.A. wohnen means I will live in the U.S.A. or I’m going to live in
the U.S.A. German makes much less use of the future tense than English, often
opting for the simple present instead. (Check out Chapter 18.)
English uses continuous (progressive) tenses — verbs with a form of to be and -ing, as
in am living or have been living — to describe a temporary or ongoing action. But
because German has no continuous forms, you can simply use the basic German
tenses you see in the preceding list for the continuous form in English. German also
uses other tenses slightly differently from English.
The subjunctive is not a tense but rather a mood, something that indicates how you
describe an action — for example, as a fact, a possibility, or an uncertainty; but as with
tenses, the subjunctive gets its own conjugation. (See Chapter 8 for the subjunctive.)
It’s a proven fact that you don’t retain vocabulary, grammar, or what-have-you the
first time you’re exposed to it. Or the second or third time. To combat this, use a
system of recording important information that works well for you: Try making flash-
cards, creating an alphabetical word list, writing new expressions in meaningful sen-
tences, and incorporating new grammar points into a short dialogue. You can also
copy the questions you need to review, leaving the answers blank, so that you can
redo them later.

In the following exercise, the verb is indicated in bold. Decide which verb tense it is
and write your answer in the space provided (refer to the bold, underlined verbs in
this section for help). Then translate the verb. The example shows the English trans-
lation of the complete sentence. You find the complete translations to the exercises
like this in the Answer Key at the end of every chapter.
Q. Ich kaufte ein neues Auto.
A. Ich kaufte ein neues Auto. (I bought a new car.) Simple past, bought. The -te ending sig-
nals the simple past tense.
1. Ich werde ins Restaurant gehen. _________________, _________________.
2. Ich habe den Film gesehen. _________________, _________________.
3. Ich fahre morgen nach Chemnitz. _________________, _________________.
4. Ich arbeite dort an einem Projekt. _________________, _________________.
5. Ich studierte Mathematik an der Universität. _________________, _________________.
Getting gender, number, and case
The trio of gender, number, and case are closely linked to each other to help you
make sense out of single words and to connect them into sentences. You need to
know how to use gender, number, and case to express your ideas in understandable
language. Check out the following explanations:
 Gender: People are one of two genders, masculine or feminine, right? Dogs and
cats are, too. But do stones and water have a gender? In German, yes indeed!
Every noun has a gender; the triumvirate der (masculine), die (feminine), das
(neuter) are the choices. All three are the gender-specific versions of the English
word the. (If this were a soccer game, the German team would’ve already won by
a margin of two.)
When looking at German, don’t confuse gender. Gender has to do with the word
itself, not the meaning of the word.
 Number: Number refers to singular and plural, like one potato, two potatoes, three
potatoes. German plurals are more intricate than English plurals. In fact, German
offers five major different types of plural endings. Some plurals compare with the
irregular English plurals, like man, men (der Mann, die Männer). (Check out
Chapter 2 for more on making nouns plural.)
 Case: There are four cases in German: nominative, accusative, dative, and geni-
tive. But what does that actually mean? Cases help tell you what role the word
plays in the sentence. They have to do with the difference between I and me or
she and her. Cases deal with the significance of the to in give it to me or the apos-
trophe s in dog’s Frisbee.
German case endings are numerous, and they show the relationship between the
words having those cases. English uses case far less often. (Chapter 2 has more
info on case.)

Chapter 1: Assembling the Basic Tools for German Sentences

Understanding word order
In many respects, German word order is more flexible than English word order
because case plays a key role in clarifying the meaning of a sentence, something
that’s not nearly as powerful of a tool in English. When positioning words in a German
sentence, however, there are a few major points to keep in mind.
 The simplest word order looks like English word order:
1. Subject in first position:
Meine Wohnung (My apartment)
2. Verb in second position:
hat (has)
3. Other information follows:
einen großen Balkon (a large balcony)
 Yes/no type questions have inverted word order; flip the conjugated verb with
the subject: Hat deine Wohnung einen Balkon? (Does your apartment have a
balcony?)
 More complex sentences — for example, a sentence with two verb parts —
require more understanding of where to position the verbs in a sentence. In vari-
ous sections of this book, you find out more about correct word order.
Grammar terms that describe words,
parts of words, and word groupings
You need to know several terms that are used to describe words that you put
together to convey meaning — sentence, clause, phrase, and so on. The following list
shows the most important key words I use in this book:
 Phrase: A group of words without a subject or a verb; most often used to
describe a prepositional phrase, such as ohne Zweifel (without a doubt)
 Clause: A group of related words that has subject and a verb, such as wir
arbeiten . . . (we’re working . . .)
 Sentence: A group of words that represents a complete thought and has a com-
plete sentence structure: subject, verb, and punctuation, such as Gehen wir!
(Let’s go!)
 Prefix: A “word beginning” attached to the front of a word that alters the word’s
meaning, such as un (un-) + freundlich (friendly) = unfreundlich (unfriendly)
 Suffix: A “word ending” attached to the back of a word that alters the word’s
meaning, such as (der) Kapital + ismus = Kapitalismus (capital + ism = capitalism)
 Cognates: Words that have the same meaning and the same (or nearly the same)
spelling in two languages, such as der Hammer (the hammer) or die Melodie
(the melody)
Note: Technically, cognates are simply two words that come from a common
ancestor.

Identifying Parts of Speech
In order to build a sentence, you need to figure out which words to use and how to
put them together. To do this, you figure out what you want to say, identify the parts
of speech you need to express your ideas, and then decide which words you want to
use. Word order in a German sentence can depend on the parts of speech that you’re
using. In Table 1-1, I explain what these terms mean.

Finding Meaning through Context
One essential tool for making sense of a foreign language is to consciously look for
meaning through the context of the words. You probably do the same thing in your
own language. Imagine you’re reading a text that’s not in your field of expertise. You
instinctively look at any headings, scan the text rapidly, and get more clues from any
illustrations, charts, or tables. When you’re looking at a text in German, you can meet
the challenge by employing the techniques you already use in your native language.
To understand what a whole sentence means, see how the words fit together. Identify
the verb or verbs and a noun or pronoun, and that’s the meat of your sentence. Check
out how the other words are related to the subject and verb — for example, look for a
prepositional phrase or a conjunction. (See the preceding section for the parts of
speech.) In short, use all the tools at your disposal to understand German sentences.
The following exercise combines the tools and parts explained in the previous sec-
tions of this chapter. Each sentence has one word missing. Decide which word of the
four choices is the correct one, and write your answer in the space.

Using a Bilingual Dictionary
Horses are only as good for riding as their training is. And dictionaries are only as
useful for finding words as their owners’ knowledge of how to use a dictionary. Except
for the terms breaking in a horse and breaking in a book, that’s about it for parallels
(unless, of course, you want to speak German to your horse).
A bilingual dictionary is a challenge at first; take on the challenge and read the infor-
mation at the front of the dictionary on how to use the dictionary. The symbols and
abbreviations are your key to successful scouting for the right word. This section
helps you sort out this handy tool.
Making the right choice (at the bookstore)
When choosing a bilingual dictionary, your first task is selecting the right dictionary.
First and foremost is the size and quality. Don’t scrimp here. Take your bathroom
scales to a serious bookstore at the mall and weigh all the German/English bilingual
dictionaries. Pick the two heaviest ones. (Okay, just kidding. You don’t need to bring
your scales, but do consider the obvious: that you’ll be able to find more information
in larger dictionaries.) Then compare three different entries. Start with a frequently
used verb like machen. The following shortened dictionary entry for the verb machen
shows you how a good dictionary organizes the information on the first two lines:
machen 1 vt (a) to do; (herstellen, zubereiten) to make. was ~ Sie (beruflich)? what do
you do for a living?; gut, wird gemacht right, I’ll get that done or will be done (coll).
You may notice two abbreviations and a symbol in this entry:
 The abbreviation vt stands for transitive verb; that’s a verb that can take a direct
object. Other verbs have the abbreviation vi, which stands for an intransitive
verb; that’s a verb without a direct object. 
 The second abbreviation coll stands for colloquial; expressions or words marked
by this abbreviation are used in informal conversation.
 The ~ symbol represents the headword (the first word) machen. The complete
expression is Was machen Sie (beruflich)?
Start your dictionary comparison task by following these steps:
1. Look at how comprehensive the entries are.
Check for commonly used phrases, such as was machst du denn da? (what in
the world are you doing here?), mach schneller! (hurry up!), or mach’s gut (take
14
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

care), and compare their translations for detail and content. You should be able
to find complete sentences and phrases using machen. Comprehensive diction-
aries should offer alternative words in German (at least for frequently used verbs
such as machen), along with possible translations. For example, after machen,
you may find herstellen (to produce, manufacture) or zubereiten (to prepare), as
in the example entry.
2. Ask yourself which dictionary is more user-friendly.
In other words, does the dictionary provide plenty of helpful abbreviations to
help you understand the entries? Do you see clearly marked sections under the
headword machen? They should be marked by numbers and letters in bold; in
the example entry, you find 1 and (a). Some quality dictionaries indent the num-
bered sections to make them even easier to locate. You can compare whether
there’s a phonetic pronunciation for tricky words. Also, check that the dictionary
makes ample use of symbols like coll to indicate usage of the word.
Apart from the abbreviations that show part of speech, gender, number, case, and
so on, you find many more details in any large, quality dictionary. A (very) short
list of such abbreviated terms should include fig (figurative), lit (literal), esp (espe-
cially), sl (slang), Tech (technology), Psych (psychology), Prov (proverb), Jur (law),
spec (specialist term), Aus (Austrian usage), Sw (Swiss usage), and many more.
Make your choice wisely, and start enjoying your new Wörterbuch (dictionary). Oh,
and don’t forget to take the scales home with you, too.
If you prefer an online dictionary and you’re not sure about how to make a good selec-
tion, follow the same criteria. Select a couple of reputable dictionary publishers, go to
their online dictionaries, and find out how extensive and (hopefully accurate) they are.
If you’re not familiar with dictionary publishers, go to www.google.de and check out
the dictionaries listed under “deutsch-englisches wörterbuch.” Do a thorough Web
search to find what’s available and compare the sources you find.
Performing a word search
Maybe you didn’t buy a paper dictionary because you found a nifty online alternative.
That’s all right. Online dictionaries are a good backup for finding out about words if
you’re on a limited budget. No matter whether you’re using a hard copy or an online
dictionary, you still have to know how to find the right word. 
Familiarize yourself with the symbols and abbreviations used by looking up a few
nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on. See whether you understand them in the context of
the dictionary entry. Instead of trying to memorize the meaning of all the abbreviations,
make a photocopy of the list and keep it as a bookmark in your dictionary. Better yet,
laminate it. That way you can use it as a mouse pad, a table mat, or whatever. You can
then cross-check definitions to get more information on words you’re looking up.
When you look up a word that has several definitions, read beyond the first or second
entry line and try to decide which one suits your needs. Think about context, and
decide which word fits best into the rest of the sentence. Besides meaning, here are
some other factors that may affect your word choice:
 Nouns: Think of gender and number as the vital statistics of a noun.
• Gender is indicated by m, f, and nt (for masculine, feminine, and neuter) in
some dictionaries.
15
Chapter 1: Assembling the Basic Tools for German Sentences

• Number is indicated with the plural ending form for that noun. There are
five main groups of noun endings. A common ending is -en; other nouns
add -s. With some nouns, you see the genitive case ending indicated for
that noun in addition to the plural ending.
 Verbs: Verbs also have vital statistics you need to know.
• A verb is transitive or intransitive (symbols like vt and vi). A transitive verb
takes a direct object; an intransitive verb doesn’t.
• A transitive verb may have a separable prefix (vt sep) or an inseparable
prefix (vt insep). If the prefix is separable, it usually gets booted to the end
of the sentence when the verb is conjugated.
• Some verbs are reflexive (vr), meaning they require a reflexive pronoun.
• The simple past form and the past participle are also indicated (in some
dictionaries with pret and ptp, respectively).
 Prepositions: Prepositions in German dictionary entries show which case they
have: accusative (prep + acc), dative (prep + dat), or genitive (prep + gen). Some
prepositions have more than one case, and most prepositions have more than
one meaning.
 Pronouns: Pronouns include personal pronouns (pers pron), such as ich (I);
demonstrative pronouns (dem pron), such as denen (them); relative pronouns
(rel pron), such as das (that); and reflexive pronouns (reflexive pron), such as
mich (myself). See Chapter 2 for details on pronoun types.
Adjectives and adverbs may be the same word in German. Memorize both, and you
have two words for the effort of looking up one.
Look at the dictionary entries and answer the questions about the words and
abbreviations.
Key for abbreviations: m = masculine, (Brit) = British usage, (US) = North American
usage, pl = plural, f = feminine, nt = neuter
Q. In the entry for Reise-, which word is feminine? Is it one word or two words in German?
A. Reiseversicherung is feminine, and it’s one word in German.
26. The headword (first one) has a hyphen at the end of the word like this: Reise-: What does
the hyphen mean?

Answer Key
a
Ich werde ins Restaurant gehen. (I’m going to go to the restaurant.) Future, will go/am going to
go. Either translation is appropriate; am going to go sounds more natural here because it
expresses an intention. Werde plus the verb at the end signals the future tense.
b
Ich habe den Film gesehen. (I have seen/saw the film.) Present perfect, have seen/saw. Habe
plus the participle at the end of the sentence signals present perfect tense.
c
Ich fahre morgen nach Chemnitz. (Tomorrow I’m driving to Chemnitz.) Present, am driving. The
ending -e signals the present tense.
d
Ich arbeite dort an einem Projekt. (I’m working on a project there.) Present, am working. The
infinitive is arbeiten. The simple present is formed by adding -e to the end of the stem arbeit-.
The simple past would be ich arbeitete = arbeit- + -ete.
e
Ich studierte Mathematik an der Universität. (I studied math at the university.) Simple past, stud-
ied. The -te ending signals the simple past tense.
f
der Safe (the safe/vault) cognate
g
Ich schwimme oft im Sommer. (I often swim in the summer.) sentence
h
die Vorarbeit (the preliminary work) prefix
i
sie möchte gehen . . . (she’d like to go . . .) clause
j
mit meiner Familie (with my family) phrase
k
wunderbar (wonderful) suffix
l
pronoun; They’re on the table. Sie is a pronoun. The usual German word order is subject +
verb. Here, the subject is a pronoun.
m
adjective; There are a lot of exotic animals in the zoo. Exotische describes the plural noun
Tiere. The suffix ending -isch is often comparable to the suffix -ic or -ical in English.
n
conjunction; I like the penguins, but the elephants are more interesting. The two sentence
parts are joined by the conjunction aber (but).
o
definite, plural article; In the zoo, the animals aren’t happy. Die is the plural article in nomi-
native case, indicating that Tiere is plural.
p
preposition; I’d like to go for a walk in the park. Im is a preposition. The prepositional
phrase is im Park (in the park).
q
noun; Have you seen my black shoes? Schuhe is a plural noun.
r
verb; Your shoes are lying under the sofa. Liegen is a verb. It’s in second position in the sen-
tence after the subject deine Schuhe.
s
adverb; Please don’t drive so fast! Schnell is an adverb in this sentence because it describes
how the person is driving (fahre), and driving is the verb.

M
ost words in a German sentence take their cues from the nouns (or their
esteemed representatives, the pronouns). When studying German, you really
don’t know a new noun unless you know its characteristics, which include gender. So
for each new noun you come across, you need to accept its gender as a part of the
word and commit it to memory. In order to use nouns and pronouns (as well as 
adjectives and prepositions) in a German sentence, you need to know how they fit
together; this is the role of case. Case and gender are closely linked together, and I
consider them pieces of a puzzle in making German sentences. Case and gender may
look complicated at first, but as soon as you start fitting the pieces in, the picture
becomes clearer. In this chapter, you get the lowdown on how gender and case work
hand in hand to form various endings on the members of two large families of words:
the article family and the pronoun family.
Rounding Up Grammatical Genders
Not everything with gender lives and breathes. Listen to people talk about inanimate
objects, and you may hear them refer to the faithful bicycle they cherish, the noncom-
pliant computer they want to throttle, or the old jalopy they’re trying to coax up a hill
as he or she. Like these other things you may have a love-hate relationship with,
German words have gender.
In German grammar, gender is the classification of a noun or a pronoun into one of
three categories: masculine, feminine, or neuter. These genders often have nothing to
do with the meaning of the word; they’re simply an identity bracelet. Note that gender
refers to the word, not whatever the word represents. You need to know a word’s
gender because it can dictate the spelling of other words in the sentence.
So how can you get a grasp of gender so you can form a word correctly? Each time
you come across a new noun, be firm with yourself; find out its gender (and how to
form its plural form). With a little time, you can master the concept. This section
helps you identify a word’s gender, form plural nouns (and note the effects on
gender), eye indefinite articles, and identify when not to use articles.

Identifying German genders and 
figuring out which one to use
In English, you mark a noun as one of three genders: male (masculine), female (femi-
nine), or inanimate/neither (neuter). The descriptions male, female, and inanimate 
refer to living beings and things. The words in parentheses — masculine, feminine, and
neuter — refer to grammatical distinction, which is how German describes noun gender.
Gender distinction in English is natural, which means you need to know only whether
the noun refers to a female being, a male being, or an inanimate object (neither male
nor female). You can refer to the nouns as he, she, or it. And the articles you use — such
as the, a, and an — don’t tell you anything about gender at all. Look at these examples:
 Can you see the girl over there? She’s really tall. (You know the word girl refers to
a female, so you use she when you refer back to her in the second sentence.)
 The new German teacher is Herr Mangold. I think he comes from Bremen. (The
teacher is male, so you refer to him as he.)
 Have you seen the cool guitar in the shop window? It has 12 strings. (You refer to
an inanimate object as it.)
In German, you likewise have three genders, but gender distinction isn’t natural as it
is in English. It’s like a marker that refers to the word, not its meaning. The three
markers for the (singular) in German are der (masculine), die (feminine), and das
(neuter). For example, look at the words for eating utensils, where you have all three
bases covered: der Löffel (the spoon), die Gabel (the fork), and das Messer (the
knife). Why should a a spoon be masculine, a fork feminine, or a knife neuter? See any
logical pattern here? I don’t. Much of the gender designation in German is unnatural,
which means there’s no silver bullet to help you remember the gender of a word in
German. German dictionary entries identify nouns as der, die, or das. (Have a look at
Chapter 1 for more information on using a dictionary.)
The three gender markers, the definite articles der, die, and das, all mean the.
Compare the three following German sentences, which are the same as the three
English example sentences.
 Kannst du das Mädchen da drüben sehen? Es ist sehr groß. (Can you see the
girl over there? She’s really tall.) The girl in German is das Mädchen, a neuter
gender noun, as are all nouns ending in -chen. The ending indicates that a person
or thing is small or young. You refer to the girl as es, which means it. Remember,
this is simply a grammatical reference. It’s not an affront to you girls out there!
 Der neue Deutschlehrer ist Herr Mangold. Ich glaube, er kommt aus Bremen.
(The new German teacher is Herr Mangold. I think he comes from Bremen.) You
refer, grammatically speaking, to Herr Mangold as er (he). In most (but not all)
cases in German, male beings are der nouns, and female beings are die nouns.
 Hast du die tolle Gitarre im Schaufenster gesehen? Sie hat zwölf Seiten. (Have
you seen the cool guitar in the shop window? It has 12 strings.) Strange but true:
Grammatically speaking, a guitar is feminine, so you refer to it as sie (she). Most
nouns ending in -e are feminine nouns.
So how do you know exactly how to form/use genders correctly in German? First,
remember that gender is an integral part of each noun; it’s like a piece of the noun’s
20
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

identity. When you see a new noun, there are several ways to find out its gender. A
dictionary can help, and some of the following noun gender categories can offer you a
reasonable guess.
Some categories of nouns are consistently masculine, feminine, or neuter. For
instance, noun gender usually does follow the gender of people: der Onkel (the
uncle), die Schwester (the sister). Most often, the noun groups have to do with the
ending of the noun. Look at some fairly reliable groups in Tables 2-1 and 2-2 (note,
however, that there are exceptions).

Corralling plurals
When you want to make a noun plural in English, all you usually need to do is add an 
-s or -es. However, you have five ways to choose from when forming plural nouns in
German. But before you throw your hands up in dismay, think about how English varies
from the one standard form of making plurals with -s or -es. Think of mouse/mice, tooth/
teeth, child/children, shelf/shelves, phenomenon/phenomena, man/men, or country/
countries. Better yet, you can form the plural of some words in two different ways. Think
about hoof/hoofs/hooves. See what I mean? Many English plurals are also a matter of
memorization. So with both languages, you have a variety of plural endings and/or
changes in the noun.
Here’s the good news: You don’t have to worry much about gender in plural definite
articles in German because die (the in plural form) is all you need. Remember that die
corresponds to all three singular definite article forms: der (the, masculine), die (the,
feminine), and das (the, neuter).
Although die has a double duty of a singular feminine definite article and a plural defi-
nite article for all three genders, you can distinguish between singular and plural.
First, find out the difference in noun endings for each feminine noun in its singular
form and its plural form. Next, the context in the sentence may help you see whether
you’re dealing with a singular or plural form of the noun. You do have one more very
important factor that enters into the equation, and that’s case. Check out the section
“Calling all Cases: The Role Nouns and Pronouns Play.”
Table 2-3 shows you the five main ways of forming plural nouns in German. There’s no
hard and fast method of knowing which plural ending you need, but you can recog-
nize some patterns as you expand your vocabulary. At any rate, you need to place
high priority on knowing plural forms. Look at some patterns for forming plural nouns
(and keep in mind that there may be exceptions):
 Feminine nouns with (feminine) suffixes -heit, -keit, and -ung usually have 
an -en plural ending: die Möglichkeit (the possibility) →die Möglichkeiten 
(possibilities).
 Singular nouns ending in -er may not have any ending in plural: das Fenster (the
window) →die Fenster (the windows).
22
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

 Many nouns have an umlaut in the plural form, including many one-syllable
words: der Kuss (the kiss) →die Küsse (the kisses); der Traum (the dream) →
die Träume (the dreams).
 Some German nouns are used only in the plural or in the singular: die Ferien (the
[often: school] vacation) is always plural; die Milch (the milk) is always singular.

Chapter 2: Sorting Out Word Gender and Case

Lassoing indefinite articles
Just like English has two indefinite articles — a and an — that you use with singular
nouns, German also has two indefinite articles (in the nominative case): ein for mascu-
line and neuter-gender words and eine for feminine-gender words. An indefinite article
has many of the same uses in both languages. For example, you use it before a singular
noun that’s countable the first time it’s mentioned — Ein Mann geht um die Ecke
(A man is walking around the corner) — or when a singular countable noun represents a
class of things: for example, Ein Elefant vergisst nie (An elephant never forgets). You
can also use ein/eine together with a predicate noun (a noun that complements the
subject): Willy Brandt war ein geschickter Politiker (Willy Brandt was a skillful 
politician).
Another similarity with English is that there’s no plural form of the German indefinite
article ein/eine. (Also, depending on how you’re describing something plural, you
may or may not need to use the plural definite article.) Look at the following general-
ized statement, which requires no article: In Zermatt sind Autos verboten (Cars are
forbidden in Zermatt [Switzerland]).
The following shows you the definite articles and the corresponding indefinite arti-
cles (nominative case):
Gender/Number

Indefinite (a/an)

der
ein
Feminine
die
eine
Neuter

(no plural form)
With German nouns, the gender functions only as a grammatical marker. Table 2-4
shows some words for animals and other things you see on the farm. I chose this
vocabulary to illustrate how German noun gender appears random, but in effect, you
need to keep in mind that it’s grammatical, not natural gender — that is, the gender of
the word, not the animal itself. You find the English translation in the left-hand column
and the German noun in the column corresponding to its gender. For instance, ein
Pferd (a horse) appears in the neuter column. Note: However, a word that specifically
describes a male or female type of animal has the same gender as the animal; for exam-
ple, genders match in eine Stute (a mare) and ein Hengst (a stallion).

Missing absentee articles
In a few instances in German, you don’t use an article in the sentence. First of all, you
don’t use the indefinite article when you mention someone’s profession, nationality,
or religion. Look at the three examples:
Mein Onkel war General bei der Bundeswehr. (My uncle was [a] general in 
the army.)
Sind Sie Australier oder Neuseeländer? (Are you [an] Australian or [a] New
Zealander?) Nationalities are nouns in German.
Ich glaube, sie ist Lutheranerin. (I think she’s [a] Lutheran.) Members of a reli-
gious affiliation (or an affiliation such as a political party) are nouns in German.
Secondly, just as in English, you don’t use the definite article in generalized statements
using plural nouns in German. But you do use the plural definite article when you’re
not making a generalization: Die Bäume haben keine Blätter (The trees have no leaves).
Thirdly, names of countries have genders in German, most often das, or neuter (see
Chapter 3), but you generally don’t include the definite article, such as in Viele
berühmte Komponisten sind aus Deutschland oder Österreich (Many famous com-
posers are from Germany or Austria).
However, a small number of exceptions exist (see Chapter 3 for more countries that
are exceptions):
Die Schweiz gehört nicht zur Europäischen Union. (Switzerland doesn’t belong to
the European Union.) Note die, the feminine definite article.
Die Vereinigten Staaten sind die größte Volkswirtschaft der Welt. (The United
States has the largest economy in the world.) Note die, the plural definite article.
Fill in the missing German words as indicated by the English in parentheses. Refer to
the earlier tables for help in deciding whether you need der, die, das, ein, or eine and
for help selecting the correct endings for plurals.

Calling All Cases: The Roles 
Nouns and Pronouns Play
Cases indicate the role or function of nouns and pronouns in the sentence. English
and German both have cases, as do most languages. Cases allow you to know the
function of these words and how they connect with other words in a sentence. This
section identifies the four German cases and how they’re used, as well as how English
and German cases compare.
Identifying the four cases
German has four cases, and you need to know the ins and outs of them because they’re
the reason nouns, pronouns, articles, and adjectives all go through changes in
spelling the way a chameleon changes its color. Here are the four cases:
 Nominative case (nom.): This case is for the subject of the sentence. The subject
is a person or thing acting like the quarterback and calling the shots. In a sen-
tence, it’s who or what carries out the action. In Brady wirft den Ball (Brady
throws the ball), Brady is the subject.
Note: You use the nominative case for predicate nouns as well; these are nouns
(or noun phrases) that express more about the subject, such as a description or
an identification. For example, in he’s a remarkable football player, both the sub-
ject (he) and the predicate noun phrase (a remarkable football player) are in the
nominative case.
 Accusative case (acc.): This case is for the direct object of the sentence. The
direct object is a bit similar to the quarterback’s ball — the subject is acting on it.
In Ein Zuschauer fängt den Ball (A spectator catches the ball), the ball is the
direct object. Note: Prepositions also use the accusative case for the words they
connect. (See Chapter 15 for prepositions.)
 Dative case (dat.): This case is for the indirect object of the sentence. The indi-
rect object receives the direct object — it’s like the person the spectator gives
the ball to. In Der Zuschauer gibt seinem Sohn den Ball (The spectator gives his
son the ball), seinem Sohn (his son) is the indirect object, so it’s in the dative
case. In both German and English, you generally use the verb geben (to give) the
same way; you give (the verb) something (den Ball, accusative case) to someone
26
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

(seinem Sohn, dative case). Note: Prepositions also use the dative case for the
words they link with. (See Chapter 15 for prepositions.)
 Genitive case (gen.): This case shows possession. A person or thing can be the
possessor, or owner. In Die Mutter des Sohnes jubelt (The mother of the son
cheers), the son belongs to his cheering mother; des Sohnes is in the genitive
case. Note: Prepositions also use the genitive case for the words they link with.
(See Chapter 15 for prepositions.)
The word endings alter slightly according to the case. These changes are necessary
to identify what you want to express in a German sentence. (The case ending tables in
Appendix B come in extremely handy when you want to find the correct word and its
word ending.)
Eyeing the similarities and differences
When dealing with case, English and German have their share of similarities and differ-
ences. Before you can tackle the differences in cases, you first need to understand that
German and English do look at case in similar fashions. They include the following:
 The two languages share the same system of marking cases of personal pro-
nouns. In other words, pronouns have different forms (spellings) according to
the case they’re taking in a sentence. For example, in er lebt dort (he lives there),
the pronoun er (he) is the subject, so it’s in the nominative case. However, in ich
kenne ihn gut (I know him well), ihn (him) is the direct object, so it’s in the
accusative case. Spelling changes indicate the role the pronoun is playing: ich
changes to mich (I changes to me) and wir changes to uns (we changes to us).
The same is even true for relative pronouns: Der changes to dessen (who
changes to whose). I discuss relative and personal pronouns later, in “Putting
Pronouns in Place.”
 They use the nominative case — the same case you use for subjects — when
you have a predicate noun as the object of a sentence. A predicate noun is a
person, thing, or a concept that you place on equal footing with the subject.
Such nouns state more about the subject. For English and German, the verb sein
(to be) is the prime example of a verb that’s followed by the predicate nomina-
tive. German also uses the predicate nominative with the verbs bleiben (to stay,
remain), heißen (to be named, called), and werden (to become). (In English,
people often call these verbs linking verbs.) Look at this example: Mein Zahnarzt
ist auch der Zahnarzt meiner Eltern (My dentist is also my parent’s dentist). Mein
Zahnarzt and der Zahnarzt are both nominative case.
As for differences, English doesn’t have case endings for nouns, so it relies on 
word order to indicate which grammar hat the noun wears (English has case markers for
pronouns only). You usually have the following word order: subject-verb-object (or other
information, such as a prepositional phrase). Typically, you can recognize what the sub-
ject of the sentence is because you see it at the beginning of the sentence.
German does have different case spellings/endings for both articles and nouns, so word
order can be more flexible. Look at the word order of the two sentences that follow:
Der Junge liebt den Hund. (The boy loves the dog.)
Den Hund liebt der Junge. (The boy loves the dog.) 
27
Chapter 2: Sorting Out Word Gender and Case

In both sentences, der Junge (the boy) is the subject and den Hund (the dog) is the
object of the sentence; you have no difference between the two sentences as far as
meaning goes. In German, however, you do have a different case ending for the defi-
nite article. In the nominative singular case, it’s der (Hund), but in the accusative
case, it’s den (Hund). So why put den Hund (the direct object) at the beginning of the
sentence? Because in German, you can use that word order to emphasize that it’s den
Hund (and not some other house pet) that the boy loves. To get that type of empha-
sis in English, you need to say something like It’s the dog that the boy loves. English
speakers tend to create this kind of emphasis vocally, whereas in German, you can
accomplish such a nuance in both writing and speech.
Table 2-5 shows how the definite article the changes in both gender and case. You see
the four cases and the three genders, plus the plural form of the definite article the.

You have a grand total of six different definite articles in German and one lonely word,
the, in English. Practice makes perfect, so set your standards high for mastering the
definite article in German. Try your hand at the following exercises.

you need der, die, das, den, dem, or des. The grammar information in parentheses
offers you help in doing the exercises. You see these abbreviations: m. = masculine,
f. = feminine, n. = neuter, pl. = plural, nom. = nominative, acc. = accusative, dat. =

cedes them.

Putting Pronouns in Place
What’s the big deal about pronouns like you, me, it, them, this, that, and more? First of
all, these plentiful, useful, and essential critters are lurking in various corners of many
sentences. Second, they’re great for replacing or referring to nouns elsewhere in a
sentence. Third, like articles, they also need to change spelling/endings according to
the role they’re playing in a sentence (case) and the noun for which they may be
doing the pinch hitting.
This section discusses the three types of pronouns: personal, demonstrative, and rel-
ative pronouns. (See Chapter 11 for reflexive pronouns.) In German, they’re all more
affected by the gender/case patterns than in English, so I put them into tables for
your reference. These case tables help you to do the corresponding exercises in the
chapter, and you can also go to Appendix B for reference. I arrange such tables in
order of frequency of use: nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive.
Note: One more group of pronouns, called the possessive pronouns — such as mein
(my), dein (your), unser (our), and so on — are, technically speaking, classified as
adjectives; they have endings that resemble those of descriptive adjectives such as
interesting, tiny, or pink. (See Chapter 12 for more details on possessive adjectives/pro-
nouns.)
Personal pronouns
The personal pronoun family comes in very handy in all kinds of situations when you
want to talk (or write) about people, including yourself, without repeating names all
the time. You use the nominative case very frequently in most any language (every
sentence, after all, needs a subject), and German is no exception. (See the earlier
“Identifying the four cases” section for more on cases.)
Try to memorize the personal pronouns as soon as possible, and be sure you know all
three cases (no genitive here). With German personal pronouns, the biggest differ-
ence is that you have to distinguish among three ways to formulate how to say you to
your counterpart: du, ihr, and Sie. Other personal pronouns, like ich and mich (I and
me) or wir and uns (we and us), bear a closer resemblance to English. Note: The geni-
tive case isn’t represented among the personal pronouns because it indicates posses-
sion; the personal pronoun mich (me) can represent only a person, not something he
or she possesses.
Check out Table 2-6 for the personal pronouns. Notice that you and it don’t change,
and the accusative (for direct objects) and dative (for indirect objects) pronouns are
identical in English. I’ve added the distinguishing factors for the three forms du, ihr,
and Sie in abbreviated form: singular = s., plural = pl., informal = inf., formal = form.

24. Wie gefällt _________________ der neue Bürgermeister? (you/dat./s., form.)
Relating to relative pronouns
You use relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, that, and which) to include extra infor-
mation about a noun or pronoun expressed beforehand. You typically see relative
pronouns at the front of a relative clause where they refer back to the noun in the
main clause. And what is a main clause? It’s a sentence fragment that can stand on its
own and still make sense. A relative clause is a type of subordinate clause, which, as
30
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

you can probably guess, is the type of sentence fragment that can’t stand alone. (If
you find the terminology here — main clause and subordinate clause — confusing,
then refer to Chapter 1 for clarification.)
Look at the three key points for understanding what relative pronouns are all about:
 In German, you must use a relative pronoun to connect the two clauses. In
English, you don’t always have to. For example: Ist das der Mann, den du liebst?
(Is that the man [whom, that] you love?). In this sentence, the main clause is fol-
lowed by the relative clause, den du liebst. The second den is the relative pro-
noun connecting the two parts of the sentence.
 You place a comma between the main clause and the relative clause. In
English, people usually include this comma only before the relative pronoun
which. Remember that the relative clause begins with the relative pronoun. For
example: Bestellen wir die Pizza, die wir meistens essen (Let’s order the pizza
that we usually eat). No comma needed in English, but you do have a comma sep-
arating the main clause Bestellen wir die Pizza from the relative clause die wir
meistens essen, which begins with the relative pronoun die.
 Word order comes into play in relative clauses. You push the conjugated verb to
the end of the clause. For example: Gestern habe ich eine gute Freundin getrof-
fen, die ich seit Jahren nicht gesehen habe (Yesterday I met a good [female] friend
whom I haven’t seen for years). In the relative clause die ich seit Jahren nicht
gesehen habe, the verb has two parts, gesehen, the past participle, and habe,
which is the conjugated part of the verb. Habe is the last word in the sentence.
(For in-depth information on the present perfect verb tense, go to Chapter 16.)
Table 2-7 shows the breakdown of the relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, that) by
gender and case.

For this relative pronoun exercise, correct the mistakes in the sentences. You have
only one mistake in each sentence. Here are three types of errors to look for: 
 The wrong relative pronoun — think about gender and case
 No comma or a comma in the wrong place
 Wrong word order for verb(s) in the relative clause
Take your time as you hunt for the mistake. Check out Table 2-7. If you lose patience,
just guess. You find an explanation for the mistakes in the Answer Key.

Q. Sie sind die Kinder, den so viel Lärm machen.
A. Sie sind die Kinder, die so viel Lärm machen. (They’re the children who are making so
much noise.) The correct relative pronoun is die because you need the plural nominative
form; it refers to the plural die Kinder, and it functions as the subject (nominative case)
of the relative clause.

26. Ich kenne den Supermarkt, der du meinst. __________________________________

29. Du hast die CDs die mir gehören. __________________________________
30. Italien ist das Land das ich besuchen möchte. __________________________________
Demonstrating demonstrative pronouns
You use a demonstrative pronoun when you want to emphasize or point out the pro-
noun that’s replacing a noun. Besides the demonstrative pronouns he, it, they, and so
on, which are the translations (in parentheses) that you see in Table 2-8, you can also
translate these pronouns with the demonstratives this, that, these, or those. Similar to
English, the demonstrative pronoun generally comes at the beginning of a phrase. You
use demonstrative pronouns in the nominative case to emphasize the subject or in
the accusative case to emphasize the object.
There’s only a single difference between the nominative case and the accusative case,
and that’s with the masculine pronouns. Der is the nominative, and den is the accusa-
tive case. With the exception of the accusative den, you need to know only the
gender of the noun that you’re replacing — or whether it’s plural — and then use that
form of the demonstrative pronoun.

The words in bold are the nouns and the demonstrative pronouns that are standing in
for the noun to show emphasis:
 Ist der Flug ausgebucht? (Is the flight completely booked?) Der Flug is a mascu-
line singular noun.
Ja, der ist voll. (Yes, it’s full.) Der is the subject of the sentence, so it’s in the
nominative case, and it replaces der Flug, which is masculine singular. Der is the
masculine singular demonstrative pronoun in the nominative case.
 Wie findest du die Trauben? (How do you like the grapes?) Die Trauben is plural.
Die finde ich herrlich! (I think they’re terrific!) Die is the direct object of the sen-
tence, so it’s accusative. Die pinch hits for die Trauben, which is plural, so you
use the plural accusative demonstrative pronoun, die.
In the following exercise, decide which demonstrative pronoun is missing and write it
in the space provided. You need to determine whether the pronoun is replacing the
subject or the object in the sentence and which gender it takes.
Q. Ist die Straße relativ ruhig? Ja, _________________ ist absolut ruhig.
A. Ist die Straße relativ ruhig? Ja, die ist absolut ruhig. (Is the street relatively quiet? Yes, it’s
absolutely quiet.) Die Straße is a feminine singular noun. In the second sentence, die is the
subject (nominative case) that replaces die Straße, a feminine singular noun, so you use
die, the feminine singular nominative case demonstrative pronoun. 
31. Kaufst du den Kuchen für das Geburtstagsfest? Nein, _________________ backe ich heute
Nachmittag.
32. Ist das Fahrrad da drüben kaputt? Nein, _________________ ist in Ordnung.

word order. If you translate in your head word for word, you may fall into the trap of thinking
34
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

that the sentence looks okay. However, the verb (passt) needs to be at the end of the sentence,
even though in English, you usually place the adverb (besser) after the verb you’re describing.
A
Ich kenne den Supermarkt, den du meinst. (I know the supermarket you mean/are talking about.)
You need den as the pronoun in the accusative because you’re talking about a masculine noun,
der Supermarkt, and den is the direct object of the verb meinen (here: meinst), which is in the
relative clause den du meinst. 
B
Ist das die Frau, die bei der Polizei arbeitet? (Is that the woman who works for the police?) The
word order is incorrect because the verb arbeitet needs to be at the end of the relative clause.
C
Wie gefällt dir das Hemd, das ich anhabe? (How do you like the shirt [that] I’m wearing?) I prom-
ise not to lay too many traps. You need das because it replaces a neuter noun (das Hemd) and
it refers to the direct object [accusative case] of anhaben in the relative clause.
D
Du hast die CDs, die mir gehören. (You have the CDs that belong to me.) Mind your commas.
Even though English doesn’t need a comma between CDs and die, German does.
E
Italien ist das Land, das ich besuchen möchte. (Italy is the country [that] I’d like to visit.) Once
again, the comma is missing. However, in English, you don’t even need the word that in the rela-
tive clause.
F
Kaufst du den Kuchen für das Geburtstagsfest? Nein, den backe ich heute Nachmittag. (Are you
buying the cake for the birthday party? No, I’m baking it this afternoon.) Der Kuchen is masculine
singular. In the second sentence, den is the object of the sentence, so it’s accusative; it refers to
a masculine singular noun, der Kuchen. You need den, the masculine singular accusative
demonstrative pronoun.
G
Ist das Fahrrad da drüben kaputt? Nein, das ist in Ordnung. (Is that bicycle over there broken?
No, it’s [working] all right.) Das Fahrrad is neuter and singular. In the second sentence, das is
the subject, so it’s nominative. It replaces das Fahrrad, a neuter singular noun. You need das,
the neuter singular nominative demonstrative pronoun.
H
Kennen Sie diese Frauen? Ja, die kenne ich sehr gut. (Do you know these women? Yes, I know
them well.) Diese Frauen is plural. In the second sentence, die is the direct object, so it’s accu-
sative. Die pinch hits for die Frauen, which is plural, so you use the plural accusative demon-
strative pronoun die.
I
Wie findest du den Film? Den finde ich ganz schlecht. (What do you think of the film? I think it’s
really bad.) Der Film is masculine singular. In the second sentence, den is the object, in accusa-
tive case, and it punts for a masculine singular noun, der Film. You need the masculine singular
accusative demonstrative pronoun den.
J
Sind die Pferde freundlich? Ja, die sind freundlich. (Are the horses friendly? Yes, they’re friendly.)
Die Pferde is plural. In the second sentence, die is the subject, so it’s nominative. Die pinch
hits for die Pferde, which is plural, so you use the plural nominative demonstrative pronoun
die.
K
Ist Frau Lachner im Büro? Nein, die ist im Urlaub. (Is Frau Lachner in the office? No, she’s on
vacation.) Frau Lachner is feminine. In the second sentence, die is the subject, so it’s nomina-
tive, and it’s the placeholder for Frau Lachner, which is feminine singular. You use die, the fem-
inine singular demonstrative pronoun in the nominative case.

n German-speaking countries, I love seeing die Bedienung (the server) in street
cafés walking around with a bulging black leather change purse either tucked in
the back of the pants (the male version) or attached at the waist in front, neatly 
camouflaged under a starched white apron (the female version). When you say die
Rechnung, bitte, or its more informal version, Zahlen, bitte (the check, please), 
they have a crafty way of whipping it out of hiding and opening it wide, ready for
action. The next part is my favorite: watching the seasoned Kellner (waiter) take a
quick look, add up the tab without pen and paper, and blurt out, “Das macht siebe-
nundzwanzig Euro” (That’ll be twenty-seven euros). That’s the moment of reckoning:
How good are you at understanding numbers in German?
In this chapter, you work with basic building blocks: numbers, dates, time, countries,
and nationalities. Feeling confident that you can use these elements without any hesi-
tation means you’re ready to feed the waiter’s portable cash wallet. You can likewise
understand which Bahnsteig (track) the train is leaving from (and at what time) and
jump on the correct train when there’s been a last-minute track change.
Doing the Numbers
Forming and using German Zahlen (numbers) isn’t difficult. In fact, barring a few 
exceptions — notably the one I call the cart-before-the-horse — most numbers follow 
a logical pattern. This section covers cardinal and ordinal numbers as well as a few
other number situations so you can write and speak numbers in German without any
problems.
Counting off with cardinal numbers
Cardinal numbers have nothing to do with religious numbers colored red or a song-
bird that can sing numbers. These numbers are just plain, unadulterated numbers like
25, 654, or 300,000. In this section, you get a list of cardinal numbers, details on differ-
ences, and practice using these numbers.

Table 3-1 shows numbers 1–29. Notice a couple of points about numbers 21 and up:
 They’re written as one word: einundzwanzig (21), zweiundzwanzig (22).
 They follow the cart-before-the-horse rule — that is, you say the ones digit
before the tens digit, linking the words with und: for example, vierundzwanzig
(24; Literally: four and twenty). Does that remind you of the “four and twenty
blackbirds” from the nursery rhyme “Sing a Song of Sixpence”?

In spoken German, people commonly use zwo instead of zwei. This avoids the
confusion — acoustically speaking — with drei. To double-check that you heard zwei
and not drei in credit card numbers, prices, telephone numbers, room numbers, and
so on, simply ask, or repeat the number(s) using zwo. Say, for example, Ich wieder-
hole vier-zwo-acht (I’ll repeat four-two-eight). If you’re still not sure of the numbers
even after repeating them back to the speaker, try the failsafe route — ask for them
via e-mail: E-mailen Sie mir bitte diese Zahlen/ihre Telefonnummer (Please e-mail
me these numbers/your telephone number). In writing, the number two is always zwei.
Table 3-2 shows representative numbers spanning 30–999. Double-digit numbers
follow the same pattern as 20–29 do in Table 3-1: einunddreißig (31; literally: one 
and thirty), zweiunddreißig (32; literally: two and thirty), and the like. Numbers with
more digits likewise flip the ones and tens digits: For instance, you’d read 384 as drei-
hundertvierundachtzig, which literally means three hundred four and eighty.
Note that 30, unlike the other multiples of ten (40, 50, and so on) is spelled slightly dif-
ferently. Dreißig has no z in its ending, whereas the other double-digits do (vierzig,
fünfzig, and so on). This spelling difference affects pronunciation. Dreißig has an s
sound, and vierzig has a ts sound in the ending.

In German, people often say telephone numbers in double digits, so that’s when you
need to be super careful to get the sequence right as you write the number. The
number 76 20 93 88 would be sechsundsiebzig, zwanzig, dreiundneunzig, achtun-
dachtzig (six and seventy, twenty, three and ninety, eight and eighty). You may find it
easier to write the second digit first like this: You hear fünfundvierzig, so you write 
5 (fünf), leaving room in front of the digit (_5). Then write the 4 (und vierzig [and
forty]) in the tens place (45). German native speakers don’t do this, however, in case
you were wondering!
Especially in spoken German, you can use einhundert (one hundred) instead of 
hundert (hundred). This makes the number clearer to the listener. 
When referring to currency, you can talk about the bills like this: Imagine you’re cash-
ing 400€ in traveler’s checks and you want three 100€ bills and five 20€ bills. You say
Ich möchte drei Hunderter und fünf Zwanziger (I’d like three hundreds [euro bills]
and five twenties). The numbers Hunderter and Zwanziger are nouns, and you form
them like this: Take the number, for example hundert, and add -er to the end of the
number: hundert + -er = Hunderter.
For numbers higher than 999, look at Table 3-3. Notice that the decimal point in
German numbers represents the comma in English (see the “Other number-related
info” section later in this chapter).

Chapter 3: Laying the Foundations of German

In English, you use a comma to indicate thousands and a period to show decimals.
German (and many other languages) does the reverse: It uses a period (Punkt) for
indicating thousands, and the comma (Komma) works as a decimal point. Look at
these examples:
English
Deutsch
1 inch = 2.54 centimeters
1 Zentimeter (centimeters) = 0,39 Zoll (inches)
0,39 is read as null Komma drei neun
Mount Everest is 29,029 feet high.
Mount Everest ist 8.848 Meter hoch.
8.848 is read as achttausendachthunder-
tachtundvierzig
You’re hearing numbers on the phone, and you have to write them down. Write each
number in numerical form the German way, remembering that the comma and decimal
point are switched in German.

Getting in line with ordinal numbers
Ordinal numbers are the kinds of numbers that show what order things come in. (Was
that a duh moment for you?) You need ordinal numbers when you’re talking about
das Datum (the date), die Feiertage (the holidays), die Stockwerke in einem Hotel
(the floors in a hotel), and stuff like that.
Ordinal numbers function as adjectives, so they have the adjective endings you nor-
mally use in a sentence. (Go to Chapter 13 for specifics on adjectives.) The general rule
for forming ordinal numbers is to add -te to the numbers 1 through 19 and then -ste to
the numbers 20 and above. For example, Nach der achten Tasse Kaffee, ist er am
Schreibtisch eingeschlafen (After the eighth cup of coffee, he fell asleep on the desk).
40
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

This rule has three exceptions: erste (first); dritte (third); and siebte (seventh). For
example, Reinhold Messner war der erste Mensch, der Mount Everest ohne
Sauerstoffmaske bestieg (Reinhold Messner was the first person to climb Mt. Everest
without an oxygen mask).
Here are two other adjectives you need to know when putting things in order: letzte
(last) and nächste (next). You can use them to refer to a sequence of numbers, people,
things, or the like: 
Könnten Sie bitte die letzte Nummer wiederholen? (Could you repeat the last
number please?)
2006 wurde Bruno, der letzte wildlebende Bär in Deutschland, erschossen.
(In 2006, Bruno, the last wild bear in Germany, was shot.)
In order to write dates as numerals, write the digit followed by a period: Der 1. Mai ist
ein Feiertag in Deutschland (May 1st is a holiday in Germany). If you say the same
sentence, it’s Der erste Mai ist ein Feiertag in Deutschland.
Look at the examples of ordinal numbers in Table 3-4. The first column shows the
ordinal numbers as digits, the second column shows the same ordinal numbers as
words, and the third column shows how to say on the (fifth floor, sixth of December,
and so on).
Note: In Table 3-4, you see how to formulate the expression on the (first). It’s am +
ordinal number + en. Am is the contraction of an (on) + dem (the); it’s formed by
taking the preposition an, which uses the dative case here plus dem, the masculine
dative of der. You need to show dative case agreement with the adjective erste, so

Was Ist das Datum? Expressing Dates
To make sure you know how to express dates correctly, you need to know how to cor-
rectly use die Tage der Woche (the days of the week), die Jahreszeiten (the seasons),
and die Monate (the months) in your writing and speech. That way, you can clearly
and correctly ask and answer Was ist das Datum? (What is the date?).
Die Tage der Woche (the days of the week), their short forms used in calendars, and
some pertinent notes are as follows:
 Montag (Mo) (Monday)
 Dienstag (Di) (Tuesday)
 Mittwoch (Mi) (Wednesday)
 Donnerstag (Do) (Thursday)
 Freitag (Fr) (Friday)
 Samstag (Sa) (Saturday; used in most of Germany, as well as Austria and German-
speaking Switzerland) or Sonnabend (Sa) (Saturday; used in eastern and northern
Germany)
 Sonntag (So) (Sunday)
Note: In German-speaking countries, calendars begin with Montag.
You also need to have a firm grasp of the seasons and months when writing and
speaking German because they’re major parts of dates. (The last thing you want to do
is invite someone to your July barbeque and tell them it’s in the winter.) The following
outlines die Jahreszeiten (the seasons):
 der Frühling or das Frühjahr (the spring); you can use either term interchange-
ably in German speaking regions
 der Sommer (the summer)
 der Herbst (the autumn)
 der Winter (the winter)
The following list lays out die Monate (the months) of the year:
 Januar (January) or Jenner (January; often used in Austria)
 Februar (February)
 März (March)
 April (April)
 Mai (May)
 Juni (June; some German speakers say Juno to distinguish it, acoustically
speaking, from Juli)
 Juli (July; some German speakers pronounce it as “you lie” instead of “ju lee” to
avoid confusion with Juni)
 August (August)
 September (September)
42
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

 Oktober (October)
 November (November)
 Dezember (December)
When you refer to each day of the week, season, and month, remember that they’re all
masculine (der), except for das Frühjahr. When speaking or writing days of the week
and months, you generally leave out the article der. However, some combinations with
the dative prepositions an (on) and in (in) do include der in its dative form (see
Chapter 15 for more on prepositions). Also, seasons use the definite article. Take a
look at the examples, two of which include an and in with the article der:
Gestern war Dienstag, heute ist Mittwoch, und morgen ist Donnerstag. (Yesterday
was Tuesday, today is Wednesday, and tomorrow is Thursday.) The article der isn’t
used; you’re referring to the name of the day of the week.
Am kommenden Freitag fahre ich nach Flensburg. (I’m driving to Flensburg this
coming Friday.) An + dem = am; an is a dative preposition, and dem is the dative
masculine article derived from der. (The phrase am kommenden Freitag
describes the specific Friday; Literally: on this coming Friday.)
Im Frühling gibt es viele Feiertage in Deutschland. (In [the] spring there are a lot
of holidays in Germany.) In + dem = im; in is a dative preposition, and dem is the
dative masculine article.
Warum trägst du Sommerkleidung bei herbstlichen Temperaturen? (Why are
you wearing summer clothes during fall-like temperatures?) Bei is a dative preposi-
tion, so to form the dative plural ending to the adjective herbstlich, you add -en.
Note: Sommerkleidung is a combination of two nouns. Because the last word of
any noun combination determines the gender, you have der Sommer + die
Kleidung = die Sommerkleidung. In the prepositional phrase bei herbstlichen
Temperaturen, the preposition bei takes the dative case, so the adjective herb-
stlichen is in the dative plural.
Dates are written in the order of day-month-year in German (and in the other European
languages as well), such as Die Berliner Mauer ist am 09.11.1989 gefallen (The Berlin
Wall fell on 11/09/1989, or The Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989). You need the peri-
ods in dates in German, just as you need to write the date in English with a slash
between the month, day, and year. If you said the date with ordinal numbers, it’d be
like this: Die Berliner Mauer ist am neunten elften neunzehnhundertneunun-
dachtzig gefallen. Alternatively, you could say, . . . am neunten November.
Fill in the missing information shown in English in parentheses. Write the numbers as
words, remembering to include am (on the) if necessary. (For more info on numbers,
see “Doing the Numbers,” earlier in this chapter.)
Q. Er hat Geburtstag _____________________________________________. (on February 29th)
A. Er hat Geburtstag am neunundzwanzigsten Februar. (It’s his birthday on February 29th.)

On the Clock: Expressing Time
You’re in Interlaken (in der Schweiz) (Interlaken, Switzerland) and you want to know
what time it is. You have four choices: Look at your own watch; look at the nearest
clock tower (most are absolutely stunning — many have four clocks, one for each
side) and find out how accurate the Swiss are in keeping time (very!); buy a Rolex for
1,399 Swiss francs (no euros in Switzerland); or practice understanding German clock
time by asking someone on the street, Wie viel Uhr ist es? (What time is it?). You’re
just about guaranteed he or she will tell you the precise time.
In conversational German, you use the system comparable to English, in which nach
(past) refers to times past the hour up until half past. Vor (to) refers to the times from
half past to the next hour.
You use Halb (Literally: half ) to refer to half past the hour. However, in German, you
name the next hour; for example, halb acht (Literally: half eight) means half past
seven, or 7:30.
For official time, such as train or plane schedules (and frequently in everyday German),
you use the 24-hour system, reading the numbers as you’d read a digital clock. In other
words, for 1 p.m. and later, you add 12; 2 p.m. + 12 is therefore 14 Uhr: Unser Zug fährt
um 14.45 Uhr (pronounced vierzehn Uhr fünfundvierzig) (Our train leaves at 2:45
p.m.). Table 3-5 shows the German time expressions and their English equivalents.

es ist eins (it’s one) when you leave out the word Uhr. All other clock times are the
same number with or without the word Uhr, as seen in Table 3-5.
The numerical method of telling time may be the easiest. German traditionally uses a
period where English uses a colon. Note that when you read the time, you say Uhr
(o’clock) where the period appears. Alternatively, you can leave it out, just as you can
leave out the o’clock in English. For example, Um wie viel Uhr kommst du? Um sechs
oder um sieben? (What time are you coming? At six or at seven?). Note also that the
use of Uhr in the question means the word time in English. You can also say Die Bank
öffnet um 8.30 Uhr (pronounced acht Uhr dreißig) (The bank opens at 8:30 a.m.). 
Read the times given in words in the sentences that follow, and write the correct time,
German style (using the 24-hour system) as numerals. To help you out, some exam-
ples have two German alternatives for the time given. Then write the English transla-

Chapter 3: Laying the Foundations of German

Naming Countries, Nationalities,
and Languages
As the world appears to be shriveling up in size due to telecommunication, English
seems to be relentlessly pushing its way into other languages. That may be true in
some respects, but one area in which countries and nationalities are holding their
own is that of place names. Each country has its own spelling, pronunciation, and
even a different word altogether for one-and-the-same place. One of my favorites is
Munich, the capital of Bayern (Bavaria). In German, it’s called München, and it’s
world-famous for its Oktoberfest (no translation: think beer). So far, so good.
In Frankreich (France), Munich is pronounced the distinctive French way, with the
stress on the last syllable (Mu neek). Yet the Italians call it Monaco, which can be really
confusing if you’ve just come to Munich from the French Riviera (luckily, that’s called
the Côte d’Azur in French and German) and you’ve passed through a tiny country you
thought was the home of the Grimaldi dynasty and not the home of the Oktoberfest.
The point is that place names often change between languages; for example, one of 
the largest lakes nestled in the Alps, Lake Constance, is called Bodensee (Literally:
ground/bottom lake) in German, although there is a town of Konstanz situated on
Bodensee.
Take heart! In this section, I get you off the ground with a simplified bird’s-eye view of
names in German. You have an overview of the German names for countries, national-
ities, languages, and some regions that are relevant to German-speaking Europeans,
both geographically and economically. As you go through this section, imagine you’re
traveling through Europe. By the end, you should understand a lot about which
places German speakers are referring to.
When traveling in Europe, looking at maps is likely to be very confusing when you’re
not aware of what a place is called in English, let alone how it’s named in other lan-
guages. Using maps that have both English and the place names in their own language
is a huge help when you’re not familiar with different spellings of place names.
Eyeing German-speaking countries
Deutschsprachige Länder (German-speaking countries) are mostly located in the
center of western Europe. In the countries in Table 3-6, German is the dominant lan-
guage. You see the English and German names, nationalities, and adjectives.

More than a million French in the region of Alsace speak a dialect of German. Large
numbers of people still speak German in the countries under the influence of the
former Soviet Union. And there are German-speaking people in Namibia, the former
German Southwest Africa.
Grammatically speaking about countries,
nationalities, and languages
When dealing with languages, terms for citizens, and adjectives of countries, use 
the standard rules for making sentences. Nouns and adjectives need to follow rules
on gender (der, die, das), case (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive), and
number (singular or plural). (For these rules, see Chapter 2 for nouns and Chapter 12
for adjectives.) Notice that the adjectives aren’t capitalized but names of languages
are capitalized, as are terms for citizens because they’re nouns.
BMW, Mercedes, und VW sind deutsche Autos. (BMW, Mercedes, and VW are
German cars.) The adjective deutsche is plural, in the nominative case.
Sie sprechen fließend Deutsch. (You speak fluent German.) Here, Deutsch is the
language, so it’s capitalized.
For the most part, countries in German, such as Kanada (Canada) or Mexiko
(Mexico), are neuter. You don’t need das (the) if you want to say something like Mein
Schwager kommt aus Brasilien (My brother-in-law is from Brazil). You need the article
das only when an adjective comes in front of the name of the country, as in Das grüne
Grönland gibt es nicht (There is no green Greenland).
A few countries have plural, feminine, or masculine gender. You need to know them
because you always include the article when you name such countries:
 A few plurals are die Vereinigten Staaten, die Philippinen, and die Niederlande
(the United States, the Philippines, and the Netherlands).
 A few countries with feminine gender are die Schweiz, die Türkei, and die
Ukraine (Switzerland, Turkey, and Ukraine).
47
Chapter 3: Laying the Foundations of German

 Masculine-gender countries are usually Muslim countries: der Irak (Iraq) and der
Iran (Iran).
As for the actual languages, remember that a language is a noun, so it’s capitalized.
To form the name of a language, you generally take the country name, add or subtract
a few letters (mostly for pronunciation purposes), and put -isch onto the end:
Portugal →Portugiesisch (Portugal →Portugese). Of course, there are a few oddballs
like Aseri, spoken in Azerbaijan.
German neighbors and trading partners
Germany enjoys a solid reputation for its high quality of Exportartikel (export goods)
and Dienstleistungen (services). With the introduction of the euro in 2002 and the
recent expansion of the Europäische Union (European Union) to 27 members in 2007,
Germany’s major trading partners are still — for the most part — its European neigh-
bors. Table 3-8 lists Germany’s major trading partners in alphabetical order, showing
the country name in English and German, the nationalities, and the adjective for that
country.

 Picking out combination words
 Grasping word families and friends
 Understanding word structure
U
nless you want to confine your conversations to things like The girl is pretty, I’m
hungry, and Do you speak English? you probably want to develop your German
vocabulary. Luckily, paying attention to how words are related to each other can boost
your word power exponentially. As you discover how words are formed, you can cate-
gorize and store them in logical groups, such as word families, word categories, oppo-
sites, prefixes, and suffixes. You can also practice identifying cognates (words with a
common source that mean the same thing in two languages), near cognates (words
with a common source that mean nearly the same in two languages), and false friends
(words that look the same but mean something different in two languages).
Even when you encounter a word you don’t know, if you can identify something about
that word, you may be able to figure out its meaning. For example, the word das
Reisefieber has two easily recognizable parts, Reise (travel) and Fieber (fever);
together they approximate the idea of excitement about traveling. This chapter takes a
look at word structures specific to the German language, providing great opportuni-
ties for interesting word storage, among them compound nouns and picture language.
Working with Word Combinations
Word combinations are the kinds of words that have two or more parts, some of
which may be separate words combined into one; others may be combinations of a
prefix together with a noun, adjective, or verb. You find them frequently in both
English and German, and in the case of German nouns, they can sometimes look
daunting from the standpoint of sheer length, yet when you’re familiar with one or
more parts of the word, you can often piece the others together.
Your key to increasing your vocabulary beyond the basics is getting the hang 
of recognizing the separate parts that fit together to form word combinations. 
Before you know it, you’ll be feeling comfortable with the likes of words like das
Außendienstverkaufspersonal (field sales force/personnel ) without thinking twice
because you’re able to figure out what the separate parts mean: außen = external, 
outside, Dienst = service, employment, Verkauf = sales (the verb verkaufen = to sell,
kaufen = to buy), and Personal = personnel, staff . Each word element is useful as a 
separate word, so you’re getting five words for the price, er, effort of one. This section
takes a closer look at word combinations, including compound nouns, picture 
compound nouns, and verb combinations.

Spotting compound nouns
At times, German looks like a language made up of complicated, extremely long
words. In fact, some people say it not only sounds heavy and ponderous but also looks
heavy and ponderous. Most of these culprit words, called compound words, are really
quite innocuous. After all, they’re nothing more than a few smaller words strung
together. German is rife with compound words that may or may not be two or more
separate words in English: Der Geschäftsmann (the businessman) is one word in both
languages, but der Kugelschreiber (the ballpoint pen) is two words in English.
Recognizing the parts of compound words is a great way to increase your vocabulary
threefold, sometimes more, depending on how many words combine to form a single
word. When you break down a long word into its parts, you can generally make a very
accurate guess about what the compound means.
A compound noun is a combination of two or more words, usually both nouns. Some
compound nouns are the exact equivalent of two words in English. For instance, das
Fotoalbum (photo album) is a combination of das Foto (photo) + das Album (album).
Others have a slightly different meaning when compared to their usage as separate
words: Der Ruhetag (closing day) is die Ruhe (quiet, calm) + der Tag (day); “Montag
Ruhetag” could be a sign outside a restaurant indicating that it’s closed on Monday.
My personal favorites among the compound nouns are what I call picture words; they
describe the meaning of the word in visual language that differs from the descriptions
in English. I deal with picture words in the next section of this chapter.
There are a small number of changes in spelling in some compound words. The 
most common added letter you find is s; for example, it appears in the middle of die
Arbeitszeit (the working hours), a combination of die Arbeit (the work) and die Zeit 
(the time). In the word der Orangensaft (the orange juice) the n added in the middle 
indicates the plural of die Orange (die Orangen). Sometimes a letter or two are
dropped: Das Fernsehprogramm (the TV program) is comprised of der Fernseher
or das Fernsehen (both mean TV ) with the last two letters dropped (-en or -er) plus 
das Programm.
Compound nouns take the gender of the last word in the combination. Note that the
following combination is feminine: der Sport (sport[s]) + die Abteilung (department) =
die Sportabteilung (sports department in a department store).
Wo sind meine Tennisschuhe? (Where are my tennis shoes?) Die Tennisschuhe =
das Tennis (Tennis) + die Schuhe (shoes).
Sie sind im Wohnzimmer. (They’re in the living room.) Das Wohnzimmer =
wohnen (to live) + das Zimmer (room).
Was ist deine Lieblingsspeise? (What’s your favorite food?) Die Lieblingsspeise =
Lieblings (favorite, combined with other words) + die Speise (food).
Ich liebe Himbeereis. (I love raspberry ice cream.) Das Himbeereis = die
Himbeere (raspberry) + das Eis (ice cream).
52
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

There’s no easy test to determine whether a word is in fact a compound noun. Just look at
the word, try to see where it breaks down, figure out what the parts mean, and put it back
together again, making a reasonable stab at the meaning of that compound word. You
may recognize one part as the noun form of a verb you know, or you may see a prefix that
you’re familiar with. The context of the word in a sentence is usually a good means of
making an educated guess. And good dictionaries are your best bet if you’re still stumped.
Combine the words from the word bank with the words in the exercise to form com-
pound nouns in the exercise. Include the definite article. Some words undergo a slight
change. Then write the English definition of the word next to the compound noun.

Chapter 4: Building Your Word Power

Describing picture compound nouns
With most compound nouns, you can easily get the general idea of what they mean 
by putting the meanings of the two (or more) parts together to form one meaning.
However, with picture compound words, meaning isn’t exactly obvious at first glance.
These nouns may be only single words in English or English words that appear to be
descriptive, making it a challenge to figure out their meaning.
das Haus (house) + die Schuhe (shoes) = die Hausschuhe (slippers, shoes you
wear in the house)
The key to understanding the meaning of a picture compound word is using your
imagination to think figuratively if the literal meaning doesn’t make sense.
Alternatively, try thinking (way) outside the box. For example, take the word der
Zahnstein. It’s made up of two reasonably common nouns, Zahn (tooth) and Stein
(stone). So what in the world is a tooth stone? You may first conjure a picture of a
stone that looks like a tooth. Good idea; close, but no cigar. Now imagine what it
would look like to have stones, or stone-like material attached to a tooth. Does that
sound like a possible description of tartar? That’s it! Zahnstein is the reason the
dental hygienist is always reprimanding you!
Read the hints in the following exercise; each hint is for the picture compound noun
that follows. Try to translate words of the compound noun separately, and then guess
the meaning of the compound word.
Q. (Ich gebrauche ihn mit einer Nadel und Faden.) der Fingerhut _________________ +
_________________ = _________________.
A. finger + hat = thimble (I need it with a needle and thread.)
11. (Ich brauche sie im Winter.) die Handschuhe _________________ + _________________ =
_________________.

Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

Checking out verb combinations
Nouns aren’t the only ones that can combine to form long words; verbs are guilty of
the same habit. Figuring out the meaning of a verb combination is just as easy when
you can break down the parts, which may be prefixes, prepositions, or verbs that
combine with another verb.
How do you figure out the meaning of the verb? You need to break down the verb into
its parts, try to figure out what each part means, and put it back together again. The
following tips can help:
 Try to recognize the discrete parts of the verb. Look for prefixes or preposi-
tions at the beginning of the word.
 Find out what these prefixes or prepositions mean if you don’t know already.
(Chapter 10 deals with separable-  and inseparable-prefix verbs, Chapter 15 han-
dles prepositions, and Chapter 11 includes a section on verbs and prepositions.)
Some prefixes or prepositions have equivalents in English. Take the example of
vor: It usually means before, and as far as pronunciation goes, it resembles the
prefix fore- in words like foreshadow or foresight. With others, you may need to
find out what they mean: Zusammen (together) doesn’t resemble English, but it
has the same number of syllables, so that may be a method of remembering its
meaning. 
Take the verb regenerieren. Break it down into re- + gener- + -ieren. The prefix re-
has the same meaning in English (to repeat an action), and -ieren is a variation on the
regular infinitive verb ending -en; it often means -ate or -ify in English. Putting the
word together, you can make a correct guess that regenerieren means to regenerate.
Ich möchte zum Hotel zurückgehen. (I’d like to go back to the hotel.) The prefix
zurück means back or return, and the verb gehen is to go or walk.
Die Familie ist zum Erntedankfest zusammengekommen. (The family gathered
together for Thanksgiving.) The verb zusammenkommen is in present perfect tense;
the prefix zusammen means together, and kommen means to come.
Furthermore, many nouns are derived from the verb combinations. Most have differ-
ent endings. Look at these examples:
The verb is fortsetzen (to continue); the noun is die Fortsetzung (continuation,
sequel).
The verb is zubringen (to take to); the noun is der Zubringer (feeder). Ein
Zubringerbus is a shuttle bus.
Match the English definitions of the verbs with the given German verb. Look at the
prefix/preposition/verb tables in Chapters 10 and 11 first, or try to make an educated
guess. Refer to the English word bank; if you want to challenge yourself more, cover
the list — now! Then write the English definition without looking.

Grasping Word Families 
and Word Categories
Memory works best when your brain can make lots of connections, so grouping
German words in word families and word fields can help you remember vocab for the
long term. This is good news because enhancing your vocabulary dramatically
increases the ways you can express yourself.
When you come across a new verb, especially a frequently used verb, find out some
other words related to it. Use a good German-English dictionary as a reference (see
Chapter 1 for information on using a bilingual dictionary). You often find related
words and expressions under the headword (main dictionary entry), especially if 
it’s a frequently used verb. Scan for words in bold under that headword, and record
new words in groups using the headword for reference. For example, under the 
headword kommen (to come), you find ankommen (to arrive), herkommen (to come
over), hervorkommen (to come out, like the sun or blossoms), and a large number of
expressions using kommen; for example, Wie komme nach Wien? (How do I get to
Vienna?) or auf etwas kommen (to think of something, to get into something).
This section discusses how you can use word families and word categories to your
advantage to strengthen your German vocabulary. 
Working with word families
Picture a family seated around a bountiful table at Thanksgiving. Replace the family
members with words, put the family elder(s) at the head of the table, and there you 
have it: a word family. It’s made up of words that have the same root or origin. Some
word families are very numerous, including ten or more nouns (descendants of the
elders), a verb (family elder), adjectives, and maybe even an adverb that are all related.
Some word families have an extended family: cousin words that have the same root but
are words combined from other families.
56
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

Nouns and verbs in an English word family may be exactly the same or slightly differ-
ent: to heat and the heat, to live and the life. German follows suit, but it puts an infini-
tive ending, -en, on verbs: arbeiten, die Arbeit. Some English and German words have
suffixes — endings to words. English adjective endings include -able, -y, and -al, as in
likeable, windy, and critical. Some German adjective endings are -lich, -ig, and -isch, as
in lieblich (delightful, or sweet as in wine), windig (windy), and kritisch (critical). (See
Chapter 13 for more on adjectives.)
Consider, for example, the verb arbeiten (to work). It’s pretty much the same as the
noun die Arbeit (the work). Other words in the same family include der Arbeiter (the
worker) and die Arbeiterin (the female worker). The extended family includes word
combinations like die Arbeiterschaft (the workforce), der Arbeitsablauf (the work-
flow), arbeitswütig (workaholic — an adjective in German), and so on.

Picture that! Working with word categories
Imagine a traditional family farm scene: succulent green fields with horses and cows
grazing contently in them. Next to the fields is a pond with a few ducks and geese
paddling around in it. Over by the barn is a cat on the prowl for mice hiding in the
straw, and the farmer is climbing onto his tractor. So is this section about German
farms? Not quite. It’s about helping you organize words into logical categories or
groups to make it easier to retrieve them at a later time. In the case of this scene, if
you start with the category der Bauernhof (the farm), you’d include a list of farm ani-
mals and the words for barn, farmer, tractor, and so on.
To record new vocabulary in categories, use the techniques that work best with that
category. For example, draw a picture of a farm scene and label it in as much detail as
you can. You won’t need to use any English translations at all. (Even if your rendition
of a duck does look like a seagull, you know what it is.) The types of categories are
practically limitless, and they can include wherever your interests in German lie.
The key to successful word storage is choosing the best means of organizing words. By
organizing the words well, you usually don’t need to translate them into English. You’re
now on the road to thinking in German. Select meaningful categories that correspond to
any interests you have, personal or professional, sports or hobbies, intellectual or 
mundane — the sky’s the limit. When you’re motivated by such topics, you’re bound 
to find it extremely easy and fun to find and store words in your area of interest.
58
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

Here are some great ways to store new words:
 List related words in an order that’s meaningful to you. For instance, write the
names of vegetables from best to worst tasting, or arrange colors from light to
dark: white, beige, yellow, orange, red, and so on. Or tell a story — put words
describing your morning routine in sequential order.
 Write words in a way that reflects their meaning. For instance, write color
words in German in the color they represent.
 Develop a “word fan” showing the spectrum of words in a range of descrip-
tion, such as verbs of speed starting with kriechen (to crawl) on up to laufen
(to run). Other categories of words that work well arranged in this fashion are
adverbs of frequency, arranged from niemals (never) to immer (always), and 
a range of emotions, starting with deprimiert (depressed) on up to entzückt
(delighted).
 Describe how to do simple tasks or routines like making coffee, hanging a pic-
ture on the wall, or getting ready to go to work, using as many verbs as possible.
 Label words describing location where they belong on a picture or a map. To
remember prepositions like over, under, beside, and in front of, draw a picture of
a living room, and write the word über (above) over the coffee table. Or draw an
object, say a cat under the table, and write a sentence like Die Katze ist unter
dem Tisch (The cat’s under the table). Use a street map for labeling links (left),
rechts (right), an der Kreuzung (at the intersection), and so on.
 Make a web or chart to show how ideas relate. For instance, if you’re listing
words related to air travel, write the word der Flughafen (the airport) in the
middle. Then add several branches for word groups like die Abfertigung 
(check-in), die Sicherheitskontrolle (security check), im Flugzeug (in the
airplane), and so on.
 Create a diagram. Sketch a computer and label the parts (most are the same 
in English and German). Remember to include the articles der/die/das.
 For individual words within a group, draw a picture of that word and incorpo-
rate the word into the picture. Nouns, adjectives, and even verbs lend them-
selves well to this storage method. Take, for example, der Berg (the mountain).
Draw a the outline of a mountain and fill it with the word der Berg inside it. Draw
adjectives to resemble what they mean: Write gross and klein (large and small)
using huge letters and tiny letters. Picture-compound nouns are great fun to
draw. With der Leckerbissen (the treat; Literally: tasty + bite), draw someone lick-
ing their lips or whose mouth is watering, add a plus sign (+), and draw some
teeth biting down on something you love to eat.
Write die Farben (the colors) in the exercise, listed in order from light to dark. The
hints can help you get the order I’ve come up with.
Q. _________________ (die Farbe von Schnee)
A. weiß (white) (the color of snow)
43. _________________ (dasselbe Wort auf Englisch)
44. _________________ (die Farbe von Osterglocken [daffodils])
59
Chapter 4: Building Your Word Power

45. _________________ (ich esse sie gern)
46. _________________ (eine Farbe von Nelken [carnations])
47. _________________ (ich sehe . . .)
48. _________________ (im Frühling sind die Blätter der Bäume . . .)
Streamlining Word Storage
In reading and listening to German, you’re likely to find a surprisingly large number of
words that are comparable in the two languages (words that have the same common
source and mean the same thing); they’re called cognates. Their cousins are the near
cognates: Words that have a common source, mean nearly the same in two languages,
and may be spelled somewhat differently. And then you run across the false friends,
the ones that have a surprisingly different meaning in the other language, even
though they look the same.
Half the battle of vocabulary acquisition is a matter of knowing how a word fits into a
larger group, and of course, how to use it. Imagine a chest of many drawers marked
cognates, near cognates, and false friends. As you open the drawers of this section one
by one, you find hands-on opportunities to increase your awareness of storing words
in ways that you can easily retrieve them.
Recognizing cognates and near cognates
Cognates and near cognates are words with a common source that mean the same or
nearly the same thing in two languages. In the case of German and English, many
words have the same roots, although some have undergone spelling changes over
time. Aside from der Arm, der Kindergarten, der Rucksack, die Wanderlust, die
Zeitgeist, and other such classics, you can discover a plethora of others, many of
which you can group by the similarity of their structure. As you recognize the similar-
ities, place the words accurately into their groups. Some minor spelling changes are
easy to recognize; for instance, the letter c in English is usually k in German, sh in
English is sch in German, and so on.
Here’s a small sampling of characteristics that signal English/German cognates:
 Nouns ending in -er often denote a person who works doing the job that word
describes. Someone who designs is a designer, which is a cognate — der Designer.
Nouns ending in -or build a similar group of cognates: der Professor.
 Adjectives ending in -al are often cognates: liberal.
 Verbs ending in -ieren are often near cognates: vibrieren = to vibrate.
 French words used in English and German are sometimes cognates: das Portrait.
 German words used in English aren’t exactly cognates because they’re the same
word, but why not make use of this precious resource? der Ersatz = the alterna-
tive, replacement
60
Part I: The Basic Building Blocks of German 

Here are some verbs that are near cognates: denunzieren (denounce), existieren
(exist), fotografieren (photograph), frustrieren (frustrate), reformieren (reform), 
regulieren (regulate), and simulieren (simulate).
Arrange the following words from the word bank into groups according to five 
characteristics for categorizing cognates described in this section: nouns ending in 
-er, nouns ending in -or, adjectives ending in -al, French words, and German words.
To challenge you, the words that belong to the three categories with endings (-er, -or,
and -al) are written without the ending. Add the ending to the word after the hyphen,
and list the word in the correct category.

Chapter 4: Building Your Word Power

False friends: Bad buddies
The following can easily happen: You start getting chummy with some words that are the
same in both languages. You’re borrowing English words left and right, plopping them
into German phrases with great success. Along comes a word in German that looks like
an English word, so you decide to use it. It’s your new German colleague’s birthday, so
you buy a little present, walk up, and say “Ein Gift für Sie.” You’ve just offered him some
poison! (Yes, it’s a unique gift, but did you have to blurt it out and ruin the surprise?)
That’s right: Das Gift means poison. The word for present is das Geschenk.
If you assume that you can blithely use a word you read in German without being sure
of what it actually means, watch out! German is rife with potential bloopers, called
false friends or false cognates, like das Gift. Conversely, German has borrowed words
from English, using them differently. A cellphone is called ein Handy in German.
When cellphones were new on the market, some German speakers would swear up
and down that handy was the correct expression in English as well. Without a handy
bilingual dictionary, leave any questionable words out of your active vocabulary for
the time being. Better safe than sorry.
Take a look at some words that can potentially lead to mix-ups. For example, Das
ist ein bekanntes Gymnasium. A famous gym? Strange, you think, as the tour guide
points out a large building that looks an awful lot like a school. That’s because das
Gymnasium is a high school in German. Another one: Das ist ein grosses (large) Bad.
What, a big bad somebody, like big bad John? Well, that’s one way to remember what
it means; das Bad is a bathroom, john, loo, head, whatever you want to call it.
To remember some tricky false friends, draw a picture of what the word means and
label it, show what the word means by incorporating the word into the picture itself,
or make the letters of the word take the shape of an object. You may be visualizing
something slightly bizarre, and that’s the fun part of it, which will probably help you
remember the word more readily. Der Herd (stove, range) may work if in your mind’s
eye, you see a whole bunch of stoves with horns out on the range in Texas. (Note: Die
Herde means the herd, as in a group of cows. It’s a different entry in the dictionary,
however, because it has a different meaning, spelling, and gender.)
The following 12 German words embedded in sentences have a different meaning from
their English lookalikes. Read the word in the context of the sentence, look at the
English definitions in the word bank, and write the definition that logically fits.

Getting Started Now: 
Writing in the Present

In this part . . .
T
his part explains how to express yourself in the here
and now. The present tense is a versatile workhorse in
German, standing in for a variety of past, present, and
future English tenses in a surprising array of situations;
Chapter 5 deals with the particulars. Chapters 6 and 7 pro-
vide you with the nuts and bolts you need to formulate
questions, and they tell you how to give reasonably 
accurate and understandable answers. Wondering what
comes next? Speculation is one part of Chapter 8. That
chapter also lets you practice expressing doubt, hope,
uncertainty, and hypothetical situations. 
Chapter 9 is where you find the lowdown on modal verbs,
the kind that help you say things such as may I, I’d like to,
should we, and I can. In Chapter 10, you get the hang of
separable and inseparable prefix verbs. Separable prefix
verbs have two parts that sometimes get separated in a
sentence. Easy? Sort of. In a dictionary, the verb is listed
with the two parts stuck together, so you need to be able
to recognize such verbs in their stuck and unstuck usage.

Chapter 5
Grasping the Present Tense
In This Chapter
 Using subject pronouns 
 Conjugating present-tense verbs
 Conjugating sein (to be) and haben (to have)
You’re driving down the road when you see a small herd of cows. Some are graz-
ing, others are chewing their cud. Okay, so they might be drooling, too, but even
so, it gets you on to thoughts about milk, and the idea hits you: You’re going to get
some ice cream. You say to yourself, “I think I’ll go to Jan and Berry’s because I really
do owe myself a treat. After all, I’ve been working hard, and —” you wake up and real-
ize you’ve been dreaming for the past five minutes. Darn!
Believe it or not, this isn’t a plug for ice cream. It is, however, a superb example of
how streamlined German can be, because you can put all the verbs in the preceding
paragraph (marked in italics) in the present tense in German. This multitalented
player stands in for the plain old simple present tense (gets, wake up), the present
continuous (are driving, are chewing), an emphatic form (do owe), some futures (are
going to get, will go), and even references to actions that started in the past (have
been working, have been dreaming). Das hört sich gut an, oder? (That sounds good,
doesn’t it?) (For more information on the terminology of verb tenses, see Chapter 1.)
And all along, you thought I was going to start out with something along the lines of
“First things first: The present tense is the verb form you use to talk about the present.
Period.” Well, that’s true for sure, but there’s more to it. In this chapter, you see how
to use subject pronouns with the present tense and how to conjugate regular and
irregular verbs. You also see how versatile the present tense is.
Simplifying Subject Pronouns and 
Their Relationship to Verbs
Before you can understand the present tense (and all other verb tenses), you need a
firm grasp of the subject pronouns. These pronouns stand in for long-winded nouns
and pop up everywhere in any language, and they play a key role in helping you get
your verbs in shape. You always see them in tables that conjugate verbs, so get them
down pat before you start work on the verbs that accompany them.

You use subject pronouns — ich (I), du (you), er (he), sie (she), es (it), and so on — to
express who or what is carrying out the action or idea of the verb. They refer to the
noun without naming it, which means they can serve as placeholders so you don’t
have to sound redundant by repeating the noun. (For more discussion on pronouns,
check out Chapters 1 and 2.) In order to use subject pronouns, you need to know
which person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural) the pronoun rep-
resents; for example, ich (I) = first person, singular. To connect the correct subject pro-
noun to a present-tense verb, you need to know which conjugated verb form to use. I
lay out this information in “Getting Your Verbs in Shape: Present-Tense Conjugations.
Table 5-1 shows you the breakdown of subject pronouns in German and English. Notice
the format with singular on the left, plural on the right, and the pronoun Sie (you) at the
bottom. I use the same setup throughout the verb tables in this book.
Table 5-1

Think of the subject pronouns as persona because they impersonate the subject that
they represent. You characterize them by their grammatical person (based on who’s
speaking and listening), number (singular or plural), and sometimes formality (which
I discuss in the next section). Here’s a closer look at the three persons:
 First person: The one(s) speaking: ich (I) or wir (we).
 Second person: The one(s) spoken to: du, ihr, Sie. All three mean you in English;
du is the singular, familiar form, which you’d use with a friend; ihr is the plural,
familiar form, which you’d use with a group of friends; and Sie is the formal form,
whether singular or plural, which you’d use with the chancellor of Germany and
her cabinet ministers (and everyone else you’re not on a first-name basis with).
 Third person: Who or what is spoken about: er (he, it), sie (she, it), or es (it); sie
(they). If you’re talking about an inanimate object (it), the choice among er, sie,
and es depends on the gender of the noun — see Chapter 2 for details.
Making sure “you” dresses for the occasion:
The formality of du/ihr and Sie
Hopefully, if you’re hobnobbing with some business moguls, the mayor, and a throng
of socialites at the charity benefit of the year, you’re on your best behavior. On the
other hand, most people do and say whatever they feel like while hanging out with
70
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

their buddies at a backyard barbecue on a Saturday afternoon. That
formality/informality factor is what you need to keep in mind when you address
people in German because there are three ways to say you: du, ihr, and Sie.
Use Sie, which is always capitalized, to speak to one or more people with whom you
have a more distant, formal relationship. It’s appropriate
 When you aren’t sure about whether du/ihr or Sie is correct
 When you’re not yet on a first-name basis with someone (for example, using
Herr Kuhnagel or Frau Zitzelsberger, not Sigmund or Hildegard)
 When you’re talking to adults you don’t know well
 In business or at your place of work
 In public situations to a person in uniform (police officer, airport official, and
other such individuals)
Use du when you talk to one person (or animal) in an informal way, and use ihr,
the plural version of du, to address more than one person (or animal) informally.
An informal pronoun is appropriate
 When a German speaker invites you to use du
 For talking to a close friend or relative
 For addressing children and teens younger than 16 or so
 When you talk to pets
You may hear du among close working colleagues, students, members of a sports
team, or people hiking in the mountains, but unless someone asks you, “Wollen wir
uns dutzen?” (Shall we say du to each other?), try to stick with Sie.
Using first names and addressing people with du (or ihr) when it isn’t appropriate
can turn German speakers off — fast. Language and culture are bonded together with
superglue, so avoid pasting your culture on the German-speaking world. Be careful
with recent crossover scenarios at the workplace: people addressing each other with
Sie, although they use first names: Heinz, haben Sie meine E-mail gelesen? (Heinz,
have you read my e-mail?). If you use last names (Frau Dinkelhuber and Herr
Sternhagel), using Sie is best.
Distinguishing among sie, sie, and Sie
I have a threesome tangle to help you unravel, and then you’re on your way to 
success with subject pronouns. Look back at Table 5-1, and you find the Three
Musketeers, sie (she), sie (they), and Sie (you), lurking in their separate boxes. 
Seeing them in what looks like random places may seem daunting, but a few clues 
can help you sort them out. First, you know the meanings by their context. The conju-
gated verb and capitalization also help reveal the meaning. Here’s what to watch:
 Conjugation: When sie means she, its verb form is distinct; in the present tense,
the conjugated verb usually ends in -t. When sie/Sie means they or you, the 
present-tense verb ends in -en. (For more on conjugation, see the next section.)
71
Chapter 5: Grasping the Present Tense

 Capitalization: The they and you forms of sie/Sie have identical conjugations,
but only the you version, which is formal, is capitalized.
The following examples show how you figure out which one to use when:
Wo wohnt sie? (Where does she live?) The verb is in third-person singular form.
Wo wohnen sie? (Where do they live?) The verb is in third-person plural form, and
sie isn’t capitalized.
Wo wohnen Sie? (Where do you live?) The verb is in second-person plural form
(which is identical to the third-person plural form), and Sie is capitalized.
When you’re speaking, listen carefully for cues in the context that help you distin-
guish between sentences like Wo wohnen sie? and wo wohnen Sie? If you’re still not
sure, just ask, “Meinen Sie mich?” (Do you mean me?). If you’re on a first-name basis
with the speaker, then you’re all set; no confusion here because if someone asks you
where you live, you hear the informal version: Wo wohnst du?
In the following situations, decide which subject pronoun you would use (ich, du, er,
sie, es, wir, ihr, sie, or Sie) and write it in the space provided. Refer to Table 5-1 on
subject pronouns.
Q. Someone talking about his father uses _________________.
A. er
1. Friends talking to each other use (plural form) _________________.
2. You’re talking about your friends, so you use _________________.
3. An adult meeting another adult for the first time uses _________________.
4. When you talk about yourself, you use _________________.
5. An adult talking to three children aged 8, 11, and 14 uses _________________.
6. You’re talking to an animal, so you use _________________.
7. A man talking about his wife uses _________________.
8. When you talk about your cousin and yourself, you use _________________.
9. You’re talking about your colleagues, so you use _________________.
10. A teenaged customer talking to a sales assistant uses _________________.

12. A military comrade talking to another comrade uses _________________.

Getting Your Verbs in Shape: 
Present-Tense Conjugations
I love to talk — about myself, family, friends, job, and what’s going on in my life. Talking
(and writing) about all these things and more in German is usually a matter of knowing
how to construct a verb in the present tense with the help of a noun (subject) and a few
other elements. Most German verbs are regular, meaning they follow a standard pattern
of conjugation. Think of conjugation as activating a verb from its sleepy infinitive form
found in dusty dictionaries (leben, lachen, lieben) and its English equivalent with that
pesky to (to live, to laugh, to love) into a form that’s compatible with the subject.
This section shows how to put verbs through their paces by conjugating them and
combining them with nouns, pronouns, and other grammar goodies so you can start
talking and writing with confidence in German.
Agreeing with the regulars
Regular verbs don’t have any change in their basic form, which I call the stem. You
conjugate a verb by taking the stem — which is almost always the result of lobbing 
off -en from the infinitive form of the verb (the not-yet conjugated form) — and
adding the right ending to the verb. In the present tense, English has only the ending 
-s or no ending at all (I live, you live, he lives), whereas German has four endings (-e, 
-st, -t, and -en).
To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, just drop the -en from the infinitive
and add the appropriate ending to the stem. The endings are -e, -st, -t, -en, -t, -en, and
-en. The following verb table shows how to conjugate the verb kommen (to come).
I’ve simply added the present-tense endings, marked in bold, onto the stem komm-.
(Make sure you know the meanings of the subject pronouns by checking Table 5-1
earlier in this chapter.)
kommen (to come)
ich komme
wir kommen
du kommst
ihr kommt
er/sie/es kommt
sie kommen
Sie kommen
Er kommt aus Irland. (He comes from Ireland.)
If the verb stem ends in -d or -t, place an e in front of the verb endings -st and -t. The
following table shows how you conjugate the regular verb like arbeiten (to work) in
the present tense. The endings are marked in bold. The stem arbeit- ends in -t, so you
add an e before the verb endings for the second- and third-person singular (du
arbeitest, er/sie/es arbeitet) and the second-person plural familiar form (ihr
arbeitet).
73
Chapter 5: Grasping the Present Tense

arbeiten (to work)
ich arbeite
wir arbeiten
du arbeitest
ihr arbeitet
er/sie/es arbeitet
sie arbeiten
Sie arbeiten
Du arbeitest sehr schnell. (You work very fast.)
Both English and German sometimes insert extra vowels to make a verb understand-
able. Just try saying she teachs as one syllable — it’s not easy. English adds an e
before the -s so teaches expands to two syllables; the listener can then recognize that
the speaker is using the third-person singular. German adds -est and -et to du arbeit-
and er/sie/es arbeit- for the same reason: pronunciation. Adding the e lets speakers
pronounce arbeitet with three syllables.
With a few verbs that don’t have an -en infinitive ending, notably wandern (to hike)
and tun (to do), drop -n from the infinitive and add only -n to
 The first-person plural form: wir wandern (we hike) and wir tun (we do)
 The third-person plural form: sie wandern (they hike) and sie tun (they do)
 The formal second-person singular and plural form: Sie wandern (you hike) and
Sie tun (you do)
The following lists other common regular German verbs. You can use the regular con-
jugation on all of them:
 arbeiten (to work)
 kosten (to cost)
 bringen (to bring)
 lernen (to learn)
 finden (to find, have an opinion)
 reisen (to travel)
 gehen (to go, walk)
 sagen (to say)
 heißen (to be called, named)
 schreiben (to write)
 kaufen (to buy)
 spielen (to play [a game, cards])
 kennen (to know [a person])
 wandern (to hike, wander)
 kommen (to come)
 wohnen (to live)
In the following exercise, decide which verb conjugation to insert in the space pro-
vided. The English verb is at the end of the phrase, and the personal pronoun provides
the clue for the German ending. If you don’t see the personal pronoun, think which one
would replace the noun(s) or name(s) that you do see and conjugate as you would for
that pronoun.
Q. Was _________________ ihr? (to play)
A. Was spielt ihr? (What are you playing?)
74
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

13. Sabina und Moritz _________________ nach Australien. (to travel)
14. Der Computer _________________ 599€. (to cost)
15. Meine Großmutter und ich _________________ beide Monika. (to be named, called)
16. _________________ du oft Briefe? (to write)
17. Ich _________________ sehr gern in den Bergen. (to hike)
18. Wo _________________ Sie? (to live)
19. Manfred _________________ heute Abend spät nach Hause. (to come)
20. _________________ ihr den Mann da drüben? (to know)
21. Ja, mein Mann _________________ mit ihm in derselben Firma. (to work)
22. Wohin _________________ Sie? (to go)
23. Heute _________________ Florian und Maria ein Auto. (to buy)
24. Ich _________________ Deutsch sehr leicht zu lernen. (to find, have the opinion)
Conjugating verbs with spelling changes
The verbs in this section are more or less regular, but their stems undergo a few small
changes in spelling. Luckily — or unluckily, depending on how you see it — many of
the spelling-change verbs are frequently used, so perhaps you can acquire them by
osmosis! You may notice that some of the verbs here are cognates, words that come
from a common ancestor and are often similar in meaning and spelling. For instance,
fallen and to fall are the same, taking into account the German infinitive ending -en,
and helfen and to help closely resemble each other (check out Chapter 4 for more
about cognates).
These verbs with spelling changes are technically classified as verbs with stem-vowel
changes because — you guessed it — the vowel(s) in the stem changes when you
conjugate the verb. The stem is the part of the infinitive left after you slice off the -en
ending: Sprechen (to speak) is the infinitive, and sprech- is the stem.
The stem-vowel changes take place in the du and er/sie/es forms (and in one verb
type, the ich form). When dealing with these types of verbs, you encounter the follow-
ing changes:
 a→ä; au→äu (very small group including laufen [to run])
 e→i
 e→ie
 e→i (nehmen); also, consonant change hm to mm (see the nehmen verb table)
 i→ei (wissen); also, ich and er/sie/es forms have no endings (see the wissen
verb table)
75
Chapter 5: Grasping the Present Tense

The next five tables show each of these stem-vowel changes, along with the addi-
tional changes in nehmen (to take) and wissen (to know as a fact) groups. In these
tables, only the stem-vowel changing verb forms are in bold.
fahren (to drive): a→ä 
ich fahre
wir fahren
du fährst
ihr fahrt
er/sie/es fährt
sie fahren
Sie fahren
Du fährst sehr vorsichtig. (You drive very carefully.)
Other a→ä verbs include the following:
 backen (to bake)
 laufen (to run)
 fallen (to fall)
 schlafen (to sleep)
 gefallen (to like, enjoy)
 tragen (to carry, wear)
 halten (to stop, think about)
 waschen (to wash)
sprechen (to speak): e→i
ich spreche
wir sprechen
du sprichst
ihr sprecht
er/sie/es spricht
sie sprechen
Sie sprechen
Adrienne spricht fließend Englisch, Deutsch, und Französisch. 
(Adrienne speaks fluent English, German, and French.)
Here are some other e→i verbs:
 essen (to eat)
 geben (to give)
 helfen (to help)
 vergessen (to forget)
lesen (to read): e→ie 
ich lese
wir lesen
du liest
ihr lest
er/sie/es liest
sie lesen
Sie lesen
Das Kind liest schon Romane. (The child already reads novels.)
76
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Sehen (to see) is also an e→ie verb.
nehmen (to take): e→i, hm→mm
ich nehme
wir nehmen
du nimmst
ihr nehmt
er/sie/es nimmt
sie nehmen
Sie nehmen
Du nimmst zu viele Kekse! (You’re taking too many cookies!)
wissen (to know as a fact): i→ei
ich weiß
wir wissen
du weißt
ihr wisst
er/sie/es weiß
sie wissen
Sie wissen
Weißt du, wer das ist? (Do you know who that is?)
When you use wissen to refer to information in the sentence, you use a comma to
separate the two sentence parts.
Try your hand at mastering the fine art of stem-vowel changes: In the following exer-
cise, decide which verb conjugation to insert in the space provided. Remember, the
stem-vowel changes take place in the du and er/sie/es (second-person singular 
familiar and third-person singular). You may have to make a few other changes, so
make sure you refer to the preceding tables.
Q. _________________ du eine Jacke zum Abendessen? (to wear)
A. Trägst du eine Jacke zum Abendessen? (Are you wearing a jacket to dinner?)

Chapter 5: Grasping the Present Tense

Conjugating the irregulars haben 
and sein: To have and to be
To have and to be: It sounds like a cross between a book title by an adventurous jour-
nalist turned author and a famous quote in English literature or a remake of a movie
from the ’40s. Whatever comes to mind when you think of these two verbs, haben
(to have) and sein (to be) are stars in their own right.
These two common verbs are irregular. Just as in English, you come across them as
full-fledged, free-standing, autonomous verbs and as auxiliary (helping) verbs. (For
more on auxiliary verbs, see Chapter 9.) The auxiliary verb function of haben and
sein is to work with other verbs in a frequently used verb tense: the present perfect,
which I discuss in Chapter 16. For now, I simply show you what haben and sein look
like in the present tense and explain how the English and German uses of these verbs
compare.
Haben: Let me have it
Look at the conjugation of haben in the present tense. Notice that the verb actually
has only two irregular verb forms: du hast and er/sie/es hat. The rest follow the regu-
lar verb conjugation pattern of taking the stem (in this case hab-) and adding the
usual ending.
haben (to have)
ich habe
wir haben
du hast
ihr habt
er/sie/es hat
sie haben
Sie haben
Sie hat eine grosse Familie. (She has a large family.)
German, like English, has many expressions that involve the verb to have. Many of them
are the same in German and in English: Zeit haben (to have time). Others aren’t — for
example, English has two ways to express that something is absolutely necessary, must
and have to. German has only one, müssen (must): Ich muß anfangen (I have to start).
In other cases, German uses the verb haben when English has a different construction:
 Expressing likes with haben and the adverb gern: Gern means gladly, with
pleasure when you use it alone. When expressing likes, gern is usually placed at
the end of the sentence: Hast du klassische Musik gern? (Do you like classical
music?). You find more on this expression in Chapter 11.
 Talking about your birthday: You say Ich habe am achten Oktober Geburtstag
(My birthday is on the eighth of October).
 With expressions that describe a physical condition, an emotional condition,
or a state of being: Five common expressions are
• Angst haben (to be afraid)
• Durst haben (to be thirsty)
• Glück haben (to be lucky, fortunate)
78
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

• Hunger haben (to be hungry)
• Recht haben (to be right)
Try these exercises using the verb haben. First, write the sentence in German. You
have the elements you need to form the sentence (or question) separated by a slash
(/). Combine the parts, making sure you use the right conjugated form of haben.
Second, try to write the same sentence in English. If you find this task difficult, look
at the Answer Key at the end of this chapter.

__________________________________________________________________________________
36. Ihr / haben / viele CDs. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
Sein: To be or not to be
Look at the conjugation of sein (to be) in the present tense. Notice that all the verb
forms are irregular, although wir sind, sie sind, and Sie sind are identical. Regular
verb conjugations in the present tense also have the same endings for wir, sie, and
Sie pronouns. For comparison, consider the regular verb gehen (to go, walk): wir
gehen, sie gehen, and Sie gehen.
sein (to be)
ich bin
wir sind
du bist
ihr seid
er/sie/es ist
sie sind
Sie sind
Sind Sie Herr Schumpich? (Are you Mr. Schumpich?)
79
Chapter 5: Grasping the Present Tense

The verb sein is a true workhorse in German. Not only does it tell you what is and
what isn’t, but you also use it to form the present perfect — although haben is the
main auxiliary verb for that task. (For more information on the present perfect tense,
see Chapter 16.)
German and English use the verb sein (to be) in similar ways (What’s your boss like? Is
it time yet? Who’s that? Is it quiet? Are you ready? No, we’re not. Am I too old? How much
is that? What’s up? Where are we? Isn’t she funny? Where are you? I’m lost.). Here’s how
you can use sein:
 With an adjective: This way is the most common:
Du bist sehr lustig. (You’re very funny.)
Mein Sohn ist nicht musikalisch. (My son is not musical.)
Some expressions in German use the verb sein with an adjective plus a noun or
pronoun in the dative case. (For more information on cases, refer to Chapter 4.)
A couple of common expressions are
Mir ist kalt/warm. (I’m cold/warm.) Mir is the dative case of the
pronoun ich.
Ihm ist schlecht/übel. (He’s feeling sick/sick to his stomach.) Ihm is the
dative case of the pronoun er.
 With an adverb:
Wir sind morgen nicht hier. (We’re not here tomorrow.)
Sie ist dort. (She’s there.)
 With nouns:
Sind Sie Kanadier? (Are you a Canadian?)
Ich bin Bauingenieur. (I’m a civil engineer.)
Note that German leaves out the article ein (a) for professions. (See Chapter 4
for more information.)
A few expressions using sein are expressed slightly differently from their English
equivalents:
 Wie ist ihre Telefonnummer/Adresse? (What’s your phone number/address?
Literally, wie means how.) Chapter 7 deals with questions.
 Hier ist Frau Becker. (I’m Mrs. Becker. — to identify yourself on the telephone)
 Ihr seid hier richtig. (You’re in the right place.)
Try these exercises using the verb sein. First, write the sentence in German. You have
the elements needed to form the sentence (or question) separated by a slash (/).
Combine the parts, making sure you use the right conjugated form of sein. Then try
to write the same sentence in English. Remember that in some situations, the present
tense in German is used for continuous and future tenses, as well as actions that
started in the past in English.

Using the Very Versatile Present Tense
When you want to gain confidence speaking and writing in any language, you work on
polishing your verb skills so you feel competent using the present, the past, and the
future tenses. In German, grasping the present tense opens the door to several ways
of expressing yourself. Knowing how versatile the present tense is in German means
that you economize with this handy verb tense.
When you want to talk about something in German, first figure out whether you can
use the present tense. In virtually all the situations where you use the present in
English, you also use the present in German. In addition, you have a lot of opportuni-
ties in German to use the present tense when you have to use other verb tenses in
English. It certainly makes your life easier when you know these various situations!
The primary difference in usage is that English has a continuous verb form and German
doesn’t. English uses the present continuous (Our guests are staying until Sunday) to
indicate that an action is happening now, and it uses the present tense for habitual
actions or facts without expressing whether the action is going on at the time (My
brother lives on a lake). Because German doesn’t verbally express such time distinc-
tions, the listener can interpret sentences such as Was denkst du? in two ways: What
are you thinking?/What’s on your mind? or What do you think?/What’s your opinion?
Look at Table 5-2 for three ways to translate one German sentence into English.

Hold on — there’s more to come on the versatility of the simple present tense in

sions made at the time of speaking, and for activities that started in the past and are
still going on. Table 5-3 shows how German uses the present tense for talking about
the future and the past.

A
sking questions puts you in the conversational driver’s seat. You use questions
to initiate dialogues, find out what you need to know, and clarify information
you’re not sure about. When you’re studying a new language, you may find that your
counterpart is speaking so fast that you can barely understand the first word, let
alone the barrage that follows. So you ask the person to slow down: Langsamer, bitte
(Slower, please). This isn’t bad for a start, but you still don’t know what the person
just said. You feel like asking where the stop button (or at least the rewind button) is,
but instead you ask, Können Sie das bitte wiederholen? (Could you repeat that,
please?). But you’re still in the back seat, and your goal is to get behind the wheel.
How you achieve that is simple: You implement effective question techniques.
This chapter gets you up to speed on formulating questions. At the end of each sec-
tion, you can go for a test drive (not exactly racing on the Nürburgring, leider [unfor-
tunately]) and see how skillful you are at making questions. (Refer to Chapter 7 for
detailed practice in answering questions.) Verstehen Sie, was ich meine? (Do you
understand what I mean?)
In addition to questions, you also need to know how to tell someone to do something.
You use the imperative form for giving commands, giving instruction, persuading
people, and offering encouragement. This chapter also gives you tools for under-
standing and using the imperative. Read on.
Inverting Word Order for Yes/No Questions
German word order is easy to follow when you form a question that merits a yes or no
answer. You simply flip the subject and the conjugated (main) verb: The verb is in first
place, and the subject is in second place (where the verb usually goes in statements).
English is more complicated because you usually use the auxiliary (helping) verb to do
or to be together with the main verb; in English, only the auxiliary verb goes in first
place. Take a look at the German and its translations:

Leben Sie in einer Großstadt? (Do you live in a large city?)
Bleibt sie hier? (Is she staying here?)
Ist es kalt bei Ihnen im Winter? (Is it cold where you live in the winter?)
The German present tense encompasses two English verb tenses (and more). The pres-
ent continuous doesn’t exist in German, so in the second question here, you use the
present. (See Chapter 5 for more on the present tense.) The inverted word order in
German is the same for both the present tense and present-continuous tense in English.
Am Bahnhof (at the train station): Imagine you’re in München (Munich), and you’re
planning an Ausflug (outing, excursion) to Berlin. You decide to take the train, so you
go the window marked Reiseauskunft (travel information). In this exercise, you see a
list of questions followed by a dialogue. Write the questions in the correct spaces pro-
vided. Read everything before you start to fill in the questions so you get the gist of
the conversation.

Gathering Information with Question 
Words: Who, What, Why, and More
When kids reach the age of asking why, it’s marvelous at first, but after weeks of non-
stop questioning, you may wonder whether they’re practicing for a career in some gov-
ernment spy agency. Asking why is a kid’s way of engaging an adult in conversation just
as much as it is a way of gathering information. As you progress in German, you need
question words (interrogative pronouns) such as who, what, where, and when to gather
specific information, but you can also use the kid’s tactic of asking wer (who), was
(what), warum (why), and so on as a tool for engaging people in conversation. Doing so
is a useful tactic because it gives you more control over the direction of the discussion.
The inverted word order for yes/no questions (see the preceding section) is the same
for information-gathering questions, only the question word (or phrase) comes first.
Thus, the word order for info-gathering questions is question word + verb + subject,
such as Warum ist der Himmel blau? (Why is the sky blue?) or Wann fahren wir
nach Hause? (When are we driving home?).
Table 6-1 lists 12 German question words and phrases, the English equivalent in
alphabetical order, and an example question in English with its German equivalent.

Welcher/welche/welches (which) is an interrogative pronoun with three versions to
correspond with the three noun genders der/die/das: welcher Computer (which com-
puter), welche Frau (which woman), welches Auto (which car). You need to remember
that it has adjective endings — in other words, the case endings of the noun it’s
describing. For example, consider Mit welchem Bus soll ich fahren? (Which bus
should I take? Literally: With which bus should I drive/travel?). The preposition mit uses
the dative case, and der Bus is masculine, so mit welchem Bus uses the masculine
dative singular form of welch- in the prepositional phrase. 
Wer (who) is an interrogative pronoun that has three other forms. Wer is the nomina-
tive case, wen (whom, who) is accusative, wem (who) is dative, and wessen (whose)
is genitive.

Chapter 6: Are You Asking or Telling Me? Questions and Commands

Checking Information: Tag! 
You’re It, Aren’t You?
When you’re talking to someone and you want to check some information, you may
say something like this, expecting the listener to agree with you: The mall opens at 10,
doesn’t it? The same tactic is handy when you’re not sure whether the other person is
actually listening to you or is more engrossed in the game on TV.
As you delve into the depths of the German language, you can easily wonder at how
much more complicated German grammar seems than English grammar. Then you stum-
ble upon the realm of tag questions, and you can giggle at how simple it is to play tag in
German. A tag question is simply what you tack onto the end of a statement to make it
into a question. In English, the tag depends on the subject and verb in the statement.
The possibilities are practically endless in English: isn’t she?, do you?, can’t you?, wasn’t
it?, were you?, wouldn’t it?, are you?, and so on. The German equivalent is far simpler.
To form a tag question in German, just add nicht? (Literally: not?) or nicht wahr?
(Literally: not true?) to the end of the sentence. Both expressions serve the same func-
tion as the long list of tag question equivalents in English: to shake out a sign of agree-
ment, disagreement, or even just a grunt of acknowledgement from the listener. You can
use tag questions interchangeably. They aren’t grammatically linked to the first part of
the sentence, as they are in English, so any time you want to elicit a response from
someone as a means of checking your information, to show agreement or disagreement,
and so on, you can use nicht or nicht war, even if you’re talking about something in the
past, present, or future or something that is negative or positive.
Sie fahren morgen nach Düsseldorf, nicht wahr? (You’re going/driving to
Düsseldorf tomorrow, aren’t you?)
Der Film war nicht besonders gut, nicht? (The movie wasn’t especially good, was it?)
Other tags abound in colloquial German. One common tag is oder? (Literally: or?),
and another one you may hear in the southern German-speaking regions is gell?
(loosely translated as right?). Sticking with the two “official” tag elements is best, but
if you hear people around you using oder? or gell?, you may want to try them out as
well, keeping in mind that they’re colloquial and regional German. Both of these tags
are used the same way as nicht and nicht wahr — in other words, to check that you
understand some information, to elicit a response from someone, to show agreement
or disagreement, and so on.
If you’re using the Sie form, stick to the standard German tags, nicht and
nicht wahr.
In this exercise, you’re checking some information. Add on your choice of the four
German tags — nicht? nicht wahr? oder? gell? — to the end of the statement.
Q. Sie wohnen in Graz, _________________?
A. Sie wohnen in Graz, nicht wahr? (You live in Graz, don’t you?)
20. Der Mann da drüben heißt Herr Storch, _________________?
21. Wir haben noch eine Stunde Zeit, _________________?

Combining Question Words: 
Compounds with Wo-
You’re listening to the German businessman sitting next to you on the plane telling
you something like Ich bin gegen höhere Benzinpreise (I’m against higher gas
prices). You hear the first part of the statement, ich bin gegen, but you don’t catch
the rest — what’s he against? That one song about Benzin by Rammstein? You ask, Sie
sind gegen was? (You’re against what?). The businessman can understand your ques-
tion, but it sounds as though you’re challenging his opinion. It’s a bit like saying, Just
what is it that you claim you’re against?! and insinuating that you don’t agree at all.
How do you communicate that you don’t want to challenge his judgment, but you do
need a repeat of the statement? You ask, Wogegen sind Sie? (What are you against?).
The question Wogegen sind Sie literally means What against are you? Wogegen asks
for the object of the preposition gegen (against). In German, you stick wo- in front of
the preposition. The wo- signals to the listener that a question is coming up and that
it’s going to be about the object of the preposition. The listener gets the most impor-
tant information first in the question.
The German word order in questions beginning with wo- compounds like worüber
(what about, what over) may seem odd at first: Worüber spricht sie? (What’s she talk-
ing about? Literally: What over [about] is she talking?). However, compare it to a simi-
lar structure in really formal English: To whom am I speaking? instead of the far more
natural sounding, Who am I speaking to? Remember: Such word order may seem odd
in English, yet it’s standard fare in German. 
A second important function of the compound question words using wo- is to prompt
the listener that the question you’re asking allows an open-ended answer: Wofür sind
Sie? (What are you for?). The listener may answer like this: Ich bin für den Frieden (I’m
for peace) or Ich bin für einen Spaziergang im Park (I’m [up] for a walk in the park).
The meaning of the preposition in the compound with wo- may be different from the
original meaning. Remember that many German verbs require particular prepositions
in particular contexts (check out Chapter 15 for more on prepositions), which some-
times can determine which preposition you choose to combine with wo-, such as
Worauf warten Sie? (What are you waiting for?) or Ich warte auf den Bus (I’m waiting
for the bus). The person posing the question uses the phrase warten auf . . . in ques-
tion form. The reply contains the complete phrase (ich warte auf) with the object of
the preposition (den Bus).
When you know the most common verb-preposition combinations, you’re on the road
to success at forming wo- compounds. (Chapter 11 and Chapter 15 help you with such
combinations.) However, you also need to know which grammatical case to use with
prepositions. Most important is being aware that prepositions can change meaning
depending on the context of the sentence, so it’s wise to know fixed expressions.
91
Chapter 6: Are You Asking or Telling Me? Questions and Commands

Table 6-2 shows the most common compounds formed by adding wo- to the preposi-
tions. The English equivalents can help you to get a feel for the preposition, but they
change meaning according to the context of the sentence. When the preposition
begins with a vowel, the letter r is inserted between the two elements of the question
word (for instance, wo + r + in = worin).

Making Choices: Asking What Kind of . . . ?
You’re looking at a ticket machine for the public transportation system in a major
German city. You know the system is really extensive because on the wall next to the
machine is a huge subway/light rail map, the U-Bahn/S-Bahn Netzplan (U-Bahn is
short for Untergrundbahn [subway], and S-Bahn stands for Schnellbahn [commuter
rail/light rail]). The shiny blue and silver ticket machine is a real gem from a technical
standpoint, but it doesn’t look very user-friendly to Ausländer (foreigners) like you.
The machine must provide lots of ticket choices because there are all kinds of but-
tons to push and various slots for inserting money and taking out tickets; still, no one
seems to be having any trouble. You have two choices: Pretend you’re at a slot
machine in Las Vegas, press a few buttons, and hope you’ll get a ticket out of the deal,
or use the phrase was für (ein) and ask a likely victim, “Was für eine Karte brauche
ich?” (What kind of ticket do I need?) — or, pointing to the ticket in her hand, ask,
“Was für eine Karte ist das?” (What kind of a ticket is that?).
Obviously, I suggest you try the second option: To form this type of question, you use
the phrase was für (ein) with a noun as the subject (nominative case) or the direct
object (accusative case) of a question. I break down two questions to show you how
this works. First, Was für eine Karte ist das? (What kind of a ticket is that?). In this
question, you start as always with was für. Next, add the subject of the sentence,
eine Karte (a ticket), and then the verb ist (is) and das (that, indicating the ticket the
passenger is holding). The second question, Was für eine Karte brauche ich? (What
kind of ticket do I need?) starts the same way with was für, followed by eine Karte,
which is the object of the sentence. The verb brauche (need) follows, and then comes
the subject of the question, ich (I).
If you’re having trouble figuring out what a subject (nominative case) is and what 
a direct object (accusative case) is, turn the question into a normal, declarative 
sentence. To Was für eine Karte ist das? you may hear the answer Das ist eine
Streifenkarte (That’s a strip ticket). Eine Streifenkarte is nominative case; you use it
with the verb sein (to be). To answer Was für eine Karte brauche ich? you may hear
Sie brauchen eine Streifenkarte (You need a strip ticket). The subject is Sie, in nomi-
native case, and the object is eine Streifenkarte, in accusative case.
Table 6-3 shows the breakdown of the grammatical structure for asking was für ein . . .?
(what kind of . . .?) Notice the case and gender endings of the subject and object in each
question; remember that the preposition für in was für doesn’t determine the case;
rather, the other information in the question does so.

In the following exercise, you’re spending some time in Munich. You’re curious about
everything around you, so you ask a lot of questions. Write the questions in German
using the cues in English. Table 6-3 can help you decide the case and gender endings;
the noun and its gender are given in German in parentheses.
Q. What kind of ticket is the “Streifenkarte”? (German has two words for transport ticket: die
Fahrkarte and der Fahrschein. You also see the word das Ticket in German usage.)
A. Was für eine Fahrkarte/ein Fahrschein ist die “Streifenkarte”? (What kind of ticket is
the “Streifenkarte”?) Die Streifenkarte is a strip ticket, and it’s your best choice when you
want to take a few rides over a period of a couple of days. Nominative case here; the verb
sein (to be) uses nominative.

Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Using the Imperative: Do It!
When you want to give someone orders to do something, you can use the imperative
form, also called the command form. However, you can also use the imperative form
in other situations, such as giving instructions, offering encouragement, making sug-
gestions, and persuading people. This section gives the lowdown on the imperative.
Giving orders
When telling someone to do something, you use the imperative. You want to ensure you
use the correct verb form and punctuation so the person you’re talking to understands.
(However, that still doesn’t mean he or she will do what you say.) Keep reading to see
how to use the imperative correctly.
Verb forms
English has one verb form for the imperative (stop here please, get me a pen please, 
go home, watch out!). You may be talking to one person, several people, a bus driver, a
friend, or your neighbor’s dog. On the other hand, German has three forms, depending
on whom you’re addressing. They correspond to the three German pronouns that repre-
sent you — Sie, ihr, and du. Table 6-4 shows examples of these three imperative forms
and explains how to form the verbs. I mention the few exceptions right after the table.

Normally, the du imperative form is straightforward: verb stem + -e (for example,
geh + -e = gehe [go]). Here are the three du imperative exceptions:
 In informal German, the -e is often dropped: pass auf (watch out)
 In verbs with a stem ending in -d or -t, you often don’t drop the -e: arbeite (work)
 If the verb has a stem vowel change, the imperative has this vowel change and
does not have -e at the end of the verb: essen = iss (eat). (See Chapter 4 for verbs
with stem vowel changes.)
The verb sein (to be) is irregular (of course!) in the imperative:
 Sie form: seien Sie
 ihr form: seid
 du form: sei
95
Chapter 6: Are You Asking or Telling Me? Questions and Commands

Punctuation
When you write a command in German, put an exclamation mark at the end of the
phrase. It isn’t intended to make the command sound like a do-or-die situation; it’s
simply a grammatical element of the imperative form, just as a question mark belongs
at the end of a question.
The liberal use of exclamation marks on German signage as a means of signaling warn-
ing can be a bit overwhelming at first. Rasen nicht betreten! (Don’t walk on the grass)
may seem threatening, but don’t let it give you the impression that you’ll go straight to
jail if you dare to place even one toe on the grass. The exclamation mark is meant to
draw your attention to the sign so you recognize it as a directive that you need to
adhere to. Grammatically speaking, the format of Rasen nicht betreten! is an impera-
tive, but it’s the infinitive form of the verb that you see more often on signs, and it often
takes the form of a prohibition with nicht preceding the infinitive. Nicht hinauslehnen!
(Don’t lean out!) is an example of a sign posted on a train window. The exclamation
mark adds strength to the message.
Requests and suggestions: Looking 
at question-command hybrids
In some cases, the imperative walks the fine line between asking and telling someone
to do something. Both have inverted word order with the verb first, followed by the
subject. Look at the question Können Sie das bitte machen? (Could you do that,
please?). You’re asking someone to do something, so you generally formulate your
request more politely using a helping verb such as können (could). In addition, you
end the request in a rising voice, and you use a question mark. By contrast, when you
want to tell someone to do something in more direct but polite language, you make a
request such as Machen Sie das, bitte (Please do that). Your voice falls at the end, and
you use a period.
Können Sie mir bitte helfen? (Could you help me, please?) The question form,
können, and bitte indicate a request that you’re asking someone (politely) to do
something. When you say it, your voice rises at the end.
Helfen Sie mir, bitte. (Please help me/Give me a hand, please.) The imperative
form is a request in more direct language, but bitte makes it sound polite. This is
probably something you’d say, not write. 
Another use of the imperative is for making suggestions. When referring to wir (we)
as the people who may follow the suggestion, the German looks like this: Fahren wir
Fahrrad (Let’s go bicycling). It’s the wir verb form with inverted word order.
For each infinitive, provide the imperative verb forms for Sie, ihr, and du. Use all the
preceding information to help you form the three different imperative forms. Because
these are commands, they all need the exclamation mark.

R: Sehr freundlich, vielen Dank für Ihre Auskunft. (That’s very kind of you. Thank you for your
information.)
j
A: Interface Sprachenschule, guten Morgen! (Interface Language School. Good morning.)
J: Guten Morgen, Julian Stromberger von der Firma Nordstern. (Good morning. This is Julian
Stromberger from Nordstern Company.) Note: In German business situations, and even with pri-
vate telephone calls, people answer the phone and identify themselves with their last name,
but there is a trend to give the whole name.
A: Kann ich Ihnen helfen? (Can I help you?)
J: Ja, wir möchten einen Sprachkurs für Spanisch machen. (Yes.We’d like to do a Spanish
language course.)
A: Kein Problem, sehr gerne. (No problem. That’s fine.)
J: Wie viel kostet so ein Sprachkurs? (How much does such a language course cost?)

k
A: Wie viele Personen machen den Kurs? (How many people are taking the course?)
J: Wir sind vier Personen. (There are four of us. Literally: We are four people.)
A: Dann kostet der Kurs 500€ pro Person. (Then it costs 500€ per person.)
l
J: Wie viele Stunden sind es? (How many hours is it?)
A: Es sind 40 Stunden. (It’s 40 hours.)
m
J: Warum ist es so teuer? (Why is it so expensive?)
A: Weil es nur vier Personen sind. (Because there are only four people.) The conjunction weil
requires that the verb be placed at the end of the phrase.
n
J: Wo ist der Unterricht? (Where is the class?)
A: Der Unterricht kann in Ihrer Firma sein. (The class can take place in your company.)
J: Oh, in Ordnung, einverstanden. (Oh, all right. That’s agreed.) Another alternative translation
for einverstanden is very well.
o
A: Wohin soll die Lehrerin fahren? (Where should the teacher go?)
J: Sie muß nach Starnberg fahren. (She’ll need to go to Starnberg.) Müssen means must, but it
carries a stronger connotation in English than in German.
A: Einverstanden. (Very well.) Another alternative translation for einverstanden is agreed or
that’s agreed.
p
J: Wer macht den Unterricht? (Who is teaching the class?)
A: Eine junge Lehrerin. (A young teacher.)
q
J: Wie heißt die Lehrerin? (What is the teacher’s name?) The fixed expression you use to ask
someone’s name, wie heißen Sie? literally means how are you called?
A: Sie heißt Cristina. (Her name is Cristina.)
r
J: Woher kommt sie? (Where is she from?)
A: Sie kommt aus Santiago de Chile. (She’s from Santiago de Chile.)
s
J: Wann können wir anfangen? (When can we begin?)
A: Sie können nächste Woche am Montag anfangen. (You can start on Monday next week.)
J: Ah, gut, vielen Dank. Auf Wiederhören. (Oh, great, thank you very much. Goodbye.) In tele-
phone language, you say, literally speaking, hear you later.
A: Danke für Ihren Anruf. Auf Wiederhören. (Thank you for you call. Goodbye.)
t
Der Mann da drüben heißt Herr Storch, nicht? (The man over there is Herr Storch, isn’t he?) This
sounds like a business situation, or at least formal situation, because the man is described with
his last name, so definitely you should use the “official” tags.
u
Wir haben noch eine Stunde Zeit, nicht wahr? (We have another hour, don’t we?) If you’re talk-
ing with a good friend, you can use gell or oder.
v
Hier regnet es oft im Frühling, nicht wahr? (It often rains here, doesn’t it?) If you’re talking with a
good friend, you can use gell or oder.

w
Sie sind morgen im Büro, nicht? (You’ll be in the office tomorrow, won’t you?) Stick to the
nicht/nicht wahr — it’s a formal situation.
x
Sie hat uns alle wichtigen Informationen gegeben, nicht wahr? (She gave us all the important
information, didn’t she?) If you’re talking with a good friend, you can use gell or oder.
y
Worauf wartest du? (What are you waiting for?) Ich warte auf meine Freundin. (I’m waiting for
my [girl] friend.) The fixed expression is auf etwas warten. The preposition auf takes the
accusative.
A
Wofür ist er? (What is he for?) Er ist für mehr Freiheit. (He’s for more freedom.) The opposite
of für is gegen (against): Er ist gegen die Freiheit. (He’s against freedom.)
B
Worum bitten Sie? (What are you asking for?) Ich bitte um einen Stift. (I’m asking for a pencil.)
Um etwas bitten is the fixed expression. Um takes the accusative.
C
Wodurch werden Sie krank? (What can you get sick from?) Durch schlechten Fisch werde ich
krank. (I get sick from bad fish.) The preposition durch changes meaning when used in the
expression, but its original meaning through helps you to get the gist of the expression durch
etwas krank werden.
D
Woran halten Sie sich? (What do you adhere to/observe?) Ich halte mich an die Gesetze.
(I adhere to/observe the laws.) The literal translation of sich an etwas halten (to hold
oneself to) makes enough sense to help you understand the question.
E
Was für ein Museum ist das? Nominative case here; the verb sein (to be) uses the nominative.
F
Was für einen Salat essen Sie? Accusative case here; einen Salat is the direct object, and the
subject is Sie.
G
Was für ein Getränk ist das? Nominative case here; the verb sein (to be) uses the nominative.
The plural of Getränk is Getränke.
H
Was für ein Geschäft ist das? Nominative case here; the verb sein (to be) uses the nominative.
I
Was für eine Musik hat dieses Lokal/diese Bar? Accusative case here; eine Musik is the direct
object. Lokal/Bar is the subject. Das Lokal is a popular word to describe an eatery that tends
to have a more casual atmosphere — and music — than ein Restaurant.

Chapter 7
Answering Intelligently with Yes, 
No, and Maybe
In This Chapter
 Responding with yes or no
 Understanding kein and nicht
 Getting into da- compounds
 Being diplomatic: Agreeing and disagreeing
You’re listening as your aunt talks on the phone in the room next to you, and you
know the conversation can’t be very interesting, because all you hear is yes, yes,
no, yeah, yes, yeah, no, no, yes. Your aunt is probably employing most of those yeses
and nos for more than answering a question; she’s likely signaling that she’s still lis-
tening or is simply being polite. If she were in the same room as the person she’s talk-
ing to, she likely wouldn’t even need to talk — it’d suffice for her to bob her head
around, nodding in agreement or shaking it to express disagreement.
You have to agree that knowing how to say yes and no in German is essential, but one-
word answers to questions can be as off-putting as the wrong answer. You certainly
need to use ja (yes) and nein (no) in many different situations when answering ques-
tions, responding to information, or agreeing and disagreeing with others. Yet even
with an answer that’s a complete sentence, you can get in trouble if you don’t express
it clearly enough. The humor in yes, we have no bananas isn’t an issue of poor gram-
mar but rather the confusion of yes and no in one sentence. In this chapter, I present
various ways to clearly express yes and no and the shades in between for situations
when you don’t want to commit yourself to a definite answer because you’d rather
bide your time, or vielleicht (maybe) you’d like to suggest an alternative.
Knowing a range of positive and negative responses to show agreement and disagree-
ment is another section in this chapter. I also take you through the steps you need to
know in order to choose between kein and nicht, which are the two ways of negating
information in German. This chapter also describes the ins and outs of da- 
compounds: how to form them and when and how you use the range of these handy
prepositional combinations. (Chapter 6 deals with the kissing cousins of da- 
compounds, the wo- compounds, which are used in questions.)

Getting to Yes: Variations on Ja
When you want to show someone that you understand, that you’re listening, and so
on, you use ja (yes) and its extended family: Ja, das ist richtig (Yes, that’s right). In
these instances, all you need to do is add ja to what you want to say. Use ja the way
you do in English: To answer a question in the affirmative, or to say that you agree to
something. It can stand alone, or if ja is in a sentence, it generally comes at the begin-
ning of an affirmative sentence, just as it does in English.
When you get bored with saying ja all the time, try a few variations that render the
same meaning with slightly different emphasis. Table 7-1 contains nine alternatives
for good old ja. The example sentences put these common substitutes into a context,
and the English explanations describe the implications behind these expressions.

Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Notice in the example sentences, when the ja substitute is followed by a comma or a
period, you start the next phrase in the usual German word order of subject followed
by the verb in second position. (In the example sentences, the comma and period are
interchangeable.) When the ja replacement word functions as the first element in the
sentence (no comma or period), the verb follows in second position.
When you want to add more emphasis to show that you really understand or agree
with someone, you can add ja or aber (but) to the preceding expressions. Take a look:
Ja, klar! (Yes, of course!)
Aber natürlich! (Certainly!)
Aber selbstverständlich! (Why, certainly!)
Ja, sicher! (Yes, sure!)
The preceding examples place the ja words at the beginning of the sentence.
However, when you want to express understanding or agreement within a sentence,
you can construct sentences that use these words in more or less fixed expressions
like genau richtig or es ist (mir) klar. In addition, genau, gewiss, klar, natürlich,
richtig, selbstverständlich, and sicher can work as adjectives or in some cases as
adverbs, and they have similar meanings. (See Chapter 12 for more on adjectives.)
Das wird selbstverständlich gemacht. (That will certainly be done.)
Es ist mir klar, daß ich abnehmen soll. (I realize that I should lose weight.
Literally: It’s clear to me that I should lose weight.)
Die Straßen waren gewiss sehr gefährlich nach dem Sturm. (The streets were
certainly very dangerous after the storm.)
Sie haben es genau richtig geraten. (You guessed it exactly right.)
In the following exercise, insert one of the alternatives for ja in each space provided.
In all cases, several solutions are possible. (Hint: The choices have something to do
with comma and period usage.) Use Table 7-1 to decide which words to use.
Q. _________________ können wir zu Fuß zum Bahnhof gehen.
A. Klar können wir zu Fuß zum Bahnhof gehen. (Of course we can walk to the train station.)
Other alternatives are natürlich, selbstvertändlich, and sicher because these expres-
sions don’t need to be separated by a comma or a period, which means that the next
word is the verb.
1. _________________, ich komme morgen.
2. _________________ können wir mit dem Zug nach Köln fahren.
3. _________________, das ist in Ordnung.
4. _________________ geht die ganze Familie in Urlaub.
5. _________________, wir fliegen am Dienstag nach Genf.

Responding with No: The Difference 
between Kein and Nicht
Saying no in German is plain and simple: nein. However, when you want to negate an
action, or an object or person, you have two ways to express not (or not any): kein
and nicht. Getting them straight is a matter of knowing what they negate in a sen-
tence. The word order of these negations is important to know, as is how to form the
endings of kein (nicht doesn’t change). In this section, I take you through the steps of
when and how to use nicht and kein.
Negating with nicht
The nuts and bolts of nicht are straightforward as far as its form is concerned. Nicht
is all you need to know (unlike kein, which has case and gender endings — see the
next section). Nicht generally negates a verb: nicht einladen (not to invite), nicht
fahren (not to drive, travel), nicht feiern (not to celebrate). It can also negate an adjec-
tive, as in nicht interessant (not interesting), or an adverb, as in nicht pünktlich (not
on time). What you do need to figure out is how to position nicht in a sentence.
Because nicht is an adverb, it negates the action of the verb or modifies an adjective
or an adverb, and it’s generally next to these parts of speech. For example:
Sie fliegen nicht nach London. (They’re not flying to London.) Nicht directly fol-
lows the verb in this sentence, negating the idea that they’re flying.
Martin spricht nicht gut Deutsch. (Martin doesn’t speak good German.) In this sen-
tence, nicht tells you that Martin’s ability to speak German is not good, so nicht
immediately follows the verb.
Gestern kamen wir nicht pünktlich zum Termin. (Yesterday we didn’t get to our
appointment on time.) Nicht links with the adverb pünktlich (on time), and you
place it before pünktlich.
Das Buch ist nicht interessant. (The book isn’t interesting.) The negation connects
the verb ist (is) and the adjective interessant (interesting); nicht modifies interes-
sant, so you place it in front of the adjective.
Placement is the more complex part of nicht, but most of the time, if you’re not per-
fect with word order, you’ll still be understandable in spoken or written German.
Table 7-2 explains some guidelines when using nicht, which should help you to sort
out where to put this valuable chess piece.

__________________________________
Negating with kein
Using kein (no, not, not any) is almost as easy as using nicht (see the preceding sec-
tion). Kein functions as an adjective; it describes nouns by expressing negation such
as keiner Polizist (no policeman), keine Jeans (no jeans), kein Brot (no bread), and
so on. However, before you can jump in and start adding kein into your sentences,
you need to know the gender and case of the noun you’re negating. Look at the fol-
lowing sentence: Keiner Polizist hat einen leichten Job (no policeman has an easy
job). Keiner Polizist is the subject of the sentence, so it’s in nominative case. Polizist
is masculine (der), so you add -er to kein = keiner Polizist. Keiner is the singular
masculine form of kein in nominative case. (See Chapter 2 for more on gender and
case.)
When you look at kein, you can see the indefinite article ein (a, an). Good news again
on the grammar front: The indefinite article ein and other very commonly used words
are often referred to as ein- words because they follow the same pattern in case and
gender endings. In the nominative case, ein and kein are the masculine and neuter
forms, and eine and keine are the feminine and plural forms.
You need to remember only one set of endings for the following words:
 ein (a, an), the indefinite article
 kein (no, not, not any), the adjective that negates a noun
 mein, dein, sein, ihr, unser, eurer, ihr, Ihr (my, your, his, her, our, your, their,
your), the possessive adjectives
106
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Table 7-3 shows how to remember the endings for kein, with the case and gender 
endings in bold. (Chapter 2 provides background information on case and gender.)
Masculine and neuter are grouped together, and feminine and plural are in one column.
This table is also valid for ein- words except for ein itself, which has no plural form.

Notice that masculine and neuter endings are almost all the same for kein and ein-
words; the accusative is the only one that differs. You can also remember feminine
and plural together, keeping in mind that the dative is the only one that isn’t the same
for the two genders. Look at the example sentences with kein in the four cases, fol-
lowed by the English equivalent and the grammar note explaining the gender:
 Nominative case: Keine Menschen leben auf der Insel. (No people live on the
island.) Menschen (plural) is the subject of the sentence, so keine Menschen is
nominative plural.
 Accusative case: Nach dem grossen Abendessen hatte ich keinen Hunger.
(I wasn’t hungry after the big dinner.) Literally, ich hatte keinen Hunger means 
I had no hunger. Der Hunger (masculine) changes to the accusative singular
keinen Hunger because it’s the object of the sentence.
 Dative case: In keinem alten Auto gibt es GPS. (There’s no GPS in any old car[s].)
Literally, in keinem alten Auto gibt es GPS means in no old car is there GPS. The
prepositional phrase in keinem alten Auto is in dative case; therefore, das Auto
becomes keinem (alten) Auto.
 Genitive case: Während keiner Nacht in der letzten Woche habe ich gut
geschlafen. (I didn’t sleep well [during] any night last week.) Literally, während
keiner Nacht in der letzten Woche habe ich gut geschlafen means during no
night in the past week did I sleep well. Während (during) is a genitive preposition,
and die Nacht is feminine singular. (Chapter 15 shows you details of preposi-
tions.) You need the genitive case ending -er for kein.
When you’re reading German, use the examples you see to understand the grammar
involved. Train yourself to take a step back and think carefully about which word end-
ings you’re dealing with in a sentence. The pieces of the grammar puzzle begin to fit
into place when you recognize which gender and case you’re looking at. 
The purpose of the next exercise is to put the correct ending on kein. You need to
know the gender of the noun, and when a preposition is involved, you need to know
which case the preposition takes. Here’s the situation: Daniel is writing a good rid-
dance letter to Susanne, who has run off with Jonas.

Chapter 7: Answering Intelligently with Yes, No, and Maybe

Avoiding blunt negative replies
You don’t want to sound overly negative when answering yes/no-type questions with
a straight nein. You can politely answer some questions negatively by adding a few
words to cushion the impact.
How can you avoid being blunt in polite conversation? You can make a positive
impression on German speakers when giving positive and even negative replies by
using idiomatic expressions — fixed phrases — that help you avoid sounding overly
negative. Keep a handful stored in the corner of your brain marked Deutscher
Wortschatz (German vocabulary). Literally speaking, Wortschatz means word 
treasures, which is a great way to regard vocabulary! Consider this exchange:
Haben Sie Kleingeld für 2€? (Do you have change for 2€?)
Nein, es tut mir leid. (No, I’m sorry. I don’t.)
In the response, you soften the blow of nein by adding the apology es tut mir leid
(I’m sorry). You can also give an excuse (hopefully a plausible one) such as nein, da
mein Portmonnaie zu Hause ist (No, because my wallet is at home).
Table 7-4 provides a sampling of expressions that help you avoid sounding too
strongly negative.

nicht nur (. . . sondern auch)
not only (. . . but also)
nicht nur (not only) can be linked
like this: Nicht nur mein Vater,
sondern auch mein Großvater
kam aus Irland. (Not only my
father but also my grandfather
came from Ireland.)
Ich habe nicht die leiseste 
I haven’t the faintest idea
This is a fixed expression that 
Ahnung
can also be stated like this: Ich
habe keine Ahnung (I have no
idea).
The following points show these expressions embedded in dialogue. For each exam-
ple, a question is followed by an answer with a softener that avoids the bluntness of
kein and nicht. The modifying words are set in bold:
 Können wir noch einen Kaffee trinken? (Can we have another cup of coffee?)
Es tut mir leid, aber wir haben fast keine Zeit. (I’m sorry, but we have hardly any
time.)
 Interessieren Sie sich für diese Musik? (Are you interested in this music?)
Ich habe praktisch kein Interesse für solche Musik. (I have practically no interest
in such music.)
 Können Sie in diesem Fall eine Ausnahme machen? (Can you make an exception
in this case?)
Im Grunde genommen, dürfen wir keine Ausnahmen machen. (Basically, we
can’t make any exceptions.)
Note: You can also use nicht with a verb: Im Grunde genommen, geht das nicht.
(Basically, that won’t work).

Explaining Answers Using Da- Compounds
You’re probably aware of German’s propensity for combining words or word frag-
ments into one humongous word that’s as long as its definition (if you’re not, check
out Chapter 4). Da- compounds are far simpler because they combine only two parts:
da- and a preposition. These compounds are handy for replacing the object of the
preposition; da- can be translated as it or that, and in the case of plural nouns, them.
You don’t need to repeat the prepositional phrase, making you sound intelligent as
well as fluent in German.
Use combinations of da- + preposition when you want to refer to the prepositional
phrase (mit meinem neuen Computer [with my new computer]) without repeating it —
for example, in a reply or to make reference to a prepositional phrase that someone
has already mentioned before — just as you say something like I like to work with it
(Ich arbeite gern damit) in English. Damit is a combination of da- + mit 
(literally it + with), and it can stand in for mit meinem neuen Computer.
Look at this example question with two different replies. Clearly, the second reply is
much less redundant than the first one, and you sound much more like you know
what you’re talking about — even though you say that you verstehe nichts davon
(understand nothing about it)!
 Verstehen Sie etwas von dieser Grammatik? (Do you know/understand anything
about this grammar?)
 Nein, ich verstehe nichts von dieser Grammatik. (No, I don’t know/understand
anything about this grammar.)
Nein, ich verstehe nichts davon. (No, I know/understand nothing about it.)
Notice how davon translates in the second reply: about it. You can also translate
davon as about that, though in Table 7-5, von has two translations, from and by. That’s
because the meaning of the preposition can change when it’s plunked into a preposi-
tional phrase or (especially) a verbal phrase that includes a preposition (a verbal
phrase is a more or less fixed expression that has a verb in it). The verbal phrase in
the example is etwas von etwas verstehen, which is what you’d see in a dictionary
entry under the headword verstehen, translated as to know sth about sth (sth is a 
standard abbreviation for something).
To form these compounds with da-, study Table 7-5 and then find the appropriate
compound for the practice exercise that follows. The table shows the most common
compounds formed by adding da- to the prepositions. The English equivalents help
you to get a feel for the preposition, but keep in mind that they can alter their mean-
ing according to the context of the sentence. When the preposition begins with a
110

vowel, the letter r is inserted between the two elements of the word (as in da + r +
über = darüber)

Sounding Diplomatic: Using Maybe,
Suggesting, and Refusing Politely
Ever feel like blurting out a resounding No! in the middle of a meeting when you
totally disagree with the proposal being discussed? Ever wanted to shake someone
who’s always negative into saying an unequivocal Yes to something you suggest? If so,
you likely used a bit more tact when you actually did speak up. Even if you haven’t
had such experiences, you do need to practice diplomacy in a great deal of situations,
and it’s even more crucial to know how to couch your agreement or disagreement in
diplomatic words when you speak another language. Although German may —
acoustically speaking — sound direct and even harsh at times, you can sound more
diplomatic and polite simply by adding a few measures of maybes and wells to replies
that may otherwise sound too blunt.
Add words such as vielleicht (maybe) or nun (well) where you would in English,
namely at the beginning of the idea that you intend to disagree with or answer with a
negative reply. Longer expressions are generally at the beginning of the sentence you’re
expressiong doubts about; these need to be memorized as fixed expressions.

Es kann sein, dass der Bericht einige Fehler hat. (It could be that the report has
some mistakes.) The expression es kann sein is a fixed expression connected to
the rest of the sentence by the conjunction dass. (For more on conjunctions, see
Chapter 14.)
Um ehrlich zu sein, das wäre schwierig. (To be honest, that would be difficult.) The
expression um ehrlich zu sein is a fixed expression. Following it is the informa-
tion that you’re being honest about.
North Americans — and possibly even more so, the British — enjoy a great reputa-
tion for using a broad range of polite language when expressing indecision, agree-
ment, and disagreement with others. The German language isn’t quite as famous for
sounding reserved. Why? The language itself has a stronger ring to the ears than
English because of the Tonfall (inflection or tone) and the fact that it bunches more
consonants together. Speakers of German don’t deliberately try to be blunt; rather,
the effect comes from the sound of the language.
Table 7-6 walks you through a wider range of ways you can respond diplomatically
when you want to signal your reservations. Each German expression is followed by an
example phrase and its English equivalent. Some of the expressions are one-word
introductory signals that you use to preface your opinion; others are longer phrases
that you use in German to sound diplomatic, to qualify your standpoint, or to negoti-
ate acceptance of your suggestion.
Another bonus for using such expressions is that you gain time while you decide
whether you really want to agree or disagree with the person you’re conversing with.
That’s a thankful bonus when you’re speaking a language that isn’t your own and you
want to sound intelligent — and intelligible — in what you say.

You have no reason to flirt with Jonas.  He doesn’t give you flowers like I
always do, he doesn’t have a car, and even worse, he has no work.  I’m
telling you, Jonas is not the man for you.
Perhaps you don’t like me because I don’t have any hair or muscles.  What
can I say?  You’re no beauty queen yourself.  Farewell.

Up the Subjunctive

ost English and German speakers who aren’t used to analyzing their language —
and that probably includes zillions of otherwise perfectly normal people —
would be seriously challenged if they had to explain the ins and outs of the subjunc-
tive. Although the word subjunctive may conjure up thoughts of doctors discussing an
unpleasant eye infection, it’s actually an innocuous description for the way verbs tell
events that are contrary to fact. Consider the subjunctive as an umbrella term for
describing all sorts of unreal situations: hypothetical, unlikely, uncertain, potential,
probable, or doubtful events.
In German, the subjunctive gets extra mileage because you also use it to describe
polite requests. This chapter deals with how to construct the various forms of the
subjunctive and how to use them in German. You also find out the differences
between the subjunctive and conditional in German and English. To get you off and
running, the next section explains the terminology surrounding the subjunctive.
Terms and Conditions: Unraveling
Subjunctive Terminology
Discussing the subjunctive is pretty tough if you’re not familiar with the lingo. The 
following sections help you keep the terms straight so you can better understand the
subjunctive and how to use it.
Getting in the mood
If someone asks you what your mood is today, you’re unlikely to answer, “Oh, I’m in a
real indicative mood today, but yesterday I was kind of subjunctive.” But if sentences
could speak about themselves, that’s exactly what they’d say. See, a mood in language
terms (as opposed to emotional terms) is the manner in which the speaker perceives
an action. Take a look:

 Indicative mood: The indicative mood states a fact or deals with a real situation,
usually in the form of a statement or a question, such as I live in Waterford or
Where are you from originally?
 Imperative mood: This mood is the command form (which I discuss in Chapter 6),
such as Get out of here!
 Subjunctive mood: The subjunctive mood expresses non-factual, hypothetical,
or similar “unreal” actions and thoughts as a statement or a question. In German,
you’d use the subjunctive form in these example sentences:
I’d like 200 grams of that cheese, please.
Would you marry someone 25 years younger than you?
Comparing subjunctive types 
and the conditional
In English grammar terms, the conditional can refer to a clause or a sentence that
describes circumstances in varying stages of “reality.” A typical example of a conditional
sentence in English is the if-type question: What would you do if you were to win a million
in the lottery? The verb in the main clause what would you do is in the conditional.
In German, you use verbs in the subjunctive form in if-type conditional sentences that
express a condition contrary to fact. But that’s not the only use of the subjunctive —
you find two subjunctive groups in German. Here’s how they compare:
 Subjunctive I: People use Subjunctive I in indirect discourse (indirect speech),
most often in the printed media to report what someone says. For this reason,
when you do come across this subjunctive form, try to recognize what the verbs
mean; you’ll probably never need to use Subjunctive I yourself.
 Subjunctive II: In terms of importance to you, Subjunctive I takes a back seat to
Subjunctive II. You use Subjunctive II for expressing imagined things, describing
information contrary to fact, or making wishes and requests.
(Note: Both Subjunctive I and Subjunctive II forms can refer to events in the present,
past, and future.)
The common denominator of subjunctives in both English and German is that they
express a specific mood, namely — you’ll never believe it! — the subjunctive mood.
Beyond that, in everyday German, the Subjunctive II form is very much alive and kick-
ing, but in English, it’s relegated to a dusty corner in terms of how often you use it. 
Both groups, the German Subjunctive I and Subjunctive II, have definite differences in
form and function from each other and from verbs in the indicative mood. In contrast,
very few English verbs even have a special subjunctive form, so you may be using it
without realizing it. One example of the subjunctive in English is If I were you. In a sen-
tence without if, you’d say I was, but with if (the element that adds unreality to the
action), you use the subjunctive: If I were you.
In the following sections, I first map out what you need to know about the present and
past Subjunctive II forms so that you can recognize them, form them, and use them in
everyday spoken and written German. After that, I discuss the present and past forms
of the not-so-common Subjunctive I.
120
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Selecting the Present Subjunctive II: 
How and When to Use It
When you pack your suitcase to travel to a German-speaking region, remember to
include the Subjunctive II form. That way, you can order in a café: Ich möchte eine
Tasse Kaffee bitte (I’d like a cup of coffee) or agree with the tour guide’s suggestion to
visit the king’s private quarters: Ich hätte schon Interesse daran (I’d be really inter-
ested in that). With a few more subjunctive expressions in your bag, you can express
actions that are contrary to fact and more.
Even though the subjunctive is used a lot more frequently in German than in English,
the average German speaker would probably get tangled up trying to explain the
Subjunctive II, let alone listing all its uses. It’s so embedded in the language that its
use isn’t obvious to the native speaker. So relax, take a deep breath, and read on.
In this section, I show you two ways to form the present Subjunctive II to make hypo-
thetical statements, request something, and express wishes. The most frequent form
of present Subjunctive II is the construction of würde + infinitive. Look at this exam-
ple: Ich würde gern nach Hamburg fahren (I’d like to go to Hamburg). Most verbs
use this two-part construction. 
The other means of forming the present Subjunctive II that I show you in this section
is common for only a small but important group of verbs. You form this subjunctive
by putting the main verb itself into the subjunctive form. All verbs have subjunctive
forms, but in formal written German, you find only a few — and an even smaller
number is in everyday written and spoken German. The verbs that do commonly use
the present Subjunctive II in the main verb are the modal verbs (see Chapter 9 for
modal verbs), the auxiliaries haben (to have) and sein (to be) (see Chapter 5 for more
on haben and sein), and a few others. I describe this present subjunctive form in the
section “Forming the Subjunctive II of haben, sein, and modal verbs.” After that, I go
over how to use these two forms of the Subjunctive II. Read on.
Creating the present Subjunctive II with würde
The present Subjunctive II form using würde + infinitive has many uses. To make a
request, you need to sound polite, especially when you’re asking someone to do (or not
do) something; therefore, you use this form — for example, Würden Sie mir bitte
helfen? (Would you help me please?). In this section, I show you how to form the würde
construction to make hypothetical statements, request something, and express wishes.
The common form of present subjunctive, using the würde construction, is easy to
remember. It uses the simple past form of the infinitive werden (which translates to
will in this context) plus an umlaut: Wurde changes to würde, the subjunctive of
werden, and becomes equivalent to would in English. (In other words, it uses the
present subjunctive form of werden like a modal verb — see Chapter 9 for more on
modal verbs.) Add the infinitive form of the main verb you want to express in a sub-
junctive mood, and presto!
Look at the conjugation of werden in the verb table. It builds the würde subjunctive
construction in the present. You use the subjunctive form of werden plus the main
verb in the infinitive. In the verb table, arbeiten (to work) is the main verb.
121

würde arbeiten (subjunctive: would work)
ich würde arbeiten 
wir würden arbeiten
du würdest arbeiten
ihr würdet arbeiten
er/sie/es würde arbeiten
sie würden arbeiten
Sie würden arbeiten
Ich würde gerne in Wien arbeiten. (I’d [really] like to work in Vienna.)
Look at some examples:
Würden Sie mir bitte mit meinem Koffer helfen? (Would you help me with my
suitcase, please?) The speaker is making a polite request.
Ich würde gerne nach Salzburg reisen. (I’d love to travel to Salzburg.) The
speaker is wishfully thinking of traveling to Salzburg.
An deiner Stelle würde ich lieber den Kilimanjaro anschauen. (If I were you, I’d
rather see Kilimanjaro.) The speaker is making a hypothetical statement with the
condition if I were you.
The modal verbs dürfen, können, mögen, müssen, sollen, and wollen, as well as the
auxiliaries haben and sein, don’t generally use the subjunctive construction using
würde. See the next section for details.
Complete the sentences, putting the correct form of würden into the spaces. The
people I mention are imagining they’ve made a windfall profit in the stock market (no
harm in imagining, right?). The sentences all answer the question Was würden sie
tun? (What would they do?).

Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Forming the Subjunctive II of haben, 
sein, and modal verbs
German speakers often use haben (to have) and sein (to be) in the present subjunc-
tive form to express wishes, hypothetical situations, and things contrary to fact, such
as ich hätte mehr Zeit (I would have more time) or es wäre einfacher (it would be
easier). The modal auxiliary verbs use the present subjunctive for expressing wishes
and other situations by combining with another verb in the infinitive form — for
example, Sie sollten vorsichtig fahren (You/they should drive carefully). All these
verbs — plus a few strong verbs — take the same subjunctive endings.
Haben and sein
To form the subjunctive with haben (to have), start with hatte (the simple past tense),
remove the -e, and add an umlaut plus the appropriate subjunctive ending: -e, -est, -e, 
-en, -et, -en, and -en.
hätte (subjunctive: would have)
ich hätte
wir hätten
du hättest
ihr hättet
er/sie/es hätte
sie hätten
Sie hätten
Ich hätte lieber ein umweltfreundliches Auto. (I’d rather have an environmentally friendly car.)
As for sein (to be), to form the present subjunctive, start with war (the simple past
tense) and add an umlaut and the appropriate subjunctive ending: -e, -est, -e, -en, -et, 
-en, and -en.
wäre (subjunctive: would be)
ich wäre
wir wären
du wärest
ihr wäret
er/sie/es wäre
sie wären
Sie wären
Wir wären sicher reich. (We’d certainly be rich.)
Modal verbs and other special verbs
German uses the present Subjunctive II with modal verbs (dürfen, können, mögen,
müssen, sollen, and wollen) quite frequently, and forming the present subjunctive
with these verbs isn’t that difficult. Just take the simple past form of the verb, add an
umlaut if there’s one in the infinitive, and add the appropriate subjunctive endings: -e,
-est, -e, -en, -et, -en, and -en. Only two modals — sollen and wollen — have no umlaut
in the infinitive. (For information on simple past tense of modals, see Chapter 17.)
123
Chapter 8: Describing Your Mood: Summing Up the Subjunctive

könnte (subjunctive: could, would be able to)
ich könnte
wir könnten
du könntest
ihr könntet
er/sie/es könnte
sie könnten
Sie könnten
Sie könnte uns helfen. (She could/would be able to help us.)
As you see in the three preceding verb tables, the meaning in the subjunctive is differ-
ent from the present-tense indicative form. You see would in the English translation of
the subjunctive verb. Have changes to would have, and be changes to would be. In the
case of können, both of its meanings undergo a transformation: Able to changes to
would be able to, and can changes to could.
Note: Although all verbs have subjunctive forms of the main verb, only a few are
common in informal written and spoken German. These verbs use the subjunctive form
of the main verb instead of the würde + infinitive construction. The verbs you are most
likely to come across include gehen (to go), heißen (to be called), tun (to do), werden
(to become), and wissen (to know [a fact]). These verbs form the subjunctive as follows:
 For strong verbs, as with modal verbs, the present subjunctive is based on the
simple past form of the verb + umlaut (when applicable) + subjunctive endings -e, 
-est, -e, en, -et, -en, and -en — for example, gehen (to go) becomes ginge (would go).
 For weak verbs, the present subjunctive is the same as the simple past tense
(you use the same simple-past endings) — for example, kaufen (to buy) becomes
kaufte (would buy).
See Chapter 16 and Appendix A for more on strong and weak verbs.
Using the present Subjunctive II
This section breaks down the ways you can use the present Subjunctive II. In every-
day German, you can use this multi-tasker to express a variety of contrary-to-fact situ-
ations. In addition, you can express wishes and make polite requests. For example,
imagine you’re planning what do to during your three-day stay in Wien (Vienna). You
say, Wir könnten die Spanische Reitschule sehen (We could see the Spanish Riding
School). In the example, könnten is the subjunctive form (in the present) of the verb
können (can). Look at the most important uses of the present Subjunctive II.
Describing a hypothetical situation or a wish
When you want to express a hypothetical situation or a wish that can or can’t be ful-
filled, you often imagine a scenario. German uses the subjunctive in such situations:
Wenn ich nur etwas mehr Zeit hätte! (If only I had a little more time!) You don’t
have more time, so you’re wishing you did. Hätte (had) is the subjunctive form of
haben (to have).
124
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Ich wollte, ich hätte mehr Geschwister. (I wish I had more siblings.) This sentence
contains two subjunctives, wollte and hätte. If you want to get technical, ich
wollte actually means I would wish.
Describing a condition
You use the subjunctive to talk about a condition that’s contrary to fact — for exam-
ple, when you’re considering what you would (or wouldn’t) do if something that isn’t
true now were true. (See the earlier section “Terms and Conditions: Unraveling
Subjunctive Terminology” for more on conditional sentences with if.) Look at the
examples:
Wenn du kein Affe wärest, würde ich dich heiraten. (If you weren’t a monkey, 
I’d marry you.) The verbs wärest (were) and würde (would) + infinitive heiraten
(to marry) are both subjunctive forms. In English, the verb in the main clause 
(I’d marry you) is a conditional; technically speaking, the if-clause uses the sub-
junctive mood, expressed by weren’t.
Hätte ich die Zeit, so würde ich den Roman lesen. (If I had time, I’d read that
novel.) Both verbs hätte (had) and würde (would) + infinitive lesen (to read) are
subjunctives; in English, the verb in the main clause (I’d read novels) is a condi-
tional; the if-clause uses the subjunctive mood, expressed by had.
Politely making a request
You use the subjunctive to make a polite request — for example, when you’re hungry
and you’d like to have something:
Könnte ich noch ein Stück Fleisch nehmen? (Could I take another piece of meat?)
Könnte (could) is the subjunctive form of können (can, to be able to), and using it
makes your request sound polite. Kann ich . . . ? (Can I . . . ?), where the verb is in
the indicative mood, is direct; it lacks the politeness of the subjunctive Könnte
ich . . . ?
Ich möchte die Speisekarte, bitte. (I’d like the menu, please.) The subjunctive Ich
möchte (I’d like) is the polite way of ordering food, selecting an item in a store,
and so on.
Expressing your feelings and/or opinion
When you state your feelings or express your opinion on something, you often use
the subjunctive in German:
Das wäre prima! (That would be fantastic!) Your enthusiastic reply to someone’s
suggestion about going to hear your favorite band includes the subjunctive wäre
(would be).
Wir sollten diese Wurst probieren. (We should try this sausage.) You think some-
thing would be a good idea, so you use the subjunctive. Here, the subjunctive is
sollten (should) + infinitive probieren (try).
Some employees are planning a party for Peter, a colleague who is relocating to India.
It’s supposed to be eine Überraschung (a surprise). Complete the sentences by filling in
the forms of the subjunctive verbs using the infinitive verbs in parentheses.

Forming and Using the Past Subjunctive II
When you want to express events that might have taken place in the past, you use the
past Subjunctive II. Perhaps you wish you’d accomplished something, but you never
got around to it. You may regret having done something — or the other way around.
You use the past Subjunctive II for such situations. 
Imagine you want to describe something that you would (or wouldn’t) have done in a
certain situation in the past; you say, Ich hätte das nicht gemacht (I wouldn’t have
done that). You form the past Subjunctive II with the present subjunctive form of
either haben or sein + the past participle of the main verb that you want to express
in the subjunctive. In the preceding example, the past subjunctive is hätte (would
have) + gemacht (done).
This section runs through the details of forming and using the past Subjunctive II.
Forming the past Subjunctive II
The past subjunctive deals with past actions and events that might have happened in
the past. At first glance, the past subjunctive seems to be a clone of the past perfect
(see Chapter 17 for past perfect). Indeed, it’s the same, with the exception of an
umlaut in hätte and wäre. You can simply remember that the past subjunctive is
formed like this:
 Present subjunctive of haben = hätte + past participle (geholfen) = hätte
(geholfen)
 Present subjunctive of sein = wäre + past participle (gegangen) = wäre (gegangen)
The endings for the present subjunctive are always the same (in this case, you add
them to hätt- and wär-): -e, -est, -e, -en, -et, -en, -en.
126
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Using the past Subjunctive II
Do you reflect on situations? Time slips by, and events, relationships, and memories
drop off into oblivion. Before that happens, though, you may catch yourself saying, 
“I wouldn’t have jumped into marriage so quickly,” or “I might have dyed my hair
green.” The past subjunctive lets you do this type of reminiscing in German, describ-
ing scenarios that may or may not have happened. And even if you aren’t the type to
dwell on the past, you’ll be able to understand what other people are talking about
when they say ich hätte sie angerufen (I would have called her).
You can use three past-tense verb forms in the indicative, but you need only one form
of the past subjunctive. Look at the examples:
 Er hätte uns geholfen. (He would have helped us.) This past Subjunctive II form
stands in for three indicative sentences in the past:
Er hat uns geholfen. (He helped/has helped us.)
Er half uns. (He helped us.)
Er hatte uns geholfen. (He had helped us.)
 Sie wäre gegangen. (She would have gone.) This past Subjunctive II form stands
in for three indicative sentences in the past:
Sie ist gegangen. (She went/has gone.)
Sie ging. (She went.)
Sie war gegangen. (She had gone.)
In order to get the hang of putting your ideas into the past Subjunctive II, try changing
past actions from fact into a hypothetical situation; in other words, start with a sentence
that describes something that did or didn’t happen (that’s the indicative mood). Write it
down in German — for example, Ich habe eine Katze gehabt. (I had a cat.). Now imagine
you didn’t have a cat, but you would’ve had one if your parents hadn’t had allergies.
Change the verb as a fact (had) into past subjunctive (would have had) by changing
habe to hätte. Now you have Ich hätte eine Katze gehabt (I would have had a cat).
In the following exercise, you see sentences written in the indicative mood. They
describe some event that has happened. Change them into the past subjunctive mood
to indicate that these events could have happened in the past (but didn’t). Before you
start, review the verb tables for the subjunctive of haben and sein, and check out the
information in the bulleted list showing how the three types of indicative past forms
change into the past subjunctive. The example sentence leads the way.
Q. Sascha hat einen Job gefunden.
A. Sascha hätte einen Job gefunden. (Sascha would have found a job.)
16. Liselotte und Heinz haben ein Haus in Ludwigshafen gekauft.

__________________________________________________________________________________
19. Du hast die Reise besser geplant.
__________________________________________________________________________________
20. Er wanderte den ganzen Tag in den Bergen.
__________________________________________________________________________________
Two-timing the past subjunctive: 
Using double infinitives
If only more wishful thinking using the subjunctive were coming your way . . . oh, it is!
This time, the infinitive verb comes in a double pack, and one of the verbs is a modal
verb — dürfen, können, mögen, müssen, sollen, or wollen. The purpose of adding
the modal verb to another verb is to express what you might have been allowed to do
(hätte machen dürfen), could have done (hätte machen können), and so on.
The construction consists of the present Subjunctive II, hätte. (Wäre doesn’t combine
with the modal verbs.) The two infinitive verbs are together at the end of the phrase,
with the modal in the second position. Look at the two example sentences:
Ich hätte eine längere Reise machen können. (I could have made/could have
been able to make a longer trip.) The word order follows the standard procedure,
with the active verb hätte in second position in the sentence. The verb machen
precedes the modal verb können at the end of the phrase.
Er hätte früher nach Hause fahren sollen. (He should have driven home earlier.)
The word order follows the standard procedure with the active verb hätte in
second position in the sentence. The main verb fahren and the modal sollen go to
the very end of the sentence.
Subjunctive I: Used in Indirect Discourse
Another way to describe indirect discourse is indirect speech. It’s the kind of informa-
tion you read in print when someone writes something that someone else said, but
it’s not in quotation marks. Journalists use this form of writing to avoid quoting 
someone directly. Indirect speech frees the writer from taking responsibility for the
statement’s accuracy. As far as your needs go, you can leave its usage to the media
pundits. Just get the hang of what this subjunctive looks like by understanding how
you form the Subjunctive I, knowing where you run across it, and what it means, and
you’re all set.
Note: In English and German, you encounter this subjunctive form almost exclusively
in the third-person singular — er (he), sie (she), es (it) — or the plural sie (they). In
English, the present Subjunctive I is the infinitive form of the verb. In its rare appear-
ances in English, it may be be a (somewhat obsolete) statement such as so be it, or it
may invoke a higher power: May the spirit of the holiday season be with you.
128
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Recognizing the present Subjunctive I
As you read a German newspaper or magazine, you encounter the present
Subjunctive I when the writer wants to report someone else’s original statement. The
information — an indirect quotation — may be a opinion, a fact, a plan, and so on, as
in Sie meinte, sie habe nicht genug Zeit (She thought [that] she didn’t have enough
time). You always use a comma to separate the indirect statement from the person
who’s telling the information.
You form the present Subjunctive I by taking the infinitive stem of the verb and
adding the subjunctive verb endings: -e, -est, -e, -en, -et, -en, and -en. All verbs follow
this pattern with one exception: sein (to be). Look at the verb table showing gehen
(to go, walk), paying special attention to the commonly used third-person forms. The
infinitive stem is geh-. The endings are indicated in bold.
gehe (present Subjunctive I: go/walk)
ich gehe
wir gehen
du gehest
ihr gehet
er/sie/es gehe
sie gehen
Sie gehen
Er sagte, er gehe nicht. (He said he wasn’t going.)
Look at the only irregular exception for present Subjunctive I, the verb sein:
sei (present Subjunctive I: am/is/are/was/were)
ich sei
wir seien
du seist
ihr seiet
er/sie/es sei
sie seien
Sie seien
Sie sagte, es sei zu früh. (She said it was too early.)
Note: In indirect speech in English, journalists often use the past tense to describe
events that may still be occurring (to reflect that the original statement referred to
events as they were at the time of speech). Thus, I use the past tense in the English
translations.
Look at the examples of present Subjunctive I:
Er sagte, er habe eine neue Freundin. (He said he had a new girlfriend.) Habe is
the present Subjunctive I form of haben. Although you say He said he had . . . , the
information (usually) has present meaning.
Der Bundeskanzler sagte, er werde das Problem lösen. (The German Chancellor
said he would solve the problem.) Werde is the present Subjunctive I form of
werden. This statement expresses a future event using werde + lösen.
129
Chapter 8: Describing Your Mood: Summing Up the Subjunctive

Recognizing the Past Subjunctive I
The past Subjunctive I is the subjunctive you find in the press to describe actions that
are what someone else has said about an event in the past. German uses the past sub-
junctive to describe three past tenses: simple past (see Chapter 17), present perfect
(Chapter 16), and past perfect (Chapter 17).
You form the past Subjunctive I by using the appropriate conjugated form of the pres-
ent subjunctive of haben (to have) or sein (to be) and adding the past participle (for
information on the past participle, see Chapter 16). All verbs follow this pattern. Look
at the past Subjunctive I conjugation of the verb wohnen (to live, reside), which uses
the auxiliary verb haben.
habe gewohnt (past Subjunctive I: had lived)
ich habe gewohnt
wir haben gewohnt
du habest gewohnt
ihr habet gewohnt
er/sie/es habe gewohnt
sie haben gewohnt
Sie haben gewohnt
Sie sagte, sie habe in einer kleinen Wohnung gewohnt. 
(She said she had lived in a small apartment.)
Look at the past Subjunctive I conjugation of gehen, which uses the auxiliary verb sein.
sei gegangen (past Subjunctive I: had gone )
ich sei gegangen
wir seien gegangen
du seist gegangen
ihr seiet gegangen
er/sie/es sei gegangen
sie seien gegangen
Sie seien gegangen
Er sagte, er sei in die Stadt gegangen. (He said he had gone into the city.)
Look at the examples of past Subjunctive I. The most common use for indirect dis-
course (indirect speech) is to report what someone said.
Er sagte, er habe letzte Woche Golf gespielt. (He said he had played golf last
week.) To form the past Subjunctive I, you combine habe, the present Subjunctive
I form of haben, with the past participle of spielen: habe gespielt.
Die Bundeskanzlerin sagte, sie sei nicht mit dem Verteidigungsminister geflo-
gen. (The German Chancellor said she hadn’t flown with the Defense Secretary.) To
form the past Subjunctive I, you combine sei, the present Subjunctive I form of
sein, with the past participle of fliegen: sei geflogen.

with Modal Auxiliaries

 Putting modals to work: Conjugating the present tense
 Clearing up confusion: English and German differences
 Choosing between similar verbs
I
hope you’re in a good mood as you start on this chapter about modal auxiliary
verbs. I’m talking about attitude with a capital A in the next few pages. In grammar
mumbo jumbo, modals are auxiliary (helping) verbs that indicate an attitude about
the main verb, even though they don’t directly alter the main verb’s action.
This motley band of modal verbs helps set the mood of the sentence. They can, at times,
be quite influential in their mood-altering abilities — and all without illegal substances.
Mood is grammarspeak for how something is expressed in a sentence: The mood of a
verb indicates a wide range of, yes, moods such as probability, impossibility, certainty,
doubt, or even just plain old facts, without all the Schnickschnack (bells and whistles).
If you’re asking yourself whether you can get by without using modals, the answer is
plain and simple: No way, José — not unless you’re willing to put up with being misun-
derstood in daily situations in which the modals should make your intended thought
clear to the listener. In this chapter, you find out what the seven modal verbs are,
together with their equivalents in English, and you discover the importance of modal
verbs in everyday situations. You get the present-tense conjugation of these verbs and
the particulars on important characteristics of these verbs. Then you put the informa-
tion all together and try your hand at the exercises at the end of each verb section.
The 4-1-1 on Modal Verbs
Modal verbs modify the main verb in the sentence. Here’s how they work: You take a
plain old verb or phrase like eat, sleep, walk, plant a garden, play tennis, learn how to
play chess, or do nothing. Then you think about your attitude toward these activities,
and you decide you want to say I like to eat, I must sleep more, I would like to walk
every day, I should plant a garden, I can play tennis well, I want to learn how to play
chess, or I may do nothing. The underlined modal verbs offer you a wide range of ways
to express your attitude toward actions such as eat, sleep, play, and learn.

You find modals working their magic in sentences in the indicative mood. This type of
mood is for stating facts. Modal verbs also crop up in sentences expressed in the sub-
junctive mood. That’s what you use when you want to sound polite when requesting
or suggesting something or when you want to make hypothetical statements.
(Chapter 8 is where you find out about the subjunctive.) This section gives you a
quick overview of what modal verbs are and how they work. The rest of this chapter
focuses on the seven specific modal verbs.
Identifying modals: Assistants with attitude
Modals are your ticket to conveying your attitude or how you feel about an action.
They usually accompany another verb and appear in the second position of a 
sentence. The verb they assist generally appears at the end of the clause.
Table 9-1 shows the German modal verbs in infinitive form and the English transla-
tion, followed by a statement using the modal verb. Look at the various ways of modi-
fying the statement Ich lerne Deutsch (I learn German) with the modal verbs. Notice
that the modal verb is in second position in the sentence, and the main verb gets
booted to the end.

These verbs all have regular verb endings in their plural forms (wir, ihr, sie, and Sie).
Most of them also have irregular verb changes, some of which you can see in the
examples in Table 9-1. As you go through Die Glorreichen Sieben (The Magnificent
Seven — modal verbs, that is) in this chapter, you see the irregular verb endings of
these verbs in the present tense.
134
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

In English, you typically have two verbs in a sentence that has a modal verb; the
second one is described as the main verb. In German, however, the modal verb may
be the only verb. The one true rogue is the verb mögen, which frequently stands
alone, and to a lesser extent, its sidekick möchten. (Check out the sections “I Like
That: Mögen, the Likeable Verb” and “What Would You Like? Möchten, the Preference
Verb” for more information on these two.)
Understanding word order and modals
In terms of word order for modals, German uses pretty much the same order as for
other verbs that require an auxiliary verb to complete the meaning of the main verb.
The present perfect and the future tenses also use a secondary, auxiliary verb to com-
plete the main verb’s meaning. With these verb types (and tenses), you conjugate the
auxiliary verb, put it in second position in the sentence, and generally put the main
verb at the end of the clause or phrase. (See Chapter 16 for present perfect verbs and
Chapter 18 for future tense verbs and their word order.)
Look at the examples in Table 9-1. The conjugated, active verb is in second position in
the sentence. It directly follows the subject or other elements, such as a reference to
time or a prepositional phrase. When you need more than one verb, the others go to
the very end of the sentence.
Questions follow a slightly different word order (inverted word order) if they’re the
type of question that can be answered with yes, no, or maybe. See Chapter 6 for more
on forming questions.
May I? Dürfen, the Permission Verb
Some people feel rules and customs crimp their personal style, but such guidelines
give people an idea of what they can expect from each other. The rules of the road
allow you to do something (or not) — you may proceed with caution at a yield sign,
but you’re not allowed to cross the double yellow line. And being polite by asking per-
mission — May I use your bathroom? May I have another cookie? — is certainly not
limited to little boys and girls. Adults in all parts of the world know that asking for
and granting permission is part of the code of polite interaction.
You use the modal verb dürfen to ask for and grant permission. Look at the conjuga-
tion of dürfen. It’s irregular in the singular forms: ich, du, and er/sie/es. In the table,
the irregular forms are bold, and the regular forms show the endings in bold.
dürfen (may, to be allowed to, to be permitted to)
ich darf
wir dürfen
du darfst
ihr dürft
er/sie/es darf
sie dürfen
Sie dürfen
Sie dürfen dort nicht parken. (You’re not allowed to park there.)
135
Chapter 9: In the Mood: Combining Verbs with Modal Auxiliaries

German uses dürfen in a wide variety of everyday situations. Table 9-2 lists four com-
monly used idiomatic expressions with dürfen, followed by an example sentence in
German and the English equivalent. You frequently hear these expressions in polite
exchanges between people who don’t know each other well.
Table 9-2
Uses of Dürfen In Polite Conversation
Situation
Example
English Equivalent
to ask whether a customer 
Was darf es sein?
May I help you?
needs assistance
to signal someone to do a favor 
Darf ich Sie bitten?
May I trouble you? 
such as opening the door
to say that you’d like to introduce 
Darf ich Ihnen Frau

two people to each other 
Feuerstein vorstellen?
Mrs. Feuerstein? 
to explain that something is 
Das Obst dürfen Sie nicht 
You may not/must not 
not allowed
anfassen.
touch the fruit.
Generally speaking, German and English use dürfen (may, to be allowed to, to be per-
mitted to) in very similar ways: to ask for permission, to grant permission, and to state
that something is (or is not) permitted or allowed.
German sometimes uses the impersonal form man (it, one, you) with dürfen; in
English, you use the passive construction (parking/passing/stopping isn’t allowed
here), or you simply say no parking/passing/stopping (allowed here).
English uses may to express possibility, whereas dürfen doesn’t have this meaning.
Instead, you’d use vielleicht (maybe/perhaps) to express possibility or chance. For
instance, you can translate Vielleicht komme ich spät nach Hause as I may come
home late. However, Perhaps I’ll come home late is closer to the word-for-word transla-
tion, even though German doesn’t use the future tense in the example sentence. (For
more information on the present tense, see Chapter 5.)
Watch out for false friends (which I discuss in Chapter 4). The modal verb müssen
looks somewhat similar to the English must, which is the correct meaning in English;
however, you express must not in German with nicht dürfen: Sie dürfen hier nicht
rauchen (You must not/are not allowed to smoke here).
You Can Do It! Können, the Ability Verb
Can you run a marathon barefoot? Do you know how to play chess (and win) against a
computer? Are you able to make a five-course dinner for 12 guests without batting an
eye? No matter what your hidden talents may be, if you have a healthy ego, then
chances are you enjoy talking about yourself. Know-how, ability, and can-do attitude —
all are expressed with the verb können.
136
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

As one of the seven players in the modal verb dugout, können (can, to be able to, to
know how to) is a true champ. In general, German and English use können in similar
ways. The verb goes up to bat whenever you need to express that
 You can or can’t do something: Kannst du Tennis/Tischtennis/Volleyball/
Schach/Poker spielen? (Can you play tennis/table tennis/volleyball/chess/
poker?)
 You know or don’t know how to do something: Er kann Geige/Klavier/
Keyboards/Gitarre/Klarinette/Saxophon spielen. (He knows how to play the
violin/piano/keyboards/guitar/clarinet/saxophone.) In German, you don’t use the
definite article der, die, das [the] to talk about playing an instrument.
 You are able to do something: Ich kann bis Mittag schlafen. (I’m able to/can
sleep until noon.)
 You want to request or offer help in a polite but direct way: Können Sie mir
sagen, wo der Bahnhof/die Straßenbahnhaltestelle/das Hotel Blaue Gans/
das Kunstmuseum ist? (Can you tell me where the train station/the streetcar
stop/the Hotel Blaue Gans/the art museum is?)
Note: Notice the comma after the first clause. In German, you need this comma
to separate the subordinate clause (. . . wo der Bahnhof ist?) from the main
clause (Können Sie mir sagen, . . .). Subordinate clauses often begin with words
like wo (where), was (what), wie viel (how much), wer (who), and warum (why).
The conjugated verb in the subordinate clause, ist (is), gets the boot and lands at
the end of the sentence. (For more on subordinate clauses, see Chapter 14.)
Look at the conjugation of können. It’s irregular in the singular forms: ich, du, and
er/sie/es. The irregular forms are bold, and the regular forms show the endings in
bold.
können (can, to be able to, to know how to)
ich kann
wir können
du kannst
ihr könnt
er/sie/es kann
sie können
Sie können
Ich kann Ihnen mit ihrem Gepäck helfen. (I can help you with your luggage.)
One striking difference between English and German is that German sometimes
describes what can or can’t be done using können but no main verb. Typically, you
hear the following expressions in spoken, casual conversation. Table 9-3 lists the situ-
ation, an example sentence in German, and its equivalent in English.

A number of common können expressions are reflexive (they use a reflexive pronoun
[me, you, us, and so on] with the verb) in German but not in English. German uses the
reflexive much more frequently than English. (For more information on reflexive
verbs, check out Chapter 11.) Table 9-4 lists these common expressions, an example
sentence in German, and the English translation.

Decide whether the word order for the following expressions is correct. If not, make
the necessary correction in word order. Remember that when there are two verbs, the
main verb (the one that’s in infinitive form) gets kicked to the end of the sentence.
(Harsh treatment for some decent, upstanding verbs, but it’s true!)
Q. Sie kann spielen Klarinette. 
A. Sie kann Klarinette spielen. (She can play the clarinet.) The word order needs to have the
conjugated verb kann in second position and the main verb spielen (in the infinitive
form) at the end of the sentence.

I Like That: Mögen, the Likeable Verb
Want to talk about likes and dislikes? Mögen is the verb for you. Consider these 
sentences: Magst du kaltes Wetter? (Do you like cold weather?) Nein, ich mag den
Winter überhaupt nicht. (No, I don’t like the winter at all.) Want to express your 
feelings toward someone? Try ich mag dich (I like you).
The main definition of mögen is that of liking or disliking someone or something.
When talking about such preferences, you usually don’t need an additional verb:
Magst du diese Sängerin? (Do you like this female singer?)
Er mag kein Starkbier. (He doesn’t like strong beer.)
The modal verb mögen comes as a double dipper. Why? Because mögen (to like, to
care for) is so likeable that it has a sidekick, möchten (would like, would like to do),
which is similar in meaning to mögen. (Check out the next section for more on
möchten.)
This verb table shows you the conjugation of mögen. It follows the typical pattern of
modal verbs: the singular verb forms are the irregular ones — ich mag, du magst,
er/sie/es mag. The irregular forms are shown in bold, and the regular forms show the
endings in bold.
mögen (to like, to care for)
ich mag
wir mögen
du magst
ihr mögt
er/sie/es mag
sie mögen
Sie mögen
Ich mag klassische Musik. (I like classical music.)
139
Chapter 9: In the Mood: Combining Verbs with Modal Auxiliaries

When you want to express dislike for someone or something, you put nicht at the end
of the sentence when no other verb is along for the ride:
Ihr mögt diese Farbe nicht. (You don’t like this color.)
Mögen sie Schokoladeneis nicht? (Don’t they like chocolate ice cream?)
To add some oomph to mögen, you can use a number of expressions with gern (gern
is similar to a lot when you add it to other words). I arranged the list in order of most
positive to most negative:
 mögen . . . besonders gern (to especially like): Ich mag Bratkartoffeln besonders
gern. (I especially like roast potatoes.) They’re similar to home fries.
 mögen . . . (sehr) gern (to like [very much]): Ich mag Kartoffelklöße (sehr)
gern. (I like potato dumplings very much.) In southern Germany and Austria,
Klöße are referred to as Knödel, both of which are dumplings.
 mögen . . . nicht gern (not to like very much): Ich mag Pommes frites nicht
gern. (I don’t like French fries very much.)
 mögen . . . überhaupt nicht gern (not to like at all): Ich mag Salzkartoffeln
überhaupt nicht gern. (I don’t like boiled potatoes at all.)
A few idiomatic expressions use mögen:
 Das mag sein. (That could be true.)
 Ich mag ihn leiden. (I care for him.) You can also leave off leiden without chang-
ing the meaning much, but leiden stresses the emotion of caring.
 Darin mögen Sie Recht haben. (You have a point there.)
Take a crack at these exercises. Put the correct form of mögen into the sentence. The
example gets you started.
Q. Meine Eltern _________________ die Oper sehr gern.
A. Meine Eltern mögen die Oper sehr gern.
6. _________________ du den Salat?
7. Nein, ich _________________ ihn überhaupt nicht.
8. Er _________________ Horrorfilme.
9. _________________ ihr Klaviermusik nicht?
10. Ja, aber wir _________________ alle Musikarten gern.

What Would You Like? Möchten, 
the Preference Verb
Life is full of choices, and you’re likely to have some opinions on what you like best.
When the Kellner/Kellnerin (waiter/waitress) in a German restaurant asks me “Was
möchten Sie?” (What would you like?), I make sure I order something to drink first —
“Ich möchte eine Apfelsaftschorle” (I’d like an apple juice/mineral water drink). That
way, I have time to peruse the eight-page menu and order the meal later.
To say you’d like to do something in German, you use the modal verb möchten.
Although möchten (would like [to do]) is often lumped together with mögen (to like,
care for) (see the preceding section for more info), it’s definitely important enough to
get top billing in the modal verb lineup. Look at the conjugation of möchten. The verb
endings are in bold.
möchten (would like [to] )
ich möchte
wir möchten
du möchtest
ihr möchtet
er/sie/es möchte
sie möchten
Sie möchten
Ich möchte am Wochenende Rad fahren. (I’d like to go bicycling on the weekend.)
The important similarity that möchten and mögen share, aside from their meanings, is
that neither modal verb needs a main verb to express something clearly. For instance,
when ordering in a restaurant, the context can typically indicate what you’d like to
have. Using möchten as the modal verb, you can omit the following main verbs:
 essen (to eat)
 trinken (to drink)
 haben (to have)
 fahren (to drive)
 gehen (to go, walk)
Look at the two example sentences, one with and one without the main verb.
Assuming you know they’re spoken in a restaurant, the meaning of the first sentence,
which has no main verb, is clear:
Ich möchte ein Glas Rotwein, bitte. (I’d like a glass of red wine, please.)
Ich möchte ein Glas Rotwein trinken, bitte. (I’d like to drink a glass of red wine,
please.) Or you can use haben (to have) instead of trinken, and you’d still get a
glass of red wine.
141
Chapter 9: In the Mood: Combining Verbs with Modal Auxiliaries

German often expresses a preference by using möchten in combination with lieber
(rather). The example dialogue shows haben in parentheses to indicate that it’s not
necessary in the context of the situation:
Möchten Sie einen Fensterplatz (haben)? (Would you like a window seat?)
Nein, ich möchte lieber einen Gangplatz (haben). (No, I’d rather have an aisle
seat.)
It’s your turn to see how polite you sound in German and how good you are at express-
ing things people would like to do. Write the sentences or questions in German, using
the English cues. To help you, I’ve indicated some difficult elements in bold.

Do I Have To? Müssen, the Verb of Necessity
As a child, you may have heard something along the lines of “No, you don’t have to
finish your broccoli au gratin, but you have to try at least three bites.” So now that
you’ve grown up — or at least other people think you have — far more serious obliga-
tions haunt you, such as paying taxes, mowing the lawn, and having the first local
strawberries of the season before anyone else.
Müssen bears a vague resemblance to must, making it easier to get down to the nitty-
gritty of how this modal works, when you need it, when you have to use it, when it’s a
must, and when you don’t have to deal with it. What about must not? Oddly enough,
must not is darf nicht in German, with the modal verb dürfen (to be allowed to).
(Check out the earlier section on dürfen if you’re a bit foggy on the difference
between the two verbs.)
142
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Necessity and obligation are the core meanings of müssen in both English and German,
although in the English-speaking world and among North Americans in particular,
there’s a tendency to downplay the use of must because it sounds so strong to the ear.
Do I have to? works just fine at getting the obligation message across (especially when
uttered by whining 10-year-olds after you’ve told them to turn off the TV and go to bed). 
Take a look at the conjugation of müssen. Like most of its fellow modal verbs, it’s
irregular in the singular forms: ich, du, and er/sie/es. The irregular forms are in bold,
and the regular forms show the endings in bold.
müssen (must, to have to, need to)
ich muss
wir müssen
du musst
ihr müsst
er/sie/es muss
sie müssen
Sie müssen
Er muss morgen früh aufstehen. (He has to get up early tomorrow.)
Don’t get lulled into thinking that muss nicht is equivalent to must not. When you turn
müssen into a negative expression, the similarities between German an English go
down the drain. German has two expressions for indicating whether something is for-
bidden or simply not necessary:
 nicht dürfen (not allowed, must not, not permitted): A no-no; strong prohibition,
such as Du darfst das nicht trinken (You mustn’t drink that).
 nicht müssen (not necessary, don’t need to): An absence of necessity or obliga-
tion, such as Du musst das nicht trinken (You don’t need to drink that).
Should I or Shouldn’t I? 
Sollen, the Duty Verb
There are things in life that you have to do and things you’re supposed to do. I prefer
the latter because they’re easier to put off. But wasting valuable vacation time to
accomplish everything on your checklist is something you really shouldn’t do. So the
to-do list just gets longer and longer until the day it fortuitously gets lost in the trash.
When you want to describe an action you should or shouldn’t do or that you’re
supposed to or not supposed to do, sollen is the verb to use. Look at the conjugation of
this modal verb in the table that follows. Sollen is irregular only in two places — the
ich and er/sie/es forms. The irregular forms are in bold, and the regular forms show
the endings in bold.
143
Chapter 9: In the Mood: Combining Verbs with Modal Auxiliaries

sollen (should, to be supposed to)
ich soll
wir sollen
du sollst
ihr sollt
er/sie/es soll
sie sollen
Sie sollen
Du sollst die Katze füttern. (You should feed the cat.)
You, the non-native speaker of German, should be careful not to sound too forceful
when it isn’t necessary. Sollen, the modal duty verb, is the verb you use for giving
advice or expressing a duty that’s an expected, right-kind-of-thing-to-do action. The
negative version, nicht sollen, expresses what you shouldn’t do. The cousin müssen
is the modal verb of necessity and strong directives — see the earlier section on
müssen.
How’s your sense of duty in German? Finish the sentences with the right conjugated
form of sollen or nicht sollen. The second sentence of these exercises has a clue to
help you decide which one is logical. The sample exercise shows how to proceed.
Q. Ich _________________ etwas trinken. Ich habe Durst.
A. Ich soll etwas trinken. Ich habe Durst. (I should drink something. I’m thirsty.)
16. Wir _________________ unsere Schuhe putzen. Sie sind schmutzig.
17. Du _________________ spät ins Bett gehen. Du siehst sehr müde aus.
18. Ich _________________ den neuen Film sehen. Er ist super.
19. Maria _________________ ein kleineres Auto kaufen. Das Benzin ist sehr teuer.
20. Du _________________ zum Konzert gehen. Die Gruppe ist wirklich schlecht.
I Want to Be Famous: Wollen, 
the Intention Verb
When you were little, did you want to travel around the world in a hot air balloon?
Chances are, by now you’ve scaled back such grand intentions: You wish you could
just remember the names of three famous movie stars. However, you do intend to
travel more — to your son’s soccer games. No matter how grandiose or mundane your
wants and desires may be, you can express them all with wollen, the intention verb.
Expressing your wants (as well as intentions, desires, and a secret wish or two) in
German is simple when you know how to use wollen. Like some others in the band of
modal verbs, it’s irregular in the following forms: ich, du, and er/sie/es — the singular
forms. The irregular forms are in bold, and the regular forms show the endings in
bold. Look at the verb conjugation.
144
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

wollen (to want to, intend to, wish)
ich will
wir wollen
du willst
ihr wollt
er/sie/es will
sie wollen
Sie wollen
Ich will jetzt nach Hause fahren. (I want to drive home now.)
When you’re expressing something you want to do or intend to do, you can substitute
möchten for wollen and come up with virtually the same results (see the earlier sec-
tion “What Would You Like? Möchten, the Preference Verb”). Look at the following
examples. The difference between them is minimal in both languages. The speaker
could be talking to someone or doing some wishful thinking:
Ich will ein neues Auto kaufen. (I want to buy a new car.)
Ich möchte ein neues Auto kaufen. (I would like to buy a new car.)
When you want something from someone else, the two verbs are not interchangeable.
Wollen is direct: You want something. Möchten does express a want in the form of
would like to, but it carries the ring of politeness. Compare the two example sen-
tences that follow. The speaker is a dinner guest in someone’s living room. 
Ich will fernsehen. (I want to watch TV.) The guest is simply stating what he or
she wants or intends to do. There’s no hint, direct or indirect, of a request.
Ich möchte fernsehen. (I would like to watch TV.) The guest sounds polite by
using möchte. A request is likely to follow up the stated intention with a question,
such as Haben Sie etwas dagegen? (Do you mind?).
The expressions using wollen in the following sentences show how its meaning can
bend slightly in conjunction with another word or words:
 wollen . . . gern + infinitive: Stresses desire. (Note: Look at the section in this
chapter on mögen for more ways to use gern.) For example, Er will gern Musik
hören (He feels like listening to music).
 wollen . . . unbedingt: Underscores that you absolutely want something, without
fail, such as Ich will unbedingt nach Australien reisen (I’m dying to travel to
Australia).
 wie + subject + wollen: Notes that a decision is up to somebody else, such as
Wie Sie wollen (It’s up to you). The German title of Shakespeare’s As You Like It is
Wie Ihr Wollt.
 wollen . . . nicht + past participle + haben/sein: Expresses that someone 
doesn’t want to admit having done something (see Chapter 16 for more on past
participles), such as Sie wollen den Unfall nicht gesehen haben (They claim not
to have seen the accident). In other words, they don’t want to admit to having
seen the accident.
 wollen nichts damit zu tun haben: Notes that the subject doesn’t want to be
involved with something, such as Ich will nichts damit zu tun haben
(I want no part of that or I don’t want anything to do with it).
145
Chapter 9: In the Mood: Combining Verbs with Modal Auxiliaries

Check that you know how to use the modal verb wollen in the following exercise.
What do these people want to do? Change the German sentence by adding the correct
form of the modal verb wollen. Word order is important here: Remember to replace
the main verb with the conjugated form of wollen; then throw the main verb to the
back (of the sentence, that is), changing it in midair into the infinitive form. Look at
the example to get you going.
Q. Du machst einen Salat.
A. Du willst einen Salat machen. (You want to make a salad.) Machst changes to machen
before it lands at the end of the sentence.

a
Können Sie mir helfen? (Can you help me?) Können is the conjugated verb, and in a yes/no
question, it’s first; the verb helfen needs to be at the end.
b
Wir können uns kein neues Auto leisten. (We can’t afford a new car.) The word order 
is correct.
c
Könnt ihr gut Tennis spielen? (Can you play tennis well?) The word order is correct.
d
Ich kann Englisch, Deutsch, und Spanisch. (I can speak English, German, and Spanish.) The
sentence is correct. Können needs no other verb here. However, you can add sprechen 
(to speak) at the end of the sentence, especially if you want to go on and say something differ-
ent about another language: Ich kann Französisch verstehen, aber nicht sprechen. (I can
understand French but not speak it.)
e
Ich kann Fußball spielen. (I can play soccer.) The word order is incorrect; in the correct order,
the conjugated modal verb kann is in second position, and the main verb spielen (in infinitive
form) is at the end of the sentence.
f
Magst du den Salat? (Do you like the salad?)
g
Nein, ich mag ihn überhaupt nicht. (No, I don’t like it at all.) The strong negative is expressed
with überhaupt nicht. Ihn is the accusative case pronoun that replaces the accusative, 
masculine noun den Salat.
h
Er mag Horrorfilme. (He likes horror movies.)
i
Mögt ihr Klaviermusik nicht? (Don’t you like piano music?) Notice that nicht is at the end of the

Sorting Out Separable- and
Inseparable-Prefix Verbs
In This Chapter
 Juggling separable-prefix verbs
 Keeping it together with inseparable-prefix verbs
 Rounding up dual-prefix verbs
A
ll you couch potatoes: Use it or lose it! Get up off the couch, put your shoes on,
breathe some air in, and get ready to work out! Why the exercise hype in a chap-
ter on separable- and inseparable-prefix verbs? Wouldn’t it be more appropriate as a
pep talk in a health magazine? Actually, the verbs I deal with in this chapter are the
types you see in italics here. In English, they’re called two-part or phrasal verbs, and
their German counterparts are called separable- or inseparable-prefix verbs. Separable
prefixes can separate from the verb itself, depending on the verb tense you use, and
the inseparable prefixes never separate from the verb. These verb types are equally
common in German and English.
This chapter deals with three categories of verbs: separable-prefix verbs, inseparable-
prefix verbs, and dual-prefix verbs, which I dub the double-crossers because the pre-
fixes can be separable or inseparable.
Looking at the Prefix
The German prefix (which corresponds to the second part of a two-part verb in
English) may stand for a preposition like up or an adverb like away. In both English
and German, the prefix alters the meaning of the original verb, sometimes only
slightly, sometimes radically.
To remember whether these verbs are separable- or inseparable-prefix verbs, prac-
tice pronouncing them aloud. The separable-prefix verbs stress the prefix in spoken
German, but the inseparable-prefix verbs don’t stress the prefix. For instance,
umsteigen (to change [trains, planes, and so on]) is separable, so when you say it,
stress the prefix um- like this: UM-steig-en. Unterbrechen (to interrupt) is inseparable,
so you don’t stress the prefix, but you do stress the first syllable of the verb brechen
like this: un-ter-BRECH-en.

Two-part verbs in English are generally exactly that, in two parts: get + up = get up.
They’re a dime a dozen: turn away, put on, take off — you get the picture. The German
equivalent is different because it has the prefix attached directly to the infinitive (the
base verb form). For example, aufstehen (to get up) has the prefix auf-. (Literally, auf- +
stehen is up + stand.) Such German verbs are extremely common.
You can remember verbs with prefixes using two approaches. First, find out the mean-
ings of the prefixes, and second, know what the prefix and verb mean together. By
using the prefix/verb lists in this chapter, you have the opportunity to try both 
methods at the same time. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more on prepositions.) Although
this may sound complicated, a great deal of these verbs (sans prefix) are garden-
variety types you encounter often in German. By the time you finish the exercises,
you should have a good foundation of these verbs and know how to form and use
them.
Simplifying Separable-Prefix Verbs
With separable-prefix verbs, the verb and the prefix can — drum roll please — split
up (surprise, surprise). Of the three groups of verbs that I discuss in this chapter, this
group is the largest because it has the largest number of prefixes as well as the largest
number of verbs that connect with these prefixes. Knowing the meaning of the verb
without the prefix can help, but make sure you know the separable-prefix verb and its
English meaning. Take a look at the following example. Aufstehen (to get up) is a 
separable-prefix verb. Its prefix, auf-, means up in this context. The verb stehen
means to stand or stay. Notice that the prefix auf-, appears at the end of the sentence:
Ich stehe meistens um sechs Uhr auf (I usually get up at six a.m.).
You get your money’s worth with the prefixes in this section. They’re a great help
when you’re expanding your vocabulary. Why? Not only do they combine with verbs,
but some also combine with nouns and adjectives. Most verb prefixes have more than
one specific meaning, and as you become familiar with them, you start seeing a pat-
tern in the way a prefix alters the meaning of the verbs it combines with. When you
come across a new German verb with the same prefix, you can make an educated
guess about its meaning. These itty bitty sound bites are very influential, so start
your own collection right away.
Table 10-1 shows separable prefixes, their English meanings, and some verbs that use
the prefix. Although this prefix list is fairly complete, the number of separable-prefix
verbs is huge. This sample list contains high-frequency verbs.

This section shows you how to use separable-prefix verbs in the present, the past,
and the present perfect. I break it down by these three tenses; for each verb tense,
you find out whether to do separation work or not, details on how to form the verb
tense, and where to place the two verb parts in the sentence.
Using verbs in the present tense
When you write an e-mail to your friend in Berlin or speak to your German boss,
you’ll probably end up using separable-prefix verbs in the present tense. When doing
so, word order is a really big deal. Why? If you mix up word order, the reader or lis-
tener may not get your intended message. Also, keep in mind that the prefix alters 
the basic verb’s meaning, so if you leave it out, you’re likely to cause confusion. (For
more on word order in present tense, see Chapter 5.)
With separable-prefix verbs in the present tense, keep the following two points in mind:
 The prefix — such as fest- in festhalten (to hold on) — goes to the end of the 
sentence. In spoken German, you stress the prefix.
 The verb itself, which is the part you conjugate, is generally in second position
in the sentence, as in Ich halte mich fest (I’m holding on tight). Halte, the conju-
gated part of the verb, is in second position.
152
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

Here are some guidelines for word order, depending on the type of sentence:
 Statements, both positive and negative: The verb is generally in second posi-
tion, such as in Wir haben viel vor (We’re planning to do a lot [of activities]). The
verb is vorhaben (to plan). The verb haben is in second position, and the prefix
vor- is at the end of the sentence. The same sentence expressed negatively
would look like this: Wir haben nicht viel vor (We’re not planning to do much).
 Yes/no questions and commands: The verb and subject are inverted, meaning
that the verb is first, followed by the subject, such as with Kommst du am
Sonntag vom Urlaub zurück? (Are you coming back from vacation on Sunday?).
The verb is zurückkommen (to come back). Kommst, the conjugated part of the
verb zurückkommen, is in first position in a yes/no question, and the prefix
zurück is at the end of the question.
 Sentences or questions with a modal verb (such as dürfen or möchten) in
addition to the separable-prefix verb: Conjugate the modal verb, put it (usually)
in second position, and place the separable-prefix verb in the infinitive form at
the end of the phrase, such as with Alle Gäste dürfen mitmachen (All the guests
may join in). The verb is mitmachen (to join in). The modal verb dürfen (may, to
be allowed to) is in second position, and mitmachen, the infinitive form of the
separable-prefix verb, goes to the end of the sentence. (See Chapter 9 for info on
modal verbs.)
For sentences that have more than one clause, the guidelines follow those for two-
part sentences, (see Chapter 14).
Use the verb list in Table 10-1 and the preceding guidelines to rewrite the statements,
questions, or commands in the present tense, making sure you use the correct word
order. The separable-prefix verb is in parentheses in the infinitive form. Be careful:
The verb may be in one part only.
Q. du schnell? (einschlafen)
A. Schläfst du schnell ein? (Do you go to sleep quickly?)
1. wir viele Gäste zum Fest (einladen). ________________________________________________
2. diese Firma viele Produkte im Ausland (herstellen). __________________________________
3. die besten Pläne oft (fehlschlagen). _________________________________________________
4. können Sie mir die Details? (mitteilen) ______________________________________________
Using verbs in the simple past
The simple past (also referred to as the narrative past) is used mainly by speakers in
the north and east of Germany and in the written language of the media, especially for
narrating a sequence of events in the past. (For information on how to form the
simple past, see Chapter 17.) When you use separable-prefix verbs in the simple past,
word order is just as important as with the present (and present perfect as well). The
guidelines for using the simple past are the same as those for present. Refer to the
information in the preceding section, “Using verbs in the present tense.”
153
Chapter 10: Sorting Out Separable- and Inseparable-Prefix Verbs

The following examples are the same as those in the present tense section except
they’re in the simple past. Note that the command form doesn’t exist in simple past.
Wir hatten viel vor. (We were planning/planned to do a lot [of activities].) 
Kamst du am Sonntag vom Urlaub zurück? (Did you come back from vacation on
Sunday?)
Alle Gäste durften mitmachen. (All the guests were allowed join in.)
The verbs in this exercise are all in simple past. Write the parts of the sentence in the
correct word order. For help with word order, refer to the examples and the guide-
lines for present. You can find the separable-prefix verbs in Table 10-1.
Q. ein / Helena / Kleid / an / hatte / schwarzes
A. Helena hatte ein schwarzes Kleid an. (Helena was wearing/wore a black dress.)
5. fuhr / Nach einer Pause / fort / der Redner __________________________________________
6. ab / Arbeit / Markus und Jonathan / Brachen / ihre? __________________________________
7. sahen / Im Herbst / aus / sehr / die Bäume / schön ___________________________________
8. vor / die Geschichte / Regina / las __________________________________________________
9. der Bus / los / Fuhr / Johanna / ohne ? ______________________________________________
Using verbs in present perfect tense
To make a sentence in present perfect using a separable-prefix verb, you need to
know how to form this tense and where to place the two verb parts. Word order is the
name of the game. (For more on how to form the present perfect tense and the past
participle, go to Chapter 16.)
With separable-prefix verbs in the present perfect tense in general, keep the following
points in mind:
 The past participle is at the end of the sentence. For example, the past participle
of hinfahren (to drive there, go there) is hingefahren (driven there). Here’s how
you get it:
• Split the prefix (hin-) from the main part of the verb (fahren).
• Form the past participle with ge- by squeezing the ge- into the middle of
the past participle: hin- + ge- + fahren.
 The auxiliary verb, either haben or sein, is conjugated in present tense, and it’s
generally in second position in the sentence. Exceptions are yes/no questions,
which have inverted order: The auxiliary verb is placed first, and the subject is
second.
154
Part II: Getting Started Now: Writing in the Present 

 In spoken German, you stress the prefix in the verb. For example:
Meine Schwester hat mich angerufen. (My sister called me.) The verb is
anrufen (to call, phone). The auxiliary verb hat is in second position. The
past participle is formed with an- + ge- + rufen: Ge- is squeezed in the
middle of an- and -rufen.
Der Präsident ist zurückgetreten. (The president resigned.) The verb is
zurücktreten (to step down, resign). The auxiliary verb ist is in second posi-
tion. The past participle is formed with zurück- + ge- + treten: Ge- is
squeezed in the middle of zurück- and -treten.
Ist noch jemand zugestiegen? (Has anyone gotten on [the train?]) Ticket
collectors say this to ask new passengers to show their tickets. The verb is
zusteigen (to get on, board). The auxiliary verb ist is in first position
because the sentence is a question. The past participle is formed with zu- +
ge- + stiegen: Ge- is squeezed in the middle of zu- and -stiegen.
Referring to the verb list in Table 10-1, complete the sentences using the past partici-
ple of the verb in parentheses. To get the correct form of the past participle, keep in
mind that some of these verbs are weak, and others are strong (see Chapter 16 for
more on strong versus weak verbs). Verbs that use the auxiliary verb sein have that
indicated in parentheses.
Q. Ich _________________ an diesem Projekt _________________. (mitmachen)
A. Ich habe an diesem Projekt mitgemacht. (I worked on this project.)
10. Wir _________________ viel Käse _________________. (einkaufen)
11. Das Flugzeug _________________ in Bangkok _________________. (zwischenlanden) 
(auxiliary verb sein)
12. Das Rockkonzert _________________ im Olympiastadion _________________. (stattfinden)
13. _________________ ihr das Gepäck schon _________________? (aufgeben)
14. Um wie viel Uhr_________________ der Film _________________? (anfangen)
Investigating Inseparable-Prefix Verbs
Although the number of inseparable-prefix verbs isn’t as large as that of separable-prefix
verbs, you still need to be aware of these verbs so you can include them in your writing
and speech. The good news is that many of these inseparable-prefix verbs are common
German verbs. In addition, some equivalent verbs in English have the same prefix. For
these reasons, recognizing many of these inseparable-prefix verbs is fairly simple.
The following points define inseparable-prefix verbs:
 You don’t stress the prefix in spoken German.
 The prefix alters the original meaning of the verb.
155
Chapter 10: Sorting Out Separable- and Inseparable-Prefix Verbs

 The prefix sticks with the verb stem in all tenses. For instance, consider the verb
vollenden (to finish, complete). The prefix is voll- (full), and the verb is enden
(to finish). In the third-person singular, the present tense is vollendet (finish), the
simple past is vollendete (finished), and the present perfect is hat . . . vollendet
(has finished).
 Word order in these tenses follow the same rules as verbs that have no prefix.
(See Chapters 5, 16, and 17 for details on word order in present, present perfect,
and simple past tenses.)
 The past participle doesn’t have the prefix ge-.
 The ending of the past participle may be
• Weak (formed with -t): For instance, the past participle of entdecken 
(to discover) is entdeckt (discovered).
• Strong (formed with -en): For instance, the past participle of empfehlen
(to recommend) is empfohlen (recommended).
Wer entdeckte Nordamerika? (Who discovered North America?) Entdecken 
(to discover) is an inseparable-prefix verb. Its prefix, ent- , means away from, and it
corresponds to the English prefix de- or dis-. The verb decken means to cover.
Ich verspreche dir einen Rosengarten. (I promise you a rose garden.) The verb is
versprechen (to promise).
Verfahren sich viele Touristen in der Stadt? (Do many tourists get lost in the city?)
The verb verfahren means to get lost. In yes/no questions, the verb is at the begin-
ning of the question.
Table 10-2 lists inseparable prefixes, their English meanings, and some verbs that use
the prefix. A number of the prefixes have direct comparable usages in English, and
many of the verbs are frequently used. Erkennen Sie einige Verben? (Do you recog-
nize some verbs?)

Dealing with Dual-Prefix Verbs: To Separate
or Not to Separate?
The dual-prefix verbs, the ones I call the double-crossers, are characterized by having a
prefix that can combine to make both separable-prefix verbs and inseparable-prefix
verbs. This means that with some main verbs, the prefix is separable, and with other
main verbs, the same prefix is inseparable. For example, you can use the prefix unter-
(down) to form the verb unterzeichnen (to sign [a document]), which is an inseparable-
prefix verb. You can also combine unter- with bringen (to bring) to form unterbringen
(to accommodate), a separable-prefix verb. The list of these prefixes is short. Without
the prefix, many of the verbs are high-frequency types that you may already be familiar
with.
159
Chapter 10: Sorting Out Separable- and Inseparable-Prefix Verbs

Follow these guidelines to help you remember dual-prefix verbs:
 Some dual prefixes are mainly separable, and others are mainly inseparable.
• Um- is a prefix that is mainly separable. Umziehen (to move), with the
prefix um- (around), is an example of a separable-prefix verb: Wann ziehst
du um? (When are you moving?).
• Über- is a prefix that is mainly inseparable. Übernachten (to sleep), with
the prefix über- (over, across), is an inseparable-prefix verb: Im Sommer
übernachten wir oft im Zelt (We often sleep in a tent in the summer).
 Some dual-prefix verbs are both separable and inseparable. The verb in its literal
meaning has a separable prefix, such as with Die Fähre setzt uns ans andere
Ufer über (The ferry is taking us across to the other bank [side]). Übersetzen (to
ferry across) is a separable-prefix verb. The prefix über- (over, across) is at the
end of the sentence. The literal meaning involves physical movement from one
place to another: to cross over, travel across, go across.
The verb in its figurative meaning has an inseparable prefix, such as with Sie
übersetzt sehr schnell (She translates very quickly). Übersetzen (to translate),
with the prefix über- (over, across), is an inseparable-prefix verb. The figurative
meaning involves changing over: to translate from one language to another.
Dual-prefix verbs follow the guidelines for formation, usage, and word order accord-
ing to whether the prefix is separable or inseparable. (Use the guidelines in the earlier
two sections for separable and inseparable prefix verbs.)
Table 10-3 is a list of dual prefixes and their English definitions, a sampling of dual-
prefix verbs indicating whether they’re separable- or inseparable-prefix verbs, and
the English verb equivalents. Five verb pairs have both separable (sep.) and insepara-
ble (insep.) prefixes. Notice that the last two prefixes, wider- and wieder-, have two
separate meanings and spellings.

terrible situation they’re in. Schreckliche Silke promises Leo Lügner that she’ll never leave him, but

C
Wiederholen Sie bitte ihre Telefonnummer. (widersprechen / wiederholen) (Please repeat

D
Hilfe! Das Schiff geht unter! (setzt . . . über / geht . . . unter) (Help! The ship is sinking!)
German present continuous doesn’t exist, but when you translate, it makes a lot more sense to
say the ship’s sinking, not that the ship sinks!
E
Die Firma widerruft alle defekten Produkte. (unternimmt / widerruft) (The company is recall-
ing all of the defective products.) German present continuous doesn’t exist, so when you
translate, you can use it in English for this type of sentence; if you write the company recalls 
all . . . , you’re stressing that the company issues recalls as a general fact, not that it’s happen-
ing at the moment.
F
Mein Freund hat sein altes Haus umgebaut. (hat . . . umgebaut / hat . . . umbaut) (My friend
renovated his old house.)
G
Das Auto überfuhr einen Waschbär. (durchfuhr / überfuhr) (The car ran over a raccoon.)
Great picture language here: Raccoons do wash their hands often, and they look a little bit like
a bear, don’t they?

n Chapter 11, you discover how to use reflexive verbs
to talk about the things you do to yourself. You also
add a little style to your German by using expressions to
discuss your interests, likes and dislikes, and more.
Want to add even more panache to your writing and
speech? Imagine you’re about to plant a beautiful garden
with small but fragrant pansies; sunflowers standing tall,
proudly facing the sun; and maybe a couple of cherry
tomato plants. The descriptive words for this garden are
the kinds of adjectives you find tucked into Chapter 12. 
I also ask you to look at how adjectives use case endings
to fit into a sentence. Chapter 13 is where you work out
how to make comparisons like fast, faster, fastest or good,
better, best. In Chapter 14, you discover the key role of 
connecting-words (conjunctions) such as but, and, because,
and that. Wrapping up this part is Chapter 15’s primer on
prepositions, those little guys you need to describe all
the things you can watch 6-year-old Brendan doing on the

belly, jam his face into the sand, and wipe the sand out of
his mouth.

Idiomatic language involves stringing words together into a fixed expression that’s
more than the sum of its parts. One group of fixed expressions is the vast family of
idiomatic verb expressions: combinations of verbs and other words to form a slightly
different meaning. For example, left to its own devices, the preposition um generally
means around: Wir haben einen Zaun um das ganze Haus (We have a fence around
the whole house). But in the expression Er bittet um Hilfe (He’s asking for help), the
preposition um takes on a special meaning in combination with bitten.
Idiomatic German flows easily from the mouths of native speakers, who know when
and how much to season their language with verb expressions. You can add some
flair to your German speech and writing by using one of the following major types of
idiomatic verb expressions:
 Reflexive verbs: Verbs are reflexive when you use them with reflexive pronouns,
which include words such as myself, themselves, and himself in English. Look at
the following example: Ich erinnere mich an unserem ersten Tanz (I remember
our first dance. Literally: I recall to myself at our first dance). German expresses a

great deal of actions using reflexive pronouns linked to the verb, an area in
which English makes minimal use.
 Verbs associated with certain prepositions: In this chapter, you find out about
idiomatic expressions that pair the verb with a particular preposition in either
the dative or accusative case. For instance, the preposition vor usually means in
front of; but in the example Ich habe Angst vor Schlangen (I’m afraid of snakes),
the fixed expression combines the verb haben (to have) with Angst (fear) and
the dative preposition vor.
 Verbs with separable or inseparable prefixes: A separable verb is a verb with a
prefix that detaches from the verb when it’s conjugated. The confusion comes
about because more often that not, these prefixes are nothing more than prepo-
sitions in disguise. (For more on verbs with separable and inseparable prefixes,
see Chapter 10.)
To add more factors to this equation, you find combos of combos; some
verb/preposition combos are actually separable or inseparable verb combos at
the same time. In the following verb/preposition expression, the verb ankommen
(to arrive) is a case in point because it has a separable verb prefix an-. When you
add the preposition auf (on) to the expression, the meaning changes. Look at
the example: Es kommt darauf an (It depends). The prefix an- is separated from 
-kommen, the word darauf (Literally: on it) accompanies the verb, and the sum
of its parts is no longer arrive but depend on. The preposition auf (on) in the
word darauf is a combination of da- + (r) + auf. (See Chapter 7 for more on
expressions using da-.)
In the following sections, I show you various ways of using verb combinations to talk
about yourself, others, and things. These three groups of idiomatic expressions com-
bine a verb with another word (or words), such as a reflexive pronoun or a preposi-
tion, to form expressions. 
In the Looking Glass: Reflecting 
on Reflexive Verbs
Look at yourself in the mirror and smile. What do you see (besides a stunningly beau-
tiful or handsome person)? You are, grammatically speaking, reflecting on yourself.
Reflexive verbs have a subject that carries out an action directed at itself. Typically,
the verb combines with a reflexive pronoun to describe an action. The reflexive pro-
noun refers back to the subject of the sentence, which is carrying out the action indi-
cated by the verb.
German and English both have reflexive verbs, but German uses them much more lib-
erally. To make a long story short, your German can benefit from flexing (yourself) at
the reflexive verb gym. This section helps you understand reflexive verbs and how
you can use them correctly in your writing and speech.
Self-ish concerns: Meeting the reflexive pronouns
A reflexive verb has two elements: the verb and the reflexive pronoun. In English, a
reflexive pronoun has the ending -self (myself, yourself) for singular forms and 
168
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

-selves for plural forms (ourselves, yourselves). Both English and German have two
cases of reflexive pronouns: the accusative and the dative case. The two cases are
identical in English; in German, there are only two variations between the two cases,
namely in the first- and second-person singular forms.
Table 11-1 shows the reflexive pronouns together with their translations. As a guide,
I list the corresponding nominative pronouns in the left-hand column. Notice how
frequently sich steps up to bat. Here’s the key to the abbreviations: s. = singular, 
pl. = plural, inf. = informal, and form. = formal.

On the case! Choosing the right form of reflexive pronoun
Reflexive pronouns are either in the accusative case or the dative case. The case you
use depends on how the pronoun functions in the sentence. It may be the direct object
(accusative case) or the indirect object (dative case). Case shows the relationship of
words to each other in a sentence — for instance, who’s doing what (where the reflex-
ive pronoun is in the accusative case) or who’s doing what to what/whom (where the
reflexive pronoun is in the dative case). Look at the example Ich putze mir die Zähne
(I brush my teeth). It explains who’s doing what to what, so German expresses this activ-
ity with a reflexive pronoun in dative case, mir. Die Zähne is the direct object, the
receiver of the action, and it’s in the accusative case. (See Chapter 2 for more on
cases.) Check out the examples:
Ich fühle mich viel besser. (I feel/I’m feeling much better.) Mich (myself) is the accu-
sative form of the reflexive pronoun; it’s the direct object that refers back to the sub-
ject performing the action of the verb fühlen. (The information answers the question
who’s doing what? Therefore, the reflexive pronoun is in the accusative case.)
Ich ziehe mir eine Jeans an. (I put on/I’m putting on a pair of jeans.) Mir is the
dative form of the reflexive pronoun; eine Jeans is the direct object (accusative
case) in the sentence. (The information answers the question who’s doing what
to what/whom? Therefore, the reflexive pronoun is in the dative case.)
The verbs using the dative reflexive pronoun are those in sentences that have a sepa-
rate direct object; the verbs using an accusative reflexive pronoun have no separate
direct object in the sentence.
169
Chapter 11: Sounding More Like a Native with Verb Combinations

The reflexive pronoun can also be a part of a verb + preposition expression, and cer-
tain prepositions can require either the accusative or the dative case, as with Wir
freuen uns auf den Feiertag nächste Woche (We’re happy about the holiday next
week). The preposition auf (about) requires the accusative case, as do time expres-
sions. (I talk more about verb/preposition idioms in the upcoming section “Combining
Verbs with Prepositions: Making Cool Combos”).
Placing your pronoun
Word order plays an important role in sentence construction with reflexive pronouns.
Check out the following important points to remember with word order and reflexive
pronouns:
 In a statement, the reflexive pronoun immediately follows the conjugated verb;
sich comes right after haben in this example: Die Touristen haben sich die
schöne Umgebung angesehen (The tourists looked at the beautiful surroundings).
 In a question, if the subject is a pronoun (ihr [you]), then you place the reflexive
pronoun (euch [you]) directly after it. For example, Habt ihr euch beide schon
wieder erkältet? (Have you both caught a cold again?).
 In the present tense, you push the prefix of a separable-prefix verb to the end of
the sentence. In the following example, the verb anziehen (to get dressed) is a
separable-prefix verb; the reflexive pronoun mich comes after the conjugated
verb ziehe and before the prefix an- (refer to Chapter 10): Ich ziehe mich an 
(I get/I’m getting dressed).
Identifying which verbs need to be reflexive
Many German verbs require a reflexive pronoun such as mich (myself), dich (your-
self), or uns (ourselves) in situations when you don’t use a reflexive pronoun in
English, such as with Beeilen Sie sich! (Hurry up!).
In German, you frequently find the reflexive in references to parts of the body. These
verbs often describe what you do to yourself when you’re in the bathroom. For exam-
ple, shaving (sich rasieren [to shave oneself]) is a reflexive verb. In English, you can say
that the man shaved himself or that he shaved, period. The first version is expressed
reflexively using himself. The second statement, he shaved, is just as understandable,
and it isn’t reflexive in structure. But German has only one, reflexive way of expressing
this action: Er rasiert sich (He shaves himself).
To further add to the mix, some German verbs can go either way: with or without the
reflexive pronoun. With such verbs, the reflexive format is different from the verb
without the reflexive pronoun. The next three examples show you waschen (to wash)
expressed with a reflexive pronoun in the accusative case, then in the dative case,
and finally without a reflexive pronoun:
Ich wasche mich am Abend. (I wash myself in the evening.) Mich, the reflexive
pronoun in accusative case, refers back to the subject of the sentence, ich. And
ich (I) is carrying out the action on mich (myself).
Waschbären waschen sich oft die Hände. (Raccoons often wash their hands.)
Notice that German speakers express their hands with die Hände (the hands), so if
you want to say I wash my hands in German, it looks like this: Ich wasche mir die
Hände. Mir is the dative case reflexive pronoun myself, and die Hände is the
accusative case (direct object) the hands.

Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

Christian wäscht sein Auto jeden Samstag. (Christian washes his car every
Saturday.) In both the English and the German sentences, the verb wäscht
(washes) is followed by a direct object that refers to another living being or thing. 
Table 11-2 lists some of the more common reflexive verbs, many of which have to do
with daily routine, especially personal hygiene. In German, you express the verbs on
this list with a reflexive pronoun. The helpful grammar details give you clues about
case and whether you have a separable-prefix verb.

Remember that with separable-prefix verbs, you place the prefix at the end of the sen-
tence. Make sure you pay attention to whether the reflexive pronoun is expressed in
the accusative case (for example, mich [myself]) or dative case (mir [myself]).

Combining Verbs with Prepositions
Prepositions are short, cute words that can have a great influence on other parts of a
sentence. Some German cuties and their English counterparts look similar at times: in
(in), an (on), or für (for).
Having said that, however, I need to add that they can be sly little creatures that
change their tune when they hook up with different verbs, changing the verb’s mean-
ing. No matter how you cut the cake, certain prepositions that work together with cer-
tain verbs make for powerful, effective means of expression in German and English.
You may refer to them as idioms, idiomatic expressions, or the bare bones term:
verb/preposition combos. I prefer the latter. When you want to sound like your mother
tongue is German, you need to acquire as many of these combos as you can fit in your
repertoire. (To find out about dative and accusative terminology, go to Chapter 2.)
Verb/preposition combinations are more than the sum of their parts. Why? These
prepositions are slick: When combined with a verb to form a fixed expression, they
can alter the meaning of the verb they appear with. That’s why mastering the
verb/preposition combos as a unit is important. You can’t predict which preposition
partners with which verb, and you can’t know ahead what the whole shebang means,
even if you know the meaning of the verb alone, without a preposition.
Table 11-3 lists some of the most frequently used German prepositions that change their
meaning in combination with a verb. Notice that the English equivalents aren’t always
the same as in the expression. The third column gives an example of a verb/preposition
combo, and the fourth column shows an example sentence with its English translation.
For the prepositions that can be both accusative and dative, I give only one example sen-
tence. As you look through the example sentences and their English equivalents, notice
that the preposition generally changes its original meaning. Look at the key to under-
stand the abbreviations used in the table: acc. = accusative, dat. = dative.

German prepositions all use case to indicate the relationship they have to other parts
of the sentence, namely the object of the preposition. Some of the prepositions use
the accusative case; others use the dative case. Another group, the switch hitters,
can work in the accusative or dative case. (This is true of some other prepositions as
well, including those that don’t partner with verbs to form idiomatic expressions.)
The following sections delve deeper into these three situations to help you under-
stand the differences. (Check out Chapter 15 for more information on prepositions.)

ID-ing common combos in the accusative case
In this section, I show you an important group of verb/preposition combos you can use
to add real German sparkle to your written and spoken language. Verbs that combine
with prepositions using the accusative case make up this useful group. These common
verb/preposition combos are fixed expressions for which you need to remember which
preposition partners with which verb, which case the preposition takes (accusative for
this list), and what the expression means.
Table 11-4 lists the commonly used verb/preposition combos with prepositions in the
accusative case. Used alone, these prepositions may be switch hitters, the kind that
can work in both the accusative and dative case, but in combination with these verbs,
they go to up to bat as accusatives. The expressions are listed alphabetically by verb.

Eyeing common combos in the dative case
Verbs that combine with prepositions using the dative case are a commonly used
group of verb/preposition combos. When you’re able to plunk these expressions into
your written and spoken German, you’re well on the way to sounding like you’re origi-
nally from a German-speaking country. These frequently used combos are fixed expres-
sions for which you need to remember which preposition combines with which verb,
which case the preposition takes (dative for this list), and what the expression means.
Table 11-5 lists some commonly used expressions with prepositions in the dative
case. Used alone, these prepositions may be accusative or dative, but in these expres-
sions, they require the dative. I list the expressions alphabetically by verb.

Adding Adjectives for Description
In This Chapter
 Categorizing adjectives for easy reference
 Forming adjectives with endings
 Using possessive adjectives
A
djectives add spice, distinctive flavor, and creativity to a sentence. They dress up
nouns for a vigorous winter workout in Arlberg. What’s in it for you? Why not be
content with the basics? Cross out vigorous from vigorous winter workout, and you still
get the picture. But the listener doesn’t perk up and become involved. Adjectives add
depth and character to the power of a noun. Besides, they’re interessant (interesting),
lustig (funny), unglaublich (incredible), ruhig (quiet), and praktisch (practical).
I have good news and not-so-good news. First the good news: There are a large number
of cognates among German adjectives. In the first paragraph, you probably recognize
interessant, and you may get the meaning of praktisch if you know that the ending -isch
often stands in for English adjective endings like -ic and -ical. The not-so-good news is
that you have to address grammar — gender, number, and case — when handling adjec-
tives. Depending on where you place the adjective in the sentence, you may or may not
need to put the adjective in synch with the noun it modifies. How? By adding the appro-
priate endings to indicate agreement with the noun.
Keine Sorge. (Not to worry.) This chapter explains how to categorize types of adjec-
tives in German for easy reference, form case endings of adjectives, and use posses-
sive adjectives. You discover how to wade through these adjective pitfalls so you can
comfortably and safely use them in your writing and speech.
Organizing Adjectives: Opposites, 
Cognates, and Collocations
Adjectives are so numerous that it’s essential to find a system for categorizing them
as a means of easy reference. When you encounter a new adjective, try to find a hook
to hang it on. You may be able to group them three different ways:
 Opposites: Some adjective types lend themselves to pairing up with an adjective
of the opposite meaning.
 Cognates: Cognates, which are similar words in English and German, are instantly
recognizable; after you check that the meaning is the same in both languages, you
only need to know how to form their endings in sentences.

 Collocations: Collocations are semi-fixed, frequently used word combinations, so
look for adjective + noun phrases.
Get into the habit of recognizing collocations that adjectives occur in. It takes a
bit more work than figuring out what an adjective alone means, but in the end, it
saves time. Add them to your range of expression, and you’re on the path to suc-
cessful, idiomatic German.
This section helps you place adjectives in these three different groupings. By doing
so, you can more easily remember these descriptors, and then you can use them
when you want to discuss appearance, personal traits, weather, and more.
Letting opposites attract
You can master many groups of descriptive adjectives as opposite pairs. Two
common groups I deal with in this section are the adjectives that describe people’s
appearance and personal traits and adjectives that describe the weather.
Describing appearance and personal traits
When you want to say what people are like, you use descriptive adjectives to
describe them; for example, sie ist groß (she’s tall) or er ist freundlich (he’s friendly).
In Table 12-1, you see such adjectives grouped as opposites; looking at them this way
saves you time when you’re remembering them.

Refer to Table 12-1 and match the adjective with its opposite. The adjectives describe
appearance and personal traits of Paula and Philip, twins who couldn’t be more oppo-
site from one another.
Q. Philip ist zuverlässig, aber Paula ist _________________.
A. Philip ist zuverlässig, aber Paula ist unzuverlässig. (Philip is reliable, but Paula is 
unreliable.) Notice that German also uses the prefix un- to mean not.
1. Paula ist klein, aber Philip ist _________________.
2. Paula ist attraktiv, aber Philip ist _________________.
3. Philip ist sympathisch, aber Paula ist _________________.
4. Philip ist stark, aber Paula ist _________________.
5. Paula ist sportlich, aber Philip ist _________________.
6. Philip ist laut, aber Paula ist _________________.
Describing the weather
No matter where you are, talking about das Wetter (the weather) is the perfect ice-
breaker. It also provides you with ammunition to make your friends jealous when
you’re writing them Ansichtskarten (postcards) while you’re im Urlaub (on vacation).
Look at the weather vocabulary in Table 12-2. Great news: Most of the adjectives have
near opposites, so it’s economical to remember them in pairs.

You’re on vacation. Finish the postcard, describing the weather and someone you met
there. Fill in the blanks using some adjectives describing weather and people. Note:
The first word in a letter isn’t capitalized unless it’s a noun.

A family resemblance: Describing with cognates
Although German does have some incredibly foreign sounding words, the number of
cognates is surprisingly large. You can put them in several categories for easy access.
Some example categories are based on the adjective’s ending. See Table 12-3.

Traveling companions: Describing 
with collocations
Acquiring word chunks is far more economical than studying isolated words.
Collocations are chunks of words that are very predictable, some so predictable that
they nearly always stick together. By some definitions, collocations include idioms
and other fixed expressions. Collocations are made up of all kinds of word combina-
tions: adjective + noun, noun + noun, adverb + adjective, and so on. In this section,
I deal with adjective combos.
Some collocations translate well: Starke Nerven is the same as strong nerves. Other
expressions aren’t as close: Das ist ein starkes Stück in literal English means that’s a
strong piece. Yet in German, it’s like saying that’s a bit too much, as in that’s over the
top. Take a look at some example collocations:
183
Chapter 12: Adding Adjectives for Description

Unsere Produkte werden nur in umweltfreundlichen Verpackungen verkauft.
(Our products are sold only in environmentally friendly packaging.) The collocation
is the combination of umweltfreundlich(en) + Verpackung(en) (environmentally
friendly + packaging). Notice the fixed combination environmentally friendly is an
adverb + adjective in English; in German, it’s a noun + adjective: die Umwelt (the
environment) + freundlich (friendly).
Ich ärgere mich grün und blau. (I’m hopping mad. Literally, it’s something like,
I’m annoyed green and blue.) You can also describe this expression as an idiom.
Whatever the terminology, if you were to ask a German speaker to finish the sen-
tence ich ärgere mich . . . und . . ., he wouldn’t hesitate to add the right colors.
Use only German collocations you’re sure about using correctly. Although you know a
collocation in English, it may very well translate into German as nonsense. For exam-
ple, take the German adjective stark. Put the English collocation stark raving mad into
German word-for-word, and you get gibberish. Why? The whole three-word chunk is
the German collocation total verrückt (totally crazy). When you know that stark
means strong in German, not harsh as in English, you’re halfway on the road to using it
correctly.
Read and listen actively to German. Make it your goal to recognize chunks of lan-
guage, not only single words. Knowing a stack of collocations with adjectives offers
you great opportunities for expressing yourself clearly and succinctly.
Brighten up your language with colorful collocations. Look at the expressions using
colors. Match the English equivalents and write them next to the German expression.
Q. Sie treffen ins Schwarze.
A. They hit the bull’s eye.
They hit the bull’s eye.
They’re drunk.
They’re working illegally,
not paying taxes.
They’re not at work/school,

Helping Adjectives Meet a Satisfying End
Expanding your adjective arsenal is the first step; knowing how to form and use adjec-
tives correctly in a sentence is the goal for any intermediate language learner. This
section entails deciding whether the adjectives need endings and, if so, how to form
these endings.
English uses adjectives as is, straight up, no changes needed to plunk them into a combi-
nation with a noun. German is quite different. Before a German adjective can sidle up to
a noun, it quite often needs an ending that reflects the gender and case of the noun it
modifies. As in English, a German adjective usually comes right before the noun it
describes: meine schwarze Handschuhe (my black gloves).
However, not all adjectives in all sentences need special attention as far as necessary
ending changes are concerned. An adjective has no ending when it follows the verbs
sein (to be), werden (to become), or bleiben (to remain) and modifies the subject.
See the two examples:
Das Wetter bleibt warm. (The weather remains warm.)
Die Berge in Bayern sind wunderschön. (The mountains in Bavaria are gorgeous.)
Work at recognizing the case and gender of nouns in the sentence and knowing how
to add the correct endings. In this section, you need to know the difference between
endings when an adjective stands alone in front of the noun — for example, frisches
Obst (fresh fruit) — and when an adjective has a word such as der, ein, or dieser at
the beginning of the phrase — for example, das frische Obst (the fresh fruit).
Forming endings on adjectives not 
preceded by der- or ein- words
When you describe something in general such as food prices, you simply say something
like fresh pineapples are expensive. You don’t need to add the, those, or our. It’s the same
in German, except you have the added factor of case endings for adjectives. In other
words, when you say frische Ananas sind teuer (fresh pineapples are expensive), you
need to know that the ending for frisch is -e. Note: In phrases that do have an article or
modifier like the, those, or our (as in those fresh pineapples), the adjective endings are
different. Check out the following section, “Preceded adjectives: Forming the endings,”
for details.
This section deals with endings for an adjective that modifies and precedes a noun,
but the adjective isn’t preceded by an article (such as der/die/das or ein/eine) or
other modifiers (der- words, such as dieser and solcher, and ein- words, such as
mein and kein). 
Here are the characteristics that define adjectives without der- or ein- words preced-
ing them:
 Because no article or other modifier precedes the noun, the adjective must indi-
cate gender and case of the noun; it has a double duty of adjective and article.
 These adjectives have mostly the same endings as der- words, with the excep-
tion of the masculine and neuter genitive, where the ending is -en.
185
Chapter 12: Adding Adjectives for Description

To form these adjective endings, you need to know the gender, case, and number of
the noun that the adjective modifies. For example, take the adjective gut (good). In
order to say guter Käse ist teuer (good cheese is expensive), you need to know that
Käse is masculine singular (der Käse) and that in this sentence, it’s in the nominative
case (subject). You add that nominative masculine ending -er onto gut, so you have
gut + -er = guter Käse.
The four adjectives in Table 12-4 deal with food: gut (good), schmackhaft (tasty), lecker
(delicious, mouth-watering, scrumptious), and köstlich (delicious, luscious, exquisite).
The endings that agree in case, number, and gender with the noun they modify are in
bold. For easy reference, I also list the adjective ending separately in bold with each
example. Add these endings to adjectives that are not preceded by der- or ein- words.

Check out some examples:
Leckeres Brot findet man überall in deutschen Bäckereien. (You can find deli-
cious bread everywhere in German bakeries.) The adjective lecker + -es (delicious)
describes the noun (das) Brot (bread); leckeres Brot is in the accusative case
because it’s the direct object. The neuter singular accusative ending for
unpreceded adjectives is -es.
Es gibt köstliche Kuchen in österreichischen Cafés. (There are luscious cakes in
Austrian cafés.) The adjective köstlich + -e describes the noun (der) Kuchen, in
plural form. Köstliche Kuchen is in the accusative case because it’s the direct
object. The plural accusative ending for unpreceded adjectives is -e.
Add the correct ending to the adjectives in parentheses. Write the adjective in the
space provided. Use Table 12-4 for reference.
Q. Im Winter trinken wir gern _________________ Tee. (heiß)
A. Im Winter trinken wir gern heißen Tee. (We like to drink hot tea in the winter.) Tee is 
masculine. Heißen Tee is in accusative case; it’s the direct object of the sentence.

24. Ich trinke auch gern _________________ Getränke. (alkoholfrei) 
25. Mögen Sie _________________ Wein? (deutsch) 
26. Ja, _________________ Weißweine gefallen mir. (trocken) 
Preceded adjectives: Forming the endings
When you want to be specific about something, you use articles and modifiers like
the, those, or a to say something like the modern painting, those violent movies, or a
fantastic restaurant. In English, you simply add the adjective of your choice, and
you’re all set. Not so in German. Both the article/modifier and the adjective need to
reflect the gender, number, and case of the noun they modify.
This section deals with endings for an adjective that modifies and precedes a noun
that’s preceded by an article (such as der/die/das or ein/eine) or other modifiers 
(der- words such as dieser and solcher, and ein- words such as mein and kein). (See
Chapters 1 and 2 for information on articles and der- and ein- words.) Preceded adjec-
tives appear in phrases with an article or other modifier, an adjective, and a noun.
Take the example ein lockeres Hemd ist bequem (a loose shirt is comfortable). Hemd
is singular, neuter, and in the nominative case because it’s the subject of the sentence,
so the article ein and the adjective lockeres reflect the neuter gender, number, and
case of Hemd. Check out Table 12-5.

You’re on vacation on the island of Rügen, in der Ostsee (Rügen, in the Baltic Sea).
Write a letter describing some activities you’re doing there. Fill in the blanks using the
adjectives in parentheses. Look at Table 12-4 for the adjective endings needed. Note:
The first word in a letter isn’t capitalized unless it’s a noun.
Q. Die Insel Rügen hat eine _________________ (herrlich) Küste. 
A. Die Insel Rügen hat eine herrliche Küste. (The island of Rügen has a wonderful coastline.)
Eine herrliche Küste is singular accusative; it’s the object of the sentence. Eine is the hint
that Küste is feminine; you indicate the agreement with -e tacked onto herrlich.
Using Possessive Adjectives: 
My Place or Your Place?
Possessive adjectives are the words describing ownership, possession, or relationship,
such as my, your, his, her, and so on. They’re also referred to as possessive pronouns.
(That’s because technically speaking, a possessive adjective is a pronoun that’s used
as an adjective to show who “owns” the noun following it.) Identifying possessive
adjectives is easy because they’re grouped together with the ein- words (they have
the same endings, even if they don’t rhyme with ein). The ein- words include ein,
kein, and all the possessive adjectives.

The singular possessive adjectives are mein (my), dein (your), sein (his), ihr (her),
and sein (its). The plural possessive adjectives are unser (our), euer (your), ihr
(their), and Ihr (your — formal, singular and plural).
Table 12-6 shows possessive adjective endings in all cases and genders. This is the
same pattern for ein- and kein- in Table 12-5. The following table shows mein and

Getränke is plural, and it’s a direct object, so it’s in the accusative case. The adjective takes
the plural accusative ending -e.

Mögen Sie deutschen Wein? (Do you like German wine?) Wein is masculine, and it’s a direct
object, so it’s in the accusative case. The adjective takes the masculine accusative ending -en.

Ja, trockene Weißweine gefallen mir. (Yes, I like dry white wines.) Weißweine is plural, and it’s
the subject, so it’s in the nominative case. The adjective takes the plural nominative ending -e.

Hi Margit and Thomas,
What are you doing with the little children at home? Here on the island of 
Rügen, there aren’t any exotic flowers, but yesterday we saw the spectacular
white cliffs. Do you know the paintings by the famous painter Caspar David 
Friedrich? He often painted this wonderful landscape. We’re enjoying the 
healthy air, and tomorrow we’re going on a long walk near Binz. This evening 
we’re having dinner with an interesting couple from eastern Germany. They 
say this beautiful island is where they’ve been spending their vacations for 
many years. On Thursday we’re going to a small island with a funny name — 
Hiddensee. There’s a long beach there and a nice lighthouse.
See you soon, Liesl and Hansi

Chapter 13
Comparing with Adjectives
and Adverbs
In This Chapter
 Understanding regular adjective and adverb comparative forms
 Grasping irregular adjective and adverb comparative forms
 Comparing equals/unequals
You may be wondering why I mix adjectives and adverbs in the same chapter,
especially after Chapter 12 deals with adjectives. I have some very good reasons.
Both have the power to make comparisons. What’s even better is that German adjec-
tives and adverbs are one and the same word in most cases. Take, for instance, the
adjective good and its adverbial counterpart well. The German equivalents are exactly
the same for both adjective and adverb: gut. Best of all, using comparative and
superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs offers great opportunities for making
your language more precise, more useful, and more interesting.
In this chapter, you make comparisons using adjectives and adverbs — for example,
freundlich, freundlicher, am freundlichsten (friendly, friendlier, friendliest). Many
adjectives and adverbs follow a regular pattern for making words of comparison. Some
forms are irregular; they need more attention to master. Grammar comes into play with
comparative adjectives that precede a noun. (See Chapter 12 for preceded adjectives.)
Some types of adjectives and adverbs have a unique grammatical structure; I explain
these word groups in this chapter. These groups include adjectives that omit the noun,
participles (verb forms like loving or loved) that function as adjectives or adverbs, and
adverbs that modify adjectives. The last section in this chapter deals with comparing
equals/unequals — for example, (nicht) so teuer wie ([not] as expensive as).
Comparing Regular Adjectives and Adverbs:
Fast, Faster, Fastest
Adjectives modify or describe nouns; adverbs modify or describe verbs, other
adverbs, or adjectives. (The verb sein [to be] is an exception: Adverbs can’t modify
the verb sein.) When you’re using comparative and superlative forms, German makes
adjectives and adverbs in similar ways. Comparative means that you compare two
objects, people, activities, ideas, and so on (for example, longer is the comparative
form of long); superlative means that you compare three or more objects, people,
activities, ideas, and so on (longest is the superlative form).

Forming the comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs from the
basic form isn’t difficult when you see the similarities to English. The endings that
vary from the most-frequent pattern mostly have to do with facilitating pronuncia-
tion. The following guidelines show how to add -er and -(e)st endings as well as the
endings for adjectives that come before nouns (see Chapter 12 for details on adjective
agreement).
Comparing two things
For both adjectives and adverbs, when you want to compare two things, people, and
so on, take the base form (the adjective or adverb as you see it in the dictionary) and
form the comparative by adding -er to the base form — for instance, witzig →witziger
(witty →wittier). To express than in a comparison, the German equivalent is als.
Mein Onkel Richard ist nett, aber meine Tante Christel ist netter als Onkel
Richard. (My uncle Richard is nice, but my aunt Christel is nicer than uncle Richard.)
The adjective nett is the base form; netter als (nicer than) is the comparative form.
Onkel Richard fährt schnell, aber Tante Christel fährt schneller als Onkel
Richard. (Uncle Richard drives fast, but aunt Christel drives faster than uncle
Richard.) The adverb schnell is the base form; schneller als (faster than) is the
comparative form. Note: Schnell is both an adjective and an adverb, just as fast is
in English.
Adjectives ending in -el and -er leave the last -e off the base form and then add -er
to make the comparative: dunkel →dunkler (dark →darker), teuer →teurer
(expensive →more expensive).
When you want to use a comparative adjective that precedes the noun, you follow the
same guidelines as with other adjectives that precede the noun. Look at the following
examples to show you three different scenarios for preceded adjective endings:
Du hast ein neueres Auto als ich. (You have a newer car than I do.) The direct
object, ein neueres Auto, is in accusative case, and it’s singular. The indefinite arti-
cle ein (a) has no ending in accusative singular case: It’s neuter to reflect the neuter
noun (das) Auto. The base form of the adjective neu (new) has the comparative
ending -er + the neuter, singular ending -es to form neueres (neu + -er + -es).
Ich habe den kleineren Wagen. (I have the smaller car.) The direct object, den
kleineren Wagen, is in accusative case, and it’s singular. The definite article den
(the) has the accusative masculine ending: It’s masculine to reflect the masculine
noun (der) Wagen. The base form of the adjective klein (small) has the compara-
tive ending -er + the masculine, singular, accusative ending -en to form kleineren
(klein + -er + -en).
Köstlicheres Brot ist kaum zu finden. (It’s hard to find more delicious bread.) The
subject of the sentence, köstlicheres Brot, is in nominative case, and it’s singular.
The base form of the adjective köstlich (delicious) has the comparative ending -er
+ the neuter, singular ending -es to reflect the neuter noun (das) Brot. The compar-
ative köstlicheres is formed like this: köstlich + -er + -es = köstlicheres.
194
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

German doesn’t use mehr (more) together with the -er ending. In English, the compar-
ative adjective form can look like this: more intelligent or more interesting. German
uses only the -er ending: intelligenter or interessanter.
Absolutely the most! Discussing superlatives
The superlative form for adverbs as well as for adjectives that follow a noun in a sen-
tence is the following: am + adjective/adverb + -sten:
Dieser Supermarkt ist am billigsten. (This supermarket is the cheapest/most inexpen-
sive.) Billig is the base form of the adjective, and am billigsten is the superlative.
Tante Gisela kocht am besten. (Aunt Gisela cooks the best.) Gut is the base form
of the adverb; am besten is the superlative form.
A superlative adjective often precedes the noun it modifies, which means it needs
to reflect the noun’s gender, number, and case. You get the superlative form of such
adjectives by adding -st to the base form and then adding the adjective ending (see
Chapter 12): höflich →höflichst- + adjective ending (polite →most polite).
Manuela ist die höflichste Kollegin im Büro. (Manuela is the most polite colleague
in the office.) Höflich is the base form of the adjective; die höflichst- + -e (Kollegin)
is feminine, singular, nominative case.
Onkel Kalle hat das schönste Haus. (Uncle Kalle has the nicest house.) Schön is
the base form of the adjective; das schönst- + -e (Haus) is the superlative form
that reflects the neuter, singular accusative noun das Haus. Note: Here’s the alter-
native form, which uses an adjective that follows the noun: Sein Haus ist am
schönsten (His house is the nicest).
You make the superlative form for adjectives ending in -t or -z (and a few others) by
adding -e + -st = -est for ease of pronunciation: elegantest- (most elegant). For exam-
ple, Du findest die elegantesten Schuhe bei Salamander (You find the most elegant
shoes at Salamander [a well-known shoe store]). Elegant is the base form of the adjec-
tive; die elegant- + est- + -en is the superlative form that reflects the accusative plural
noun Schuhe.
Considering common comparisons
Table 13-1 contains a list of some adjectives and adverbs that are frequently used for
making comparisons of people and things. The fourth column shows any differences
in spelling, as in nett →netter →am nettesten, where you add the -e in front of -st.
The superlative form for all words is shown at first as am + (e)sten. You use this form
when the adjective follows the noun and for adverbs. The form shown in parentheses
is the form that you use when a superlative adjective precedes the noun. You add
the adjective endings to this form. Remember: All adjectives that precede the noun
take adjective endings that reflect the noun’s gender, number, and case.

When making a sentence, remember to add the appropriate endings to adjectives
of comparison when needed. Adjectives following a noun don’t need to reflect the
gender, number, and case of the noun, but adjectives that precede the noun do need
agreement. (See Chapter 12 for more on adjectives.)
Complete the sentences using the comparative or superlative form of the word in
parentheses. The context of the sentence gives clues as to whether you need the
comparative or superlative form. Then translate the sentences into English.

Chapter 13: Comparing with Adjectives and Adverbs

Adding the umlaut in regular comparisons
German wouldn’t be the same without its three interesting-looking letters that have
umlauts (not to mention that cool ess-tset, the letter ß). When forming the compara-
tive and superlative forms of some adjectives and adverbs, be careful to add the
umlaut when you need it.
The general guideline for adding umlauts in comparisons is simple to remember:
 Many adjectives and adverbs with one syllable and with an -a, -o, or -u in the base
form add an umlaut in the comparative and superlative forms: alt →älter →
ältest- (old →older →oldest).
 Some common one-syllable words with an -a, -o or -u in the base form don’t have
an umlaut: blond (blond[e]), bunt (colorful), falsch (wrong), froh (glad), klar
(clear), toll (amazing, great), wahr (true), and laut (loud, noisy). Note: Laut has 
-au in the base form, unlike the others in this list. I include it here because it
doesn’t add an umlaut in the comparative and superlative forms.
Herr Diefenbacher ist alt, aber Frau Kolbe ist noch älter. (Herr Diefenbacher is
old, but Frau Kolbe is even older.) The adjective alt (base form) changes to älter,
with an umlaut in the comparative form.
Die ärmsten Länder brauchen sehr viel Unterstützung. (The poorest countries
need a lot of aid.) The adjective ärmsten is the superlative form; die ärmsten
Länder is the subject (nominative case), and it’s plural. Ärmsten precedes the
noun, so it needs the adjective ending to reflect Länder. You form it like this: arm-
(base form) changes to ärm- (add the umlaut) + -est (superlative ending) + en
(nominative plural ending).
Complete the following with the forms of the adjectives and adverbs that are missing.
Remember to include the umlaut and -e with -st if needed. Some exercises have all
three words missing; these are cognates.

Using Irregular Comparison Forms
German has some wayward characters among adjectives and adverbs, but luckily, a
few of these irregular types have parallels to English odd ducks. The classic example is
gut →besser →am besten, which is easily recognizable in English as good →better →
best. These words are high frequency, and there are only a small number of them, so
getting them into your active vocabulary should be a snap. All you need to do is mem-
orize this list of commonly used irregular comparison forms. Look at Table 13-2 for the
list of irregular adjectives and adverbs.

The use of gern (the base form of the word meaning to like, enjoy [doing something])
is easiest to remember in the context of some common expressions:
 Ich spiele gern Klavier/Ich tanze gern/Ich esse gern Fisch. (I like to play the
piano/I like to dance/I like to eat fish.) You use this construction to express that
you like an activity, sport, game, food, and so on. Also: Ich spiele lieber
Tennis/ich trinke am liebsten Wasser. (I prefer playing tennis/I like drinking
water most of all.) The base form of these sentences are Ich spiele gern Tennis
and Ich trinke gern Wasser (I like to play tennis and I like to drink water).
 Ich möchte gern wissen, ob . . . (I wonder if . . . )
 Was möchtest du lieber . . . ? (Which would you rather . . . ?)
 Am liebsten möchte ich . . . (Most of all, I’d like to . . .) Use this expression to talk
about an activity/food/place that you like or would like to do/eat/go to/and so on.
These exercises are grouped in three sentences with the base form, comparative
form, and the superlative form. Complete the three unfinished sentences in each exer-
cise using the irregular comparison forms in Table 13-2. The question heading each

Comparing Equals and Nonequals
When you were a kid, you probably boasted about yourself, saying that you were better
than the rest. After you grow up, you have to consider a lot more factors. You may want
to sound more diplomatic and leave the boasting to the playground mentality. Using the
expressions in this section, you can sound smooth enough to impress almost anyone.
Use the following structures for expressing equality and inequality of items, places,
people, what have you. They do wonders for increasing your range of expression.
Table 13-3 shows the list of commonly used expressions that describe equality or
inequality between things, people, or ideas. The example sentences show how these
expressions fit into sentences. Notice the word order of the information in each exam-
ple sentence; with the exception of je . . . desto (the . . . -er, the . . . -er), you use the
same word order in German and English to make comparisons using these expres-
sions. The adjective or adverb that you’re using as a comparison is in the middle of
the two parts of the expression. For example, if you use the adverb schnell (fast) to
say just as fast as . . . , you say genauso schnell wie . . . in German.

Identifying Unique Adjective 
and Adverb Groups
The structure and usage of some adjectives and adverbs is unique. These types
include adjectives that are used as nouns, participles used as adjectives or adverbs,
and adverbs that modify adjectives. Most are fairly easy to remember because they
have parallel meanings and structures in English.
You need to know these groups because they’re high frequency words and expressions
that you come across in everyday language, and they help you express yourself more
clearly. They’re easy to remember if you understand how to use these structures in
sentences. This section includes the following three unique groups:
 Naturally, adjectives used as nouns are the type that stand in for the noun; they
omit the noun — for example, das Richtige (the right thing/decision/choice).
 The second group includes participles that function as adjectives or adverbs,
such as am motiviertesten (the most motivated). The present participle of
motivieren (to motivate) is motivierend (motivating), and the past participle
of is motiviert (motivated). 
 The third group I deal with in this section is made up of adverbs that modify
adjectives. The combination serves to make the adjective more descriptive; for
example, in the expression wirklich interessant, you use the word wirklich
(really, absolutely) to modify interessant (interesting).
Adjectives that act as nouns
Sometimes adjectives replace a noun to represent an abstract idea, a person, an
object, and so on. The noun that the adjective replaces may be singular or plural, and
it may be the subject or the object of a sentence; in short, it functions the same as a
noun. The same structure exists in English and German for adjectives that take over
as nouns; for example, the poor, the brave, the lonely one, the new ones. The only dif-
ference is that in German, nouns are capitalized and the spelling reflects gender,
number, and case. In addition, there’s no equivalent for one/ones in English; the
German adjective stands alone to represent the noun.
To understand how such adjectives work, imagine you’re discussing with your friend
which cat you want to take home from the animal shelter. You talk about die Große,
die Braune, and die Ruhige (the little one, the brown one, the quiet one). You’re
replacing the word Katze (cat) by describing a characteristic of each cat and using
that adjective to represent that cat. You use the feminine article die because Katze is
a feminine noun. If you’re talking about taking home a dog, der Hund, you refer to
each one as der Große, der Braune, and der Ruhige. When you make your decision,
you may say something like Ich nehme den Braunen (I’ll take the brown one [dog]).
The adjective has the accusative masculine singular case ending -en to reflect the
noun it’s replacing.
202
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that adjectives like das Gute (the good thing) are in
the superlative. Adjectives that describe something abstract are neuter nouns; das
signifies the neuter noun in this case, not the superlative form. (See the earlier sec-
tion “Comparing Regular Adjectives and Adverbs: Fast, Faster, Fastest” for more on
superlatives.) Compare the following sentences:
Ich wünsche euch das Beste. (I wish you the best.) This has a superlative meaning,
but das Beste is a noun. By contrast, die beste Idee (the best idea) is a combina-
tion of the superlative adjective die beste and the noun Idee.
Kennst du die Kleine da drüben? (Do you know the small [woman] over there?)
The article die combines with Kleine to stand in for the noun woman (die Frau).
Note: Die Kleine doesn’t necessarily have to refer to a small woman. However, if it’s
used to refer to a woman, it’s colloquial, a bit like saying that babe.
Participles that function as adjectives or adverbs
In German, as in English, present and past participles can function as adjectives or
adverbs. If the adjectives precede a noun, they agree in gender, number, and case
with the noun they modify. A present participle is the infinitive (for instance, fly,
tumble, or seethe) with the ending -ing. When you use it in English as an adjective, 
you combine it with the noun you want to modify; for example, the flying squirrels, 
the tumbling acrobats, or the seething volcano.
To create the present participle in German, start with a verb, such as laufen (to run).
Verbs form the present participle by dropping the infinitive ending -en and adding 
-end to the infinitive form (lauf- + -end = laufend). The present participle of laufen
is laufend (the closest thing to the English word running). Look at an example:
Er erzählte Witze am laufenden Band. (He told an endless stream of jokes.
Literally: He told jokes on a running band/belt.)
A past participle of a regular verb is the infinitive of a verb with -ed or -d added. For an
irregular verb, it’s the form such as eaten, hidden, or seen that you use to form the
present perfect tense and other compound verb tenses. (An example of the present
perfect tense is Scruffy has already eaten, where you combine the past participle eaten
with the auxiliary verb have.) You can use the past participle as a descriptive word;
for example, the drenched cat, sunken treasure, or forbidden fruit.
Verbs form past participles differently, depending on the verb type (see Chapter 16);
for instance, the past participle of pflegen is gepflegt (groomed, taken care of). The
phrases gepflegtes Essen (first-rate food) and gepflegte Weine (quality wines) are typi-
cal descriptions that restaurants use to impress their clientele. Literally speaking,
these expressions mean groomed food/wines in the sense that the restaurant has a
carefully selected menu or wine list.
Some German verbs, namely the verbs ending in -ieren, have the same meanings in
English, making them easily recognizable. The past participle form of these verbs is
formed with -iert at the end; the ending is the same, regardless of whether you’re
using the past participle as an adjective or adverb.

Chapter 13: Comparing with Adjectives and Adverbs

Many of these common adjectives have comparative and superlative forms: Some
common adjectives with this structure are dekoriert (decorated), diszipliniert (disci-
plined), fasziniert (fascinated), frustriert (dissastisfied, frustrated), interessiert (inter-
ested), motiviert (motivated), organisiert (organized), and talentiert (talented). They
can all form comparative and superlative adjectives (and possibly adverbs):
Der Gefreite Schwarz war der disziplinierteste Soldat in seiner Kompanie.
(Private Schwarz was the most disciplined soldier in his company.) Diszipliniertest-
is a superlative adjective.
In der Schule war ich motivierter als meine Schwester. (I was more motivated
than my sister when I was in school.) Motivierter is a comparative adjective.
Wir schauten die Olympische Spiele fasziniert zu. (We watched the Olympic
Games with fascination.) Fasziniert is an adverb describing how (we) watched. 
Some frequently used adjectives derived from past participles don’t have compara-
tive forms. Among the more common are ausprobiert (tested), diskutiert (discussed),
fotografiert (photographed), and probiert (tried/tested). See the earlier section titled
“Comparing Regular Adjectives and Adverbs: Fast, Faster, Fastest” for more on
comparatives.
Adverbs that modify adjectives
Adverbs modify verbs, but they can also modify adjectives. In order to express that
something or someone is quite good, especially interesting, or really motivated, you use
adverbs to modify the adjective. Those adverbs frequently used in German are beson-
ders (especially), etwas (somewhat), relativ (relatively), sehr (very), viel (much, a lot),
wirklich (absolutely, really), and ziemlich (quite). Good news here is that they don’t
have any changes in the endings.
To use an adverb to modify an adjective, just place the adverb in front of the adjec-
tive it’s modifying, and voilà! To show you how this works, imagine you’re talking
about the hotels you stayed at on your last trip to Europe. One hotel was especially
luxurious. To express this in German, you place the adverb wirklich (really) in front
of luxuriös (luxurious), and if the adjective precedes the noun that it modifies, add
the appropriate adjective ending; for example, Wir haben zwei Nächte in einem
wirklich luxuriösen Hotel übernachtet (We spent two nights in a really luxurious
hotel). Check out these examples:
Der Sommer war etwas wärmer als in vergangenen Jahren. (The summer was
somewhat warmer than in previous years.) The adverb etwas modifies the adjec-
tive wärmer, which is in the comparative form. The adjective wärmer needs no
ending because it doesn’t precede the noun that it modifies, der Sommer.
Letztes Jahr hatten wir einen ziemlich langen Winter. (Last year we had quite a
long winter.) The adverb ziemlich modifies the adjective lang: einen ziemlich
langen. Winter is the direct object of the sentence, so the other modifiers — einen
and langen — have masculine, singular, accusative endings to reflect (der) Winter.

Connecting with Conjunctions
In This Chapter
 Clarifying terminology of conjunctions and clauses
 Making sentences with coordinating conjunctions
 Forming sentences with subordinating conjunctions
C
onjunctions are the glue that connects parts of a sentence, such as clauses,
phrases, or words. In order to reach beyond basic sentence structure in German,
you need these small yet important words to form more sophisticated sentences.
German uses two types of conjunctions: coordinating conjunctions, such as oder (or),
and subordinating conjunctions, such as weil (because). Your choice between them is
based on the structure of the clauses, phrases, or words that you’re joining together.
In the first section of this chapter, I clarify the difference between these two types of
conjunctions, and in the rest of this chapter, I explain how to use the most common
German conjunctions to express your ideas clearly and intelligently.
Conjunctions and Clauses: Terminating
Terminology Tangles
To get a good grasp on conjunctions and how to use them, you first need to under-
stand and keep track of the basic grammatical vocab. You’re probably already familiar
with many of the following terms, but here’s a quick recap of the differences among
phrases, clauses, and sentences:
 Phrase: A group of connected words that have neither subject nor verb, such as
nach Zürich (to Zürich)
 Clause: A group of related words that have a subject and a verb, such as Ich
fliege (I’m flying)
• Main clause (independent clause): A clause that can stand on its own; it
has a sentence structure, as in der Nachrichtensprecher war enttäuscht
(the newscaster was disappointed). This is just about the same as a sen-
tence, except it doesn’t have a proper beginning (capitalized D in der) or a
punctuation mark at the end (a period in this example).

• Subordinate clause (dependent clause): This clause has a sentence struc-
ture with a subject and a verb, but it can’t stand on its own; it needs some
help from its friends, the independent clause and the conjunction. If you
see such a clause alone without a main clause — for example, weil er seine
Stimme verloren hat (because he lost his voice) — you’re left waiting to
find out more information.
 Sentence: A group of words that has it all: subject, verb, and an ending like a
period, exclamation point, or question mark — the whole shebang, as in Ich
fliege nächste Woche nach Zürich (I’m flying to Zürich next week).
Conjunctions are the connectors, the cement, the orangutan glue that you use to 
combine sentence parts. Here are the two types of conjunctions:
 Coordinating: A coordinating conjunction joins main clauses, phrases, or words.
Der Nachrichtensprecher hat seine Stimme verloren, und er musste zu
Hause bleiben. (The newscaster lost his voice, and he had to stay home.)
The coordinating conjunction und (and) combines the two main clauses;
a comma placed before und separates the two clauses.
Martin ging nach Hause und machte sich ein Käsebrot zum Abendessen.
(Martin went home and made [himself] a cheese sandwich for supper.) Und
(and) is a coordinating conjunction; it combines two actions (verbs) that
Martin did.
 Subordinating: This conjunction introduces a subordinate clause and relates it
to another clause in the sentence.
Der Nachrichtensprecher war enttäuscht, weil er seine Stimme verloren
hat. (The newscaster was disappointed because he lost his voice.) Weil
(because) is the subordinating conjunction. The subordinate clause weil er
seine Stimme verloren hat (because he lost his voice) has complete mean-
ing when it’s connected to der Nachrichtensprecher war enttäuscht (the
newscaster was disappointed).
Martin ging nach Hause, obwohl er sehr einsam war. (Martin went home,
although he was very lonely.) The subordinating conjunction obwohl
(although) introduces the subordinate clause that follows it and connects
the two parts of the sentence, Martin ging nach Hause and er sehr
einsam war.
In English, conjunctions such as and, because, but, or, and when are simple to use in a
sentence; the word order comes naturally for fluent speakers. German conjunctions,
however, require a conscious effort to keep in mind which type of conjunction you’re
dealing with and how to get the word order straight. You also need to remember the
comma. Keep reading for how to correctly use these two types of conjunctions.
Connecting with Coordinating Conjunctions
The coordinating conjunctions, the ones that join main clauses, phrases, or words, are
the easier of the two types to master. The number of German coordinating conjunc-
tions is small, and they correspond well to their English counterparts in meaning and
usage — except for a few easy-to-understand differences.

Note: In German, you don’t use a comma in front of und in a series (or list of words),
although this practice is common in English. Example: Wir haben Kartoffelbrei,
Spinat und Kabeljau gegessen. (We ate mashed potatoes, spinach, and cod.)
Working on word order: Coordinating
conjunctions
When you form German sentences with coordinating conjunctions, the separate sen-
tence parts maintain their word order. Keep in mind that in standard German word
order, the active, conjugated verb is placed in second position. The standard word
order is the same for English and German: Take the subject + the verb + the other
information, like an object or a prepositional phrase, and add the conjunction to com-
bine the other sentence part. Now you have two parts combined into one sentence:
Luca geht ins Kaufhaus, aber sein Hund bleibt zu Hause. (Luca goes to the
department store, but his dog stays home.) Aber (but) is the coordinating 
conjunction.
209
Chapter 14: Connecting with Conjunctions

Although the preceding word order is exactly the same in English and German, I can’t
let you go away without pointing out other German sentences using a coordinating
conjunction that have a different word order from the standard subject + verb + other
information structure. (Go to Chapter 1 for more on word order.)
Time expressions (descriptions of time such as this morning, in the eighteenth century,
at five o’clock, and so on) can take the place of the subject. The verb is still in second
position, but the subject goes behind the verb. This point is important because it 
distinguishes coordinating conjuctions from their cousins, the subordinating conjunc-
tions. I explain the differences between these two conjunction types in the “Using
subordinating conjunctions” section of this chapter. The example shows you how this
word order change looks:
Wir fahren heute mit dem Zug nach Hamburg, denn morgen in der Früh
möchten wir zum Fischmarkt gehen. (We’re taking the train to Hamburg today
because tomorrow morning we’d like to go to the fish market.) The time expression
morgen in der Früh immediately follows the coordinating conjunction denn.
When forming a German sentence, remember time, manner, place. It’s the mantra for
positioning information describing when, how, and where. The standard word order is 
1. Time (tells when)
2. Manner (tells how)
3. Place (tells where)
For example, in the sentence, wir fahren heute mit dem Zug nach Hamburg, heute =
time, mit dem Zug = manner, and nach Hamburg = place. In the second clause, denn
morgen in der Früh möchten wir zum Fischmarkt gehen, morgen in der Früh = time
and zum Fischmarkt = place.
The following sentence elements are in the wrong word order. Rewrite the sentences
in the correct word order. Remember to use the comma if appropriate. The first word
is in the correct position.
Q. Ich / das Wasser / möchte / zu kalt / aber / schwimmen / ist
A. Ich möchte schwimmen, aber das Wasser ist zu kalt. (I’d like to go swimming, but the
water is too cold.)
1. Kai / zwei / drei / und / Stefanie / Brüder / hat / hat Schwestern (four alternatives)
__________________________________________________________________________________
2. Sven / aber / sehr intelligent / er / nicht amüsant / ist / ist (two alternatives)

__________________________________________________________________________________

4. Heute / denn / ich / nicht / ich / eine / Erkältung / arbeite / habe
__________________________________________________________________________________
Using coordinating conjunctions
Incorporating coordinating conjunctions into your writing and speech shouldn’t be
too difficult. The coordinating conjunctions are straightforward in usage and mean-
ing. You just combine two sentence parts by using the coordinating conjunction that
fits what you intend to say about the relationship between them.
The common coordinating conjunctions are as follows:
 aber (but)
 sondern (but)
 denn (for, because)
 und (and)
 oder (or)
When writing in German, oder and und don’t need a comma preceding them,
although using a comma sometimes improves clarity. Aber, sondern, and denn do
need a preceding comma to connect clauses, phrases, and words. Denn, however,
connects clauses only; it has the same function as because in English. Otherwise,
word order follows the guidelines as described in the preceding section for coordinat-
ing conjunctions.
Ich gehe zur Bank, denn ich brauche Geld. (I’m going to the bank because I need
some money.)
Heute esse ich ein saftiges Steak im Restaurant, oder ich mache Spaghetti zu
Hause. (Today I’ll have a juicy steak in a restaurant, or I’ll make spaghetti at home.)
Sondern and aber both mean but; however, their uses differ. You use sondern to
express but, but rather in cases where the preceding clause has a negative expression
(is negated) and where the two ideas cancel each other; for example, Ich wohne nicht
in der Stadmitte, sondern am Stadtrand (I live not downtown but [rather] on the out-
skirts of the city). The main clause in the beginning (Ich wohne nicht in der Stadmitte)
contains a negative, nicht, and the two ideas are mutually exclusive. Sondern links the
prepositional phrase am Stadtrand to the rest of the sentence. You use aber in the
same manner as in English — to connect two ideas that aren’t mutually exclusive.
Connect the two sentence parts together using the coordinating conjunction that
makes the most sense.
Q. Karsten bleibt im Bett, _________________ er ist krank.
A. Karsten bleibt im Bett, denn er ist krank. (Karsten is staying in bed because he’s ill.) The
conjunction denn is by far the best choice; denn er ist krank (because he’s ill) explains
the reason Karsten is staying in bed.
5. Ich möchte gern ins Theater gehen, _________________ ich habe kein Geld.
6. Ich fliege nicht am Samstag, _________________ am Sonntag.

7. Gudrun spielt sehr gut Squash, _________________ ihr Mann spielt auch sehr gut.
8. Essen wir heute Abend bei dir _________________ bei mir?
9. Der Film hatte nicht nur gute Schauspieler, _________________ auch hervorragende Musik.
Connecting with Subordinating Conjunctions
The trick with subordinating conjunctions is remembering three things: the correct
word order, where to put the comma, and of course, the meaning of the subordinating
conjunction. A subordinate clause (dependent clause) has a simple structure with a
subject and a verb, but it can’t stand on its own without help from a main clause and
a subordinating conjunction. A subordinating conjunction introduces a subordinate
clause and relates that clause to the main clause in the sentence.

their English equivalents and comments on their usage.

Using subordinating conjunctions
Subordinating conjunctions have some similarities to their cousins, the coordinating
conjunctions: Both types of conjunctions link ideas together, both introduce one of
the ideas, and both generally use commas to separate the two ideas. The distinguish-
ing characteristics of subordinating conjunctions are as follows:
 A subordinating conjunction begins a subordinate clause: Ich hoffe, dass du
kommst (I hope that you come). Dass is the subordinating conjunction, and the
subordinate clause is dass du kommst.
 A comma always separates the main clause from the subordinate clause: Ich
hoffe (main clause) + , (comma) + dass . . . (subordinate clause).
 Subordinating conjunctions affect word order of verbs: They push the conju-
gated (main) verb to the end of the subordinate clause.
Two subordinating conjunctions, als and wenn, have similar meanings; both can
mean when. However, als describes an event (a single event) in the past, and wenn
functions the way it does in English; you can use it for an action that’s repeated in any
verb tense.
Als ich in der Stadt lebte, hatte ich kein Auto. (When I lived in the city, I didn’t
have a car.) You don’t live in the city anymore; that event is over.
Wenn ich nicht mehr arbeite, möchte ich noch fit bleiben. (When I’m no longer
working, I’d like to stay in shape.) This sentence is in present tense; it describes an
imagined scenario in the future.
Ob and wenn are similar because they can both mean if. However, ob can begin an indi-
rect yes/no question, and wenn starts a clause that stipulates the condition of some-
thing possibly happening or not. Falls and wenn are also similar. Falls can be used in
such situations when you want to express in case or in the case that.
Ich weiß nicht, ob das richtig ist. (I don’t know if that’s right.) You’re posing a
question to yourself that would have a yes/no answer.
Wenn/Falls es morgen regnet, bleiben wir zu Hause. (If/In case it rains tomorrow,
we’ll stay home.)
Look at the following examples of how you use da, bevor, and damit in German sen-
tences. In the next section, you find example sentences with dass, obwohl, and weil.
Da ich wenig Geld habe, hoffe ich einen reichen Partner zu finden. (Since I
have little money, I hope to find a rich partner.) You can also use weil in place of da
in this sentence when you want to express because.
Bevor ich den richtigen Mann finde, werde ich meine Freiheit genießen.
(Before I find the right man, I’ll enjoy my freedom.)
Ich brauche viel Geld, damit ich Luxusartikeln kaufen kann. (I need a lot of
money so I can buy luxury goods.)
213
Chapter 14: Connecting with Conjunctions

Using the correct word order
Clarity is the name of the game, and to properly use subordinating conjunctions, you
need to make sure you put everything in its proper order:
 The conjugated verb is thrown (ruthlessly!) to the end of the end of the subordi-
nate clause: Ich hoffe, dass sie das Basketballspiel gewinnen (I hope [that] they
win the basketball game). The verb gewinnen (win) is at the end of the subordinate
clause, which begins with the word dass. Dass very rarely begins a sentence.
 When a subordinate clause begins a sentence, the word directly following the
clause is the conjugated verb of the main clause. Why? Because the whole subor-
dinate clause counts as one sentence element (one unit), so the verb in the main
clause is in its usual second position: Wenn ich zu spät aufstehe, verpasse ich
den Zug (When I get up too late, I miss the train). The verb verpasse (miss, as in to
miss an opportunity) directly follows the subordinate clause.
Look at the annotated examples of three sentences using subordinating conjunctions:
Ich hoffe, dass sie das Basketballspiel gewinnen. (I hope [that] they win the basket-
ball game.) The main clause comes first, followed by the subordinate clause.
1. Ich hoffe (I hope) = main clause
2. dass (that) = subordinating conjunction introducing the subordinate clause
3. sie (they) = subject
4. das Basketballspiel (the basketball game) = direct object, in accusative case
5. gewinnen (win) = verb at the end of the subordinate clause
Obwohl ich oft zu spät aufstehe, erreiche ich den Zug. (Although I often get up
too late, I catch the train.) The subordinate clause comes first, followed by the
main clause.
1. Obwohl (although) = subordinating conjunction introducing the sentence
2. ich oft zu spät (I often too late) = subject and other information
3. aufstehe (get up) = verb at the end of the subordinate clause
4. erreiche (catch) = verb at the beginning of the independent clause (counts as
second position in the sentence)
5. ich den Zug (I the train) = subject and direct object in accusative case
Weil ich viel zu spät aufgestanden bin, habe ich den Zug verpasst. (Because I
[have gotten] got up much too late, I [have] missed the train.) The subordinate
clause comes first, with the main clause in second position; both clauses use the
present perfect verb tense (see Chapter 16 for more on the present perfect). In
the subordinate clause, the two verb parts are at the end of the clause, with the
past participle (aufgestanden) preceding the conjugated verb (bin). In the main
clause (habe ich den Zug verpasst), the word order of the verbs follows that of
present perfect in a sentence with only one clause: The conjugated verb is in
214
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

second position (habe), and the past participle is at the end of the clause/sen-
tence. Remember that the whole subordinate clause functions as a subject, or as
one unit of information, with a comma separating the two clauses. The conjugated
verb is, grammatically speaking, in second position.
1. Weil (because) = subordinating conjunction introducing the sentence
2. ich zu spät (I too late) = subject and other information
3. aufgestanden (got up) = past participle of aufstehen (to get up)
4. bin (have; Literally: am) = conjugated verb thrown to the end of the subordinate
clause so it follows the past participle aufgestanden (got up)
5. habe (have) = conjugated verb at the beginning of the main clause
6. ich den Zug (I the train) = subject and direct object, accusative case 
7. verpasst (missed) = past participle of verpassen (to miss)
In the following exercises, the independent clause begins the sentence. This part of
the sentence has the correct word order. Decide whether the word order of the subor-
dinate clause is correct. If not, rewrite the sentence in the correct word order.
Q. Ich weiss, dass Sie sprechen gut Deutsch.
A. Ich weiss, dass Sie gut Deutsch sprechen. (I know that you speak good German.) The word
order is incorrect; the verb must go to the end of the subordinate clause.
10. Ich möchte, dass du morgen mit mir kommst.

Answer Key
a
Kai hat zwei/drei Brüder und Stefanie hat zwei/drei Schwestern. (Kai has two/three brothers/
sisters, and Stefanie has two/three sisters/brothers.) It doesn’t matter who has how many broth-
ers or sisters, so the order of the numbers is up to you, as is who has brothers and who has sis-
ters.
b
Sven ist nicht amüsant/sehr intelligent, aber er ist nicht amüsant/sehr intelligent. (Sven is
not amusing/very intelligent but he is not amusing/very intelligent.) Either placement of the
descriptions nicht amüsant or sehr intelligent is possible.
c
Heike und Georg wohnen in einem sehr kleinen Haus, aber sie sind glücklich darin. (Heike
and Georg live in a very small house, but they’re happy in it.) The phrase following aber has a
reference to Heike and Georg (sie), as well as to the house (darin), so this phrase logically fol-
lows the phrase Heike und Georg wohnen in einem sehr kleinen Haus. In einem + sehr
kleinen + Haus is a prepositional phrase; in takes the dative case, and the case endings of
einem and kleinen reflect this.
d
Heute arbeite ich nicht, denn ich habe eine Erkältung. (I’m not working today because I have a
cold.) The expression of time, heute, is in first position.
e
Ich möchte gern ins Theater gehen, aber ich habe kein Geld. (I’d really like to go to the theater,
but I don’t have any money.)
f
Ich fliege nicht am Samstag, sondern am Sonntag. (I’m flying not on Saturday but rather on
Sunday.) The hint is the negative nicht in the independent clause and that the relationship
between the two days is logically not Saturday but rather Sunday because they’re mutually
exclusive.
g
Gudrun spielt sehr gut Squash, und ihr Mann spielt auch sehr gut. (Gudrun plays squash very
well, and her husband also plays very well.) The hint is in the second phrase, auch sehr gut —
the information in the two sentence parts is equal.
h
Esssen wir heute Abend bei dir oder bei mir? (Are we having dinner at your place or my place
tonight?) If you’re ravenous and want two dinners, use und.
i
Der Film hatte nicht nur gute Schauspieler, sondern auch hervorragende Musik. (The movie
had not only good actors but also excellent music.)
j
Ich möchte, dass du morgen mit mir kommst. (I’d like you to come with me tomorrow.) The word
order is correct.
k
Es ist gut, dass er am Freitag Zeit hat. (It’s good that he has time on Friday.) The subject er
comes after the conjunction dass, and the verb hat must go to the end of the clause.
l
Wir möchten, dass sie den Vertrag unterschreiben. (We want them to sign the contract.) The sen-
tence is correct as it stands.
m
Es ist nicht gut, dass Norbert allein ist. (It’s not good that Norbert’s alone.) Put the verb at the
end of the sentence.

W
hat’s in a preposition? Zwischen (between) by any other name would sound as
strange. A preposition is a small word that shows the relationship between its
object (a noun) and another word or words in the sentence. It’s part of a prepositional
phrase, which starts with a preposition and has an article, noun, and other words.
You find out how crucially important these little guys are in expressing such things as
 Place/where something is located, as with in (in): es gibt eine Fliege in meiner
Suppe (there’s a fly in my soup).
 Movement/the direction where something is going, as with unter (under): eine
Maus läuft unter meinen Stuhl (a mouse is running under my chair).
 Information showing relationships, as with trotz (in spite of): trotz dieser Über-
raschungen, schmeckt mir das Essen (in spite of these surprises, the food tastes
good).
In this chapter, I break down German prepositions into four groups: accusative, dative,
genitive, and accusative/dative prepositions. The latter group are what I call the two-
timers because they can be either accusative or dative. I give an easy and logical expla-
nation for these wise guys in the section pertaining to them. One more section of this
chapter deals with preposition combinations, the fixed expressions like zu Hause (at
home) and nach Hause (to home [going home]).
Prepping for Prepositions: Basic Guidelines
Prepositions, such as around, before, and with, combine with other words to form
prepositional phrases that provide information on where (around the corner), when
(before noon), who (with you), and much more. Prepositions perform incredible tasks
when they combine with other words, notably nouns and verbs, to create a diverse
range of expressions. But all those possibilities come at a price. Prepositions are
finicky little critters, much more so in German than in English. They abide by gram-
mar rules. So how in the world do you get to feel even remotely comfortable with

understanding, let alone using, German prepositions with the right case? For a start,
look at these guidelines.
Getting the importance of case
In German, case is one key to perfecting the fine art of prepositioning. Both English
and German have many prepositions, and both languages use prepositions in similar
ways. However, English doesn’t have much truck with cases and case endings. In fact,
if you bring up the subject of case in English grammar, some people may tell you to go
home, lie down for a while, and forget all about it. But case is hugely important to get-
ting a grip on using German prepositions correctly in a prepositional phrase.
As with other German words like nouns, adjectives, and verbs, prepositions need
to be understood together with the other trappings of language. A lowly two-letter
preposition like in (in, into, to) has so much power that it forces the rest of the prepo-
sitional phrase — the noun and other words following the preposition — to take the
same case endings. The preposition doesn’t change; it “tells” the others to conform —
in other words, to follow the case of that preposition. The result is that the case end-
ings in the prepositional phrase help you to a) recognize the links between the prepo-
sition and the words in the phrase, and b) understand the prepositional phrase in
context of the whole sentence.
The three cases that prepositions identify with are accusative, dative, and genitive.
Some prepositions are two-timers: They may use accusative or dative case, depend-
ing on meaning. The following examples show all four groups of prepositions.
(Chapter 2 deals with the basics of case.)
 Accusative preposition durch: Mein Hund Bello läuft gern durch den Wald. (My
dog Bello likes to run through the woods.) The prepositional phrase is durch den
Wald (through the woods). Der Wald in accusative case is den Wald.
 Dative preposition mit: Ich laufe gern mit ihm (Bello). (I like to run with him.)
The phrase is mit ihm (with him). Ihm is the dative case form of the personal
pronoun er.
 Genitive preposition während: Während des Winters bleiben Bello und ich 
oft zu Hause. (During the winter, Bello and I often stay at home.) The phrase is
während des Winters (during the winter). Because während is a genitive preposi-
tion, der Winter in nominative case changes to des Winters in genitive case.
 Accusative/dative preposition auf: Meistens liege ich allein auf der Couch, aber
manchmal springt Bello auf die Couch. (I usually lie on the couch alone, but
sometimes he jumps onto the couch.) Auf der Couch (on the couch) is dative case;
auf die Couch (onto the couch) is accusative case. The first denotes place, and
the second describes movement.
Check out the section “Accusative, Dative, and Genitive Cases: How the Rest of the
Phrase Shapes Up” for a complete discussion of case and why case is important when
using prepositions.

Understanding what it all means
Meaning is another key to success with German prepositions. Know that the rules of
mathematics don’t apply here — the prepositions and their English counterparts
aren’t always equal. The preposition in looks like the English preposition in. Indeed,
you can use it the same way in both languages: Wie viele Fernseher haben Sie in
Ihrem Haus? (How many TVs do you have in your house?). However, it can also mean
into or to. Another preposition, bei, sounds like by but has a variety of meanings,
including at, near, and with: Bei mir gibt es keine Flimmerkisten (There aren’t any
idiot boxes at my place).
Prepositions crop up in places you’d never suspect, and they take on new meaning in
combinations with other words that can be surprising. It may be easy to assume
there’s a parallel in meaning between some German prepositions that resemble
English prepositions, either in spelling, pronunciation, or both. You need to be very
careful because one preposition may have several different meanings. Often, these
meanings don’t parallel the way the preposition is used in English.
Know one or two common phrases or words that combine with each preposition to
get a feeling for the various meanings a preposition may have. The trick to taming
these beasties is remembering them in commonly used phrases, fixed idioms, or stan-
dard prepositional phrases — not all alone and naked.
When you come across an unfamiliar expression that includes a preposition, look at
(or listen to) the context of the phrase. You can often make an accurate guess of the
meaning by checking whether the literal meaning or the figurative meaning makes
more sense. Your experience in your own language can help you make the leap of
faith to understanding figurative meaning.
Accusative, Dative, and Genitive Cases:
How the Rest of the Phrase Shapes Up
When you use prepositions in your German writing and speech, you want to use them
correctly, right? If so (and I hope you said yes), this section is key. It explains the role
that cases play in using prepositions. So what exactly is case? Case is like a marker, 
a tag, or an ID for a word; it shows the word’s role in relationship to other words in
the sentence. There are three groups of prepositions, organized by the case that they
need to form phrases. These three cases are accusative, dative, and genitive. Having
said that, by far the most frequently used group of prepositions is yet another group,
namely those that use both accusative and dative cases (fondly called the two-way
prepositions). For that reason, I deal with them in a separate section later in this
chapter.
As you go through this section, keep in mind that prepositions pop up everywhere in
German (and English for that matter). It’s definitely worth your while to be patient
and master the cases one by one. In addition, keep in mind that the context of the
phrase influences the meaning of the preposition: nach can mean three different
things in English: after, past, or to. Yet nach dem Weg fragen (to ask for directions)
doesn’t even translate using one of those three prepositions.

Chapter 15: Your Preposition Primer

No finger pointing: Accusative prepositions
Accusative prepositions express movement, opposition to something, and acts of
excluding or receiving. The small band of accusative prepositions includes bis,
durch, für, gegen, ohne, and um. These are strictly linked to the accusative case.
Look in Table 15-1 for a list of these prepositions, their English equivalents, and a
sample phrase.

the job.
To form phrases with accusative prepositions, start with the preposition and add the
information that the preposition is linking to the rest of the sentence — the preposi-
tion’s object (noun) and any modifiers. If necessary, change the endings of any arti-
cles, pronouns, adjectives, and nouns following the preposition to the accusative
case. The following outlines what needs to change:
 Some definite articles change. The definite articles are easy because the only
change is der →den. Die (feminine and plural) and das don’t change. (See
Chapter 2 for definite articles.) 
 The accusative prepositions build some contractions:
• durch + das = durchs
• für + das = fürs
• um + das = ums
In spoken, colloquial German, these contractions are very common.
220
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

 Most of the pronouns change. The personal pronouns in accusative (direct
object) case are mich (me), dich (you), ihn/sie/es (him/her/it), uns (us), euch
(you), sie (them), and Sie (you).
 Adjectives may or may not undergo an ending change. (See Chapter 12 for
adjectives.)
 A few nouns undergo an ending change. (See Chapter 2 for more on nouns.)
Sammy das Stinktier sitzt ganz allein, ohne seine Freunde. (Sammy the skunk is
sitting all alone without his friends.) The preposition ohne is followed by seine
Freunde; both words have accusative plural endings.
Dann läuft er durch den Garten der Familie Finkenhuber. (Then he runs through
the Finkenhuber’s garden.) The preposition durch (through in this context) indi-
cates movement. Den Garten is the masculine singular form of der Garten in the
accusative case.
Sammy läuft um den Hund Bello und . . . psst! (Sammy runs around Bello the dog
and . . . psst!) The preposition um (around) indicates movement. Den Hund is the
masculine singular form of der Hund in the accusative case.
In this exercise, use Table 15-1 to help you write the phrases in German. Some vocab-
ulary is indicated in parentheses. Remember to change the articles, pronouns, adjec-
tives, and nouns following the prepositions — if necessary.
Q. for you (singular, familiar) _____________________________________________

4. until tomorrow _____________________________________________
5. against the law (das Gesetz) _____________________________________________
6. for my boss (der Chef) _____________________________________________
7. without me _____________________________________________
Dative prepositions
Dative prepositions include some heavy hitters. Most dative prepositions express
relationships of time (when), motion (where to), and location (where). Some have
surprising variations in meaning. Nine are on the hit list: aus, außer, bei, gegenüber,
mit, nach, seit, von, and zu. These particular prepositions have an exclusivity clause
with the dative case. Table 15-2 shows the nine dative prepositions, their English
equivalents, and some sample phrases for each.

To form phrases with dative prepositions, start with the preposition and add the
information that the preposition connects to the rest of the sentence (the object of
the preposition and any articles or adverbs that modify it). Change the endings of any
articles, pronouns, adjectives, and nouns following the prepositions — if necessary —
to the dative case. The following list outlines what needs to change:
 The definite articles change like this (see Chapter 2 for definite articles):
• der →dem
• die →der (feminine)
• das →dem
• die →den (plural)
Note: Not all prepositional phrases need an article (dem, einen, and so on) with
the noun; these are generally fixed expressions such as clock times: es ist Viertel
nach acht (it’s quarter past eight) or other types: zu Hause (at home).
222
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

 The contractions that dative prepositions build are
• bei + dem = beim
• von + dem = vom
• zu + dem = zum
• zu + der = zur
In spoken, colloquial German, these contractions are very common.
 All the pronouns change. The personal pronouns in dative case are mir (me), dir
(you), ihm/ihr/ihm (him/her/it), uns (us), euch (you), ihnen (them), and Ihnen
(you). (See Chapter 2 for pronouns.)
 Adjectives may or may not undergo an ending change. (See Chapter 12 for
adjectives.)
 A few nouns undergo an ending change. (See Chapter 2 for more on nouns.)
Essen wir heute Abend bei dir? (Shall we have dinner at your place tonight?) Bei
is a true chameleon as far as variations in meanings goes. Here, take bei, add the
dative pronoun dir, and presto! — bei dir = at your place.
Nein, ich möchte lieber zum Restaurant um die Ecke gehen. (No, I’d rather go to
the restaurant around the corner .) The contraction of zu + dem = zum.
Luigis? Es ist seit einem Monat geschlossen. (Luigi’s? It’s been closed for a month.) 
Wichtig ist nur, ich esse mit dir. (It’s only important that I eat with you.)
This exercise is multiple choice. Decide which of the three prepositions fits into the
phrase or sentence, write it in the space, and then translate the sentence into English.
Use Table 15-2 to help you.

Chapter 15: Your Preposition Primer

Genitive prepositions
The list of genitive prepositions is small, but these types are used almost as fre-
quently as the others in this chapter. The genitive prepositions describe duration of
time, reasons for something, or opposition to something. Most of these expressions
are equivalent to English expressions that include of: instead of, because of, and inside
or outside of. These prepositions include anstatt/statt, außerhalb, innerhalb, trotz,
während, and wegen. A few other genitive prepositions exist, but they’re used less
frequently.
Especially in spoken German, but also in written German, it’s common to use the
dative personal pronouns with genitive prepositions; for example, wegen mir
(because of me) or statt dir (instead of you). Look at Table 15-3. This list of genitive-
type prepositions is short but powerful in expression and variations of usage. The
table shows the six most common genitive prepositions, their English equivalents,
and sample phrases.

To form genitive prepositional phrases, begin with the preposition and then add the
information that the preposition links to the rest of the sentence. You need to change the
endings of any articles, pronouns, adjectives, and nouns following the prepositions — if
necessary — so that they’re also in the genitive case. (See Chapter 2 for cases.)
Wegen der Hitze gehen wir nicht spazieren. (We’re not going for a walk because
of the heat.) Die Hitze in nominative case becomes der Hitze in genitive case.
Während des Winters bleiben wir meistens zu Hause. (We usually stay at home
during the winter.) Der Winter in nominative case becomes des Winters in geni-
tive case.
Note: In spoken German, some genitive prepositions — anstatt/statt, trotz, wegen,
and während — are typically used with the dative case. This is especially true in the
south and southwest German-speaking regions: Bayern, Österreich, und die Schweiz
224
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

(Bavaria, Austria, and Switzerland). Während uses dative case less frequently in collo-
quial German than the other three. The meaning of these prepositions doesn’t change
when you use dative case.
In this exercise, fill in the spaces using the prepositions in Table 15-3. Two tourists
staying at a Salzburger Pension (bed and breakfast) are talking während des
Frühstücks (during breakfast).
Q. _________________ des Lärms ist diese Pension wunderbar, oder?
A. Trotz des Lärms ist diese Pension wunderbar, oder? (Despite the noise, this pension is
wonderful, isn’t it?)
13. Ja, _________________ der Nacht habe ich sehr gut geschlafen.
14. Ich bin _________________ fünf Minuten eingeschlafen.
15. Mmm. Heute trinke ich Kaffee _________________ Tee.
16. Ich auch, aber _________________ des Koffeins soll ich nur eine Tasse trinken.
17. Fahren wir heute _________________ der Stadt? Ich möchte die Berge sehen.
Tackling Two-Way Prepositions:
Accusative/Dative
The nine prepositions in this section are the types that can use either accusative or
dative case, depending on meaning. The preposition in the accusative case describes
movement, whereas the dative case describes position. Another way to tell them
apart is by knowing that the preposition uses the accusative case to show a change of
location, and it answers the question wohin? (where to?). The same preposition uses
the dative case to refer to a location; the dative preposition answers the question wo?
(where?).
English sometimes has two different prepositions that do the work of one German
two-way preposition. Take in and into: In expresses where something is, and into
refers to the movement from one place into the other. The German preposition in can
use either accusative or dative case, depending on whether it expresses position
(location) or movement (from one location to another).
To determine whether you need to use the preposition in accusative or dative case, visu-
alize what you want to say. These prepositions indicate concrete spatial relationships,
not intangible concepts, which makes it simple to imagine the difference between a cat
lying on the table — eine Katze liegt auf dem Tisch (location = dative case) — and a
cat jumping onto the table — eine Katz springt auf den Tisch (movement = accusative
case).
Table 15-4 shows the two-way prepositions, their English equivalents, and a sample
phrase for each with the English translation. Remember — there’s no present continu-
ous in German, so the present tense (the mouse runs), present continuous (the mouse
is running), or both may be logical translations.

To form phrases with accusative/dative prepositions, follow the guidelines I describe
in the previous two sections for accusative prepositions and dative prepositions.
Some two-way prepositions combine with articles to make contractions. These are
mostly used in spoken, colloquial German:
 an + das = ans
 an + dem = am
 auf + das = aufs
 in + das = ins
 in + dem = im
226
Part III: Fine Tuning Your Writing with Flair 

Other contractions that aren’t as frequently used as contractions with das and dem
include hinters, hinterm, übers, überm, unters, unterm, vors, and vorm.
The following examples clarify how to form and use these prepositions correctly.
Die Kinder sind im Bett. (The children are in bed.) The preposition in (here it
means in) uses dative case here to express location. Where are the children? In bed.
Die Kinder gehen ins Bett. (The children are going to bed.) The preposition in
(here it means into) uses accusative case to express movement. Where are the
children going? To bed.
Ich wohne über einer Buchhandlung. (I live above a bookstore.) The preposition
über (over) describes where it is. Where describes location; it takes the dative case.
Der Zeppelin fliegt über die Stadt. (The zeppelin [blimp] is flying over the city.)
The preposition über (over) describes movement; it’s in the accusative case.
In this exercise, decide whether to insert the accusative or the dative prepositional
phrase and write it in the space provided.
Q. Ich schwimme gern _________________. (im Meer / ins Meer)
A. Ich schwimme gern im Meer. (I like to swim in the ocean.) You swim in the water when
you’re already in it, so you need the dative prepositional phrase here.
18. Marco sitzt _________________. (ans Fenster / am Fenster)
19. Alexandra arbeitet _________________. (auf der Bank / auf die Bank)
20. Gehen wir _________________? (ins Restaurant / im Restaurant)

Understanding Quirky Combinations
German has several quirky yet important prepositional phrases that you encounter
on a regular basis. You can easily grasp and incorporate these phrases into your writ-
ten and spoken German, so you need to be aware of what they look like and how to
use them. These prepositional phrases are easiest to remember in verb/preposition
combinations. Verb/preposition combinations are high-frequency expressions that
combine verbs with prepositions. Try to remember these examples as complete sen-
tences so that you can use them later. (Refer to Chapter 11 for details on verb/prepo-
sition combinations.) To understand what sets these prepositional phrases apart
from the others in this chapter, look at the descriptions of these prepositions fol-
lowed by examples:
227
Chapter 15: Your Preposition Primer

 Zu Hause and nach Hause are two prepositional phrases that are often con-
fused. Zu Hause means at home. It indicates location. Nach Hause means going
home. It implies movement, motion in the direction of home.
Wo ist Birgit? Sie ist zu Hause. (Where’s Birgit? She’s at home.)
Wohin geht Lars? Er geht nach Hause. (Where is Lars going? He’s going
home.)
 Bis (till, until) is an accusative preposition. What makes it different is the fact
that it’s used most often in combination with other prepositions, not as a stand-
alone. Look at the following expressions:
von 8.30 Uhr bis 19.00 Uhr (from 8:30 a.m. till 7 p.m.): This expression rep-
resents a sign on a store posting opening hours; clock time expressions
don’t need an article.
bis zum bitteren Ende (until the bitter end): Zu takes dative case: 
zu + dem = zum.
bis ins kleinste Detail (in[to] the smallest detail): Ins = in + das, the accusa-
tive case.
bis in den Abend hinein (on into the evening): The phrase is in accusative
case.
 Entlang (along, down) is the preposition that works the case crowd. It actually
has three case combinations: accusative, dative, and genitive. In addition, 
entlang often follows the information it modifies. (And it also functions as 
an adverb!) Look at the three examples of entlang using the three cases:
Gehen Sie den Weg entlang. (Walk along the path.) Den Weg is accusative
case. You use the accusative case here because you’re describing the
motion of walking along.
Die Grenze verläuft entlang dem Fluß. (The border follows the river.) Dem
Fluß is dative case. You use dative here because you’re describing the
place, the location where the border is.
Entlang des Ufers gibt es viele Schwäne. (There are a lot of swans along
the shore.) Des Ufers is genitive case. Usage of entlang in genitive case is
typical in southern Germany and Austria.
 Gegenüber (across from, opposite) is another oddity among prepositions. A true
multitasker, gegenüber is not only a dative preposition but also an adjective,
adverb, and even a noun — das Gegenüber is the opponent, or the person oppo-
site you. It also combines with verbs as a separable-prefix verb (gegenüberste-
hen: er steht mir gegenüber [he’s standing opposite me]). As a preposition, it can
be in front of or after its object; it makes no difference in meaning
Wir wohnen gegenüber dem Park. (We live across from a park.) The object,
dem Park, follows gegenüber.
Der Präsident stand mir gegenüber. (The president was standing opposite
me.) The object, mir, precedes gegenüber. Technically speaking, preposi-
tions that combine with verbs belong in a separate group called prefix
verbs. (See Chapter 10 for separable- and inseparable-prefix verbs.)

Looking Back and Ahead:
Writing in the Past
and the Future

In this part . . .
E
ver wanted to travel in a time machine? Then this part
is for you. In Chapter 16, you take a ride to the past
and stop off at the conversational past (officially called the
present perfect). As the name implies, the conversational
past is what you use to talk about your last trip, business
or pleasure; it’s how you describe the first time you ate
an artichoke and other exciting events in your life up
to now. Climb back into the time machine and proceed
to Chapter 17, which covers the simple past, the stuff
of fairy tales and serious newspaper reporters; it’s
largely reserved for written narratives about the past.
In Chapter 18, you leap into the future, delving into the
realm of expressing what will or won’t happen. You don’t
need a crystal ball for this; the helping verb werden (will)
works just fine.

Chapter 16
Conversing about the Past: Perfecting
the Present Perfect
In This Chapter
 Forming the present perfect
 Contrasting English and German usage
 Expressing yourself informally
P
resent perfect in German is commonly described as the conversational past
because — naturally — you use it in conversation. You also typically see present
perfect in informal writing such as personal letters and e-mails. German uses the pres-
ent perfect to talk about all actions or states in the past, finished or unfinished.
English, on the other hand, tends to use the present perfect for actions that began in
the past but have a link to the present.
The present perfect in German has two elements:
 An auxiliary verb, also known as a helping verb (English present perfect uses
have)
 A past participle (English examples are gone, been, and known)
The two auxiliary verbs are haben (to have) and sein (to be). First you conjugate the
auxiliary in the present tense, and then you add the past participle of the verb (gelebt
[lived]; gewesen [been]; geschwommen [swum]).
This chapter shows you how to form and use the present perfect in German and
explains how the present perfect differs between German and English. You also get
ample opportunities to practice the present perfect in German.
Forming the Present Perfect with Haben
The majority of verbs form the present perfect with the auxiliary verb haben (to
have) plus the past participle of the verb you want to use. There are two main cate-
gories of verbs, classified by the way the past participle is formed. They’re called
weak and strong verbs. (Don’t worry — you don’t have to go to the gym to find the
strong verbs!) Check out the next three sections for more information on weak and
strong verbs.

To conjugate a verb in the present perfect with haben, you choose the simple pres-
ent-tense form of haben: ich habe, du hast, er/sie/es hat, wir haben, ihr habt, sie
haben, or Sie haben. You then add the past participle of the verb. Check out the fol-
lowing example of wohnen (to live, reside) in the present perfect.
wohnen (to live)
ich habe gewohnt
wir haben gewohnt
du hast gewohnt
ihr habt gewohnt
er/sie/es hat gewohnt
sie haben gewohnt
Sie haben gewohnt
Ich habe ein Jahr in Paris gewohnt. (I have lived/lived in Paris for a year.)
German word order follows specific rules. When you form a sentence with two verbs,
the conjugated verb, (haben [to have], sein [to be], werden [will], möchten [would
like], and so on) takes second position in the sentence, and you push the past partici-
ple to the end of the sentence. (See Chapter 1 for more info on word order.)
Forming the present perfect 
with regular weak verbs
Regular weak verbs are the largest group of verbs. To form the past participle, take
the unchanged present-tense stem and add the ge- prefix and the ending -t or -et. You
need the -et ending in the following cases:
 For verbs whose stem ends in -d or -t — for example, heiraten (to marry)
becomes geheiratet (married)
 For some verbs whose stem ends in -m or -n — regnen (to rain) becomes 
geregnet (rained)
 For verbs recently taken over from English — such as flirten (to flirt) changes to
geflirtet (flirted)
However, the verbs ending in -ieren — such as, interpretieren (to interpret), which
changes to interpretiert (interpreted) — don’t add the prefix ge-. (You find the low-
down on these verbs that have no ge- prefix later in this chapter in “Outing the
Oddball Verbs.”)
So with the verb arbeiten (to work), you conjugate haben in the appropriate person
and then add the past participle. To create the past participle, you chop off the ending
-en, take the stem arbeit, and add ge- and -et like this: ge- + arbeit + -et = gearbeitet.

Forming the present perfect 
with irregular weak verbs
A very small number of weak verbs is irregular. What makes them irregular? They do
have the prefix ge- and the ending -t, but they don’t follow the same pattern as the
regular weak verbs. The present-tense stem changes when you put it in the past par-
ticiple. The good news is there aren’t many of these rebels. The bad news: The only
way to really identify them is to memorize these past participles because they don’t
follow any recognizable pattern.
To form these irregular weak verbs in the present perfect, conjugate haben in the
present tense and then add the past participle. Check out the following example with
the verb denken (to think).
denken (to think)
ich habe gedacht
wir haben gedacht
du hast gedacht
ihr habt gedacht
er/sie/es hat gedacht
sie haben gedacht
Sie haben gedacht
Luka hat oft an seine Frau gedacht. (Luka often thought about his wife.)
Table 16-2 shows irregular weak verbs with the German and English infinitives, fol-
lowed by the German and English past participles.

You can remember the past participles of the irregular weak verbs you use frequently
by writing your own example sentences; then refer to them as needed.
Change the following sentences into the present perfect tense. Conjugate haben
accordingly and add the appropriate past participle.
Q. Franz kennt ein sehr gutes Restaurant in Berlin.
A. Franz hat ein sehr gutes Restaurant in Berlin gekannt. (Franz knew a very good restaurant
in Berlin.)
13. Das Haus brennt sehr schnell.

__________________________________________________________________________________
17. Die Kunden denken nur an den Preis. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
Forming the present perfect with strong verbs
Identifying a strong verb is fairly easy. Its past participle ends in -en. (The one exception
is the verb tun [to do]; its past participle is getan [done].) In most strong verbs, the past
participle begins with ge-. Many of these past participles can seem pesky at first. Why?
They often have vowels and consonants that differ from those in the infinitive. I have
good news, though: A lot of these verbs whose past participles go through such spelling
contortions are high-frequency verbs. To form the present perfect with strong verbs,
you conjugate haben in the appropriate person and then add the past participle.
237

You can easily remember the meanings of many strong verbs because they’re reason-
ably similar to the English verbs. Another plus: You can even find similar patterns to
the English past participle forms. Take a look at these examples: beginnen, begonnen
(begin, begun); singen, gesungen (sing, sung); and trinken, getrunken (drink, drunk).
Go ahead and complete these sentences. Put the following verbs into the present per-
fect tense. You can find these verbs in Table 16-3.

21. _________________ du schon alle Emails _________________? (schreiben)
22. Um wie viel Uhr _________________ der Zug den Bahnhof _________________? (verlassen)
Forming the Present Perfect with Sein
Some verbs form the present perfect with the auxiliary verb sein (to be) plus the past
participle of the verb you want to use. All these verbs that use sein have two similarities:
 They don’t have a direct object, which means they’re intransitive. For example,
the verb laufen (to run) is intransitive: Wir sind schnell gelaufen (We ran fast).
An example of a transitive verb (with a direct object) is trinken (to drink), and it
looks like this: Ich habe eine Tasse Tee getrunken (I drank a cup of tea).
 They show a change in some condition — as with werden (to become) — or
some motion to or from a place: kommen (to come).
Generally, you form the past participle with ge- + the stem from the infinitive + the
ending -en: For example, kommen (to come) becomes gekommen (come). However,
you also have the types of past participles that have gone through some spelling
changes from the original infinitive form: Gehen (to go, walk) changes to gegangen
(gone, walked).
But of course, there are some rogues. The verbs bleiben (to stay) and sein (to be)
don’t meet the second criterion, but they still need sein to form the present perfect.
And then you have yet another rogue: rennen (to run, race), which changes to ger-
annt (run, raced). It has a -t ending in the past participle.
To form the present perfect with sein, you first conjugate the present tense of the
verb sein and then add the right past participle.
fahren (to drive)
ich bin gefahren
wir sind gefahren
du bist gefahren
ihr seid gefahren
er/sie/es ist gefahren
sie sind gefahren
Sie sind gefahren
Bist du die ganze Nacht gefahren? (Did you drive all night?)
239
Chapter 16: Conversing about the Past: Perfecting the Present Perfect

Even in conversation, it’s a lot more common to use the simple past of sein than the
present perfect; for example, Wie war der Flug von Zürich nach San Francisco?
(How was the flight from Zürich to San Francisco?). (For more information on how to
form and use the simple past, check out Chapter 17.)
Look at Table 16-4, which shows a list of verbs that use sein in the present perfect.
Some past participles have no stem change; others go through contortions to form
the past participle, so you need to memorize them.
Table 16-4

kommen (to come)

laufen (to run, walk)

Now it’s your turn. Put the verbs into the present perfect tense in the following dia-
logues. Refer to the example for the conjugation of sein with the past participle of the
verb fahren. You find the past participles you need in Table 16-4.
Q. Maria: Uwe, _________________ du nach Hawaii _________________? (fliegen)

Eyeing the Present Perfect: 
German versus English
In the present perfect, German and English have some similarities and some differences.
In both languages, you use the present perfect to talk about past activities, and both are
used in conversation. Also, the construction looks similar, at least when you use the aux-
iliary verb haben; for example, Ich habe einen Kojoten gesehen (I have seen a coyote).
The differences in the present perfect come about when you want to add a time ele-
ment, such as gestern (yesterday): Gestern habe ich einen Kojoten gesehen (Yesterday I
saw a coyote). You use the present perfect in German, but in English, you use saw (the
simple past). On the other hand, when you want to describe a past action that’s still
going on, you say something like Seit einigen Jahren sehe ich Kojoten (I’ve been seeing
coyotes for a few years). Here, German uses the simple present, yet English uses the
present perfect continuous. In this section, I provide you with variations of these differ-
ences in verb tense usage.
One for all: Representing three English tenses
Both English and German use the present perfect in conversation. The distinction
here is that in German, you actually use it a lot more frequently in conversation and
informal written language. Look at this example, which uses present perfect in
German but simple past in English because last night is finished:
Was hast du gestern Abend im Fernsehen gesehen? (What did you see on TV 
last night?)
German has only the one verb tense, the present perfect, to represent three tenses in
English. Depending on what you want to say in German, the following forms are possi-
ble. Here are three acceptable translations of Sie haben in Wien gelebt:
 Present perfect: They have lived in Vienna (expresses that they may still live there)
 Simple past: They lived in Vienna (says they no longer live there)
 Past continuous: They were living in Vienna (talks about a relationship between
two completed past actions — usually one is longer than the other; the other
past action may be described in a previous or subsequent sentence or in the
same sentence)
Look at the sentence They were living in Vienna. Because you don’t even have past
continuous in German (or any other continuous forms for that matter), you use the
present perfect as the pinch hitter like this: Während des kalten Krieges haben sie
in Wien gelebt (During the Cold War, they were living in Vienna).
241
Chapter 16: Conversing about the Past: Perfecting the Present Perfect

As soon as you understand how to form the present perfect, you’ll find yourself using
it very frequently to describe a great deal of situations in the past. In fact, unless you
intend to pursue a career in German journalism, you won’t have much use for the
simple past or other past-tense verb forms.
Opting for the German present
Now look at two more German sentences and their literal and real English translations.
You may be surprised (and relieved) that in German, you get by with the simple present
in some situations where you have to use the present perfect in English. And one more
economizing step: You express both since and for with seit in German. For example,
Seit wie lange warten Sie auf die U-Bahn? (How long have you been waiting for
the subway? Literally: Since how long wait you for the subway?)
Wir stehen hier seit zehn Minuten. (We’ve been standing here for ten minutes.
Literally: We stand here for ten minutes.)
Outing the Oddball Verbs
You need to do a bit of juggling with some German verbs that have prefixes when you
form the present perfect. I describe three types of oddball verbs: 
 Separable-prefix verbs: These verbs are recognizable by a prefix, such as -auf-,
that separates from the main verb in some verb tenses. It’s added to a main verb,
one that can usually stand alone, like geben (to give) to form aufgeben (to give
up, to check [luggage]). These verbs may have either strong or weak endings in
present perfect, but they have the ge- prefix: aufgegeben.
 Inseparable-prefix verbs: These verbs are identified by a prefix, such as be-, that
doesn’t separate from a main verb, like kommen (to come): bekommen (to get).
These verbs may have either strong or weak endings in present perfect, but they
lack the ge- prefix: bekommen.
 Verbs ending in -ieren: These verbs are easy to spot because they generally
have the same meaning in English if you take off the -ieren and substitute an
English ending such as -ify: spezifizieren (to specify). You form the past participle
without ge- but with -t: spezifiziert.
In this section, you identify these verbs and find out how to form the present perfect,
and then you practice writing sentences in the present perfect. (For more background
on verbs with prefixes, separable or inseparable, go to Chapter 10.)
Separable-prefix verbs
With separable-prefix verbs, you leave the prefix at the front of the verb, squish ge- in
the middle, and follow up with the rest of the participle. Most of the commonly used
verbs in this group resemble strong verbs (past participle ending in -en); others
resemble weak verbs (past participle ending in -t or -et). And just to put more into the
mix, a few verbs use the auxiliary verb sein. (See Chapter 10 for more on separable-
prefix verbs.)
242
Part IV: Looking Back and Ahead: Writing in the Past and the Future 

You put together the present perfect of these verbs by conjugating haben or sein in
the present tense and adding the past participle. So if the infinitive is anrufen (to call
[on the phone]), you get the past participle angerufen (called), which has the three
elements an + ge + rufen. Take a look at the conjugation of fernsehen (to watch TV).
fernsehen (to watch TV )
ich habe ferngesehen
wir haben ferngesehen
du hast ferngesehen
ihr habt ferngesehen
er/sie/es hat ferngesehen
sie haben ferngesehen
Sie haben ferngesehen
Habt ihr am Wochenende ferngesehen? (Did you watch TV on the weekend?)
You pronounce the separable-prefix verbs with the stress on the first syllable, which
is the prefix.
Table 16-5 shows you what the past participle looks like. I’ve included ist before the
past participles that need the infinitive sein.

Now try your hand at forming the present perfect tense with these verbs. Take the
helping verb haben (or in some cases, sein), conjugate it in the present tense, and
then assemble the past participle to create the present perfect tense.

Inseparable-prefix verbs
With inseparable-prefix verbs, the past participle can have a strong verb ending (-en)
or a weak verb ending (-t or -et), but the rest is relatively easy. To help you distinguish
how these verbs differ from separable-prefix verbs, just look at these three character-
istics for the past participle of inseparable-prefix verbs:
 The prefix always sticks to the rest of the verb, including the past participle.
 You don’t add the prefix ge- to the past participle.
 You don’t stress the prefix. Look at the infinitive erken'nen (to recognize) and its
past participle erkannt' (recognized).
You put together the present perfect of these verbs by conjugating haben in the pres-
ent tense and adding the past participle. Check out the conjugation of bekommen (to
get, receive).
bekommen (to get, receive)
ich habe bekommen
wir haben bekommen
du hast bekommen
ihr habt bekommen
er/sie/es hat bekommen
sie haben bekommen
Sie haben bekommen
Warum hast du die Zeitung heute nicht bekommen? (Why didn’t you get the newspaper today?)

for several reasons. First, they end in -ieren, unlike mainstream verbs, which end in 
-en. In addition, they form the past participle without ge- but with -t at the end.
245
Chapter 16: Conversing about the Past: Perfecting the Present Perfect

You can usually recognize the meanings of these verbs, and the English equivalent of
the infinitive often ends in -ify (verifizieren = to verify) or -ate (vibrieren = to vibrate).
When forming the present perfect with -ieren verbs, all you need to know is the 
following:
 You form the past participle without ge-.
 You always form the past participle with -t.
Look at how easily you can use these verbs:
 fotografieren (to photograph): Der Journalist hat die Demonstration fotografiert.
(The journalist photographed the demonstration.) 
 dekorieren (to decorate): Vor dem Neujahrsfest haben wir das Wohnzimmer
dekoriert. (Before the New Year’s Eve party, we decorated the living room.)
 probieren (to try, sample): Hast du die Torte schon probiert? Sie ist lecker!
(Have you tried the torte [cake] yet? It’s delicious!)
This time, you need to fill in only the past participle. The cognates you see in this
exercise end in -ieren in German. Sometimes these words end in -ate or -ify in English,
but they’re nearly always easy to guess. Das ist aber einfach! (That’s really easy!)

Narrating the (Simple) Past: 
Fact and Fiction
In This Chapter
 Forming the simple past
 Using simple past with panache
M
aster storytellers and journalists both have an incredible knack for drawing
their audience into a narrative. Storytellers lend a façade of reality to the
wildest tales as they twist and turn, fold and unfold in front of rapt listeners (or read-
ers), and well-written news reports of violence, natural disasters, and human prowess
can also rivet the readers’ attention. What these two types of narrators have in
common is they have a command of the simple past tense, also referred to as the
imperfect or the narrative past.
To describe any events or stories, you need verbs — and lots of them. In German,
the verb tense of choice when narrating fact or fiction is the simple past tense — for
example, er ging (he went), wir mussten (we had to), or ich sprach (I spoke). This
chapter compares the simple past tense to the other past tenses and helps improve
your German writing by focusing on forming and using the simple past tense.
To remember the difference in usage between the simple past and the present perfect
in German, think of the simple past as the narrative past; you run across it more fre-
quently in written German. Think of the present perfect as the conversational past,
the one that you hear in offices, cafés, and on the streets. (Check out Chapter 16 for
more on the present perfect.)
Conjugating the Simple Past
To write or talk formally about something that happened, you need to know how to
correctly conjugate verbs in the simple past tense. However, before I discuss conjuga-
tions, I brief you on how the simple past relates to English.
Although you may know that the simple past in German is translated as the simple
past in English, you may not be aware of other ways to render it. In some respects, the
simple past is a gold mine for expressing various verb tenses in English. Table 17-1
shows the English equivalents for the same German phrase, along with the context for
these differences in English translation.

The simple past verb form isn’t too difficult to master. You just need to know that
there are several types of endings according to which category the verb falls into:
 Regular verbs, also called weak verbs
 Irregular verbs, also known as strong verbs
 Other irregular verbs like sein, haben, and the modal verbs, also called auxiliary
or helping verbs
Note: A fourth category of verbs, the separable-prefix verbs, includes verbs that have a
prefix like ab- or a preposition like mit- in front of the verb; these verbs may be regular
or irregular. The prefix is separated when you conjugate the verb, and it’s generally
placed at the end of the phrase. Two examples are abfahren (to leave) and mitkommen
(to come along). Chapter 10 deals with separable- and inseparable-prefix verbs.
The applications of the simple past are quite different when you compare German and
English. The single most important aspect of the simple past in English is that it
describes an action that’s completed in the past, often with a reference to the past:
last month, in 2006, or when I was 13. English uses the simple past in a great number
of situations: to describe past events of both formal and informal (casual) nature, as
well as for spoken and written language. German, on the other hand, tends to use the
simple past in written language, especially newspapers, books, written texts, narrated
stories, and even fairy tales. In German, the simple past is also a means of describing
past events not connected to the present.
This section shows you how to conjugate different German verbs, including regular
(weak) and irregular (strong), haben and sein, and modals. After you read this sec-
tion, you can write about the past with eloquence and style.

Part IV: Looking Back and Ahead: Writing in the Past and the Future 

Forming regular(weak) verbs in simple past
Regular verbs are the ones that don’t have a stem change between the present tense
and the simple past tense. For example, the present tense stem of wohnen is wohn-,
and the simple past stem is also wohn-. The endings are what makes the difference
between the two tenses.
Here’s how to form the simple past of regular verbs:
1. Take the -en off the infinitive.
2. Add -te, which I refer to as the -te tense marker.
3. Add the additional endings (with the exception of the ich and er/sie/es forms,
which have no ending other than -te). The endings are as follows: nothing, -st,
nothing, -n, -t, -n, and -n.
Compare the present and the simple past of the verb wohnen (to live). The present
form is in parentheses after the simple past.
wohnen (to live) — Simple Past (Present)
ich wohnte (wohne)
wir wohnten (wohnen)
du wohntest (wohnst)
ihr wohntet (wohnt)
er/sie/es wohnte (wohnt)
sie wir wohnten (wohnen)
Sie wohnten (wohnen)
Ich wohnte in Dortmund. (I lived in Dortmund.)
A second group of regular verbs are those with a stem ending in -d or -t. A small
number of verbs with the stem ending in -fn or -gn also fall into this category. With
these verbs, for the purpose of making them easier to pronounce, you put an addi-
tional e in front of the -te tense marker. Taking arbeiten (to work) as an example, you
form the simple past like this: ich arbeit + e + te = ich arbeitete. Compare the present
and the simple past.
arbeiten (to work)  — Simple Past (Present)
ich arbeitete (arbeite)
wir arbeiteten (arbeiten)
du arbeitetest (arbeitest)
ihr arbeitetet (arbeitet)
er/sie/es arbeitete (arbeitet)
sie arbeiteten (arbeiten)
Sie arbeiteten (arbeiten)
Du arbeitetest sehr schnell. (You worked very fast.)
Try out your grasp of forming regular verbs in the simple past tense. In this exercise,
you see one of the persons (ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie, or Sie) and the German
infinitive form. Fill in the simple past form you need to fit the person indicated.

Forming irregular (strong) verbs in simple past
The group of verbs in this section is called irregular because unlike regular verbs,
these verbs have a variety of vowel changes in the simple past form. The changes
may simply be one vowel change, such as i to a; with the irregular verb beginnen (to
begin), the simple past stem is begann (began). You need to memorize the simple
past stem for each irregular verb in order to add the simple past endings to it.
Fortunately, you encounter many of these verbs often, so you may already know the
meaning and be familiar with the present tense form of a number of them.
To conjugate irregular verbs in the simple past, note the following:
 These verbs have no endings in ich and er/sie/es forms.
 The other endings, those for du, wir, ihr, sie, and Sie, are the same as the pres-
ent tense endings. The endings are nothing, -st, nothing, -en, -t, -en, and -en.

Part IV: Looking Back and Ahead: Writing in the Past and the Future 

Luckily for you, German has only a relatively small number of irregular (strong) verbs
for you to worry about when conjugating the simple past tense.
These verbs are relatively easy because with many of them, you can draw on your
knowledge of English irregular verbs to help you recognize the German cognates
(words that are the same or very close in spelling and meaning in two languages).
Table 17-2 lists verbs that are irregular in both English and German; they’re cognates
or at least verbs that begin with the same letter in English and German and mean
nearly the same thing. A couple of verbs — kommen (to come) and trinken (to
drink) — are different in spelling but quite similar in pronunciation. I give the
er/sie/es form of the simple past because it doesn’t have any endings.
Many irregular verbs are very common verbs, so you can familiarize yourself with
them by reading actively, which involves thinking beyond the gist of the text. How? By
slowing down your reading or by rereading a passage, you may notice how the verb
stem is spelled differently from the present tense form. Try writing down the verbs as
you come across them and figuring out the corresponding present tense, and then
you can familiarize yourself with the various spelling changes in the simple past.

Chapter 17: Narrating the (Simple) Past: Fact and Fiction

Forming haben and sein in simple past
When conjugating the two verbs haben (to have) and sein (to be), you need to pay
extra attention for two reasons:
 Haben and sein can function as auxiliary or helping verbs. Most verbs use the
auxiliary verb haben to form the present perfect, but some irregular verbs use
sein. (See Chapter 16 for more on the present perfect.)
 Although German speakers usually use the present perfect tense in conversa-
tions about the past (see Chapter 16), they use the simple past of haben and
sein more frequently in conversation. (They also use the simple past of the
modal verbs in conversation; check out the next section.)
You form the simple past of haben and sein with their respective stems hatte
and war. Similar to the irregular (strong) verbs, the ich and er/sie/es forms 
have no verb endings. Look at the two conjugations, with the verb endings 
in bold.
haben (to have) 
ich hatte
wir hatten
du hattest
ihr hattet
er/sie/es hatte
sie hatten
Sie hatten
Ich hatte viel Zeit. (I had a lot of time.)
sein (to be) 
ich war
wir waren
du warst
ihr wart
er/sie/es war
sie waren
Sie waren
Sie waren zu Hause. (They were at home.)
Last month, Helmut and Hannelore drove to Spain for der Urlaub (the vacation).

present tense; then fill in in the missing verbs in the German simple past. Some 
sentences have strong and weak verbs, but the majority contain sein and haben.

Forming modals in simple past
The modal verbs are the small band of modifying or helping type verbs. (See Chapter 9
for in-depth treatment of the modal verbs.) These verbs modify another verb, although
sometimes they can stand alone. The list includes dürfen (to be allowed to), können
(can, to be able to), mögen (to like), müssen (to have to, must), sollen (to be supposed
to, should), and wollen (to want to). Note: Although möchten is included in this elite
group in the present tense, it falls by the wayside because of its meaning (would like
to) and joins forces with mögen in the simple past tense. Both have the meaning liked
to in the simple past.
German speakers prefer to use the modal verbs in the simple past form when con-
versing or telling stories. The modal verbs are reasonably easy to remember in the
simple past form because they follow the same criteria:
 The past stem changes have no umlaut.
 You add the -te stem marker onto the simple past stem. The additional endings
are as follows: nothing, -st, nothing, -n, -t, -n, and -n.
Look at Table 17-4, which shows modal verbs in the simple past tense.

Contrasting Tenses
In addition to the simple past (Ich sah einen rosaroten Elefant — I saw a pink ele-
phant), two other verb tenses belong to the past tense club:
 The present perfect: Ich habe einen rosaroten Elefant gesehen. (I have seen a
pink elephant.)
 The past perfect: Ich hatte einen rosaroten Elefant gesehen. (I had seen a pink
elephant.)

Chapter 17: Narrating the (Simple) Past: Fact and Fiction

This trio is the mainstay for describing events in the past, in both English and German.
However, you can often get away with using the present perfect or even the simple past
in describing events that may actually call for the past perfect. In addition, the past per-
fect isn’t used very frequently in either German or English, so it takes a back seat — and
that’s a good way to remember when it’s used: namely to describe events that happened
way back before another past event. (Chapter 16 deals in depth with present perfect.)
The past perfect may not be very common, but before relegating the past perfect ele-
phant to oblivion, I want to contrast three past tense verb forms: the simple past,
present perfect, and past perfect. Look at Table 17-4. You see how to form these past
tenses, their applications (uses), and an example situation.

Chapter 18
Looking to the Future (and Avoiding It)
In This Chapter
 Avoiding the future
 Facing the future
W
hether you’re the type to face the future head on, no holds barred, or you like
to avoid the inevitable at all costs, this chapter has something for you. With all
the complications of case endings and the three noun genders in German, at last the
future pops up, simple and straightforward.
When you read the chapter title, unless you’ve been dusting off (and reading) English
grammar books lately, you’re likely to say that the future is one verb tense, the one
associated with will + a verb (I’ll get the phone). Actually, English has several ways to
express the future, although in German you’re on easy street. Why? In a great deal of
situations, you can avoid using the future tense altogether even while describing a
future event. In fact, German uses the future verb tenses far less frequently than
English does.
Before you travel into the future, though, the first stop is the German present tense. In
the beginning of this chapter, you find out how versatile the German present tense is
for situations in which English uses various future tenses. Later in the chapter, you
jump on the future bus and take a short and smooth ride through the future, looking 
at how to form it and when to use the future tense. I also include the most frequently
used time expressions associated with the future, as well as a short list of adverbs that
typically combine with the future tense to express your attitude about a future event.
The Future Is Now: Using the 
Present Tense Instead
In general, you don’t need to use the future in German when the context makes it
clear that the action is describing something in future time. Imagine you’re standing
on the subway platform, and the train is coming into the station at Marienplatz in
Munich. You have six bags and a broken arm, and someone behind you says Ich 
helfe Ihnen (Literally: I help you). In English, your helper would say I’ll help you. This
German volunteer is not grammar-deficient; he or she is an angel speaking perfectly
idiomatic German.

English has a total of four ways to express the future, as opposed to only two future
tenses in German. In addition, the future tense usage in German is far less frequent
than it is in English. Look at the following breakdown of how German and English
express the future:
 First is the present tense used for schedules, like travel plans. This is the same in
German: Die Maschine startet um 7.40 Uhr (The plane leaves at 7:40 a.m.).
 Next is the going to future, going to + infinitive verb, as in We’re going to visit my
cousins this weekend, which doesn’t exist in German. You usually use the German
present.
 English also uses the present continuous — to be + verb with -ing ending, as in I’m
taking the dog for a walk — which is nonexistent in German; you can generally
use the present in German for these situations.
 That leaves the will future verb form, which is equivalent to the German werden
(will) + infinitive verb used to express the future. The usage is less frequent in
German because the present tense can punt for the will future in a great deal of
cases. (Check out the last section in this chapter for more on using werden to
express the future.)
This section more closely examines how German uses the present to express future
actions.
Seeing when German present 
works perfectly
In English, you encounter all types of situations that require the future tense. But in
German, you can state those same situations by simply using the present tense, espe-
cially when it’s clear that you intend to express future time. (Chapter 5 deals solely
with the present tense if you need a refresher.)
The following examples give you an overview of the range of situations where German
uses the present to express the future. However, in English, you generally use the
future when you include an expression that refers to the future, such as next week.
Vielleicht ruft er morgen an. (Maybe he’ll call tomorrow.) Morgen (tomorrow) is
an adverb of time that expresses the future.
Dieses Wochenende besuchen wir meine Kusinen. (We’re going to visit my
cousins this weekend.) Dieses Wochenende (this weekend) refers to the coming
weekend; also, German has no equivalent to the English verb form going to + verb.
Ich bleibe heute etwas länger im Büro. (I’m staying a bit longer in the office
today.) The reference to heute (today) in connection with länger (longer) indicates
later on today; also, German has no -ing verb equivalent.
Ich glaube/Ich denke, ich bleibe zu Hause. (I think I’ll stay home.) German uses
present tense here, but English expresses a spontaneous decision (I think I’ll . . .)
with the future.
Ich vergesse nicht/Ich werde nicht vergessen. (I won’t forget.) In English, you use
the future for a promise. (If you say I don’t forget, it’s a factual statement, not a
promise.) In German, you have both options to make a promise.

Saying when: Using future time expressions
with the present tense
When you talk about future events in English, you often include an expression of
future time together with one of the future verb forms. Germans also use a wide range
of future time expressions such as heute Abend (this evening) or morgen früh (tomor-
row morning). Here’s good news for you: They frequently appear in combination with
the present tense.
Take a look at some common time expressions:
267
Chapter 18: Looking to the Future (and Avoiding It)
You can express future events in German by simply using a future time expression
together with a verb in the present tense — for example, Ich fliege nächste Woche
nach Frankfurt (I’m flying to Frankfurt next week).
German word order is typically time, manner, and place. Look at the breakdown of the
word order for a typical sentence:
1. Subject + active verb: Ich fahre (I’m traveling)
2. Time (when): morgen Nachmittag (tomorrow afternoon)
3. Manner (how): mit dem Zug (by train)
4. Place (where): nach Hamburg (to Hamburg)
Putting it all together, the sentence looks like this: Ich fahre morgen Nachmittag mit
dem Zug nach Hamburg (I’m taking the train to Hamburg tomorrow afternoon).
When you’re forming a sentence that has an expression of time such as am Mittwoch
(on Wednesday) or morgen (tomorrow), as well as an expression of manner and/or
place, you may want to be very clear about when something is happening. In this
case, simply place the time expression at the very beginning of the sentence, followed
by the verb and subject. Putting the time expression at the very front of a sentence
may also be easier if you have trouble remembering the correct word order for the
trio of time, manner, and place. That way, you’ve taken care of the time, and you have
to remember only that manner is before place.

The following example sentences show when various activities take place. All four
sentences are in present in German, but they express the future four different ways in
English. You may have more than one future-tense alternative for translating the sen-
tences into English, but all are in present tense in German:
Ich fliege am Dienstag nach Graz. (I’m flying to Graz on Tuesday.)
Ich denke, ich arbeite dieses Wochenende zu Hause. (I think I’ll work at home
this weekend.)
Übermorgen habe ich einen Termin mit einem neuen Kunden. (The day after
tomorrow I have an appointment with a new customer.) Der Kunde means the cus-
tomer. Ubermorgen is at the beginning, so the verb comes in second position, fol-
lowed by the subject.
Heute Abend telefoniere ich mit dem chinesischen Lieferanten. (This evening
I’m going to call the Chinese supplier.) Der Lieferant means the supplier. The time
element heute Abend is first, so the verb follows in second position, followed by
the subject.
You work at an international company. Your German boss, Herr Fleischmann, calls
you on Monday morning and wants to know your plans for the next three weeks.
Using the calendar and some future time expressions, describe what you’re doing on
the days you’ve made notes of your activities. Try expressions other than dates (such
as am 20. Oktober) whenever possible. Note that some questions cover more than
one day.
Here’s some useful vocabulary: der Termin (the appointment), der Abgabetermin (the
deadline), das Meeting (the meeting), and die Telekonferenz (the conference call).
Note: German calendars begin the week with Montag (Monday).

Facing the Future with Werden
Sometimes you need to use the future tense in German. German speakers do indeed
use the future to describe future events, either with or without a reference to time like
nächstes Jahr (next year), although speakers of German prefer the present tense
when they’re using a time expression in the same sentence.
When you make no specific mention of when something will happen, you generally
use werden to express the future. This section shows you how to conjugate the
future tense and how to use it correctly in different circumstances.
Forming the future: Werden + infinitive verb
To form the future tense, you conjugate the auxiliary (helping) verb werden and add
the infinitive form of the verb that you want to express in the future tense: Ich werde
bald nach Hause gehen (I’m going home soon). In this context, werden means going
to or will. Notice that the infinitive form, gehen, is at the end of the sentence.
269
Chapter 18: Looking to the Future (and Avoiding It)

werde gehen (will go, going to go)
ich werde gehen
wir werden gehen
du wirst gehen
ihr werdet gehen
er/sie/es wird gehen
sie werden gehen
Sie werden gehen
Ich werde bald nach Hause gehen. (I’m going [to go] home soon.)
Werden is a sneaky verb. It has several meanings. In this section, it means will or
going to. However, when werden is the main verb, it means to become or get: Wir
werden immer älter (We’re always becoming/getting older).
When some people see will in German, they equate it with werden. Watch out — will
indicates the future only in English:
Ich will nach Hause gehen. (I want to go home.) Will comes from wollen: to want
to. It’s a modal verb, which means it modifies the main verb. (For more on modal
verbs, see Chapter 9.)
Ich werde nach Hause gehen. (I will go/am going home.)
Using the future: Assuming, hoping, 
and emphasizing intentions
German speakers use the future tense with werden in several different situations to
express future action. Table 18-1 shows future tense usage, an example sentence in
German, and the English equivalent. Notice that the infinitive verb is at the end of the
sentence.

270
Part IV: Looking Back and Ahead: Writing in the Past and the Future 

Just as German speakers use the werden future to emphasize that something will
happen in the future, they also use it to say that something will not happen. The two
alternatives are werden + nicht (will not/won’t) and werden + kein (will not/won’t),
depending on what you’re negating.
Here are clear differences in the usage of kein and nicht (for further details on kein
and nicht, go to Chapter 7):
 Kein negates a noun, as in keine Zeit (no time). It has case and gender endings.
Meine Freunde werden kein Geburtstagsfest für mich organisieren. (My
friends aren’t going to organize a birthday party for me.) Kein negates
Geburtstagsfest; it replaces ein. Kein is in the accusative case.
 Nicht generally negates a verb: nicht gehen (to not go). It can also negate an
adjective, like nicht lustig (not funny), or an adverb, like nicht pünktlich (not on
time). Nicht has no case or gender endings.
Ich werde nicht hier bleiben. (I won’t stay here.) Nicht negates the infor-
mation hier bleiben.
In the following exercise, respond to each prompt by writing a sentence saying that
the events will or won’t happen. To help you know whether to use kein or nicht, I
underline the word or expression that you negate.
Q. reich sein, wenn ich 70 Jahre alt bin. Ich _____________________________________________
A. Ich werde nicht reich sein, wenn ich 70 Jahre alt bin. (I won’t be rich when I’m 70 years
old.) Reich is an adjective, so you need to use nicht. To express the same information 
in a positive sentence, leave out nicht.

271
Chapter 18: Looking to the Future (and Avoiding It)

Using the future to express probability
When you aren’t absolutely sure something will or won’t happen in the future, you
use expressions to describe probability. You may be confident that your favorite team
will win a game, but you’re not 100 percent certain, so you include words that express
high probability together with the future tense. Here are some common expressions:
 wohl (probably, no doubt, to be sure): Wohl expresses very high probability.
 sicher (probably, definitely, certainly): Sicher expresses very high probability.
 schon (probably): This elusive word can also mean already or yet or emphasize
that you’re aware of an event or a fact.
Check out some examples:
Die Haffenreffers werden wohl eine neue Garage bauen. (The Haffenreffers are
probably going to build a new garage.)
Leander Haffenreffer wird sicher ein neues Auto kaufen. (Leander Haffenreffer
will probably buy a new car.)
Der Nachbar der Haffenreffers wird schon ein riesengroßes Schwimmbecken
bauen. (The Haffenreffers’ neighbor is probably going to build a gigantic swimming pool.)
Your task in this exercise is twofold. First, arrange the words to make a logical sentence
in the correct word order. Second, change the infinitive verb (for example, machen)
into the correct future form (ich werde machen, du wirst machen, and so on).
Q. spielen / Monopoly / bis Mitternacht / wir /wohl
A. Wir werden wohl Monopoly bis Mitternacht spielen. (We’re probably going to play
Monopoly until midnight.)

major traps that lie along the path of your language
endeavors.

Ten Tips for Optimizing Your German

 Getting a firm grasp on grammar and vocabulary
S
tudying a new language can seem daunting at times. You ask what you’ve gotten
yourself into with all those cases, genders, moods, and tenses. No worries,
though. In this chapter, I show you ten essential means of optimizing your German.
Each tip contains practical guidelines on how to rapidly improve your command of
the language. These tips offer you an edge only when you follow through on them. Try
some, or try them all; I know you’ll reap the benefits.
Think Like a Native Speaker
What happens when you speak or write in your own language? The language flows
out of your mouth or onto the page. Now think about what’s going on in your mind
when you start formulating a sentence in German. It’s slower, for one, and it’s a piece-
meal process. You’re concerned about whether the noun is der, die, or das; you’re
juggling cases in your mind, and you’re mapping out the word order.
In order to overcome all these time-consuming steps, do your level best to think like a
native speaker. Here’s how:
 Start thinking in chunks of language. In other words, use the structures that you
already know in German and apply them. Every language is filled with frequently
used expressions, such as Viel Spaß! (Have fun!) and das gefällt mir [nicht] (I
like/don’t like that). Some language comes in frequently used phrases, like zum
Beispiel (for example) and mehr oder weniger (more or less).
 Look for compound words, such as Umweltverschmutzung (environmental 
pollution).
 Get comfortable with flavoring particles and verbal nods of agreement or 
disagreement: Wirklich? (Really?), genau/eben (exactly), and doch (verbal 
nod of disagreement).
 Become confident using prepositional phrases, such as bei mir zu Hause (at my
home) and subject-verb combinations, such as ich möchte gern wissen (I’d like
to know).
Such expressions are already set up for you; no need to reinvent the wheel by painstak-
ingly translating standard expressions word for word. Just dip into that reservoir.

Break Down Word Combinations
Although at first glance, a German text may seem to be filled with long, complicated
words, go for the jugular: Break down those torturously long words and figure out
what each part means. Even short words may have two or more parts.
Verbs are the premier culprits in this department. Take the verb vorhaben; it looks
like the preposition vor (in front of) combined with haben (to have). In English, it
means to plan something. When you think about the literal meaning — to have some-
thing in front — you can often grasp the figurative meaning as well.
Use What You Know
If German is a mostly purebred language, English is a crafty mutt. Incorporated into
English usage are elements of Latin, Greek, German, French, and even Danish. Why
not dip into English, and use it in German? German hasn’t been averse to using many
words that English has borrowed. Both English and German have acquisitions from
Native American languages (Moccasin), Spanish (Patio), Italian (Ciao), and so on.
Cognates — words that share the same ancestor — include the chunk of Germanic-
type words known to you in English but with some spelling differences. Be aware of
changes such as converting the v to f (as in Vater = father) or changing the d to th (as
in Bad = bath).
Check that a word that looks like English actually has the same meaning in German.
After all, der Mist isn’t a thick fog/fine rain; it actually means dung in German!
Get Going on Grammar
After you dive into the Grand World of German Grammar, take it slow and easy. Don’t
panic. There’s actually a whole lot of logic in German grammar. As you tread your way
through, remember that the following are important parts of German grammar:
 Word order: After you accept the rules of the game, you’re all set to cut and
paste the words you need to construct a grammatically decent sentence. Check
out Chapter 1 for general info on word order.
 Case and gender: You definitely need to know and accept these elements and
not fight them. Try to master the ins and outs of one grammar aspect step by
step. Consider a two-way preposition like in (ich gehe ins Hotel versus Ich bin
im Hotel), which can be I’m going in(to) the hotel (movement) or I’m in the hotel
(location); then write down some examples you can use that show the difference
between the two. Store them in a safe place, and consult them when the going
gets tough and you’re trying to decide whether to use im or ins. (For more on
prepositions, see Chapter 15.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Read and Listen Actively
While you’re reading or even listening to German, actively think about the grammar
and word order. For instance, a word in context may show its gender. As for verbs,
notice the location of the verb parts in a sentence. For vocabulary acquisition, try low-
brow alternatives such as flashcards or highbrow gadgets like an electronic translator
with audio feature. Check out listening material for your car. Watch a German movie.
One of the best ways to improve your German is to take advantage of all the German
available to you on the Web. The number of German Web sites is astounding — just
look for pages using the .de option of your browser (in place of .com or other exten-
sions). You can access German newspapers and other German educational sites.
Experiment with What Works Best
If there were ever an easy path to language fluency, the discoverer would make a mil-
lion. Even so, no two people acquire a language in exactly the same way. You may not
be the kind of person who learns to ski by going straight down the steepest slope the
first day. You may need some gentle pointers about turning, braking, and knowing how
to fall somewhat safely. Make it your mission to figure out what works best for you. 
Mentally leaf through the list of any skills you’ve acquired successfully, even if they’re
unrelated to language, from tying your shoes to taking apart a car engine. Ask your-
self how you did it. You may be the show-me-how-type, the trial-and-error type, or a
blend of both. Now try experimenting. Get a dialogue, a text, or anything you want to
use later. Try these three methods of gaining fluency and see which works best:
 Seeing: Draw sketches of significant German words. Don’t stop at the obvious,
such as nouns like der Baum, illustrated by a picture of a tree. Draw adjectives
that describe emotions (for unglücklich, draw an unhappy face); indicate a verb
such as wandern (to hike) with a stick figure walking up a mountain (don’t forget
the Rucksack!).
 Speaking and hearing: Practice reading the material to yourself; then record
your own voice, listen, and record again until you’re reasonably satisfied with
your results. Or read in a low voice using a metronome or slow music for rhythm.
Also, try singing some German songs.
 Doing: Try reading out loud and walking slowly around your living room (but
don’t stumble over the dog). As you read through verbs, act out the motions. For
bezahlen (to pay), take an imaginary credit card out of your pocket.
Find what works and implement that technique for improving your German. Go
ahead. Be a risk taker! You’ve got plenty to gain from experimenting — drug free!
Germanify Your Home
To get a firm understanding of German, why not Germanify your home? Whatever you
do is bound to pay off down the line. Here are some ideas:
279
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Optimizing Your German

 Make sticky labels for furniture, appliances, objects, or even food items.
Concentrate on one room at a time, touching the objects and saying the names
out loud.
 Describe daily chores and routines to yourself as you’re doing them. Write useful
German phrases on a piece of paper and stick it on your bathroom mirror.
Repeat the words while brushing your teeth (well, maybe while brushing your
hair). Write shopping lists in German, and as you read the ads, mumble the
prices to yourself in German, too.
 Write dialogue exchanges on index cards — the question on the front and the
answer on the back. Put a stack on your dresser and challenge yourself while
you get dressed.
Integrate German into Your Routine
Face it. When you’re serious about getting ahead with your German, you need time.
But who actually has oodles of leftover hours each day? Try figuring out how to
snatch some minutes from your regular routine and devote them to German. Spread
out those time bites over a whole day, and take your stuff with you on the road. If
you’re anything like the average somewhat disorganized Tom, Dick, or Harriet, you’re
doing yourself a favor by organizing your time for German. Here are some ideas:
 Instead of talking on your cell while stuck in traffic, keep a small notepad and
pen handy to jot down some thoughts, words, or phrases in German.
 Take along a word list, a dialogue (enlarge it first), or something you want to
master for your morning commute.
 Tuck some good old-fashioned homemade flashcards in your pocket. I know a
man in upper-level management who used his cards whenever he was waiting for
the elevator.
Embrace the Culture
Your grasp of German is relevant only to the extent to which you’re able to integrate
language and culture. After all, language is intimately connected with the people who
speak it. Broaden your horizons by finding out how German-speaking people think
and act. Becoming aware of their hopes and dreams and gaining insight into their way
of life is your path to a rich cultural heritage.
Set Goals and Reward Yourself
Set up a modest challenge for yourself by devoting one afternoon a month entirely to
pursuing your interest in German language and culture. Give yourself just rewards for
your efforts. The idea here is looking at the bigger picture. Go online and plan a bicy-
cling trip along the Danube next fall. Go to dinner at a German style restaurant, or try
cooking some German specialties for your friends. Go all out: Change careers and
learn the beer-brewing trade at Weihenstephaner Brauerei. Enjoy even the smallest
accomplishments you make. Tschüß! Oh, and viel Spaß!

Ten Pitfalls to Avoid in German
In This Chapter
 Avoiding writing and speaking blunders 
 Keeping your communication clear
E
veryone makes mistakes while learning a language — some big, some small, some
horribly embarrassing, and some riotously funny. As you read this book, you
don’t have to worry much about making mistakes. But for someone sitting in a lan-
guage class among peers or traveling in a far-off country, the fear of making a mistake
can be strong enough to give a well-adjusted, normally curious person a deflated, get-
me-out-of-this-muck type of mindset.
Doing the exercises in this book isn’t a substitute for getting out there and talking and
writing to as many people as possible — in German. But this book can help you come
prepared. This chapter is aimed at helping you sidestep the biggest blunders you’re
likely to make in German. So never fear . . . help is on the way!
Attempting Word-for-Word Translations
Leave the translating to the translators. It’s not your job. (If it were, you’d know
instinctively to shy away from word-for-word translations!) The instant online 
translating tools will never be as accurate as the best simultaneous interpreters 
at the U.N. Why not? Single words, let alone larger chunks of language, have many
shades of meaning. When strung together in sentences, words can even mean some-
thing entirely different from the words as separate entities. So please don’t try to win
a Nobel prize by analyzing German grammar or inventing mathematical equations
consisting of German word A + German word B = English word AB.
Word-for-word translations may work, but then again, you may end up the laughing-
stock of your listeners or readership. Tell yourself not to succumb to the temptation of
thinking a word, expression, sentence structure, or grammar point — anything at all —
in English is equivalent to something in German, or vice-versa (unless you know for
sure that it’s a real cognate, a word with the same meaning in two languages). Butter is
what you want on your toast, but Gift is (hopefully) not what you give someone on his
or her birthday — Gift means poison in German!

Downplaying Gender and Case
By messing up the case and gender endings, you can come up with any number of
very embarrassing results! Gender and case are the underpinnings of German gram-
mar. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and prepositions are all influenced by gender and
case, as well as number. Be sure you know what the three mean:
 Number is whether a noun or a pronoun is singular or plural. Not even number is
always the same in German and English; for instance, die Schere (the scissors) is
singular in German.
 Gender is the triumvirate of der (masculine), die (feminine), and das (neuter),
plus the other forms of der, die, and das that change spelling in various cases.
 Case is not related to brief-, suit-, or carrying case; rather, it’s the essential 
tool for putting words together in a sentence to make sense. All four cases —
nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive — are in the example sentence Der
Liebhaber gab dem Hund seiner Geliebten eine Leckerei (The lover gave his
sweetheart’s dog a treat):
• Nominative: Der Liebhaber (The lover)
• Dative: gab dem Hund (gave [to] the dog)
• Genitive: seiner Geliebten ([of] his sweetheart/his sweetheart’s)
• Accusative: eine Leckerei. (a treat.) 
For more info on gender, number, and case, check out Chapter 2.
Wondering Which Word Order
In German, you may frequently get stumped on which word goes where. To avoid mis-
takes, make sure you know the basics of correct word order. Here’s a quick overview
of German’s three main patterns:
 Standard: The order is subject + verb + other information; the verb is in second
position.
Bonnie hat viel Geld. (Bonnie has a lot of money.)
Verb in second position is one essential mantra to remember. Look at the exam-
ple. Substitute ihr ältester Onkel, Zack Kohle aus Gelsenkirchen (her oldest
uncle, Zack Kohle from Gelsenkirchen) for Bonnie, and the word order would be
the same: Ihr ältester Onkel, Zack Kohle aus Gelsenkirchen, hat viel Geld.
Why? Because all the information about the uncle counts as one element, namely
the subject of the sentence.
 Inverted: The verb comes first, as in yes/no questions.
Hat Bonnie viel Geld? (Does Bonnie have a lot of money?)
 Subordinate clause: The active verb (the conjugated part) comes at the end of a
subordinate clause, preceded by the past participle (if present).
Bonnie hat viel Geld, weil sie eine Bank überfallen hat. (Bonnie has a lot
of money because she robbed a bank.) The conjugated verb hat is at the end
of the sentence, preceded by überfallen (robbed), the past participle.
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The other essential mantra to chant is time, manner, place. Look at the sentence 
Ich fahre morgen mit dem Fahrrad zum Biergarten (Tomorrow I’m bicycling to the
beergarden):
1. Time, meaning when something happens, precedes the other two parts: Morgen
(tomorrow).
2. Manner describes the how of something: mit dem Fahrrad (Literally: with the
bicycle).
3. Place refers to where: zum Biergarten (to the beergarden).
Check out Chapter 1 for more on word order in general.
Think, Thought, Thunk: (Mis)handling Verbs
A sentence is made up of various parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, adjectives,
and so on. The single most important part of speech of a sentence that communicates
your ideas is the verb. Use the right verb to convey your thoughts, and people are
likely to understand your message, even if other factors in your sentence, such as
word endings, word order, and who-knows-what-else aren’t quite up to snuff. So you
select a verb — what next? You need to conjugate the verb correctly and know which
verb tense to use; otherwise, people may stare at you as if you just landed from Mars. 
You can rattle off ich habe, du hast, er/sie/es hat to your heart’s content in the
shower. But in a restaurant, you’re communicating with the server about food, so
you’re probably better off combining verbs appropriately to order a meal: Was
würden Sie empfehlen? (What would you recommend?).
Here’s another thing: Remembering which verbs use haben and which use sein to
build the past tense isn’t so terribly difficult. Messing up the modal verbs doesn’t
have to happen, either. Get as chummy as you can with the gang of six: dürfen,
können, mögen (and its sidekick möchten), müssen, sollen, and wollen. (Check out
Chapter 9 for more info.)
(Mis)Placing Prepositions and Prefixes
Take on the task of tackling both groups of these tricksters — prefixes and preposi-
tions. Prefixes are an important yet sometimes overlooked part of German. They alter
the meaning of the word they’re attached to, and some prefixes in combination with
certain verb tenses are unattached, so they have a quirky word order.
The preppy prepositions make great friends if you put in a fair amount of effort to find
out which case you’re dealing with. The bottom line is never to underestimate the
power of a preposition. They’re more influential in deciding the outcome of a noun 
or adjective’s ending than you’d imagine at first. Also, some prepositions — such as
entlang — are placed after the words they’re linked to: Gehen Sie die Straße entlang
(Go along this street).
283
Chapter 20: Ten Pitfalls to Avoid in German

Prepositions modify the information following them using one of three cases: accusa-
tive, dative, or genitive. The words following the preposition, such as mit (in, with),
have case endings corresponding to the dative case. Check out the following sentence:
Ich fahre gern mit meinem alten Kabriolet. (I like to drive my old convertible [car].)
The case endings for the dative preposition mit are in bold.
Some words, such as ab, an, auf, für, and zu, are both prepositions and prefixes in
German; knowing which is which can be a challenge. Many are so short they seem to
get hidden at the tail end of other words, or worse, squashed mercilessly in the
middle of a verb that’s been relegated to the back of the sentence: nett, Sie kennen
zu lernen (nice to meet you). When zu is the prefix of the verb zumachen (to close),
it’s at the end of the sentence in present tense; for example, Machen Sie bitte die Tür
zu (Please close the door).
Skipping Capitalization and Umlauts
Yield to the speed of lifestyles these days, and you’re likely to wish e. e. cummings
had gotten his way and eradicated nearly all capitalization. Well, he didn’t, and your
otherwise passable German can become confusing if you’re sloppy about which
words to capitalize.
Improper capitalization may just be the easiest blunder to remedy as soon as you
realize how few ground rules there are. By now, you probably know to capitalize all
nouns, as well as Sie (the formal address for you) and its sidekicks, Ihnen and Ihr.
The sticklers are the adjectives that function as nouns, such as nationalities and
colors. You see nationalities and colors used as nouns and adjectives, but only the
nouns are capitalized:
Ein Amerikaner (noun) fuhr sein deutsches (adjective) Auto. (An American was
driving his German car.)
Er hatte die gelbe (adjective) Ampel nicht gesehen, und fuhr bei Rot (noun)
über die Ampel. (He didn’t see the yellow light and drove through a red light.)
Although the red in red light is an adjective in English, it’s a noun in German. How
can that be? It’s alone (bei Rot), without mentioning Ampel, so it’s functioning as
a noun.
Like capitalization, umlauts are small typography elements that can have big impact
on meaning. Making pronunciation distinctions is one obvious role they play. In addi-
tion, German offers five ways of making nouns plural in German, and some of them
use umlauts. Should you write Bruder (brother) when you really mean the plural
Brüder (brothers), the reader may get the math mixed up.
Slipping on Super Slick Sentences
You get your engines revved and you’re ready to Deutsch sprechen oder schreiben
(speak or write German), so you figure, why not make a nice, long sentence instead of
short, choppy baby sentences like See Spot run? Sure . . . if you know how to juggle a
million grammar rules faster than the speed of your tongue or keyboard. How about
284
Part V: The Part of Tens 

slowing down? The goal of any language is communication, and a lean, clear sentence
is more likely to get your point across. You’re probably on thin ice grammatically
speaking if your sentence runs longer than two lines — unless Goethe is your idol.
Ready for a challenge? You’re at the point where you feel confident with your basics
that include subject, verb, and object to form a reasonably coherent sentence? Great.
Here’s how to gradually work your way up to more-complex sentences:
 Think: Is the word order fine? If that’s taken care of, consider adding some extra
information, a second idea that you connect with und (and), oder (or), or aber
(but). Word order with these conjunctions is no issue; just use them as connec-
tors (Chapter 14 explains conjunctions).
 Want to use the present perfect (conversational past) in a sentence and connect
it with a second sentence in the present perfect? Still no problem, as long as you
• Remember the word order for present perfect verbs.
• Stick to it for both sentence parts you want to link.
Chapter 16 can fill you in on the present perfect.
 For further challenges, such as using the conjunctions that change word order —
like weil (because), obwohl (although), and damit (so that) — build your sen-
tence slowly, thinking about where to place the verbs.
Write down any successful sentence patterns, the ones that have the correct
word order using more-complicated wording, and store them. You can use them
again by cutting and pasting the necessary words you need into the basic frame-
work of the two-part sentences you construct.
Being Informal on the Wrong Occasion
Being informal on the wrong occasion isn’t a matter of wearing jeans to a country-
club wedding. It’s a matter of using du on the wrong occasion. You should show
respect, distance, and decorum by addressing your listener or reader as Sie when
appropriate. That last tidbit — when appropriate — is the kicker. In a nutshell, use Sie
to speak or write to everyone except relatives, children, friends, dogs, cats, and the
talking horse.
Try to find out ahead of time whether the business partner, new neighbor, or other
German speaker you’re talking with or writing to has an academic or medical title of
doctor. If so, address that person with Guten Morgen, Herr Doktor Schimmelreiter
over the fence or Sehr geehrte Frau Doktor Hufnagel in a letter. Otherwise, Frau
Scherzl or Herr Semmeler is sufficient to keep someone on your good side.
Rejecting Review
Instead of hurrying with your writing, give it a quick read-through again. You can use
a plethora of means to check your written language. Go for it. Try a different method
for a week and decide which works best for you — maybe use all of them. Here are
some options that may be right for you:
285
Chapter 20: Ten Pitfalls to Avoid in German

 Consult native speakers diplomatically (buy them lunch and ask for pointers on
the market study you’re preparing to implement).
 Go to a bookstore that has the kind of coffee you like and peruse the
German/English dictionaries . . . and your wallet. Then splurge (I don’t mean on
the coffee). Next, go online and compare dictionary resources there.
 Try using a German spell check.
 Use this book to consult the topics that are your weak points.
Do something, anything, but don’t click on send before you read, review, and revamp.
Giving Up
When working on mastering a new language or a new sport, you may reach a plateau
where you get totally discouraged and want to throw in the towel. That’s exactly the
time to rally, run to the fridge, and grab a smoothie, energy drink, water, or whatever
is truthfully going to enable you to get past that stumbling block — and beyond.
When you hit that Mauer aus Ziegelstein (brick wall), simply go around it. Feel good
about what you already know.
The minute you start comparing your progress in German to that of a 10-year-old
German-speaking kid, stop. Stop, look, and listen to yourself. You’re an adult, so be
proud that the way you acquire language is far different from kids’ bantering on the
playground. Adults tend to enjoy analyzing and comparing languages; kids accept 
and use language, no holds barred. What you know as an adult, you probably won’t
forget — and if you do, you can implement effective language tools and your mental
resources to get back on track. Viel Glück! (Good luck!)

n this appendix, I list the conjugations for various verbs in order of the subject
pronouns, from first- to third-person singular, then from first- to third-person
plural, and finally the formal second-person address: ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie,
and Sie. For the imperative (used for suggestions and commands), the persons are
du, ihr, Sie. You also find a list that contains the principal parts of high-frequency
strong and irregular weak verbs.
Conjugating Verbs in Present 
and Simple Past Tenses
You conjugate verbs in the present and simple past by combining the appropriate stem
and ending for that verb. I list the endings in Table A-1. The patterns are as follows: 
 Present tense; simple past tense of weak regular verbs: Start with the stem
(infinitive minus -en ending); add the appropriate ending from Table A-1.
 Simple past tense of weak irregular verbs and strong verbs: Begin with the
simple past stem; add the appropriate ending from Table A-1.

Conjugating Verbs in the Present 
Perfect, Future, and Subjunctive
The following sections show you how to conjugate verbs so you can use them in your
writing and speech.
Present perfect
To form the present perfect, you conjugate the present tense of the auxiliary haben
(to have) or sein (to be); then add the past participle; for example, ich habe gesehen
(I [have] seen) and Ich bin gegangen (I have gone/went).
For the past participle of most weak verbs, take the prefix ge-, add the infinitive stem
(formed by dropping the -en from the infinitive), and add the ending -t. Example: ge- +
wohn- + -t = gewohnt (lived). Verbs with the stem ending in d, t, fn, or gn add -e
before the final -t ending. Example: ge- + arbeit- + -et = gearbeitet (worked).
Some verbs don’t use the ge- prefix. Examples include verbs with the infinitive ending
in -ieren, such as informieren (to inform) → informiert (informed) and telefonieren
(to telephone) → telefoniert (telephoned). Some inseparable-prefix verbs that don’t
use the ge- prefix include bekommen (to get), gehören (to belong to), and vergessen
(to forget).
The past participle of most strong verbs begins with the prefix ge- and ends in -en.
Many past participles have stem vowel changes, and some have both vowel and con-
sonant changes. For example, sehen (to see) →gesehen (seen) has no stem change;
finden (to find) →gefunden (found) has a vowel change; and sitzen (to sit) →
gesessen (sat) has both vowel and consonant changes. Table A-2, at the end of this
chapter, shows the past participles for strong verbs.
The past participles of irregular verbs such as auxiliaries may have different endings.
I show these endings separately in the corresponding charts in this appendix.
Future
For the future tense, conjugate the present tense of the auxiliary verb werden —
werde, wirst, wird, werden, werdet, werden, werden — and add the infinitive form
of the main verb. Example: Ich werde fahren (I will go/drive).
Subjunctive
In most cases of the present subjunctive, conjugate the subjunctive of the auxiliary
verb werden — würde, würdest, würde, würden, würdet, würden, würden — and
add the infinitive form of the main verb. Example: Ich würde leben (I would live).

Case Charts
U
se these charts as a quick reference guide to articles, pronouns, and adjectives
with case, gender, or number endings. You also find prepositions listed by case. 
Articles
In this section, you find the definite articles der, die, and das (the) and the indefinite
articles ein and eine (a, an). I also list the ein- words with the indefinite articles; they
have the same case endings.
Definite articles (the)

Indefinite articles (a, an) and ein- words
Table B-2 shows the indefinite article ein (a, an) and the ein- words, which have the
same case endings as ein. These words include kein (no, not, not any) and the posses-
sive adjectives: mein (my), dein (your), sein (his/its), ihr (her), unser (our), euer
(your), ihr (their), and Ihr (your). Each box in the table includes ein and the possessive
adjectives mein and unser. All other possessive adjectives use these same endings.
I indicate the case endings for all ein- words separately, as well as in each word, in bold.
Note: The word ein has no plural, so I put kein in the plural slot.

tive pronouns (this, that, these, those), reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, himself,
herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves), and the interrogative pronoun who.
Personal pronouns
Table B-3 shows the personal pronouns in the three cases: nominative, accusative, and
dative. In this section, I list the conjugations in order of the pronouns, from first- to
third-person singular, then first- to third-person plural, and finally the formal second-
person address (Sie). The nominative case is ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie, Sie.
