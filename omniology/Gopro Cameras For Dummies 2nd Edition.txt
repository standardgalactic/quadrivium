Introduction      1
Introduction
C
ompared with traditional camcorders, the GoPro is a superhero, able to leap 
tall buildings in a single  .  .  .  er, smartphone click. Your first inclination 
when hearing about such a unique camera is to think it costs a lot of money, 
but that’s not the case. The GoPro is cheap. Very cheap.
The GoPro challenges conventional notions of where you can put a camcorder and 
continually challenges users to find new and exciting places to capture movies and 
photographs. You can control the camera from a distance through an app on your 
smartphone, thus keeping you out of harm’s way. It’s waterproof too, so you can 
capture video footage under the wettest of circumstances, submerging the camera 
to record stunning underwater sequences right out of the box.
The capability to work in weird places would go only so far if the GoPro’s image 
quality were subpar. In fact, the GoPro can capture 4K video at a rate of up to 
30 frames per second (fps), depending on the model, so you can capture unique 
high-quality video at an affordable price. High-definition (HD) offers even higher 
frame rates, up to 240 fps.
This rugged little camera can go anyplace and produce exciting new perspectives. 
It works for everyone from amateurs to pros. Families use it to document their 
daily lives; students experiment with it; photographers use it to supplement cam-
corder footage. GoPro has even spread to the professional arena, with an increas-
ing presence in broadcast news programs, movies, and television shows.
I’ve had a blast making movies and playing with my GoPro, so I hope you’ll think 
that I’m the right dummy to introduce you to this camera.
About This Book
The new and improved GoPro Cameras For Dummies helps you make sense of GoPro 
moviemaking. Through my experience as a still photographer and a television 
producer, I describe how to use your GoPro to make movies, take still images,  
and make time-lapse sequences with fresh techniques and the latest cameras in 
the line.

2      GoPro Cameras For Dummies
Think of this book as a quick information stop where you can find out what you 
need and get back to work. It includes cinematic tips, effects that will impress 
your audience, advice on effective edits, and even some cool uses for your GoPro.
I wrote this book for people who have different proficiency levels but have similar 
ambition for making compelling movies and pictures. Some readers have already 
made their mark in conventional video production and want to add one more 
weapon to their arsenal. Others come from the still-photography sector and are 
fascinated by the GoPro’s still and time-lapse capabilities. Still photography is 
an untapped resource for GoPro, thanks to its ultra-wide-angle lens and unlim-
ited mounting ability. Simply put, it’s a great camera for capturing images with a 
unique perspective. Hobbyists, family documentarians, students, and now artists 
are all looking to understand this new, exciting phenomenon. The goal of this book 
is to make sure that everyone gets the knowledge he or she needs to use the GoPro.
How This Book is Organized
GoPro Cameras For Dummies is divided into four parts; each part details the phases 
of understanding GoPro moviemaking as effectively as possible. You will no doubt 
have a preference for a particular area. You may relish the section that pertains to 
understanding the camera, or you may skip ahead to the filmmaking techniques 
or the cool places you can use a GoPro.
Part 1: Getting Started with  
Your GoPro Camera
Part 1 provides the reader with a swift overview and capability of the updated 
GoPro camera system. Whether you’re a beginner looking to make movies with this 
unique camera, a working professional creating fresh visual perspectives for your 
movie or segment, or anyone in between, this group of chapters covers the newest 
GoPro models, types of users, and important accessories for making movies.
Part 2: Moviemaking Technique
If you think the chariot scene in the classic film Ben-Hur was spectacular, imag-
ine if they had GoPros back then. The GoPro changes the way you shoot action, 
yet regardless of the device or camera, the language of cinema remains the most 
important aspect for making a movie. The following chapters explain filmmaking 

Introduction      3
technique specific to the camera so you can produce an impressive movie with 
your GoPro HERO.
Part 3: Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Shooting video is only the first part of the process, unless you want to simply play 
your raw footage and bore your audience with a few moments of the good stuff, 
and the rest the warts and blemishes. Editing lets you show the viewer exactly 
what you want, thus creating the “wow” factor. This section covers editing your 
movie on a computer loaded with GoPro Studio editing software.
Part 4: The Part of Tens
The Dummies version of a top ten list will provide insight into fun places to mount 
your GoPro, professional applications, and making your movies and pictures 
­better by avoiding the pitfalls of using it.

Getting to Know GoPro
Y
ou’ve probably heard the old saying, “Good things come in small pack-
ages.” Sometimes it’s true, as in the case of a diamond ring. That sparkly 
rock is small, and many people would agree that it’s good. But a mosquito, 
which is smaller than a diamond, isn’t good at all, especially on a warm summer 
evening.
Small cameras rarely solicit as much disdain as mosquitoes do. Most of us accept 
the compromise of function for size, understanding that it’s acceptable for a cam-
era to have less quality and fewer features in exchange for traveling well.
The GoPro, however, shatters that compromise like a rock on a plate-glass win-
dow. This pint-size wonder not only fits in the palm of your hand, but also easily 
mounts anywhere. Put it on a bicycle helmet to capture the rider’s perspective. 
Mount it on a surfboard and not worry about frying the electronics, thanks to its 
watertight housing. How about mounting it on an inexpensive remote-control 
drone (more appropriately known here as a quadcopter) and recording overhead 
footage and something that was out of the realm of possibility for consumers a 
few short years ago? (Check local ordinances first so you don’t fly your airship too 
close to a restricted area or violate privacy and security of others. More on that in 
Chapter 6.)

Introducing the GoPro
The GoPro is a pint-size, consumer-priced camcorder that yields professional 
results and does lots of cool stuff thanks to its Wi-Fi capability, superior perfor-
mance, and extreme portability.
The GoPro doesn’t take up much space, so it’s easy to pack, carry, and mount 
in interesting places. The most feature-rich model, the HERO5 Black is a shade 
under 3 inches long, so it would take a bagful of these cameras to occupy the same 
amount of space as a conventional camcorder. The HERO5 Session and HERO Ses-
sion are even smaller. Regardless, the diminutive stature of GoPro becomes even 
more important when you mount several cameras in a confined area and that’s a 
good thing, because these little guys are often used in bunches.
“The bigger they are, the harder they fall” doesn’t apply to the GoPro because it 
weighs ounces, not pounds. Since the camera is small and lightweight, you can 
place it almost anywhere with little concern that it will fall because it’s too heavy. 
Earlier GoPro models captured movie files on an SD card, but because the camera 
got smaller and lighter with each upgrade, it now uses a petite microSD card (see 
Figure 1-1) that holds up to 128 GB of pictures and movies.
Wishing for the existence of such a camera just a mere generation ago was quite a 
stretch, like wanting a Pegasus in your barn. Fret no more. Your sanity is safe — 
at least when it comes to the existence of a durable, inexpensive camera that goes 
anywhere while capturing high definition video and even 3D video. All it takes to 
accurately capture whatever situation you have in mind is an optional, inexpen-
sive mount.

microSD (right)

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     9
Use it anywhere
Just a few years ago, ambitious users who attempted to put an expensive cam-
corder in a place where it didn’t belong usually didn’t get a compelling piece 
of work; rather, they often had to pick up the pieces of their smashed cameras. 
That’s less a worry these days, thanks to the design and durability of the GoPro.
Beyond being small and well designed, a GoPro can go anyplace you go and mount 
almost anywhere. Moviemaking has always had the dubious distinction of being a 
cumbersome endeavor, usually because of the size and weight of the equipment. 
It’s quite refreshing to have a high-quality camera with ultra-wide optics that fits 
in the palm of your hand and that has a mount for almost every situation.
Capturing footage in nonconventional places is the GoPro’s job description. The 
tougher the situation, the more impressive the results. The GoPro is shock-
resistant and waterproof, which are good qualities for a camera that can mount on 
almost anything, moving or otherwise. The next time you’re inspired to mount the 
camera on Fido for a dog’s-eye view, feel free. Shock your friends and neighbors 
when you decide to take the camera into the pool to shoot an underwater sequence 
(see Figure 1-2).
Forget conventional camcorders
The GoPro doesn’t resemble a conventional camcorder, nor does it behave like 
one. It looks more like a small square box with a protruding lens than a sleekly

designed camcorder. Although you can hold it like a traditional camera, it is 
equally effective (if not more so) when it’s attached to something.
Here are some of the qualities that differentiate a GoPro from standard camcorders:
»
» Size: The current GoPros are quite small compared with most camcorders 
and significantly smaller than their predecessors.
»
» Most models don’t have a viewfinder: Though the viewfinder is one of the 
main parts of a camcorder, only one current GoPro includes a viewing screen. 
That’s okay because you wouldn’t look through a viewfinder for most situa-
tions. The lack of a viewfinder doesn’t mean you have to imagine where the 
action will take place. Simply use Capture (discussed later in this chapter), 
which transforms your smartphone or tablet into a monitor.
»
» Wide-angle view: The GoPro captures an angle of view up to 170-degrees 
that provides an ultra-wide view unavailable on any camcorder.
Better than a camcorder
Just a few years ago, merely having a moderate wide-angle view on a camcorder 
was a minor coup. Going reasonably wider often meant using one of those poor 
quality wide-angle adapters that screwed on the filter or clamped over the lens. 
Adapters produced exaggerated distortion, especially on the edges, creating a 
foggy appearance. The GoPro provides a wider perspective than those old acces-
sory lenses, as shown in Figure 1-3, and does it with impressive optical quality.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     11
In a way, the GoPro represents the elusive go-anywhere camera that’s everything 
the camcorder never was: durable, mountable, and affordable.
Here’s why:
»
» Waterproof housing: Thanks to its polycarbonate body on the HERO5, (and 
Session) and plastic housing on other HERO models, you can use your GoPro 
in, around, and under water.
»
» Wearability: Although it’s not the kind of accessory that fashionistas clamor 
for on the catwalk during Milan Fashion Week, the GoPro is still quite fashion-
able. You can not only wear it, but also capture some pretty impressive video 
with it.
Here are a few ways to wear it (More will be discussed in Chapter 2):
»
» Chesty: The Chesty harness allows you to transform yourself into a living 
dolly. Instead of moving the camera through the scene and capturing choppy 
footage, be one with the camera and move through the scene in Zen-like  
splendor.
»
» Head Strap: The headband attaches to your head so you can get that 
walk-through look in your video (see Figure 1-4).
»
» Hand and Wrist Strap: Allows you to wear the camera on your arm or wrist. 
Capture timely footage simply by twisting your wrist or moving your arm.

» Bicycle helmet: Wear the camera mounted on your helmet to get the unique

» Seeker: Include mounting options of Seeker backpack.
Seeing What a GoPro Can Do
What can a GoPro do? Here’s a more relevant question: What do you want it to 
do? Asking this question is more like asking yourself about your own wishes and 
desires for unique video footage. When you determine what you want to capture, 
all you must do is connect the camera to the appropriate mount and press the 
Record button.
The following sections cover a few special capabilities of the GoPro.
Take still photos
Although still-photo capability rarely (and rarely means almost never) finds its 
way onto the list of reasons to buy a video camcorder, GoPro is the refreshing 
exception to that rule. It not only gets up close and personal with its ultra-wide- 
angle view (see Figure 1-5), but also does it with extreme sharpness. You can take 
still capture even further by capturing a scene at preset intervals to create a time- 
lapse movie. Although the current editions of the GoPro have excellent still-photo 
quality, it increases with each model.
For details on still-photo specs, see “Comparing GoPro Editions,” later in this 
chapter.
Capture the scenes of your dreams
The GoPro liberates your imagination by allowing you to capture situations that 
in the recent past seemed like fantasies. Since the early days of motion-picture 
capture, people always had the desire to present each shot with a unique perspec-
tive. At some point or another, we’ve all wanted to mount a video camera on a car 
bumper to capture compelling footage or fly it remotely over the action on some 
hobby craft, but doing so was never feasible or practical. The ambitious efforts of 
the more adventurous often ended in a crash landing.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     13
Now, with GoPro, those creative ideas are not only possible, but also practical 
thanks to the camera’s durability, unique mounts, and Wi-Fi communication. 
Here are a few things that GoPro makes possible:
»
» Connect it to an extension pole to get an overhead shot of the scene.
»
» Put it on a guitar.
»
» Attach it to your dog.
»
» Use it on a surfboard.
»
» Mount it on a car.
Capture HD and 4K video
Although all current GoPro models let you capture full-frame high-definition 
(HD) video, the quality and frame-rate options increase with the 4K setting. Using 
H264 compression, the GoPro compresses captured video files to fit more infor-
mation on the microSD card, and the compressed files maintain substantial qual-
ity when opened. 4K is a high-resolution setting for video capture. Think HD and 
then quadruple the quality.
FIGURE 1-5: 
Still capture

is remarkably 
good, especially 
at a unique 
angle.

14     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
The 4K mode captures 3820 × 2160 resolution with a frame rate of 30 frames per 
second (fps) on the HERO5 and HERO4 Black Editions. The higher frame rate cuts 
down the choppiness when capturing action sequences. The HERO4 Silver Edi-
tion and HERO3+ Black Edition capture at 15 fps. The HD modes on all current 
HERO models capture between 30 and 120 fps. The HERO4 Black and HERO5 Black 
can record to 240 fps in the 720p mode. The more frames a camera captures, the 
smoother the playback. At 15 fps, situations that have less movement render much 
better than those with fast action.
Attach to anything
The GoPro system can make you feel like Inspector Gadget. There’s something 
very spylike about securing your GoPro anyplace you want — high or low, moving 
or stationary— and then monitoring the scene on your smartphone. Thanks to the 
camera’s various mounting plates, you can put it almost anywhere, even a boat 
rail as seen in Figure 1-6.
Connect the camera to a skateboard, or mount a bunch of cameras inside and 
outside a car as it plows through dunes. You can even hold a GoPro underwater 
with an extension pole to capture underwater video. I talk more about mounting 
devices in Chapter 2.

Connect to your other devices
Wi-Fi capability doesn’t mean you can check your fantasy-football scores when 
shooting, but it does provide some pretty radical communication between the 
camera and your smartphone or remote. You can control the camera over Wi-Fi 
with your smartphone, tablet, or Apple Watch. You can also use devices as 
a monitor. The HERO5 also can automatically upload to the GoPro Plus Cloud. 
You will need a subscription to do it. Check it out at http://shop.gopro.com/

Comparing GoPro Editions
The latest GoPro line, HERO5, features two cameras with varying features and 
quality levels. Each model offers Wi-Fi capability. The HERO5 Black closely 
resembles the size and footprint of the previous model, though it no longer needs 
a waterproof housing. The HERO5 Session looks like its predecessor, but internally 
it’s been given a power jolt too. With 4K video capture, voice control, and some 
cool night functions, both models are equally amazing when it comes to quality, 
though each has features consistent with your needs.
Let’s delve further into each model.
HERO5 Black
Once upon a time, it was a range of tonal names that differentiated the GoPro 
HERO, including the Silver and White editions. And while many of these models 
are still viable choices, the latest version is only about the Black. It’s the big kahuna 
of the HERO line and it has been revamped so much that there’s only a need for a 
single model of this size. The most obvious difference with this model is its ready- 
to-go waterproof design, good for depths as low as 33 feet (10m), and face it, how 
many times do you need to go deeper? A lot, you say, then just use the optional 
Dive Housing; it’s good for close to 197 feet (60m).

16     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Besides the built-in water protection, the latest entry is pretty feature-packed. 
Not only does it capture 4K video that can make your audience feel like they’re 
in the middle of the action, but also it can capture it with one-button simplicity.
Internal improvements help stabilize video in shaky situations, capture crystal-clear 
audio, and provide pro-quality photo capture. Combine that with voice control and 
GPS, the HERO5 Black packs a lot of punch in such a portable camera. (see Figure 1-7)
Other new features over previous HERO models include:
»
» Touch screen display: There’s no more guessing at what you’re capturing or 
controlling the camera thanks to a built-in two-inch screen that allows you to 
view the scene, change settings, and edit footage. You can even upload 
footage to your GoPro Plus Cloud account, and access it on any device.
»
» Voice control: If you’re going to deal with those funny looks when seen 
talking to your GoPro, it’s nice for the camera to reciprocate. The voice 
command function will let you control the camera with hands, er, fingers-free 
operation. It understands 12 commands such as “GoPro start recording,” or 
“GoPro turn off.” As you can see by these examples, you must precede the 
action with GoPro, so the camera knows you’re talking to her.
»
» Stunning 4K recording: Capture 4K video at 30 fps as well as 2.7K at 60 fps 
for ultra high-resolution video.
»
» Impressive HD video: Record HD video at up to 1080p (progressive) up to 
120 fps for capturing maximum detail. The higher frame rate also provides 
the best quality applying slow motion in GoPro Studio.
»
» Improved audio capture: Thanks to the three-microphone system you can 
capture the clearest audio ever on a GoPro, both above and below the water. 
Internally, there’s advanced audio processing and improved wind-noise 
reduction.
»
» Auto Low Light: The camera adjusts exposure when light values change by 
changing frame rates to compensate when you move between dense shadow 
areas and bright spots.
»
» Better control over photos: Lots of reasons. First, there’s Protune for photos, 
which provides the same control over still photographs as you have for video. 
Like what? Changing the ISO setting, exposure compensation, white balance, 
color profile, and sharpness on still images and time-lapse sequences. You 
can shoot in RAW for increased flexibility in Photoshop, and the WDR modes 
capture maximum shadow and highlight detail.
»
» Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Allows you to control the camera remotely through 
the Remo (waterproof voice-activated remote), smart remote and the GoPro App. 
It also enables auto upload to your optional GoPro Plus Cloud account.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     17
HERO5 Session
Most of the power of the HERO5 Black, but half its size, makes the HERO5 Session  
a great choice when you’re looking to carry a little less camera without sacrificing 
a whole lot of quality. Not only can you mount it using a wide range of acces-
sories, but you can wear it on your lapel like a corsage and capture the world 
with this incredibly portable camera. Stunning 4K capture, along with one-button 
simplicity makes this waterproof powerhouse a force to be reckoned with. (See 
Figure 1-8)
Other new features over previous Session models include:
»
» Voice control: This camera is so small that when you’re talking to it, a 
bystander may just assume you’re talking to yourself. But it’s a necessary 
function on a camera that’s so small to control to get hands-free operation. 
Like the HERO5 Black, it understands a dozen commands such as “GoPro start 
recording,” or “GoPro turn off.”
»
» Stunning 4K recording: Capture 4K video at 30 fps as well as 2.7K at 48 fps 
for ultra high-resolution video.
»
» Expanded modes: Added Time-Lapse, Night-Lapse, and Night Photo modes 
expand the possibilities for creativity.
»
» Auto Low Light: The camera adjusts exposure when light values change by 
changing frame rates to compensate when you move between dense shadow 
areas and bright spots.

18     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
»
» Impressive HD video: Record HD video at up to 1080p (progressive) up to  
90 fps for capturing maximum detail. The higher frame rate also provides the 
best quality applying slow motion in GoPro Studio.
»
» Protune for photos: Provides the same control over still photographs as you 
have for video. Change the ISO setting, use exposure compensation, or adjust 
white balance on still images and time-lapse sequences.
»
» Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Allows you to control the camera remotely 
through the Wi-Fi remote and the GoPro App. It also enables auto upload to 
your optional GoPro Plus Cloud account.
HERO Session
Not only is it the smallest GoPro in the lineup, but it’s also the most inconspicu-
ous. Easily worn, or mounted, it allows you capture impressive video and pictures 
in the smallest spaces. One-button operation makes it easy to start recording, but 
its small size provides less control on the camera. That’s no problem, since you 
can control the camera from your app.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     19
Some aspects to consider:
»
» Waterproof: No need to worry about a waterproof housing, since the camera 
is already waterproof to depths of 33 feet.
»
» Impressive quality: Sharp, professional-quality video capture at 1440p at  
30 fps or 1080p at 60 fps. You can record at the higher frame rate of 100 fps  
at 720p for amazing slow-motion playback.
»
» Great photo capture: Captures still frames at 8MP and photo bursts up to  
10 frames. In addition, it captures time-lapse at intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds.
»
» Built-in intelligent battery: It only uses power when you’re recording; 
otherwise it shuts off the camera. You can capture continuously for two hours 
or more on a full charge. On the downside, you cannot swap out the battery, 
so if it dies, you must fully charge the camera before using it again.
»
» One-touch recording: A single button powers on the camera and starts 
recording video or time-lapse photos automatically.
»
» Few buttons: The camera must be controlled through the Capture app to 
change settings.
»
» Always captures right side up: Even if the camera is upside down, it will 
automatically capture the scene right side up.
»
» Protune: When capturing video, it provides more control for camera settings, 
including white balance, exposure, ISO, and color. In addition, it captures with 
less compression than the non-Protune setting.
Previous GoPro Models
Don’t worry if you’re not using the latest model. The last few generations capture 
HD video, and even 4K.
HERO4 Black Edition
Every bit as relevant as its HERO5 Black successor, you can do everything with this 
model with minimal quality issues. Just like the new line, it captures 4K video at 
30 fps as well as 2.7K at 50 fps for ultra high-resolution capture. It doesn’t have 
the built-in waterproof case, nor does it have a touch screen. But since it’s water-
proof to deeper depths in its housing and you can always add an optional LCD 
Touch Screen Back, this model remains highly relevant.

20     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Here are some of its features:
»
» HD video capture: Captures HD video at up to 1080p (progressive) at 120 fps, 
making it possible to capture maximum detail even when applying slow 
motion in GoPro Studio.
»
» More powerful processor: Twice as fast as its predecessor, so you can 
capture video at increased frame rates with more detailed image quality, 
increased sharpness, and better color.
»
» Auto Low Light: Automatically adjusts exposure by changing frame rates to 
compensate when you move between dense shadow areas and bright spots.
»
» Protune for photos: Apply the same control over images as you have for 
video. Change the ISO setting, use exposure compensation, or adjust white 
balance on still images and time-lapse sequences.
»
» Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Allows you to control the camera remotely, using the 
Wi-Fi remote with the GoPro App. For this model, the remote is sold separately.
»
» Set tags on your video: The HiLight tag makes it easy to find the best part of 
your clip by setting markers while capturing footage.
HERO4 Silver Edition
The HERO4 Silver is loaded with features, captures 4K video, and was the first 
GoPro to include a viewfinder. While it can record 4K video, it does so at 15 frames 
per second, which is great for still or slow-moving subjects, but not so great when 
they move fast. On the HD side, this camera is impressive with capture up to  
60 fps, making it possible to capture maximum detail even when applying slow 
motion in GoPro Studio.
Other features include:
»
» Auto Low Light: Automatically adjusts exposure by changing frame rates to 
compensate when you move between dense shadow areas and bright spots.
»
» Protune for photos: Apply the same control over images as you have for 
video. Change the ISO setting, use exposure compensation, or adjust white 
balance on your still images, as seen in Figure 1-9, and time-lapse sequences.
»
» Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth: Allows you to control the camera remotely, 
using the Wi-Fi remote with the GoPro App. For this model, the remote is sold 
separately.
»
» Set tags on your video: The HiLight tag makes it easy to find the best part of 
your clip by setting markers while capturing footage.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     21
HERO
The most no-frills model of the HERO lineup provides excellent image quality 
but not much else. It has a built-in waterproof housing with a built-in battery. 
There’s not an accessory port, so you can’t add a monitor, extra battery pack or 
Wi-Fi, so there’s a little more guessing with this one since you can’t see what 
you’re shooting.

CHALLENGES IN USING A GOPRO
GoPro does so many things well, such as capturing HD video at a high frame rate and 
shooting high-quality time-lapse sequences, that it’s easy to forget that using it involves 
some challenges:
•	 Steep learning curve
•	 Lower quality in low light
•	 Short battery life
•	 Fixed focal length
•	 Few controls on camera.
•	 Lack of a viewfinder on most models, making it harder to compose the scene
•	 A lag of 2 to 3 seconds when you monitor a scene on a mobile device

22     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Setting Up Your GoPro
At first glance, the GoPro resembles a miniature version of an early 20th-century 
box camera or maybe the Instamatic still camera of the 1970s. Its design is simple: 
nothing more than a small box with a protruding lens, a few buttons, and a small 
LCD screen up front on most models.
One very important piece doesn’t come with the camera: the microSD card. Guess 
what? The camera won’t work without it. Ideally, you purchased one when you 
bought your GoPro. If not, get one before you set up your camera (see the next 
section).
Setting up your GoPro takes a few minutes (not counting battery-charging time) 
but is easy. Follow these steps:
1.	 Take off the GoPro’s protective waterproof housing.
(Skip to the next step if you’re using a HERO5 Black or Session.)
Like a turtle uses it shell for protection, so does the GoPro. But you need to 
take the GoPro out of its case to set it up. Pull the black latch on the top front 
of the camera. You’ll need to pull it back hard because it locks in place. Lift the 
latch and pull out the camera.
2.	 Put the battery in the camera.
(Skip to next step if you’re using a Session.)
Slide off the battery door, place the battery inside the camera, and put the 
door back on. The battery comes partially charged and can be used right out of 
the box, but it’s a good idea to charge it fully (see Step 4).
3.	 Load the microSD memory card.
Insert SD card on bottom door where battery is located. Push the tiny card into 
the card slot until it locks in place. If you’re using an older model, the door on 
the side of the camera slides off. Then slide the door back on.
4.	 Charge the camera.
Plug one end of the charger cable (the one with the mini USB plug) into the 
camera and the other end into your computer or USB power supply. While the 
camera is charging, the LED lights turn on; when the camera is fully charged, 
they go off. You can also use the optional GoPro Super Charger, which charges 
your HERO5 up to 70% faster with the USB-C cable. And you can charge your 
phone or other device at the same time.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     23
5.	 Power up the camera.
Press the Power/Mode button. The LED indicators blink, and the camera beeps 
three times.
6.	 Shoot some video.
Once your camera is charged, you’re ready to start recording. The video mode 
is the default mode when you turn on the camera. Press the Shutter/Select 
button to record video; press it again to pause it.
7.	 Take a still photo.
Press the Power/Mode button to find the Photo button, which looks like a 
camera. You can also pick other still-photo choices like Burst Photo and 
Time-Lapse, but more on that in Chapter 3.
Controlling Your GoPro
If you’re a first-time user, you’ll find that the GoPro differs from any other cam-
era you’ve operated. It can take some time to get used to the lack of a viewfinder 
on the Session (as well as some older models), the camera’s ultra-wide-angle 
lens, and its dependence on Wi-Fi.
The GoPro HERO5 has two buttons, one for shutter, and the other for mode. But it 
also has a touch screen monitor that provides intuitive access to camera functions, 
preview, and adjustments. You can also control the camera from a distance using 
the Capture app. The Session also has two buttons, shutter and a menu button.
Controlling the HERO4
The GoPro HERO4 has three buttons:
»
» Power/Mode: This button acts as both a power button and a means of cycling 
through camera modes and menus.
THERE’S ALWAYS A GOPRO CHARGER
Because the camera uses a USB mini connector, those old cell phone chargers used by 
BlackBerry and others work perfectly with charging the camera. So, take them out of the 
drawer when you need an AC charger for your camera. Newer models now come with a 
USB-C connector with a mini plug. Those need an adapter.

24     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
»
» Shutter/Select: Press this button to start and stop video recordings, take 
photos, and toggle among menu settings.
»
» Wi-Fi: To turn the camera’s Wi-Fi signal on or off, hold this button for three 
seconds. This button also allows you to enter the Settings menu, connect to 
the remote, or connect to smartphones and tablets via the Capture app.
Turning the camera off
Powering down your GoPro requires you to hold the Mode button for a few sec-
onds. Whatever you captured will be saved before the camera powers off.
Setting the date and time
Not setting the date and time on your camera would be the equivalent of not set-
ting the clock on a DVR. All your pictures, including the ones you took during the 
summer, would be dated January 1. While you can do it on the camera, the easiest 
way to do this is connect to the Capture app and it will sync automatically.
Syncing your GoPro
Your GoPro connects to your smartphone or device via Wi-Fi so that you can con-
trol the camera, clear the media card, and update its firmware when necessary. 
More important, the Capture app provides a comfortable way to use the camera 
because chances are you’re not always going to be that close to the action, and if 
you are, then you can concentrate on what you’re doing. You can read more about 
the Capture app later in the chapter.
Mounting Your GoPro
GoPro has a lot of mounts and one for every occasion and situation, as you see 
in Chapter 2. There are mounts for your ski pole, the roll bar of your all-terrain 
vehicle, and the top of your bicycle helmet. There’s even one that your dog can 
wear as a harness.
I mention GoPro mounts throughout the book, but I take a little time here to 
explain some of the key pieces (see Figure 1-10):

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     25
»
» Pivot arms: The pivot arms come in two varieties: straight and angled. You 
use them to put the camera farther from the mount or to rotate it. When you 
add an angled extension, it changes the mount by 90 degrees, so each one 
that you add turns the camera. You can add as many arms as you need, 
joining them with the thumbscrews that come in the GoPro package.
»
» Quick-release buckle: You get two of them, one of which is slightly larger and 
more flexible than the other. The pivot arms attach to many of the mounts as 
well as the quick-release buckle that locks into some of the mounts. When 
using the quick-release buckle, you just slide and clip, as shown.
»
» Double-stick base plates: One of the adhesive mounts that accommodates 
the quick-release buckle is flat, and the other is slightly curved. The quick-
release buckle can be used with either adhesive mount.
These plates are permanent, so be sure to put them where you want them to 
stay.
Even though the base-plate seal is somewhat permanent, you may have to 
wait a while for it to set and as much as 24 hours during cold weather. It’s 
possible to remove it with heat for reuse. A blow dryer works great.
Working with the Different GoPro Apps
The GoPro apps are the heart and soul of the operation, providing the means to 
control the camera, make a comprehensive edit, randomly assemble clips into a 
movie, or upload to social media. The app family includes the GoPro App for con-
trolling the camera, Splice, for serious video editing, and Quik, for automatically 
transforming clips and music into a movie.

26     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Downloading the software
The GoPro App is a free download away. Just go to Apple’s App Store or Google 
Play. You can find more information at http://gopro.com/apps.
Using the Capture App
The Capture app (see Figure 1-11) allows you to control the camera from a distance 
and monitor the scene. It also lets you wirelessly update camera firmware and 
get the latest features to maintain best performance. The app lets you control the 
camera and do more with your content than ever before, including sharing it over 
social media. It provides full remote control of all camera functions so you can 
start and stop your recording, adjust camera settings, or take a photo.
Live Preview (see Figure 1-12) lets you see what your camera sees for easy shot 
framing while capturing the scene. You can also play back video and view photos 
right on your smartphone.
Updating firmware on electronics isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s complicated and 
bothersome, and nobody wants to do it, so it doesn’t always get done. The Capture 
app, however, changes all that by allowing you to keep your camera up to date via 
Wi-Fi.
FIGURE 1-11: 
The Capture 
app

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     27
You can share your favorite video clips and photos via email, text, Instagram, 
Facebook, and other social networking sites. Although you can’t share directly 
from the camera, you can use the app on your smartphone or other mobile device 
to access the image files and then share them (see Figure 1-13). It’s a free down-
load at http://gopro.com.
Here is a quick list of the things it lets you do:
»
» Operate the camera from 50 feet away.
»
» Monitor the scene on your smartphone’s screen.
Don’t expect monitoring to be perfect. There’s a bit of lag time between the 
camera and your smartphone as much as a few seconds. To judge the delay, 
put your hand in front of the camera’s lens and then take it away, and see 
how long it takes for the change to appear on your smartphone.
»
» Control one camera or multiple cameras, with all the technical settings at your 
disposal.
FIGURE 1-12:

»
» Select the mode you want to capture.
»
» Start and stop video recording, take still photos, and do time-lapse 
photography.
»
» Erase a full memory card or delete just the last item captured.
One caveat: The app doesn’t work when the camera is underwater. You can still 
record by tapping the shutter before submerging the camera. Unfortunately, you 
won’t be able to monitor the scene.
Setting up the app
Here’s how you set up the app:
FIGURE 1-13:

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     29
1.	 Activate Wi-Fi on the camera by pressing the Wi-Fi button on the side.
The blue light blinks to show that Wi-Fi is activated.
2.	 Open the Capture app on your smartphone and then tap the Connect & 
Control button, shown in Figure 1-14.
3.	 If you see a No Cameras Connected warning, navigate to the Wi-Fi 
settings on your smartphone and make sure that the GoPro is selected.
Often, your home Wi-Fi network is selected by default on your phone, and you 
need to select the camera.
4.	 Control the camera.
Monitor the scene and make changes without ever touching the camera. You 
can change camera modes, adjust resolution settings, and access Protune 
settings on the Black Edition.
FIGURE 1-14: 
The Connect & 
Control button.

30     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Giving the app a test drive
Although using the Capture app is intuitive, giving it a test drive doesn’t hurt. 
Follow these steps:
1.	 Launch the Capture app.
2.	 Tap the Connect & Control button.
3.	 Tap the video icon.
By default, the video icon should be selected, but if it’s not, tap the icon that 
looks like a movie camera.
4.	 Point the camera at something, and check the scene on the monitor.
5.	 Make camera adjustments, if necessary.
Chapter 4 offers detailed explanations of how these features work.
6.	 Tap the red button to start recording video.
7.	 Tap the red button again to stop recording.
Editing on the fly
After capturing whatever situation strikes your fancy, you can quickly turn it into 
a movie on your smartphone. Splice lets you assemble a series of clips together, 
add titles and transitions, and even has a music library to give your movie the 
right pizazz. Another app can automatically make a movie with clips and music so 
quickly it’s called Quik.
Quik
If you’re looking for an automated approach to editing movies, the Quik app is 
perfect for you. Create edits in a matter of moments by transforming a few clips 
into a movie with choices for soundtrack loaded in the program, or simply choose 
a song that’s already on your device. Quik automatically analyzes the footage, puts 
it together, and synchs it to the beat of your soundtrack. The music can come from 
files on your phone. Quik will automatically make a movie for you by selecting 
your best clips of the week, and even add a soundtrack (see Figure 1-15).
Here’s an overview of what you — er, Quik — can do:
»
» Choose video styles: Pick the style of the movie. Each selection has its own 
set of filters, graphics, fonts, and transitions.

CHAPTER 1  Getting to Know GoPro     31
»
» Custom text overlays: Add captions, Identifications, and emojis to give your 
movie the right pizazz.
»
» Soundtrack library: Allows you to pick the perfect soundtrack for your movie. 
Whether it’s something from your own music library. Whatever soundtrack 
you use, the app quickly synchs the action to the beat of the music for a really 
awesome video, regardless that it was automatically variety.
»
» Automatic video creation: Once a week, Quik will surprise you with a produced 
movie from footage found on your mobile device over the past seven days.
»
» One–button posting: Just tap save and you can share video on a variety of 
social media sites including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. You can also 
save directly to your device or on the Cloud.
It’s great to perform a quick edit in the field and share it immediately from your 
app, but it’s a little more comfortable doing it from your computer. The desktop 
version of Quik provides the same easy operation when it comes to offloading files 
from your GoPro. Just connect the camera and the software automatically down-
loads your movies and photos to your drive. If you’re a GoPro Plus member, it will

32     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
upload directly to the Cloud, allowing you to access, view, and edit your content 
on any device wherever you are at the moment.
Splice
Splice brings the power of a desktop editing system to the convenience of your 
iPhone or iPad, so you can make pro-quality edits moments after you shoot them. 
You can easily add music, sound effects, and titles before uploading to a sharing 
site. (See Figure 1-16.)
Here’s what you’re able to do:
»
» Fully edit on your phone: Includes all you need to produce video clips. You 
can trim clips, crop the frame, as well as add titles and special effects.
»
» Great audio choices: Free music and sound effects allow you to overlay 
multiple tracks, adjust audio levels, or record a voiceover.
»
» Impressive outros: Lets you end your video in style.

T
hink about the potato for a second. The tuberous nightshade vegetable lacks 
the flavor that it has when it’s cooked and spiced. Well-prepared potatoes 
are a much-loved food source that sometimes we love too much (thank you 
very much, French fries) and at other times just enough (boiled potatoes, you 
know who you are).
In a strange way, GoPro alone has much in common with a potato. Just as you can 
eat a raw starchy potato by itself, you can use a GoPro without any accessories. 
You can still make great movies and pictures with it, but mounts and accessories 
enhance the experience for sure. This is especially true when it comes to putting 
the camera in unusual places as well as creating unique perspectives.
GoPro seems like quite the accessory hound, but it already includes the vital 
accessory: the waterproof housing. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. Dozens of 
other accessories allow you to blaze new trails and do either the wildest or most 
practical things you can imagine.
Playing the Media Card
It’s important to make sure you can capture the action by using the right media 
card. Just as your grandmother used the very best grated cheese for her lasagna, 
you should use a microSD card that’s optimized for video capture.
Chapter 2

34     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Not just any media card will do. Forget about capturing a continuous movie in 
high definition (HD) if you’re not using the right type, and if you have your heart 
set on capturing 4K video, the plot thickens. Capacity plays a big part (as you see 
in this section), but speed matters most.
Observing the speed limit
Because media cards have so many uses, the capacity of a card and the speed at 
which it transfers data will vary. Regardless of which kind of card you’re using, 
here’s a breakdown of the Speed Class Rating system, a system created by a con-
sortium of manufacturers. You can find more information at www.sdcard.org.
»
» Class 10: 10MB per second
»
» Ultra High Speed, Class 1: 10MB per second
»
» Ultra High Speed, Class 3: 30MB per second
»
» Video Speed Class: From 6–90MB per second
Checking card capacity
HD movie files are large, and the 4K ones are even bigger. That’s why it’s impor-
tant to have a large-capacity card so it doesn’t fill up sooner rather than later. 
Today, microSD cards continue to increase in capacity while going down in price. 
But sometimes the difference in price between using the right card and a slower 
one isn’t that much different. That’s why you should purchase the card based on 
its speed and storage, and not because of its cost.
Not all UHS cards are created equal. They represent the minimum speed require-
ment, so even cards from the same manufacturer differ in speed.
Here are transfer speeds for a few popular cards that you can use with your GoPro:
»
» Lexar 633x UHS I: This card comes in several sizes ranging from 32GB to 
200GB and offers a maximum transfer speed of 95MB per second.
»
» Samsung Pro Plus: This media card has capacity up to 128GB and transfer 
speed up to 95MB per second.
»
» SanDisk Extreme Pro: SanDisk’s Extreme Pro comes in two sizes: 64GB and 
128GB. This card is incredibly fast, with a write speed up to 100MB per 
second, and read speed up to 275MB per second.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     35
GoPro can capture 4K video, with four times as much detail as HD. With great 
quality, however, comes great size. Capturing 4K video requires a fast, high-
capacity card, because 4K takes up far more space than HD does. How much 
depends on the frame-rate setting. Regardless, 4K video is going to take up more 
than half of the capacity of the card, so a 32GB card with 4K video on it will hold 
less than a 16GB card would for the same amount of video capture.
Choosing the right card
The best type of card for you depends on what you’re trying to do and on your 
budget. Still-image capture requires less transfer speed than video does, so if you 
don’t have the fastest card, you can still get by. When you’re shooting HD movies, 
though, you need a card with a write speed that can keep up with movie capture. 
Using a low-speed card is like having slow workers on a factory assembly line; it 
makes the operation less efficient.
GoPro recommends SDHC cards with a minimum Class 10 rating. Slower cards, if 
you happen to come across them, will work, but they process moving images less 
efficiently. Also, there’s always a risk that a slower card will lag and stop record-
ing. Worse, you could lose data with a slow card. If you’re doing 4K, consider UHS 
Speed Class 3 cards for seamless capture. They’re the most expensive cards but are 
designed for the fastest transfer rates.
Managing media cards
Unlike calling a bald guy “Curly,” or a large person “Tiny,” there’s nothing ironic 
about a microSD card. They live up to their name as being a small media card. Not 
just small, but the kind of small that’ s easy to misplace in plain sight. Yet, it’s 
amazing how much data these little memory devices can hold. But it’s also pos-
sible to easily lose and misplace them because of this size, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Here are some suggestions to keep track of your cards.
»
» Always have a card in the camera: There are a few reasons for taking the card 
out of the camera, including to connect to a card reader or switch for a different 
size card. If you remove the card from the camera, be sure to put it back.
»
» Keep extra cards in their case: I cannot overemphasize that these cards are 
small and can easily get lost. And when you consider the cost of some of the 
bigger, faster ones, you have a lot to lose if you’re not careful.
»
» Delete after downloading: After you securely save the content of your card, 
purge the card. There’s nothing worse than being on an important shoot and 
running out of space because you have last summer’s water balloon fight still 
on the card.

36     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
»
» Format the card regularly: Think of it as “super” erasing the data on the card. 
Merely deleting files still leaves extraneous traces of data on the card, while 
formatting removes everything, allowing you to capture on a fresh data-free 
card. You don’t need to do it every time, but before each important shoot.
»
» Organize your cards: Don’t forget that “micro” in a microSD card means it’s 
small. That’s why it’s a great idea to store and organize it in a card caddy. If 
you don’t what to be so formal, a small box or a Ziploc bag can work for you.
Letting the GoPro Get Wet
One of the main reasons to buy a GoPro is to be able to take it into the sloppiest of 
conditions with little worry. You didn’t have that choice with other cameras. Taking 
a conventional camcorder through a swamp or shooting upward during a torrential 
rainstorm isn’t in that device’s best interest. Chances are that you’d burn it out. Most 
conventional cameras and especially the electronic ones don’t like the wet stuff.
Being able to go underwater makes the GoPro as refreshing as a cold glass of 
water or a swim on a hot summer day, and you can adequately capture each of 
those locations from the inside out. Isn’t it nice to have a camera that has the 
same tolerance for wet conditions as your diver’s wristwatch? Feel free to get it 
wet. One more thing; if you’re not using the HERO5 or Session, don’t take it in 
your bathtub without the waterproof housing, and make sure you don’t have the 
Skeleton backdoor on. That one’s not waterproof.
The HERO5 Black comes with an LCD screen that lets you view the scene on the 
camera under wet conditions. If you’re using an older model, you can attach the 
optional Touch BacPac.
FIGURE 2-1: 
The microSD 
card is as small 
as a dime.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     37
Using underwater accessories
If you’re looking to record underwater seascapes or artful pool pictures, GoPro 
lets you easily capture submerged scenes. Whether you’re using the new HERO5 
models, or a previous generation model, you can capture underwater scenes with 
relative ease and little worry.
The HERO5 Black comes with a built-in LCD screen making it possible to moni-
tor and frame the scene right out of the box. Previous versions are a little more 
challenging, when it comes to viewing the scene. Normally, you would monitor 
the scene with your smartphone (see Chapter 1), but that’s not feasible for under-
water recording because of the whole water-is-wet thing. So, there’s a little more 
guessing involved. Of course, you could also attach the optional Touch BacPac 
(see the next section) on most HERO models, Session excluded. The Touch BacPac 
allows you to monitor the scene from the back of the camera, but it’s submersible 
only to shallow depths, and the touch panel won’t work underwater.
Here are some accessories to consider for underwater recording:
»
» Antifog inserts: These inserts drop into the camera’s housing to prevent 
fogging in cold and humid environments. You can reuse them several times 
by drying them out in a 300°F oven for 5 minutes.
»
» A big media card: You can’t change the card underwater (or anywhere that’s 
even slightly moist, for that matter), so it’s a good idea to use the biggest one 
you can afford.
»
» Color-correction filters: Underwater scenes are beautiful, but they have blue 
or green casts. An optional color-correction filter in red or magenta can 
reduce or eliminate the cast.
»
» Floaty Backdoor: This accessory attaches to the back of the camera and 
keeps it afloat in case you accidentally let go of it while taking an underwater 
selfie (see Figure 2-2). Any time you play in the water, there’s a risk that the 
camera will take more of a plunge than you’d like. Thanks to this bright-orange 
back, however, you’ll have no problem spotting it in the water.
»
» Dive Housing: The waterproof housing that comes with the camera works 
well for most underwater situations, but if you want to take the camera 
deeper, consider this housing. It’s more durable than the standard model and 
is waterproof to 197 feet (60m). The kit includes Standard, Skeleton, and 
BacPac backdoors. Its increased durability makes it perfect for more serious 
diving encounters. And its glass lens delivers optimal sharpness in and out 
of the water. While the HERO5 Black is already waterproof to 33 feet, to go 
deeper requires the optional Dive Housing.
»
» The Handler: The handgrip provides stability when holding the camera. It’s great 
for use in and out of the water, and will float if you accidentally drop the camera.

38     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
»
» Scuba mask: The GoMask is a cool third-party accessory that lets you wear 
the camera on your face while snorkeling or scuba diving so you can see what 
you’re capturing.
»
» Video lights: You can get a complete light system that mounts on a rack with 
your GoPro and provides up to 900 lumens of illumination for densely lit 
underwater scenes.
Going deep
GoPro plays equally well in and out of the water, with the HERO5 Black and 
HERO5 Session no longer requiring a waterproof housing. Previous models come 
with a waterproof housing that can withstand depths of up to 131 feet (40 m). 
For these models, you can leave the housing on the camera when you’re using it 
for non-water-based fun. (You need it for some mounting options, because they 
attach to the housing. But I’m talking about waterproof situations in this section.)
Two backdoors come with your GoPro (except for the HERO5): The Skeleton, 
which provides good sound quality, and Standard, which is waterproof.
Make sure that you have the Standard backdoor on when you use your GoPro 
underwater, because much like the name implies, the Skeleton isn’t waterproof.
Here are the maximum depths your GoPro can reach with a couple of other 
accessories:
FIGURE 2-2:

­Backdoor is

when taking

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     39
»
» HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session: Both waterproof on their own to depths 
up to 33 feet (10 m). The optional Dive Housing lets you go deeper.
»
» Dive Housing: This accessory increases the GoPro’s depth rating to 197 feet 
(60 m) for HERO5 Black.
»
» Touch BacPac Backdoor: Although it lets you monitor the scene from the 
camera back, you can’t use it deeper than 10 feet (3 m).
Checking your camera before getting it wet
Anytime you plan to take your GoPro in or near the water you need to be sure 
everything is correctly set before you place the camera near water. (See Figure 2-3). 
So, before taking it for a dip consider the following:
»
» Have enough room on the microSD card: Remember, if you run out of 
storage, you can’t change cards in the water.
»
» Make sure it’s clean: Not only do they say it’s next to godliness, but keeping 
the glass in front of the lens clean will assure you capture clear and sharp 
images. The Anti-Fog inserts can help here.
»
» A test case: This applies to older models that require a waterproof housing. 
Yeah, it makes the camera waterproof, but isn’t it nice to be reassured? So, 
without the GoPro inside, close it up and submerge in water, as seen in 
Figure 2-3. After a brief soak, dry the outside completely before opening and see 
if it’s wet inside. Also, make sure the camera is fully sealed: Push the housing 
backdoor all the way in before securing the black latch on the top of the case.
»
» Rinse off salt water: If you’re going to take it to the beach, on a dive, or any 
situation involving salt water, it’s always a good idea to rinse the camera and 
accessories with fresh cool water. The salt can get caught in the case and around 
the lens, causing rust on the metal parts and a salty coating over the lens.
Remo (waterproof voice-activated remote)
Not only can you command your GoPro HERO5 with your own words, but you can 
do it from a distance using the optional Remo voice-activated remote. Don’t worry 
if you’re in or near the water, since the remote is waterproof, just like your GoPro. 
And if you don’t feel like talking, it acts as a one-button remote.
Here’s the lowdown on what it can do:
»
» Works from a distance: You can be up to 32-feet (10m) away from the 
camera and command it to capture the scene.

40     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
»
» Wear it: Much like a brooch, you can talk to Remo from your lapel (or any 
place else on your clothing) or a wristwatch, and wear Remo with the included 
clip and wrist housing.
»
» Easy commands: Understands 13 commands that allow you to shoot video, 
take still photos, and change settings.
»
» Enhances camera use: Even when GoPro is close to you, Remo helps 
enhance the voice control when the conditions are noisy or windy.
»
» Waterproof: Not only can you use it in the water while swimming, surfing, or 
doing whatever you like to do in the water, the HERO5 is also waterproof up to 
16 feet.
»
» Multi-lingual: Can understand 10 languages, including English, Italian, 
Japanese, Chinese, and German.
Keeping the Shot Steady
The ability to place your GoPro almost anywhere makes it a pretty remarkable 
camera. But to capture all that action and those cool perspectives with little worry, 
you need to keep the camera steady. The GoPro isn’t like any other camera; it’s 
tiny and, except for two models (the HERO5 Black and HERO4 Silver), it doesn’t 
have a viewfinder. Holding it in your hand to take a picture or make a movie is the 
textbook definition of haphazard, because you can’t see what you’re shooting or 
hold the camera comfortably.
FIGURE 2-3: 
When using 
a HERO4 or 
older model,

to make sure 
the housing is 
water-tight.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     41
You can mount a GoPro on a tripod or on any of the dozens of mounts designed 
for the GoPro. In this section, I give you an abridged tour of some exotic and basic 
mounts.
Mounting your GoPro out of the box
When you take the camera out of the box, you’ll notice that it comes with some 
hardware:
»
» The Frame: Also includes Mounting Buckle & Long Thumb Screw.
»
» Flat adhesive mount: Makes it easy to connect your GoPro to any clean, flat 
surface. When the camera is attached to the quick-release buckle, it slides 
right into the mount.
»
» Curved adhesive mount: Looks a little like the flat mount but is designed for 
curved surfaces.
Using a tripod (with an adapter)
For a good part of the camera’s 200-year history, the tripod has been the photog-
rapher’s best friend when it comes to keeping the camera steady and composing 
the scene. For almost as long, cameras have had a standard socket for attaching to 
a tripod. Yep, the three-legged amigo has made all the difference between crisply 
shot movies and a shaky mess.
One problem with the GoPro is that it doesn’t have a tripod socket on its bottom, so 
there’s no built-in way to secure the camera to a tripod. No worries. You can still 
mount it with a special accessory that attaches to your GoPro and provides a stan-
dard tripod socket. This accessory also has a quick-release mount that allows you 
to move the camera conveniently between shots and locations. The GoPro looks 
comfortable when mounted on a flexible GorillaPod, for example (see Figure 2-4).
Getting Framed
When using an older model GoPro, you can leave the camera in its waterproof hous-
ing for most situations, but sometimes you may want to shoot outside of the case. The 
Frame comes standard with the HERO5 models, as well as being a cool accessory for 
older models. It allows you to place the camera in a frame, as the name implies. The 
open design delivers optimal audio capture, providing it’s not an activity that puts 
the camera too close to the noise. The integrated latch makes removing your GoPro 
from the Frame quick and easy. You also have open access to the camera’s microSD, 
Micro HDMI, and USB ports for easy data offload, live-feed video, and charging.

42     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Here are some reasons for using it:
»
» Not bulky: Because it fits around the camera, it doesn’t add size to the 
camera like the waterproof housing.
»
» Better audio capture: Because the microphone is not obscured by the case, 
you get the clearest sound reproduction.
»
» No waterproof housing needed: Provides immediate access to camera ports 
for downloading data and live-feed video.
»
» Protective glass lens: Prevents the camera lens from getting dirty or scratched.
»
» Extendable support arm: Lets you easily attach accessories like the LCD 
Touch BacPac or Battery BacPac.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     43
Choosing your mounts wisely
There’s a mount specific to whatever you’re looking to do with your GoPro, from 
surfing, skateboarding, playing music, or wearing it like a fashion accessory.
Using suction cups
When you think of mounting your camera with suction cups, secure placement 
isn’t the first thing that comes to mind. The first thing is “I hope it stays on,” as 
you worry that the cup will lose suction and the camera will fall off.
Not gonna happen. The industrial-strength suction cup mounts attach the camera 
to almost any flat, clean surface and even the hood of a moving car, as seen in 
­Figure 2-5. How reliable are they? These mounts have been engineered to with-
stand a broad range of motion at speeds more than 150 mph. It’s a good idea for 
your GoPro to be in its waterproof housing to provide extra protection.
Using the Jaws Flex Clamp
“Jaws Flex Clamp” sounds like a sequel to the shark thriller, but this accessory 
lets you attach your GoPro to anything it can bite . . . er, clip. The mighty little 
clamp lets you attach the camera to a variety of objects up to 2 inches thick. You 
can mount the camera directly on the clamp, or attach it to the optional gooseneck 
to accommodate a wider range of camera angles.
FIGURE 2-5: 
It’s easy to 
securely

suction cup to

hood.

44     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
2-Way
You can use this mount, shown in Figure 2-6, in three ways: as an extension arm, 
camera grip (when detached from the arm), and tripod. This cool mount expands 
to 20 inches and collapses to 7.5 inches, and it’s waterproof, making it perfect for 
traveling, hiking, or for selfies and group shots. You can even use it in and under 
the water.
Handlebar/Seat Post/Pole Mount
It’s basically a bar mount. No, not the kind for capturing a movie at your favorite 
watering hole, though it’s entirely possible to put one of these mounts around a 
beer tap or stool leg. This mount allows you to attach your GoPro to just about any 
kind of tube with a diameter of 22.2mm to 35mm (.9 to 1.4 inches) and bicycle 
handlebars and seat posts are the more popular choices. So you can get views both 
coming and going. But that’s not all, as you can use it on any other tube it fits. And 
did I mention that it also rotates 360° for unlimited capture options? Well it does.
Put the camera on the handlebars on your bike or motorcycle, or a windsurfer or 
ski pole. Mount it on any pole that it will fit.
Pro Seat Rail Mount
Let’s you hang the camera on back of your bicycle seat to capture a rear-facing 
camera perspective. (See Figure 2-6.)
Large Tube Mount
This hinged mount is perfect for thicker bars  – you know, those from 1.4 to  
2.5 inches in diameter. This covers vehicle frames, like on go-karts, as well as 
cars with roll bars. But it attaches to so much more, like a soccer goal, kayak oar, 
bicycle frames, and any other tube it fits. With a push of a button, its integrated 
base allows you to rotate to 16 locked positions for 360° versatility.
Swivel Mount
The GoPro version of the ball-head mount provides a great deal of flexibility 
when it comes to orienting the camera. Instead of using the articulation arms that 
come with the camera, this mount uses a ball and socket that freely moves and 
can be locked into any position you decide.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     45
Gun/Rod/Bow Mount
Easily attach your GoPro to sporting equipment such as a fishing rod, hunting 
rifle, bow or just about anything with a diameter of 0.4 to 0.9 inch. This multipur-
pose mount has a matte black finish to eliminate glare, and it’s compatible with 
most rifles, paintball guns, and revolvers. It also fits your fishing rod and bow 
components. You can also mount a second camera to capture both front-facing 
and rear-facing perspectives.
Musical mounts
Almost since the beginning of photography, musical performances have been 
captured from the outside, and the resulting footage often has a two-dimensional 
appearance. Musicians don’t want a clunky camera intruding in their performance 
space. But the GoPro can go where other cameras can’t, thanks to a few mounts 
specifically designed for music:

»
» Microphone-stand mount: This dandy little device transforms a microphone 
stand into a tripod of sorts. It’s compatible with standard microphone stands 
when you use the included adapter. It comes with a quick-release base that 
allows you to move the camera between mounts and locations.
»
» Instrument mount: If you’re looking to get a little closer to the action, opt for 
a removable instrument mount, which allows you to attach your GoPro to a 
guitar, bass, drums, or keyboard. You can even mount it on a turntable, if 
spinning vinyl is your jam. These temporary mounts have non-damaging 
adhesive that’s safe for most instrument surfaces. The kit includes three 
mounts (reusable) and two single-use adhesive strips.
»
» The Arm: Allows you to mount your GoPro to almost anything, including this 
guitar, as seen in Figure 2-7. It can be used on guitar headstocks, keyboards, 
horns, or any other instrument you can clamp it on.

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     47
Wearing Your GoPro
First, the fashion was skinny jeans; then it was iridescent shoe soles; now it’s 
wearing the GoPro like a fashion accessory. Perhaps the only fashionable aspect of 
wearing a GoPro is the ability to capture great video with an interesting perspec-
tive. Regardless of the trends of the day, great video is always in vogue.
GoPro offers a bunch of wearable mounting options that may not improve your 
attire but can certainly make your movies look better by showing a truly POV 
perspective (see Figure 2-8). POV stands for point of view, and it’s yours that the 
viewer will see.
Why wear your GoPro? Because you can. More important, it’s more feasible to 
mount the camera than to try to hold it. For one thing, your hands are a little too 
big for it. That makes taking pictures or shooting movies not much different from 
going to your 5-year-old niece’s tea party with her dolls and drinking out of those 
tiny cups.
Another dilemma in holding the camera is that the angle of view is so wide, it’s 
easy to get your hands, nose, or other parts of your body in the shot and because 
most models lack a viewfinder, you won’t know until it’s too late. That problem is 
exacerbated when you try to use your smartphone to view and realize that you’re 
a hand short. For those times when handholding is necessary, consider using the 
Touch Display (if your GoPro has it) or the optional LCD Touch BacPac; both allow 
you to monitor the scene on the camera.

48     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
The following sections cover a few accessories that can help you use your GoPro 
hands-free.
Headband mount
If you want to capture video from the perspective of what you’re seeing and want 
to look something like a coal miner too, this mount is for you. The fully adjustable 
strap allows you to attach the camera to your head or a helmet to capture footage 
from a headlamp-like perspective. Thanks to its design, you can also put it on a 
baseball cap.
Helmet mounts
Helmet mounts come in several configurations. If you’re going to use this mount 
while riding a bicycle or motocross bike, always select a helmet that meets the 
applicable safety standard when you use it with a GoPro helmet mount.
GoPro offers several helmet mounts, including these:
»
» Helmet mount: Whether you take your GoPro on a motorcycle ride down a 
country road or zip down a windy trail on your mountain bike, this mount 
allows you to record the view from atop your head, as shown in Figure 2-9. 
The camera sits on the helmet like a headlamp, letting you capture forward-
facing footage. You can adjust the extendable arm so that the camera faces 
you for self-portrait videos and photos.
FIGURE 2-9:

mount lets 
you capture 
forward-facing

CHAPTER 2  Accessorize Me     49
This mount uses a special adhesive that can be removed only by heat from  
a hair dryer.
»
» Vented-helmet mount: Instead of using adhesive to hold the camera in 
place, this mount uses straps to attach the camera to any vented sports 
helmet. The adjustable strap makes mounting the camera quick and easy.
»
» Helmet front and side mount: You can do more than just attach your GoPro 
to the side of a helmet with this mount. It also works well on vehicles and 
other moving objects. Three-way adjustability makes aiming the camera easy.
»
» Night-vision mount: This mount allows you to attach your GoPro to a helmet 
that includes a mounting plate for Night Vision Goggles.
Chest harnesses, or the Chesty!
Sometimes when you’re in the middle of the action, it’s nice to hold the GoPro 
near and dear to your heart, literally. The Chesty lets you wear the camera on your 
chest. Basically, it looks like suspenders with a camera in the middle.
This harness comes in two sizes:
»
» Chesty M-XXL: This harness makes it easy to capture immersive video and 
photos, as shown in Figure 2-10. One benefit of using this type of mount is 
that you can include more of your body in the frame. It’s perfect for immers-
ing yourself in your favorite activities, such as mountain biking, motocross, 
skiing, or paddle sports. You’ll capture more of your arms, knees, and maybe 
face (when you lean in). It’s fully adjustable to fit a wide range of adult sizes.
»
» Chesty XS-S: This smaller version of the Chesty is perfect for smaller humans. 
It lets them have fun with the GoPro when they’re playing on slides and 
swings, or skateboarding or bicycling.
Fetch (dog harness)
For too many years, our fine-feathered friends have gotten credit for the shot that 
looks down on the situation. Well, move over bird’s-eye view and make way for 
the dog’s life view. Think of the Fetch as the canine version of the Chesty, allow-
ing you to record the world as seen from the back of your dog. You can use it on 
any dog between 20 and 120 pounds. Just make sure the dog is never left alone, 
and not just because she will claim credit for the footage.

50     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
The Strap
The Strap lets you wear the camera on more than your wrist to capture hands-free 
footage from your arm or wrist. It allows you to capture 360° for unique POV foot-
age or some of the coolest selfies. Ideal for numerous activities and fully adjust-
able to fit whatever limb works for you, the Strap is one of our most versatile 
mounts for your GoPro. (See Figure 2-11)

Putting Your GoPro on a Drone
Flying your camera above some scenic area to make movies or take photographs 
was once as much of a fantasy as having a pet unicorn or owning a time machine. 
But alas, it’s true. The drone, or quadcopter as it’s sometimes called, has been on 
the scene for a few years now, and many have even supported GoPro as a worthy 
passenger. But GoPro has taken it further, entering the fray with Karma, a drone 
specifically designed for putting your GoPro high in the sky.
It’s all about Karma
GoPro has simplified the idea of flying your HERO from above. More than a drone, 
this vessel centers around the Karma Stabilizer, which is a stabilization device 
that attaches to the drone itself, as well as allowing you to hold it by hand, much 
like a steady cam does in movie production. That means you can capture incred-
ibly steady footage from the air or when held in your hand, despite how much 
motion is going on around the camera. The Karma works with current GoPro 
models, including the HERO4 and HERO5 models.
Here’s what comes in the box:
»
» Karma Drone: Sleeker than other drones on the market, this one is made 
specifically for GoPro.
»
» Karma Controller: More than a remote, this video-game style device allows 
you to control and view the flight of your drone. Want more? The GoPro 
Passenger App lets you share flight monitoring with friends while you’re flying.
»
» Karma Grip: Helps you get smooth video whether it’s on the drone or you 
take it off and hold it by hand and use it as stabilization system on the ground.
»
» Karma Stabilizer and Harness: The harness holds your GoPro and the 
stabilizer attaches to the Karma to keep it steady to produce smooth shake-
free video.
»
» Battery and Charger: All-in-one charger provides up to 20 minutes of flight 
on a one-hour charge.
»
» Propellers: Sometimes they’re the first victims in an altercation. No worries, six 
replacements come in the box. And they’re color-coded for easy installation.
»
» Mounting Ring: Use it to attach Karma Grip to GoPro mounts.
»
» Case: A durable weather-resistant case that’s perfect for carrying your Karma 
and all the necessary accessories. You can also fit the Karma drone in Seeker, 
the GoPro backpack.

52     PART 1  Getting Started with Your GoPro Camera
Adding Some Other Cool Accessories
Not every accessory is for mounting your GoPro. Some accessories also enhance 
the camera’s operation. Whether it’s housing the camera with a more appropri-
ate solution, making sure you have enough battery power to capture an event, or 
needing to see what you’re doing from the camera’s perspective, these accessories 
can help accomplish that task.
Keeping your GoPro charged
Your GoPro HERO camera offers amazing results while it’s powered up, but unfor-
tunately, the power doesn’t last forever. Battery life is less than two hours, which 
can pose a problem when you’re out in the field. That’s why it’s a good idea to 
have an extra battery or a portable charger with you.
Here are a few other accessories that can keep your GoPro powered longer:
»
» Dual-battery charger: This device lets you charge two batteries at the same 
time and is USB-compatible. LED indicator lights display the charging status of 
both batteries.
»
» Super charger (Wall charger): The wall charger lets you connect your camera 
via USB directly to an AC outlet for fast charging. You can record while charging, 
essentially plugging the camera into a continuous power source.
»
» Portable Power Pack:
»
» Battery BacPac: For situations that require longer continuous service from 
the camera, you should consider using the Battery BacPac. This helpful 
accessory attaches to the back of the camera to extend battery life. Charge it 
through your computer or a wall charger. The LCD window displays battery 
level and charging status.
»
» Auto charger: This device allows you to charge up to two cameras in your car.

Getting through GoPro 
Boot Camp
I
f you buy a GoPro camera and expect to use it the way you do a video camcorder 
or a point-and-shoot camera, you quickly find out that this camera doesn’t 
respond well to convention. It’s like a beat poet speaking at a 19th-century 
French literature seminar: Much will get lost in translation. Yet footage captured 
on a GoPro has been used in all sorts of conventional capacities, from feature films 
and television shows to sports and news coverage. You just have to understand 
that it behaves differently from the cameras you’re used to using. Sometimes, 
success begins with putting everything you know on the back burner.
Before you can shoot successfully with your GoPro, however, you have to know 
how it works. In this chapter, I show you the fundamentals of working with a 
GoPro.
Viewing the Lens
If you were playing the “obvious game,” the first thing you might say about the 
GoPro is that the lens is wide (see Figure 3-1). Really wide. A lens this wide is a 
luxury, and when you realize that it’s connected to an affordable camera, it seems 
more like a luxurious gift.
Chapter 3

56     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Yes, this camera offers you boundless creative choices, especially when you’re 
playing with perspective. Still, it’s possible to get into trouble with a camera that 
lacks a viewfinder. Shooting without monitoring the shot isn’t much different 
than drawing in the dark. Both will produce an image, but rarely the way you 
intended.
Like everything else, the GoPro’s lens has pros and cons. Here are the pros:
»
» Fits in tight spaces: With such a wide angle of view, you can include every-
thing in the shot.
»
» Has great depth of field: The wider the lens, the more of the scene that 
appears in focus. Because GoPro is really wide, so is the amount of focus in 
the scene.
»
» Gets really close to the subject: You can use this camera in the tightest of 
places.
And here are the cons:
»
» Records a pretty wide view: Sometimes it’s possible to “under” lens the 
scene by having too expansive of a view. Even with different settings, the view 
is still very wide if you’re not close enough.
»
» Can’t control focus: The camera has no focus control.
FIGURE 3-1: 
While only a 
few feet away

this ultra-wide- 
angle-lens

entire scene.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     57
»
» No viewfinder: That means you cannot monitor the scene on the camera and 
therefore judge the view of the lens.
»
» Produces geometric warping (better known as distortion).
Getting up close and very personal
The GoPro is meant to work in close quarters, so it’s most comfortable mere inches 
from the subject. Thanks to that wide lens, the camera is great for tight, confined 
areas. Because the field of view is so wide, the sense of depth expands, and objects 
in the distance appear to be much smaller and farther away. You can position your 
GoPro inches from the subject and still get a full view. Whether you’re capturing 
a bizarre perspective of a street scene or looking to uniquely show the person in 
his or her environment, getting close to your subject with this camera provides a 
fresh look at the world.
Here are some situations that are great for your GoPro:
»
» Shooting in tight spaces: You can capture almost everything that’s in front of 
the camera, such as a small room, the interior of a stock car, or the inside of 
one of those red British phone booths.
»
» Shooting people: The GoPro is great for scenes showing the subject in his 
environment. Of course, you’ll need to be careful with distortion or he can end 
up looking like a bobble head, and not always the good kind.
»
» Capturing street scenes: The camera matches your periphery of view, so you 
can capture scenes with both an expansive and personal feel.
»
» Showing relationships: Shows relationships in size and distance between 
objects in the foreground and background.
»
» Providing an uncommon view of common objects: Subjects can include 
geometric shapes, billowy clouds in the sky, and very unusual angles (see 
Figure 3-2).
Taking advantage of SuperView
Here’s an irony: The GoPro, known for capturing high-definition (HD) and 4K 
video, uses a 4:3 image sensor — a square-ish one that resembles the ratio used 
by old television sets. It’s not uncommon for a widescreen camera to use a 4:3 
sensor, but it’s rare to take advantage of all that space on the sensor.

58     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
The GoPro takes advantage of the sensor through its SuperView mode. This new 
feature combines the best of both worlds by recording the scene with the full 
sensor vertical resolution of 1440 pixels (p) and then squishing it down to 1080p.
This feature is designed for situations in which you want more vertical resolution 
than horizontal, such as using the GoPro as a follow or point-of-view camera. The 
resulting image plays back at a 16:9 ratio but shows more of the scene. The image 
is slightly unrealistic, as shown in Figure 3-3, mainly because parts of the scene 
appear to be squished.
Here’s what you can expect:
»
» Immersive wide-angle perspective: Shows a more inclusive view.
»
» Distorts shapes: Makes a round object appear slightly oblong and tall objects 
slightly shorter.
»
» Produces more distortion: Compared with normal 1080p 16:9 video, shows 
more distortion at the top and bottom of the screen.
Keeping the lens clean in messy situations
A camera that you can use anywhere — even submerged in water or mud — lets 
you do a lot of awesome stuff, as Figure 3-4 shows. But although the camera case 
is waterproof, the lens cover on the waterproof housing isn’t self-cleaning like 
your oven. You have to wipe it constantly; otherwise, many of your cool shots will 
be taken with goop on the lens.
FIGURE 3-2:

than one foot

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     59
Here are a few pointers for keeping the lens clean:
»
» Clean the case, not the lens. It’s much safer and easier to clean the glass  
on the case than to clean the actual lens. Just use a microfiber cloth and 
rub gently.
»
» Don’t scrub. All it takes to scratch the lens is one scrubbed-in speck of dirt.  
So never scrub the case, let alone the camera lens.
»
» Wipe the lens housing before you shoot. Nothing is worse than capturing 
the greatest footage of your life, only to find that you had dirt on the lens.
»
» Use a blower brush on the actual lens. Use a blower brush to clean the 
camera lens. It’s just not worth scratching the lens with a cloth, especially 
because that scratch will appear in all your movies and images later.

60     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Mastering Protune
Although a GoPro camera can do amazing stuff, it still behaves like a point-and- 
shoot camera. You have little power when it comes to focus and exposure, so you 
need to live with the footage that the camera captures. Most of the time, the cam-
era renders the scene accurately, but if you’re an advanced user looking for a little 
more control, consider using Protune mode.
Here are some of the benefits of turning it on:
»
» High-quality image capture: When you turn on Protune, the high data 
increases, so you capture images with less compression, and ultimately 
better quality.
»
» Neutral color: More accurately, it’s flatter to provide flexibility during 
post-production color correction. It also captures more detail in shadows  
and highlights.
»
» Film/TV frame-rate standard: Offers more choices for image capture, 
including the cinema-quality 24 frames per second (fps) setting.
»
» Compatibility with other effects: Activating Protune provides more control 
over camera settings such as resolution and frame rate, which can affect field 
of view. You can also simultaneously capture video and still images.
»
» Control over still photography: Protune also provides more control over 
your photographs.
FIGURE 3-4: 
While 
­capturing this 
portrait, I had 
to keep wiping 
water off the 
lens housing.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     61
Seeing how it works
Protune puts a little more power in your hands. For one thing, image quality 
improves because it increases the data rate by more than double. That reduces 
image compression, thus reducing or eliminating imperfections in the video, such 
as artifacting. Examples of artifacting include jagged edges, showing blocks of 
­pixels, and posterization.
Protune also offers advanced controls. You have a little more control of your 
­footage when you can alter settings such as white balance, exposure, field of view, 
and color.
In addition, Protune lets you shoot at a more cinema-friendly 24 frames per sec-
ond (fps). It’s not that big a deal for most video shooters, but when you intend to 
match GoPro footage with other footage captured at 24 fps, such as for a movie, 
the function is invaluable.
Enabling Protune on your GoPro
Casual users probably won’t want to or need to reap the benefits of Protune. But 
if you’re looking for more quality and better control, you may want to turn it on.
To do so, follow these steps:
1.	 With your GoPro powered up, navigate to the Settings menu.
Press the Power/Mode button to cycle through menus until you reach the 
Settings menu, the one with the wrench icon.
2.	 Press the Shutter/Select button to select it.
3.	 Press the Power/Mode button to cycle through settings until you reach 
Protune.
4.	 Select Protune by pressing the Shutter/Select button.
Make sure that the Protune slider is in the on position on the app.
CAMERA RAW SETTINGS
It’s a format that uses minimal processing on the image, so that you can manually apply 
aspects like color correction, sharpness, saturation, and others to make precise adjust-
ments that meet your specific needs. You need to apply these settings in a RAW conver-
sion program, and then export in a file format such as TIFF or JPEG.

62     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Setting Protune controls
You can select Protune by going to the Settings menu (the wrench icon) either 
through the camera or the Capture app. Protune consists of a group of features 
that let you fine-tune GoPro capture. Adjusting your Protune settings won’t affect 
non-Protune video modes. You can reset your Protune settings to their default 
states.
Following are some of the powerful settings you can adjust with Protune.
White balance
You can access this setting through the Protune menu. The icon resembles two 
triangles looking to catch a small rectangle. White balance adjusts the color tem-
perature between the actual color of the scene and the way your camera records it. 
By default, white balance on your GoPro is set to Auto, which works well in most 
situations. If you want to control the color temperature, however, you can set the 
white balance manually with several presets (see Figure 3-5):
»
» 3000K: Comes close to the color temperature of indoor lighting.
»
» 5500K: Matches the color of daylight.
»
» 6500K: Matches the tone of an overcast day.
»
» Camera Raw: Doesn’t apply any white-balance setting, so it’s pretty much 
native out of the camera.
FIGURE 3-5: 
This image 
sequence was 
shot late in 
the afternoon 
and shows 
the following 
white balance 
settings: Auto, 
3000K, 5500K, 
and 6500K.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     63
ISO settings
This setting alters the sensitivity of the sensor. For shooting outdoors, you should 
set the camera to ISO 400, which allows you to adequately capture outdoor scenes 
with enough light. This setting also captures the scene with the least amount 
of noise.
When you choose to shoot at dawn or dusk, however, or maybe indoors, you may 
not have enough light to render the scene properly. To capture a brighter image, 
you need to bump it up a little bit by increasing the sensitivity of the sensor, which 
you do by raising the ISO setting. The good news is that you can capture the scene 
with better exposure. The bad news is that the improved exposure comes at the 
expense of quality: You’ll have noise and grain in the image.
It’s a good idea to keep the camera set at the default ISO 400 and make adjust-
ments when you need more light. That way, you can consistently produce clean 
video.
Here are the ISO settings for video capture:
»
» 400: The default setting provides the best image quality in normal light 
conditions, such as on a bright sunny day. When you use it in lower light 
levels, your video will be darker than normal.
»
» 800: When there is a little less light, such as in shady areas or brightly lit indoor 
illumination, this setting provides the best combination between acceptable 
exposure and low image noise.
»
» 1600: Ideal for situations where the light levels are not very bright, or for 
action scenes where you want the camera to choose a higher shutter speed to 
freeze the action, this setting produces slightly more image noise but is still 
within acceptable range. Make sure that you set it back to 400 when shooting 
in bright light.
»
» 3200: Scenes that consist of very low light levels, such as dusk, a dimly lit 
room — or for times when you want the camera to catch a higher shutter 
speed to capture crisp action — benefit from this setting. Of course, it comes 
at the expense of increased image noise.
»
» 6400: Use this setting when light levels are very low, such as darker areas at 
dusk or a sparsely-lit interior (but with increased image noise).

64     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Protune ISO settings for still images
In Protune, you can also set ISO settings for still photography. The default setting 
is at ISO 800, but you can set lower ISO settings with less image noise in 400, 200, 
and 100.
Sharpness
Like most digital cameras, the GoPro adds digital sharpness after capturing footage 
to give it the appearance of being sharper. By default, it applies high sharpness 
to the image, but you can change that setting in Protune to medium or low. The 
footage will appear softer. You can always enhance it in postproduction, reminis-
cent of the Camera Raw setting on your DSLR (digital single lens reflex camera). 
Having control of the footage plays a big part in the look of your movie. You can 
adjust all these settings on the camera or in the Capture app on your smartphone 
(see Figure 3-6).
You can choose one of three settings:
»
» High: The default setting applies a great deal of sharpness to the scene. 
Sometimes it looks fake. That’s because sharpness is added (along with other 
settings) while the image is being processed after you capture it.
»
» Medium: This setting is still sharp but provides a bit more realistic appear-
ance to some situations.

ness and can

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     65
»
» Low: This setting captures video with the least amount of sharpness but 
provides the most flexibility in postproduction.
Color
By default, your camera is set to GoPro Color, which is vibrant and saturated, and 
makes the video look great. When you’re trying to match what you shot on your 
GoPro with footage captured with another camera, it’s harder to match the color.
If you change the setting to Flatter Color, you can do more in postproduction, 
especially when you’re looking to match footage. If not, the GoPro Color setting 
works well.
Exposure compensation
Exposure compensation provides a little more control by telling the camera  
to adjust exposure above or below the normal automatic exposure setting. 
­Figures 3-7, 3-8, and 3-9 show variations in exposure compensation. You can see 
how greatly they differ. You can adjust brightness only within the existing ISO 
limit. If brightness has already reached the ISO limit in a low-light environment, 
increasing it won’t have any effect. Exposure adjustments over a two-stop range 
in half-stop increments can be used to under or overexpose the scene.

66     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Resolution
Protune gives you access to more resolutions and frame rates. While the HERO5 
Black provides the most variations (see Table  3-1), other models offer a wide 
range of choices.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     67
Non-Protune capture settings
Non-Protune settings include the following:
»
» Camera Orientation: This setting lets you shoot the scene upside down, 
eliminating the need to rotate the video in postproduction. That means you 
are free to mount the camera and not have to worry about orientation.
»
» Spot Meter: This setting allows the camera’s automatic exposure to base 
exposure on a much smaller portion of the scene. Use Spot Meter when 
you’re capturing scenes in dark spaces with bright lighting, which can 
­otherwise confuse the automatic exposure setting (see Figure 3-10).
»
» Simultaneous Video and Photo: This setting lets you simultaneously capture 
video and still photographs. You can set the camera to take a still image every 
5 to 60 seconds while recording video.
Not all video resolutions support this setting, and you can’t use it while 
Protune is on.
»
» Looping Video: Like a security camera, this setting continuously records the 
scene. When space on the memory card runs out, the camera overwrites 
previously recorded content. You can alter the setting to rerecord after a 
certain duration (5 to 120 minutes). Like Simultaneous Video and Photo, this 
feature doesn’t work when Protune is turned on.

Using Advanced Features
Delving deeper into your GoPro’s feature set can be as thrilling as finding spare 
change in your couch cushions. But unlike grabbing a few quarters that fell out of 
your pocket months ago, these functions help you find something else: cool stuff 
for capturing amazing imagery. And now there are new ones that make it even 
easier to capture time-lapse, night photography, and both together. For those 
times you wish to get right to the good parts to edit, the Hi-Light Tag lets you 
highlight your memorable moviemaking, literally. That’s the Hi-Light Tag, and it 
lets you mark important parts of the movie, while you’re shooting it, so that you 
can find it easily later.
Hi-Light Tag your best moments
This new feature provides the antidote for quickly finding key portions of your 
video, which comes in handy when shooting a lot of video. The relatively new 
function found on the HERO4 series as well as the Session models is easy to use, 
and incredibly efficient when it comes time to edit. This is important as media 
cards continue to get bigger and hold more content. The Hi-Light Tag simplifies 
the search by allowing you to add a marker to the footage making it easier to find 
and share it.
FIGURE 3-10: 
Spot metering  
allows you  
to capture 
accurate expo-

with wide light 
disparities, 
such as this 
replica of the 
transporter 
from Star Trek.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     69
Like many other GoPro features, there’s more than one way to access and use the 
Hi-Light Tag function. You can access it from
»
» The camera: It’s the most basic way to use it, and simple too. Just start 
recording and press the Settings/Tag button on the side of the camera. While 
simple, it can also introduce vibration into the equation each time you touch 
the camera.
»
» The Capture app: When you pair it with your smartphone you can control all 
the camera’s functions and monitor the scene without touching it. Just tap the 
yellow button in the Capture app to tag each scene (see Figure 3-11).
»
» The GoPro remote: The remote allows you to tag important scenes by 
clicking the settings button — that’s the one that looks like a wrench — every 
time you want to highlight an important section.
FIGURE 3-11: 
Click the yellow 
button to tag 
each part of 
the scene.

70     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Seeing the Hi-Light Tag in action
After importing the footage into GoPro Studio, every section you tagged is labeled 
with an orange marker, as shown in Figure 3-12. Just double-click on it, and it 
will open in a play window when editing in GoPro Studio. The yellow lines on the 
timeline make it easier to set in and out points for just what you need.
Trying the Night Photo mode
The HERO4 and Session models provide expanded control over capturing night 
and low-light subjects with your GoPro (see Figure 3-13). This feature works for 
movies, still images, and time-lapse sequences. Basically, it allows you to select 
a longer shutter speed ranging from 2–30 seconds. Like many features on your 
GoPro, the Night Photo mode is accessible through the camera, remote, Capture 
app, and the touch screen display.
Here are some useful tips when using the Night Photo mode.
»
» Keep the camera stable: Shoot in Night Photo mode just as you shoot in any 
other long exposure situation, and firmly mount the camera. Whether you’re 
using a traditional tripod, mounting adhesives, or a specialty mount, a steady 
camera is necessary for sharp, non-blurry imagery.
»
» Use in conjunction with Protune: Not only does shooting with Protune 
subject the video capture to less compression, thereby creating better 
imagery, it also lets you alter a variety of functions, including White Balance, 
ISO setting, and Exposure Compensation. Use these features to your 
advantage.
»
» Shoot a test exposure: Take advantage of your ability of the immediate 
gratification of viewing your footage after you shoot it. There’s no sense in 
investing all that time if you’re not going to make sure exposure, color, and 
composition are just right.
FIGURE 3-12: 
Highlighted 
clips show an 
orange marker.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     71
Accessing Night Photo mode  
by using the Capture app
You can access Night Photo mode on the camera, but sometimes using the Capture 
app is easier. It’s especially helpful when the camera is already mounted and you 
don’t want to touch it. You can also switch modes and make changes directly on 
your smartphone (see Figure 3-14).
To access Night Photo mode by using the Capture app, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the app.
After firing up the Capture app, and tapping Connect to Camera, tap the 
Control button on the Home screen.
2.	 Set the app to Night Photo.
At the bottom of the preview screen, tap the icon to the right of the record 
button. It reflects the last mode used, so it may look like a camera.
3.	 Select Night from the popup.
This mode will allow the shutter to record longer exposure times conducive for 
night photography.
FIGURE 3-13: 
Night Photo 
mode allows 
you to take

72     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
4.	 Set the shutter speed.
Click on the wrench icon on the bottom right to change settings. Navigate  
to the Photo Settings and click Shutter. You can select a range for 2 to  
30 seconds. If you’re not sure, select Auto, and the camera will decide the 
proper setting.
5.	 Now you’re ready to shoot.
Notice that the Night Photo mode is represented by a moon and stars over the 
camera icon.
Controlling the Night Photo 
mode from the camera
If you’re not using the Capture app, you can set the Night Photo mode on the 
­camera by the doing the following:
1.	 Press the Mode button and navigate until you get to the Photo mode.
2.	 Press the Settings/Tag button (that’s the one on the side of the camera).
Here you can access the mode of your choice for taking photos.
3.	 Press the Shutter button to change the mode to Night.
The default setting is single exposure.
4.	 Press the Mode/Power button to select Shutter Speed.
5.	 Press the Shutter button to select the desired shutter speed.
You can select a shutter speed from 2–30 seconds. If you don’t, the camera will 
select a shutter speed automatically.

CHAPTER 3  Getting through GoPro Boot Camp     73
Shooting a time-lapse at night
Another cool feature on newer GoPro models is the Night-Lapse mode. This varia-
tion of the Time-Lapse mode lets you shoot time-lapse sequences at night or 
under extremely low light conditions. So how does it work? Basically, it’s the same 
function as a run-of-the-mill time-lapse, with one major difference: The shutter 
stays open longer. In the Auto mode, each frame is up to 2 seconds (depending on 
exposure) while in the Fixed mode, you can capture exposure durations between 
2 and 30 seconds. In addition, it can capture single frame at intervals of up to 
one hour.
The photo shown in Figure 3-15 was captured by placing the camera on the hood 
of a car using the Suction Cup mount. The interval was set to one second, while 
the car moved at an average speed of 10 miles per hour, creating the illusion in the 
time-lapse of travelling more than 300 miles per hour.
Access Night-Lapse mode through the Capture app, the touch screen display, or on 
the camera itself.
Here’s how to use it:
1.	 Open the app.
After firing up the Capture app, and tapping Connect to Camera, tap the 
Control button on the Home screen.

2.	 Set the app to Night Lapse.
At the bottom of the preview screen, tap the icon to the right of the Record 
button. It reflects the last mode used, so it may look like a camera or a stack of 
papers. Tap it, and then tap Multi-shot (the icon looks like a stack of papers).
3.	 Change the time interval.
Click on the wrench icon on the bottom right. It will bring up the settings menu. 
Navigate to Multi-Shot Settings and click Shutter. You can select a range from 
2–30 seconds. If you’re not sure, select Auto, and the camera automatically 
selects the proper setting.
4.	 Make sure the shot is set up to your liking.
Now you’re ready to shoot. If you have questions on intervals and how long 
you need to shoot the time-lapse, see Chapter 5.
5.	 Start recording.
Press the Shutter/Select button to stop recording. The red status light flashes 
three times, and the camera emits three beeps to indicate that Time-Lapse 
mode has ended.
Controlling the Night-Lapse 
mode from the camera
If you’re not using the Capture app, and using at least a HERO4, you can set the 
Night-Lapse mode on the camera by the doing the following:
1.	 Press Mode/Power and select Multi-Shot.
2.	 Press Settings/Tag button (Multi).
3.	 Press Shutter to change mode to Night Lapse.
4.	 Press Mode/Power to find interval.
5.	 Press Shutter to select the interval.

ts size is the first thing that lets you know making a movie with a GoPro is very 
different from using any other camera. After all, not many serious cameras 
resemble an accessory for your niece’s favorite American Girl doll. But don’t 
judge a book by its cover or a camera by its proportions. This formidable camera 
holds its own despite its diminutive appearance.
Regardless of your expertise in making movies or taking photographs, getting 
the most out of your GoPro requires a fresh approach, because GoPro shooting is 
a novel experience. You have limited control of exposure, focus, and focal length, 
for example, which makes it important to find the best places to mount the ­camera 
and compose the scene effectively.
In this chapter, I show you how to devote your time and energy to making a great 
GoPro movie.
Nailing GoPro Fundamentals
Proper planning is the key to success with a GoPro. It takes a few extra moments 
to make sure that the composition, color, and light are all right for the shot, but 
staying aware of how you capture each scene strengthens the final appearance of 
the movie. That’s how the pros do things.
Chapter 4

76     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Understanding the camera’s limitations
Unlike the camcorder or DSLR (digital single lens reflex camera) you may be com-
fortable using, the GoPro offers far fewer controls. It handles most of the technical 
settings automatically, and the focal length is limited to some pretty wide views. 
Earlier models offered a single, albeit very wide, view. But newer models offer 
some variations by also providing a narrow and medium angle of view. Basically, 
it shoots the scene at a higher resolution setting and crops it to fit the frame, 
so there is no loss of quality. The 2.7K mode provides enough resolution for the 
medium view; the 4K mode allows you to capture a narrower section.
So, when you’re on a lonely, desolate stretch of highway, a single-pump gas sta-
tion has all that you need. A GoPro isn’t much different. The camera is simple to 
operate, leaving the creative stuff up to you. That “creative stuff” includes setting 
up the camera properly, arranging each shot effectively, and solving each problem 
that pops up. Every time something changes in the scene or you move the camera, 
it’s important to make adjustments.
In many ways, not having to focus or set exposure is one of the camera’s greatest 
assets. Still, you’ll need to find ways to work around (or work with) the following 
limitations of the GoPro:
»
» No adjustable aperture setting: The aperture setting determines the amount 
of light that goes into the lens. GoPro sets it automatically. With another 
camera, you might adjust the aperture setting to increase or decrease depth 
of the focus in a scene, but you don’t have that option when you’re working 
with an ultra-wide-angle lens.
»
» No adjustable shutter speed: Depending on the subject, lighting, and level 
of action, adjusting the shutter speed offers a little more control. Slow speeds 
produce blurred images; higher ones can capture crisp action. Except for the 
Night Photo mode, GoPro doesn’t allow you to change the shutter speed. But 
it does offer a wide range of frame rates, which you can adjust to achieve the 
same effects.
»
» No manual focus: You don’t have much to focus with a lens that covers a 
wide angle view up to 170 degrees. Just about anything in the scene is in focus 
as long as it’s more than a few inches away (see Figure 4-1).
Checking your setup
“Measure twice, cut once” works well for carpenters, so why wouldn’t it for mov-
iemakers too. Taking a little extra time to make sure that everything is set right 

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     77
goes a long way. Making sure that a shot is technically perfect means double-
checking the monitor, ensuring that the mount is secure, and verifying that the 
camera is set properly.

THE GOPRO ISN’T A POINT-AND-SHOOT 
CAMERA
I overheard someone comparing the GoPro with a point-and-shoot camera. Although 
the camera’s manual controls are somewhat limited, it’s more than a point-and-shoot.
Still, the term is misleading for referring to automatic cameras. Even the most expensive 
DSLR can be used in a fully automatic mode. So, while GoPro limits your control over 
exposure and focal length, if it’s a point-and-shoot camera then it’s one on steroids. 
Great movies are always made by hand, so be more concerned with setting up the shot 
and less about the automatic stuff.

78     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Getting exposure just right
It’s a tall order when you need to figure out how to fine-tune exposure with a 
­camera that offers no manual settings, but GoPro moviemaking requires a 
­different way of thinking. You can still control image quality, but the process is 
different from changing the aperture or lowering the shutter speed.
Here are some pointers:
»
» Monitor the scene with the Capture app. Because most of the time you will 
be nowhere near your GoPro, it’s necessary to monitor the scene so you can 
compose it properly and check the exposure. You probably already spend a 
lot of time checking your smartphone, so why not use it to check each shot on 
your GoPro, too? (I cover the app in detail in Chapter 5.)
»
» Use exposure compensation. Exposure compensation is the next-best thing 
to setting exposure manually. This feature (activated when you turn on 
Protune; see Chapter 3) lets you increase or decrease the automatic exposure 
setting a few steps.
»
» Set your ISO manually. Depending on the situation, you can alter the 
camera’s ISO setting to capture bright or dimly lit scenes properly. A bright 
daylight scene does well when you set the camera at ISO 400, for example; for 
a low-light situation such as a night scene or a dark club, try using ISO 6400 to 
increase sensor sensitivity. As with exposure compensation, you must enable 
Protune to change ISO settings manually.
Maintaining accurate color (with Protune)
The GoPro normally reproduces a scene with punchy, saturated color. That setting 
works well for many situations, but on some occasions, you want to fine-tune 
color or take a more stylized approach. Maybe you want to use color temperature 
to convey a feeling in the scene. A warmly lit scene may evoke coziness, whereas 
a cool blue rendering evokes distance and isolation or tells the viewer, “Hey, it’s 
pretty cold here.”
When Protune is turned on, you can navigate through the Capture app to the Color 
setting to adjust the color profile of your video footage. Here are the settings:
»
» GoPro Color: The default color setting, providing user with the color profile 
they know and love.
»
» Flat: Provides a neutral color profile that captures more shadows and 
highlights. Uncorrected, this setting doesn’t look very appealing, as seen in 
Figure 4-2, but it provides the most flexibility when it comes to postproduction. 
Figure 4-3 shows corrected color.

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     79
Keeping the camera steady
Although technical settings contribute to the success of each shot, none of them 
matters much if you can’t keep the camera steady. Camera stability is an impor-
tant part of the equation, like following your grandmother’s recipe for reindeer 
cookies.

80     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Make sure that the camera remains steady throughout your shots. GoPro offers 
more mounting accessories than an equestrian boutique (see Chapter 2), so choose 
the right mount for the job to make sure that the camera is secure. Also, check 
that everything is tightened properly. If you mount a GoPro on your skateboard, 
USING THE CAMERA ON A TRIPOD
For general image stability, nothing beats a tripod. Using a tripod with your GoPro 
requires the accessory tripod mount (see Chapter 2), which serves as an adapter 
between the camera and the tripod head. If you opt to use one for your next GoPro 
­capture, try the following tips:
•	 Place the tripod on level ground. Make sure that you plant the tripod firmly on a 
level surface.
•	 Check that everything is tightened. This includes the GoPro mount.
•	 Keep an eye on the horizon. Because the camera has such a wide view, any slight 
movement of the mount will make the footage look as though the world is sliding 
downhill. Unless you have a specific creative purpose in mind, an evenly balanced 
horizon is essential. Be sure to monitor the scene in the Capture app on your 
­smartphone before pressing the Shutter/Select button.
•	 Position the tripod properly. Chances are that you’ll be close to the subject, so if 
you’re using a standard tripod, try not to point one of the tripod legs toward the 
­subject. Otherwise, you risk getting the tripod leg in the shot or causing someone trip 
to over it. If you’re using something like a GorillaPod, make sure that it’s wrapped 
securely around whatever you wrap it around.

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     81
and the thumbscrew on the mount is loose, the resulting footage will show the 
camera slipping.
At one point or another, you may consider holding the camera in one hand and 
your smartphone (running the Capture app) in the other. Don’t even think about 
hitting the wet stuff with your GoPro with smartphone in tow. It’s like going out 
with Superman and finding that bullets don’t bounce off your chest.
Shooting Your Movie
The success of your movie depends heavily on how effectively you capture each 
scene, and part of that process involves shooting enough variations of each scene. 
Having several angles and perspectives to choose among helps you alter the 
­movie’s visual rhythm and give it a nice flow (see Figure 4-4).
Deviations within shots make for powerful editing and help you pace the movie. 
It’s not unusual for a movie to have a 20:1 ratio (or greater) of shots captured to 
shots used.
But not being stingy about shooting variations of each shot doesn’t give you 
license to overshoot. If you do, you’ll spend too much time going through the 
footage and second-guessing what you included in the edit and what you put on 
the storyboard.
FIGURE 4-4:

angles help

82     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Finding the best position  
for the camera
There’s a certain swagger to GoPro movies that makes them stand out from their 
more conventional counterparts. Whether it’s a segment of breathtaking action 
sequences, unique perspectives, or a little of both, there’s something truly dis-
tinctive about movies made with this camera. But they’re not impervious to the 
fundamentals of the best places to put the camera.
That’s because great moviemaking revolves around assembling an array of shots 
that come together like a visual symphony. If you think of each shot as a note of 
music, you will realize that sometimes it doesn’t matter how beautiful that note 
sounds on its own, because it needs other notes for it to sound complete. The same 
thing happens when you apply a nice mix of shots to your movie.
So, variety isn’t just the spice of life; it also adds flavor to your movie. That means 
altering the camera-to-subject distance or mixing in different angles keeps the 
viewer more interested in your movie than, say, using a bunch of eye-level shots. 
Don’t get me wrong — they’re necessary, but if that’s all you got, your audience 
will suffer from terminal yawning.
It also means putting the camera in unusual places to show a unique view, such 
as using a roll bar mount to attach the camera on a shovel, as seen in Figure 4-5.
FIGURE 4-5:

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     83
Shooting to edit
Rather than shoot everything that happens in front of the camera, it’s more effec-
tive to shoot to edit. Shooting to edit means having an idea about the structure of 
the movie — or the number of scenes you want to include — and then creating 
each scene with three or more variations. The simplest form of shooting to edit 
means getting a wide-angle, normal, and close-up view of each subject.
Shooting to edit is a little more complicated with the GoPro, however, because its 
fixed lens covers a very wide angle of view, making normal view hard and zoom 
impossible.
Here are some options for varying your shots:
»
» Shoot variations of each shot in the scene. At the very least, include 
variations to subject size and angle. This makes it easier to choose shots in  
the editing process.
»
» Change the Field of View. Altering the size of the subject in the frame 
provides de facto versions of wide, close-up, and normal views.
»
» Shoot at different angles. Besides shooting at eye level, place the camera 
high and shoot down on the subject, or mount the camera low and shoot up 
at the subject.
»
» Alter the composition. You have a lot of frame to play with, so use it to your 
advantage by incorporating various compositional devices such as the rule of 
thirds, subject placement, and framing (see Figure 4-6). For a more thorough 
list of compositional choices, look at Chapter 6.

84     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Alternating shots, GoPro style
GoPro uses a pretty wide focal length to make movies, but that’s not so unusual. 
Often, feature films are shot with a single lens. Changing the camera-to-subject 
distance and perspective varies shots. You can also select a less wide setting. (See 
Chapter 1.) But the big difference is that cinema cameras generally use a lens with 
a normal perspective. In the 35mm world, that would be the 50mm normal lens. 
Its perspective lies between being slightly wide and slightly telephoto.
GoPro makes alternating shots a little more challenging because it’s just wide. It’s 
still possible to get a good variation of shots with your GoPro; you just need to get 
a bit creative.
Maintaining continuity between shots
Most films are shot out of sequence and put together in postproduction like a 
giant puzzle. Sometimes when the movie is being assembled, though, a scene 
may be compromised because something changed from shot to shot. Maybe that 
can of soda that was on the edge of the counter in one shot is on the other side in 
another shot. Or maybe the actor’s shirt was buttoned differently in a couple of 
shots. Isolating all the details makes for logistical nightmares. Many mistakes are 
so minor that audiences wouldn’t even notice them. But that doesn’t mean you 
shouldn’t be as careful as possible.
These pointers can prevent problems in your movie:
»
» Keep a detailed record of each scene. The proof is in the picture. The better 
your recollection of a scene, the better your chances of ordering other shots  
properly.
»
» Keep the action plausible. Successful editing thrives on the rhythm between 
shots, so it’s necessary they remain plausible. Don’t show a sequence of 
someone getting into a car, and then showing it moving in the opposite 
direction because the light was better.
»
» Watch the subject’s primary movements. Sometimes it’s hard with this 
camera, especially when shooting action. Regardless, be sure the subject’s 
actions remain consistent (See Figure 4-7). For example, if the subject has his 
right hand raised slightly in the wide shot, then make sure it’s not lowered in 
the medium shot. These minor breeches can still break the suspension of 
disbelief in your movie, so be aware of them.
»
» Try not to break the 180-degree rule. This establishes the screen direction 
of the action. It’s the same premise as a stage production, where everything 
happens in front of the audience, or within their peripheral view. Think of it as 

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     85
an imaginary line that the camera must stay behind to maintain continuity. 
Easier said than done with a GoPro, but many continuity problems occur 
when the succeeding shot does not maintain the periphery of human vision.
When to stop and start the camera
When to stop and start the camera is a practical question. You can’t peek through 
a viewfinder on most models and press the shutter at the right moment. Nor can 
you fully trust the Capture app on your smartphone because it has a 2-second 
delay. So, here’s some advice on when to stop and start:
»
» Use the Capture app on your smartphone: Whenever possible, this provides 
the best way to record each scene, even with the 2-second delay. Not only can 
you look at the shot, but also you don’t have to touch the camera, possibly 
overturning it. You can control up to 50 cameras. You can also use the GoPro  
remote.
»
» Start early: No matter what kind of camera you’re using, it’s always best to 
pre-roll so that the action begins after you started recording. The same 
applies for stopping the record. Let it breathe a bit before ending the record.
»
» Use the Photo Burst mode for stills: You can alter its setting to how many 
frames it captures as well as the duration. For moving scenes that you don’t 
want to miss, set the camera on burst and press the Shutter/Select button. 
You can always discard the outtakes.

Tooling with Time-Lapse Mode
GoPro is an equal-opportunity camera because it allows you to capture still images 
that are every bit as impressive as its video. The wide-angle lens provides a crisp, 
sharp image for pictures that move and the ones that stay perfectly still. The only 
thing more impressive would be finding a way to mix them. Well, you don’t have 
to look; the time-lapse mode on your GoPro provides the best of both worlds.
Getting started with time-lapse
A time-lapse sequence consists of a bunch of still images that are captured at a 
constant rate. It’s like animation with photographs instead of computer-drawn 
pictures. By default, time-lapse mode on a GoPro shoots a frame every 0.5 second, 
but you can capture the scene at intervals as high as 1 frame every 60 seconds. In 
Figure 4-8, for example, the GoPro is mounted on car hood, and the duration was 
set at a 1/2 frame per second. The car was moving at 20 miles per hour, creating 
the illusion of moving at 300 miles per hour.
After you capture the sequence, the numerous images are processed in a video 
editing program (such as GoPro Studio Edit; see Chapter 11) and brought together 
in order. Sometimes, a time-lapse sequence consists of thousands of images, so 
you need an application to put them all together.
USING MULTIPLE GOPROS
You can control up to 50 cameras with the GoPro remote control, starting and stopping 
them remotely. Here are a few reasons to use more than one GoPro for a shoot:
•	 Extreme action: Extreme action is the kind of thing you want to capture from 
­different perspectives because you don’t know whether you’re going to be able to get 
it again.
•	 Shoot multiple angles simultaneously: Filmmakers rarely shoot with multiple 
­cameras because it’s too expensive. But when a camera capable of 4K capture costs 
less to own than a one-day rental of a camcorder, the choice is a no-brainer.
•	 3D moviemaking: GoPro makes it easy to make a 3D movie. All you need are a 
second camera and the DualHEROSystem. That’s the tandem housing used for 
­capturing 3D movies. The rest, you can put together in GoPro Studio Edit (see 
Chapter 10).

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     87
Shooting time-lapse footage
After you power up your GoPro, here’s how to record time-lapse footage:
1.	 Press the Power/Mode button to cycle through the available modes.
2.	 When you reach Time-Lapse, press the Shutter/Select button to select it.
The icon for Time-Lapse mode is a clock next to a camera.
3.	 Change the time interval.
Go to the Settings menu on the Capture app and click Time Lapse to find the 
desired interval.
The default setting is 0.5 second, but you can capture a frame every 1, 2, 5, 10, 
30, or 60 seconds. (For more information, see the nearby sidebar “Calculating 
duration.”)
4.	 Press the Shutter/Select button to start time-lapse capture.
The camera initiates countdown, and the red status light on front of the 
camera flashes each time a frame is captured.
5.	 Press the Shutter/Select button to stop recording.
The red status light flashes three times, and the camera emits three beeps to 
indicate that time-lapse mode has ended.
Making time-lapse easier
Making time-lapse movies beats a lot of other cool ways to tell a story, but it 
can be nerve-wracking, too. For one thing, it’s a huge time investment. Also, 
if a glitch occurs, you lose the sequence but gain a few thousand images — not 
really an equal trade. For that reason, it’s important not only to set up the camera 
­properly for time-lapse recording, but to also take a sensible approach to it.

88     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Here are a few pointers:
»
» Mount it securely. Whether you opt for a GoPro mount or decide to use a 
tripod (with the GoPro adapter), be sure that you mount the camera securely. 
You don’t want to introduce motion where it shouldn’t exist.
»
» Take your time. Plan the shot, and make sure that the subject is properly 
framed (see Chapter 6). Be on the lookout for elements that can detract from 
the sequence, such as a bright light or an extraneous object.
CALCULATING DURATION
Suppose that you want to create a 30-second time-lapse movie of Thanksgiving dinner 
with your whole family at the table. You’re planning to capture all 2.5 hours from soup to 
nuts, but you’re not quite sure about the duration between frames. If you use a setting 
of 1 frame per second (fps), for example, your sequence would be around 6 minutes 
long. Yikes!
The difference between a good time-lapse sequence and a great one often lies in the 
interval between frames. Striking the proper balance takes a little trial and error. You can 
select the duration between frames randomly, or you can use a formula.
Instead of guesstimating, use the following formula to calculate exactly how many 
frames you’ll need and the duration between them:
1.	 Determine the desired length of the sequence as follows:
(Desired duration in seconds) x (Frames per second for playback) = Amount of 
frames for playback
A 30-second sequence that plays back at 30 fps would require 900 frames:
(30 x 30 = 900)
2.	 Translate total time into seconds with this formula:
(hours) x (60) x (60) = seconds
To record your 2.4-hour family dinner, for example, you’d use the following formula:
(2.5 hours) x (60 minutes) x (60 seconds) = 9,000 seconds
3.	 Divide the time in seconds (Step 2) by the number of required frames (Step 1) 
to come up with your frame duration.
To make a 30-second movie of your 2.4-hour event, set the digital timer at 1 frame 
every 12 seconds and then find something to do for the next 2.5 hours.
 (9,000) / (900) = 10 seconds

CHAPTER 4  Understanding Effective Camera Techniques     89
»
» Understand that a time-lapse sequence is a sequence. Time-lapse 
recording depends on activity in the frame. Sometimes, that activity is going to 
be fantastic. At other times, you’ll have unpredictable motion in the scene or 
pedestrians getting too close to the camera, and maybe you’ll even catch 
yourself checking the camera. These moments pose little threat, if any, 
because they’re fleeting and won’t be noticed or can be deleted in postpro-
duction (see Part 3).
»
» Use a large, fast memory card. The card you select should be like an NFL 
wide receiver: big, strong, and fast. Because time-lapse sequences have the 
potential to capture a lot of frames at a high resolution, you want a card that 
has enough capacity to hold them all and enough speed to perform smoothly. 
Few things are worse than missing key action because you filled the card or 
the card wasn’t fast enough to keep up. A 32MB Class 10 card is ideal (see 
Chapter 2).
»
» Have a fully charged battery. GoPro batteries are notoriously short-lived —  
battery life is around 2 hours — so it’s entirely possible for your camera’s 
battery to drain before the time-lapse sequence ends. Always use a freshly 
charged battery, and check on the camera often.
»
» Hurry up and wait. The name of this process alone — time-lapse — should 
tip you off that it’s quite lengthy. You won’t have to do much except wait. You 
can get some other things done and even walk away from the scene for a 
while if you’ll be nearby.
Using Other Photo Modes
Besides banging out the occasional still frame and capturing a time-lapse 
sequence, your GoPro offers more options for capturing still images. You’ll notice 
them when you’re scrolling capture modes.
Here are a couple of other photo modes that you may want to check out:
»
» Continuous: This mode allows the GoPro to work like a motor drive on a 
DSLR by capturing 3, 5, or 10 fps for as long as you hold down the Shutter/
Select button. Continuous mode is great for capturing action scenes.
»
» Photo Burst: This mode acts something like Continuous mode, but it shoots a 
burst of frames that you set ahead of time. It’s great when you want to have a 
choice of frames in an action sequence. Figure 4-9 shows a few of the frames 
that were in the capture using Photo Burst mode; Figure 4-10 shows the 
perfect one. In the Photo Burst mode, the burst was set to capture 30 frames 
in 3 seconds; Figure 4-9 shows five frames.

Framing the Shot
G
reat films are built on the creative use of visual elements such as composi-
tion, camera angle, color, and lighting. The GoPro adds its own perspective 
to the mix, thanks to its extremely wide-angle view and its capability to 
go almost anyplace.
Although the GoPro has become a recent phenomenon, shooting with an ultra- 
wide-angle lens is not. Some professional directors rely on it for an occasional 
shot; others swear by it. Terry Gilliam (director and founding member of the Brit-
ish sketch-comedy group Monty Python) shoots nearly all his films with a rec-
tilinear wide-angle lens, which gives his films a unique look. Wes Anderson also 
favors a very wide view as a stylistic device.
These directors accomplish what we’re all looking to do: differentiating our-
selves from the pack through our special way of seeing a story. Finding your own 
visual style begins by understanding the fundamentals. That’s what will make you

different from your cousin Jim or your former college roommate who also has a 
GoPro. The goal is to find your visual style and build on it.
This chapter shows you how to use classic visual elements to create a compelling 
film — GoPro style.
Understanding Time-Honored 
Visual Basics
Here’s a way you could look at composition: “What happens in the frame stays in 
the frame.” More accurately, what happens in the frame is all that people can see. 
Take the time to provide essential visual content, but do it economically enough 
that you don’t clutter the frame.
How you choose to occupy the frame plays a big part in the success of your movie. No 
matter what technology you use, what happens in each shot stands on its own but 
also influences other shots. Not sure what I’m talking about? Check out the shower 
scene in Alfred Hitchcock’s classic thriller Psycho or the “Here’s Johnny” close-up 
of Jack Nicholson in The Shining. There’s nothing random about these shots; they 
were strategically arranged. The directors understood how to fill the frame, as well 
as the relationship between each shot when it comes to assembling the movie.
Creating an effective composition has its challenges, especially with a camera that 
captures the world with an ultra-wide-angle view. But that doesn’t mean you can’t 
find a happy medium. Besides, each of us sees the world a little differently, so 
here’s a breakdown of the components of visual technique.
Properly composing the scene
Composition is about understanding how to fill the frame in a way that effectively 
and efficiently communicates your intention to the viewer. There’s psychology 
behind arrangement of scenes. Normally, people look from left to right and top to 
bottom. That mechanism works for reading and for effectively arranging a scene 
to capture video or a still frame.
Here are two examples of how a viewer can interpret a scene, based on the way 
it’s arranged:

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     93
»
» Positioning the subject at bottom right: This arrangement draws viewers to 
the subject (see Figure 5-1) as they look across and down at the frame.
»
» Positioning the subject at top left: When the subject is in the top-left corner 
of the frame (see Figure 5-2), the viewer can share the perspective of the 
subject in the scene.

94     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Coherently arranging the shot
Basic shot structure with a GoPro differs somewhat from the approach you would 
take with a conventional camcorder or DSLR (digital single lens reflex camera). 
The GoPro uses a fixed wide-angle lens, whereas the others use a zoom lens that 
covers lots of focal lengths (but nowhere as wide as the lengths that the GoPro’s 
lens can cover).
Instead of using focal length to bring a shot in tight, control the variations in the 
size of the subject in the frame solely with camera-to-subject distance. Typical 
shot arrangements such as wide, medium, and close-up take on different mean-
ings with the GoPro. If you’re using the Black Edition, it’s possible to change the 
Field of View. Here are some of the shots you can get:
»
» Ultra-wide: This shot covers a wide area of the scene with nothing looking as 
though it’s anywhere near the camera (see Figure 5-3).
»
» Very wide: This shot still covers an expansive area, but some objects appear 
to be closer (see Figure 5-4).
»
» Fairly wide: Objects in the scene are much closer to the lens, though not that 
close that the ultra-wide-angle view makes them seem a little distant. 
Meanwhile the subject is probably only a few feet away, as seen in Figure 5-5.

»
» Intimate wide: This shot is still wide but fills the frame with the subject, who 
may be just inches away (see Figure 5-6). Think of this view as being the 
GoPro’s version of a close-up.

Breaking Down Shot Lingo
Great filmmaking weaves different shot types throughout a story. The different 
sizes at which you depict a subject in the frame help create a visual narrative.
Here’s an in-depth description of various shot types:
»
» Long shot: Some people call this shot an extreme wide-angle shot, but I call it 
the result of using your GoPro like a conventional camera. This expansive shot 
establishes an overall view of the setting and is often used as the first shot in 
the edit. It’s not always necessary to include actors; a wide landscape with few 
identifiable subjects qualifies for this type of shot.
»
» Very wide shot: This shot isn’t as expansive as a long shot but is still wide. It 
can also work as an establishing shot.
»
» Wide shot: In the wide world of wide shots, this shot isn’t that wide. It works 
well with people, presenting them from head to toe. Frequently, this shot is 
used to set up medium and close-up shots.
»
» Medium or normal shot: This shot takes a more distinct view of the subject, 
showing more of him than in a wide shot and much less than in a close-up —  
perhaps from the waist up. If you shoot from a higher angle, you can make 
the subject look like a bobble head doll, with his head being much larger than 
the rest of his body.
FIGURE 5-6:

right next to 
the subject.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     97
»
» Two shot: This shot shows interaction between two subjects: a conversation 
or confrontation. Sometimes, the subjects are shown full-figure; at other 
times, they’re shown from the waist up.
»
» Medium close-up: One way to think of it is as the close-up for people who 
don’t like close-ups. This shot captures a person’s entire face, with a little bit of 
her neck and chest. If the subject is an object instead of the person, the object 
can loosely fill the frame. Often, this shot is the closest you’re going to get to a 
subject with a GoPro without totally distorting that subject.
»
» Close-up: This shot is pretty close, and some people may not like you coming 
this close. The frame shows the subject from the neck up. It shows the head, 
hair, and face but not pores and blemishes.
»
» Extreme close-up: This shot shows lots of detail on inanimate objects, but 
you may get hit with an object if you try to use this shot on a human with your 
GoPro.
»
» Point of view: This shot shows the scene as the subject sees it (see Figure 5-7) 
and makes for a great selection of shots for editing. Many GoPro mounts help 
you achieve this type of shot; see Chapter 3 for a few examples.
»
» Cutaway: All sorts of productions, from news broadcasts and documentaries 
to feature films and reality television programs, use this device to provide 
more options for editing. This shot shows details such as the subject’s 
cracking his knuckles, picking up a glass, or tapping his fingers.

Following Simple Framing Rules
Cinematic composition can follow the same time-honored rules as traditional 
pictorial composition. The following sections present some of the most prominent 
rules of composition.
Observe the rule of thirds
Have you ever wondered why Greek architecture remains aesthetically pleasing 
more than 2,000 years later? The reason is the Greeks’ time-honored approach 
of balancing a shape in thirds — an approach that they called the Golden Mean. 
Today, we call this approach the rule of thirds.
Here are a few guidelines:
»
» Don’t place the main subject dead center. Imagine the frame divided into 
three parts — horizontal, vertical, and center — with the center being off limits 
to the subject (see Figure 5-8).
TAKE SOME TIPS FROM THE MOVIES
The next time you’re watching a movie, analyze the shot structure. Feature films include 
the following shots:
•	 Establishing shot: Generally, this shot is a wide-angle shot that lets the viewer get a 
sense of the landscape, place, or logistics of a scene. An establishing shot usually is 
the opening shot of a movie, but it can also depict location or time changes.
•	 Wide: A wide shot is an expansive view of the scene that shows the subject in rela-
tion to his or her environment.
•	 Medium: A medium shot is an average perspective, not too close and not too far. It’s 
excellent for shots that include dialogue.
•	 Close-up: A close-up is a magnified view of a scene. Sometimes, it brings distant 
objects closer or emphasizes important details.
•	 Pan: A pan is a sweeping motion over a scene, from side to side.
•	 Tilt: A tilt is the camera’s way of looking up, down, or up and down.
•	 Tracking shot: A tracking shot uses focal length to draw the subject closer or farther 
away in a scene.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     99
»
» Lead the viewer. It’s your choice to lead the view into or out of the frame. 
Remember the earlier discussion of positioning the subject.
»
» Be mindful of the horizon. Placing the horizon line in the center of the frame 
is almost as boring as placing the subject in the middle. Instead, place the 
horizon on one of the dividing lines to show more sky or foreground. Make 
sure that the GoPro is level; otherwise, the shot will have image distortion 
because of its wide-angle lens.
»
» Mind your subject’s head. Always have a little room to avoid giving your 
subject a flat top.
Keeping things simple
Although the axiom “Less is more” can apply to many things, in filmmaking, it 
refers to including only pertinent visual information. When you keep the scene 
free of extraneous clutter, the viewer immediately recognizes the center of inter-
est and doesn’t have to take a moment to figure it out. Sounds easy, right? Not all 
the time. Sometimes, you don’t notice clutter in the frame until you start editing. 
Before pressing the Shutter/Select button, make sure that the shot is concise and 
that the viewer clearly understands the center of interest.
FIGURE 5-8:

selfie follows 
the rule of 
thirds, because

subject does

the center of

100     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Keep in mind the following guidelines:
»
» Avoid complicated backgrounds. A complicated background features a 
laundry list of elements that can range from objects strewn behind the subject 
to a light ratio beyond what the camera can handle. Recompose the scene if 
the sky is too bright or if a telephone pole appears to be growing out of the 
subject’s head.
»
» Focus on simplicity. When a scene concentrates on the subject, try framing 
the subject against a plain background, even if the scene takes place in a 
busy area.
»
» Keep competition among scene elements down. Make sure that the 
subject isn’t fighting other parts of the scene for the viewer’s attention — 
unless the conflict is intentional, of course. Look at the scene through the 
viewer’s eyes; see whether you understand what the subject is.
»
» Track the shot efficiently. If the camera follows the subject, be sure that it 
doesn’t lead the viewer into a heap of clutter. Tracking the subject in an open 
field that leads to a cluster of telephone wires would be leading the viewer 
into clutter. Recompose the scene if necessary.
Taking advantage of the background
Not placing the subject against a complicated background qualifies as good advice. 
But at times, the space behind the subject works to your advantage. Colorful, sim-
ple, or picturesque backgrounds fall into this category and can even enhance the 
quality of the scene.
The human eye can effectively distinguish elements in a scene thanks to depth 
perception, but the camera can’t. A movie frame is two-dimensional, so some-
times it can’t differentiate screen elements properly. Because the GoPro has such 
a wide lens, almost the entire scene is in focus, so discrepancies between the fore-
ground and background can blend together.
When dealing with backgrounds with your GoPro, consider the following:
»
» Keep an eye on vertical lines. Be sure that telephone poles, trees, street 
lamps, and other sticklike objects don’t converge with the subject. These 
objects can appear to be unusual appendages or look like part of a 
shish kabob.
»
» Understand that the scene is two-dimensional. Movies and photographs 
appear to be compressed, mainly because humans see the world as 3D, but 
the camera renders it as 2D.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     101
»
» Complement the subject. Let the background work for the subject. The 
interview in your skateboarding movie, for example, should have something 
going on in the skateboard park behind the subject, such as someone doing 
a halfpipe. In a skydiving movie, a plane or hanger could complement the 
subject.
Putting people first
Whether you’re posing the subject against a background or capturing yourself in 
an action scene, follow these guidelines:
»
» Determine whether the subject should look into the camera. Whether the 
subject is you or someone else, decide whether the subject is going to talk 
to the audience. Generally, in an interview, the subject shouldn’t look into 
the camera. But if you’re filming a first-person account of some event, it’s 
completely acceptable for the subject to look at the camera.
»
» Don’t ignore the basics. Follow the rule of thirds (see “Observe the rule of 
thirds” earlier in this chapter) for subject placement in the frame. Avoid 
putting the subject in the center. Also, keep an eye on the background.
»
» Find a flattering angle. Because the GoPro has a nearly fish-eye view, the 
difference between a subject’s looking like a man and looking like fish may be 
a matter of a few inches.
Use shadows and reflections wisely
Shadows and reflections not only look good onscreen, but also help unify a scene, 
especially when it includes a one-sided arrangement. Including shadows in the 
frame can provide a variety of effects, including a sense of depth, warning, or 
foreboding (see Figure  5-9). Reflected images tend to grab viewers’ attention, 
especially when they involve rich textures. Sometimes capturing shadows and 
reflections also works as the main subject.
Balancing the frame with a shadow or reflection serves many purposes. It can 
make a statement about the scene, such as the time of day, or it can make a 
nice selection for your shot arrangement. Also, it makes a drab subject look more 
interesting.

102     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Here are some things to consider about using shadows and reflections in your shots:
»
» Treat a shadow like any other subject, either by including it in its entirety or by 
defining a segment (shape, form, or feature).
»
» If the shadow or reflection is the center of interest, focus attention on it 
instead of the subject.
»
» Be careful not to get a reflection of your GoPro in the shot, and make sure 
that the light behind the camera doesn’t create a shadow.
CONSIDERING OTHER COMPOSITIONAL 
DEVICES
If you follow the rule of thirds and watch the background each time you record, you 
probably don’t need to worry about much else. When you decide to add more visual 
magic, however, you have a couple more visual devices to consider:
•	 Sweeping curve: Lead the viewer on a sweeping diagonal journey from the top of 
the frame to the bottom, or vice versa. This technique works best when the scene is 
shot from overhead, because it leads the viewer on a visual journey.
•	 Shape and form: Sometimes, it’s effective to depict the subject as a shape or form. 
Viewers are attracted to geometric patterns.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     103
Art-Directing the Scene
In this section, I present more advanced approaches to unifying your vision for 
the movie.
Arranging elements in the scene
It’s a bit deceptive to say that you’re arranging elements in the scene when  
you’re positioning the camera to include, omit, or capture the subject at a specific 
angle within the context of the frame. Because the GoPro has an incredibly wide- 
angle view, sometimes it’s challenging to compose a scene.
It’s visually effective to position the camera as close to the subject as possible 
for an intimate view. Using foreground objects to frame the scene works well as 
another creative device that makes for an interesting shot. Whether you’re captur-
ing a doorway, archway, tree branch, peephole, or just about anything else on the 
periphery of the shot, this technique can define the center of interest in the frame.
Making the GoPro’s view work for you
Thanks to the camera’s super-wide view, it’s best to think of each scene you 
shoot with your GoPro as having a foreground, middle ground, and background. 
By paying attention to all three elements, you’ll be able to follow basic cinematic 
principles, and before long, the limitations of focal length will become an asset.
Here are a few pointers:
»
» Maintain attention on the subject. Don’t worry if the framing elements are 
out of focus, as in Figure 5-10. Besides, when you’re capturing such a wide 
view, it’s unlikely much of the scene will be out of focus.
»
» Frame the people too. If you frame the main subject with people in the shot, 
it’s best to have the people look into the center of the frame, as opposed to 
out of it. This technique affects the audience’s view of what’s important; that 
view is based on where the people onscreen are looking.
»
» Don’t place the subject on the edge of the frame. While dead center is often 
a boring place for the subject, the GoPro’s wide-angle view can severely distort it.
Keeping things in balance
Balancing elements such as color, shape, and light in the frame creates a legiti-
mate order in which the viewer can process the scene. Another method places 

104     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
subject matter on both sides to form an even composition. In this sort of arrange-
ment, it’s acceptable to put the subject in the center.
Then there’s asymmetrical balance, in which the subject shares the frame with 
negative or blank space to depict vastness or difference. Also, the juxtaposition 
of color is another means of making the scene look interesting. You can position 
a warmly lit subject against a cool blue backdrop, for example. Complementary 
colors are described as the opposite pairs of colors that produce the strongest 
contrast to one another. Here are a few colors and their complementary colors:
»
» Green/magenta
»
» Red/cyan
»
» Blue/yellow
Creating subtext in a scene
There are many definitions of subtext in film, but one of the most common ways 
of showing it is called mise-en-scène (a French term that translates to “placing on 
stage”). Mise-en-scène occurs when everything comes together in the frame to 
convey the intention of a scene. Essentially, it’s a poetic way of visually conveying 
what you want the audience to take from the scene.
This message comes together in a variety of ways, mostly through the decor of the 
set, the arrangement of elements, and the lighting. Sometimes, it’s created in the 
FIGURE 5-10: 
Framing the 
shot of this 
Halloween 
scene.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     105
editing process. One example is cutting away to a locomotive blowing its whistle 
when the subject begins to show anger.
Here are a few other ways to get this message across to your viewer.
»
» Use cool blue lighting to depict the subject’s despair.
»
» Having the subject look up to the sky after a confrontation may suggest that 
he’s looking for guidance.
»
» Having the subject take a walk early in the morning can alert the audience to 
the start of something new.
Taking advantage of perspective
The GoPro sees the world through an ultra-wide-angle view, as shown in ­Figure 5-11, 
so you don’t have the luxury of varying focal length to alter subject size when you’re 
shooting from a fixed distance. Instead of treating this limitation as a liability, let it 
work to your advantage by concentrating on the way you frame the subject matter.
The first time someone loaned me a fish-eye lens for my SLR (single lens reflex 
camera), I was amazed by how much of the world it captured. At one point, I placed 
the camera on the curb to get a low-angle view of Times Square, and a cab blocked 
my shot as I pressed the shutter. After the film was processed, I saw an amazingly 
distorted image of the taxi, even though it couldn’t have been more than two feet 
from the camera. The GoPro provides a similar experience, and because you’re not 
always nearby, it may deliver similar surprises.

Thinking About Where to Put Your GoPro
Most cameras can only be mounted on a tripod or handheld. The GoPro, however, 
can go anywhere. This section focuses on ways to maximize your opportunities 
when out shooting with the camera.
Grabbing static shots
By its very nature, the GoPro thrives on action conditions, but that doesn’t mean 
you’re not going to need a static shot every now and again. A static shot is a still 
shot of a scene with very little or no activity. Think of it as being the movie version 
of a photograph. The length of the shot depends on the context.
Here are a few reasons to use a static shot:
»
» Setting a scene: A wide shot of a stadium before the big game, a downtown 
block on a Sunday morning, or a local landmark on a fall day can open the film 
to provide a sense of place.
»
» Depicting a living creature that isn’t moving: Static shots don’t always 
involve inanimate objects. You might take a static shot of your dog taking a 
nap, an athlete meditating before an event, or your dad snoozing on the 
couch.
»
» Focusing on details: Depending on what you’re shooting in the movie, 
concentrating on a key part of the scene gives the viewer a sense of the 
subject. For example, you can mount the camera on your motocross bike for 
an action movie.
Using motion
The GoPro allows you to use motion as a creative device. Besides capturing an 
action sequence with incredible sharpness and exposure, you can alter the speed 
of the action, creating both slow motion and accelerated activity onscreen. Here 
are some ways to alter the normal rate of motion:
»
» Slow motion: The GoPro offers a variety of frame rates with most resolution 
settings. Frame rates differ from model to model, with the HERO4 Black Edition 
offering the most options. If you want to shoot slow motion, you should pick 
the highest frame-rate setting available — generally, 120 frames per second 
(fps) or higher. Then you need to process the footage (more on that in 
Chapter 11).

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     107
»
» Fast motion: Although you can achieve this effect by playing with the frame 
rate in GoPro Studio Edit, you can also shoot a time-lapse movie. The latter 
technique surely provides better quality because the footage is constructed of 
individual still images.
Finding your unique point of view
Having a camera that provides a unique view of the world can stimulate your 
creative approach to arranging a scene. That’s why it’s important to find the best 
position for your GoPro by changing its position — higher, lower, or even tilted — 
to make a shot more interesting.
Where you position the camera speaks loudly about the message you’re trying to 
convey and affects how you edit your movie.
Try including some of these shots in your next movie:
»
» High angle: Whether you mount your GoPro on a pole or use a handheld 
extension device, you elevate the camera and change the perspective, 
providing a more graphical composition of the frame. Besides providing a 
unique perspective, this shot can make the audience look down on the 
character, perhaps to depict weakness. It can also produce a bobble head 
effect when you’re shooting a person (see Figure 5-12).
FIGURE 5-12: 
Bobble head 
effect.

108     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Bird’s-eye: Although this shot isn’t easy for most cameras, GoPro makes it 
possible to capture an angle that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud. 
Positioning the camera high and directly above the action creates a topo-
graphical view, often making common objects unrecognizable.
»
» Low angle: Mounting the camera as low as possible and pointing it upward 
provides another dynamic option for your movie. With this perspective, you 
can change the horizon. A low-angle shot also shows the viewer something he 
or she normally doesn’t see. You can also use it to show the perspective of 
a child.
»
» Dutch angle: Intentionally tilting the frame provides a refreshing break in 
conventional viewing. This perspective, which is popular in horror flicks, 
independent films, and music videos, can depict alienation, uncertainty, 
and tension. Whenever possible, try to use this creative device; it can make 
your movies more visually appealing. But use it sparingly. It gets old rather 
quickly.
Moving the camera
Because your GoPro is mostly attached to a mount, it’s going to move with the 
subject. At other times, you can also use it like a conventional movie camera 
when it comes to following the action or making a visual statement. Consider the 
following:
»
» Pan: A sweeping motion of the scene that goes side to side.
»
» Tilt: It’s the camera’s version of looking up, down, or up and down.
»
» Tracking shot: A means of using the focal length to draw the subjects closer 
or farther away while shooting the scene.
Working with the Capture App
The Capture app lets you control the camera and see what’s going on. All the tips 
in this chapter about managing the contents of the frame won’t matter much 
unless you can see exactly what you’re doing. Also, because the GoPro isn’t always 
in front of you, using your smartphone with the Capture app is the only game 
in town.

CHAPTER 5  Framing the Shot     109
Controlling the camera remotely
Because of the interesting places you can put a GoPro, you’re rarely close to the 
camera. That’s what makes the Capture app so invaluable. You can not only see 
the shot, but also have complete access to camera controls. Among other things, 
you can start and stop the recording, adjust camera functions, switch modes, and 
check your battery level from a distance.
Monitoring the shoot
The first time I picked up a GoPro, it felt like something was missing. Of course, 
that something was the viewfinder. Most GoPro cameras do not have a viewfinder, 
nor do they need one since the camera is often in the middle of action that you are 
not. That’s what makes the Capture app, as seen in Figure 5-13, so important: It 
allows you to monitor the scene from a safe distance and make mode and settings 
changes.
Viewing footage on a tablet  
or smartphone
After you shoot your footage, you can watch it on a mobile device. In film lingo, 
this footage represents dailies you can watch anywhere you want. You can even 
browse and delete content from your camera to free space or include more com-
pelling footage.
FIGURE 5-13:

Capture app.

110     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Shooting Some Variations
Editing a movie is a lot like assembling a jigsaw puzzle: Success depends on put-
ting the right pieces together. Puzzle pieces are predetermined, but your movie 
isn’t. That’s why you need to capture variations in your setup shots and cutaways.
Don’t be stingy when it comes to shooting your movie. That extra footage can not 
only better capture your movie, but also add more flexibility when it comes time 
for editing. So why settle for a single take when you can capture it several more 
times to get it perfect? Besides, it wasn’t unusual for a movie to have a 20:1 ratio 
when it was shot on film. You’re shooting on a memory card that you can down-
load and erase.
But making sure you’ve shot enough variations of each scene differs from hap-
hazardly capturing whatever you see and expecting to turn it into a cohesive 
movie. Instead, carefully decide the content of your film and then make sure that 
the technical and aesthetic settings match your intentions.

Shooting Fun Stuff with 
Your GoPro
O
nce upon a time, those edge-of-your seat extreme action scenes were best 
left to the professionals. Compelling, yet risky situations like base jump-
ing, extreme biking, or shooting from a high-speed roller coaster required 
a certain skillset for capture — with a good part of that skillset being the ability 
to keep yourself out of a body cast. Even slightly less intense action like mountain 
biking or skateboarding posed a potential threat to your physical safety, not to 
mention the equipment. Adventurous shooters often left behind a trail of smashed 
cameras, shattered lenses, and broken dreams.
GoPro changed the game, allowing you to capture thrilling situations while keep-
ing you and the camera safer. With the right flair, you can introduce excitement 
to your movies and photos, without necessarily putting yourself in harm’s way. 
By no means does that give you license for recklessness, especially where your 
life is concerned. It’s just that some situations look daring, yet are no longer as 
dangerous to shoot because you’re not attached to the camera as much. Simply 
put, mounting the camera and controlling it from a distance can keep you and 
the camera safe. Other situations are bit more docile, so you can hold or wear the 
camera, while still providing a thrill for the audience.

Using Wearable Mounts
Wearing a GoPro is the latest rage in fashion, said no one, ever. But what these 
wearable mounting options lack in fashion sense, they make up for in practicality. 
While you can handhold your GoPro, it’s simply better to mount it when shoot-
ing movies or taking pictures. Handholding your GoPro isn’t much different than 
walking your cat on a leash. Yeah, it’s possible, but there’s something unnatural 
about it. Instead, cats do better when untethered from your hand, and so does a 
GoPro. This mighty little camera was meant for mounting, and one of the best 
ways to do it is by wearing it. You can read about the individual ways in Chapter 2, 
and say, “Look Ma, no hands.”
Is that a camera on your head?
It’s highly unlikely that wearing the Head Strap lands you on the cover of GQ or 
Vogue, yet it does provide the ultimate perspective for a POV shot. Thanks to the 
camera being so close to your eye line every time you turn, pivot, or tilt, the viewer 
can feel what you feel and see what you see. So, while resembling something 
between a spelunker and a walking bipod, you can capture each situation with a 
compelling perspective, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Here are few tips for doing it as gracefully as possible:

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     113
»
» Walk at a steady pace: Even, level strides lead to smooth, professional 
looking capture, while the not-so-even ones scream to the viewer that you 
have a camera stuck to your head.
»
» Fit it comfortably: The Head Strap is adjustable, so the better it fits, the better 
your chances for stable video, not to mention also keeping it from falling off 
your head. (Taking the time necessary to fit the attachment comfortably is of 
particular importance if it is to be worn over extended periods of time.)
»
» Limit jarring moves: While we’re used to moving our heads rapidly at times, 
it doesn’t always translate to video, unless of course the goal was to make 
people queasy. Instead, pretend you’re in slow motion and make slow, 
deliberate motions as you change camera perspective.
Wearing the camera in a crowd
When it comes to using a camera in close quarters, GoPro seems perfect for 
shooting in a New York City apartment. Because it offers the perfect combina-
tion of diminutive size, ultra-wide-angle lens, and fashionable wearability — all 
right, maybe fashionable is a stretch — GoPro is the perfect camera for capturing  
subjective perspective on the move as you navigate through a sea of humans. 
Standing in lines, meandering through a crowd, or Walking on a busy city street 
can all produce impressive imagery when wearing your GoPro camera on the Head 
Strap, Chesty, or using the Strap.
Here’s some advice when wearing the camera around a lot of people:
»
» Use the app to monitor: While personal perspective is charming, accurate 
composition is sublime. That comes from using the screen as an aid to 
effectively navigate the shoot, control settings, and adjust the angle of view.
»
» Watch your step: Since it’s unlikely you’d want to trip over a curb, bump into 
someone, or have a pedestrian collision, it’s important to be careful when 
you’re capturing a scene in the middle of a crowd. So, walk carefully, and keep 
an eye on where you’re going when watching the monitor.
»
» Keep a safe distance: Not just because you want to avoid contact with other 
humans, but also because being too close to the subject can affect focus, and 
not in a good way.
»
» Chest or head: Sometimes you get the orchestra, and other times, you get 
the balcony. You know, top and bottom. Wearing a GoPro on your head or 
chest is the same way. Each has its own charm with a specific purpose. 
Wearing the camera on your head lends itself nicely to those point-of-view 
shots with twists, turns, and peeking inside places. Wearing a GoPro on your 

114     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
chest is more stable and better for linear walks through a crowd. One 
problem, though, is that it points slightly downward.
Capturing life behind the scenes
Sometimes working the crowd relies less on walking the line and more about 
making the viewer feel privy to something that seemed off-limits. Take them on 
a walk-thru of a house you’re looking to sell, backstage at a rock concert, or on 
the field for the festivities of a sporting event (see Figure 6-2). All these situations 
come to life when you depict them from your point-of-view. It makes the audi-
ence feel like they’re walking through the scene.
Consider the following:
»
» Be deliberate: Move slowly through the scene so that the viewer can absorb 
the action. If you’re shooting a real estate video, walk slowly so that the viewer 
can see the key features of the dwelling.
»
» Get up close and personal: Walk closer to the more interesting parts of the 
scene, and stay on them to help the viewer know those parts are important. 
For example, if you’re backstage at a concert, meandering through the circus 
atmosphere before the show can make an interesting scene. You can watch 
the guitarist tune up, watch the band play before an empty venue at a sound 
check, or record the drummer gorging at craft services.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     115
Not everyone has access to all situations, yet there’s always something that you 
can shoot. Here are a few places you can try:
»
» Construction sites
»
» Real estate viewings
»
» Sporting events
»
» Amusement parks
»
» Museums and galleries
»
» Family picnics
Strapping the camera on a limb
The Strap is the newest wearable mounting accessor that fits over any of your 
appendages. Wear it on an arm or leg so that you can capture uniquely immersive 
POV footage, capturing the scene, literally hands-free. This comes in handy, no 
pun intended, for situations that demand the attention of your hands, like riding 
a horse, swimming underwater, snowboarding, and other activities. The mount is 
fully adjustable with a 360 degrees rotation and tilt for maximum control.
Shooting on Amusement Park Rides
Taking your GoPro to the theme park lets you relive the thrill of screaming your 
head off without any of the motion sickness that sometimes goes with it. It sounds 
like a win-win when you’re out there recording the energy of a roller coaster, the 
exhilaration of a water ride, the simple aesthetic of a carousel ride, or the freedom 
of the chaired swing ride, as shown in Figure 6-3. Each situation provides differ-
ent levels of adventure, albeit one being more dulcet than the others. It’s the last 
one if you weren’t sure, and one of the most interesting.
Consider the following when recreating the magic of your day at the amusement 
park:
»
» Putting safety first: While each attraction offers its type of thrill, you should 
always err on the side of caution by abiding by the rules of the ride. Keep your 
hands and feet inside, and don’t wear the camera in a way that affects any 
restraints.

116     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Loving the POV shot: Effectively capturing your point of view lets you 
recreate the excitement of the ride as your eyes saw it. Both the Head Strap 
and Chesty let you subjectively capture this view. Both mounts are effective. 
Wearing the camera on your head better matches your eye line, creating a 
more natural perspective. Wearing it on your chest produces a lower angle, as 
it naturally sits downward.
»
» Capture your expression: Turn the camera around and record the look on 
your face as you negotiate the ride, or more appropriately, capturing the 
most fun kind of selfie. All right, it doesn’t have to be you. Regardless of whose 
expression you capture, you must be careful where you mount the camera in 
the name of safety. Common sense dictates not mounting the camera on the 
ride itself.
»
» Shoot photos on Burst: When shooting movies, you can start recording 
before the ride takes off, but still photography is more challenging. So instead 
of trying to shoot single frames, it’s best to set the camera on Burst. It can 
capture up to 30 pictures per second.
Exaggerate the ride experience
Like the fresh taste of a piece of bubble gum, the average roller coaster ride lasts 
around two minutes. And while you always wish both lasted longer, it’s doubtful 
your audience feels the same way about your footage. Perhaps the axiom, less is 
more, acts more like the rule when it comes to how much you show the viewer. 
Shoot the entire experience, but just show a sliver of the action in the movie.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     117
Here are some suggestions:
»
» Time-Lapse: Even the most moderate interval setting for a time-lapse can 
make the action appear 15 times faster than normal. That 40-mph ride can 
appear as if it’s moving at 600 miles per hour, rendering it like hyper-drive.
»
» Slow Motion: What is more ironic than reducing the super-fast activity of a 
ride moving 40 miles per hour to one that creeps at a snail’s pace. When using 
this mode, you want to shoot at the highest possible frame rate. And if you 
shoot at 720p, you can use a frame rate of 240 fps.
»
» Play in reverse: While you can’t do it while shooting, it’s certainly possible during 
playback. It makes for a fun viewing experience when you capture someone 
diving into the pool head first to coming out of the water feet first to the diving 
board. Or a busy street scene filled with pedestrians walking backwards.
Mastering each attraction with  
the right panache
Common sense dictates that your approach to capturing the thrill of a heart-
stopping ride is not the same as shooting something more graceful. ­Rollercoasters 
and carousels are as distinctly different as oil and vinegar, and so are the tech-
niques for effectively capturing them. Both collectively make your movie inter-
esting, yet are completely different in every way, so each requires a different 
approach for capture.
Having fun on the roller coaster
When it comes to shooting a roller coaster, GoPro lets you relive the oohs and 
ahs of the deep drops, sharp turns, and your own falsetto screams. Capturing 
those brief moments are as simple as wearing the camera on the ride and pressing 
record to recreate a subjective perspective of the thrill. Sitting in the front of the 
ride provides an unobstructed view, as seen in Figure 6-4, but that’s not to say 
you can’t get great footage from the middle or even the rear.
Let’s look at the different kinds of shots.
»
» POV: Show the ride as you see it by wearing the camera on your chest or 
mount it close to your own perspective using a Head Strap, Chesty, or the 
Strap. (Use it on your arm, wrist, or leg.) You can show a subjective view, 
people raising arms in front of you, or looking upwards.
»
» Selfie: Turn the camera around and allow the viewer to read the action from 
your expression, including the shrieks and screams.

118     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Working the angles: Just because you’re not on the ride doesn’t mean you 
should put the camera away. Capturing the ride as a bystander lets you create 
an objective wide shot that works out for editing. The wide, medium, close-up 
approach for shot sequence works well, especially when the goal is editing a 
cohesive package.
When on the rides, there are some other issues to consider:
»
» Being careful: Unfortunately, it’s not always safe to bring your camera on a 
roller coaster or even always allowed by officials, so you must proceed with 
caution. If you can bring the camera on the ride, be sure it’s firmly mounted 
and does not fly away. You can lose it, break it, or worse, hurt someone.
»
» Abrupt movement: The rides move very fast and sometimes come to a 
screeching halt. Literally, you’ve heard that sound before. So, make sure the 
camera is secure or it can be knocked out of your hand. If that happens, losing 
the camera is not the worst thing that can happen; you can hurt someone, too.
»
» Privacy issues: I’m going to go out on a limb here, but most people don’t like 
being part of a movie they were not asked to be in. That goes double when 
they’re at their most visually vulnerable, replete with bad hair and angry 
scowl. It’s better to record people that you know — friends and family — to 
avoid any issues. Of course, you can always ask for contact information and 
get permission too.
»
» Shoot at a higher frame rate: Shooting in 1080p with a frame rate of at least 
60 fps will help assure the action is crisp.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     119
Shooting water rides
Whether sliding down on a raft, a log-like Flintstones car, or with your own 
body, water rides are like rollercoasters under really wet conditions. Capture your 
point of view as you’re screaming joyfully — or panicky — all the way down. 
It’s pretty much the same idea as shooting on a roller coaster, with one caveat: 
the water part. Electronics are allergic to H2O and that makes it challenging at 
times to see what you’re seeing since you can’t use your app or have access to the 
camera, even if there’s a screen. But these problems are easily fixed when you take 
heed of the following.
»
» Secure the camera: Holding the camera under normal circumstances is a 
tricky endeavor. Moving makes it harder, and doing it under wet circum-
stances makes it even trickier. Try to wear the camera, and if you can’t, 
hold it tight.
»
» Keep the lens clean: Water droplets on the lens are an occupational hazard, 
and can rob the image of sharpness or image quality. So, give it a wipe every 
so often.
»
» Have faith: You can’t use the app (unless you want to short-circuit your 
smartphone), so just point the camera in the right direction and hope for 
the best.
Capturing the carousel experience
The carousel does not provide quite the same thrill as a roller coaster — unless 
you find individually painted ponies thrilling — but it’s still one of the most pho-
tographed places in an amusement park (see Figure  6-5). Due partially to the 
timeless elegance of each carousel, not to mention being the perfect vehicle to 
capture small children and everyone else that doesn’t like big rides.
MAKING LONG LINES WORK FOR YOU
Theme park attractions and long lines go together like hot dogs and a stomachache. 
Both go hand in hand, and oddly enough, waiting in line is something that we secretly 
admire. Say what? Yes, it’s true, numerous studies have shown the longer we wait for 
something the more we appreciate the outcome. Anyway, that makes the waiting in line 
a big part of the thrill, so why not capture it as part of the movie.

120     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Here are a few aspects to consider:
»
» Wear the camera: Wearing your GoPro as the ride goes round and round 
and up and down makes for an interesting movie. And you’re doing nothing 
more than wearing the camera as an accessory.
»
» Move with the ride: The nature of a carousel means that you’re always on 
the horse in back and the horse in front. You will never catch up to the horse 
in front or lose your lead to the horse behind you. But the action outside of 
the ride, as well as the up and down nature of the ponies does change 
allowing you to capture action without leaving your seat, er saddle. If you’re 
standing and walking, then all bets are off.
»
» Focus on the horse: That’s meant both figuratively and literally. It’s not always 
a horse; sometimes it’s a tiger or another exotic animal. While you can shoot 
other aspects, the painted horse, for this discussion, is the main attraction. 
Their unique colors and adornments make each one visually unique, so when 
you add a little motion . . . voilà!
Round and round on the Ferris wheel
Colorful, circular, and colossal (at times), the Ferris wheel is one of the most 
iconic symbols of an amusement park. Maybe it’s not as thrilling as other action 
FIGURE 6-5:

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     121
rides  — unless, of course, if you’re afraid of heights  — but it does make for 
­visually interesting movies and pictures (see Figure 6-6).
Consider the following:
»
» Long exposure still image: All it takes is a two-second exposure while the 
ride is in motion to produce beautiful streaks of color. Try to make sure you fill 
the frame with the entire ride, but that should be no problem with your GoPro.
»
» Time-Lapse: Position the camera nearby and set an interval of a half-second 
or more to record the ride’s rotation as colorful streaks. Don’t be shy captur-
ing the ride from afar.
»
» Movie: Capture the ride from a distance or shoot from your perspective on 
the ride itself.
Recording Sporting Events
Shooting sports takes on a different life when capturing action scenes with your 
GoPro. Unlike shooting from a distance with a DSLR and a long lens, the GoPro 
requires far more intimacy with the subject; in other words, you need to be very 
close. That means sitting in Section 5 Row 20 of an arena or stadium will more 
than likely yield better shots of people’s heads than any sort of decipherable action. 
FIGURE 6-6: 
View from the 
Ferris wheel.

122     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
That means with few exceptions, it’s not very good for capturing organized sport-
ing events. Conversely, it can work beautifully with the not so organized variety. 
Activities like a pick-up basketball game, volleyball at the beach, or whiffle ball 
at a family picnic can produce content for your own version of Sports Center, or 
something viral on YouTube.
Bringing your camera to a baseball or football game can have a lot of restrictions, 
yet there are no rules prohibiting you from wearing a camera at a pick-up game 
with your friends to get some cool footage. You don’t even have to concentrate on 
the game, as you can just shoot random action that makes for impressive movie 
clips, or just horse around (see Figure 6-7).
Here are some examples of capturing sporting events with your GoPro:
»
» Whiffle ball: That entry-level game with the plastic yellow bat and tricky 
vented ball can make for pretty cool movies and pictures, especially since the 
ball curves like no other and a hard-hit ball doesn’t travel very far. Wear the 
camera with a Chesty or on a Head Strap while pitching, fielding, or hitting. 
And speaking of the latter, you can mount the camera on the bat using a 
handlebar mount to capture the bat and ball making contact from 
inches away.
»
» Basketball: It’s a pretty rough sport to wear the camera, but that doesn’t mean 
cool action shots are off the table. Everybody loves ball tricks (see Figure 6-7). 
Maybe you want to mount the camera on the backboard, or stand underneath 
it to capture that “nothing but net” feeling, as shown previously in Figure 6-1.
»
» Football: It’s strongly advised not to wear a camera during the game, unless 
you want to be flagged for unnecessary roughness to the camera. But that 
doesn’t stop you from capturing action from the sidelines. Whether it’s a 
friendly game of two-hand touch or a hard-hitting game of smashmouth 
football, mount the camera on a goalpost or position it inches from the field 
to get up close and personal. For practice situations, you can use the helmet 
mount or the Strap on your arm or wrist to follow the action or put it on your 
leg to capture a kick.
»
» Bowling: Despite the stellar physique of bowlers, league bowling can be an 
exhilarating sport. All kidding aside, it’s still a fun activity to capture in a variety 
of ways. You can wear the Chesty and capture the release of the ball on the 
lane or the Strap on your arm to show that perspective.
»
» Golf: Watching golf on television rarely lives up to the excitement of actually 
playing. Regardless of the emotional toll it takes on you, or more accurately 
the clubs, you can capture some pretty cool stuff with your GoPro in a variety 
of ways, including wearing the camera in some way, mounting it directly on the 

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     123
club, or positioning it nearby to capture teeing off or making a putt (see 
Figure 6-8).
»
» Volleyball: Create exciting imagery playing volleyball the next time you’re at 
the beach or a family picnic. Mount the camera to the post, position it high 
above the game, or wear it (at your own risk) to capture some fun action, 
especially if you’re playing on the beach.

GoPro and the Water
Since a powerful waterproof camera sounds like something out of a fairytale, let’s 
begin by saying once upon a time most cameras were deathly allergic to water. 
And while you could also use an expensive waterproof housing on your video 
­camera or DSLR, all it took was a little moisture for your equipment to be ruined. 
But GoPro with its waterproof housing doesn’t shrink or melt. In fact, GoPro and 
water go together ­better than movie theater popcorn and imitation butter.
Using GoPro at the pool
The endless possibilities for capturing great movies and pictures around the back-
yard watering hole could make Forest Gump’s mouth spit out a litany of similes. 
Whether it’s as serious as capturing junior’s practice for an upcoming swim meet, 
the spontaneity of a bonkers pool party, or the serenity of an underwater portrait, 
GoPro should be in demand around the pool.
Here’s what you can do:
»
» Capture action in the pool: Not that long ago bringing a camera to the pool 
could be misconstrued as a sign that there was a new camera in your future. 
But with GoPro you can easily record the frolicking and splashing, in and 
around the pool area.
»
» Mount it to yourself: Wear the camera on your head, your chest, or hold it 
while walking around the pool, swim under the water, or hold the camera for 
practical control. If you choose the latter, make sure that the camera can float, 
either by mounting to The Handler or having a Floaty on it.
»
» Shoot the subject hitting the surface: Capture someone breaking the plane 
of the water as they jump or dive in. Position yourself near the point of entry, 
even under the water.
»
» Capture underwater activity: Whether you’re capturing a surrealistic 
portrait of your significant other, your daughter holding her nose under the 
water for the first time, children swimming underwater (see Figure 6-9), or a 
unique portrait, you can create beautiful images beneath the surface.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     125
Shooting water sports
Marco Polo takes on new meaning when GoPro is in the pool showing the chase. 
The counting, swimming, and the calling out of the name of the game all make for 
a fun movie at the end of the day. The same holds true for other exhilarating water 
sports, such as volleyball, basketball, or underwater races. Basically, anything you 
can play in the water that’s competitive is a good match for GoPro.
While many of these activities are distinctly different, here’s what you should 
consider:
»
» Visualize what you want: There’s an old saying that goes “You can’t get what 
you want, until you know what you want.” That applies to many situations you 
will capture with your GoPro, especially here. Think about how you want the 
audience to see your movie, and capture it with that intent.
»
» Make sure the camera can float: Seems like a no-brainer, but you would be 
surprised. All it takes is a Floaty or the Floating Hand Grip to keep your runaway 
camera on the surface.
»
» Don’t be afraid to get under the water: Some of the coolest scenes are 
captured below the surface. Just make sure your housing is watertight.
Take GoPro to the beach
GoPro cozies up as nicely at the beach as a blanket and an umbrella. It’s small, 
lightweight, and fits anywhere, so it’s not a burden to lug around. And the housing 
FIGURE 6-9:

for GoPro.

126     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
protects the camera by keeping out water, sand, and other debris, making it easily 
accessible to capture movies and stills in places where you had to be more careful 
before.
Here are some things to keep in mind when you bring your GoPro camera to the 
beach:
»
» Fun on the sand: Throwing a Frisbee around, running in surf, making 
sandcastles, playing volleyball, and anything else you do at the beach are 
perfect situations to capture, without fear of sand or water damage.
»
» Wave jumping: Wear the camera as you negotiate each wave with awkward 
precision. Just be careful you don’t drop the camera or it doesn’t break free; 
otherwise it will end up in Davey Jones’s locker.
»
» Underwater scenes: Going underwater to make movies or photographs of 
the seascape is easy with your GoPro. Just make sure you have something 
that allows the camera to float, or it will be gone forever.
»
» Surfing: There’s a special mount designed specifically for your board, shown 
in Figure 6-10, so that you can hang ten while yelling “cowabunga,” or 
screaming at a wave, or sometimes for your life. See Chapter 2 for more 
information on this special mount.
»
» Body surfing: Wear it while riding the board or mount the camera to the 
board so you can capture the experience.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     127
Using GoPro on a personal watercraft
The personal watercraft resembles the offspring of a motorcycle and a powerboat. 
Known more familiarly by a bunch of brand names like Sea-Doo, Wave Runner, 
or Jet Ski, these water scooters are thrilling to ride and just as exciting to capture 
with your GoPro.
Here’s what you can do:
»
» Mount on the vessel: Depending on the model, you can use the appropriate 
mount to provide a subjective view of breaking waves. Just use common sense 
and place it in where it doesn’t interfere with your safety or anyone else’s.
»
» Wear it: Probably the best way to capture those special moments on the 
water is to wear the camera. Put on the Chesty for a subjective view for 
commandeering the vessel. It does have a slightly downward view, acceptable 
under certain conditions. You can also use the Head Strap, though there’s a 
chance it can fly off your head, leaving you strapped for a camera. And if it 
happens there, it’s even more of a risk while handholding — unless your goal 
is losing the camera rather than capturing thrilling footage.
Movies on a boat, movies in the moat
Whether you’re navigating a kayak through marshlands, capturing the thrill of an 
outrigger canoe hitting that massive wave, or zipping around the bay in a motor-
boat, your GoPro is up for the challenge, transforming nautical time into compel-
ling movies and photographs (see Figure 6-11).
Here are some ideas for positioning the camera:
»
» Mount it: Depending on the boat, there are numerous places you can mount 
the camera. These include any smooth (and clean) surface for the suction cup, 
various bar mounts, or the more permanent adhesive mounts.
»
» Hold it: It’s a bit risky, especially when hanging the camera over the edge of 
the boat, but you can control the composition more precisely than stationary 
mounts. Make sure you’re using some flotation accessories to be on the 
safe side. And the safe side for a camera that falls in the water is the side 
above the surface. Tethering the camera to the vessel, or even yourself, 
can also help.

128     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Wear it: Channel your inner Leonardo DiCaprio as you stand on the bow 
screaming “Kink of the oiled,” or something like it with the camera on your 
body, preferably with the Chesty.
Making fishing interesting
Regardless of your reason – you know, food or sport — angling over a watering 
hole takes on new meaning when attaching your GoPro to your fishing pole. Using 
the Sportsman mount lets you capture those great moments on the water from a 
poles-eye view (see Figure 6-12). Now you can finally record that moment when 
you reel in the big one. The only problem is that you can’t exaggerate the size of 
the one that got away, unless you got it on video.
Consider the following when capturing your day on the water.
»
» Mount the camera: Put GoPro on your fishing pole using the Sportsman 
mount, so you can capture the pole at work.
»
» Wear the camera on your head: Record the experience like your eyes would 
see. You know, stuff like casting, reeling, or reeling in the big one.
»
» Use an extension pole: It’s the fish’s version of the selfie stick. Hold the 
camera over the action, almost like you would a net for a unique view.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     129
All Kinds of Bicycling
When it comes to one of the most accessible places for capturing action, it’s hard 
to imagine a better combination than a GoPro and a bicycle, other than sunscreen 
and a scorching hot day at the beach. Whether you’re navigating a mountain trail, 
going on a scenic tour, or riding one of those city rentals, bicycling is one of the 
more popular activities you can capture with your GoPro, and that’s meant in both 
the literal and figurative sense. And unlike vanilla ice cream, none of this has to 
be too bland. There’s a bunch of situations to capture with various mounts and 
techniques that can pepper the imagery. Don’t worry if the bike isn’t powered by 
you because you can substitute many of these shots on a motorcycle or ATV.
Let’s consider some of the cool ways to use your GoPro while peddling around:
»
» Mount it on handlebars: Several choices are possible, including the standard 
handlebar mount, or the new Pro Handlebar mount. That one allows you to 
rotate the camera 360 degrees for unlimited capture options; facing forward, 
it provides a subjective perspective. Or you could turn it around, and show the 
viewer your expression and all that you pass. (See Figure 6-13)
»
» Point it downward: Regardless if you wear the camera on your chest or have 
it mounted on a frame, you can show the ride from the perspective of the 
front wheel turning, pedals cranking, or terrain the bike has passed.
»
» Use the helmet mount: Allows the viewer to experience the ride at an angle 
of view much closer to your perspective, and it’s also safer than using the 
Head Strap for both you and the camera. (See Figure 6-13.)

»
» Hang it: The new Pro Seat Rail mount clamps to the back of your seat, 
allowing you to capture a low profile, rear-facing camera position. This 
perspective captures everything and everyone travelling behind the bike.
Taking Flight with Your Karma Drone
Aboard the Karma drone, your GoPro can soar over whatever corner of the world 
you call your own, allowing you to capture a rarely seen perspective for your 
­movies and still photos. It’s like giving Peter Pan a camera and asking him to 
capture the rooftops of your town, only you’re doing it with a remote control and 
don’t have to deal with his boyish tantrums. The Karma — or any other drone 
that holds a GoPro — lets you see places you may not venture toward, and from a 
perspective you’re not accustomed, without ever putting you in harm’s way. But 
it’s important to understand how to operate it and the local ordinances to keep 
Karma, yourself, and others safe.
Practice makes perfect
While your Karma drone can capture impressive video from extreme heights with-
out putting you at risk, the same cannot be said for your Karma. Simply put, the 
physical reality of what goes up must come down applies and works here, unless, 
of course, it comes down too quickly or perhaps veers off course into a  wall.

CHAPTER 6  Shooting Fun Stuff with Your GoPro     131
It’s such a downer when you have to take your drone home in pieces. That’s why 
practice is so important.
Consider the following:
»
» Read the instructions: When you take your drone out of the box, resist the 
urge to start flying until you understand how to use it. Instead, charge the 
vessel and remote and read the instructions.
»
» Find a flat, spacious place: The best way to get comfortable with taking off 
and landing is to practice. Choose a park or open field for those early 
missions.
»
» Stay away from trees: Trees are the drone’s natural enemy. Flying too close 
to a tree never puts you on the winning end, as your drone can get stuck on a 
branch, or lose a rotor. That’s why you should look for an open area when 
you’re first getting started.
»
» Fly on a calm day: All it takes is a wind gust to take your drone off course and 
slam it into something hard (resulting in damage) or send it far, far away (and 
lose it).
»
» Start off slow: Practice take-offs and landings, gradually going higher and 
farther. Afterwards you can practice how to move and control the camera.

Fun places for your Karma missions
Once you’re feeling confident to fly, you can have fun with your Karma drone. 
Here are some ideas for missions you can try:
»
» Take it to the beach: The shoreline usually provides a great place for flying 
your Karma drone for several reasons. The wide-open space means you can fly 
in an unobstructed airspace, free of trees and buildings. But more important, 
the shore is a beautiful place to shoot the sea, surf, and sunbathers. Just be 
aware, some people may find a GoPro flying overhead to be intrusive.
»
» Shoot a real estate scene: Whether you’re a real estate agent capturing that 
unique view for your next sale, a homeowner looking to add interesting visuals to 
your home listing, or simply want to create a visual record of a piece of property, 
flying the Karma drone overhead will help you show an impressive view.

132     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Capture action sports: Have fun at your next company softball game, beach 
volleyball match, or surfing competition. These are just a few of the events you 
can capture from overhead. Just be careful to not fly too close to the action.
»
» Record something you can’t normally see: For all those times you were 
curious of what was on the other side of a wall, the scene beyond a ridge, or 
over a bridge, you can now satisfy your curiosity with your drone.
»
» Shoot a firework display: Flying your Karma above the bursts provides a 
perspective that was rarely possible a few years ago. Just be aware of any 
ordinances before you take off.

Mastering the Light
L
ight defines how we record the world and communicate ideas through 
­movies. But not just any light will do, so don’t expect it to transform your 
GoPro movie into anything spectacular unless it’s appropriate for the scene. 
Have you ever been in an old house that uses dingy fluorescent tubes for bathroom 
illumination? If so, you know that the light makes you look like an alien — not 
just any alien, but a sick one. Compare that with your appearance in a mirror 
adorned with an array of soft tungsten bulbs. Now, that’s better.
It’s important to think of light much in the same way that a painter thinks of 
paint. She doesn’t throw it on haphazardly (unless her name is Jackson Pollock). 
Instead, she applies color very deliberately, creating both form and detail. Great 
lighting shares this idea and provides an intoxicating mystique to a scene.
Understanding the intricacies and physics of light can help you master it. This 
chapter is all about light.
Seeing the Color and Temperature of Light
Ever wonder why the picture of your cat on the living-room couch had a yellow 
cast or what caused Uncle Freddie to look so blue that he looked like he needed 
some resuscitation? Funny things can happen when the color isn’t quite right. 
Sometimes, we can live with it; at other times, it’s a challenge. Though many 
Chapter 7

134     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
scenes captured on a GoPro thrive on excitement, the color should nonetheless 
appear natural.
The good news: Odd color isn’t a flaw in the camera. The bad news: The camera 
wasn’t set properly to capture the color temperature of the light source or the 
automatic white balance was fooled. Then there’s the beautiful news: Some scenes 
have a wide range of color temperature that render the image unexpectedly stun-
ning (see Figure 7-1).
Taking color temperature
Our brains can differentiate color, but we may not notice when a shadow looks a 
little blue or when there’s a limited spectrum of color. When you capture a scene 
with a camera, however, colors become quite apparent, because different light 
sources have their own ways of producing color.
If you view a piece of white paper under lights ranging from an indoor light bulb 
to the midday sun, you still see it as white. That’s simply a function of your visual 
memory. The camera will record it as white, too, but it may render it with a blue 
or orange tinge, because the color temperature of the light may differ from what 
the camera is set to record.
Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures help you determine what to wear when you 
leave the house; Kelvin temperatures (K), however, measure light. Kelvin color 
temperatures range from candlelight at 1800K to overcast sky at 11000K.
FIGURE 7-1:

light trails at 
twilight create 
this unique mix 
of color.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     135
Table 7-1 lists color temperatures in Kelvins for a few common light sources.
Understanding white balance
White balance refers to setting the camera to record light at its proper color 
­temperature. Simply put, a camera renders a white piece of paper as white when 
its white balance is set properly for a specific type of illumination. Many cameras, 
including the GoPro, adjust to the proper setting automatically, but unlike with 
Mother Nature, automatic settings are often fooled.
One way to counteract disparity in color is to set white balance on the camera 
to match a specific situation. I cover this topic in more detail in “Setting White 
­Balance” later in this chapter.
Shooting Under Different  
Light Sources
We humans see light as the antidote to darkness, but we’re often oblivious to 
its physical properties, such as direction, harshness, and color temperature. Our 
visual memory kicks in, and the only criterion is seeing what we need to see.
A camera, however, has no visual memory. Instead, it relies on its settings. 
Like Mr. Spock from Star Trek, it deals with color and exposure in a logical way.

136     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
But even when you set the GoPro on automatic and let it adjust to each circum-
stance, success isn’t guaranteed. Sometimes, a scene reproduces with a color cast, 
which may not match other scenes. You may have a bluish tint on one shot and a 
cyan cast on another.
Although the GoPro has a fairly intuitive automatic white balance (see “Setting 
White Balance” later in this chapter), an important part of mastering GoPro 
­moviemaking is understanding the behaviors of different kinds of light.
Sunlight
The primary source of light on the planet resides an average distance of 93 ­million 
miles away. The sun provides summer pleasure, vitamin D, and sometimes redis-
tributed energy, and did I mention it’s also the recorded image’s best friend.
When you’re making movies outdoors, the quality of sunlight changes continu-
ously throughout the day with regard to both intensity and color. If you were to 
start shooting at daybreak, for example, you’d reap the benefits of soft morning 
light, often referred to as the Golden Hour. for its flattering illumination. That 
means early morning light renders much warmer than the daylight setting on 
your GoPro (5500 K; see “Taking color temperature,” earlier in this chapter), so it 
reproduces as an orange glow on the subject. It’s also coming from just above the 
horizon, so it’s not lighting the subject from overhead.
Even though light still flatters the subject a couple of hours into the morning, the 
quality of illumination begins to transform as the sun gets higher. High noon puts 
the sun directly overhead, producing far less warmth and harsher illumination.
Some days, the clouds roll in, making the afternoon overcast. That type of light 
isn’t great for the beach but not too bad for shooting a movie, thanks to the nicely 
diffused illumination. It lacks the warmth of early morning light, but you could 
tweak it in postproduction.
Later in the day, when the sun breaks through the clouds, the color balance of 
the scene takes on the warmth of early morning, but in the reverse direction (see 
Figure 7-2).
Clearly, shooting outdoors covers a wide range of color temperatures. It’s vital 
that you make manual adjustments when necessary, as I discuss in “Bathing in 
sunlight” later in this chapter.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     137
Household lights
When it comes to indoor moviemaking, most of the time you’re going to shoot 
under household lighting conditions. But the game has changed with the incan-
descent light bulb we all knew, loved, and occasionally burned our fingers on 
being phased out. In its place, more economical light forms are taking over. Some 
share similarities with formerly bulbous light sources, while others have their 
own qualities.
CFL bulbs
Until very recently, most lamps used incandescent bulbs (discussed later in this 
chapter), but these days, you’re more likely to see compact fluorescent light (CFL) 
bulbs than many other types of illumination, including illuminated signs, like in 
Figure 7-3.
CFLs are so common now that you can find them almost everywhere, but they 
have many variations, which makes it hard to nail down the exact color tempera-
ture of each one. Because they produce light differently from incandescent bulbs, 
they’re not very predictable when it comes to shooting your movie. Instead of 
heating a filament to burn brightly, they produce light through a jolt of electric-
ity that excites vapor in the tube, sharing behavior with their taller cousin, the 
fluorescent tube.
But ingenuity is a wonderful thing. Because these lights are so popular and cheap 
to operate, they’ve been engineered to create various light settings, including a full 
spectrum of color. That makes them great for lighting television and movie sets.

138     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
LED bulbs
Watches, scoreboards, and televisions use it, and now so does the lighting in 
your home. The LED lamp is quickly becoming one of the most efficient forms of 
­artificial light on the planet. Consisting of an array of light emitting diodes, they 
collectively form illumination in places where bulbs used to reside.
An interesting quality about some of these light forms is that the same bulb can 
create any color you like, and can be controlled from your smartphone or device. 
They screw into lamps and fixtures, and can be combined to make any combina-
tions of colors you choose.
On the bright side (pun intended), LED lighting offers the most control over the 
light. Conversely, it is more expensive and does not provide a high light output.
Halogen bulbs
A true incandescent light source, these lamps offer a high output and naturally 
produce a full spectrum of color that generally matches tungsten.
Halogen bulbs are found in many places, including automotive headlamps, 
­projector bulbs, and studio lighting. While they usually don’t resemble a tradi-
tional household bulb, some types now include a screw base for use in lamp and 
fixture sockets.
These lamps have a wide variety of uses and come in various sizes and types. On 
the downside, they get very hot and are sometimes used for heating purposes. 
Ever hear of a halogen oven?

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     139
Incandescent bulbs
Incandescent light bulbs are traditional light bulbs, the ones that appear above 
cartoon characters’ heads whenever they have a great idea. Brightness varies 
from 25-watt appliance bulbs to the 60-, 75-, and 100-watt bulbs used in reading 
lamps. Flood lighting can go to 150 watts, but generally anything equivalent to 
65 watts is more common.
Currently, incandescent bulbs are being phased out, but people have stocked up on 
them. Incandescent illumination is shown in Figure 7-4.
Fluorescent lights
Tubes of light seem like perfect ways to deliver illumination. These long, bright 
sticks are efficient, effective, and used everywhere from basements and garages to 
factories and offices. They make light through a jolt of electricity exciting vapor in 
the tube. While generally not ideal for shooting a movie, there are numerous types 
engineered to produce a full spectrum of color. Some are even used for television 
and movie lighting. Here’s what you need to know:
»
» Daylight-balanced tubes: While comparatively lower in output than an 
incandescent bulb, they offer mass illumination. Sometimes four separate 
tubes can produce the same output, albeit by using a wider, more ­collective  
approach.
»
» Mixed lighting makes a good picture: Look at any office building and notice 
the variations in color cast. Lighting your movie with tungsten and allowing the

140     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
variations of fluorescent light in the background produces a complementary 
cast that works to your advantage.
»
» Not a harsh bone in its, the subject’s body: Because illumination comes 
from a wide bank of soft lamps, it produces a nice soft illumination. As a result, 
it hides minor blemishes, making many actors fans of it.
»
» No heat buildup: There’s a reason these are also known as “cool lights.” 
Trust me, they’re a welcome alternative, especially when using a multiple light 
tungsten setup in the studio or location area. Fluorescent illumination doesn’t 
create excess heat, and you can touch the bulbs.
Candlelight
If the sun is the Big Kahuna, candlelight is the little guy. It’s the warmest and least 
powerful light source (below 2000 K; refer to “Taking color temperature,” earlier 
in this chapter) range, and by itself, it can barely cover a foot. But candlelight is 
still light. A group of candles can illuminate a whole scene, lending it a warm and 
cozy feeling. Because the GoPro gets very close, it can work nicely for candlelit 
scenes.
Neon lights
Iconic neon signs such as “Bar” are glass sculptures with illuminated colored 
light running through their tubes. Neon is reminiscent of the night, and can ren-
der the scene with a cool tone, if not for its dominant color.
Outdoor lights (HID)
Lighting up the night takes a lot of power, and that can get expensive for whoever 
pays the bill. So, the goal in illuminating massive spaces is producing the most 
light for the least money. Many government agencies and businesses use a special 
kind of outdoor illumination: high-intensity discharge (HID) lights.
Like CFLs (see “CFL bulbs,” earlier in this chapter), HID lights excite a gas inside 
a glass tube, producing cheap, bright light. They come in three varieties:
»
» Sodium vapor: What you regard as a streetlight, lighting experts and city 
designers know as a sodium-vapor lamp on a pole. Look closely, and you’ll 
notice that its light has a yellowish cast (see Figure 7-5).

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     141
»
» Mercury vapor: Mercury-vapor lamps are far less flattering to most subjects 
than sodium-vapor lamps are, because they produce greenish illumination 
from exciting mercury gas. This color makes them problematic when it comes 
to video. When it comes to producing the most economical illumination, these 
guys are great for parking lots, garages, and even some school gymnasiums. 
On average, they have a color temperature of about 4200 K (see “Taking color 
temperature,” earlier in this chapter).
»
» Metal halide: Like the other HID lamps, metal-halide lamps produce light by 
exciting weird gases, but unlike those lamps, they also produce a full spectrum 
of color. And the reason for their hybrid nature? Metal-halide lamps are used 
to light many outdoor stadiums, and nobody wants to see anything but the 
richest, most saturated color when watching football on a big screen TV.
Setting White Balance
If you’re feeling adventurous or simply want to control the color temperature of 
a scene on your GoPro, feel free to change the White Balance setting. By default, 
your GoPro is set to Auto, but you have other options, including these:
»
» Auto: Adjusts automatically to the color temperature of the light source.
»
» 3000K: Works well for capturing indoor scenes.
»
» 5500K: Lets you manually balance color outdoors.
FIGURE 7-5:

142     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» 6500K: Matches the color temperature of moderately overcast skies and 
some forms of fluorescent lighting.
»
» Camera RAW: Records a RAW file so you can adjust the color temperature 
during the postproduction process (see Figure 7-6).
Here’s how you can change the White Balance setting:
1.	 Press the Power/Mode button to scroll through the menus until you get 
to the Settings menu.
The Settings menu’s icon looks like a wrench.
2.	 Press the Shutter/Select button to select Settings.
3.	 Make sure Protune is on.
Otherwise the White Balance menu will not be visible.
4.	 Scroll until you get to capture settings.
Enter it by pressing the Shutter/Select button.
5.	 Go to the White Balance option.
6.	 Use the Shutter/Select to select one of the following options: Auto, 3000K, 
5500K, 6500K, or Camera Raw, and press the Power/Mode button to set it.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     143
Working with the Light You Have
Because many action sequences take place outdoors, you need the sun for illumi-
nation. That big, flaming ball of fire in the sky offers bright, diverse, and com-
plimentary illumination. It not only flatters the subject, but it’s also free. But 
that doesn’t mean there isn’t a slight price to pay. It’s a passive light form that 
leaves you with no control over it, and you just must accept its direction of light, 
the shadow it creates, or its light quality. Seems like a fair price to pay when you 
consider what you get in return.
One day, the light renders warmly against a rich blue sky, and the next day it’s 
completely different. Sometimes the background sky renders palely; other times it’s 
completely overcast. The sun is always in the sky, but that stuff in between — you 
know the clouds and haze — can affect what the sun can do on a predictable basis.
Consider the following:
»
» Watch out for lens flare: Because the GoPro is so wide, there’s a greater 
possibility for lens flare. That means you need to be careful.
»
» Try to use sunlight from a lower angle: This creates the most flattering 
illumination, and it’s generally warmer too.
»
» Avoid overhead light: When the sun is beating straight down on the subject, 
it’s not flattering and creates harsh shadows.
»
» Take advantage of an overcast day: Direct sunlight is sometimes harsh on 
the subject because it skims across the face and creates shadow and texture. 
Most people don’t like it. Clouds come between the sun and the subject and 
act as a diffuser, presenting the subject in a more flattering illumination, as 
seen in Figure 7-7. Just watch out for white patches of sky.
Bathing in sunlight
Here are a few ways to make the most of sunlight:
»
» Work the angles. I don’t mean working the angles in a grifter sort of way; 
rather, I mean catching sunlight from different angles.
»
» Shoot early or late. Sunlight becomes more intense as the sun rises higher 
in the sky, and color temperature increases as the day goes on. A sunny-day 
color temperature is about 5500K (see “Taking color temperature,” earlier in 
this chapter) when the sun reaches its highest point. The temperature gets 
warmer as dusk approaches.

144     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Whenever possible, it’s best to shoot your movie early in the morning or late 
in the afternoon. At those times, the sun is at an angle that produces the most 
flattering illumination and the warmest tone (refer to Figure 7-8).
»
» Take advantage of clouds. Although it can be beautiful, direct sunlight can 
also produce harsh illumination. Most people don’t like being photographed 
in full sunlight. But cloud cover between the sun and the subject works like a 
giant diffuser, bathing subjects in more-flattering light.
»
» Avoid shooting at noon. High Noon is a great title for a movie but not a great 
time to shoot it. When the sun is beating straight down on the subject, it’s not 
flattering and creates harsh shadows.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     145
Managing artificial illumination
When the sun decides to call it a day, the nightscape comes to life, and individual 
forms of artificial lighting don’t play by the same set of rules as the sun. There 
are many types of artificial light, each with its own behavior (see “Shooting Under 
Different Light Sources,” earlier in this chapter). Here are a few potential prob-
lems of shooting under artificial light:
»
» Annoying color casts: Not all light sources produce a full spectrum of color, 
especially HID lamps (see “Outdoor lights [HID],” earlier in this chapter), which 
you’re likely to find on a city street or country road. Depending on the way the 
light source produces light, the scene can render with a yellowish or cyan tinge.
The good news is that a meticulous white-balance setting can eliminate a 
color cast; the bad news is that it may deplete the scene of all color. HID lights 
produce a single color, so when you correct the bad color, no others are left.
»
» Unpredictable results: Sometimes, you don’t notice the effect of color or 
contrast on your smartphone’s screen until it’s too late.
»
» Harsh shadows: Contrasty, splotchy light creates shadows that can wreak 
havoc. When you adjust for these shadows, the highlights may blow out. 
Fix the highlights, and the middle tones become shadowy.
In the following sections, I show you how to solve problems with several types of 
light sources.
Working with incandescent bulbs
It’s possible to use an array of incandescent bulbs to light your movie, but their 
effectiveness depends on a variety of factors, including wattage, placement, and 
positioning. Some tips on working with incandescent bulbs follow.
»
» Move it from the subject. It’s hard to get more basic than simply moving the 
light away, especially if it’s a lamp.
»
» Reduce its brightness. If it has a dimmer, turn it down. Other options include 
using a neutral density gel filter over your GoPro or trying a lower-wattage bulb.
»
» Remember that fall-off happens quickly: When the subject is relatively 
close (but not too close) to the light source, you can capture adequate 
exposure. But the range of light doesn’t go very far.
»
» Watch for hot spots. Because the camera covers such a wide angle, it’s 
nearly impossible to keep the actual light out of the frame. Monitor it from the 
GoPro App to compose the scene so the light is either out of the picture or 
doesn’t ruin the scene.

146     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Coping with CFLs
Here’s what you need to know about which CFLs can work to your advantage and 
which ones to avoid:
»
» Hot it’s not: Fluorescent illumination is considered a cool light form because 
it doesn’t create excess heat. Not only does this mean you can touch the bulbs 
(if you were so inclined), but also they keep the room from getting unbearably 
hot. That makes illuminating the subject from a nearby CFL far more bearable.
»
» Be careful of the color: While many CFL bulbs provide the characteristics of 
a traditional household bulb, some behave more like economical fluorescent 
tubes. That means a dim greenish cast that looks terrible when recorded. Use 
your eyes to help judge the quality of light.
»
» Hot spots need not apply: While lighting found around the home is not 
incredibly bright, it can still produce spectral hot spots (bright light reflections) 
either because the light source is in the scene, reflecting on a bright surface, 
or flaring into the lens. It’s imperative to use your smartphone to monitor the 
scene when using GoPro indoors.
Making the best of fluorescence
Old school fluorescents produce a sickly green light, but when combined on the 
scene with light sources of other color temperature, it suddenly becomes just 
another part of the scene. Look at any office building and notice the variations in 
color cast. Consider the following:
»
» Try to work with daylight-balanced: While far less bright that an incandes-
cent light bulb, illumination from a mass array of fluorescent tubes produces 
adequate lighting by using a wider, more collective approach.
»
» Take advantage of mixed light: Lighting your movie with tungsten and 
allowing the variations of fluorescent light in the background produce a 
complementary cast that works to your advantage.
»
» Take a white balance: Or at least see how your GoPro treats it on the 
automatic setting. Fluorescent lighting differs with color output; even when 
the lighting looks good to the eye, it may not reproduce as naturally as you 
may like.
Capturing candlelight
Take the following pointers into consideration when you work with candlelight:

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     147
»
» Be careful. It’s worth repeating that a candle is a fire, and fire can burn.
»
» The subject is light. A candle is one of the few light sources that you can keep 
in a scene without hoping that people think you’re just being “ironic.” Candles 
make great props as well as lighting the scene. For a table scene, measure the 
exposure from the candle, and don’t worry too much if the subject is a bit 
underexposed.
»
» There’s strength in numbers. A single candle usually isn’t enough to light a 
scene, but a group of them becomes a force to reckon with. Use a candelabra 
or multiple candleholders to create soft, warm illumination.
Loving the way that neon glows
Here are a few ways to work with neon:
»
» Use a wide range of exposures. Neon light is quite flexible when it comes to 
exposure. Underexpose it to get rich, saturated color. Overexpose it to open 
the ambient portions of the scene without losing much color from the lamp.
»
» Establish the location. Think about neon as a scene-setter. Just about any 
neon light can establish a scene, including a sign for a restaurant, hotel, or 
bowling alley.
»
» Take advantage of reflections. These colorful lights aren’t overly bright, but 
they reflect their rich colors on nearby surfaces. The effect is exponentially 
powerful when a neon sign is reflected on a rainy sidewalk.
Handling HID lights
HID light is great for finding your car keys in a parking lot or looking at city land-
marks at night, but it’s terrible for making movies.
Now, I said terrible, not impossible, because there are ways to take advantage of 
HIDs. Here are some ways to make this type of light work for you:
»
» A little goes a long way. Instead of trying to fully correct the color, just 
reduce it slightly. You’ll still have a color cast, but it won’t be overwhelming 
anymore. The footage can pass for a street scene, especially when you have 
supplemental light coming from stores, neon signs, or the taillights of 
passing cars.
»
» Shoot at twilight. Twilight still has ambient light and a variety of colors, 
including a purplish sky that looks great when you position your subject 
against it (see Figure 7-9).

148     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Because a sodium-vapor lamp’s illumination is created by excited gas, there’s 
nothing left to do after you correct the color. So, if you take a white balance of 
the scene, use a blue filter to neutralize the yellow cast, or attempt to correct 
it in postproduction, all that would remain is a monochromatic rendering of 
the subject. Unlike an incandescent light source that can be color corrected 
thanks to its full spectrum of color, these light forms only produce a single 
color. It you had to place a color temperature on this type of lamp, it would 
be comparable to tungsten, making it around 3000K.
It’s a good idea to take a white balance under metal-halide light. Depending on 
the specific type of lamp, color temperature can range from 3000K to 6000K or 
higher (see “Taking color temperature,” earlier in this chapter). Check and reset 
the white balance often.
Creating Your Own Light
Because natural light (the sun) isn’t always around, and artificial light leaves you 
in a passive role, bring your own light to the scene. The pros have done that since 
the early days, because using their own lights allows them to actively control light 
direction, intensity, and color temperature. Now you can do the same.
Lighting a scene can be as simple as using a single bulb and reflector or as elabo-
rate as employing a light kit with soft boxes, umbrellas, stands, and booms. As 
long as you have some way of lighting the scene and can keep the lights out of 
view from your GoPro, feel free to light it up.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     149
Basic lighting
Lighting a scene means using the right materials in the right way. The way you 
light your scene can help establish what you’re trying to say without the audi-
ence’s noticing a thing. Viewers absorb the movie as a whole, with lighting, action, 
and sound quality working together to sustain their attention.
Here are the basic lights you might use:
»
» Key light: As the name implies, the key light is the main source of light in a 
scene. Whether that light is the sun, an outdoor lamp, or your light kit, its main 
job is to illuminate the subject. If you place the main light at a 45-degree angle 
from the subject, half of the subject renders in shadow, which can be quite  
dramatic.
»
» Fill light: The fill light illuminates the subject from the side not affected by the 
main light. Depending on the subject, you can position the fill light at a higher 
or lower angle than the subject to fill in the shadow areas. The fill light can 
also be a reflector that redirects illumination from the main light. When you’re 
shooting outdoors, the fill light may be a large white reflector bouncing 
sunlight back on the subject.
Just make sure that the fill light doesn’t overpower the main light.
»
» Back light (or hair light): With the front of the subject adequately covered, 
you use back light to add depth to the scene and separate the subject from 
the background. Position this light high and off to the side, at a 45-degree 
angle from the subject.
Tungsten lighting
Tungsten lights are used for professional lighting in the studio and on location. 
This type of bulb produces light by heating the tungsten filament inside until it 
glows (see Figure 7-7). Studio tungsten bulbs can go as high as 1,000 watts and 
generally produce a color temperature of 3200 K (see “Taking color temperature,” 
earlier in this chapter).
Tungsten lighting comes in many forms, including the icon giant lights used on 
movie sets. Some tungsten lights use a glass lens called a Fresnel (developed for 
use in lighthouses) that maximizes the light’s potential. Studio lighting uses a 
combination of Fresnel lenses and reflectors to concentrate light on the ­subject. 
These lights produce a full spectrum of color like the sun and can be moved 
­wherever they’re needed.

150     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Nonconventional lighting
Conforming to conventional lighting is a fundamental concept of ­moviemaking. 
But what about using nonconventional lighting? You can improvise with just 
about anything that emits light, such as the following:
»
» Work lights: You may have seen work-light kits at home-improvement 
superstores. The lights use some form of tungsten bulbs; many kits have stands 
and reflectors. The light is harsh but easy to smooth out by finding a creative 
way to diffuse it. The kits are cheap — a bonus if you’re on a limited budget.
»
» Flashlight or lantern: These light sources aren’t as unbelievable or impracti-
cal as you may think. They’re self-contained, low-intensity light kits that you 
can use in a jam or for some creative effect.
»
» Television screen: If the subject is close to a television set and the GoPro is 
close to both, it’s hard to imagine a softer, more interesting light source than 
the TV screen. Just tune the set to a nonbroadcast channel and position the 
subject close to the screen.
»
» Glow sticks: They’re not bright enough for illuminating a scene, but they 
often work in situations in which the subject is light. Not only do they provide 
illumination, but their intense, saturated color makes for a great subject too.
TAMING TUNGSTEN BULBS
If a tungsten light source is too harsh for your GoPro movie, consider the following 
options:
•	 Move it away from the subject. It’s hard to get more basic than simply moving the 
light away.
•	 Reduce its brightness. If the light has a dimmer, turn it down, or use a lower-
wattage lamp.
•	 Soften the light. Put the light in a soft box to get close so you can bathe the subject 
in bright but flattering light.
•	 Reflect the light. You can turn the light around and bounce it into a reflective 
umbrella. If you’re in a jam with the budget or don’t have an umbrella, use a piece of 
diffusion material over the light source instead.
•	 Focus the light. Narrow down how much of the light illuminates the subject.
•	 Use a filter. Use a neutral-density gel filter to cut down a couple of stops of light.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     151
Using Light Effectively
Like many things in life, shooting under the right lighting conditions depends on 
the time of day, your ability to think on your feet, and recognizing the opportu-
nity. It’s important to understand how light behaves so you’re ready to effectively 
capture the subject. Here’s how to use light effectively.
Wait for the right light
The sun flatters subjects early in the morning and early in the evening; in the 
middle of the day, it’s not as effective. It’s best to shoot with your GoPro either in 
the early morning or later afternoon, as shown in Figure 7-10.
Once the sun goes down you have twilight — that narrow span of time between 
sundown and dusk. The sun is below the horizon but still emits some light provid-
ing a “sweet spot” thanks to its rich blue or purple background. But twilight lasts 
only 20 minutes or so, so you have to act fast.
If you have time, wait for the right light. You have only a short window of time to 
make the shot work.
FIGURE 7-10:

­afternoon

152     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Work with the light you have
Color casts aren’t intrinsically bad, and sometimes, they have a place. The nor-
mally unflattering cast of a mercury-vapor lamp can emulate an otherworldly 
experience, for example, just as a street scene lit with sodium-vapor can lend 
warmth to a subject. (I cover both types of lighting in “Outdoor lights [HID],” 
earlier in this chapter.)
When the sun goes down, artificial light dominates the scene. Sometimes it does 
so in an unflattering way, with each light source producing a dominant color of 
illumination. Separately, this artificial light is problematic because it produces a 
single-color cast. But when you combine artificial light sources, they collectively 
show various colors. Put artificial light against a twilight sky, and you have some-
thing unique and often beautiful.
Use colored gels
Gels work wonders when you want to adjust the color of a scene, do something 
creative, or make a statement. You can use a colored gel over a light to spice up 
the background.
Avoid light pollution
Pollution doesn’t apply just to dirty beaches and belching factory pipes; it also 
refers to the interplay among lights in a scene. One light can spill to the cover-
age area of the next, producing hot spots, color variations, and odd shadows. In 
addition, it’s likely to create lens flare (see the nearby sidebar) because the GoPro 
captures such a wide view.
In a perfect world, having the light at your back is the ideal way to use a GoPro, 
but it’s not always possible to do so. That’s why it’s important to strategi-
cally place your camera and monitor the scene before recording to prevent light 
pollution.
Light the scene efficiently
Sometimes, a portion of the light source doesn’t reach the subject, either 
because it strays out of the way due to improper bouncing or isn’t bright enough. 
Make sure that the light is properly directed to the subject and close enough to 
be effective.

CHAPTER 7  Mastering the Light     153
Deal with problematic ambient light
Whether it’s a window leaking bright light or a glaring streetlamp, stray light can 
ruin your shot. Combat it by repositioning the camera or blocking the offending 
light with a card, sheet, or anything else that prevents it from reaching your subject.
LENS-FLARE ALERT
Although it’s common for light from an unintended light source to shine into your lens, 
it’s even more common with the GoPro, due to its wide lens. Lens flare occurs when the 
axis of the lens gets too close to a light source. Sometimes, lens flare acts as an artistic 
device; more often, it makes you look like you’re not observant enough. The figure within 
this ­sidebar shows lens flare from the afternoon light. Here are a few ways to deal with 
lens flare:
•	 Remain alert. Look at the light in the scene from the camera’s perspective, and 
­double-check it in the GoPro App on your smartphone.
•	 Adjust the camera’s position. Because you can’t use a lens hood or matte box with 
a GoPro (its angle of view is too wide), if you can’t move the light, your only option is 
to reposition the camera.
•	 Accept it. Sometimes, you have no choice but to accept lens flare. It might even 
complement your movie. When you’re shooting a street scene at night, for example, 
flare from the lights of passing cars seems natural.

I
f you showed a group of viewers two movie clips — one a high-definition (HD) 
video with slightly distorted audio quality and the other a standard-definition 
(SD) video with clear sound — and asked them which video is better quality, 
chances are that they’d pick the SD version. That’s because the better your movie 
sounds, the more an audience will appreciate it.
Sound completes the sensory experience of a film, so always make sure that your 
movies sound great. That’s easier said than done with the GoPro, though, because 
it doesn’t always capture sound effectively. Maybe you didn’t place it in the right 
location to capture the right sounds, or perhaps the limitations of the built-in 
microphone came back to haunt you. Lots of things can make audio capture on a 
GoPro less than perfect.
Although the GoPro can’t handle every audio situation out of the box, a wide range 
of accessories can help you capture superior sound.
Capturing Sound on the Scene
The GoPro allows you to use the same range of microphones as any other 
­camcorder, though some mikes require an adapter that plugs into the camera 
Chapter 8

156     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
or mixer and captures audio directly on the camera’s memory card. DSLRs and 
some consumer-level camcorders generally use a 3.5mm (mini-plug), not much 
­different from the one on your headphones, whereas more advanced models use 
the XLR input (that’s the bigger one with the prongs).
You can also use an audio recorder, which bypasses the GoPro’s memory card 
and captures sound as a separate file. Later you can match with the video in your 
editing program (see Part 3). If you have a professional-quality microphone that 
uses an XLR connection, you can use an adapter.
All microphones and audio recorders have advantages and drawbacks, as you see 
in the following sections.
Using a microphone
When you think of shooting a GoPro movie, capturing sound with a microphone 
is not the first thing that comes to mind. Most people start with the ­microphone 
that’s built into the camera, but some move on to other microphone types 
when they need to capture sound in a special way. It is especially important with 
scenes that depend on sound for a full sensory experience. Whether it’s a pool 
party or the din of an outdoor scene as shown in Figure 8-1, it’s equally essential 
that the viewer hears the action as much as seeing it.
FIGURE 8-1: 
The sound 
from this 
outdoor casino 
is as important 
as the visual 
aspect.

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     157
Capturing sound with the on-camera  
microphone
Whenever you record video on your GoPro, the camera captures both video and 
audio. That is, sound and picture come together in a single file on your memory card.
Thanks to advanced audio processing on the HERO5, you can capture left and right 
stereo audio channels on your GoPro. it provides better results when conditions 
are perfect: That’s when the subject is near the camera and there’s little, if any, 
ambient noise. Unfortunately, conditions are rarely perfect. (See Figure 8-2.)
On-camera microphones like the GoPro’s have several drawbacks:
»
» They pick up all kinds of ambient sounds near the camera. Everything from 
barking dogs and screaming kids to planes passing overhead is recorded on 
your audio track.
»
» Even when those elements don’t rear their ugly heads, the sound quality of 
the camera’s microphone can lack depth and range, based on its proximity to 
the source.
»
» The GoPro is designed to capture unique visuals, not necessarily to record 
audio. Audio is a secondary feature. When the best source of sound comes 
from the side of your GoPro, there’s not much you can do about it.
On-camera microphones were never intended for serious recording. They were 
added as a cheap way to capture sound to go with video. Use the GoPro’s mike to 
capture sound for reference, and use it when it’s the only game in town.

158     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Adding a microphone
Like just your new iPhone, the HERO  3.5mm mini-plug connector for inter-
nal audio is a thing of the past. But that’s no problem with the Pro 3.5mm Mic 
Adapter. It expands the potential for high-quality audio capture. Compatible with 
a wide range of external 3.5mm microphones, it enables stereo mic and line input 
for external audio sources like an audio recorder or mixer. Microphones come in 
various types and price ranges, one of which may be perfect for your needs and 
budget.
External microphones have their own sets of issues, but they capture better audio 
than the GoPro’s built-in mike. Here are several popular types of microphones:
»
» Shotgun: This long, narrow microphone (see Figure 8-3) picks up audio 
directly where you point it, but not necessarily close to it. Basic models are 
attached to professional camcorders; dedicated versions are used in television 
studios and on boom poles at movie shoots and red-carpet events. Think of 
the shotgun mike as being the audio version of a telephoto lens.
ADAPTING YOUR GOPRO TO ANY 
MICROPHONE
You will notice that your GoPro does not have a connection for either type of microphone. 
No need to worry. You can buy an inexpensive accessory (see Figure 8-1) that plugs into 
the mini USB connection on the camera. You can plug in a mini-plug microphone, as well 
as an adapter to use an XLR connection. GoPro 3.5mm mic adapter, for example, lets you 
attach an external microphone to the camera.

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     159
»
» Stick/Directional: Perhaps the most recognizable microphone on the planet. 
It’s the type that singers use on stage, comedians use in clubs, and television 
news reporters hold in front of interview subjects, held close to the mouth to 
isolate ambient sound. The stick/directional type of microphone covers a wide 
range of microphone types that you hold with your hand in front of the 
subject, or in front of yourself. These mikes are usually tethered to the camera 
by an XLR cable, though some inexpensive models use a 3.5mm connection 
cable. It’s ideal to use when interviewing a subject or singing into the camera.
»
» Lavalier: Also known as a lapel microphone, it’s commonly used during 
television interviews. The tiny device clips to the subject’s clothing near his face 
and is wired either directly to the camera or to a transmitter on the subject. 
When used correctly, this microphone provides great audio and isn’t visually 
obtrusive. When it’s used improperly, the audio is a rustling, muffled mess.
»
» Camera-mounted: Camera-mounted mikes are ideal for picking up natural 
sounds in the scene, such as the whoosh of a babbling brook or the pleasant 
sounds of a horse farm. They also work well for interviewing people when 
they’re close enough to the camera — say, 4 to 7 feet away.
»
» Boom: Basically, it’s a shotgun microphone connected to a pole so you can 
capture sound farther away from the camera.
»
» Wireless: Sometimes, you’re just better off using a wireless microphone. Instead 
of tethering the camera to a cable, connect the microphone to a transmitter and 
a wireless receiver on the camera. A wireless mike allows you to move indepen-
dently of the camera if you’re within range of its receiver, but connecting one to 
your GoPro requires an advanced understanding of setting it up properly and 
staying in range.

160     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Choosing the right mic for the job
Here are some common shooting situations and the right microphone to use in 
each situation:
»
» Interviewing a moving subject: stick microphone. The trick is to get the 
microphone close enough to a subject on the move without knocking out his 
teeth. Make sure that the microphone is no more than 9 inches from the  
subject.
CAPTURING AUDIO FROM  
DISTANT SUBJECTS
If the subject is far from the camera, you can get the microphone closer by mounting it 
to a pole and holding it over the subject. Using a shotgun microphone tethered to the 
GoPro on a handheld rack mount provides a definite improvement over your GoPro’s 
built-in microphone. Just be careful to keep it out of the shot.
GoPro has a very wide view, so if the microphone encroaches on the frame, it’s going to 
appear in the final shot. Another issue is that distant sounds don’t record as cleanly as 
sounds closer to the microphone. The microphone’s narrow band of capture limits some 
added noise, but unwanted sound can still be a problem.
MOUNTING A MIKE ON A GOPRO
Unlike a traditional camcorder, the GoPro doesn’t have an accessory mount that lets you 
attach an accessory microphone to the top of the camera, so you have to get creative. 
Here are some ideas:
•	 Use a rack mount. If you’re going to hold your GoPro while recording sound, con-
sider mounting the camera on a rack (or tray?). It helps to use the tripod mount to do 
it because most racks depend on the tripod socket.
•	 Mount the GoPro on yourself. Use a headband or chest-harness mount for the 
camera, while you hold the microphone near the subject’s face.
•	 Tether the cable. Mount the camera wherever you need it, and tether the micro-
phone cable to the camera or portable audio recorder.

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     161
Be consistent about how far away you hold the mike. If you move closer or 
pull away, you can alter the audio level, which is like raising or lowering the 
volume — only worse. If you’re not sure you can hold a constant position, 
have your sound person hold a boom microphone over the subject.
»
» Capturing natural sound: on-camera microphone. When you’re recording 
natural sound with an on-camera microphone, it’s important to get as close to 
the subject as possible. This can be a challenge when the audio source is at a 
different distance from the subject, so you may have to compromise between 
audio and video (see Figure 8-4).
»
» Shooting stationary talking subjects: lavalier microphone. When you have 
a stationary subject, you can control the audio portion of your recording much 
better than you can in other situations. Because the subject isn’t moving (or at 
least isn’t going to move far), it’s best to use a lavalier microphone to ensure 
that you capture sound at a consistent distance, as shown in Figure 8-5. Due 
to the wide view of the camera, it’s imperative to keep the wires out of the 
scene or go wireless.
»
» Shooting a movie scene: boom microphone. If you’re shooting a feature film, 
you’re most likely capturing the audio on a separate recorder (see the next 
section), so camera-to-subject distance isn’t an issue. The microphone and 
audio recorder can be much closer than the camera. The same can apply for 
your GoPro movie. Just make sure that the sound person holds the boom 
microphone appropriately. That means held from a consistent distance over 
the subject, and out of camera range.

162     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Using a digital audio recorder
Using a separate device to capture audio may seem to be complicated, but it’s 
much simpler than you’d think. Also, it involves minimal risk with a great reward: 
optimal audio.
A digital audio recorder (see Figure  8-6) captures sound independently of the 
GoPro. Add the audio recording to the video in postproduction by matching it 
to the audio track captured by the camera, by using a plug-in for your editing 
­software, or by using a separate sound application.
Here are some pointers for using a digital audio recorder:
»
» Capture sound on the GoPro too. It’s essential to record a reference track 
to match the better-quality audio that the recorder captures. Later, you can 
discard the weaker track when editing in a more advanced program such as 
Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. (To aid in syncing the tracks, use a “scene 
clapper” or clap your hands several times.)
»
» Pick the proper audio format. Digital audio recorders offer a wide range of 
audio format choices, but not all of them are right for movies. Choose a WAV 
or AIFF file. You can capture sound in MP3 format too, but the audio quality 
won’t be very good. (Be sure to consult the documentation of your editing 
software to ensure the media is compatible.)
»
» Record on two or four channels. A digital audio recorder lets you decide 
the number of channels you want to record and the audio format. Select 
four-channel recording if you want more control at various levels; then mix 
the sound down later. (You will need four separate mics and four separate 
cables to four separate inputs.)
FIGURE 8-5:

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     163
»
» Fine-tune your audio levels. Make sure that audio levels are within range 
(that is, not peaking and creating distorted sound) by looking at the meters 
before you start recording. (For more information, see “Maintaining proper 
levels,” later in this chapter.)
Using the Frame
While the HERO5 and Session models already use the Frame (they’re already 
waterproof), previous GoPro models require this accessory. The Frame, shown 
in Figure 8-7, provides a viable alternative to the waterproof case and captures 
cleaner audio because the microphone is directly picking up sound as opposed 
to being covered by the camera’s protective case. Thanks to its open design, this 
FIGURE 8-6:

recorder.

164     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
important accessory allows you to attach the camera to your favorite GoPro mount. 
But that’s not all it can do; other benefits include:
»
» Access to camera ports: You can change media card, offload data, and 
charge the camera without taking it out of the case.
»
» Easily Accessorize: Free of the cumbersome case, you can attach an LCD Touch 
BacPac to monitor the scene as well as the Battery BacPac for longer capture.
»
» Sharper optics: Because there’s not an extra piece of glass, less chance exists 
for lens fog or debris.
KNOWING AUDIO FORMATS
Here’s a brief rundown of audio formats that work with Adobe Premiere Elements:
•	 AIFF: The Audio Interchange Format is an uncompressed audio file type developed 
by Apple. You can select a variety of bit rates. Regardless of which one you choose, it 
works in your timeline to match up with your movies.
•	 MP3: Although it’s an option on audio recorders, it’s not a good one for capturing 
sound for your movie. The MPEG-2 Audio Layer III encodes audio in a lossy format.
•	 WAV: What AIFF is to Apple, the Waveform (WAV) audio file format is to Windows. 
This common uncompressed audio format works on Macintosh and Windows 
­computers and can be used in a variety of bit rates.

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     165
Preventing Audio Problems
In capturing audio, some elements are clearly out of your power. What matters is 
taking care of the ones that you can control. Sometimes, that’s as simple as being 
aware of ambient noise on the scene. At other times, it means using a specific 
microphone technique.
Working around background noise
The most common audio problems involve unwanted background noise. No ­matter 
where you are, something can ruin your audio capture. In urban areas, you may 
pick up honking horns, screeching truck brakes, or emergency-vehicle sirens. 
In the country, the problem may be tree branches rustling, crickets chirping, or 
­animals making various sounds.
The microphone doesn’t discriminate when it comes to sound, so it picks up what 
you want to record and an assortment of unwanted noises that can distract atten-
tion from the primary audio. It’s your job to reduce as much background noise as 
possible.
To reduce background noise, try the following things:
»
» Use your ears. Your ears are made for more than just keeping your sun-
glasses from falling off your face. They’re designed to pick up lots of different 
sounds. Before you press the Shutter/Select button to start recording, listen 
for any potential problems. If everything sounds good, listen for noise 
patterns so you can shoot around traffic or wind gusts.
»
» Stay away from noisy locations. Airports, train stations, and high-traffic 
areas are obvious places to avoid, but chattering crowds and music blaring 
from passing cars also present challenges to recording audio. Whenever 
possible, position the microphone away from noisy locations.
Maintaining proper levels
Maintaining proper audio levels isn’t possible because you can’t see the meters 
on your GoPro, especially because it’s mounted somewhere far away, or maybe 
too close, like your forehead. That’s why it’s important to use a separate audio 
recorder (see “Using a digital audio recorder,” earlier in this chapter) when sound 
quality is high on your list. Watch its meters and use headphones to monitor the 
sound (see “Working with Other Sound Equipment,” later in this chapter).

166     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
Audio should peak no higher than 12 decibels (dB). Otherwise, you’ll get clipping: 
irreversible distortion caused by high audio levels. There’s no sense in capturing 
audio if it’s going to clip. Before rolling, ask actors or interviewees to speak their 
loudest lines to avoid recording distorted audio.
Coping with wind
Using a separate microphone offers clear advantages over using the GoPro’s 
on-camera microphone, but it may not be free of problems. Shooting on location 
puts you at the mercy of forces outside your control. Regardless of what kind of 
equipment you have or what you know about audio, the second you step outside 
a controlled environment, you’re at the mercy of sound-related issues. Howl-
ing wind (or even just a whimpering one) can wreak havoc on a scene. Gusts 
can impede sound or render it unusable. Better-quality microphones reduce some 
wind-related problems, but only some.
The good news is that you can solve many sound-related dilemmas by using the 
proper techniques and accessories. Consider these coping strategies for shooting 
outdoors on a windy day:
»
» Put a windscreen over a stick microphone. A windscreen looks like a little 
hat for your microphone. It cuts down on the whistle of the wind (as well as 
heavy breathing sounds, if your subject is winded).
»
» Put a wind muff on your boom microphone. From a distance, a boom 
microphone with a wind muff looks like a comatose squirrel dangling on a 
pole over the subject. But this woolly accessory can deal with some of the 
worst conditions and reduce noise by nearly 10 dB. The big problem is 
keeping it out of your shot.
»
» Use a blimp. A blimp comes in handy when conditions are tough, such as 
when you’re recording in a howling wind. This accessory is a big hollow tube 
that fits around the microphone and creates a pocket of stillness around it by 
absorbing wind vibrations.
»
» Get creative: In a pinch, shelter your microphone from the wind using 
whatever means you have handy: a cupped hand, shielding with your jacket, 
put a sock on it, or whatever; otherwise, your sound will be wind-blown.

CHAPTER 8  Of Sound Movie and Body     167
Staying close to the subject
If you’re a fan of the classic television sitcom Seinfeld, you may be familiar with 
the episode “The Puffy Shirt,” in which Jerry was asked to wear a puffy shirt by 
a low-talking fashion designer. Because he didn’t hear what the low talker was 
asking him to do, he ended up wearing the shirt during a television appearance. 
He should have gotten closer to hear what she was saying.
The same applies to using a microphone. The closer the microphone is to the sub-
ject, the better the audience can understand his words, and the less likely you are 
to have extraneous noise polluting the audio track.
It’s hard not to have the subject close to you when you’re shooting with GoPro. 
If you’re not using the GoPro’s on-camera microphone as your primary audio 
source, use a shotgun microphone or a wireless model closer to the subject.
You may want to use a pop screen, which is a circular foam accessory stretched 
across a frame that clips in front of a microphone. Besides looking cool, this inex-
pensive attachment reduces plosive noises — the “pop” sounds in words begin-
ning with b, p, or t. If you don’t use a pop screen, the subject’s plosives may be the 
vocal equivalents of fingernails on a chalkboard.
Working with Headphones
It’s always a good idea to use headphones to monitor audio. You can not only hear 
when the sound overmodulates (that’s a fancy way of saying it’s distorted), but 
also listen for unwanted sounds and distortion.
Following are a few common types of headphones:
»
» Earbuds: The headphones you use with iOS devices can work with your 
DSLR. The audio quality is acceptable.
»
» Ear pads: These small, inexpensive, over-the-ear headphones are adequate, 
but they don’t isolate ambient sound.

168     PART 2  Moviemaking Technique
»
» Clip-ons: Clip-on headphones clip directly to your ears. They can come in 
handy, especially when you can use a clip-on that’s clipped on one ear.
»
» Full size: Full-size headphones have large cups that cover your ears. These 
headphones are best for listening to music while relaxing in an easy chair — 
not for monitoring audio.
Noise-canceling headphones aren’t recommended, because you need to pay at-
tention to ambient sound to hear if it may affect audio capture.

Equipping Your Edit 
Station
T
echnology has come so far that “editing suite” often refers to your table 
of choice at your favorite coffee place with your laptop computer. You 
can literally put a movie together with headphones on while sipping your 
latte. You can sip a cappuccino when downloading footage from your camera 
and immediately start editing your movie. All it takes is a machine with enough 
­horsepower — most consumer models have it these days — to run GoPro Studio 
Edit, or your favorite editing app.
Not all computers are created equal; some are clearly a little more robust when 
it comes to efficiently handling all that you throw at them. Often that difference 
comes down to having a faster processor and an abundance of RAM.
Picking a Computer Platform
The rivalry between Macs and PCs used to have the same intensity as debates 
between Yankees and Mets fans or Ohio State and Michigan followers. Although the 
sports rivalries are still intense, the one between Macs and PCs has softened a bit.
Chapter 9

172     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Both operating systems can help you achieve your goals; they just happen to go 
about the process differently. Chances are that the computer you already own can 
meet your video editing needs.
Choosing a Macintosh
Walk out of an Apple Store with a Mac, and you can start editing your movie not 
long after you take it out of the box, because iMovie is loaded on every Mac.
Mac models
Currently, you can choose among these models:
»
» MacBook Pro: This powerful laptop lets you edit anywhere. It comes in two 
screen sizes and a variety of configurations, including Retina Display. It includes 
a SuperDrive for reading and burning media discs. Thunderbolt and USB 
3 inputs allow you to connect to just about anything.
»
» MacBook Air: This lightweight version of the MacBook, the Air sheds some 
weight and thickness by leaving out a conventional hard drive. It has less 
processor speed than a MacBook Pro, but it’s still adequate for video editing, 
especially when it’s connected to a fast external hard drive (Figure 9-1).
»
» MacBook: Somewhere between the Air and Pro models lies the MacBook. 
It uses the latest generation of Intel Core processor. You can also choose a 
variety of colors. A possible drawback with this model is its single USB-C port 
that shares both power and data transfer.
»
» iMac series: This popular all-in-one desktop computer acts as an edit station right 
out of the box. Like the MacBook Pro (see the previous item), it has Thunderbolt 
COMPARING OPERATING SYSTEMS
If you’re on the fence about switching platforms or just want to validate your current 
choice as the right one for moviemaking, consider the operating systems:
•	 Mac OS: The latest incarnation of Mac OS is Sierra, also known as OS 10.11. It offers 
improved performance, Finder enhancements, and iOS compatibility for greater 
communication with the iPhone and iPad.
•	 Windows: Windows 10 is the latest operating system for PC-based computers, pro-
viding advanced media support such as touch screen functionality. A basic edition 
and three other configurations (Windows 8 Pro, Windows 8 Enterprise, and Windows 
RT) are available.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     173
connectors and USB 3 inputs. It comes in two screen sizes — 21.5-inch and 
27-inch, as shown in Figure 9-2 — and comes in a variety of configurations.
»
» Mac Pro: The Big Kahuna of the Macintosh line, this tower computer offers 
enough raw power to edit a feature film with special effects, as well as process 
high-quality CGI animation. It’s not light on the pocket, and the monitor and other 
peripherals are separate purchases, so for anyone who’s just breaking into the 
field, it may be overkill. But it’s a durable workhorse for serious moviemaking.
»
» Mac mini: The Mac mini is the powerful tiny version of the Mac Pro. As with 
the Pro, you add the monitor, keyboard, and mouse of your choice.
Minimum editing requirements for a Mac
For optimum video editing, choose a Mac with these specs or better:
»
» Intel Dual Core processor
»
» Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later
»
» 4GB of RAM
»
» Display resolution of 1280 x 768 pixels
»
» 5,400 rpm internal hard drive; 7200 rpm is preferable
»
» External hard drive with Thunderbolt, USB 3.0, or eSATA connectivity
FIGURE 9-1:

Setting Up Windows
At entry level, Windows PCs are cheaper than Macs, though cost is significantly 
affected by component quality. These days, PCs have enough initial power to edit 
video, but they may not include a fast-enough hard drive or a complete set of 
connection types.
PC models
Numerous manufacturers make PCs — including Dell, Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard 
(HP), and Sony — and each manufacturer makes several lines that use a variety of 
components. Even when you isolate your choice to laptops, you still should con-
sider differing screen sizes, processors, and connectivity arrays.
PC models come in the following types:
»
» Desktop: Better desktop PCs feature fast multicore processors, sound boards, 
multiple hard drives, and high-speed inputs.
»
» Laptop: Some models excel at high-definition (HD) video editing; others fall 
short. Check the specs for running GoPro before committing to a laptop. 
Standout models include the HP Envy and the Dell 7000 series.
»
» All-in-one: All-in-one PCs offer fast processing, HDMI connectivity, and large 
screens. Many models support video editing, including the Dell 7000 Series 
and the HP Touchsmart.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     175
Minimum editing requirements for a PC
For best video editing performance, choose a Windows PC with these specs or 
better:
»
» Intel Core 2 Duo processor
»
» Windows 7
»
» 4GB of RAM
»
» Graphics card that supports OpenGL 1.2 or better
»
» Display resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels
»
» 5,400-rpm internal hard drive; 7200 rpm is preferable
»
» External drive with USB 3.0 or eSATA connectivity
»
» QuickTime 7.6 or later
Understanding Workstation  
Requirements
When it comes to editing video, some computers are clearly better suited than 
others. Here’s what you need for your moviemaking workstation.
Picking a newer computer
Often, older computers are more replaceable than upgradable. An older iMac that 
doesn’t include a Thunderbolt connection, or at least a FireWire 800 connection, 
for example, won’t be usable with a fast external hard disk. Neither will a Win-
dows PC with a slow graphics card or a processor that can’t run the latest operat-
ing system.
Shooting for more-than-minimum speed
Editing HD video is serious business, so your computer’s processor had better be 
up for the challenge. Whether you’re using a new machine or an old one, be sure 
it exceeds the minimum requirements to run your editing software (see “Picking 
Software That Suits Your Needs” later in this chapter).

176     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
A processor has much in common with a drummer in a rock band: Each needs to 
keep up to do the job. When you capture 30 frames per second, the processor must 
play 30 individual frames per second (fps) without missing a beat. Processing a 
continuous video signal is an arduous task, and any hitch or glitch can seriously 
slow the process or even drop frames.
Using a large monitor
If you have a desktop computer, get the biggest screen you can afford. With a lap-
top, you’re a bit limited, but try to get at least a 15-inch screen.
Lots of RAM
Your computer can’t live without random access memory (RAM), and you can 
never have enough of the stuff. It feeds your processor-hungry video editing soft-
ware while updating your Facebook status. The more RAM you have, the better, 
and because HD movie files require a lot of memory, buy as much as you can 
afford. Fortunately, RAM is relatively cheap.
CASHING IN ON THE CACHE
The cache is perhaps the most-overlooked component in high-speed computing. Every 
time you do something on your computer, the processor gathers instructions to honor 
the request. The processor can execute actions faster than memory can, so it uses vari-
ous levels of cache to accomplish tasks. Cache is a funny thing in that you don’t always 
notice when it’s there, but you know when it’s not there.
Here’s how cache helps in editing video:
•	 Level 1 (L1) cache: This type of cache speeds the editing process, but only in short 
bursts. It works harder when the processor needs a little help and then goes back to 
working normally. Like eating a chocolate bar when you’re hungry, using Level 1 
cache is satisfying but not meant to replace the meal.
•	 Level 2 (L2) cache: At this level, a little more memory is available to crunch the data, 
but performance at this level is slightly slower than Level 1 cache.
•	 Level 3 (L3) cache: This level has more memory than Level 1 and Level 2 combined. 
Processing is slower than at those levels but significantly faster than RAM. A proces-
sor with an adequate L3 cache performs significantly faster than a computer with 
more RAM.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     177
Benefits of a faster graphics card
Think of the graphics card as a specialist hired by the processor to reproduce 
the image and redraw the screen 30 times per second. Today, video is recorded 
and played back at 60 fps — and 120 fps and higher rates loom on the horizon. 
Your graphics card has its work cut out for it. Many computers built over the past 
couple of years are more than adequate to run GoPro Studio Edit.
Accessorizing Your Station
Accessorizing your outfits makes good fashion sense, and so does adding acces-
sories to your editing workstation. If you have room on your desk and in your 
budget, add a second monitor and some comfortable peripherals.
KNOW YOUR DRIVES
Not all hard drives are created equal. Here are a few types of drives you’re already using 
or can add to your system:
•	 Internal drives: The internal hard drive is the one that’s already in your desktop or 
laptop computer. A basic one runs at 5,400 rpm, though some inexpensive comput-
ers use drives that run at 4,500 rpm.
•	 External drives: External hard drives are available in various flavors. Benefits 
include compatibility with various computers and faster access speed than internal 
drives can offer. Some external drives are self-powered to accommodate on-the-go 
editing needs.
•	 RAID arrays: A RAID (Random Array of Independent Disks) array is a group of hard 
drives connected to act as a single unit for increased performance and stability.
•	 Solid State: While it saves data like a normal spinning hard drive, unlike a normal 
hard drive, solid state drives have no moving parts, magnetic coating, or spinning 
platters. Instead, the data is stored on interconnected flash memory chips. And they 
don’t need power to retain data. These drives are faster and more stable than a stan-
dard hard drive, but are also more expensive and hold less data.
•	 Fusion: Somewhere between a standard moving hard drive and a solid-state drive 
lies the fusion drive. With this hybrid drive, developed by Apple, the operating 
system keeps the most accessed files on the flash storage side for faster access. 
Less frequently used items reside on the hard drive.

178     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Connecting an extra monitor
Your video footage and your video editing tools reside on the same monitor, so 
it’s a good idea to connect another monitor to separate the editing tools from 
the actual video (see Figure 9-3). Also, adding a high-quality monitor helps with 
video quality control.
The hardest part about connecting a monitor is making sure that you have the 
proper connectors. Even if your computer doesn’t have a dedicated video connec-
tion, you can connect another monitor via USB or Thunderbolt.
Set up the extra monitor as an extension or mirror of your main monitor, per your 
needs:
»
» Extending the monitor adds more real estate by continuing the monitor on 
the other monitor. This arrangement is perfect for adding space to separate 
your editing tools from the video player. Extending gives you more room and 
allows you to multitask without overpopulating your screen.
»
» Mirroring the monitor is exactly what it sounds like. This technique is great 
for working on your main monitor while showing your work to an audience on 
the other monitor.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     179
Adding a monitor to a Mac
To set up an additional monitor on a Mac, make sure you have the right connector, 
and enjoy dual-screen bliss. Here’s how:
1.	 Connect the second monitor to the Mac, using the appropriate 
connector.
Use one of the following:
•	 Thunderbolt cable: Transfers both data and a display signal.
•	 VGA adapter: Lets you connect any standard analog monitor, projector, or 
LCD screen that uses a VGA connector.
•	 DVI adapter: Allows you to connect a monitor that has a DVI connector.
•	 Mini monitor port to VGA adapter: Lets you connect a second monitor to any 
Macintosh with a Thunderbolt port.
2.	 Turn the monitor on.
3.	 Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu.
4.	 Select Monitors in the System Preferences window.
If you don’t see it, select Detect Monitors.
5.	 Adjust the resolution, colors, and refresh rate as desired.
If your Mac is running the Mavericks operating system, simply choose Best for 
Monitor.
6.	 Specify how you want to use the second screen.
The default setting extends the screen between the two monitors. Rearrange 
the orientation of the monitors by dragging one over the other and clicking the 
Arrangement button. If you want both monitors to show the same screen 
image, select the Mirror Monitors check box.
Adding a second monitor to a PC
Using another monitor with your Windows PC is simple. Follow these steps:
1.	 Turn off the computer, if it isn’t already off.
2.	 Connect the second monitor via the DVI or VGA port.
3.	 Turn the computer and the second monitor on.
The Windows operating system looks for both monitors. Don’t be alarmed if 
the new monitor doesn’t turn on.

180     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
4.	 Activate the second monitor.
To do this:
a.	 Right-click any spot on the screen, and choose Screen Resolution from the 
shortcut menu.
b.	 Click the Settings tab of the Properties dialog box, which displays two boxes to 
represent the two monitors.
c.	 Right-click the second monitor, and choose Attached from the shortcut menu.
d.	 Click Apply in the resulting dialog box.
After some churning, the second monitor should come on.
5.	 Specify what you want the monitors to do.
If you want to extend the video across the two monitors, for example, select 
the second monitor and select Extend these Displays.
Adding ergonomic peripherals
Be sure to pick the keyboard and mouse that work for you. Some manufacturers 
make keyboards designed for specific nonlinear editing programs, such as Apple 
Final Cut X and Adobe Premiere CS.
Keyboarding bliss
Maybe it’s not as much fun as snowboarding — especially if you love strapping a 
board to your feet and negotiating a snowy hill — but there’s something incred-
ibly pleasurable about using the right keyboard. Whether you like one that has a 
specific action or helps with your repetitive-stress injury, it’s key (pun intended) 
to select the right one.
Although the keyboard that came with your computer does the job, you may want 
to upgrade to one of the following:
»
» Dedicated editing keyboard: With color-coded keys and written instructions, 
this keyboard familiarizes you with editing shortcuts. Also, it looks cool on 
your desk.
»
» Ergonomic keyboard: An ergonomic keyboard is designed to provide a more 
natural feel when typing and to reduce injury.
»
» Wireless keyboard: A wireless keyboard frees a USB connection on your 
computer and allows you to move the keyboard without tangling cables.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     181
Sometimes a mouse is not a rodent
This popular peripheral got its name because it resembled a mouse with a tail. 
These days, you’d be hard-pressed to find a mouse with a tail: Most modern 
mice are wireless. Some pointing devices aren’t even mice; they’re trackpads or 
trackballs.
For video editing, it’s common to use a shuttle control. As an active part of the 
video editing process, it guides you through the program interface and the time-
line with relative ease.
Picking Software That Suits Your Needs
Many novices think that their unedited video footage stands on its own. It’s 
­possible to understand an unedited clip of some specific action, but that case is 
more the exception than the rule. But more often, raw footage doesn’t satisfy 
anyone but the person who shot it.
For that reason, it’s important to edit your footage with a nonlinear editing 
­program. Which one? You have a lot of programs to choose among, and all of 
them do pretty much the same thing, so you may want to base your decision on 
your needs and budget.
Occasionally, problems arise when you use video editing software on an older com-
puter, depending on how old the computer is and what version of the operating 
system it uses. Check the system requirements of the software you’re considering.
Trying free software
You can download GoPro Studio Edit gratis, but you may already have a pretty 
decent moviemaking program on your Mac or Windows PC.
GoPro Studio Edit
For many of your needs, you may not have to go further than GoPro Studio Edit 
(see Chapter 11 for more information). The software is free to download — and 
more important, it’s designed to work with GoPro cameras.
GoPro Studio Edit is packed with features, including a series of templates that 
allow you to produce GoPro-style videos by just adding your video to appropriate 
places. I discuss this software in more detail in Chapter 10.

182     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
GoPro Studio Edit doesn’t discriminate and works well with both Windows PCs 
and Macs. Computers running Windows XP, Vista, Windows 8 Pro, Windows 8 
Enterprise, and Windows RT can all run the software. So can any Mac running 
OS X 10.6.3 or later.
iMovie
Standard issue on Macintosh computers for more than a decade, iMovie (see 
­Figure  9-4) is a popular choice among amateur video editors. It offers many 
­special effects and fully integrates with Mac programs such as iTunes and iPhoto. 
Although the software is easy to use and loaded with functions and themes, some 
people may find it limited for advanced editing.
Windows Movie Maker
Included on most Windows PCs, this powerful little program lets you make movies 
easily. It’s intuitive to use and includes many fun effects.
Purchasing software
GoPro Studio Edit provides a great starting point for creating your movie, but it’s 
not the only game in town. More elaborate programs are available that go beyond 
GoPro Studio Edit.
FIGURE 9-4:

­interface.

CHAPTER 9  Equipping Your Edit Station     183
Final Cut Pro
Considered by many people to be the de facto standard for nonlinear editing, Final 
Cut Pro appeals to the prosumer market. Robust, powerful, and filled with every 
imaginable function, this video editing program lets you do anything your creative 
heart can dream up. It captures or transfers video files in just about any format 
and exports them with a great deal of flexibility.
On the down side, Final Cut Pro works only on Macs.
Adobe Premiere Pro CC
One of the oldest nonlinear editing programs on the market, Premiere has a 
devoted following. It helps you edit professional-quality movies, and it integrates 
nicely with the Adobe programs After Effects and Photoshop. Native DSLR editing 
presets in the newest version make it ideal for creative GoPro moviemaking. The 
software runs smoothly on both Macs and Windows PCs. Just make sure that your 
workstation has enough RAM and a decent graphics card.
Adobe Premiere Elements
This abridged version of Premiere Pro (see the preceding section) is not only 
affordable, but also powerful. Version 14 includes a wide range of new features. It 
behaves the same way on a Macintosh as it does on a Windows PC.
Sony Vegas Pro Movie Studio
If you’re looking for a PC video editing application that lets you edit pro-quality 
movies, there are worse choices than Vegas. Designed for the professional on the 
go, it includes a healthy selection of effects and 3-D capability to boot. When you 
get the knack of the software, you can use it to crank out quality material. It comes 
in a variety of configurations and ranges in cost from affordable to pricey.
Pinnacle Studio HD
Another name synonymous with video editing, this consumer-level program 
offers a nice set of features. Don’t expect it to have lots of bells and whistles, 
but what it does have ensures that you can make a successful movie. It’s quite 
­complex for an inexpensive program.
Macintosh users need not apply; Pinnacle Studio HD is strictly a Windows program.

Getting to Know 
GoPro Studio Edit
D
epending on when you grew up, the home movies of your childhood (or 
perhaps videos of your child) may have something in common: The camera 
captured too much for the movie to maintain its pizzazz. Sometimes, it 
took too long for the action to happen; at other times, the camera kept recording 
after the interesting stuff was long gone. Or maybe, there just wasn’t a whole lot 
of interesting content. Forget about the reason, though, because the result is the 
same: People are reluctant to watch long and boring movies.
The problem isn’t necessarily shooting too much footage. Often, when you leave 
the camera running, you capture amazing activity. You never want to shoot less — 
maybe more wisely, but never less. As Tarzan might say, “Shooting lot of footage, 
good. Playing all that footage at family party, bad.”
Editing your movie before showing it to anyone is always a good idea. By assem-
bling the best pieces into a shorter, more concise movie, you not only hold your 
audience’s attention, but also can create a narrative that keeps them watching.
Using an intuitive editing program like GoPro Studio Edit provides some power 
to transform your clips into a cohesive, well-edited movie. When you’ve shot the 
footage, it’s time to get to work. Unlike mowing the lawn or cleaning the gutters, 
this task is more creative and thought-provoking.
Chapter 10

186     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
For the section on GoPro Studio Edit, a Macintosh computer was used. Versions for 
both platforms are similar in operation.
Why Use GoPro Studio Edit?
It’s unlikely that anyone ever said, “Hey, I want to spend more money than 
­necessary for some video editing software.” That’s like asking the Internal 
­Revenue Service whether you can pay more taxes than you owe. But that’s often 
what happens when beginners buy software that’s too advanced.
These days, many affordable consumer programs are available, as mentioned 
in Chapter 9, but there’s something nice about a free program. It’s even nicer 
when that program is powerful and intuitive too. That’s what you can expect from 
GoPro Studio Edit, which makes it easy to create professional-quality videos from 
your GoPro content. By providing features that specifically address that type of 
camera, the program lets you add effects and titles to your movie, as well as add 
voiceovers, music, and sound effects.
In addition, it includes a series of templates (influenced by popular GoPro videos) 
that accelerate the process of transforming your clips into an incredible movie.
Although GoPro is up to the task of working as a stand-alone program, you 
can also integrate it with other, more powerful nonlinear editing programs such 
as Apple’s Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere.
Seeing what’s special about the program
Besides being free, GoPro Studio Edit offers the right amount of versatility. Here 
are some advantages of using this program:
»
» Intuitive working environment
»
» Nice selection of special-effects features
»
» Easy integration of clips recorded at different resolutions and frame rates with 
no visual loss of quality
»
» Variety of templates
»
» Capability to export a high-quality master file with up to 4K resolution for 
broadcast or archival purposes
»
» Capability to export projects as H.264 MP4 files at up to 1080p resolution for 
sharing on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     187
Getting the software on your computer
Editing your GoPro footage for free is just a few clicks away when you download 
the software from the GoPro site.
Besides the free version, two paid versions of the software are available: GoPro 
Studio Edit Premium and GoPro Studio Edit Professional.
Before you get the software, make sure that your computer meets the minimum 
requirements mentioned in Chapter 9. If your computer is good to go, you’re ready 
to start downloading. Follow these steps:
1.	 Go to http://gopro.com, click the Products link, and navigate to the 
software page.
2.	 Choose your operating system from the drop-down menu.
3.	 Enter your email address.
4.	 Click the Download button.
5.	 When the .dmg (Mac) or .exe (Windows) file finishes downloading to your 
computer, double-click it to open the installer.
6.	 Double-click the installer icon.
7.	 Follow the installation wizard’s prompts.
Breaking Down the Interface
GoPro Studio Edit 2 offers a new, user-friendly interface with lots of controls and 
features.
Navigating the player window
The player window (see Figure 10-1) provides three panes:
»
» Import & Convert: This pane is where you import your files into the program 
and convert source files to the CineForm format. (I discuss CineForm in 
Chapter 12.)
»
» Edit: In this pane, you put the movie together, doing everything from trimming 
clips to adding effects, titles, and music.
»
» Export: This pane provides the necessary tools to convert your movie to a 
self-playing movie file.

188     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
The window’s function depends on what you’re working with in the program:
»
» Individual clips in the Media Bin: Click a clip in the Media Bin, and it loads it 
in the player. Press the play button to view it. You can trim the clip by setting in 
and out points (see Figure 10-2).

» Individual clip on the Storyboard: More than likely, your Storyboard is 
populated with clips. Double-click a clip to play it. You can also trim a clip.
Deciphering the menus
Navigating the features of GoPro Studio Edit is like driving to a friend’s house a 
few towns away, as opposed to navigating bigger, more complicated programs, 
which is like driving cross-country. You still should know the lay of the land, 
though. In this section, I cover the menus and their commands. The Mac and PC 
versions are similar in operation, although the Mac version has more operations 
under the menus.
File menu
The commands on this menu let you create a project, import content, and save 
the project:
»

Bringing in Media
I’m sure you’re familiar with the fable of rubbing a magic lamp and having a 
genie pop up to grant you three wishes. There’s no genie in GoPro Studio Edit, 
but the first time you try to import content, a tutorial on importing pops up (see 
Figure 10-3).
FIGURE 10-3: 
The Import 
tutorial.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     193
Alternatively, you can choose this tutorial from the Help menu.
With or without a tutorial, it’s easy to import your GoPro footage and any other 
elements you want to add.
Importing media from your GoPro
Downloading image and movie files from your GoPro is easy. Just plug the camera 
into the computer’s USB port. Then you can do the following:
»
» Import files through GoPro Studio Edit. Click the Import New Files button at 
the top of the player window’s Import & Convert pane. An import dialog box 
opens. Select the DCIM folder, and click Open. You can also access the folder 
where the movie resides and choose the files you want, if you don’t feel like 
opening the entire batch.
»
» Pull the files off the camera. Navigate to the DCIM folder and drag the files 
from the camera to the desktop.
»
» Use another app. Mac users can easily open files through iPhoto or iMovie. 
On a PC, you can grab files from Movie Maker or Photo.
Importing other media files
If you want to add footage from other sources to your GoPro movie, you can easily 
import clips from your camcorder or another camera. Just connect that device to 
your computer via the USB port, click the Import New Files button at the top of 
the Import & Convert pane, use the Import New Files dialog box to navigate to the 
media you want to import, and click Open. This process works for audio files, too.
Using GoPro Edit Templates
At one point or another, a co-worker or friend may have pulled you aside to show 
you some cool GoPro video online. Guess what? Now you can make your own. 
GoPro Studio Edit offers templates based on the most popular GoPro videos to 
transform your footage into another exciting GoPro video.
The program comes with four templates (see Figure 10-4):
»
» Dubstep Baby: Slow-motion video and dubstep music can transform your 
baby video into a hip clip.

194     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
»
» Laser Cats: There’s no shortage of cat-video fans on the Internet, so it seems 
like a no-brainer to combine your cat with GoPro video and a cool layout. All 
you need to do is drop in your own cat video, and away you go.
»
» Ocotillo Desert Lines: The action-movie template lets you add your own 
exciting video to produce a nicely constructed segment.
»
» Pool Party with the Niños: Replace this family with your family for an 
impressive movie.
Other templates are available online. To download more templates for free, go to  
http://gopro.com/studio-templates-download?referral=studio_app& 
version.
Just follow these steps to create a video by using a GoPro template:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Load Edit Template.
The Browse Edit Templates dialog box opens.
2.	 Select a template.
The template you choose populates the Storyboard, providing sample video 
clips, music, and titles. Each template lists the title, artist and song, a brief 
description, duration, number of clips used, and tempo.
FIGURE 10-4: 
Pick a 
­template.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     195
3.	 Replace the content of the template with your own.
Just drag the new footage to the target on the clip in the Storyboard. Repeat it 
for other clips you want to include.
4.	 Save and export your movie.
Implementing an Efficient Workflow
Everyone has different needs, but some basic practices will make your time using 
GoPro Studio Edit swift and productive.
Customizing your workspace
GoPro Studio Edit doesn’t offer a lot of preferences or settings, so you can’t cus-
tomize for all your needs. Think of it as being like the computer at the office that 
everyone shares: It works well, but you wouldn’t dare use your vacation pictures 
as a screen saver. Well, it’s the same thing when using GoPro Studio Edit. You 
can’t adjust the size of your bins and windows or create your own keyboard short-
cuts, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use it as an effective tool.
Organizing projects and files
It’s essential to organize your movie content to make the process go as smoothly 
as possible. Here are a few things you can do:
»
» Group your visual assets. Put all the visuals you want to use in your movies 
inside a folder so you can access them easily.
»
» Create a project folder. This folder keeps your GoPro movies in the same 
place. It differs from your visual-assets folder, which acts more like a storage 
area.
»
» Name your folders consistently. Using a coherent naming convention for 
folders will help you find footage six months from now.
»
» Import only what you need. There’s no sense in filling the program with 
excessive footage, especially if you have no intention of using it. Keep things 
lean and mean.

196     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Setting preferences
If having the fewest preferences were a competition, GoPro Studio Edit would be 
a finalist. The Preferences dialog box (see Figure 10-5) offers a limited number of 
options:
»
» Use Time of Day for Timecode: This option takes the time of day from the 
source file and writes it into the time-code track of the converted file.
»
» Use Reel Name in Destination: This option lets you name the clip that you’re 
converting.
»
» Auto-Start Conversions: This option automatically starts converting files 
when they’re added to the Conversion List (see Chapter 11).
»
» AutoSave Is On: When this option is selected, the project is saved automati-
cally at the intervals you set, which range from 30 seconds to 60 minutes.
Delving Deeper into GoPro Studio Edit
Every section of the program windows contains its own controls. In this section, I 
review them to help you master the program.

dialog box.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     197
Navigating the player window’s controls
GoPro Studio Edit is like the Swiss Army knife of video editing programs. It’s a bit 
scaled down when compared to programs like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere, 
but it still provides you enough tools to get the job done, minus the small saw and 
fold-out scissors. The program’s features and functions center around the player 
window, which has three states that show different features depending on what 
you’re doing in the program. Here is a brief description.
Import & Convert pane
The Import & Convert pane (also known as the Import Room; see Figure 10-6) is 
where you import your movie clips, trim the footage, and choose advanced con-
version settings.
Following are brief descriptions of the pane’s controls:
»
» Import: Click this button to bring media into the program. (Alternatively, 
choose File ➪ Import.)
»
» Import Bin: The Import Bin holds the media you’ve imported for the project.
»
» Playback slider: This slider shows the progress of the clip or movie, both in 
the position of playhead and the time code.
»
» Playhead: This diamond-shaped icon shows the progress of the clip playing. 
Drag it to scroll through the clip.

mat, and save your movie in the appropriate folder.
FIGURE 10-7: 
The Edit pane.

200     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Making transitions
GoPro Studio Edit offers only one transition: a dissolve, where one scene slowly 
transforms into another. If you have two clips, you can add a dissolve. There’s no 
menu command for this feature, and it’s rather subtle, so if you blink, you can 
miss it.
To add a transition, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Edit pane to select it and display your Storyboard.
2.	 Click the Add Transition icon between two clips.
This icon is a tiny plus sign (+) resting on the yellow line between the clips (see 
Figure 10-9). The playhead does not have to be on the clip.
3.	 Set the duration of the dissolve.
When you click the + sign, you see a narrow box outlined in yellow that 
stretches across the two clips you set the dissolve.
4.	 Click the Dissolve icon to select it.
5.	 Move the playhead to the desired out point on the playback slider.
6.	 Click the Mark Out button to shorten the duration of the dissolve.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     201
Working with audio
Great audio depends on many factors, some of which take place during the editing 
phase. GoPro Studio Edit offers you a fair amount of control of audio. You can fix 
noise, add a sound effect, or record a voiceover track.
To access the audio controls, select a clip in the Storyboard and then click the 
Audio control on the right side of the Edit pane. The control panel shown in 
­Figure 10-10 opens, giving you access to the following settings:
»
» Level dB: This slider allows you to change the volume level of the clip during 
playback. You can increase the level for clips with lower audio and decrease it 
for clips that are too loud or distorted. If you need to reset the levels, just 
click Level dB.
»
» Fade In: This slider gradually raises audio level from silence.
»
» Fade Out: This slider gradually lowers the audio level to silence.
»
» Completely Disable Audio from Video Clip: Click the Audio Mute button on 
the clip’s thumbnail.
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH FRAMES
For the dissolve to work, you must have enough frames at the end of the first clip as well 
as at the start of the second one; otherwise, there’s nothing to dissolve. If you plan to 
add dissolves, be sure the clip has the necessary frames. Also, the length of the dissolve 
cannot exceed the duration of the shortest clip. So, if your first clip has an extra minute 
of footage that you trimmed in the Storyboard, but the second clip only has ten extra 
frames, then that’s the longest you can make the dissolve.
FIGURE 10-10: 
The Audio 
­control panel.

202     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Using a second video display
You can use a second video monitor with GoPro Studio Edit. If you have one con-
nected to your computer, the program recognizes it. Control this function through 
the Global Settings panel of the Edit pane (see Figure 10-11).
GoPro Studio Edit makes it easy to edit 3D video, especially when it comes to 
including a second monitor. You can still view your normal 2D files, but many of 
the options are for monitoring a 3D movie.
Following are brief descriptions of the options:
»
» None: The default setting means you aren’t using a second monitor.
»
» Left Eye: This option shows the left-eye side of a 3D clip.
When you’re working with 2D clips, always choose the Left Eye option for 
playback on a second monitor. If you don’t have a secondary monitor, choose 
None.
»
» Right Eye: This option shows only the right-eye side of a 3D clip.
»
» Anaglyph: There are several Anaglyph settings:
•	 Red/Cyan shows the left and right eye tinted for viewing with red and cyan 
3D glasses.
•	 Red/Cyan/BW shows the left and right eye in black-and-white and tinted for 
viewing with red/cyan 3D glasses.
•	 Red/Cyan/Optimized shows the left and right eye tinted for optimal viewing 
with red/cyan 3D glasses.
•	 Amber/Blue shows the left and right eye tinted for viewing with amber/blue 
3D glasses.
•	 Amber/Blue/BW shows the left and right eye in black-and-white and tinted 
for viewing with amber/blue 3D glasses.
•	 Green/Magenta shows the left and right eye tinted for viewing with green/
magenta 3D glasses.
•	 Green/Magenta/BW shows the left and right eye in black-and-white and 
tinted for viewing with green/magenta 3D glasses.

CHAPTER 10  Getting to Know GoPro Studio Edit     203
»
» Line Interleaved: This option shows the left and right eye by alternating 
between horizontal lines and is used for certain polarized, passive 3D displays 
and polarized glasses.
»
» Side-by-Side: This option, for 3D monitors, shows side-by-side 3D mode on a 
second monitor.
»
» Over-Under: This option, used on 3D monitors, stacks the left and right eye 
and scales them vertically into one frame.

Editing with GoPro 
Studio Edit
H
ave you ever wondered why your favorite movies ended up being your 
favorites? Maybe you liked the subject matter or an actor, but often it’s 
because the movie was tightly structured and nicely paced.
Regardless of how well a movie is planned and shot, success comes from the edit-
ing process. Whether it’s a studio blockbuster, a quaint indie film, or a student 
project, a well-edited movie compels viewers to escape into the world created 
onscreen. Conversely, a carelessly arranged film evokes negative emotions. Side 
effects may include drowsiness, indifference, and nausea.
Making compelling movies sounds like a monumental task, but it’s entirely pos-
sible to succeed when you adhere to the fundamentals. This chapter covers the 
basics of editing a movie in GoPro Studio Edit.
Creating Your Movie Project
Gathering all the assets for your movie can mean anything from putting the video, 
photos, and music in a folder ahead of time to downloading the day’s shoot into 
GoPro Studio Edit. First, though, you must create and save a new project. Next, 
Chapter 11

206     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
you transfer your footage from the camera to your computer. Then it’s time to 
bring the footage into GoPro Studio Edit.
Starting a new project
To create a new project, follow these steps:
1.	 Launch GoPro Studio Edit.
If you’re using the program for the first time, a tutorial pops up, offering some 
basic information on how to get files into the program. You can follow it if you 
want, but importing is simple, so feel free to click the Skip Tutorial button.
When you start GoPro, you can get right to work because it creates a project 
by default.
2.	 Choose File ➪ New Project.
A new, blank project opens (see Figure 11-1).
3.	 Choose File ➪ Save Project to save the project.
Alternatively, press 
 + S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows).
4.	 Navigate to your desired save folder.
5.	 Type a name for your project in the Filename text box.
6.	 Click the Save button.
The project is saved with the .gcs file extension.
FIGURE 11-1: 
A new project.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     207
Importing video files
After you create and name the project, you can fill it with content. To import a 
video file, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Import New Files button on the left side of the project window 
(refer to Figure 11-1).
2.	 Navigate to the folder that contains the files you want to import.
3.	 Select the desired file, and click Open.
The file loads in the Import Bin.
You can import an entire folder of clips at the same time by navigating to 
where it resides on your computer and dragging the folder from a window to 
the Import Bin.
Importing and converting GoPro media
If you want to edit footage from your GoPro camera, you need to convert it to the 
CineForm codec (a program that compresses and decompresses files) before you 
can edit it into GoPro Studio Edit. That’s because GoPro files are so compressed, 
converting them to CineForm is the only way to get them to play without lagging 
or dropping frame.
To import and convert GoPro footage for use in GoPro Studio Edit, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Click the Import & Convert work area selection button in GoPro Studio 
Edit.
2.	 Click the Import New Files button in the top-left corner of the project 
window (refer to Figure 11-1).
The footage loads in the Import Bin.
3.	 Click the Add Clip to Conversion List button in the bottom-right corner of 
the player window.
4.	 Click the Convert button (Convert All on a PC) in the bottom-right corner 
of the project window.
Conversion takes a few moments, depending on the length of the file and what 
you have under the hood of your computer. When conversion is complete, the 
file appears in the Conversion List pane (see Figure 11-2).

208     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Adjusting fish-eye distortion
Capturing footage with the GoPro’s ultra-wide-lens may have charm, but (as with 
eating chocolate cake or watching television) moderation is important. The ultra-
wide distortion produced by the lens can be interesting (see Figure 11-3), but a 
little less distortion sometimes makes it look better.
Here’s how to make the fish-eye effect less extreme after you import footage into 
GoPro Studio Edit:
1.	 Select the clip in the Conversion List pane (refer to Figure 11-3).
2.	 Click the Advanced Settings button in the bottom-left corner of the 
player window.
3.	 In the Advanced Settings dialog box, select Remove Fisheye.
4.	 Click OK.
After you convert the clip, the image has less distortion (see Figure 11-4).
Viewing file information
When you import files, they appear as thumbnails in the Import Bin on the left 
side of the project window. Each thumbnail also contains some helpful file details 
(see Figure 11-5).
FIGURE 11-2: 
Converted files 
show up in the 
Conversion 
List.

210     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
These details include
»
» Filename: You can change the name when you convert the file, if that’s how 
you set your preferences (see Chapter 10).
»
» Image size: Knowing the resolution comes in handy when you shoot in both 
high definition (HD) and 4K.
»
» Frame rate: The frame rate of the clip is helpful when you have multiple clips 
with different settings.
»
» 2D or 3D: This item is self-explanatory.
»
» Video or Time-Lapse icon: This icon is informative when you shoot the same 
scene both ways.
»
» Duration: It’s always nice to know the running time of a clip.
Viewing clips
You can select files in the Import Bin by clicking them. Press the up- and down-
arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through clips, or drag the playhead on the 
playback slider. You can play a clip by clicking it or by highlighting it and then 
clicking the Play button. Click the Step Forward and Step Backwards buttons to 
step through a clip one frame at a time.
FIGURE 11-5: 
File details can 
be very helpful 
when you’re 
selecting clips 
in a densely 
populated 
Import Bin.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     211
When you’re previewing your files, don’t be surprised if you see choppy video. 
Choppy video is normal because the files are not yet converted to the CineForm 
codec. Depending on camera settings and the computer you’re using to edit the 
movie, the effect will vary. But this is only for viewing; you cannot edit the clip 
until you convert it. You can, however, set in and out points so you only convert 
the parts of the clip you want to use.
Deleting clips
More than likely, you won’t want to use every clip you import. To remove a clip, 
select it and then click the Remove Clip button in the bottom-left corner of the 
Import Bin (refer to Figure 11-1), or select the clip and then press the Delete key 
on your keyboard.
To remove all clips at the same time, click the Clear All button in the bottom-right 
corner of the Import Bin.
Putting the Pieces Together  
in the Edit Pane
Video editing is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle; there are lots of pieces, and it’s 
up to you to make them fit. But movie editing requires far more creativity. If you  
don’t have the right piece, you have to go out and shoot it, come back to the 
­project, and add it in the proper place.
You view, arrange, rearrange, and enhance your clips in the Edit pane of the player 
window. When you first click this pane, you’re given the option to use a blank 
template or an existing GoPro template for your project. For now, begin by using 
a blank template. See Chapter 10 for more about templates.
Setting in and out points
To keep your audience interested in your movie, you need to show them the prime 
parts of each clip, so it’s important to make sure that you remove the excess 
frames by setting in and out points. There’s no sense in trying to convert a five-
minute clip when all you need is 30 seconds of it for your movie.
Setting in and out points is also helpful in reducing the size of the converted 
file, and it eliminates any unwanted portions of the initial recording from being 

212     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
included in the converted file. It’s like trimming the fat from your chicken cutlets, 
but you won’t need to wash your hands when you’re done.
GoPro Studio Edit offers a variety of ways to isolate the desired part of the clip:
»
» Set in and out points with a menu command. You can do this only on a Mac 
(see Chapter 10).
»
» Drag points on the playback slider (see Figure 11-6).
»
» Use the Split Clip tool. It looks like a razor blade and divides the section where 
you place the playhead.
Here’s how to set in and out points:
1.	 Select the clip in the Import Bin.
2.	 Move the playhead on the playback slider to the desired start point of 
the clip, and click the Mark In button to cut everything before that point.
3.	 Move the playhead on the playback slider to the desired endpoint of the 
clip, and click the Mark Out button to cut everything after that point.
4.	 Find other cuts on the same clip.
After you click the Add Clip to Conversion List button, you can grab other 
sections from the original clip by resetting the in and out points and clicking 
the Add Clip to Conversion List button. This adds it to the Conversion List bin. 
FIGURE 11-6:

playback slider.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     213
This comes in handy when you have a long continuous clip with different 
elements you want for your movie.
5.	 Repeat Steps 1–4 to set more in and out points.
Dragging clips to the Storyboard
After importing your clips, setting in and out points, and converting to the Cine-
Form codec, you can drag them from the Import Bin to the Storyboard. The clips 
play in order from left to right, so be sure you drag them to the proper place.
Assembling Clips in the Storyboard
After gathering your clips, and setting the in and out points, it’s time to arrange 
them on the Storyboard. Located below the player window, this is the place where 
you decide the order the clips play, thus combining multiple clips into a single 
video. The Storyboard consists of one video track, two audio tracks, and two title 
tracks (see Figure 11-7).
Populating the Storyboard is as simple as dragging clips from the Media Bin 
(which occupies the same place as the Import Bin when you’re in the Edit pane) 
into the Storyboard. Although you can drag clips around to change their order, 
it’s more efficient to build the movie in sequential order when the clips are in the 
Storyboard. You can always modify the order of clips later.
It’s a good idea to save your work often, especially after making a change or add-
ing some interesting element. The program has an autosave function, adjustable 
to intervals of 2–30 seconds. You can also turn it off, but that means you will need 
to save manually. Choose GoPro Studio ➪ Preferences.

Adding clips
Here’s how to add a clip to the Storyboard:
1.	 Find the desired clip in the Media Bin.
2.	 Drag it to the Storyboard.
As you drag, a green vertical line indicates the spot where the clip will be 
inserted.
3.	 Release the mouse button to drop the clip.
4.	 Repeat Steps 1–3 to add more clips.
5.	 Save the project by choosing File ➪ Save.
Clips use the same thumbnail in the Media Bin and the Storyboard, but clip infor-
mation changes slightly in the Storyboard.
A yellow border around the thumbnail indicates a selected clip (refer to Figure 11-7).  
Other information includes
»
» Filename: The filename is based on how you set preferences, mentioned in 
Chapter 10.
»
» Delete a clip: Poof! It’s gone. By dragging this triangle on the lower left of the 
thumbnail off the top, as seen in Figure 11-8, you remove all applied effects 
such as color, framing, and exposure.
»
» Mute button: Click this button to toggle audio for the selected clip.
Cropping images
The Framing controls, found in the Video Playback settings, allow you to change 
the composition of your clips. This feature comes in handy when you want to iso-
late a portion of the scene or crop a distracting element. Depending on the amount 
of area you crop and the resolution of the source footage, you will lose some detail. 
If you shot the footage in 4K, however, you can crop a good portion of the image 
and still have more than enough resolution when saving the file in HD.
Just select the clip you want to alter on the Storyboard, go to the Video Playback 
settings area, and then click the down arrow next to Framing to display the Fram-
ing controls (see Figure 11-9).

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     215

FIGURE 11-9: 
The Framing 
controls allow 
you to adjust 
and position 
an image to 
your liking.

216     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Here’s what each Framing control does:
»
» Zoom: Use this slider to make the image larger or smaller.
»
» Horizontal: Use this slider to move the image left or right. This feature works 
best with a cropped image so that the frame remains filled. An uncropped 
image shows black at either end.
»
» Vertical: Use this slider to move the image up or down. This feature works 
best with a cropped image so that the frame remains filled. An uncropped 
image shows black at the top or bottom.
»
» Rotation: Use this slider to rotate the clip. A cropped image maintains a full 
frame.
»
» H.Zoom: When you’re mixing 4x3 and 16x9 video sources, use this slider to 
adjust the horizontal scaling of the image. 4x3 looks like the aspect ratio of 
your old television set; 16x9 resembles the current wide screen.
»
» H.Dynamic: Use this slider to adjust the horizontal stretch point of the image. 
This control, which is best used in tandem with the H.Zoom control, helps 
preserve the normal appearance of people who have been stretched by 
4x3-to-16x9 conversion.
»
» Keyframes: These controls allow you to create different frame sizes in the 
same clip so you can zoom, pan, and rotate while the clip is playing.
»
» Flip: Select the Horizontal or Vertical check box to enable horizontal or vertical 
flipping of the image. Select both of these options if you shot your scene 
upside-down and want to correct it.
Splitting clips
Sometimes, you want to split a large clip and insert a new clip between its parts. 
Splitting a clip is as easy as cutting a piece of pie. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Select the clip you want to split.
Move the playhead or the Storyboard time indicator (depending if you’re 
working from the player or Storyboard, respectively) to the location where you 
want to insert the new clip.
2.	 Click the Split button to split the clip.
If you position the playhead on the first frame of a clip, clicking the Split button 
cuts the clip in half.
3.	 Drag a new clip between the two split clips.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     217
Fine-tuning clips
You can fine-tune clips in several ways:
»
» Rearrange clips. To rearrange the order of clips, drag them in the Storyboard. 
A green line appears as you drag a clip, indicating a new location for the clip.
»
» Delete a clip. Select it on the Storyboard and drag it up and get it a poof! The 
little cloud lets you know it disappeared (refer to Figure 11-8). Or just select it 
and press the Delete key.
»
» Trim a clip. When you’re fine-tuning your edit, you may want to shave a few 
seconds off a clip to make the movie smoother. Just reset the in and out 
points (refer to “Setting in and out points” earlier in this chapter), and you’re 
good to go.
Adjusting white balance
The White Balance controls let you alter the color of the scene to either correct or 
enhance the way you remembered the scene. Although GoPro captures color fairly 
accurately, sometimes you need to enhance the scene, and this feature does the 
trick. Just click the little triangle next to the White Balance choice on the right side 
of the window. The feature consists of a couple sliders, an eyedropper, and key-
frame adjustments. Click the movie clip you want to enhance in the Storyboard, 
and make your adjustments.
You can change the color by doing one of the following:
»
» Temperature slider: Move the slider to adjust the color temperature of the 
clip, ranging from cool to warm. You can also adjust temperature using the 
step controls just to the right of the slider.
»
» Tint slider: Move the slider to adjust the tint, ranging from cool to warm. You 
can also adjust tint using the step controls just to the right of the slider.
»
» Eye Dropper: When you use the eyedropper to click on something white (or 
something that’s supposed to be white) in the frame, it adjusts the overall 
color. So, if the area you click on was a little blue, the correction will neutralize 
the blue and warm up the image.
»
» Keyframes: You can change color as the clip plays by setting keyframes at 
various points. Move the playhead to a desired area, and click the + button. 
Change the White Balance, or more appropriately, the color in the image. It 
will play until you set another keyframe and make another change. Every time 
you repeat this, it will change the tone at that point in the clip.

218     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Adjusting tones with the Image feature
You can make tonal adjustments to your movie clip to make it look just right. Just 
click the little triangle next to the Image choice on the right side of the window. 
The feature consists of several sliders and keyframe adjustments. Click the movie 
clip you want to enhance in the Storyboard, and make your adjustments.
Here’s what the controls do:
»
» Exposure: Basically, it allows you to make the movie clip lighter or darker.
»
» Contrast: Adds or decreases image contrast.
»
» Saturation: Enhances color in the image, or can take it away. This is a cool 
effect for stylizing your movie.
»
» Sharpness: Adds, or takes away, sharpness in the image.
»
» Keyframes: You can make the color change to your specifications in a movie 
clip by setting keyframes at various points. Each time you set a keyframe, it 
makes a change to the color (in this case) from that point on (or until you set 
another keyframe). Move the playhead to a desired area, and click the + 
button. Make another tonal adjustment, and it will play until you set another 
keyframe and make another change. Every time you repeat this, it will change 
the tone at that point in the clip.
APPLYING THE “KEN BURNS” EFFECT
You can add motion to an otherwise-static video by using the Ken Burns effect, named 
after the award-winning creator of such films as The Civil War, Baseball, and Jazz. Burns 
mastered the technique of making still photos appear to move onscreen by zooming, 
panning, and rotating them.
Here’s how you can apply this effect:
1.	 Select a clip in the Storyboard.
2.	 Display the Framing controls (refer to Figure 11-9).
3.	 Place the playhead on the part of the clip you want to change.
4.	 Click the + button to add a framing keyframe to the clip.
5.	 Make the desired changes.
Use the Zoom slider to make the clip larger, for example, or you can change any of 
the other settings.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     219
6.	 Repeat Steps 1–5 for all clips you want to change.
7.	 Save the project.
A few tips won’t hurt:
•	 Pace the movement. Never zoom in or out of a scene too quickly or too slowly.
•	 Make sure that the movement has a purpose. Don’t make an image larger hap-
hazardly; do it intentionally. Let the zoom or the pan show viewers what they should 
be looking at.
•	 Pan properly. A pan is a camera movement from left to right. If you pan video that 
you’ve already shot, you get a black area that gets larger as you move, as in the top 
figure below. Instead, crop the image so that you have enough image real estate to 
keep the frame full, as in the bottom figure below.
•	 Crop the image. If you rotate the image, be sure to crop it enough so you don’t show 
the black on the edge or corners.

220     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Working with presets
GoPro Studio Edit lets you stylize your video with a series of preset effects, found 
on the bottom-right side of the window. Using these presets is quick and easy, 
and can help your movie make a statement. All you must do is select a clip on the 
Storyboard and then click an effect. If you don’t like it, click the Reset All button, 
on the bottom right, or click and drag the FX triangle on the clip to make it go 
away.
Using existing presets
You can use the following presets:
»
» None: Restores all default settings.
»
» Protune: Makes a flat clip look punchier by increasing saturation and 
contrast. (For more on Protune, see Chapter 4.)
»
» 1970s: Applies a warm color filter that simulates film shot in the ’70s (see 
Figure 11-10).
»
» 4X3 Center Crop: Zooms in on a clip shot at a 4:3 aspect ratio while cropping 
the top and bottom portions of the image.
»
» 4X3 to Wide: Applies a combination of framing adjustments to transform a 
clip shot in 4:3 aspect ratio to a 16:9 image.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     221
»
» Candy Color: Applies a highly saturated color effect to the clip.
»
» Day for Night: Makes a scene shot during the day look as though it was shot 
at night.
»
» Hot Day: Creates a warm color effect that simulates being close to the sun.
»
» Night Vision: Makes the video look as though it was shot through night-vision 
goggles by applying a green tint (see Figure 11-11).
»
» Sepia: Applies a brownish, unsaturated filter to create a sepia effect (See 
Figure 11-12).
»
» Vignette Large: Blurs the edges of the frame, as in an old photograph.
»
» Vignette Medium: Provides a subtler vignette effect.
»
» Vignette Off: Turns vignette off on the image.
Making your own presets
On the off chance that you’re not crazy about GoPro Studio Edit’s presets (see the 
preceding section), you can make your own. The process is simple. Just follow 
these steps:
1.	 Select a clip in the Storyboard.
2.	 Use the White Balance, Image, and Framing controls to create the look 
you want for the video.
FIGURE 11-11: 
This cool effect 
makes your 
movie look like

Project.

222     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
3.	 Click the little gear icon next to Preset Title to open the Manage Presets 
window.
4.	 Click the + button, type a new preset name, and check the setting you 
want to save.
5.	 Click OK.
Adding slow motion and reverse
Sometimes there’s nothing like slow motion for getting your point across, espe-
cially if you want to emphasize a situation that normally plays out too fast. Maybe 
you performed a jump on a BMX bike and it plays too fast to appreciate. Other 
times, you want to render the clip in reverse to capture a world gone backwards. 
A great example is a clip of someone jumping out of the water and onto the diving 
board. Whatever you choose, GoPro Studio Edit makes it easy to accomplish. Just 
click on the little triangle next to the Video choice on the right side of the window. 
The feature consists of a couple sliders that control speed and fade. There’s also a 
check box for reverse.
Here’s what the controls do:
»
» Speed: Adjusts the duration of the clip from 1 percent to 1,000 percent. That 
allows you to slow down the clip, as well as speed it up.
»
» Fade In: Fades the clip from black. You can choose the duration using the 
slider or text entry box on the right side of the slider.
»
» Fade Out: Fades the clip to black.

timeless look.

CHAPTER 11  Editing with GoPro Studio Edit     223
Managing Audio Matters
GoPro Studio Edit uses Storyboard editing as opposed to a timeline, so editing 
a movie is a matter of assembling trimmed clips to play in order. The program 
offers some flexibility when it comes to audio, adding up to two additional tracks 
for sound effects, background music, or voiceovers.
When you use a GoPro edit template, the soundtrack uses one of the tracks, so 
you’re left with only one.
Because audio plays such a big part in a movie, it’s important to treat it with some 
TLC, fine-tuning the levels of your clips, laying down the right music for the 
soundtrack, and maybe adding a voiceover.
GoPro Studio Edit currently supports the following audio formats: MP3, M4A, 
WAV, and AIFF.
Adding an audio track
Nothing gives your footage a real movie feel like adding a soundtrack, and GoPro 
Studio Edit makes that easy to do. You can also include a voiceover. The only limi-
tation is that you can add only two tracks.
Audio is like video in that you must import it into GoPro Studio Edit. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Click the Add Media button at the top of the Media Bin.
2.	 In the resulting dialog box, browse to your audio file, select it, 
and click Open.
A thumbnail of a microphone on a music staff appears in the bin.
3.	 Drag the file to the Storyboard.
As you drag, a green box indicates the spot where the file will be inserted, 
making it easier for you to line up the audio file with other portions of your 
Storyboard.
Dragging an audio file on top of an existing video clip causes the audio file to 
start at the same time as that video clip.
4.	 Revise the file if necessary.
After placing an audio file, you can rearrange it by dragging it to a new location. 
You can also change its duration by dragging its edges.

224     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Correcting an audio track
Because you capture audio under a variety of circumstances, sometimes audio 
levels are inconsistent. GoPro Studio Edit makes problems easy to fix. The Audio 
Setting features include a few controls for adjusting audio levels and fading sound 
in and out.
»
» Level dB: Allows you to change the volume level of the clip during playback. 
You can increase the level for soft clips and decrease it for loud or dis-
torted clips.
»
» Fade In: Gradually raises the audio level from silence.
»
» Fade Out: Gradually lowers the audio level to silence.
Working with Titles
Great video, clear audio, nice layout, and a rocking soundtrack . . . check, check, 
check, and check. You need just one more thing to make a great movie: a title. 
You can use two tracks for titles, which can be superimposed over clips or appear 
directly above them on the Storyboard. And don’t forget the closing credits to give 
a shout-out to everyone that helped with the movie.
To add a title to your movie, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Add Title button at the top of the Media Bin in the Edit Pane.
A title thumbnail appears in the Media Bin.
2.	 Drag the thumbnail to a title track in the Storyboard.
As you drag, a green box indicates the spot where the title will be inserted, 
which makes it easier for you to line up the title with other portions of your 
Storyboard.
3.	 Double-click the thumbnail.
A dialog box appears on the right side of the project window.
4.	 Type the title.
5.	 Adjust the font, size, and other details.

Presenting Your Movie
W
hether your movie consists of a few clips from the GoPro you mounted 
on a lawn mower, an elaborate edit of your backyard-pool Olympics, or 
a short movie of your dramatic friends, it’s time to kick it out of GoPro 
Studio Edit and get it out into the world.
Will you upload it to a video-sharing website? Send it out as a live stream? Go 
old-school and burn it to a Blu-ray DVD? You have many possibilities to consider.
Maybe you’re not even looking to make an exclusively GoPro movie; instead, you 
want to incorporate some GoPro footage into a bigger movie project. That’s no 
problem, because the process of using the program, and ultimately exporting your 
edit, remains the same.
After that, it’s a matter of showing it to the world.
Converting Your Movie Files for Export
Although GoPro Studio Edit (see Chapter 11) provides some options for exporting 
your movie, it offers limited choices. Although many may work for your needs, 
you can export your movie from GoPro Studio Edit and use a conversion program 
to create a file that meets your specific needs.
Chapter 12

226     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Conversion programs do more than make video files viewable in another file 
­format: They also allow you to customize resolution, quality settings, audio 
­settings, bit rate, and other settings. Convert your uncompressed file to an  
MP4 file, for example, or transform an AVI file to an FLV file for embedding in a 
web page. Whatever you choose to do, the software does the work.
MPEG Streamclip
If you’re looking to convert your movie to another format with lots of options and 
don’t feel like spending a lot of money, check out MPEG Streamclip. It’s power-
ful, it’s free, and it handles multiple formats and sizes. It also is available for both 
Macintosh and Windows.
Because it’s designed exclusively for exporting and encoding files in a variety of for-
mats, MPEG Streamclip gets the job done quickly. It supports the following formats:
AC3 AVI AVR AIFF DAT DV M1A M1V M2P M2T M2V MMV MOD MOV MP2 MP4 
MPA MPEG MPV PS REC TS VID VOB VRO
You can download it at www.squared5.com.
Other conversion programs
If you need a little more horsepower for converting your files, here are a couple of 
reasonably priced programs.
»
» AVS Video Converter (Windows only): This program handles an extensive 
list of video file types (including Blu-ray) and provides a wide array of tools and 
effects. At this writing, a subscription to the software ranges from $39 to $59. 
You can download a trial version at www.avs4you.com.
»
» Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate (Windows and Macintosh): This 
conversion program handles most file types and supports a variety of mobile 
devices, music players, and gaming platforms. The program costs around $50. 
You can download a trial version at www.xilisoft.com.
Getting That Movie Out There
When you’ve put your movie together, applied every possible effect that GoPro 
Studio Edit has to offer, performed any necessary conversions (see the preceding 
section), and saved it, you’re ready to export it.

CHAPTER 12  Presenting Your Movie     227
After you export a movie, you no longer need editing software to play it, because 
the file becomes self-playing. You can watch it on any computer, mobile device, 
and even your big screen television.
Choosing export options
Sometimes, you have a definitive plan for the movie, so it’s simple to pick the 
export settings you need for it. At other times, the process is a little more compli-
cated. You may have used a low-quality setting, only to find out that what looks 
good on a smartphone looks bad on a video-sharing website and atrocious on a 
big-screen television set. To make the right choices about everything from reso-
lution to playback bit rate, you need to have informed opinions.
You have two ways to export and share: You can export your movie, either by 
clicking the tab of the Export work area, or by using the pull-down menu. On a 
Mac, go to Share ➪ Export Movie. You’ll see the choices for sharing, as shown in 
Figure 12-1. On a PC, go to File ➪ Export movie.
GoPro Studio Edit provides many ways to export your files. Following are the pro-
gram’s export options:
»
» Mobile: Sizes your video appropriately for viewing on smartphones and other 
mobile devices.
»
» HD 720p: Exports a high-definition (HD) movie file.
»
» HD 1080p: Exports a full HD movie.
»
» Archive: Exports the file with the CineForm codec.
»
» Vimeo: Exports the file in full HD for sharing on the Vimeo website.
»
» YouTube: Exports the file in resolutions up to full HD for sharing on YouTube.
»
» Custom: Lets you create your own versions of some of the preceding options.

228     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
The following sections take a deeper look at GoPro Studio Edit’s export options to 
help you find the one that’s right for you.
Mobile
This option is the perfect choice for exporting a movie that you want to play 
smoothly on a mobile phone — the kind of thing you want to send via email or 
show as a work in progress. You never want this version of a file to be the only 
export of a movie unless you don’t really care about it. Here are the settings:
»
» Resolution: No matter what resolution you used to shoot the movie, this 
setting changes it to 640x360p (pixels).
»
» Compression: This setting applies the H.264 compression format.
»
» Bit Rate: This setting is 1.5MB per second — a very low rate, so both video 
and audio quality will suffer. But because the file is intended to be viewed only 
on a mobile phone, the quality will suffice.
»
» Exported Frame Rate: The file will have a maximum frame rate of 29.97 
frames per second (fps).
VIDEO SETTINGS DEFINED
Here are some of the video settings you’ll use when exporting video:
•	 Bit rate: By definition it refers to the number of bits displayed over a period of time, 
usually one second. But you will know it as a number that provides the most video 
quality the higher it goes. The problem is that as bit rate climbs, so does the file size, 
hence the reason there are so many for you to choose.
•	 H264: One of the most common video compression formats, it saves the video file in 
a smaller file with very little loss of quality.
•	 CineForm: The native file format for working with GoPro files.
•	 Source Frame Rate: The frames per second the video was captured in.
•	 Exported Frame Rate: Regardless of how many frames per second you captured 
the footage in, GoPro Studio Edit will export most files at 29.97 frames per second, 
but depending on the preset, you can get 59.94 frames per second.
•	 Resolution: It’s the number of pixels that you captured the movie file in. If you cap-
tured in HD, it would have a resolution of 1920x1080. 4K video is double that, while 
NTSC covers 720x480.

CHAPTER 12  Presenting Your Movie     229
HD 720p
This option creates a smaller HD file that provides the perfect compromise between 
quality and file size. Think of it as HD light — something that plays online with 
excellent quality. Here are the settings:
»
» Resolution: No matter what resolution you used to shoot the movie, this 
setting changes it to 1280x720p.
»
» Compression: This setting applies the H.264 compression format.
»
» Bit Rate: This setting varies with the frame rate at which you captured the 
footage. Footage captured at a frame rate higher than 29.97 fps gets a healthy 
bit rate of 15MB per second; anything with a lower frame rate has a bit rate 
of 7MB per second.
»
» Exported Frame Rate: This setting varies based on native resolution but goes 
no higher than 59.94 fps.
HD 1080p
This option is the default for export and provides the greatest quality. It’s perfect 
for playing your movie on a big screen or burning it to DVD. If you want to upload 
your movie to a video-sharing site or send it to a friend to watch on a smartphone, 
however, it’s a bit much. Here are the settings:
»
» Resolution: No matter what resolution you used to shoot the movie, this 
setting changes it to 1920x1080p.
»
» Resolution: No matter what resolution you used to shoot the movie, this 
setting changes it to 1920x1080p. Be careful if your original GoPro capture 
setting is lower; otherwise the result is a net loss of resolution.
»
» Compression: This setting applies the H.264 compression format.
»
» Bit Rate: This setting produces an optimum-quality bit rate of 15MB per 
second, which creates a great experience for the viewer as well as an enor-
mous file. YouTube has a handy “grid” of settings for bit and frame rates at 
https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en.

Archive
This export option retains the program’s original codec by creating a CineForm 
file with a user-selectable quality level. This option is your best choice if you want 
to export a high-quality master file for broadcast or archival purposes. Here are 
the settings:
»
» Resolution: This setting preserves the resolution at which you shot the movie.
»
» Compression: This setting applies the CineForm codec. On a Windows PC, 
you can choose a CineForm AVI or MOV format.
»
» Bit Rate: This setting doesn’t apply a numerical bit rate; it allows you to 
choose Low, Medium, or High.
»
» Exported Frame Rate: This setting applies the native frame rate of each clip.
Vimeo
Choose this option for movies that you want to export to the Vimeo video-sharing 
site. Here are the settings:
»
» Resolution: This setting applies native resolution up to 1080p. Files with 
resolution higher than 1080p are center-cropped and scaled to 1080p.
»
» Compression: This setting applies the H.264 compression format.
»
» Bit Rate: This setting varies with resolution, applying a bit rate of 15MB per 
second to files with resolution of 1080p or higher. For clips with resolution 
below 1080p, the setting applies a lower bit rate of 7MB per second.
»
» Exported Frame Rate: This setting is native to the frame rate of each clip but 
never higher than 29.97 fps.

Custom
If you don’t find the other export settings to be to your liking, you can build your 
own, choosing the format, frame size, frame rate, and quality settings. The Cus-
tom dialog (see Figure 12-2) allows you to customize your movie for export as 
follows:
»
» Resolution: You can select a resolution up to 1920x1080p.
»
» Compression: Choose H.264 or CineForm compression.
»
» Bit Rate: Use a slider to set a bit rate of 1MB to 50MB per second. CineForm 
uses a slider between low and high.
»
» Exported Frame Rate: This setting applies the native frame rate of each clip 
and supports rates of up to 59.94 fps.
Exporting your movie on a Mac
The Export pane of the player window is where you export your movie in the 
desired format and with the desired settings.
Exporting is quite simple. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Share ➪ Export Movie or click the Export pane.
The dialog shown in Figure 12-3 appears.

232     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
2.	 Type a name for your file in the Export As text box.
3.	 Choose a preset from the Presets drop-down menu.
4.	 Click Export.
Within a few moments, a self-playing movie is ready.
Exporting your movie in Windows
Because the Mac and Windows version of GoPro Studio Edit differ somewhat, the 
process is slightly different when exporting your movie.
1.	 Click Export or choose File ➪ Export.
2.	 Type a name for your file in the Export As text box.
3.	 Choose your preset.
On the lower right of the dialog, you find the Presets drop-down menu.

Within a few moments (or many, depending on the file size), a self-playing 
movie is ready.
After you export your movie file, be sure to watch it for quality control. Make sure 
that the file format and size you applied look as good as possible. If you don’t like 
it, trash it and export another copy that meets your approval.

Sharing and Sharing Alike
Sharing movie files in the era of the hit television series Mad Men was very differ-
ent than we do it today. Back then, would-be moviemakers made copies of their 
silent 8mm film reels to send to family, friends, and film competitions. That spirit 
remains alive today, except instead of a physical movie, you’re sending a virtual 
one. It’s also not going to just one person, but many — maybe even millions.
Here are some of the ways you can share your movie:
»
» Upload it to video-sharing sites.
»
» Share it on social media.
»
» Share it on mobile devices.
»
» Send it via email.
Movie files are big, and HD makes them bigger, so it’s important to strike the 
right blend between file size and quality. Ideally, you compressed yours enough to 
upload on the Internet. Although each video-sharing site has different specifica-
tions, it’s possible to upload a HD movie that’s properly encoded.
Sharing your movie on Facebook
The world’s largest social media site, with around 1 billion active users, provides 
a great forum for your video. How many people see your video, of course, depends 
in part on the size of your Friends list and how many of your friends can get other 
people to check out the movie. Facebook allows you to upload a video directly from 
your computer, or you can post a link to YouTube if your video is posted there.
Be sure that you’re using a recent web browser and have Adobe Flash loaded. 
Adobe Flash is necessary for the movie to play. If you don’t have it, chances are 
you will be prompted to download it. If you already have it, then expect to be asked 
to update Flash periodically. Your movie should meet the following requirements:
»
» The video is no larger than 1,024MB.
»
» The video’s length doesn’t exceed 20 minutes.
»
» The video is an MP4 movie file using H.264 compression and the AAC audio 
format.
»
» You made the video yourself or have permission to share it.

234     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
Uploading a video to Facebook is relatively easy. Follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Facebook home page (www.facebook.com).
Make sure you have a Facebook account. If not, create one.
2.	 Click the Add Photos/Video link at the top of the page (see Figure 12-4).
3.	 Click the Add Video pane (see Figure 12-5), click Choose File, and navigate 
to the desired file.
4.	 Add a description of the movie, if you want (see Figure 12-6).
5.	 Click Post, and grab a cup of coffee.
6.	 Share the movie.
Determine who gets to see it. You can share your movie with anyone on 
Facebook who can find it, your friends, or a group of your friends. Or just 
yourself.

Sharing your movie on YouTube
YouTube records more than 4 billion video views per day, so your movie has the 
potential to be viewed by a lot of people — if they know it’s available. If you’re a 
little shy about reaching an audience, you can make your movies private and send 
would-be viewers an invitation to see it. The website supports a variety of file 
formats and allows some videos to be uploaded in full HD.
Here are a couple of YouTube requirements:
»
» Video length can’t exceed 15 minutes unless you verify your account.
»
» You made the video yourself or have permission to share it.
Uploading a video to YouTube is relatively easy. Follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the YouTube home page (www.youtube.com).
2.	 Sign in.
Enter your username and password, or your Google login, as shown in 
Figure 12-7.
FIGURE 12-7: 
When you

3.	 Click Upload at the top of the page.
After the upload screen, search for the video you want to share.
4.	 Select the video you want to upload.
5.	 Add details about the video while it’s uploading.
Depending on file size, uploading can take an hour or more. Use this time to 
name the movie and provide the proper information (see Figure 12-8).
6.	 View your movie.
Also, keep an eye on the page views (see Figure 12-9) to see whether you’ll 
have a viral favorite on your hands.
Sharing your movie on Vimeo
Vimeo (an anagram for movie) is an alternative to YouTube. Because it supports 
higher quality, it’s a popular place for independent filmmakers to upload, share, 
and view movies. Another notable difference from YouTube is that all uploaded 
content must be original and noncommercial.
Vimeo is a much smaller community than YouTube: The site has 35 million regis-
tered users and attracts around 170 million unique visitors per month.
Vimeo provides several levels of access: While free to upload video, users are lim-
ited to 500MB. An inexpensive Vimeo Plus account allows users a greater weekly 
upload amount, as well the capability to limit advertisements before the video,

unlimited HD videos, and unlimited creation of channels, groups, and albums. 
Vimeo PRO provides the highest level of service and offers large storage, third-
party video player support, and advanced analytics.
Uploading a video to Vimeo is simple. Follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Vimeo login page (https://vimeo.com).
2.	 Log in, using your Vimeo or Facebook login details.
3.	 Click the Upload a Video button.
The Upload dialog appears (see Figure 12-10). You can click it to navigate to the 
selected video file, or drag and drop it.
4.	 Select the video you want to upload, and click the Upload Selected Videos 
button.
Depending on file size, uploading can take an hour or more.
5.	 Name the movie and provide the proper description.
6.	 View your work.
You’ll notice the sleeker presentation, as seen in Figure 12-11.

Finding the Best Archiving Solution
There’s a great deal of uncertainty about the best way to save digital media files. 
Technology changes rapidly and is unstable at times. The problem of finding a 
stable solution is further compounded by imperfections in most of the storage 
methods at your disposal. This section presents some of the options.
Choosing a file format
The first step in saving your beloved files is choosing the right file format. Here 
are a few options:
FIGURE 12-10: 
The upload 
dialog.
FIGURE 12-11: 
The Vimeo 
player occupies 
a fair amount 
of screen real 
estate.

CHAPTER 12  Presenting Your Movie     239
»
» MOV: Apple created this file format for use in its QuickTime program. It’s a 
versatile format that allows you to save files in both compressed and uncom-
pressed form. Use it when you want a self-playing file that you can also edit in 
another program without a loss of quality. It’s ideal for broadcast.
»
» MP4: Also created by Apple, this format lets you compress files securely and 
(depending on the level of compression) with little loss in quality. This format 
uses the H.264 codec. These files can play back on iOS devices. This format is 
a perfect blend of quality and size, and can be delivered via email and FTP for 
broadcast playback.
»
» AVI: Microsoft’s AVI (Audio Video Interweave) format saves files with a variety 
of compression formats and in several sizes. It doesn’t retain aspect-ratio 
information, however.
»
» CineForm: CineForm is GoPro’s proprietary codec and the one used when 
you save an archive copy in GoPro Studio Edit. It supports 3D and has been 
used for many feature films.
Archiving on an external hard drive
External hard drives get faster and cheaper all the time, so they continue to be 
viable options for backing up your GoPro movies. With HD files occupying about 
five times the space of standard-definition (SD) files, however, the 2GB drive that 
you thought could never fill begins gasping for air. HD costs more to save, because 
the minutes of video per dollar ratio (breaking down capacity with file size) hasn’t 
quite caught up with hard drive capacity. Of course, after you fill it you can move 
on to the next one.
Also, external hard drives have been known to fail from time to time, and they 
sometimes corrupt data, stop spinning, or burn out. You should always save 
important files on various drives and keep your fingers crossed.
Backing up to tape
You can back your files up to tape if you have a camcorder or HD recording deck 
that uses tape. Professional production houses also back up to tape.
The upside of tape is that your footage can be played back on a television set or 
computer. You can digitize it by playing it into the program while it’s recording.

240     PART 3  Movies Are Made in Postproduction
The downside of tape is that tape is being phased out. Fewer decks for playback will 
be available over time, so finding someone to digitize your tapes may be difficult.
Using media cards
Using media cards to store files, at least temporarily, has some merit. The prices 
of the cards are plunging, their capacity is rising, and their access time is increas-
ing. That means you can play back an HD movie with no glitches.
Here are a few tips on using media cards:
»
» Save as storage. The intention is not necessarily to play video directly from 
the card, just to save the video file. You load the card, drag the files on it, and 
then safely eject.
»
» Use a fast card. If you plan to play video directly from the card, be sure to use 
a fast-enough card. If you’re not sure which speed will work for you, see 
Chapter 3.
»
» Stick with common formats. These days, common formats are Compact 
Flash (CF), Secure Digital (SD), and Memory Stick.
»
» Be ready to transfer. Because technology changes so rapidly, consider 
saving your files on newer media from time to time to ward off the evils of 
dust interfering with transfer or problems with the firmware of the drive or 
reader.
»
» Keep the cards safe. If media cards get wet, dusty, or stepped on, their 
content is lost.
Storing in the Cloud
You no longer have to worry about local media storage when you save in the Cloud. 
Media files are uploaded to large servers in a techno netherland.
Most Cloud sites offer free basic plans and use secure servers. Not all free plans 
are easy to use, however, making it hard to upload or find your files. Also, if your 
files are too big or you need to add space, you’re either out of luck or have to pay 
a subscription fee to upgrade.
Longevity is also a concern. Although some Cloud services are full-fledged online 
businesses, others aren’t as successful. Stay current on site activity, and be pre-
pared to move your files at the first sign that the service is closing.

CHAPTER 12  Presenting Your Movie     241
Following are a couple of credible Cloud services:
»
» Dropbox: This file-hosting service makes it easy to send files from one 
computer and access them on another by using a common folder on the 
Desktop. You drop files or folders into the Dropbox folder and send invita-
tions to people, allowing them to access your material via an email link. 
Dropbox offers 2GB of storage space for free.
»
» Hightail: This reliable FTP service (formerly known as YouSendit) allows you 
to save and share large files. The free version provides 2GB of storage. 
A professional plan that costs $12.00 per month provides unlimited storage.
PROTECTING YOUR INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY
With modern video technology, the good news is you can easily share the movie with 
millions of potential viewers. That’s also the bad news. Because your content can reach 
so many people some of them may use it without permission.
Here are a few ways to protect your video:
•	 Use a watermark. Sometimes a watermark is distracting, but it may deter content 
thieves by confirming that the content is yours.
•	 Add a bug. If you don’t want to watermark your video, add a bug — a large icon in 
one corner of every frame. (You’ve probably seen bugs in programs on many televi-
sion networks, such as ESPN.) Don’t worry that the bug will affect sales or other legiti-
mate use. Serious parties will ask you to send them a “clean” version.
•	 Share cautiously. Don’t upload your video to just any place that will accept it. 
Instead, limit the number of sites to which you send movies, and keep a log of where 
and when you sent movies.
•	 Search the web periodically for your movie. Video pirates may be brazen but not 
always bright. You’d be surprised by how many users grab someone else’s content 
and repost it under the original filename.

T
he GoPro brings out your fun side faster than a New York Jets jersey gets 
your green eyes to pop, if you have green eyes. Anyway, this little wonder 
lets you take a fresh perspective on the world. You can put it anywhere 
your heart desires and get some pretty cool stuff. This petite wonder has changed 
sports and adventure video, because it lets you capture scenes in places where 
cameras weren’t always welcome.
In this chapter, you discover a fresh perspective for creating content, including 
putting the camera in places that were never “camera-friendly,” like in the water 
or up in the air. You can even attach it to your dog, or goat if you want, and see 
the world from his point of view. The sky is the limit when finding fun places for 
your GoPro.
Attach It to Your Bike
Ambitious riders have long been mounting cameras on their handlebars to record 
compelling video sequences. The GoPro can do the job too, with more options 
and from a unique perspective. And don’t worry about taking your hands off the 
Chapter 13

246     PART 4  The Part of Tens
handlebars to start and stop the camera, when you can speak verbal commands 
into the optional Remo voice-activated remote control.
Consider the following possibilities:
»
» Helmet mount: This mount allows you to attach the GoPro on your bicycle 
helmet. Wear the camera as you zip down bike paths or mountain trails, giving 
the viewer a truly authentic rider’s-eye view.
On the downside, the GoPro will capture motion from both the bike and the 
rider.
»
» Pro Handlebar / Seatpost / Pole Mount: This mount lowers the perspective 
and keeps the camera steady while providing the bike’s point of view. You can 
swivel this versatile mount 360-degrees for unique perspectives. So, turn it 
around to get the rider’s point of view, as shown in Figure 13-1. Its quick clip 
makes it easy to attach and remove. And don’t worry about the bar size, as it 
supports different diameters.
»
» Time-Lapse video at night: Point the camera at yourself and ride through  
a well-lit area, such as a busy downtown area at twilight. Keep the footage 
stable with an optional handheld gimbal or mounting on your Seeker 
backpack for super smooth footage.

Take GoPro in the Snow
The GoPro enables a new generation of family documentarians, extreme-sports 
aficionados, and ambitious filmmakers to cover winter sports and activities with 
relative ease and little worry about the equipment.
Here are some of the cool ways you can use your GoPro in the cold:
»
» Ice skating: Mount the camera to yourself, using one of the body mounts 
(headband, helmet, Chesty, and so on), and get a fresh view of a day 
at the rink.
»
» Sledding: Attach the GoPro to yourself or your sled to capture the sensation 
of flying down a snowy hill.
»
» Snowboarding: You wear your GoPro with the helmet mount or on your 
back with the Seeker backpack. It provides three mounting options while 
carrying your stuff at the same time.
»
» Skiing: Mount the camera on yourself or use the 3-way pole to produce your 
own exciting ski video. Other options include mounting your GoPro on the 
Seeker backpack or attaching it on your ski pole with the Pro Handlebar / 
Seatpost / Pole Mount.
»
» Snow tubing: The helmet or headband mounts work great for this purpose, 
letting you capture the rush of going down the mountain. Shoot the scenery, 
or turn the camera around to record your buddy’s expression.
»
» Put it on a RVC: Some radio-controlled vehicles are powerful enough to 
trudge through the snow. For Figure 13-2, one of the adhesive mounts 
was attached to the vehicle, then the camera was slid into the mount. For 
stabilized footage, use the Karma Grip gimbal to create amazing footage.
»
» Snowman time-lapse: Mount the GoPro nearby and get to work on Frosty. 
You can mount the camera to a tree or use the tripod mount. Later, over hot 
chocolate, watch your hour-long effort in 45 seconds. You can also mount the 
GoPro on a warm day to capture the hours-long melting process in less than a 
minute. Use a portable power pack for longer durations.

248     PART 4  The Part of Tens
Explore Underwater
Maybe you’re not an accomplished oceanographer, but you still desire to be the 
Jacques Cousteau of your local swimming hole. If so, the GoPro is ready, willing, 
and able to capture your views of the underwater world.
Here are some cool ways to take underwater photos and videos:
»
» Swim with it. Take the GoPro underwater, and mount it to your body with the 
Chesty body harness or hold it as you navigate the deep. You can use it while 
snorkeling, scuba diving, or simply taking a dip in a pool (see Figure 13-3).
»
» Use an extension pole underwater. By attaching the camera to a pole like 
3-way or the Handler and submerging it, you can get great underwater 
footage at a beach, pool, or lake.
»
» Mount it underwater. Use an existing mount, or jerry-rig your own; then put 
it in a pool or a shallow lake.
Just be careful that the GoPro doesn’t get swept away and become a hazard to 
others. That’s why it’s a good idea to use the Floaty Backdoor so the camera 
can float if it breaks free.
»
» Shoot at the surface. Catch a rider on a boogie board, your mom on her raft, 
or the players in a water-polo match. Attach GoPro to your arm or hand with 
the Strap to capture with ease.
FIGURE 13-2: 
This snow 
scene was 
captured at 
ground level.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Fun Ways to Use Your GoPro     249
»
» Monitor it with your smartphone. Because most GoPro cameras don’t 
include a viewfinder, and you don’t want to get your smartphone wet, you can 
monitor the footage from the sidelines (in other words, away from the water).
Make the Coolest Selfie
The selfie is quickly becoming one of the most prominent ways to take a portrait. 
Thanks to the wide-angle view of your GoPro, the camera lets you create some 
interesting moving or still selfies.
Here are a few pointers for getting the best results:
»
» Make the shot flattering. More appropriately, keep it from becoming 
unflattering. The GoPro’s wide-angle lens can distort your appearance, and 
holding it too low and close to your face can make your nose look like a 
weapon. Instead, hold it at just above eye level, perpendicular to the ground.
»
» Know yourself. What’s your good side? If you know it, make sure that you 
shoot it.
»
» Make sure that the light works. Opt for soft directional light, as shown in 
Figure 13-4. Also, make sure that the background is not busy or too bright.
FIGURE 13-3:

250     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Mount the camera on an extension pole. You can make a fun shot by 
extending the camera at an angle above you or your group with the GoPro 
3-way or the Handler.
»
» Shoot on Burst. Press the shutter once and get a bunch of shots. This works 
especially well with group selfies and can improve the chances that everyone 
has a flattering expression.
»
» Use your smartphone as a monitor. Here’s something a little different: Hold 
the GoPro and keep your smartphone in view so that you have some idea 
how the shot will turn out.
Walk through a Crowded Space
Capturing video of walking through a crowd isn’t easy with a conventional cam-
era. GoPro changes that situation, thanks to its small dimensions and wide view. 
You have lots of ways to move through a crowd with a GoPro attached to a head-
band or chest mount.
Here’s how to use these mounts effectively:
»
» Head Strap plus Clip: The GoPro is almost small enough that you can walk 
through a crowd with it unnoticed.
FIGURE 13-4: 
A GoPro selfie 
taken on a red 
carpet.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Fun Ways to Use Your GoPro     251
Try mounting the camera on your headband and looking behind you. This 
technique can provide some funny, compelling footage, especially when 
people get too close to you. You can monitor the scene by watching it on your 
smartphone.
»
» Chesty (chest harness): Also known as the Chesty, this mount holds your 
GoPro at chest height, providing a slightly different perspective. (See 
Figure 13-5.)
»
» Wristband or Strap: Both mounts let you grab shots to the side and shoot 
from the hip by holding the camera low and directly in your path. This 
technique helps you create some unique GoPro imagery.
Take It Out on an ATV
If offroading is your thing, the GoPro can help you capture some great footage 
from your All Terrain Vehicle. Don’t worry about the mud, sweat, and tears; the 
camera thrives under these conditions and handles them all with dignity.
Check out the following options for using your GoPro on an all-terrain  
vehicle (ATV):
»
» Mount it on a roll bar. GoPro makes a mount specifically for this point of 
view, the Large Tube mount. Mount to handlebar with the Pro Handlebar / 
Seatpost / Pole mount or use the 360-degree swivel QR base to rotate the 
camera for new perspectives.
FIGURE 13-5:

252     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Put it on the bumper. This vantage point provides a rugged almost-ground- 
level view of the terrain, allowing the viewer to experience the excitement. 
You can also mount the Karma Grip gimbal to your vehicle for super smooth 
footage. See copy deck.
»
» Place it on a road course. If you’re traveling a specific road course, put a 
GoPro at a strategic location to get a unique perspective. (Just be careful that 
you don’t run over it.) Use a tripod or mount to a tree with Large Tube mount.
»
» Use multiple cameras. Mount a camera inside the vehicle to show the driver; 
then mount other cameras on the roll bar, bumper, and even on the course to 
capture multiple points of view. Control them all at the same time with Smart 
remote.
Wipe the lens after each take. There’s nothing worse than having a great capture 
and finding goop on the lens.
Shoot the View from the Sky
If you like flying remote-control planes as much as you like making cool  
videos, you’ll love flying your GoPro on a quadcopter. See section about the 
Karma drone.
Here are a few cool ways to capture airborne video:
»
» Fly it near fireworks. If you fly the quadcopter in safe areas (not over a large 
crowd or near a helicopter, for example), you can take an exciting new 
approach to filming a firework display.
»
» Get an overhead shot of the beach. Flying the GoPro over a beach can 
create interesting views of the sun and surf.
»
» Capture your town from above. It’s cool to look at a place you know well 
from an uncommon view. Capture everything from Main Street to your street 
for a fun and exciting video.
Abide by the rules. Always keep your quadcopter in your sight. Never fly it around 
another airborne vehicle or near an airport. And respect other people’s privacy.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Fun Ways to Use Your GoPro     253
Get a Dog’s-Eye View
If you have a big-enough dog (20–120 lbs.), you can mount the camera on him 
to get the canine version of a bird’s-eye view (see Figure 13-6). You have a few 
ways to mount the camera, with the best using the GoPro Fetch mount, which is 
designed specifically for your four-legged pal. Of course, fitting a small chest har-
ness to the dog seems to work well too. It may take a few adjustments to get the 
harness to fit snugly (and for the dog to get used to it, but that’s nothing a few 
treats can’t fix).
When the camera is mounted and on, just let your dog do his thing. The camera is 
lightweight, and if you mount it properly, it shouldn’t cause the dog any discom-
fort. Also, mount your GoPro to a toy or stick with the handlebar mount for a new 
perspective of your dog playing or performing tricks.
Try to shoot at a frame rate of 60 frames per second (fps) to compensate for the 
constant motion. Control the camera with Remo or Smart remote seeing as though 
you can’t press the shutter on a moving dog.
Here are some ideas:
»
» Get a dog’s view of the dog park. Watching your dog interact with his canine 
buddies puts you right in the middle of the action.
»
» Play fetch. The time-honored game takes on new, exciting meaning when 
you see exactly what the dog sees.

» Take your dog for a swim. If your dog likes the water, the GoPro is ready for 
the challenge, providing some interesting footage.
When you’re done with the shoot, have a treat ready!
Make a Time-Lapse Movie
It’s cool to shoot a bunch of still images to create a time-lapse movie. GoPro 
makes the process easy, with a special mode dedicated to time-lapse capture. You 
can speed up the world at the interval of your choosing for fun, or study changing 
scene over time. Shoot a sequence that shows a parade of commuters walking into 
the subway or fans filling a stadium, or record an expedited version of your child’s 
Little League game. (Sometimes it’s wishful thinking for a game to be that short.)
To make a time-lapse video, you need the following:
»
» Proper settings: Make sure that your GoPro is turned to Time-Lapse mode 
and set to the desired interval.
»
» Sturdy mount: Whichever mount you choose, make sure that it’s sturdy and 
located away from excessive vibration.
»
» Freshly charged battery: The GoPro’s battery doesn’t last long, so when 
you’re running the camera for an hour or so, you’re at risk of a battery failure. 
Also, consider using the Portable Power Pack to charge your GoPro during an 
extended time-lapse.
»
» Something to help pass the time: Although time-lapse recording produces 
an exciting effect, creating that recording isn’t too exciting. Depending on how 
long you plan to capture frames, bring along a book and maybe a chair. Come 
to think of it, bring a beverage and a snack, too.
Capture Your Own Band from the Stage
The GoPro provides an all-access pass to the center of any stage performance. 
Give the audience a perspective that only the band gets to see by using the remov-
able instrument mount to capture footage right onstage.

CHAPTER 13  Ten Fun Ways to Use Your GoPro     255
Here are some of the places that a GoPro can go during a performance:
»
» Guitar: Mount the camera on the headstock with the Arm, and position it to 
show the guitarist’s fingers working the frets (see Figure 13-7). Put it on the 
guitar’s body with a gooseneck mount to show the player picking. Turn the 
GoPro around to capture the rest of the band with your “guitar cam.”
»
» Drums: If the drummer has enough space to drum, you can put the remov-
able instrument mount anyplace. Use the gooseneck or jaws mount, depend-
ing on what you’re trying to show.
»
» Keyboards: Put the camera above the keys to show a close-up and nicely 
distorted view of the keyboard player’s hands.
»
» Microphone stand: Put the audience right in the middle of the action with a 
view from the microphone.

Ten Professional Uses 
for GoPro Cameras
D
o you make money shooting photos or video? By definition, you’re a pro, 
no matter what your day job is. If you want to gain an edge, adding GoPro 
to your repertoire can help. Whether you shoot weddings, cover news 
­stories, or create multimedia real estate listings, the GoPro can elevate the quality 
of the final product.
The camera is already gaining exposure on the pro circuit. Several reality televi-
sion shows already incorporate GoPro cameras, including the CBS series Survivor.
This chapter presents ten professional uses for GoPro cameras.
Professional Photography
The GoPro has found its way into many professional photographers’ camera 
bags. It’s fun to use when you’re already comfortable with holding a camera, and 
that near-fish-eye view (I won’t bicker over 10 degrees) lets you do some pretty 
­creative stuff with still images and video.
Chapter 14

258     PART 4  The Part of Tens
If you’re not already using a GoPro in your photography business, here are a few 
ways you can take advantage of it:
»
» Take ultra-wide-angle pictures. The GoPro allows you to get close to your 
subject to create a pleasantly distorted sense of perspective (see Figure 14-1).
»
» Capture time-lapse footage. Shoot a bunch of still images and play them as 
a movie, using the time-lapse setting on your GoPro and putting everything 
together in GoPro Studio Edit (see Chapter 12).
»
» Capture video of yourself taking photographs. This technique comes in 
especially handy for in-depth photo essays or commercial shoots.
»
» Mount the camera remotely. Sometimes it’s easier to take the time to 
mount the camera on a pole or overhead railing than to climb and wait for the 
shot. After you mount it, you can watch what it’s seeing using your smart-
phone or device.
»
» Put the GoPro in harm’s way. Some situations make great photographs,  
but it’s too dangerous to capture them directly. Maybe you’re covering the 
running of the bulls at Pamplona or wanting to capture traffic on an interstate 
highway. Mounting the camera, getting away to a safe distance, and control-
ling the camera remotely prevents you from getting run over.

Documentary Filmmaking
You probably don’t want to shoot the entire documentary with a GoPro. Instead, 
use it as a secondary camera, blending its footage with conventional footage. That 
way, you give yourself some cool choices for editing. These include:
»
» Tight spaces: So many times, it’s not possible to get a wide enough view with 
your camcorder, so don’t stress about it anymore; just mount a GoPro or two 
in the room for those situations.
»
» Capture action: That’s what the camera is designed for, and that’s how you 
should use it when shooting scenes for your documentary.
»
» Point-of-view (POV): A common practice with documentaries is to make the 
viewers feel like they’re part of the scene, as seen in Figure 14-2. It’s hard to 
think of any better way than mounting a GoPro on a headband or harness 
and walking through a castle, stepping in a battlefield, or maneuvering 
through a cave.
Wedding Videography
Depending on how ambitious the bride and groom want their nuptials video to 
be, the GoPro provides endless possibilities. Thanks to its portability, the camera 
stays out of the way to capture more natural activity. Most likely, you won’t shoot 
the entire event with GoPro, but you can capture enough cool scenes to make 
things interesting.

Here are a few cool ideas:
»
» Limo ride: Mount one or more cameras in the car to document the transpor-
tation experience.
»
» Dancing close-up: Mount the GoPro on a pole or on your head, and get in 
close on the dance-floor action.
»
» Table views: Attach the GoPro to an extension pole, hold it above each table, 
and ask the guests to salute the bride and groom.
»
» Low-angle portrait: One cool trick is to lie on the ground with the camera 
facing upward, surrounded by the bridal party standing in a circular embrace. 
This technique works well for both still photos and videos.
Real Estate Sales
Although it may not sound as exciting as capturing a surfer in a pipeline, there are 
many good reasons to use a GoPro to capture real estate interiors and exteriors, 
giving prospective buyers some informative images to consider.
Most pictures on real estate websites are ineffective images that don’t represent 
the property accurately. Sometimes, they show too little of the property because 
they weren’t shot with a wide-enough lens. Even with a moderately wide-angle 
lens, you can back up only so far before hitting a wall. The GoPro’s lens is so wide 
that you may have the opposite problem, but it’s certainly one you can work with.
Here are some ways to use the GoPro effectively in real estate:
»
» Capture the entire room. The camera’s ultra-wide-angle lens lets you 
capture a whole room from some tight spots (see Figure 14-3).
»
» Do a walk-through. When a prospective customer can’t visit the property 
right away or just wants to vet it first, watching a video walk-through can be 
the next-best thing. Mounting the camera on a headband produces a 
perspective conducive to what your eyes see when walking through a 
crowded space.
»
» Go aerial. Mount a GoPro on a remote-control quadcopter, and fly it over the 
house to give the viewer a bird’s-eye perspective of the property.

Multimedia Reporting
Peek into any multimedia reporter’s bag, and you’re likely to find a variety of 
tools: a laptop computer, a smartphone loaded with apps, some sort of camcorder, 
and perhaps a GoPro camera.
Here are a few ways to use the GoPro on a reporting beat:
»
» Record interviews. You can capture the audio portion for radio highlights 
and capture video to accompany the story online.
»
» Capture raw footage. It’s best to capture a scene now and worry later about 
how you’ll use it. Taking raw footage is better than not shooting at all and 
wishing that you had.
Television News Production
The two roles may seem to be similar, but there’s a dramatic difference between 
the functions of a multimedia reporter and a television producer. The latter relies 
solely on gathering visual images; the former uses various media to tell the story.

262     PART 4  The Part of Tens
Most news crews use big cameras, but the portable GoPro provides a unique per-
spective. Even news cameras with expensive wide-angle lenses can’t capture as 
wide a scene as a GoPro can. Also, you can mount a GoPro on a pole above the 
scene, which you can’t do with a news camera; it’s way too heavy (and expensive 
to replace if the pole breaks).
When you’re covering television news, here are some ways that the GoPro can 
work for you:
»
» Get a wide view of a news scene. Parades, processions, red carpets, and 
other expansive events are easy to capture when you mount a GoPro nearby 
(see Figure 14-4).
»
» Film in tight spaces. Sometimes, you need to capture news footage from a 
cramped space. Use a GoPro to fill the frame with all you need.
»
» Create unique visual hooks. The ultra-wide-angle lens creates footage that 
integrates nicely with conventional footage for both practical reasons (getting 
more into the scene) and aesthetic ones (getting a fish-eye view).

CHAPTER 14  Ten Professional Uses for GoPro Cameras     263
Independent Filmmaking
Anyone who ever made a film understands the extended time and high cost of 
shooting. The GoPro makes a positive difference. Because the camera is so cheap, 
you can put several of them all over a scene and not have to worry about making 
alternative takes.
You need to use the GoPro sparingly in filmmaking, however, due to its super-
wide view. An actor who requests a close-up will think twice about asking for it 
again when the GoPro makes him look like a bobble head doll.
Home Security
While not its main job, GoPro is perfect for keeping an eye on things. Sure, there 
are less expensive ways to observe a scene, but GoPro can come through in a 
pinch. Though it’s small, it’s not as small as a nannycam, you know, the ones 
hidden in a stuffed teddy bear. Although not as cute as those peeking bears, GoPro 
blows away the competition with its superior quality image. Because it’s already 
designed for mounting, there’s not the dilemma of “how am I gonna mount my 
camcorder outside my front door?” With GoPro, you can easily put in anywhere 
and start observing.
On the downside, the battery doesn’t last that long and you have to control it from 
a nearby smartphone or remote. But it can still work.
Here are some ideas:
»
» Mount it on a pole: Observe the scene using your smartphone or device. You 
can control when to record and when to stop.
»
» Put it in the baby’s room: If you don’t have a video monitor, the GoPro 
provides a great solution.
»
» Monitor an entrance or exit: Whether you’re watching the door and want to 
see who’s coming and going, or just need to keep an eye on things. GoPro lets 
you temporarily place a camera anywhere to observe activity. Plus, it’s small 
enough to fit in cramped spaces.

Traditional Sports Shooters
The GoPro works well for recording sports, whether they’re high-school games or 
local sports events. Regardless of what you plan to use the camera for, capturing 
great action footage with it is easy.
Thanks to the camera’s durability, coaches in many sports use it to record footage 
for future reference. Some Little League coaches, for example, use the GoPro as a 
teaching tool to help young players perfect their mechanics.
Here are a few ideas for recording a few popular sports:
»
» Baseball: Mount a GoPro on a catcher’s mask to get a clear view of a pitch 
after release. Place a camera in the batting cage to capture footage for later 
evaluation by players and coaches. Wear a camera on a hat to capture a 
fielder’s perspective.
»
» Basketball: Try mounting a GoPro (or two) on a glass backboard. You can 
shoot the full-court game on a conventional camcorder and edit in the 
backboard shots later, as appropriate.
»
» Swimming: Mount one or more GoPros in the pool to add an exciting aspect 
to swim-meet coverage. You can combine this footage with footage captured 
above the water on another camera.
»
» Skiing: Capture what a skier sees by putting a GoPro on a ski pole, using a 
pole mount. Or put the camera on a headband or helmet mount.
Extreme Sports Shooters
Extreme sports make for exciting video. Following are some extreme sports that 
go well with the GoPro:
»
» Surfing: Photographers and filmmakers have mounted cameras on surf-
boards for years, but it did require an expensive waterproof housing and was 
a bit cumbersome on the board. GoPro is small and out of the way.
»
» Skateboarding: Use the skateboard mount to get a low-angle view (see 
Figure 14-5), or mount the camera on a skater’s helmet to produce heart- 
skipping skateboarding video.

CHAPTER 14  Ten Professional Uses for GoPro Cameras     265
»
» Skydiving: Mount the camera on a diver’s helmet to capture the free fall and 
the parachute opening.
Because of the speeds involved in skydiving, it’s a good idea to use a high 
frame rate — 60 frames per second (fps) or more.

Ten Pitfalls to Avoid
L
ong before they invented cheese in a spray can, situations that were once 
too dangerous to talk about shooting are now part of the conversation with 
GoPro. It’s amazing how such a small camera has made it possible for you 
to reveal moments and perspectives that were unheard of a few short years ago. 
And much like the technology that led to putting cheese in a spray can, it doesn’t 
always mean it’s safe, easy, or without problems all the time. Steering clear of the 
pitfalls is a small price to pay for a camera that goes anywhere and releases the 
boundaries of what was near impossible a decade ago. Let’s look at ten potential 
issues in no particular order you should avoid.
Not Using the GoPro App
Squinting over your GoPro and poking around the controls every time you want to 
make a change is a buzz killer. Thanks to its diminutive size and lack of viewfinder 
(for the most part) using GoPro is not always incredibly intuitive. Add another 
level of difficulty if you have less than perfect eyesight. It’s far beneficial using 
the GoPro App on your smartphone for controlling the camera and making proper 
adjustments than reading the tiny nested menus on the camera. Add the fact that 
you can preview the scene and it’s a no-brainer.
Chapter 15

268     PART 4  The Part of Tens
Let’s recap why you need to use the GoPro App:
»
» Control over the camera: Provides immediate and clear access to camera 
functions with no squinting or pressing the wrong command.
»
» Live Preview: Even if you’re using a LCD touch screen, you need to be near 
the camera to see what’s going on, and that’s not always practical. Instead, 
watch the scene form your smartphone and see what the camera sees so you 
can frame each shot with confidence, as seen in Figure 15-1.
»
» Other benefits: Besides controlling the camera remotely, the app also lets 
you view photos and play back movies after you shoot them. You have access 
to everything shown on your camera’s SD card and can manage your files 
right after you shoot them, avoiding the wait to get back home.
Pausing When You Didn’t Mean It
Immediately after the invention of the record button came the inadvertent action 
of pressing the button at the wrong time either to pause or record when you meant 
to do the other. You can reduce the odds of that happening.
Here’s what you can do:
»
» Hands off: It’s a good idea to keep your grubby paws away from the record 
button, or holding the camera for that matter. Holding while recording 
increases the risk of inadvertently hitting the button.

CHAPTER 15  Ten Pitfalls to Avoid     269
»
» Observe the record light: Some people turn it off, but it’s a good idea to 
leave it on so you have a visual reference.
»
» Watch the counter: Make it a habit to notice the activity of the counter 
whether it’s on the camera or the GoPro App.
»
» Shut the camera off: All too often, the camera accidentally records when 
you’re not shooting, leaving you with minutes to hours of recorded gibberish. 
Powering down decreases the possibility of it happening.
Keeping Your Body Parts  
Out of the Picture
When wearing a GoPro — or having one nearby — it’s sometimes impossible to 
keep your body parts out of the frame, especially when you’re having so much 
fun. There are times when a limb or two adds dimension to the shot. When? While 
grasping the handlebars of a mountain bike while zipping through a lush trail, 
dangling your feet off a bridge before bungee jumping, or extending your arms 
while spinning a small child (one that belongs to you, please). But sometimes you 
just want some alone time with the subject, sans limbs. That’s not always easy to 
do, especially with the camera’s expansive perspective.
Here are a few ideas to capture what you want without the extras.
»
» Monitor the scene: Seems like a no-brainer, but the decision to have your 
hands and feet in the scene is fine if that’s your intention. Watching on your 
smartphone is one way to control what the camera will record so you can 
leave out what you choose.
»
» Change the angle of view: Most newer model GoPro cameras offer several 
choices, making the angle of view wide enough to capture the scene, yet 
narrow enough to keep your hands and feet out of it.
»
» Keep your fingers to yourself: For those times you need to handhold your 
GoPro don’t be surprised that your digits will end up in the frame every now 
and again (see Figure 15-2). This is bound to happen sometimes, because the 
camera has no viewfinder and a very wide-angle lens. Unlike those times 
when you include your arms or legs in the shot, fingers do not look intentional 
nor do they act as much of a creative visual device, so be extra careful to keep 
your grubby paws out of the shot.

270     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Don’t be afraid of your own shadow: Still, you should be leery of having it in 
the frame. Unlike Groundhog Day, there is no reason for your own shadow 
to end up in the movie or photo. Remember the GoPro has such a wide field 
of view; you need to be mindful of casting a shadow, especially if the sun is 
behind your back.
Staying Out of Harms Way
Danger, or at least the presence of it, makes using your GoPro more appealing. 
It’s like your sister falling for the bad boy. And just like that situation, it’s only 
impressive when the danger is an illusion and everyone stays safe. Thankfully, 
the sophisticated set of accessories allows you to take things to the extreme, while 
keep you out of harms way. Still, it’s easy to get caught up in the moment, pos-
sibly putting safety in jeopardy.
Here’s what you can do to make security your number one priority.
»
» Be mindful of danger: Don’t do anything you wouldn’t normally do if you 
didn’t have a GoPro. While the camera can capture some incredibly impres-
sive imagery, you don’t have to put yourself in peril to accomplish it (see 
Figure 15-3).
FIGURE 15-2:

an unintended 
walk-on role in 
this shot.

CHAPTER 15  Ten Pitfalls to Avoid     271
»
» Let the camera do the work: Just because you position the camera over a 
waterfall doesn’t mean you must stand at the edge. Not when you could 
strategically use the proper mounts and accessories instead to get close to the 
action without becoming a casualty.
»
» Make sure the camera is not a weapon: Just because the camera is so small 
does not mean it can’t hurt someone if it breaks free. Many accidents occur 
when the camera is not securely mounted, or the mount itself cannot handle 
the force. The camera can fall and hit someone, or the force can transform it 
into a dangerous projectile.
Not Protecting the Camera
As previously mentioned, the camera can break free and end up in a million tiny 
little pieces, or worse, hurt someone. So, while safety of your friends or strangers 
comes first, next in line is the well-being of your GoPro. Just because it can go 
anywhere and do anything, doesn’t mean it will come away unscathed. That’s why 
it’s important to protect the camera as much as possible.

272     PART 4  The Part of Tens
Here are some tips to help ensure your camera stays in place:
»
» Mount the camera securely: Unlike the question regarding the chicken and 
the egg, the first order of business is making sure the camera is securely 
fastened to the mount. Regardless if the camera is mounted to a suction cup 
or mounted to you – make sure everything is tight. Most of the time the 
damage to the camera happens when it comes loose and falls (or flies) to the 
ground with less than favorable results. A second check never hurts, no 
pun intended.
»
» Understand the risks: It’s obvious that if you mount the Suction Cup mount 
to a dirty area on your car hood, it can fly and will not bounce like a ball. The 
same holds true for putting the camera in places where it can fall, be struck by 
a vehicle, or in some way come on contact with something. So be aware of 
where you put it.
»
» Tether the camera (when possible): Sometimes you can save the camera 
when it breaks free by tethering it. Basically, it’s a thin cable or heavy-duty 
string that prevents the camera from falling or hurting somebody.
»
» Put the camera in a safe place: Cameras get damaged or stolen when not 
carefully watched. Many of these situations can easily be avoided with 
common sense. You know, don’t put the camera in the middle of a busy road 
or leave it unattended. There are lots of other situations, but you get the idea.
Capturing the Scene Too Wide
The problem with ultra-wide-angle lenses is they sometimes capture a more 
expansive view than desired. Even when relatively close, the main subject can 
still appear too far away in the frame. Much like sitting on the couch with your 
dog, the GoPro demands closeness. Extreme closeness! And while your furry kid 
will draw closer on her own, it’s up to you to make sure the camera is positioned 
near enough to the subject to not make the scene appear “under-lensed.” (That’s 
photographer lingo for not being close enough.) That can lead to a very boring 
composition, something nobody wants to look at for more than a glance.
Try the following to limit this problem:
»
» Get close to the subject: Put your intimacy issues aside and fill the frame. 
How close? That depends on the subject and how safe it is to get nearby. 
Often that means being only a foot or two away, or at least having the subject 
dominate the frame.

CHAPTER 15  Ten Pitfalls to Avoid     273
»
» Working the angles: Sometimes you can make that wide view less boring by 
changing the angle you position the camera. Even a slight tweak can make the 
wide composition a little more interesting.
»
» Adding foreground subjects: Even when you’re near the subject, you can still 
be too far away. For these types of situations, look for an object in the 
foreground to include in the frame. This can transform a boring scene into 
something more interesting. (See Figure 15-4.)
Losing Control of Your Drone
Much like a hamburger joint next door to your health club, having your GoPro fly 
high into the sky is both a blessing and a curse. Every time you launch the drone 
you run the risk of losing control, and possibly having it fly away never to return, 
or worse, violently crash into a building. Damaging the camera or losing your mini 
airship into the abyss is a buzz kill.
Here are some tips to help keep you airborne.
»
» Start off slowly: Like learning how to drive a car or a ride a bike, it takes time 
and practice to successfully fly a drone. Begin the process slowly in an open 
space, free of poles, wires, and closely-positioned structures. Make small trips 
at first, then gradually become adventurous with each journey.

274     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Be aware of ordinances: Just like a San Francisco morning, the regulations 
for a flying a drone are foggy. That’s why it’s important to check local ordi-
nances before taking flight; otherwise, you may be intentionally grounded 
after your maiden voyage.
»
» Stay away from restricted areas: Some may think of your drone — especially 
those with cameras attached — as enemy aircraft. That could get you in 
trouble, so getting your drone shot down may be the least of your worries. 
Be aware before taking off.
»
» Be mindful of weather conditions: Wind and rain can affect the flight of 
your drone and lead to serious problems like water damage, crashing, or 
both. That’s why it’s always important to check the weather report before 
flying.
Getting the Most Out of Audio
GoPro goes practically anyplace and captures almost everything, yet the footage 
is better seen than heard thanks to those tiny holes on the camera called a micro-
phone. It’s better on the new models that include three microphones. Making it 
worse, older models with a waterproof housing can muffle audio capture. It’s like 
the clarity of speaking to someone with a bucket over your head. Audible, yes, but 
not incredibly perceptible. The garbled audio captured is acceptable, especially 
when protecting the camera, but it can be better.
Here’s what you can do to improve audio quality.
»
» Go naked: Take the camera out of the case to get the microphone out in the 
open. It will certainly improve the sound quality.
»
» Mount it in the Frame: Taking the camera out of the case has its advantages, 
but access to various mounting options does not. That’s where the Frame 
comes in handy. It provides the best of both worlds by keeping the micro-
phone open, yet offers a brace for the camera to freely attach to mounts.
»
» Going with an external microphone: The built-in microphone provides 
acceptable audio, but remember, at best, its still a tiny hole on the top of the 
camera. An external microphone is cumbersome at best, but it’s still a great 
option especially when optimal audio quality is necessary.

CHAPTER 15  Ten Pitfalls to Avoid     275
»
» Capture audio with a sound recorder: Record pristine audio with maximum 
control by using a separate audio recorder. Connect it to a boom microphone, 
a lavalier, or a directional mike and capture the seen with the best possible 
quality. When you’re editing, just match the tracks with the camera sound for 
sync, and then delete the camera track.
Keeping the Camera Safe Near Water
Just as it’s no secret your monthly cell phone bill is always more than they tell 
you, the same can be said about using your GoPro in and around the water. Yeah, 
it’s waterproof, but that doesn’t mean it’s immune to damage. You see, while the 
camera is waterproof (providing it’s in its protective housing), the bad news is it 
sinks like a stone as soon as you let it go in the water. Seems like a horrible irony, 
but it doesn’t have to end up as a statistic.
Here are some tips for keeping your GoPro camera safe near water:
»
» Keep the camera dry: Most of the time, the camera is in its waterproof 
housing, so it’s not going to short circuit when you take it in the rain or even 
shoot with it underwater. That said, if the housing leaks when submerged in 
water it can damage the camera. Prevention starts with being sure the 
housing is properly closed, and that the rubber gasket is in place, free of dirt 
or debris.
A good habit after visually inspecting the O-ring is to run your clean forefinger 
around it prior to sealing in order to detect hair, sand, or other debris. It only 
takes a tiny opening to eventually flood the housing. Also, consider purchasing 
spare O-rings and O-ring grease to have on hand if you notice damage such as 
a crack or nick.
Gone unchecked, these factors can compromise the integrity of the water-
proof case and possibly cause a big problem.
»
» Attach something buoyant to the camera: If you drop it while in the water, 
it will sink, and if there’s a strong current it may drift out to sea. Remedy this 
problem by attaching something to the camera that makes it buoyant like the 
floating Handler, Floaty Backdoor, or a Floaty on the Session, as seen in 
Figure 15-5.
»
» Keep the lens clean: Sometimes water droplets on the lens affect the quality 
of the image, so be sure to clean the lens regularly. There’s no worse feeling 
than having a great shot marred by a droplet.

Power Outage Cutting the Shoot Short
GoPro captures all kinds of magic, but that only lasts as long as its battery life. One 
minute you’re capturing some compelling action at the beach or in the desert, and 
the next moment, nothing, because the power runs out. Sometimes the camera 
runs out of gas because of its limited battery life. But often, it’s because the bat-
tery did not have a full charge when you started shooting.
Here are some tips to help ensure that you don’t run out of power:
»
» Make sure the battery is freshly charged: You should get more than an 
hour of shooting pleasure from a freshly charged battery. The same can’t be 
said for the charge left over from the last shoot.
»
» Bring an extra battery: Relatively speaking, GoPro batteries are inexpensive, 
so it’s not a bad idea to carry an extra. And if you need more time, try a Battery 
BacPac for getting the most life on a single charge.
»
» Carry a Portable Power Pack: You know, those portable packs that provide 
extra juice for your cell phone. Well, they also work for your camera. GoPro 
also makes one specifically for your camera.

Ten Ways to Improve 
Your Moviemaking Skills
A director makes only one movie in his life. Then he breaks it into pieces and 
makes it again.
— JEAN RENOIR
I 
suppose being a great filmmaker and descendant of the great impressionist 
doesn’t mean you always speak with a gender-sensitive tongue. But the grand-
son of Auguste Renoir, and director of The Grand Illusion makes a valid point. 
While subject to interpretation, it’s not off the mark to say it means that filmmak-
ers learn how to make movies by making movies. Sort of like finding that thing 
you do and keep doing it better and better. But in order to make the next one even 
better, it’s important to continually find way to improve your skills.
So let’s break down the top ten things you should consider to make the best 
­possible movie. Unlike the Late Show With David Letterman, this top ten list 
doesn’t have any specific order. It’s just about making a good movie. While many 
of these apply to moviemaking in general, they are right at home with GoPro.
Planning Each Shot
It’s nearly impossible to assemble a piece of furniture from Ikea without looking 
at a diagram, so why would you try that with your GoPro movie. Whether you’re 
Chapter 16

278     PART 4  The Part of Tens
making a POV movie, capturing an action event, or taking the camera into the wet 
stuff, the mantra remains the same: Plan it out and stick to the plan. Strategi-
cally planning each shot increases the potential for an amazing movie, while the 
alternative leads to ineffective capture, poor framing, damage to your GoPro, and 
bumps and bruises for you.
When shooting your next GoPro movie, consider the following:
»
» Work with a script: It doesn’t have to be a traditional screenplay, just one 
that provides enough structure to anticipate each shot, or multiple 
camera setup.
»
» Calculate your shots: Think of the effective ways to effectively capture the 
subject. Or do the opposite. Figure what will not work, and don’t do it (see 
Figure 16-1).
»
» Budget the necessary time: The bigger the adventure, the more time you 
will need to plan and gather the proper mounts.
Telling a Concise Story
Some of the best GoPro movies show the same activity from multiple perspectives. 
Whether you’re using multiple cameras to capture the scene, or shooting several 
times with the same camera, consider the importance of showing the scene from 
different angles.
FIGURE 16-1: 
This unique 
glass door was 
worked into 
the shooting 
script.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Ways to Improve Your Moviemaking Skills     279
Whether you’re shooting a BMX bike jump, a skateboard trick, or a day at the pool, 
consider shooting the action the following ways:
»
» Toward the camera: Position the camera so action moves toward it.
»
» Away from the camera: Place the camera behind the subject.
»
» POV: Wear the camera to capture that point-of-view perspective.
»
» Side view: Capture the action passing the camera.
»
» Overhead view: Shoot a graphic perspective of the scene from above as 
shown in Figure 16-2.
»
» From below: Cover the action as it passes over the camera.
Shoot to Edit
If you’ve got the first two under your belt, this one shouldn’t present a prob-
lem. Remember to shoot your movies with variations of the scenes you plan to 
use. There’s a misnomer that suggests shooting as much footage as possible, sort 
of like the Alfred Hitchcock version of a gorging bear, so you have a lot to put 
together later.
Not the best plan. It will take you a long time to make sense of it, and you’ll also 
find that you use the key scenes you intended to shoot anyway.
FIGURE 16-2: 
Overhead of 
kid about to 
jump in pool.

280     PART 4  The Part of Tens
Instead, try to capture the necessary shots with the appropriate variations with 
camera angle, focal length, and camera to subject distance. So if you wish to depict 
the subject entering a key location, you can concentrate on the variety of ways that 
happens with an eye on how it comes together in editing.
For each scene, consider the following variations:
»
» Wide, Medium, Tight: Shoot each scene with these variations. Since GoPro 
provides three settings of an ultra-wide view, it means these variations are 
accomplished by alternating your distance to the subject.
»
» Hold each shot: Whether you need two seconds in your movie or two 
minutes, always shoot the scene much longer than you anticipate on using it. 
A good place to start is recording each shot for at least 10 seconds.
»
» Vary your angles: Don’t shoot the entire movie at eye-level; instead, break up 
shots by placing the camera up high or down low.
»
» Establishing shot: Be sure to shoot a strong opening shot for the film as well 
as for each key scene.
»
» Limit each take: This is where rehearsing comes in handy. Try not to shoot 
more than three takes, unless you’re looking to be William Fincher (Fight Club, 
The Social Network). He’s notorious for shooting tens of takes. Clint Eastwood, 
on the other hand, shoots many of his scenes in a single take.
Use the Proper Mounts
The GoPro goes anywhere, doing so with an impressive set of mounting options. 
Some are quite specific to activity; such as using the Handlebar/Seatpost/Pole 
mount on your bicycle, as shown in Figure 16-3, or the Surfboard mount for — 
wait for it — your surfboard. Other mounts are more universal, such as the Suc-
tion Cup, Flex Clamp, or adhesive mounts. Then, there is the Head Strap, Chesty, 
and the Strap for times when you want to wear your GoPro. You can also go old 
school by using a tripod adapter and attaching it to your three-legged friend for 
stability.
Consider the following:
»
» Use the right mount: There are dozens of mounting choices for your GoPro; 
choose the one that works for your shot. Also, make sure it’s properly secured, 
so you don’t mess up the shot, damage your camera, or hurt someone.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Ways to Improve Your Moviemaking Skills     281
»
» Use a tripod: The diminutive GoPro will be hardly noticed atop your tripod, 
but looks aren’t everything. While as disproportionate as a cartoon character 
with a tiny head and a large body, the benefits are overwhelming when it 
comes to great stability and precise framing. You will need an optional 
adapter, but it’s worth it.
»
» Rehearse your moves: For those times when you’re wearing the camera, 
the difference between capturing impressive footage and having trash can 
discards lies in effectively moving though the scene. That’s why it’s a good idea 
to practice your moves before hitting the record button. Use the app to view 
your movements and tweak them for capturing the scene.
Understand GoPro like the Stats 
for Your Favorite Team
Or simply download the Capture app. Why? Because there’s nothing worse than 
fumbling with your GoPro as an important shot passes before your eyes. That 
little bit of uncertainty often becomes the difference between success and fail-
ure. GoPro movies are slightly more complicated than hitting the record button, 
while at the same time, not really complicated at all. It’s just a matter of knowing 
where the controls are located and what they do, so that you can adjust them on 
the fly. While you can do it on the camera, it’s even easier to download and sync 
the Capture App.

Here’s what it does:
»
» Control camera functions: Remotely control your GoPro from near or afar. 
Change camera modes, adjust settings, or delve deeper with ProTune. You 
can make sure it all looks good without even being near the camera. But you 
need to know where they are and what they do, first.
»
» Live preview: No more contorted positions when you can observe the scene 
through your smartphone or tablet. What could make it easier to frame the 
perfect shot?
»
» Share it immediately: Feedback is an important part of the process, and the 
ability to share a clip or photo right after you take it can be helpful. Share 
photos and videos to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and more.
Using Light to Your Advantage
Waiting for the right light shares similarities with going to the Department of 
Motor Vehicles; it’s essential, but sometimes it requires waiting, and other times, 
being in the proper direction. Obviously, early morning and late afternoon light 
is the most flattering, but don’t count out the clouds either, as their cover helps 
capture even illumination. Whatever the case, many GoPro situations put you in a 
passive situation controlling the light.
Consider the following:
»
» Observe the direction of light: Make sure the action is effectively illumi-
nated. It’s hard to always have the sun at your back, especially when the 
camera is separated from you. Nonetheless, the light must illuminate subject, 
not backlight it.
»
» Take advantage of overcast condition: Cloud cover offers many advan-
tages. You don’t have to worry about the direction of light because our 
cumulus friends act like a giant diffuser, providing a flattering illumination 
from all sides.
»
» Shoot night scenes: Sometimes the subject is light, or at least illuminated, as 
shown in Figure 16-4.
»
» Watch out for lens flare: That super wide-angle view is both a blessing and a 
curse. Actually, the wide-angle view is a blessing, but you need to keep an eye 
out for lens flair (that’s when light comes into the lens).

CHAPTER 16  Ten Ways to Improve Your Moviemaking Skills     283
Never Skimp on Composition, 
A.K.A. Occupy Frame!
Compose to create visual prose is what I always say. Sadly, I’m no poet, and many 
let me know it. But I digress. How you fill the frame determines the strength of 
each shot. The more you consider what happens in that rectangular space, the 
better your movie will look. Remember, the audience will never know anything 
more than the visuals they see on screen. You have the power to influence them, 
depending on how you frame the shot.
Remember this:
»
» Look before you leap: Besides being literal advice for us GoPro shooters, it 
also means that you should check your shot and direction of the action before 
pressing the record button. (See Figure 16-5.)
»
» Don’t forget the rule of thirds: Because the subject dead smack in the 
center of the frame rarely looks good, dividing the frame into thirds like a tic 
tac toe board helps prevent this faux pas. The subject never appears center 
square, rather on points of intersecting lines.
FIGURE 16-4: 
The primary 
light source 
for this 
scene is the 
subject itself, 
along with its 
­reflection.

284     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Change the Field of View: Altering the size of the subject in the frame 
provides de facto versions of wide, close-up, and normal views.
»
» Shoot at different angles: Besides shooting at eye level, place the camera 
high and shoot down on the subject, or mount the camera low and shoot up 
at the subject.
Remember to Get Enough Cutaways
While they’re not the main subject, cutaways are an essential part of the sequence, 
and ultimately, the movie. Cutaways are best defined as those shots of anything 
other than the subject that either cue the audience to something they need to 
know or to serve as an interruption to the action.
So many subjects, and parts of subjects, for that matter, fall into this category. For 
example, the tapping foot of a musician, or a hand pulling a set of car keys out of 
a tray certainly qualifies.
Here are some other to consider:
»
» Crowd shots: Think concert film and those fans mouthing the words.
»
» Animals moving away quickly: The flock of birds taking off, the cat running 
away, or a barking dog giving chase all let the audience know something bad 
is about to happen.
FIGURE 16-5: 
While it’s an 
actual leap, it 
was necessary 
to position the 
camera in an 
effective place.

CHAPTER 16  Ten Ways to Improve Your Moviemaking Skills     285
»
» Exterior details: Capture visual details that let the viewer know something 
about the story you’re trying to tell. Show some local flavor, address number, 
equipment indicative to the activity, or any other relevant objects (see 
Figure 16-6).
Don’t Forget about Sound
Admit it! Part of the fun of watching a GoPro action movie is hearing it. That’s 
because great movies have great sound. So take the time to make sure you’re 
getting good clean tones for your next shoot. GoPro audio capture has improved, 
especially on the HERO5. That’s because the waterproof housing no longer 
­smothers the camera’s built-in microphone. Still, it’s not perfect when it comes 
to wind noise.
You can also connect an external microphone to your GoPro using the optional Pro 
3.5mm Mic Adapter, but a more practical solution for high-quality audio is to cap-
ture audio separately with an audio recorder. Not only does this device offer more 
control over audio capture, it also allows you to connect a variety of microphones. 
Afterward, just match the camera audio with the separate recording.
These include:
»
» Stick microphone: These work great for interviews, and when used close to 
the subject (no more than 12 inches.)
FIGURE 16-6:

touch to a 
beach movie.

286     PART 4  The Part of Tens
»
» Shotgun: This long, narrow microphone excels at picking up sounds directly in 
front of it, and not affected by sounds to its side. And as long as you aim a 
shotgun microphone accurately, it has a long range.
»
» Lavaliere: Clip one on your actor or subject, and have no worries of using the 
right microphone. Just make sure you position it correctly so that the fabric 
doesn’t create any noise.
Watch Lots of GoPro Movies
While it’s true that a filmmaker learns how to make films by making films, watch-
ing films is equally beneficial. You can learn a great deal from your fellow GoPro 
moviemakers, and be entertained while doing it. You can absorb ideas about a 
variety of areas from technique and subject ideas to positioning and mounting the 
camera. You can also share your movies, so others can do the same. But it doesn’t 
stop there. You can learn a great deal from feature films, too.
Consider the following:
»
» Connect with GoPro Plus: This subscription service from GoPro allows you to 
access and share content on the cloud immediately after you capture it. Go to 
www.gopro.com for more details.
»
» View GoPro action movies: Search on YouTube to find GoPro movies and 
channels. You can also create your own account to become part of the 
community.
»
» Watch the masters: Observe how Alfred Hitchcock uses visual language or 
how Woody Allen works with so many actors.
»
» Break down really bad movies: Same observation but with a different 
intent. The idea here is to find the aspects that don’t work well in the movie, or 
perhaps, almost work.
»
» Have a healthy DVD collection: You can watch movies on television, but 
buying them at a discount store is your best option. Sometimes you can get 
these movies you more than likely never heard of for a buck or two. You can 
watch them frame-by-frame or in slow motion to learn from the best . . . and 
the worst.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Although it’s always fun, it’s not always easy to use a GoPro camera effectively. 
It’s even more complicated when you try and explain how to do it. It takes a lot of 
support to get it done, so I need to thank some folks.
Let’s start the folks at Wiley Publishing, starting with executive editor Steve Hayes 
for continuing to provide challenges, and for having the patience to ­continually 
modify the plan to accommodate my busy schedule. Thanks to editor Colleen 
­Diamond for piecing this ever-evolving set of words and pictures together in a 
cohesive form.
I would also like to extend a great deal of gratitude to the folks at GoPro. There’s 
nothing like getting sound advice from the people who make the camera. Special 
thanks to Jennifer Meyer.
Thanks to my agent Carol Jelen for continuing to find great projects for me. 
Appreciate all your help.
And once again, thanks to Jillian, Anthony, Stella and Alice for the necessary 
grounding.
