Instant Inductions for Walk Up Street Hypnosis 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Igor: 
So let me just say formally, welcome everyone.  It is great to have 
you all here, look at all of these excited faces.  It’s going to be a 
crazy week of knitting and patterns, so welcome to the seminar.  
You are here for a knitting seminar aren’t you? 
Audience Member: Sure. 
Igor: 
Yeah, exactly.  How many people have trained with me before?  
Hands up, there you go.  So you guys already know what’s coming.  
How many of you haven’t trained with me before?  You guys are 
about to have a roller coaster here of excitement.  We’re here for 
the Walk Up Advanced Street Hypnosis Seminar.  I’m here with 
what I think is the best street hypnotist I’ve ever come across hands 
down, bar none.  Of course this is Anthony Jacquin, you can call him 
master.  So, I think before we start I’d give him a nice round of 
applause because this guy has – Anthony is going to show you some 
stuff that will really blow your mind and I think it is going to be a 
very exciting seminar, so I hope you guys are looking forward to 
things. 
 Before we get in there are a couple of things you need to know.  If 
you look in the back row over here we have all of these lovely faces, 
these are all of our assistants here for the Street Hypnosis training, 
except for someone who just snuck into the assistant chair, but 
that’s okay.  I think you can tell who that is, aside from the slightly 
shell shocked one.  What these folks have volunteered to do, which 
is actually very kind of them because it is a rather large crowd of 
you and we can’t take 80 people out at the same time, it is going to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

be a little bit difficult or at least scary for the world when there are 
more hypnotists in the room than people, so when the time comes 
to actually go out and stuff we’ll split you into groups and you’ll be 
led out by one these guys.  They’ve all had experience with Street 
Hypnosis. They’ll have fun with you, they’ll help you out, they’ll be 
there, they’ll patch things up if things go wrong, so you’re in good 
hands there.  At some point feel free to go up there, thank them, 
shake their hand, buy them a drink, but after the Street Hypnosis 
because having a drunk instructor is not a good idea. Any other 
words or bits you’d like to add? 
Anthony: 
No, it is good to see a few familiar faces and some of those faces 
have done this kind of training with me before.  As you know this is 
about practical skills, so there is a flip chart, but it is not going to get 
used a great deal today.  We’re going to really drill in the technique 
bit by bit by bit until you’ve got the whole pie as it were and so I’ll 
introduce you to my team in a bit more detail later on, but they’re 
all – they’re my best co-trainers.  They’re out there earning money 
doing this and found ways monetizing Street Hypnosis without 
having to do traditional stage hypnosis, so you are in safe hands 
and we’ll have a lot of fun. 
Igor: 
On that note just remember that this is adult learning by the time 
we start taking you out on the fields you’ll have some pretty decent 
skills as a hypnotist even those of you who – any of you not have 
any formal training as a hypnotist before.  Just a few of you?  By 
lunchtime you’ll be putting people on the streets in trance and it 
will be easy.  The thing to realize though is please bring with you 
the same kind of common sense that you’ve lived your entire life 
with because hypnosis is a wonderful tool, but it is not magic.  
We’ll talk more about safety and all that sort of stuff as we go 
along, as the hypnotist you’re in charge of the interaction which 
means you’re in charge of other people’s health and wellbeing and 
so on, so when you go out there by all means have a great time, by 
all means do all these crazy and wacky things, just be respectful of 
the people you work with and make sure that you’re doing it in a 
way that is to be generally healthy and safe for the other people.

We’ll talk more about the things to look out for as we go along.  Just 
bear in mind that at one point when the seminar is over, which will 
be if you think about it, sometime tomorrow you’ll have all the skills 
of a street hypnotist.  You’ll do more interesting stuff, more wacky 
stuff, more outrageous stuff than most of the YouTube videos you 
may or may not have seen.  After that,  it is just a question of 
polishing those skills to give you what you want, whether it’s a 
lecture demo for a formal setting or you have an impromptu dinner 
party where you do something cool or whether you’ll be a paid 
professional doing walk around hypnosis in a bar or restaurant.  It 
doesn’t matter; you’ll be able to develop your own style, your own 
system, your own performance.   
By the time I leave tomorrow, you will all be competent hypnotists.  
So you may as well start now with the attitude which means you’re 
in charge, you’re directing the show, you’re responsible.  Does that 
make sense?  The flip side of that is you’re also responsible for you.  
Believe it or not, we’re not responsible for you.  This isn’t therapy, 
this is not group therapy training and we understand that going out 
meeting members of the public can be a little bit scary.  We’re 
looking at you and you’re members of the public and I don’t know 
about you, but I’m a little bit scared.  Exactly, I should be right?   
The thing is though, when you start working with people, they’re 
going to look to you for the level of interaction.  Make sure that 
you’re in a good state, make sure that you’re having a good time 
and everything will go well.  If for whatever reason you want to take 
a break or you get a little bit too nervous, there’s too much 
pressure being built up or anything like that, there is absolutely 
nothing wrong at all with just saying you know what I’m going to 
take five.  I’ll just watch this one; I’ll sit this one out.  In here this is a 
safe environment, we’ll get lots of stuff done, but we’re not going 
to push you.  You’re not going to be laughed at or ridiculed or 
anything like that if you don’t do the right thing because there is no 
time limit on how long you need to have to get this stuff.  You will 
actually have the skills by the close of tomorrow and you will have a 
nice polished set of skills by the end of the three days.

When you use it is entirely up to you.  You might be having dinner 
with friends and you just feel in the mood and you’ll do just it, or 
you might be out one night after this whole thing is over you may 
not have done anything in particular, but you’re just having a good 
time, having a few drinks with friends and you feel a little playful, so 
you turn to the person next to you and before you know it the 
whole bar is going who the hell is that?   
There is no time limit on when or where you do it, so please be kind 
to yourselves and just enjoy the thing, if you go out and feel like 
doing it great. If you don’t really feel like doing it, no need to do it 
and if you feel like pushing yourself anyway by all means do so.  I 
can’t decide that for you, Anthony can’t decide that for you, you 
need to decide at what point you push and what point you back off 
and relax and take a breather.  Does that make sense to you guys?   
This is very important what we’re doing here because I think the 
last thing that you’re going to have - imagine this scene -  you have 
a hypnotist who’s like this (all nervous and can hardly talk) you can 
kind of see where we’re going with this right?  The good news is we 
have a very polished way of getting to the point where you’re doing 
this stuff so easily, so naturally out on the streets that whether you 
do it to your best friend or a complete stranger it will not make 
much difference to you.  Sound good to you guys?  Alright.  
So, in terms of logistics anything else we’ve got covered, lunch time 
and lunch breaks, we’ll start at nine am again tomorrow morning.  
Those of you who want to come in a little bit early, eight thirty, 
we’ll have a little bit of Q&A presentation, stuff like that so you’re 
welcome to come in early for that or if you want to have that extra 
half hour sleep you’re welcome to have that as well.  We’ll talk a 
little bit more about that later on today.  Other than that really, it’s 
just - the one key thing you have to take with you for the next three 
days, especially once we’re in here, especially out there as well, is 
just your attitude.  Your attitude will make or break what you do 
right? 
Anthony: 
Yep, I believe that.

Igor: 
Bring a good attitude.  Anyone here think they have a bad attitude?  
If you’re raising your hand right now please get out. Keep the 
attitude of interest, of learning something new, of experimenting 
with something. In here, you get to experiment with whatever you 
want, right?  It doesn’t matter if it goes ‘right or wrong’ quote 
unquote, it doesn’t matter.  Experiment, have fun with it.  Push 
your limits.  If there is something you’ve always wanted to be able 
to do with hypnosis, as long as it is ethical and legal, and you’ve 
never quite had the opportunity or the courage to try it out, in here 
will be the perfect place to try it out.  It’s safe here; there are 
friendly people here, if it doesn’t quite work out the same way, you 
have people like Anthony, myself and all these great assistants who 
can come in and help you out and show you where you might be 
missing a step or something on the way, so this is really the place to 
experiment and explore.  Make sense?   
When we get on the streets all you have to do is some very simple 
things and we’ll actually show you how the simplest of things can 
be most amazing and how you put them together in this amazing 
place where people think like wow, how many thousands of years 
have you been doing this?  Who would want that by the way, that 
kind of skill?  I guess if you want that, then there’s some part of you 
inside of you already knows what the attitude is, don’t you?  Can all 
of you picture yourselves being a little different, a little bit more 
relaxed, a little bit more fun, a little bit more charismatic, pulling 
people’s attention and doing amazing things, getting those 
reactions?  Can all of you imagine that to some degree, yes?  Well if 
you can do that, then there’s already some part of you that knows 
how to do this.  The only thing that’s missing might be some of the 
skills and that’s what we are here to fill in, in terms of the gaps.  
Does that make sense?   
Anthony: 
We’ll talk about attitude and being your best self quit often, that 
doesn’t mean that you’ve got to be a clone of myself or Igor, be 
yourself.  Just be your best self.  Be a little bit bigger than the 
person you’re dealing with or be bigger than the group you are 
dealing with and as Igor said, just having an attitude of brightness 
and fascination with your own subject is going to help, but what is

going to help you much more is the fact that hypnosis is the biggest 
hook.  It’s so easy to get people’s attention if you mention it.  
We’ve been here for the last three days hypnotizing everybody, the 
doorman at the hotel, the bar owners, the people on the street, the 
people in theaters, all over the place - the vast majority of people 
we approach are at least up to having a go  – at least 80% of people 
say, yeah, that’s interesting, I’ve always wanted to be hypnotized - 
or no, that’s terrifying - I’ve always wanted to know what it feels 
like and either way you can kind of get started with this, if you just 
be on your top form, realizing yes you can go home and consolidate 
all the learnings and read the scripts and go over it until it is 100%, 
but one of the secrets of being good at this is to understand it is 
actually very simple.   
The techniques are really, really simple and the people you work 
with have no idea what’s coming so you don’t need to raise your 
anxiety level because you stumble on a word or you miss part of the 
script or you find yourself changing the structure slightly. But for 
now, if you haven’t had experience walking up to strangers and 
introducing yourself as a hypnotist, we’re going to give you ways of 
doing that.  There are loads of different ways you can do it and it 
will make it easier when you’ve got their interest, just keep it high, 
just keep them fascinated.  That’s really what I’m looking for.   
Igor: 
To begin that whole journey off, I think the best way to start is by 
finding that spark of the attitude that we just talked about inside of 
you and letting that grow. So that’s the place where you learn all of 
your skills, inside of which and from where you actually begin your 
career as a proper walk up Street Hypnotist, the kind basically that 
can do all of the things you’ve always thought about doing.  Make 
sense?  The best way to start with that –

Group Induction 
 
Anthony: 
Perhaps some simple instructions.  If you all can just place your 
pads down and your pens down and face this way and make 
yourself comfortable.   
Igor: 
– at some point you may want to place your feet flat on the floor. 
Anthony: 
Yes, just place both feet flat on the floor and separate your hands if 
they’re not already and just put them on your lap.   
Igor: 
At some point you may want to take a breath or two, so you can 
begin to relax.   
Anthony: 
Because it’s easy, it’s like sneezing.   
Igor: 
It’s like breathing and you can continue to breathe.   
Anthony:  
As you breathe you’re going to find it easier to focus on your 
breathing if you just allow your eyes to close.  That’s what I’d like 
you to do, just close your eyes. 
Igor: 
With your eyes closed. 
Anthony: 
Understand that you have nothing to do –  
Igor: 
Other than just listen. 
Anthony: 
– nobody wanting anything – 
Igor: 
Nothing for you to do. 
Anthony: 
– there is nobody expecting anything – 
Igor: 
Nothing for you to feel. 
Anthony: 
– some of you wonder – 
Igor: 
Nothing for you to think. 
Anthony: 
– not doing, not speaking –

Igor: 
And you can enjoy. 
Anthony: 
– it might make it easier to not listen – 
Igor:  
Just letting go – 
Anthony: 
– anything in the sound of my voice – 
Igor: 
– and flowing – 
Anthony: 
– other voices – 
Igor:  
– through this experience. 
Anthony: 
– to let go – 
Igor: 
– and enjoy.   
Anthony: 
– if you need to move and make yourself more comfortable you 
can. 
Igor: 
– the process of going inside – 
Anthony: 
Being still now. 
Igor: 
– and finding. 
Anthony: 
All I’m asking you – 
Igor: 
– inside – 
Anthony: 
 
 – is to understand  
Igor: 
- something.   
Anthony: 
All that matters here,  
Igor: 
 - of why you are here,  
Anthony: 
- is your imagination. 
Igor: 
– and what you can do.   
Anthony: 
Other people’s imagination –

Igor: 
– what you can achieve – 
Anthony: 
– you can learn to direct – 
Igor: 
– and enjoy the experience. 
Anthony: 
– shape their experience – 
Igor: 
Focusing all of your mental energy. 
Anthony: 
– there is no need to wonder – 
Igor: 
Something marvelous. 
Anthony: 
– whether you are in a deep trance – 
Igor: 
So just let it all go. 
Anthony: 
– or a light trance –  
 
Igor: 
Allow your unconscious – 
Anthony: 
– whether you get there quickly – 
Igor: 
– to create the process for you – 
Anthony: 
– or slowly – 
Igor:  
– of finding. 
Anthony: 
– you’ll find that you’ll become more aware of things – 
Igor: 
The core reason you are here.   
Anthony: 
– that might go overlooked –  
Igor: 
Letting it grow. 
Anthony: 
– as you relax – 
Igor: 
A feeling builds inside.   
Anthony: 
– you may have an understanding –  
Igor: 
A good feeling –

Anthony: 
– you have a conscious and an unconscious –  
Igor: 
– and all you need to do – 
Anthony: 
– but you have a creative mind— 
Igor: 
– is enjoy. 
Anthony: 
– all that really matters – 
Igor: 
Allowing that feeling to grow – 
Anthony: 
– and pay more attention – 
Igor: 
– to yourself. 
Anthony: 
– those thoughts – 
Igor: 
– inside. 
Anthony: 
– ideas – 
Igor: 
Things are happening. 
Anthony: 
– images – 
Igor: 
Change is occurring – 
Anthony: 
– that drift through your mind – 
Igor: 
– of great importance. 
Anthony: 
– in a continuous flow – 
Igor: 
Every time a house is built. 
Anthony: 
– right from the foundations – 
Igor: 
The foundations are the key. 
Anthony: 
– they dig that hole deep down in the ground –  
Igor: 
Preparing for a proper foundation to be set. 
Anthony: 
–understand that everything you’ve learned and understood–

Igor: 
A lifetime of experiences – 
Anthony: 
– is a resource you can draw upon – 
Igor: 
– are the  best way. 
Anthony: 
– so you can use your imagination – 
Igor: 
To create the space.

Igor: 
Feel differently. 
Anthony: 
– having learned these skills – 
Igor: 
Act differently. 
Anthony: 
–find you can hang on in the knowledge you already have– 
Igor: 
Simple instincts – 
Anthony: 
– to see yourself out there meeting people – 
Igor: 
– aligning themselves.   
Anthony: 
– learning new things – 
Igor: 
Is your true goal. 
Anthony: 
– different people – 
Igor: 
It’s easy.

Anthony: 
– different ways of speaking – 
Igor: 
So soon.  You’ll know how. 
Anthony: 
– imagine you can see that look of fascination – 
Igor: 
It’s as if –   
Anthony: 
– you can see their eyes widening – 
Igor: 
Some part of you all ready knew how to do this.   
Anthony: 
– you’re speaking – 
Igor: 
And you don’t need to know how. 
Anthony: 
– and all you’re doing is putting forward ideas – 
Igor: 
All what that part is.   
Anthony: 
– allowing their mind, their imagination to lock around those ideas  
Igor: 
A sponge absorbs water by its simple nature – 
Anthony: 
– so you can present images – 
Igor: 
– to all. 
Anthony: 
– you can tap into their feelings – 
Igor: 
– you have to do.   
Anthony: 
– and you can raise their emotions – 
Igor: 
You simply allow the sponge to rest – 
Anthony: 
– it’s easy – 
Igor: 
– and the water will be absorbed.   
Anthony: 
– so as you sit there – 
Igor: 
A tense sponge doesn’t really work. 
Anthony: 
– I want you to think about the person dearest to you on this planet

Igor: 
Might as well relax. 
Anthony: 
– if there is more than one see more than one – 
Igor: 
That hand. 
Anthony: 
- get that image of that person in your mind – 
Igor: 
The watch, the absorption taking place. 
Anthony: 
– do it now.  See their face see their – 
Igor: 
How fascinating. 
Anthony: 
– hear their voice,  
Igor: 
-that process is- 
Anthony: 
 
find that feeling – 
Igor: 
Of absorbing. 
Anthony: 
– that memory – 
Igor: 
Without any effort.   
Anthony: 
– that reminds you of the bond you have with them – 
Igor: 
Working all by itself. 
Anthony: 
– as you find that feeling – 
Igor: 
- and all it takes – 
 
Anthony: 
– and as you listen to me – 
Igor: 
– is to relax. 
Anthony: 
– allow that feeling to grow inside – 
Igor: 
Comfortable attitude.   
Anthony: 
– fill up your cells – 
Igor: 
You can do that.

Anthony: 
– the space between your cells – 
Igor: 
That’s right. 
Anthony: 
– deep into your very core –  
Igor: 
And then. 
Anthony: 
– understand that feeling inside of you – 
Igor: 
That’s the place – 
Anthony: 
– nothing you cannot do – 
Igor: 
– and from there everything happens – 
Anthony: 
– go out into that fantasy – 
Igor: 
– and bring it inside you.   
Anthony: 
– get a sense of yourself out there amongst those lights and people  
Igor: 
- and enjoy it – 
Igor: 
– because at some point, I know, in the next couple of hours 
probably you might find yourself out on some sidewalk.  It some 
interesting place, its true when you’re on a sidewalk it’s usually a 
good idea to have your eyes open, so you can interact with people, 
right.  So when you do find yourself opening your eyes at some 
point today, just remember that feeling you had inside and take it 
with you because that’s really the place in which the foundation 
gets built, isn’t it?  To the extent that was a positive feeling, a 
positive experience that you had inside you, isn’t that the ideal 
place to put a whole bunch of skills and abilities that you actually 
want to use at some point?  See it this way, the more you build the 
foundations here, the more you get to feel that every time you do 
Street Hypnosis out there.  Wouldn’t this be a good thing to do?   
We encourage you to maintain that attitude you have inside right 
now, so that as we go into the actual skill building and all the rest of 
it, you use that to develop the whole personality, the whole 
routine, the whole Street Hypnosis skill set that you’ve come to

learn.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Who here is excited by 
the way?  
 
 
Instant Induction Training 
 
Igor:  
You guys excited enough to stand up?  Can I have a volunteer 
please?  Good. Shane’s always the first; I don’t understand how this 
works.  Maybe because he knows what’s coming.   
Alright Shane, look at me, take a deep breath, and sleep, deeper, 
that’s right, deeper, deeper still and we’re going to stand you up 
and you’re going deeper into trance, that’s right.  Balancing on your 
own feet, deeper into trance, as I turn you slowly; just go deeper 
and deeper, deeper and deeper, feeling great.  That’s right, you’re 
doing a great job.  A great job.  And as a thanks for coming up here, 
and being a great demonstration subject, I think you’re your 
unconscious already knows what’s going to happen, don’t you? 
Only this time, that’s right.  I’m going to do it in a very interesting 
way.  We’d like you to notice how his hand is starting to begin to 
rest.  That’s it, just find that hand finding its own balance point, 
there you go, that’s it, excellent.  Now something amazing is  going 
to happen in a moment, Shane.   
You’ve come here to become a great Street Hypnotist have you 
not?  It takes, shall we say, an unconscious mind aligned to your 
purpose to make it easy, fun and exciting.  Now I want you to notice 
that his hand will move toward your chest, but only as quickly as 
your unconscious mind does that alignment.  You will feel it inside 
as a really powerful, wonderful motion that you need to flush 
through you.  You will notice, that’s right, there goes that hand all 
the way over to your chest.  So by the time that hand touches your 
chest you will have the perfect state, the perfect mindset, in order 
to learn Street Hypnosis quickly, easy, naturally.  That’s right, a little 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
20 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
bit faster, there you go.  There you go, that’s right.  And when that 
hand touches your chest, you simply stick it there locking tight as 
you lock those emotions into you, locking that ability into you, 
locking that mental alignment, you can feel that mental alignment, 
can you not?  The whole mind knowing what you want and when 
that hand locks in there; that alignment locks inside.  Try to move 
your hand and notice you can’t, try moving and notice how it is 
stuck because inside of you your unconscious mind is making sure 
that you really get this.  Doesn’t that feel great?  You can try harder 
than that.  The harder you try – there you go – the harder you try 
and the more you fail, the more inside the alignment becomes rock 
solid.  Rock solid.  And on the count of three you are going to open 
your eyes and if you look at your hand, you still can’t move it.  One, 
two, three, open your hand.  Try to move it.  Does it normally do 
that?  What’s going on?  I think I made a mistake, see you. 
Shane: 
 
It’s okay, there are lots of other hypnotists 
 Igor:  
 
Someone is going to have to undo this at some point.   
Shane: 
It will undo it at some point I’m sure. 
Igor: 
Yeah, exactly.  So here is what we’re going to do, you have a choice.  
We’re going to do one of two things.  Either I can undo that 
alignment you had inside or we can release the hand and we can 
make it revert back to normal and normal things.   
Shane: 
Release the hand. 
Anthony: 
Are you sure about that?   
Shane: 
It sounds like a good option.   
Igor: 
Do you think he’s congruent with that?  Alright, so what we’re going 
to do, is go ahead and tap your hand with one, two, three and ahh, 
like magic.  Good job, well done.  Give him a round of applause.   
 
By the end of today every single one of you here will be able to do 
that with pretty much anyone you meet.  Who would like to learn 
to do that?  Right?  Now those of you who have trained with me 
before may have noticed we did things slightly differently to the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
21 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
normal way we teach instant inductions, so bear with me as we go 
through same process.  I know a lot of you will be familiar with this, 
but we will change a few things along the way just to set you up 
specifically for the street.  Is that okay with you guys?   
Those of you who haven’t trained with me before or haven’t seen 
anything like this before, you’re in for a wild time, so just enjoy 
yourself, right?  So what we’re going to do is take that whole 
process and break it down step by step to make it really simple, 
make it really easy; make it very natural to you.  Is that okay with 
you guys?   
First what I want you to do is find a partner – actually what we’re 
going to do is walk around the room and you’re going to do this 
with as many people as possible, with as many people as possible.  
You go up to them, you look them in the eyes and you tell them I 
am an amazing hypnotist.  I really am.  Look in their eyes and say 
with absolute conviction – can anyone do that?   
Audience Member: Sure. 
Igor:  
Can anyone not say that without absolute conviction?   
Audience Member: No. 
Igor: 
Well good, so then you get to turn around and the other person 
does the same to you.  I am an amazing hypnotist.  Wow, really?  
That’s good.   
Anthony: 
Igor told me 
Igor: 
Igor told me so.  Can all of you say that congruently and with a real 
attitude?  Yes?  We’re going to test your attitude now.  Folks you 
have three minutes to tell everyone in the room just how amazing 
you are as a hypnotist.  Off you go.   
So was it easy to introduce yourself as a great hypnotist, yes?  
Everyone enjoying that?   
So the next thing you are to do is we’re going to start looking for 
certain things right?  So I’m going to introduce myself as a great 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
22 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
hypnotist and say, hi, I’m a great hypnotist.  Whatever, it doesn’t 
really matter.  Just come over here and experience some hypnosis.  
All you’re looking for is how they’re walking over and just get their 
attention.  That’s it.  Is that easy to do?  You’re asking someone to 
stand somewhere.  Could you stand over here for a second?  Now, 
just look at me.  Is that difficult to do?  So what we’re doing here is 
– we’ll just do it very quickly and then we’ll elaborate on as we go 
along – you’re all familiar with the ABS formula right?  Everyone 
recognize the absorption of attention part, right?  Just find as many 
people as possible, your job is number one to move them around 
somewhere, just check how well they’re responding and number 
two is to focus their gaze on you, focus their attention. Where their 
eyes go is where their attention goes more or less.  Does that make 
sense?  So you have two minutes to do ten people.  Off you go.   
So was that easy to do?   
Audience Member: Yes. 
Igor: 
Yes?  So what we’ll do now is just add a little refinement.  Notice 
how some people, when you ask them to step over here for a 
moment, they get a little hesitant.  Did you notice that?  With other 
people when you say step over here, they get kind of nice and 
relaxed and are like, oh, this is easy.  Did all of you notice that 
happening just as you were doing this? Yes?  Here is what I want 
you to do, if the person steps over nice and lightly, just come over 
here would you?  There you go.  Then you are in good shape.  What 
that is called is compliance.  They’re following along, is their 
mindset in the game or out of the game, what do you reckon?   
Audience Member: Inside. 
Igor: 
Are they going to be coming along with you, doing the stuff you do 
or is there some resistance?  They come along with you right?  If 
they resist – could you step over here a little bit–  
Anthony: 
But what were we doing? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
23 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
– right?  At this point would you be fair to say we have some 
resistance going on here, right?  Do you want to start your instant 
induction here?   
Audience Member: No. 
Igor:  
No, because you don’t have all of their attention and the critical 
factor has increased rather than decreased.  Does that make sense?  
So we have to put them at their ease.  You can do that with 
language.  We’re going to do something very simple in terms of 
hypnosis.  Do you like to relax?   
Anthony: 
Yeah, of course.   
Igor: 
Come over here and I’ll show you how to relax.  Alright, now let’s 
say I have him completely here, what you do is start playing with 
their body.  Do you see this little rocking motion I have here?  You 
want to test their rocking motion to see how comfortable they’re 
feeling, but you’ll still talk to them as you’re doing this, so really, all 
we’re going to do is have a little experiment on how your mind can 
turn to relaxation.   
If you’ve had a stressful day before, where you felt like you want to 
switch off and just feel good, right?  How would you like to learn 
how to do that instantly whenever you want?  
Anthony: 
 
That would be amazing. 
Igor: 
You’ll notice what I’m doing here as I’m talking to him. I’m going to 
slowly – moving his body around a little bit – this lets me first all get 
his body in a rhythm a little bit of relaxing, but it also lets me test to 
see how well they’re responding at this point.  You see how that 
works?  If he’s rock stiff, rock solid, I may just switch to someone 
else and work with them first.  Otherwise, if I can just talk to him 
about comfort or relaxation or how this really natural, if there are 
any concerns and so on and all the time I’m rocking, this gives me a 
feeling – an instant feedback as to how responsive he is becoming.  
Does that make sense to you guys?   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
24 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So here is what we’re going to do now as a result of this.  You’re 
going to go around and do exactly the same exercise again. In other 
words, you’re going to introduce yourself to someone, hi, I’m an 
amazing hypnotist, can I do some hypnosis and as they walk across 
they’re either be totally compliant or they’ll have a slight hesitation.  
We don’t need to have a great hesitation, just a slight one, right?  If 
you feel a slight hesitation move across – come on over here, all 
right, just like – there’s a little bit more, in fact, that’s okay we can 
deal with that.   
All I want you to do now, if you get a slight hesitation, is turn up 
your attitude, smile at them, do that little sort of rocking back and 
forwards, side-to-side, in kind of random patterns and talk to them 
about, there’s nothing to be concerned about it in terms of what 
we’re doing. We don’t want to hypnotize you yet, I just want to 
show you how to relax.  Have you ever noticed that when your 
mind’s in the right place, your body just relaxes like that and feels 
great, have you ever noticed that?  How would you like to be able 
to do that anytime?   
Anthony: 
 
It would be amazing.   
Igor: 
So notice how each time I have spoken to him his body started 
relaxing more. He’s giving more leeway and setting up the context 
to do the work.  Does that make sense?  All right, guys, do ten 
people.  I’ll give a little longer this time, three and a half minutes, 
off you go.   
Anthony: 
We’re going to take this a little bit further now and one of the – it’s 
kind of a mantra of mine when I’m training people - is to test your 
work, okay?  I’ve got into this via a very indirect, Ericksonian style of 
hypnotherapy, which is good and it’s great language and it’s lots of 
good technique in it I love. And I’ll use some of that on the street 
but most of the time it’s much more direct.  People often mistake 
my stuff being completely direct but it’s pretty direct.   
Many people when I begin with it focus on the induction, which is 
building up to an induction, we’re dropping you right in the middle 
of it here, but when I say, test your work often I’m referring to the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
25 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
stuff we’re going to do later on today, the phenomenon.  If you 
think they’re hypnotized then give them a suggestion; their hands 
stuck, their feet are stuck, they can’t remember something, they 
can see something that isn’t there.  Test your work.  
The vast majority of hypnotherapists never test their work, would 
never know if someone was hypnotized because it might crash and 
burn around, okay?  So that testing process doesn’t just apply to 
amnesia and hallucinations. Right here, what you’re doing already is 
testing.   
This isn’t just a sequence of actions, you’re going to go through like 
a robot and not think about, okay, but by the time we get to this 
place you have – Just come over here, I’m a hypnotist – 
Igor:  
 
All right.   
Anthony: 
 
– Can I show you something interesting? 
Igor:  
 
Sure, of course.   
Anthony: 
Just take a step forward for me and just place your feet together if 
you would, all right.  All of this stuff is to me - is just like this arm on 
the shoulder, it’s just a verbal equivalent.  I’m trying to feel and 
sense his he moving in my direction, not just from a sense of 
compliance, I want compliance, I want him to do exactly what I ask 
him to do, pretty much on the beat that I ask it, okay?  But I want to 
feel, again, resistance can make you think they don’t want to do it.  
That’s not necessarily the case, it’s just misunderstanding.   
 
If they think they’re being dragged somewhere away from their 
friends and they’re less comfortable about that, then they may give 
some physical resistance.  If you give pretty much any reason at all 
to stand there, this is a better spot, stand over here and you can 
relax, any reason, even if it’s a nonsensical reason people will just 
take a step and stand there, okay?   
So when we’re doing this you’re obviously getting to know each 
other and it’s a little bit of a laugh, right?  I want you to genuinely 
try to gage consistently where they’re at, where their attention is at 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
26 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
and Igor will talk about levels of attention later I’m sure, but at this 
point, is that pretty much on the beat, when you give a suggestion, 
when you give an instruction at this point, if you like, rather than a 
suggestion, are they acting on it perfectly?  When you get that hand 
on their shoulder, this is like a sensitivity drill.   
So if I say, you can relax or if you ever have an experience where 
you just need to relax more and I don’t feel that loosen up at all 
then that idea hasn’t been taken on board at all, even though it was 
delivered as a question.  We’re going to drill this in over and over 
and over again until your ears bleed.  But the purpose is not just to 
say these lines without any real engagement, get their attention, 
get their eye contact, put your hand on their shoulder and feel, be 
sensitive as you can to what’s coming back to you because that’s 
how you’re going to get better at it.   
I can tell you the vast majority of the time in a typical Street 
Hypnosis situation, by the time I get to the induction my work is 
done. I’m absolutely certain that I know the induction will come off 
and that’s all down to the simple and constant testing. All right? So 
we’re going add a little piece to it now about getting the eye 
fixation and the best ways of doing that and then we’ll practice 
again.  
Igor:  
 
Okay.   
Anthony: 
 
Yeah.   
Igor: 
Just remember folks that the key here is, you’re responsible; you’re 
the hypnotist, right?  Who is the hypnotist in this room? 
Audience Member: I am.   
Igor: 
Okay, he’s right, he’s over there.  No, you’re the hypnotist, which 
means that the drills we’re doing right now - imagine you’re on the 
street and you’re going to have to do something with this. You’re 
going to get someone’s hands stuck to the wall, hallucinate 
something, whatever.  Does that make sense?  So you need to 
convince yourself, am I happy to put this person in a trance right 
now?  And if there’s any doubt in your mind, well, then either call 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
27 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
someone over or stop playing with it, get a little bit more of this, 
talk to them a little bit more until you find that kind of natural 
receptivity thing coming on.   
 
All of you have a sense that some people were really easy to work 
with, yes?  All of you have sense that some people are little bit 
more like, I don’t know about this, yes?   
Audience Member: Yes.   
Igor: 
That’s the sense you want to develop, that’s the whole thing that 
Anthony’s talking about. All right?  Shall we go on to the next part, 
the eye fixation? 
Anthony: 
Just to add one thing, when you’re giving an instruction to move, 
without getting into complexities, language - just phrasing it as 
would you, could you, or can you, just makes people step right into 
it. They take it as an instruction, as a command. Would you stand 
right here for me?  Would you place your feet together?  It kind of 
assigns some value to it.  So they will go over there, rather than just 
saying, stand there, stand here, do this - it just softens it slightly and 
I find that helps things a lot.   
Igor: 
All right –  
Anthony: 
Yes.   
Igor: 
– so go into the ‘eye’ thing or do you want me to do it? 
Anthony: 
You go for it. 
Igor: 
Okay, so the next thing, again, is at the same point introduce 
yourself as a great hypnotist. Hi, I’m a great hypnotist, did you know 
that? 
Anthony: 
Yes, yes.   
Igor: 
Well, of course, you did.  So if you stand over here you’ll actually 
get to experience it too, isn’t that fantastic?  Wow.  So is this a 
compliance subject or not?  Do I have his responsiveness or not? 
Audience Member: Yes. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
28 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor:  
I do, don’t I.  Well, good, in that case I put both hands on his 
shoulders and now, here’s the key thing, I’m going to look straight 
in his eyes or maybe, get him to look into my eyes. Please look into 
my eyes.  There, so what I’m looking for is, do I have eye fixation?  
Do the eyes become perfectly still? Can you almost notice that 
something shifts? It’s like a breathing shift maybe or a slight change 
in the eyes.  It does not matter if you can tell what the shift was as 
long as you get a sense of something just changed there, I’m not 
even quite sure what it is.  Does that make sense? 
Anthony: 
Possibly the pupils dilated.   
Igor: 
A little dilation of –  
Anthony: 
Yes. 
Igor: 
– of the pupils and we can talk about that later on.  For the moment 
all we’re looking for is, is there a slight shift in that person and do 
they have all their attention locked on you? 
Anthony: 
Yeah.   
Igor: 
Can you get that part? 
Anthony: 
Let me just add one little tip for this eye fixation.  Again, it kind of 
makes it easier.  Some people really struggle to look in your eyes, 
especially if you’ve got both eyes locked on their face.  Their eyes 
will track all over your face, okay?  So often if they’re kind of a bit 
timid they can’t manage to lock on I just say, look here, just right 
underneath my eye, okay, and I’ll point to one spot and rather than 
looking through both their eyes, like this, normally, and just 
habitually now, I just focus on one of your eyes, and I’m actually 
going to look straight through your head, all right?  So, because of 
what that does, it encourages my eyes to fixate and they will not 
move from that point.  I’ll actually look at the light reflecting in 
Igor’s pupil and try, like I’m looking at a magic eye picture, all right.   
 
My eyes will fixate and dilate slightly and they’re gaze then has to 
fixate on a single spot and they won’t move, they won’t look at 
their friends, they’ll just stay locked on.  So we just - when you’re 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
29 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
doing it, rather than it just being this, where our eyes are kind of 
tracking - just get their attention and say, just look here. Just keep 
your eyes on that spot. And then I know that I’ve got his full 
attention, okay?  
Igor: 
Is that easy to do guys?  Notice the different responses you get in 
people’s eye patterns and the focus levels as you do this. There’s no 
right or wrong, just notice how people vary. Off you go, all right.   
So was that easy, yes or no? 
Audience Member: Yes.   
Igor: 
All right, let’s have a little conviction, was that easy, yes or no? 
Audience Member: Yes!   
Igor: 
Thank you.  Who noticed that there’s different levels of attention 
that you’re getting from different people, anyone? 
Audience Member: Oh, yes.   
Igor: 
How do you notice that? 
Audience Member: (Multiple answers at the same time.) 
Igor: 
Body language, eyes, –  
Audience Member: Yeah.   
Igor: 
– just a sense.   
Audience Member: Yeah.   
Igor: 
Just a sense, right.  Whatever that is that you’re doing, that’s what 
you need to be building, that’s your instinct.  That’s why Anthony 
can say without a shadow of a doubt that he’ll know before he 
starts the induction who is going to be a great respondent, does 
that make sense? 
Anthony: 
And just put that in perspective, as I look out at a crowd like this, I 
have no idea who’s going to be a good responder.  I cannot walk

into a room and spot good subjects.  I’ve got to find out by testing 
them out a little bit.   
Igor: 
By giving them – 
Anthony: 
Yes. 
Igor: 
– the little suggestions – 
Anthony: 
Yes, exactly.   
Igor: 
– the little instruction – 
Anthony: 
Yes.   
Igor: 
– the little feedback.  It’s the feedback that tells you what’s going 
on.  Does that make sense?  Is that easy so far? 
Audience Member: Yeah.   
Anthony: 
Yeah, okay here’s the next step.  So you have their attention, you 
introduce yourself, we’ll do the whole same thing, Hi, I’m your 
hypnotist - 
Igor: 
Fantastic. Come over here. Have a step. Fantastic. Look at me, just 
focus on my eyes. That’s right. Now we have the fixation of 
attention, this is the point you’ve gotten to. Next thing is I want you 
to just cup your hand and hold the back of his head.  A lot of you 
are familiar with this already.  I just want you to hold the back of his 
head, nothing else.  Just hold the back of his head, okay? No 
yanking, no pulling, no turning the head off and kicking the football 
around, just hold his attention and hold the back of the head here 
and just wait for a few seconds.  You’ll notice, especially, when 
you’re the subject that it changes something inside you.  Just 
noticed what that is and will talk about afterwards.  Is that okay?  
All right guys, you have one minute to do that to as many people as 
possible, off you go.   
Okay, that was easy, right?  
Audience Members: Yes.

Igor: 
What did you notice when someone was staring at you?  And at 
some point he put his hand at the back of you head and carried on 
staring.  What happens inside of yourself as a subject at this point?  
What kind of things? 
Audience Members: Connected. 
Igor: 
Say again.   
Audience Member: Connected. 
Igor: 
You felt more connected.  What else? 
Audience Members: Weird. 
Igor: 
A little weird, all right. 
Anthony: 
So did he felt weird, what?  Weird uncomfortable? 
Audience Members: Weird and kind of uncomfortable 
Anthony: 
Remember we spoke earlier about motion.  You know, even if 
what’s happening was his hand on my head, that’s still a raising in 
emotion, so it’s still useful.   
Igor: 
What was that?   
Audience Members: Calming. 
Igor: 
You found it calming, okay, what else did you find? 
Audience Members: An altered state of consciousness.   
Igor: 
You start feeling like an altered state of consciousness.  What do 
you think you should do?   The weirdness he felt, that also brought 
the unconscious a comfort, a connection.  All these are signs that 
something like normal reality is no longer working.  Sometimes 
special reality is starting to work, does that makes sense?  So really,  
the induction has already begun, although it may be a fraction of a 
second that you bother with that.  Does that make sense to you 
guys?

I saw a couple of DVD’s - something very interesting here as well, 
which is, when you have the person there, you started carrying on 
with this whole swaying and testing sort of thing because as 
Anthony was saying earlier on, your testing never stops.  Another 
way of thinking of it is, it’s a feedback loop, right?  And the 
feedback loop is constantly cycling. The minute you stop sending 
back the feedback, another words, cycling the feedback loop, that’s 
where trance either stop or where things could happen because 
you’re no longer in the experience, you’re just observing the 
experience.  Does that make sense to you guys?  So you’re always 
alert to that feedback loop.   
 
Anthony: 
Another point I’m going make is this, in any kind of hypnotic 
encounter, even if it’s, you know, a cozy therapy room, or a 
booming club, it doesn’t matter.  At some point, you have to 
become the dominant party in that relationship and again some 
people misinterpret as being overbearing or authoritarian.  That’s 
not what I mean.  I mean it more like in a doctor patient 
relationship; you trust that he has certain expertise.  He’s asking 
you to swing your arms around and do silly things and there’s 
probably a reason even if you might not know what it is.  
And this little step, of just touching the back of the head, I normally 
just place one finger in the back of the head and here’s a physical 
way of immediately become a dominant party in this situation.  
They have a sign of value to what you’re doing. It gives some 
meaning to what you’re doing and they’re now a kind of poised, 
waiting for your next direction, your next instruction. It’s not going 
to come from them because they haven’t really been in this 
situation before.  So, you’re the dominant party and you’re going to 
continue to direct their experience, okay?   
Igor: 
All right, so let’s do something with this, shall we?  So you’ve got to 
the point where you move them around, you have all the rest of it, 
you have their attention, and as Anthony says, you can get to this 
point easily enough, right?  All that you should do now is just the 
set up for something a bit later on.  What I what you to do now, is 
move their forehead into your shoulder, right? Note, I’m not 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
33 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
pulling, I’m not forcing, I’m just gently guiding his forehead into my 
shoulder.  Now that may come with a whole bunch of balance with 
it.  Give me your balance, so I may have his whole body.  Notice 
how I have to take a step back as his whole body comes into me, 
right?  Or I might just have a token nodding of the head and he’ll 
still have most of his balance.  It doesn’t matter, the point is two 
things.  Number one if you’re getting their whole balance, please 
take a step back.  Plant your leg on the ground because you’re 
responsible for that person’s balance at this stage.  Does that make 
sense?  If you are a small person and you have a very large person, 
this may not be the best mix, right?  Do you know what we do at 
that point?  Please have a chair, sit down, you can still do it.   
Anthony: 
Do you want me to sit down to show them?   
Igor: 
So even if there’s a big weight and size differential, you can still do 
the same thing.  Just look at me. Anthony, let’s just turn his chair 
sideways so everyone can see properly.  Okay, so you guys can see 
properly here, yes?  You guys in the back, can you see all right?  
Okay, you still have the same differential.  The size differential has 
been taken care of now, hasn’t it?  I can still have both hands. Look 
at me. I still have the cupping and just bring it forward.  Just 
because he’s sitting in the chair, doesn’t mean you can’t do the 
same thing.  Does that make sense?   
Anthony: 
This point about balance is another soft test at this point.  It’s not 
that they have to go off balance.  It’s not like simply leaning on me, 
and I’m certainly not trying to pull them off balance.  I’m trying to 
get him to that balance point.  I’m trying to get that person’s so that 
they trust this process enough.  So they’re happy to give me their 
entire body weight if that’s the ideal that they’re picking up.  So 
that’s another nice little test to follow so you just touch the back of 
the head and you just lean forward with your body weight and – 
Igor: 
That’s a very receptive person; she’ll like it a lot easier. 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
Igor: 
Okay, guys a quick question over here.  Go ahead 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
34 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
So the question is, what do you do if you’re in the street and there’s 
no chair, right?  We’ll come to that afterwards; there are a lot of 
different actions you can take.  Let’s just get this one out of the way 
first and will deal with those other things after.  Trust me, there’s 
lot of ways of dealing with that, okay?  Any other questions?  
 
So he’s mention that he’s more uncomfortable if he’s right handed 
when he’s actually to the left?  Some people feel more comfortable 
one way, so the question is, is there any difference which way you 
turn them?  It would be different with each person, so I wouldn’t 
worry about that.  The key thing is, if that person’s level of 
discomfort is interfering with the process, then you have to do 
something.  Otherwise, I don’t think it makes any difference.  You’ll 
get used to it over time and you’ll notice if someone feels 
uncomfortable one way, you might try the other way.  Just play 
with that, that’s the easiest thing.  You want to add something. 
Anthony: 
You had a question, didn’t you? 
Audience Member: I was going to thank you for the chair demonstration because I’m a 
short lady.  I’ve been avoiding a lot of the tall guys in this room.  It’s 
nice I don’t have to be on my tip toes it might be – 
Anthony: 
– I was on my tip toes last night shouting in a pro tennis player’s 
ear.   
Audience Member: Yeah. 
Anthony: 
But he still ended up completely hypnotized. 
Igor: 
You’re the hypnotist you can do it with anyone, you just change 
your environment to suit you at that point, right?  Very quickly – 
Audience Member: What if someone doesn’t want to be touched on the head? 
Igor: 
Right, well actually the whole thing is an escalation.  Rules say I 
start touching with the hand shake and I put my hand on their 
shoulder.  Would you like to step over here?  If I having problems 
with my hand on the shoulder here, do you think I’m going to go for 
the full induction of the head, with something like that?  No.  It’s a 
very different thing.  Is he standing over here now?  Notice how he 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
35 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
got both hands on his shoulder now.  That’s even more than 
dominant.  I’m actually inside his physical space.  I am invading him 
further.  I’ve got his eye contact and so on.  He’s going to allow me 
to do this, then unless he has issues around being touched in the 
head, which some people do, then it really won’t be that simple to 
apply to the whole process.   
Anthony: 
You just put this into context.  We’re just starting you with one 
induction – 
Igor: 
– there’s a lot of things he can do and we will get on to some of the 
other stuff later on, as well.  The thing right now is to treat this as a 
training wheel exercise.  A lot of you will actually stick with this for 
many years to come because it’s fun and easy to do.  There’s lots of 
other variations as well.  Don’t worry about that too much right 
now.  And one very important thing to bear in mind is, if it can go 
wrong at some point it will, right?  It’s just life.   
So as long as you take it with a good spirit and go, oh you know, 
sorry about that don’t worry about that.  Come over here and sit 
down, will do it a different way, right?  And then he’s totally 
relaxed, totally chilled, and people tend to be quite good with that.  
And honestly, if they’re still not good with that because you touch 
him on the head and he really didn’t like it and even when you 
apologize and try another method; then actually, thank your lucky 
stars boys and girls.  Thank your lucky stars because that’s probably 
a person you do not want to be hypnotizing in public unless they’re 
paying you a lot of money to overcome some kind of trauma, which 
has to do with being touched on the head and all the rest of it.  All 
right, does that make sense?   
Anthony: 
– and –  
Igor: 
It’s kind of like a built in test. 
Anthony: 
– and the other thing is, the shoulder is just as good as the head.  So 
if you’ve got a lot of hairspray or some reason you don’t want to 
touch the head just – 
Igor: 
– there’s lots of ways you can.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
36 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
– you like cleaner hair.  Just for now use the shoulder. 
Igor: 
For now let’s just keep it very simple and we’ll give you more 
reasons as we go ahead, we’re good?  Okay, so what do we have so 
far?  We have the handshake induction.  We have the first 
compliance test.  We have the second compliance test; we may do 
a little rocking if we get into it.  We have the fixation of attention.  
We have the hand on the back of the head, right?   
Now what we’re going to add is bringing the head forward onto the 
shoulder.  Now, notice a couple of important safety tips.  Those of 
us wearing some eye adornment’s, this is not a good idea to bring 
their head forward because crushing those glasses against their 
eyes is not a real recipe for happiness, especially out there in the 
real world, all right?  So if someone’s got glasses just say something 
like, can I borrow your glasses or could you put your glasses 
somewhere safe for a moment, please?  Don’t take off your glasses 
for now by the way, just because you’re hearing this, keep them on.  
You know, give them a chance to practice taking control over the 
glasses.  Does that makes sense?   
Make sure those glasses are somewhere they feel safe with them.  
May be in their pocket and if it’s a quiet environment like a dinner 
party or something maybe on the table.  In a bar or club, don’t put 
it on the table because they might get more concerned about 
what’s happening to their glasses and so on, does that kind of 
makes sense?  So take care of that person and notice that the part 
of their head that is going to touch your shoulder is right here on 
the forehead.  Nothing below, right?  So you only show that you’re 
guiding the forehead into the shoulder, in that way there’s a nice 
balance point.  Is that easy?  Okay, off you go guys.  Let’s take a 
minute to do that now. 
 
So did you guys enjoy that?  Is that easy?  So that’s healthy and a no 
brainer that part, right?  So now we are going to come to, shall we 
say, the technical part in the whole induction, right?  When I say 
technical, it’s only because most people come in with this 
misunderstanding. The next step, for those who trained with me, 
kind of know what we’re talking about.  You come down the hall 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
37 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
handshaking, induction, coming over here, be nice and friendly with 
a big smile, you have their attention, you have your hand on the 
back of their head.  Now for the induction, essentially to bypass the 
critical factor, is to trigger the startle reflex.  By triggering the 
startle reflex for a brief moment of time, it’ll last for a split second 
to a couple of seconds, depending on the individual.  Their regular 
thought patterns go offline.  That is the opportunity to do 
something, does that make sense?   
 
Now, to trigger this startle reflex all you really need is that (quick, 
gentle tilt of the head forward).  Did you notice his slight blink and 
the quick shift in his posture, right?  Now I don’t necessarily 
recommend going around poking people in the forehead, or you 
can and we’ll talk about that and how to do that later on.  The point 
is, you can do it anywhere, either here or being interesting in doing 
this, right?  That’s another startle reflex.  You notice she’s beginning 
a blink reflex, she had when I did that.  Why, is a sudden startling 
noise close to the body, right?  To trigger the startle reflex in this 
particular induction, all we’re going to do is position it so you can 
see.  I’m just going to use one finger, that’s it, one finger in the back 
of the head.  I’m just going to tip it forward, slightly.  You notice the 
tiny motion of the head?  I am not looking for a big yank, right?  
That is the recipe for law suit.  What I’m looking for is a tiny finger 
in here, as soon as he lost conscious for a second, that little jolt, 
that’s all that you need to do for this to work.  Does that make 
sense for you guys? 
 
So your hand is here and all we’re going to do is a little jolt. You’ll 
see the jolt and from here, very gently, you are going to guide his 
head into the same position you had it before, all right?  So once 
again, I was asking how to do different angles than this.  From this 
position here, a little jolt, and then a guide.  It is not a pull, it’s not a 
force, it is not a hard jerk, it’s not causing a whip lash injury to 
happen, literally, it’s just a little finger creating that effect and then 
guiding it in.  Can you all do that?  Just spend two minutes doing 
that with as many different people as possible and then we’ll come 
back.

Anthony: 
And when you do this, again, this is another sensitivity drill for you.  
Right when you give that tap on the head, you’ll find that reflex 
response, much like a very sharp rise in adrenalin or attention  and 
then it drops off again.  So what I find tends to happen is with that 
tap, it’s almost like it comes forward as a moment of  resistant, then 
they fall into it.  Just like you jumped out and said, boo, and 
someone said, oh God, why did you do that?  It’s the same thing 
that’s happening there, that’s what I’m trying to feel and look for.  
It doesn’t matter if it’s slightly staggering.  Some people get pulled 
off balance by the fact that they get a tap on their head, they look 
up and then kind of give in.  I’m trying to get as much unconscious 
response as I can, trying to read as much as I can from that one 
little tap.  Now you can start. 
Igor: 
Still a question?  So the question is, is it a giving in we’re looking 
for?  What your – 
Anthony: 
– yeah, yeah – 
Igor: 
– looking for is the smoothness, right? 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
Igor: 
If the person gets all rigid like this, well, you’ve already got a bit of a 
spanner in the works.  But if you got like this, now I’ve opened it up 
and can guide it through. 
Anthony: 
– that’s the bit I’m looking for.  That’s going to time that kind of 
guiding, because I now know that they’re breathing out and they’re 
breathing in and you’ve got that trust – 
Igor: 
– some people will drop like a sack of potatoes.  You saw Shane do 
a pretty good version of that one earlier on, right?   Other people 
will be like that and they will be looking at you to determine what 
happens next.  If you go, come on, that’s not a happy response, will 
that be effective?  If you go, that’s right all the way.  So you just 
take everything in stride.  The key you’re look for, is number one, 
smoothness, two, how would you like them to treat you if that was 
you, does that make sense?  So get different reactions from as 
many people as possible with this because, and you’ll all get a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
39 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
relatively wide variance, it’s important that you experience this for 
yourself, make sense?  Off you go, guys.   
Igor: 
So was that easy, folks?  Yes, easy to do?  You noticed a variety of 
responses, yes?  You noticed some people just dropped like a sack 
of potatoes?  Where others were kind of rigid and needed a little 
something extra to release, did you sense that?  Yes, would that be 
fair to say? And did you notice how everyone at some point 
releases once you get the right combination of whatever needs to 
happen, is that correct?  I’d like you to remember that experience 
because that is the foundation on which all you’re hypnotizing, 
especially the induction and so on, will be built.  Every suggestion 
you present will be taken either instantly or there’ll be some 
hesitation and sometimes you have to massage it, for it to naturally 
be accepted, right?  And it will be easy, I’ll just do something slightly 
differently and, oh now it works.  So does that make sense to you 
guys?   
Igor: 
Are you ready for the real magic now?  Are you ready for the fun 
part, the convoluted language pattern that goes with this? 
Audience Members: Yes. 
Igor: 
 I warned you this will tax your memory. 
Audience Members: We’re ready. 
Igor: 
I know.  So you have all the positions over here, right?  You looked 
into their eyes, you focused their attention, you’re happy with the 
attention, hand in the back of the head, you tip the back of the 
head forward.  Now, just at that point, notice how, if they become a 
little resistant at first, but then you don’t see anything?  Notice how 
we have a little bit of the shock and now he’s surrendered?  That’s 
the point the ‘sleep’ comes in.  So you have him, a little surrender 
and ‘sleep’, all the way, that’s right, all the way, that’s it, there you 
go, and then you bring him back.  Is that easy or difficult to do?  All 
you’re doing is adding one word, ‘sleep’.  And if you want to add 
some extra language to make it kind of comforting, crooning, that’s 
all good, go ahead. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Audience Member: Can you use another word besides ‘sleep’? 
Igor: 
So the question is everyone uses the word sleep, is there any other 
word you can use?  Yes, but it becomes more convoluted because 
‘sleep’ is more compact, it has all the ideals in it.  In some 
communities there may be something that fits that community, like 
trances or going inside, or something like that.   
Anthony: 
It’s just for relaxation; it’s a starting cue – 
Igor: 
– exactly – 
Anthony: 
– you can say any of those things.  I hypnotized three and a half 
thousand people before I said the word ‘sleep’ because it seemed 
ridiculous to me.  But as soon as I started saying that word, ‘sleep’, 
because I had some standard hypnotic training, my success rate 
increased massively.  People just seemed to know what it meant, 
they just know what to do.   
Igor: 
Remember, it’s a cultural cue, because people were seen doing it.  
Hypnotic statistics says, what is the one thing that people will 
always say to you when you tell them you’re a hypnotist, look into 
my eyes; oh you’re going to say sleep now, right?  It’s kind of been 
culturally planetized.  You guys saw Vietnam?  Where you have  
constant hypnotists, you know, it’s probably even best that it work 
in many ways.  But watch North America, watch Europe, and even 
the people there have a perception of this.  You may as well use a 
culturally accepted word.  Does that make sense?  And don’t worry, 
after break we’ll come onto other language and so on.  Right now, 
we’re just trying to keep it as simple as possible, adding in just one 
word. 
Anthony: 
Let me just give you one little reminder, okay, we’ve now gotten to 
the point where you are going to say this word.  This is the point 
where, you know, in the lay persons eyes the hypnotics happens.  
So as well as adding that one word, what I add now is my intent, to 
assure the response you want.  As you go around the room now, 
understand that if you learn to hypnotize people with this now, if 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
41 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
you get their attention, you get their compliance, you get that 
fascination and you give them that tap and you say ‘sleep’ and you 
mean it, some of you are going to hypnotize people in here. 
Igor: 
There’s a simple way of doing this.  Everyone hold out your hands 
like this, if you would.  Now I want you to hold onto something 
here.  What this is, is your hypnotic cloak.  Put it around you.  Put 
on your hypnotic top hat.  If you want to have an evil monocle, as 
well, that’s good, too.  Now with that attitude go out and put in the 
word ‘sleep’, off you go.   
 
So boys and girls, how was that?  Was that easy? 
Audience Member: Real good. 
Igor: 
Yeah, it worked okay?  Who enjoyed that?  Okay.  Is it easy to do 
just by putting the word sleep in?  Did you notice how some people 
have a slight hesitation, but you can still hypnotize them as long as 
your attitude is in the right place, it just kind of sooths it away, 
notice, this? 
Audience Member: Yes. 
Igor: 
 Okay, now we have one more piece of this, which is really 
important.  Lots of people think that the induction is when we ask 
the person to sleep.  That is not the induction, actually the most 
important thing you do in that whole process in my opinion, is what 
happens next.  It’s what you say after you say ‘sleep’.  Does that 
make sense? 
 
 We’ll talk a little bit more about the mechanic of this after the 
break, but for a moment I want you to look at a deepener.  The 
simplest way of doing a deepener is just a magic formula, which is 
something which is standard, classic and a mystery, and I kind of 
like it just because it’s really a no brainer to remember.   
 
“The more you relax, the better you feel.  The better you feel, the 
more you relax.”  We have such a feedback loop between feeling 
good and relaxing and feeling better and feeling more relaxed, and 
so on.  Does that make sense?

Anthony: 
What it takes care of, again, for most people, especially the first 
time they’re hypnotized, is that they expected to be asleep or they 
expect not to hear you, or they expect not to be thinking and all of 
that stuff rushes through their mind after you say ‘sleep’.  The fact 
that you just continue talking, tells them without you having really 
stated it,  is that this is fine, this is exactly what I am expecting, this 
is the  perfect situation.  You’re doing brilliantly, right?  The mistake 
a lot of beginners make is they say ‘sleep’ and they kind of look, to 
see if they’re asleep, right?  Are we there, yet?  I guarantee they’ll 
just look up and open up their eyes, however good that induction 
was, they’ll just open their eyes, because they’ve lost direction, and 
so on. 
Igor: 
Incidentally, we might as well practice this.  From time to time 
someone will actually do this.  They’ll, you’ll say ‘sleep’ to them, 
they close their eyes, and come right back up and look at you, like 
what?  What do you do at this point?  Any ideas?   
Audience Member: The better you feel, the more you relax. 
Igor: 
That’s right.  The better you feel, the more you relax.  The more you 
relax, the better you feel.  Now if his eyes are still open, you say  
that’s right, just close your eyes, the better you feel, the more you 
relax, the better you feel, the better you feel the better you relax.  
It doesn’t matter what they do unless you’re having an actual, shall 
we say, some kind of resistance to the response, like they claw you 
away, they’re fighting in the air trying to put your eyes out.  At that 
point I hope you have enough acuity of all your senses to realize 
that something else has gone deeply wrong, make sense?   
 
But for almost anything else that can happen in the whole induction 
as long as you keep rolling, they will eventually slip into the right 
trance.  Think of it this way, when someone goes there and looks at 
you this way, they’re naturally wide open trance, and the very next 
thing you do or say will be a suggestion.  Now, would you want to 
give him this suggestion?  Or would you like to give him the 
suggestion to laugh, right?  So you’re attitude is really important, 
this is the key piece, so remember, put your cloak on, throw it

around you.  Put on the top hat, I like the top hat and the little  
monocle, go ahead. 
Audience Member: Laughter. 
Anthony: 
Were getting to kind of feel you out – 
Igor: 
– we’ll talk about those things later.  Right now the only reason for 
the feet was an extra act of compliance, that’s it.  We don’t need 
the feet.  Hypnosis doesn’t happen with the feet balancing or not, 
it’s purely a simply act of compliance, that may be useful for other 
things we will do later on, but we’ll get on to that.  For the moment 
all we need is the counting we talked about.  Go ahead. 
Audience Member: I find that I got lost when I tried to do this, my mind filled up so fast, 
I got lost doing that simple thing and I actually used deeper, deeper, 
deeper. 
Anthony: 
– deeper, deeper, deeper. 
Igor: 
Okay — 
Anthony: 
– that’s all right. 
Igor: 
So, Jim was saying it sometimes he gets overloaded with –  
Anthony: 
– deeper, deeper, can be used, that’s fine— 
Igor: 
– all the mechanics and it might be too much to remember and that 
in a simple act of trying to do this, you might as well use the Jim 
variation. 
Audience Member: I can’t remember. 
Igor: 
So its two words of hypnotists; ‘sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper’.  Is that easy to do, folks, yes?  Is that so easy to do 
that we can just add one little piece to it to make it proper for the 
street?  It’s something that is only necessary for sleep hypnosis, but 
it’s very necessary for sleep hypnotists.  Shall we add this or do you 
want to do this one quickly and add something else later? 
Audience Member: Add this.

Igor: 
All right, here’s what we’re going to do, we’ll have the whole higher 
mass hypnotists come over here – 
Anthony: 
– fantastic – 
Igor: 
– if you want to be a subject look at me, look at me, here, very good 
and sleep, deep, deeper, deeper, the more deeply you relax, the 
better you feel, the more you feel good, the more you relax and 
deeper and so on, right?  Here’s the problem; what if I’m so into 
this and I think you feel fantastic as you’re going deeper in the 
hypnotic journey, wow, what an amazing experience you’re having.  
How are you guys feeling right now?   
Audience Member: Okay. 
Igor: 
Did you feel a little bit of it was left out, right?  Are you going to 
allow this to be happening here but not over there?  Right?  So we 
need to make sure this is sleep hypnosis, this is foremost.  Even if 
you’re doing an elective demo for a bunch of medical doctors or at 
a Rotary Club that you have client at and so on, you are still 
performing.  You cannot forget your audience, does that make 
sense?  So as soon as you have this person over here; the better 
you feel, the better you relax, and so on, you can give a very simple 
induction.  Now, find your own balance as you go deeper into 
trance.  Now, you have half of the equation.  Now, I can stand back 
and talk to you guys as you go deeper, deeper, and deeper.  The 
deeper you go the better you feel.  The better you feel, the better 
you relax and deeper you go, that’s right. 
Audience Member:  My turn next. 
Igor: 
Thank you.  Did you notice how much more you can include into the 
experience since I’ve done that.  Does that make sense?   
Anthony: 
You’re the audience, unless this is one to one interaction, some 
random acts of clients this isn’t – 
Igor: 
– exactly – 
Anthony: 
It’s not actually for me, it’s for you.  Again stand up and make sure 
you can be heard.  The other thing if you’re an outside or in a bar, is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
45 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
that if you turn your head away from your subject, the chances are 
you will no longer be heard, you would disappear as far as they’re  
concerned and again that will bring them around and  look  for you.  
So just stay, keeping your attention on them, keep your attention 
on your audience, but make sure you stay well within reach.   
Igor: 
Right after this, they’ll settle in and show off doing all this, while 
you’re still paying attention to the audience. For the moment, let’s 
just go through the whole deepening cycle and remember to put 
them onto their own balance.  The simplest way of doing it is 
whatever way you want to describe it, just tell them that.  Having 
their own balance, holding their own balance, will send them 
deeper.  It’s a simple suggestion.  So does that make sense?  Can 
you all do that, yes?   
Audience Members: Yes. 
Igor: 
Hands up if you can do it.  Okay, let’s just get your little attitude 
cloaks on and off you go.  All right we’re almost done.  Was that 
easy to do?  Yes?   
 
Now I want you to notice something.  Do you notice the temptation 
to leave them hanging on your shoulder and keep them there?  Just 
don’t move them, don’t touch them, because you might break the 
spell, and you don’t want to have that emotional reaction.  Just put 
your hands up.  You need to be aware of it right now, because 
people will be watching you, does that make sense?  And you must 
resist it, because whatever happens on your shoulder, can happen 
just as well with them standing on their own balance, if you suggest 
it.  Does that make sense?  So here’s the mechanics I’m 
encouraging you to use and really drill now, all right?  We’ll go to a 
break in a minute, but if you’re going to do this in the break, and I 
would strongly recommend you do it - I’ll come to you in a second, 
if I may.   
So the mechanics are the same thing we did up to here.  The person 
comes in, sleep, all the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper.  Now 
finding their own balance, notice how as I was doing that, I’m 
guiding him back onto his own feet, finding his own balance, going

46 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
deeper and deeper into trance, right?  Now at this point I can carry 
on and talk to him, I’m open to you, but he’s not, is he?  So now I’m 
going to do the same thing I did with Shane in the beginning, which 
is:  I want you to realize I’m going to go very slowly, always telling 
them what’s going to come up.  I’m very slowly going to turn you, if 
you can feel that, taking you deeper into trance.  That’s right, 
turning, deeper, more comfort, deeper, more relaxed, that’s right.  
Now I can stand right next to him.  I can talk right into his ear, but I 
still have all of you guys to pay attention to, does that make sense? 
I can talk directly to him, yet all of you are plainly invisible to him.  
So the audience goes; it’s a very open situation.  Does that make 
sense?   
Now of course, if the audience was behind me I would do it this 
way.  You noticed that right?  So you always find out where the 
audience is and you still bring them into trance.  To do this we’re 
going to go into a break, but we’ll do one exercise first and we’ll go 
straight into a break, is that okay with you guys? 
Audience Members: Sure. 
Igor: 
So you can carry on all through the break if you want, it’s just that 
you’ll miss a break, or you can do it once or twice and then have 
your break, either way, it’s up to you which way to do it.  What 
we’re going to do is exactly what we did up to this point, shake your 
hand, introduce yourself, I’m a great hypnotist, with experience 
hypnotist’s over here, here they come, right?  You have your 
compliance, you have your focus, you have your hand, you have 
your sleep suggestion, deeper, deeper, deeper, finding your own 
balance, deeper you go in trance, each of these are going to be 
different.  You are going to be put in groups of three this time.  Can 
I borrow you a minute, Jim?   
 
Up to this point, I ignored Jim because of all the action has been 
here, hasn’t it?  So now he’s going to be in balance, I will begin to 
turn you slowly as you go deeper, go deeper, deeper, deeper.  Now 
everything you do from this point is for Jim.  Does this make sense 
to you guys?  So as you feel this wonderful relaxing sensation, yada, 
yada, yada I’m going to continuously make eye contact with Jim as

I’m talking over here, because that means his trance reality is 
stronger but includes him in the whole experience.  It becomes 
interactive now.  So does that make sense to you guys?  Is that easy 
to do?   
Audience Members: Yes. 
Igor: 
There’s a couple of questions here, one over here first and then 
we’ll come over to you.  Go ahead. 
 
The question was when do we take their wallet?   
Anthony: 
About another two – 
Igor: 
– two days – 
Anthony: 
– sixty seconds for the wallet, it’s that simple. 
Igor: 
You’re very close, oh and by the way, this is future publicity 
information, of course, right?  Okay guys, so go find a partner.  
Please go into groups of three and play to the audience and have a 
break and we’ll be back here again in fifteen minutes please and 
then the end.

Handshake Inductions, Covert Inductions & 
More Hypnotic Routines 
 
 
Magnetic Fingers 
 
Igor: 
All right, folks.  So, how you guys doing?  Everyone good? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, I’m great. 
 
Igor: 
Who’s having a good time? 
 
Audience Member: Oh, yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah?  Who understands the essence of an instant induction now?  
Just the essence of how to do the mechanics as well as some of the 
nuances you’ll need on the streets, to do it with random strangers.  
And don’t worry; we’ll carry on adding nuances as we go along.  But 
for now, that’s a nice little solid base because believe it or not, after 
this session is the lunch break.  You know what happens at lunch? 
We’re going to go and hypnotize people.  It’ll be a lot of fun.  So do 
you want to play with them a bit? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, as I’ve said, we’ve placed you right into this – not quite in the 
center but we’ve started with an induction, and what happens prior 
to that induction is really important as well.  Some of the time – I 
mean some of the guys in here this morning have said, oh, I’ve seen 
you on the Trovey Connection, really?  Bang.  And they’re out.  
There is no approach.  There is no set up, okay but most of the 
time, when you’re approaching strangers and laypeople, you want 
to give a little bit of intro and it doesn’t have to take half an hour,  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
49 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
it’s not a lecture.  But normally I would use one or two exercises 
prior to actually doing this kind of induction.  They’re things that 
most of you in the room will be familiar with and some of them are 
kind of helped along with physical principles that you might also 
understand.   
 
So we’re going to start with two or three of these exercises that I’ll 
typically use.  And again, even if you know them, I really encourage 
you to pay attention to them again because you’re going to get a lot 
of value out of them once you start to get this idea of testing and 
getting feedback.  All right, so we’ll start with the easiest.  I’ll show 
you a couple ways of using it and then we’re going to break it down 
step by step just the same.  Do it again.  We’re going to practice 
another technique and we’ll break it down in the same fashion.   
 
So if you’re ready, again, just place your feet flat on the floor for me 
if you would.  It’s not compliance.  It’s just because you’ll feel more 
comfortable that way.  And can you place your hands on your lap?  
I’m going to give you some instructions.  I want you to follow them.  
If I ask you to imagine something, do your best to imagine it.  Or if I 
ask you to get a feeling for something, I want you to try and find it.  
Okay, so let’s just start like this.   
 
Can you place your hands out in front of you?  Straight out.  Mind 
the person in front.  Clasp your hands together nice and tight so 
your palms are together and your thumbs are crossed on top like 
you kind of crushed a piece of coal in your hand that kind of 
tightness.  Bend your elbows like you’re making a desperate prayer.  
This is probably where the point where you want to make one.  And 
then put your first fingers up if you would about an inch apart like 
this.  An inch apart if you think that’s an inch, your husband’s been 
lying to you.  All right, an inch apart. 
 
Just look at the gap between your fingers.  Stare at it.  Nowhere 
else.  Don’t look at me.  In a moment, they will touch like they’re 
magnetized.  Like there are two powerful magnets in the tips of 
your fingers.  When they touch, I’d like you to just allow your eyes 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
50 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
to close.  Keep concentrating on the idea that they’re magnets.  
They will move automatically.  They’ll start to twitch like that.  
That’s right.  Don’t fight it.  Imagine it.  When they touch, just close 
your eyes and relax.  Just go inside.  Just like other times and places 
that you’ve had an opportunity to have nothing to do for a time.  
That’s right.  And then just open your eyes.  Excellent.  That shows 
me you can concentrate.  Right?  That’s exercise number one.  The 
vast majority of the people that are hypnotized on the street are 
hypnotized at the end of that exercise.  That’s, that’s when.  I don’t 
tell them that but that’s how it tends to turn out.  Okay? 
 
Let me just give you the same exercise but I’ll just take it one tiny 
step further and then we’ll practice it.  Okay, you can come up here 
if you like.  Give him a round of applause.  How you doing, man?  
Anthony.  Sir, what’s your name? 
 
Elmer: 
Elmer. 
 
Anthony: 
Elmer, just face this way if you would.  Are you happy to be a 
demonstration subject just for a moment? 
 
Elmer: 
Mm-hmm. 
 
Anthony: 
Place your feet together then.  Excellent.  Now, I’m going to give 
you some instructions.  I want you to follow these instructions.  If I 
ask you to imagine something, do your best to imagine it.  If I ask 
you to find a feeling, then that’s what I want you to do.  Okay?  Do 
you happen to have family, children, anything like that? 
 
Elmer: 
No. 
 
Anthony: 
No?  Okay, this is what I’d like you to do.  Place your hands out in 
front of you.  Clasp them together really tight.  Palms together, 
thumbs crossed on top as tight as you can.  Bend your elbows like 
you’re making a desperate prayer.  Put your first fingers up about 
an inch apart.  Look at the gap between them because in a moment 
they will touch and when they touch, just close your eyes and just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
51 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
go inside with your eyes closed.  What I would like you to do is think 
about something you would love to do – something you’d love to 
achieve.  And when such an idea comes to mind, just nod your head 
for me.  Now if you don’t know already, I want you to step into that 
body and be there in that moment.  Seeing what you see.  That’s 
right.  Standing how you stand.  Feeling what you feel.   
 
And as you feel that energy and as you listen to me, your hands, 
your fingers are becoming stuck and bolted together, absolutely 
glued together.  Stuck fast, again, holding that feeling and as you 
listen to me, when you realize that they’re stuck, just raise your 
hands up a little higher so I understand.  Just raise them up toward 
the ceiling so that I understand.  That’s right.  You’re doing 
brilliantly.  And that’s a strange feeling but you find the harder you 
try to separate them, the tighter they will stick.  And this is going to 
start to seem funny to you for some unknown reason.  This is going 
to put a smile on your face.  That’s right.  That smile can wrap 
around that good feeling and be sent and washed through every 
cell in your body, every cell in your system and all the space 
between them. 
 
Now hold onto all the good feelings and just open your eyes.  You 
can relax your hands.  Of course you can separate them.  Thanks for 
doing that, Elmer. 
 
Audience Member: Thank you. 
 
Anthony: 
Cheers.  We’ll see you later.  We’re going to start with the first 
version.  It’s exactly the same thing except I’m adding on a step and 
I’m actually testing my work.  I’m sticking my neck out.  I could 
worry about that and think, this is the start of the course.  I’m going 
to get egg on my face.  What if he pulls his hands apart?  No one 
will believe I’m a real hypnotist.  I’m not going to worry about that 
because I’ve long since stopped caring.  And so will you after this 
lunchtime session.  It doesn’t matter.  One of the most liberating 
parts of this training is getting over times when it goes, pop.  And 
you say, oh, cool.  Put your feet together and you carry on and do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
52 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
something else or you pick somebody else.  Okay?  For now, your 
goal is just to make people’s fingers come together.  Did you want 
to break it down? 
 
Igor: 
Sure.  Okay, guys.  So everyone stand up please.  Please close your 
feet parallel to each other.  Just make sure you check on the ground 
they’re roughly hip width apart.  And put your hands up like this.  
Was that an easy set of instructions to follow?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, find three people and do that with them.  Off you go.   
 
Anthony: 
How many of you are still taking control?  How many of you are still 
introducing yourselves, turn, put the person on the spot, place your 
hands out?  This is just more instructions for them to follow and 
comply with to deliver them in that same fashion, same attitude. 
 
Igor: 
Consider this suggestion experiment we’re about to do as a covert 
form of an instant induction.  Does that make sense to you guys?  
Which means everything in this morning still counts.  It’s just it’ll 
look a little bit different.  Make sense? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so you can all get somebody to stand somewhere and put 
their hands up like this?  Right?  Can you do that?  Everyone do this 
for a moment.  Say yes master. 
 
Audience Member: Yes master. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I got it.  All right.  Hands out.  Clasp hands together.  Bring them 
up to a comfortable position.  Is that easy to do? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, find another classmate and do that very quickly.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
53 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Okay, how did that go?  Easy?  Okay, so a couple of things here.  
Number one, remember you’re the hypnotist which means 
everything you’ve done from stand over here with your feet like 
this or feet like this – those are all suggestions.  Are you still paying 
attention to how they’re responding, yes?  Are you still noticing 
that some people are responding a bit more fully, others more 
hesitantly?  Yes?  So everything still counts.  Now, we’re going to 
start adding more layers in terms of what you’re doing for 
suggestions. 
 
For example, what is the purpose of this?  You want to get their 
hands tightly clasped and it’s going to help you do something in a 
moment.  So remember what Anthony said? 
 
Audience Member: Crushed coal.  
 
Igor: 
It’s like crushing some coal.   
 
Anthony: 
I don’t think I’ve ever said it like that before but by all means say it.  
The point is that it – with a group, I want to make it a little bit 
clearer.  As I said to you there, you deliver every line – deliver every 
line perfectly but it was – it was relaxing.  It was can you place them 
out and make them comfortable like that?  You’ll end up with 
people like this.  Now putting the whole sticking of the fingers aside 
– we’ll come to that.  Getting these fingers to come together is easy 
because it’s mostly based on the physiology of the body, okay?  
That’s, that’s the little secret.  However, they will not come 
together if they’re hands are loose unless they’re very suggestible.  
Okay, so that’s – in a way, it’s a stronger test.   
 
But I want to put all of this in, in the set up.  Can you do this?  Can 
you hold them nice and tight?  Mind your rings.  Mind your nails.  
That kind of stuff if they’ve got jewelry on that implies, do it tight.  
That’s why I’m asking for you to be careful.  Squeeze them nice and 
tight.  Bend your elbows like you’re making a desperate prayer.  So 
at that point, if I’m one to one with someone, I’ll just squeeze their 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
54 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
hands.  Not to the point of being painful but a good squeeze like I’m 
trying to keep them together.  Squeeze them together nice and 
tight.  I want to make sure there’s no gap in here.  Place your 
fingers out about an inch apart, which is where I think – the stage 
we’re at right now.   
 
Then because of the physiological reasons, you can see it’s actually 
difficult for Igor to keep them apart.  That’s not just because of my 
hypnotic powers.  It’s, it’s because you can’t keep them apart if 
your hands are squeezed together.  So if you – you can relax now, if 
you put the tension in and then put the fingers apart, they’re kind 
of spring loaded and ready to go.  So an important next step when 
you get the fingers apart is to make the very next utterance you 
make the goal – what’s going to happen.  In a moment, your fingers 
will touch.  So I’ll say pull your fingers an inch apart.  Look at the 
gap between them because in a moment your fingers will touch.  If 
they get there before you said that, it’s kind of pointless. 
 
Igor: 
Let me just re-emphasize what Anthony is saying there because this 
is so important.  I don’t know about those of you – has anybody 
here experienced this like in public on their own?  Right?  Have you 
ever had the same experiences I had when I first was doing this?  It 
was just, okay, put your hands out like this.  They’ll start coming – 
start coming – oh, bugger.  Right?  In other words, if the effect 
happens before the suggestion, usually people don’t realize that 
something magical has happened which means as soon as the 
hands come out, you want to get that idea out there as soon as 
possible that those hands, those fingers will touch.  Now at that 
point, any point it actually happens – if it happens within 
milliseconds, you’re an absolute hypno-genius.  If it takes a few 
minutes, then you’re still a great hypnotist.  Does that make sense?  
So it does not matter what happens next as soon as you – as long as 
you get that idea out there.   
 
And the key thing as Anthony is emphasizing is palms – everyone 
try this for a second.  Put your hands together.  Push together 
tightly.  Lift just your index fingers apart.  They’re a little bit apart.

Do you notice the tendency for them to want to come together?  
And this is not even with any particular extra tension.  Now, whilst 
you’re here, just relax your palms.  Notice how those hands, those 
fingers stay apart much more easily.  Do you notice that?  Now if 
you do the same thing with your hands clasped – clasp them 
together.  Push your fingers together tightly.  Right?  Now, open 
your fingers apart.  You feel how much resistance there is?  Your 
fingers want to come together.  Now just relax your hands and 
notice that desire almost disappears.  Make sense?  So those are 
the things you don’t want to give them.  You don’t want to give 
them the room.  It’s like, oh yeah, I could be here forever.  You’re 
loading the deck, stacking the deck in your favor so that you can 
start transforming the moment into something truly hypnotic.   
 
Does that make sense to everyone?  So what are the steps again?  
Okay, please stand over here.  Everyone feet apart shoulder-width 
apart.  Everyone can do that?  Everyone can do that?  No?  Okay, 
put your hands out like this.  Clap them together.  I like the idea of 
clapping because it creates energy and force.  Now squeeze the 
hands together nice and tight.  Push them together.  If you use a 
metaphor like some simile – imagine a vice pressing together.  
Imagine a giant is pushing those hands together.  Make it into a fist, 
a block of concrete.  Break it up like this.  Fingers apart.  Squeeze 
the hands tightly.  Fingers apart.  Try to hold them apart because in 
a moment they will touch.  See how I’ve got it out there, right?  At 
this point, it’s only a matter of time.  Does that make sense to 
everyone? 
 
Now, if you want to add language after that, by all means do so.  All 
I really care about is you get the point where hands are squeezed, 
fingers are open and they have the idea inside their mind that those 
fingers will shortly be touching.  Does that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
That’s it.  It’s just one idea. 
 
Igor: 
Yes.

56 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: Can you suggest that the fingers are going to be drawn together by 
telling them beforehand? 
 
Igor: 
So the question is, can you suggest the whole idea of fingers 
touching and so on by telling them beforehand.  Sure, it’s just a 
question of if you make it smooth in the sequence of what you’re 
discussing.  Great.  If it interferes with the flow, then it gets in the 
way a little. 
 
Anthony: 
Well, let’s say you could do that and it’s fine.  It’s a good habit to 
get into to say in a moment, I’m going to do this and this will be the 
result.  That’s, that’s a good thing to do.  But because this is so 
reliable.  I mean – 
 
Igor: 
There is – there is nothing that you – really there has to be like a 
double-jointed weird thing going on –  
 
Anthony: 
– it really is so reliable. 
 
 
So typically I will do this and then I will do the same exercise 
essentially but with their hands.  Okay, so when I do this I say, let 
me show something interesting, bang.  Within ten seconds that 
exercise is finished.  Okay?  Without any rehearsal.  The second one 
I say, look, I’m going to ask you to concentrate again in the same 
way but to use your imagination.  I’ll ask you to close your eyes.  
You place your hands out like this imagining two magnets.  They will 
pull together and touch.  Don’t pretend and don’t fight.  Imagine.  
Okay, so during the second one, I’ll typically rehearse but again you 
don’t need to because the vast majority of people can succeed at 
that too. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  Yes. 
 
Audience Member: The only reason I ask that – 
 
Igor: 
Yes. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
57 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: – is because I’ve noticed when they do that, the thing is they get it 
so quickly… 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so, Michael is saying that the reason he’s asking if you could 
put the suggestion before the hands spread is because he noticed 
that when he did it, his hands come together so quickly, it’s almost 
impossible to get a suggestion in.  Hence you have to be fast.  So, 
just play with it a little bit and you’ll find – you’ll find your own 
rhythm.  Ultimately here’s the key folks.  Do not spend too much 
time on it.  It just happens really quickly.  If you try to over 
elaborate on things, then you, you kind of – 
 
Anthony: 
This is a 15 second exercise – 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
– and again, just to come back to it, if you were struggling with that 
– and I appreciate that some people do struggle to get their fingers 
apart.  The cheesy jokes are, are the reason – there is a reason for 
those jokes.  One is to get people to relax.  But one is to get them in 
the right position.  And this lady’s fingers were this far apart.  It’s 
pointless me beginning until they’re a bit further apart.  So I’ll say 
about an inch apart.  Sometimes I’ll actually hold them apart.  But 
as I said, as soon as I get that and I get you locked on visually, I will 
say, because in a moment they will come together and touch.  I 
haven’t said anything about magnets or wires or pulling or tension 
or – it’s just because in a moment, they will touch.  Two seconds 
later, they’re like, oh, that was weird.  Good, that shows me you can 
concentrate and talk about it and just plow on. 
 
Igor: 
And you can add on all of those things afterwards.  So if you’re 
afraid that they – if you see them coming to this point – they’re 
coming together too quickly, say, no re-open them.  Say, go ahead 
and do that.  Put your hands together like this.  Squeeze them tight.  
Open your hands.  Really open them.  Really open them.  No, really 
open them.  That’s right.  And in a moment, they will touch – 
coming closer and touch.

Anthony: 
That’s fine. 
 
Igor: 
You see? 
 
Anthony: 
That is enough time to do this exercise.  I’m not looking for the 
person to be bowled over impressed.  Wow, you’re the world’s 
greatest hypnotist.  Trust me.  Some people will think that when 
you do this exercise.  It constantly surprises me how much value 
there is in this.  But I used this on pretty much every single person I 
encounter on the street.  Every group.  Every stage hypnosis gig I 
do, I do this and I turn it into a lock because there is just so much 
juice in it and you can get a lot from it. 
 
Igor: 
Does that help you?  So just really take control of your subject and 
if the conditions aren’t ideal, make them ideal.  Everyone can do 
this.  Really it takes – how long does it take to do this whole thing 
from start to finish?  Anyone? 
 
Audience Member: 12 seconds. 
 
Igor: 
Ten, 15 seconds, right?  So if I gave you a whole minute, I mean, you 
could do at least five people, right?  Off you go. 
 
 
So do you – do you enjoy that?  There’s a quick question here first. 
 
Audience Member: Just when we’re doing it – 
 
Igor: 
Let me just give this to you and then everyone can hear the 
question. 
 
Audience Member: – I just notice when you’re doing it and facing them, suddenly 
you’re moving back because their arms are up, your arms are up.  
It’s kind of a little hard to hear.  
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
59 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member:  So do you do it sideways? 
 
Igor: 
Do whatever you feel is right.  You’re the performer. 
 
Anthony: 
You need to be heard. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, so if you could stand next to him – stand next to him.  Put 
your hands down, that’s fine.  The point is, start playing with these 
things because there are a lot of variables.  And I’ll happily tell you 
what I do and Anthony will tell you what he does.  But please do not 
make the mistake of thinking that’s the only way to do it.  Your 
instincts are correct so just follow them.  Does that make sense?  
And by the way, I welcome any questions at any level at any point 
in this seminar.  Just please accept the possibility that from time to 
time we’ll put it right back on you because you will have instinct 
and I want you to develop those instincts because neither one of us 
will be here past the weekend to carry on doing this with you.  Does 
that make sense?  So you had a great instinct.  So feel free to ask.  
Feel free to check.  Feel free to see what we would do and realize 
we’ll probably put it right back on you because you need to 
problem solve as well.  Make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
And again, this is part of what we’re going to get into when you’re 
breaking into people’s physical space.  Okay, I’d normally start here 
so you’re in this position.  Place your hands out in front of you 
because I still – he’s still completely got all of his personal space.  
Okay, just cross them together nice and tight.  Bend your elbows 
like you’re making a desperate prayer.  I’m going to touch at this 
point, okay?  Put your fingers up about an inch apart.  Look at the 
gap between your fingers.  Now I’m here.  Now I’m slap bang in 
position again.  I can see the audience.  I know I can be heard and I 
can control this as much as I want and I can get my feedback.  So 
you can move around but most importantly is you need to be heard 
and secondly you’re, you’re trying to get to the point where that’s 
acceptable.  Where you can just talk in this person’s ear and they 
haven’t even noticed you’ve gone from there to there because it’s a 
series of steps.

Igor: 
Especially in a loud environment you need to make sure that you’re 
heard.  Does that help you guys?  Was that an easy thing to do?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
 
 
Covert Induction 
 
 
Igor: 
So we’re going to do this same exercise again only this time I want 
you to turn it into a little covert induction.  How do we do that?  
Well very simply, add a suggestion.  As soon as those fingers touch, 
close your eyes.  Relax all the way down and enjoy some pleasant 
experience. 
 
Anthony: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Right?  The key here is this is already your first induction so we do 
the formal induction afterwards, well really at that point it’s a no 
brainer, isn’t it?  Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
And just, just one little point on this timing because there is a key 
bit of timing here.  Their fingers are coming together.  As soon as 
they’re a few millimeters away and you can spot that, I just say – I 
would just pace it.  And again, we’ll talk about this idea of pacing 
and when we get there.  But I would just pace it.  I would say, that’s 
right, millimeters to go.  And when they touch, allow your eyes to 
close so it’s still permissive for me.  If you want to be more 
authoritarian, just say, and when they touch, your eyes will close.  
But for me, and when they come together, that’s right, they’re 
going to touch and when they touch, just allow your eyes to close.  
Sleep.  Go deeper, deeper, deeper.  I’m right back in the induction 
second again now.  Okay, so just look for that closing, closing, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
61 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
closing and you know the next thing is going to happen.  And if that 
happens, they will accept the idea of closing their eyes always. 
 
Igor: 
So for the exercise, please don’t take too long.  How long does the 
actual exercise itself take?  15 seconds, ten seconds, right?  So then 
maybe add another five, ten seconds at best of deep relaxation 
type language afterwards then bring them back.  The whole thing 
will take 20, 30 seconds tops.  I mean 30 seconds you’re really going 
to town.  That means if we give you two minutes, you should be 
able to do at least three or four people, right?   
 
Anthony: 
You can do it. 
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  Off you go. 
 
 
 
 
Okay, so let me ask you guys.  How was that? 
 
Audience Member:  Good. 
 
Igor: 
Easy?  Enjoyable?  Who here is enjoying being the trance subject, 
right?  It’s kind of like, wow.  It’s just kind of – wow, I like this.  Well, 
the reason I’m asking you this is because if you’re feeling this good 
now as a subject, what makes you think people out there won’t feel 
just as good?  So when you start thinking about going out there and 
doing street hypnosis with people, I’d like you to not think in terms 
of like, oh, what if this doesn’t work?  What if it – no, just think in 
terms of how good can they feel as a result of interacting with you.  
And that’s it.  It’s going to happen.  The only thing is can you turn up 
this idea inside of your mind that you want to make someone feel 
as good as you did.  Is that a gift you want to share with people?  
Just an idea, right?  Go ahead.

Handshake Induction 
 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, you might as well take your seats because we’re going to 
show you another technique and then break it down.  In fact, Luke, 
don’t take your seat.  Come up here.  You got picked on.   
 
Luke:  
I’ll watch my back pockets. 
 
Anthony: 
Checking your wallet, are you?  Good.  That won’t help you.  That 
won’t help you,  Okay, again, I would normally roll straight from 
magnetic fingers to a similar exercise or to the kind of induction you 
saw earlier, which again was all about fixing attention.  Okay?  So 
that’s going to be core to lots of the inductions – the rapid 
inductions that we use.  So what I’m going to do with Luke is I’m 
going to take him through this exercise.  It’s only going to take a few 
seconds.  I’m not going to really test it but in my own mind I’m 
thinking of it as an induction.  And then I’m going to demonstrate 
the induction I want you to learn next.  Switched on. 
 
Okay, just turn around.  Have we met before? 
 
Luke: 
No. 
 
Anthony: 
Have I ever hypnotized you before? 
 
Luke: 
No. 
 
Anthony: 
No.  Okay, just put your feet together for me.  Are you happy to be 
hypnotized? 
 
Luke: 
Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
All right, let me just show you how it works – the bit of the mind 
we’re interested in using.  First off, I’ll just give you some 
instructions.  Place your hands out in front of you like this.  Clasp 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
63 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
them really tight so your palms are pressing into each other.  
Thumbs are crossed on top.  That’s right.  Bend your elbows.  
Keeping them nice and tight, put your first fingers up an inch apart.  
Look at the gap between them because they will touch just like two 
powerful magnets.  When they touch, just close your eyes and relax 
and sleep.  Sleep and stand.  Your legs will support you.  That’s 
right.  Your legs will support you as you go deeper and deeper 
inside.  In a moment, I’ll say the words, one, two, wide-awake.  
When I do, your eyes will open.  You’ll be back in the room ready to 
be hypnotized.  Move your head when you understand.  One, two, 
wide-awake.  Excellent.  You can pull them apart.  Are you left 
handed or right handed? 
 
Luke: 
Right handed. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, can I borrow that arm?   Is that okay with you? 
 
Luke: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
Now we’re about to get into the induction, just so you know.  So 
first off, I’m going to ask him what seems like an interesting and 
useful question but it’s a pointless question, which is, are you left 
handed or right handed.  I’m not interested in his left, right brain.  
Which hemisphere is more dominant?  I’m just going to work with 
the hand I want to work with.  Can I borrow your arm? 
 
Luke: 
Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
All right, this is a bit like the handshake induction.  In fact, this is the 
handshake induction but it’s done in a permissive way.  So I’m going 
to take his hand.  And there’s many ways of doing this but my 
preferred way is to use the arm that’s on the same side, turn his 
hand around and put it just above his eye line so his palm is just up 
here in front of his face.  Okay?  So just say  are you left handed; 
right handed? 
 
Luke: 
Right handed. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
64 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony: 
Can I borrow your arm? 
 
Luke: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
Good.  Just look up here.  Look at your hand.  Look at the lines.  
Look at one spot.  Now as this hand begins to move toward your 
face like this, your eyes will begin to change focus.  And as you 
become aware of your eyes, just close your eyes and sleep.  Just 
relax.  Deeper, deeper down now.  Now sinking, floating, drifting 
down to sleep.  All the way down now.  Letting go.  Allowing these 
words to just go through your mind and become your reality.   
 
Now I’m going to show you how you can use this, this new 
understanding in a way that is useful to you.  So in a moment what 
I’m going to do is I’m going to touch the back of your right hand and 
it’s going to start to feel light and lift upwards towards your face.  
It’s going to start to be pulled up as if it’s being pulled up on an 
invisible wire.  You’ll feel your elbow bending, your arm beginning 
to lift, your wrist lifting.   
 
As it lifts, you’re going to enjoy this growing sense of well being, 
this unusual sense of wellbeing higher and higher up towards your 
face.  That’s right, filling up with confidence, letting go of any 
inhibitions as it gets closer and closer to your face.  Understanding 
you already have the knowledge you need to be a great hypnotist.  
And the closer that gets to your face, the better you’re going to 
feel.  In fact, this is going to start to seem funny to you.  That’s right.  
It’s going to start to seem funny to you.  That smile on your face is 
going to turn into a little grin that’s going to turn into a chuckle.  
That’s right.  That chuckle is going to turn into a laugh.   
 
And you can think about something to do with Street Hypnosis 
you’d love to feel differently about.  Something if you could smile or 
laugh about, you’d be so much better off.  And you can put it in its 
true perspective.  And when that hand touches your head, you’re 
going to burst out laughing as inappropriately as you possibly can.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
65 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
You’re just going to laugh and laugh and laugh.  You feel fantastic 
about this.  You even try and take that situation seriously.  You just 
drift up and you’ll see it from five miles up in its true perspective.  
You can let go of every negative thought.  Let go of every limiting 
belief that you or anybody else has ever placed on you.  Understand 
you have a super powerful mind that’s working for you.   
 
To prove that to you, try to pull your hand off your head and find it 
stuck there.  Find it’s completely glued and bolted to your head.  
Are you trying?  Put some effort in so I can see that you’re trying 
like a strong guy.  Try and pull it off of your head.  It’s a strange 
feeling.  Just relax.  Now go deeper asleep, deeper asleep.  I’ll count 
to five.  On the count of five, you’ll wake up and you’ll absolutely 
know you are the hypnotist.  When we go out there today at 
lunchtime, this evening, for the rest of this weekend and onwards in 
your life, you’ll be able to confidently present yourself as the 
hypnotist and you’ll mean that.  You’ll want to give people this 
experience and show them how amazing an imagination is.  Nod 
your head when that’s on board.  So I’m going to count to five.  On 
five, be wide-awake and alert.  You’re going to have a big round of 
applause.  You’re going to be – big rush of adrenaline going through 
your body feeling amazing.   
 
So one, feeling wonderful, two, to achieve what you want to 
achieve in this course and beyond.  Three, take a deep breath.  Fill 
your chest energy-giving oxygen.  That’s right.  Four, your head 
washed through with cold spring water.  And then five, give him a 
round of applause, ladies and gentlemen.  Okay? 
 
 
Forget all the bit at the end.  Let’s just focus on the induction.  What 
we’re going to do is go out in about an hour or less and you’re going 
to start to get into these exercises with some random strangers.  At 
this point, you don’t have to make them River Dance or jump 
around like chickens.  We just want you to make them feel good on 
the back of this exercise, on the back of this induction or this 
induction.  Okay?  So, we’re going to – Igor and I often talk about 
gifts and random acts of kindness and being a force for good.

66 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
That’s what we want you to be this lunchtime.  Go and show a few 
people how to relax, okay?  So to cover this induction, are you left 
handed or right handed? 
 
Luke: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
You’re right handed.  Can I borrow that arm? 
 
Luke: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
All right, so I point to his arm like I’m asking him to loan me a pencil, 
a pencil case.  Can I borrow that?  Sure.  And people do this.  And 
they’ll often just put it straight out there, okay?  So can I borrow 
your arm? 
 
Luke: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
Good.  I reach over with this hand.  I turn it and there’s three 
instructions.  Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  And look at 
one spot.  That’s it.  I’m just trying to narrow his focus of attention 
to a spot so he’s not looking at me and looking at his friend.  Look at 
your hand.  Look at the lines.  Look at one spot.  Let’s repeat it.  
Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot. 
 
Luke: 
Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot. 
 
Anthony: 
Say it again.  Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at one 
spot. 
 
Luke: 
Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot. 
 
Anthony: 
Now put your own hand in front of your face like this just above 
your eye line.  Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at 
one spot. 
 
Luke: 
Look at your hand.  Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
67 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
All right, you can put your hand down.  Is that easy? 
 
Luke: 
Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Should I send out Igor and ask questions?  Okay, look at your hand.  
Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot.  Go and practice. 
 
Igor: 
Off you go, guys. 
 
Anthony: 
All right, let’s just continue, just a couple of little tips.  Again, lots of 
the inductions that you find in my book and lots of the inductions 
that I’m going to show you this weekend involve you taking hold of 
someone’s wrist – taking hold of their arm and manipulating it a 
little bit, right?  And common to all of these inductions is this little 
grip here.  So when I take hold of somebody – sorry, Igor. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
When I take hold of somebody’s wrist – can I borrow your arm?  Is 
that okay? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
I reach over and again this is another feedback mechanism for me.  
So I’m going to turn the hand and already I’m, I’m at work here.  I’m 
thinking, can I let go of his arm a little bit?  Yes, I can.  I know it’s 
already taken.  Okay, but other people have like a rag doll’s arm.  
It’s heavy.  It’s loose.  And I’m thinking in a moment I’ll let go and 
you’ll go deep asleep and I’ll play it that way.  The only way I can 
really tell that is if I’ve got kind of a loose grip.  And quite a lot of 
you there were just grabbing their wrist.  That will annoy some 
people.  You’ll get this kind of reaction.  But also you can’t feel 
anything anymore.  You can’t really tell if it’s heavy or light.  You 
can’t – you can’t give this ambiguous type touch.   
 
So just get used in these inductions to having a thumb and a second 
finger.  They’re actually doing the work.  And then this finger on the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

back is the finger that as I move his hand to his head, once I feel 
that his arm is starting to go – like right now it’s getting ahead of 
me.  You wouldn’t know that but I can feel it’s getting ahead of me.  
Then I’ll just let go with this finger and this thumb and then I’m in 
this position and I can kind of talk it home if you like from there.  So 
stop the grabbing.  You’ll find that when you’re a bit nervous about 
it, you end up hanging on for like dear life and it doesn’t 
communicate well.  So look at your hand.  Look at the lines.  Look at 
one spot.  Do you think you’ve all mastered that bit?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Let’s hear it. 
 
Audience Member: Look at your hand.  Look at the lines.  Look at one spot. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s half of this induction, okay?  The second bit is – I’ve got his 
attention now.  He’s now focused.  All right, the way I work this is 
I’m just going to pace, pace and lead.  So I’m going to make two 
statements of fact.  Number one is this.  As that hand moves 
toward your face – now I know that’s a fact because I’m going to 
push his hand there.  It’s a fact.  As that moves toward your face, 
the next statement of fact is your eyes will begin to change focus.  
Again, I know that that’s a fact because his eyes are fixed on a spot 
and it’s going to end up there at some point.  They have to.   
 
So the two statements of fact – as the hand moves towards your 
face, your eyes will begin to change focus.  I’m not saying anything 
other than they might begin to.  And when you become aware of 
your eyes, which means not a lot at all other than keep looking, 
close your eyes and sleep deeper, deeper down.  Now some 
people’s arm will drop down like this.  Other people’s hands stay on 
their head.  Others will just float right out here.  It doesn’t matter 
because you’re just going to carry on just using what’s standing in 
front of you, okay?  So let’s just get your hand up in front of your 
face again.  Okay, just a little bit higher so it’s just up above your 
eye line just like it’s somebody else’s arm.  Look at your hand.

Audience Member: Look at your hand. 
 
Anthony: 
Look at the lines on it. 
 
Audience Member: Look at the lines on it. 
 
Anthony: 
Look at one spot. 
 
Audience Member: Look at one spot. 
 
Anthony: 
Now as that hand moves toward your face – 
 
Audience Member: As that hand moves toward your face – 
 
Anthony: 
That’s right.  You can’t stop moving it.  They’re already hypnotizing 
themselves.   
 
Igor: 
There you go. 
 
Anthony: 
As the hand moves towards your face – 
 
Audience Member: As the hand moves towards your face – 
 
Anthony: 
– your eyes will begin to change focus. 
 
Audience Member: – your eyes will begin to change focus. 
 
Anthony: 
And as you become aware of your eyes – 
 
Audience Member: And as you become aware of your eyes – 
 
Anthony: 
– close your eyes – 
 
Audience Member: – close your eyes – 
 
Anthony: 
– sleep.

Audience Member: – sleep. 
 
Anthony: 
Deeper down now.  One, two, wide-awake.  Good, so as your hand 
moves toward your face or as that hand – your eyes will begin to 
change focus.  You’re not really overstating it.  Don’t say they’ll get 
blurry.  They’ll feel tired.  They’ll feel heavy.  Right?  They’ll begin to 
change focus.  Be ambiguous.  Be vague and there’s nothing for 
them to fight.  As it moves towards your face, your eyes will begin 
to change focus.  As you become aware of your eyes – the ideal 
distance at that point is about this much because then you can 
place your hand down.  You can click.  You can do both.  If they’re 
already on their face, you can still get – you can still get it.  But if 
they rise up with an open hand on their face, you, you’ll probably 
lose their attention.  So just try and time it as it moves toward your 
face.  Not pressing too much.  You’re trying to do the minimum 
possible to make that happen the minimum amount of pushing, the 
minimum amount of talking. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, guys.  Is that easy? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so go ahead and find different partners again.  The whole 
thing from start to finish should take you about 30 to 40 seconds 
maximum.   
 
Anthony: 
Try to mix up your partners a little. 
 
Igor: 
So get as many different people as you go through this and just 
have fun.  Off you go. 
 
Anthony: 
Can I make a quick comment?  Yeah, we haven’t really covered the 
wake up yet.  That’s a bit of a mistake.  Even when you’re doing this 
practice – these practices and people are getting hypnotized, again 
you might not know because you may not have tested your work 
and given any suggestions beyond that yet but some of you are 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
71 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
getting hypnotized.  And some people repeatedly getting 
hypnotized will get a bit giggly or a bit laughy and all I would say at 
this point just in plain English do a wake up that suggests they’ll be 
wide-awake, alert.  There will be a learning state, able to absorb 
information, feeling great, ready for their day.  Give each other 
confidence for what you’re going to do.  Absorb the information 
when you go out – you heard me saying – sorry, is it Lee?  Who was 
I working with?  I can’t remember.  I said, you’ll be free of 
inhibitions – free of inhibitions, full of confidence.  They’re just 
generalized statements about feeling good.   
 
So now – as I say, that’s really where we want you to go with this at 
lunchtime is give people a gift.  Now what I did there was I kind of 
tested – when we go through the phenomena later, you’ll see this – 
physical phenomena and emotional phenomena and other binary 
phenomena where they get stuck but we’re going to keep it much, 
much simpler than that.  Those of you who have trained before and 
have perhaps been on some of Igor’s courses and know the stuff 
about the gift, by all means, push on and make it a bit more 
complex.  All right?  But for those of you who haven’t, we’re going 
to – Igor is going to show you something.  It’s just so easy.  No one 
fights.  No one resists.  It’s just making them feel good.  You might 
want to take over. 
 
Igor: 
Fine, I’ll do them.  Okay. 
 
 
 
Hypnotic Gifts 
 
 
Igor: 
Can I have a volunteer, please anyone who likes feeling good?  You 
already had your go.  All right, I’ll have one come up nice and fast 
please.  Give him a round of applause, folks.  Come on up, my 
friend.  Okay, stand here.  You ready to do some hypnosis magic? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Audience Member: Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Excellent.  Can I just borrow this hand? 
 
Audience Member: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
Just look at this hand and sleep all the way.  That’s right.  There you 
go.  Nice and deep and relaxed.   Remember if you got the 
conditions, you can mix and match anything you want, right?  So 
that’s right, deeper and deeper now.  I’m going to turn you.  I’m 
going to turn you and you’ll find yourself mysteriously getting into 
an even more comfortable and relaxed state.  More wonderful 
feelings developing inside as you begin to turn now – that’s right.  
There you go deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper.   
 
So you notice you’ve got my position now ready for doing some 
street hypnosis and playing the things?  Notice how I’ve accidentally 
got some catalepsy.  I don’t look for it but if it’s there, why not have 
it?  Right?  If it isn’t there, I’ll show you in a minute.  All you want to 
do now is suggest something really nice.  Now I know you’ve had 
some pleasant experience in the past, have you not?  And I want 
you just by thinking about it, notice what’s happening inside.  Isn’t 
that feeling beginning to develop again?  Getting stronger, that’s 
right.  And it’s going to get so strong this hand can’t help but lift up 
and touch your face.  When it touches your face, it’ll be a sign that 
your mind is memorizing this feeling so you can feel it anytime you 
want or need to.  There you go.  That’s right.  You can smile all the 
way.  That’s it.  There you go.  Isn’t that an awesome feeling?  
That’s right.   
 
Now I want you to notice something.  Just let go of that hand a 
moment.  Anytime that you want to feel good, just because you 
need a lift up or pick me up, you don’t have to turn to coffee or 
sugar or anything like that.  All you have to do is decide I want to 
feel good.  Now go ahead and touch right up there again the same 
way.  Notice what happens.  Go ahead and try that.  Isn’t that 
amazing?  Did you enjoy that?  This is a gift from your mind to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
73 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
yourself because it’s your mind doing this.  You do understand that, 
right?   
 
So now this is basically the gift.  You see the nature of it?  It’s very 
simple?  All we do now is do the same thing again just assuming 
that we didn’t have the catalepsy – just so you don’t have to look 
for it.  Is that okay with you guys?  So I’m going to come on this side 
because you guys are probably focused on his arm a little bit. 
 
So I want you to just relax this arm nice and loose.  Nice and limp.  
There you go.  Nice and – there you go.  Nice and limp.  There you 
go.  Now of course everyone has good feelings from time to time.  
You’ve had amazing experiences in your life.  I want you to notice 
that as I shake this hand, it makes you think of one.  As soon as I let 
go, that feeling gets stronger.  That’s right and stronger.  Let it go.  
Let it go.  Let it go.  And stronger that’s right.  Every time the hand 
drops, stronger still.  Stronger and stronger that’s right.  Until you 
can’t help but smile at how good it feels.  There you go.  Now 
anytime you need to feel this good, all you have to do is pick up 
your own hand.  Make sure it’s nice and relaxed.  When it drops, 
look how good it feels.  Go ahead and try it for yourself.  Isn’t that 
amazing?  And the best part is you did that for yourself.   
 
So I’m going to count from one to five.  On the count of five, you’ll 
come back feeling simply fantastic.  Alert in every way.  Refreshed 
in every way.  Your whole mind and body has been through a 
mental and physical spa.  Things inside of you are aligned.  You feel 
healthier.  You feel stronger.  You’ll just be all around just having an 
amazing day today.  Of course, the one thing that’s going to carry 
on with you for the rest of your life is this thing here.  Just notice 
that.  That’ll happen wherever you go.  You’ll be totally lucid, totally 
refreshed, totally awake but you’ll still be feeling great.  Isn’t that 
something? 
 
So one, coming out slowly, two, know what a fantastic thing your 
mind has done for yourself.  Three, take a deep, fresh breath in.  
Four, becoming mentally alert, physically alert.  Five, eyes open, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
74 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
feeling simply fantastic.  How you doing?  Good job.  Well done.  
Want to test it out?  Off you go.  There you go. 
 
So the only reason for doing two versions of that – it’s just basically 
so you don’t get fixated on, what if I don’t get the hand straight?  It 
does not matter.  What is the core principle we were using here, 
any ideas linking, visualization, association.  That’s exactly right.  
We’re putting two things together, aren’t we?  If the hand is here, 
that means that when the hand lifts, you’ll feel better.  Lifting, 
lifting, lifting, if the hand’s all relaxed when the hand drops, you’ll 
feel better.  Does that make sense?  Do I have any idea what 
emotion or what experience he was experiencing?  Or do I know it’s 
positive?  That’s the only thing you need to do.  Is that easy?  Right.   
 
So if you’re – do you want to have some simple steps for it?  Turn to 
the person next to you and remind them that they have had some 
really positive experience sometime in the past.  Just turn to them 
very quickly right now and come back.  Is that easy to do?  Right.  
Now who noticed that as soon as you were reminded of that that 
you started thinking about something?  Anyone?  Right.  And that’s 
just within a second.  Not everyone will within the first second so 
the next ingredient is time.  Remind them in several ways of the 
same thing.  You know you’ve had a good experience some time, 
right? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
And when you had that experience, it felt pretty good.  Now there’s 
so many different experience you can choose from.  The point is 
just one of them would make you feel really good.  Wouldn’t it? 
 
Audience Member: Mm-hmm. 
 
Igor: 
Have you noticed already how the smiles increasing and all the rest 
of it?  Just by focusing his attention on it over time, it will just 
happen right?  Unless someone’s had a really miserable life or at 
least likes to be miserable that’s another story, right?  Does that

75 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
make sense to you guys?  Then all you do is you link it to something 
that’s ongoing.  If they happen to have some catalepsy, link it to 
that.  If they happen to have lots of relaxation, link it to that.  The 
key is some physical movement is going to augment the feeling 
until – and I literally – I like to suggest it – until you see them 
smiling from ear to ear.  Like grinning, like this is great.  Why?  
Because I’m lazy and I don’t want to, to figure out – okay, he’s 
blushing more on his left eyebrow which means he’s having a great 
time now.  Right?  I just want to see it and if he’s got this big 
beaming smile, I know there’s a big strong emotion behind it.  Does 
that make sense?  And then just kind of ad lib it.  Just – you know 
what?  Experiment with it a little bit.  Have fun with this.  Does 
everyone have a sense of what they’re doing with this?  Yes?  Any 
questions, yeah, well, we’ll have one over here and we’ll come over 
to here.   
 
Audience Member: Can we go back to Anthony when you had your hand up. 
 
Igor: 
Well, you know what?  Let me just give you this because it seems 
like a little longer question.  That’s fine. 
 
Audience Member: When you had the hand up and you suggest sleep, and they go 
down, I’ve got myself standing there holding their hand.  You just 
let go and let it be cataleptic right where it is? 
 
Anthony: 
It’s just based on one feeling, so if their arm is light and it’s just 
taken by them, and it’s hanging there in this position by one finger, 
say close your eyes and sleep.  Again, it’s kind of 50-50.  Half the 
people just drop their head and their hand will just hang there, in 
which case I’ll say that.  That’s right as that hand hangs there all by 
itself.  If it just drops down, I will say that’s right.  Loose, limp, and 
relax that arm.  Heavy, loose, limp and relax.  I will just say what I 
can see and link it to going more relaxed, more deeper, whatever it 
happens to be.

Igor: 
So, the key is exactly the same as with a gift.  Whatever the 
response they’re giving you is the right response.  It’s the one you 
were looking for all along.   
 
Anthony: 
If you were going to use the hand-to-eye fixation – and I know I’ve 
explained this to you about leverage – you’re in this position, then 
this is the next thing that you can essentially play with.  So, if it was 
a gift, and you wanted to get a feeling to remind them of a positive 
or experience they’ve had, then you’ve got this.  So, that could 
grow in strength as it drifts down and moves toward their heart, 
drops down, moves toward their head.  This is my little sliding 
gauge of positive feelings now.  Just drop down then lift it up.  Put it 
there or talk it up as Igor did in a few scenes of catalepsy. 
 
Igor: 
Just get creative with it, guys.  It’s really easy.  The key is there’s not 
a one right technique.  It’s just how to utilize – how do you use 
whatever’s happening.  Whatever is happening is what you wanted 
all along.  So, you’re okay with that. 
 
Anthony: 
And again, it’s one idea.  We’re going to go on the street in groups 
very, very soon.  You’re going to practice this on each other.  Okay?  
You will draw a crowd.  As many as you possible will do this with a 
stranger by the end of lunch would be great, but keep in mind, not 
inductions, magnetic fingers, and what order – your only purpose is 
to give the person a positive experience.  So, if they saw their friend 
a half an hour later and say, I saw this crazy guy.  He said he was a 
hypnotist.  I don’t know what he did, but my hand sort of touched 
me on the head.  I just had this amazing memory of that time blah, 
blah, blah.  And then they just carry on and get on with their day.  
It’s not – it doesn’t have to change their life. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s just they bumped into a hypnotist and this is what happened.  
So, you’ll do it. 
 
Igor: 
Sure.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
77 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony: 
We’ll come on to that on how to do that in a minute just one 
moment.  It’s an easy exercise, right?  There’s a question here 
before we start. 
 
Audience Member: I just want to know at what point did you realize there was 
catalepsy on the – with the previous – 
 
Igor: 
With?  Oh, when the hand was just hanging there and I wasn’t 
holding it?  That was a pretty big hint.  Really, I mean, I can go for 
catalepsy and I can do the whole ambiguous touch thing, and so on.  
But honestly, on the streets, I don’t care.  It’s only for 
entertainment, so I care about what I get.  If I get this, then I’ll use 
this.  If I get – just relax a second.  If I get this, then I’ll use that.  So, 
it really does not matter.  We will absolutely show you before the 
end of today, I think it is, how to get it almost every time.  Right?  
Right now, please do not concern yourself with it.  It is not 
important whatsoever.   
 
It is more important that you realize that whatever response you 
get is the right one, and then we’ll show you how to cheat and 
make them give you the response you wanted even if they start off 
with the wrong one.  Does that make sense?  Okay.  So, guys, you 
understand the exercise, right?  Please make a nice and quick – I 
don’t care what induction you use as long as it’s under 10 seconds.  
So if you want to use hand, focus, and so on, make it nice, and 
snappy, and quick.  If you want to cheat like I did, and mix the first 
induction and this one here, by all means do so. Right now you are 
the hypnotist.  You decide.   
 
 Have a very quick induction, a nice, simple deepening process, and 
what you’re going for is a positive emotion.  Build it up as strong as 
possible with a physical mechanism, where the mechanism is 
movement this way, or movement that way, or movement this way, 
or movement that way.  Build it up over, and over, and over until 
they’re beaming.  At the point in which they’re beaming, the gift 
becomes, you can do this for yourself every time you do this.  Every

78 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
time you do this.  Every time you do this.  So, essentially they’re 
going to repeat whatever motion you use to get the effect.  I think 
it’s the simplest way of doing it. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly, and that little bit tacked on the end there is really quite 
commanding direct suggestion, and when you do this, this will 
happen.  And that – 
 
Igor: 
And you can prove it to them right away. 
 
Anthony: 
– that’s serious work what you’re doing right there, learning to just 
say – state things as fact.  This is what’s going to happen because I 
said so, and when you do it, you’ll smile, and you saw his smile.  
That will make other people smile.  So, just give people positive 
feelings and I’d suggest in this context, keep it vague.  Keep 
ambiguous enough that they very much choose it, but it could be – 
you could be vague and say, a positive experience you’ve had 
where you did something amazing, where you surprised yourself, 
where you found yourself doing things that you didn’t know you – 
that kind of stuff when I achieve something is still vague enough 
that they’ll find one, but it will be detailed enough that it will be 
related to what you want.  You want to get out there in a good, 
positive state knowing that you can do this.  You can achieve it. 
 
Igor: 
All right, guys, so let’s experiment with that just to see where it 
takes you.  Just let the spirit move you, or your unconscious, 
whichever you prefer.  Two minutes apiece, so nice and quick.  Off 
you go. 
 
 
 
Mini Set Piece  
 
 
Igor: 
Okay, how are you guys doing?  Are you having fun?  Okay, who 
enjoyed the gift that was given to them?  Is that something?  Who 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
79 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
would like to be able to give that to other people? Is that 
something?  Okay, good.  So, here’s what we’ll do.  We’re going to 
put together a little, mini set piece – a little routine that you can 
use on the streets with pretty much anyone, anytime, anywhere, 
And it’ll work straight off the bat, just like that with just about 
anyone unless they have some real issues, in which case you’ll be 
able to spot it a mile off and go, I’ll go with your sister.  She’s 
probably a little bit better off.  So, what I wanted to have is four 
volunteers – volunteers – One, two, anyone else?  Three, four, 
come on up.  Give them a round of applause, guys. 
 
Let’s come on this side.  Let’s move this out of the way for you guys.  
Let’s come on this side guys, all of you.  Get nice and close.  Get all 
friendly.  Okay, now these are people.  Is that correct?  I’m a 
hypnotist, unless I have missed the cue somewhere.  So, what we’ll 
do is put together all the steps that we’ve already been using today.  
Does that make sense?  So, so you guys can see.  Let’s move around 
a little bit.  Let’s move this thing back a little bit so that we can get 
all of you in here.  You know what?  Let’s just put this down here.  
And you just grab that for me guys.  Thank you.  All right, guys, let’s 
take a – stand over here in the corner so we can all see you.   
 
Not too far back then these guys can’t see.  Just come forward a 
little bit.  Just a little diagonal – let’s get a little a diagonal line right 
there – little diagonal.  Good.  Come a little forward.  Beautiful.  
Now, did you notice how just in my setup I have the compliance 
test all ready, do I not?  Okay, so what you do is just stand with your 
feet together.  Make sure your toes are touching.  Toes are 
touching.  That’s it, very good.  Now, put your hands out in front of 
you, clasp them together.  Squeeze them nice and hard – nice and 
tight.  This is a test on how well you can follow through, right?  So, 
squeeze them nice and tight.  Hands up like this.   
 
Now, open your fingers about an inch apart – an inch apart because 
in a moment, focus on those fingers and they will touch.  The 
moment they touch, close your eyes, and just relax deeply.  That’s 
right.  Then they come closer together like magnets coming

80 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
together.  That’s right.  Close your eyes and relax all the way down.  
You guys are doing fantastic.  This is proof of how your mind can 
help you relax.  How your mind can make you do anything you want 
to.  I’d like to demonstrate to you the power of the mind through 
the power of hypnosis.  So, on the count of three, open your eyes, 
feel refreshed, simply fantastic, ready to be hypnotized.   
 
One, two, three, eyes open.  How’d you guys think?  Did you enjoy 
that?  Wasn’t that something?  Okay, so what I’ll do now is just take 
this hand here – okay, pull it up, look here, and sleep, all the way 
down.  Now, nice and relaxed.  That’s it.  Stand up where you are 
and stay where you are.  That’s right.  Deeper and deeper relaxed.  
My voice will relax you even further.  My voice will go with you as I 
talk elsewhere.  Nod if you understand.  Very good.  Now, look at 
me.  Can I borrow this hand?  Just look over here and sleep the 
same way.  That’s right, nice and relaxed.  Deep, deep, deep 
relaxed.  You’re doing fantastic.   
 
Look at me, and – that’s right, look at this thing here, and sleep all 
the way.  All the way, that’s right.  You’re doing great deeper and 
deeper.  My voice will help you go even deeper.  You’ll go deeper in 
balance.  Look at these guys a second.  Do you have any idea what 
just happened there?  That’s right.  Sleep all the way.  That’s right.  
All the way, very good you guys are doing fantastic.  As a result of 
having this amazing mind that you guys have, I’d like you to realize 
that you have amazing capacities inside of you, amazing potential 
that lies untapped in most people, and you’re about to tap it.  Nod 
your head if you’d like that.   
 
So, I’m going to take this hand and place it here.  Please not let it go 
any more quickly and you can follow the next instruction.  That’s 
right, very good.  Take this hand, taking this hand right there, taking 
this hand, very good.  In a moment, all of you are going to feel an 
amazing feeling.  As that feeling begins to develop, that hand will 
start lifting upwards – lifting upwards toward the sky.  As that 
amazingly good feeling happens, that hand will lift.  The higher that

hand goes, the better you feel inside.  The higher the hand goes up 
– that’s right, there you go – the better you feel inside.   
 
 When the hand reaches the full stretch, it means that feeling will 
be locked inside you and you can have it anytime, anyplace you 
want.  That’s right.  All the way up, now.  That’s right.  All the way 
up.  You’re doing a great job.  All the way up.  All the way up.  That’s 
right.  All the way up.  Your hand is all the way up.  That’s right, let it 
float.  There you go.  A little bit more now.  All the way up.  What I 
want you to do to lock this inside of you so it’s a gift from your mind 
to yourself that you can use anytime, anyplace you want, I would 
like you to touch your little finger, your pinky finger, and your 
thumb – whenever your pinky finger and your thumb touch like 
this.  That’s right.  Touch your pinky finger and your thumb.   
 
Whenever they touch like this, this feeling will come back stronger 
each time no matter where you are.  If you need to be lucid, you’ll 
be lucid, refreshed, and be alert, only you’ll feel simply fantastic.  
Go ahead and try it.  Open your hand up and touch the pinky finger 
to the thumb, and notice the feeling gets stronger each time, does 
it not?  That’s right to the point that you can’t help but smile.  Open 
the hand and do it for yourself.  It’s kind of like a self-mental 
massage.  Each time the pinky touches – that’s right.  Isn’t that an 
amazing feeling?  Okay, let the hands return knowing that you can 
have this at anyplace, anywhere, anyplace that you want to.   
 
 Now, your hands return back down to your sides.  That’s right.  I’m 
going to count from one to five.  At the count of five you can open 
your eyes feeling simply fantastic knowing that at any time you 
need to simply feel good, just touch the pinky to the thumb, and it’ll 
just be there for you.  One, coming up slowly, two, knowing that 
you’re a fantastic person, that you can bring these good feelings 
and share it with the world.  Three, deep breath inside, refresh your 
mind, refresh your body four, coming back to full alertness.  Five, 
eyes open, simply fantastic, ready to rock and roll.  How are you 
guys doing?  Did you enjoy that?

You guys rock.  You did a good job.  Thank you so much for working 
with me.  It was a real pleasure.  You guys did awesome.  Okay, 
now, give them a round of applause.  You want to see something 
really cool, guys?  Do you want to see something really cool, really?  
Just go ahead and do this, and touch.  Isn’t that something?  You 
didn’t think it was going to work, did you?  All right, guys give them 
a nice round of applause, and off you go.  A couple of questions,  
number one, did you notice that I did nothing here that you haven’t 
done today, is that correct?  Did you also notice how I’m lining 
them up so that I’m in sight of you guys? 
 
 I’m not here hiding myself or hiding them, I’m nice and open so 
you guys can actually have a kind of show going on, is that correct?  
Is that simple to do, easy to do?  Right?  So, what I want you to do is 
get into groups.  Get into groups of three and – yeah, three’s the 
best thing.  So, you’re going to work with two people at a time; one 
hypnotist, two subjects.  You’re going to go through the entire 
sequence from the introduction – hi, I’m a hypnotist, I’m here to do 
some fantastic things, so you want to experience something cool?  
All the way to the finger vice that’s your clue of induction, then to 
over induction, where it’s this one, or this one, or this one.   
 
Honestly I don’t care at this point.  You get to choose, right?  And 
then, in whatever way you wish to, you make them feel good and 
create an association to something that they can trigger off 
themselves again.  Does that make sense?  At that point, remind 
them that at the count of five they’ll be refreshed and so on, count 
them down, congratulate them, turn around, the next person has a 
go.  Easy to do, you have three minutes apiece to go through the 
entire thing, nine minutes as a group.  Pressure!  Off you go, guys.   
 
 
 
So, guys.  How are you doing?  Who enjoyed that, anyone?  Who 
feels like a bit of a street hypnotist, anyone?  Okay, so here’s what’s 
going to happen now.  In a moment, not yet, but in a moment, 
we’re going to split you up into different groups, so you can go out 
with an assistant.  Anthony and I will be floating around so we’ll be 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
83 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
bouncing up between the groups as best as we can.  Please don’t 
expect to see us each time because we’re only mortal.  We cannot 
translocate as easily.   
 
 
We’ll split you up into groups, we’ll tell you where to go and what 
to do and so on. Here is the only thing that is expected of you for 
the lunch break, the only thing we’re going to encourage you to do. 
And honestly, if you don’t feel like doing that, well, you’re adults, 
you can decide not to. 
 
 
 
The only thing we’re going to ask you to do is what you just did. You 
don’t even have to do it with complete strangers, you can do it with 
people in this room. 
 
Anthony: 
We’ll take you out and find some space. Work with a group, work 
with four people. 
 
Igor: 
There’s a couple of things that are going to happen when you do 
this. The first thing is you’re going to start taking your skills from 
outside of this room outside into the real world. 
 
 
That in itself is a simple step, a little soap bubble that we have to 
burst as soon as possible, so you may as well get it over and done 
with quicker rather than waiting, you know, like a band aid where 
you just wait and wait and wait? Just take it off and it’s done, right? 
 
 
The second thing that will happen is, the minute you start having 
people do strange things like this in public, other people will want 
to watch. Now you have a couple of choices about what happens at 
this point. Remember, you’re always playing toward people, so 
you’re not just playing toward your subjects, you’re going to 
constantly open up to other people.  
 
 
So if you’re in a group of roughly ten people, take about three or 
four of them to work with, but then use the others as social proof if 
you like, to look at and play with them to get used to that dynamic, 
make sense?

Anthony: 
You have to keep them watching, just keeping your eye on them, 
but when you’re giving feel good suggestions, random acts of 
kindness, the people in trance are responding, but I’m looking at 
the people who are standing there saying “Let go of every negative 
thought, let go of any tension, and the rest of it” and I’ll say it to the 
audience and then they want to experience that. 
 
Igor: 
And that’s your next subject. So there’s a couple of ways we can do 
this so you have to decide what comfort level fits you. Number one 
is, say Anthony is my subject and I’m working with him and you’re 
the random audience, when I’m working with Anthony, I may just 
look at you guys, smile, give you, if you know how to do this, a little 
eyebrow flash, just making sure they’re part of the group and wave 
them over and say “Come on over and have a look at this.” So I’m 
starting to bring you guys in. 
 
 
If you feel that that’s a little bit too much for you right now with 
remembering all the other things to deal with, that’s fine, that will 
get easier as we go through the day. Then your assistants, assistants 
please wave from the background, just wave, unless you don’t 
choose to be one, it’s up to you. These guys will be right there with 
you, so you can just ask them when people start watching, they can 
start herding people in for you. 
 
 
So you just carry on focusing on your little group and they’ll bring 
people around and you’ll still play to the group, but you don’t have 
to think about the step about getting people in. 
 
 
If you think it’s easy to do what you just did, by all means feel free 
to bring the group in yourself, wave them in, be friendly and so on, 
that’s fine. That’s the only thing you want to do, right? Now, expect 
whoever comes in to be so curious that when someone says, “Well 
you know what, the easiest way is just to experience it, just put 
your hands like this, it’s a really cool little thing, what are you into 
now? Same thing isn’t it? Does that kind of make sense to you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
85 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
guys? It’s a very low key, easy, natural way of getting people 
interested and it’s a no brainer to get people involved. 
 
 
Can you all do those little exercises you did now out on the streets 
with people in this room? Yes? When someone starts looking who’s 
curious, can you, yourself, or have a friend wave them over so them 
come in close and watch? Can you do that? If someone gets a little 
curious, can you just say, “Hey, do you want to try this out? Sure, 
come on in and join these guys.” Is that easy to do? If they’re 
relaxed, great, if not just say “Great, just watch from over there, 
that’s fine too.” Whatever happens you win, don’t you? Is there any 
way you could possibly lose on this one? 
 
 
Let’s face it, if you mess up the induction, the guys from here are 
going to pretend to have a fantastic time, right? So there’s not even 
an embarrassment issue there is there? The fact is, you don’t need 
that, I know this and Anthony knows this and all the instructors who 
have been walking around listening in, they all know this, but if you 
don’t know this yet, this is a great way of finding out that really, you 
can’t fail. 
 
 
Even if you think you might and all that nervousness, it’s taken care 
of because people will be nice to you anyways, but you’ll realize 
how much more powerful this is once you go out on the streets and 
do this. Does that make sense to you guys? Any questions so far? 
No? Excellent, this is what I like to see.

DVD #3 – Part 1 – Las Vegas                             
How to Get Volunteers on the Street &                   
the Unconscious Rapport Signal 
 
 
 
How to Get Volunteers 
 
Igor: 
Let’s start off by having a little chat about what happened out in the 
streets.  How did you guys feel doing hypnosis in the street itself?  
What kind of things did you experience?  Anyone get a little bit 
nervous, perhaps?  Anyone? 
 
Audience Member: During the daytime it was kind of weird. 
 
Igor: 
Doing it during the daytime felt a bit weird.  
 
Audience Member: They were kind of like, “Oh, we’re shopping.  What are you guys 
doing?” 
 
Igor: 
Right, so people that are stopping are shopping. Have you kind of 
had this thing where you’re doing your hypnosis, and people are 
looking, and going, “What’s that?”  And then, they kind of shuffle 
along and they’re pretending not to see.  Anyone have that sort of 
reaction? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Right? 
 
Anthony: 
But a lot of people stopped, did they not? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
87 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
And you know they paid attention.  You can – you should still really 
be aiming to engage at least three-quarters of the people that are 
passing by. 
 
Igor: 
And we’ll show you how to start gathering crowds around you and 
how to start playing with that, actually, as we go through today.  
For a moment, it was just a nice taste experience.  Did you guys 
enjoy it?  Yes?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
How many people here actually worked with – ha – real people 
rather than the pretend people in this room?  Wow, that’s pretty 
good going.  That’s about – that’s almost a half, right?  That’s a 
pretty good effort.  How was it?  Did you enjoy it? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Would it be fair to say that doing it with a ‘normal person’ 
– ‘inverted commas’ - is identical to what you’ve been doing in 
here, to what you’ve been doing outside with people in this room?  
It’s the same, the exact same process, isn’t it?  Right?  Would that 
be fair to say?  So, that’s all that we’re doing.   
 
 
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start refining the set 
piece that you have, putting a few more pieces onto it and 
importantly, adding a very important element, which is, how do you 
actually approach people in the first place to get interested?  Does 
that make sense?   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
88 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Now, as we get into that whole topic, please, bear in mind that if 
the idea of walking up to a complete stranger and saying, “Hey, I’m 
a hypnotist.  I’m here performing today.  You know, you guys are 
looking to have a lot of fun.  Come, and join me, and have a little 
bit, see a little bit about the power of the mind” – if that kind of 
spiel seems a little bit intimidating to you, it doesn’t matter because 
you can do exactly the same thing you did today and people will 
come up to you.   
 
Wouldn’t that be fair to say it’s happened to you guys?   There 
won’t be as many as if you approached them, but there’ll still be 
some.  Then, you get a little mix where you start letting them 
approach you.  Then, you encourage them in and so on.  Does that 
kind of make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
The point is that some people seem to feel uncomfortable, at this 
point, stating, “I’m a performer.  I’m a hypnotist.” 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
And, you know, I appreciate that.  I’d actually suggest that you try 
both. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s have fun with it. 
 
Anthony: 
You know, but if you say, “I’ve been standing outside a terrible 
kabob shop at 3:00 in the morning,” and just said, “I’m performing 
here, haven’t got a crowd.  And I haven’t had a suit on.  And we 
haven’t had any cameras with us.”  It’s just you’ve put a statement 
out there and people kind of believe it if you’re prepared to say it.  
So, even if it’s not performer, using the word “hypnosis” saying, 
“Hypnosis,” even if you say, “It’s not hypnosis.  I’m going to show 
you something that will show you something about hypnosis” it 
doesn’t matter.  It’s still useful to put it out there.  But if you don’t 
do that or you don’t feel you’re dressed for that or you don’t feel 
you want to present it in that way, then just be someone who 
knows about it. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
89 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
Demonstrate with your friends, and keep your eyes open, and keep 
– make sure the rest of the group is supporting you. 
 
Igor: 
It’s all easy stuff.  And bear in mind, for people walking by, they 
have no idea that the group you’re with is your group, right?  As far 
as they’re concerned, you’re just hypnotizing members of the 
public.  And then, that’s how the whole thing works out.   
 
 
Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty of how to approach a 
complete stranger, and get them interested in hypnosis, and so on, 
I’d like to leave one simple idea inside your mind, which – if 
anything that you do today seems to go against that idea – then, 
stop it.  It’s not worth doing.  Does that make sense?  The idea is 
this: You don’t want anything from anyone; you just want to share 
something with them.  You want something for them.  Do you see 
what I mean by this?  And this is very important because that is the 
one key attitude that will send people running, like, a mile.  For 
example, if you say to someone, “We’re going to do some hypnosis 
now,” do I want something from him or I do want something for 
him?  Which do you think? 
 
Audience Member: From. 
 
Igor: 
From.  You can feel that, right?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Has anyone here ever asked a stranger the time?  Please, put your 
hands up if you have.  Has anyone here ever asked a stranger for 
directions?  Please, put your hands up if you have.  Notice there is 
an emotional undertone when you’re asking for the time or 
directions, which, basically, is along the lines of if they say, “I 
haven’t got the time,” it’s not a big deal.  You’ll walk away, right?  If 
they don’t want to give you the time, they’ll go, “Oh, okay, that’s a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
90 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
bit weird,” but you’ll still walk away, right?  You don’t want 
anything from them. You don’t need any reaction from them.  Does 
that make sense?   
 
 
So, when you’re approaching other people, you want to have this 
same, casual, relaxed, but polite atmosphere/attitude that you 
have when you’re saying to someone, “Do you have the time, 
please?”  Right?  It’s exactly the same.  If, at any point, you find 
yourself going, “Do you have – have – the time?  You have the time!  
Come to me.  Give me your time machine,” right?  At that point, 
you’ve switched over into a different gear and people can feel that.  
They can experience that and that’s what makes people walk away 
from you.  Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
 
So, just have a good time.  Have fun with it.  And if you find yourself 
tipping over into, like, the trying too hard or anything like that, just 
ease back.  And if you need, by the way, you just go up and ask a 
few people the time until you get a sense of, like, “Okay, this is 
what I feel like when I ask for the time.  This is what I feel like when 
I ask if they want to do hypnosis.”  And you get that switching effect 
going on.  Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
 
This is very, very important.  Also, when you’re doing your groups 
and you’re going to wave people over, it still feels like someone 
might be – has anyone here ever talked to, like, a sleazy salesperson 
– someone you know wants to sell you something, but they’re 
trying some little ploy like, “No, it’s free.  Look.  It’s free.  It’s – 
honest, it’s free.  It’s free”? 
 
Audience Member: Uh-huh. 
 
Igor: 
What is the thought that goes through your mind when that 
happens? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, right. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
91 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
“Yeah, right.”  That’s about it, right?  It’s like, “Okay, what’s the 
catch?”  That’s the same kind of thoughts that you’ve had in a shop 
or in some other place where you’ve been approached in the wrong 
way.  Those are the same thoughts members of the public will have 
if they are approached in the wrong way.  So, you’ve gotta take care 
of that and you can talk a lot about what we say, and what we do, 
and all the rest of it.  But ultimately, it comes down to one thing: 
that’s your attitude.  What are the emotional vibes, shall we say, 
that you’re projecting?  Is it as casual as, “What time is it?”  Or is it 
like you need something, you want something from them?  Does 
that make sense? 
 
 
And that means, for example, like when you are doing your little 
group and you say, “Hey, guys.  Come on.  Watch this and have 
some fun with this,” And they say, no. “Fine.”  Instead of saying, 
“Hey!  Do you want to try some hypnosis now?”  Do you see how 
I’ve switched gears?  Can you feel that?  Let’s do a little role play 
with this.  Is that okay with you guys? 
 
Audience Member: Um-hum. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s say I’m one of you guys working over here.  I’m just going to 
try – I’m going to be the crowd controller to bring people in to build 
this crowd up a little bit, right?  And say I just walked by and say, 
“Hey, this is kind of interesting.  Is that – are you enjoying this?” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, I’ve never seen it before. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, that’s fine.  Hey, you want to try some hypnosis now?   
 
 
What just happened?  Do you see how I pushed too much?  I 
pushed too soon, as opposed to just having a normal chat, like, 
“Yeah, it’s kind of cool.  We’re hypnotists here in town at the 
moment.  We’re doing a convention here.  So, we’re performing for 
free and stuff like that.  So, go ahead, just enjoy yourself.”

Now, which of the two do you think is going to make it more likely 
that he’s going to stay?  Right?  The second one, right?  And then, 
you build that relationship.  As they get more curious about it, you 
might talk a little bit like, “Do you see what he’s doing over there?  
Well, basically, what he’s doing is he’s opening up the unconscious 
so they can have a wonderful experience.  See the smile on their 
face.  Isn’t that something?  That’s why I love hypnosis.”   
 
Have I asked them to do anything yet?  Is he on the spot in any way 
yet?  Do you see what we’re doing with this?  So, that key attitude, 
you don’t want anything from someone.  You’re just offering them 
things.  You want something for them.  If you can maintain that, the 
whole thing will be easy.  If you miss that, no matter how 
sophisticated the language patterns, or the framework you present, 
or the idea you give them, or the intriguing little gimmicks you do, 
people are people and they’ll respond to the emotional undertones 
before anything else.  Does that make sense? 
 
 
So, have I emphasized this point enough? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Can everyone just turn to your neighbor and ask them for the time, 
please?  So, that is the attitude that I want you to keep in the back 
of your mind. 
 
 
Now, we’re going to talk about, specifically, approaching a group of 
strangers and what are some of the easiest ways of presenting this 
so that people go, “Of course.  This is a great thing to do.  I would 
like to partake in this whole experiment”?  Do you want to run 
through a little bit of the stuff that you do now? 
 
Anthony: 
I mean, I’ll start by saying this – it’s not a natural thing for me to do.  
I’m not naturally the person demanding attention, you know, at the 
center of a party and that kind of stuff.  So, I’ve had to work on it.  
Some of the things I’m going to say, we’ve stolen from magicians 
and walk-around magicians; like some of the guys at the back.

Some of the things come from people on the street.  You give out 
leaflets, and these signatures, and subscriptions – charity muggers, 
or chuggers, as we sometimes call them.  They’re one of our 
favorite targets.  And some of it comes from people who specialize 
in meeting people, chatting up women, and generally having a 
richer life.  So, we’re going to talk about some of those ideas.   
 
 
The first thing I’ll get you to be aware of is – and we’ve mentioned it 
a few times, but it’s just personal space.  So, even if it was a row of 
people, or a roundtable of people, a dozen people in the street, I’m 
still going to respect their space as a group and as individuals.  So, a 
few of the attempts outside resulted in the would-be hypnotist 
chasing someone up the street. 
 
Igor: 
“Come back!  Come back!” 
 
Anthony: 
They were saying, “No, no, come back!”  You know?  And it’s a little 
bit too late.  So, if people are sitting down, then I’d generally walk 
up to them kind of – not directly toward them like this, but I’d just 
walk up from the side.  I’ll normally have my arms out so I’m kind of 
open, I’m vulnerable, there’s nothing to hide.  And I just give people 
a compliment, okay?  So, the very thing I’ll do is I’ll just give people 
a compliment.  I’ll say, “That’s a nice shirt you’re wearing,” or, “You 
look like an interesting group of people; you look like an interesting 
guy.”  You know?  “That’s a nice eye patch,” you know?  It doesn’t 
matter.  We wouldn’t say that, actually, but – it’s lovely.  I’ll give a 
compliment and as long as it’s not – bear in mind, you’re not trying 
to pick up people out there, so you haven’t got any of that pressure 
of rejection and that kind of stuff.  So, I would just generally start by 
giving people a compliment.  I don’t want to have a discussion 
about the compliment.  I just want to give them a compliment, and 
they stop, and quite a few people aren’t used to hearing such 
things.   
 
 
So, you have a moment, and in that moment, I introduce myself 
and I just say, “Hi.  I’m Anthony.  I’m a hypnotist.”  Or, “I’m 
Anthony.  I’m performing here.  I’m a hypnotist.  Can I show you

something?”  And that says so much.  It says who I am.  It says that 
this is about fun and performance.  And again, even if I’m standing 
on a pavement somewhere, people just seem to accept it.  If you 
stick your neck out and say you’re performing, they tend to believe 
you.  If you say you’re a hypnotist, I find most people will just 
believe that you have expertise.  So, if they’re still listening at that 
point, and they’ve heard that, then saying, “Hypnosis” – putting it 
out there early on – will result in one of a few different responses, 
okay? 
 
 
One response is like, “No, no, no!  Not hypnosis!  No!”  Which is a 
great response; fear is as good as any other emotion and I’m going 
to raise their levels of emotion at this point.  So, if they’re like, “Oh, 
no!  Hypnosis – hypnosis – I saw it at college,” then obviously, “I’m 
not that kind of hypnotist,” or, “It’s not that kind of show.  I’m going 
to show you something.”  Then, I’m going to get into the same sort 
of language we had earlier about a gift.  If their reaction is kind of, 
“Oh, really?  I’ve never met a real hypnotist,” and its interest and 
fascination, then I’ll just hook them in that way.   
 
 
If they have any objection – well, we’ll come to that in a second, in 
fact, the main thing is just to put it out there and state it.  Then, I’ll 
follow that up with a question immediately.  “Do you want to play 
some mind games?  Can I show you something really cool?  Can I 
show you something interesting?  We’re running a convention here.  
We’re giving people free five-minute sessions of blah, blah, blah.” 
You know, I will say anything I need to say to get that person to stay 
rooted to the spot. Okay?  So, shorthand for that is compliment, gift 
and introduction, and ask a question. Okay?   
 
The compliment could be anything as long as it’s not going to be 
offensive.  The introduction should state who you are, what you do, 
and why you’re there.  “I’m Anthony.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m 
performing here.”  The question should be open enough that it 
basically elicits a response, okay?  I don’t mean that in any fancy 
NLP sense of the word.  I just mean they have to respond to it and it 
will either be interest, curiosity, complete fascination, or even if it’s

wariness, I don’t take that as a, “No.”  A “No” is, “No.  I don’t want 
to be hypnotized.  I’m walking away.”  Somebody saying, “Oh, no, 
you’re scary.”  That’s not a “No” as far as I’m concerned.  So, I’m 
going to still try, and ease the pressure, and get rid of their 
misconceptions. 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s do a quick exercise on that if you guys want.  Everyone just 
stand up and put your books down.  So, we’ll come to you in a 
second, Cassie.  What I want you guys to do is just walk around.  
And remember early on you introduced yourself as the greatest 
hypnotist, or an amazing hypnotist, and so on?  I’d like to just get 
you to walk around, make eye contact with someone, and then, 
approach them in a really casual, relaxed manner, and do those 
three things.   
 
Like, “Hey, you look like an interesting person.” 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve just noticed we’ve got very similar suits. 
 
Igor: 
I know.  It’s amazing, isn’t it?  That’s why I had to come over and 
talk to you.  My name is Igor.  I’m performing here today.  I’m a 
hypnotist. 
 
Anthony: 
All right. 
 
Igor: 
And you just look like a, you know, a kind of person who has an 
open mind about experiences.  Would I be right in thinking that? 
 
Anthony: 
Well, I’d like to think so. 
 
Igor: 
So, you see all three things done very casually.  There’s no real 
energy of like, “I want something,” or, “I need something.”  It’s just 
very relaxed and so on.  Make sense?  So, I want you to go walking 
around and meet as many different people.  Let them introduce 
themselves to you.  Then, move on, and introduce yourself to 
someone else.  It becomes a more natural someone is approached 
and someone is approaching.

Anthony: 
Yeah, I mean, if you’re leading this, then you’re going to initiate the 
handshake. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  If you’re leading this, you are the hypnotist and you are in 
charge of the interaction from start to finish.  If you find yourself 
being the subject all the time and people keep coming up to you 
and introducing themselves, you’re going to be like, “Wow, I’ve got 
all these hypnotists around.  That’s weird.”  Make sure that on the 
next interaction, you take control because it may just be that your 
initiative is too slow, and that might be one of the reasons that, on 
the streets, people are ignoring you just because you haven’t got 
the right energy level to come in in the first place.  So, this is a great 
way to find out.  Does that make sense? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  Off you go.   
 
So, we’ll carry on with this in a minute.  I just want to add 
something or emphasize something that Anthony was already 
talking about.  Please, when we talk about the compliment – you 
guys did a great job of this introduction.  Again, I see some very 
good intros.  When Anthony talks about having an open question, 
the question isn’t, “Do you want to do some hypnosis now?”  That 
is a very – a question that demands something of them, right?  By 
open question, we mean the kind of things like, “Did you know that 
people only use 10 percent of their mind?  Did you realize that your 
imagination is more powerful than your will?  Did you know that 
your mind controls your body more powerfully than your will 
does?”  Do you see where we’re going with this?  We’re throwing 
curiosity-type questions out there where people go, “Oh, wow, 
that’s interesting.” 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, even if it is kind of showmanship, it’s still sharing – still getting 
involved in that –

Igor: 
Right, so remember the whole watch phenomenon?  Every now and 
again, to set yourself, you go around.  Just ask them, “Do you know 
what the time is?”  “Oh, great, thank you.”  And then, you walk on, 
right?  Just every now and again, just throw one of those in, and if 
you feel a change in your own emotional state and something 
inside you, then you know that you’re switching gears between 
doing this and just asking for the time.  You don’t want that.  You 
want to have one be identical to the other.  If I am watching you, I 
should have no idea what you’re asking them – whether you’re 
asking for the time or you’re introducing yourself – unless I see you 
actually hanging around there longer.  Does that kind of make sense 
to you guys?   
 
 
So, just you guys throw some open questions at me of the kind of 
stuff that we’re talking about. Give me an example of the open 
questions you might ask. 
 
Audience Member: Do you know people actually have two minds? 
 
Igor: 
“Did you know people have two minds?”  Excellent. 
 
Audience Member: Did you know that if you can – once you get your unconscious mind 
on your side, you can actually move mountains? 
 
Igor: 
“Did you know you can move mountains with the unconscious mind 
on your side?”  Excellent.  What else? 
 
Audience Member: Did you know you can be amazing any time you want? 
 
Igor: 
“Did you know you can feel amazing any time you want?”  Right?  
Do you see where we’re going with this?  This is just some, like, 
simple, like, “Oh, tell me more” type things.  Make sense?  So, go 
around and exercise.  Carry on with it.  Every now and again, just 
ask for the time, and then, move on so that you check your own 
internal state.  And then, really just cycle through these three very

98 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
simple phases, very naturally into very casual conversation.  Okay, 
guys?  Off you go. 
 
 
All right, so, who enjoyed the exercise?  Just put your hands up.  Is 
it interesting? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah.   
 
Igor: 
What kind of things have you been picking up by not being the 
hypnotist doing this stuff, but by having someone approach you and 
doing this in different ways?  What kind of things have you noticed?  
Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: The compliment is essential. 
 
Igor: 
The compliment is essential.  Did you notice that?  If someone just 
comes up to you and says, “Hey, I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing 
here,” there’s a kind of a barrier that builds up.  I’ll come to you in a 
second.  Whereas, when you get a compliment, it’s, “Oh, yeah, I 
kind of like that.  Keep talking.”   
 
Audience Member: And especially here, people are so used to it, they expect it. 
 
Igor: 
Yes. In Vegas, do not do this kind of street hypnosis.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: Sincerity. 
 
Igor: 
Sincerity, yes. 
 
Audience Member: I was one of a couple of people that were just talking to you about 
it.  That’s not such a good thing. 
 
Igor: 
So, if you’re saying these things, just as random words, that has 
absolutely no point at all - remember, people respond to the 
emotional undertones first, and all the language and ideas second.  
Make sense?

Audience Member: Just to say you know on the –  
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, earlier when I said that you could give any compliment – you 
remember me saying that? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
It seems like hardly any time has passed, but earlier on, I said, “Any 
compliment.”  That doesn’t mean, “Say anything.”  It means find 
something that is genuinely beautiful, or interesting, or fascinating, 
or intriguing about that person.  And then, you’ll have some 
sincerity; otherwise, they’re just going to think, “Weirdo,” you 
know?  “Go away.”  So, be sincere. 
 
Igor: 
So, when we do the exercises again in a moment, something you 
guys can do to create more sincerity is before you talk to the 
person, just take a few moments just looking at them and see what 
catches your eye.  I got – I sensed the ring over there.  I said, “Hey, 
cool ring.  Look at that.  We match.”  Right?  It doesn’t matter what 
it is as long as you take time to absorb the person as they are, 
something will jump out at you, like, “Hey, cool suit.  We match.”   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, that’s right. 
 
Igor: 
Right?  The point is, when you say something, you’ll be saying it 
because you mean it, not because you’re saying something to say 
something.  Does that make sense to you guys?  All right?  What 
other kind of things did you guys notice happening as you were 
doing the exercise? 
 
Audience Member: Some people were very easy with their conversation – with what 
they said. 
 
Igor: 
So, some people are easier in their conversation. 
 
Audience Member: Others seemed to stumble a bit and –  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
100 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
– And others kind of stumble along a little bit – a little hesitant and 
so on. 
 
Audience Member: And the ones that stumble, you know, they’re nice, but –  
 
Igor: 
And then, the people that stumble – if I can paraphrase. 
 
Audience Member: Paraphrase. 
 
Igor: 
It makes you feel like, “Ah, that’s nice, but good-bye,” right?  So, I 
remember someone once saying that it’s kind of a nice – it’s a 
tongue-in-cheek comment, but confidence – I’m sorry - hypnosis is 
a confidence game.  No confidence, no game, right?  So, it’s not 
that you’re trying to take advantage of people, but you need to 
present it in a smooth, fluid style.  Otherwise, why will they believe 
that you are what you say you are?  Right?  There is no cultural 
stereotype of a hypnotist that is the world’s most nervous wreck.  
Like, “I – I – am – a really good hypnotist.  I – I – please, sit down.  
And – and – go into trance now – now.”  It does not exist.  It 
violates the blueprint that we have that we’ve been brought up 
with unconsciously.  Hence, they’re not going to believe you, are 
they?  Does that make sense to you guys?   
 
 
I’m sure that someone with a good performance skill could actually 
turn that into a whole performance skit and kind of a joke, but then, 
it’s still a little tongue-in-cheek and so on.  So, just present it in your 
own way and present it quietly if you need to, but truthfully and 
honestly.  So people will go, “Wow, you must be a hypnotist.  He’s 
so quiet and like a dark horse.”  Right?  It doesn’t matter what you 
do as long as you absolutely believe what you’re saying and you let 
it come out smoothly, right?  You were going to add something? 
 
Audience Member: I was just going to say I think that’s why this little formula works so 
well because you said they get a sincere compliment.   
 
Igor: 
Yeah, right. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
101 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: So, that’s flowing.  You’re introducing yourself.  I mean, you should 
pretty comfortable with doing that by now.  And, you know, the 
open question is, you know, what comes to mind.  “Where are you 
leading with this?” 
 
Igor: 
Right, yeah.  So, the idea of doing this – is this making a little bit 
more sense of why we have this very simple structure here?  Right?  
And you can refine the things inside of it, but it’s more important 
that you get the idea, and that you’re doing it with conviction.  
You’re better off doing something really bad with conviction and a 
genuine positive vibe, than something amazingly sophisticated with 
this undertone that says, “Do not trust me.  Run away and call the 
police.”  Does that make sense?  Go ahead. 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, I was just going to mention – one of the places we practice in is 
– it’s like a big beer garden.  You know, we go out, and we’ll have a 
drink, and that kind of stuff.  But if you’re walking up to a table 
with, you know, half a pint of Guinness in your hand, saying, “Hi, I’m 
performing here this evening,” it just falls apart as well.  So, it’s – 
you don’t have to wear a three-piece suit.   You don’t have to have 
a swinging watch. I’ve done this in jeans and T-shirt, and it works 
just fine.  But you have to mean what you’re saying and appear 
credible just because –  
 
Igor: 
– Present yourself. 
 
Anthony: 
– you’re confident in terms of what you’re saying and you know –  
 
Igor: 
– Now –  
 
Anthony: 
– you’ll get results.

Unconscious Rapport 
 
Igor: 
Now that we’ve said all of that, would you like to have a way of 
cheating to make it even easier to approach someone so that by the 
time you actually open your mouth, they’re already waiting to hear 
from you?  Would you like to have that?  It’s a little cheat. 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
This is something, which again, you’re going to think it’s a 
mechanical thing, and to some extent, it is, however, it’s driven by 
an emotional undertone, and if you don’t have the emotions, the 
mechanics will fall apart. It’ll just come across awkward, or sleazy, 
or anything like that.  Does that make sense? 
 
 
So, I’ll give you the mechanics first, and then, the emotional 
element second with the understanding that you have to do both; 
otherwise, it doesn’t quite work right.  Would that be fair? 
 
Audience Members: Um-hum. 
 
Igor: 
So, there is a little signal that human beings give each other all the 
time.  It’s something which is part of our, shall we say, primate 
ancestry.  If you look at primates, virtually all forms of primates do 
the same thing and it’s a little signal that tells other members of 
your species whether or not they are part of your group.  Now, as a 
hypnotist doing street hypnosis, do you think it would be a good 
idea or a bad idea to have other people think they’re part of your 
group?  Any ideas? 
 
Audience Members: Good idea. 
 
Igor: 
It’s a good idea, exactly.  Have you ever had the experience where 
you’re walking out somewhere, maybe you’re going out of the 
shops or out with some friends – whatever – and someone is on the 
other side of the road going like (waving) – and you’re going like –    

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
103 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
“Hi?  Do I know you?”  And then, of course, someone comes out of 
the door and you go like, “Oh, yeah, I was just scratching my 
armpit,” or something.  I don't know.  Anyone ever have that sort of 
experience? 
 
Audience Member: Oh, yeah. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
What happened to you at that point has nothing to do with the 
hand.  If I do this (waving hand), right, it’s just an odd person 
standing out there.  Even if I make contact with you – eye contact – 
can you notice there’s something flat about it?  Right?  Now, if I just 
change one thing – and those of you who’ve trained with me 
before, please, don’t say anything just yet.  But if I just change one 
thing, who feels a little bit more like, “Wow, this person, actually I 
might know this person”?  You start thinking in your memory banks, 
“What’s going on?”  Anyone here have more of a sense of that? 
 
Audience Member: You feel accepted. 
 
Igor: 
What is the difference between the two things I just did?  Clearly, 
it’s not the hand, right? 
 
Audience Member: The eyebrows? 
 
Igor: 
The eyebrows.  So, this is known as the eyebrow flash.  This is 
something we’ve had since the – I don't know – ‘50s or ‘60s.  It’s 
very – it’s weird.  It’s like about four people in the psychological 
community know about it and keep writing about it.  No one else 
seems to know, but it’s something that I’ve seen video footage that 
spanned – since videos – since filming began across all cultures.  As 
long as there are human beings, the eyebrow flash is basically a sign 
of acceptance.  The only place that I know of where you have to be 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
104 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
a little more careful is in Japan where it’s considered slightly sexual.  
In which case, you know, you might get lucky.  Or – but then, they – 
it’s not that they don’t do it; it’s that they suppress it because of 
cultural reasons, and even there, it’s acceptable to do with young 
children and with close friends. Okay?   
 
So, it’s a very natural signal and the eyebrow flash is not this. Do 
you see how that’s a mechanical mistake?  It doesn’t seem right, 
does it?  Right?  Nor is it this.  I can’t do machine gun flashes all 
across the room because that gets misconstrued somewhat as well, 
right? 
 
 
So, the key to the eyebrow flash is your emotional state.  Everyone 
in here, just think of someone that you really like – a friend – 
someone you’re close to. Could you do that? It could even be a pet.  
The key thing is, when you think of that person, you get this, like, 
“Ah, yeah.”  Everyone can think of that?  Put your hands up if you 
think of someone like that.  Now, as you’re thinking – this is going 
to be good for us in a minute.  As you’re thinking of that person, 
what I want you to do is just think of them.  Imagine that they’ve 
just walked in the room and without moving any part of your body 
– just with your face – just light up and welcome them.  Go ahead 
and do that.  Right?  That’s the eyebrow flash, folks.  Right?  But 
notice how the emotions make it natural, right?   
 
 
Some people describe it as the airport flash where people who 
haven’t seen each other for ages, they’re standing there, they’re 
waiting in their row, and suddenly, there’s a little row of eyebrows 
that go, “Ah!”  Okay, these guys belong together, like, kind of 
hooked up.   
 
 
So, what we’re going to do now is exactly the same exercise again.  
Only this time, I want you to make eye contact with someone 
across the room, and then, remember the feeling that you have 
when you – somebody you really like – maybe project on top of 
them, and then, just give them a quick, little eyebrow flash.  Let 
your whole face light up.  Maybe even smile.  And then, go over,

and shake their hand, and do your whole thing.  But now, you’re 
going to plant the seeds in fertile soil.  Does that make sense?  So, 
walk around, and for those of you who want to experiment, from 
time to time, don’t do it.  See how that happens.  See how that 
works.  Make sense?  Any questions?  Any questions?  All right, 
guys, off you go. 
 
 
 
Q & A Session 
 
Igor: 
So, before we continue onto the next part, how was that?  Did you 
guys enjoy it? 
 
Audience Member: Oh, yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Was that interesting? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah?  Let’s get a little bit of feedback.  This is the interactive 
portion.  Was that interesting, guys? 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so, what kind of things did you experience?  Let me just hand 
this out so you guys can actually be heard by everyone as well. We 
don’t have to repeat it.  So, do you have a question or a comment 
to make? 
 
Audience Member: My question –  
 
Igor: 
Do you want to take this? 
 
Audience Member: My question –

Igor: 
Yeah, it’s on.  It’s on.  It’s on. 
 
Audience Member: My question is how important is it to set the frame by telling the 
people that you are a hypnotist?   
 
Anthony: 
I just find it makes it easier.  It’s not vital.  So, it’s not that 
important.  We’re going to talk about frames – so, other ways of 
framing this other than say, “Hypnosis.”  You could say – we’ll get 
into it in detail about the various – we’ll give you four or five 
different frames. 
 
Igor: 
In fact, on Sunday, you’re going to see one of the assistants, who is  
a magician performer, who never tells people he’s a hypnotist, and 
whacks them in trance – does all kinds of crazy stuff – and no one 
knows.  Is it hypnosis?  Is it magic?  They have no idea.  So, it all 
depends on what is the expectation that’s inside someone’s mind at 
the time.  That’s the key thing.   
 
Anthony: 
You know you could present it as meditation.  You could present it 
as a relaxation exercise.  It doesn’t matter, but when you’re trying 
to raise excitement and perform with it, again, lots of us are here to 
give people personal experiences.  We don’t necessarily want to get 
60 people crowded round us on the street and feel that pressure.  
But, you know, an element of this is, obviously, about performance 
and being entertaining.  I just find it’s easier to get to that point if 
you say, “Hypnosis, hypnotist, hypnotism, hypnotized.”  Put the 
words out there early on.  It fires up their models of what might 
happen, and those models are normally massively stacked in our 
favor so that, you know, expectation, again, it’s not the key element 
of hypnosis, but I want to raise expectation.  If I say I’m a hypnotist, 
someone around that table is going to be thinking –  
 
Igor: 
Uh-oh. 
 
Anthony: 
– “It might be me,” you know?  That’s good enough.

Igor: 
Does that answer your question?  What other kind of comments or 
things do you have?  Do you want to come on up or do you want to 
pass this back to him? 
 
Audience Member: Thank you.   
 
Audience Member: Kind of a comment and question.  I thought that it was really 
difficult to do the open question knowing that it was an opener 
trying to get to the point of being able to do something else. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so what you described – did anyone else have that sort of 
experience?  Yeah?  What you’re describing is exactly what we were 
talking about before – the difference between wanting something 
for versus wanting something from someone.  If your mind is 
already two steps ahead where you want them to stand here and 
do something with them, what do you think the chances are that 
you’ll be leaking some kind of sub communication, some kind of 
message saying, “I want something from you”?  Right?   
 
 
If, however, you’re literally – if you’re actually happy – and this is 
something you can try if you want tonight when you go out.  If 
you’re happy to go up to someone and say, “Hey, I love your tie. It’s 
really cool.  Hi, my name is Igor.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing 
here tonight.  And have you heard about the power of the mind? 
How amazing it can be?” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, a little. 
 
Igor: 
“I know it’s pretty – it’s my world.  It’s really a pleasure meeting 
you.  Good-bye.”  If you can do that and really be okay with it, 
you’re just having a chat with someone and you’re walking off 
without doing anything, then you’re in the right mindset.  And then 
it doesn’t matter.  If you have that mindset, I can virtually 
guarantee that a conversation will turn, within minutes at most, to 
the point where you want it.  And there comes a time when then, 
you can start pushing for a little bit more because then, you’re 
relaxed and you’re feeling natural.  When you’re feeling relaxed and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
108 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
natural, say, you know, “You want to know something nice about 
the power of the mind?  I’m giving some free demos here. Just 
stand up and I’ll show you something really cool.”  Then, it becomes 
very congruent without demanding any of them.  Does that make 
sense? 
 
Anthony: 
At some point, you’ve still gotta put in that call to action. 
 
Igor: 
For sure. 
 
Anthony: 
You know?  And an open question: “Have you heard there’s two 
minds?”  “Yeah, do you mean –?”  You’ve still got to find a response 
to their response.  At some point, you’ve got to call them to action 
and what he just did there: “We’re giving some free demos.”  We’re 
giving this to you.  We’re – “Let me show you something really 
interesting,” you know?  “Have you ever wondered what it would 
feel like to completely relax – deeply relax?”  “Yeah, I have.” 
 
Igor: 
Think of it this way.  Does everyone here have at least one friend in 
their life?  Yes?  Just checking.  Now, let’s imagine you went to this 
crazy seminar about hypnosis and you came home so fired up about 
how amazing this thing is, you wanted to tell your friend about it.  
Would that be fair to say?  Right?  You want to share some ideas 
with someone.  Now, what if, within the first minute or two of 
telling them about it, you know, “This guy teaches us about 
hypnosis, and the power of the mind,” and so on?  You go, “You 
know what?  It’s so much easier if I just show you than you tell you 
about it.  Just stand up here.  Let me show you something.”  Now, 
would that be congruent with a conversation that you might have 
with your friends?  Yes? 
 
Audience Member: Yep. 
 
Igor: 
Would that be fair?  If you can do it with your friends, then the 
people in the streets are friends you haven’t met yet.  That’s the 
only difference.  Does that help you?  Does that help you guys?  So, 
the mindset is so important because if you get into the mindset of, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
109 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
like, “Now, I’m going to have to manipulate him into wanting to 
volunteer for this hypnosis thing,” you’ve lost before you’ve even 
started.  Does that make sense?  So, we need to get out of that 
mindset.  The mindset really is we’re offering; we’re sharing.  If he 
doesn’t want it, it’s no big deal.  We’re not going to push for it.  We 
will offer it, for sure, and we’ll offer it, you know – the irony is, the 
more experience you get, the sooner you’ll be able to cut to the 
chase and offer it because then, your emotional undertones will be 
very congruent with it and it won’t matter anymore.  Right?  You’ll 
be able to literally walk up to a person and say, “Hey, want to do 
some hypnosis?”  And they’ll go, “All right.”  But that’s because 
your undertones are so relaxed, so comfortable, so, “Yeah, this is 
trustworthy,” that that can work.  Until you get to that point 
though, you’ll need to do other things to allow your mind to be 
naturally, you know, calm, trustworthy, and so on.  Does that make 
sense to you guys? 
 
 
Go ahead.  Do you want to take this?  Do you just want to pass this 
back to – oh, here we go – to Cassandra over there?  In the red –  
 
Audience Member: It’s not that big of a question, but anyhow, just to check.  So, as long 
as we have the congruency, like, you know, within ourselves, it 
doesn’t matter if, say, we do the compliment, or if we just do a 
conversation opener.  Like, “Hey, are you enjoying Las Vegas?” for 
example. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
Right, it doesn’t matter. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
Because if you’ve got the congruency, then you can already walk up 
to people –  
 
Audience Member: Oh. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
110 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
– and make this happen.  If you can – it may not have occurred to 
you that the vast majority of people out there don’t know how to 
do this, and they stand there looking at people thinking, “Are they 
going to talk to me?” 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
“Will I look weird?  Will this happen?” 
 
Audience Member: Um-hum. 
 
Anthony: 
Or they’re too – And it’s too late, but that’s the situation most 
people are in.  So, there aren’t, as Igor has already said, anything 
that we’re teaching you – none of it is essential.  None of it is an 
essential piece.  You can just, as Marcus does, not mention it all and 
just get into the phenomena.  You can give people a five-minute 
lecture about it and there’s not a lot of point because it will become 
a conversation.  The main thing is just to put the idea out there.  Be 
friendly.  Be open, and giving, and you know, three-quarters of the 
people you approach will show interest. 
 
Audience Member: So, we can just focus on the congruency? 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
I have a friend of mine who lives in London.  He’s a charisma coach.  
He just takes people out and shows them how to have a great time.  
And one of his pet likes, I think – I guess you can call it – is he’ll walk 
down the street – this is London, which is a very, shall we say – 
people call it an unfriendly city because people are very kind of 
closed off in their own little world.  He – I don’t know how he does 
this, but he walks down the road and just goes, “Hey, guys!” 
 
Anthony: 
“Huh, hi!” 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
111 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Eyebrow flashes everyone.  Everyone is waving at him.  They have 
no idea who he is, but they like him, right?  With that kind of 
relaxed person, he could just go, “Hi, hi, hi.  Hey, how’s it going?  
Hey, look at this.  Look inside your hand, and sleep, and –” and 
people will go, “Wow, that’s amazing.  Where do you learn that?”  
But then, he’s so congruent with it.  He’s so natural with it.  He’s so, 
shall we say, innocent with it.  He actually has this really cool kind of 
innocent vibe to him.  He can get away with it.  All this is here to do 
is to put you in a position where, believe it or not, it’s about you 
being comfortable and you being in a mindset that allows you to 
sub communicate that this is all natural and this is all okay.  Make 
sense?   
 
 
So, really, it’s that mindset.  I happen to think this is really a little 
piece of genius.  I think it’s an excellent set of frames to present, 
but please, don’t eat the bathwater with the baby or however the 
metaphor goes.  This is driven by the emotional state and you can 
mess this up just as easy as anything else if you focus on the 
language and not on the context that you’re creating, right?   
 
 
Let me just pass this down here.   
 
Audience Member: I went through a divorce many years ago now, before I met my 
lovely wife. 
 
Igor: 
Yay. 
 
Audience Member: And I couldn’t come – approach anybody.  And I found a little book 
that basically talked about if you can talk to somebody for more 
than five minutes you’re – you can become their friend.  I made it 
my goal to see how many people I could talk to for more than five 
minutes. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: You know, I’d go in a group and I’d just – if that one didn’t, I went to 
the next one.

112 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: And it’s that sort of attitude – how many people can I put the call to 
and whether they take it or not? 
 
Igor: 
Right, yeah. 
 
Audience Member: And –  
 
Igor: 
And then, you see what happens is you suddenly get perspective, 
right?  It’s no big deal.  If you mess it up in front of one person – I 
mean, I know you’ve never messed up any hypnotic induction ever 
at all, but for the rest of us, it’s never a big deal is it?  You just walk 
up and go, “Oh.  Oh, well.” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, “Next?” 
 
Igor: 
“Next?”  It really – it is not a big deal.  Your egos aren’t wrapped up 
in it.  And let’s put it this way: Let’s say you approach 2,000 people 
and you hypnotize 1,800 of them, but 200 of them were abject 
failures.   Would that be okay with you? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
1,800 people are having vivid hallucinations.  They’re probably still 
stuck to the railing you left them on.  But 200 people are going like, 
“I don't know.  I couldn’t feel a thing.”  Right?  So what?  The point 
is you now have numbers in your favor, but you wouldn’t get to 
those numbers unless you were willing to go through those 
numbers.  The irony is, the further you get along that number of 
2,000, the 200 that it didn’t quite work out with, weirdly enough, 
seem to be the first few people you meet.  So, you might as well get 
them out of the way first and quickly, right? 
 
 
So, unless there’s any other questions or comments? Good.

Street Hypnosis Demo 
 
Igor: 
We’re going to take this a little step further now, and see if we can 
elaborate the little set piece we had before lunch break, and build 
that up into a whole street hypnosis routine that you can take out 
tonight.  Now, whether you do it in your little groups and bring 
people in indirectly, or whether you have, you know, the guts to go 
up to some complete stranger and eyebrow flash them, be friendly, 
talk to them, and all the rest of it, that’s really up to you. That’s a 
question of style and personal choice.  But we’d like to give you – 
prepare you for – a complete cycle of street hypnosis so that you 
can feel like you’ve done a real piece of performance.  Would you 
like that, guys? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So, do you want to take them through the –? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, let’s pick a subject – a girl this time.  That would be just fine.   
 
Igor: 
Come on up.  Give her a nice round of applause. 
 
Anthony: 
Hey, how you doing? 
 
Audience Member: Doing well, thanks. 
 
Anthony: 
Good, I’m Anthony.   
 
Audience Member: Hi. 
 
Anthony: 
You look a little nervous. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah?

Audience Member: Sorry. 
 
Anthony: 
Take a seat.  Are you happy to be hypnotized? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Are you sure?  Quick demonstration? Okay?  In fact, just turn your 
seat round a little, if you would.  That’s right – just like that. 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
Yep, perfect.  How do I say your name? 
 
Audience Member: Kristen. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s a beautiful name, by the way. 
 
Audience Member: Thank you. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, are you left-handed or right-handed? 
 
Audience Member: Right. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, let me just show you something, okay? 
 
Audience Member: Um-hum. 
 
Anthony: 
Just put your hand up here – right up here.  Look at the lines on it.  
Look at one spot.  Now, it’s going to move towards your face.  As it 
does, your eyes will begin to change focus, and then, you can just 
close your eyes, and sleep now, and relax – deeper sleep.  You’re 
good at this.  Just let go of every muscle, every nerve and fiber.  
This arm can relax completely.  Relax.  This arm can just let go.  You 
will not fall off the chair.  It’s as if you got a seatbelt on.  You’re 
completely safe, well, and protected.  You have a super powerful 
mind that is working for you.  Just go deeper and deeper down 
now.

Now, I’m going to count to five, and then, I’m going to do what I 
was supposed to be doing: 1, feeling wonderful; 2, drifting right 
back up; 3, feeling fantastic; 4, energized; 5, feeling great about 
hypnosis, okay.   
 
Audience Member: Woo! 
 
Anthony: 
That’s just not what I was supposed to do. 
 
Audience Member: That was exciting.  I liked that. 
 
Anthony: 
Everyone – we’ll start again.  Okay, do you want to put your shoe 
on or lose the other one?  Okay, Kristen, how are you doing?  Are 
you happy to be hypnotized? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Cool.  I’m just going to take you through a few really simple 
exercises. 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ll ask you to concentrate.  I don’t want you to pretend.  I’ll ask you 
to imagine stuff.  There’s no need to fight it.  So, you know, use 
imagery – ideas going through your mind.  I’m sure you’ll find this 
easy to do.   
 
Okay, let’s start with just an exercise in concentration.  Put your 
hands out in front of you like this.  Clasp them together really tight, 
palms together.  Really tight as you can – bend your elbows like 
you’re making a desperate prayer.  This is where most people make 
one.  Put your first fingers up about an inch apart – just like that.  
Look at the gap between your fingers.  In a moment, they will touch 
like they are two magnets being pulled together.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
116 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
All right, you can allow your eyes to close and just relax.  Don’t go 
to sleep just yet.  Just let your hands drift down.  Now, I’m going to 
separate your hands and your eyes open.  Good, that shows me you 
can concentrate.  We’ll do a very similar thing.  I’ll ask you to place 
both hands out like this.  I’ll just show you first.  I know you’re keen.  
All right, I’ve put both hands out.  You’re going to imagine there’s a 
huge magnet here and a huge magnet here pulling your hands 
together.  Again, don’t act.  Don’t pretend.  Just concentrate and 
you’ll actually feel this energy. Okay?  So, place your hands out in 
front of you.  Just like this, imagine a huge magnet here and one 
here.  Look directly at the gap between your hands – not on me, not 
anywhere else.  Get a clear picture of them stuck out there.  Now, 
close your eyes.  With your eyes close, imagine that real or 
imagined force is getting stronger, and stronger, and stronger.  
With each move of your hands, closer and closer together, stronger 
and stronger.  When they touch, again, you can just drift down into 
a relaxed state.  That’s right – deeper, deeper down.  Let this hand 
relax.  Let this hand relax.  You’re doing wonderfully. 
 
 
Now, I’m going to say the words, “1, 2, wide awake.”  When I do, 
your eyes will open and you’ll be ready to be hypnotized.  Nod your 
head when you understand.  That’s right – 1, 2, wide awake.  
Excellent.  Are you left-handed or right-handed?   
 
Audience Member: Right-handed. 
 
Anthony: 
Cool.  Can I just borrow your hand?  Look right up here. 
 
Audience Member: Um-hum. 
 
Anthony: 
Look at the lines on it.  Look at one spot.  As this moves towards 
your face, your eyes are going to begin to change focus.  As you 
become aware of your eyes, you can just close your eyes, and sleep 
now, and relax deeper down.  You won’t fall off the chair.  You’ll 
find a comfortable position.  You’re safe.  You’re well.  You’re 
protected.  Nothing can harm you now and nothing can bother you.  
You have a super powerful mind, and it’s working for you, and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
117 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
you’re going to enjoy this experience.  You can just let go for a time.  
No outside sound is important to you now – just the sound of my 
voice and your imagination.  Now, I’m going to count to five, all the 
way down to zero.  With each number I go past; you’re going to 
become twice as deeply relaxed.  Again, you won’t fall off the chair.  
You’ll remain sitting where you are, twice as deeply hypnotized, and 
you’re going to drift toward this imaginary zero in your mind.  It’s 
like a target. 
 
 
On the other side of that zero, is a profound state of hypnosis you 
have never experienced before.  So, picture that in your mind – that 
zero in the distance.  When you can see it, just nod your head.  
Then, begin drifting right through space, out of your body now.  Just 
as a mind – 5, deeper relaxed; 4, closer and closer to that zero; 3, 
getting more excited about drifting into that profound state of 
hypnosis; 2, deeper and deeper down now; 1, see it like a giant zero 
– like, a doorway.  You’re just going to drift right through.  And zero 
– deeper sleep now, deeper sleep.  You’re doing wonderfully.   
 
 
Now, in a moment, I’m going to touch the back of your left hand.  
I’ll touch the back of your hand.  It will begin to lift up off your leg 
up towards your head all by itself.  You have a complete sense of 
involuntariness about that.  You can imagine it happening all by 
itself.  So, I’ll touch this hand.  Again, you’ll feel it starting to lift up 
very slowly.  It will just drift up on a cushion of air towards your 
head like your head is a magnet, and your hand is a magnet.  You’ll 
enjoy the sense of well-being.  When it touches your head, it will 
start to seem funny.  Right away, it will start to seem funny and that 
laughter is starting to grow.  It’s going to get funnier and funnier, 
genuinely, like, when you crack up laughing.  You try and tell a 
story, you can’t even tell it it’s so funny; that’s how it’s going to be 
and there’s nothing you can do about it.  You’re going to laugh out 
loud.  Next time I click my fingers, your laugh as inappropriately as 
you possibly can.  That’s right – as inappropriately as you possibly 
can.  You’re going to laugh like a pig.   
 
Audience Member: Uh-oh. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
118 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony: 
It’s terrible.  I’ll tell you what – I’ll click my fingers again.  You’ll stop 
laughing like a pig.  You’re going to laugh like an evil demon with an 
evil cackle.  That’s how you’re going to laugh.  That’s right.  You are 
an evil demon.  I’ll click them again.  You’ll laugh like the laughing 
policeman.  There’s nothing you can do about it.  That’s right.  
That’s exactly how you’re going to laugh.  The funniest thing of all is 
you try and pull your hand off, you’ll find it stuck.  You’ll find it’s 
glued there and even that’s going to seem funny to you.  Put some 
effort and try and unstick it.  You’ll find you cannot.  The more 
effort you put in, the more difficult it’s going to become.  I know it’s 
a very strange feeling, but it’s – you can even open your eyes and 
look at it, it will remain stuck.  Is that your hand?  Is it your hand? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Are you sure?  How long have you known you can move your hand? 
 
Audience Member: What do you mean by that? 
 
Anthony: 
How long have you been able to move your own arm? 
 
Audience Member: I believe since I was born. 
 
Anthony: 
Really?  So, can – is that stuck to your head now? 
 
Audience Member: Yes, it seems to be.   
 
Anthony: 
It seems to be stuck.  Okay, I’ll tell you what, just place your other 
hand onto the table and look at the back of it.  Do you think you can 
lift that hand? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Try and lift it.  Strange, isn’t it?  Now, I’ll tell you what: If I was to 
offer you, like, I don't know, $100.00, do you think you could touch 
it? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
119 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Audience Member: Touch what? 
 
Anthony: 
Do you think you could take hold of it?  For a $100.00?  Man, I could 
get it for $10.00.  Seriously? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
You think you can touch it?  Yeah?  Try and pull your hand off your 
head.  But imagining – that’s impossible – imagining you’ve got a 
complete sense of involuntariness about it.  That’s right.  Put some 
real effort.  I know.  I can see you moving your fingers.  If you – its 
close, but it’s not quite close enough.  I’ll tell you what: I’ll bring it a 
little bit closer.  If you touch it, you can have it.  Sleep now. Deeper 
– relax.  Deeper – relax.  Deeper – relax.  Letting go, sinking, 
floating, drifting down to sleep.  And you can take all this on board.  
You can take a great amount of learning from your experience up 
here because in a moment, you’re going to wake up absolutely 
refreshed, absolutely alive, feeling fantastic – in the perfect state 
for absorbing new information and new ideas.  You’re going to find 
when you go out later on this evening, when you’re practicing in 
here doing the day, you’ll do this with a wonderful air of 
confidence.  You’ll just be your best self.  You’ll be on top form, free 
of inhibitions – well, you can have some inhibitions – appropriate 
inhibitions.  But you can be free of any doubts, free of any cares, 
free of any inhibition.   
 
 
 
So, I’ll count to five, on five, you’ll wake up, it’ll be like a rush of 
adrenaline going through your system.  You’re going to be feeling 
fantastic like a superstar.  So, 1, feeling wonderful; 2, feeling a surge 
of energy pour in through your toes, fingers, up arms, legs, spine, 
neck to the top of your head; 3, take a deep breath in, fill your 
chest, energy-giving oxygen going through your system; 4, your 
head washed through with cold spring water; and just 5, eyes open 
and wide awake.  Thank you, Kristen. 
 
Audience Member: Thank you.

Anthony: 
Very good.  Let’s just talk about a couple of extra things we’ve done 
because I’ve done the same thing a couple of times and that’s 
because I don’t like to work too hard.  I genuinely do the same sort 
of openers nearly every time.  And where I go after that point, is 
going to be dictated by where I am, and who I’m performing for, 
and you know, what is acceptable or what research you’re doing, 
which obviously, opens up any door.   
 
 
So, the way I sort of rack up through the phenomena is, first of all, 
to think of physical analog phenomena.  So, the first phenomena I 
went for was arm levitation.  Now, clearly, she’s a capable subject.  
Sometimes, you’re going to work – have to work a hell of a lot 
harder than that to get someone’s hand up to their head, but I 
know I could spend three or four minutes, quite comfortably, 
talking someone’s hand up to their head by pacing what’s 
happening and by encouraging it.  But let’s just say that that’s really 
first suggestion.  After sleep, I did a bit of deepening there.  It’s not 
massively sophisticated or complicated.  It was a count from five to 
zero.  I just asked her to sort of dissociate from her body a little, but 
that works very well; just as well as saying, “Deeper, and deeper, 
and deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper.”   
 
 
And then, that was really my first – another little soft test was when 
I said, “You go for that zero into profound hypnosis now.”  There 
was a nice, clear indication that she had gone into a what she 
believed to be a deeper level of hypnosis or state.  She gave in a 
little bit more of her neck, and her shoulders, and that kind of stuff.  
So, again, that’s not always going to be apparent, but that’s another 
good sign like another green flag or green light.   
 
 
And just to get you used to kind of giving suggestions now, I find it 
is so much easier if you give the person a little bit of time to process 
that idea that you’re presenting.  So, I’ll say, “In a moment, I’m 
going to touch the back of your hand and it will begin to lift up.”  It’s 
just like this really.  I nearly always state – Don’t hit your wife in the 
back of the head right now.

Audience Member: You saw that? 
 
Anthony: 
The camera.  I nearly always state what is going to happen, okay, to 
get the idea in their head.  “In a moment, I am going to touch the 
back of your hand and it will begin to lift up towards your head.”  I’ll 
then state it again, but normally, slightly more indirectly, and I’ll 
then give them some imagery or, you know, some metaphors.  So, 
“In a moment, I’ll touch your hand and it will begin to lift up.”  That 
would be direct.  “It will just drift upwards, all by itself, up towards 
your head as if it’s attached to 1,000 helium balloons, as if it’s 
pushed on a cushion of air, as if it’s filling up with helium.”  You 
know, it doesn’t really matter what the imagery is, as long as you 
can keep with it and keep describing it and if it’s something that 
you can increase like balloons, or more air, or more wires, or 
whatever, then that helps. 
 
 
As soon, again, you couldn’t really say this because she responds so 
well.  At some point, we’ll pull someone out who doesn’t, isn’t 
immediately as capable, but will walk up these steps and just 
become capable.  But if you’re seeing this – if I’m seeing, like, a tiny 
finger twitch or one finger twitching like this, then that’s as good as 
that to me.  I’m just going to use that.  “That’s right, your finger 
twitching all by itself, beginning to move.”   
 
 
So, while we don’t really get into theory too much in this training, 
and there’s no real need to, one theory that means a lot to me is 
you’re asking people to do things and you’re encouraging them to 
experience those things they’re doing as happenings, as 
experiences, okay?  So, quite a lot of the language I was using there, 
although I could have just said, “You can’t move it.  You can’t move 
it.  You can’t – you can,” was for your benefit.  So, I’ll say, “You can 
imagine it’s like this.  You can – as it drifts up, all by itself,” all of this 
language suggests this is just happening to you and I even 
encouraged her to have a complete sense of involuntariness about 
that act. Okay?  Does that make sense?  Yeah? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
122 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
That’s what we’re doing with our language, whether it’s direct or 
indirect.  We’re asking people to do stuff and change their 
perceptions of the experience.  So – sorry, let me just –  
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
– finish with the demo.  So, the hand starts lifting and I know when 
it’s – that’s my physical analog phenomena, meaning, any amount 
of levitation is going to be a win for me, okay? 
 
 
The next phenomena that I’m interested in getting out of someone 
is a change in their emotion.  So, as that hand lifts, again, I’m going 
to be slightly ambiguous with how I do this, but I’ll say, “As it lifts 
up, you’re going to enjoy a sense of well-being, an unusual sense of 
well-being.  In fact, this will start to seem funny to you.”  Now, if the 
person doesn’t laugh because I’m – we’re not at a place where I can 
get the emotional shift, it doesn’t really matter because funny can 
mean, “Yeah, it’s a bit weird. My hand is lifting.”  But if I get the 
tiniest little smile, then again, it’s like, excellent, here we go again.  
“That smile is going to grow.  It’s going to turn into a chuckle that’s 
going to turn into a laugh.”  And I’m always looking for moments 
when things happen: like the moment it hits her head, the moment 
it touches her lap, the moment, you know, it lifts off or whatever.   
 
 
So, we went for a physical analog phenomenon.  We went for 
emotional phenomena where she’s laughing, which is a feel-good.  
You could just do your gift at that point and just leave it be.  You 
don’t have to make people laugh like a pig, but as she does that 
naturally anyway, we had to go to laughing policeman, and 
something else.  But, you know, laughter is good, and I will normally 
take people through a few different laughs. That is a massive prover 
to people watching as well.  When you’ve really got the laughter 
rolling, then I went for physical binary phenomena.  I’ve now stuck 
her hand to her head.  Again, this is a stronger test.  This can fail, 
right?  But that’s not where my mind is at at that point.  It’s just – 
and as you laugh, their hand is sticking.  “You’re going to find this 
even funnier,” and I – she tested it, and that again, is the evidence 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
123 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
to you that she’s not just playing along at this point because she’s, 
you know, looking a little bit ridiculous trying to pull her hand off 
her head.  And just in case you don’t believe it, then put your 
money where your mouth is and see if it’s stuck.  If they get it, you 
can always bellow, “Sleep,” and just take it back anyway.  But –  
 
Igor: 
And you forget all about this. 
 
Anthony: 
But hopefully that makes sense in terms of that’s like a rapid scaling 
up through phenomena.  If you can do magnetic hands with people, 
and I’m sure, we haven’t practiced it yet, but I’m sure most of you 
have experience with that.  Then, you can do arm levitation.  It is 
the same thing.  It’s a bit like Igor was saying, “Catalepsy up here 
where you can’t move your hand is the same on the table.”  It is.  
It’s just the muscles are balanced and it gives the impression you 
can’t move.  That’s your perception of the experience, okay?  So –  
 
Igor: 
Somebody had a question here, and then, we’ll do some exercises. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, I was just – when you had –  
 
Anthony: 
Kristen. 
 
Audience Member: Kristen’s hand stick to the table, I didn’t hear you tell her that it was 
going to stick to the table. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s right.  We’ll talk about that on Day 3.  It’s called permanosis.   
 
Audience Member: Permanosis. 
 
Igor: 
There are ways of cheating.   
 
Anthony: 
That’s not cheating. It’s one of the greatest things ever.  No, that 
was the suggestion.  It’s very simple.  I said, “Put your hand on the 
table.”  I’m still very much being the hypnotist at this point.  “Look 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
124 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
at the back of your hand.”  And I’ll tell you what the suggestion was, 
“Do you think you can lift it up?” 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Think. 
 
Anthony: 
“Do you think you can lift it up?”  Why on earth would you not be 
able to lift your hand up?  So, I’m just giving a little bit of doubt.  I’m 
giving an idea that you won’t be able to lift it up, and yet, there’ll be 
nothing you can do about that.  That’s what that sense 
communicates.  But we’ve done that – Marcus did it to someone he 
hadn’t hypnotized at all earlier.  He just recognized him.  He said, 
“Yeah, Marcus, do you think you can lift your foot up?”  “Yeah.”  
Stuck to the floor instantly, no induction, okay?  So, it’s just another 
idea.  It’s just that that one kind of passes people by. 
 
Igor: 
By the time we go into Day 3, you will have enough experience to 
know how that worked.  And though you may not have, necessarily, 
the gumption to go out and do it straight away, there will come a 
point where you just recognize the moment and think like, “All 
right, why not?”  And it’s kind of very interesting the first time it 
happens.  But for the moment, just enjoy where you’re at now.  
We’re going to build skills bit-by-bit and we’re going to start 
building up to them.  Unless there’s anything else you wanted to 
add there? 
 
Anthony: 
I don't think so.  Just try and keep this – there are different ways of 
looking at the phenomena.  This, again, is not a rigid structure.  But 
if you look back through lots of the history, I mean, Igor wrote a 
brilliant book.  Part of it was about Estabrooks and you should all 
read Estabrooks’ stuff.  I didn’t read it.  I did hypnosis for 15 years 
before I read it.  When I read it, it was so in line with my book, 
Reality is Plastic, in terms of how he racks up through the 
phenomena, even the techniques you know are very, very similar.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
125 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
But that’s how I like to progress, and the reason I like to progress in 
this way – I know I was talking to you about this earlier – is that I 
know I can walk up to a group of people on the street, engage 
them, do magnetic fingers, and magnetic hands, and walk away, 
and I’ve done a demonstration that is entirely credible and have 
given people a bit of an experience, and a bit of a laugh.  Just 
because they weren’t dancing like chickens, does not mean I’m not 
a hypnotist or I’m leaving with egg on my face. 
 
 
So, that’s what actually gives me the comfort to do street hypnosis 
is that I know I can do this to enough people that I will find my 
stars, normally, pretty quickly, but eventually, I will find people who 
I can take further.  Because this is all about physical ideomotor 
phenomena, it’s just a basic fact of life.  You think something; your 
body seems to respond.  This, and this, and getting this finger 
moving and hand lifting, is exactly the same skill set.  So, this may 
look different and more dramatic, but it’s really more of the same, 
okay?  So again, I’m very, very comfortable operating at that 
physical analog level.  Yes, you’ve gotta stick your neck out at some 
point and stick someone to something.  It’s not – I’m not saying it’s 
like, particularly, high-brow, thoughtful routine, but it will be a 
prover to you as a hypnotist that now I’ve got them.  Now, I know 
this is not just a feel-good, playing along.  Now, they’re looking 
confused.  Now, they’re looking baffled and they’re stuck.   
 
 
So, that’s why I make that distinction between analog and binary.  
Binary just means they pass or they fail; they stick or they don’t.  
They remember or they don’t.  I didn’t really get into any mental 
phenomena, but the next thing I would have done with Kristen was 
go into – which we’re going to do, I think, tomorrow. 
 
Igor: 
Tomorrow. 
 
Anthony: 
But we’re going to get into amnesia, and hallucinations, and all that 
kind of stuff.  But that would be the next suggestion – “You can’t 
remember your name.”  Yep? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
126 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: Have you ever had the experience where you’ve tried to stick 
someone’s hand to the table and said, “Okay, you can’t lift it,” and 
they’ll take it off like a half an inch or – what do you consider that? 
 
Anthony: 
I – there’s different things that could be.  That could be them 
proving to you that they can.  In which case, you might need to 
work a bit harder at that point and say, “That’s right.  It just lifts a 
little.”  Put it back onto the table and hammer in the suggestions 
again.  Sometimes, when people do that, that’s as far as they can 
lift their hand.  That’s the point.  That you may have gone for it 
being heavy, rather than being stuck.  If you’ve gone for, “So heavy, 
so heavy, you can’t lift it,” and they really strain to lift it, then as far 
as I’m concerned, you’re still winning.  That, to me, is the equivalent 
of doing a stiff arm, and when you say, “It’s completely stiff and 
rigid,” and they bend that much, you say, “That’s right.  It bends a 
little and it springs straight back out again.”  If you catch that and 
give it another push, very often, you’ll snatch victory from the jaws 
of defeat.  So, sometimes –  
 
Audience Member: Sometimes they can take it a little from their head. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, people are still at the point where 
they want to please you and they want to have the experience.  
They don’t want this to fail either, you know?  Not just for you, but 
because they want – that’s what their friend did and they want to 
know if they’re capable.  But if it’s just that, you know, that’s pulling 
your hand off your head.  That’s lifting your hand up off the table.  I 
would just try and gauge it.  And some of the time, its worth 
pushing and trying even harder – twice as stuck, twice as heavy.  
Some of the time, that’s the point to bail and backtrack to an easier 
class of phenomena, which I will do.  That will be a nice out for me.  
Any other questions?   
 
Igor: 
Okay, guys.  So, I think what we’ll do is, we’re coming up to a break 
now, so we’ll take a break.  Then, we’ll come back, talk about a few 
things, and then, we’ll slowly build up to our actually doing all the 
stuff you’ve seen Anthony do today.  It’s actually very easy to do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
127 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
once you get the feel for it.  But my great acuity is telling me it’s 
time for a little break.  Have some drinks.  Have a little relaxation 
and so on.  Please, be back here in 15 minutes.  We’ll start back at 
4:00 on the dot.  So, if you’re not back, you might miss the one 
magic technique you need!  Off you go.

How to Set Up a Complete                             
Street Hypnosis Demonstration 
 
 
Keep it Safe 
 
Igor: 
What we thought we’d do now is, before we get into the nitty-gritty 
of doing or creating our set piece for the day, the things you’ll be 
doing tonight – and remember when we talk about set piece, we’re 
talking about a launch pad from which everything else comes, 
right?  So you don’t have to be stuck on it.  In fact, on Sunday when 
we do all the bonus stuff, Anthony here and  
some 
of 
the 
assistants will be showing you different ways of creating your own 
unique routines.  But at least you’ll have one that thing that you’ll 
have tried, you’ll have tested, you’ll have put through fire, you 
know is bulletproof. It’ll work for you any time you want, so it’s 
there for you.  Does that make sense?  
 
So before we go into the actual physical mechanics of all this, one 
thing which is very important to start talking about at this stage 
because you’re now getting into some pretty serious hypnotic 
territory, right, is the whole health and safety aspect of it.  There 
are – hypnosis is safe, and when you use hypnosis you can keep 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
128 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
people very safe.  But then there are also things you can do with it 
that can harm people.  You’ve all seen, shall we say, the 
stereotypical bad parent that tells their kids off and so much so that 
they end up having a really terrible life.   
 
So what kind of things do you think might possibly go wrong, like in 
the whole just look at street hypnosis in the big picture, even the 
extreme situations?  What kind of things could go wrong if you did 
hypnosis long enough?  Just let’s list some things out so we can 
start to think about how to deal with it and how to avoid them 
happening.  Any ideas? 
 
Audience Member: An abreaction. 
 
Igor: 
So an abreaction, right?  That’s the classic one, and we’ll talk about 
what abreactions are and how to handle them in good course.  Go 
ahead. 
 
Audience Member: Friends may become distractions. 
 
Igor: 
Friends becoming distractions.  So that in itself could be just a 
barrier to hypnosis.  How could that be a problem in terms of health 
and safety?  So I’m really now concerned only in terms of the health 
and safety of the people that you’re working with and yourself as a 
hypnotist so that you don’t do damage, you don’t get damaged.  
Make sense?  We’ll – go on. 
 
Audience Member:  They fall down. 
 
Igor: 
One second.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: They actually fall to the ground. 
 
Igor: 
Now we’ve got something there.  So falling, okay.  Cathy? 
 
Audience Member: Oh, he already said it. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
129 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Okay, he said it.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: I had someone who couldn’t stop laughing and laughing. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so we’ve got hysteria.  We’ll call it hysteria in general, shall 
we?  Laughter is just one form of it, right?  Was that the only thing 
over here?  Go ahead.   
 
Audience Member: Wild subjects.  Wild subjects.   
 
Igor: 
Wild subjects.  So what’s the problem with having a wild subject? 
 
Audience Member: I said violent subjects. 
 
Igor: 
Violent.  Oh, sorry.  There you go, violence.  All right.  What could 
cause a subject to get violent?  Any ideas? 
 
Audience Member: Fear, of course. 
 
Igor: 
So if you do something fear-based, they may – Some people attack 
into fear.  Some people retreat from fear, right?  Some may get 
violent by defending themselves.  It may be just like a – if you 
create a context in which they have to defend themselves, they 
might be violent.  It might be anger, right?  You might put them in a 
situation where anger can be there.  Those of you who have seen 
the Stage Hypnosis DVDs, one of the skits that Spence likes to do is 
the one where someone’s getting really angry with him every time 
he says the word “hypnosis.”  They’ll call him a fake and so on.  
Right?   
 
Now from sheer experience, he had to put in the following 
suggestion along the lines of, “You cannot stand up on the stage.  
You cannot touch the stage.  You cannot throw anything on the 
stage.  You cannot spit.  All you can do is express yourself verbally.”  
Now he’s basically cut out every other possible physical behavior 
because, at some point or other, it’s probably happened to him.  
Make sense?  So if you’re going to go – you’ve done more extreme 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
130 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
kind of suggestions, you got to make sure you take care of both the 
person you’re working with and yourself or anyone else around 
them.  Make sense?  What other things might go wrong? 
 
Audience Member: What about failure to emerge? 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  Let’s call that, and excuse the pun, emergency.  Emerge.  I 
know.  It’s late in the day.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: An epileptic or someone who’s on drugs. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, let’s call it drugs separately.  Epilepsy, I’ll talk about that – I’ll 
talk about epilepsy in a moment.  It’s not quite what people make 
out, but we will talk about specifically, absolutely.  Right?  Anything 
else?  Actually, I’ll add something to the epilepsy thing, which is 
really what most people think about, but it hasn’t to do with 
epilepsy, is accidentally triggering some kind of a fit, whether it’s an 
asthma attack or something like that.  Okay. 
 
Audience Member: Psychotic episodes.  I’ve had clients on some occasions who go into 
a very rapid eye movement because they’re having psychotic 
episodes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  Anything else?  
 
Audience Member: They run away while in trance. 
 
Igor: 
They run away once entranced, exactly, and you can’t emerge them 
safely and so on, right?  Anything else?  Anything else you want to 
add.  I think it’s a pretty good list for me. 
 
I know, oh my God.  This is so terrible.  Why did I come to this 
seminar?  Now of course, you do realize that we are having this list 
up here not to terrify the pants out of you.  It’s just to be aware of 
possibility and, more importantly, on how to prevent these things 
from happening.  Does that make sense?  It would be remiss of us 
not to talk about these things because then you’re just kind of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
131 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
dumped in the soup, and you have to work out as you go along, 
which is incidentally kind of what you and I have done.  It’s just kind 
of old school versus new school hypnosis.  Hopefully, your life will 
be a lot easier than ours.  Most of these things need never occur if 
you do your work right.  Here’s what I mean for that for example.  
Let’s look at; the classic ones are actually over here, the ones which 
are the most common things.  The most common things you might 
come across that if you were to put a percentage on this, this would 
take 99.9 percent of the whole pie: people falling down, people 
running away, and doing some kind of crazy activities.   
 
In other words, these are all failures to suggest.  Right?  This is 
when your own suggestions have become misinterpreted or over-
interpreted so that it’s gone way beyond the scope that you 
intended.  Right?  When you say to someone, for example, “In a 
moment, I’m going to say the word “pink.”  At the sound of the 
word “pink” you get really angry with me.  Right?  As far as you’re 
concerned, it’s just an emotional suggestion you’re giving, right?  Of 
course, if the person takes it as an emotional suggestion that 
actually runs with a physical behavior because there’s a pattern 
built in them, right?   
 
You trigged a physical behavior even though you weren’t aiming for 
it.  Does that kind of make sense?  So what is the most obvious way 
of assuring that these things don’t happen? 
 
Audience Member: Suggest them away. 
 
Igor: 
Suggest them away, exactly.  So there’s two sides of that coin, 
right?  The first side of the coin is: think a little bit ahead of time 
how do you phrase your suggestions so that they’re about as clear 
as they can get, right?  There is no hundred percent, right?  You 
phrase things as clearly as you can get, and people have made some 
bizarre association to it, right?  It’s going to happen.  So that’s more 
what version two will be about.  But really, most of these problems 
can be taken care of if you are clear and lucid and thoughtful about

what suggestions you present.  Does that make sense to you guys?  
Phillip. 
 
Audience Member: Would it be a good idea to give a suggestion that, up front, that if I 
say, “If I look at you and say relax” – 
 
Igor: 
Great.  So Phillip’s saying wouldn’t it be a great idea to have a 
suggestion up front which is kind of a coverall so that they basically 
ignore negatively phrased suggestions or suggestions that might be 
negative to them.  Absolutely, I would encourage you to do that 
and nothing is foolproof.   
 
Anthony: 
Let me start again.  I just run through these columns because some 
of these are things you could easily control with suggestions, some 
of these are things you can avoid by avoiding certain routines, and 
some of them are just a numerical statistical oddity that you would 
experience if you hypnotized thousands of people.  And I’ve 
experienced this “emergency.”  Some people call it a hypno-coma.  
Said “sleep,” and that was the last thing I heard for 40 minutes.  She 
didn’t respond to me or anybody else.  That was quite a scary 
situation to be in.   
 
But in 5,000 sessions of hypnosis in performance mode I’ve never 
had someone have an abreaction, ever.  The vast majority of 
hypnotists I speak to have not experienced it, right?  So the 
statistics are small with regard to the coma.  Gil Boyne gave a quote 
on that.  He was hypnotizing for 53 years.  He saw 12 cases of it.  
My father’s hypnotized 30,000 people.  He’s seen it twice.  It not – 
This is not going to happen every time you go out or anything like 
that.  However –  
 
Igor: 
Can I just make a point on the hypno-coma?  We’re getting a little 
bit ahead of what we’ll talk a little bit more maybe tomorrow.  But 
before you think, oh, my God, there some places that people don’t 
emerge, here’s the thing to remember; it may have taken 40 
minutes, but they came back on their own.  So the worst thing that 
can happen is that it just takes them a while to come back.  Now, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
133 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
the key thing here is, and this is what we’ll talk more about 
tomorrow, is if you’re in a hypnotherapy session you can afford to 
let them sit in the chair and just zone out for a couple of hours, 
right?  They will come back eventually.   
 
It’s just a question of time.  Whatever happens to me inside has to 
process through or whatever.  If it happens to you on a street, and 
remember this is a very, very, very rare phenomena, even rarer 
than everything else is on that list.  Then the main job, and this is 
what we’ll talk about tomorrow, will just may need to be crowd 
control, right?  It’s everyone else that will become concerned.  The 
person in that trance state is just like, “Wow, this is pretty cool.”  So 
it’s just a question – it’s just a function of time and your ability to 
manage the crowd long enough to let nature take its course.  Does 
that make sense?  And for all kind of emergency stuff, like this, in a 
moment once we finish with some of the other things, we’ll talk 
about how to escalate people through an awakening process if they 
happen to be a little bit reluctant. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, Igor’s got a great technique for dealing with abreactions, 
which again, I say I haven’t experienced one in performance.  I’ve 
created thousands of abreactions in the therapy room because 
that’s part of the way I do my therapy.  I’m thinking, “Yes,” when I 
have an abreaction.  I love it.  And now I’ve got hold of that thorn 
and I’m about to pull it out.  And I know it will go away.  They might 
be in pain in 30 seconds time.  So just to put this in to context, 
again, you can see some of these are based on suggestions.  The 
problems are going to come from negligence.   
 
The problems are going to come from you doing this too close to a 
curb: you doing this to someone whose boyfriend really doesn’t like 
their girlfriend being touched, you doing this to someone who just 
happens to have a model that hypnosis means relaxation and your 
body goes all floppy and you fall over, and you not standing next to 
them and being in control of that small possibility while not saying, 
“Sleep,” and “Stand.”  So again, there have been people who have 
been damaged in the middle of hypnosis act, but in the UK out of, I 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
134 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
think, 27 cases, 25 involved people falling off a stage, twisting their 
ankle, banging their head on the light, a rubbish chair that didn’t 
support them. It wasn’t they became psychotic because of a rogue 
suggestion about bananas.   
 
This is a situation for you to manage, but you do have to manage it.  
You are responsible for it.  So first off, the easiest thing you can do 
is get your framing of this early on: how this is going to be, how it’s 
going to happen, where they’re going to sit, and you dictate the 
area.  If you’re here and there happen to be ten wine glasses on the 
table, you don’t really want them facing the table.  It could be so 
much safer if they just face away from the table.  If you’re going to 
have them moving, have them open their eyes.   
 
If you’re going to make them angry, tell them they won’t be violent.  
If you’re going to tell them it will taste disgusting, tell them they 
won’t be sick.  You can rein this in, just with another couple of 
words and most of that stuff will be taken care of.  With regard to 
abreaction and the more emotional outpourings, avoid – 
 
Igor:  
 
We’ll cover that tomorrow. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, we’re coming on to that.  But it’s just a case of avoiding 
aggression and things that can obviously turn up some old 
memories. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s just look at these things, the general ones in the red circles for 
a moment; people running away, falling down, getting violent, 
having bad reactions to suggestions, so, do you all feel comfortable 
that with a little bit of thought you can basically avoid presenting 
suggestions that can be misunderstood in that way?  Would that be 
fair to say?  Yes? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Running away.  “You will not leave this area.  Should you need to 
leave the building, everything will be back to normal.”  Done. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Igor: 
Then the next step is if something does go wrong for whatever 
reason, let’s say you put all the safety belts in place, but they still 
misunderstood you, maybe they misheard you, right.  What would 
you do that that point?  Repeat or give a new suggestion to 
counteract whatever is going on.  So if the person hasn’t heard the 
thing about not being violent, you can go say, “Sleep and freeze.”  
Or, well, actually freeze might be like in cold but, “Sleep and stand.”  
Right?  Or, “You can’t move.  That’s right, the behavior is all gone.  
Fear or the emotion all gone.  You just can rest and comfortably 
drift through the whole thing.”  Make sense?   
 
So you look out for the physical space.  You don’t start doing instant 
inductions right at the edge of something like this.  Right?  That’s 
kind of asking for trouble.  You present your suggestions very 
clearly, with a mind to what might happen with extreme cases of 
people who experience this sort of thing.  And if something 
negative does start to happen, and this starts taking this idea of fits 
and stuff as well, you counteract it.  Let me give an example what 
we mean by this.  This is not from my own personal history; this is 
from a medical doctor that unfortunately hadn’t had the best 
hypnosis training.   
 
In one of his relaxation scripts with a patient, an asthma patient, for 
some reason he decided to bring him into a nice field full of flowers 
and hay and stuff like that because to the doctor, it was a very 
relaxing image.  What he didn’t quite put together, as those of you 
who chuckled have already done, it that the asthma was set off by 
things like pollen and especially grass pollen and all kinds of stuff 
like that.  So he just basically dumped him in the environment 
which stimulates the fit, in this case an asthma attack.  Right?  So 
can you imagine that being a less than positive event for the 
individual?  Right?   
 
Now luckily, the doctor was, shall we say, intelligent enough that 
when he saw the fit beginning, the asthma attack coming on, that 
he brought him out of the situation and had counteractive 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
136 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
suggestions to calm him down.  “Your breathing’s opening up, up 
into the clouds.  It’s clear.  The air is clear. Cool breeze.  You’re 
breathing deeply, breathing calmly.  It’s all gone now, you can be 
fantastic,” and so on.  So he’s basically created a new context which 
will cancel out whatever it is that was creating the problem.  Does 
that make sense?   
 
So it’s really an extension of these things here.  And this is really 
where the idea of epilepsy comes in.  We normally cover this more 
when we talk about hypnotherapy, but I’ll cover it briefly now.  
There is an old belief in hypnosis that you should not work with 
epileptics because you might trigger a fit.  That is incorrect.  The 
only way you will trigger a fit with an epileptic is if you hit upon one 
of the triggers that triggers the fit.   
 
For example, if they are photosensitive, in other words, there are 
certain rhythms of light, which is one of the most common forms of 
triggers for epilepsy, and you now put then, say, in a nightclub, and 
there’s a disco ball spinning around and those shining lights.  Right?  
You can see how the environment might simulate the brain the 
same way as a physical environment might.  Does that kind of make 
sense to you guys?  But it’s not just photosensitivity.  There might 
be other things.  Most epileptics will have sense of what kind of 
environments, what kind of triggers, set them off.   
 
So if you ever do work with an epileptic, it’s a good idea to get a 
medical referral anyway just to cover your own base, but really, just 
get a long list of the things that trigger them off and avoid them.  
It’s as simple as that.  If you happen to work with someone on the 
street who’s epileptic and they don’t tell you ahead of time because 
this is a performance thing, then again, as soon as any onset sign of 
something happens, any sign of something not being quite right, 
just shut down whatever it was and create a completely different 
environment in which those suggestions, the old suggestions, have 
been cancelled out.  And very often, well, not very often, really 
you’re suggesting away the problem.  It will fade away.  It’ll 
disappear.  Does that make sense to you guys?

Anthony: 
And in the UK, there is a law about hypnosis, and we’re not going to 
get into the details of that, but what came out of the law was just 
best ideas of best practice.  So when I’m on stage, I’ve got the 
luxury of time to sell this stuff, but you really should be saying this 
stuff if you’re working with a group on the street.  Just make it 
easier for yourself.  Don’t work with people who are under 18.  Do 
not work with people, people who are under 18. 
 
Igor: 
In most countries, it may even be an offense, a criminal offense.  It’s 
that whole consent issue. 
 
Anthony: 
Do not work with people under 18.  Do not work with people who 
are asthmatic, epileptic, heart problems, severe back problems, or 
pregnant.  Just spit it out.  You’re not really looking to be working 
with people who are on serious drugs because they’re psychotic.  
All right?  So be prepared to say it.  And again, it doesn’t have to be 
a ten-minute lecture that kills the mood of the hypnosis.  You can 
say, you’re out here, there’s loads of people out here, you can say, 
“Okay, first off, are you all 18?  I just want to make sure that – 
we’re going to do some stuff that you can all take part in, but you 
cannot come up here and take part in the main bit of hypnosis if 
you are this, this, this, or this.”   
 
And just reel it off.  And then you’ve said it.  And more than that, it 
shows that you care.  It shows that you know your business.  And 
the point about these things is that it will rapidly bring the fun to an 
end if that person has a fit or gets upset or even sheds a tear 
sometimes.  And no, I think it’s highly unlikely that you’re going to 
do any damage by suggesting something silly to someone if you 
control the environment, you don’t let them run, you don’t allow it 
to become confusion.  But even that, these are things that you 
should control.  And you can control most of it in your setup and 
your intro.  Once you’ve said it, it’s done.  It’s up to them if they 
want to take part.

Igor: 
So in a moment, you’re going to actually get an opportunity to 
actually practice this.  In other words, part of your introduction, 
somewhere in along the lines of when you start doing the finger 
magnets and so on, that’s relatively benign.  There’s not much you 
can do.  There’s not much that can go wrong there because it’s very 
open-ended.  But somewhere in that spiel, maybe between the 
suggestibility test or before you do the induction or somewhere 
inside the induction, you want to get all those things rattled out.  
Right?  You may even do it before you even start the suggestion 
thing. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, I’d suggest you do it before the induction.  They might – it 
might be too late. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  So just find – experiment with different places where you 
feel comfortable saying these things.  And as Anthony was saying, 
they can be quick one-liners.  You can even make a little joke out of 
it.  “I can’t work with you if you’re on drugs, whether the doctor 
gave them to you or someone else.”  Just, it just kind of clears up all 
your bases, and it avoids basically pretty much everything on this 
list here.  Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
I tell you – A good – 
 
Igor: 
Oh, and if someone’s pregnant, hopefully your visual acuity will kind 
of be able to tell. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, not always. You’ve had it today.   
 
The most obvious time for me to do this is once you’ve done your 
approach, and you’ve introduced yourself, and you’re essentially 
getting ready to go.  Can I show you something interesting, right?  
You will often get the questions that you want to just mow down 
straightaway.  The fears kind of get trapped in it; kind of get stuck in 
it.  They’re looking from some reassurance from an expert.  So be 
the expert at that point.  And tell them, it’s not this, and it’s not 
that.  But you can only take part if you’re this, this, this, or this.   Is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
139 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
that cool?  Good.  And then it’s done.  You’ve given a health and 
safety speaks.   
 
The other bits and pieces, the kind of reaffirmations that you’re 
safe and you’re well, that you’re protected, your unconscious is 
looking after you, just to make the person feel secure and, as you 
said, to kind of state early on that, look, I can’t give you a 
suggestion that will bring any harm to you because you’ve kind of 
suggested that you can’t.  But it’s worth saying but, more often 
than not, just keep an eye on the situation, and if for some reason, 
one of your instructions are misinterpreted or seems to upset the 
person enough – That can happen with amnesia.  You give someone 
name amnesia or total amnesia, I’ve had people burst into tears at 
that point because they’re bloody confused.  If you don’t want 
them confused, then tell them they’ll find it funny, and then they’ll 
just laugh at the fact they can’t remember their name.  You should 
be dictating their response.  And again, this is all material we’re 
going to get into in much more detail tomorrow. 
 
Igor: 
So when we come onto practicing this whole thing, here’s a – Do 
you want – I have a really simple way of remembering kind of how 
to do the hypnotic walling before you go into your show.  Right?  In 
my mind, the key idea I present is the idea of vulnerability.  Right?  
So I’m saying, “Look, if anyone here is in a particularly vulnerable 
group, I don’t want to work with you.  If you’re pregnant, underage, 
on drugs, or have some kind of clinical condition going on, then 
please let me know.  It’s not that I can’t work with you, it’s just, 
well, it’s not necessarily the setting to do this sort of work in.”  
Right?  So it’s really casual.   
 
It shows that you’re taking care of someone.  The word, or the idea 
of vulnerable, or it triggers people’s minds like, “Oh, hmm.  I have 
diabetes.  Does that make me vulnerable?”  Right?  And then you’d 
say, “Well, how serious is it?  Are you on heavy medication, in 
which case just sit this one out?  Or it just – is it – does it have a 
little shot in the arm every now and again and you’re fine.”  Right?  
So it just allows them to come back and ask you, “Well, am I okay 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
140 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
for this?”  Does that make sense?  So everyone clear on how to take 
care of these things ahead of time before they even arise? 
 
Audience Member: What about hysteria? 
 
Igor: 
So now the last question, thank you for reminding me on here, is 
the idea of hysteria.  What if someone – what if you trigger a 
laughing fit or something like that that the client couldn’t get out of 
and so on.  As a rule, hysteria is a form of hypnotic phenomenon.  
Right?  In other words, an unconscious response is taking over and 
they can’t consciously control it.  That’s essentially what you’re 
saying.  What you don’t want happening is that the hysteria runs 
out of control in the sense that you’re no longer part of that trance.  
If you’re the hypnotist, you can suggest the phenomena away.   
 
So the key thing is as soon as the subject starts responding with 
something that you have not suggested, you need to start slowing 
things down and redirecting it.  Right?  So, in other words, you will 
never have a full-blown hysteria because you’ll never have 
suggested that kind of laughter.  If they have – you’ve gotten 
uncontrollable bursts of laughter that are going on and on and on, 
it’s all fantastic and in good fun, right?  Then start steering it away.  
If they refuse to leave that point, now, you have to start focusing on 
the suggestions of, “That’s it.  You can laugh.  It’s funny, but it’s kind 
of fading away.”  And you’re just emphasizing more and more that 
whatever the effect is, in this case its hysteria, but it could be any of 
the other things as well, that those things are – the effect’s being 
dampened down. It’s becoming less and less and so on.   
 
Essentially, it’s the reverse of what we’re going to come onto in a 
moment.  If you want the hand to lift and you have a little twitch, 
you’re encouraging the twitch to become more until you have the 
full levitation.  This is the reverse.  It’s kind of like saying you have 
the full levitation, now let’s de-encourage it until it’s just a normal 
hand sitting on the lap.  Does that kind of make sense to you?  So 
you’re just reversing the process of creating hypnotic phenomenon 
in order to undo one, if you need it.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Usually though, just so you know, usually unless you’ve already lost 
that person, which means you haven’t been paying attention for 
quite a bit of time, then a simple suggest that it clears up will clear 
it up.  Right?  That’s really been my experience.  I don’t know if 
that’s been your experience. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s been my experience the vast majority of the time.  If you can 
suggest it, you can suggest it away.  I’ve suggested someone’s 
 
cut themselves shaving before and sticking plasters all over their 
face.  I didn’t know they had low blood pressure, so they started to 
feel faint.  It only took two seconds to suggest that away then.  You 
say, “You can peel them off.  You feel fine.”  These –  
 
Igor: 
But just notice what Anthony was just saying there.  Which is, he 
didn’t carry on with the gag longer and longer and longer until 
they’re seeing them sink, “Oh, great, fainting.  Let’s make more of a 
fainting suggestion.”  Right?  You didn’t encourage the problem.  
And then if something uncomfortable, if anything negative, 
anything slightly out of control starts happening, you are 
responsible.  You’re running the show, so shut that part of the show 
down.  That’s not a side display that needs to be opened, right?  
 
Anthony: 
And just to come back to this; people who don’t emerge.  I just 
want to add my thoughts on it because I have experienced this and 
relatively recently.  It’s happened twice, in fact.  Once, someone in 
the audience at one of my stage hypnosis shows spontaneously 
went into it while I was doing my wake up on stage.  I’d never seen 
her.  She’d never been on stage.  She hadn’t paid any attention to 
the show at all because she was hypnotized throughout the entire 
show.  And I say it’s happened on one other occasion.  And I, in my 
reading, have read of many, many sort of old school techniques 
should that occur.   
 
And they include things like assume they’re faking, and they want 
the attention.  Right?  A lot of stage hypnotists will say that.  
“Anyone who does that is just faking.”  Other times they’ll say, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
142 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
“Look, they need it.  They’re loving that so much, they need that 
hypnosis.  Therefore, if you really want them out, tell them they 
won’t be able to feel good again.”  I don’t really want to nip away at 
people’s possibilities of experience in life by threatening them 
essentially that they will not be able to return to that state.  
Apparently that can have some effect.  You can just get more 
commanding, reassert yourself.   
 
Put your hand on their shoulder.  Really go for it that way.  But if 
any of that’s failing, then there’s things like blow on their eyelids, 
like poof, massively bang, just shock.  Put your fingers into the 
palms of their hands, put like a little dig in there, that kind of thing.  
And I’ve had all this stuff essentially in my back pocket should this 
occur.  And on the couple of occasions it has occurred, I’ve run 
through all of those techniques I’ve just given you, and it didn’t 
make any difference at all in that situation. 
 
Igor: 
As a rule, we do not encourage you to come to pain or mutilations 
of the body or anything like that, not encouraged. 
 
Anthony: 
I really wouldn’t encourage you to do any of that stuff.  That person 
is – In the two experiences I’ve had, and I’ve spoken to other people 
about similar experiences, in the two experiences I’ve had, that 
person has been fine in a perfectly happy place and state.  They’re 
not confused.  They’re not upset.  Problem is they can’t move.  They 
feel like they cannot move.  Everything else is normal.  So they can 
hear their friends.  They can hear you.  They can hear your tone of 
voice.  And if, just because they look like a floppy rag doll, you’re 
talking to your friends saying, “Shit.  What are we going to do?  This 
looks bad.”  You got to understand that’s just going to reinforce the 
predicament. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a bad suggestion at this point. 
 
Anthony: 
So you have to, from the off, except the fact that no one in the 
history of this game has got stuck in that state forever.  Or even for 
decades.

Igor: 
It’s just the question of time. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, it’s a question of time.  So your job really is first off to 
reassure them, just like they’re wide awake sitting next to you.  This 
is going to be fine.  Everything’s going to be fine.  Sometimes 
people want to spend a little bit of time there but they always make 
a decision and wake up at a certain point in time.  Okay.  Just 
reassure them.  Reassure their friends next.  Immediately, reassure 
everybody around and say, “This is the situation, very, very rare 
but, occasionally, people do this.  They just want to sleep.  She’ll 
wake up in her own time.”  Reassure them.  Get people on your 
side.  This is the thing that Igor was starting to touch on.   
 
Get people on your side.  Find someone who looks half sensible in 
their group and say, “Look, this is the situation.  I’m not leaving.  I’m 
not going anywhere.  Your friend is perfectly fine.  It doesn’t look 
that way, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.”  And get someone on 
your side.  They’re going to be much more effective in fending off 
the other friend whose going, “You’ve broken my friend.”  And trust 
me they will be emotional about it after ten minutes and 20 
minutes.   
 
Igor: 
It’s only because they don’t know what to expect of this whole 
thing, right?  And to emphasize something that Anthony’s saying 
here, and just so you understand, we’re talking about something 
very rare.  There’s something very different between the coma, 
which is what Anthony with the hypnotic-coma is talking about. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s a turn of phrase.  It’s not a coma. 
 
Igor: 
And someone who’s just a little bit hesitant about coming back 
because they’re kind of enjoying themselves, right?  And you will – 
you can kind of see that there’ll be a big difference.  There’ll be a 
different responsiveness and so on.  Most people, I mean that’s 
99.9 with lots of extra nines at the end percent of people will be 
absolutely fine if you come through the emergence type, waking up

type script, they’ll come back.  And if they then come back it’s 
almost like, it’s like, “Do I have to?”  And then just being more 
insistent, more – giving more suggestions, more alertness.  
Sometimes they come back a little bit groggy, so that you just 
reinforce alertness.  You might have a logical chat with them a little 
bit. Maybe give them a little water or something to drink to kind of 
ground them a bit.  These are all, really, what I expect will be the 
extreme cases that you’ll meet best.   
 
The coma you really have to go through literally thousands of 
people to find the one case, so when you do, put a gold star on your 
shoulder and say, “Wow.  I got my coma, one in a million.”  Right?  
And it literally is one in a million, pretty much. 
 
Anthony: 
But it’s just the situation where you really can’t panic.  I’ll just put 
one other thing on the list, and this is, again, it’s pretty rare that 
people take it upon themselves to do this, but, on occasion, one of 
those friends will assert themselves as a hypnotist.  So you’ve had 
your fun, and you’ve done your performance, and their friend 
comes up and says, “Look at me.  Sleep.”  And knocks their friend 
straight out.  Again, it’s very rare that someone assumes that they 
would be able to do that.  But if they assert themselves with 
confidence, as some of you did after a couple of hours this morning, 
you realize that you can hypnotize some people and it’s just very 
straightforward.  So again, from a personal point of view, I’m not 
someone who locks subjects down as a matter of course and says, 
“Nobody else can hypnotize you.  Only I can hypnotize you.”  I think 
it’s a terrible suggestion to, again, limit someone’s choices in that 
way. 
 
Audience Member: You don’t want to use a seal on anybody. 
 
Anthony: 
A seal, exactly.  Okay.  However, if you’re in a situation and 
suddenly that person you hypnotized is now getting knocked out by 
their friends, then do it.  Put a temporary seal on them.  “For the 
rest of the evening, no one other than a professional hypnotist, that 
you’ve given your permission to can hypnotize you.”  Very simple 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
145 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
stuff, just common sense suggestions again.  Because it can cause a 
problem, and again, I’ve encountered that in a couple of situations. 
 
Audience Member: Have you run into where someone has admitted to being 
hypnotizable, having been hypnotized, but you can’t hypnotize 
them because they’ve been sealed previously?  
 
Igor: 
Just so everybody can hear, the question is: has Anthony ever run 
into a situation where a subject can be hypnotized, and they know 
they’ve been in trance before, but some hypnotist has sealed them 
off so they basically said, “No one else but me can hypnotize you” 
hence, you can’t do it? 
 
Anthony: 
No, I’ve only run into kind of an indirect seal where an inept 
hypnotist has told someone that they can’t be hypnotized, and they 
come in with that belief on board.  But obviously you can break 
through that one.  However, my father does this as well.  He’s 
treated 30,000 people in hypnotherapy, and there was a guy that 
lived in Southeast London, not too far away from my dad, who 
spent 30 years sealing every single one of his clients, and then died.  
Some of these people wanted hypnotherapy again later in life, and 
some of those people have come to see my dad.  Locks can be 
broken.  So a seal is just a suggestion but – 
 
Igor: 
But that’s all going beyond the scope of this course.  
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, it is.  But it can be undone.  So no, I haven’t personally come 
across it, but my father has.  But he managed to talk his way around 
it because he’s a good hypnotist.   
 
Igor: 
So the key thing about seals, really, to bear in mind is: don’t put 
them on people unless it’s a very temporary thing and you may be 
able to shield them from people in – I like the consent seal.  In other 
words, unless you specifically consent to being hypnotized, no one 
else will be able to hypnotize you for tonight or for however long 
you wish it.  It just gives you a lot more permission.  In terms of 
breaking seals, this is not really the content of this course, so if you

146 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
want to do that, come to either one of our advanced courses and 
you can tell that there.  
 
 
Q & A Session  
 
Igor: 
All right, so what I want to do is basically, seeing as this is an 
important segment before we get into the practical side of things 
again, there were some comments and questions.  I saw a couple of 
you people kind of putting hands up and so on.  So let me just hand 
this over to you guys and if you have any comments or questions 
about this or anything related to this, now is the time to ask, and 
then we’ll move on to something else.  Okay?  So can you come and 
bring this back to Cassandra in the back there with the red t-shirt?  
Thank you, Bob.  Just over there in the back.   
 
Audience Member: All right.  Thank you.  I was just going to say – 
 
Igor:  
 
Is that on?  Sorry? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor:  
 
Okay.   
 
Audience Member: I haven’t obviously yet met the coma person, per se, like what 
you’re talking about, like really extreme, but I have met people who 
have been out for up to 10 minutes.  Like, a more extreme time 
than say the average person would come out, and usually the best, 
honestly, the best way that I’ve found to get people out is just to 
suggest that they’ll feel just as good as they’re starting to feel again 
in their body because often they’re staying in that state because, as 
you said, they feel really good.  Or they just, their body is just so 
relaxed they don’t know how to move.  They can still hear and 
everything.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
147 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So if you can just say you can get that movement back but at the 
same time, still keep that feeling of goodness and relaxation, often 
people respond to that and will go, “Hey, yeah, I actually can move 
my arm and still feel good.  Okay, maybe I can move the rest.” 
 
Igor: 
It’s a very simple thing.  Please, I would encourage all of you not to 
get hung up on this idea of coma.  It is so rare that I doubt anyone 
in this room or maybe, at best, one person in this room will come 
across it and that will probably be in about 20 years time.   
 
Anthony: 
Exactly.  It’s there for completeness and it should be. It’s much like 
someone having a fit.  They are as likely to have that fit in the 
hairdresser’s as they are in a therapy room or stage hypnotist chair.  
However, the reason I still say that you can’t do this if you’re 
epileptic is because, I mean, I know how to deal with it, it’s let them 
have a fit and make sure they don’t choke or bang their head.  
That’s the genuine – the general medical advice.  But I don’t want 
to take that small risk into a show, especially when other, or a 
performance when other people are involved.  So I don’t think that 
I’m going to make the problem, but it’s if they happen to have a fit 
in the middle of my street hypnotism act, I am going to have more 
explaining to do than the hairdresser.  So, and for no good reason at 
all, other than people misunderstand hypnosis.   
 
Igor: 
So just keep these things – Let me put it – Are these rules relatively 
straightforward?  Yes.  In terms of - Do you want to pass? Are you 
finished with the microphone or you have a follow up on that?  
 
Audience Member: Yeah, I was just going to say it’s a very simple, easy solution that 
people can take care of. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah.  In terms of like any case of relaxing some people too much 
that you’ll come across, treat it along the following lines, which is 
kind of basically what Cassandra was saying.  They’re just enjoying it 
a lot or they might be a little bit slow to come back, in which case 
just suggest it more, guide them along a little bit more.  So you're 
basically using wake up suggestions instead of going to sleep 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
148 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
suggestions.  That’s basically you’re reversing hypnotic process.  
That’s all you’re doing.  As long you keep your cool, everything’s 
going to be fine.   
 
And even in the really extreme cases, which I doubt really most of 
you will ever come across. The worst thing that will happen is in the 
function of time.  They will be back; it’s just a question of half an 
hour, 40 minutes.  It takes a little bit of time, but that’s the most 
extreme case.  Provided you can keep everyone else calm, it’ll be 
just fine.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Hopefully, that gives 
you a lot of comfort because this is really the worst thing that can 
happen, and you should know how to deal with all these things, 
even though we haven’t finished day one yet, which is kind of crazy, 
isn’t it? 
 
Anthony: 
When are you doing your abreaction drill?  Tomorrow?   
 
Igor: 
Tomorrow, I’ll do it tomorrow.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: Just quickly, do you fit alcohol in with drugs? 
 
Igor: 
So the question about alcohol and drugs.  Yes and no.  If someone’s 
kind of falling down drunk, then yeah, don’t do it.  Basically, here’s 
the rule of thumb. If you were sober and you’d feel uncomfortable 
talking to them because you think this person might do themselves 
or you or some harm or your clothing some harm in some way, then 
don’t work with them.  If they’re just a little bit happy, fine.  Right?  
If they’ve gone beyond that point where lucidity becomes 
questionable, then don’t work with them because you’re asking for 
any kind of random wild response to come out.  It becomes a lot 
harder to predict how they will act out on the suggestion.   
 
Audience Member: So suggestibility itself isn’t affected by alcohol? 
 
Anthony: 
Sorry? 
 
Igor: 
No.  Suggestibility is not affected by alcohol.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
149 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony:  
No. 
 
Igor: 
Attention is.  If you don’t have attention, your job is a lot harder, 
right?  So when – a little bit of alcohol is actually good because it 
loosens some inhibitions.  When you start losing the attention span, 
though, if they cannot focus anymore, well, sometimes that’s a 
safeguard on its own because they won’t go into hypnosis probably 
because they can’t think about it anymore.  But, on occasion, they’ll 
act out on suggestions more wildly than they should just because 
they’re just hammed up drunk, and you don’t want to – you just 
want to avoid that.  So sloppy drunks, no.  Happy drunks, go for it.   
 
Audience Member: We talked a little bit about drugs and your doctor or others has 
given them to you, in particular psychotic drugs or psychological 
drugs.  Our culture is such that the people on psychological drugs, 
Prozac and others, has increased so dramatically I’d be willing to 
bet that half of the people in here are on Prozac or some other 
antidepressant or something of that nature.  What – Do you say, “If 
you’re that sort of thing, that you shouldn’t be part of the show?”  
Or - 
 
Anthony: 
There’s enough people out there that you can have choice.  Again, 
it’s the same kind of response as before.  I don’t think, personally 
from my experience, that they’re any A.) less hypnotizable or B.) 
more likely to do something crazy.  I really don’t.   
 
Audience Member: I’ve had too many of my hypnotherapy chair – 
 
Igor: 
Just hedge your bets, it’s very simple.  If there’s any doubt, don’t 
work with that person.  It’s really simple.  If they seem normal, 
sane, socialized, lucid, people that you’d invite back to your 
parents’ and have tea with, then chances are, you can work with 
them unless there’s some kind of medical condition going on.   
 
Anthony: 
I was about to hypnotize someone – This guy came up.  He’s 
watching some color tricks we’re doing downtown the other night, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
150 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
and he seemed friendly enough.  I was chatting to him.  Then he 
said, “Take this back to the UK, Tupac Shakur is alive.”  He’s a 
rapper who was shot and very publicly died.  That was good enough 
reason for me not to work with that person.  It was.  I just thought – 
The next thing he was talking about Bill Gates and he was like, okay, 
okay, okay.  My gut feeling, I’m not suggesting this is great from a 
therapist point of view, my gut feeling was, “You’re mad.  I don’t 
want to be in your company anymore.  “I can’t deal with this.”  
Right?  So I just trust my gut feeling, and politely we all edged away.   
 
Igor: 
It goes right back to what we started the whole day with, which is: 
you’re responsible, you have instincts, don’t ignore your instincts 
just because the seminar said so, right?  Go with your instincts.  If 
you don’t feel safe with some person, if you feel there’s something 
off with that person, there’s a ton of people, especially in places like 
Vegas, big cities.  There are more people than you’ll ever be able to 
meet, so just don’t work with that person.  Why take a risk?  Right?  
Does that kind of make sense to you guys?   
 
Audience Member: Sure. 
 
Igor: 
It’s really simple common sense sort of stuff.  Any other questions 
or do you all kind of get the idea of health and safety?  There’s one 
over here and then one over there.  Do you want to come to the 
front first or – We’ll come to you in a minute.  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: Do you ever have people that you hypnotized then afterwards 
they’re like, “Oh, my back hurts,” or something like that?  So you 
know it’s kind of a false claim, but - 
 
Igor: 
Sure.  That’s America for you, right? 
 
Anthony: 
I avoid those routines.  I avoid drop backs.  I avoid arm pulls.  I avoid 
that stuff because then it’s very, very difficult for the person to pin 
it on any act.  If you’re going to balance someone between 2 chairs, 
stand on him, if you’re going to drop him onto the pavement, then 
you don’t know if they’ve got a back condition.  The point is they 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
151 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
don’t know if they’ve got a back condition, so their complaint may 
be genuine afterwards.  But no, it hasn’t happened.  
 
Igor: 
And in terms of – remember this – in terms of doing street 
hypnosis, assuming you’ve done everything safely, right?  So you’re 
not actually going out to damage people and so on.  You got to 
remember that when people are in a trance, they’re all kind of – 
they have this happy glow of trance, and they love the world, and 
everything’s fantastic.  So when they come back out, they’re like, 
“Wow, that’s an amazing experience,” unless you do something to 
suggest or imply that this will be a useful or appropriate course of 
behavior, I don’t think they will even think about it because they’re 
too much in a good, positive state.  Right?   
 
And this whole idea of creating a false claim just for the sake of 
getting rich off someone else, really, that requires a very different 
mindset, so you’re relatively protected by that.  But do bear in mind 
you’re going to still act safely.  It does not take responsibility from 
you, from doing hypnosis safely and taking care of people 
physically.  Does that make sense?  Do you want to pass it forward 
and then I think then we’re pretty much done, and we can start 
actually getting some hypnosis done again. 
 
Audience Member: I just want to be clear on something because I think I’ve been doing 
something kind of stupid.  But back in San Diego, we have a lot of 
homeless, grownup males always bumming money off people.  And 
so lately – I’m not going to do this anymore after hearing this – I’ve 
been saying, “Sure, I’ll give you a couple bucks if you let me 
hypnotize you.”  And it hasn’t gone over very well because their 
focus has been way off and they’re – But now I’m beginning to think 
if they actually – If I was successful I could have all kinds of 
problems, so I don’t think that’s something I want to -  
 
Igor: 
There might be.  Yeah.  Again, I’m not saying that hypnotizing 
homeless people is a bad thing.  It’s just you got to ask yourself 
why.  Are they on drugs?  Are they on the streets because they have 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
152 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
had a psychotic break and the system is not really looking after 
them?  Those are risks that you take along the way, right?   
 
Audience Member: That’s what it looked – That’s what they looked – Their focus – They 
can’t focus. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  So if you’re doing – if you’re being an angel of mercy, 
you’re doing lots of hypnotherapy with people on the streets and so 
on.  Assuming you have the skill and the legal backing, especially in 
a country like America you need the law on your side there as well, 
that can be a tremendous thing to do for people.  For street 
hypnosis, if there’s any doubt, in my opinion there is no doubt.  
Right?  Work with normal, stable, sane, lucid people, and if you 
have any doubt about their stability, their sanity, their lucidity, their 
focus, their mental capacity in any ways, just bow out.  It’s no big 
deal.   
 
Audience Member: Can I ask one more question?   
 
Igor: 
Okay, one last question then well dive in. 
 
Audience Member: Talking about this brings up the idea of insurance.  For state 
hypnotists there’s insurance.  For hypnotherapy there’s insurance.  
Will the entertainment insurance cover street hypnosis?  You have 
to talk to your insurer directly about that.  Street hypnosis is such a 
new concept that I don’t think insurance companies have really 
caught up to it.  If you can get them on record saying, “Sure, that 
covers it.  It’s just stage hypnosis on the street.”  Then they’ll go, 
“Sure, it’ll cover it.”  As long as you have that in written record, then 
that’s a contract between you and your insurer.  We can’t give you 
legal advice on that, unfortunately.   
 
So yeah, that’s something you would have to talk to your insurance 
company directly about.  I remember when I was doing coaching, in 
the UK it was very new, so I had a training insurance, and I 
specifically had them write me a letter to confirm that training 
insurance covers coaching, which was one-to-one training as far as 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
153 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
they were concerned.  Right?  So that’s something that you have to 
deal directly with the insurers and clarify with them.  All right, guys.  
 
Audience Member: Real quick, what about women in high heels? 
 
Igor:  
 
Women in high heels.  Well, that’s just a safety issue, right? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
 
That’s all part of your setup.  If they’re in high heels, then –  
 
Igor: 
Yeah, there’s a balance issue there, so either sit them down, right?  
Or make sure that some of their friends are holding them just so 
they’ve got the extra balance thing.  Again, just go back with the old 
rule of thumb.  If there’s any doubt to safety, don’t do it.  All right?  
Don’t do the induction if you think it won’t be safe.  Don’t do the 
suggestion if you don’t think you’ll be safe with that person.  Don’t 
work with the person if you think that they’re unstable in some 
way.  It’s a really simple rule of thumb.  There are thousands of 
millions of people in this world that you can happily hypnotize 
without any consequences, negative consequences, and everyone 
has a great time.   
 
For the purpose of street hypnosis, if there’s any doubt, just don’t 
do it.  Avoid it.  It’s a great thing to not think about.  So either you 
can counter it by sitting them down or taking care of it.  Say, “Take 
your shoes off,” if it’s an appropriate environment for that, or you 
don’t do it.  Make sense?  Everyone happy?  All right, guys.  Let’s 
get some hypnosis done.  Everyone stand up please.   
 
 
Complete Street Routine 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so before we started going through the whole health and 
safety thing, you saw Anthony give you a very nice demonstration 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
154 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
of the talk through, the different suggestion experiments and so on, 
right?  Do you all remember the magnetic hands?   
 
It is essentially very easy to do isn’t it?  It’s just hands out; imagine 
this, and then suggesting for the hands to come together.  It’s very 
straightforward.  Does anyone doubt the capacity to be able to do 
that in this room?  Anyone?  Excellent.  Was that a hand?  No, that’s 
someone trying it out.  That’s good.  All right.  So what I want you 
do is the following: I’d like you to find another person, and I want 
you to go through a whole routine stack so another little set piece.  
The set piece is going to be as follows: Step one is you’ll have to 
open them up.  In other words, you’ll give them an eyebrow flash, 
you go over, shake the hand, introduce yourself, that sort of thing.  
Make sense?  Step one easy to do, right? 
 
You’ve already done it.  Step two is present your introduction.  I can 
think of no more elegant and simple introduction than the one 
Anthony has given to you already, which is the compliment, self 
intro, and open question.  Does that make sense?  Okay.  Step three 
– And as part of your intro, you may do a call to action as well, 
which is basically, “Do you want to try this out?  Do you want to 
have a mind experiment?  Do you want to feel really good?  Some 
kind of offer, tag onto the end of it if it’s all flowing well, right?  
Step three we’re going to put in; we’ll call it health and safety.  
Literally, we do not expect for you to spend five hours explaining 
the ins and outs of hypnosis and what could go wrong.   
 
We just want you to come up with a simple one or two liner that 
kind of covers the kind of territory we talked about and will allow 
you to almost instantly filter out the people you don’t want to be 
working with.  Does that make sense?  In fact, well, as I think about 
it, let’s just do that straightaway.  That might be the easiest way.  
What I want you to do is just go around and meet everyone in this 
room.  Don’t worry about introductions, don’t worry about intros, 
or anything like that.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
155 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
The only think I want you to do is go up deliver a one to two line 
health and safety statement. Have them deliver one back at you, 
and you do another person.  I want you to collect as many different 
versions from different people as you can.  Okay?  As you go along, 
you’ll hear things other people are saying that you’ll like.  Feel free 
to steal it, change your own version, and put that into it.  Within 
two or three minutes, you should have a very simple, smooth, glib 
one that you can just throw out there and you’re comfortable with.  
Does that make sense to you guys?   
 
So the purpose here is to just go through as many people as 
possible with literally just a one or two liner.  If the person’s still 
there 5 minutes later, it means you’re talking too much.  So the 
solution to that is: stop it.  So everyone just walk around the room, 
find as many people as possible, give them your one or two liners 
on health and safety, and hear them in return.   
 
All right, guys, so how was that?  Did you find that interesting?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Did you hear variations on the whole health and safety statements 
and you kind of liked some of the things?  Hopefully, you heard 
some versions that were too long and you went, “Ah, all right, I get 
it.  I don’t need to be belaboring this too much.”  Is that fair to say?  
Please don’t think that just because you have something you’re 
comfortable with right now that that’s the only thing you’ll have.  
All these things will constantly be refined as you progress through 
your career as a street hypnotist, and that should be the case, 
right? So always listen out it or that your mind can kind of take over 
about better ways of phrasing, better ways of presenting and so on.   
 
It’ll fan you in good stead.  It’s just good enough for right now.  Is 
that fair?  And it doesn’t take more than like ten, twenty seconds to 
come up with your health and safety statement, is that correct?  
Okay.  So here’s what we’re going to do now.  We’re going to 
basically put everything we’ve done so far together, and then we’ll

fill in the gaps.  You can eyebrow flash and open someone.  Is that 
correct?  Yes?  You can introduce yourself and give them a little call 
to action.  After the open question, you can offer them something 
like a hypnotic experience, power of imagination, something like 
that.  Is that correct?  Okay.  You can present them a very quick and 
easy health and safety statement.  Is that correct? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor:  
 
Let me just get the feedback part again.  Is that correct? Yes?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor:  
 
Question? 
 
Audience Member: I’ve avoided sometimes the use of the word hypnosis and then 
you’re going to the health and safety statement about I’m not 
allowed – It should be something like, “I shouldn’t hypnotize you if 
you have X, Y and Z.”  
 
Igor: 
So the question here is: he’s saying sometimes you avoid the word 
hypnosis, but then the health and safety says, “I can’t hypnotize you 
if” – and then you give the game away, right?  
 
Audience Member: You can say you can’t do the performance. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  So all the question is, is you stay congruent with whatever 
theme you’re playing.  If you’re talking the power of the mind, you 
say, “Well, for this experience I don’t want to work with vulnerable 
people because I need to take extra care, attention to them.  So if 
you’re pregnant, if you’re on medical drugs of some sort or have 
some kind of mental condition, please don’t take part in this.  It’s 
not that you can’t experience the power of the mind, it’s just that 
now’s not the time for it.”  Does that make sense?  So just stay 
congruent with your idea.  Okay?  So we got up to this point so far: 
health and safety, yes?

Next, you do finger vice.  Remember this here?  It’s easy to do.  You 
did that one?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Next, you’ll do the magnetic hands.  You remember this one here?  
That was straightforward, easy to do, right?  Then you go straight 
into induction, a little deepener.  Those amongst you who want to 
go for extra bonus points will put in, what I call boiler plates, is 
those general safety statements.  “You’re here.  You’re safe.  You’ll 
have a fantastic time.  You’re sitting in a chair.”  Or, “You’re 
standing,” you know, sleep and stand.  Basically, some key ideas 
around safety for the performance, right?  The classic ones are 
physically safe, in other words sleep and stand, or locked on that 
chair, “You can’t move from that chair,” and so on.   
 
 
So it keeps them physically in the environment.  The second key 
one would be emotional safety.  “Throughout this experience 
you’re feeling safe and calm and relaxed,” and so on.  “This will be a 
fantastic experience for you.”  Those are the key ones.  Does that 
make sense?  You do not have to use it at this point.  We will weave 
it in more and more as we go through.  For the moment, just throw 
it in there if you feel like it, if you want to have a little challenge.  
Otherwise, don’t worry about it so much right now.  So we’re good 
up to point five, yes?  
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Then we put in points six and seven, which we can skip for now.  
And then we’ll come on to the ending process.  The ending process 
is very important.  No. 1, you want to cancel whatever suggestions 
you’ve presented to them.  What I like to do is a kind of a blanket 
cancellation that gets rid of all suggestions except the ones I 
specifically want them to keep, like the hypnotic gift and so on.  
Why? Because you don’t want them to sit there drinking their beer 
and snorkeling like a pig for the rest of the night.  Or maybe you do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
158 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
but, in that case, make sure that there’s some kind of consent 
involved there.  Right?   
 
You don’t want the suggestions to continue after you have left.  Let 
me give you an example of what I mean. This did not happen to me; 
this actually happened to my sister.  She was at a party and an 
amateur hypnotist was there trying to – just playing around with 
some ideas, presented a post motor suggestion, we’ll talk more 
about what that is tomorrow or the day after, about that they’d 
have this compulsion – when their eyes open they’ll have this 
compulsion to go off and smell the vase of flowers in the corner of 
the room, right?  You count 1, 2, 3.  Eyes open.  Nothing.  The guy 
ignored the suggestion.  Or so he thought.   
 
For the next 3 weeks, this guy had intense dreams of flowers 
everywhere.  He couldn’t figure it out; he was going nuts.  Right?  
So just because someone doesn’t seem to respond to suggestion 
does not mean that it hasn’t activated.  It may just have a time 
delay built in.  It may just have a slightly different way of presenting 
itself than you’d expected.  So as a rule, cancel all the suggestions 
you’ve presented in your performance except the ones you 
specifically want them to carry on with.  In other words, in my 
opinion, it ends up only being the gift or if you’re doing post motor 
suggestions for something else, something like that. 
 
Anthony: 
All the silly suggestions are gone, everything back to normal, feeling 
great -  
 
Igor: 
You’ve heard him say that before, haven’t you? 
 
Audience Member: Well, I’ll say -  
 
Anthony: 
I’ll often say – If we’ve been doing this kind of silly stuff, I’ll say, “All 
those silly suggestions are gone, everything back to normal.”  Again, 
even those terms can be interpreted in different ways, but I just 
kind of find most people know what I mean.  We’ve done -   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
159 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
You just – 
 
Anthony: 
We’ve just don an act.  The silly stuff is over.  They can keep the 
good, upbeat suggestions that are clearly directed as a posthypnotic 
suggestion after the event, such as feeling good and reflecting on 
the experience in a certain way.  And just using that word “normal,” 
everything back to normal.  Bear in mind you’re delivering that – 
 
Igor: 
It’s a great word. 
 
Anthony: 
As a suggestion.  If someone wants to try and sue you because 
they’re not normal, then why didn’t they take your suggestion to be 
normal?  Again, I’m not suggesting it’s the strongest argument, 
although I’d want to stand behind it in court.  But the fact is they 
were hypnotized, weren’t they?  I said they were normal.  It’s – just 
say it.  Just get used to cleaning up.  
 
Igor: 
Ultimately, it’s just belts and braces, right?  Nothing you do is ever 
going to be 100 percent, but we can guarantee it as much as 
possible, right?  This stuff will keep you safe.  It’ll keep them safe.  
It’s just a good habit to get into.  Right?  So do you all understand 
that?  And then, of course, at the end of it, just bring the normal 
count of one to five, feeling refreshed, alert and so on.  Make sure 
when they’re back that they are – that their eyes are clear, that 
they’re lucid, that they can kind of function in space again and so 
on.  So there’s just as a rule of thumb, especially when you do stuff 
on the streets, you don’t want to leave the moment they come 
back.  Eyes open, “Great, see ya.”  Hang around for a while.   
 
First of all, people will be asking lots of questions anyway, but what 
you want to be doing is just keeping half an eye – don’t keep 
looking at the subject like this because they might take as another 
induction and disappear again, right?  It’s true.  It’ll happen.  It’s 
happened to you, no doubt.  Just looking at someone funny, they’ll 
go like, “Oh, I guess it’s an induction.”  Right?  But just be normal, 
chat to the people and so on, and keep half an eye on the person 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
160 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
that you’ve just hypnotized or the people you’ve just hypnotized to 
make sure that they are back to normal.  
 
That their eyes are clear, they’re not have trouble focusing, that 
their speech is clear, that their movements through space are clear, 
they’re not having problems orienting their limbs and so on.  Does 
that kind of make sense to you guys?  Why don’t you spend about – 
it doesn’t take long, about 5 minutes is usually enough to get a 
good sense that these guys are – it’s all good.   
 
Anthony: 
Ensure that you become more upbeat in your wakeup as well.  
Quite often when people have been relaxing and counting down 
and making you feel good and whispering away and all this kind of 
stuff, its fine.  If you carry on in the same manner, same tempo and 
attitude, when you do the wakeup, then they’re quite often roused, 
and they’re a little bit drowsy, and they’re still very relaxed.  And 
again, I’ve done a wakeup here a few times now.  You say this, 
“Right, in a moment I’m going to count to five, and on the count of 
five this is how it’s going to be.  One, feeling wonderful.  Two, 
sitting up in the chair.  Three, taking a deep breath.”   
 
There’s no choice other than to be energized and wide awake and 
alert because that’s where it’s all being pushed.  And again, 
afterwards, the question is, “You feeling good?”  Appreciate it’s a 
leading question – 
 
Igor: 
But lead away. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly.  “Are you okay?”  That’s not great.  “You feeling good?  
How relaxing was that?  How refreshing is that?”   
 
Igor: 
Do you guys get a sense of these nine steps?  Don’t worry about six 
and seven just yet; we’ll fill that in a minute.  This is very simple 
stuff, right?  It’s just a few extra steps.  It’s just – Really, you’ve 
done more or less everything on this list.  It’s just a question of 
putting them together in a sequence and getting used to it.  Isn’t 
that right?  So everyone stand up please.  Put your books down.

Find a person and run them through the nine steps making sure to 
skip steps six and seven. 
 
Audience Member: We don’t know what they are, though.  
 
Igor: 
I know.  Off you go. 
 
Anthony: 
Good suggestions aren’t they? 
 
Igor: 
That’ll make it easier to skip. 
 
Demonstration of Exercise 
 
Speaker 1: 
- do anything else of hypnosis character; I want to know if you’re 
over 18, you haven’t got any mental, medical, or physical conditions 
I need to know about.  If so, tell me now.  
 
Speaker 2: 
No. 
 
Speaker 1: 
So taking that big deep breath again.  Looking into this eye.  That’s 
right.  You’re about to have an extremely pleasant journey with the 
trance.  Just give me your hand.  Loosely. That’s right.  Soon I will 
drop your hand.  When I do, you will close your eyes and go into 
deep state of trance.  Are you ready?  Three, two, one, sleep.  
That’s right.  Deeper, deeper, deeper.  The deeper you go, the more 
relaxed you feel.  The more relaxed you feel, the deeper you go.  
That’s right.   
 
Even deeper.  That’s right.  Feeling that relaxation.  Spreading it 
around your body.  Feeling just amazing and realizing you will 
become the hypnotist you like.  In fact, you already are.  This 
weekend will be a rollercoaster of a good kind.  You will have laughs 
and giggles, you will learn a new skill set, and you will have an 
amazing time meeting the most wonderful people you can meet.  Is 
that in agreement?  That’s right.  Taking that feeling back to this 
room, starting to hear voices around you again.  Coming wide

awake.  I will count from three to one, and you will be back.  Three, 
two, one.  Feeling fantastic.  How do you feel?   
 
Speaker 2:   
Fantastic.  
 
Speaker 1: 
 
Awesome. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
*** 
 
Speaker 3:  
I’m finding every word I give you, every suggestion I give you is your 
reality completely and I’m seeing your arm gets higher and higher, 
lighter and lighter.  You rock even more now, that’s right.  And the 
more you rock, the deeper you go and the deeper you go the better 
you feel.  That’s right.  The arm moves higher and higher, lighter 
and lighter.  That’s right. Every word I say instantly it will be your 
reality.  That’s right.  Arm all the way up to the sky now, pulled up 
on that wire, pushed upon that cushion of air.  That’s right, the 
waves have stopped.  That’s right, the sea’s gone calm.  It’s all 
sunny all of a sudden, and you’re feeling warm, really warm 
because of how sunny it is.  That’s right.  That’s right.  Oh, no, the 
storm’s come back now. 
 
Waving in the sea again, in the ocean.  You will not fall over.  You’re 
completely safe and completely fine.  But it is strong.  And it’s 
saying deeper, now deeper sleep.  Deeper sleep.  And stop again, 
that’s right.  It’s sunny once again and a lovely calm day.  This arm’s 
going higher into the sky now; all the way up as you go deep, 
deeper sleep.  That’s right.  In a moment, I’m going to have you 
open your eyes.  When you open your eyes you’ll found that arm is 
just stuck out there like a statue’s arm.  It’s no longer connected to 
your conscious mind, and you don’t know why.  It’s connected to 
your unconscious mind.   
 
This arm belongs to me courtesy of your unconscious mind.  It’s no 
longer connected to your conscious mind.  I touch your shoulder 
here and you look at the arm and it’s just stuck out, weird, right?  
Look at the arm and realize how it’s just stuck out there.  You can’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
163 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
move it.  It’s weird, isn’t it?  It’s just not there.  Paralyzed for a short 
while because of your unconscious mind.  Just stuck there and your 
feet are locked down and bolted, rooted into the ground so much 
so that they’re just stuck down there.  Like a statue, stuck into the 
ground.  Rooted, held down by your unconscious.  That’s right, 
they’re stuck now.   
 
Here’s the really interesting thing, in a moment, the arm will be 
able to move but only when I touch it.  The reason the arm’s able to 
move when I touch it is because you’ll completely forget your 
name.  The only thing your name is completely gone.  You can’t 
move that arm yet.  When I touch it, you will not be able to recall 
your name, you will not be able to work out like when you’re trying 
to remember a name and trying to guess it, the further away it 
becomes difficult to work out that name.  It’s gone.  The arm goes 
loose and limp.  You can’t remember your name anymore.  What’s 
it like to remember your name.  Try and say it, you just can’t say it.  
My name’s Vince, but you have no idea what your name is.  Try and 
say your name.  It’s weird, right.  No idea.  In fact, you can’t 
remember anything.  You feel safe.  You can’t remember what shoe 
size you are.  You’re going to guess a random number.  Hi, and what 
shoe size are you?  Any ideas?  Crazy what you guess. 
 
Speaker 4: 
 
Six. 
 
Speaker 3: 
 
Six.  Take another guess, another crazy guess. 
 
Speaker 4: 
 
Seven. 
 
Speaker 3: 
 
No idea, right.  In fact, numbers mean nothing to you.

Hand Levitation 
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  Who enjoyed themselves doing that?  Who here is 
starting to feel like a genuine street hypnotist.  Doesn’t this feel like 
a whole thing that you’re doing here? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, it’s really coming together.   
 
Igor: 
Would you like us to add just a few little things inside here that will 
give you a complete performance A to Zed, start to finish?  
Something you can take out on the streets tonight which will be 
easy.  It will be a no-brainer.  It will be impressive and something 
you can do anytime you want.  Would you like that? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Well, really, there is no difference between what we’re about to do 
and what you’ve already done.  It’s just a question of tweaking it in 
sort of a particular variety.  Have all of you – How did the magnet 
hands go?  Was it straightforward enough?  
 
Audience Member: Yep. 
 
Igor: 
Right?  Why do you think the magnetic hands was so easy to do?  
Any ideas?  
 
Audience Member: Because you already did it. It was like the finger vice.   
 
Igor: 
Because you already primed it.  You already had the finger vice 
which is loaded physically to work.  You had a success mechanism 
and success breeds success.  So this is easy to pass the way it’s set 
up.  This is a little less easy, so it relies more on suggestion.  But 
because the mind is already in that success mindset, it will just 
accept the suggestions.  Does that make sense?  Now, if those 
hands came together – Who here pushed their hands together on 
their own just because they felt like it?  No hands?  Who here 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
165 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
noticed that as the suggestions were being presented, those hands 
moved as though they were moving by themselves?  Anyone?  Well, 
what is that if not a hand levitation sideways?   
 
Audience Member: Do you do that with eyes closed or open? 
 
Igor: 
Irrelevant.   
 
Anthony:  
It’s irrelevant, but I normally do fingers with the eyes open.  When 
they touch I suggest they close.  Magnetic hands, that’s my excuse 
for getting their eyes closed.  When I do the rehearsal also I’ll show 
you what we’re going to do because you’re going to do this with 
your eyes closed as if it’s a bit more challenging and I – that’s just so 
I can observe them.  But it doesn’t matter. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, just personal style for that one.  Okay?  So how can we get 
hand levitation?  Ah.  Right?  Really, there’s no magic to it.  The 
simple answer is: you suggest it.  Straight out.  Right?  This is the 
suggestion for hand levitation just sideways, isn’t it?  Hands coming 
together.  So if you can get this, then you can get this.  The only real 
difference between this and this is you already have it loaded in 
your favor here a little bit because the hand’s already out there.  
You’re not fighting gravity at this point.  Right?  At this point, there 
might be a little bit of fighting gravity.  So there’s a couple of things 
that you can do if you’d like to cheat.  Anyone want to cheat with 
hand levitation, get a little bit easier?   
 
Audience Member: Sure. 
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 
Igor: 
If you’ll remind me, then tomorrow before we finish up the formal 
part of the training and the bonuses of the training starts, I will 
show you the virtually foolproof, instant arm levitation induction 
that you can do on almost anyone and it will work every time. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s very good. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
166 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Igor: 
It’s kind of fun, isn’t it?   
 
Anthony: 
It’s more than fun because you can hypnotize with it as well.   
 
Igor: 
So that’s for the future a little bit.  What I want you guys to do right 
now is everyone put your pens and paper down would you?  And 
let’s play a little game here.  I’d like you to turn to the person next 
to you, just make eye contact.  Get close enough to touch.  Not in 
any way that’s Vegas like.  Now, I’d like one of you guys to just be 
the hypnotist right now. Choose in your pairings one hypnotist.  
Yes?  Everyone have that?  Jonas, you may want to focus in on this.  
So one person in each group is a hypnotist, is that correct?  
Hypnotists, I want you to reach over to one of the other person’s 
wrists and just pick it up a little bit, just very lightly. 
 
Now, as I continue to talk, I want you to just move it gently up, 
down, left, right, just in random directions.  Up, down, left, right.  
Slow, tiny movements.  Slow, tiny movements.  So slow that down a 
little bit here.  Slow that down, Cathy.  Real slow, small movements.  
And here’s the thing: around about now you should notice that if 
you release the pressure in your fingers just a little bit, that hand 
kind of stays there by itself anyways.  Right?  So just notice if you 
can just start changing your grip a little bit until that hand just kind 
of stays there anyway and then just see if you can take your hand 
off entirely.   
 
What you have right now is something that took me three years of 
fear to get to.  It’s called hand catalepsy.  If you can get this, the 
levitation is just a whisper of suggestion away.  And it’s really that 
easy.  Now, the reason we started with this, the hand levitation, is 
purely and simply because that’s now defied gravity.  Gravity is no 
longer working against you.  You don’t need it.  But you may as well 
have it.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys?   
 
So all we’re going to do for the hand levitation is – If you’re going to 
touch someone, especially if they’re in trance, just warn them, “I’m 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
167 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
about to touch your right wrist.”  Or, “I’m about to touch you on 
the wrist, right here.”  Right?  Now, one of two things you can do.  
You can either just pick it up and carry on talking to them because 
in a moment this hand here is going to just find a really interesting 
experience there.  Catalepsy.  Simple, quick, easy, and I appreciate 
it so much that you are working with me unconscious mind.  
Because in a moment you find this hand is wanting to lift up all the 
way, just comfortable lifting sensation.  There you go.  It just begins.  
A nice, natural lifting.  There you go.  That’s it.   
 
And you can just enjoy this experience resting up here in front of 
everyone, being recharged and reenergized, knowing that when 
you come back out, you’ll be able to do even a better job being a 
presenter for these guys.  In the meantime, just enjoy the sensation 
of lifting.  You can, can you not?  I mean, is there anything magical 
in the suggestions I’ve given there?  Not really.  You’re just saying 
the hand will feel light and lift.  You can put imagery: hand, balloon, 
lifting, all that kind of stuff.  It does not matter, as long as you 
provide the idea of lifting to it.  And I like the idea of touching 
purely and simply because it’s quicker.  Right?   
 
And because they don’t quite know what’s happening.  If you 
borrow their hand and you just lift it up and start talking to them 
about other things, eventually they forget about their hand.  It 
becomes cataleptic by default.  Does that make sense?  And 
whenever you’re ready, feel free to bring yourself back, totally 
alert, totally refreshed, and kind of looking forward to doing some 
hypnosis today.  Rock and roll.   
 
This is where we get a little treat to ourselves as trainers.  I’d like to 
give you an example of what I mean on how you can do this totally 
in the waking state, although you won’t be doing it in the waking 
state. Can I just have a quick volunteer?  Anyone?  I haven’t used 
you yet.  Come on up.  Give a nice round of applause.  If you just 
stand over here a second.  So first of all, thanks a lot for coming.  
Now, what’s your name again?

Audience Member: Fiona. 
 
Igor: 
Fiona, okay.  So Fiona is going to volunteer for something.  Right?  
She doesn’t know what it is yet, but she’s already done it.  Do you 
see how for a moment the hand just rested there before she starts 
being aware of it again?  Then start moving it.  It’s that easy.  Now 
in trance, that effect gets multiplied multiple-fold.  And it didn’t 
even take – Well, how long did that take?  A few seconds.  Now, if I 
carry on doing this – Notice this.  It’s ambiguous touch.  I’m just 
basically talking about something random.  It keeps her intellect 
engaged.  Meanwhile, her unconscious mind is taking care of the 
hand.  Now, believe it or not, this feels to her right now as if I’m 
holding her hand up.  Doesn’t it?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
But it’s physically impossible, isn’t it?  Where’s my hand touching?  
Watch.  Right?  Gravity does not work this way.  But it still feels as 
though I’m holding it up, doesn’t it?  Have I induced a trance yet?   
 
Audience Member: No.  
 
Igor: 
That’s where it gets ambiguous, isn’t it?  Now, if it’s this easy just in 
the normal conversation, then when you have trance and all the 
other things going for you wouldn’t that be a no-brainer?  Would 
that be fair to say?  Especially given that you’ve already done it.  
Free movement return to your hand.  Thank you so much.  Give her 
a round of applause.   
 
So here is what I’m going to ask you guys to do.  Find a different 
partner or the partner you just worked with is fine, just a different 
partner from the previous exercise.  Right?  I want you to go 
through this whole thing here again; only this time when you get to 
steps six and seven, at step six, I want you to put in a hand 
levitation.  Right?  And the simplest way is get catalepsy and then 
suggest for it to continue lifting.  That’s it.  Is that easy to do?  It 
really is a no-brainer at this stage.

The next thing to do is, once the hand starts lifting, you may as well 
make it purposeful.  Remember the idea of linking we talked about 
earlier on?  Associating, attaching things.  This is exactly the same 
as the hypnotic gift, only this time we’re going to make it a little 
more dramatic.  We’re going to take the idea of laughter.  Why?  
Because it’s dramatic and it kind of encourages the audience to do 
things as well, and it becomes a really nice launch pad for other 
things that you’re doing.   
 
So get them to start laughing.  Now notice, the rules that Anthony 
was talking about earlier on still apply.  Tell them directly what’s 
going to happen.  “You’re going to find it funny.”  That’s pretty 
direct, isn’t it?  Then get indirect.  Repeat the same suggestion 
more indirectly.  You know, like, “You just had an amazing 
experience that just – you find hysterical.”  Right?  “You’re going to 
find it funny. Like you’ve had an experience that is just hysterical.”  
That’s a more indirect way of repeating the same idea.  Then maybe 
give some imagery.  Maybe something silly you’ve seen or 
something silly you remember or just a funny joke you’ve heard.  So 
you’re stimulating their imagination with funny ideas should we 
say.  Does that make sense?   
 
You don’t have to sit there and tell jokes.  But if you have a little 
one-liner you want to throw out there, this might be a good time to 
do it just to prime the pump a little bit.  Right?  And always start 
with a – A small response is enough.  A little twitch of the mouth is 
enough of a response to build to a large response, and that’s all.  
Right?   
 
In the same way as just a little bit of tightness in the arm can be 
built up until you have full catalepsy, which can be built up into a 
full levitation.  A small response always leads to a large response if 
you keep suggesting, keep plugging away.  Does that make sense?  
So we’re purposely not going to give you too many phrasings or 
language for the whole thing because it’s about time that you guys

170 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
started working out your own suggestions.  It’s the ideas that you’re 
presenting that’s important.   
 
So you start off, find someone, open them, a little eyebrow flash, a 
little smile, introduce yourself.  Offer them some kind of a mind, 
hypnotic-type experience. Put your health and safety things in first, 
finger vice, magnetic hands.  Do your induction.  Do your deepener.  
If you want to include some boiler plates here, that’s fine.  Then 
quickly, with just like a few seconds, get their hand a little 
cataleptic.  Then get it to lift up.  As it’s lifting up, link this lifting 
process to something funny, something that makes them laugh.  So 
when you touch their face, they’re laughing, smiling away and so 
on.  Build up on it.  Build up on it.  And just take it as far as you can 
go.  Really have a good time with it.  Right?  Once you’re at that 
laughing stage, remember cancel the suggestions again.  
 
There’s one last thing we’ll do actually out the streets, which we 
won’t do here now for time reasons.  Just cancel the suggestions.  
Finish your show.  You’re done.  You’ve done a solid piece of 
impressive street hypnosis that people will call home tonight about 
and go, “I saw this amazing thing.  You won’t believe it.”  
Guaranteed.  Does that make sense?  Any questions?  That’s what I 
like to see.  Everyone stand up.  Please find a partner.  Off you go. 
 
 
Demonstration of Exercise 
 
 
Speaker 1: 
Start to move again, and when they move together you’re going to 
start to feel that magnet pulling them closer and closer.  And as 
they move closer, they close.  That’s right.  You’re going to start to 
feel a feeling of gratitude for your own self, for all the skills you’ve 
built.  You’re going to start to notice that your own hypnosis skills 
are getting even more profound, even more and more and more 
profound, that you can actually do them with absolutely anybody.  
Even people that would normally be considered resistant become

nothing in front of you.  That’s right.  As they come a little closer 
and closer and closer together.   
 
Wanting to touch feeling the tips move.  Before they touch you can 
feel the shooting energy, that electricity shooting in between your 
hands.  So much that when they do touch, it’s going to shoot a 
feeling all the way through your body, all the way to the top of your 
head, all the way down to the tips of your toes.  All the way down 
to the bottom of your feet.  Feel that now, can’t you?  Good.  
Allowing your hands to completely come together, completely 
come together.  And when you do, a thought’s going to enter your 
mind, a thought you’ve never had before, a thought that’s going to 
feel so good that it’s actually going to bring a smile to your face.   
 
And you can allow your hands to move closer and closer together, 
actually coming palm to palm.  Good.  That’s awesome.  That’s 
good.  You feel it twitching.  You feel the movement and you have 
that thought.  That thought may be enough for your hands just to 
allow themselves to stay there.  And the thought can form itself in 
the front of your mind, and you can allow it to move all the way to 
the back, back to the front, all the way down, right in to your heart, 
where it actually finds itself resting.  When you’re ready to do that 
close your eyes and just get completely calm and relaxed.   
 
On the count of three I’m going to count from one to three.  
When I get and reach three, you’re going to feel your arms relax all 
the way down to your sides, allowing that thought that you had 
before, that really nice thought, that good thought, to bury itself all 
the way inside your mind.  Bury it down so deep that even ten years 
from now when it decides to resurface like a seedling growing into 
a flower, into a plant, you’ll have a good feeling that’ll actually 
make you smile all the way.  In one, two, and three.  Good.  Relax 
and sleep. Good and relaxed. 
 
In a minute I’m going to count from one to five.  When I count from 
one to five I want you to come back feeling better than you’ve felt 
in weeks, months, years.  It’s probably the best feeling you have 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
172 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
ever felt in your entire life because you know that if a seed is 
planted in the ground, is cared for a loved and taken care of, then 
that seed can grow into a beautiful flower just like a thought can 
turn into a whole bunch of feelings.  Good feelings, positive 
feelings, loving feelings, full feelings that start from underneath and 
grow up all the way up.  Counting up.  One: coming back in the 
room feeling really, really good, hearing the sounds around you. 
Number two: knowing the seed is growing and will continue to 
grow every day until the day that it sprouts.  Three: all the way back 
and you’re taking a deep breath.  Feeling phenomenal.  Number 
four: knowing you are the best hypnotist in the room.  Five: wide 
awake.  Feeling phenomenal.   
 
Speaker 2: Good, feels good. 
 
 
Vegas Venues 
 
Igor:  
 
So how are you guys doing?  
 
Audience Member: Good. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah.  
 
Igor:  
 
Did you enjoy that?  
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor:  
 
Weren’t your hypnotists pretty awesome?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Do they deserve a round of applause?  I think so.

So we’ve done pretty much the essence of what I’m going to ask 
you guys to do tonight.  The only thing I’ll ask you to add, if you feel 
like it, really, at that point, is if you want to add a gift just before 
you wake them up. You’ve done that already.  That’s an easy thing 
to do.  Right?  So you may as well throw it in there.   
 
So there’s a nice, simple, ten-stage process from opening, 
introduction, health and safety, a couple of tests, and induction and 
deepener, a couple of phenomena, the arm levitation and laughter, 
cancelling the general suggestions so they’re back to normal. Then 
doing a gift overall that they can take away with them as a happy 
memory of some sort.  And then bring them back out.  Right?  It’s a 
very straightforward piece.  It’ll take maybe about – Well, it 
depends on how much you elaborate on it.  But it can take you 
anywhere between six and twenty minutes to do, right?  You can 
really milk it if you wanted to.  You can pare it down to its minimum 
if you wanted to.  But you have a nice range to play with that.  Does 
that make sense to you guys?  Now, how do you feel about this, by 
the way?  Pretty good? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: Great. 
 
Igor: 
Now, let me put it this way, I know that some of you are a little 
older hands, you’ve done a little hypnosis before, but more for the 
beginners as well, just realize this:  you can do all this after one day.  
You’ve been doing this for how many hours?  Not that many, right?  
One day and you’re doing stuff that most hypnotherapists are 
afraid to even try to do.  Right?  Are there any hypnotherapists in 
the room?  People who were hypnotherapists before this?  Would it 
be fair to say that most hypnotherapists are afraid to even try these 
things in case they might fail or something?  And you’ve been doing 
them without thinking about it. All right?   
 
So at some level, you have a very advanced skill set that is not 
common in the industry.  And I want you to appreciate that when 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
174 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
you go out there and start doing stuff tonight.  All right?  In fact, 
you may as well reach over and pat yourself a little on the back and 
go, “Well done me.”  Right?  So who feels good about this whole 
thing?  Yeah?   
 
So here’s what we’re going to do in a moment.  In a moment we’ll 
split you up into groups again, and we’ll go out.  We’ll go out on The 
Strip tonight so you get the experience of The Strip at night.  It’s a 
little bit different to The Strip at daytime.  You can use similar 
locations. There’s lots of places I’m going to encourage you to stop.  
I’ll speak about some in a moment.  And essentially, you can do 
anything you want.  You can do the exact same drill you did this 
morning when you went out at lunchtime, where you hypnotized a 
couple of people in your own group.  You can go up to strangers 
and try out the whole system.  Right?  If you don’t feel quite ready 
for that yet, then you can just do your own group and invite people 
in, do a little hybrid in between the two.  Honestly, I don’t care.   
 
I will encourage you, though – I will ask you to do at least one 
complete set piece from start to finish, at least with your peers 
from this seminar but out on the streets where other people can 
see you.  All right?  If that in itself is enough, shall we say of 
stretching yourself and challenge, that’s all you can handle, that’s 
fine.  This is not a race.  You don’t have to do all of this at once.  
Right?  If you can do that, then I know you have the skills that, over 
time, you’ll be able to do it anywhere as well.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  That’s just a question of getting accustomed to 
it and so on.   
 
If you do want to challenge yourself, then just invite someone into 
the group and work with them.  I know about half of you have 
already done so over lunch break.   
 
If you want to challenge yourself even further, then start playing 
with the approach, and remember the key to the approach is a 
friendly, relaxed attitude, and it’s not wanting anything from them.  
You should have about as noncommittal an attitude as you do when 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
175 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
you ask someone the time.  That’s it.  That’s really easy to do isn’t 
it?   
 
Do you guys have any questions about anything you’ve done so far?  
So I had a little chat about places to go, and this is for you guys in 
the back as well, for the assistants.  I understand most of you were 
out – just outside the hotel there’s a nice little area there with lots 
of people moving around.  Is that correct?  Yeah? So feel free to try 
that again, if that’s still happening and buzzing, fantastic.  Right?  
When you head out of the hotel and turn left down The Strip – 
Really, what I would suggest to you is just stay with your group 
leader so your groups stay together, but the other groups can carry 
on going past.   
 
Whenever you see an area which has high traffic, in other words a 
lot of people walking around, and it’s not too narrow, then you 
might as well stop and start playing there.  Right?  Because you just 
want attention.  That’s really all you’re looking for.  The most likely 
spots you’ll find, as you walk down this way, you’ll get to a little 
casino/hotel called The Imperial. And right in front of it is a whole 
bunch of little shops and little rock bars, and they have live music 
and so on.  At this time of night, that’s going to be a really cool 
place to be, lots of people.  There’s lots of little bars there.  There’s 
lots of music.  It’s a real mini gathering-type place.  You will have to 
work with music, though, with loud music.  All right?   
 
So for those of who are interested in working in general bars and 
club atmospheres, that’s a great starting point because it’s not too 
loud, but you still have to contend with the music.  So those of you 
who like that – Let’s actually do it this way.  Which of you assistants 
likes the idea of working in a louder venue?  Right.  Ahmed, do you 
want to play this venue?   
 
So Ahmed, if you just stand over by the water cooler.  Anyone who 
likes the idea of working sort of a louder venue because you want 
to end up doing this stuff in bars and clubs, place with louder music, 
please go and stand with Ahmed over there, who is just standing by

the exit.  There you go.  You already have a volunteer right?  Just go 
up there and then grab him.  Because that’s really, in my opinion, 
the best place for that.  It’s not too noisy, but it’s going to have a 
nice umph to it.   
 
Then, if you carry on – Let’s try to think.  If you look as you come 
out past the, before the hallway, if you look over to Treasure Island, 
there’s these big pirate ships outside of it.  There tends to be a 
bunch of people collecting around there.  It’s time-based, so have a 
quick little scan over there.  If they’re not there yet, then just carry 
on.  Outside Caesar’s Palace is always a good place.  There’s a big 
set of shops there.  There’s lots of glamour, lots of lights going on.  
That’s a good place, so you can keep an eye out for there.   
 
Who was outside Bally’s earlier on?  So I recommend you go 
somewhere else, just to have a different experience, but you’re 
welcome to go back to the same place.  Right?   
 
But outside of the Bally’s hotel it’s, again, it’s a great area.  Lots of – 
And right now there’ll be a lot of traffic.  The adult expo has just 
started, so there’ll be a lot people going to that or coming from it.  
If you want to do street hypnosis in the adult expo, you have to buy 
a ticket.  It’s $40 bucks but feel free.  Just go and, I guess, enjoy the 
evening there at that point, as well.  If you’re going to leave the 
groups – Go ahead.   
 
Audience Member: What about Bally’s security hassles?  
 
Igor: 
Yeah, okay.  In terms of security, let’s just handle this just 
straightaway.  As a rule, it’s open territory and so on.  You can kind 
of go wherever you want, but security guards seem to extend their 
area of authority, so whatever.  In my opinion it’s very simple, go to 
these places, have fun.  If the security starts giving hassle, “Look, 
we’re just having fun.”  If they’re being a little bit – If they’re 
pestering you, just move on somewhere else.  It’s no big deal.  
Right?  Vegas is a big, long place, so just enjoy yourself.

Anthony: 
Watch when there’s a big event on 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
Be respectful. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  The key thing here is just don’t become a pest.  Don’t block 
up entrances.  Don’t do anything like that.  Other than that, just 
have your fun, and it should be straightforward.  
 
Anthony: 
Keep in mind you’ve got another day of training tomorrow.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
And you’ve got another outing somewhere completely different. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, tomorrow night we have a really special place planned for you 
guys. 
 
Anthony: 
If you have a couple of experiences tonight with different people, 
that would be good.  Just try to push things a little bit further than 
you did at lunch.   
 
Igor: 
So other nice places, Planet Hollywood has a great area outside 
with lots of shops and so on.  At this time it gets really busy.  
Bellagio right outside by the fountain, there’ll be no situated guards 
there because that’s on the main street and that’s a phenomenal 
place.  Everyone stops to look at the fountain, especially the show.  
I think it’s every half hour or so, should have a big crowd at that 
point.  So that’s a great place.  You could probably have at least two 
groups there.   
 
If you want to enter a hotel, feel free to do so, just remember the 
rules: avoid the casino areas, stay to the food courts or the 
shopping areas, and be polite, be respectful, and if the security 
guards get a little bit uppity about it, it’s no big deal.  Just move 
along and we’ll find somewhere else.  Okay?

Street Hypnosis State Control & How to                
Amp Up a Watching Crowd 
 
 
State Control 
 
Igor: 
I’d like to spend a few minutes just talking about your experiences 
last night, the highs and the lows.  Then we’ll throw it open to 
general sort of Q and A session.  So you can kind of mix and match 
them if you want and then what we’ll do after that is we’ll start 
taking the performances you did yesterday.  I will show you how to 
refine them so that we can fix a lot of the common mistakes that 
people make.  So when you go out later on today, you’ll go out as a 
completely different hypnotist.  Does that make sense to you guys?  
So to start off with, we only have one mike so please do come up or 
put your hand up so we can kind of pass the mike around.  What I’d 
like to do is just get some experiences from the things you had 
yesterday or the things you saw; highs and lows; even if you have 
questions, you can ask them now.  This is the time to ask them 
because we’ll be doing stuff.  So there’s a question back here by the 
water fountain. 
Audience Member: Is it on?  Hello? 
Igor: 
Yep. 
Audience Member: I had a question about like when we go out there, last night for 
example, there were two of us that were walking around and we 
wanted to go out there and practice but then the doubts kind of 
started creeping in.  Is there any way I guess to put ourselves kind 
of like in an instant power state?  I know everything but then it’s 
like “oh well, uh”. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
179 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Well there’s a couple of things that this brings to mind.  The first 
one and especially if you’re out with a buddy which I think is a great 
idea, is rather than doing negative emotion to each other like “oh 
I’m nervous.”  “I’m nervous too.”  You do that.  No you do that.  No 
you do that!  Right?  It’s the natural trend.  I understand because 
I’ve kind of been there as well.  You can build each other up by 
having fun.  It’s hard to have fun when you’re forcing it.  So the 
simplest way of switching the whole mindset I’ve found is through 
performance.  When you start doing things, it automatically kicks in 
all the emotions and all the things you’ve learned in here.   
You’ve basically recreated this.  So one of the simplest ways of 
recreating the feeling – by the way does everyone feel good in here 
when they’re doing hypnosis and stuff like that?  Do you feel good 
about that?  So the simplest way to recreate that is you’re with 
your buddy, he’s a little bit nervous, you’re a little bit nervous; 
rather than saying “you go and talk to them, I don’t want to talk to 
them.”  Right?  You just say “okay, come up here, stand up, put 
your hands like this.”  Right?   
You’re now into performance mode.  It switches your mind into a 
different 
gear 
automatically 
because 
you’ve 
had 
enough 
experiences here to do that.  Does that make sense?  And then 
everything else comes flooding in.  Once you’re having fun with 
your friend, well it’s easy to turn around with that momentum and 
go somewhere else.  The next thing I’d say is do a mindset.  In other 
words part of the fear comes, and this is where the personal power 
stuff we talked about comes in.   
Part of the fear is because you’ve invested your identity in whether 
or not you succeed in that interaction.  Does that kind of make 
sense?  So if that person rejects you that makes you worthless.  
That’s kind of the equation people have inside of the mind.  My 
value only comes from you liking what I do.  Now is that a recipe of 
wanting something from someone or for someone. 
Anthony: 
 
From.

Igor: 
So the irony is the very fact that you need this person to be wowed 
by what you do or accept what you do is gonna create the very 
circumstance which will stop that from happening or they will just 
reject you out of hand which will create a self fulfilling prophecy 
where your value goes spiraling down, down, down.  So I 
recommend that you find lots of things in your life where you are of 
value, right?  A friend of mine has literally learned about kindness.  
He’ll walk through a, he’ll drive through a toll booth and pay for the 
guy behind him, right?  He’ll be in a restaurant and he’ll pay for the 
meal for the people next door, right?   
Just because then when he really messes up, he turns around and 
has all these memories of doing really nice things or kind things for 
others.  So if someone says “go away from me your horrible 
pervert”, right?  He goes “I don’t care.  I do lots of good things.”  It 
doesn’t affect him as an individual anymore.  Does that make 
sense? 
Audience Member: It’s not so much that for me because I feel that I have value and I 
don’t feel that I have to derive value from other people.  It’s more 
like I guess for example in the Chicago training, for two weeks after 
that, I was me, like the real me.  Then like my family environment is 
really like “rahr” and I guess that kind of triggers that sometimes 
when I’m out there. 
Anthony: 
Well what do you think is driving your anxiety when you’re on the 
street?  Is it doubt?  Is it fear?  What do you think is driving it? 
Audience Member: Not really doubt because I know I get this stuff because when I flow 
in with friends like when we’re back home and we’re having fun it’s 
awesome. 
Igor: 
May I take a guess at this because this is something I’ve seen a lot?  
Let’s put it this way, when you’re in here you feel a certain way 
right?  When you do your exercises you’re fantastic and you enjoy it 
right? 
Audience Member: Yes.

Igor: 
Now when you go out, you don’t quite feel the same way.  Is that 
correct? 
Audience Member: Right. 
Igor: 
You see a lot of people, and this is very typical when it comes to 
approaching your work performance whether you’re doing work on 
a stage like a stage hypnotist or a trainer or something like that, it’s 
called being in state.  So you want to be in the right state to do the 
performance.  So you need the feeling first in order to be able to 
perform well and if you don’t have the feeling, what you have is 
called a dissonance.  I know this wonderful person I am when I’m 
feeling great but right now I’m feeling kind of mellow and quiet and 
there’s a disconnect.  If I try and be this person at once, I can’t be it 
yet because my gears haven’t revved up properly.  Does that make 
sense? 
Audience Member: Yes. 
Igor: 
And that can create a negative spiral because when you’re 
comparing yourself to who you want to be but you’re not feeling it 
right now, that distance it creates, gets larger and larger and larger 
because you’re pushing harder and harder and harder for it.  Does 
that make sense?  The easiest way to collapse that, is not to care 
about how you feel at that point in time.  I’m not saying you 
suppress your feelings.  Please don’t misunderstand that.  If you’re 
feeling a little vulnerable, that’s okay as long as you think “well you 
know what?  I’m just going to walk up to them and what I’m gonna 
do is get like maybe a finger vice and I’ll walk away.”   
So you’re not looking for anything in particular as a result.  I’m not 
looking to wow them.  I’m not looking to get effect.  I’m not looking 
to have a great time.  You’re not looking for the emotional hit in 
other words.  The irony is it will come anyways.  So now you’re 
looking to have the emotion first and then the experience.  You’ll 
have the experience first and that will trigger the emotion.  Of 
course you can always cheat and get your buddies to hypnotize you 
and have a little anchor for good feelings as well but I think 
psychologically speaking, the idea that you should always be on the

up; you should always be this person is a really bad idea because 
your whole body and mind, everything goes through cycles; goes 
through rhythms and to be this shining star all the time, it’s 
impossible to maintain.   
I can’t teach for six months in a row.  I’d burn out.  I burn out after 
ten days.  I need a break somewhere along the lines because I can’t 
be this version of me all the time.  It’s impossible, right?  So to the 
extent you’re trying to be that version all the time, that’s not 
possible.  However, if this version of you can do all the same things, 
then you don’t need this one.  You’ll enjoy it when you are but this 
one will be just as good at doing Street Hypnosis.  Does that make 
sense to you guys? 
Anthony: 
You’re question was can I change state.  You know the answer to 
that question.  
Audience Member: I guess it all comes down to each person anyway. 
Anthony: 
You’re surrounded by hypnotists and I totally understand what 
Igor’s saying about just pushing for the up state and trying to deny 
that you have other feelings going around your body is ridiculous 
but just do some basic anchoring.  Get someone who knows what 
they’re doing to take you for a parts reframe on that feeling.  You 
don’t have to understand it.  You don’t really have to know what its 
history is but you can change it and you can be without it and again 
that doesn’t mean you have to be fired up to maximum the whole 
time.   
It just means you’re no longer feeling the anxiety.  I know for me 
even now when I perform or I’m gonna do something like this, 
there’s normally a moment the day before where I feel, it’s just 
adrenalin.  You can call it anxiety if you want and there have been 
times where I have.   
I used to make the mistake of trying to cram learning into that.  I 
really need to learn my lines.  I’ve got to get this down.  Nothing’s 
going in so it’s highly obvious because I’m in the wrong state.  Now 
when I feel that, even if it’s Street Hypnosis, even now you’ve got to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
183 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
understand we’ve had some projects that’ve been really important 
to us and we’ll be asked questions like “can you turn all the lights 
off in Canary Wolf?  Can you break into the building and get the 
M.D.’s financial details off our computer system?”  Essentially using 
hypnosis to engineer that.  Of course I haven’t done that.  Of course 
I feel “oh God, I’ve just said yes again!” but now rather than trying 
to suppress that in any way or trying to kind of cover it with 
learning, I just accept it as adrenaline.   
I just think “this is what my body does.”  I just sit back.  Now if I was 
to hold a piece of paper up like this, I’m sure it would be shaking 
and quivering but I just accept that’s what my body’s doing.  That’s 
not the time for learning.  So I just let it fill up with adrenaline.  
There’s a natural adrenaline cycle.  It has to subside and as soon as 
it subsides, I think, I’m full of adrenaline now. 
Igor: 
Ironically, that very thing is what makes you do a better 
performance when you get there.  So if you accept the fact that “I 
don’t know about this”.  You do it anyway.  Stuff that’s coming out 
and you don’t know where it’s coming from, the unconscious or 
whatever you want to call it but you’ve created the ideal 
circumstances to do a better job.  Experience is going to be a really 
big part of that. 
Anthony: 
It is. 
Igor: 
The more you do Street Hypnosis, the more you’ll get to the point 
where you go “you know what?  I’ve felt this before and I did it 
anyway and it worked out just fine.  So it’s not a big deal.  I’ll do it 
despite the way I feel.”  Not that I’m rejecting the way I feel.  I’ll feel 
this way and I’ll do a great job anyway.  That’s kind of the mindset.  
Does that kind of make sense to you? 
Audience Member: Absolutely it does. 
Anthony: 
You’ll hear me taking pot shots at NLP now and again.  As an 
industry, as an industry that because of trainers and trainer’s 
trainings and master trainers trainings, just tends to separate and 
either become squeezing out the hypnosis which has happened 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

systematically since the late ‘70’s because no one wants to fail or 
put themselves in any position of risk; or by over complicating it 
and adding more and more complexity to it.  That’s why Igor’s 
products are good because I’ve heard, from what I’ve listened to; 
they are kind of true to those original principals about attitude.  The 
rest of it is the trail of techniques.  Now I use those techniques but I 
don’t have a lot of the hang-ups or complexity that some of the NLP 
trainings bring.  As far as I’m concerned, basic anchoring will work 
for you.  Using a rewind technique for fast phobia cure will work on 
that problem.  So when I need that, I just do it.  I just set an anchor.  
I just run it through a rewind technique in my own head and I just 
assume it will work.   
Yes, when I’m standing there five minutes before I’m going to go on 
stage and I’m feeling pumped again.  I’m feeling adrenaline again 
but I trust implicitly that when I walk out there, that the five 
minutes work I did in my head is going to have the desired effect.  
My body will respond appropriately and anyone can do that. 
Igor: 
And if you’re going out with another Street Hypnotist well what’s to 
stop you from right there in the street saying “hey I’m feeling a little 
low.  Can you like give me a gift?”  Now not only are you getting the 
personal benefit of that like a little bit of instant therapy on the 
streets, but you’re also creating the very context that will get all the 
people around you to go wow, so that when you wake up you go 
“hey thanks that’s pretty good.  If you want to feel this good come 
over here.”  They are going “me?”  Do you see how that works?  
Use everything you have in your favor rather than to get yourself 
pulled down and ultimately, don’t take any of this too seriously.  
Really, it’s far too important to take seriously. 
Anthony: 
Any other questions?  Go ahead. 
Audience Member: My personal anxiety stems out from the fact that I’m actually trying 
to do this for the benefits of someone and for some reason I have a 
feeling especially before the performance, what happens if it 
doesn’t work because I want to help someone.

Igor: 
Okay so again, this is another example of wanting something from 
them rather than just for them and here’s what I mean by that.  If I 
need Anthony to feel better so I can feel good about the work I’ve 
done, I need something from him don’t I?  I need him to feel better.  
If I just really want Anthony to feel great but if he chooses that he 
doesn’t want to feel great, let’s say he wants to be grumpy today, 
then I’m okay with that, right?  It’s his life.  He gets to choose it.  I’d 
still like him to feel great but if he doesn’t have that, it’s not gonna 
affect me.  Do you see the distinction?  So I understand exactly 
where you’re coming from because if you care for people and 
you’re being respectful of them and so on, then you really want 
them to experience the positive power and so on.  Ironically, it’s 
wanting that too much; it’s kind of like the Eastern idea of 
attachment.  You want it too much and you get attached to it, now 
you need something from them which is to feel good so you can 
feel good.  They will sense that and that kind of creates that 
downward spiral both for you and for them.   
The opposite however, is you really want something for them and 
you acknowledge and I think this is the only respectful way of 
treating other human beings, that if at this point in time they really 
don’t want it, that’s okay.  That’s going to be their choice, right?  So 
if I was doing hypnosis with you and it screws up for whatever 
reason, I’m like “okay”.  Either I carry on with my personal, actually 
my personal reaction would be “I’ll carry on working with you in 
lots of different ways that I can think of until the point where you 
get so annoyed with it that you don’t want to play anymore” right?   
That rarely happens because usually I’ll find some other way to get 
in, or if it’s more like a Street Hypnosis situation, I’ll just switch my 
attention to someone else, right?  Because something that works 
very well is if I’m working with someone and something’s just not 
quite right, then I’ll just switch to your friend over here.  He has an 
amazing time and that has completely reframed you without me 
having to do a single bit of work.  Then you say “what about me?”  
Oh yeah, I forgot about it.  Come here, let’s carry on where we left 
off, and it takes care again.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
186 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So that’s where lot of these subtleties that we’ve been kind of 
hinting at and playing with and kind of demonstrating start coming 
out; but ultimately the mindset has to be and let me reinforce this, 
those of you who have trained with me hypnotherapy are called the 
H+.  When I do hypnosis believe it or not, I cannot do hypnosis 
when I think normally.  I have to switch my mindset and there’s two 
things I do in my mind.  All of you have been doing it to some 
degree.  Number one, I switch on this intense desire for the other 
person to experience hypnosis, right?  So I actually kind of go into a 
trance myself.   
If I look at Anthony right now and I switch it on, I can’t help it, just 
by looking a certain way, I have people.  I have this intense desire 
that you are going to experience hypnosis and it’s an amazing thing, 
right?  It’s so intense in my mind that I literally forget that not 
experiencing hypnosis is an option.  Does that make sense? 
Anthony: 
The only other thing I’d say – 
Igor: 
Let me just finish the second half.  And the second half is an equally 
important thing, whilst the reason I want them to experience 
hypnosis is because I really want them to experience how great it 
feels because I’ve been in there and I would like for him to 
experience it.  Now if he doesn’t want it today, that’s okay.  I don’t 
mind but I would really like for him to.  So you can say no but I can 
say “just think about it.  Just try it on for size.  You know what?  Just 
try a little bit and if you like it, you can have a whole one.”  It’s 
difficult for me to put into words the actual attitude but hopefully 
you get a sense of what I’m talking about here and that takes care 
of that needing a response versus wishing a response for them.  
Please, carry on with – 
Anthony: 
That’s obviously why I decided to accept your invite.  Just a couple 
of things, I’m into holding positive representations of the person in 
front of me; however true they are or not.  I think I first had that 
illustrated in Training Trances.  It’s a book I recommend everyone 
gets.  It’s more geared toward therapy stuff but it’s just awesome.  
When you’re dealing with a therapy client, they encourage you to 
just understand that somewhere in the back of that person’s mind; 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
187 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
they absolutely know everything they need to know about their 
problem.  Somewhere in there they have all the resources they 
need to change and they have the ability as a human being to get 
hypnosis and you hold those thoughts.   
Sometimes people will come in and they are challenging them 
because they appear to look after nothing, no aspect of themselves 
or their life but somewhere in there, there is a blueprint for health 
and for good living and thriving.  That’s what I’m trying to appeal to, 
but your question was what you do when it goes wrong.  You 
should examine that.  You should think “what’s wrong?  At what 
point am I making a decision this has gone wrong?”  I think it was 
you or somebody else that I was explaining to yesterday.  It’s not 
that I don’t fail.  It doesn’t mean every person I see gets to 
hallucinations and I’m invisible and this kind of crazy stuff.   
It’s just for me hypnosis, as I said, is not about achieving trance or 
changing state.  That stuff is good.  It’s a nice metaphor or process 
and relationship between me and the person I’m working with so 
it’s not, I don’t know it’s not fail based.  It’s very rare that I walk 
away from a situation thinking I failed that.  That’s because of this 
process.  The technique is that simple.  That the vast, vast, vast 
majority of people are gonna get it.  Now how I frame that and how 
much value I squeeze from that is gonna dictate how many kind of 
exit points I have where I could walk away and still think I did my 
job.  I’m just, when I work with someone and call a volunteer up, I 
have an idea where I’m going to go.   
If I think it’s gonna collapse or there are signs of that, that they are 
not going to get a hallucination then I have to step back through the 
way we ran the phenomenon yesterday and just end on something I 
am certain is going to happen.  Or I can just reframe it for them to 
not get amnesia because everybody is sticking to other stuff but I 
don’t need to go out and think it worked or it didn’t work.  Yes, I 
think that I still want to make it work, but I’m going take the person 
as far as they are capable of and understand that in this hypnotic 
relationship we often assume that they don’t go where you want 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
188 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
them to go then they will likely blame you thinking “he’s not a 
hypnotist, he’s not a hypnotherapist.  He can’t really do it.”   
And if a Stage Hypnotist takes off and leaves with ninety percent of 
his audience feeling that way, because the hands didn’t stick - but I 
find that in a more intimate, one to one, or small group for 
hypnosis; understand that it’s about their capabilities and you kind 
of drawing that out for them.  The vast majority of people who 
don’t get it are disappointed because they didn’t manage to do it.  
They’re not looking; they’re not saying bad things.  They’re saying 
“why can’t I do it?  What’s wrong? 
Igor: 
So be kind to them and let them know that they could.   
Anthony: 
I’m afraid that you’re going to see magnetic fingers again.  The 
reason you’re going to see it again is because there’s so many other 
ways you can take it and if you know, what gives me comfort when 
I’m doing impromptu hypnosis, is I know that I can just do that and I 
can entertain for a few minutes.  I can turn up, say who I am, do my 
job and walk away and actually what I’ve achieved is that.  I was 
sitting and thinking, none of these people are gonna be capable of 
taking this further at this moment in time; in this mood; with this 
hypnotist, but I just move on.   
Igor: 
By the end of today by the way we will have made sure you have a 
lot of sure fire ways of creating something which is impressive even 
with very simple results.  Some of which might even be cheating!  
So this idea of getting out is kind of important.  It’s kind of a balance 
point; wanting something for them rather than from them but also 
making the most of what you’ve got.  That’s really part of the skills 
of a hypnotist is what did they give you?  Just go with what they’ve 
given you rather than what you are trying to impose upon them and 
then that way you just run with where their mind is going rather 
than where your mind wishes it were going, make sense?  So we 
have one question here and then we’ll have some questions up 
front as well.

Troubleshooting H+ 
 
Audience Member: You talk a lot about the H+ and also sharing, sort of going into a 
hypnotic state when you’re working with someone.  What if you 
cannot go into that hypnotic state purposely or actually being led 
into a hypnotic state? 
Igor: 
Sure that’s actually very easily dealt with because the only way you 
couldn’t do that is if you were dead.  Now you may not think that 
the trance that you have is good enough.  That’s very common 
because you might not recognize it when it occurs but then you see 
you’re creating a different kind of trance for yourself at that point.  
One in which you’re telling yourself that the current experience 
you’re having is not the one that you want or the one that you need 
shall we say; whereas the exact opposite is true.  The very thing 
that you’re doing where you’re thinking to yourself “I don’t go into 
trance” and you sit there and say “look, my hands are warm enough 
for, my physiology isn’t changing enough and so on.”   
That is a form of self hypnosis that keeps you at a different level 
than one that you think would prove to yourself that it’s a trance.  
Does that kind of make sense? 
Audience Member: How do you get rid of that doubting Thomas? 
Igor: 
Now that is a much better question.  It really is.  It is a much better 
question.  The first thing to realize is that you’re still alive.  You’ve 
got a pulse; you’re breathing.  That means at some level your mind 
has more than one way of functioning, right?  You fall asleep at 
night and you dream, right?  Everyone does, so you have the 
capacity to change states.  Now if you’re at a point where you’re 
trying to change state on purpose but you’re having doubts, then 
you actually are changing states just not in the direction you want.  
When you’re having those doubts, one thing is for sure isn’t it?  
You’re not in the same state as when you’re not even thinking 
about it, are you?  Hence you already have succeeded, it’s just in 
the wrong direction so then you can do a couple things.  I’ll give you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
190 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
a small answer to a bigger question if I may.  Number one is you 
could just switch off the inner voice or dialogue of doubts.  Would 
you like a very quick way of doing that?  Okay, I’d like you just very 
quickly to count out loud from one to five. 
Audience Member: One, two, three, four, five. 
Igor: 
Easy to do right?  Now in a moment I’m going to ask you take a 
deep breath and I want you to lock your breath so, you know like 
lock your throat up so that no breath can come in or out.  Can you 
do that?  Hold it, now try and count from one to five.  Do everything 
but no breath can come out.  Go ahead.  That’s right so what you 
experience is silence.  Now here’s the interesting thing, when you 
can do that kind of naturally physically, it teaches your mind how to 
do the same thing mentally because your mind learns most easily 
from the physical world because it is relatively stable and you can 
reproduce the same effects inside your mind.  I’m not sure if you 
have enough experience to do this yet but you may as well try.  Try 
and hold your mental breath now and count mentally from one to 
five.  Notice how much quieter it gets.  So now, there you go. 
Audience Member:  I was still able to do it unfortunately but I need practice. 
Igor: 
Exactly then it’s just the question of creating the connection 
between practicing holding your breath physically and not being 
able to.  That creates the metaphor for your unconscious.  As soon 
as this becomes, the physical version becomes natural to you then 
suddenly the mental version will become as easy because you have 
a connection to make.  It just you haven’t gotten the experience of 
it yet because you have a lifetime of not doing it.  Does that make 
sense?  You need to re-sensitize yourself to the nuance of what it 
feels like to have a silent mind.  It’s the simplest way.  There are lots 
of other ways by the way, it’s not the only one but it’s the simplest 
answer I can give you for right now.  Does that help you? 
Audience Member: Yes. 
Anthony: 
Wait, just a couple of comments.  I’ve been training people for 
about ten years because I run a hypnotherapy training as well and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
191 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
on our courses we have, bit like this one because we have this 
practical aspect where you know it’s coming.  You’re gonna have to 
go out there.  You’re going to have to face the public and do it.  
Obviously there are some people throughout the course who say “I 
haven’t been hypnotized.  I don’t think I’ve been hypnotized.  I’m 
not getting it.”  Now when we’re trying to learn this, I find that 
there is this little bridge to cross and some people get it once 
they’ve had the big experience themselves.  They’re cracking up 
laughing.  They can’t lift their hand.  They realize they’re awake and 
a lot of the misconceptions they’ve had fall away and they stop and 
say “ah, that’s it!  That’s the experience I’m giving people!”  And it 
becomes easier but for some of us and I count myself in this 
number and I’ve been doing this a long, long time, I hadn’t had any 
of those experiences.   
Amnesia, Vince claims he made me forget my name once but it just 
wouldn’t come out.  The point is that for other people on the 
course who aren’t naturally gifted, somnambulists, or naturally 
highly hypnotizable people or whatever you want to call them, like 
me, the only way you’re gonna get it is by hypnotizing people to 
your satisfaction; to the point where you step back and you think 
“Jesus, this person is definitely hypnotized.”  You absolutely 
understand.  This is not a classroom situation.  There’s no cameras 
rolling but they are completely foxed by what you’ve created and 
that then, that’s what helped me.   
The other little bit of advice I’d give you because I’m not big on 
theory, certainly not pushing theories upon people.  There are four, 
five, maybe six core theories about how hypnosis works.  I’ve 
believed in one or more of them more or less over the years.  
However, you may just need to extend your model.  You may be 
looking for trance where there isn’t any.  You may be trying to 
figure out this critical faculty when in fact it doesn’t exist.  It can be, 
they can be useful metaphors, conscious, unconscious, and trance 
and depth.  It can all get you there.  You can learn hypnosis and you 
can absolutely believe in that model or you can reject all of those 
models as I do and you can still be effective at it.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
192 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So it may just be that the trance model is not the best model for 
you to understand because you’re looking for this altered state.  
The fact is anyone who has been there, even these people who 
have been on stage and clearly look hypnotized, understand they’re 
still there.  They can still hear.  They can still see.  Everything is 
normal.  There is just one belief that seems to be shifted at that 
moment. 
Igor: 
If you like to have a sense of what my and this is going more into 
the personal power thing, what my experience of hypnosis is when 
we talk about the H+, would you like to have a quick exercise of this 
everyone?  Yeah?  Just think of it in this way.  Don’t think of it as 
hypnosis or anything that is associated to that because as Anthony 
was saying there’s a lot of things building up, a lot of assumptions 
we bring in with that which aren’t necessarily useful or true.  What 
I’d like you to do is go ahead and look at the chair in front of you or 
some object in front of you; something that you are not connected 
to and I’d like you to stare at it intently.   
Now there’s something I did once as a kid and unfortunately it 
didn’t work but one day it might.  I want you to stare at it so 
intently as though you could feel if only you stared at it hard 
enough and willed enough you could lift it up with your mind.  Now 
if you succeed, I’ll be really impressed.  Whether or not that thing 
lifts up is irrelevant.  I don’t care about that.  It is the intensity 
inside your mind as you look at that object over there and you just 
will it to lift up.  If only you put enough effort into it, it will lift up.  
You can almost feel it.  And there is an absolute intensity and there 
is no room for any other thought. 
When you’re ready just bring yourself back.  Let that intensity just 
fade away.  Now you’ll notice that something starts happening in 
the room as you did this.  I’ll mirror it for you if I may.  You’re all 
sitting here like this.  We start talking about the kind of special 
focus we just talked about and all of you did this.  Then I asked you 
to stop and all of you went like this.  Now this is a very good sign.  If 
you’re doing that it’s actually just part of the way biomechanics

work and is how your mind and your body are linked.  It just shows 
that you were concentrating on the right kind of level.   
Now you may have noticed that when I start doing hypnosis with 
people I don’t do this.  I do this.  Do you have any; is there any hints 
as to why I might be doing that?  So don’t think of it as an intense 
trance that you hypnotize others with.  Just think of it as intense 
and all the rest takes care of itself.  Does that help you guys?  Yes?  
So microphone over here in the front, come on over. 
Audience Member: All right I have a very quick question.  I was just wondering because 
personally I found setting up the context was the hardest part.  The 
actual doing of it was pretty simple. 
Igor: 
Securing hypnotic context with people? 
Audience Member: Yeah, creating hypnotic context outside in the environment.  So I 
was just wondering if today we were going to go over more 
methods to create the context or if we should just refine what we 
learned yesterday? 
Igor: 
We will definitely be trouble shooting some of the major things. 
Anthony: 
It’s right there.  The 12:15 session is all about frames and context. 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
Audience Member: All right so we will be working on that. 
Anthony: 
That’s what today’s about. 
Audience Member: All right very good.  Thank you. 
Audience Member: Can I just run down real quick some practical problems I had just in 
like a half a sentence.  All I want is like a quick answer.  Then if you 
say we’re going to cover it later, that’s fine.  So I’ve got about nine 
things that happened hypnotizing in the streets.  Okay, I can’t be 
hypnotized.  It’s impossible to hypnotize me.  I tried magnetic 
fingers and hands and of course they don’t work.  Okay, I want to 
see what it looks like first. 
Igor: 
Great, carry on.

Audience Member: Their friend getting louder or talking louder and I’m saying to other 
sounds, they are talking louder.  She’s not hypnotized, everything.  
Okay even one of the other hypnotists talking louder to her friend 
to get her attention, okay?  She’s faking from the friend.  Okay 
intensification procedures, I mean deepening intensification, eyes 
open, eyes closed stuff.  Arms only going up fifty percent of the way 
and then stopping and them telling me later “well I didn’t really 
want it to go all the way.  I wasn’t sure”, this kind of thing.  Okay?  
Spontaneously waking up, coming up out of trance.  Are you 
supposed to reinforce it or re-intensify?  You know what?  The 
volunteers, they aren’t getting any applause.  Like what’s the 
behavioral positive modification?  No one is applauding.  What 
about fingers, hand, should we hand lock them and then if they 
don’t hand lock go on?  That’s something we aren’t doing.  And also 
I really just to practice I want to set up a table in a park at home 
alone and do a street demonstration.  The thing is a typical busker 
is gonna demonstrate what they do first and people can see and say 
“yeah, okay” and they pay for it.  So what are, how are you going to 
demonstrate by yourself, alone? 
Anthony: 
Can I bash at some of these things?  Let’s just go through the list 
and trouble shoot.  We may as well. 
Audience Member: So like a juggler in the park can show what he does or a musician or 
what have you.  I was wondering about the impact of our Street 
Hypnosis experiences thanks to having cameras there.  There are 
people who are attracted to the cameras and I think that helps. 
Anthony: 
Yeah totally, it’s so much easier.   
Audience Member: So it’s sort of like to take what he’s asking.  I’m sorry I don’t know 
your name and intensify it by saying “well what if you don’t have 
cameras present?” 
Igor: 
Well we’ll cover all those things in point.  I think those are excellent 
questions well worth answering; aren’t they folks?  So let’s just 
start at the top of the list because I think the first couple were 
actually the same question.  Do you want to pass the microphone 
back here again?  We’ll come to you in a minute.

I Can’t be Hypnotized 
 
Audience Member: First one, a nice lady watches.  I say “come on we’re gonna be 
hypnotized, come and have an experience” and she says “oh I can’t 
be hypnotized.  It’s impossible.”  And then she wouldn’t bring her 
fingers together. 
Igor: 
Excellent, no I understand that’s part of the frame that she’s stuck 
inside.  So a couple of quick ways of dealing with this; number one 
it is a mindset that you have to break, right?  So you can’t persuade 
her that she can be because that’s just going to create more clash.  I 
can’t.  Yes you can.  No, I can’t.  Yes you can.  I can prove it to you.  
All right prove it to me.  That’s the conflict that you’re creating.  
What you need to do is introduce doubt as to how she knows.  
You’re creating doubt as to her reality.  Does that make sense? 
Audience Member: Yes. 
Igor: 
And I’ll give you, there’s many ways to do this.  The hypnotic 
reversal is one and all kinds of stuff but a very simple way of 
creating doubt is ask them to justify the statement.  “Oh really?  
How do you know?” 
Anthony: 
How much do you know about hypnosis?  You’re an expert on 
hypnosis? 
Igor: 
Right.  Oh you know I went to a stage hypnotist once and he did this 
funny thing and it didn’t work.  Oh I see, it’s kind of like saying I 
went to a doctor in Mexico once and he had no idea what whatever 
it was, which means that the hospitals in here can’t help me out 
either can they?  Well maybe it was just a bad doctor.  You think?  
Do you see where the implication is going on here?  It is possible; 
I’d just go with a rapid reframe to kind of hammer it in.  You’re 
telling me it is possible that there are hypnotists out there who 
aren’t really that good and if you met one of the really good ones it 
might just work.  Is that what you’re saying?  Okay you’re willing to 
find out how good I am.  Do you see where I’m going with this? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Anthony: 
He’s just trying to turn it from I can’t be, to I might be or I don’t 
think you’ll be able to – it’s the same thing.  Personally I wouldn’t 
proceed until I’ve at least gotten to that point.  I’ve got nothing to 
prove.  If you want to have a hypnotic battle, she will win.  I find 
that kicking the legs away from a lot of their misconceptions early 
on does that.  That to me, I can’t be hypnotized; there is no way 
that can happen might be born of ten attempts on stage and it’s 
never happened for her.  It might just be that mostly people believe 
exactly that because they’re seeing something so phenomenal that 
they just couldn’t imagine how that could happen.   
So I personally would not even be at this point until I at least got 
some shift in her stance.  That could be “look, there’s nothing to 
believe in.”  Whenever somebody says “I don’t believe in hypnosis” 
I say “there’s nothing to believe in.  It’s not a religion.  It’s just a 
process I’m gonna take you through.  Everyone can do it who’s even 
got an average level of intelligence.”  Just to completely say you’re 
looking in the wrong place here.  You need to understand a little bit 
more about what this is and then if I get to this exercise the frame 
might be to illustrate what this is.  What hypnosis is and it applies to 
the other question of I’d like to see someone else getting 
hypnotized.   
If you haven’t gotten that luxury, I’d like to see how it works first.  
Then I’d say “look, I’ll show you how it works.  I won’t hypnotize 
you.  Put your hands out in front of you and I’d do exactly the same 
thing.”  The frame being I’m going to show you how this works 
before I get to the hypnosis.  So I’ll just, any objection that comes 
up, I just aim to kind of, without getting into a lengthy theoretical 
discussion, I steam roll it as quickly as I can in a sentence and find a 
reason to pull them back into my process and the process can 
explain anything, illustrate anything. 
Igor: 
One thing just to tack on.  I agree with everything.  Speed is of the 
essence there.  If you spend half an hour trying to persuade this 
person, not only have you killed the vibe of the whole thing; you’ve 
put too much effort into it which means it’s proving that they were 
correct in the first place.  Does that make sense?  It’s kind of a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
197 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
weird kind of unconscious assumption.  So speed is important.  Now 
one thing you may find happening that even though you’ve set the 
reframe ahead of time and you’ve come to justify what hypnosis is 
but really they don’t know.  Well if you don’t know what hypnosis 
is, how can you not go into it?   
That’s actually really powerful and most people, they just can’t 
handle it and that’s good.  Now what will happen, what can happen 
and it’s not infrequent either is once they’ve accepted the 
possibility of hypnosis, the opening door, the wedge but they’re still 
using their assumptions to check back on what hypnosis is.  This 
happened to me in London.  One of the students there was doing a 
stiff arm with someone and the guy said “look I can bend it.  I can 
bend it.  Look I can bend it.  Look I can bend it.”  Then he would say 
something else then he would stiffen up and say “I can still bend it.”   
Can you see where the pattern is going on here right now?  What’s 
he doing?  He’s testing for failure isn’t he?  He’s testing for failure 
before he’s had a chance to succeed yet.  See how that works?  And 
that’s the part of the mindset, that’s part of the reason this didn’t 
work because she’s constantly testing for failure rather than testing 
for success, right?  There’s the opposite reaction.  “Oh my God, my 
arm’s feeling weird!  It must be working.”  They haven’t tested it yet 
but they are already looking for success.  Do you see the 
fundamental difference in the mindset?  This is very important 
because you will see it somewhere on the sliding scale of a two out 
there on the streets.   
Most people will be somewhere in the middle towards the testing 
for success side; but your example was one tested for failure.  So 
what you must do at that point is you must put the testing for 
failure on hold.  You don’t have to get rid of it.  You just pause it 
long enough to actually have an impact.  Does that make sense to 
you guys?  So a simple way of doing that and please, this is 
something we could spend probably two hours talking about, the 
nuances.  This is a principal that you can elaborate upon.  Is that 
okay with you?  So a simple example of what you can do to pause 
that is something as simple as the word yet.  Look I can bend it.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
198 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Look I can bend it.  Of course you can bend it.  We’re not there yet.  
So just put your hand out for a moment and make it strong.  Now 
don’t test it yet because we’re not there yet.  This isn’t hypnosis.   
We’re just starting something.  I want you to notice, then I make 
like an association.  I want you to notice the arm, that arm over 
there as you feel good inside your body and maybe your mind floats 
out and looks at that arm as the body continues to feel great 
because we’re not there yet.  It’s not gonna be locked yet but it’s 
beginning to lock.  Do you see where we are going with this?  So 
you have to put that testing mechanism on hold and then at some 
point you actually, you’re asking “okay, okay, now how’s the arm 
feeling?”  “It’s weird.”  It gives me that opening wedge because I’ve 
got him to test for failure, or for success.   
He’s told me that he’s testing for success even though I haven’t 
asked him to test it fully yet.  If it said “I can still bend it.”  I know 
I’m not there yet.  Does that make sense?  And that happens 
several times.  So how does your arm feel now?  Well I can still 
bend it.  That’s right, we’re not there yet but how does the arm 
feel?  Do you see where I’m constantly moving his attention 
towards?  It’s kind of a little bit of non awareness going on.  So 
that’s a mindset that you need to look out for but again just to 
reemphasize what Anthony was saying.  That’s not where I start.   
The starting point has to be I’ve got to drive a wedge into the belief 
system into what hypnosis really is and I’ve got to do it quickly.  I’ve 
got to get them to accept the possibility or the fact that they really 
don’t know what hypnosis is and whatever they thought it was 
might not be it.  As long as I have doubts, I’m not good to go yet. 
Anthony: 
 
Yeah, yeah, yeah and just, she may just really not get it. 
Audience Member: No, I think she was quite proud of the ability not to be hypnotized. 
Igor: 
You see, the way you steal it is to make her proud about succeeding 
in hypnosis, because that’s a challenge frame.  “Oh I can’t be 
hypnotized.”  “That’s such a shame!  Really, do you know how much 
you’re missing out?”  “What do you mean?”  Do you see where we 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
199 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
are going with this?  So this is where you have to be a little bit of an 
amateur psychologist and just you’ve got to know where the value 
is, the motivation people have so you can use that as leverage for 
whatever frame is presented and so on.  Does that answer your first 
two questions? 
  
Noises & Distractions 
 
Audience Member: Yep, first two; let’s see what it looks like, okay, friends getting 
louder and louder. 
Igor: 
With volume it depends on what the context is and I’m sure you 
have lots of experiences with this as well. 
Anthony: 
Just say no outside sound will bother you; you can be aware of the 
outside sounds; nothing matters now, just the sound of my voice. 
Igor: 
That’s the classic one and also remember if the friends are there 
what can sometimes happen is a dynamic where you have a joker in 
the pack who likes all the attention and all the attention is on you, 
so they get louder and louder to try and pull attention in.  There’s 
two things you can do with that.  One is you can recruit that person 
as an assistant because now he gets the attention he craves but 
now instead of being louder and louder and interfering with it, he 
gets the attention he craves by helping you.  Does that make sense?  
The other way you can do it is, it’s not as nice, but if he is really 
interfering with the process, you need to kind of get him cut out of 
the group.   
In other words you get the rest of the group on your side and they 
will put that person in check because they’re interfering with the 
show essentially.  It’s kind of like you’ve paid a 100, 200 dollars to 
be in a Vegas show and some drunk idiot is in the front heckling 
you.  You go “will you shut up?  I want to watch the show.”  So 
that’s kind of what their friends will do to them.  I use it as a last 
resort.  I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it.  Usually the simplest 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
200 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
way of dealing with that is right up front as a pre-frame saying 
“okay guys, come in close but keep quiet because this person really 
needs to concentrate.  So let’s really help them out with this” or 
something like that. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, you can do it in your set up and suggest it.  The final thing you 
can do is and this relates to one of your other questions when their 
friends want attention, is just call it.  Call it to an end and point out 
not to make the person feel bad but almost to make the others 
want it more.  You just do your wake up and say thanks.  I think 
your friend is getting a bit excited there so we’re just gonna move 
on.  Just put it that way and then they’ll say “no, show me how to 
do it.  This time I’ll shut up!”  They will do the job for you.  They’ll 
say it for you.  So sometimes I’ll do that especially if they’re poking 
them in the ribs; kicking their feet under the table.  I’ve had all of 
that.  It’s just like “what are you doing?”  Part of it is they can’t put, 
sometimes it’s innocent.  They just can’t quite accept that their 
friend is having this experience. 
Igor: 
They are so excited by it and then you can actually take it and 
recruit them and say “look, just pause for a minute.  You can do all 
the poking and prodding you want later on; just give them a chance 
to get there.”  Then it’s really dramatic.  Say you do something 
simple like an arm levitation or a stiff arm.  Can I see your arm for a 
second?  If you have someone with a stiff arm like this, if nothing 
else, this is when we come to the milking thing, people’s jaws will 
drop when they come up to their friend and they say go ahead and 
touch it.  They will go “really?”  No really push it and he’s like “it’s 
so strong.  It’s so rigid.  How did – oh my God!”   
And then they freak out because now they’re involved in the whole 
process, they’re part of it, whereas before they are going like “is he 
in trance?  Is he in trance?”  Whereas you say “just wait a second 
and you’ll get a chance to experience this.”  Then you’re directing 
their reaction to increase the hypnotic affect because they will be 
like “my God, something really weird is going on!  Fred doesn’t 
normally have his arm this way!”  Then they feel amazed.  The 
person in trance has an indirect confirmation of the hypnotic

phenomenon which means he’s going to respond more powerfully 
and the whole thing becomes actually a great benefit to you rather 
than a hindrance. 
Anthony: 
One other point and again this will cover another one of your 
questions is just to pull that person into your routine just like Igor 
said and touch them.  That’s the sense of – 
Igor:  
 
You’re recruiting them. 
Anthony: 
Yeah you recruit them but sometimes I’ve done this many times, is 
you just, especially if you’ve gotten to the point where you know 
this person is hypnotized; they are ready to go; they are doing your 
routines; and this person is now disrupting your performance.  You 
just set that hypnotized person onto them.  You just say “what’s 
your favorite dessert?”  They say “chocolate fudge pudding.”  You 
say the moment your eyes open, the person standing in front of you 
is the world’s tastiest pudding and just bam!  Set them off and that 
will soon shut them up!  Make sure you say “but you won’t bite.” 
Igor: 
You can lick but don’t bite! 
Audience Member: These were two blonde young women and one was obviously the 
alpha chick and the one hypnotized was the beta and the alpha one 
just got louder and louder and louder and louder. 
Igor: 
It has to do with social dynamics right?  So you have to recruit that 
person to be your assistant. 
Audience Member: I like that. 
Anthony: 
I’ve said this before, you’re eyes will open; the person standing in 
front of you, you’re in love with the person in front of you thinking 
they are the most beautiful person on the planet and really I’m 
flattering, the annoying person and they just step into it and just 
smile at their friend because they are just loving it. 
Audience Member: So the she’s faking, that covers the same thing. 
Igor: 
Jonas what did you want? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
202 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: Also the routine that I’ve used is where.  He makes the person that.. 
Igor: 
Do you want to take the microphone so we actually have this on 
tape? 
Audience Member: The dynamic I’ve used in the routine where somebody is interfering 
with the work they are doing that they actually make him become 
the hypnotist and the suggestion telling them that this person now 
is also the hypnotist and when he says sleep you will go back to 
trance 100 times deeper and so on.  Then you take him aside, take 
the other person aside and say “Now, look at him.  Look at his eyes, 
tell him to take a deep breath and when he breathes out say sleep.”   
Anthony: 
Yeah give him the power. 
Igor: 
It’s another form of recruiting, exactly.  So does that principal make 
sense to you?  This says you either recruit them onto your side by 
flattery; by getting him to do something involving them; or you 
exclude them from the group, getting the rest of the group to 
ostracize them because they are essentially heckling.  And then the 
third version which is a very, would be the first thing I would go for 
as well which is you make the problem stimulus actually a deeper.  
Classic one was a hypnotherapist we had building works right next 
door to my office one day, so a big jack hammer was going brrrr.  I 
could barely hear myself talk that is how loud it was so the only 
thing you can do at that point is just accept it and say every time 
you hear that jack hammer you can just demolish that problem 
even deeper, right?  Brrrrr. And deeper. Brrrrr. 
When it started you could see them beaming and when it stopped 
you could almost see them getting disappointed because it was so 
good beating up their problem, right?  So you are recruiting the 
stimulus at this point rather than the person. 
Audience Member: The intensification, in other words you talked about count down 
five to one but you might have to use others correct?  I mean you’re 
not trying to say it’s the only thing that works. 
Anthony: 
When I first do stage hypnosis I dropped everyone on the floor, 18 
bodies and I walked around for ten minutes counting down, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
203 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
deepening, comforting, reassuring, blah, blah, blah.  They were out 
before they even hit the floor.  My dad was standing up in the 
balcony and you could see their faces.  They were already locked up 
and it was all over.  My deepening on stage is probably now a 
minute or two.  My deepening and impromptu situations, to be 
honest is a few seconds because I don’t believe in depth, so it’s 
pointless. 
Audience Member: You must believe in intensification. 
Anthony: 
Sure.  What I want for intensification, the process of intensification 
for me is gonna be born of them experiencing the sense of 
involuntariness as I take through the phenomenon.  So basically for 
me it’s sleep, close your eyes, deeper and deeper, as I rock your 
shoulder you can continue to relax.  Every word I say, every breath 
you take, every outside sound will send you into a more and more 
relaxed state of mind and everything I say will become your reality.  
That is the deepening.  That’s as much about some process and 
giving them things that are kind of familiar.   
I might say deeper and deeper a few times but the very next thing I 
do and as quickly as I did it with every subject who I’ve demoed 
with up here is to test my work.  So in a moment I’m going to touch 
the back of your hand and it’s going to start to feel light.  It’s going 
to lift.  It’s gonna do this.  It’s gonna do that.  Now from that point 
on every phenomenon that I’ve managed to get out of the person is 
going to intensify it and that’s gonna happen naturally because they 
are having a bigger experience but it’s also gonna happen because 
every single time something happens I’m gonna say “when that 
happens you can go even more deeply relaxed when I say one, two, 
wide awake.”   
If you were going to pick some specific techniques then I think ten 
to one can be a very long count.  Some of the imagery stuff you do 
down steps, lie on the beach, down the woods, this kind of stuff can 
just be a bit too much.  Some people aren’t visualizing that well so 
you’re actually losing that relationship you have with them.  So I 
just think things like things like a pretty rapid count geared towards 
them being more excited about finally going through that zero or 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
204 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
finding that profound place; selling it, by dictating their emotional 
response.  This will be a blissful feeling.   
This may be more relaxing than anything you’ve experienced 
before.  Open up the possibility that this could be an intensive 
experience and then kind of physical intensifiers, again, all classic 
kinds of things that have been around for decades or probably 
centuries, you probably see me doing it.  This arm can relax, 
completely relax and I, the other fractionation is kind of built into 
my technique by running through these exercises as inductions, 
fractionations built in but fractionating with the eyes is awesome.  
People seem to respond.  Part of that for me is just because you 
build the expectation that the effect will be a more intense 
experience.   
In a moment I’m going to ask you to open your eyes and then close 
your eyes.  When I say open your eyes, your eyes will open, you’ll 
look up.  When I say close your eyes, your eyes will close and you’ll 
become twice as deeply hypnotized, twice as deeply relaxed.  Open 
your eyes; look at me.  I’d just wait for like half a second of re-
orientation and then bang, just put them back in.  What I’m looking 
for again are more of those signs that each time they’re physically 
giving in a bit more.  Their breathing’s shifting a bit more.  I’m now 
getting some eye fluttering, REM.   
I’m trying to feel more confident about their abilities but I don’t 
think, just like there’s no killer induction, there is no killer 
intensification technique.  It’s about your intent and the ideas 
you’re putting forward.  It doesn’t matter what you actually do.   
Igor: 
We’ll be coming onto fractionation today as part of what we are 
doing later on today.  So rest assured I think that is about it and 
then the key thing to take out of what Anthony said there and this 
is the key of any form of hypnosis, every success builds greater 
success.  When they respond to one suggestion, it will intensify 
their response to the next suggestion which is why I used to have 
this greater response.

You have no brainers for them to respond to, then you have simpler 
ones like this is a no brainer to respond to.  This one is a little 
harder to respond to but then because they’ve responded to this 
one, this one takes more and so your responses intensify with each 
success that you create.  If you’ve ever had a quote, unquote, 
failure, you just wash, rinse, repeat.  You go back to your previous 
success.  You emphasize that because now you’ve got a success 
point and you go back to whatever you’re building up towards just 
more slowly or by a different route, shall we say.  So you’re always 
building success.  At that point the idea of depth really is of no 
importance.  It’s just a question of are they responding. 
 
 
Increase Applause 
 
Anthony: 
Sell it, make it feel good.  It covers your other question about no 
one was clapping.  You haven’t set it up.  My first stage show went 
really well; got loads of people up; did every routine I wanted.  I got 
to the end of the show and I looked at the audience and oh I forgot 
you were there.  I hadn’t had one applause cue written into my act 
and I’d love it to just be spontaneous.  There was loads of laughter 
if you listen to it but I’ve never cued them and said “look they love 
your attention.  Applause is your friend, blah, blah, blah.”  Once I’ve 
said that just like here if I say when you wake up you’re going to get 
a massive round of applause, who am I actually speaking to?   
It’s not the person in the chair anymore is it?  You’ve been given a 
little task there to do but it’s a nice group task and it’s not that hard 
to do.  Set it up in your pre talk and in a moment when I wake you 
up, you’re friends will give you a huge round of applause because 
you’re such a sport and then they’re used to it.  Then each time 
they will just feed them.

Igor: 
A great place to learn this is just go to see some of the shows, 
especially here in Vegas.  They have built in an applause thing.  I 
saw one a few days ago before we started this seminar and one of 
the little sketch, mini acts in between was these body popping guys 
doing interesting stuff.  It was so different from the rest of the 
show, the audience looked shell shocked but they were so good 
that it was actually built into the routine.  The whole – they’re body 
popping away and then one guy freezes and the audience was like - 
what the hell do we do with this?  He looked up, opened his eyes 
widely and went – exactly.  Everyone knew exactly what to do and 
they went wild at that point so, that’s all you have to do.  You have 
an effect.  The guy’s stiff arm is there, stiffer, and stiffer.  You can’t 
bend it.  You try.  Put your hand over there, pull it over, try and pull 
it.  It’s like exactly,  
Anthony:  
Show me some love.   
Igor: 
You have to, especially during Conversation Hypnosis on your 
audience to let them know it’s appropriate to interfere now.  Does 
that make sense?   
Anthony: 
A couple more and then we’ll be done 
Audience Member: I was just going to add a comment to the applause actually.  I find 
from the stage shows that I’ve seen in general and even just from 
the ones that had positive reactions yesterday to negative reactions 
is very much about the pre-frame like when you’re actually doing 
the hypnosis itself; constant positive reinforcement of the people 
like saying “that’s right, perfect”.  It gives the audience an idea that 
“oh we’re doing a really good job here.  This is something to 
watch.”  And also if you talk in a more theatrical way and really 
present to the audience, like you get the audience in there in the 
first place, when you say “come on give them a hand” or you do 
that action like that, it’s already pre-framed in their mind that “oh 
this is the perfect time clap”; just like any good performance 
they’ve ever seen. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, once you’ve set it up once, it just rolls.

Igor: 
Now just one thing additionally, do you guys want to know a simple 
way to cheat, to get thunderous applause from people?  This is 
taken back from like a couple of centuries ago.  It was all the rage in 
theaters especially in France.  There was actually a profession that 
got people to applaud in theaters and depending on what kind of 
applause you wanted on a sliding scale, you paid more for a little 
golf clap; for a standing ovation it was a huge fee and so on.  These 
people were called claquers.  Basically what they did was they 
stood up and they modeled to everyone else what was expected.   
If they just wanted a little gold clap, they would go and then carry 
on and everyone else would slowly take off, right?  And you can try 
this by the way.  Go to a show and do this.  Then sometimes for a 
standing ovation it started like that and then get up and clap like 
this and everyone is going “yeah he’s right, we’re gonna clap like 
this too.”  Either you can have friends in the audience who start 
clapping, so that makes life really easy.  So today when you’re out 
you’ll have friends.  If you guys watching his show start clapping, 
everyone else will start clapping, so be nice to them.  You can do 
this to yourself as well.  Let’s say you go back for classic effect, you 
do the stiff arm, it’s going like that and you can’t bend it no matter 
what happens you can’t bend it.  Try, try harder, look how hard he 
is trying, isn’t he doing a great job.   
Anthony: 
Just ask for it. 
Igor: 
You’re showing them the response.  In fact all of you experienced 
this yesterday.  We had a little many trance induction in here at one 
point and had some Q and A sessions so you guys were in, should 
we say in the afterglow of trance and I think you were doing 
something with them at that point.  I think it was the finger vise, I 
can’t recall anyways so we get up and I say (single hand clap) “okay 
guys it’s time to do an exercise.”  All of you start clapping for no 
reason at all.  Seriously!  Do you remember that?   
Anthony: 
We did, it was so cool at the time. 
Igor: 
Watch the video.  You all started, it was exactly the same thing.

During that point their mindset is a mild trance and the audience 
will go into a trance with you if you’re performing to the audience 
rather than ignoring them, so something as simple as (single hand 
clap) “right, what do we do next?”  They’ll start clapping and if they 
start doing it, carry on!  Yeah, you’re right and encouraging it that 
way.  These are all performance skills by the way.  These are things 
that you will learn more of as you go through but really go out and 
go to theaters; go to watch players; go to watch shows and you will 
notice the dynamics in the room and then you can start playing 
with them.  If you stand up and give a standing ovation, see how 
many people stand up with you.  Does that make sense?   
That will give you a feel for these things and if not just do it on the 
streets and you’ll get a good feel very quickly. 
Anthony: 
Make sure you tie in a gesture too.  Once you get it, make sure you 
tie in a gesture. 
Igor: 
This will become the starting point for it all. 
Audience Member: Always do the same thing? 
Igor: 
Yes just do it the same way.  Have you ever seen Tommy Cooper 
the crazy magician from the UK known for doing bad magic?  He 
would fill theaters up and down the country for forty years 
consistently, would come out on stage and sort of fumble around 
and then pull his little face and that was it.  That was his cue for 
laughter.  Lots of comedians do it, just have that look and that’s the 
cue and they do it every time even though their jokes are funny.  
They still have to cue it.  What’s next? 
 
 
Depth of Trance 
 
Audience Member: I think one part that I’m conflicted with but I know is when you said 
depth.  It’s not about depth and especially in a therapeutic context.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

When I watch you guys do this fast, I don’t understand what’s 
happening.  If it’s not about depth, what is happening? 
Igor: 
Can I give you a quick model and I don’t know if you’ll agree with 
this or not.  Tell me if you agree with this.  You don’t have to.  You 
may not.  People traditionally thought the idea of depth was you 
start here; you go all the way down to here.  This is deep trance, 
this is light trance and here you can have little light effects like the 
sound of a bee going around.  Here you have deep effects like 
amnesia and here you have pain control and so on.  The problem is 
people don’t respond to this model.  They respond differently.  The 
way I envision it is this, we have a little conscious blip in the middle 
of potential, shall we say, right?   
This is what we are currently aware of every day.  Now everything 
you do in everyday reality, if intensified looks hypnotic.  For 
example, have you all ever had a little paper cut and not known 
that you had a paper cut until a few hours afterwards.  Suddenly 
you go “oh wow!  That hurts!”  Anyone ever have that?  Or a bump 
and a bruise from a sporting match and it wasn’t until you noticed it 
that it started aching but then you got really focused on something 
and it didn’t hurt anymore because you were too focused.  Would 
that be fair?  Well what is that if not an example of pain control?   
You intensify your paper cut thing and you have full blown 
anesthesia.  Would that be fair?  Let’s put it this way.  Let’s have a 
look at the idea of the classic one, car keys.  Anyone ever lost their 
car keys?  Or my favorite one, I did this the other day, I’m looking 
around.  I can’t find my glasses, can’t find my glasses.  “Where are 
my glasses?”  “They are on your face.”  “Oh yeah!”  Right?  Would 
that not be a mild example of a negative hallucination which 
incidentally is harder to get than a positive on, right?  So then it’s 
just a question of intensifying a response that’s already there.  It’s 
built into us.  We’re doing it every day.   
Now sometimes what happens, in my opinion, or this is how I 
currently cut the pie up, is that certain abilities, let’s call this hyper 
amnesia; the ability to remember things very accurately or 
regression say.  We don’t have a direct access here, for whatever 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
210 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
reason, there is a little block.  So sometimes it helps to go to some 
intermediate step here and bounce across it another way because it 
is just wired in a slightly different way for some individuals for 
whatever reason.  Does that make sense?   
So you can lead to this bigger thing through some other thing that 
you go at in a roundabout way.  Classic example would be 
dissociation.  Everyone has felt like a little bit like they are not quite 
there, like you’re not quite with it today.  You know what I mean?  
That’s a mild disassociation.  Now in an extreme case you’ll feel, 
you can feel as though it’s not even your body, like you’re watching 
from the corner of the room this body doing something.  A lot of 
performers like boxers for example will often talk about how they 
are floating above the ring watching the body doing the boxing.  
Does that make sense? 
That’s a classic disassociation, about as strong as you can get.  So 
sometimes you can see already how if you’re not in your body, it’s a 
lot easier to jump over to not having pain or sensation.  Do you see 
how that works?  So the idea of depth is irrelevant.  What is 
relevant is what is the experience they are having and can you 
magnify the experience to become strong enough for whatever 
effect it is you need?  Whether it is therapeutic or not and this is 
why by the way every good hypnotherapist I’ve ever met or read 
about, even Erickson has said this, there is absolutely zero 
correlation between depth of trance in the classical sense and the 
therapeutic impact that you’re interaction has.  Does that help you? 
Audience Member: It helps me.  It’s like when I started using H+ depth didn’t really 
matter to me anymore but this seems to be out of – 
Igor: 
It’s the same, believe it or not in my mind it’s actually the same 
thing.  The H+ all it is, it’s a magnifying glass so that this thing here 
becomes more intense.  What Anthony is saying, and Anthony is 
going to have his own way of saying it and I’ll shut up in a minute; 
but how I would say we’re doing Street Hypnosis and my perception 
of what Anthony is talking about and how I think when I’m doing 
these things myself is very simply, each time you have a suggestion 
take effect, it intensifies something in general.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
211 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So then when you go into this thing here, it automatically goes to 
the next level and this one here becomes more intense again and 
this one here becomes more intense again because the magnifying 
glass is still getting larger.  It’s just you’re switching between normal 
responses that become abnormal because of the intensity of the 
focus on them.  Does that kind of make sense a little bit?  Hence, 
we go through an escalation.  We warm up with little simple things 
and become more and more intense and the speed of it, well that’s 
the speed of the mind which can be very fast.   
I think someone talked about point two of a second or point one 
five of a second, something like that is the processing speed of pre-
consciousness?  So it can literally take a fraction of a second to get 
all the way to hallucination if the person is already primed in the 
right way. 
Anthony: 
Yeah a couple of things, most of us via training, via reading have got 
this concept of depth on board.  I’ve done my induction now, now I 
need to take the person deeper, all right?  How are you gauging 
how deep they are at that point?  Just probably guess work.  Well 
I’ve done an induction; therefore they are still sitting there.  They 
are still looking relaxed.  There are loads of processes of deepening.  
There is some good science with regards to hypnosis and a lot of it 
is with regard to having people who aren’t that good of subject, 
better subjects.   
If you’ve got a depth model as part of your theory about how 
hypnosis works then if you say deeper, deeper, deeper, however 
you say it, you’d expect to make better subjects.  Science doesn’t 
support it.  If expectation is the core of your model then the more 
you build the expectation, the more you think you’ll be able to 
transform bad subjects to good subjects, you can’t.  It doesn’t stand 
up.  It doesn’t work.  There are lots of these metaphors that once 
we – if you see them as anything other than a metaphor, an 
attempt to describe something that is essentially mental and 
therefore invisible; it can be useful but the moment you really 
believe the metaphor but you still can really test it, it’s not so 
useful.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
212 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So the bit that I agree with up here is that I think depth doesn’t 
matter.  It certainly doesn’t matter to me.  I can’t gauge how deep 
somebody is, right?  If I was to, I’m not going to do this right now, 
but I know if I was to suggest to Kristin that she couldn’t lift her 
hands up, just with a question.  I know they’d be stuck.  Has she 
suddenly gone to a deep level where she can experience?  She’s 
halfway down the chart?  No, it’s because I’ve tested something.  
What I’ve tested is that I’m gonna give her an idea.  I’m going to 
present an idea to her and what will make this hypnosis, is how she 
experiences that event.  The classic suggestion effect in hypnosis for 
the last 200 years is experiencing things with a sense of 
involuntariness.  Ask people “what do you think hypnosis is?”  “Well 
that’s where you make people do things and they can’t not do it.”  
This is this classic suggestion effect, right?   
So all I’m attempting to do is and you said it all seems to happen 
quite quickly.  I don’t quite know what’s going on there.  From the 
moment I begin even with my approach, as far as I’m concerned I’m 
giving suggestions.  I’m presenting idea and I’m just ticking them off 
one at a time.  When I’ve done my induction and it might seem to 
kind of escalate quite quickly, I’m doing exactly the same thing.  I’m 
just saying now your hand is going to do this and you’ll experience it 
in this way.   
They may not be the words I use because I may not make it that 
obvious but the depth as they experience more and more of these 
things with this feeling that’s entirely involuntary, they become 
more absorbed in the experience; and that absorption to me is, or if 
you like, the quality of the sense of involuntariness about the 
phenomenon that are occurring, is the equivalent; is the useful kind 
of equivalent of depth.  So what I’m trying to do is not make them 
deeper by taking them more relaxed or giving them even more of 
an expectation.  All I’m attempting to do is get you to do stuff and 
get you to experience it with greater and greater and greater sense 
that this is happening automatically.   
When you think it’s happening automatically, a lot of that chatter 
that’s going on about is it working?  Am I lifting it?  I don’t want to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
213 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
make him look stupid.  It’s just, a lot of that falls away and it’s 
replaced with “shit, it’s lifting!  I can’t move it.  There’s nothing I can 
do about it!”  And suddenly you’re on my side because you’re now 
giving those kinds of auto suggestions and driving a response.  
You’re driving the automatic nature of it.  So I’ve met hypnotists 
who’ve said “I can look at anyone and tell at levels one to thirty 
where they are at.”  Great, you must have some great sense that I 
haven’t got.   
How do I know if the person is where I want them to be?  Simple, 
are they responding to my ideas?  Are they doing that on cue; as 
close to instantly and immediately without any interference as 
possible?  Excellent, then I’ll give them another idea.  So depth has 
its uses, but it’s fallen out of my model.  I’ll say deeper and deeper, 
it’s just a suggestion.   
Igor: 
Consider it a stabilizer. 
Anthony: 
When I say sleep, it’s just a cue.  Very often people take that 
suggestion to sleep but it’s no different from stuck or frozen or 
wake up.  It’s just an idea.  It’s definitely not sleep so I don’t, the 
model doesn’t change from the moment I say “can you place your 
feet on the floor” to “I’m invisible”.  As far as I’m concerned, I’m 
doing exactly the same thing.  I don’t believe the person is in a 
unique altered state.  There is no research really that encourages 
that idea to stand out.  There aren’t the unique brain signatures for 
hypnosis that cross all of the phenomenon so I can’t stand by state.  
I can’t stand by depth.  They are useful metaphors if you want to 
use them. 
Igor: 
Does that help?  Just to kind of emphasize something and I think 
Anthony will agree on this one as well, which is all these models, all 
these, whether it’s trance depth or its contra-conscious words, play 
acting or all these other things, all these hypnosis models have their 
uses, right?  While someone may not believe in the 
conscious/unconscious mind as a thing, it’s very useful to me to 
think of it in that way while I’m actually doing hypnosis with 
someone because it allows me to operate in certain ways.  It gives 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
214 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
me a sense of stability in a very otherwise random environment.  
That will work.   
The problem comes when the particular method I’m trying to use 
isn’t working.  Then I’ll use another model.  For example, I’m not 
much one for believing in things like magic but sometimes I will 
happily believe in a magical universe because it gives me a better 
result with the person.  Who knows how that works?  So let’s just 
finish up here and then we’ll have a break. 
 
 
Troubleshooting Trances 
 
Audience Member: Just three real quick ones; so one is the problem of only fifty 
percent arm levitation.  That happened yesterday and I turned it 
into catalepsy but the friend kept shouting “he’s working awfully 
hard to get that arm to go up.” 
Igor: 
Two things with that, number one is her friend was reframing it, 
right?  As opposed to saying “you’re telling me your friend walks 
around like this all the time does she?”  Right?  So in other words 
this is already a result and that’s more than enough.  The second 
thing that tends to happen and I’ve had very similar experiences 
when you suggest arm levitation because of this experience, this 
movement here is driven by the elbow, right?  So the experience is 
being intensified, they are being absorbed in is that of the forearm 
muscles or the bicep or whatever it is tightening to lift that.  Now 
this has a limited range.  It can’t go much more than this.  You never 
talked about the shoulder lifting.  You never talked about the elbow 
leaving the body so they’ve actualized your suggestion verbatim but 
they haven’t gone beyond.  They are struggling to get it higher but 
they can’t because the wrong musculature is working 
Audience Member: That’s exactly right. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
215 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
So then you start talking about and the elbow can loosen up.  The 
elbow can be part of the whole thing.  Your whole shoulder lifting 
higher and higher and now you have the proper motion in place. 
Anthony: 
I just find when you are building responses, the reason I have lots of 
ideomotor stuff and catalepsy in my work is because that’s what I 
use in therapy.  These tiny little movements in therapy are like 
massively, massively impressive to the client.  Much more so than if 
they come to a stage hypnosis show, so I use them every day as a 
means of communicating and running my therapeutic techniques 
and insuring that they are done and the responses start like this, 
they start with a finger twitch and then the wrist might begin to 
move.  All I’m trying to do is keep driving this with just a logical 
description and we’re going to talk about linking eventually.   
We should have by now, but linking one thing to another just like I 
illustrated with a phenomenon yesterday.  So I just say finger 
twitching lighter and lighter as they sit on that cushion of air 
beginning to be pushed up towards your face.  As they twitch, you 
may notice your wrist lifting, forearm lifting, elbow bending.  That’s 
right, up toward the ceiling.  That’s right; you’re noticing it in your 
wrist now.  Your wrist is starting to go.  I don’t know if it will be your 
left hand, the other finger, or the other hand that starts, just keep 
putting ideas there off each one, adding, not saying it is happening 
now but saying, linking as if it is about to begin.   
So as the wrist lifts, that’s right, forearm lifting and elbow bending.  
I wonder if you can try and keep that elbow on the chair as it lifts 
even higher and just keep hitting them with the idea.  Like I said, 
you understand the physiology of the body.  I could see you 
nodding when Igor said that.  Yeah, of course that’s what 
happened.  You didn’t drive it into the next – 
Audience Member: So the literalness of hypnotism, it was literal.  I said “your hand 
moved to your face.  That’s as far as it could go.” 
Anthony: 
Yeah of course. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
216 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
That’s actually because that’s the only motion that can go there, 
right? 
Anthony: 
But again, the other thing, you also said fifty percent.  Understand 
for me, that is one hundred percent.  That is a hundred percent.  
That is a hundred percent.  I just want the idea to be interpreted 
and if that’s how it manifests then good that’s what I’ll use. 
Audience Member: Okay the only other, spontaneous wake up during the street 
performance, popping out of trance. 
Igor: 
What makes you think that they quote, unquote, woke up?  Or let 
me put it this way; I’m in a trance let’s say like this.  I do this and I 
do this, did I go in and out of trance? 
Audience Member: So I get the feeling that if they start giggling, I know you’re allowed 
to laugh when you’re hypnotized but somehow it makes me feel 
like they are not in trance if they start giggling. 
Igor: 
So in other words because no one that Anthony was working with 
was laughing hysterically or laughing like a pig or policeman 
because no one does it in trance do they? 
Anthony: 
I know what you’re saying. 
Igor: 
A lot of the things you think might be someone popping out of 
trance may just be spontaneous phenomenon occurring and that’s 
how we know they exist.  Catalepsy, the only reason we know it 
exists is because people would spontaneously go into catalepsy 
sometimes during trance inductions in the old merry days, right?  
So now hypnotists are suggesting it to get it again.  So the giggling 
fits; the eyes opening and closing; all these different things have 
nothing to do with whether or not they’re in trance or responding.  
The only one acid test you ever ask yourself is “are they responding 
to your suggestions?”  That’s it.  So when the eyes are open and I 
really want to emphasize this to all of you guys here.  Do not 
assume that they’re not in trance and the reason for this is, oh well, 
it didn’t work; off you go.  You’ve left them in a mindset where they 
are just absorbing suggestions from their environment.  That’s a 
bad thing.

Anthony: 
This is really important.  The situation is a process relationship or 
state situation you described is gonna happen.  People say “sorry, 
I’ve lost it now.  I can’t do that.”  I’ve been giving people 
suggestions and they are just like “no, no” and they still carry out 
the suggestion.  If you hypnotize me and give me arm levitation, I 
will be laughing.  I will be giggling.  You won’t have to suggest it.  I 
find it amusing so that will put off a beginner.  There’s various 
things you can do.  If you think, if something’s disturbed them, it’s 
just starting working and they’ve got this overwhelming sense that 
this is just too weird or whatever.   
Someone has kicked them or a bang has gone off or whatever and 
it’s “what is that?  I’ve lost it.”  There’s different things you can say.  
The first thing you can do is just pace and lead.  In therapy if 
someone is sitting there and then they open their eyes, it’s a very 
simple line.  Say “that’s right; you can open your eyes.  You can re-
orientate yourself to the room and you can close your eyes and just 
go deeper than you were before.”  It works every single time. 
Igor: 
Just keep running smoothly. 
Anthony: 
That’s right; you can open your eyes.  You can look around; you can 
re-orientate; now close your eyes and go deeper, deeper down. 
Igor: 
Just to add something which Anthony was already talking about, 
just to emphasize it I think.  Sometimes people will need to orient 
because something has changed in their environment and they 
need to stay safe.  So you may have noticed on the streets 
yesterday you’re working with someone like this; a crowd starts 
gathering.  They feel someone has stepped close enough to them, I 
don’t know if they feel something or hear something, so they’ll do 
this to check what just happened.  It doesn’t mean they’re out of 
trance.  It’s a normal safety response which is appropriate so then 
you just take it and run with it.   
That’s right all these people are there and you’re safe, everything is 
fine.  Go ahead and close your eyes and notice how much safer it is 
with your eyes closed and they can just disappear in the distance.

It’s just you and I and this experience that matters now.  Does that 
make sense? 
Audience Member: Yeah, perfect. 
Anthony: 
Again that’s one thing.  Another thing you can do is just say “that’s 
right, just look at me” and do an instant induction.  You don’t have 
to start at the beginning again just say “that’s right, just look at me 
again” and just put them straight back in with an induction.  Test 
your work by giving a suggestion that you know will occur.  If 
they’ve already done physical stuff, do some more of that and just 
the health and safety thing about waking people up.  Again very 
often you get into phenomenon.  You’ve got some laughter going or 
some emotional shift and then it fails at amnesia and then they say 
their name and people kind of think “sorry”.   
I can tell you everything, I would always insist on just saying “look, 
you may not even thing you’ve been hypnotized but I’m just going 
to wake you up properly.  Can you just do this for me?  Put your 
feet there, close your eyes.  Sleep and I’ll then do a one to five wake 
up.”  Is that absolutely necessary?  Yeah. 
Igor: 
With all the suggestions, absolutely, especially the amnesia one. 
Anthony: 
All the silly stuff gone, exactly the same wake up.  Is that absolutely 
necessary?  Does it mean this person if I don’t do it, they will be in a 
trance forever?  No, I don’t believe that at all, but from my own 
perspective of just covering my own backside in terms of doing the 
job properly, then I would still go back and do a full wake up on 
anyone that I’ve worked with, yeah. 
Igor: 
So just assume that as soon as you tell someone that you are a 
hypnotist or suggest something similar like a mind specialist or 
whatever it is, assume that they are becoming increasingly 
suggestible at each point.  So whatever you will say will have the 
force of suggestion and whatever you have said unless you want it 
to stick, you need to cancel before you end the interaction.  Does 
that make sense to you guys?  It’s just a really good general safety 
statement or general habit to get into.  I’m not saying that if you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
219 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
don’t do that you’ll go terribly wrong each time, but the one time in 
a hundred or a thousand where an idea is left in place that you 
haven’t removed, it could be unpleasant for the person. 
Anthony: 
And they’ll become a hypnotist to their friends who want to be 
hypnotized later on in life.  They will say “yeah I had hypnosis once 
but then I was really drowsy for an hour afterwards.”  If they say 
that to someone who is sitting in the audience of a stage show 
before the show, they will take the lead.  I guarantee that.  Is that 
it? 
Audience Member: Last one, if you had a table, I want to set up a table in a park and do 
it.  Would you put a gizmo, a spiral – 
Igor: 
You could do that.  You could have a sign.  Personally the best sign 
for me is a bunch of people standing in line with their hands out 
doing magnetic hands.  I would just, how do you get it started?  You 
can have free hypnosis sessions.  I know a guy in Germany that does 
that.  He has a board “free hypnosis here, now”, builds up a crowd; 
does his act that way.  I just tend to use people.  They are the best 
signs for me just standing around looking weird.  Pretty soon a 
crowd will gather.  Yep, okay guys, one last question and then we’ll 
have a break. 
Audience Member: I’ve heard teachers describe the term hypnosis and trance as being 
interchangeable where others describe them as being completely 
different but can be concurrent.  What are your definitions of 
hypnosis and trance because sometimes I hear trance being 
described as hypnosis and can you just differentiate? 
Igor: 
I don’t think it’s a useful way of looking at it unless it’s actually in a 
moment in time.  Personally I really just think of it in terms of are 
they responding to suggestions?  I always just run by my ABS 
formula, that’s the one thought I have in my mind.  Do I have their 
attention?  Yes or no?  You don’t have to have their conscious 
attention, unconscious attention can work but that’s harder to test 
what you have or not so I just go for all attention.  Do you have the 
critical factor on line or off?  In other words are they criticizing, 
analyzing, rejecting ideas or are they just accepting ideas?  Finally 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
220 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
and this is the acid test, the first two are just to get to the third 
stage, is stimulating the unconscious.   
Are you suggesting something be unconscious and is it doing it?  If 
yes, you’ve got it.  If no, you don’t.  The rest is irrelevant to me.  I 
could be, this is where people get confused with Conversational 
Hypnosis and I know we’re not dealing with that here but you can 
have a conversation; and you’re laughing; and you’re smiling; and 
everyone else around thinks you’re just having a normal 
conversation; and yet they’re all deep in trance or deep in hypnosis 
or whatever you want to call it because they are responding to 
every single thing including that hand is stuck, if I were to lean over 
and do that.  Does that kind of make sense?  So I personally would 
suggest you’re doing yourself a disservice if you think of a special 
state, a special trance, or hypnosis is this; or trance is this; or they 
are the same; or they are different.  If it makes you feel better, then 
use it.  At the point where it doesn’t, stop using it. 
Audience Member: Where my distinction comes from is trance implies, I think, being 
kind of zoned out maybe sleepy or droopy.  Whereas hypnosis is 
about suggestibility – 
Anthony: 
And that’s why the state model of trance and every other kind of 
state model, relaxed state, unique state, any altered state, that’s 
where it falls down; okay because you’re constantly chasing that 
state.  The fact that – 
Igor: 
If you want to call it a state, then it’s a state where they accept your 
suggestions.  Whatever that is.  If it’s up or down or in the middle, it 
doesn’t matter.   
Anthony: 
I think I defined it in my book as hypnosis is a process of 
communicating ideas that that person responds to unconsciously 
and automatically.  I’d probably drop some of that right now.  Again 
I just describe myself as not the greatest subject earlier and that all 
changes about six weeks ago.  Kevin and I put a couple of ideas 
together which I am, we’ve never taught, but I’ve mentioned it a 
half a dozen times in this course now, that are most important to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
221 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
me.  What’s most important to me is, again I agree one hundred 
percent with Igor.   
But I know that people will respond to my instructions in exactly the 
same way.  The difference is, the sense of how automatic, how 
involuntary that is.  So hypnosis for me is really very much about 
creating that experience so the person looks back at it and says 
“wow!  How did that happen?  I knew I knew it but I couldn’t say it.  
I could see but I couldn’t see.”  I want them to be baffled by that, 
rather than just responding and thinking “yeah that felt really good.  
I was obviously doing that.”  That’s interesting but it would be much 
stronger, much more intense if you build into this the sense of it 
happening automatically, probably side stepping your question 
completely. 
Igor: 
All right, is there a quick one?  Okay, there we go.  We need to take 
a break because we’ve run over a little. 
Audience Member: This might be a basic question but how do you, what is the 
distinction between bypassing critical faculty and distraction?  Are 
they the same or how – the second part of the question – 
Igor: 
Distraction could be a method of by passing the critical factor.  The 
critical factor is very simply this, if the person is; think of it this way, 
this is a metaphor by the way just to simplify things.  Let’s imagine 
two rooms in the mind, the yes room and the no room.  If you are in 
the yes room, you’ll accept things.  You’ll say yes to it.  You’ll find 
reasons to accept it and let it in.  If you’re in the no room, you’ll find 
reasons to reject things and get rid of them.  The no room is 
important.  It keeps you sane.  It keeps you able to navigate through 
an uncertain world by pretending that something is certain enough 
that you can function with it.   
Does that make sense?  So that no room I call the critical factor.  Its 
purpose is to reject information, reject ideas, find reasons why it’s 
no good.  All of you have experienced at least one person in your 
life that has an over active critical factor.  You tell them “Well, it’s a 
lovely day.”  “Yeah, but it might rain.”  Right?  “You know, little 
kittens are so cute.”  “Yeah but one day they’ll be old and ugly and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
222 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
cost you a fortune.”  So they are looking for reasons to reject ideas, 
right?  So you need to bypass that because it’s testing for failure, 
right?   
Distraction method is one way of doing that.  So in other words if 
you present an idea, you distract them and move on to something 
else, that idea has not had a chance to be analyzed by that 
particular room and rejected hence it still sits there in limbo.  Limbo 
is where the unconscious minds gets to play with it and do things 
and so on.  That is about as simple as I can make the whole idea. 
Audience Member: And the second part of the question is in the hypnotic context, how 
do you know whether the critical faculty has been bypassed? 
Igor: 
It’s very simple.  You just know by, how do you know that someone 
is accepting your ideas when you’re talking to them?  There is a 
push back or there isn’t and it’s not a binary thing.  It can intensify 
so someone can give you a lot of pushback or sometimes they will 
go “yeah, okay” which is a small, you can clearly tell that they’ve 
rejected the idea but they are being polite about it.  A lot of times 
you present the idea and they go “yes!”  It’s as simple as that.  You 
do it every day without really realizing it.  So it’s a sliding scale.  I do 
not need the critical factor to be off.  I need it to be off enough that 
my ideas get accepted hence, how do you test it?  Right back in 
terms of Street Hypnosis it’s actually simpler than in Conversation 
Hypnosis because your tests are pretty obvious, right?  The hand is 
up.  The arm is stiff.  They can’t move.  The hand can’t lift.   
Those are very clear demonstrations that they’ve accepted it.  In 
another context, we’d have to talk another time for it, it gets a little 
bit more ambiguous but the same things you learn here will apply 
there just in a more subtle level that’s all. 
Audience Member: Thank you. 
Igor: 
Does that help? 
Anthony: 
 
No, I don’t think it’s a useful metaphor anymore.

Igor: 
I agree.  All right guys, so we’ve run over a little bit so would it be 
okay if we have a short break?  I know we need a little break to 
stretch legs; have a little drink; and so on but can we be back in 
about seven minutes or so to carry on?

Igor: 
Okay.  Yesterday we made a promise about something very 
important and that was how to deal with someone who’s having an 
abreaction, right.  So first of all, who knows what an abreaction is?  
Other than those of you who’ve been here before, so don’t give the 
game away.  Go ahead.  What’s an abreaction? 
 
Audience Member: Well, it happened to me personally. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, personally.  Who has had an abreaction in the room?  Not quite 
what I meant, but I like it.  Well, you’ll know.  You’ll appreciate 
what’s gonna come then, okay? 
 
Anthony: 
But I’m interested, sorry.  How would you describe it? 
 
Igor: 
How would you describe the experience to the extent that you 
want to publically admit to more than you already have? 
 
Anthony: 
Sorry, how would you describe an abreaction? 
 
Audience Member: For me it happened later on where things just kind of got weird. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: Sounds got really loud and that kind of thing, and things slowed 
down for me.  And it was hard to talk. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
Audience Member: So I wasn’t sure if I was having a stroke or if something weird was 
going on. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: So that wasn’t good.  Another one where I – emotions just grew up, 
and then I kinda blacked out.

225 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Right.  Actually that’s a very interesting description internally from 
an abreaction.  In terms of what your likely to see when an 
abreaction occurs, let me give two possible demonstrations – 
excuse my acting skills – and you tell me which one’s the 
abreaction. 
 
 
Possibility No. 1) They’re in trance and they’re gonna, like, oh, oh, I 
don’t like, it.  Oh, it’s not so good.  Possibility No. 2) Oh, my God.  
This is terrible.  This is bad.  Oh. 
 
Audience Member: No. 2. 
 
Audience Member: No. 2 was the abreaction. 
 
Igor: 
Which one do you think was the abreaction?  Would you like to 
know how to deal with that?  Would that be useful to you?  Or 
should we skip it; and then when you come to that point if you ever 
come to it, you’ll just go oh, I wish I hadn’t skipped that point?  
Okay, Rule No. 1 and this is the most important thing really, you 
remember this.  Drill this into your minds. 
 
 
And one day if you ever do come across an abreaction – and by the 
way, they’re very rare, right.  I’ve come across maybe two 
abreactions that I haven’t sought out on purpose for therapeutic 
reasons, spontaneous ones in other words, in my entire hypnosis 
career.  I presume you have similar numbers in yours or maybe – 
 
Anthony: 
I’d say plenty in therapy that have been provoked, but – 
 
Igor: 
But spontaneous ones? 
 
Anthony: 
– none in performance. 
 
Igor: 
So Rule No. 1, the most important rule, and drill this into your mind 
folks is stay calm. 
 
Anthony: 
Calm.

226 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Igor: 
Okay? 
 
Anthony: 
Be still now. 
 
Igor: 
There is already one person freaking out in that relationship.  It 
should not be you.  When someone’s having an abreaction, they are 
also hyper suggestible because the critical factor is just way offline.  
They are much more sensitive to external stimuli, right?  Now, if 
they’re going, like, ahh, and you go, ahh, and they hear, ahh.  
They’re – all that’s gonna get even worse, right? 
 
 
You’re gonna basically create a feedback loop; and it’s very much 
like if I were to walk with my microphone up to that speaker right 
there, that feedback loop would become pretty unpleasant very 
quickly. 
 
Audience Member: Do you mean you’re not building rapport? laughter – 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, yeah.  That is not the – that is where the traditional rapport 
building method really sucks, right.  So Rule No. 1, stay calm.  You 
must keep your mental state together because you are gonna be 
the stability, the anchor point, the stabilizing factor that’s gonna 
allow them to draw out of the abreaction.  Does that make sense to 
you?  So what’s Rule No. 1? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  I like – I’ll take that.  That’s good. 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Audience Members: And if that doesn’t work – laughter 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  So stay calm Rule No. 1.  Rule No. 2, this is very important.  
Whatever you do, do not touch the person.  So you stay calm.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
227 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Whatever you do, do not touch the person.  Why do you think that 
might be? 
 
Audience Members: (Cross talk) 
 
Igor: 
Right.  So remember, someone is seriously, like, freaking out going 
ahh.  And you go there, there.  It’s okay.  They are hypersensitive to 
stimuli aren’t they?  What are they now associating this touch to 
that feeling, much like when you did a deepener and then you said 
and deeper and deeper and deeper.  Do you see where I’m going 
with this? 
 
 
Now, maybe you solved the whole problem, and everything’s fine 
and so on.  They go home, and someone goes how was your day, 
dear?  Ahh.  Good thing or bad thing? 
 
Audience Members: Bad. 
 
Audience Member: Bad thing. 
 
Anthony: 
And I – just – 
 
Igor: 
I don’t know.  You guys weren’t very convinced by that.  Good thing 
or bad thing? 
 
Audience Members: Bad. 
 
Anthony: 
All right.  The – 
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
– the reason there’s an emphasis on this is really, really important 
because for most of us if you haven’t seen someone suffering like 
that in a completely unbridled emotional outpouring – that’s how it 
looks – you’re overwhelming desire is gonna be to put your arm 
around them and – 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
228 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
– to put your hand on his shoulder and give him some comfort and 
wake him up and say it’ll be fine.  They’re gonna drag all that 
emotion up – 
 
Igor: 
And there’s nothing wrong with doing that afterwards. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Get them out of the hell hole first, then put in all the wonderful 
anchors, touch them, massage their shoulders, lick their feet, 
whatever you need to do, okay?  So what’s Rule No. 1?  I’m freaking 
out.  What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What’s – then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Easy so far, right?  So this is basically just a stabilizing 
point.  These first two things keep things stable, allows you to do 
something with it.  Now, you’re gonna use your hypnosis skills to 
actually pull them out of the hellhole, right?  So the first thing that 
has to happen is whatever the experience they’re having must be 
reduced in some way. 
 
 
It has to fade away.  It has to be pushed away out of their mind, so 
they’re not experiencing any more, right?  So the simplest way of 
doing that is something on the lines of – and please, don’t think 
there’s any magic in this actual language.  It’s the idea that counts.  
If you use different language, it’s fine.  For now though we should 
suggest something along the lines of ‘the scene fades’, right? 
 
 
Or ‘the experience fades’.  Let’s just stick with the scene just 
because it’s easy, right.  So they’re freaking out.  Ah, you’re staying 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
229 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
calm.  You’re not touching them, and then you suggest with 
absolute conviction, absolute authority, the scene fades.  The whole 
scene fades.  Let it fade away.  And you probably have to repeat 
that a few times. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  You can leave those feelings behind, it’s becoming more and 
more distant.  The scene is fading.  Don’t be afraid to just keep 
repeating it until you see, like, a physiological shift in them; and 
they kind of deflate a bit.  And you think they’ve let go – they’re 
letting go of it. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  So the scene fades; and if you need to, they emotionally – 
you’ll watch the emotion response.  The scene fades.  That’s right.  
The scene fades.  The scene fades, right?  Now, they need to feel 
safe as well.  I’ll show you this one. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s the chair, it’s grounding. 
 
Igor: 
Well, no.  We haven’t got the chair.  We haven’t set the – 
 
Anthony: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
– chair up in Street Hypnosis, so we’re going to do it for Street 
Hypnosis now.  So – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, you can feel your feet on the ground. 
 
 
Igor: 
We’ll do this.  Feel X.  For the X, we’ll just talk a little bit about that.  
Now – as the scene is fading, the emotions begin to calm down.  
The biggest thing that they need is safety.  They need to know that 
it’s gonna work out.  It’s gonna be fine, and that creates an exit 
loop, shall we say, rather than an entry loop.  Does that make 
sense? 
 
 
In traditional therapy we set this up ahead of time.  In Street 
Hypnosis you can set this up ahead of time.  By basically, remember 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
230 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
when you do your spiel at the beginning of the induction, you say 
all the sounds around you will just help you focus even more.  If 
you’re gonna be really doing this properly – and I shall recommend 
that you do – pick some part of the experience and link it to safety. 
 
 
For example Stephen stand, standing deep and going deeper and 
deeper into trance, feel the weight on your feet, and know that 
you’re safe.  Feel the weight on your feet, and know you’re safe.  Or 
even something like and as you continue into this deep trance, 
notice you’re breathing.  Know you’re safe.  Whenever you notice 
you’re breathing, you’ll be safe. 
 
 
It’s a great way of setting up ahead of time.  If you have not, you 
can still do this.  You’ll have to work a little harder, but you can still 
do this.  For the moment, I’d like you to put the idea of X as just the 
breathing.  Why?  Because the breathing will continue everywhere 
you go no matter if they’re standing, lying, sitting down, or 
whatever.  And if they’re not breathing any more, you have a bigger 
problem, okay?  So let’s just put the breathing in here for now.  But 
know that you can replace it for anything that you wish.  It could be 
the sensation of standing, the sensation of sitting.  Whatever it is, 
you’re creating a feedback loop of safety.  Does that make sense to 
you guys?  So essentially here as the scene fades, and they say feel 
you’re breathing, or notice you’re breathing.  Know you’re safe.  Go 
ahead, quick question. 
 
Audience Member: Isn’t breathing affected by emotional state? 
 
Igor: 
So the question is isn’t breathing affected by emotional state.  
Absolutely; yes, it is.  And that’s one of the reasons why I can create 
a great feedback loop because they pay attention to their 
breathing.  It will shift just by the fact that you’re paying – everyone 
pay attention to your breathing for a moment.  Notice how it 
changed slightly, right? 
 
 
So the very fact that something’s already changing, you can attach 
the idea of safety onto that.  So even if they’re [heavy breathing],

feel you’re breathing.  Know you’re safe.  Feel you’re breathing.  
Know you’re safe because breathing is safety.  You’re just creating 
the connection for them.  Does that make sense? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Does that help you guys? 
 
Audience Members: 
– because people panic and – 
 
Igor: 
Yes, and actually the part of the panic attack will be that they feel 
that they can’t get enough breath anymore.  So just by focusing on 
breathing, it tends to calm them down as well, right?  So I’m 
freaking out.  What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What don’t you do? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: Actually, on a physiological level when you take a deep breath, you 
move from a sympathetic nervous system – 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Audience Member: – to parasympathetic nervous system.   
 
Igor: 
Absolutely. 
 
Audience Member: Right. 
 
Igor: 
So in terms of just physiology, the deeper you breathe the more 
calmly you seem to breathe.

Audience Member: And when you consciously breathe, you breathe deeper, you get 
more air. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  So you’re increasing the sense of breathing volume should 
we say? So, it’s when you breathe consciously, you tend to breathe 
deeper. 
 
You’re 
breathing 
deeper, 
switching 
on 
the 
parasympathetic system, which is the relaxation response versus 
the stress response.  And even if you don’t get – if they’re still 
shallowly breathing because they’re still in that fear reaction, the 
fact that they’re paying attention to it gets you to be able to 
deepen it and all these other things. 
 
 
For the moment though, let’s not overcomplicate it.  Let’s just 
assume that you can create a stimulus, feel a chair, feel your feet 
standing, in this case feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe.  
Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe.  Notice how this 
comes after the scene fades.  Make sense?  So stay calm.  You do 
not touch them.  Let the scene fade.  Let the scene fade.  Let the 
scene fade.  Push it away.  That’s it further and further away, 
further and further away. 
 
 
As they start coming down – they won’t have to go all the way 
through.  Just as that scene loses its grip on them, you can switch 
into this, and you can go between them at will.  That’s right.  As the 
scene fades, feel you’re breathing; and know you’re safe.  Feel 
you’re breathing, and know you’re safe.  That’s right.  The scene 
fades.  Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe.  Does that 
make sense to you guys? 
 
  Then when I say amnesia – at this point, let’s say they just calm 
down.  They’re like calm again.  They’re feeling safe.  Like, oh, okay.  
That’s great.  Do you carry on with your hypnosis?  Do you just say 
now, go clucking like a chicken, yeah? 
 
 
The correct answer would be no way Jose.  Why?  Because the state 
that they’re in right now clearly has spontaneously triggered 
something inside them, right?  You don’t want to risk them carrying 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
233 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
on especially on the streets.  You just bring them out of trance and 
say, you know what.  Why don’t you sit this one out, and we’ll work 
with other people.  Or better still, hey, you good?  You safe?  
Fantastic.  Excellent. 
 
 
Yeah, interesting things happened.  Good night.  Why expose them 
to further hypnosis on that particular day when clearly they have 
unresolved issues that are emerging shall we say?  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  Now, in terms of amnesia you don’t have to get 
them to forget the experience, the whole thing itself.  What I like to 
do is suggest that the unconscious mind decides how much of that 
can be forgotten and how much of that they remember. 
 
 
Why?  Because the unconscious mind has kept that experience at 
bay for however long that experience has existed.  It does a pretty 
good job of it, right?  The person may not – it may not be healthy 
for the person to have any conscious access to any of that material, 
and again there might be parts of it that are useful for them to have 
because they can handle it; just not the whole deal. 
 
 
I don’t know what that is.  I do not presume to know what that is.  
So I’ll just suggest something on the lines of and as you feel safe 
and the experience fades away, all the way, your unconscious mind 
can just leave it at whatever level it needs to be.  So you can forget 
as much of that as you need to or recall anything that is safe.  
Forget as much as that as you need to.  Recall as – recall whatever 
you need to that is safe.  Does that make sense?  You can see the 
clear distinction between the two? 
 
 
Then wake them up, bring them out.  And very importantly when 
you’ve brought them out of trance out of whatever experience 
they’ve just been having, if their unconscious mind – because this 
whole thing is letting them have some memory of the experience, 
right?  They might ask you questions.  The worst thing to do is they 
come out of trance.  They open their eyes and you go boy oh boy.  
You messed up.  Right?  Not a good thing, right?  Or even saying 
something like hey, that’s pretty freaky what happened; wasn’t it, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
234 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
right?  Again, a bad rapport building technique.  As a rule, you do 
not mention anything of what happened unless they bring it up 
first.  The only thing you’re looking for when they come back is hey, 
how you doing?  You good?  You fantastic?  Yeah.  Calming down?  
And so on. 
 
 
You’re checking that they’re in a good place.  If – and it’s relatively 
likely – they ask you something along the lines of what just 
happened.  Whatever you do you cannot tell them what happened.  
Any ideas why? 
 
 
Because you risk breaking the very seal you allowed the 
unconscious mind to put in place.  Does that make sense?  So they 
say what happened.  You gotta be very ambiguous about the whole 
thing.  I don’t know.  It seemed, like, there might be something 
there you want to deal with at some point, right?  You can go see a 
good therapist.  Either give them your card, or I can recommend 
you to someone, right? 
 
 
What was it though?  I don’t know.  But it seems you’re in a good 
place now, right?  Yeah.  Well, so it seems that whatever it is you’re 
clearly – you’re handling it decently right now.  And at some point, I 
guess you might want to go in there and just take care of it once 
and for all.  But you must insist on not giving any information on 
what it was.  Does that make sense?  Well, for starters, you don’t 
even know what it was. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, you’d be guessing.  You’d – 
 
Igor: 
You’d be guessing. 
 
Anthony: 
– be mindreading. 
 
Igor: 
Right?  And just by saying they freaked the hell out, well, then 
you’re just putting more – you’re attaching more of your actual 
mess onto their mess.  So then it gets even messier.  That’s typically 
how people get problems isn’t it?  You feel a little bit bad about 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
235 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
someone, and someone says hey, little Johnny.  Don’t feel so bad 
you little sad soldier.  So now, he’s got his own problems plus 
someone else feeling sorry for him to add on top of that, right?  
And that continues to escalate and escalate and so on, so don’t do 
that.  Do not add anything to it.  Be very nondescript and so on.  
Does this make sense as a process?  Yes?  So let’s find out.  Oh, my 
God.  I’m freaking out.  What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  What do you do next? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
What do you say? 
 
Audience Members: The scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Then? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia. 
 
Igor: 
And? 
 
Audience Members: End the trance. 
 
Igor: 
End the trance.  Okay.  Let’s try that again.  What’s the first thing 
you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What do you do?

Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: The scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
And the scenes kind of fades a little bit, but it’s not quite there yet.  
So – 
 
Audience Members: Fade it more. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  And then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
One more time. 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
One more time altogether. 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  That’s a little bit better.  Then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia. 
 
Igor: 
And? 
 
Audience Members: End it. 
 
Igor: 
End the trance, right?  Oh, my God.  I’m freaking out.  What do you 
do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What do you do?

Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Then what happens? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia. 
 
Igor: 
What then? 
Audience Members: End it. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, I don’t know.  I’m not really feeling it today.  Are you? 
 
Anthony: 
You need to sit down and think – 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, I think that – I apologize folks.  My acting skill – I have to 
clearly get my skill level.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  Please help 
me.  Help me.  Help me. 
 
Anthony: 
Stay calm.   
 
Igor: 
Lesson learned?  Lesson learned? 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Yes?  But you see how natural it is to do that, right? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
So I’m freaking out.  What do you do?

Igor: 
What don’t you do? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
What do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, okay.  It’s a little bit better now, but I’m not quite there yet. 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, it’s kinda a little hard to go on with this. 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
I can still see a little bit of it. 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Anthony: 
Know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  I feel a little bit better so – 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, I’m a little freaked out still; so – 
 
Audience Member: You forget all about that now. 
 
Igor: 
Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, and it’s almost there; but –

Audience Member: Leave it all behind. 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, and now – 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia. 
 
Igor: 
Amnesia and bring them out. 
 
Anthony: 
You’ll get used to framing these things as suggestions.  Stay calm.  
You obviously need to stay calm.  This is a suggestion.  Stay calm.  
Direct suggestion is powerful as sleep.  Stay calm.  Stay calm.  The 
scene is fading becoming more and more distant now, more and 
more distant.  That’s right.  You can feel the chair and know you’re 
safe.  You can leave it all behind now.  You can forget all about that, 
and then end.  Get use to giving a suggestion rather than – 
 
Igor: 
Oh, my God.  I’m freaking out.  What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  I’m still freaking out, and it’s kind of scary right now.  Help 
me – 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, it’s fading a little bit; but it’s still kinda – 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, then what happens?

Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Ah, come on guys.  That’s useless.  I don’t even believe you on that 
one.  Try that again. 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, one more time. 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Now, that I believe, okay.  Now, what happens? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia.  You can forget as much as you need to. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s right, and finish it up. 
 
Audience Member: Leave it behind. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, I think these guys have got it. 
 
Igor: 
Yep.  Oh, my God.  I’m freaking out. 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
What’s next? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
What’s next? 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Then what happens?

Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, come on guys.  You almost had it there.  Say it again.  So what 
do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
Now, I believe you.  What happens now? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia. 
 
Igor: 
And? 
 
Audience Members: End. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
You’ll be okay (Anthony touches Igor’s shoulder). 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, now it’s okay.  Seriously, that’s fine now; isn’t it? 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Because now we’ve cleared it all up, and he’s in a different place 
altogether, right?

Audience Member: Or you could have just slapped him. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, wake up you – 
 
Anthony: 
It wouldn’t be the first time. 
 
Igor: 
That’s old school, okay?  Okay.  So let’s switch over to oh, my God.  
I’m freaking out.  What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  I’m not even vaguely convinced by that.  I’m freaking out.  
What do you do? 
 
Audience Members: Stay calm. 
 
Igor: 
Next say – what do you do next? 
 
Audience Members: Don’t touch. 
 
Igor: 
What do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Then what do you say? 
 
Audience Members: Feel you’re breathing, and know you’re safe. 
 
Igor: 
I believe you – 
 
Anthony: 
That’s it. 
 
Igor: 
– now.  Okay, I’m calm.  I’m feeling good.  Now what happens? 
 
Audience Members: Amnesia.

Anthony: 
You forget all about that now. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  All right.  All right. 
 
Anthony: 
Good. 
 
Igor: 
I think they have it now.  So let’s go to linking phenomena, shall 
we? 
 
 
 
Building up Suggestions 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, yeah.  All right.  We’re gonna get into the second part of this 
session now, okay, back on track thinking that you’re gonna be 
going out of here in an hour or so back on the streets.  Again, just 
try and get a little bit further down the process than you did before.  
If you didn’t actually practice on your own group, that’s what – 
where you want to start.  If you didn’t practice on a stranger, that’s 
where you want to get to. 
 
 
If you didn’t get past these set piece exercises, aim to get your 
induction.  If you had them with a hand stuck to the head, push it.  
Go for amnesia, all right?  That’s the aim, okay?  What I find 
disrupts that process sometimes is A.) Just not planning ahead and 
B.) Is getting so excited about the fact that your ideas are being 
taken on board that you just start to watch like a freaked out 
observer. 
 
 
And I’ve had that, and I can tell you the first time – because I came 
into this by the indirect route.  The first time I did a rapid induction 
– I’m always confused because I used a rehearsal induction, and 
there’s also a thing called an overload induction where you spin a 
person around.  And you get them to count backwards, and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
244 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
anytime it’s easier just to sit in that chair and go into a trance, 
sleep.  It’s very, very effective. 
 
 
I can’t remember quite which one I used first, but I know on both 
occasions I just felt this rush of just energy coming up through the 
floor through my ankles just like [buzzing sound].  And I couldn’t – I 
could barely speak.  I certainly couldn’t think, and I didn’t have a 
plan of how I was gonna flow into the phenomena.  So I just kind of 
gave him some nice suggestions and brought him out. 
 
 
So let’s start to plan, okay?  Let’s go over what we’ve already done, 
and smooth out some of the kind of links between those.  So right 
from that – let’s say we got the person’s attention.  We got their 
permission to be hypnotized, and we’re gonna start giving our 
instructions, okay.  Be congruent about this.  Have reasons why 
you’re doing this.  Can you stand here?  It’s a better place to stand.  
Can you stand here?  You’ll be much safer. 
 
 
Can you stand here?  Everyone will be able to see you much more 
easily, that kind of thing.  Give reasons for it. Give those instructions 
out with regard to the experience and what you want them to do, 
and get them into these first exercises.  For me magnetic fingers has 
a whole lot of instructions they need to follow first before they’re 
gonna have the experience of the involuntariness.  So I want them 
following instructions, and I’m checking.  If I say put your feet 
together and your feet are still apart, you’re gonna get that 
suggestion again.  If I say place that your feet on the floor and your 
legs are still crossed, you’re really gonna have to justify why you’re 
still in that position to me. I’m not gonna proceed until we go any 
further.   
 
Again, that’s not bullying and being over authoritarian.  It’s just that 
I’m the expert.  I know how you’re gonna get hypnotized; and if I 
suggest that your feet are on the floor, it must be an important part 
of the process.  So just keep flowing with the instructions and just 
doing your soft testing the whole time.  Yep, they’re going along. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Again, this is all about the physical and instructions and magnets.  
This is more of the same.  It’s just more of an experience for them 
to help them do it with their eyes closed, and they get surprised 
when their hands touch because they get to dissociated, it’s all 
about magnets.  Again, choose an induction that you like.  Yes, 
we’ve shown you two rapid inductions; and we’ve shown you a 
bunch of other techniques you can use as inductions. 
 
 
I’m gonna show you three or four more.  I can tell you that the vast 
majority of the time I use the induction I’ve already shown you.  
Can I borrow your arm?  That is also the Bandler handshake 
induction.  It’s just you don’t ask to borrow their arm.  Everything 
else about that induction is exactly the same.  So to me the natural 
place, the natural link is more of the physical, more physical 
phenomena, more magnets, more sense growing that experience 
for them. 
 
 
So that one actually links quite nicely.  That’s why I like inductions 
that leave people in this position rather than necessarily slumped 
right down in this position because here I’ve thrown the ball to you, 
and you’ve caught it.  But I’ve got it again, and I’m gonna throw it at 
you again.  I’ve still got it because you don’t know how to proceed.  
You don’t know what the next step is. 
 
 
I’m gonna decide how I’m gonna proceed by whether that arm 
wants to go down, whether it’s light, whether it’s stiff, and you’re 
fighting it.  It’s shaking.  That’s gonna dictate where I go next, okay?   
 
Describe this process of deepening.  Yes, make some of those 
statements.  You’re trying to stabilize it.  Give them the reaffirming 
statements I’ve given to my subjects up here.  You’re safe.  You’re 
well.  You’re protected.  You’re unconscious mind’s a super power.  
Again, you can see I’m not afraid to use metaphor.  I’m quite happy 
with all of those models as metaphor, and they’re useful.  Then 
what you need to decide upon because you don’t need to work the 
way I do or Emmett does or anything else.  But what you need to 
decide upon is what is your first real test for you.  What’s the first 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
246 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
suggestion that’s gonna occur after this little deepening process, 
okay.  So for me – Igor, would you mind writing a quick list? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
All right.  So again, this is just a personal thing.  If you look at some 
of the scales of hypnotizability, you’ll find they put eyes open 
hypnosis way down there with negative hallucinations.  For me this 
is how I run through the phenomena.  So it’s physical analog 
phenomena.  That is basically I’ve got a scale of naught to 100, and 
we’re gonna have some success somewhere.  So magnetic hands is 
gonna succeed to some degree or not.  Arm levitation is gonna 
succeed to some degree or not. 
 
 
They would be two examples where anything as I said is 100 
percent success, okay.  My next shift is to emotional phenomena.  I 
want to raise the person’s level of emotion.  I’ve probably done that 
already by talking about hypnosis and by delivering this with 
confidence and being the dominant party in that relationship at 
that point in time.  But I want to raise their emotions. 
 
 
So the easiest way for me to do this and to really get this thing 
spinning is to link physical analog movement to a change in 
emotion.  This is gonna feel really weird.  This is gonna freak you 
out, but most often you’re gonna find this funny because laughter is 
good.  Laughter is our friend.  So that starts to lift.  This is gonna 
start to feel funny to you.  That’s right.  That smile is gonna grow.  
It’s gonna turn into a chuckle, and that’s gonna turn into a laugh. 
 
 
And this is all building.  They’re feeling the weirdness of this 
sensation, but they’re also being hit with direct suggestion after 
direct suggestion.  And each time I’m just turning it up just a little 
notch until it becomes unbridled.  I want laughter like you saw 
yesterday.  It doesn’t all – I don’t always get it.  Sometimes people 
are just like [chuckles] yeah, yeah, it’s funny, which is good; but it’s 
not exactly what I want.  But if I can build it, build it, build it, I know 
this moment’s coming where that’s gonna touch their head.  So 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

that’s gonna be when I’m gonna change gear and say you’ll laugh 
out loud as inappropriately as you possibly can, again, as a direct 
suggestion.  And I get my verification, all right.  So the linkage there 
is easy.  Lots of you know about anchoring, and you’ve probably 
heard of sliding anchors and stuff like that.  This to me is the same 
thing but without running through a formal anchoring process. 
 
 
I’m linking that to laughter, to raising their emotions.  If they’re 
laughing their head off, their brain is being showered with good 
chemicals, okay.  They’re gonna get a suggestion.  Your brain is 
showered with good chemicals.  You’re gonna hold onto all those 
good feelings of that laughter.  I’ll just tell them how it’s gonna be 
physically for them.  So that’s a nice, easy link.  Now, the next place 
– sorry to make you stand there, Igor. 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
The next place No. 3 is gonna be physical binary phenomena.  
Again, this isn’t set in stone; but this is how I’m gonna go through.  
Physical binary phenomena is pass or fail, 0 or 1, we’re gonna win 
or not at this point.  So this is – for those of you who are kind of 
new to this and haven’t done this stuff yet, this is probably when 
you’re gonna start to feel a bit of anxiety that may stop you in your 
tracks because you’re thinking oh, shit. What if their hand un-
sticks?  What if I tell them it’s stuck to their head and it doesn’t?   
 
That’s something you just need to get over, and the best – we’ve 
spoke about a few ways of getting yourself into a good state.  Just 
suggest it.  Just tell them how it’s gonna be.  Remember the model 
yesterday.  Tell them directly.  Tell them indirectly.  Give them some 
nice ways that they can do that, ways that they can imagine it. 
 
 
So for me once I’ve got this laughter absolutely off the hook and I’m 
bridled and that hand really is there, then if you heard what I said 
yesterday I said, “And the thing you’re gonna find even more funny 
is your hand is stuck fast to your head.  It’s part of the same piece of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
248 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
wood.  It’s part of your head.  You try and pull it off, you’re just 
gonna laugh even more.” 
 
 
Now, she wants to laugh more.  This is a good feeling.  This is 
already rolling away without her volition.  So take hold of that bit 
that’s already become non-volitional, and stick it into – hook it into 
the physical binary test.  All right.  So years ago – I’ve known Vince 
for a long time.  He’s been doing hypnosis since he was about 
seven, all right.  He’s 14 now, and – he’s a bit older than that – but 
he’s been doing it for a very long time, almost as long as I have.  
And he put this idea in my head about creating strong moments. 
 
 
So very often Vince will go for name amnesia, which is the stop or 
amnesia after this binary phenomena.  So I’ll call it mental 
phenomena now.  By creating a strong moment, he’s got a stiff arm.  
It’s a binary test.  They can bend it or they can’t.  When they can’t, 
you say in a minute I’m gonna touch you on the arm.  I’m gonna 
shout the word red.  When I do, your arm will just become loose 
and limp and your name will drop out of your mind.  I’m 
paraphrasing. 
 
 
But as your arm drops down, your name will drop out of your mind 
for some unknown reason.  So he’s linking that, and then a sudden 
bang or jerk kinda breaks their state.  He’ll ask a question to 
distract, but then he’s into mental phenomena.  And that’s 
something I use a lot is find the moments.  The moments are when 
that happens, when that happens, when it comes unstuck, when 
you do something, when you clap, when you say something, all 
right. 
 
 
So the natural segue for me is to create an impossible situation 
where they cannot lift their hand.  They cannot move it off their leg.  
They cannot pull it down.  They cannot pull it off their head.  They 
cannot open their eyes.  They cannot bend their arm, whatever it is.  
Once that has been passed, the way out of that situation for them 
is, unfortunately for them, to step into some more phenomena.  It’s 
a bigger experience.

249 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
 
So when that happens, this will happen.  And as that happens, you’ll 
become aware.  You’ll know this.  You’ll realize.  Describe it in terms 
of an experience; and again, if you can find a strong moment, to 
then link something like amnesia to or a name change to then it’s 
much, much easier to do.  Once I get into amnesia, you notice I – 
the structure, it’s not that it falls away.  But once I’ve established 
amnesia that I can get it and I can kind of test it, then I’m happy to 
go anywhere else. 
 
 
So I will quite happily suggest positive hallucinations, negative 
hallucinations, crazy actions, identify shifts, anything you might 
have ever imagined you could do with hypnosis I will say at that 
point most comfortably, all right.  I may just hypnotize someone 
and give them a straight up hallucination, but normally, I would try 
and get through all of this stuff pretty swiftly if what I really needed 
to do is hallucinate.  That may take me about three or four minutes, 
but I can perform with magnetic fingers and hands for ten minutes.  
It’s just there’s more patter and more turning in front.  So is that 
okay? 
 
Igor: 
Do you want a mic? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, just go ahead. 
 
Igor: 
It’s over there. 
 
Anthony: 
You have it back. 
 
Igor: 
It’s coming up. 
 
Anthony: 
I guess what I’m trying to say is if you have a bit of a plan about 
well, what if I get that to happen and you think well, the natural 
step for me would be to go for amnesia or to go for a number 
amnesia, then have your bit of wording down.  Know what you’re 
going to say next.

Audience Member: Okay, so out of curiosity with the whole amnesia and such as you 
were saying like linking with the clapping and such – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: – is that how other stage hypnotist’s get people to act like a 
chicken.  Whenever I clap, you’re going to stand up and cluck and 
it’s just going to be completely involuntary. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, it’s a post-hypnotic suggestion, and in a way most suggestions 
– 
 
Audience Member: There were three things that happened like that throughout the 
whole show.   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, but the extremity of the thing is not important, all right.  The 
fact that that’s become an idea that cues a response is important, 
but it’s got nothing to do with clapping or clicking or even flow.  It’s 
just that he’s got them to a point where he can lay down a post-
hypnotic suggestion and know it can be triggered.  So – 
 
Igor: 
We’ll talk about post-hypnotic suggestions later on. 
 
Anthony: 
We’re gonna cover that. 
 
Igor: 
– later on. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Just very quickly just think about –if you want to think about it in 
the terms of Stage Hypnosis show, what are they doing here?  Well, 
this is how they choose volunteers; isn’t it? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
So they’ve already selected something.  But not even selecting 
something, they’ve started the whole hypnotic process flowing.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
251 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Then they start having little mini skits in the hypnosis – stage 
hypnosis known as warm-up acts or warm-up routines.  They’re 
simple group routines that are essentially emotional and physical in 
nature.  If they respond to the emotion, they respond with a 
physical element.  That then leaves them open to actually the more 
interesting, crazy routines and so on.  So really they follow a very 
similar format. 
 
Anthony: 
Classic routines in stage hypnosis some of you will know this early 
phase of big group routines – 
 
Igor: 
Yep. 
 
Anthony: 
– that anyone can do even with just a sense of fun rather than a 
sense of involuntariness. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
Imagining you’re on a motorbike.  Making the noise of the machine 
it will go even faster, and you’ll find this fantastic.  Pretending 
you’re in a band, making them think you’re hot and cold.  You’re on 
the beach.  You’re boiling hot.  That’s all physical analog.  You can 
imagine you’re hot.  You can behave like you’re hot.  You can 
actually start to feel – as your blood flow changes start to feel hot. 
 
 
It’s all physical analog at that point, but it starts to feel good.  It 
feels so good because this is the perfect beach for you, and you 
have a sip on that drink.  It’s your favorite alcoholic drink, but it’s 
100 times more powerful.  And it makes you giggle and laugh.  It’s 
what we’re describing here.  It’s just you can do it with the 
exercises you’ve already been shown. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  So do you get the idea of this as a model?  So what I want to 
do now is – yeah.  What I’d like to do now is very quickly you can 
see how we spent some time talking about this, but it’s only in 
action just three or four minutes; isn’t that right?  Yes?  And you’ve 
actually pretty much done all of these things.  Do you – anyone 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
252 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
here do the funny or laughter thing yesterday?  Yes?  Everyone do 
that?  Did anyone get anyone’s hands stuck to something 
yesterday?  Only – 
 
Anthony: 
Great. 
 
Igor: 
– hands up if you did this. 
 
Anthony: 
So a lot of you need to do that. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  So – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
– in that case what we’re gonna do now is an exercise.  In other 
words we’re gonna go through the whole little mini routine, and I 
want you to really go zippy.  You have literally three minutes to do 
it all.  I’ll give you five minutes to be generous.  I want you to zip 
through these things as quickly as possible.  That means there’s no 
hesitation.  There’s no thinking about it.  There’s no, like, I don’t 
know.  Am I there yet?  Am I not?  Just do it.  If it works, great.  If it 
doesn’t; irrelevant.  You’ve gone through the structure.  Does that 
make sense? 
 
 
I want you to get at least to asking for something binary, which is a 
hand stuck to the shoulder, head, table – 
 
Anthony: 
Chest.  You should – 
 
Igor: 
– whatever. 
 
Anthony: 
– be able to get the gift, sticking it to the chest.  Once they’ve got 
the feeling, the emotion and as you feel that, that hand is sticking 
tighter and tighter. 
 
Igor: 
Did that whole thing from day one make a little more sense now?  I 
want you to get at least the hand stuck element.  If you want to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
253 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
push the envelope a little bit, go all the way for amnesia.  Like, 
forget the name.  Forget the number.  Those are the two classic 
ones. 
 
Anthony: 
But we are gonna cover that – 
 
Igor: 
We’re gonna cover – 
 
Anthony: 
– in detail. 
 
Igor: 
– that separately, exactly. 
 
 
So for the moment if you want to push yourself, go to amnesia; but 
I want to have at least the hand stuck.  Does that make sense to 
everyone?  You have five minutes apiece.  You should only be taking 
three of those minutes to do the whole lot, so that should give you 
the idea of the pace.  Then we’ll come back and we’ll do the next 
thing.  So ten minutes in total.  Find a partner.  Off you go. 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Anthony: 
Who feels a little bit rushed? 
 
Audience Members: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Now, the good news is shortly we’ll be going out onto the streets of 
Vegas once again; and at that point, there is really no time limit.  
You can take a whole hour to do this stuff if you want to, right.  So 
you’ll be able to run your own time limit.  The key thing is here – 
and we’ll be pushing you a little bit again between exercises in here 
partly so that we can get more material to you, but partly also – 
think of it this way. 
 
 
If you can do this whole thing in three minutes and just pushing, 
pushing, pushing, then when you have time to elaborate and get all 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
254 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
the subtleties and stuff in place, your performance should be that 
much more powerful; should it not?  If you can still get the effect in 
three minutes of just the bare bones or bare minimum.  So treat 
this as an opportunity of seeing how little can I do and still get the 
result, as opposed to how much can I pack in to make sure I get the 
result. 
 
 
Do you understand the difference of the two mind sets? Both have 
value, but one on its own is lopsided.  Because if you only think 
about how much can I pack in to get the result, you’ll never realize 
what things are actually working and vice versa.  If all you could do 
is go for the bare minimum, you’ll miss out on opportunities to 
make things work when otherwise they seem that they won’t.  Does 
that make sense to you guys? 
 
 
So please get used to those two extremes, and treat the times you 
go outside as your play time because you don’t have us all nasty, 
come back now, you finished your exercises because you have all 
lunch break.  You get to stay out as long as you want.  Make sense 
to you guys?  So who feels good about this as a process?  Do you 
have a microphone? 
 
Audience Member: What’s the difference between say when I was a subject and going 
through a routine, I felt that well, I wasn’t really hypnotized.  But I 
was doing all the things because I wanted his performance to go 
well, and I didn’t want to have him disappointed.  And it didn’t 
make any difference to me whether I said things that were funny or 
not.  And so how do I know that I was really hypnotized or – 
 
Anthony: 
You – 
 
Audience Member: – not hypnotized or – 
 
Anthony: 
– don’t know.  The only difference, as far as I’m concerned, is your 
sense of involuntariness about what – 
 
Igor: 
Right. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
255 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony: 
– you did.  You can know what you’re doing.  You can be aware 
what you’re doing when you’re hypnotized, all right.  You can be 
aware that it’s ridiculous.  You can be aware that you don’t actually 
believe in the thing that has been suggested to you but still find 
yourself doing it, all right.  Now, again, you can be doing that 
because of the situation and context and because of the 
instructions that have been given to you, all right.  And you can be 
doing it because of the context and the instructions that have been 
given to you, but your experience can be one of but I couldn’t stop 
it.  I knew it wasn’t there, but I could see it. 
 
 
So that’s the only difference to me.  If you’re playing along, that’s 
what you’re doing.  Is that hypnosis?  I don’t think so, but it can be 
made to look like it.  But I’m not entirely convinced that’s got both 
sides of the equation.  You need – they need to help you imagine 
and develop this sense that wow, this is happening automatically; 
and you’ll get there.  You’ll get there. 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
So I look for – there’s basically three levels of responses you can 
get, right.  You can get a voluntary response.  I mean, in other 
words they’re following along on purpose to help you out or 
because they’re curious.  See, if I said to all of you can you all please 
put your hand up in the air now?  Go ahead and put your hands up, 
everyone.  Hand right up in the air.  Okay, that’s a voluntary 
response; isn’t it? 
 
 
You’re doing it because I’ve asked you for it, and you’ve done it.  
Does that make sense?  Now, believe it or not, voluntary responses 
open the wedge into – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
– what we call genuine hypnosis because it begins to open the yes 
mind.  You’re being responsive.  Does that make sense?  It isn’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
256 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
hypnosis in the sense of responding to suggestions directly because 
there is a mediator, which is your consciousness, decides that’s a 
good idea.  I’ll do it.  But it’s definitely a step towards that.  Now, if 
you get enough voluntary responses, you end up with something 
that is called a non-voluntary response. 
 
 
In other words it’s something that happens by itself though you 
could stop it if you wanted to.  Classically, a lot of catalepsy and 
levitations and things like that are examples of that.  Through a 
slight effort, the person can cancel the circumstances that allows 
that thing to occur.  Does that make sense?  So repetitive motions 
and a lot of things like that is the beginning.  That in my opinion is 
the beginning of genuine hypnosis because the unconscious mind is 
running it, and the conscious mind just hangs back and just lets it 
occur.  It could interfere, but it chooses not to.  You see what I 
mean?  And I suspect that’s kind of where you were kind of 
hovering on that line.  That’s where a lot of people start with 
hypnosis. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
And the beauty is at some point, the non-voluntary response 
converts – just like the voluntary response converts to non-
voluntary, the non-voluntary response converts to an involuntary 
response.  And that’s when you have the really powerful dramatic 
effects.  That’s when someone couldn’t stop it even if they tried, 
but it’s a sliding scale going from complete voluntariness to 
complete involuntariness. 
 
 
And it’s not an on off switch, so in other words a strong non-
voluntary response is a light involuntary response.  In other words it 
requires more mental effort to break through the spell so to speak. 
 
Anthony: 
Right. 
 
Igor: 
Does that make sense to you guys?

Anthony: 
A good hypnotist is gonna get you to do stuff from a voluntary level 
at first.  Put your feet together, all of that kind of stuff.  And a good 
performer can – is capable of holding someone without any of the 
involuntariness in that place by their charisma and presence and 
the – 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
– situation and can make the most of it.  But again, I wouldn’t like 
to run a show with ten people in a row feeling like you were feeling.  
But I could, and it would still look pretty similar.  Your exper – your 
reflection on it afterwards would be things like I don’t know.  I was 
just – 
 
Igor: 
I wasn’t sure. 
 
Anthony: 
– doing what you asked me to do.  I wasn’t – 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
– sure.  But that’s on it – that’s very often what the person who had 
the involuntariness said as well.  They were still aware of it.  They 
just said I don’t know.  I just did it. 
 
Igor: 
And honestly, the only way you’ll know whether you’ve switched 
from non-voluntary to involuntary is the person tried to resist but 
then fails.  That’s, by the way, where the binary test comes in.  Try.  
Try hard; and if they really are genuinely trying and it’s not working, 
you’ve just switched from non-voluntary to involuntary.  Does that 
make sense? 
 
 
Whereas a lot of the binary tests out of the analog tests, the ones 
that – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
258 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
– he has a little bit of motion or a little bit more motion, they tend 
to be non-voluntary. They can be involuntary as well, but they lend 
themselves more to non-voluntariness.  In other words it happens.  
They could stop it, but it’s kinda like it’s curious and interesting 
enough that they’ll keep it going.  And then the binary test is 
actually when you switch to involuntary because they’re going, like, 
I’m trying.  I’m really trying to make this happen – to stop this 
happening, but they can’t. 
 
 
In my opinion – and this is not for Street Hypnosis – involuntary is 
the best.  Non-voluntary you can still do a pretty good performance 
with, right.  Especially, a lot of people have a non-voluntary 
response or they’ll think to themselves wow, that’s really cool.  
Look at it really happening because they have that affirming 
mindset verses a negating mindset. 
 
 
For therapy all you need is non-voluntary.  You don’t need any 
more than that.  That can be enough; although, of course, 
involuntary responses are great to have because then that creates a 
better seal for a lot of the things that you’re doing.  Does that kind 
of make sense?  Does that help you?  Did you find that useful?  Yes, 
no, maybe so?  Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
There’s – 
 
Igor: 
A quick question. Can I have the microphone over here just in 
front? 
 
Anthony: 
Where is it? 
 
Igor: 
Run rabbit.  Run rabbit.  Run, run, run.  There you go. 
 
Audience Member: Hi.  We might be covering this later, but I’m just wondering in order 
to create a post-hypnotic suggestion – 
 
Igor: 
We’ll come to post-hypnotic suggestion later.

Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
It is after lunch, otherwise we’ll be giving you too much at the same 
time.  There’s a question over here on the end, just all the way to 
the end.  I don’t mean to put you in a strike.  It’s just we will be 
covering it, so we may as well deal with it at the right time. 
 
Audience Member: The experience that I had – Kathy actually had me forget my name, 
and I did.  And in the past when I’ve seen that it’s always so funny.  
But I was scared.  I didn’t like that experience. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: So – 
 
Igor: 
Do you remember what Anthony was talking about before about 
dictating the response?  If you just leave people to their own 
responses spontaneously, involuntariness can feel frightening.  
Why?  Because you’ve lost control, and no one likes that.  Which 
means whenever you’re aiming for an involuntary response, it is 
very important that you dictate the response that comes with it.  In 
other words you won’t be able to say your name, but it will be the 
funniest thing to you.  Or it will be like – 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Igor: 
– a really curious thing - or you’ll be fascinated by the fact that you 
can’t say your name. 
 
Audience Member: That’s what I was kinda want – because I’d never picked up on the 
other language that you guys do – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.

Audience Member: – to make – 
 
Anthony: 
Again, when we – 
 
Audience Member: – that that’s – 
 
Igor: 
It comes out in layers. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Don’t worry. 
 
Anthony: 
And you’ll see – 
 
Audience Member: Oh, really?  Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
– again, when we cover post-hypnotic suggestions, we all have our 
little formulas.  But one of – 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
– the pieces in my formula – 
 
Audience Member: Oh, good. 
 
Anthony: 
– is direct – not dictating their exact response but just directing it. 
 
Audience Member: Okay. 
 
Anthony: 
I mean, fun is fun.  This will be amazing to you.  This will be – 
nothing will bring you more joy, that kind of stuff. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah.  No, because I have a lot of thoughts going through my head; 
and none of them are funny.  I’m – 
 
Anthony: 
Know what?  For sure.

Audience Member: I didn’t know who the heck I was. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve had this – 
 
Igor: 
Because it is – and especially when you tell them to forget their 
name, it can be a – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
– it can be an interesting thing.  If you have ever talked to someone 
with genuine amnesia, like, they had a bang on the head, it can be a 
very worrying thing.  So if you’re gonna do any outrageous 
phenomena with people, it is really important that you link onto it a 
response that’s gonna be positive all around, right? 
 
Audience Member: So I guess that really hit home is to be careful as to how strong our 
suggestions are. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, absolutely.  If you’re doing visibility, trust me that – and chair 
floats past him – and some people will feel absolutely terrified. 
 
Igor: 
Yep. 
 
Anthony: 
If you want them feeling terrified, and you can kind of hem in that 
terror.  So it’s up to you to say what’s appropriate, but it’s – 
 
Igor: 
There’s a famous TV magician called Darin Brown who became 
famous for scaring young girls, right.  He could do all these little 
freaky things with them, but he did it in actually a very interesting 
way where he – they were both terrified but fascinated at the same 
time.  So afterward, they were actually really happy to have the 
response.  So it’s not traumatizing.  It’s more like a thrill ride.  Does 
that make sense?  If you’re gonna go down that road, that’s what I 
recommend you do because we’re not here to harm people. 
 
Anthony: 
Right.

Igor: 
We’re here to entertain, demonstrate the power of something, and 
maybe it will spread a little bit of a force for good at the – 
 
Anthony: 
But it is – 
 
Igor: 
– same time. 
 
Anthony: 
– this involuntariness.  I mean, we had a moment, a really 
important TV project; and we were trying to get funding from a 
particular company for it.  I did a bit of a show for them, and we 
had – it was quite hard work.  And then we ended up with kinda 
one girl in the frame, and she was very good.  We did name 
amnesia, and it was amusing and did total amnesia. 
 
 
I think I’ve mentioned already if you can’t remember anything, that 
can freak you out a little bit especially when someone says where 
are you.  Who are all these people? 
 
Igor: 
Right.  And – 
 
Anthony: 
And she burst into tears instantly. 
 
Igor: 
Those are also suggestions, right? 
 
Anthony: 
And I kind of – and I undid that very, very quickly.  And I thought 
I’ve blown it, and I turned over and there were Dutch TV producers 
there that said, what excellent tears. 
 
Igor: 
Well played. 
 
Anthony: 
And signed the check, and we won it essentially based on that.  But 
all I’m saying it’s because I left it open, and I would never do that 
now.  As interesting it is to just see how they respond, for some 
people that feeling that this is happening.  I can’t stop it.  I can’t 
remember it.  I must have lost my senses can –

Igor: 
Just – 
 
Anthony: 
– give it some direction. 
 
Igor: 
– just bear in mind folks, we’re not even halfway through day two, 
almost to the end – coming towards the halfway point of day two.  
And at this point, you have a skill set that basically that strips most 
hypnotists.  You can do really impressive, crazy and sometimes 
dangerous things.  Hence, going right back to our health and safety 
chat from yesterday I think it was.  You are responsible for the 
wellbeing of the person that’s with you. 
 
 
So when you present the suggestion, you just had a classic example 
of what we talked about of a suggestion being misinterpreted 
because the name amnesia was mean to be, like, an interesting or 
curious thing by a hypnotist.  But you’ve misinterpreted the 
emotional aspect of it versus the actual physical aspect of it.  Does 
that kind of make sense then?  Did that make sense to you guys?  
So when you go out there today, enjoy what you’re doing.   
 
 
Realize that actually if anything you shouldn’t be concerned about 
what if it doesn’t work.  The thing you should be thinking about is 
what will happen when it does work.  Put your attention on that 
because that really deserves this attention, right.  It’s not like can I 
get the hand stuck?  It’s making sure that when the hand’s stuck, 
it’s stuck in a way that’s safe for them that’s gonna be entertaining 
and useful.  And everyone gets a positive experience out of that.  
Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
 
I would strongly recommend you put all your attention on that 
because that’s really where it belongs given the skill sets you 
currently have.  Well, I don’t know if you’d agree with that, but 
that’s – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
– kind of where I’m at.

Anthony: 
100 percent. 
 
Igor: 
So unless there’s any other questions, I think it’s time for us to head 
out and do some mayhem on the streets of Vegas once again.   
 
 
The Set Piece 
 
Igor: 
When you go out today, what I’d like you to do – I’ll ask all of you to 
do this.  I’m not gonna enforce it.  You can sit back and watch if you 
want.  But what I will ask you guys to do is to run through a whole 
new set piece.  In other words you have your intro, your opening.  
You have your intro.  You remember that?  You will have your 
suggestibility tests, which are your classic magnetic hand and song, 
right.  You’ll do your induction and deeper then with some language 
on safety and sounds and all that sort of stuff.  That just sets the 
scene, right.  Then just like yesterday, you can do the arm levitation.  
It’s a nice simple physical thing to do.  Link that to laughter and a 
nice simple emotional thing to do. 
 
 
Then as we’ve been practicing right now, you can take that all the 
way from that, add in the sticking the hand to something, sticking 
the foot to something.  It’s really just one extra step from what you 
were doing yesterday.  Will that not be fair to say?  If you want to 
go for the amnesia, by all means do so.  But I’m gonna ask you just 
like you did in here just now, I want to ask you to go for at least the 
hand being stuck to something out there while other people are 
also watching.  Does that make sense to you guys? 
 
 
Then it really is – the world’s your oyster once – especially, this is 
what will come after lunch.  Once you get to amnesia, everything 
becomes possible.  It’s just the Golden Gate to happiness when it 
comes to hypnosis.  So really push yourself to get to the hand stuck; 
and if the hand doesn’t stick and comes off, it’s no big deal.  Really 
it is not because you still have all these other things going on here, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
265 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
and we’ll show you how to work with something not quite working 
out after the lunch break as well. 
 
 
Once you get to this stage here, this is where all the stuff that 
you’ve always wanted to be able to do with hypnosis, always 
wanted to know how to do with hypnosis, the reason you’ve really 
come all the way here to learn this stuff, this stuff happens right at 
this point.  You’re right at the point of – the turning point in terms 
of hypnotic skill, so you may as well push yourself that little bit and 
get at least to the hand stuck. 
 
 
And if you want to go that little bit further, go for the amnesia just 
to see what happens.  If for nothing else, you should be curious 
about that now, right.  Any questions or comments? 
 
Audience Member: No. 
 
 
 
 
DVD #7 – Part 1 – Las Vegas                            
How to Work the Streets & Create                       
the Most Dramatic Demonstrations 
 
 
Work the Streets 
 
Igor: 
When you go out tonight, remember that you’re the hypnotist at 
every stage of the proceedings.  Does that make sense?  So, one 
thing to bear in mind is everything you say to people, even when 
they’re watching or whatever it is, will be a suggestion.  I’ll give you 
an example of what I mean:  There is an interesting study done on 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
266 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
one of the national forests here in the U.S. where people kept 
stealing some of the rocks in one of these petrified forests and 
people kept stealing bits of the forest and it slowly disappeared, so 
it had a sign out saying, please don’t be one of those rude people 
that steal from this forest because of preservation, and so on.  
Guess what happened to that sign when it went out?   
 
Audience Members: They stole more. 
 
Igor: 
Theft went up, right?  It’s an indirect suggestion for theft, isn’t it, 
for taking something home.  People are like, oh, wow, I guess that’s 
what people do, that’s what I need to do, right?  Now, the reason I 
mention this is because now that we’re getting to the important 
parts of hypnosis and big stuff starts coming out, make sure – 
you’re going to start attracting a lot of attention from everyone, 
crowds and also security personnel, whether it’s the security 
officers in the casinos or we have some undercover police officers 
recently.  They were very chill; by the way, they were very relaxed 
and nice about the whole thing.   
 
They just said, okay, do your thing and then just move along and 
don’t create too much of a disturbance here.  There might even be 
uniform police officers.  The key thing to realize at this point is, 
number one, it’s really not a big deal, just be chill, be relaxed 
because whatever you do will determine their response, right?  If 
you start getting stressed, they’ll think, what are they hiding, and 
you can see where that’s going to go, right?  By the same token, it’s 
not necessarily a good idea either to go up to the police officer and 
say, hey, I’m going to do some Street Hypnosis here.  Is that cool 
with you?   
 
Do you see why it is, because now the default response is going to 
be no because he doesn’t know how to react so best thing is, let’s 
avoid the problem in the first place.  So the simplest thing to do – 
and by the way, it’s not because it’s illegal because you’re allowed 
to do this; it’s part of your civil rights, I guess.  So just the simple 
rule of thumb is, when you go out, just do your thing, have fun, be 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
267 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
respectful of those around you, don’t necessarily ask for 
permission.  If someone comes up and questions what you’re doing, 
just say – be very relaxed and say, oh, we’re just doing this, right?  
It’s free, there’s no money involved, there’s no busking or anything 
like that.  It’s free of charge.   
 
We’re just demonstrating this for the love of the thing, and if they 
ask you to move along, just say, thank you very much and off you 
go.  It really is a really – is a no-brainer, it’s a low key thing, it’s a 
simple thing, it’s an easy thing.  It’s just, if you start getting stressed 
about it, then they’ll start getting stressed about it and so on.  Do 
you see where we’re going with this?  Right?  Please don’t think this 
is a suggestion that anything unpleasant will happen just because – 
well, it won’t.  In London where it’s actual illegal to do this, the 
police were actually really nice as well, and it was fine.  Here, it’s 
absolutely legal.   
 
Just don’t cause any trouble for yourself.  If they say move along, 
just move along and until they say move along, just enjoy yourself; 
do your thing; be respectful and everything will be fine.  Does that 
make sense to you guys?  Any questions about that sort of thing 
because I know you’re getting a little bit more attention nowadays 
so we might as well deal with it whilst we’re here.  All good?  
Comments?  Questions?  Anything like that?  All right.  So now that 
we’ve come to the tail end of the formal part of the training, there’s 
two things that we want to cover before we formally finish this 
training and any bonus materials you may get comes from that.  
 
Remember this whole sequence we have here, right, all of you have 
gotten up to the point where you can get a hand stuck.  It may not 
be – some of you might still be a little bit iffy about doing the whole 
thing but you can get to that point.  Is that true?  Right?  The next 
step, believe it or not, is just as simple to do and we’ll spend a lot of 
time talking about that now so you have the whole thing, a to z of 
Street Hypnosis and after that it’s just a question of, how do you 
polish your performances, right?  That’s going to be amnesia 
because as Anthony has mentioned lots of times, and I tend to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
268 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
agree with him, once you have amnesia, you basically have the 
gateway wide open for pretty much anything, all the other 
phenomena naturally fit into that.   
 
Does that mean you’ll always succeed?  No, but at least if you fail, 
you can get them to forget about it.  It’s a nice little ploy, right?  
And by the way, it will still be really dramatic for everyone else 
because they’re going, like, don’t you remember he did that and 
you couldn’t do it, and, like, no, what are you talking about?  Didn’t 
happen.   
 
 
Showmanship 
 
Igor: 
So before we do that though, because amnesia has some 
interesting subtleties that we want to pull out.  Something that’s 
going to be very important is to talk about the general principle of 
showmanship, right?  You’re doing Street Hypnosis.  It is a show.   
 
Even if you develop your own sort of elected demo or something 
like that there is still an element of showmanship involved, right?  
Because you’re in front of a group of people and it is not an 
information-based thing.  Even this thing here, our training, is a 
show, isn’t it?  If you wanted information you would pick up a book 
and you’d be fine with that.  But that’s not what it’s about.  So you 
have to have some things in place that will allow the showy part of 
it to, shall we say, grow and the responses that you’re looking for to 
increase, and then you have this amazing feedback loop because 
the expectation of a show gets them more excited, that creates 
more excitement for the volunteers, the volunteers perform better, 
they respond with more excitement and that creates a wonderful 
little feedback cycle where everyone kind of wins. 
 
 Does that kind of make sense?  And I think you witnessed a great 
example of showmanship just now in the – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

Anthony: 
Who was it in Emmet’s group, that was doing it large, Vegas style. 
 
Audience Member: Can you think of a proper definition of amnesia? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, it’s a question of a proper definition of amnesia.  We’ll give you 
a quick one now and we’ll deal with it more later.  It’s forgetting 
something. 
 
Audience Member: So if I say to someone once I’ve got her in a trance, the number four 
has been eliminated. 
 
Igor: 
Okay, so you’re saying the number three has been eliminated from 
the language.  Is that a form of amnesia?  Of course. 
 
Audience Member: Then I count to five, one, two, three, five – 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Audience Member: So that’s amnesia? 
 
Anthony: 
You don’t know if it’s amnesia because of the way you gave the 
suggestion which has been eliminated from the language so you 
might have thought, oh, I better not say it.  Amnesia is the feeling 
that you can’t recall that information that you know that you know.  
It’s not ignorance, it’s – it’s I know I know it; I’m going to find it; I 
know I know my name; be quiet, shush, I’ll get it.  That’s the natural 
experience of amnesia and that’s the experience I find most people 
have when it’s suggested to them.  They want you to be quiet 
because they know they know the information.  They know – 
 
Igor: 
It’s that tip of the tongue phenomenon, right?  But there’s another 
form which is the more elaborate version of it where they don’t 
even realize that they ever knew it, right?  Have you ever had, like, 
an experience where, let’s say you go out with some friends and a 
few beverages are involved and the next day people say, you did 
something crazy last night, and you go back, no, I didn’t; yes, you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
270 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
did; no, I didn’t.  That’s, shall we say, drug-induced amnesia, but it’s 
the same thing where you are convinced that you did not do 
something.  So on the milder side, they know they know, they just 
don’t have access to it, that’s the tip of the tongue phenomenon. 
 
  
And on the full blown side, they are convinced, genuinely convinced 
that it doesn’t exist, that they’ve never come across that, it’s an 
experience they didn’t have at that moment in time.  And like 
everything else in hypnosis, it’s a sliding scale, right?  Where does 
one begin and the other end?  I have no idea.  I don’t think people 
are that black and white, in that sense.  Does it make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
When we get to amnesia, you’ll see that that’s precisely the kind of 
thing I’d encourage you to say.  It’s not just the suggestion for 
forgetting; it’s, find other ways of phrasing that that will achieve the 
same effect.  A friend of ours will – do that and stick your mouth 
shut and ideas like that, it’s on the tip of your tongue, you just 
cannot say it, well, then the suggestion is, you can’t say it.  It’s not 
necessarily that you’ve forgotten it, that kind of thing. 
 
Igor: 
But let’s come back to that when we actually deal with the amnesia 
thing.  For the moment let’s focus again back to the idea of 
showmanship and – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, I was going to say, one member of Emmet’s group went out 
there and did it large and said, this is Las Vegas Street Hypnosis, 
right here, right now, and gathered a crowd before he’d done 
anything so he could have carried on shouting and gathering that 
crowd for five, ten minutes because he was clearly the performer.  
He was clearly the hypnotist in that situation, and again, I don’t 
always – because of the nature of the way Kev and I got into this, 
the things we were taught to do, we’re a little more covert, they 
were just – they weren’t, perform in front of a crowd.  They were, 
take hypnosis into a normal situation, a workplace, an office, a club 
or a bar, and use it to achieve a certain thing.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
271 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Yes what we filmed then looked entertaining to the audience who 
might watch it on a screen.  But the idea wasn’t to entertain to a 
crowd on that street.  So very often my approach might seem not 
entirely permissive but I’m going to work out from one person.  You 
can completely flip it on its head and just start as a good street 
performer would start by getting attention, gathering a crowd, and 
tonight when we’re out, pick it up if that’s what you feel like doing.  
It doesn’t have to be, I’m part of a convention of hypnotists so 
would you like to have an experience?  That’s all great, the gift, all 
that stuff is beautiful and it will work.   
 
Once you get it going, the crowd will come but if you want to make 
it easier for yourself, and I said this on the first day of the course, 
this is a numbers game.  It doesn’t mean people can’t be 
hypnotized.  It means, in that moment, in that mood, with that 
hypnotist doing what he’s doing, some people are going to be 
better stars than others.  To make your life easier, do that with 
twenty people, do it with ten, do it with five, just do it with as many 
people who will stand still in front of you and it plays bigger.  
Suddenly their friends have got more than one person to watch.  
You can start to play people off against each other.   
 
So for some of you who are in performance mode rather than 
others who just want to have some skills to illustrate their 
hypnotherapy, they’re real, I’ll suggest when we go out tonight, we 
play it a little bit larger, a little bit bigger and it will be so much 
easier for you. 
 
Igor: 
Just challenge yourself to take it that little step further. 
 
Anthony: 
Whoever that was, well done because that’s what Vegas needs. 
 
Igor: 
We can talk in his absence and he’ll feel good when he comes back. 
 
Anthony: 
And the other thing is, even if you don’t necessarily start out in this 
way, other aspects of showmanship that are going to come through 
in terms of your persona, in terms of what it is you’re actually 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
272 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
illustrating with this funny material, are going to come through in 
your body language, are going to come through in your comfort 
with yourself, the fact that you can turn and speak to the audience 
about what’s occurring right there.  And it’s easy to miss those 
moments and I’m as guilty of it as anybody because I’m so focused 
on my subject.  But if you’re doing – let’s say you statued someone, 
you’re putting money on them and you’re offering them money, 
you really should stop and look and turn to the audience.   
 
If you’re doing something as simple as a stiff arm, get the person to 
open their eyes, get them to look at it, emphasize the craziness of 
this situation even though we know it’s quite a simple phenomena, 
get their response, get the audience responding to that response 
and it will start to – 
 
Igor: 
Here’s a couple of things that you can start thinking about when it 
comes to developing that persona and interacting with the 
audience.  Number 1:  Just because you’re not talking directly to 
your subject does not mean that they can’t hear you; in fact, they 
still will hear every word you’re saying, so treat everything that 
you’re saying as suggestion, so why not suggest something to the 
subject and if you still want to carry on suggesting things to them 
but you’re afraid you might take their attention away too much and 
they’ll do whatever I know you’re afraid they’re doing, consider 
this:   
 
If you have a subject in trance, you can turn to the audience and 
you talk about the subject experience in trance like it’s almost like a 
lecture.  They will continue to listen to that as a suggestion.  So, for 
example, stiff arm, yada yada, and so you can see that the arm’s 
stiff and somebody might think that when his eyes are open that 
this whole effect will disappear.  Well, watch what happens when 
he does open his eyes and how amazed he will be when he still 
can’t bend his arm.  Do you think it will work?  No?  Yes?  Well, let’s 
find out.  Open your eyes and try and bend that arm.  How amazed 
do you feel?  Notice how I didn’t even have to give the suggestion 
of feeling amazed.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
273 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
I already gave it in my, shall we say, pre-talk to the audience.  Does 
that make sense?  So you can use this kind of a dual nature reality 
to take the audience response to further suggestions that the 
subject’s going to take on board and to create basically the next 
moment in terms of the showmanship thing because you’re 
teaching both audience and subject what’s coming next, in other 
words, you’ll be amazed and you’ll clap like crazy idiots because 
you’re amazed at how amazed he is, right?  You set the whole thing 
up together.  Does that make sense to you guys?   
 
 
Hypnotic Persona 
 
Igor: 
The other thing is, and this is something – feel free to experiment 
with all kinds of different ways of doing it in terms of who you are 
whilst you are the Street Hypnotist.   
 
This is like your performance persona.  If you feel comfortable being 
yourself, carry on being yourself and that’s a great thing to do.  
Some people like the idea of – they like a particular character 
they’ve seen on TV or a stage magician or something like that and 
they’re trying to emulate that person, and by all means, sometimes 
it’s worth doing it because there’s some things you’ll learn from 
that and get out of that; however, when you want to develop your 
own performance persona, the simplest way of doing this is just 
find some aspect of yourself that is dramatic, that is interesting, 
that you like, that you want to have more of and just present that, 
in other words, it’s almost like a caricature of yourself.   
 
Does that kind of make sense?  So you’re not someone different.  
You’re just a part of yourself but more extremely so, because I can 
guarantee that every one of you in this room at some point has 
been particularly boisterous, right?  You felt a little bit – pushed 
boundaries a little bit, let’s have a little fun with this thing here, 
right?  At some point.  It may not have happened in a while but at

least it has happened and it’s in your personal history.  Some of you 
have been a little bit creepy at times, right?  At least all of you have 
done something which is a little bit like, oh, this is weirding me out.  
This could be part of a performance persona.   
 
Again, you could be that slightly mysterious but it’s like, oh, 
something weird’s going on here.  Everyone in this room has been 
funny at some point.  Would that be fair to say?  So all that you’re 
doing is you’re choosing a moment in time from your own 
personality and you’re choosing to loop that one, to show that one 
in a more dramatic caricatured light and then there’s nothing to 
play up to, there’s nothing to try and emulate or be.  You’re just 
being more of yourself, just being one aspect of yourself.  Does that 
kind of make sense to you guys?  So I encourage you during this 
final session of the formal part of the training to start thinking 
about that.   
 
What is it – what is the feeling you want to have, your performance 
to have?  Is it amazement?  Is it mysterious?  Is it funny?  Is it 
dramatic?  Right?  Find some aspect of your personality that 
matches that mood and get yourself into that mood, just get 
yourself into that frame of mind yourself and do everything from 
there.  Do you see where I’m going with this? 
 
 
Play it BIG! 
 
Anthony: 
We’ve mentioned a few times just getting more out of less, okay?  
How do you make things like this play bigger than they actually are 
because by now this is – you don’t even know if you’re hypnotized 
or not; in fact, you may think you’re not at all.  It’s just a physical 
reaction.  It can start to lose its value.  You can start to lose sight of 
the power of these simple exercises.  So, try and see them as little 
springboards.  We spoke about flow earlier and linkage.  Try and 
see these as springboards to the next response that you want to 
get.  Get as many people involved with this exercise as possible.

Start to get used to working with a group.  The words are pretty 
much the same.   
 
You can use members of the group to encourage the others along.  
That’s right, if you’re there already, close your eyes.  Those of you 
who have already got your eyes closed, I want you to begin – give 
them a task to do; that’s how I generally manage groups when I’m 
doing things like magnetic hands, and I need to buy a bit of time for 
those who are not there yet.  I’ll just give the whole group 
something to do.  Those who get there early, get their 
acknowledgement.  That’s right, those of you who are there 
already, excellent.  Just begin breathing, in for seven and out for 
eleven.   
 
With each breath you take, you’re going to take yourself down, 
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and the rest of you, keep looking closer 
and closer and closer.  So understand you can jump from individuals 
to a group to generalized patter, you can name people.  You won’t 
disrupt the group.  Just keep giving them some attention every now 
and again. When I demonstrated this – I think the first or second 
time I did it, the first time I demonstrated it just with eye closure.  
The second time I demonstrated it, we turned this from a physical 
analogue phenomena into a physical binary phenomena.   
 
I don’t know if you remember me doing that but the way that we 
did that was to stick a load of emotion in the middle of it and then 
tell them it was stuck, exactly the same as Igor’s hand on chest 
which can be delivered covertly.  You don’t even need to mention 
hypnosis to achieve it.  So if we can get from this – you’re thinking, 
yeah, this person is looking fascinated, this is when I’ve made that 
leap, I’m working with someone, I’m doing magnetic fingers and 
their eyes are getting wider and wider and they can’t help but kind 
of comment on it and things are really starting to shake because 
they’re fighting now and losing, that would be the kind of green flag 
for me to think, right, I’m just going to stick those fingers together, 
stick their hands together.

So now I’ve advanced in the process even though I’ve only spent 
perhaps another five or ten seconds trying to achieve that.  Do you 
understand?  This is just trying to get as much juice as we can out of 
these tiny little exercises.  Do you have a question, someone?   
 
Igor: 
So think in these terms:  Every time you do one of these things, like 
a suggestion test or experiment or even an induction with 
someone, you’re going to get a response, some kind of response, 
right?  The question you could ask yourself at this point is, do I go 
down the plain vanilla route which is, I just carry on and do this, and 
I’ll do this one here and then so on, or, is it something like, wow, 
he’s doing really well with this so this is really dramatic.  Can I milk 
this in some other way?  Can I build on this in some other way?  
Right?  Like, for example, when the hand comes up in terms of arm 
levitation, semi dramatic.  For people who haven’t seen this before, 
it can be quite a big deal, right?   
 
But then you’re just linking something to that, aren’t you?  You’re 
linking that emotion, right?  And then later on we linked it to 
something being stuck.  That’s exactly the same process, isn’t it?  
What can you link to this thing happening and what can you take 
from there?  Well, if these things have come together so quickly, 
maybe they’ll get stuck, right?  If your hands are stuck, what else 
can get stuck?  It might be your voice.  You try and say your name 
but it’s stuck inside your throat.  What’s your name?  Do you see 
where we’re going with this?  You’re asking yourself, what’s just 
happened?  What else can happen that’s so similar to this that with 
a simple suggestion it will just convert over, right?   
 
We’ll just throw a couple of examples so you guys can start thinking 
these ways.  Remember when we did this thing here and you’ll 
close your eyes and be deeply relaxed.  What does this look like?  
Like an induction, right?  So really, if someone really responds like 
this really well, well, it’s already told you it’s an instant induction, 
hasn’t it?  So this point, if you wanted to, you could very simply say, 
that’s right, all the way into trance now and suddenly the audience 
goes, ah, I missed it; when did that happen?  And you see how it 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
277 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
becomes really dramatic at that point?  All you’re doing is you’re 
riding on the coattails of something that is already occurring 
spontaneously.  Is this making sense to you guys now? 
 
Anthony: 
For some of you that have done re-inductions, so you’ve set 
everything up, you’ll know that the re-induction is often the biggest 
and most dramatic bit of the show.  That’s where a lot of the 
audience goes, ah, just because, click, they’re out, they’ve seen – all 
of their expectations about how hypnosis works has just been 
fulfilled.  A hypnotist clicks their fingers and says sleep and the 
person drops like that. 
 
Igor: 
How might you put together this thing here, and exactly what 
Anthony was just talking about?  Just think about it.  How would 
you link the two together, if you saw someone respond to this quite 
dramatically, what might you do to be able to milk it and take it 
straight to something else, something like what Anthony was 
talking about?  Any ideas?  Just think of it this way:  We’ve already 
given you the answer which is, just put them together.  That’s right.  
And just tell them what’s going to happen:  In a moment, I’ll ask you 
to open your eyes, and then I’ll click my fingers and say the word, 
sleep.   
 
When you hear this sound and you hear me say the word, sleep, 
you will close your eyes just like this.  You will relax just as deeply as 
this or even deeper and you’ll instantly be in a deep state of 
hypnosis.  All of you here understand?  Okay.  Open your eyes, wide 
awake, okay, sleep – 
 
Anthony: 
You’ll get a massive reaction from that. 
 
Igor: 
And it’s easy for you so you’ve already set it up.  Do you see where 
we’re going with this, guys? 
 
Anthony: 
Another thing, and again, it’s quite a small point but to me it’s 
important.  It’s another way of testing your work but also building a 
reaction.  So when I kick off and I’m doing – let’s say I’m doing 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
278 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
magnetic fingers, magnetic hands, and a handshake induction, 
that’s my usual approach.  If I’m getting this and the person’s like, 
oh, that’s weird and they’re already starting to testify to the 
strangeness of this happening, then I’ll just drop a completely 
innocuous suggestion that everyone will miss, like – and this is 
going to freak you out, when your fingers touch this, this is going to 
seem really weird to you; this is going to crack you up.   
 
So they’re like, oh, that was so freaky; that was so weird, and I 
think, good, he took that suggestion.  Put your hands out in front of 
you.  This time we’re going to do this and this.  They’re going to 
move automatically, closer and closer, that’s right.  You’re going to 
get that same strange feeling, that’s right, it’s going to freak you out 
even more.  They’re just concentrating on the magnets, all those 
other ideas are being taken on board, and I’ve tested it so I know 
it’s more than just a ripple of, oh, yeah, that’s weird, because I’ve 
said, and when your hands touch, you’re going to scream out loud, 
and there’s nothing driving that scream.  There is no good reason 
for them to scream at all.   
 
They haven’t seen anything scary or surprising – bang, massive 
scream.  And I just know – the job is already done; the induction is 
just a flourish at that point. 
 
Igor: 
Think of this in these terms.  Here a simple effect.  Would it be fair 
to say that the finger vise is a very simple effect?  Is that fair to say? 
 
Audience Members: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Now, off that simple effect, you can do multiple things with it.  On 
the one side, you can attach onto it an emotion, whether it’s being 
freaked out, whether it’s excitement, whether it’s just laughing like 
a school girl.  It doesn’t really matter what it is.  You’re going to 
attach an emotion onto it.  The other thing you can do is you can 
expand what that thing actually meant.  For example, what has to 
be happening – if those fingers have come together, right, let’s 
ignore the physical, shall we say, cheat that we put into it, but these 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
279 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
fingers are coming together.  What is the perception that’s actually 
going on there?  What do people think?  What is the logical 
conclusion that people normally will come to?  Any ideas?   
 
Audience Member: They’re being hypnotized. 
 
Igor: 
They’re being hypnotized but, what, because their fingers – there’s 
automatic movement, in other words, the unconscious mind is in 
control of the hands and the conscious mind is not.  Would that be 
fair to say that’s the logical conclusion that you’d come to?  Right?  
So if you expand that idea, what else is possible?  If the unconscious 
mind is running the hands now and the conscious mind can’t resist 
it, what else can you do with the hands that are completely in 
unconscious control but not in conscious control?  Think about it.  
You can have levitation; you can have sticking; you can have 
movement, because these are all examples of exactly the same 
thing.  So you see now, when one thing is working, you not only can 
take the response but you can continue to increase – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, that whole class of phenomena open up so then it’s just a 
case of how you play it. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  And then something else happens, right?  So you’ve 
expanded upon what that specific phenomenon means, right?  
You’ve expanded from automatic motion; this is essential to 
automatic emotion.  Now we’re going to have automatic motion in 
the hands in other ways: upwards, sideways, sticking this, immobile 
and so on.  But then we have, shall we say, an analogue class of 
phenomena that are really the same thing, just in a different part of 
the body.  In hypnotherapy the classic version may be, you make 
the left hand numb and then you can transfer the numbness to 
some area that’s in pain.  That’s one of the classic pain control 
methods, right?   
 
I won’t say the most inventive or useful one, I think, but it works, 
clearly because you’ve transferred the power from one hand to 
another.  Well, you can see just the normal linkage process going on 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
280 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
here, right?  So now we have something which is we have 
automatic motions in the hands and now the hands, say, are stuck 
here because they’ve come together.  So now we have a couple of 
possibilities here, don’t we?  There’s the idea of sticking.  What else 
can stick?  Well, if the hands can stick, maybe the feet can stick, or 
lips can stick, or the gums can stick, or the teeth can stick, or the 
tongue can stick.  Do you see where we’re going with this? 
 
You’re transferring the power of sticking onto some other part of 
them.  Do you see where we’re going with this?  This is yes, this is 
no, this is, like, huh?  Can I go back to bed now?  So then you can 
use this as a bridge towards another effect, right?  So if something 
is sticking, how can you have an effect that has nothing to do with 
sticking and you use sticking as a mechanism to create it?  Start 
thinking creatively, folks. 
 
Anthony: 
You can make it so one thought sticks in their mind. 
 
Igor: 
Right.   
 
Anthony: 
We have a routine a bit like that.  The only thing you can say is 
headhacking.com.  And you can ask any question you like and that’s 
the only answer that comes out. 
 
Igor: 
Right.  You can stick other things.  You could stick, for example, you 
could stick their tongue shut so that they can’t say anything.  So 
now you have – you can create the illusion of amnesia but you’re 
doing it through the sticking mechanism.  Say your name, you’ve 
forgotten it.  Even if you try and get it out, it just sticks in your 
throat.  Now, as far as everyone else is concerned, they’ve 
forgotten their name but it doesn’t matter because even if they can 
say their name, you stuck it inside their throat; it’s not coming out.  
So as far as the performance goes, it’s still strong.  Do you see how 
you have so many different directions that you can take something 
in.  Does that make sense to you guys?   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
281 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
So I think what we’re going to do now is get you guys to sit down 
together in groups of five and just give you about – not too long, 
just about five or six minutes.  I want you to take – we’ll come to 
you in a second – I want you to take just this simple phenomenon, 
finger vise, or if you prefer, magnetic hands, just choose one of 
those two though.   
 
I want you to discuss, what are all the things that can lead off from 
there.  What emotions could you attach to it to make it more 
dramatic?  What things are going on inside of that that you can 
expand the category of to create other impressive things, or, where 
can you transfer that thing to so that something completely 
different seems to happen but actually you’re just transferring the 
operative element of this onto some other part of the body, mind, 
emotions and so on.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
And if you haven’t taken that into a lock yet and you have time, 
then try and push for that, some of you, if you haven’t done that 
yet. 
 
Igor: 
So you had a quick question? 
 
Audience Member: To lock your fingers or hands using a sort of VAK type imagery, it’s 
because you say, think of someone you’re bonded to, now your 
hands are bonded together?  Is that the linkage or – 
 
Anthony: 
You could do that. 
 
Audience Member: But what is your intention when you do that? 
 
Anthony: 
The key phrase comes at the end.  Yes, I talk about visual, auditory, 
and kinesthetic stuff but I’m not hung up on the VAK model.  I just 
machine gun it and give them everything.  So it’s exactly the same 
at this point.  Your fingers are going to come together, that’s right, 
millimeters to go now when they come together, I’d like you just to 
allow your eyes to close.  With your eyes closed, I normally say, I 
want you to enjoy this and then I go in one of two ways, and I’ve 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
282 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
often framed this is as, I’ll show you what it’s about; I guarantee 
this will make you feel good.  The first way I go is, fingers touch, 
your eyes closed, that’s right, with your eyes closed, hands sticking 
tighter and tighter.   
 
I’m still emphasizing the magnets but I haven’t suggested they’re 
stuck yet, so I haven’t challenged it. When they touch your eyes 
close and I say, with your eyes closed, think about the person who 
is dearest to you on this planet and I normally just say, if there’s 
more than one, see more than one, because people can’t decide 
between their kids and they get confused and they feel guilty and 
stuff.  If there’s more than one, see more than one.  See their eyes; 
see them smiling; hear their voice; hear their laughter; feel what 
you feel for them; step into a memory involving them; get into your 
body there if you’re not already, and this is the line that does it, as 
far as I’m concerned:   
 
As you feel that – so I’ve just said, feel the bond you have for them, 
feel the love you have for that person – as you feel that and as you 
listen to the sound of my voice your fingers are becoming stuck and 
bolted, glued together, stuck together, as you feel that and as you 
listen to me.  Okay?  So one is, I’m giving them a bit of emotional 
blackmail here, not really blackmail but just a little nudge that, you 
want to carry on feeling that, keep listening, and as you feel that, 
they are feeling it but I’m also pacing their experience – as you feel 
that – they can’t deny they’re feeling it because they’re visualizing 
seeing this person.   
 
That’s not logical but the next one’s even more illogical which is:  
And as you listen to my voice, there’s no reason why listening to my 
voice should mean your fingers are stuck but because as you’re 
feeling that, and they’re feeling it, and as you listen to my voice, 
they’re hearing it, your fingers are becoming stuck and bolted.  It 
just becomes accepted, a bit like, look at your hand as it moves 
towards your face.  Your eyes will begin to change focus, as you 
become aware of your eyes close, your eyes – the same thing – it’s 
like, this is happening, this is happening, oh, has happened, it’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
283 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
really over.  So as you feel that.  So I’ll often do that, I’ll always use 
that in any kind of personal therapeutic situation.   
 
Yesterday, because of the nature of why we’re here, when I 
demoed this, I think I asked if the guy had kids, he said no, hasn’t 
got to be kids.  I’m sure he could think of another loved one, but I 
just took it in the other track I normally take it, which is, when your 
fingers touch, allow your eyes to close; that’s right, I want you to 
enjoy this; go out into a fantasy and I want you to picture 
something you’d love to do, something you’d love to achieve.  
When you’re got something in mind, nod your head for me.  Now, 
make it as perfect as you can.  See yourself out there being the man 
you want to be, achieving the things you want to achieve, create 
that perfect future event.   
 
When you see that – again, I’ll often get verification – just nod your 
head for me – then I’ll go for the dissociation.  I’ll say, if you’re not 
there already, step into your body.  You’re there seeing what you 
can see, hearing what you can hear, feeling what you can feel, and 
as you feel that and as you listen to me, your fingers are becoming 
stuck and bolted and glued together.  So it’s the same thing: he’s 
gone out, he’s seen himself as a big time stage hypnotist, he’s now 
on stage feeling all that, and as he feels that and as he listens, your 
fingers are becoming stuck and bolted. 
 
Igor: 
So the pattern is very simple.  You’ve had one success, fingers 
coming together.  You attach something else to it, in this case, the 
future memory of something he wants to happen -  
 
Anthony: 
It’s really to raise emotion, however I get there. 
 
Igor: 
So you’ve got basically this thing here.  All you do now is you loop 
that emotion back to the expanded category of that which is 
basically from fingers moving to fingers stuck and you’re using the 
emotional thing as kind of leverage saying, well, if you want to hang 
onto this, this will happen too.  See, that kind of makes this thing 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
284 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
here fill up with that emotion, which is of course an unconscious 
response; hence, it’s a more loaded response.  That’s all that is. 
 
Anthony: 
Just a final aspect to this.  We’ve spoken about kind of testing your 
work a lot.  We haven’t necessarily spoken about the best way of 
doing that testing, and again, for me, this is an opportunity – when 
you start the test, you’ve created this effect, when you start the 
test, you can break the effect completely.  So I tend to stagger my 
tests.  They’re kind of progressive little tests that start very soft, 
almost invisibly and then will get up to the much more proving it 
and getting them to really challenge it.  So in this situation, their 
fingers will come together, they have this emotional thing.  I could 
just let them out at that point.   
 
I could say, now, just allow your hands to come apart, drift down, 
and open your eyes; good, that show me you can concentrate.  I 
could just move on.  But if I’ve gone for this lock, okay, I’ll say, and 
as you feel that, your fingers are becoming stuck and bolted, glued, 
I’ll hammer that suggestion in a few times and then this is my first 
test, and when you realize they’re stuck, raise them up a little 
higher so I understand.  When you realize they’re stuck.  Now, stuck 
is ambiguous, it’s vague enough.  Stuck could mean, my fingers 
have touched.  Stuck could mean, they don’t seem to be coming 
apart.  Stuck could mean, I’m desperately trying to pull my hands 
apart here and they are stuck.   
 
It can mean any of those things but what I find is, the traditional 
hand lock which kind of works on ten, twenty percent of any 
audience, is fine, if you’ve got a big audience for Stage Hypnosis, 
but if I’m giving a lecture or I’m doing a gig for, say, fifty, hundred, 
hundred and fifty people, then I still want to do this audience test 
and I want to get as many locks as I can.  I find with this I’ll get 
seventy or eighty percent of the audience to give this initial raise of 
their hands, okay?  It’s too many people for me to work with.  So 
now I can test a little bit harder.  I can say, that’s right, and use the 
language, try and pull them apart, find they’re stuck, and I’ll lose 
some people.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
285 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
I say, try even harder, really put some effort in.  For some of you, 
they’re going to start to shake, so I’m now just looking for this, I’m 
looking for the half dozen people I actually need for my lecture or 
the two people I need for my lecture, the ten people I need for my 
stage show, but it’s the same thing.  If I’m giving arm levitation, it’s 
all going nicely; you should all be able to do this by now, giving arm 
levitation.  That’s where it’s going to get lighter and lighter, higher 
and higher, and the higher it gets, the lighter it is going to feel.  So 
when it’s lifting, I’ll say, try and keep it still and find you cannot.  So 
I’m not asking them to put it down; I’m asking them to just keep it 
where it is.   
 
If they keep it where it is, it doesn’t matter, I’ll work it some more.  
But I say, try and keep it steady and find it goes even higher, is what 
I normally say, give it a direction I want.  And when I get that, I’ll 
say, that’s right, try even harder, find it just lifts up even higher.  
Now they’ve succeeded twice.  Now I’m prepared to say, try and 
put it down and find that you cannot, and when they can’t, I’m then 
prepared to say, in a minute I’ll click my fingers, your eyes will open, 
you’ll look at that hand, you’ll believe it’s somebody else’s hand.  Is 
that your arm?  I think so.  
 
Igor: 
By the way guys – 
 
Anthony: 
So even the tests are progressive. 
 
Igor: 
Do you notice how even, when he was talking about that, it is 
exactly the same thing.  We start off with a light test, is a small part 
of this bubble, then we have a bigger test, which is the whole part 
of this bubble, and then we’ll add onto it basically a completely 
different bubble that wasn’t there in the first place which is an 
expansion of the whole thing.  So the test actually can become a 
whole new set of suggestions.  It’s constantly expanding what they 
are capable of, what this whole thing means.  And really, that’s 
what it comes down to, what we’re talking about here.  What 
you’re doing is you’re expanding the meaning of whatever it is they

happen to be experiencing at that point in time.  The larger the 
meaning, the more dramatic the effect will be.  Does that kind of 
make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
So if you can get through the – as you rack up through these tests 
and that feeling of involuntariness is growing, you’ve got to 
understand they’re now just experiencing so it becomes very easy 
then to start directing their emotion and how they feel about it and 
build out from there. 
 
Igor: 
So here’s what I’m going to do.  Let’s change the exercise around a 
little bit, just in the light of this.  What I’d like you to do is get into 
groups of five people in a moment’s time.  We’ll have all the 
assistants float around to come in from time to time to help you, 
give you little bits of advice and so on.  What we’re going to have is 
only one hypnotist per group, one subject per group, and you 
choose either the finger vice or the magnetic hands as your 
experiment of choice.  Is that good?  So far, so easy, right?   
 
Now, as you are going through this or this, you, the hypnotist, your 
job will be to start expanding what is happening in terms of what it 
means to that person, and then suggest the expanded meaning, 
and the job of everyone else watching will be to suggest to the 
hypnotist other ways that he can use whatever is happening to 
expand the meaning to make it seem more dramatic, sound more 
dramatic and therefore be more dramatic because you’ve changed 
what it all means.  Does that make sense to you guys?  And 
assistants will float around and when they see something 
happening, they can just come in again and say, oh, look at this, 
why don’t you try suggesting this or try suggesting that to get more 
of this effect, you’re really milking a tiny little sequence into a huge 
and dramatically powerful demonstration. 
 
Anthony: 
Imagine this is all you’ve got to perform with, simple as that. 
 
Igor: 
Right, that’s all you can do.

Anthony: 
It’s a throw-away piece of magnetic fingers.  This is all you’re 
allowed to perform with.  How much value can you get out of it, 
and everything else that we’ve taught, the whole list of 
phenomena, can be linked to this one schoolboy effect. 
 
Igor: 
Jonas, did you have a question or comment? 
 
Jonas: 
Yeah, a quick one.  If there’s anyone that feels like they’re going to 
get somewhere and they have got phenomena going and it hasn’t 
been filmed at all yet, they can come over to me.  I’ll give you a 
mike so that we can actually hear what you’re saying inside here 
when it’s loud and I will focus the camera on you and you will get a 
little run through. 
 
Igor: 
If you wish it. 
 
Jonas: 
If anyone feels confident that hasn’t been filmed yet. 
 
Igor: 
Just play it by ear, guys.  If you want to call Jonas over and be on 
sound and camera, then, by all means, do so, and if not, that’s fine 
too.  We’ll just go play it.  So you understand the nature of the 
exercise.  Is that correct?  Yes?  Let me try that again:  Do you 
understand the nature of the exercise? 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  Stand up.  We’re only going to give you seven 
minutes because we have a few more bits to do.  Only one person is 
going to be a hypnotist for the whole exercise, okay? 
 
 
Student Demo 
 
Audience Member: All right, here we go.  Let’s do something fun here, okay?  Let me 
have you extend your hands directly out in front of you.  Lock them 
together, just like that and lace them up nice and tight, nice and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
288 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
tight, yeah, just like that.  Now, I want you to pull them up just like 
you would do inside a casino because that’s where prayers really 
matter.  All right, yes.  Now I want you to extend your fingers up like 
this about an inch apart.  Yeah, that’s right.  Focus all your attention 
right here in that little inch, that’s right.  That’s right.  You notice 
they’re starting to come together.   
 
As they come together, just like huge electro-magnets powered by 
all the lights in Vegas, oh, yes, they’re all pumped in here, and when 
they finally get together feel your eyes will close.  Just allow them 
to close.  All right.  Now, while your eyes are closed, your hands are 
tightly together, pulled together like powerful, powerful electro-
magnets, as much power as it runs all the lights on the strip; that’s 
it.  All right, as you feel that, I want you to remember the most 
important people in your life, how you feel about them.  I want you 
to see their eyes; I want you to see their faces; I want you to feel 
what you feel when you first see them; that’s right; put all your 
attention on that feeling.   
 
That’s right, let it go.  As you hear my voice, you feel that feeling 
grow.  As you feel that feeling grow, you feel your hands stuck 
together; that’s right.  The more they stick, the more you feel that, 
the better it feels and the more you hear my voice suggesting, you 
want to feel that even more.  That’s right.  So as you start thinking 
about that, what else could be stuck?  All kinds of things could be 
stuck.  You’ve seen things stuck with glue, you’ve seen things 
welded together, hammered together with nails, and bolted 
together with nuts and bolts.  Those things are just stuck.  Imagine 
your smile being stuck that way.  Yes, lips together, nice and tight, 
hiding the teeth.  That’s right.  Imagine that smile.   
 
All right, now I want you to open your eyes and look at your hands.  
Look at your hands.  How are your hands right now?  Are they 
stuck?  That’s right.  Close your eyes, can’t answer because your lips 
are glued together.  What else could we glue together?  I don’t 
know, possibly your feet to the floor but I think probably only your 
left foot.  Imagine your left foot right now stuck deep with crazy 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
289 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
glue.  It’s stuck there good and hard.  Now, show me you can lift 
just your right foot.  Lifting your right foot, yeah, no problem.  Now 
try to lift that left foot, try to lift it up, up, not going.  The harder 
you try, the harder it sticks.  Oh, my God, look at that.  All right.  
Pretty funny, isn’t it?   
 
Oop, can’t open your mouth, can you?  All right, go ahead and relax.  
I’m going to count from one to three and when I get to three you’re 
going to come back to normal awareness and everything’s going to 
be normal except your lips.  Those are going to go ahead and stay 
stuck but your foot’s going to be okay, your hands are going to be 
undone – one, two and three – all right, wide awake, wide awake.  
How are you doing?  You all right?  Good, good.  Okay, in a moment 
I’m going to tell you we’re going to relax those lips a bit, a little bit, 
we’re just going to relax them, go back and relax the lips first, sleep, 
nice, down and down, down.   
 
In a moment I’m going to tell you to relax your lips and when I do, 
the number between two and four is going to drop out of your 
memory because it’s really not important right now.  You learned 
that in elementary school.  You don’t need it right now.  It’s all 
gone.  So, all right.  Here we go; you’re going to relax those lips.  All 
right, bang, they’re lose, your lips are open, no longer stuck 
together.  Those three numbers have fallen out of your memory.  
I’m going to bring you back into a normal awareness so you can 
come back with everything just right except for that nasty number 
is out of your picture – one, two and four – wide away, wide awake.  
All right.  How many fingers am I holding up here?   
 
I want you to count them out for me, just one at a time.  Correct, 
and one more time, just so everybody can see it.  All right, nice, all 
right.  All right, now we’re going to think about that again but 
numbers mean nothing to you.  You learned all that stuff when you 
were a little kid and you really don’t need it anymore.  They mean 
nothing so when you come out, you’re going to look down, they’re 
all just going to come into random order, just randomly and you’re 
okay with that because they’re really unimportant and they just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
290 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
don’t matter to you, and wide awake, wide awake.  All right.  Count 
off the fingers I’m holding up here.  Excellent.  All right.  How many 
people are in this course?  Yeah, right about.   
 
How tall would you say he is?  Yeah, right about, and sleep.  All 
right, I’m going to count from one to three, you’ve done a really, 
really excellent job here.  All right.  I want you to remember that 
feeling you had, remember the feeling you had thinking about 
those you love, those people that really matter to you and I want 
that feeling to grow and I want you to bring that back and when you 
come back everything is going to be back to normal, all your 
memories are back to normal, you remember everything you did 
and remember how funny it was.  All right?  One, two, three, back 
to normal; great job; great job.  Thank you.   
 
Well, I just basically started with the hand clasp and saw what he 
was willing to take from there, and since he was a really excellent 
subject, went along, was happy to go along with it, I went for broke, 
like, okay, we can go ahead and see if can get some sticky physical 
phenomenon.  Once I got those, I readily got those because he was 
really willing to give them, then I thought, well, let’s see if we can 
make him have a negative hallucination and once that was easily 
demonstrated, then we pushed it a little farther and got him to 
randomize, do things that didn’t make any sense but seemed to 
make sense to him, then just gave him the emotional reward of the 
family connection.   
 
Every time he did something that we asked him to, he got the rush 
of feeling, of positive family connections, so given the emotional 
reward for correct responses.   
 
Jonas:  
 
How long have you been training? 
 
Audience Member: In this style, about one day.

More BIG Ideas 
 
Igor: 
Okay, who found that interesting?  Was that useful? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So did you notice how easy it can be to miss just lots and lots of 
potentially useful things, right?  Here’s a couple of examples of 
some of the things I saw, and one example, we had the finger vise 
at the end of which they were nicely in trance and notice what my 
hands have just done?  Do you see what my hands have just done?  
What have they just done?  They’re relaxed, right?  Now, at this 
point, are you going to go with sticking the hands together?  No, 
because there’s less tension there.  There’s less pressure putting 
them together.  What can you go with instead? 
 
Audience Member: Answer:  Your arms are so relaxed, you can’t move them. 
 
Igor: 
Right, so you can still get a hand stuck, now using relaxation as 
being stuck, limp, look at that, limp on a chair.  Try and lift that 
hand but it’s like it’s not even yours.  It’s like it’s just a piece of meat 
just lying there, just heavy and resting on your arm.  You can feel it 
on your leg; you might not even feel the arm, right?  So you’ve gone 
with a sliver of response and you’re augmenting it to something 
really dramatic, right?  If, on the other hand, close your eyes and 
then relax all the way down, and they’re like this, what does that 
give you?  Right?  Those hands are now sticking tighter and tighter 
together because they’re still doing it.  See how that works?   
 
There is never a response that can’t be used or rather, a “oh, 
nothing is happening”.  A lot of people say, oh, what’s going on 
now?  Nothing.  There is never nothing going on.  It’s just your 
creativity in terms of finding a frame, in other words, a new 
meaning to whatever that nothing is that’s better than nothing, and 
then it will become that.  Is it starting to make sense to you guys 
now?  Do you find this exercise useful?  So really start thinking 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas

about this, especially tonight when you start going out and doing 
these things because, sure, you can run through all these routines 
up to the point of amnesia and then just make up new stuff.   
 
That’s absolutely an approach, but if you want to be a consummate 
performer, you will be able to milk every single thing, and as 
Anthony said many times, and I absolutely one hundred percent 
agree with him, you should be able to wow a crowd for half an hour 
just with this.  You can do it and people will be – they’ll be talking 
about it for years to come because the magic in the performance 
comes from you, the meaning that you attach to things, not from 
some strange physical phenomena.  Does that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
Just an equivalent.  You may or may not know much about séances 
and that kinds of work, with pendulums or bell rings or glass moves, 
there is so much build to get to the point where that wine glass 
moves and everyone’s hands on it – 
 
Igor: 
And think about it, how much is that?  That’s like a little tiny motion 
like that.  You can get ten times that. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s where you got to be – I saw a big change in the groups as I 
came around there.  I think it was you at the back there; you had a 
stiff arm going on.  You looked like you were enjoying it, you really 
looked like you were performing with it, you were pushing it down 
and you were talking and you were illustrating it to the audience 
and you looked like you were having fun, so they’re all standing 
there grinning, thinking, this is fun, someone poking someone’s arm 
and it jumping back up again is amusing, and it is because you’re 
amused and you’re playing it big, as you should.  I saw you did really 
well there.   
 
I’m not sure if everything took in the end but you were like, fingers 
stuck, and now your foot is sticking; that foot is sticking, and you 
gave the suggestion as you should.  You repeated it.  You gave it in 
different ways.  You illustrated what that means to them right now 
as a human being and you can realize that and so on and so forth

and the fact is, nothing had actually changed.  Nothing had really 
been tested, but to the outside observer, he’s stuck; he can’t move; 
he’s not going anywhere, and if you really want to push it, you can 
obviously, test it. 
 
Igor: 
And this is exactly how you’ll get amnesia which is really the 
platform on which all the effects that you want to be able to create 
comes from.  Once you get amnesia really, that’s the magic portal 
for everything else really, and amnesia is no different than turning 
this into finger stuck.  So what do you think might be an example of 
a low level form of amnesia?  Come on guys? 
 
Audience Members: Forgetting your keys. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, an example in everyday life might be forgetting your keys.  I’m 
talking about just an experience they can have right now. 
 
Anthony: 
I can’t quite remember it.  I know I know it. 
 
Igor: 
Right? 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, you know, it just slipped my mind.  You know you know it.  The 
moment you hear it, of course, that’s it. 
 
Igor: 
So, notice how we haven’t asked for full-blown, you don’t know 
your name, you don’t know where you are, you don’t know where 
you live, you don’t know anything about anything.  That’s just going 
all the way through to the end.  In the traditional circles, it’s called 
the law of successive approximations, right?  Each time, you start 
with a little seed and that takes, then next one gets bigger and 
bigger and bigger and bigger until you have that full blown effect 
that you’re looking for.  And everyone has had the experience of 
something slipping their mind, haven’t they?  And if you say to 
someone, oh, you know what?  In a moment I’m going to ask you – 
in a moment you’ll find the number 3 has slipped your mind.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
294 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It slips away.  What does it mean, slipped your mind?  For a 
moment you’re inattentive, because maybe you’re thinking about 
your foot.  Of course it slipped your mind because you’re not 
thinking about it, right, so not thinking about it goes to slipping your 
mind, slipping your mind goes to it’s on the tip of your tongue, the 
tip of your tongue’s kind of annoying, gets a little frustrating and 
then the harder you try, the further away it gets and the further 
away it gets, comes to a point where did you know it at all?  Maybe 
you didn’t even know it.  Do you see there’s a sliding escalation – a 
sliding form of escalating the effect from something innocuous like 
slipping your mind or not paying attention to something all the way 
through to, not even knowing it existed.  Do you see, it’s really the 
same phenomenon on a different part of a sliding scale?  Does that 
make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony:  
And the point being that you can perform wherever they are on 
that scale. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
 
Anthony: 
You can perform – in fact, I think it’s almost most entertaining when 
it’s on the tip of their tongue, to the point that quite often that’s 
where we put it with suggestion: it’s on the tip of your tongue but it 
will not come out of your mouth, that kind of suggestion because at 
that level you get frustration, you get annoyance, you get the 
person thinking, no, just let me do it.  Right at the other end – and 
this does apply to other phenomena as well, but right at the other 
end, where it’s just normal, they don’t know their name, they don’t 
have a name, it can actually be less entertaining.  I had that in a 
show where I said to a girl – she’d done everything by that point – 
you don’t know your name.   
 
You cannot say, speak, think your name; it’s gone completely, and 
that was very normal for her when her eyes opened so she wasn’t 
bothered.  And I said, what’s your name?  She said, I don’t have a 
name.  I was like, you must have a name.  What’s your name?  I 
don’t know my name.  Why don’t you know your name?  I don’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
295 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
have a name.  It was just like, the sky is blue, just a statement of 
fact for her.  It wasn’t even that funny.  But that’s right at the other 
extreme.  All I’m saying is at some point the experience of amnesia, 
even though we’re inducing it in others, is totally akin to the natural 
experience of amnesia you’ve had.   
 
So that’s kind of the mindset, my facial expressions, my body 
language, my tone of voice when I’m asking people questions about 
the thing that they’ve got amnesia for is going to all add to this, it’s 
all going to suggest that you will not be able to remember this.  So, 
it’s like me asking you, do you remember the surname that was two 
steps before yours in the register at primary school?  You’ve got no 
idea but I guarantee, if we went through that register from the 
beginning to the end, some of those core names who were friends 
of yours would come up and you’d start to hear it and it would get 
closer and when you heard it, you’d say, yeah, it was so-and-so.   
 
It is in there, but when I asked the question, I didn’t expect you to 
be able to remember that piece of information.  I wasn’t hopeful 
and my face didn’t suggest it was.  It suggested, this is going to be 
really hard.  So, shall we break amnesia down?  Is that what you 
want to do? 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, let’s break it down into the ways of getting it, but before we 
do that, very quickly, I wanted to add something to the point he’s 
making just to emphasize it.  When you’re presenting, especially 
something like amnesia, you want to perform it.  It gives a non-
verbal suggestion, right?  You say you can’t remember number 
three, number three is gone.  To some extent that’s a good 
suggestion and at some point you’re actually reaffirming the very 
thing you don’t want.  So what I like to do at some point is literally 
forget myself what I want them to forget:  Number Three is gone, 
the number is gone and if I ask you to count from one to five, you’ll 
go one, two – right?   
 
Do you see what I’m just doing now?  I’m modeling the behavior; 
I’m modeling the mindset for you so that it’s more likely to take.

Has anyone ever had that sense when someone in the room is 
doing something, you suddenly go, oh, yeah, there might be a yawn 
or someone’s playing a game and you get sucked into the whole 
experience?  That’s part of what we’re doing here.  Should we 
break it down very quickly then? 
 
 
The Amnesia Ladder 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, any of these ideas can be expressed just directly.  When I click 
my fingers, your eyes will open, you won’t be able to remember 
your name, plain English, okay?   
 
 
So that’s where I’d normally start.  So I’ve kind of got a moment I’m 
going to pin that on.  When I do this or when that hand unsticks, I 
prefer that moment to be a predicament they’re in, such as their 
hand is stuck to their head or can’t lift it off the table.  Okay?  So we 
want the strong moment, if there’s a predicament ideally.  The way 
out of that predicament is going to be their name is going to drop 
out of their mind.  So first off I’m going to say it directly:  You will 
forget your name, okay?  Then I’m going to say it indirectly – 
 
Igor: 
Why don’t you write it a little bit larger?  I think people are having 
difficulty reading it. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay, I’m having trouble reading it myself actually.  We’re going to 
say it directly; we’re going to say it indirectly.  So indirectly I’m 
going to rattle through maybe half a dozen ways of saying this.  So 
I’ll say:  You cannot remember your name.  It will be gone, rubbed 
out of your mind.  It will disappear for a time as if it never existed.  
You can add – you getting the idea?  It’s disappearing, it’s getting 
further and further away; it’s over that building; it’s on the tip of 
your tongue. 
 
Igor: 
It’s on the tip of your tongue; you can’t quite get it; you kind of 
know it but it’s just not there.

Anthony: 
The harder you try and remember it, the more difficult it becomes.  
I’m just sowing the idea – 
 
Igor: 
A blank, an empty space.  It’s like sitting in an exam and you know 
you know the answer but it just won’t come.  Do you see how 
they’re all examples that reinforce the idea of not having access to 
the information? 
 
Anthony: 
Okay.  Now, the other little thing I want to add is that occasionally 
when you’re giving the suggestion, you’ve got to understand the 
situation that the subject’s in is that at the moment they start to 
hear suggestions for amnesia, it’s just a human instinct to say, huh, I 
know my name, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  I 
know my name, I know my name, and they’re repeating it, 
repeating it, repeating it, which is fine because we’re going to 
distract them in a moment.  We’re going to stop that process, but 
I’ve had a couple of – and these are literally only two or three 
occasions where in the middle of giving an amnesia suggestion, the 
person has popped out of hypnosis and one was a math teacher, 
one was an accountant and it was during suggestions for forgetting 
the Number Three.   
 
At some level, they’ve just thought, I need the number three.  And 
that has been enough for them to think – and it spooked them a 
little and they’d come out.  So I’m just going to give them some 
reassurance by just saying, just for a time.  It’s as simple as that.  If 
you’re giving amnesia, just say, it will be gone, forgotten, 
completely rubbed out of your mind; it will just disappear 
completely, just for a time.  The harder you try and remember it, 
the more distant it will become; just for a time your name will be 
gone as if it’s completely forgotten.  Yeah? 
 
Audience Member: Okay, so if it’s something that’s not terribly important to them, like 
saying – if they’re not into math and you say the Number Three is 
gone –

298 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
Just grab the mic and – 
 
Audience Member: You have to tell them that it’s not gone.  So if you suggested the 
number three is no longer there and they’re not the types, like an 
accountant or a mathematics teacher, to pop out, and you forget to 
tell them, will they eventually retrieve that number or – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  Look, the way I look at it, it’s kind of semi-transparent 
realities, right?  None of them are real.  The one you’ve got right 
now, it just seems real to you.  So I’m presenting another one and 
I’m trying to get that one to come in front.  If I just give you a 
ridiculous suggestion, whatever, your name is Jenny and you want 
to be called Jenny from now on, then that will stick for a time, and 
when I first learned hypnosis – and your question is really, how long 
does a post hypnotic suggestion last?  I would read facts about it, 
like, it lasts six days or between ten and fourteen days, and stuff 
like – 
 
Igor: 
Two point four seconds. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, which is nonsense.  However, if I give you a ridiculous 
suggestion, you’re going about in life and all your documents are 
saying your actual name and other people are calling you by this 
name, you know your name’s Jenny and you want to be called 
Jenny from now on, but it keeps bashing up against this other 
reality and eventually it will start to fracture.  And again, I 
mentioned Vince, one of the guys that worked with us, earlier, and 
Vince has been experimenting with hypnosis for a long time.  I hope 
you don’t mind me telling your story, about the cat.  Am I allowed 
to tell that story? 
 
Vince: 
Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
One of his ex-girlfriends who was a good subject, he just told her – 
as all his girlfriends seem to be – he just told her that she had a cat.  
She didn’t have a cat.  He just told her that she had a cat and that 
have had a cat for a long time, and just really to see how long

something as ridiculous as that will stand up, and she was a bit 
upset that there was no cat food in the cupboard and come home 
from work and the window was open and the cat’s escaped; 
where’s the cat, and looked for the cat.  And that lasted for about 
three-and-a-half days.  In the supplement to my book, Reloaded, 
there’s an e-mail correspondence.  It’s completely as it happened, 
it’s unedited.   
 
Someone bought the book, had a go, got into this kind of stuff, 
hadn’t done any big phenomena but his auntie was coming round 
and she was into crystals, therefore, she will be good at this.  That 
was his thinking, it gave him the confidence.  She was good at it.  He 
made himself invisible.  Her son was there, like, his cousin, his 
friend.  He said, whenever Bobby clicks his fingers he will vanish, 
and I’ve got this e-mail saying that, so I left her with a suggestion.  
Did you not read the end of the book?  So he left her with a 
suggestion.  Then he corresponded with me again over this other 
thing, kind of Jedi suggestion which I’ll probably touch on 
tomorrow.   
 
I just had to ask, how long did the invisibility suggestion work?  And 
he came back, it lasted three-and-a-half weeks.  So three-and-a-half 
weeks her son could just vanish.  So, how long will it last, is open to 
question but you’re a good hypnotist so you’re not going to leave 
this to change.  You’re going to give them their name back and 
undo every other stupid suggestion that you say.  But just get used 
to saying, just for a time, it will be gone.  It takes away the fear and 
there’s much more chance of it sticking.  Sorry, did you want to say 
something, Igor? 
 
Igor: 
I was going to say, incidentally, the reverse is also true.  If they’re 
only suggestions that you want to last and have last longer because 
they’re positive, for example, like the gift, then just suggesting that 
it will last for a lifetime or it will last for exactly a year and a day or 
something like that will get them to last longer as well.

It counteracts the erosion effect with reality clashing going on.  
Does that make sense?  So basically the idea is, you can suggest 
anything.  It’s the suggestion that has the power, not the other way 
around, and do bear that in mind, guys, because you don’t want to 
have people running around looking for a cat they didn’t have for 
the rest of their life, right?  Just very quickly over here and then 
we’ll come over here. 
 
Audience Member: One of the things that I do when I’m doing the levitation up to their 
heart is, they’re picking an emotion or their unconscious mind is 
picking an emotion and then we’re locking it in, and by locking it in, 
that means they’ll be able to access it at any time that they want to.  
All they’ll need to do is return their hand right to where it was, so 
we all have trials and tribulations in life.  Any time that you want to 
be able to change your state, you’re going to be easily able to do 
that effortlessly just by returning your hand to your heart.  So it’s a 
suggestion that it will be for them – 
 
Igor: 
It will be there for the rest of your life. 
 
Anthony:  
It’s a suggestion that can permissively act on that and fire it but if I 
need a post hypnotic suggestion to last for a month, then I’ll say, 
when I see you in a month’s time and I ask you this question, this 
will be the response.  I’ll just tell them how long it’s going to last.  
So there isn’t a limit. 
 
Audience Member: Can you give a suggestion on proper semantics or wording when 
you want a suggestion to last in this regard?  I’ve had a little 
trouble.  I come to the end and all suggestions are canceled, then I 
want to say, except the one where I ba ba ba ba ba ba.  I don’t want 
to repeat – 
 
Igor: 
I say it pretty straight-forwardly, so all the silly suggestions are 
canceled.  All the stuff we’re doing here is for fun is now removed.  
You’re back to normal in every way except – and then I’ll just go 
into whatever it was.

Anthony: 
Yeah, you feel fantastic, refreshed, alert – 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, or, except the gift – every time you touch your thumb and 
your little finger together you’ll feel this amazing sense of love and 
excitement, or, except that that goal that you were visualizing 
earlier on, your unconscious mind will work night and day to take 
you close towards that and make sure you achieve that.  So the 
word, accept is everything and then you repeat whatever the 
beneficial suggestions were.  And technically, especially in Street 
Hypnosis, you’re not going to be having a whole library of 
suggestions that you want to have stick because the gifts are really 
going to be one or maybe two things at best.  You’re not doing 
therapy, you’re not wanting to do therapy, it’s not appropriate.   
 
It’s really just a gift that you’re going to take away, it’s one thing, so 
you remind of what the one thing is and they carry on with that one 
thing. 
 
Audience Member: So are you going to talk about post hypnotic such that at the end, 
when you say, everything’s canceled, you’re stuck with the problem 
of, except the post hypnotic I gave you which you don’t remember.  
How do you get around that? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, that’s easy.  In that case, just cancel suggestions first and then 
just add the post hypnotic suggestion afterwards.  It’s simple.  
Right?  You just cancel whatever happened before and then you 
just add the post hypnotic suggestion in afterwards and it’s done.  
And then of course you’re got to go back in and cancel that post 
hypnotic suggestion unless you want that to stick.  So really, it’s just 
a little sensible thing, right?  It’s just a sensible thing in terms of – 
can you have the microphone over here, please – it’s just, use your 
common sense in terms of how you present something.  If it makes 
sense to you logically in terms of your intellect, then it will make 
sense to them as well because they’re just as smart as you are.   
 
If they’re a little bit slow, then you have issues with intelligence and 
then it’s nothing to do with the way of phrasing it.  It’s a question 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
302 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
of, can you get them to understand the idea in the first place.  And 
if they can’t understand the idea, that’s where you start getting into 
problems because you meant one thing but they didn’t understand 
that thing so you have to be more clear with that.  But really 
normally, just a really sensible, straight-forward example of it is 
fine. 
 
Audience Member: So along the lines of that question and your answer, could you 
simply say something like, you won’t recall anything that was – well, 
you’ll recall anything that was therapeutic and forget everything 
else? 
 
Igor: 
Well, yeah, I use a variation of that in my therapy practice which is, 
you can just forget whatever you need to forget, remember 
whatever is useful for you to remember, useful and safe, or 
something like that, and everything else, why bother thinking about 
it; just forget about it; let it go and drift in the past like all these 
other things you’ve forgotten about because they really aren’t of 
importance to you anymore.  So as I count from one to five, yada 
yada yada, you know, everything that’s important for it to recede, it 
recedes back in the dimness of your memory.   
 
Everything you need to remember because it’s useful and safe for 
you to remember – you can just keep that treasure in whatever way 
you need to, and I leave it ambiguous like that because I’d rather 
that their mind chooses what they need to rather than me choosing 
what they need to because they know themselves better than I do. 
 
Anthony: 
And keep it relatively simple.  So much seems to be understood by 
you having the correct intention.  I know we said, make sure your 
language is clean and there’s less ambiguity in this part of the 
process, but if I say, normal, everything back to normal, then they 
just seem to get what it means.  If I say – talk about one of their 
hands being back to normal, they seem to get what I mean.  That’s 
normal but everything else is still in the same situation.  So I’m not 
suggesting that some crazy mind-to-mind transfer.  To me, it’s just 
language and tone and – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
303 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Igor: 
And implication. 
 
Anthony: 
And the implication, yeah. 
 
Igor: 
It’s just how natural language works.  Let’s just finish this thing here 
so we can finish up properly. 
 
Anthony: 
Another thing I like to do with amnesia is to give the person 
something to do or get them to visualize it.  You can see that as an 
extension of these indirect ways of saying it.  So let’s say it’s name 
amnesia or number amnesia, you could say things like, see the 
numbers one to ten, and just see that number three getting further 
and further away from you, disappearing, further and further and 
further away until it’s like a dot in the distance and then it just 
vanishes completely and the space between those other numbers 
comes together.  
 
It’s on a black board, it’s on a white board, you’re reaching up – and 
I’ll sometimes just suggest it and see what happens, I say, reach up 
with a board rubber and rub it off the blackboard and some people 
will  reach up hypnotically and just do this; other people need a bit 
of encouragement, and just say, reach up right now; pick up the 
board rubber and rub it off and they rub it off like that; other 
people will just stay there like this and rub it off mentally and do it 
as a visualization.  But I like to – again, it’s not guarantees the 
amnesia will stick but I like it when people commit to an act, even if 
it’s a head nod of acknowledgement that that’s done, that it’s gone.   
 
Another little thing you can do is you can, again, not just dictate 
their emotions but prior to that you can dictate how they will count 
because let’s say it’s a missing number three, some people will go – 
you say, count your fingers and they’ll say, one, two, four, five, six, 
seven, and they’ll just count like it’s normal.  Other people will say, 
one, two – now, they know damn well that’s not number three, 
they know it isn’t number three, but they also don’t know the 
number three.  Sorry, they know it is the number three; they 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
304 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
certainly know it isn’t number four, so they kind of refuse to 
proceed any further.   
 
So in that case, if you said, and it will be normal to you; you’ll just 
count, one, two, four, five, six, and you throw the suggestion out 
there that it’s normal, then you’re more likely, if your routine is 
relying on them actually counting beyond the number two, then 
there’s things like you can grow people’s fingers so they count, how 
many have you got on there, five, how many have you got on there, 
five; okay, just count this one, one, two, four, five, six.  You’ve got 
six fingers on there.  How many have you got on here: five.  Okay, 
you’ve got six there.  Just check them: one, two, four, five, six.   
 
How many have you got here: one, two, four, five, six, you’ve got 
twelve fingers, so you can just keep the thing going but you need 
them counting.  Then you have to give them that ability.  Other 
people will count right to the end but know that wholeheartedly 
that should not be eleven and refuse to count the last one.  Ask 
them questions, ask them to do sums, ask them to tell you the time, 
if you can include the number.  There’s lots of things you can do.  As 
we said, amnesia can cause people confusion; it can cause them 
just to clam up because they know it’s wrong that they can’t think 
of a better answer.  It can be worse than confusion.  It could be, 
what’s happening to me?   
 
It won’t be any of those things if you tell them how to respond, if 
you say that, this will be baffling, this will be really confusing, but it 
won’t upset you but it will be really confusing, or this will be 
hilarious to you, this will be ridiculous to you.  Tell them how 
they’re going to respond, not too precisely.  Just point them in a 
direction that hems them in to finding it funny in some fashion.  
Funny could mean quizzical and odd.  It could also mean they crack 
up laughing at the ridiculousness of it.  And then the final little point 
– and again, this is just like belts and braces of amnesia here, if 
you’ve really got someone hypnotized and they’re doing things on 
command, you can say it one sentence.

Even when I’ve given a suggestion for amnesia and they’ve done it 
indirectly and gotten to commit to an act and all that kind of stuff, 
when I wake him up I will nearly always distract him, and it can be 
any kind of – we sometimes, after a hypnotherapy session, use a 
tag question: They’re nice shoes; where did you get them?  Is it still 
raining outside?  Where did you park in the car park, that kind of 
thing so their brain just goes somewhere else and then they’re in 
the situation of trying to remember that dream and the doors have 
kind of shut and it’s getting more distant.  So that’s the kind of thing 
I’m going to do at this point.  I just say, you feeling good?  You’re 
not too warm in here, are you?  Anything at all.   
 
They answer that question and then I’ll just pull the crazy Erickson 
uncle stare and say, what was your name?  And look at them like 
there’s no way on earth you’re going to know this piece of 
information: what was your name?  When they start to struggle, I’m 
going to keep hitting them with suggestions, that will sound like I’m 
into my routine now.  It’s weird, isn’t it?  You try and remember it.  
Try even harder, find it goes even more distant.  All I’m doing is 
making sure this unstable thing, this situation called amnesia; I’m 
just shoring up those walls and keeping it in shape. 
 
 
Amnesia 
 
• In a Moment 
• Direct Suggestion: You Can’t Remember 
• Indirect: Metaphor/Analogy 
• Just for a Time 
• Visualization Action 
• Dictate Reaction 
• Distract 
 
 
Igor: 
Think of it like, when you do an induction, you’ve got do a deeper 
afterwards to stabilize the induction.  You go, sleep, deeper, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
306 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
deeper, more relaxed, more comfortable, the deeper you go, the 
better you feel, and so on.  You’re doing exactly the same thing for 
an amnesia response.  In other words, forget about it, a little bit of 
distraction, and, what was it again?  Going further.  Isn’t that weird 
how it disappears?  It’s like you can almost touch it, isn’t it?  Yeah, 
but now it’s – even gone from there, right?  So it’s the equivalent of 
deepening, just to stabilize that phenomenon.  Does that kind of 
make sense to you guys? 
 
Anthony: 
If you think about the kind of way we were trying to milk a physical 
analogue phenomena earlier on, you said something really good 
with it; you got into other phenomena; you spoke about their 
fingers being stuck and their feet being stuck; you spoke about a 
word, being stuck, your name being stuck in your throat or in your 
mind; you cannot get it out.  It’s no different with amnesia.  If you 
can forget a fact, then you can forget everything you know about a 
subject.  You can forget how to walk.  You can forget how to take a 
step.  You can forget how to see things in anything other than black 
and white.   
 
There are ways of stretching out the phenomena.  It’s not 
necessarily how I do hallucinations but if I know someone who 
enjoys being hypnotized can do amnesia well that struggles with 
hallucinations, then this is another way in and sometimes then that 
will become the experience. 
 
 
The Street Hypnosis System 
 
Igor: 
So here’s how we put the whole thing together, because you 
basically have now learned the entire Street Hypnosis system, if you 
like, to walk up to anyone and achieve anything, and the keys to 
that is really: Step One: you need to open the group or the 
individual in question, because otherwise you can’t even start.  
Does that make sense?  And you can do that directly or indirectly.  If 
you are a little shy and use the indirect approach, work with a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
307 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
colleague or fellow hypnotist or someone like that to generate the 
interest.  Otherwise just walk up to someone and say, hey, you look 
like you’re having fun here.  I’m a hypnotist and I’m looking for fun 
people, whatever you want to do that, right?   
 
Stage Two is your simple introduction, from the opening, 
introducing yourself, the compliment, the whole thing.  You’re 
building into the actual doing of something.  Then we’ll come into 
the actual beginning of the routine.  You’ll do your tests.  The things 
that we’ve been covering so far are the two classic tests, the finger 
vise and the magnetic hands, although really there’s no reason why 
you can’t use other tests.  You could use dictionary balloon, heavy 
hand, light hand, stiff arm.  There’s a million different tests out 
there.  Really, there is no particular reason for using one or the 
other.   
 
If you prefer one of them, feel free to use it as long as it’s 
appropriate for the venue, like the whole body sway until they’re 
lying on the ground, not the best thing in a dirty floored bar, 
something like that.  Then we have the formal trance thing, so I‘ll 
call this the induction, but of course, in terms of the induction, 
we’re talking about a whole lot more, right?  We’re talking about 
the induction, the deepener that stabilizes that process, we can 
throw in your boiler plates, your safety statements, your sound 
statements, your super suggestions along the lines of, everything I 
say will become a reality to you, or, your unconscious mind will 
protect you, and all the rest of it.   
 
Do you see where we’re going with this?  This should be relatively 
old hat for you right now.  Is that fair to say?  Everyone happy with 
this stuff so far? 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  Now we’re doing really what you came here to do, which is, 
you’ll do your demos.  Now, remember, the demos, as far as the 
audience is concerned – well, you’ve already done a whole bunch of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
308 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
things here already but as far as the audience is concerned, they 
don’t know how much you have planned so it doesn’t matter at 
what point you decide to stop things and move on, right?  So the 
classic things we’ve already talked about, is the arm levitation or 
catalepsy, right?  The laughter, which is the emotional response, 
the hand stuck which gives you that little bit more of an edgy test 
because it’s binary, it either sticks, or it doesn’t stick, right?  This is 
the point up to which you’ve gotten so far, isn’t it?  Right?   
 
I know some of you have gone a little bit further but you can all do 
this more or less, right?  A little more feedback would be good. 
 
Audience Members: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  And now all you need to add at this point is your amnesia 
and you’re pretty much done.  Once you get this thing here, it 
opens the doorways to pretty much everything else, and to get the 
amnesia, just follow – I think this is a very elegant way of getting 
amnesia: you tell them what’s going to happen very directly, you 
shore it up with lots of little metaphors, analogies, similes, 
examples and so on, you put your little caveat in there so that they 
don’t get frightened about the whole thing.  Well, the whole 
visualization of action, it’s kind of – you give them a mechanism, 
shall we say, for forgetting it and the mechanism can be a 
visualization; the mechanism could be a physical thing - I’ll drop 
your hand and as your hand drops, it’s almost like that number 
drops out of your mind at the same time.   
 
You see how you’re just linking two things, right?  You’re taking a 
reaction, important especially when it comes to the comfort levels 
of your subject, and this is, in my opinion, a really important part 
right here, the distraction because it puts on hold all the 
mechanisms that might derail the process.  Now, all of you have 
had the experience where you’ve talked to someone, you’ve been 
on some topic, there’s a distraction like a phone call, you come back 
and go, what were we talking about?  And they go, I don’t know.  
Huh?  Oh, maybe it will come back to me, and it never does.  That’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual - Pt 1 - Las Vegas 
 
 
309 WUSH Transcript Manual                        ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
distraction in action.  So if in doubt, distract more, right?  So, would 
that be fair to say that’s relatively easy?   
 
And even if you didn’t get the amnesia, by the way, you’ve got 
some pretty cool things already so you just cycle back to you know, 
the hand is stuck; have you forgotten how to lift your hand?  No; 
are you sure?  Yes; well, try and lift the hand; I can’t; yes, you’ve 
forgotten, haven’t you?  Do you see how I can still frame it as 
amnesia even though it doesn’t have to be so there’s a little bit of 
face saving going on there if you should want that sort of thing.  
Everyone happy with this so far? 
 
Audience Members: Yup. 
 
Igor: 
Then we’re coming to the end of your little performance so make 
sure you cancel the suggestions, right?  If you think something is 
specifically still there, just specifically cancel it, otherwise the 
general, all those suggestions are gone, et cetera, and this is the 
point which sets me up for my favorite part, this is my pay-off in the 
event, is the hypnotic gift.  You’ve been doing it really from day one 
already so that should be a no-brainer right now, right?  Give a nice 
little hypnotic gift.  No need to figure out, what do you cancel, what 
don’t you cancel because it’s after you’ve gotten rid of everything 
else already anyways.   
 
Otherwise you just give them some pretty straight-forward 
language for it, and then you can just finish up.  Wound up for some 
applause, take a bow, smile, be happy; everything is good.  Do you 
like this as a process?  Do you see how simple it is?  You’ve pretty 
much done every single piece in here except for the amnesia 
although quite a few of you have already done this already as well, 
and now you have a really rock solid process for doing the amnesia.  
So really, as far as I’m concerned, this is the end point of the whole 
Street Hypnosis thing.  Everything else from now on becomes a 
bonus, right?  Because you now you get to graft anything onto the 
end of this that you want, that you wish to.

I think of it as the end of the whole Street Hypnosis thing.

• Intro 
• Tests 
• Induction 
• Demo’s 
• Cancel Suggestions 
• Gift 
• End 
 
 
Igor: 
This is a good point for me, I guess, to depart.  The only thing that 
would be left at the end of this point will be showmanship stuff, 
polishing, refining and creating your own method, your own show, 
your own routines, your own Street Hypnosis piece that fits the 
context that you want, whether it’s a lecture/demo for a Rotary 
Club or a lecture/demo for medical professionals, or sitting at a 
dinner party and impressing your friends, or it’s actually doing some 
performance live on the streets, or it’s mixing it with some more 
mysterious magical showmanship that becomes a proper show type 
thing.  It doesn’t matter.   
 
That’s something that you get to refine on your own time and I 
know that Anthony is going to spend time with you doing that.  
Honestly, that’s what he’s really good at.  That is why I’m so happy 
that I got a chance to work with Anthony, because he really excels 
in that sort of thing.  This is the point that I wanted to get you guys 
to, the point where you can do anything you wish with hypnosis, 
and that’s really why you came here, isn’t it?  So who feels good 
about their skills so far?  Right?  Who is pretty impressed with the 
skill level of the other people they’ve been working with so far?

I think you should give each other a round of applause and you 
should really look forward to when you go out tonight and you do 
this and suddenly you realize that as far as anyone else is 
concerned, the rest of the world, you are a true master of hypnosis 
and if they believe it, you might as well start believing it too.  Would 
you not say?  So, I’d like to spend some time, as we’re finishing off 
here, and I know we’ll hand over to Anthony to help polish your skill 
sets as a kind of a bonus set of sessions there as well.  But I just 
want to take some time to thank all of you for taking risks because 
you all have taken risks, right?   
 
You’ve gone out, you’ve actually done this stuff, you’ve gone on the 
streets, you’ve had amazing successes.  We filmed a lot of them as 
well which I’m sure you’ll be very excited to see those, and above 
all else, neither Anthony or I could do anything that we’ve done 
here without you, without your willingness to dive in, without your 
willingness to follow along, try these things out, and I, for one, am 
very excited about the point that you guys have reached.  I don’t 
know about you but – 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, I am, I’m excited about us going out again.  The last bit of 
practice this afternoon on kind of getting more value out of it had a 
pay-off and will have a bigger pay-off when we go out this evening. 
 
Igor: 
The last thought I want to leave inside your mind is:  If in doubt, 
simplify.  This is really everything you have to do and it’s all simple 
at this point, right?  If at any point you need to bail, you know how 
to milk things, little things like this already so that you still have a 
good, solid, dramatic performance and then when you find the 
people that you really want to work with, just go to town and enjoy 
yourself.  Smile, look in the mirror and go, hey, I have a cloak, I have 
a top hat, somewhere in this drawer is a monocle.  I guess that 
makes you the hypnotist, doesn’t it?  So I just want to thank 
everyone formally here.  Thank you, first of all, Anthony, for 
working with me on this.

Anthony: 
And let me just say, a big thanks to Igor.  He invited me as a guest 
here.  I’ve appreciated coming here, meeting you guys and I’m sure 
you’d agree, puts everything into it so let’s give him a big round of 
applause. 
 
Igor: 
And let’s not forget all our hard-working instructors in the back of 
the room who have been taking you guys out and helping you to do 
this stuff live in the streets because without them to help manage 
the numbers, this would not be possible at all.  So let’s thank these 
guys here.  And then last, but not least, we have our support from 
everyone, from the guys filming everything so that your successes 
will be kept for all eternity and the people in the back of the room 
here as well.  And the last thing left for me to do really before I sort 
of click my fingers and vanish like our special friend, is just to say, 
I’m really impressed with all of you guys.   
 
In two days you have gone really far in terms of your skill, in terms 
of what you can achieve, in terms of what you can do and I look 
forward to bumping into you guys again sometime in the future 
where you can tell me all the wild tales of stuff that you’ve done.  
The only hope that I have is that you keep this stuff up, whether it’s 
actually on the streets doing performances or it’s in your private 
practice or it’s just little things you do with friends from time to 
time, keep it up because you’ve invested a lot of time and effort 
into your skill set.  It’s worth carrying on with it and it will pay off 
exponentially the longer you go and it’s really rewarding as well.  So 
with that happy thought, thank you very much and good night.
