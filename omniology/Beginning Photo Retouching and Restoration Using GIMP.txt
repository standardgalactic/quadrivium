Introduction
The Joy of Restoring Photos
When you look through your family photo album, chances are you’ll notice that some of those pictures 
are showing their age. They might have faded, lost a great deal of color, have stains, tears, or other forms of 
damage. There may be only one picture of a favorite aunt or uncle in existence, possibly in poor condition. 
If you have photos that are precious to you, you know how important it is to rescue and preserve them for 
posterity (Figure 1).
Figure 1.  A faded image rescued for future generations
With the advent of digital imaging software, it’s now possible to perform minor miracles and revive 
damaged photographs that might have been considered beyond repair. In my profession, there’s nothing 
more gratifying than the look of surprise and joy on a client’s face when he or she sees a fresh, new copy 
of a restored family photo for the first time. Sometimes, the client is moved to tears, which reiterates how 
important family photographs are. Most of us in the photo retouching and restoration profession love what 
we do. I personally find it very therapeutic—even when wrestling with some of the more challenging jobs 
that come my way. Learning these skills is a plus for photographers who want to add an extra revenue stream 
to their business. Genealogists can greatly benefit from knowing how to digitally resurrect images from 
generations past. The family archivist will have fun preserving the history of Mom and Dad, as well as an 
assortment of cousins, aunts, and uncles.
Why Photographs Are Important
Our old family photographs go largely unnoticed in our day-to-day lives. They are tucked away in aging 
photo albums (Figure 2), displayed in frames (often exposed to damaging light), or stored in drawers and 
boxes. Improper storage and exposure to UV light cause the majority of damage to photographs.

■ Introduction
xx
Our photographs are linked to our history. The fact is, we often don’t give them much thought until a 
milestone anniversary or birthday, a loved one passes on, or other such event. Throughout my career, I’ve 
had many desperate clients hire me to restore their treasured images for all of these occasions.  Preventing 
damage is always preferable to repairing it. Keeping photos in acid-free albums, displaying them in 
frames with UV resistant glass, and keeping them out of junk drawers and boxes will go a long way toward 
preserving your images. It’s also important to digitize them, so copies can be given to family members. Those 
images of our parents, grandparents, kids—even distant relatives—are part of our heritage and well worth 
preserving. It would be a shame if our visual family history couldn’t be passed on to future generations. 
Fortunately, with the aid of this book, and the image-editing power of GIMP 2.8, you’ll be able to rescue all 
of the damaged images in your family’s collection, as well as those of your clients, if you choose to make a 
profession out of this fun and challenging activity.
GIMP: The Powerful Free Image-Editing Alternative
Years ago, there weren’t many options available for full-featured photo-editing programs. Adobe Photoshop 
was by far the most powerful—and the most expensive. While it is still considered the leading photo-editing 
software, there are other options that have narrowed the gap over the years.
One of the most powerful free photo editors is the open source GIMP, currently in version 2.8. GIMP 
stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program. The best part about it (other than being free) is that you can 
share it with friends and install it on multiple computers—all without fear of committing piracy or violating 
licensing agreements. It is issued under the terms of the GPL, which stands for General Public License. 
Photoshop is probably the most pirated software on Earth. With GIMP, that isn’t possible. The developers 
encourage you to distribute copies (and, yes, it says so on their web site).
Open source software such as GIMP means that the source code is openly available. Anyone with 
programming skills can make improvements and enhancements. There is a large community of GIMP 
users that develops fixes: plug-ins (software add-ons that improve functionality). Over the years, GIMP has 
matured into a powerful tool used by many independent photographers, graphic designers, and artists who 
require a full-featured image editor.

■ Introduction
xxi
In May 2013, Adobe Systems, Inc., changed to a subscription-only business model. It no longer 
sells physical boxed software packages or downloads with perpetual licenses. Adobe customers must 
pay a monthly fee to use the company’s current products on a continual basis. This apparently angered 
many of Adobe’s customers, many of whom began seeking alternatives to Adobe products, especially 
Photoshop. There was a dramatic increase in the download frequency of GIMP in the months that 
followed Adobe’s decision. It would be reasonable to assume that GIMP will become more popular over 
time, as it keeps improving.
Although GIMP lacks some of Photoshop’s features, such as the CMYK color model, adjustment layers, 
or 16-bit-per-channel mode (that is due to arrive in version 2.10), it is still an extremely capable editor for 
photo retouching and restoration tasks. There are plug-ins available that can restore some of the missing 
features, so GIMP will become more on par with Photoshop.
To download the software and access the documentation and license, visit the official web site at  
www.gimp.org. GIMP can be installed on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, and Unix derivatives. The web site will 
help direct you to the correct installer (or source code) for your system. Even though this book is a beginner’s 
guide to photo retouching and restoration, it’s not a beginner’s guide to GIMP. For the benefit of those new 
to GIMP, Chapter 1 is an overview of this software’s important features. It should provide beginners with 
enough information to follow the tutorials, but the GIMP User Manual will provide much more specific 
information about the software itself. I recommend GIMP for Absolute Beginners by Jan Smith, with Roman 
Joost (Apress, 2012), as an excellent companion book.
The retouching and restoration techniques in this book can be replicated by other programs, such as 
Adobe Photoshop, Corel Paint Shop Pro, among others. However, some of the tool names and command 
names will differ.
If you’ve been eager to learn photo retouching and restoration without the high price tag that 
accompanies Photoshop, I encourage you to get started with GIMP 2.8. You can download the practice 
photos with which to follow along in each lesson from the companion web site: www.gimprestoration.com.
This book will teach you how to do the following:
Acquire the best scans and digitize oversized photos
• 
Improve contrast to make faded photos look their best
• 
Correct exposure problems
• 
Make color corrections in photos that have color shifts or color casts
• 
Colorize black-and-white photos
• 
Digitally clean up dust on photos (great for scanned images acquired from old 35mm 
• 
slides or negatives)
Repair images with tears, cracks, and stains
• 
Remove unwanted objects from photos
• 
Recompose portraits (add or remove people, change backgrounds, or  
• 
make other changes)
Digitally remove skin blemishes, whiten teeth, etc.
• 
Protect and preserve your restored images

Visualizing the Editing Steps
It will be beneficial to evaluate each photo and visualize your steps from start to finish. This may be a little 
challenging in the beginning, but it gets easier with practice. Outlined below is the progression of an image 
restoration that should serve as a general guide.
1.	
Straighten the image. Sometimes, the image you are working with will be tilted 
slightly. GIMP can easily correct this. You can see in the example (Figure 3,  
right-hand example) that the porch has been straightened. Now the edges are at 
an angle and will have to be cropped.
Figure 3.  The image straightened
2.	
Crop the photo. In the next example (Figure 4), I cropped the image to the 
client’s specifications. Photos from the 1950s were often square, and cropping 
eliminates the excess foreground.
Figure 4.  Image cropped (left) and contrast improved (right)
3.	
Make the necessary exposure and contrast adjustments. By using a 
combination of layers set with the Multiply and Overlay blending modes, the 
photo has much better contrast and brightness (Figure 4, right-hand example). 
When editing color images, make the needed color adjustments after exposure 
corrections.
4.	
Do your digital cleanup/editing. Remove scratches, spots, blemishes, and any 
distracting elements. After editing, recheck the exposure and contrast. In color 
photos, recheck the color correction.

■ Introduction

Note
■
■
  This process will vary somewhat, depending on the image and the editing requirements. For example, 
it’s better to repair images with heavy damage (large cracks, tears, or missing areas, in which large patches of 
underlying white from missing image emulsion are visible) before making tonal and/or color corrections.
Improving with Practice
The tutorials in this book will help you learn a great deal about photo retouching and restoration. Mastering 
the lessons in this book will help you along the way to becoming an expert retouch or restoration artist, 
and with dedicated practice, you will become one. This is especially important if you plan to become a 
professional retoucher and restorer. Top-notch work that exceeds your clients’ expectations will make them 
very happy, which can promote glowing word-of-mouth testimony leading to potential clients.
You’ll discover that some restoration work requires experimentation with different approaches, before you 
achieve the results you want. You won’t achieve perfect results with every image; some will be too far damaged, 
and making the best attempt you can make will have to suffice. You can still end up with pleasing results!
As mentioned earlier, if you are going to professionally restore and retouch photographs, skillful work 
will thrill your customers. That’s why improving and maintaining your skill level is vital. There will be the 
occasional hard-to-please client, and there will be times when revising work will be necessary. While it’s 
important to keep revisions to a minimum, they can also serve as learning experiences. Many times, I’ve 
learned a new and better way of restoring a photo because my first attempt wasn’t satisfactory. After the 
revision, I’d end up with a very happy client—often leading to repeat business.
After you’ve spent a great deal of time editing a particularly difficult photo, it helps to leave it alone for a 
day or so and then reexamine it with a fresh set of eyes. (It also helps to have someone else look at it.) It can 
be frustrating to print your finished work, only to discover it wasn’t quite finished, because you overlooked 
something. After mastering the tutorials in this book, you might consider asking family and friends for 
practice photos. It’s a great way to build a portfolio to show prospective clients. Just be sure to ask for 
permission to use them first—especially if you plan to put them online.
5.	
Recheck the photo for overlooked dust, blemishes, etc. Give the photo a final 
overview, to make sure you removed all of the imperfections that might have 
been overlooked the first time. Once you’re satisfied with the outcome, it is 
finished. Be sure to save a layered version of your work. (I’ll explain this in greater 
detail in “Working with Layers,” in Chapter 1).
6.	
Resize the image. Resize the photo to its final output size.
7.	
Sharpen the photo. Last, sharpen the image slightly. The end result looks much 
better (Figure 5).

Equipment Purchases to Consider
These days, most people own a computer, scanner, and printer. All-in-one printer/copier/scanners have 
become popular in recent years. These are the minimum requirements for scanning, editing, and printing 
photographs up to 8" × 10". For many people, this will probably be sufficient. For those editing images at 
the serious amateur level or offering a professional service, there are a few purchases you might want to 
consider. They will make your workflow smoother and more efficient and will also enable you to handle a 
wider range of editing tasks. If you’re a professional, you probably already have this equipment. If not, the 
following are some items you might require at some point:
• 
A multi-format flatbed scanner (Figure 6). Using a multi-format photo-quality 
scanner will capture images with a wide dynamic range (greater detail in shadow 
areas), as well as transparencies, such as 35mm slides and negatives. They typically 
range in price from about $99.00, for basic models, to $700.00, for models that can 
scan 12–16 slides at one time.
Figure 6.  A multi-format flatbed scanner
• 
A good quality tripod. You may encounter large images, such as 16" × 20" portraits. 
With a tripod and a good camera, you can digitize large images for editing. A decent 
consumer-quality camera will work, but a camera that captures in the RAW format 
is best. The tripod should have a head that tilts 90 degrees, so that the camera can be 
aimed straight down.
• 
Lighting. Digitizing large images outside on an overcast day works very well but 
may not always be possible. You can purchase from your local camera shop lighting 
equipment to illuminate large images. Photo-flood bulbs emit light at 3200 or 3400 
degrees Kelvin to work with your camera’s indoor setting.
• 
Graphics tablet (Figure 7). A graphics tablet can make your work much easier and 
faster.   It mimics the feel of using a brush, pencil, or pen. This is especially useful 
when applying colors to an image, such as colorizing a black and white photograph.

Copy with Caution
If you are learning the art of digital photo restoration for professional purposes, you’ll have to be careful 
when duplicating and editing some images, to avoid committing copyright infringement. Because I’m not an 
attorney, I can’t really offer this as specific legal advice, but more as a general cautionary guide for you to keep 
in mind. You should always consult an attorney who specializes in intellectual property law for legal specifics.
On occasion, a customer will request retouching or modifying a professionally shot portrait. Legally, the 
photographer who took the picture owns the copyright to the image (unless other arrangements were agreed 
upon beforehand). When possible, have the customer obtain written permission from the photographer or 
studio that owns the copyright, before proceeding with any work. Naturally, some portraits will be decades 
old, and the photographer will have passed on or closed his/her business, or there simply may not be any 
way of knowing who the photographer is. In those cases, it’s probably a moot issue.
It’s good practice to have the customer sign a waiver (your attorney can help you draft one) releasing 
you from any copyright infringement liability. However, if the picture is obviously the work of a professional 
(especially a local photographer), obtaining permission to edit the image is very important. Photographers 
can be very protective of their work (trust me, I know), and you can’t really blame them. If it happened to get 
back to him or her that you were editing his/her work, a lawsuit might follow. (I personally know of a photo 
lab owner who was almost sued over just such an incident.)
Many people believe that because they paid for the photography service and prints, they own the 
copyright to those images. It can sometimes be difficult to convey the concept that the photographer  
(or studio that employs him/her) owns the copyright. However, it’s important that you do. Customers 
won’t always understand why they need to obtain permission or sign a waiver, but you must legally protect 
yourself. It’s also just professional courtesy to ask for permission to edit someone else’s work.
So, be sure to remember these important points.
When possible, have the customer sign a waiver releasing you from any potential 
• 
copyright infringement. Most of the images you work with will be family snapshots 
or an old portrait that was the work of a professional. It may be impossible to identify 
the photographer.
When it’s obvious that a photo is the work of a professional, obtain permission 
• 
from the copyright owner to edit the image, if at all possible. There is usually an 
embossed signature at the bottom-right corner of a photo and a “Do Not Copy” 
warning on the back.
• 
Consult an attorney when you need more specific legal advice. It pays to be careful.
Macintosh Users
The tutorials in this book use the Windows/Linux keyboard shortcuts, but if you are a Macintosh user 
unfamiliar with the aforementioned keyboard shortcuts, the Mac equivalents are shown in Table 1.

Plug-ins
Plug-ins are software components that add functionality to GIMP. There are a few tutorials in this book that 
will require that certain plug-ins be installed. These plug-ins, like GIMP, are free of charge.  The easiest way 
to acquire most of the plug-ins you’ll use in the upcoming tutorials is to install the GIMP Extensions Pack 
(for Windows) and the Repository of optional extensions for GIMP (for popular Linux distributions such as 
Ubuntu). These extension packs include Resynthesizer, G’MIC, and  Wavelet Decompose.
The extensions pack for Windows allows you to choose which plug-ins you want to 
• 
install (Figure 8).
Figure 8.  The set-up for installing the GIMP Extensions Pack on Windows
Log on to 
• 
http://registry.gimp.org/node/27656 to see the complete list of 
available plug-ins in the extensions pack and to get the latest version.
The GIMP extensions for Linux distributions such such as Ubuntu are available from 
• 
the Software Center (Figure 9). Just type repository of optional plug-ins in the search 
field to pull it up, and click on it to open the Install option.

■ Introduction
xxvii
Here are the plug-ins that will be used throughout this book:
• 
Resynthesizer. This is actually a suite of scripts, but the one that you’ll be using is 
called Heal Selection. This function is very useful for removing unwanted objects 
from images and is also useful for repairing large, damaged areas.
• 
G’MIC. The G’MIC (which stands for Greyc’s Magic for Image Computing) plug-in 
adds a wealth of filters and effects. One could easily spend hours exploring all it has 
to offer. There are many artistic filters that can turn your photographic images into 
digital works of art.
• 
Wavelets Decompose. This plug-in is very useful for portrait retouching. It allows 
retouching without the result looking artificial. It essentially separates  the image into 
layers called wavelets containing varying degrees of detail for precise editing.
• 
GimpLensfun. This plug-in can be used to correct lens distortions. When  
digitizing large images with a tripod and camera (as you’ll see in Chapter 2),  
there is usually some distortion that results. GimpLensFun is available from  
http://seebk.github.io/GIMP-Lensfun (Figure 11).
For Mac OS, Partha’s Place (Figure 10) provides GIMP builds that already include these plug-ins, in 
which case Mac users can download GIMP from Partha’s Place instead of the GIMP website as described in 
Chapter One. Log on to www.partha.com to access the web site.

  If you are an absolute beginner, I hope that this chapter will provide you with enough information 
about GIMP to follow along with the exercises in this book. The GIMP User Manual will provide much more 
detailed information and can be accessed from the official GIMP web site at www.gimp.org.
Downloading and Installing GIMP 2.8
If you don’t already have GIMP installed on your computer, then the first thing to do is go to the official 
GIMP web site at www.gimp.org. Next, just follow the steps below that apply to the operating system of your 
computer. Remember: GIMP is free—no need to have a credit card ready!
Once you are on the GIMP web site, you’ll see the Download button at the top of the home page 
(Figure 1-1). The GIMP web site will automatically detect your computer’s operating system. Click the 
Download button, and you’ll be taken to the appropriate download link(s).

GIMP for Windows
The following steps will help assist you in installing GIMP 2.8 on Windows. These steps were performed on 
Windows 7 (the same steps will apply for Windows 8).
	
1.	
Once you are on the download page for Windows, click the Download  
GIMP 2.8.10 link (Figure 1-2).
Figure 1-1.  The Download button on the GIMP home page

After the download completes, the GIMP installer will be in the Downloads 
folder or the place you normally designate for downloads. Click the GIMP 
installer, and the Open File - Security Warning dialog box will open. Click the 
Run button, and GIMP will be installed on your system. The installation process 
might take several minutes (Figure 1-3).

Figure 1-3.  Installing GIMP on Windows 7
GIMP for Linux and Unix-Like Systems
If your computer’s operating system is a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian, then GIMP is 
probably already installed. If for some reason it isn’t, the GIMP for Unix-Like Systems section of the GIMP 
download page will guide you to the appropriate installation instructions for your particular operating 
system (Figure 1-4). If you use Ubuntu, you can download GIMP from the Software Center (Figure 1-5).

GIMP for Mac OS X
This page (Figure 1-6) is where you’ll find the download links for your Macintosh. You can now download 
the GIMP 2.8 installer and then open the downloaded DMG file and drag the GIMP.app to the Applications 
folder (older versions of GIMP required X11 to be installed).
Figure 1-6.  GIMP for Mac OS X 
The GIMP Interface
This is where it all happens—the digital darkroom where you’ll learn how to retouch and restore your 
treasured images (or those of your clients). The interface will differ slightly in appearance from one platform 
to another, but the operations are pretty much the same across the board. I do most of my work on a Linux 
desktop computer, so the majority of the screen shots throughout this book are taken from the Linux version 
of GIMP. However, I do also use Windows 7 sometimes, so there will be a few screen shots I generated that 
show that version as well. Figure 1-7 is the interface on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04).

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of GIMP 2.8

Figure 1-7.  The GIMP interface on Linux
One of the best features of GIMP 2.8 is that it now has a Single Window Mode. When you launch  
GIMP 2.8 for the first time, it will likely be in the Multi-Window Mode by default. To change the interface 
from multiple floating panels to the single window, go to the Image menu (above the image window) and 
select Window ➤ Single-Window Mode (Figure 1-8).

The Image Menu
The Image Menu Bar is set atop the GIMP image window (Figure 1-9). It can be thought of as “Command 
Headquarters”; you can access almost every function from here. Following is a quick run-through of some 
(but not all) of the functions within each option:
File: Opens existing files, creates new files, saves, and exports
Edit: Undoes and redoes, copies, pastes, accesses preferences
Select: Provides various options for choosing and modifying selections
View: Provides viewing options for images, layers, navigation, guides
Image: Provides options for adjusting image orientation, size, printing images, 
and canvas settings
Layer: Creates new layers, duplicates existing layers, works with layer properties
Colors: Accesses the color adjustment dialogs, such as Color Balance, Levels, 
Curves, and Hue/Saturation
Tools: Accesses the image editing and color tools
Filters: Accesses the filters, such as Blur or Sharpen, as well as artistic and 
specialty filters
Windows: Accesses the recently closed docks, hiding docks, etc.
Help: Accesses the GIMP User Manual (if installed on your computer) and also 
links to the online GIMP User Manual

Many of the functions used routinely have keyboard shortcuts. It’s a good idea to familiarize yourself 
with them and make a habit of using them on a regular basis.
The Image Navigation Bar
This is a useful new feature for GIMP 2.8. The Image Navigation Bar allows you to easily browse through all of 
the images that are open in GIMP, by viewing the thumbnails just above the image workspace (Figure 1-10).
Figure 1-10.  Image Navigation Bar
Simply click the thumbnail of the image you want to display in the workspace. The thumbnail of the 
active image will be in the forefront. The Image Navigation Bar only displays if two or more images are open.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of GIMP 2.8
13
The Toolbox and Important Tool Functions
The Toolbox groups many of the functions you’ll use on a routine basis. To identify each tool, hold the cursor 
over the icon and the tool name. A brief description of its function and the keyboard shortcut pop up in a 
small call-out (the Perspective Clone tool doesn’t use a keyboard shortcut). Below the Toolbox is the Tool 
Options dialog. In Figure 1-11, the Healing tool is active, so such options as brush size, hardness, dynamics, 
etc., can be changed to suit the specific task at hand. 
Figure 1-11.  The call-out describing the Healing tool and the Tool Options dialog
The Selection Tools
GIMP offers a variety of selection tools that will enable you to isolate certain areas of the image you’re 
editing. This confines the changes you want to make to the pixels within the selection boundary, leaving the 
rest of the image unaltered. The Free Select tool is one of the most commonly used selection tools, allowing 
you to draw an outline around the area you want to isolate. The Fuzzy Select tool is useful for isolating 
regions by color range (Figure 1-12).

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of GIMP 2.8
14
Selections can be further refined with the Quick Mask function, which will be explored further later on. 
You’ll be able to edit selections with great precision, which is useful for isolating people to put on different 
backgrounds or to recompose images. Refer to Table 1-1 below to become familiar with the name, shortcut, 
and function of each tool.

among other things. Out of all of the brushes (for the purposes of retouching and restoration), the  
“dynamic duo” of the set would be the Clone tool and the Healing tool. These are the two you’ll most often 
use to correct imperfections and repair damage on the images you edit (Figure 1-13).

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of GIMP 2.8

The Clone tool works by sampling the pixels from one part of an image and pasting them on a target 
area on another part. The Healing tool is a type of “smart clone” that takes the surrounding texture and 
tone of the sampled area into account and seamlessly blends the pixels in for a flawless repair. Generally, 
the Clone tool is better suited to repairing larger cracks and creases, and the Healing tool, although it can 
be good at repairing smaller cracks and creases, is usually best at removing facial blemishes in portrait 
retouching.
There are plenty of other tools you’ll be using in your retouching and restoration exercises. The 
following table (Table 1-2) briefly describes each tool, the keyboard shortcut, and a description of the tool’s 
function.

Working with Layers
Layers can be likened to sheets of clear acetate, each one with a graphical element stacked on top of another. 
The sample illustration shown in Figure 1-15 demonstrates how the elements on each layer combine to 
make a complete composite.
Figure 1-15.  Separate layers form a complete picture

Layers are one of the most important aspects of photo editing. Sometimes it will be necessary to make 
revisions to your work, and having a layered version will make this much easier. If I wanted to redo the sun’s 
rays, I could hide the original layer (titled “Rays”), by clicking the eye-shaped icon, and redraw them on a 
new layer (Figure 1-15).
You should never edit directly on the background layer! Make a copy of the original image layer to edit. In 
the following example (Figure 1-16), I duplicated the original layer and named it Edit Layer (you can name 
it however it best suits you), then desaturated it, to remove the color. The original background layer is still 
intact. By adding a layer mask, I was able to paint some of the color back in for a selective colorized effect. 
Layer masks allow you to add or remove data on a layer in a nondestructive way.
Figure 1-16.  The work is done on a copy of the background layer
You might end up having 10, 15, or more layers in your restoration projects, depending on the degree 
of work involved. It’s a good practice to name the layers as you create them. If you have a project with many 
layers, it will make it much easier to find a particular layer, should you need to edit it.

Chapter 1 ■ An Overview of GIMP 2.8
19
Layer Groups
Layer groups are new to GIMP 2.8 and are very helpful for organizing large numbers of layers. Layers within 
a layer group can be toggled on when you have to locate a particular one and then toggled off to hide the 
layers within that group. This will help make your work go smoother when you work with complex images 
composed of a large number of layers (Figure 1-17). I named the layer group Tonal Adjustment Layer Group. 
Some images might have more than one layer group, depending on the complexity of the work being done.

It’s often possible to correct images with serious tonal problems with a combination of blending modes. 
It will require some experimentation but can often workvery well.
Plug-ins to Enhance GIMP 
There are a number of plug-ins for GIMP that expand its capabilities. Some plug-ins are useful, some not so 
much, at least for photo restoration work. You can peruse the available plug-ins at the GIMP Plugin Registry 
at http://registry.gimp.org/—there are plenty to see.
Figure 1-18.  An overlay layer blend mode brightens up this image 
Layer Blending Modes
Layers have a variety of blending modes, which interact with the underlying layer in specific ways. Blending 
modes can be very useful when restoring photos. For example, an underexposed photo, such as the one in 
Figure 1-18, can be quickly enhanced by simply duplicating the background layer and changing the blending 
mode to Screen. The result is a brighter picture.

Summary
We looked at how to download and install GIMP 2.8 on your computer and had a cursory overview of 
the software. As mentioned earlier, the overview will help you to get acquainted with GIMP, but you also 
have access to the GIMP User Manual, which covers everything about this program in depth. The plug-ins 
available for GIMP can expand its capabilities, especially Resynthesizer. It can save you a lot of time.
For the absolute beginner using GIMP, the best way to learn this program is by jumping in and spending 
time playing with it. Open an image (make a copy of it first) and use the tools, to see what they do and 
how they behave. Experiment with the functions in the Image menu, to see how they work. When you feel 
somewhat comfortable with the features of GIMP, then you can move on to Chapter 2.

Acquiring Your Digital Images
As you’re mastering the exercises in this book, you might be eager to try your newly acquired skills on your 
own images. Getting your images into a digital format is the first step toward the image editing process. You 
can either hire the task out or do it yourself—which, I presume, will be the choice of the majority of those 
reading this book.
If you are going to work only with relatively small photographic prints (8" × 10" or less), a basic model 
scanner will be adequate. If you plan to digitize transparencies such as slides and negatives, you’ll need a 
multi-format flatbed scanner. These models will digitize transparencies as well as photos. Some models will 
handle medium- and large-format negatives, such as 4" × 5". There are also dedicated scanners for digitizing 
mounted slides (in a 2" × 2" mount) and 35mm negatives.
A tripod and good digital camera are useful tools for digitizing large images, as you’ll see shortly. You’ll 
be able to comfortably digitize portraits up to 16" × 20".
Starting with a Clean Scan
Because it’s likely that the image you are scanning requires some type of digital repair, it’s logical to assume 
that you don’t want to add even more dreck to remove. I make it a habit to keep a can of compressed air  
(or a bulb brush), a can of foam-type glass cleaner, and a clean cloth near my scanner (Figure 2-1). There’s 
no need to digitally edit out a small hair or stray ball of dust from your image, when you can avoid scanning it 

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
24
in the first place. It’s also a good idea to use a soft bristle brush or bulb brush on the material to be scanned, 
to remove any loose dust. This is especially true with transparencies—even the smallest dust particles will 
stand out. Use caution when brushing off original materials. If the emulsion is flaking or loose, you could 
make the damage even worse.
Figure 2-1.  Keeping cleaning articles near your scanner is a good idea
Note
■
■
  When cleaning your scanner, spray the cleaning fluid on the cloth and not on the glass platen. This 
will prevent the cleaning fluid from running into the seams of your scanner, which could possibly damage it.
Scanning Photographs
It’s important to scan the original image at the correct resolution, to have sufficient data to work with, 
especially when the edited image will be printed as an enlargement. If the input data is too low, the result 
will be an image with a jagged appearance. The following illustration (Figure 2-2) shows two enlarged 
sections scanned from a 3" × 5" photograph of the lettering on a boat. The image on the left is a scan at 300 
DPI (for print), and that on the right is a scan at 75 DPI (the resolution generally used for viewing images on 
the Web). Ninety-six DPI is also used for web-based images.

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
25
Generally, scanning a photograph at 300 DPI is sufficient, if the final print output size doesn’t exceed 
the original image size—at least, by very much. When you upscale an image, the software must interpolate, 
or estimate, when it adds pixels to re-create the image data. Without sufficient captured image data, an 
enlarged photo will look horrible when printed.
My clients often request enlargements made from small prints. These can be achieved (within reason) 
by scanning the original at a higher resolution. I find that scanning a small print (such as one that is wallet 
size) at 600–800 DPI will usually suffice, depending on the image quality you are starting with and how 
much you want to enlarge the image (8" × 10" is about the maximum I will attempt to coax from a wallet-size 
original).
After performing the necessary edits, the file can be scaled up to the desired output size. For printing, 
the image can be down-sampled to 300 DPI.
Many scanners are capable of capturing 48-bit (16 bits per channel) color. Because GIMP 2.8 currently 
handles 24 bits (8 bits per channel), a 48-bit image will be converted to 24 bits when imported into the 
program (a prompt window opens first). Forty-eight-bit color support will be available in GIMP 2.10. If you 
have plenty of data storage space, it’s a good idea to scan your images in the 48-bit mode and save the files in 
a loss-less format, such as TIFF. These will serve as your digital negatives, preserving the maximum degree of 
image integrity.
Digitizing Large Images
Most of the images you scan will be small enough to fit comfortably on a scanning bed that accommodates a 
sheet 8.5" × 11". But what if you are confronted with an old 16" × 20" portrait? If you have large photographs 
to contend with, there are options available to enable you to digitize them, in order to transfer them to your 
computer, so that you can edit them.

Find a Service Provider
When you have to digitize a large photograph, check with the local photo labs or with photographers who 
offer copy services. They can photograph your image and either provide you with a copy negative or a 
digital file (which is preferable). Printing companies often use oversized scanners for large documents, 
photographs, or artwork—usually up to 11" × 17".
Use Your Camera and Tripod
With a sturdy tripod and a decent digital camera, you can fashion your own copy stand to digitize large 
pictures (you can also purchase a purpose-built copy stand from a photographic supplier). The tripod 
should have a head that can tilt at 90 degrees and be tall enough to allow adequate room to place the image 
between the feet. I set up the following example (Figure 2-3) outside, on an overcast day, with my camera’s 
white balance set to Daylight, and the ISO set to 100. Although I prefer shooting outside like this, it’s not 
always practical—the weather doesn’t always cooperate.
Figure 2-3.  A tripod set up as a copy stand and a 16” × 20” portrait digitized with a camera
For working indoors, good results can be achieved by using three or four 250-watt photo flood lamps 
and the Tungsten setting on your camera. Photo flood bulbs have a color temperature of 3200 degrees Kelvin 
to help capture your image with the correct color balance. B&H Photo is a great online supplier from which 
to purchase studio lighting equipment. Visit their site at www.bhphotovideo.com. You can also shop on eBay 
for good used equipment.
Following are the steps to capture a large image with a digital camera and tripod setup:
	
1.	
Position the tripod over the image.
	
2.	
Tilt the tripod’s head at a 90-degree angle (the camera should point straight 
down at the image) and move the tripod, as required, to frame the image within 
the camera’s viewfinder and minimize distortion of the image.

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
27
	
3.	
If you’re working inside, make sure the image is evenly illuminated.
	
4.	
Adjust the camera’s white balance, if your camera has manual settings; 
otherwise, use the auto white balance.
	
5.	
Make sure the image is in focus, and capture it with your camera. Experiment 
with the ISO and exposure settings and capture several variations of the image, 
so that you can then choose the best one.
	
6.	
Capture the image with the highest quality setting possible. The more image data 
you capture the better.
	
7.	
The image might have some slight keystone distortion. After you import the 
file to your computer, use GIMP’s Perspective transform tool to correct the 
distortion (Figure 2-4). A plug-in worth trying to help correct lens distortions is 
GimpLensfun, available from http://seebk.github.io/GIMP-Lensfun/.

Tip
■
■
  Images with a glossy or reflective surface might need to be propped up on one side, so they’re not 
lying perfectly flat. This will angle the surface of an image, to eliminate any glare that might show up in the 
captured copy. 
Scanning Photos in Sections
An alternative to using a camera and tripod setup is to scan larger photos in sections. This method is better 
suited for photos that can be scanned in two sections, such as a 10" × 13" or an 11" × 14" print. It also works 
well for panoramas that have been rolled up for many years and are too curled to lay flat for using the 
camera-tripod capture method.
The following sample 11" × 14" image is included (ch2_babygirl.jpg, parts 1 and 2) in the Practice 
Images available for download from the Apress companion web page (mentioned in the Introduction). If 
you don’t have a photograph that large to scan, at least you can follow along the reassembly portion of this 
tutorial, using the practice images.
Following are the steps to capture an 11" x 14" image by scanning it in two sections:
	
1.	
Lay one end of the photograph horizontally across the scanning bed.
	
2.	
Scan the image at 300 DPI into GIMP (Image Menu ➤ File Create ➤ Scanner/
Camera). Select your scanner when prompted. Expand the canvas  
(Image Menu ➤ Image ➤ Canvas Size) to about 4500 pixels (15") wide. This will  
give you some extra wiggle room to negotiate the second part of the image into place 
(Figure 2-5).
Figure 2-5.  The background expanded on the first part of the scanned image

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
29
	
3.	
Rename the background layer Scan 1 (Activate the Background Layer ➤ Right 
Click ➤ Edit Layer Attributes).
	
4.	
Lay the other end of the photograph horizontally across the scanning bed, 
keeping the orientation the same as the first scan. Scan it into GIMP (Figure 2-6).
Figure 2-6.  The second part of the image scanned into GIMP
	
5.	
Copy the image to the clipboard (Image Menu ➤ Edit ➤ Copy).
	
6.	
Activate the first scanned image by clicking the tab on the Image Navigation Bar.
	
7.	
Paste the second part of the image (Image Menu ➤ Edit ➤ Paste As New Layer).
	
8.	
Change the layer’s boundary size to match the image size (Layer ➤ Right Click ➤ 
Layer to Image Size).
	
9.	
Rename the layer Scan 2.
	
10.	
Lower the layer’s opacity enough to see the first scan underneath. This will help 
make alignment easier (Figure 2-7). Using the Move tool, position the layer 
into place and use the Arrow keys to nudge it in small increments, for precise 
alignment.

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
30
Figure 2-7.  Position the second part of the image into place
	
11.	
After the second part is in position, increase the layer’s opacity back up to 100%.
	
12.	
There is usually a visible line and some tonal difference running along the image, 
similar to the example being used in this guide. To remove this, add a Layer Mask 
to the layer named Scan 2 (Right Click ➤ Add Layer Mask). Use the default White 
(Full Opacity) setting.
	
13.	
Activate the Paintbrush tool. Using a large, soft brush and black as the active 
color, paint away the line (Figure 2-8). Depending on the results you achieve with 
your image, it might be necessary to vary the brush opacity.

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
31
Figure 2-8.  Removing the line and tonal differences with a large, soft brush
	
14.	
After the two sections match to your satisfaction, use the Crop tool to trim away 
the excess area. Rotate the image to its proper vertical position (Image Menu ➤ 
Image ➤ Transform ➤ Rotate 90 Degrees Clockwise).
	
15.	
Save a layered copy as an XCF file, which is GIMP’s native file format. It’s always a 
good practice to save layered copies, in case you have to make revisions.
	
16.	
Flatten the image. If it requires restoration work, this will become the 
background layer. Save this version with a new name. You now have the image 
digitized and can move forward with its restoration (Figure 2-9).

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
32
Scanning Slides and Negatives
The vast majority of your retouching and restoration tasks will involve working from photographic prints. 
Of course, transparencies can incur damage over time—mold and mildew, embedded dirt, and color 
shifts are fairly common. It might be a good idea to hire this task out, if you rarely come into contact with 
transparencies and don’t want to invest in a dedicated or multi-format scanner. On the other hand, if photo 
editing work will be part of your professional activities, then investing in a capable scanner would be a 
wise choice. Digitizing slides and negatives can add a boost to your income stream. A multi-format flatbed 
scanner offers added versatility. You’ll be able to obtain good scans from a variety of original photographic 
materials. These scanners use adapters to hold the transparencies in place on the scanner’s bed  
(Figure 2-10). A high-quality, dedicated slide/negative scanner can offer the ultimate in quality scans, with 
the best dynamic range (detail in shadow areas). It pays to do some research to best determine your needs, 
before making your purchase.
Figure 2-9.  The two parts unified into a complete image 

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
33
Before You Start
Remember the rule about starting with a clean scan? This is especially important when transparencies are 
involved. Every speck of dust and dirt shows up in a scan. A blower brush and a clean, lint-free cloth should 
be used to remove as much loose dust from transparencies as possible. It’s amazing how much you can 
reduce your workload simply by cleaning the transparency first, as well as making sure the scanner is clean. 
Figure 2-11 illustrates this point well. Notice the difference between the two scans of a 35mm color negative. 
Using a clean, lint-free cloth makes a huge improvement. Now it requires only minimal digital cleanup work. 
Of course, the results will vary: some transparencies will have more embedded dirt and dust than others. 
Film cleaning fluids are available but should be used with great care and lots of ventilation, as the fumes 
these fluids give off can be flammable, as well as dangerous, if breathed for prolonged periods.

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
34
Using the Auto-Settings
Normally, I don’t use the scanner’s automated features. I prefer to capture the image as close to original as 
possible.
However, some of the auto-settings can be expedient when scanning large quantities of slides or 
negatives and time is limited. I find the most useful are the color-correction and exposure-correction 
features. The dyes in slides often fade and change over time, and the images have often been shot at the 
wrong exposure. Figure 2-12 illustrates the improvement made in a 126 color slide taken in the 1960s. The 
image isn’t perfect, but it is a far cry from what it was.
Figure 2-11.  Cleaning this negative with a lint-free cloth makes a huge difference

35
Note
■
■
  While the aforementioned auto-settings can be time savers and work well, beware of ones such as 
Digital ICE or other dust-removal features. They can soften the image, resulting in diminished quality. The best 
action is to remove as much physical dust as possible before scanning. If you must use a dust-removal feature, 
try using minimal settings.
Figure 2-12.  The auto color feature improves this 126 color slide

Chapter 2 ■ Digitizing Your Photos, Slides, and Negatives 
36
Scanning Resolution for Transparencies
What resolution should you scan your slides and negatives? The answer is, it depends. Many of my clients no 
longer have a working slide projector but would like to be able to see their slides again. Usually, they want 
to view them as a slide show on their television or computer monitor. For that purpose, scanning them at 
an ultra-high resolution isn’t required. I find that scanning them at 400-600 DPI works well for viewing on a 
monitor or television screen, particularly in high definition.
However, the best option is scanning at a resolution to provide the highest quality image data.  
I normally scan them at a minimum of 1200 DPI, while scaling up to 4" × 6" for 35mm slides and negatives 
and 6" × 6" for 126 slides. Scanning at 2400 DPI or more is a better option, if the image will be printed at  
8" × 10" or larger. Most modern scanners are capable of resolutions well beyond 2400 DPI.
The reality is that scanning at such a high resolution creates a large file size, but you are capturing 
sufficient image data to provide adequate image quality. Trying to get a decent 8" × 10" print from a slide 
scanned at 300 DPI will only disappoint. Looking at the enlarged example, it’s easy to see how much more 
jagged the leaf on the left is from a 300 DPI scan, compared to the same leaf from a 1200 DPI scan, both 
taken from the same 35mm color negative (Figure 2-13).
Figure 2-13.  An enlarged section of a 300 DPI scan, compared to one at 1200 DPI, from a 35mm color negative
Straightening and Cropping Your Images
The images you work with will sometimes require straightening out by leveling the horizon line. Sometimes 
the original photograph has an irregular shape, and squaring it perfectly on the scanner’s bed is difficult, at 
best. Other times, the photographer may just have held the camera at an odd angle, resulting in a crooked 
image. Following are the steps to straighten an image in GIMP:
	
1.	
Scan the image into GIMP (Image Menu ➤ File ➤ Create ➤ Scanner/Camera). 
Select your scanner when prompted. The following sample image (ch2_tilted 
ocean.jpg) is also included in the Practice Images available for download from 
the Apress companion web page (mentioned in the Introduction), if you’d like to 
use it to follow along.
	
2.	
Select the Rotate tool (Shift + R). In Tool Options, make sure that the Corrective 
(Backward) button is active and that Crop to result is active. Set the number of 
lines to 25. Move the slider until the closest guide is parallel to the horizon line 
(Figure 2-14).

image. Compared to the before example, it now looks much better (Figure 2-16).

Summary
In this chapter, you learned that acquiring your photographic materials as digital images is the first step in 
the editing process, so it should be done as well as possible. There are choices as to whether to hire this task 
out or do it yourself, depending on what best suits you. When scanning your own photographic prints, dust 
removal is important, as is acquiring sufficient image data by scanning at the right resolution.
With a good tripod (or copy stand) and camera, you can digitize large images. It’s also possible to scan 
some larger photos in sections and to reassemble them as complete images.
Transparencies require an especially high degree of dust and dirt removal, because everything is 
captured by the scanner. Auto-settings, while not always ideal, can speed up the process of handling large 
quantities of transparencies. You also discovered that transparencies requiring high-resolution scanning 
capture the maximum image data.
Images will sometimes have to be straightened out after scanning, because of having an irregular shape 
or being shot at odd angles in the first place.
GIMP can easily fix tilted images and much, much more, as you’ll see as we proceed into Part II of  
this book.

Common Tonal Problems
Many old photographs have various tonal problems—low contrast, loss of detail from fading, darkening with 
age, etc. Even many of the pictures you currently shoot with your digital camera could probably benefit from 
tonal corrections. Sometimes, one or two adjustments are all that is needed to revive a dull photograph. 
Other problems will require a greater degree of correction.
Many, if not most, of the images you work with will require some degree of tonal adjustment. Tonal 
problems generally fall under one of the following descriptions:
The image is overexposed/too bright.
• 
The image is underexposed/too dark.
• 
The image has low contrast/dull and flat.
• 
Some images have local or mixed tonal issues. For example, an image might be properly exposed in one 
area and underexposed in another. 
Using the Histogram to Assess Tonality
A histogram (Figure 3-1) is a graphical representation of the pixel brightness values in an image, ranging 
from 0 (pure black) to 255 (pure white). Factors such as image tonality and exposure determine the shape of 
the histogram. Tonal correction tools such as Levels and Curves display a histogram in the window. You can 
also access the histogram window by itself (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Info ➤ Histogram).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure

You can look at an image and tell whether it’s too bright, too dark, etc. Viewing the histogram will show you 
how the image data is distributed within the image. This information is important for making the proper tonal 
correction, as you’ll see in more depth in the upcoming “Tonal Corrections Using Levels” section of the chapter.
The following examples demonstrate how the image tone distributes the data in a histogram.
Overexposed (too bright): Most of the image data is in the mid-range to the 
bright pixels in the histogram (Figure 3-2).
Figure 3-1.  A histogram represents pixel brightness in image data
Figure 3-2.  Most of the data is in the brightest range

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
43
Underexposed (too dark): Most of the image data is in the mid-range to the dark 
pixels in the histogram (Figure 3-3).
Figure 3-3.  Most of the data is in the darkest range

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
44
Balanced Tonality: The image data is spread across the full length of the 
histogram (Figure 3-5). 
Figure 3-4.  Most of the data is in the middle range
Low contrast (dull tone): More of the image data is in the mid-range, with none 
in the darkest or lightest ranges (Figure 3-4).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
45
Tonal problems could be due to improper lighting or exposure settings, or in the case of old 
photographs, chemical changes in the print itself over time. Old photographs will often have mixed tonal 
issues, such as uneven fading, which can make correction more complex and challenging.
Using the Color Picker Tool to Track Tonality
As mentioned in the Introduction, software to calibrate your monitor can be very helpful to display an image 
as accurately as possible. However, it’s a good idea to take measurements for an accurate readout of what 
pixel values you are seeing. What you see on your monitor may differ some from reality.
The Color Picker tool is used to sample areas to determine color values and tonal values. In the 
grayscale image in Figure 3-6, several areas have been sampled to determine the gray value (percentages) 
in various areas. A grayscale image (as displayed on a monitor) is made up of equal amounts of red, green, 
and blue light (you’ll learn more about color models in Chapter 4). Using the eyedropper to sample pixels 
will display the brightness value from 0 to 255, and also the RGB values. You can sample a single pixel, or an 
average of a radius of pixels you set the parameters for.
Figure 3-5.  Most of the data is spread throughout the histogram

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
46
Using Sample Points
Sample Points are markers that can be placed on four parts of an image, to help monitor specific areas as you 
edit. The data displayed will change in real time as you work. They can be used to keep track of highlights, 
mid-tones, and shadows throughout the image (Figure 3-7). They are useful when making tonal changes and 
show you certain areas that may be adversely affected, allowing you to selectively fine-tune those areas.
Figure 3-6.  Using the Color Picker tool to track tonality
Figure 3-7.  Tracking image data using Sample Points

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
47
You can access the Sample Points dialog from the Image menu (Windows ➤ Dockable Dialogs ➤ 
Sample Points). To create a Sample Point, Control + Click on one of the rulers in the image window, and drag 
with the mouse. Two perpendicular guides will appear. When you release the mouse button, the Sample 
Point will be placed where the two guides intersect (Figure 3-8). 
The Brightness-Contrast Dialog
This is the first tonal correction method that many beginners use. The Brightness-Contrast dialog (Figure 3-9) 
has two sliders: one for brightness and one for contrast. The adjustments are broad, with little ability to  
fine-tune, so this method of contrast adjustment has limits. When overused, it obliterates image detail.
Figure 3-8.  Creating a Sample Point 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
48
Although it can be useful in some instances where a light adjustment is all that’s required, the results 
can be destructive if you don’t use it carefully. There are some images that just won’t yield good results using 
this feature. Levels, Curves, and layer blend modes are much better options.
Tutorial 1: Brightness-Contrast Adjustment
In this exercise, we’re going to look at the basic Brightness-Contrast dialog. This image (Figure 3-10) is 
noticeably flat and dull. Although the Brightness-Contrast dialog is not the best tool to use, we’ll improve the 
image by using it.
Figure 3-9.  The Brightness and Contrast feature is a basic tonal correction tool

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
49
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_car) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Contrast 
Adjustment (Figure 3-11).
Figure 3-10.  A low-contrast image

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
50
	
3.	
Open the Brightness-Contrast dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤  
Brightness-Contrast).
	
4.	
I found increasing the brightness to 24 and the contrast to 35 improved the look 
overall (Figure 3-12).
Figure 3-11.  The background layer duplicated and renamed Contrast Adjustment
Figure 3-12.  The image is improved, but with some washed-out highlights 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
51
Although the contrast is improved, the outlined areas in the edited example are highlights blown to 
pure white, which illustrates this tool’s limitations (Figure 3-13).
Tonal Correction Using Levels
The Levels dialog box (Figure 3-14) allows you to shift the brightest, mid-tone, and darkest pixels in the 
image you are working with. Essentially, this allows you to make an image lighter or darker or to change the 
contrast. It also lets you make color adjustments, which we’ll look at in Chapter 4.
Figure 3-13.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
52
The Levels dialog displays a histogram, which is a graphical representation of the pixel values across 
the image, ranging from 0 (pure black) to 255 (pure white). Factors such as image tonality and exposure 
determine the shape of the histogram.
Levels allows you make changes on a composite of the red, green, and blue channels (Value) by default. 
Changes can be made on each color channel individually, which we’ll look at in Chapter 4.
Tutorial 2: Correcting Contrast with Levels
In this exercise, we’re going to improve the contrast in this image. As you can see in Figure 3-15, it has 
a rather flat tone. The highlight areas are dingy; the shadow areas are gray and muddy. A simple levels 
adjustment will make this photo pop out a lot more.
Figure 3-14.  The Levels dialog

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
53
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_lady by tree) found in the Practice Images folder. 
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Contrast 
Adjustment (Figure 3-16).
Figure 3-15.  A flat, dull image

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
54
	
3.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). Looking at the 
histogram, we can see that the image pixels are mainly in the middle range; it 
lacks shadow and highlight areas (Figure 3-17).
Figure 3-16.  .The background layer duplicated and renamed Contrast Adjustment

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
55
	
4.	
Move the black slider on the left toward the center and stop where the image data 
begins. Repeat the same step with the white slider. Move toward the center and 
stop where the image data begins (Figure 3-18).
Figure 3-17.  The histogram shows the lack of the darkest and lightest pixels

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
56
The image looks much better; the added contrast gives it more snap. The highlights are brighter, and the 
shadow areas are darker (Figure 3-19).
Figure 3-18.  Moving the black and white point sliders inward improves the contrast 
Figure 3-19.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
57
Tutorial 3: Using the Eyedroppers in Levels
Another method of improving contrast with Levels is using the Black and White Point eyedroppers These 
tools are used to sample the darkest and lightest areas of the image, to remap tonality and improve contrast.
This image (Figure 3-20) has very low contrast and is extremely flat. It’s difficult to know by visual 
evaluation alone where the darkest and lightest range of pixels exists in this image. We will use the Threshold 
feature to find the black and white points of this image. Threshold reduces the pixels to pure black and 
white. It can be used to find where the darkest and lightest pixels exist in an image.
Figure 3-20.  A very low-contrast image
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_lady with baby) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer three times (Shift + Control + D). Rename the 
first duplicate layer Contrast Adjustment. Rename the other two layers Black 
Point and White Point, respectively (Figure 3-21).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
58
	
3.	
Activate the White Point layer, then open the Threshold dialog box (Image Menu 
➤ Colors ➤ Threshold). Move the black slider to the far right, and then proceed 
to slowly move it toward the left, until the brightest cluster of pixels begins to 
emerge (Figure 3-22).
Figure 3-21.  Creating layers for use in finding black and white points
Figure 3-22.  Finding the white point of the image
	
4.	
Now activate the Black Point layer, and open the Threshold dialog again. Move 
the black slider to the far left, then slowly toward the right, until the darkest 
cluster of pixels begins to emerge (Figure 3-23).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
59
	
5.	
Lower the opacity of both the White Point and Black Point layers to about 50%, 
so that the image is partially visible and both the black and white reference areas 
are visible (Figure 3-24). 
Figure 3-24.  Lower the opacity of the layers, to see where to place the eyedroppers
Figure 3-23.  Finding the black point of an image
	
6.	
Click the Contrast Adjustment layer, to make it active, and open the Levels dialog 
box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). Use the black eyedropper to click the 
black point indicated by the Black Point layer. Repeat the same step with the 
white eyedropper on the white point. Do not click OK yet; keep the Levels dialog 
box open! Hide the Black and White Point layers at this point.
	
7.	
Now, adjust the midpoint slider slightly to the left, until the value is about 128, 
then click OK (Figure 3-25).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
60
Figure 3-25.  Sampling the darkest and lightest pixels to remap tonality
If the effect is too strong, it can be toned down just a little. You can fine-tune the results by reducing the 
Contrast Adjustment layer by 5–10%. The end result is an image that, although not perfect, is much better 
than before (Figure 3-26).
Figure 3-26.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
61
Tutorial 4: Enhancing Detail with Levels
This image has a different issue: slight underexposure. Although it’s subtle, the image is a bit too dark 
(Figure 3-27).
Figure 3-27.  This image is slightly too dark, hiding some of the detail
The detail in this image is slightly lacking in the darker areas. The middle slider in the Levels dialog box 
can correct this, by improving the overall brightness and pulling more detail from the darker areas. This is 
called a gamma correction.
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_canyon wall) found in the Practice Images folder. 
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Gamma 
Adjustment (Figure 3-28).

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
62
	
3.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). The histogram 
shows the two valleys in the middle area (on either side of the data spike).  
The highlighted end of the histogram is a bit shy of data as well (Figure 3-29).
Figure 3-28.  Creating a layer on which to make a gamma adjustment
Figure 3-29.  The two valleys in the mid-range area indicate a lack of some image data

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
63
	
4.	
Move the middle (gamma) slider slightly toward the left, to bring out the detail 
(the value should be about 1.50). Move the white slider to the left, to the point 
where the image data begins (Figure 3-30). 
Figure 3-31.  Before and after comparison
Figure 3-30.  Revealing detail by adjusting the midpoint slider
The result is an image that is brighter, more detailed, and less harsh than before—a more accurate 
portrayal of this scene on a bright, sunny mid-afternoon (Figure 3-31).
Tonal Corrections Using Curves
The Curves dialog box (Figure 3-32) allows you to shift the brightest, mid-tone, and darkest pixels in the 
image you are working with. As with Levels, this allows you to make an image lighter or darker or to change 
the contrast and color.

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
64
It also displays a histogram, as Levels does. A key difference in how curves work is the ability to isolate 
and adjust narrow ranges of tonality. You can attach anchor points to the adjustment curve, to prevent 
changes to a particular range of pixels, and apply changes to the range you want. As with Levels, Curves allows 
you to make changes on a composite of the red, green, and blue channels (Value) by default. Changes can be 
made on each color channel individually, as well as the Alpha channel, which we’ll look at in Chapter 4.
Tutorial 5: Correcting Contrast with Curves
This image is a little lackluster (Figure 3-33), so we’ll look at a simple way to snap it up. In this exercise, we’re 
going to bump the contrast up slightly, using the Curves dialog box. As previously mentioned, Curves offers 
a great degree of fine-tuning. For this image, we’re going to apply an S curve—a common technique used for 
improving contrast. As you might have guessed, an S curve bears a slight resemblance to the letter S.
Figure 3-32.  The Curves dialog box

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
65
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_cat) found in the Practice Images folder. 
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Contrast 
Correction (Figure 3-34).
Figure 3-33.  A good picture but a little low on contrast
Figure 3-34.  Creating a layer to make a Curves adjustment on

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
66
	
3.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). Make sure 
the Preview box is checked. Click the diagonal line toward the top and right 
(highlights). Pull up and slightly to the left. The anchor point should line up 
with the image data in the histogram. On the lower left (shadows), pull the line 
down and slightly to the right. Note the slight S shape in the curve adjustment 
(Figure 3-35)
Figure 3-35.  Making a slight S curve
The result is an image with better contrast (Figure 3-36). This action brightens the highlights and 
darkens the shadows in the image. The Curves dialog is a powerful correction tool well worth your time and 
practice. It works very well in tonal adjustments and is an excellent color-correction tool as well, as we’ll see 
in the next chapter. 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
67
Note
■
■
  Apply the S curve with a light touch. There is usually some loss of fine detail in the shadows and 
highlight areas, so make your adjustments gradually, while monitoring the detail.
Tutorial 6: Tonal Adjustment Using Curves (with Local Adjustments)
This exercise is similar to the previous one using levels to enhance the detail in the image of the canyon wall. 
In this image (Figure 3-37), we’ll make a minor Curves adjustment that will brighten the darker areas that 
should be lighter (essentially a digital fill flash).
Figure 3-36.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
68
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_myra) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Lighten 
(Figure 3-38).
Figure 3-37.  An image requiring selective tonal correction

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
69
	
3.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). Make a bow 
curve by clicking the center and pulling up and left, as shown in Figure 3-39. This 
will work like a fill flash and lighten the darker areas in the cast shadow. 
Figure 3-38.  Creating a layer to make a Curves adjustment on

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
70
	
4.	
The face is much better now, but the effect lightened the foreground, arm, and 
sunlit areas in the background a bit too much. We’ll now reduce this effect a bit. 
Add a layer mask to the Lighter layer (Right Click + Add Layer Mask), as shown in 
Figure 3-40.
Figure 3-39.  Making a bow curve to lighten the shadowy areas

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
71
	
5.	
Activate the layer mask by clicking it (it will have a white border around it). Using 
a large, soft brush at 50% opacity and black as the active color, paint back some of 
the washed out detail in these areas (Figure 3-41).
Figure 3-40.  Adding a layer mask to restore some of the over-affected areas

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
72
The result is much better (Figure 3-42). Using the layer mask is a way to perform selective tonal 
corrections with precision, by varying the brush opacity or using shades of gray as the paint color to control 
the pixel transparency.
Figure 3-41.  Painting on the layer mask restores some of the original tone 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
73
Tonal Corrections Using Layer Blend Modes
Layers have 21 different blend modes in GIMP. Blend modes control how layers interact with one another. 
They can produce a wide array of different effects. It’s worth spending time experimenting with them. You 
can come up with some interesting results. For the purposes of this chapter, we’ll only be concerned with 
two layer blend modes that are useful for correcting exposure—Multiply and Screen.
• 
Multiply: Multiplies the value of each pixel of the top layer with the corresponding 
pixel for the layer underneath, resulting in a darker image
• 
Screen: The opposite of Multiply, resulting in a brighter image
Layer blend modes are very useful for correcting overexposed and underexposed images. They often 
require duplication, adjusting opacity, and more than one blend mode. Using layer blend modes requires 
some experimentation, but they can work very well.
Figure 3-42.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
74
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D). Rename the duplicate layer 
Lighten, and change the blend mode to Screen (Figure 3-44). We can see that this 
has made quite a difference, but the image is still too dark.
Tutorial 7: Correcting an Underexposed Image
An underexposed image this dark might seem beyond saving, but using the Screen blend mode can bring it 
back. It works amazingly well, in many cases.
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_dark boat) found in the Practice Images folder (Figure 3-43).
Figure 3-43.  Very underexposed and dark image

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
75
	
3.	
Duplicate the Lighten layer twice. Lower the opacity to about 50% on the topmost 
layer, and the overall result turns out well (Figure 3-45).
Figure 3-44.  A noticeable difference from using one Screen layer
Figure 3-45.  The image looking much better

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
76
	
4.	
The result is much better. For a final touch, duplicate the background layer. We 
are going to use the Dodge tool to brighten up slightly the lettering on the ship’s 
stern (Figure 3-46). In the Tool options, choose the following settings:
Dodge option checked
• 
Highlights option checked
• 
Opacity 100%
• 
Exposure 80%
• 
Brush diameter set at 3 pixels
• 
Figure 3-46.  Using the Dodge tool to brighten the lettering

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
77
	
8.	
Use the Dodge tool on the lettering and the outline, as shown, to slightly brighten 
them up (Figure 3-47). (Go lightly; you don’t want the effect too intense.)
Figure 3-47.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
78
The final image is much better. Notice how the lettering stands out more, without being too intense.
Tutorial 8: Correcting an Overexposed Image
This image is a slide taken in the late 1960s that was overexposed at the time it was shot (along with 
numerous others in the family archives). Slide film’s exposure latitude is less forgiving than print film, so 
improperly exposed slides are fairly common.
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch3_overexposed beach) found in the Practice Images folder 
(Figure 3-48).
Figure 3-48.  Overexposed, with loss of detail
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Detail. 
Change the blend mode to Multiply (Figure 3-49). We can see it’s beginning  
to work. 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
79
Figure 3-49.  The Multiply mode adds detail and darkens the image
	
3.	
Duplicate the Detail layer. It will make the image a good deal darker, so lower the 
opacity to about 75% (Figure 3-50). It’s looking better—and will do for the time being.
Figure 3-50.  Duplicating the Detail layer 

Chapter 3 ■ Correcting Tone and Exposure
80
It’s much improved but could benefit from some color-correction work (Figure 3-51), which we’ll 
explore in Chapter 4.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the most common tonal problems and how to assess them, using the 
histogram. The Color Picker tool is a useful tool for sampling pixels, to determine brightness and RGB values. 
The assortment of tutorials demonstrated some powerful methods for making a variety tonal corrections in 
images, using GIMP. In the next chapter, you’ll learn about working with color.

Common Color Problems
When color became mainstream, our family photographs took on a new dimension. While monochrome 
photographs possess an aura of mystery, color photographs have an element of added realism. When we 
look at an old color family photo in pristine condition, memories rush back (I believe) more completely. We 
can instantly see the colors in a birthday cake or Halloween costume and relive those moments. Of course, 
it’s distracting to view a cherished photograph that has faded or shifted colors.
There are several factors that can result in color problems: bad processing, the wrong film type or 
camera settings, chemical changes over time, etc. The following are the color problems that often  
plague images:
Color casts and color shifts
• 
Faded colorExtreme color loss
• 
For me, one of the most challenging aspects I encounter as a professional retoucher is restoring images 
that have suffered extreme color loss, owing to fading over time. Many of these images were displayed in 
frames and exposed to damaging UV light that caused fading and color shifts. Many of the photographic 
papers and chemicals used during the late 1960s through the 1980s resulted in unstable prints that degraded 
at an accelerated rate.

Color Essentials
Before moving on to the tutorials, there are a few essentials that must be covered. In this section, you’ll learn 
about additive and subtractive color models and using the Color Picker tool to sample and determine color 
values. We’ll also look briefly at the RGB color channels.
Additive Color
The color we see on a computer monitor is composed of light, which is additive color. The most common 
color model is the RGB (which stands for red, green, and blue light), and is GIMP’s default mode for 
working with images. The RGB color mode can produce a little over 16.7 million colors. Full intensity of red, 
green, and blue light results in white (Figure 4-1), while zero intensity of each results in black. When the 
percentages of each are equal, it produces a shade of gray between black and white (as we saw in Chapter 3), 
but when the percentages differ, the result is a colorized hue.
Subtractive Color
Subtractive color is based on the absorption and reflection of light from printed pigments, dyes, and inks. 
Colors that are absorbed by a particular ink, pigment, or dye are being subtracted. For example, red ink 
reflects a red wavelength of light, but all other color wavelengths are absorbed. Black ink absorbs all color 
wavelengths, resulting in an absence of any color.
The CMYK color model is widely used in the offset printing industry. CMYK refers to the ink colors cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black (the K is assigned to black, because it means “key” in the printing industry). 
Theoretically, equal combinations of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink produce black (Figure 4-2), but in actual 
practice, the result is a dark brown. This necessitates black as a fourth color, for accurate reproduction of grays 
and black in print.
Figure 4-1.  The RGB (additive) color model

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
83
The RGB color model displays a much wider color range, or gamut, than the CMYK model. That’s why 
an image displayed on your monitor often appears to be more vivid than the printed version. 
Tip
■
■
  For creating a color-managed work environment, you might want to invest in color-measurement devices 
known as colorimeters and spectrophotometers. These devices come with their own configuration software.
The Color Picker Tool
In the previous chapter, we used this tool to evaluate tone in a grayscale image. It’s a good idea to develop 
the habit of using this tool for sampling and evaluating color values in the images you edit. Even if you have a 
well-calibrated monitor, the Color Picker tool will show you the actual color values you are working with.
In Figure 4-3, we can see the shoes are reddish in color, but sampling the area indicated shows the 
exact percentages of red, green, and blue under the RGB setting (make sure the Use Info Window option is 
checked). This tool will sample single pixels or an average of surrounding pixels, depending on the Radius 
setting used. In addition to the default RGB setting, it also displays readouts in the HSV (hue, saturation, 
value) and the CMYK modes.
Figure 4-2.  The CMYK (subtractive) color model

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
84
Note
■
■
   The Color Picker tool in GIMP isn’t currently color-managed, so the CMYK value should be viewed as 
an approximation of the color when printed.
The Color Picker tool is useful for identifying color casts in images, as we’ll see a little later in this chapter.
Color Channels
An RGB color image is a composite of three “storage bins,” or channels of color data, one of each for red, green, 
and blue. Note where each color is represented, by the brighter areas in each color channel (Figure 4-4).
Figure 4-3.  Sampling an area using the Color Picker tool

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
85
In GIMP, the channels are accessed in the Channels Palette. The tab to access the palette is right 
next to the Layers Palette tab (Figure 4-5). In some types of restoration work, it will be necessary to make 
adjustments to a specific color channel. The last tutorial in this chapter involves making an edit to a specific 
channel in a fairly complex color-correction exercise. Later in this book, we’ll also look at how some 
restorations can be done by merely keeping one channel and discarding the others.
Figure 4-4.  Color channels store color data for an RGB image

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
86
Correcting Color Casts
A color cast is a predominance of a certain color throughout the entire image. Color casts are usually 
unwanted, but sometimes, a photographer might be attempting a certain artistic effect for which the color 
cast is desirable. Most of the time, however, they are just representative of pictures that have gone wrong. 
Color casts can be the result of a number of factors: the wrong film type used for the light source, incorrect 
white balance setting in digital cameras, etc.
The Color Balance feature (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Color Balance) in GIMP essentially offsets a color 
cast by increasing its opposite color (Figure 4-6). This tool works fairly well on images with very light color 
casts, but for most images GIMP offers better methods of correction, as you’ll see shortly.
Tutorial 9: Correcting a Color Cast (No. 1)
This photo (Figure 4-7) was just one of about a dozen that displayed the same color imbalance, and all 
wound up with the same blue tinge. In this tutorial, we’ll correct this color cast, using the Filter Pack/Hue 
Variations function on this image.

To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch4_mister cash) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Color 
Correction (Figure 4-8).
Figure 4-7.  An image with a color cast

3.	
We can see by merely looking at the image that it has a blue color cast, but 
because I’d like to encourage you to get in the habit of using the Color Picker 
tool, go ahead and open it (keyboard shortcut O). Sample from a neutral color 
area, such as the wall (the pants would work as well). The readout shows a higher 
percentage of blue than red or green (Figure 4-9).

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
88
	
4.	
Open the Filter Pack Simulation option (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Filter Pack). 
This function simulates the use of colored filter gels. Click the Hue option, and 
the Hue Variations window will open (Figure 4-10).
Figure 4-10.  Hue Variations is a good way to correct color casts
Figure 4-9.  Taking a color sample from the wall
	
5.	
As does a color ring, Hue Variations show the opposite of a particular color 
directly across from it. Because this photo has a blue color cast, we have to click 
on the opposite color, which would be yellow, to counteract the excess blue.

6.	
The effect makes the image look much better, but I found the initial result a little 
too strong, so lowering the layer’s opacity to 90% did the trick. The contrast could 
be bumped up a bit, so at this point, duplicate the background layer and merge 
the Color Correction layer down (Figure 4-11).
Figure 4-11.  Lowering the layer’s opacity a bit, to reduce the effect
Figure 4-12.  A slight S curve will bump up the contrast
	
7.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). Make a slight  
S curve, as shown in Figure 4-12 (we just want to bump the contrast up slightly).
The end result looks much better (Figure 4-13). Slightly increasing the contrast makes the man’s 
undershirt less conspicuous under the thin fabric of the pale yellow shirt. Use the Color Picker tool to 
sample the wall again. You’ll see the percentage of red is now closer to that of the green and blue, resulting 
in an almost perfectly neutral gray. The Hue Variations function is often all that’s needed to correct a color 
cast—perhaps not in every case, but it’s a good place to start.

Tutorial 10: Correcting a Color Cast (No. 2)
This image, taken in the 1980s (Figure 4-14), has a mild color cast. We’ll use a “quick fix” method here, which 
is the Levels auto-setting. I’m generally not a fan of “auto” methods, but they do sometimes have their place 
and are worth trying before moving on to more complex manual correction methods.

To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch4_mom and daughter) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Color Correction (Figure 4-15).
Figure 4-14.  An image with a red color cast

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
92
	
3.	
We’ll now identify the color cast (it might be obvious, but let’s double-check 
anyway). Open the Color Picker tool (O). Sample the darker areas of the mom’s 
pants, which are the most neutral areas in the image (Figure 4-16). The readout 
indicates an excess amount of red for what should be close to a light gray.
Figure 4-16.  Taking a color sample from the most color neutral part of the image
	
4.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). Click the Auto 
button, and in one shot, you get the result below (Figure 4-17). Use the Color 
Picker tool to sample from the same area of the pants as previously, and you’ll 
see the color percentages match more closely.
Figure 4-17.  The auto feature produced good results
In this case, the Levels auto-setting did a decent job; it doesn’t always. In this case, it looks much better, 
compared to the original image (Figure 4-18). If you find the effect too intense, lower the opacity of the Color 
Correction layer.

Correcting and Restoring Color
Restoring faded color is fairly routine in the retouching/restoration profession. As mentioned earlier, 
color photographs often suffer to varying degrees from the ravages of time and destructive UV light. The 
following tutorials will demonstrate various methods of restoring lost or shifted colors, in increasing levels 
of difficulty.
Tutorial 11: Color Correction with Levels (No. 1)
If you recall, we worked on this image in Chapter 3. It was originally overexposed, and the density was 
restored by using the Multiply layer blend mode (Figure 4-19). The image was improved, but the color still 
requires some adjustment. Because each color channel has a different tonal value, we’re going to make 
adjustments on each one, to revive both contrast and color.
Figure 4-18.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
94
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch4_beach) found in the Practice Images folder.

Duplicate the background layer and rename it Color Correction (Figure 4-20).
Figure 4-19.  The colors need some improvement

Chapter 4 ■ Color Correction and Restoration
95
	
3.	
Open the Levels dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). Because each 
color channel has a different tonal value, we’re going to make adjustments 
on each one, to revive both contrast and color. In the Channels option, select 
the Red color channel (Figure 4-21). Move the black point slider to the right, 
stopping where the image data begins. Move the white point slider to the left, 
stopping where the image data starts. (Wait until you adjust all three color 
channels before clicking OK.)

Finally, select the Blue color channel and repeat the same steps with the black 
and white point sliders (Figure 4-23) and click OK.

After rebalancing each color channel, the final result has improved contrast, and the colors are much 
better (Figure 4-24).

  In Chapter 3, the tonal adjustments made on the grayscale images with Levels used the default Value 
setting in the dialog box. Grayscale images only have one gray channel. In RGB color images, the Value setting 
is a composite of the tonal information in the red, green, and blue color channels. Adjusting Levels using the 
Value setting makes broad color changes in the image, whereas adjusting each color channel is more precise.
Tutorial 12: Color Correction with Levels (No. 2)
In this exercise, we’ll be restoring faded color and improving tonality in the following image (Figure 4-25), 
with Levels. Because each color channel has a different tonal value, we’re going to make adjustments on 
each one, to revive both contrast and color.
Figure 4-25.  This image lost color over the years
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch4_girl fishing) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Open the Crop tool (Shift + C) and trim the borders away from the image 
(Figure 4-26), so they don’t “contaminate” the adjustment (as discussed in the 
Introduction).

Open the Levels dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). Because each 
color channel has a different tonal value, we’re going to make adjustments on 
each one, to revive both contrast and color (Figure 4-28). In the Channels option, 
select the Red color channel. Move the black point slider to the right, stopping 
where the image data begins. Move the white point slider to the left, stopping 
where the image data starts. (Wait until you adjust all three color channels before 
clicking OK.)

The final result is brighter, with enhanced contrast and improved colors (Figure 4-31). The Levels 
feature can perform minor miracles on color images.
Tutorial 13: Restoring Severe Color Loss
The following image has lost a great deal of color information over the years. The photograph (Figure 4-32) 
was taken in 1966 and has suffered severely since then. This tutorial will be a little longer than usual. We’ll 
use curves to do the majority of the corrections, but there will be some extra steps required to bring it back to 
(almost) new.

5.	
Open the Curves dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). As in the 
previous tutorial, because each color channel has a different tonal value, we’re 
going to make adjustments on each one, to revive both contrast and color. In the 
Channels option, select the Red color channel (Figure 4-35). Move the node to 
the left, stopping where the image data begins. (Wait until you adjust all three 
color channels before clicking OK.)

The image is now much better. The skin looks pale, so now we’ll warm it up just 
a little. Click the Curves adjustment in the center and pull down just slightly 
(Figure 4-38). Now you can click OK.

Now, open the Hue/Saturation dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). 
Adjust the Hue setting to -10 and boost the saturation by 10. This will further 
improve the overall color balance and saturation (Figure 4-39).
Figure 4-38.  This minor adjustment on the Blue channel warms the image slightly

10.	
We’ll now replace some of the density that was lost over time. Duplicate the Color 
Restore layer and rename it Density Restore. Set the blend mode to Multiply and 
lower the opacity to about 30% (Figure 4-40). Merge the Density Restore layer 
down to the Color Restore layer.

Open the Dodge/Burn tool (Shift + D). In the tool options, use the following 
settings:
1.	
Burn
2.	
Midtones
3.	
Exposure -15%
Using a large, soft brush, darken the lips slightly on the Color Restore layer copy (Figure 4-41). If you 
overdo it, you can lower the layer’s opacity to reduce the effect.

The darker areas in the hair have a green tinge, so we’ll correct that now. Create 
a new layer and name it Hair. Change the blend mode to Color. Using the Color 
Picker tool, sample some brown from the hair, to change the active color.
	
14.	
Paint over the darker areas using a large, soft brush to paint over the green tinge 
with brown (Figure 4-42). Lower the layer’s opacity some, if necessary.
Figure 4-42.  Removing the green tinge by painting brown over a layer set to the Color blend mode
	
15.	
Create a new layer, set the blend mode to Color and the opacity to about 8%. Using 
red as the active color and a large, soft brush, paint over the cheeks and ears, to add 
a little natural coloring. It’s a subtle but important touch (Figure 4-43).
Figure 4-43.  Adding a slight amount of red to the cheeks and ears
The image is now looking more like it should (Figure 4-44). It’s amazing how far along GIMP brought 
this image. The only thing left to do is to clean up the specks, small scratches, and dust. We’ll work with this 
image later, in Chapter 6.

Tutorial 14: Restoring an Uneven Color Shift
This image was displayed in a frame for more than 35 years (Figure 4-45). You can see the portion that was 
exposed to light has a bluish cast, while the rest of the image, protected by the frame, has a more subtle 
reddish cast. This tutorial will be even longer than the last one (but not terribly long).

Images with this type of issue often have damage to one of the color channels 
(usually the blue one). We’ll examine the channels in this image to see what 
we’re up against (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Components ➤ Decompose).  
This will create a separate file and extract the channels as layers (Figure 4-46).
Figure 4-46.  The damage is apparent on the Blue color channel

Now that the image is evened out, duplicate the background layer, then merge 
the Color Correction layer down onto the background layer copy. (It will now 
have the same name as the background layer.)
	
11.	
Duplicate the layer and rename it Levels Correction. Open the Levels dialog 
(Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels). We’re going to adjust each color channel 
to further correct the color and tone in the image. First, select the Red color 
channel, and move the black point slider to the right, until the value is about 56. 
Move the white point slider slightly to the left, until the value is about 233. The 
midpoint slider should be set at about 1.15 (Figure 4-50).

Summary
Color correction is a vital part of the photo retouching and restoration world. Being familiar with the 
additive and subtractive color models, color channels, and use of the Color Picker tool helps in making color 
corrections. Color casts are common in both old and newer photographic images, and GIMP has numerous 
options for correcting them.
GIMP is capable of restoring images with severe color loss, through such powerful features as Levels 
and Curves and layer blend modes, and by adjusting damaged color channels. In the next chapter, we’ll 
look at ways to enhance images through the creative use of color, such as digital sepia toning and colorizing 
grayscale images.

Reimagine Your Pictures
GIMP is the ideal program to reimagine your favorite images. Transport pictures back in time by 
converting them into black and white or sepia tone. You can give an old black-and-white portrait a new 
dimension by colorizing it. With GIMP and some imagination, you can be as creative as you want with the 
images you work with.
Converting Color into Black and White
The widespread availability of color photography certainly revolutionized the industry. I mentioned in the 
previous chapter how color opened up a new world to our photograph-viewing pleasure. However, black 
and white is still enjoyed by many. Some images you capture will just naturally seem to lend themselves to 
black and white—it’s basically working with color in reverse (for lack of a better phrase).
It might seem that converting a color image into black and white is just a matter of draining the color 
away. You can simply use the Hue/Saturation dialog and reduce the color saturation to zero. While that does 
work, in the sense that it removes color, it will often leave behind an image that is flat, dull, or even unnatural 
looking, depending on the colors in the original image (see Figure 5-1). There is usually some tweaking 
required to achieve optimal results. An ideal black-and-white image has a wide range of grays, with deep, 
rich shadows for the darkest areas and bright highlights, without being washed out to pure white (except for 
specular highlights, such as reflection of light off of chrome).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color

  You’ve probably noticed that I’ve used the term grayscale in earlier chapters when referring to what 
are normally known as black-and-white images. Grayscale is technically the proper term to refer to a digital  
image that is made up of black, white, and shades of gray. In the world of photography, such an image is  
typically referred to as black-and-white, so for the purposes of this book, I use the terms interchangeably.
In the following example (Figure 5-1), you can see the image in the center looks a bit flat—especially 
the woman in the pink dress with the dark tan. This was the result of using the Hue/Saturation dialog to 
simply remove the color. The black-and-white image at the bottom of Figure 5-1 was achieved by using the 
Decompose dialog, to separate the image into its Red, Green, and Blue color channels as layers. For the 
woman in pink, the best tonal information is in the Red channel, so I used a layer mask with light gray as the 
active color, to refine her image, and various grays and black for other parts of the image, to fine-tune it.
Figure 5-1.  Using the Hue/Desaturation dialog vs. fine-tuning the color channels converted to layers
By finishing off with a slight S curve, I achieved a better black-and-white image. (Notice that the woman’s 
dress doesn’t look so flat, and the skin looks more natural.)

Tutorial 15: Converting Color to Black and White (No. 1)
The first method of converting a color image to black and white is relatively straightforward and will 
generally work well for making quick conversions.
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_old church) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Black and White Layer.
	
3.	
Open the Desaturate dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Desaturate). This 
is different from the Hue/Saturation dialog. It offers a choice of shades of gray, 
based on Lightness, Luminosity, or Average (Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2.  The Desaturate dialog offers some limited but often useful options for converting color  
images to black and white
Determining which option to choose really depends on what looks best to you. As with many aspects 
of image editing, there is an element of subjectivity involved. Personally, I thought the Luminosity setting 
looked the best, so I chose this option. It works very well for a quick conversion. (Figure 5-3).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
118
Tutorial 16: Converting Color to Black and White (No. 2)
Using the Channel Mixer for converting color into black and white offers a greater degree of fine-tuning but 
takes some time and practice. It’s worth the effort, so that you can end up with superb color to black-and-white 
conversions.
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_old church) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Black and White Layer.
	
3.	
Open the Channel Mixer dialog box. Check the Monochrome and Preserve 
Luminosity options.
	
4.	
Experiment with the settings until you get the result you want. I found, for my 
liking, the following settings were about right: Red 190.9, Green 124.2, and  
Blue -18.2 (Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-3.  Before and after comparison 
Figure 5-4.  Fine-tuning color to black-and-white conversions with the Channel Mixer creates an image

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
119
This method is worth investing some time and practice in, when using the first “quick” method of 
conversion doesn’t quite give you the results you want. In this case, the result was only marginally better. If 
you are converting a color image that has a damaged color channel into black and white, this method can 
make a world of difference in the finished version.
Tutorial 17: Converting Color to Black and White (No. 3)
As we briefly saw earlier, another way of converting color images to black and white is to use the Decompose 
dialog, to create a new image with the separated color channels as layers. This method offers a great deal of 
control in the final outcome, because you can use the best attributes from each channel, employing a layer 
mask (or masks).
We’ll convert this wedding photo (Figure 5-5) into black and white, by working with the Decompose dialog.
Figure 5-5.  A wedding color photo that would look great as a black-and-white image
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_just married 2000) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Open the Decompose dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Components ➤ 
Decompose). Choose the default RGB Color Model setting and select the 
Decompose to Layers option.
	
3.	
The image will appear in black and white, with the Red channel on top (Figure 5-6).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
120
	
4.	
Right-click the active layer (Red) and add a layer mask from the drop-down menu.
	
5.	
Using a soft brush and a 25%–35% gray as the active color, paint the faces of the 
bride and groom and the red flowers, to reveal some of the tonal information of 
the layer (green) underneath. Use black to paint the heads of the children and 
the top of the small tree (Figure 5-7).
Figure 5-6.  The color image split into the Red, Green, and Blue color channels. Red is at the forefront

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
121
As we’ve seen in these tutorials, achieving good color to black-and-white conversions requires some 
degree of manual control, but it’s worth it to take the time to practice. You’ll develop a keen ability to create 
aesthetically pleasing black-and-white images (Figure 5-8). 
Figure 5-7.  Using a layer mask to fine-tune the results

Digital Sepia Toning
GIMP can effectively emulate the effect of sepia toning. In the traditional darkroom method, a chemical 
process is used on silver-based black-and-white photographic prints to give them a warm, brownish tone. 
Many photographs from the late 1800s and early 20th century are sepia toned. There are several ways to 
digitally apply a sepia tone using GIMP. We’ll look at two in this chapter.
In the way that some images lend themselves to conversion from color to black and white, some can 
also be enhanced (or just given an artistic element) by applying a sepia tone. It works well with images such 
as the church we worked with previously. Like conversion to black and white, sepia toning seems to take an 
image back in time.
Tutorial 18: Converting Color to Sepia (No. 1)
We’re going to work with the same image of the church that was converted to black and white in the previous 
tutorial. This first method is a very easy and quick way to produce a sepia tone.
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_old church) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Sepia Layer. 
Open the Colorize dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Colorize) and set the 
Hue slider to a value of about 30 and the Saturation to around 40 (Figure 5-9) and 
click OK. If you decide you don’t like the results, just undo the effect (Control + Z) 
and start over.

Tutorial 19: Converting Color to Sepia (No. 2)
In this tutorial, we’ll use a different approach to achieve a sepia tone. Although the method is different, the 
results are similar. I prefer this way of applying a sepia tone, but the previous method is no less valid.
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
As in the previous lesson, open the image (Ch5_old church) found in the 
Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Black and 
White Layer.
	
3.	
Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Sepia. Change the blend 
mode to Color.
	
4.	
Fill the Sepia Layer with a brown-orange color. If you’d like to duplicate the same 
color used in this lesson, double-click the foreground color swatch and enter the 
values R 176, G 116, and B 62 in the Change Foreground Color dialog (Figure 5-10).
Figure 5-9.  Using the Colorize dialog to apply a sepia tone to this image

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
124
	
5.	
Using the Bucket Fill tool (Shift + B), fill the Sepia Layer. The image will now have 
a sepia appearance (Figure 5-11).
Figure 5-12.  Lowering the layer’s opacity reduces the sepia effect
You might prefer a more subtle sepia tone. If you want to reduce the sepia effect, simply lower the layer’s 
opacity. In the following example (Figure 5-12), the effect is less intense.

Selective Colorizing
If you’ve ever seen the 1998 movie Pleasantville, then selective colorizing will probably seem familiar.  
In the movie, a teenage boy and his twin sister are transported into a fictional 1950s black-and-white 
sitcom. As the movie progresses, color begins to emerge here and there, mixed with a world made up of 
shades of gray.You can create some interesting images using this technique. I like to use it sparingly, by 
accenting a black-and-white image with small splashes of color. It’s a fun technique to experiment with. 
Give it a try, using your own images.
Tutorial 20: Mixing Color with Black and White
This is the image we converted into black and white earlier. It is also a good subject for selective 
colorizing (Figure 5-13).
Figure 5-13.  A good image for mixing color and black and white
To convert this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5-selective color) found in the Practice Images folder. 
This is a .PSD (Photoshop) file with two layers.
Note
■
■
  I chose to use a .PSD format, in case there are some readers who might be using Adobe Photoshop 
instead of GIMP for these tutorials. GIMP is perfectly capable of handling these files. 

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
126
	
2.	
Right-click the Black and White Layer and add a layer mask from the drop-down 
menu (Figure 5-14).
Figure 5-14.  A layer mask added to the Black and White Layer
	
3.	
Choose a soft brush with black as the active color and paint on the flowers, the 
girl’s hair bow, etc., to reveal color from the layer beneath (Figure 5-15). You can 
do more than what is shown, if you’d like to play around. If you don’t like your 
results, switch to white and add the gray back to the areas where you don’t want 
any color (Figure 5-15).

Tutorial 21: Mixing Color with Sepia
In this tutorial, we’ll be mixing color with sepia. In this instance, the colors will be more muted, giving the 
image a unique look. Figure 5-16 shows the image we will be converting.

To edit this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_old church 2) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Sepia.
	
3.	
Open the Colorize dialog box (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Colorize), set the  
Hue slider to a value of about 30 and the Saturation to about 40  
(Figure 5-17) and click OK.
Figure 5-17.  Using the Colorize dialog to apply a sepia tone to the image
	
4.	
Add a layer mask to the Sepia Layer (Right-click Layer ➤ Add Layer Mask).
	
5.	
Activate the background layer by clicking it. Choose the Select by Color tool  
(Shift + O). Check the Feather Edges option and set the Radius to 10 pixels. Set 
the Threshold to 25.
	
6.	
Click inside the sky area (Figure 5-18).

7.	
For parts of the sky that weren’t selected, choose the Free Select tool (F) and 
add to the selection by holding the Shift key and drawing around those areas 
(Figure 5-19). For areas that were selected but shouldn’t have been, hold the 
Control key and draw around those areas, to subtract them.

8.	
Click the layer mask to activate it. Double-click the foreground color swatch and 
choose a middle gray (about 50%). Using the Bucket Fill tool (Shift + B), fill in the 
selected area to reveal the blue in the sky. It will be muted, because we used gray 
(Figure 5-20).
Figure 5-20.  The gray in the layer mask reveals a muted blue sky

Choose a soft brush and paint around on the layer mask with various shades 
of middle-range and darker grays, revealing subtle colors throughout the 
image (Figure 5-21).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
131
The end result is an image with a quaint, vintage look (Figure 5-22). You can vary the results by painting 
on the layer mask with black (which will reveal full color), various grays, and white (which will completely 
mask the colors).

Colorizing Black-and-White Images
I must admit this is one of my favorite editing activities. It’s almost like working on a grown-up version of a 
coloring book—but with much better results. Adding color to old black-and-white images is requested by my 
clients fairly often, so it’s a good skill to acquire for those offering their services professionally.
Tutorial 22: Colorizing Black-and-White Images
In this tutorial, we’ll colorize an old family photo from the mid-1950s (Figure 5-23).
Figure 5-23.  1950s image perfect for colorizing
In this lesson, I’ll provide the skin and hair values. The rest you can approximate, if you like. You don’t 
have to match the clothing, wall, or table covering exactly. You can use the Hue/Saturation dialog  
(Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Hue/Saturation) on any layer you colorize to change the hue.
To colorize this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch5_colorize little boy) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Edit Layer.
	
3.	
Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Skin (or Skin Tone). Change 
the layer’s blend mode to Color.
	
4.	
Using the Change Foreground Color dialog, pick a flesh color. You can double-
click the foreground color swatch and input the values R 247, G 202, and B 153 in 
the Change Foreground dialog (Figure 5-24).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
133
	
5.	
Lower the Skin Layer’s opacity to 30%–35% and paint in the flesh color, using a 
soft brush (Figure 5-25). You’ll have to vary the brush size as you work, enlarging 
it to cover large areas and reducing it to paint small areas.
Figure 5-24.  The values to enter for flesh color
Figure 5-25.  Painting a translucent flesh color  on a layer set to the Color blend mode

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
134
	
6.	
Add a layer mask to the Skin Layer (Right-click Layer ➤ Add Layer Mask). Using a 
small, soft brush and a middle gray as the active color, paint on the layer mask to 
remove some of the skin color from the eyes (Figure 5-26).
Figure 5-26.  Removing some of the color by painting on a layer mask
	
7.	
Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Hair. Change the layer’s 
blend mode to Color.
	
8.	
Using the Change Foreground Color dialog, pick a pale yellow to use for a very 
light blond. The values used here are R 254, G 229, and B 162, which can be 
entered in the Change Foreground Color dialog.
	
9.	
Lower the Hair Layer’s opacity to about 20%, and paint the blond color in, using 
a soft brush. You’ll have to vary the size of the brush as you work, enlarging it to 
cover large areas and reducing it to paint small areas.
	
10.	
Repeat this process with the overalls, ball, socks, shoes, etc. All the layers will 
be set to the Color blend mode, with the opacity varying from 30% to 35%. 
You’ll have to experiment some to get the look you want (Figure 5-27). Add 
layer masks to your layers, if you have to remove any excess color from around 
the edges.

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
135
Figure 5-27.  Adding color on layers set to the Color blend mode
	
11.	
The finishing touches will be the eyes and the face. Create a new layer  
(Shift + Control + N) and set the blend mode to Color. Paint a little light blue 
to color the eyes. Don’t over do it, so that it will look natural. The layer opacity 
should be about 15%.
	
12.	
Last, create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and set the blend mode to Color. 
Paint some red on the lips, cheeks, and ear. This layer will require low  
opacity—about 9%–10%. Even set that low, I added a layer mask (Right-click 
Layer ➤ Add Layer Mask) and painted away some of the excess red from the 
cheeks, using a mid-gray as the color. You want just a hint of red, for a look as 
close to natural as possible (Figure 5-28).

Chapter 5 ■ Creative Use of Color
136
Your version may look a little different from this one. It’s okay to choose different colors for the wall, 
tablecloth, etc. The main thing is making the eyes, skin, lips, and hair look as natural as possible. For the wall 
and table covering, I chose colors that looked like they would fit the time period, but they can be varied.
One thing to remember when colorizing images is that it’s better to have colors that are a little 
undersaturated than too saturated. Oversaturation doesn’t look natural. That’s why it’s important to use a 
separate layer for everything you colorize. You want to be able to fine-tune color intensity by adjusting layer 
opacity. With practice, you can achieve results that look reasonably realistic (Figure 5-29).

Summary
By using GIMP, you can get creative in the use of color in your images. Converting color images into black 
and white (I suppose one could argue) is still working with color. Adding a sepia tone to your images can 
give them a vintage look, and combining color with black and white or sepia introduces a unique, artistic 
look to images.
Colorizing black-and-white images can be really fun. Clients often request this service, so it pays to be 
skilled in colorizing images.

Digital Cleanup with GIMP
Many of the images you’ll work with will require digital cleanup and repair. GIMP is the perfect tool for 
removing dust from scanned slides (that is, the embedded dust that won’t come off when doing the pre-scan 
cleaning we covered in Chapter 2). Using GIMP, you’ll be able to remove unsightly small spots and scratches 
as well.
Removing Dust and Crud from Images
Older prints and slides often have embedded dust, small particles of dirt, etc. that will have to be digitally 
removed after scanning. Transparencies, in particular, are often plagued with dust, dirt, and mold particles. 
While some scanners have built in “dust removal” features in their software, these can often soften the image 
a great deal in the process. Using the tools GIMP has to offer will allow a more precise, surgical approach to 
removing imperfections, thus maintaining the overall sharpness of the image. The tutorials in this chapter 
will give you some useful practice for eventually tackling heavy damage, as we’ll see in the next chapter.
Tutorial 23: Removing Dust from a Slide
This slide from the 1950s (Figure 6-1) has a great deal of dust particles embedded throughout, but this is 
most noticeable in the sky area. Dust removal can be a time-consuming task, but in some instances, it can be 
sped up. The dust in the sky area can be almost completely obliterated in a couple of minutes.

■
  This method of mass dust removal, which we performed on the sky portion of the image, should be 
used on areas of unimportant image detail, such as sky and clouds, solid walls (with no patterns), concrete 
sidewalks, etc.

Tutorial 24: Removing Dust and Light Scratches 
We corrected the color in this image back in Chapter 4 (Figure 6-8), and now it’s time to clean up the light 
scratches, blemishes, and dust.

We’ll start with the scratch above the eye. Activate the Healing tool (H). Choose 
the brush with the 050 hardness value from the tool options. Set the brush size to 
just slightly larger than the scratch. 
	
4.	
Click an area nearby to sample the tone and texture and drag along the scratch to 
remove it. Resample frequently as you work (Figure 6-10).

5.	
In the two large shadow areas in the hair, use the same method of mass dust 
removal as you did in the previous tutorial (when removing dust from the sky 
area). The only difference here is that you’ll set the layer’s blend mode to Darken 
only, because there are light dust specks against a dark background (Figure 6-11).  
Figure 6-11.  Removing the light dust specks by selecting the Darken only blend mode

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal

6.	
The remaining work is just a matter of removing the dust specks, using the 
Healing tool in most cases. Larger blemishes are usually better removed with the 
Clone tool (Figure 6-12).  
Figure 6-13.  Before and after comparison
Figure 6-12.  Removing larger imperfections with the Clone tool
This image had a great deal of dust, some small scratches, and a few other imperfections that required 
some time and work to remove, but the result is a much cleaner image (Figure 6-13). 

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal

Note

■
   Gently cleaning a photograph, slide, or negative with a clean, lint-free cloth can go a long way toward 
removing loose dust (as we saw in Chapter 2) and can reduce the digital-editing workload a great deal. 
Tutorial 25: Removing Stains
Stains on old photographs are fairly common, such as in the example in Figure 6-14. Even though it looks 
rather nasty, this one can be removed fairly easily by separating the image into its RGB channels.
Figure 6-14.  An old photograph with a rust-colored stain
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch6_stained photo) found in the Practice Images folder. 
	
2.	
Separate the image using the Decompose feature (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ 
Components ➤ Decompose). This will create a separate file and extract the 
channels as layers (Figure 6-15). 
Be sure to use the default RGB color model and leave the Decompose by layers option checked.

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal
153
	
3.	
Close the original image (Ch6_stained photo). You’ll be editing this copy from 
this point on.
	
4.	
Change the color mode to RGB (Image Menu ➤ Image ➤ Mode ➤ RGB). 
	
5.	
We can see that it already looks much better, but it does need some work. There 
is some writing on the back of the photograph that is bleeding through slightly. 
Just to see where the damage is, hide the Red layer. There is slight damage on the 
Green layer, most of it is on the Blue layer (Figure 6-16). 
Figure 6-15.  The stained image separated into layers, using its RGB channels

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal
154
	
6.	
Delete the Green and Blue layers. Rename the Red layer “Background Layer.” 
Duplicate it and rename it “Clone-Heal Layer.” 
	
7.	
The rest of the repair work entails cleanup. Remove the larger imperfections on 
the face, shirt, and background, using the Clone and Healing tools (Figure 6-17). 
Figure 6-17.  Cleaning up the face, using the Healing tool

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal
155
	
8.	
After your digital cleanup work, rebuild the missing area along the top of the 
image, using the Clone tool (C), to give it a straight edge (Figure 6-18). 
Figure 6-18.  Rebuilding the missing area along the top
	
9.	
Colorize the image by opening the Colorize dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ 
Colorize). By using a Hue value of 60 and the Saturation set to 10, the result is a 
nice, subtle sepia tone (Figure 6-19).  
Figure 6-19.  Applying a light sepia tone to the image

Chapter 6 ■ Dust, Light Scratch, and Stain Removal
156
If not for the Red channel being largely undamaged by the stain, this restoration task would have been 
much more difficult and time-consuming. The result is a nice, cleaned-up image (Figure 6-20). In some 
color images that are stained, try decomposing the channels into layers to isolate the problem area(s). It is 
sometimes possible to edit the problematic channel to correct the issue.
Summary
GIMP is extremely useful for removing dust and other minor imperfections from your photos, negatives, 
and slides. You can remove dust quickly in areas with unimportant image detail, such as sky, clouds, solid 
walls, etc., in a few operations, saving time. The Healing and Clone tools are essential tools for cleaning up 
stray dust, light imperfections, and scratches. By using the Decompose dialog, color stains on monochrome 
or duotone images can often be removed by simply discarding the damaged color layer(s) and utilizing the 
best one.
GIMP is not limited to minor fixes and light cleanup work. It’s a powerful asset for repairing and 
restoring images with moderate and even severe forms of damage, as you’ll see in the next chapter.

Repairing Moderate Damage
GIMP is a very capable program for restoring and repairing damaged photographs. Of course, like anything 
else, photo restoration takes practice and patience to master. The tutorials in this chapter may be a bit 
challenging if you’re a beginner, but stick with it! If your first attempts aren’t as good as you’d like them to be, 
try again. You’ll get the hang of it before you know it—if you apply yourself.
Covering Up the Damage
The vast majority of digital restoration is simply “borrowing” from good parts of an image and covering up 
the damaged portions. Of course, the cover-up must be seamless, to avoid detection. In the tutorials that 
follow, you’ll be patching large areas of damage, as well as using the Clone and Healing tools for the majority 
of your work. You got a feel for these tools in two of the previous tutorials—now you’ll use them to repair 
damage on a much greater scale.
Tutorial 26: Patching Damaged Areas
The following photograph was stuck to the glass of a picture frame (a fairly common issue) and, as you can 
see, resulted in some nasty torn areas (Figure 7-1).

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
158
Sometimes, in these editing situations, using the Clone tool in the larger areas results in a soft, 
detectable repair, because of the grain and texture in the surrounding image area. In such cases, creating a 
patch will offer a good repair solution.
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch7_torn background) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Edit  
(or Repair) Layer (Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-1.  Torn areas, resulting from sticking to the glass of a picture frame (Image courtesy of the  
Martin family)

159
	
3.	
Using the Free Select tool (F), set the Feather Edges radius to 30–35 pixels. Make 
a selection above the large tear (Figure 7-3). Make sure the selection is a good bit 
larger than the damaged spot.
Figure 7-2.  A duplicate layer to edit and repair

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
160
	
4.	
We’ll now copy this selection and paste it as a new layer (Control + C and  
Control + V). It will appear as Floating Selection in the Layers palette. Right-click 
the floating selection and select the To New Layer option from the drop-down 
menu.
	
5.	
Rename the layer Patch. Using the Move tool (M), place it over the torn area.
	
6.	
Because the background’s tone is lighter at the top and gradually darkens toward 
the bottom, the repair patch will be lighter than the surrounding background. 
Open the Levels dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels) and move the midpoint 
(gamma) slider to the right until the tone matches. The value should be around 
0.90–0.92 (Figure 7-4). You might have to move the black-point slider very slightly 
to the right. By now, you should have a good match, but experiment as needed.
	
7.	
Expand the Patch Layer’s boundary size to the same as the image  
(Right-click ➤ Layer to Image Size). Using the Eraser tool (Shift + E) with a large, 
soft brush (about 0.25 hardness), work along the edge of the Patch Layer to blend 
it in further—be careful not to remove too much.
	
8.	
Now we’ll create a patch for the smaller damaged areas. Make a selection of the 
right side of the background, as shown in Figure 7-5, using the Freehand Select 
tool (F) with the Feather Edges radius set to 30–35 pixels.

will appear as Floating Selection in the Layers palette. Right-click the floating 
selection and select the To New Layer option from the drop-down menu.
	
10.	
Rename this layer Patch 2. Use the Flip tool (Shift + F) to reverse the direction of 
this layer (Figure 7-6).

Lower the layer’s opacity enough to see the area beneath. Use the Eraser tool

Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Clone Layer. Move it between 
the two patch layers (Figure 7-10).
	
15.	
Use the Clone Tool (C) with a soft brush on the Clone Layer to fill in the torn area 
on the girl’s dress. The cloning won’t extend into the background, because the 
Clone Layer was placed beneath the Patch 2 Layer (Figure 7-11). Finish off by 
cloning away the small section of border on the bottom and any small specks and 
dust throughout the image.

In just a few steps, we now have an image that is restored and looking like new (Figure 7-12). This patch 
method also works well in images with missing areas of foliage, bodies of water, etc.
Tutorial 27: Repairing Moderate Damage
Scratches in old photographs (Figure 7-13) are very common in the world of restoration. They can be 
especially tricky when they occur in facial areas, as in this image. This tutorial will provide you with plenty of 
practice in using the “dynamic duo” of the tool set—the Clone and Healing tools.

To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch7_moderate repair) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Open the Crop tool (Shift + C) and trim the borders (Figure 7-14).

Using the Clone tool (C), clean up the area shown in Figure 7-16. This area will 
be used to patch the upper-left corner.

5.	
Using the Free Select tool (F) with the Feather Edges radius set to about  
15 pixels, draw a triangle larger than the missing area on the area you just 
cleaned up. Copy this selection and paste it as a new layer (Control + C and 
Control + V)—it will appear as Floating Selection in the Layers palette. Right-click 
the floating selection and select the To New Layer option from the drop-down 
menu (Figure 7-17).
Figure 7-17.  Make a triangular selection of a good area to create a patch for the missing corner
	
6.	
Rename the layer Corner Patch. Using the Move tool (M), place it over the torn 
area. The background’s tone will be lighter than the patch. Open the Levels 
dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels) and move the midpoint (gamma) slider 
slightly to the left until the tone matches. The value should be around 1.10 
(Figure 7-18). You might have to move the black-point slider very slightly to the 
right. By now, you should have a good match, but experiment as needed.

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
171
	
7.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it  
Edit (or Repair) Layer.
	
8.	
Using the Healing tool (H), start working on the small scratches in the hair. The 
Healing tool will blend in the surrounding texture for a seamless repair (Figure 7-19).

Larger areas are often better repaired with the Clone tool (C), so alternate between the two as needed 
(Figure 7-20).
	
9.	
When finished with the hair, move on to the face. Use the Healing tool (H) to 
remove the stains, as shown in Figure 7-21.

Now, it will get a bit tricky. The damage around the mouth has to be addressed and 
may require more than one attempt. Create a new layer (above the Repair Layer) 
and name it Lip Repair Layer. Use the Clone tool (C), and with a soft brush 
rebuild the missing area below the lower lip (Figure 7-22).
Figure 7-21.  Using the Healing tool to remove stains

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
174
	
11.	
Use the Blur/Sharpen tool (Shift + U), set to Blur, to smooth out the cloned areas 
and blend the repair in.
	
12.	
Use the Dodge/Burn tool (Shift + D), set to Burn, and an exposure of about 15–20 
to gently replace the shadow that may have been removed during the repair work 
(Figure 7-23).
Figure 7-22.  Using the Clone tool to repair the damaged area around the lip

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
175
	
13.	
After you repair the mouth area, clean up the rest of the photograph with 
the Healing and Clone tools. The next thing we have to do is smooth out the 
background some. Using the Free Select tool (F) with the Feather Edges radius 
set to about 35 pixels, draw around the subject, as shown in Figure 7-24.
Figure 7-23.  Replacing the shadow with the Burn tool

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
176
	
14.	
Copy the selection and paste it as a new layer (Control + C and Control + V)—it 
will appear as Floating Selection in the Layers palette. Right-click the floating 
selection and select the To New Layer option from the drop-down menu.
	
15.	
Open the Gaussian Blur dialog (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Blur ➤ Gaussian Blur). 
Set the Blur Radius to about 30 (both Horizontal and Vertical) and the RLE Blur 
Method.
	
16.	
The background is now much smoother, but the texture is gone and must be 
replaced. Open the RGB Noise dialog (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Noise ➤ RGB Noise). 
De-select the Independent RGB option and move one of the sliders to about 
0.03—each slider for Red, Green, and Blue will move in unison (Figure 7-25).
Figure 7-24.  Replacing the shadow with the Burn tool

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
177
	
17.	
Apply the Blur filter (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Blur). This will blur the noise just 
enough to create a match to the texture in the surrounding image area.
	
18.	
Hide the background layer and merge the visible layers (Right-click in the layer 
palette and choose Merge Visible Layers from the drop-down menu). Turn the 
background layer’s visibility back on.
	
19.	
The finishing touch is now to boost the contrast just a little. Open the Curves 
dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Colors ➤ Curves). Make a slight “S” curve, as 
shown in Figure 7-26.
Figure 7-25.  Adding some noise to replace the lost texture

Repairing Heavy Damage
Over the years, it seems that most of the restoration work that comes my way results from damage like that 
on the image shown in Figure 7-28 (or worse). Heavy damage such as this requires extensive use of the 
Healing and Clone tools, and in this case, you’ll also be using the Resynthesizer plug-in to quickly repair the 
larger cracks. This can be very helpful, by automatically blending in surrounding texture and tone. It can be a 
huge time-saver.
Figure 7-28.  An image with heavy damage
Tutorial 28: Repairing Heavy Damage
To correct this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch7_cracks and creases) found in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer (Shift + Control + D) and rename it Edit 
(or Repair) Layer. You’ll use this layer mostly for the Healing tool and the 
Resynthesizer plug-in.
	
3.	
Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Clone Layer. I find it 
helpful to have an extra layer available to work on when the damage is this bad. 
Sometimes, the first cloning attempts don’t work the way you want, so it’s useful 
to be able to erase and try again if necessary (Figure 7-29).

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage

4.	
Repairing the damage in faces is usually the most difficult; I prefer to start there 
to get it out of the way before moving on. Working on the Repair Layer, use the 
Healing tool to work on the face and hair (Figure 7-30).
Figure 7-29.  An extra layer for cloning

5.	
Repairing the tooth and lips will require some careful cloning. Working on the 
Clone Layer, use the Clone tool to work on this area. Make sure the Sample 
Merged box is checked in the Tool Options (Figure 7-31).
Figure 7-31.  Fine work on the tooth and lips using the Clone tool
Note
■
■
  The Resynthesizer plug-in is run by a script called Heal Selection that you’ll use in this tutorial. It is a 
useful feature designed for removing unwanted objects in images and can often be used to repair wider cracks, 
creases, and other large areas of damage. Using the Free Select tool (F), make a selection around the cracks,  
as shown on the Repair Layer (Figure 7-32). 

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
182
	
6.	
Run the Heal Selection filter (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Enhance ➤  
Heal Selection). Use the default radius setting of 50 pixels. It did a decent,  
but not perfect, job. You can undo the two previous functions  
(Control + Z twice) and try again, or use the Healing tool (H) to refine the  
results. It will take a little experimentation (Figure 7-33).
Figure 7-32.  Make a selection around the large cracks, to use Heal Selection

Chapter 7 ■ Repairing Moderate and Heavy Damage
183
	
7.	
After touching up the little imperfections and the image is sufficiently cleaned 
up, merge the Clone Layer down (Right-click ➤ Merge Down). I managed to 
repair the background without any additional steps. However, if needed, you can 
smooth out the background by following steps 15–20 in the previous tutorial.
	
8.	
Duplicate the Repair Layer and rename it Teeth/Eyes. Use the Dodge/Burn tool 
(Shift + D) set to Dodge and an exposure of about 15 to gently brighten the teeth 
(Figure 7-34). If the effect is too strong, lower the layer’s opacity.
Figure 7-34.  Use the Dodge/Burn tool to brighten the teeth slightly

9.	
Use the Blur/Sharpen tool (Shift + U) set to Sharpen to very slightly sharpen the 
catch lights in the eyes (Figure 7-35).
	
10.	
Merge the Teeth/Eyes Layer down. Open the Curves dialog (Image Menu ➤ 
Colors ➤ Colors ➤ Curves) and boost the contrast very slightly (Figure 7-36).

This is a tough project. If your results are less than optimal, just try again. Remember, restoration takes 
practice. If your results resemble the example in Figure 7-37, congratulations!

Summary
GIMP is extremely useful for fixing damaged images. The tools at your disposal will let you repair cracks, 
tears, and all types of damage. With time and practice, you’ll be able to salvage images you thought beyond 
hope. If you plan to offer image restoration as part of your professional services, your customers will 
appreciate you all the more!

Retouching Portraits
Even the best of portraits can often benefit from a little digital magic. GIMP is ideal for touch-up work and 
enhancing the best attributes of the photographed subject, while diminishing the distractions that can 
overpower a great image. Imperfections such as wrinkles and crow’s feet can be lessened. Skin can be made 
smoother and more radiant. Dull or yellowing teeth can be digitally brightened and enhanced.
Diminishing Imperfections and Removing Distractions
It’s important to do your retouching as sparingly as possible. When it’s overdone, it will look too artificial. 
Retouching can take a few years away from a portrait’s subject, but trying to make someone in his/her mid-40s  
look 23 might not be the best approach. The objective is to minimize distractions and imperfections and to 
emphasize the best attributes (and maintain the character) of the person in the photograph. It pays to take 
some time to study the image and determine your course of action for the necessary editing.
Figure 8-1 illustrates the distractions and imperfections that are present and a strategy for dealing with 
them, to bring out the best in this image.

Tutorial29: Portrait Retouch 
In the image you are about to retouch, the key is to reduce the severity of the facial issues (seen in Figure 8-1) 
but not to completely eliminate them, to prevent looking like plastic surgery was performed.
The Wavelets Decompose plugin must be installed to follow this tutorial.
To edit this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch8_retouch portrait) located in the Practice Images folder. 
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Retouch Layer.
	
2.	
Create a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and name it Shadow/lFlyaway Hair 
Removal (Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-1.  Take some time to determine your course of action

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
191
	
3.	
Use the Clone tool (C) with the Sample Merged option enabled, to remove the 
stray fly-away hairs on the Shadow/Flyaway Hair Removal layer (Figure 8-3).  
Set the brush size just slightly larger than the hair strand on lone hairs. Increase 
the brush size to remove clusters of hair. 
Figure 8-2.  Creating layers on which to perform retouching tasks

Use the Clone tool (C) to remove the light shadow (and fly-away hairs) on the 
side of the woman’s head. Re-sample often as you work down (Figure 8-4).  
Use athe brush preset name hardnessf 050.

This procedure may give the repaired area a slightly smooth appearance,  
as compared to the surrounding background, when viewing zoomed in.  
If necessary, add a minimum amount of noise (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Noise 
➤ RGB Noise). Uncheck the Correlated noise and Independent RGB options and 
set the noise to the lowest setting of 0.01, then click OK (Figure 8-5).

When the cloning is completed, merge the Clone/Shadow/Flyaway Hair Removal 
layer down. Figure 8-6 reveals an improved image, as a result of the removal of 
the shadow and fly-away hair.

7.	
Now it’s time to do some retouching on the face. Open the Wavelets Decompose 
dialog (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Generic ➤ Wavelets Decompose). Use the 
default option of creating five scales. The Wavelet scales contain varying degrees 
of edge detail (Figure 8-7).

10.	
Click Wavelet scale 4, and reapply the Gaussian Blur (Control + F). The under-eye 
creases are noticeably diminished. The mouth creases look less harsh (Figure 8-9).

Hide the background layer and merge remaining visible layers  
(Merge Visible Layers).
	
13.	
Add a new layer (Shift + Control + N) and change the blend mode to Soft Light. 
	
14.	
Fill the layer with 50% gray, and using the Airbrush tool (A) with the opacity set 
to 15 and white as the active color, paint along the deeper creases in the face and 
neck, to reduce the severity (Figure 8-11).
Figure 8-10.  Areas to be smoothed

Tutorial 30: Brightening Teeth
Over time, our teeth can become dingy and stained from consumption of coffee, wine, tobacco, and various 
other substances. Age is also a factor—most people at the age of 60 don’t have the bright, white smile of an 
18-year-old. Many images can benefit from some digital “cosmetic dentistry.” We’ll see how GIMP will subtly 
brighten and whiten the teeth in Figure 8-14.
Figure 8-13.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
203
As in facial retouching, use a light touch in brightening teeth, or you’ll end up with results that will be 
obvious and appear fake or won’t look right to the people who know the person in the photograph.
To edit this image, follow these steps: 
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch8_brighten teeth) located in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Use the Free Select tool (F) with the Feather Edges radius set to 1.0 and make a 
selection around the teeth (Figure 8-15).
Figure 8-14.  A great smile that can be further enhanced with GIMP

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
204
	
3.	
Copy and paste the selection (Control + C + V) and convert the floating selection 
to a new layer (Shift + Control + N). Rename it Teeth.
	
4.	
Open the Hue-Saturation dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Hue Saturation). 
Select yellow as the primary color and adjust the slider to about -30, then click 
OK. This will reduce some of the yellow just a bit (Figure 8-16). 
Figure 8-15.  Make a selection around the teeth

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
205
	
5.	
Open the Levels dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Levels) and move the midpoint 
slider to the left until the value is about 1.10, then click OK. This will lighten the 
teeth just slightly (Figure 8-17). 
Figure 8-17.  Use the Levels dialog to brighten the teeth slightly
Figure 8-18.  Before and after comparison
We can see in Figure 8-18 that the teeth are noticeably improved, but without the end result being 
overpowering. Subtlety is key when working with the color and brightness in teeth.

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images

Recomposing Images
Recomposing portraits or important photographs is common part of image editing. People become very 
emotionally attached to certain photographs, but they may contain an ugly background or an in-law,  
ex-spouse, or some other unwelcome person or element that the owner of the photograph finds unpleasant.
The two most frequently requested services I receive are replacing backgrounds and removing people 
from portraits. On occasion, I’ll receive a request to add someone to an image.
Recomposing an image consists mainly of covering up unwanted image data with replacement data 
and working with it to create a realistic outcome. The tutorials that follow demonstrate two background 
replacement methods and one involving removing someone from a snapshot.
Replacing Backgrounds
In my line of work as a retouch artist, replacing backgrounds is one of the most frequently requested editing 
services I provide. Sometimes it’s because there’s only one existing photograph of a certain person, and the 
client would like a “studio” version of the image, such as a muslin background behind the subject. Other 
times, the client desires a reimagined version of a photographic scene. Sometimes, it’s just a busy, cluttered, 
and distracting background spoiling the photo.
Tutorial 31: Replacing a Background (No. 1)
The image shown in Figure 8-19 is scanned from a photograph that I shot in 1993 (in the days few people 
could afford Photoshop). It has a great subject, but the elements in the background (the open garage, orange 
road construction barrel, street, etc.) detract from what is otherwise a good portrait.
Figure 8-19.  A cluttered background detracts from an otherwise good image
In the following tutorial, you’ll extract the young woman’s image and place it on a more suitable 
background, resulting in a much better portrait.

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
207
To edit this image, follow these steps: 
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch8_background change 1) located in the Practice Images folder. 
(The image you’ll use as the new background accompanies the practice image.)
	
2.	
Use the Free Select tool (F) to draw a loose outline around the young woman. It’s 
okay to err outside of the edge; that will be refined shortly (Figure 8-20).
Figure 8-20.  Draw a selection around the subject
	
3.	
Switch to the Quick Mask mode (Shift + Q). With black as the active color and  
the brush presetahHardnessf 050, paint along the edge to complete the selection 
(Figure 8-21). Be sure to paint the areas of background that show through the 
hair and between the arm and dress. 

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
208
	
4.	
Deactivate the Quick Mask mode (Shift + Q) to switch back to the  
“marching ant” selection. We’ll now copy the selected subject to its own  
layer (Control + C and Control + V). Change the floating selection to a layer  
(Shift + Control + N). Rename the layer Isolated Girl. 
	
5.	
Hide the Background layer by clicking the Eyeball icon (Figure 8-22). If there 
are any residual pixels left to remove, add a layer mask to the Isolated Girl layer 
(Right-click + Add Layer Mask). Leave the layer mask at the default settings. 
Figure 8-21.  Paint along the edge, to complete the selection

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
209
	
6.	
Using black as the active color, click the layer mask, to make it active, and paint 
on the stray pixels, to make them transparent. 
	
7.	
Open the image we’ll use for the new background (Ch8_sunlight through 
trees). Copy it to the clipboard (Control + C).Paste it as a new layer into the 
project (Image Menu ➤ Edit ➤ Paste As ➤ New Layer). Rename it  
New Background and move it under the Isolated Girl layer (Figure 8-23). 
Figure 8-22.  The isolated subject

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
210
	
8.	
For a more realistic look, the background should not be as sharp the subject.  
Blur it just a bit with the Gaussian Blur dialog, using a radius of 10 pixels  
(Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Blur ➤ Gaussian Blur). 
	
9.	
After blurring, the background looks very smooth when compared to the subject. 
Using the G’MIC plug-in, add some film grain to the New Background layer, to 
create a better match. After experimenting, I preferred the result I got using the 
default settings and checking the Colored grain option (Figure 8-24). 
Figure 8-23.  The new background layer put into place

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images

The end result is a much more aesthetically pleasing portrait. A different background can make a huge 
difference (Figure 8-25).

Tutorial 32: Replacing a Background (No. 2)
The image shown in Figure 8-26 is actually a decent portrait. Most people would probably like it as is, but 
sometimes customers will request something a little more stylish, such as a muslin studio-style background. 
This young woman has some tight curls in her hair, so this tutorial will involve a little more refinement than 
the previous one.
Figure 8-26.  A portrait that will receive a studio-style replacement background
To edit this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch8_new background) located in the Practice Images folder. 
(The image you’ll use as the new background accompanies the practice image.) 
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer twice. Rename the uppermost layer Edit Layer 
(Figure 8-27).

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
213
	
3.	
Add a transparency (in the form of an alpha channel) to the Edit Layer  
(Image Menu ➤ Layer ➤ Transparency ➤ Add Alpha Channel). 
	
4.	
Open the Threshold dialog (Image Menu ➤ Colors ➤ Threshold). Leave the 
slider at the default setting (Figure 8-28).

Removing People
As mentioned previously, clients will often request having someone digitally removed from a treasured 
photograph. This task is basically just a matter of borrowing image data from one part of the picture to cover 
up the person to be taken out of the image.
Tutorial 33: Removing a Person
The example in Figure 8-35 is a Polaroid photograph of my late brother, Glenn, taken in the late 1980s 
or early 1990s. I’ve always loved this picture, because it shows a rarely seen playful aspect of Glenn’s 
personality. I don’t have many photos of him by himself, so I decided to edit this one, so that I can now have 
one of my favorite ones (and it makes a great tutorial).

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
221
To edit this image, follow these steps: 
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch8_remove girl) located in the Practice Images folder.
	
2.	
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Edit Layer (Figure 8-36).

Using the Free Select tool (F) and the Feather Edges radius set to 10 pixels, draw a 
selection around the area on the right side of the image (Figure 8-37).

Chapter 8 ■ Editing Portraits and Recomposing Images 
222
	
4.	
Copy and paste (Control + C and Control + V) as a floating selection. Change 
the floating selection into a new layer (Shift + Control + N). Expand the layer’s 
boundary size to match to the image size (Image Menu ➤ Layer ➤ Layer to 
Image Size). Rename the layer Patch 1). 
	
5.	
Use the Move tool (M) to move the patch over the woman’s face. Some of it will 
cover part of the man’s hair and sombrero, but that’s okay for now (Figure 8-38).

the left, to lighten the patch layer slightly and create a better tonal match. The 
value should be around 230 (Figure 8-39).

Note
■
■
  Normally, I crop images earlier in the editing process, but in a case such as this, it’s necessary to  
borrow from other parts of the image to cover the object or person to be removed. Leave as much image  
information available as possible for this purpose, then crop the image after the editing has been done.
Careful patching and cloning results in a very nice edited snapshot and a plausible image (Figure 8-46). 
Summary
GIMP is a very useful program for correcting flaws and retouching portraits, so that people can look their best. 
It’s great for isolating people (or pets, for that matter) and digitally replacing backgrounds and changing scenery. 
With GIMP, you’ll be able to remove unwanted people or objects from images and end up with great results.

Sharpening—The Final Step
In many instances, the images you work with will benefit from a little sharpening. After you complete your 
retouching/restoration steps, sharpening should be the final step in the editing process. Images are also 
generally sharpened after downscaling (such as those being prepared for use on the Web). This process will 
not correct images that are out of focus and blurry, but it will improve images that are slightly soft, such as 
scanned photographs. Some scanners employ an auto-sharping feature, which may provide satisfactory 
results. However, to exercise more control over the sharpening process, the auto-feature should be disabled. 
Figure 9-1 shows an example of how a scanned photograph can be improved with just a slight amount of 
sharpening. Notice how the catchlights in the eyes are just a bit crisper and brighter.

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
232
The Unsharp Mask Filter
This filter’s name sounds counterintuitive to making an image look sharper, but it’s derived from a 
photographic process that uses a blurred, or “unsharp,” mask of the original positive image. This mask is 
combined with the negative image, creating a result that has greater apparent sharpness.
The Unsharp Mask filter increases contrast between neighboring dark and light pixels, which in 
actuality creates the illusion of increased sharpness.
The Unsharp Mask dialog is nested within the filters (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Enhance ➤  
Unsharp Mask). There are three setting options in the dialog: Radius, Amount, and Threshold (Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-1.  Before and after example of a scanned photograph slightly sharpened

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
233
	
1.	
Radius. The slider and input boxes (0.1–120) determine how many pixels on 
either side of an edge are affected by sharpening.
	
2.	
Amount. The slider and input boxes (0.00–5.00) determine the intensity of the 
sharpening effect.
	
3.	
Threshold. This allows you to protect areas that are similar in tone from 
sharpening. Areas of smooth tonal transition can be protected from sharpening, 
minimizing the creation of unwanted blemishes or artifacts.
The main disadvantage of using the Unsharp Mask filter is that the effect can accentuate film grain 
and digital noise and create unsightly artifacts around the edges in the image (Figure 9-3). This filter can 
be somewhat destructive, so I recommend applying it with a light touch. Always work on a duplicate of the 
background layer. If the sharpening effect is too strong, you can lower the layer’s opacity to reduce the effect.
Figure 9-2.  The setting options in the Unsharp Mask dialog

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
234
High Pass Sharpening
The High Pass method sharpens an image’s edges without affecting the area between them. This is generally 
considered a better way to sharpen images than Unsharp Mask, at least in certain instances.
Tutorial 34: Sharpening Using the High Pass Filter
In this tutorial, you’ll sharpen the image of the baby, using the High Pass technique. The G’MIC plug-in must 
be installed for this lesson.
To sharpen this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the picture of the baby (Ch9_baby) found in the Practice Images folder. 
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Sharpen (Figure 9-4).
Figure 9-3.  The results of over-sharpening an image

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
235
	
2.	
Apply the High Pass filter (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ G’MIC). 
	
3.	
Click the triangle (or + sign) next to Details to open the available options and 
select High Pass. Adjust the Radius to 4.00 and leave the Contrast setting at 2.00 
(Figure 9-5).
Figure 9-5.  Applying the High Pass filter
Figure 9-4.  A duplicate layer created to use the High Pass sharpen technique on

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
236
The High Pass method of sharpening is generally very effective yet gentle, so the destructive effects are 
kept to a minimum. Although the difference is subtle, the image has more snap, compared to the original 
(Figure 9-8).
Figure 9-7.  The appearance of sharpness is enhanced
Figure 9-6.  The High Pass filter emphasizes the edges of the image
	
5.	
Change the Blend Mode of the Sharpen layer to Overlay (Figure 9-7). This will 
slightly boost the contrast of the edges, improving the appearance of sharpness 
without accentuating the film grain.

Emboss Sharpening
This technique is effective on images that are soft or slightly out of focus. It won’t necessarily achieve 
perfection, but it can make a huge improvement. The image of the coat of arms is a bit soft, due to some 
slight camera shake (Figure 9-9).
Figure 9-8.  Before and after comparison

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images

Tutorial 35: Sharpening Using the Emboss Filter
The following sharpening technique will help restore some of the texture in the stone and accentuate the 
details of the coat of arms.
To sharpen this image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch9_coat-of-arms) found in the Practice Images folder. 
Duplicate the background layer and rename it Sharpen (Figure 9-10).
Figure 9-9.  This focus on this image is a bit soft

settings (Figure 9-11).

This technique of sharpening can be very effective in many cases. As long as the image isn’t too soft, the 
detail can be noticeably enhanced, as we can see in Figure 9-14.

Chapter 9 ■ Sharpening Images
243
Summary
Images can often benefit from a light application of the Unsharp Mask filter; however, it can accentuate 
film grain, digital noise, and, when overused, create unwanted artifacts around edges. For a gentler type of 
sharpening, the High Pass method enhances the edges of the image without overaccentuating film grain or 
digital noise. Images that are slightly soft or out of focus can be improved by using the Emboss technique. 
The relief effect helps recover lost texture and detail.

Turn Photos into Digital Works of Art
GIMP offers a number of filters that can turn your images into digital works of art. Image retouching and 
restoration can be tedious and difficult work at times, so this can be a fun way to work with your images.  
You can experiment to your heart’s content without the messiness of actual paints, brushes, or inks.
For the professional retoucher, converting photographs into digital art can be an added service to offer 
to clients. For the hobbyist, it can be a fun and creative way to make gifts for family and friends, or even 
spruce up decor.
Figure 10-1 illustrates two different artistic filters applied to the photograph of the Mill Mountain Star: 
Photocopy (center) and Predator (bottom).

Chapter 10 ■ Fun and Artistic Projects with Your Photos 
246
The artistic filters are nested in GIMP’s Filters (Image Menu ➤ Filters ➤ Artistic). You can control 
various parameters of the filter. For example, when converting an image to a digital oil painting using the 
Oilify filter, you can control how detailed it appears. Increasing the mask gives it more of a “painterly” look 
(Figure 10-2).

Add Artistic Functionality with G’MIC
The G’MIC plug-in (which we looked at in the Introduction) offers a ton of options for adding artistic 
effects. It’s well worth taking the time to become familiar with it, to bring out your “inner artist,” especially 
if traditional art materials aren’t your strong suit. G’MIC is available from www.gmic.sourceforge.net. The 
image in Figure 10-4 was converted into a digital pen-and-ink style drawing, by using the Pen Drawing filter 
nested within the G’MIC filters.

Art Project No. 1: Salvaging “Unfixable” Photos
Some of your photos may have focus issues that can’t be repaired in the conventional sense of image editing. 
The example in Figure 10-5 is one of many photographs I shot in New Orleans in 1993. Most of them turned 
out fine, but as you can imagine, I was very disappointed at how out of focus this one turned out.

It won’t be possible to get a good photograph from this image. Even the Unsharp Mask filter can’t 
make much of an improvement; there’s just no sharp detail to rescue. Although it’s not a usable image as a 
photograph, it does have potential as digital art. If you’d like to give this technique a try, this image  
(Ch10_blurry girl) is located in the Practice Images folder. Then try it on some of your own images. Of 
course, this technique doesn’t have to be limited to out-of-focus images. Use it on any of your favorite 
pictures that would look great as digital art.
You must have the G’MIC plug-in installed for this exercise.
	
1.	
Open the image (Ch10_blurry girl) and apply the Rodilius filter (Image Menu ➤ 
Filters ➤ G’MIC).
	
2.	
With the G’MIC dialog box open, click the small triangle (or + sign on Windows) 
next to the Artistic option (Figure 10-6).

other options at their default settings (Figure 10-7).

Chapter 10 ■ Fun and Artistic Projects with Your Photos 
252
The end result is an image that is quite usable as digital art. Of course, my preference would be a 
photograph that is sharp and in focus. Because that isn’t possible, I was able to preserve the essence of the 
original image that (I think) many would find an acceptable and pleasing alternative (Figure 10-8).
Figure 10-7.  Applying the Rodilius filter

Chapter 10 ■ Fun and Artistic Projects with Your Photos 
253
After trying this on your own photographs, experiment with different filters. Because art is subjective, 
you might not like the results from using the Rodilius filter and would prefer a different style. If you have 
similar photos that can’t be saved by conventional restoration, this might be the ticket to salvage those 
less-than-perfect images. If you like the results, you can enlarge the image and have it framed, or printed on 
canvas at your local photo lab or by an online service (Figure 10-9).

Creating Collages
With some imagination, you can assemble your photos into themed collages. A collage can be the perfect 
gift for sentimental family members (or family members that are hard to find gifts for for). Collages don’t 
necessarily have to be themed. They can be composed of your favorite family photographs. The following 
example (Figure 10-10) was well received by my now deceased father-in-law as a Christmas present. The 
images in the collage span the time from his wedding day to his 80th birthday.

Open the Text tool (T) and, using the URW Chancery L Medium font,  
set at 200 pixels and type “Scotland 2012”.
Don’t worry if your results don’t exactly match the example. The idea is to get a feel for the process.  
If you get to a point where you make collages on a regular basis, you’ll likely develop your own style. You 
can also visit online services that offer predesigned templates for collages. One such service is Collage.com 
(www.collage.com). Log on to see the options offered.
Summary
GIMP is not only useful for image retouching and restoration, it also offers many filters for creating works 
of art from photos. The G’MIC plug-in expands the options of artistic filters, offering literally hundreds to 
choose from. You can give photographs that are out of focus and can’t otherwise be repaired new life as 
works of art, by utilizing one of the many filters that capture the essence of the image—the next best thing to 
actually repairing it. Any of your favorite photographs are good candidates for conversion to digital art.
Assembling collages is a fun way to display your images. You can create themed collages to 
commemorate special events, or a collage can be a collection of your favorite photos from past to present. 
Collages make great gifts for sentimental family members, and most will appreciate them.

Photo-Quality Printers
Photo-quality printers have come a long way from the first-generation models that were around in the 
early 1990s. The output quality rivals that of traditional photo lab prints. The prints produced from those 
early models (particularly ink-jet printers) were prone to rapid fading—sometimes in a matter of months. 
Obviously, you want your prints to be the best quality available, as well as to last for generations. This is 
especially important when providing your services to paying customers.
Ink-Jet Printers
Photo-quality ink-jet printers have advanced by leaps and bounds over the years. The papers and inks used 
by modern printers are capable of producing beautiful, high-resolution images (Figure 11-1). Ink-jet printers 
spray on paper micro-sized dots that make up the image. The dots are only visible when the image is greatly 
magnified, not when viewing a print with the unaided eye.

Chapter 11 ■ Printing and Preserving Your Images 
260
Ink-jet printers are designed to use one of two types of ink: dye-based or pigment-based. Most models use 
dye-based inks, but there are some high-end models geared toward the professional that use pigment-based 
inks to produce archival-quality prints that are rated to last about 200 years when framed under glass and 
displayed under normal lighting conditions. Even some models using dye-based inks (when combined with 
the paper it’s formulated for) will produce prints that are rated to last for about 75–100 years under the same 
conditions.
Desktop photo-quality ink-jet printers are available in small models that print 4" × 6" images to  
large-format models that produce prints up to 13" × 19". While general-purpose ink-jet printers use four ink 
colors (CMYK), dedicated photo-quality printers use (depending on the manufacturer) colors such as red, 
orange, green, and variations of black. This offers the widest color gamut possible. There are a variety of 
photo-quality ink-jet papers available, such as gloss, semigloss, and matte (flat). Most photo-quality printers 
are designed to use their own brand of inks and paper, for the best results and maximum life span.
One of the main disadvantages of ink-jet prints is that they are generally not very water-resistant, so they 
must be kept dry. Even a single drop can ruin a print.
Dye-Sublimation Printers
Dye-sublimation (also known as dye-sub) printers have been around for a while and are commonly used 
in digital photo labs. They work by using a thermal process to transfer dye contained on a ribbon to the 
surface of the paper. Dye-sublimation printers produce very high-quality prints that are continuous in tone 
and more water-resistant than ink-jet prints. One disadvantage of dye-sublimation printers is that they 
are usually limited to glossy paper and only print up to 8" × 10" (with the exception of some wide-format 
commercial models costing thousands of dollars). Another is that the paper and ink ribbons they require are 
expensive, compared to their ink-jet counterparts.
Dye-sublimation printers have made their way into the consumer market in recent years and are well 
worth looking at while conducting your research, if you are considering which type of printer to buy.  
Either type will produce high-quality prints—which type to choose will depend on your particular needs 
(and print longevity should be considered as well).

  Log on to the Wilhelm Imaging Research web site (www.wilhelm-research.com) for data concerning 
the longevity performance of various printer and paper manufacturers.
Protecting and Preserving Your Prints
After you’ve gone through the hard work of editing your image (or possibly many images), you will probably 
be highly motivated to protect your newly printed pictures (as well as your original photographic materials) 
from potential harm. Many of the images you restored may have been damaged, because they were kept in 
catchall boxes, drawers, or other places where miscellaneous household objects are stored. Others may have 
faded, because they were displayed in frames and exposed to UV light over the years. Proper archiving will 
avoid those mishaps from occurring again.
Archiving Your Prints
There are many products available to archive your prints (as well as negatives and slides): acid-free sleeves 
for three-ring binders (Figure 11-2), storage boxes, and albums are some examples. These products can be 
purchased at your local camera shop or an online supplier such as B&H Photo (www.bhphotovideo.com).
Figure 11-2.  Photo archival sleeve for use in a three-ring binder

Chapter 11 ■ Printing and Preserving Your Images 
262
Cheap photo albums with “magnetic” pages should be avoided; they use a thin layer of tacky adhesive 
to secure the photograph on the album page. The materials used in the album may damage the photos over 
time. In Figure 11-3, you can see a page that is deteriorating in an album purchased in the early 1990s.  
There is also a risk the photos will eventually be permanently stuck to the page.
After archiving your photographic materials, make sure they are stored in a cool, dark place with low 
humidly. Avoid keeping them in places with temperature extremes, such as attics and garages, as these are 
prime breeding grounds for mold and fungus.
It’s a good idea to make sure that all of your photographic materials are digitized as well as archived.  
It can be a big job if your prints, negatives, and slides number in the hundreds or thousands, but it’s well 
worth the time and effort to preserve your family history. It can be a long-term project; it doesn’t have to be 
done all at once.
Displaying Your Prints
For the new prints you want to display, a good-quality frame using acid-free materials is important. Like 
cheap photo albums, poor-quality materials in frames can be destructive. The ink-jet print image in 
Figure 11-4 began to discolor along the bottom in a few short years, because the mat the print came in 
contact with was of poor quality.

It’s obvious that for important prints, cheap frames from the discount store should be avoided. Your 
local custom frame shop can provide frames that use high-quality materials. Many have UV-resistant glass 
that will help extend print longevity.
For an added layer of protection, special spray lacquers formulated for ink-jet prints are available that 
protect the image from UV light, dirt, moisture, and other contaminants. They are available in gloss, satin, 
and matte, to match the type of paper your pictures are printed on.
If you use a spray lacquer, read the directions carefully and follow all of the safety instructions. Use in 
well-ventilated areas and keep away from open flames.
Storing Images Digitally
It’s important to exercise the same care in the storage of your digital images that you would extend to the 
printed versions. They serve the same purpose as negatives do in relation to traditional photographs; they 
are backup copies. The images currently on your computer should be backed up as soon as possible, either 
to an external hard drive (Figure 11-5), flash drive, or disk, such as a CD-ROM or DVD. For maximum 
protection, consider using all three.

Chapter 11 ■ Printing and Preserving Your Images 
264
It’s a good idea to keep your digitally archived images stored in multiple locations. You can keep extra 
copies on a CD-ROM, DVD, flash drive, or external hard drive in a safe-deposit box or with a trusted family 
member. If the unthinkable, such as a fire, flood, or other disaster, occurs, at least you’ll have copies of your 
treasured memories preserved.
There is also the option of online data storage services (commonly referred to as the “cloud”). These 
services have become popular in the past several years. There are a couple of noteworthy benefits, such as 
the ability to share your photos anytime and anywhere you have Internet access. Also, they routinely back 
up their data, so the risk of loss is small. However, I personally wouldn’t feel entirely comfortable storing my 
images on a cloud service exclusively. If you choose to use the cloud, I recommend using at least one other 
method of storing your images.
Follow the same guidelines for storing electronic media as you would photographic materials—protect 
your external hard drives, flash drives, and disks from temperature extremes and high humidity. Keep disks 
safe and organized in archival sleeves or storage boxes.
How Long Will Digital Images Last?
It would seem logical to assume that digital images will last forever, but it’s not necessarily that simple.  
The digital storage devices of today might very well be obsolete in the not too distant future. Optical disks, 
such as the CD-ROM and DVD, could suffer the same fate as VHS tapes. Even if there are devices that can 
read them 20, 30, or 40 years from now, the data might become corrupted over time.
It will likely be a matter of migrating your images to the most current storage devices every few years. 
If you have images stored on an older external hard drive, you might consider transferring them to one of 
the newer, solid-state models (the data should be accessed about every six months, to avoid potential loss). 
Images that are stored on old CDs (from the late 1990s or early 2000s) should be transferred to newer disks. 
(There are archival-quality disks available that are estimated to last up to 300 years.)
If you have images stored in an online cloud service, what would happen if the company went out of 
business? Or if your photos were accidentally deleted? I wouldn’t bet that it couldn’t happen (it probably 
already has). The expression “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” comes to mind.

Video Montages
One added benefit of digitizing your images is they can be assembled into a video montage, using slide 
show software . In addition to paid programs, there are a number of free titles available that allow you to 
add transitions and music. Figure 11-6 is an example of a free program for Linux called PhotoFilmStrip. 
(There are also free programs for Windows and Mac systems.) It’s more convenient than flipping through a 
photo album. The production can be put onto a disk, such as a DVD, or uploaded to mobile devices. For the 
professional retoucher, this can be a great add-on service to provide. Customers will often purchase multiple 
copies on disk to give as gifts.

Chapter 11 ■ Printing and Preserving Your Images 
266
Summary
In this chapter, I covered the attributes of photo-quality printers, as well as the expected longevity of images 
printed using archival paper and ink. Storing and displaying prints properly is important for long-term 
preservation. Environments having high humidity and temperature extremes should be avoided. Cheap 
photo albums and picture frames can potentially damage your images. Storage sleeves, boxes, albums, and 
frames should be made of high-quality, acid-free materials.
It’s equally important to exercise great care in storing digital images. Keeping them on various types of 
storage devices and media such as CD-ROMs or DVDs will help protect against loss. This is especially true 
when copies are kept “off-site,” such as in a safe-deposit box, with a trusted relative, or online storage service.
Migrating your digital images to current storage devices every few years can help “future proof” them, 
should the current technology become obsolete and unavailable to access your images years from now.
Using software to create video montages is a great way to share images with family members and can be 
a great add-on service for the professional retoucher.
Closing Thoughts
I hope you’ve enjoyed working on the tutorials, and that you learned a lot from this book. You can take  
what you’ve learned and apply them to your own images. Each new image you edit will probably require 
some experimentation, but the techniques outlined in this publication should take a great deal of the  
trial-and-error out of the process.
Just remember to keep learning and keep practicing!

About the Author
Phillip Whitt is a professional digital retoucher and restoration artist, as 
well as a film-to-video transfer technician. His love for everything related 
to photography began when he was ten years old. His favorite aunt gave 
him her old Kodak Brownie camera, and from the joy of seeing his first 
developed photographs, a new hobby was born. His foray into digital 
image editing began in the 1990s with the purchase of his first flatbed 
scanner, which came bundled with a basic image-editing program. Fixing 
a few family photographs soon led to a new passion and profession that 
he continues to enjoy to this day. 
Mr. Whitt has digitally edited countless photos and served a number 
of professional clients, such as photographers, photo labs, and camera 
outlets, over the years.
