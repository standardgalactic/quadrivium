TIMBER DECKING  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Careful measuring and cutting is required when constructing 
a timber deck. It would be helpful to have an assistant for 
some stages of the work. 
  
 
 
Wear work gloves to avoid splinters, and safety goggles to 
protect eyes when using power tools. Dispose of treated 
wood off-cuts as ordinary household waste. Treated wood 
should not be burned in open fires, barbecues, stoves or 
fireplaces. Avoid inhaling sawdust. 
  
Pre-treated wood is perfectly safe and poses no risk to 
people, animals and plants, and is safe enough for children 
to play on. 
  
 
 
Timber decks offer a natural and attractive outdoor living 
space for dining, entertaining or simply relaxing. 
  
For an alternative to a patio, a timber deck is a useful 
addition to your garden. Design and construction is relatively
easy - all you need to do is construct a frame from joists and
add deckboards to create a flat patio. Additional posts, 
handrails and spindles create the complete deck look.

Decide on the shape and size 
of your deck - deck boards 
can be laid in a number of 
different ways and more 
ambitious deck shapes are 
possible: the only limit is 
your ingenuity. It is 
important that you decide on 
the deckboard layout before 
assembling the support joists 
as some patterns will affect 
the spacing and number of 
joists, for example a double 
joist will be needed for a 
chevron style layout.  
 
Mark out the area to be 
occupied by your deck with 
wooden pegs and string: this will help you to visualise the 
size of the finished deck and serve as a guide for preparing 
the site. If the site you have chosen is lawned, then it is 
recommended that the turfs are removed and the site is 
level. 
 
 
 
You can prevent the growth of unwanted vegetation under 
your deck by covering bare ground with black plastic 
sheeting, followed by gravel.  
 
3  - Creating the frame  
Deck boards can be laid out in a number 
of ways. It is important that you decide 
on the deckboard layout before 
assembling the support joists as some 
patterns will affect the spacing and 
number of joists, for example a double 
joist will be needed for a chevron style 
layout. 
 
 
 
Step 1: Cut the joists (Diagram 3 - A) that will form the sides 
of the deck to the size you require. 
 
Step 2: Mark the position of the floor joists (Diagram 3 - B) at
400mm intervals.

posts to the inside of the 
joists.  
 

Step 3: Measure the d
between the two post 
positions and cut the top an
bottom handrails (Diagram

Step 4: Measure the length 
of the spindles to fit between 
the top and bottom handrails 
and cut to size to allow the 
top handrails to be 900mm 
above the finished deck 
surface, and bottom rails 
75mm above the deck. 
 
Fix the spindles at 100mm

As an alternative, you can 
create railings without the 
use of a bottom rail. Posts 
and top rails are assembled 
and fixed as before. The 
spindles are then fixed with 
screws to the rail and the 
deck after the deck boards 
have been fitted. 
 
 
 
Make sure that the height of 
the top rail from the finished 
deck is exactly that of the 
spindles you have bought, if 
you don't want to cut them.  
 
You can also make railings 
using deck boards and infills. 
 
 
 
Step 6: Finish the posts by 
adding a screw-on ball top. 
 
Step 7: When all the post-
and-rail assemblies have 
been fitted, complete your 
deck by fixing the deck 
boards.  
 
 
 
Off-cuts of joists should be 
used to provide additional 
support for posts and 
subsequent decking boards 
around the posts.

of the deck boards. For best 
results the corners of these 
fascia boards can be mitred.
