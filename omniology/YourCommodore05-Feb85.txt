COMMENT
H e e * *  editor's warning
about computers that talk too
much.
have a dream. Well, it's more of a
nightmare really. I  am awoken in the
morning by my alarm clock but instead of
an insistant and irritating buzz i t  is
programmed to rouse me from sleep in
sweet and pleasant tones. I  abuse it
soundly. No longer do I drive to work in a
grumpy and half-awake silence. Instead. I
have to listen to the prattle of my car as it
asks how I slept, what sort of evening I
spent (I was talked at by the cathode ray
tube) and what I ate for breakfast. My
word-processor is so called because it
talks all day. Its vocabulary is larger than
mine (no cheap jokes please), My entire
day is spent listening to an artiﬁcially
intelligent babble.
It's started already, of course, and with
the Commodore 64. We all know that the
64 has one of the best sound generating
chips o f  any computer on the home
market. Soon it may never tire of telling us
so. However for the moment it is still
ﬁnding its voice.
So, what are the tell-tale signs, the ﬁrst
faltering syllablet? Not Mummy or Daddy,
oh no, but "He slimed me" and "Destroy
him my robots!". These immortal words
appear on two of the best games on the
market at the moment, Ghostbusters and
Impossible Mission. Soon all computer
games won't just be doing the nasty stutt
to you but recounting all the gory details
as well.
Fortunately, we do still have some
control over the micro mouth. Speech
synthesizers may be the computer's voice
box but for the time being we tell them
what to say. Our review of those speech
synthesizers in this issue will show you
how your 64 is already loosening up its
larynx. Be warned.
Now, you're probably saying that I'm
slightly paranoid. It's fun to hear your
computer talk , t o  create different
characters in your games and far more
friendly to be told by your computer to do
something rather than to read it on the
screen. But already from America we hear
stories of automatic doors expressing the
wish that those who pass through them
will have a nice day, now'. When I'm in
the habit of talking to doors, I shall be
grateful for the greeting.
Of course, my tongue is in my cheek.
Better that than to be tongue tied by a
talking computer. It might just not be the
ghost in the machine which has the last
laugh (see Ghost busters) but the machine
itself!
And what of my dream? Like all such
visions it passes at the ﬁrst sound of the
alarm clock. I shout at the clock. After all,
it is one of those new voice recognition
ones.
Your comment
We're overwhelmed. By what? By you, of
course. We called for reviewers and you
answered, in your hundreds. We asked
for your comments and you sent them to
us. Not everyone could be a reviewer,
unfortunately, there's just not enough
software to go round. But we read all the
reviews a n d  enjoyed them all; t h e
standard was so high that it made the task
of choosing almost impossible. I f  you
haven't heard yet, please bear with us as
we're still trying to let everyone know
whether they have been accepted.
Similarly, if you've written to us about
the magazine, or with a problem or just
about C ommodor e c omputing i n
general, we haven't forgotten you. It may
be some time before we get round to
replying but you can be sure that we have
taken note of what you have to say. For
example, Derren Nugent o f  Swindon
writes: "By the way, could you print one
or two C16 programs in your stunning
mag...P.S. Your magazine is probably the
best, most economical and informative
mag for Commodore users...." I don't
know about the 'probably', but how
could w e  refuse a  request lik e that.

Let your 64 answer
back with some sound
advice from David
Crisp.
THE CURRAH SPEECH UNIT IS
a small black box which plugs
into the cartridge port of your
Commodore with a ﬁve pin
DIN plug which then plugs into
the audio/video socket. Two
problems arise from the above
arrangement, First if you use a
Commodore monitor  t h e n
your audio/video socket is in
use and you would ﬁrst need
to wire the speech unit into
the monitor  plug. N o t  a
fantastic alternative as  this
means that your speech unit is
permanently attached to the
monitor . I t  i s  n o t  a n
insurmountable problem but
will require a bit of work with
cutters and a soldering iron.
The second problem arises if
you have an SX-64. This once
again needs  cutters and a
soldering ir on. T h e  audio
v ideo s o c k e t  a n d  t h e
cartridge port are a few inches
further away on the SX and so it
is necessary t o  splice in  a
couple of inches of extra wire
between the plug and speech
unit in order to plug it tn. It is
only a coupleof inches but still
a nuisance. I f  y ou have a
standard 64 and use a TV as
opposed to a monitor then it is
a simple plug in job and this will
apply to the majority so, in
most cases, the above is not
relevant.
Once it is pit. •wed in it is
very easy to use. I had my ﬁve
year old daughter using it in
ust a  c ouple o f  minutes.
Before now the only speech
units I had used were for the
Spectrum and the BBC and to
activate them it was necessary
to look u p  the sounds you
wanted t o  say, n o t e  t h e
number o f  t he sound, and
then put them into some form
of a list. What appeared on
screen was simply a  list o f
meaningless numbers which
was heirs own job to edit into a
reasonable sound. Not lik e
that with the Currah. First you
6 ac tiv ate t he unit by  typing
INIT, then to make it talk you
simply type SAY" THE WORDS
YOU REQUIRE" and to turn it
off you type KOFF. It really isac
easy as that. Those commands
SPEAKER'S
CORNER
can be put into a program or
used as direct commands.
Talk to Me
If y ou ty pe i n  as a direc t
command INIT the speech
unit will SAY the letters that
you type from the keyboard.
All w e r e  unders tandable
except for  t he return k ey
which to me sounded lik e a
muppet w i t h  a  s p e e c h
impediment saying WRITTEN.
And why, oh why, thedreaded
American ZEEE when I am sure
most people in this country say
ZED. Those things apart it was
smashing. It is a Robotic voice
and not human sounding but is
still very easy to understand.
There are two voices one high
and one low and intonation is
possible but not quite so easy
to get right. A  very clever
piece of programming has put
Rules of speech into the unit
and in the majority of cases it
works exceptionally well. By
rules of speech I mean that if
you ty pe SAY "MEEN" and
then SAY "MEAN" they both
sound t h e  s ame (as  they
should). Very clever that, and
effective. Currah say the way
toget the most realistic sounds
is t o extend the basic SAY
command t o  include mne-
monics for particular sounds. It
does work but I found it easier
to write the word as it sounds
e.g. To say Hawaii they suggest
typing SAY "haw(ii)(ee)". This
works very well but I found
SAY 'HUYE 'faster and easier to
work out with almost asgood a
result. This only goes to show
how versatile this unit is. There
is a speech buffer which holds
about thirty seconds worth of
speech w hic h means  t h e
program can carry on while
speech is  output. I t  is  also
possible to program the unit
through m a c h i n e  c o d e .
Currah say it is difﬁcult and so I
tried. Believe me it is. It is so
easy to use through BASIC it
would be easier to exit from
the coded program, return to
BASIC, say what you have to
and then return to code.
To sum up then, this unit is
very easy to use and easy to get

H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w

good results from. How useful
or educational t o  i t  is , is
difﬁcult t o  say but without
doubt it is a lot of fun. I keep
plugging i t  i n  a n d  having
another bash.
All the speech units I have
heard have been male voices.
I would like to hear one with a
female voice.
lamar Speakeasy
Another speech unit has just
arrived and this one is made by
a Yorkshire company. T he
Jamar Spea k easy is  a  s elf
contained box which, in the
case of the 64, is plumed into
the user port. It is claimed to
be compatible with a long list
of machines (see list at end)
with t h e  relevant interface
cable. It is a two tone grey box
with a built in spea ker and has
a slightly cheap plasticky feel.
On my  review module the
spea ker grille was messy as
many o f  t h e  s lots  w e r e
gummed u p  with resin. The
interface cable was a short
piece of ribbon cable with an
IDC type connector at one
end. The other end was a plug
to match the user port. This
plug was meant for  Chassis
Mounting and so the wires of
the ribbon were exposed. It is
possible to get covered plugs
and so I cannot see why the
correct plug has not been
used. This is a small point but
reﬂects t h e  general c heap
ﬁnish of the unit.
Back to the book
Before I plugged the module
in I did, as always, fully read the
instruction manual. The very
small pr int and t h e  c heap
paper p u t  m e  o f f  b u t  I
persevered. Horror of horrors
this unit requires a mass of
meaningless numbers in order
toget anything out of it. On the
Currah unit to say 'Computer'
you ty pe SAY"COMPUTER"
however on the Jamar unit you
type "8,24,16,9,49,31,13,52,4".
Which d o  you prefer. I
soon made u p  my  mind. I
eventually forced myself to
plug in this unit and blast away.
It was ﬁrst required that a short
program was typed in to set the
speech unit up. This done, I
typed in a few of the numbers
needed to ma ke it say simple
words. Chatter away it did and
another few numbers made a
few mor e words. After the
ease with which it was possible
to get the Currah going, this
number method became a
deﬁnite b o r e .  Constantly
referring to the manual for the
appropriate number to say the
sound i s  a  lo n g  w in d e d
procedure. I k now that not
long ago the numeric way was
the only way toget speech out,
But the Currah shows that this
is no longer the case. I tried to
ma ke up new words which
were not in the manual. It can
be done but believe me it
does t a  ke a  l o n g  t i m e
Because there is no meaning
to the numbers I feel that it
would ev en b e  difﬁcult t o
learn which number made the
appropriate sound even with a
lot of use.
Talking OK
All said and done, the quality
of the speech was OK. Quite
good in fact but still not good
enough to ma ke mego for this
one as opposed to the Currah.
The manual and the ﬁnish are
not a patch on the Currah and
at least the Currah did work
ﬁrst time. (The ﬁrst Jamar did
not work and so I had to wait
for a replacement).
The Lamar unit costs about
15 mor e than t h e  Currah
unit and you still need to pay
another £4.50 for the interface
lead. So in the end you pay CIO
more for a less desirable unit.
The following appraisal is  a
comparison between the two
units.

Off the record
TWO BIG RECORD COMPANIES ARE
making a song and dance about entering
the software market, They are CBS and
Ariolasoft which is connected to Arista
Records. T h e  initial pus h f o r  b o t h
companies is for the Commodore 64. For
the t ime  being, however, they  ar e
importing existing software from the US.
CBS have started rather modestly with
Et titles eg, Breakdance based on the latest
dancing craze, and Impossible Mission,
an arcade, adventure, strategy game of
mind-boggling complexity — and it's got
brilliant graphics. A l l  ar e fr om Epyx
(who are famous for Summer Games) and
more of their titles are to follow.
There was nothing modest about
N e w s
Ariolasoft's launch. They  hir ed t he
Hippodrome in London's West End for
the night to tell the world about their ﬁrst
twelve titles. All imports again but they
include at least two US Number Ones.
Some are now getting a bit long in the
tooth, like Lode Runner but the selection
does include some brilliant games.
Fortunately, neither company rules
out t h e  possibility o f  commissioning
home-grown software and with their
funds and knowledge of a very similar
market they look  assured o f  success.
Whether other software houses will be
dancing to their tune in the near future
remains to be seen.

must unravel the mystery, discover the
threat to civilisation, ﬁnd a solution and
cope with the professor.
This game is littered with a selection of
interesting characters apart fr om the

Taskset go to war
TASKSET LTD. HAVE INCORPORATED
8,192 screen locations into their latest
game — Cadcam Warrior. The aim of the
game is to ﬁnd your way to Cadcam
Control, t he centre o f  this machine
generated environment. The player must
destroy his opponents and clear all the
obstacles the computer has put in his way
as quickly as possible. If the player does
well, he may leap ahead to a further
location rather than the next logical
location, thus making each game slightly
different from the previous one.
The game will be accompanied by a
booklet including maps and information.
It is expected to retail at £9.95 on cassette
and 02.95 on disc.

for your 64
Computers, like people, are fallible. They need the right
combination of code and care to perform effectively in the
business or the home. And that requires ﬁrst hand knowledge
from you to create a healthy operating environment for your
Corn modore 64.
Knowledge about machine language, about the lesser known
qualities of the 64, about the disc drives, graphics, and about the
tricks and tips to keep your 64 on line. That's why First Publishing
has now launched in the UK a series of high quality books and
software packages to provide a complete health care kit for your
64. Commodore 64 users throughout Europe have already found it
a tonic. We think you will, too.

The program as listed must
be entered exactly as written
and saved prior to running in
case a typing error causes a

have successfully keyed on and saved the
'Turbo 64' program from the December
1984 edition of 'Your Commodore'. But,
ﬁnd the directions in  your magazine
rather difﬁcult to follow. Please could you
explain how to load and save my ordinary
BASIC programs to run in the 'Turbo 64'
format.
). R. O'Donnell
Kent
We have received a  lot o f  queries
regarding this program so here is how to
use it:
Type in the program exactly from the
listing o n  pages 3 8 and 3 9 o f  the
December issue, with the errata to lines
255 and 585 from last month's issue.
BEFORE RUNning the program, save it off
under the name "turbo" or similar. Now
RUN the program and it will read in the
data. This will take a little time. Once
this is done, you will be asked if this
program has been saved. This ques-
tion refers t o the BASIC boot pro-
gram which w e  saved o f f  before
RUNning this part. Therefore, our answer
is "y" and press RETURN. The program
now exists as one line when listed. Having
done this, a prompt will appear on the
screen. Press RECORD and PLAY and the
ﬁnished program will be SAVEd as "T 64".
Make sure you do not overwrite the
BASIC loader program on the cassette
when SAVEing as if something does not
work you will not want to re-type the
listing.
To use the utility type the following;
LOAD"T 64",1,1
RUN
SYS 64738
SYS 50000
The turbo mode is now in operation
and all of the commands on page 38
should now work. Please note that any
software must be SAVEd using this utility
before it can be loaded using it. Thus you
cannot use this utility to load your existing
software until you have saved that
software using t h e —S"ﬁle name"
command,
L e t t e r s
We purc has ed a  Commodor e 6 4
computer, with a display monitor, a VIC
1541 for a single drive ﬂoppy disc and an
MPS-801 Dot Matrix Printer in order to
cornputerise our accounts.
So far we have a program which
enables us  t o  print the accounts the
patients and the statements to the nurses.
This program was prepared by a friend.
Now we want to buy a program which
will enable us to computerise all our
accounts and records.
Will you please advise us as to the most
appropriate program for this purpose.

There are a number of accounts packages
available for the 64. Take a trip to your
local business computer shop and ask to
see some of them demonstrated. The suit
of programs produced by Anagram will
certainly b e a  reasonable buy. Their
programs started life on the Commodore
business machines and the programs tend
to be fast, ﬂexible and easy to use. You can
get in contact with them at:
Anagram Systems

Horsham West Sussex

Note that if your accounts are large
and complicated and you intend using
your system for other applications, I
would recommend buying a  business
computer now as Commodore business
machines have the advantage of being
well established and may be networked
easily.

have looked in books and magazines
but have not found anything suitable for
my use.
If you can suggest any routines or hints
that I  could include in my programs
would be very grateful for your help.
A. Orritt,

This is possible b y making the ﬁrst
program on the cassette load over the I/O
vectors in page three. This program will
have to be SAVEd as a type three tape ﬁle
so that it is not relocated when LOADed.
Make the close channel vector point at a
piece of machine code loaded as part of
the ﬁrst program. This machine code can
then jump to the BASIC load routine. This
is quite tricky b u t  w ill provide a
reasonable level of program protection.
/ bought a Commodore 64 nearly a year
ago to replace a Commodore PET. I have
had an intermittent, but aggravating,
problem with the Commodore 64 that has
persisted despite replacing the computer.
From t i m e
initial screen is  displayed w it h t h e
complete loss of the content of memory.
The problem is no doubt due, in part or
entirely, to the power supply but ﬁtting
a surge suppressor has had little or no
effect. I still have the PET and that runs and
runs without any problem. The resetting
of the machine occurs most frequently
when in hi-res mode. Can you advise me
of how I may cure this fault?
D. j. Clarke
Bristol
A common and aggravating problem —
my fridge causes the same. Expensive
main suppressing ( i 2 0 0  worth!)
made no difference. I suggest you move
house o r change all other electrical
equipment o r buy a  new computer.
Seriously though, i t  i s  sensitive t o
equipment with relays that switch in and
out. Also it appears to be a problem only
associated with the early 64s...Sorry.

This month, Bryn
Phillips shows yot
how to add a 1
professional touch to
your programs 4-
through, for example,
memory expansion or
stylish introductions.
HOWEVER G O O D  YO U R
idea f o r  a  program, a n d
however well you write the
main program, the whole thing
can be easily spoilt by poor
presentation. There's nothing
worse when starting o f f  a
game, than to be met with an
off-centred title, no instruc-
tions, and then to frantically try
to steer your space ship out of
the way of the space debris by
stabbing blindly at keys, only to
ﬁnd the game has been written
for a joystick! It's important to
put these details into y our
game, together with reﬁne-
ments such as a high score
facility, key/joystick option,
replay facility, and if you can
ﬁnd room, a hall of fame.
In previous articles I'v e
stressed t h e  importance o f
tight programming— the more
you squeeze it down the more
you get in, with the added
bonus o f  fas ter  a c t io n .
Unfortunately, however hard
you try to squeeze down your
program, you're still going to
be hard pushed to put in all the
features you might like. Just the
title and instructions c ould
take up 1
your ambitions. A n d  t hen
there's the clever graphics. The
data statements alone start to
eat into your valuable memory,
and let's  fac e i t ,  o n  t h e
unexpanded VIC  2 0 you've
only got 3.5K. Or have you?
The two part program
The way round the problem is
to write your program as a two
part program.
Part 1
Initial title display
Instructions/scenario
Joystick/keyboard option
Customised graphics
etc
VIC GAMES
PROGRAMMING
Part II
Came
High score display
Hall of fame
Score update
etc
Things are looking up. If you
do this you will have converted
your VIC 20 into an impressive
7K w i t h o u t  a d d in g  a n y
expansion. The only problem
of course is  that the ﬁrst
program is  lost when y ou
LOAD the second. At ﬁrst sight
this wo u ld  ma ke  th e  wh o le
thing pointless, apart fr om
using the program to give the
instructions f o r  t he game.
When you lose the program,
you also lose any values for the
variables you have deﬁned in
the program. However there is
a way round this problem. If
you POKE the values for these
variables in protected memory,
using the technique outlined
last month, they stay there,
waiting to be pulled out in the
next program. This is shown
again in listingl Line 10 moves
BASIC to protect an area of
memory for the UDGs (User
Deﬁned Graphics — lines 20-
70), and the prompt given for
the joystick/keyboard option is
POKEd into location 7168 in
line 160. To tidy the whole
thing up lines 170-200 contain
an auto load routine, which
will automatically LOAD and
RUN t h e  second program.
Make s ure y ou SAVE this
program before you RUN it,
because otherwise the NEW
command in line 200 will ruin
all your hard work!
To prove to yourself that
this works, enter and SAVE
LiAing 2  immediately after
Listing 1, Now RUN Listing 1,
and c hoos e y o u r  option.
Listing 2  w ill automatically
LOAD and RUN and, as you
will s ee,  t h e  customised
characters a n d  t h e  o p t io n
chosen, are all intact. You've
now got plenty of memory left
in b o t h  p a r t s  f o r  t h e
instructions and the game, and
with any luck still some to spare
for a few special effects.
A few tricks
In the ﬁrst part of the program
you can afford to go to town on
the title screen. T he only
penalty is that the program will
take slightly longer to LOAD. It

can be worth it though. One
fairly obvious feature, if you
have enough LIDGs to spare, is
to draw some Hi-Res pictures,
or e v e n  a  per s onalis ed
signature. This isn't difﬁcult
providing y ou'v e g o t  t h e
patience t o  d e s ig n  t h e
graphics. There are however a
few s imply  implemented
techniques which can add a bit
of sparkle to what otherwise
would b e  f a i r l y  b o r i n g
instructions. F or  example,
instead of simply PRINTing the
instructions on the screen one
page at a time, why not POKE
them on letter by letter, with
accompanying son ics. A simple
example is shown in Listing 3.

You c a n  e x t e n d  t h i s
technique to get all sorts of
novel effects. Perhaps y ou
could have a plane ﬂying across
the screen with the title being
pulled along behind a banner?
You can have a lot of fun with
titles and instructions! Better
still why not make use of the
memory loc ations  w h ic h
determine t h e  s iz e  a n d
position o f  the screen. The
locations of interest are shown
in ﬁgure 1.
Figure 1
By playing around with these
you can get some really good
effects. For example you can
scroll the instructions onto the
screen smoothly us ing t h e
technique shown in Listing 4,
or if you want something more
impressive, you could make
each page o f  instructions
disappear down a black hole,
to be replaced by  the next
page. This is demonstrated in
Listing 5. If that doesn't appeal,
try Listing 6.
You can also make use of
these locations in  the main
game: the ship explodes into
fragments with such force that
even the screen shakes!

There are two types of bugs.
The ones  y o u  deliberately
design, to be shot down with
your laser, and the ones that
creep unnoticed in t o  y our
program. It's the latter that
need to be got rid of and that
can be tricky. Luckily the VIC

you play the game accordingly.
What about the person the

example the game is intended
for a young child, then let one
loose on the program. It can be
a horrendous experience! The

as it forces tight programming.
However, sometimes you will
need the extra memory, and
you will have to modify your
programs accordingly. If you
are not using UDGs, it is quite
straightforward. All you have
to d o  is remember that the
screen character locations start
at 4096, and the screen colour
locations start at 37888.

either in direct mode, or more
elegantly b y  using a  short

the one shown in Listing 7. In
the main program (Listing 8), all
you have to do is to set the
character pointer to the area of
protected memory, starting at
4096, and that's it. You now
write the program as normal —
even the screen character and
colour locations are back in
their usual position.

There a r e  lo t s  o f  o t h e r
techniques w hic h hav en't
been covered. Read through
listings in magazines,and if you
come across something you're
not familiar with try it out, and
work out how it's done. As a
VIC 20 owner you must collect
POKEs. I've covered a few in
this series, but there are quite a
few more, and some of them
might be useful!
The most important thing to
realise is that by the time you
have learnt t o  write good
games you will by  necessity
have gained a fairly compre-
hensive knowledge of BASIC,
and have a pretty good idea of
the way the computer works.
When you come to write other
programs, s uc h as  mathe-
matical analysis, home ﬁnance,
or educational programs, you

REWRITE THE HIGH 41s,  SCORE TABLES
So. you've got a Commodore. You've also got enemies. With the Gunshot, you'll have all the opposition
cowering in corners. 8-directional action and an all-in-one moulded stem allows accurate
annihilation and strength to survive those all-night sessions. Dual ﬁre buttons for
fading ﬁngers (and a rapid ﬁre version when they're really coming thick and fast).
And, if you break it (and we know you'll try) our I2-month guarantee will prove
invaluable. Only £8.95. The Gunshot plugs directly into the CBM 64 and Vic 20.
Ask about Vulcan interfaces for the C16 and Plus 4.
See the range of Vulcan joysticks and interfaces at your
local stockist we'll see you
on the high score tables.

HOW DO  YOU RECOVER A
crashed BASIC program?
Where perhaps the computer
is Locked Up. You may even
have accidently used NEW. The
ﬁrst problem therefore is how
to RESET your locked u p
computer. Wit h  both t h e
CBM64 and the VIC20 not
having a reset switch you have
to improvise.
Resetting
Referring to page 143 of the
User Manual or page 360 of the
Reference Guide f o r t h e
CBM64 (VIC20 owners refer to
page 283 of Reference Guide'
will show details of the User
Port. It states grounding of pin
3 will d o  a  cold start, but
memory will not be cleared. By
momentarily connecting the
reset pin 3 to the ground pin 1
with a  piece o f  wire your
computer does a cold start. The
Serial Port has a reset pin and
can be used in the same way.
How BASIC is stored in
memory
Having recovered control of
your computer you must next
consider how a BASIC program
is stored in memory.
Enter the following line in
direct m o d e  a f t e r ﬁrst
switching of f  and then o n
again:
You will get on the 64:
The normal BASIC program
space starts at 2048 on the
CBM64 and 4096 on the VIC20.
Now enter the following
short BASIC program:
0
1 PRINT"QVVERTY"
2 GOTO1
Line 0 should include 5 colons.
Repeat t h e direct mode
entry f r o m  a b o v e  1 . e .
ForX=2048toetc.. on the 64 or
ForX=X4096 on the VIC20. Now
memory consists of:
CBM 64:
FOR X = 204810 2081 ; PRINT PEEK (X); ; NEXT
VIC 20;
FOR )( = 4096 TO 4129 : PRINT PEEK (X);: NEXT
CBM 64:
The contents of address 2049 8,
2050 i.e. 11 &  8 are the link
address pointing t o  t h e
beginning of the second line in
BASIC i.e. 2059 (811056-1-11), The
contents of address 2051 & 2052
store the ﬁrst line no, Le. O.
Similarly the contents of 4097 &
4098 are t h e link address
pointers on the VIC20.
Now perform a  reset o r
NEW or SYS64738 & memory
becomes:
CBM 64:
Those date items i n  bold
are the only changes in this part
of memory.

To recover y our  lis ting
enter in direct mode again:
The program will now LIST; try
it. Do not try a RUN, or try to
alter the listing at this stage.
It helps to know the ﬁrst line
number. I f  you are not sure
assume it was Oand you will just
corrupt your ﬁrst line.
The other alterations that
occurred in memory when you
RESET were to the pointers in
address 45 to 50 which are listed
below for comparison:

POKE4102, 58:POKE4103, 58:P0KE4104, 58:POKE4105, 58
To get your program to run or
to be able to alter it in some
way address 45 to 50 now have

by entering a second program
in memory.

You ﬁrst need to protect your
ﬁrst program by changing the
pointers to start of BASIC:
This will now allow you to enter
the following short program;
SAVE it before you RUN it:

An epic space
adventure from Mike
Roberts in which the
safety of earth itself
at stake! •
GREEN THINGS FROM OUTER
space is a game of extreme skill
and mind bending strategy —
play it if you dare!
Green Things from Outer
Space runs on a C16 and will
run o n  a  Plus/4 w it h n o
modiﬁcation at all.
The object of the game is to
stop the green things getting to
the bottom o f  t h e  screen.
There are two green things on
the screen at any one time and
your laser base at the bottom.
The screen is 24 shades of blue
— going from dark at the top
(near space) to a bright blue at
the bottom. Your ship is moved
left and right by the Z and X
keys, the laser blast is ﬁred by
the ? key.
The pr ogr am c ontains
LIDGs in text mode to increase
speed and reduce memory
consumption. There are n o
commands to access these in
the very comprehensive BASIC
that the C16 and Plus/4 comes
with. So I  have had t o use
POKEs. Doing this on a C16 is
very awkward as you have to
look after the memory banking
and set pointers and the area of
memory. Astute programmers
will understand what I  a m
doing; everyone else will have
to wait until the techniques
become better known.
If you break out o f  the
program, or create an error the
3 7
know w hat i t  i s  when i t
happens. I f  you want to get
back to normal press stop/reset
and X as normal_
All other instructions are
contained in the program_

crosses for the
Commodore 64 or
VIC 20.
NOUGHTS A N D  CROSSES
has appealed to people of all
ages for many years. Now you
can test your wits against your

(3.5K or 6.5K) and 4096 is a VIC 8/16K. Initialise screen,
colour and sound variables.
120-190 Initialise scores, print title. Decide level of play and who
starts game.
200-210 Start game. Set up 'X and '0' POKE values. Print message.
230-270 Game loop. Call subroutines for sound, computer's
move, win/lose/draw check, opponent's move. Exit if
ﬂag is not 0
280-360 End game. Print appropriate message. Call 'Flash' routine

call END routine.
370-380 Decide who goes ﬁrst. Go to START (200).
390-430 SUB: WIN/LOSE/DRAW scan. Set ﬂag accordingly.
440-470 SUB: Flash winning line
SUB: Computer's move
480-530 Randomise Chance (1-100) and move (1-9). If move is
occupied, ﬁnd another. If chance value is greater than
level (38%. 68% or  98%). then play that move. Print
'thoughts'.
540-660 Follow through logical ﬁelds and decide which move is to
be made. The secret here is in the DATA statements
where all the possible combinations are each checked in
turn, accepting the highest ﬁeld result returned. Print
'thoughts'.

How it works
No REMarks are to be included
in t h e  ﬁsting t o  k eep the
program small enough to fa in
the 3.5K VIC.
The computer's 'thinking' is
based on three ﬁelds, in this
precise order:
1. I f  a Winning line can be
played, play it.
2. I f a  block is required, block
it.
3. Attempt t o  occupy any
three of the four corners.

Runecaster is shrouded in
mystery this month.
IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS WE HAVE
dealt with mapping and mazes; this
month it is the turn of the third 'm' —
mysteries. A mystery is a puzzle, and that
(or rather a  series o f  them) is  what
adventure games are all about.
In some ways a good adventure game
is rather lik e  t h e  'Daily  Telegraph'
crossword — the answer is often staring
you in the face all the time — you just (!)
have to read the question correctly and
then manipulate linked words, objects or
letters until they make sense!
Of c our s e t h e  o b je c t  o f  t h e
author/programmer is  t o  make these
puzzles fairly devious...I say and mean
'fairly devious'. Anyone can draw up a set
of puzzles that are almost impossible to
solve, but a good adventure is like a good
book — it has got to keep up a certain
'pace' or it fails. Some programs are a
failure for this very reason. The player is
not given a chance to get the feel of the
game b u t  is  thrown straight in t o  a
situation that would tax the patience of a
saint!
Many people have 'cut their teeth' on
adventures such as  T he Hobbit b y
Melbourne H ous e a n d  D u n g e o n
Adventure by Level Nine. Although these
provide two different types of quest, they
both allow the player a fair bit of rope
when starting: yes of course you can be
killed but, if you are, you learn something
in the process. in both of these programs
there are also alternative paths to be taken
whilst you are 'learning the ropes'...you
don't take three steps and die, everytimel
First steps
'Learning the ropes', what does this entail,
what do you look for..,how do you get
past the dragon, board the boat — or
whatever? First of all, look carefully at any
instructions, sometimes these can b e
lengthy and you will not be able to
assimulate all that they have to say...but
read them anyway. Later, something that
happens (or doesn't) may trigger off a
vague memory, so plough your way right
through them all. In particular lookout for
any c ommands  t h a t  t h e y  lis t  —
INVENTORY, EXAMINE, LOOK, HELP etc.
As you move around (mapping your
progress of course!) take very careful note
of what the location description tells you
and what you ﬁnd lying around. Find an
axe and later some trees by a river —
perhaps you could chop one down to
make a bridge.
46 E X A M I N E  everything you can. Some
programs only permit this i f  you are
already holding the object, others are
more tolerant. It is all too easy to assume
that a  simple description implies an
obvious use—which you never seem able
to ﬁnd!
Perhaps that axe you found might
yield to examination: "very blunt, the
axe-head comes off in your hand" —have
you already spotted a use for a short
length of wood? Examine the trees and
you might ﬁnd a rope you could climb.
Some programs try to wear you down with
a s hor t des c ription o f  everything
examined but persevere and don't let this
put y ou off looking at everything Ss
carefully as possible.
Find out as early as you can, how many
items you can pick up and retain at any
time. Especially look out for anything that
may enable you to carry extra items — a
rucksack or perhaps even a horse! Certain
objects could very well be worn; in fact
some items will probably have to be worn
to enable you to complete the adventure.
'Wear glasses' might give you quite a
different v ie w  o f  things ! Wear ing
something may also allow you to carry
more — check it.
Many adventures are divided into
sections, each with their own set o f
puzzles to solve, before you can progress
to further sections. Mor e importantly,
objects from previous sections are almost
certainly going to be needed to solve
future puzzles.
Section jumping
This brings us to one of the most common
'ploys' found in many forms in lots of
adventures — 'section jumping'. This is
where you are forced to leave one section
with a  puzzle (or puzzlesj unsolved.
because a clue or object needed is in
another section. More often that not, the
solution t o  t h e  original puzzle(s) is
needed t o  move o n  fr om this  next
section!
Look out for  objects that may be
combined w ith other objects ( or  b e
altered i n  some way) t o  produce a
different but useful article. The more
obvious example here is a vessel, bottle or
helmet that may be used later to carry
water/oil etc. How about a glass object
that could be broken and provide a useful
cutting tool (knife!)? Stones o r  that
strange l u m p  o f  m e t a l m a y  b e
transformed into hammers or axes!
Can you buy or bribe your way out of
trouble? Does the vocabulary support the
word GIVE. Note also that useable objects
are n o t  alway s  lis ted separately;
sometimes they are within the location's
description and sometimes they  jus t
appear in the graphics!
Many puzzles are a play on words or
on the theme o f  associated ideas —
carnivorous lumps of jelly might prefer to
eat that corpse you just passed.. instead of
you! An owl may very well like to be given
a pair of sunglasses...on a bright sunny
day. The possibilities go on and on, but it
all comes back to a careful examination
and appreciation of everything you ﬁnd.
Playing safe
As said before in these articles SAVE your
position regularly —you don't know what
is going to happen just around the corner!
Try t o  k eep one set o f  SAVEs that
represent a  'clean' path through the
adventure. B y  a l l  means  ex plor e
everything you come to, but when you
think you know how to tackle a particular
section; start from your last 'clean' SAVE
and complete this latest part with no
mistakes and no extra moves — your
future may depend upon a light staying
on or  food lasting, for only a certain
number of moves. It's almost certain that
number will not allow for your bumbling
around mazes or generally exploring!
If the facility exists, check your SCORE
fairly often. Although this is no certain
method it sometimes gives you a clue to 
4
whether an item just picked up is going to
be useful later.
If the instructions are not clear, ﬁnd out
what sort of vocabulary and grammar the
program recognises. Most games expect a
verb followed by a noun: GO SOUTH.

A d v e n t u r e
CLIMB TREE, BURN PARCHMENT etc.
Some will allow or occasionally need an
adjective: PRESS YELLOW BUTTON, GET
LARGE KEY.
As games become more complex,
longer s entenc es  a r e  b e c o m in g
acceptable: GO NORTH QUIETLY, may
be necessary to ensure that you are not
discovered. T his  c an giv e a  mo r e
interesting program, but the trend could
easily backﬁre — what was a logical and
stimulating puzzle becomes a protracted
test of words and their interpretation.
Even with the obvious limitations,
there is a lot to be said for the limited
syntax of verb and noun only (and in that
order). An adventure game written in this
fashion does  n o t  become a  ty ping
competition, and you are less likely to
loose the ﬂow of ideas whilst trying to
type in long sentences accurately!
Check h o w  much o f  a  word the
program actually needs — do you really
have to type in FUMIGATE FARMYARD,
or will FUMI FARM sufﬁce? I  know it
seems wrong but again, it is quicker and
allows you to concentrate on playing the
game smoothly.
Finally the vocabulary itself. As I've
said before, it is not possible for a program
to recognise every word you may wish to
type in  —  there is  just not enough
memory a v a ila b le .  I  f e e l  t h a t
programmers s hould stick t o  fairly
'common use' words such as 'sing' and
not 'chant' or 'croon'! For all this, each of
us has  a  differ ent 'c ommon us e
1
Ii adventures and ﬁnd yourself caught out
 for the right word — buy a Thesaurus; this
f '
is rather like a dictionary except you are
 g i v e n  other words meaning the same
thing, instead o f  t h e  meaning and
derivation o f  a  word. Probably t h e
simplest t o  us e is  T he New Collins
Thesaurus a n d  i s  t o  b e  h ig h ly
recommended.
That just about covers our 'instant
adventures guide' using the three 'm's'. If
you want any other area brought to light
— you know our address!
Several months ago we mentioned new
adventures in the pipeline from Mosaic
Publishing, we now have some of these up
and running on our Commodore 64
The Stainless Steel Rat Saves The
World, is  based loosely upon Harry
Harrison's well-known science ﬁction
book ofthe same name —  the book
(published by Sphere Books) is included
with the program.
Loading the program takes about six
minutes and once loaded some difﬁculty
was encountered i n  n o t  having t h e
slightest idea of what to do: you are
slipper Jim di Griz, a super thief turned
cop. Your attractive wife Angelina (lethal,
Two from Mosaic 1
e
lovely and also a one time super-lifood!) is
missing — you fear the worst and rush
over to Professor Coypu's laboratory...to
ﬁnd him just disappearing into a time
helix. Perhaps Angelina has  b e e n
abducted via such a helix. What now. ..the
time helix  fades fr om existence...the
game is over.
Do you want to try again to save the
world? Shakily you fumble with the 'Y' key
and this  time, forewarned, y ou d o
something — anything: GO HELIX, you
are in a familiar looking lab with two 'time
ﬁxators' on the table in front of you...the
helix fades away...
As the world is not immediately going
to fall about your ears, you slip into your
normal adv entur ing pos tur e a n d
EXAMINE FIXATORS — one is Coypu's,
one is Jail's: O.K. ﬁnd out how to examine
one of them —not much help, try GETting
one of them...yes that can be done...
Now lets look around: GO NORTH.
this is where you realise that you are
dealing with a different type of adventure
game from normal, the response was —
TRY ANOTHER OBIECT...whew, ouch!
look more carefully at the screen —
block graphics picture on the top eleven
lines, then a seven line window for the
description, ﬁnally a ﬁve line window for
your commands and some immediate
answers...like TRY ANOTHER OBJECT.
Not much to learn from the screen, the
ﬁxators have been picked up but they still
show o n  t h e  table, s o.. read t h e
instructions again. Not a great deal of help
there, either. Although 'T' to travel (using
time helix, once acquired). looks hopeful.
How about 'H' to ask for help (if needed)
— I do like the comment in the brackets!
'I' is for inventory — well at least that is
clear enough. Turn page — brief notes on
time travel and ﬁnally a short cryptic bit
about the four time parameters ":spin,
ﬂux, resonance and phase. You will have
to experiment to discover their properties
and relationships" — well, thank you.
Trying 'H' for HELP doesn't seem to be
a great success at this point, it  always
prints up SCENARIO followed by a repeat
of the location description, printed out
letter — which takes about 10 seconds to
get to the end of the second line — just a
little slow —  cumbersome, one might
say.
Frantic days later I've learnt the secret.
I'm sure all you clever clogs had it worked
out but move three, having got Coypu's
ﬁxator should have been BUILD HELIX —
knew it ,  all the.- time, didn't y ou —
Gnashhh.
Having built my very own little time
helix — time and space are my oyster —
no GO NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST
for me — just dial in SPIN, FLUX, PHASE
and RESONANCE and I can go anywhere,
anytime! The only trouble is I haven't yet
got the hang of what alters which, when
or where, Some combinations give me a
chunky attractive picture and some just
deliver a description and the display of my
time helix controls.
The idea behind this  program is
interesting to say the least, albeit I'm not
sure whether I have to be a mathematical
genius or an avid adventurer —what does
worry me is that there may be another
cracker like BUILD HELIX waiting for me
to miss it. The whole operation is slow in
reacting but as I don't really know yet
what I'm doing, that isn't as big a snag as it
may be later.
I've already been instrumental in a
different Eiffel Tower being built; I've
visited pre-historic swamps, the far future
and an Indian Pow-Wow. But, without
some more obvious coherent link to all
this time/space bashing I think I'm going
to loose interest soon — perhaps Mosaic
will produce a help sheet — BUILD HELIX
indeed!

The Saga of Eric the Viking
After my time/space adventures with the
Rat, it was a pleasure to slip quietly into
just one time and space based on Terry
Jones's book.
Eric returns to his village, to ﬁnd that
his family has been kidnapped. Your
mission (should you wish to accept ill is
to rescue them from their fate. You think
you know they were taken away by sea —
so a pretty urgent necessity must be to
ready your boat and crew for a tough sea
voyage.
High resolution pictures are drawn to
a little over half of the screen display (the
bottom n i n e  lin e s  a r e  us ed f o r
descriptions, actions and commands).
Pictures are a little slow to complete —
about 23 seconds for graphics display plus
location description —  but the hi-res
screens are good and if you are in a hurry
you may switch them off (and back on!) at
will.
Objects to ﬁnd and use are plentiful
and the puzzles provided are logical and
entertaining. Although I  have not yet
completed the adventure, there is a good
feeling to it and I am sure that it will prove
a good introduction to adventuring for
many.

Arithmetic
instructions are the I
subject of this
month's installment of
A.P. and D.J.
Stephenson?
informative machine
code series.
BEFORE YOU READ ON, YOU
may ﬁnd it helpful to refer back
to Part 1 of this series which
appeared in the October issue
of Your Commodore which
dealt with binary arithmetic
and two's complement.
Arithmetic, i n  general.
implies adding, subtracting,
multiplication, division and
exponentiation (rais ing a
number to a given power). All
of thes e oper ations  a r e
available i n  BASIC, us ing
conventional symbols which,
unseen by  the user, call up
complex m a c h i n e  c o d e
subroutines buried within the
interpreter ROM. The situation
facing those who are more
independent and not content
to rely on such spoon feeding
— and that means us — is less
rosy. We can increment the X
or Y registers, using INX or DEX
and decrement them, using
DEX o r  DEY. W e  can also
increment or  decrement the
contents o f  a n y  memor y
location by using INC or DEC
respectively. Although these
instructions are useful,they are
little morethancrudecounting
operations.
The 6510A microprocessor
offers only two pure arithmetic
instructions, A D C ,  w h ic h
means 'ADd with Carry and
SBC' which means 'SuBtract
with Carry'. Because o f  the
inherent t w o s  complement
structure, they  c an add o r
subtract any mixture of positive
and negative numbers. For
example, ADC can add 4 to 7,
-4 to 7, -4 to -7 etc. Similarly,
SBC can subtract any mixture of
E
unately, ADC and SBC suffer as
usual f r o m  t h e  penalties
imposed b y the 6510A and
indeed any other 8-bit micro-
processor — the restriction on
the size o f  numbers. Using
twos complement, the largest
positive number is 0111 1111
and t h e  larges t negativ e
number is 1000 0000 which is
+127 and -128 respectively.
Does this  mean t h a t  any
arithmetic total mus t  n o t
exceed these limits? As far as
the m ic r o p r o c e s s o r  i s
concerned, the answer is yes
but, as we shall see later, there
is a way of getting round the
problem b y  storing inter -
mediate results and sharing the
work load over two or more
memory  l o c a t i o n s ,  B y
employing a  little ingenuity
and craft, large numbers can be
built up by instalments. In the
meantime, the two instructions
must be discussed i n  detail
along w it h t h e  addressing
modes available,
Adding two numbers
together
First, a precise deﬁnition o f
ADC:
ADC: Ad d  the number, as
deﬁned by the operand, to the
existing c ontents  o f  t h e
Accumulator, tak ing i n t o
consideration the state of the
carry bit,
Expressing this i s  symbolic
form, A = A+M+C, where M is
the number deﬁned by the
operand and C is the carry bit.
The operation on the right of
the " = "  i s  what happens
and t h e  l e f t  h a n d  s id e
shows where the result is left.
This method of explaining the
action o f  a  c o m p u t e r
instruction is called operational
symboll5m_ Note that one of
the numbers (represented by
M in the above) will normally
come from a memory location,
the phrase deﬁned by  the
operand' implies this. But there
is n o  d o u b t  t h a t  t h e
Accumulator i s  t h e  pr ima
donna — it is the only register
in the 6510A which is equipped
to h a n d l e  a d d i t i o n  o r
subtraction. It is no good trying
to add numbers to the X or Y
registers. Neither will you have
any success in trying to add
together t w o  numbers i n
memory locations without
invoking the accumulator as an
intermediary. In fact, this is an
ideal problem to illustrate the
procedures.
Assume one number is in
address $C200 and the other in
SC201 and we wish to add them
up and store the result in
$C202.
Method 1
Method 2
TERING
CHINE
The ﬁr s t method i s  o n e
instruction shorter because the
accumulator is  automatically
cleared o f  a n y  pr ev ious
contents by overwriting it with
an LDA• The second method
ﬁrst clears the Accumulator to
zero b y  us ing I D A  w i t h
immediat e a d d r e s s in g .
Strangely, the 6510A has no
instructions t o  directly clear
the Accumulator, or  indeed
any other of the registers, so
instead we have to load them
with z er o. M e t h o d  t w o ,
although w a s t i n g  o n e
instruction, is better and tidier
(?) w h e n  a  n u m b e r  o f
additions have to be carried
out by means of a loop.
Since the carry (the C-bit) is
always l u r k i n g  i n  t h e
background, and may  have
been left in the C=1 state by a
previous instruction, i t  is
essential that it be cleared to
zero, by use of CLC, before
starting a n  addition f r o m
scratch. We  should mention
that there will be times, such as
in multiple precision work,
(discussed later) when the C-

bit is required but in simple
cases, CLC mus t b e  us ed
immediately before the use of
an A D C  in s t r u c t io n .  A
signiﬁcant percentage of bugs
in a machine code program are
caused by the intrusion of the
C-bit for which the program-
mer had forgotten to allow.
Overﬂow status
If, a f t e r  a n  ar ithmetic al
ins tr uc tion, t h e  m i c r o -
processor senses that the result
in t h e  Accumulator will b e
outside the limits of +127 or
-128 it will set the V-bit to 1 in
the status register. I n  other
words, the machine will 'warn'
the programmer that the last
result caused overﬂow status,
in other words, the result is
utter rubbish. Should t h e
programmer b e  concerned
about this? Remarkable as it
sounds, t h e  answer i s  —
probably not! It all depends on
the i n t e r p r e t a t i o n  t h e
programmer places o n  t h e
result. If he/she interprets the
8-bit result as a signed integer,
within the normal range of +127
and -128, overﬂow status is
serious and steps must betaken
in t h e  program t o  initiate
alternative action if it occurs.
This can easily be done by using
a BVS o r  BVC conditional
branch. But, if the programmer
is o n l y  c onc er ned w i t h
absolute (unsigned) numbers,
overﬂow status can be safely
ignored because the largest
number in an 8-bit register is
1111 1111 1255 decimal). The
msb is interpreted as part of the
overall magnitude rather than
as a sign bit.
Carry status
We have seen that, at times,
overﬂow status can be ignored
when working with positive
absolute numbers but, t h e
question w h ic h  natur ally
follows is, "What happens if
the result is over 255?”. This is
where t h e  C  b it  c ome in.
Although the C-bit occupies a
remote position in the status
register, it can be treated as the
'ninth' bit of the Accumulator.
Now, nine bits can accom-
modate numbers u p  t o  511
decimal (1 1111 1111 binary) so
the programmer knows that
the C-bit, plus the bits already
in the Accumulator, represent
a valid total. In other words, the
nor mal 8  b i t s  i n  t h e
accumulator form the 'lower
byte' total a n d  t h e  C- bit
becomes t h e  I s b  o f  t h e
'high byte'. It is easy to include a
conditional br anc h, us ing
either BCS or BCC, at the end
of an addition to check the
carry status. I f  C 1 ,  t h e n
another memory location can
be used to hold it. This brings
us to the concept of double
length arithmetic.

To illustrate the technique, we
will a d d  t w o  single length

memory lo c a t io n s .  T h e
following c oding is  hardly
worth keying in but at least it
will show one of  the many
possible methods of handling
numbers lar ger  t h a n  255.
Assume that one number is in
SC200. the other in $C201 and
the double length result is to be
stored in $C401 (low byte) and
SC402 (high byte) addresses.

shows the logic behind the

Note the following points:
(a) The ﬁrst number was added
to an empty Accumulator with
the C-bit cleared.
(b) The second number was
then added to form the low

exceeded 255, the C bit will
have been set to 1.

To illustrate what actually
happens at the binary level, let

Multiple precision
When two locations (16 bits in
all) are used, the maximum
absolute numbers is increased
to 65,535 decimal. This number,
although large, may still not be
enough t o cope with every
contingency. It should be clear
that if the C-bit can be used to
provide continuity between
the ﬁrst and second bytes there
is no reason why it cannot be
used to connect the second
with a third byte. Three byte
numbers can reach up to 2 24-1
which in decimal, is nearly 17
million. In theory, the method
can be extended indeﬁnitely to
allow n u m b ers o f  a n y
magnitude and precision to be
handled.

Subtracting one
number from another
As before, we must start with a
precise deﬁnition of SBC:
513C: Subtract the number, as
deﬁned by the operand, from
the existing contents of the
Accumulator, taking in t o
account the state of the carry
bit
Unlike addition, the order in
which t h e  numbers a r e
subtracted i s  important.
Adding 6 to 3 is the same as
adding 3 to 6. On the other
hand, subtracting 3 from 6 is
certainly n o t  t h e same as
subtracting 6 from 3. This may
seen a trivial thing to bring up
but i t  is so easy t o  code
subtraction t h e wrong way
round unless you remember
that the subtraction is FROM
the Accumulator. There is
another pitfall with subtraction
processes because of the way in
which the C  bit has to be
handled. This pitfall is far from
obvious. In  fact it is bizzare
enough t o  m e r i t  e x t r a
emphasis:
Before using SBC, don't
clear the C bit. Instead, set
it to -
The reason for this is tied up
with t h e  theory o f  two's
complement arithmetic.
Although SBC is provided, it is
not essential to use it because
subtracting B from A can be
achieved by adding -B to A.
Now, because a  negative
number is simply the two's
complement of the equivalent
positive number every bit is
reversed, (ﬂipped) including
the carry bit! From this, we can
deduce that although we clear
the carry t o  z ero before
adding, we must set the carry to
1 before subtracting. This can
also be justiﬁed by considering
that during an addition, we
'carry' a bit over to the next
signiﬁcant place but, during a
subtraction, we borrow a bit
from it and we can't borrow a
bit unless it is already a T. From
this, it appears that the carry, in
a subtraction process, should
really be called the borrow.
The following few lines show
the procedure for subtracting
the contents of $C200 from
$C201.

Status register ﬂags
It is important to know which
ﬂags are affected. if any, after
an instruction has b een
executed. I g n o r a n c e  o r
forgetfulness can lead to some
pretty a w f u l programming
bugs which may be difﬁcult to
trace. The table of status ﬂags
affected appeared in Table 4,2
in Part 3 of this series but, for
convenience and because ﬂag
status is so important, they are
repeated below except that
only op-codes which have so
far been covered have been
included.
ADC and SBC updates N,Z,C
and V ﬂags.
CMP, CPX and CPY update N,X
and C ﬂags.
INX, INY, DEX, DEY, INC, DEC,
tions have no effect on any of
the ﬂags.
It is also worth pointing out
again that the carry ﬂag can be
directly set or cleared by SEC
and CLC. The overﬂow ﬂag can
not be directly set but can be
cleared by CLV.
Using t h e  M I K R O
assembler
In the ﬁrst part of this series,
you were strongly advised to
obtain one of the assembler
cartridges on the market, in
par tic ular , t h e  M I K R O
cartridge obtainable f r om
Supersoft. The example coding
which have so far appeared in
the series has been deliberately
kept in low key but, the pace
from now on will hot up a little.
It is still possible for those who
have not yet invested in an
assembler to carry on POKEing
the bytes into memory or by
means of the loading program
given in Part 3. For the beneﬁt
of those w ho may still b e
hesitating before purchasing
the MIKRO, here is how a
simple program is keyed in.

At this stage, don't worry about
what the program is supposed
to do because the important
thing ﬁrst is  t o analyse the
format on a line by line basis.
First, n o t ic e  t h a t  t h e
assembler allows you to write
line numbers. These are for
convenience a n d  reference
only. You can't branch or jump
to a line number in assembly
language like you are used to in
BASIC. Line 10: '-k=" is the
format for telling the assembler
where the ﬁrst byte of t he code
is to be located in memory, in
this case, $C000.
Line 20: This is how you assign
an arbitrary label to an absolute
memory location. It is called a
symbolic operand. Once this is
assigned, the label SCREEN can
henceforth b e  used a s a
legitimate operand instead of
quoting the absolute address
each time. This improves the
readability of the code.
Line 50: BACK, is a branch label
for the remainder of the line
which is  a  simple absolute
indexed instruction w it h  a
symbolic operand.
Line 70: This shows one of the
most useful aspects o f  an
assembler, the ability to use
branch labels  ins tead o f
laboriously working out the
correct r elativ e- addr es s
number.
Line 80: RTS (which we have
not y et covered) is  RETurn
from Subroutine, used to steer
the program back to BASIC.
Note the program is spaced
out well. This can be done by
the programmer o r ,  mor e
easily by the special assembly
'pseudo op-code' FORMAT.
The only rule is that at least one
space must be left between
each component o f  t h e
coding.
The assembler will translate
the program from the original
source c o d e ,  w h ic h  t h e
microprocessor does not
understand, to pure machine
code, w hich t h e  micro-
processor does  understand.
The assembler has a tough job.
In fact it has to make three
'passes' through the source
code before it can complete
the task. This is because the
symbolic and branch labels
must ﬁrst be decoded before it
is possible to complete the rest
of the task. Fortunately, all this
goes o n  uns een and t h e
programmer is not involved,

Here's a handy utility
from John Gundry for
all VIC 20 users.
THIS VI C  DISASSEMBLER
should be of interest to anyone
following o u r  excellen t
 Machine Code series. It just ﬁts DisAssEmBLER
into the unexpanded VIC, but
will probably run o n most
Commodore machines with
little or no modiﬁcation. There
are ﬁv e  commands t h e
program will recognise:
?Dnnnn
?Hn
ON
OFF
IDSnnnn
Calculates and prints out the denary equiv-
alent of the four digit hexadecimal number
nnnn
Calculates and prints out the hexadecimal
equivalent of the denary number n. Where
n is an integer in the range 0 to 65535.
Enables output to the printer.
Disables output to the printer.
Disassembles memory from address nnnn,
where nnnn is a four digit hexadecimal
number. Use shift to pause the listing, or
CTRL to return to INPUT mode.
The printer is assumed to be
device 6; this can easily be
amended in LINE 42 to suit the
particular printer being used.
The part of the program
which will probably need to be
modiﬁed t o  en ab le t h e
program t o  run o n  other
machines are the two POKES in
line number one. These set the
Error Message Link vector to an
RTS instruction in  ROM. A
crude but effective way to stop
the generation of unwanted
ERROR messages. Please note
these POKEs must be left out
until you have a fully working
copy of the program.

IF YO U HAVE A  64 AND A  NO N-
Commodore printer you will need an
interface in order to get things working.
The chances are that your printer is of the
Centronics type as opposed to the R5232.
I have been trying out a few of the
Centronic's interfaces that are available
from the cheap to the expensive and most
users will ﬁnd one here that will be the
best for their particular needs.
If you have a dot matrix printer it is
possible that you could, in theory at least,
print out Commodore's full character set.
The simpler interfaces such as the Stack
will not support this but the costlier ones
will. Some interfaces will enable your
printer t o  c ompletely  emulate a
Commodore printer. They do cost a little
more but it is money well spent.
Stack Centronics interface
The Stack interface consists of just a lead
and tape based software to act as a driver.
Used on its own the lead works with most
of t h e  commercial software whic h
requires only a connecting lead. To use it
in programs which you have written
yourself you will ﬁrst need to load the
interface software before you load the
program. Alternatively, t o  mak e t he
program a little easier to use, it is possible
to load it from within your program. This is
done by having a line in your program
saying something along the lines of — 10
IF A  =  0  THEN A=1 :LOAD "DRIVER
NAME",8,1 :rem. If you have a tape based
set up change 8,1 to 1,1_ When your
program is run it will load software and
then continue to run.
The advantage with the Stack interface
is that as the code is relocatable you
should be able to ﬁnd an area of RAM
which is unused and tuck it away there.
Routines are built into the software so that
it c an b e  saved and loaded into a
particular part of RAM. No help was given
in the manual regarding saving the tape
based software to disc, but the manual
implies that a  disc based version is
available. Unfortunately ther e is  n o
indication on the box it arrived in to say
whether it is disc or tape based. This is one
of t h e  cheaper interfaces available
although i t  i s  s till fairly  expensive.
However, the quality of the components
used in the lead is very high. The cable
itself is a thick round type as opposed to
ribbon and the plugs at each end are
chunky and solid.
It does what it is supposed to do, but it
is not the most convenient of interfaces to
use, and for what it consists of I feel it is
overpriced
RAM Electronics
The RAM electronics interface goes by
the name of Trippler. It is a black box with
two leads. One lead goes from the box to
the serial port, the other to your printer.
The whole assembly then plugs into the
user port of the 64, One thing that cannot
be criticised on the Trippler is the length
of the lead. On the one I received there
was over one yard of ribbon cable. This
makes a pleasant change as often you ﬁnd
that the lead is just that little bit too short.
The manual, if it can be described as that,
is simply a sheet of A4 printed on both
sides. The Trippler is not a sophisticated
interface so the documentation would
seem adequate.
Because all the decoding software etc.
is in the black box it will not conﬂict with
any software in RAM. This is an advantage
over the Stack, The Trippler is plugged
into the serial port, so if  a  piece of
software asks which printer you have, you
respond with Commodore. This type of
interface is nice as it means that any
software which supports a Commodore
printer will run. Using it in your own
programs is also very simple as it runs like
a Commodore printer. The instructions
are clear and explain simply all you need
to know. Again this one will not support
the full Commodore character set but is a
good general purpose interface. For its
price it is a reasonable buy; the only
disadvantage is that it does require the use
of the user port. There is not a through
port on the Trippler, so if you wanted to
piggy back peripherals the Trippler would
need to go last. How this would affect the
performance I do not know as none of the
other things I use on my 64 have a through
= =

port either. So far then the best interface
seems to be the Trippler with less conﬂict
in memory, ease of use and no need to
load an external software driver.
To emulate or not
As you see, the above interfaces do not
fully emulate Commodore printers. The
next t w o  enable some o f  the more
popular pr inter s  t o  d o  c omplete
emulation. With interfaces like these your
choice of printer widens enormously as
both these allow you to conﬁgure the
interface according to printer type. In
both cases the main conﬁguration is done
with dip-switches. They do cost more but
with one of these you will have a very
powerful printer.
Grappler
The Grappler has a smoked perspex cover
which enable you to see exactly what is
: P = =
inside. This reveals an 8 switch dip switch.
There was plenty of ribbon lead to
reach the printer but the plug which goes
into the serial port is very short If you
have a ordinary Mit is O.K. but once again
if you own an SX-64 modiﬁcations are
required. The main unit plugs into the
user port and on this one there is a
through port so it is possible to piggy
back. Another lead plugs into the serial
port. There is another serial socket on the
interface so again peripherals using the
serial port can be piggy backed. Of course
if you do piggy back then make sure that
the Grappler comes before the printer.
Connections made, I plugged it in and
started t o  t r y  this  n e w  generation
interface.
The manual consists of some thirty
pages and all of it is needed. It is very
much an American manual and tends to
be a little condescending but does at least
get on with the job. Many modes are
available on the Grappler from straight
emulation to listing mode. Many of these
modes are set through the dip-switches
and others can be turned on and off
through software. Used as an emulation
device i t  per for ms  w e ll.  A l l  t h e
Commodore character set is printable
and used with word processing packages
it performs well.
Through the dip-switch it is possible to
set the CD screen function, emulation
mode, program listing mode, transparent
mode, and text mode. These change the
way the Grappler works. For instance, in
listing mode instead of the difﬁcult to
decipher inv er s e gr aphic s  w h ic h
Commodore use t o  show a  control
function, the grappler will print, between
brackets a  couple o f  letters. I f  the
command is a cursor up then Grappler
will print (csrup). This makes listings easy

to read and it is done automatically. The
emulation mode would n o t  d o  this
conversion. Transparent mode stops any
trapping of control characters. By this I
mean, if a chr$(14) was sent to the printer
in order to turn on a single line of double
height characters this may be ignored if in
emulation or listing mode. Alternatively
strange print may  occur. Transparent
mode however allows this character to
pass unchanged and you will be able to
print w h a t  y o u  lik e .  T hat i s  a n
oversimpliﬁcation of transparent mode,
but in short, it gives total control over
your printer.
One very interesting thing about the
Grappler i s  that i t  contains inbuilt
software to do screen dumps. This is an
interesting feature and quite a useful one,
Of course it will only work if your printer
can do a bit image dump but it is there and
it does work. However, you can only
dump t o  the screen i f  the program
supports screen dumps and you can break
into the program and exit while the image
is on the screen.
In use it worked well. To use it to its full
would require some time going through
the manual and unfortunately I have not
been able to take it to its limits yet.
It is not cheap but it is very nearly the
ultimate interface. It is of a very high
quality and fairly easy to use. Whatever
printer you have you should be able to
conﬁgure the Grappler to suit. Most of
the popular printers are mentioned in the
hand book but even if it's not, you would
probably ﬁnd one setting that will work.
Tu rbopri nt GT
For me this is the ultimate interface. It is
1 M
56 f u n c t io n s  o f  t h e  G r appler ,  b u t
1=11Elconsidering the quality, ease of use, and
price of the CT it is the one I think may
become the most popular. It is a small
black box about 5" x 3" with a ribbon
connector a n d  serial lead. O n  t h e
standard version there is an extra small
lead which plugs into the cassette port.
This has a socket as well so you can still
have the cassette plugged in. Then it
simply takes ﬁve volts from the port in
order to drive the GT. If you have an SX-64
you will need to cut off the cassette plug
and take the 5 volts from the user port.
Because it plugs into the serial port only
(except for the 5V line) there is absolutely
no possibility of conﬂict in memory. A
small cutout on the top of the C
four switches on a dip switch. These are
used to select the device number and set
the printer type. Any other selection is
done under software control. It is simple,
tidy and works extremely well. Like the
Grappler it has various modes and sub
modes. The main ﬁve are:
A. Emulation
B. Listing
C. Transparent
D. Graphics
E. T ag
These have all been explained before
except tag. This mode will print a I sign
whenever an unprintable character is
received. There is no inbuilt screen dump
facility but the manual does contain a
screen dump program for various types of
printer. The screen dump of course will
only work under similar circumstances as
the Grappler. It is easy to change modes
with the GT.
If you want a normal emulation listing
you type —OPEN4,4:CMD4:LIST, this will
list the program as seen on the screen. If
you want to switch to listing mode then
you type — OPEN4,4,10:CMD4:LI5T. This
like the Grappler will give you a listing
which replaces the inverse characters
with meaningful mnemonics.
Since I  ﬁnis hed rev iewing t h e
interfaces this  i s  t h e  o n e  that has
remained connected. It really is excellent
and represents tremendous value for
money.
One last thing worth pointing out
about the GT is that there is an extra slot
on the bottom which will accept a printer
buffer. According t o the manual you
should be able to get a 16 or 32K buffer
but I understand that they will not be
importing the 32K version. The buffer
retails at the same price as the CT and this
would appear to be one of the cheapest
buffers I have seen,
Results
If I was going out to buy an interface today
I would have to say that it would be either
the Turboprint CT or the Grappler. The
Grappler has a few more facilities and
does have through ports but taking
everything into consideration I  would
probably aim for the Turboprint. It is hard
to quantify why but I think the main thing
is that as i t  only  plugs i n  where a
Commodore pr inter  plugs  i n  ( 5 V
excepted) it makes your printer closest to
a Commodore printer. If my funds were
limited then I  would go for the RAM
Trippler. All the interfaces worked, it
really boils down to what you need.

A game must be more than I
just a mass of objects movingi
around the screen. in the
second part of this great newl
series, David Rees shows how
to provide a background to
your game. 1 1 1 1 a l l
THIS MONTH, I  INTEND TO COVER
aspects of the background of the game. A
background may be used either as an
enhancement, or an actual part of the
game, but both give an extra quality of
detail to the game. For example, a 'shoot
the aliens in space game is all very well
with a matt black background but the
addition of a few coloured stars takes very
little programming, but adds depth and
more realism.
I w i l l  av oid explaining t h e  ﬁrst
category any further, as it is up to your
own artistic abilities. Backgrounds that
take a more active roll (principally, those
that get in the way of the foreground
objects) are more important.
The ﬁr s t a n d  m o s t  impor tant
operation concerned with a background
is to let the foreground objects (moving.
co-ordinated objects such as your space
ship) know obstacles are there. Routine
three handles this, and is explained later.
This routine will make detection easy, but
it is up to you to decide whether objects
are simply stopped (eg. as in Pacman), or
are destroyed (eg. Scramble) by obstacles.
You may also decide that changing the
background is  essential t o  the game.
However, be warned that even one POKE
used regularly can slow a BASIC game by
a signiﬁcant amount. Many arcade games
use a screen scrolling feature, so I have
included machine code routines to do
this. Even in code, scrolling takes quite a
time, so use these routines sparingly. To
increase speed, you have the option of
just scrolling characters, which can still be
effective while halving the execution
time.
Sound is another enhancement to a
game. It is up to you to contrive your own
ear shattering effects, but as shot sounds
have to be executed fast (so as not to slow
down the action), I  have included a
machine code gun shot routine.
As with last month's article, some
machine code routines are included to
help with your program. To start, the
listing gives a  general r outine f o r
POKEing the code to memory. They may
E
remember their start positions for the SYS
command), and are independent of one
another. Here is an explanation of each
routine:
Routine three: This measures sprite
collisions with any background object. To
tell the routine whether to search for a
collision with that sprite use P0KE53049+
sprite no,x2, 1 for see or 0 to blind it.
PEEK(5305170- sprite no.x2)gives a result for
that sprite after the routine has been run.
There are two other important locations,
53065 and 53066. These hold centering
values for X and Y, respectively, and are
normally set to eight, where the routine
searches under the sprite. By changing
these numbers, you can search around
the sprite (eg. if 53065 contained zero, the
routine would search to the left of the
sprite) and see ahead o f  it. This is
especially useful in a Pacman type game,
where you have to stop sprites going
through the wall.
Routines four and ﬁve: these routines
scroll the screen down and to the left,
respectively, and they are easy to use and
are versatile. POKE 53067 determines the
••••••••,,,,,s, s t a r t  line of scrolling, and 53068 controls
the ﬁnish, allowing your life and score
display to stay still during the action.
Please note that there are no limits to
these registers, so you must be careful not
to put in too high a number, as your
program may be scrolled. Also note that
the ﬁrst line/column is not cleared after
scrolling. This allows many special effects,
such as using any character as the screen
background. Mov ing characters can
simply be placed on the line below and to
the left of the ﬁrst, Finally, POKE 53069
determines whether both screens (2) or
just the character screen (1) are scrolled.
Routine six: this simply produces a
gunshot taking very little time, as nothing
needs POKEing. Also, if you follow each
sound with a channel one cut off (eg.
POKEing the wave register to zero) and
repeat the effect fast, you will get a
machine gun effect.
If any of the above is not clear, listing 2
gives an example of how to use each of
the routines, inc luding setting t h e
registers,
N.B. Before us ing lis ting 2 ,  t h e
machine code routines should already
have been POKEd in by routines in listing
1.

THIS BOOK'S A  LITTLE PUZZLING.
From the cover it appears to be a standard
educational book but a quick scan within,
reveals a  c ollec tion o f  educational
programs which involve a lot of typing.
There are a  number o f  introductory
passages aimed at parents, teachers and
children. Ignoring the inevitable amount
of boring spiel. there is a useful guide to
the control codes and some snippets on
entering the programs. A list showing for
which age group each game is suitable
precedes the games.
The games themselves are a good mix
and are speciﬁcally intended to help
educate the player (if you only want to
destroy inv ader s  o r  s o m e t h in g
similar...ignore this book).
There are a nimber of games to help
teach the younger age group (3-6 years)
counting, s imple arithmetic, s imple
numeric sequences and odd man out.
Whilst being useful, I feel these are rather
a dry lot, especially when one appreciates
how difﬁcult it can be to maintain the
attention of younger children.
The games for the 7 to 14 year olds are
a lot more varied and interesting and
inc lude s ear c hing games  u s in g
coordinates, lo g ic ,  w o r d  games ,
homonyms and some arithmetic. For the
older children, there were games testing
French and Geography.
On the whole, the programs are well
structured and use quite a lot of graphics.
It is, however, slightly biased towards the
older children.
The reason for my initial confusion is
my uncertainty over the book's i
readership: children will gain from the
games but what about the parent or
teacher who has typed in these rather
long programs? T hey  mus t  lear n
something from the experiencel The
solution is  simple. Why  haven't the
publishers released cassettes and discs
containing the games so the games can be
used without the tedium of typing them
in.
Despite my minor moan, this appears
to be a very good book which offers a
good variety of interesting games at a fair
price_

THE COMMODORE 64 IS RATHER A
paradox. On the one hand it has some
excellent graphics modes but on the
other you can only use them by resorting
to numerous POKEs. Most books give a
thumbnail sketch on graphics but leave
you n o  better off. This book  is  n o
different. It is based on the creation of
tools which enable y ou t o  perform
certain graphical operations. These
include switching in the graphics screen,
clearing the screen, drawing dots, lines,
boxes, polygons, circles and ﬁlling
shapes. Clearly such simple material
would hardly ﬁll a book so the authors
have wrapped it all up in the creation of a
sea scene. The idea is that once you know
how to draw this scene, you can create
your own pictures and amaze everyone.
The book's strong point is the care
with which each step of the process is
discussed. The overall package is split into
sections a n d  pr es ented i n  s mall
digestable portions. You are invited to
type in each section of a program and test
run it while you watch how it works. The
theory of the operation of that program
portion is then described in detail. The
descriptions are richly enhanced with
diagrams, photographs and sketches.
There are also exercises and summaries at
the end of each chapter to help reinforce
REFERENCE

the material learned.
As the book continues, the reader is
introduced to more complex concepts.
Particular emphasis is placed on the use of
shape tables  f o r  t h e  dr awing o f

resolution graphics the book progresses
on to sprites. Tools for the deﬁnition and
placing of sprites are provided along with
a number o f  amusing designs. The
majority of routines are written in BASIC,
but at the end of the book a number of
machine code routines are supplied to
speed things up.
The actual tools supplied aren't very
useful and the work involved in creating a
picture is rather excessive, but the book is
worth buying for its excellent information
on using graphics and its handy ideas.

THIS BASIC TEXT ROOK IS OF A MIK I-
can origin and is aimed at primary school
children. I t  has been written by  two
primary s c hool teachers a n d  t h e
mandatory college teacher. The format is
typically American i n  that i t  makes
extensive use of cartoon characters to
make the text friendly and exercises to
reinforce the points covered.
The book assumes that the user knows
nothing about the computer and begins
with an explanation of the keyboard and
it's functions. Having tapped out a few
characters y o u  a r e  eased thr ough
arithmetic in  direct mode. The book
continues at a nice easy pace covering
most of the usual aspects of programming
including variables, looping, conditionals
and arithmetic.
I feel that the book is an adaptation of
a general BASIC text with a few tweaks to
suit the 64: for example, CHRS(147) is
used to clear screens in programs, POKE
and PEEK are carefully avoided as are
cursor control codes and colours. If,
however, you simply want to learn BASIC
without any frills, it would do the job.
To conclude, the book is suitable for
younger children since it covers a variety
of subjects in a readable style.

THIS IS A N  AMERICAN COMPUTER
book w it h a n  interesting and novel
approach w hic h s hould appeal t o
children in the 9+ age group. The book is
unusual in that it deals with chance.
It is set out as an adventure story with a
central character called Harold who is a
boy with a penchant for computers (he
has a  desk t op and a portable) and
adventure. One of his pastimes is going
for a bus ride; not to get anywhere in
particular but just to have time to think
and see new places and meet new people.
One day he ﬁnds himself in a place called
Random Alley. This place is new to him
and is populated by some very strange
people.
The ﬁrst person h e  meets is  a
compulsive gambler on his way to a
roulette game. He is late because at every
bus stop h e tosses a coin t o  decide
whether he should get off the bus or not.
He uses the same tactics to decide which
way he goes at cross-roads. Harold, using
his pocket computer, tries to show Frank,
the gambler, that his coin tossing has an
equal probability of showing heads or
tails. Harold continues his travels and
meets other people each demonstrating a
random theory.
Each chapter starts w ith a  short
portion of the story describing Harold's
adventures. The concepts developed in
each story are expanded and illustrated
by short programs which the reader can
type in. Sufﬁcient detail is given with the
programs t o  show how the program
works and to offer some programming
guidance. A  wide range o f  ideas are
covered including c oin tossing, dice,
playing c ar d selection a n d  artiﬁcial
intelligence/random message generation
(as in fortune cookies or the program
Eliza). The programs are generally short
(less than forty lines) so that typing them
in isn't too much of a chore.
The story is compelling enough to
keep most youngsters interested. The text
is augmented with many good quality
illustrations, b o t h  c o lo u r e d  a n d
monochrome. I found it a most enjoyable
and informative book.

OK SO YOU'VE EXTRACTED ALL THE
information from the Commodore 64
handbook and you think you can write a
mean program? What do you do next?
This book deals with a host of more
advanced aspects and is  intended t o
extend your knowledge and expertise.

algorithms. U s in g  t h e  c onc epts
introduced, it is easy to develop neat,
efﬁcient and easily understood programs.
Having established a few good habits,
the book slithers smoothly into a tasty
secetion on ﬁle handling on discs. This
starts with sequential ﬁles and moves on
to random access and ISAM. There is a
sadly truncated section on machine code
which does little mor e than discuss
assemblers but it does give the author the
excuse to use machine code routines in
the rest of the book. The remainder of the
book covers the use of graphics and
sprites. The complex subject of graphics is
dealt with well and some useful machine
code routines are supplied. A particularly
strong chapter discusses the more
esoteric aspects of the 64 including the
use of the CHARGET wedge to extend
BASIC, increasing execution speed and
memory banks.
I ﬁnd t he American style a  little
tiresome b u t  the treatment o f  quite
complex topis is reasonably concise and
readable. There is even the odd cartoon
to encourage a smile.
Overall this is a very strong book
which is a useful source of information
and will serve as a good reference guide
as well as educational book. In many
ways. it is better than the Commodore
Programmer's Reference Guide. Well
worth a close look.

Most of us will remember buying the
small potted guides as an aid to passing
'0' level or  CSE English Literature. In
these packages Penguin have come up
with computerised guides which are both
easier to use and more informative.
In effect, you are given a dedicated
data base containing a huge slab of useful
information extracted from the play. The
menu gives a list of people and a list of
themes which you can incorporate in a
search. You can select up to three criteria
and t he program will search for  all
incidents or aspects in the play which
relate to these criteria. You can choose to
search the whole play or selected acts.
The results of the search are returned as a
series o f  open-minded comments o r
questions. Each item is accompanied by
suggestions for further searches.

other (for me at least) the game
content after a few levels, got
repetitive. The game is based
on shooting everything that
moves and, if it can't be shot at
that time, then getting out of
its way is advisable. What you
have to do is complete as many
of the 31 levels of caves as
possible. You have a time limit
in whic h t o  complete each
level and very soon it is also a
race against the clock.
The graphics used on this
game ar e o f  a  very high
with any educational program is what it
will do for you. These programs are not
intended to teach you lots of useless facts.
For example, they will not tell you who
said what, when and why, since most of
English Literature questions involve the
examination of the themes in the play and
the underlying ideas. I n other words,
these programs will teach you lateral
thought and the ability to examine the
broader aspects of literature. It is assumed
that you have done the spade work at
school or college and you simply need
your grasp of the play improved.
In operation these programs are most
impressive. Loading is by Nova load and is
smooth and quick. The selection o f
criterea is made with the space bar and
colour is used to highlight your choices.
The search speed is reasonable and the
screen presentation is  neat. M y  one
standard. The accuracy of the
detection is  s o ﬁne that i t
becomes a problem when you
want to make your man climb a
rope for example. To perform
this task the man has to be
directly u n d e r  t h e  r ope.
Technically this is correct but I
think  i t  w o u l d  b e c o m e
frustrating after a while if you
couldn't get the hang of it!
As a note to end on, the
music was quite good but I do
not see any visible connection
between Chariots of Fire and
this game, except that the man
is very athletic.

The idea in Jinn Genie is to
free the Golden City of the evil
caused by a nasty piece of work
called Ilfreet. This person has
hidden himself away inside the
Inner Sacturn. Your job, is to
get passed his guards, collect a
magic jar, free the wise man
(imprisoned on the same level
as Ilfreet), and capture the
Arabian bad guy.
It is essentially a four level

THE BASIC AIM OF THIS GAME IS TO
climb your way from the bottom of the

have to avoid falling bricks which come
hurtling down. Once the bricks settle
these are used as your stepping stones to
the top. Sounds easy — try it! -  More
often than not you are hit or trapped —
hence you have to start the game again.
There are six levels and on reaching level 3
the bricks start disappearing from the
bottom of the screen making it even more
difﬁcult to reach the top.

On opening the package you
immediately get two surprises.
Firstly, there is both a disc and a
cassette, giv ing immediate
appeal to all 64 owners. The
second revelation is the superb
instruction manual. This AS
sized book is  approximately
three quarters of an inch thick,
uses heavy duty card and is a
E j o y
to use. A combination of
. c o l o u r  coding and summary
lists mak es  access t o  a l l
commands easy. Use is further
enhanced by using each page
to describe a single command_
So much for the document-
Dr Watson a n d  us ing his
activities as the vehicle for
teaching. T his  Wells - lik e
character is whisked into space
by his new improved teleport
machine and dumped in the
space ship belonging t o  an
alien called Aleat and her
robot. The hyper-drive of the
ship is malfunctioning and the
only means of salvation lies in a
Commodore 64 in the ship.
From this point, the reader
is gently and subtly guided
through the concepts of BASIC
and the use of the commands.
Each step is cunningly slipped
into the text so that things
progress at an easy pace. The
ation; how  did the software
perform? Loading was trouble
free and the machine was reset
with about 29K of memory left,
The manual claimed that some
135 ex tr a c ommands  a r e
supplied, and whilst I haven't
counted them, I can believe it.
The commands cover the usual
areas o f  h i g h  r es olution

omissions such as RENUMBER,

commands for the use of raster
interrupts were offered. Two
particular peculiarities wer e
the use of PUT for POKE (to
allow f o r  s o me  s o r t  o f
incompatability) and the use of
PERF instead of PROC. Both are
text is nicely illustrated with
line drawings and is very well
presented. The general idea is
that the child can sit at the
computer and dabble with the
machine whilst reading t he
book. I n  ef f ec t lear ning
through play.
The tape contains three
simple programs on one side
which are also discussed in
depth in the text. This is a nice
touch since it saves a lot of
typing. On the other side are
four further programs which

him more mobile. As the controller of the
joystick you have become Wilf's guiding

The object of the game is to
shoot and destroy each wave of

trucks. You have a set time
period in which to destroy each
have to direct the yellow peril

the elements together by their
paths and when this happens,
Zenji occurs. So, that's the
theory behind the game and I
can say that I  enjoyed i t
immensly.
When t h e  program had
loaded, I  was greeted by an
imitation o f  Chinese music.
Pressing 'F1', got me onto the

of paths are unconnected. By

It sounds easy, but when
there are time limits on each

more of a challenge. Another
bonus is that on the ﬁrst few

Improve your BASIC
programming with
advice from A.P. and
D.J. Stephenson on
strings, randoms and
time.
BASIC PROVIDES A  SET OF
keywords which can perform
complex surgical operations
on strings. Separate characters,
or blocks of them, within a
string v a r ia b le  c a n  b e
dis c ar ded, r e a r r a n g e d .
reversed in order or changed
into equivalent numerical or
other forms. Before discussing
the function and syntax of the
keywords i t  is  pertinent t o
enquire why we would ever
want t o  mess around w ith
letters within a word. Take your
name and initials as a starting
point. If, at some stage in a
program the screen message
"Enter your name" appears,
you would probably answer in
the normal way — for example:
Jimmy Bloggs o r  J  Bloggs,
Within the computer, it would
be more convenient, both for
s or ting a n d  s e a r c h in g
purposes, if the surname was
stored ﬁrst and the initials or
forename/s last. This would
entail using one of the suitable
string handling keywords for
rearranging the input obtained
from the keyboard.
String handling i s  als o
useful for reducing the amount
of input required from the
keyboard. F or  example, a
program which tests know-
ledge in the form of questions
and answers on capital cities of
countries should not penalise
spelling errors, T o  av oid
rejection o f  a n  answer o n
spelling grounds a  program
can be arranged to accept, say,
the ﬁrst three letters of a city—
TUN could be accepted for
TUNISIA, It is convenient, in
fact almos t essential, f o r
individual, records within a ﬁle
to be accessed by the full name
or by  the ﬁrst one or  two
E
even possible to arrange for a
68 f e w  characters in the middle of
the full name to be sufﬁcient
for locating it from within the
ﬁle. This is not only to save time
during keyboard entry  b u t
•H
because the full name may
have been forgotten, in which
case the record would be 'lost'
forever. Conv er ting p la in
language messages into coded
form and subsequent c ode
cracking is another area which
can beneﬁt from subtle use of
string handling keywords.
There are scores of other uses
but i t  is  t ime w e  started
examining the keywords and
examples. Sev er al s h o r t
programs, o r  rather bits o f
programs w e  s h a ll c a l l
modules, will follow. They are
described in  the text rather
than by  the usual REMarks.
When y o u  a r e  le a r n in g
programming dodges, REMs
often mak e modules  look
frightfully complicated — the
opposite e f f e c t  t o  t h a t
intended. After you learn these
dodges a n d  s tar t w r it ing
lengthy programs of your own
then REMarks are o f  great
value.
Finding length o f  a
string
A program will frequently want
information on the length of a
string. For example, how many
characters there are in, say, AS.
The keyword to use is LEN, the
format being:
L = LENIAS)
Example:
100 INPUT"ENTER A WORD OR SENTENCE ":A$
110 L = LEM/4)
120 P R  I NT"YO U H A V E  ENTERED "L" CHARACTERS.
130 GOTO 100
This is, of course, an endless
loop so you can only get out of
it by pressing the RUN/STOP
key. Try i t  with dozens o f
different inputs to conﬁrm that
all characters, letters, numbers,
punctuation and even spaces
are included in the total length.
Note carefully that although AS
is a siring variable, its length L is
a numeric variable.
Splitting o f f  leftmost
characters
The key word here is LEFTS,
and the syntax is:
LEFTS(variable,N)
where N  is  the number of
characters to be split off from
the left. For example, if  AS
contains the word ARGUS, and
we write BS=LEFTS(AS,3), then
BS w ill contain t h e  letters
"ARC". Clearly, we can't split
off mo r e  letters than t h e
original word. The following
few lines can be used to try out
LEFTS with different inputs:
Note that the original word in
AS is preserved intact and not
corrupted in any way by the
splitting.
Splitting rightmost
characters
The keyword here is RIGHTS
and the syntax is;
RIGHTSIvariable,N)
This can be tried out using the
same test program as above but
with lin e  120 changed t o
RIGHTSfAS,N).
100 INPLT"ENTER A  WORD -
100 INPUT " H O W  M AN Y CHARACTERS T O  BE SPLIT

130 PRINT AS
140 PRINT BS

P r o g r a m m i n g
Let's try something a little
more ambitious; assume 100
assorted words are in an array
AS(N) and we want to print out
only those words having four
letters in which the ﬁrst letter is
F. It could be done as follows:
Make sure that some earlier
program segment has indeed
placed the assorted words in
the array AS(NJ — it won't work
without it/ Note that the AND
connective in the IF statement
ensures that only those words
which satisfy both conditions
are printed out.
Sometimes, we may wish to
split off one or more characters
from within, rather than from
one e n d  o f ,  a  string. The
relevent keyword is MIDS and
the syntax is:
MIDS(variable),S,N)
N is the number of characters
to b e  s plit o f f ,  starting S
characters from the beginning.
For example, suppose t he
string variable AS contains
"CUCUMBER" and we write,
13$=M1DS(A 5,3,5). This will split
off 5 characters, starting from
the third character. That is to
say. 13$ will contain "CUMBE".
MIDS is an awkward and often
misused BASIC keyword so a
few e x t r a  ex amples  a r e
justiﬁed. Assume t hat  A S
contains "EXCOCET":
You may have noticed that in
the last example we could have
used LEFTS(AS,1) instead of the
MID$ form. Situations such as
this often arise in which there is
a certain crossover in function
between keywords.
Let's see if we can enter a
word o t  sentence a t  t h e
keyboard and pr int i t  o u t
backwards — it may be of some
use in a word game:
100 INPUT"ENTER A  WORD OR SENTENCE ";AS
110 L LEN(AS)
120 FOR N = 1 1 0 1   STEP-1
130 PRINT MIDS(AS,N,1);
140 NEXT
100 FORN=1 TO 100
110 IF  LEN(A.$(N) )=4 AND LEFTS(TS(N) )="F" THEN PRINT
O N )
120 NEXT
Since the FOR loop is stepping
backwards, the ﬁrst character
printed is the last character of
the original. The semicolon at
the end of line 130 ensures the
printout is all on the same line
providing, of course, there is
room on the one line. If you
miss out the semicolon, the
printout will be in the vertical
plane.
Converting a number
to a character
Computers c an only  store
numbers. The ability to 'store'
letters, punctuation marks and
various other characters is an
illusion. The fact is  that all
characters available o n  t h e
keyboard are given a speciﬁc
code number. The code in
general use since the early days
of computing is the American
Standard Code for Information
Interc hange, m e r c if u lly
abbreviated to ASCII. The full
code is  given i n  t he User
Manual and is  repeated ad
nauseum i n  near ly  ev ery
computer book published so
only a few relevant entries in
abbreviated form are repeated
If w e  write BSMIDS(AS,3,3) then B$ will contain "COC"
If we write BS=(AS.2,5) then BS will contain "XCOCE"
If w e write BS=MIDStAS,5,3) then 8$ will contain "CET"
If w e write 85=MIDS(AS,1,1) then BS will contain "E"
below:
Digits
0 = 46
1 = 49
9 =
Z 9 0
The keyword for  converting
the ASCII number  t o  t h e
corresponding character is
CHRS, using the syntax,
1
CHRS(N)
For example, if we enter the
line:
PRINT CHRS(66),
the screen w ill display t he
character "B". The following
few lines will show the corresp-
ondence b e t w e e n  ASC I I
numbers and the upper case
letters:
100 FOR N 6 5  TO 90
110 PRINT CHRS(N)
120 NEXT
The ASCII codes, 0 to 31 have
not been standardised and are
left for Control Codes, speciﬁc
for a given computer. In fact
the Commodore 64, pays only
lip service t o  much o f  the
standard ASCII code because
of the need to squeeze in a
range o f  s pec ial gr aphic
symbols. However, the digits,
upper case letters and standard
punctuation marks remain as
pure ASCII.
Converting a character
to code form
As w e  hav e s een, CHR$
converts a code number to the
corresponding character. For
the reverse process, that is to
say, converting a character to
its equivalent code, the key
word ASC is used, the syntax
being:
ASC("character")
ASCII CODE
Upper case letters
A = 65
B = 66
For example, if we enter PRINT
ASC("A"), the number 65 is
displayed. Note that the literal
character must be enclosed in
quotes. You are not obliged to
consult the User Guide every
time y o u  n e e d  t h e  c ode
number for a character, Simply
enter the above PRINT line in
direct mode and the code,
including any of the special
graphic characters, w ill b e
displayed, s ubjec t t o  t h e
proviso that the character is
displayable, (Control codes do
not have printable characters.t
The character can be in string
variable form instead of literal.
For example, PRINT ASC(DS)
will display the code for the
character s tor ed i n  D S.
However, if 13 contains more
than one character, only the
code for the ﬁrst character is
displayed.
Numeric and string
conversions
It is often required to convert a
numerical value to its string
form o r  vice versa. As  w e
discussed in an earlier part of
the series, string variables and
numeric variables cannot be
mixed. We cannot write, A= OS
without invoking a nasty error
message f r o m  t h e  BASIC
interpreter. However, i t  is
possible to restore harmony, in
spite of the mismatch, by using
A =  VAL(13S). T h e  t w o
conversion keywords are VAL
and STRS, the syntax being:
:

VAListring variable)
and
STRS(numeric variable)
Example: AS = STRS (N) will
convert the number in N  to
string form in AS. If N is 457,
then AS will contain "457".
Example: N  =  VAL(AS) will
convert t h e  s t r ing f o r m
number i n  AS t o  the pure
numeric for m i n  N .  I f  AS
contains "457", N will contain
457.
It is sometimes convenient to
store numbers in an array in
string form, using SIRS for the
conversion. However, when
the numbers in string form are
eventually extracted from the
array it will be necessary to
convert them back to numeric
form with the aid of VAL. You
will remember that normal
ar ithmetic  c a n  n o t  b e
performed on numbers unless
they are in numeric form. VAL
will return a value of zero if the
ﬁrst character in the string is
non numeric. For example, if
AS contains "D235" and we
write N = VAL(AS), then N 0
because subsequent characters
after the ﬁrst are ignored.
Random numbers
A pseudo random number can
be obtained with the aid of the
keyword R N D .  us ing t h e
syntax:
RND(number)
The random number generator
in t h e  Commodor e, a n d
indeed in most other makes of
computer, relies o n  a  well
established algorithm which,
apart from noting it is far from
perfect, is of little interest to us.
To e n s u r e  t h e  r a n d o m
sequence is  different every
time i t  is  used, (not always
strictly essential) w e  a r e
advised to use the timing clock
to initially 'seed' the generator.
This is done by ﬁrst writing,
R = RND(-II)
Normal calls f or  a  random
require any positive number
within the brackets. It doesn't
matter what number so we
might just as well use "1" every
time. The number we get in R
by using R = RND(1) is always a
multi-digit fraction within the
range 010 1 although it is never
0 and never 1. However, such a
number is seldom practical so
in most cases, a certain amount
of jiggery pokery is needed in
order to obtain values within
the desired range,
1. To obtain a positive random
integer between I and N, use:
R = INT(N)*RND(1) )+1
2. To obtain a positive random
integer within a range X to Y
inclusive, use:
R I N T (  (Y+1--X)*RND(1) )+X
where Y is the higher limit and
Xis the lower. Note that Y must
have an extra 1 added.
For example, to obtain a
random number between 1
and 6, such as the throwing of a
dice use
I
To obtain a random number
between 65 and 90 (note this
will is  the ASCII range for
upper case letters) use
R =INT( (91-65)*RND(1) )+65
This, of course, simpliﬁes to
R = INT(26*RND(1) )+65
100 INPUT"ENTER HIGHEST
LIMIT ";Y
110 INPUT"ENTER LOWEST
LIMIT ";X
120 FOR N = 1 TO 20
130 PRINT INT( (Y+1-X)-OrRND(
1) )+X
140 NEXT
If you have a suspicious nature,
you may  want t o  test the
randomness of RND. When a
set o f  random numbers are
displayed, it can often appear
that certain numbers seem to
be thrown up too often. This
effect is particularly noticeable
if the range of numbers is small.
Even pure random numbers
can play  tricks sometimes,
though legitimate tricks. For
example, a  perfect random
number gener ator  c o u ld
output 10 sevens in a row. A
random sequence does not
mean all the numbers must be
different. The probability o f
any particular sequence is just
as likely as any other so 10
consecutive sevens may  b e
surprising but not necessarily a
cause for suspicion unless the
same thing happens every
time. Howev er, ther e a r e
several ways in which you can
test the 'randomness' of RND,
The easiest way to generate a
large number of randoms and
then ﬁnd the average. In other
words, add them up and divide
by the number of numbers to
ﬁnd the average. The average
should be close to half the
range. For example, generate
1000 number between 1 and
The following few lines are
useful for trying out the effect
of RND with various limits:
1000. If the average is close to
500, it indicates there is little

and other times, 501.6. The

Random test words
To consolidate some of the
previous work, study the listing
below. It is a program module
for generating a set of random
characters. I t  can be spliced
into any  program whic h is
designed t o  t r y  o u t  string

140 AS(A) = AS(A)+CHRS(N)
152 NEXT
155 PRINT AS(A)
157 NEXT
The module, as it stands, will
generate and load the array
AS(A) with 10 random "words"
each o f  10 characters. T he
outer loop is responsible for
ensuring ther e w ill b e  1 0
numbers and the inner loop
generates the10 random letters
which form each word. The
words are, nonsense but this
doesn't matter —  the more
random, the better it performs
as a test pattern. Note that line
150 concatenates each random
character to form a 10 letter
word. T he characters ar e

an upper case letter. The line

indication that we developed it

which n o  apologies  a r e

Time and time delays
All t h e  complex functions
within a  c o m p u t e r  a r e
controlled b y  a  c e n t r a l
oscillator known as the master
oscillator o r  'c loc k '. T h e
frequency is  very h ig h  —
millions of pulses per second in
order t o  create the illusion
(sometimes?) t h a t  y o u r
programs pr oduc e results
'instantaneously'. To make use
of this oscillator for normal
time keeping, a special silicon
chip is used for counting-down
the h i g h  frequency t o  a
reasonable value. The basic
unit is called the 'jiffy' which is
1/60 of a second. As soon as the
computer is switched on, the
clock starts and the jifﬁes go up
and up. There are two special
variables, Ti and Tl$ which the
computer keeps continuously
updated so they contain the
current elapsed time.
DS contains a  six digit
number in the form hours, (ﬁrst
two digits), minutes, (middle
two digits), and seconds (last
two digits). For example, if 3
hours, 4 5  minutes  a n d  7
seconds hav e elapsed, TIS
would c ontain t h e  s tr ing
"034507". It is possible to set TIS
to any time, including the 'real'
time by a simple assignment. To
set the dock to quarter past ﬁve
exactly, write TIS = "051500".
The other variable, TI, is pure
numeric i n  form, recording
elapsed time in total jifﬁes. You
cannot directly alter the value
of TI although it is automa-
tically reset when you assign a
new value for TIS. To watch the
clock go up and up, try this.
100 TS = " 000000' '
110 FOR N 1  TO 10000
120 PRINT TIS
130 NEXT
Time delays
Occasions arise when i t  is
necessary t o  s low down a
program by introducing a time
delay. The lazy way is to use a
FOR/NEXT loop which simply
counts up from 1 to N but does
nothing more. For example,
100 FOR N 1  TO 1000:NEXT
If this line is interposed within a
program, everything is held up
while the computer counts up
to 1000 — which won't be very
long. T h e  m o r e  elegant
solution is to make use of TI. a
delay o f  5  seconds can b e
introduced by the lines,
100 D=TI
110 IF TI <  D+300 THEN 110
The instantaneous value of TI is
ﬁrst assigned t o  D .  T h e
computer is then trapped in
line 100 until TI climbs up an
extra 300 jifﬁes (5 seconds). This
method is accurate and more
convenient t h a n  mes s ing
around with FOR/NEXT loops.
In games programs, a random
delay is often required in order
to place the player in a state of
tension s o that he/she c a
never be quite sure when th
next megapowered laser will
burst on to the screen. This can
be arranged by changing D+300
above to D+R, where R is a
previously derived random.

It easy to complain
about advertisements.
But which ones?
Every week millions of advertisements appear in print, on posters or in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules contained in the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
But some of them break the rules and warrant your complaints.
If you're not sure about which ones they are, however, drop us a line and we'll
send you an abridged copy of the Advertising Code. Then, if an advertisement
bothers you, you'll be justiﬁed in bothering us.

Vizastar, Help and
Su perhelp.
HELP/SUPERHELP
STACK 100
E15.00/f 25.00
Commodore 64
HELP AND SUPERHELP ARE A PAIR OF
programmers aid cartridges. They are
both basically the same unit except that
the SUPERHELP cartridge contains a few
extra commands as well as a two pass
assembler. Stack 100 split the cartridges
up in t o  f our  parts i n  t h e  case o f
Superhelp and three parts for Help.
Part 1
Part 1  c ontains  additional BASIC
commands.
HELP. This command will display the last
line carried out after an interruption. In
some cases it is not very reliable.
FIND. This will allow you to get a list of all
the lines in which you have used a parti-
cular string variable or command word. I
often use this when I have used variable
name twice.
DELETE. This is  a  line Delete using
standard TO-FROM syntax. I t  works
reliably and is  very important if  you
renumber set subroutines.
GENLINE. M o s t  people k n o w  t h is
function as  AUTO. I t  produces line
numbers automatically when writing a
program. You can indicate the starting
line number and the increment. hind this
a useful lime saver.
TRACE. Almost vital for those of us who
write slightly less than perfect programs.
This enables y ou t o  STEP through a
program line by line inorder tosee where
things went wrong.
SINGLE STEP. As TRACE but the program
only goes to the next line after a keypress
a sort of IN DEPTH trace.
END. This command simply turns of trace
and step.
RENUMBER. One of the few renumbers I
have come across that works well and
reliably. I could not make it misﬁre and,
best of  all, it copes with GOTOS and
GOSUBS.
VARIABLE DUMP. Particularly useful.
DUMP the current values and names of all
variables used in a program.
iiii1111111k.
MATRIX DUMP. Same as variable dump
but dumps arrays.
PAGE LIST. This allows you to set PAGES
for listing. It enables you not only to move
DOWN a listing but also back up. Very
useful although LINE EDITING is  not
possible without killing the page effect.
HEX-OE' CONVERSION. This converts
HEXIDECIMAL to DECIMAL.
FILE OPENER. The '(' key enables you to
open a numbered output ﬁle without the
usual rigmarole.
KILL. This kill command SOFT-SWITCHES
off the cartridge.
COMPACT. (SUPERHELP) This command
increases the possible density of a single
line to 240. It is quite useful but makes line
editing virtually impossible.
UNDEFINED. (SUPERHELP) Checks to see
if there are any undeﬁned line calls in a
program. Works well and almost a must
before radical renumbering.
FRE(x). This isturned into the even shorter
command...*...I cant see that it is really
needed.
Part 2
This part is a disassemblerimonitor. The
disassembler is very good and easy to use.
It is easy to modify the contents of add-
resses in hex and the display is so clear that
I have used it as a teaching aid. It can be

used to move blocks of data around in
memory but the documentation for this
isn't very clear. The monitor is not in the
Commodore style and some of its uses are
not very obvious.
Part 3
Part 3 is a DOS SUPPORT SECTION. It
gives the 64 some of the disc handling
commands that Commodore left out thus
making it easier to get a directory of the
disc, open and close ﬁles, read channels,
save, load and verify.
Part 4
This is a two pass assembler for use with
SUPERHELP only. If I had seen this as a
novice to assembly language I would have
run a mile. It is a two pass assembler and as
such it stores the source program onto
disc for reading during the second pass, so
it can only be used with a disc drive. The
documentation is  n o t  very clear o r
comprehensive.
In use
The additional BASIC commands are the
most useful part of the program. They all
work well although a couple of them
seem a little pointless. The monitor was a
little confusing at ﬁrst and will not be
quite what some people expect. But, all in
all, these two cartridges are a good buy
with a good balance of commands.
VIZASTAR
VIZA SOFTWARE LIMITED
£99.95
Commodore 64
VIZASTAR IS AVAILABLE IN VARIOUS
conﬁgurations of Disc/Cartridge etc mine
being part cartridge and part disc.
The manual is  thick, readable and
fairly well laid out. It is split into three
sections. Section one deals with the
spreadsheet part of Vizastar as that is what
initially appears on screen, Section two
deals with the database part of the
program and section three deals with the
integration of the ﬁrst two parts.
On screen
With the cartridge in on power-up you
are invited to press the space key to load
the rest of the program from disc. Within
seconds an intro screen appears. Loading
is reasonably fast as a lot of the GEN is held
E
The initial colours are very good
irrespective of whether you are using a
colour screen or a green screen monitor
and, w it h  t h e  inbuilt colours, t h e
information is easy to read. You also have
the option to change colours.
When the software has loaded you are
presented with a  special spreadsheet.
Lines u p and down the screen make
'zero'ing' in on a particular cell very easy,
and whereas with most spreadsheets the
active cell is highlighted by being inverse,
in the case of Vizastar a small arrow points
to the relevant cell. I have never seen a
spreadsheet display quite the same as this
before on the 64 but I loved it. It had a very
efﬁcient and professional feel to it.
Initially t h e  screen remains fairly
uncluttered, with little information about
options displayed. But with one press of
the CBM key, a large panel saying SELECT
appears s u p e r im p o s e d  o n  t h e
spreadsheet. A broad menu is displayed
on the topline this covers options such as
CELL, SHEET, FILE, PRINTER, GRAPH and
DATE. Below this is a sub-menu showing
further options which will be available if
you choose a  particular option. (For
example choosing CELL gives you a sub-
menu containing options to format erase
move etc). Choosing one of these further
options in many cases gives you another
sub-menu. This multi layer menu system is
easy to use, very smooth and enhances
the program.
Entered in
I felt that the best test for the spreadsheet
part of the program was to copy data from
the spreadsheet I currently use onto this
one. I entered data onto the sheet quickly
and accurately. Because of the well laid
out menu options I rarely had to refer
back to the manual. It is not necessary to
cover all the available commands. I t
would be confusing for people who have
not used a  spreadsheet before and
repetitive reading for those who have.
There are no glaring omissions on this
sheet and all the standard functions such
as replicate, format, move etc were there.
It was possible to produce line, bar and
multibar graphs and pie charts from
ﬁgures on the sheet, This is the most
comprehensive use of graphic facilities I
have s een o n  a  sheet. Ba r  c har t
production is easy and well documented.
Windows can be set up on the sheet
which facilitates comparing sets of ﬁgures
and using windows and graphs. A very
comprehensive and easy to read summary
could be prepared. One interesting thing
about the graph function is that you move
about the sheet and change ﬁgures the
graph als o changes. Admittedly this
function does slow things up a little.
Hardcopy
Using the options it was possible to ﬁnd a
way of obtaining a printout with most
printers. If your printer is capable it is
possible to get a screen dump of graphs
etc. Normal routines are used for getting
printouts of ﬁgures and data and through
the printout menu it is possible to indicate
whether y ou have Commodore/non-
Commodore printer, single sheet o r
tractor fed paper etc. It is not possible to
give any deﬁnite list of which printers
work but I tried it with a SMITH CORONA
TPI, a Shinwa CP80 and a COMMODORE
MPS801, All performed well.
Even more
As a spreadsheet this is excellent. As a
combined spreadsheet and database it is
positively amaz ing. Us ing s pec ial
commands available from the menu it is
possible to get from the spreadsheet into
the database. There is full integration
between the two and the potential to
program the whole set-up makes the
writing of applications possible. Basically
if you have an invoice and statements
routine set up on the database it is easy to
store the information on the spreadsheet.
If you have used a database management
system before you will have half an idea of
what this integration is about. Writing a
program t o  produce a  running
application through is rather different
and requires a fair amount of re-learning.
But it's well worth the trouble.
Auto demo
The demo routine on the disc makes
everything far clearer than I ever could in
a review. It runs automatically and shows
how muc h integration there can b e
between t h e  databas e a n d  t h e
spreadsheet. There is a demonstration
invoice routine which could be padded
out to produce a fully blown application
but it's main use is as a tutorial. The main
commands, and how to use them, are
explained in the demo. At ﬁrst glance it
seems mind boggling but, after working
through the examples a couple of times,
becomes much clearer. Quite a lot of hard
work and concentration is needed to
program the database.
Worth the effort
Although i t  will take a  long time t o
become proﬁcient at using this to its full
potential I am determined to persevere
with it. If you use a spreadsheet and a
database or if you think you are likely to in
the future then bear thisone in mind. Asa
stand alone spreadsheet it would be quite
expensive but even if that was all it did I
would still consider buying it. As a
combined package I  think it is very
reasonably priced. As  a  stand alone
database it  does not appear to be as
powerful as  some o f  t he dedicated
packages, but if you require a database
which is biased towards storage and use of
numeric data this would be a very good
choice.

Alison Hjul has braved
the streets of Sheen
and visited the Micro
Computer Centre and
its staff.
IN PURSUIT OF A TARGET
for my exposé o f a  high
street Commodore dealer, I
had to look no further than
my local Micro Computer
Centre. I sympathised with
Mr. Grant and his staff for,
like myself, they are blessed
with the dubious privilege
of a situation by Mortlake

Phil Grant. th e  Mi cro

ager. w i t h  2 0  y e a r s '

this company fo r 8  years,
which makes it one of the
oldest m i c r o  co mp u te r
companies around. In fact,
when t h e  company was
founded, Commodore itself
consisted merely of a small
ofﬁce with a staff of four.
Small is beautiful
The M i c r o  C o m p u t e r
Centre can hold the advice
of a  y o u n g  e n g i n e e r
responsible for its birth. Asa
mini computer consultant
on the verge o f buying a
new mini, M r  Grant was
prompted, by the engineer
helping him to transport his
new purchase, to cross the
barrier from minis to micros.
Therein, he was told, lay the
future. M r .  Grant, albeit
somewhat i g n o ra n t o f
micros at the time, made the
crucial move o f  trekking
across t o  Commodore a t
Euston where he purchased
a 2000 series Commodore
micro computer. He never
looked back. Within three

its window inviting passers-
by to  'come i n  and play
games' on his new micros.
But this was merely a ploy to
entice customers: Mr. Grant
really had his eye to  the
business market and let it be
known t h a t  b u s i n e s s
applications w e r e  a l so
available. As is still the case
in h i g h  street computer
stores all over the country,
Saturday mornings would
see a n  i n ﬁl tr a ti o n  o f
'precocious c o m p u t e r
buffs' implanting  t h e i r
sticky ﬁn g e r s  o n  M r

help was a t hand: escor-

managers o f  small busi-
nesses. One by one. bored
with little Jimmy's prow-
ess a t  zapping assorted
creatures from outer space,
they approached Mr. Grant
seeking solutions t o  their
various business problems.
Mr. Grant's ability to prove
to them that a  computer
could solve their problems
resulted i n  a n  inﬂux o f
orders and an escalation of
business. A n d  th u s  t h e
Micro Computer Centre
was born.
Soft-centred hardware
store
Mr Grant's store i s  n o t
merely a  hardware retail
outlet. A p a r t f r o m  t h e
computers themselves, and
various peripherals, t h e
Micro Computer Centre
offers a  comprehensive
range o f business applica-
tions software — both in the
shape o f  o ff-th e -sh e l f
packages a n d  so ftw a re
penned by its own highly
experienced programming
staff. M r  Grant states that:
"A l a r g e  p a r t  o f  t h e
company's success stems
from w ri ti n g  o u r  o w n
software". W h e n  a ske d
what sort of software they
produce and for whom they
cater, Mr. Grant succinctly
replied: "Sma l l  applica-
tions fo r  large businesses
and large applications fo r
small businesses". He insists
that, in offering their own
custom software, they are
not o u t  t o  exploit cust-
omers. I f  there is already
something available on the
market that will meet the
customer's needs, Mr Grant
will suggest he buys it. If not,
the M i c r o  C o m p u t e r
Centre's p ro g ra mmi n g
team will try to produce a
piece of software suitable.
The M i c r o  Computer
Centre's success, s o  M r
Grant claims, lies i n  i ts
emphasis on service rather
than hard selling. He sees
his company a s  a  co n -
sultancy ﬁrst and foremost;

When some marketing

But, although sales o f

holds Out a lot of hope for
Commodore's return to the

Microsound 64
Chris Palmer gets stuck in to
two music packages. loin him
at the keyboards.
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE 64
boast one of the most powerful internal
sound chips around. However, anyone
who has delved into the workings of the
SID chip will realise that its favour is not
won easily. This leaves the way open for
software writers to help the user win over
SID. The two products we are looking at in
this review exhibit two different ways of
leading you towards a common goal. That
is, making music on the 64, with the
minimum of fuss.
One succeeds and the other fails. For
the answer to this and other burning
questions, read on!
The Microsound package compromises a
lull size piano style keyboard, a tape or
disc containing the driver software and a
typewritten manual. The keyboard came
as a very pleasant surprise for me. So often
this sort of system will be let down by
forcing you to play on a 'Mickey Mouse'
keyboard. It has a span of a full four
octaves and is cased in hard, black, ABS
Plastic.
To the left of the keys are two sliders.
They allow you to change certain variable
components of the sound by moving
them, Nice thought this, but why are they
so stiff? On larger synthesisers this sort of
arrangement is used to let the player put
expression into a piece of music. To do
this, the sliders have to be able to move
under the slightest ﬁnger pressure to
allow for both fast and subtle effects.
Perhaps these sliders will loosen up a bit
after use, but that leads me to wonder
how good the contact will be.
The keyboard connects to the 64
through the two joystick ports. Once
ﬁtted the machine can be turned on and
the software loaded. After selecting either
disc or tape mode you are passed to the
main screen.
It is from this screen that the majority
of t h e  sound creation an d  p lay
characteristics are set up and altered. The
bottom left part of the screen is devoted
to the attack, decay, sustain and release
levels for each of the three voices. The top
of the screen shows which waveforms are
active for the voices, along with ﬁlter
routeing, sync and ring modulation. The

•
H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
screen is  completed by  a ﬁlter status
display and control key menu.
From this screen y ou can pass t o
menus which control tuning, patching
and the sequencer. But, back to the main
screen.
On power-up, the keyboard is set to
monophonic mode with a fairly sharp
brass sound. You can set the keyboard to
polyphonic mode by toggling the .1
Because the 64 has only three oscillators,
the polyphonic mode only lets you play
three notes at  a  time. The software
scanning of the keyboard seems to be a
little slow, which makes fast playing a bit
hit and miss. The quality of the sound
depends very much o n  what output
you're using. Through a TV speaker, even
the best sounds seem rough, so putting
the whole lot through a Hi-Fi improves
things greatly.
Much as I admired the thoughts and
sentiments behind the Micrsound 64, I
could ﬁnd very little to praise once I
started to use it. For a start the manual is
appalling! Even with my knowledge of
synthesisers I  found it  quite tricky to
understand the way some of the more
advanced features worked. Confronting
an inexperienced user with phrases like
The instantaneous value of the output of
oscillator 3  controls the pulse width'
without any  further explanation, is
inexcusable.
Matters would have been helped lithe
disc contained some other sample sounds
that could be loaded and examined, The
manual didn't even show any example
patches to play about with.
The software was slow to respond to
the sound editing commands and I often
found myself 'typing ahead', only to ﬁnd
that inadvertantly changed the wrong
parameter and ruined the sound I was
trying to create.
One of the most useful features of any
music program of this sort has got to be
the sequencer. Unfortunately , t h e
Microsound sequencer was little better
than the main part of the software. The
most disturbing thing about it. was that
you could get in, but you couldn't get out.
That's right, the only way I found I could
get back to the main menu was to break
the program and RUN it again. Of course
by doing this, you lose the sound you had
created in the main menu, unless, of
course, you had the foresight to save it.
Even so, this is 1984 and software is
supposed to be friendly, isn't it?
The sequencer will allow you to 'layer'
three parts on top of one another and
then play it back in unison. Sequences can
be edited by running a cursor back to the
relevant point and either deleting the
note or playing the correct one over the
top. Once you are happy with a sequence
you can save it to your storage medium,
Despite my dislikes about this system,
it does have some saving graces. If you
want t o  ﬁnd out how  a  synthesiser
generates and controls sound. and are
willing to persevere on your own, then
the Microsound 64 could give you a lot of
enjoyment. But if you expect to be able to
sit down and play like Howard Jones or
Rick Wakeman, then I don't think that the
Microsound is for you.
There is one interesting development
looming on the horizon that could turn
the Microsound into a very attractive
proposition for any amateur musician. On
the back of the keyboard there is a 25 way
D-type connector which is set aside for
external triggering and digital sampling.
Now, if Autographics can make a digital
sampling add-on cheap enough, then I
think the Microsound will become a
popular addition to the set up of those of
us who slave late into the night creating
mini epics in our home studios,
Music Maker
It might seem strange to some people that
having b e e n  s lig h t ly  les s  t h a n
t5N

complementary about the Microsound 64
with its proper keyboard, I am about to
start raving about a system which uses
what can only be described as a 'Mickey
Mouse' keyboard. The article in question
is, of course, the plastic, keyboard overlay
which is  supplied with Commodore's
Music Maker package. To say that it
wouldn't look out of place being given
away free with a packet of cornﬂakes just
about sums it up.
Its manner of operation is simple. The
actual keyboard par t o f  the unit is
contained within a tough vinyl surround
which ﬁts over the body of the 64. When
you press a key on the music keyboard, it
in turn presses a key on the alphanumeric
keyboard underneath. Now I must admit,
when I ran across this at the PCW show, I
discounted it as being too tacky to be of
any real worth. But when you actually
come to use it, you soon realise it works,
and very well at that! You have not got the
potential available that a  f u ll size
keyboard offers you, but it's ideal for kids
and anyone w h o  hasn't progressed
beyond the one ﬁnger stage.
The reason this  stands head and
shoulders above the Microsound is in the
friendliness of the software. Each of the
menus and sub menus are clearly laid out,
so it's virtually impossible not to know
what you are doing. The software also
concentrates on getting people playing
tunes as soon as possible, rather than
dumping them in at the deep end, with
only their own ideas to get them out.

The rest of the package also reﬂects
this approach. As well as a very clear and
concise manual, you also get an 'easy-
play' song book. Contained in this are
such classics as "Annie's Song", "The
Birdie song" and t h e  cringingly apt
"When I'm 64". There is even a sheet of
stickers with which you can plaster the
keyboard if you have trouble ﬁnding A
H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
ﬂat by the C (Ouch!)
Along, with the tunes for you to input
yourself, the disc (or tape) also contains
"When I'm 64", "Georgia" and the "Snow
Waltz". All of which can be loaded and
played immediately.
To the software
As I said earlier, it is the software which
really makes this package stand out.
Everything is menu driven and for the
most part uses the function keys to select
an option.
The software turns your 64 into what
amounts to a Casio style keyboard. Along
with the music voices from the keyboard,
you are also offered an auto bass option
arid a choice of three drum patterns.
On power up, the software contains
eight pre-deﬁned voices, all of which are
quite usable. If you want to change the
voices you can divert to a sub menu where
the sound parameters are displayed for
you. An option to save and load the voice
data is also provided, so it is possible to
build u p  y our own store o f  custom
sounds. The manual also gives a table of
values to provide a starting point for your
own experiments.
The software also gives you the choice
between monophonic and polyphonic
play. Which, when you think about it, is
no mean feat, considering that t he
Commodore keyboard isn't supposed to
be able to be scanned that way. Needless
to say, the authors are very pleased with
themselves f o r  d o i n g  t h i s  a n d
unfortunately they wouldn't part with the
secret.
The sequencer part of the program is
split into two parts. Firstly, you input the
notes b y  pressing t h e  keys o n  t h e
keyboard. T h e  n o t e  y o u  press i s
highlighted on a keyboard representation
on the screen. You needn't worry about
the timing of the piece at the moment, for
this is the function of the second part.
When you have completed the tune to
your satisfaction, y ou then input the
information for the timing of the piece by
simply tapping on any key. The computer
then stores this along with the tune. When
you have ﬁnished, tapping the key again
will play back the tune with the notes now
in the proper time.
All told I found it a pleasure to work
with the Music Maker package, despite
the limitations imposed by the keyboard.
The only depressing fact is that you can
already buy song books to complement
the system, featuring the works of Duran
Duran, Michael Jackson and the like. No
doubt at computer shows to come we will
not be able t o escape the strains of
"Thriller" and "Rio". To combat this, I am
already working on some transcriptions of
Emerson, Lak e a n d  Palmer's mos t
inaccessible moments f o r  jus t that
occasion. Let battle commence!

Les Allan explains how
to protect your
valuable programs
from prying eyes.
OK! SO YOU'VE PRODUCED
a masterpiece of software that
you are fairly pleased with,
maybe using some techniques
that you would like to keep up
your sleeve. Well, how do you
go about protecting software?
The truth of the matter is that
nothing is  capable o f  being
fully protected. All that can be
done is to deter or slow down
the way in which the 'pirate'
can get into your program.
How do you start if you know
little o r  nothing about the
subject or indeed the areas of
the computer's memory that
are equipped to deal with this
problem. T h e  f o llo w in g
routines can be used either
separately or together in order
to pr ov ide t h e  degree o f
protection required.
(1) Use of screen
In order t o  read fr om the
screen to check the name ﬁle
of the program being loaded it
Is necessary t o  prov ide a
method of  ensuring that the
name ﬁle is always located in
the same part of the screen
6 4  U t i l i t y
This is achieved by using the
CLR (reverse ﬁeld heart) at the
beginning o f  the name ﬁle
thus:
S A V r ( C L R )
The protection routine c an
then be used to read from the
screen thus:
10 IFPEEK(1024) <> 14THEN
SYS64738
1024  s c r e e n  location

64738 c o l d  start BOOT code
(2) Use of the cassette
buffer
The max imum number  o f
characters t h a t  c a n  b e
displayed to the screen for the
name ﬁle from the tape being
loaded is  16. However, it  is
possible to have a name ﬁle of
up to 76 characters in length
where the hidden characters
can be used in the protection
method thus:
SAVE"(CIR)NAME FILE
PROTECTION ROUTINE"
When loaded from tape all that
is displayed is the name ﬁle but
the complete contents of the
save are located in the cassette
buffer and can be used thus:
20 IFPEEK(850)<>80THENSYS

(3) Disable keyboard
and/or list save

40 P0KE808,225:REM DISABLE RUN/STOP : P O K E
808,235 TO RE-ENABLE
50 POKE818,32 :REM DISABLE SAVE ROUTINE:P0KE818,
237 TO RE-ENABLE
These functions, onc e t h e
program has been loaded and
run, will prevent the program
from b e in g  s topped a n d
broken into.
(4) Move basic
Bottom of BASIC is normally
located at dec. 2049 but can be
relocated b y  us e o f  t h e
following pointers:
10POKE43,10 byte and 255
20P0KE44,INT(hi byte/256)
By adding REM BACK DELETE
statements the change can be
disguised a n d  t h e  'pir ate'
misled into believing that the
program i s  mac hine c ode
based thus:
10 POKE43,0:POKE44,20:
RUN: REM"(I NST* 27)
SYS4096
In order to achieve this add
REM" "  and move the cursor
back to the right hand quote
marks. Then make a number of
INST followed by  the same
number o f  DEL. When t he
program is subsequently listed
the line looks thus:
10 SYS4096
In order to make use of this
facility the program must ﬁrst
be written and saved in the
normal area of BASIC with the
screen, cassette buffer and
disable functions incorporated.
Now carry out the following
steps:
(1) 5 Y 5 6 4  7 3 8 t o  c lear

(7) SAVE" ( C LR ) N AME
FILE PROTECTION RO U-
TINE
15) LOAD M/C FILE FROM
BASIC
Machine code ﬁles can be
loaded from BASIC to reduce
the overall time taken to load
the program from tape and also
to relocate the program such
that it is transparent to the user.
Because of the way BASIC is
conﬁgured it  is necessary to
load in this manner
10 IIA=0THENA=1:LOAD"
M/C FILE 1'',1,1
20 IFA=1THENA=2:LOAD"
M/C FILE 2",1,1
6) M/C BOOT LOAD
This topic is outside the
scope of  this article but for
those o f  y ou adventurous
enough this provides the best
method of protection as the
programs saved in this way are
usually below the bottom of
BASIC and are difﬁcult to stop
particularly when t he warm
start vectors are set up at dec.

PROJECTS
CBM 64 d I I I I I I I
THIS N E W  SERIES W I L L
present a programming project
in the form of a problem to be
tackled with the aid o f  the
computer. The projects have
been devised not only to call
on programming techniques
that are interesting in a general
way, but also to show off the
best features  o f  t h e  64.
Graphics, sound production
and sprites will be prominently
featur ed. S o m e  o f  t h e
programs that are necessary to
carry out the project will be
developed. The intention is to
introduce some methods for
solving problems, to introduce
some us eful programming
techniques, and t o lead you
into fur ther  ex plorations
associated with the project and
with the 64.
We begin this month with a
'turtle chase'.
The Project
There are a number, N , of
turtles on a  ﬂoor. They are
numbered from 1 to N. Their
positions can b e  stored by
placing t h e  X -  a n d  Y -
coordinates o f  each i n  t he
relevant elements o f  arrays
named X  and Y. The turtles
move so that each pursues the
next one: turtle 1 pursues turtle
2, turtle 2 pursues turtle 3, and
so on, with turtle N pursuing
turtle 1. They all head directly
towards the turtle that they are
pursuing, and they all move at
the same time, This situation is
most conveniently simulated
by letting all the turtles move at
discrete instants, as on the ticks
of a  clock. At  each instant,
every turtle moves a  ﬁxed
distance towards the position
occupied by the turtle that it is
pursuing. Figure 1 shows the
ﬁrst f ew  movements f o r  a
group of ﬁve turtles.
The program should begin
by accepting a value for the
number of turtles, N. It can also
accept their initial positions,
Figure 1. Initial steps or  4 turtles
but symmetric patterns w ill
result i f  t h e  tur tles  a r e
systematically placed, perhaps
in positions that are equally
spaced around a circle.
The solution
Because the turtles all move at
the same time, we shall not
only need the arrays X and Y to
hold the current positions of
the turtles, but also two further
arrays to hold the positions that
they move to at each instant in
the simulation. If we do not use
a second pair of arrays, but
directly update t h e  arrays
holding the current positions
with new positions then some
of the turtles will not head for
the correct positions when
they move. This would mean
that w e  s h o u ld  n o t  b e
simulating faithfully t he
situation in which all the turtles
move simultaneously. It is also
convenient to give all the arrays
a dimension of N il, for then
the c ontents  o f  t h e  ﬁr s t
elements of the arrays X and
can be copied into the (N+1)th
and the case of turtle N chasing
turtle 1 can be dealt with in the
same way as all the others.
Figure 1 should be sufﬁcient
to show that all the turtles will
spiral in towards each other as
they move. Of this is not easy to
see, then carry out a few more
steps with a pencil and paper
simulation.) Starting the turtles
off fr om positions that are
equally spaced round a circle
gives a  n e a t  symmetrical
pattern for their paths. But if
you are not pa rticulary worried
about n e a t  effec ts , a n y
starting positions will do, and
the result will still be a pattern
of spirals. In our program, the
turtles are spaced around a
circle with its centre at the
centre of the screen and having
a radius of 90 dots. This gives us
the ﬁrst part of the program for
accepting t h e  number  o f
turtles and for setting up their
initial positions (see below)
The gap between lines 60
and 110 will b e ﬁlled in  a
moment.
We c an n o w  wr ite t h e
program segment for compu-
ting the successive positions of
the turtles. The _steps to be
taken by a turtle towards the
turtle it  is pursuing are ﬁve
screen dot positions in length.
The n e w  position f o r  t h e
pursuing turtle is calculated by
ﬁnding the difference between
the x-coordinates and t h e
difference between t h e  y -
coordinates for each turtle and
its prey . T h e  distance, D ,
between them can then b e
calculated by using Pythagoras'
theorem.
The new program can then
be calculated by reducing the
differ enc es  i n  t h e  x -
coordinates and i n  t h e  y -
coordinates i n  t h e  s ame
proportions so that the total
change i n  distance is  ﬁve.
When all the new positions
have been computed the X and

Y arrays can be updated with
these values and then t h e
process can be repeated. The
program is stopped when the
turtles are within ﬁve steps of
each other. (They cannot very
well take a step towards each
other if they are already closer
than that!) The instruction for
stopping is written as
180 IF CL, 5 THEN 180
rather than as
180 IF D< 5 THEN STOP
so that the display is not spoilt
when the program halts. This
program segment is:
Putting a ll this  together
gives u s  t h e  f o l l o w i n g
complete program. We have
added lines  120 t o  140 t o
convert, in turn, each of the
turtle positions t o  the form
required b y  t h e  plot t ing
subroutine, and then tocall the
subroutine itself, lin e  250 is
also added so that as soon as
one set of positions is plotted,
the program goes back to line
110 t o  c ompute t h e  nex t
positions and to plot them.
When this program is run, it

210 NEXT K
220 FOR K=1 TO N
230 X(K)=XN<K): Y(K)=YN<K)
240 NEXT K
Now, a lt h o u g h  t h e s e
program segments carry out
the simulation, they are not
very exciting in themselves. By
adding some graphics we can
display the successive positions
of the turtles and see the paths
that they take building up as
they approach each other.
The ﬁrst steps that ar e
necessary before any graphics
can be displayed are to set the
64 t o  its  bit-mapped high-
resolution graphics mode. to
position t h e  bit- mapped
display in  the memory, and
then t o  clear it  and set its
foreground and background
colours. This is done by placing
the following lines in the gap
we left earlier:
ﬁrst asks for the number of
turtles. When this number has
been entered, the program
then takes a minute or two to
set the high-resolution mode
and t o  c lear t h e  relevant
section of memory. You can
'see' this happening on the
screen, but do be patient.
The display produced by
this program for N=6 is shown
in Figure 2. If the stopping

talks back.
CALLING A L L  C O MMO D O R E 6 4
owners. I f  you are an amateur radio
enthusiast then an American company
called AEA has  jus t inv ented t h e
computer game for you. It is called Doctor
DX and comes in the form of a cartridge
which plugs into the expansion port of the
64.
Around the world
Let me explain a little of the background
to the game for those of you not familiar
with the world of amateur radio. During
the course of a year there are a number of
contests for radio amateurs who are keen
CW —  morse t o  the uninitiated —
operators on the shortwaves. These are
worldwide events and stations fr om
Bognor to Bangkok. Trowbridge to Tahiti
and Shefﬁeld to Siberia will participate.
The idea of the contest is to contact as
many stations as possible in  as many
countries as you can ﬁnd over a twenty-
four hour period. Radio amateurs erect
huge aerials and go to 'rare' (le, rarely
operated from) countries in order to win
these contests and the fame and acclaim
which accompanies them. Many of them
also spend large sums of money in these
endeavours.
If you don't have a huge aerial and
can't afford the ticket to a Paciﬁc Isle, you
can conjure up a prize winning station
and a contest to go with it simply by
plugging a Doctor DX into your 64.
On screen
Once it's u p  and running, a graphic
representation of a radio transmitter and
receiver appears o n  the screen. The
'transceiver' covers the six most popular
amateur wavebands. There is a phono
connector at the back into which you
must plug either a  hand key o r  an
electronic keyer in order to transmit your
morse 'messages'. Having done this, you
are invited to enter your chosen latitude
and longitude co-ordinates (you may
operate from any country in the world)
and the time in GMT at which you wish to
begin. Then, on pressing RETURN on the
64. Doctor D X proceeds t o  simulate
suitable radio conditions for your location
over a 24 hour period.
Wave forms
Radio conditions vary a lot over a 24 hour
period depending on where you are in
the world and the time of day. This is
because of the varying conditions of the

ionisphere. Long distance shortwave
communications rely on the reﬂection of
radio waves by the ionisphere. To do this,
the ionisphere needs to be ionised to a
certain degree, depending o n  t h e
frequency of the radio waves, and this
ionisation is caused to some considerable
extent by the position of the sun relative
to the frequency. A little complicated,
isn't it!
Well, within t h e  16K o f  EPROM
memory in the Doctor DX all of these
factors ar e simulated. I  f ound t h e
simulation quite remarkable and I'v e
been 'on-the-air' for  some 14 years.
Stations appear on the bands and can be
communicated with and you can also
overhear stations communicating with
each other. All of this is just like real
(contesting) life. When you are operating
in the lower band segments, the stations
are transmitting at much faster speeds and
the operators are more polished. This,
too, is also often the case in real life. •
Mastering morse
Of course, the Doctor DX is designed for
the specialist user; not everyone knows
morse or wants to learn it. However, for
the enthusiast it provides an excellent
morse trainer and anyone who wants to
learn can use the Doctor DX once they
have reached about Swords per minute. It
also allows the rest of us to take part in
competitions from anywhere in the world
without spending a  penny on airline
tickets or  t o 'transmit' with n o other
equipment than a Commodore 64_
So, i f  y ou'v e b e e n  considering
becoming a ham radio enthusiast but
have been put off by the cost of the
equipment then the Doctor DX will give
you an idea of the excitement to be had
from talking to the rest of the world. (Of
course, you have to have some morse
expertise ﬁrst!) Sitting in front of the
screen listening t o  the noise o n  the
airwaves, I could believe that I was talking
to someone on the other side of the world
and not just to the computer. Surely there
can be no better recommendation for a
computer simulation than this.
Doctor DX costs E96.95 and is available
from ICS Electronics, PO Box 2, Arundel,
West Sussex.

Commodore's Plus/4 contains
a suite of four programs.
Does this make it a credible
business machine? Bob
Wallace answers this
, M O,
question.
IN A YEAR OF UPS AND DOWNS IN THE
home micro market, there have been
some huge success stories and tales
sorrowful enough t o bring tears to a
CPU's eyes. I n  a  ﬁeld with such a
competitive spirit, all manufacturers are
trying as hard as possible to make their
machines as versatile and powerful as they
can, whilst also keeping the price of the
machine as low as possible.
Nearly all extra packages for a home
micro used to be very expensive pieces of
software. Now some of these packages
come as standard, with at least one being
incorporated in the more expensive MSX
machines.
Not t o  b e  outdone by  the rapid
Japanese invasion, Commodore have
rallied forth and produced probably their
most adventurous machine: the Plus/4.
It does not contain one software
package, but a suite of four programs all
resident in ROM. The packages are; a
Word Processing package; a Spreadsheet
package; a Database system; a Business
graphics package.
Word Processing
The ﬁrst program to be dealt with is the
Word Processing package. For those who
are unfamiliar with such things, it is a
program that allows the user to type out
letters and documents directly to the TV
or monitor screen, modify the text to a
desired standard and then produce a hard
copy printout via a printer.
Once a document has been printed
the information can be stored on tape or
disc for future use.
To enter the word processor, you just
press t he VI  k ey  and that's it. The
computer keyboard is now acting as a
typewriter keyboard, so what you type is
what appears on the screen. The idea
behind such a package is that errors are
easy to correct. This is certainly the case
on this processor. Using the computer's
text editing facilities, one can easily insert
missing letters and delete letters that you
have typed in wrongly.
The processor allows a maximum line
86 le n g t h  of 77 letters with auto wraparound
to prevent split words appearing at the
end of lines. The 77 letters are ﬁtted on to
a 40 column screen by scrolling the screen
to the left when the forty columns are
1•1111111
ﬁlled. This I found to be rather distracting
when typing in large documents. One
remedy would be an 80 column display,
which is not possible at present on the
Plus/4.
Having entered a document there are
a host of inbuilt commands. These enable
the user to insert or delete lines, edit and
move blocks of text around within the
document, set page length and size. The
very nice touch is the search and replace
command which allows the user to search
for a given string and change that string to
another speciﬁed by the user.
Other commands available to the user
include the ability to set Tabs, Centre text
lines, Right justify text, Merge ﬁles, Load
and Save Files to disc, all of which help to
produce a  pr ofes s ional l o o k i n g
document.
Having said that, the quality of the
document is not ﬁnally decided by the
processor, but by the printer. If a cheap
Dot Matrix is used then a poor quality
document will be the obvious result.
Commodore have tried to give the
user as many commands as possible to
ensure the easy use of the processor. All
commands entered ar e b y  a  simple
mnemonic format. With a few days use
they should be easy to remember and
they allow f u ll us e o f  the facilities
available. In conclusion, I feel that the
package has great potential for the small
business user or club which needs fairly
simple documents producing on a regular
basis. If however you need to produce
very lengthy documents, this processor is
not ideally suited.

The Spreadsheet
At ﬁrst, I  thought that reviewing a
spreadsheet would b e  about a s
interesting as watching paint dry. I soon
realised that the documentation supplied
by Commodore made entering data to
the spreadsheet very simple and almost a
pleasure.
What exactly is a spreadsheet? For me
this question needed to be answered in
one way only: What could it do for me?
It soon became apparent that if I was
willing to spend a little time entering data
about my income and expenditure, I
could use the computer to budget my
account and even get a neat printout
showing where I'd spent it all. Fortunately
my printer does not print in red so it did
not look so bad.
To enter the spreadsheet, you must
t!
ﬁrst enter the word processor and then in
command mode type TC which means 'to
calculations', and then you enter the
spreadsheet. Th e  spreadsheet i s
organised as 17 columns and 50 rows, of
which only 3 columns and 12 rows are
visible on the screen at any one time. To
compensate for this a scrolling screen is
used, (as in the word processor).
The intersection of a row and column
is called a cell and a large cursor block
indicates the current cell location. By
pressing F2 the cell is moved to the right,
PI moves the cell to the left. In the cells
one can enter either numeric or string
data, so you can have meaningful column
headings on the ﬁnal printout. Financial
date can be edited and modiﬁed with a
reasonable degree of ease. The entering
of data is fairly straightforward and with a
little practice, you should soon become
I
printed copy.
The package also allows the use of
formulae from within the spreadsheet, so
that quite complex calculations such as
interest rates and mortgage repayments
can b e  calculated. The method o f
entering formulae is a little complex and
needs some time before it is mastered, As
with the word processor, any ﬁle that is
created can be loaded or saved from disc.
The obvious way to evaluate the uses of
this package is to try i t yourself and
hopefully it will meet the standards you
desire,
I feel that this package is only going to
be of use to the small businessman or club
which deals with limited ﬁnancial
transactions. To the average computer
buff, it may seem a bit of a waste of ROM
space.
The Database
The uses of a database are only limited by
the imagination. A good database will
allow the user easily to enter a given set of
facts, and, at a later date retrieve them for
further use. Applications could include
listing names and addresses, personnel
ﬁles, collections, recipes etc.
Under normal circumstances, one
would possibly keep this type o f
information in some type of card indexed
system. The Plus/4 database puts an end
to having to plough through endless card
systems to retrieve your precious data.
To enter the database you ﬁrst enter
the word processor and type TF
RETURN. Before actually entering any
data it is advisable to plan your ﬁle on
paper ﬁrst as this will speed up entry to the
87

computer.
A database stores information in Fields
which you specify. Thus for a telephone
directory, one might need 5 ﬁelds to cope
with ﬁrst and last names, address (two
ﬁelds) and telephone number. The
package allows up to 17 ﬁelds, each of
which can contain 38 alphanumeric
characters per ﬁeld.
The maximum number of records per
ﬁle is 999. This may be a little restrictive
if the package were to be used, for
example, by a school as a pupil database.
Once you have deﬁned your ﬁelds the
entry of data is very simple and a novice
should have little or no problems with this
aspect of the package.
As soon as the required data has been
entered into the computer, several useful
commands are available for the user to
manipulate the data.
One of the best features of a database
is its ability to sort data into a speciﬁed
order, such as alphabetically, or numer-
ically. This package allows this, but it uses
memory occupied by any data left in the
word processor so caution should be
exercised when doing a sort.
The package allows the user t o
produce a printed report on the data
which is stored in the database, but to do
this requires the use of several entries
from the keyboard. The number of user
inputs could have been cut down a little
and the hard work left to the computer.
If you do not require a printout of the
data then the two commands used most
frequently are Review and Search.
The review command ﬂips very
quickly through the data stored starting at
any speciﬁed record number. When the
desired piece of information is in view,
pressing CONTROL and 5 will freeze the
display, pressing RETURN re-enables the
review.
88 I f  a full review is not wanted, one can
enter th e  search mode where th e
computer will ask for a string or number
to search for and then display all records
that have that particular string in them.

The data base is by far the best package
of the four offered by the Plus/4. If you
have any kind of hobby or lob that needs
quick and easy access to information,
then you need a database.

Business graphics package
This package is not really a separate
program, b u t a n  extension o f  the
spreadsheet. It enables the user to output
numeric information in graphic format.
I was somewhat disappointed to ﬁnd
that even though the Plus/4 has extensive
Hi Res graphic capabilities, they are not
used in this program. The excuse is that
the characters must be printable by all
Commodore printers. Since even very
cheap printers have Dot Programmable
characters. I feel that the excuse is a little
weak.
The entry o f data is very straight
forward, and a nice touch is that the
package has an auto scaling function
which keeps the graphs to a readable
scale.
The graphics can be dumped to a
printer and added to any document or
spreadsheet. The quality of the graphs is
not as good as it would be in Hi Res, but
one poor graph is better than no graph at
all.
Bar graphs and point graphs are
catered for, though the bar graphs are
more pleasant to look at.
All four
Commodore have produced a relatively
cheap micro with a lot of the facilities
normally found on much more expensive
machines. However, the packages offered
are probably only useful to a limited
number of people. If you are considering
buying a Plus/4 for the built-in software
make sure that it will cope with all the
tasks you want it to perform, not just now
but also i n  th e  foreseeable future.
Otherwise you may be frustrated by its
limitations.
However, within those limitations the
Plus/4 and its software is a fairly successful
package to which I would offer a qualiﬁed
welcome.

PURE MAGIC!
Join Alice in her journey through Videoland - an enchanted place populated by strange creatures such as bread-and-
butterﬂies and pipe smoking caterpillars; where little girls change size and ﬂamingos turn into croquet mallets1
Alice in Videoland is a revolutionary new concept in entertainment for the Commodore 64, incorporating some of the ﬁnest
graphics ever seen on any home computer, accompanied by a charming musical score, There are four different game scenes
involved, and your performance in earlier ones will affect your abi ty  to get through later ones and dete rmine your eventual
total score.
Scene O ne - Stunning title page graphics give way to the ﬁrst game scene as Alice falls into the rabbit's warren. Score
points for collecting the objects to be found there - including keys to open doors, bottles to make her smaller, cakes to make
her bigger!
Scene Two - Out in the garden the Cheshire cat looks on as Alice meets the pipe-smoking caterpillar. Help her to catch the
bread-and-butterﬂies and the rocking-horse ﬂies that change into the balls used in the croquet game in the last scene,
Scene Three - Alice is a pawn in the chess game where her opponents are the Jabberwocky and Tweedledum and
Tweedledee. Help her across the board by protecting her with wur  White Knights!
Scene Four -The most bizarre croquet game ever! Help Alice hit the balls through the playing-card-soldier hoops before
the Queen of Hearts stomps on them!
Alice in Videoland is available for the Commodore 64 on disk - E12.95, and now on cassette - E8.95.
Alice in Videoland features graphics created with the Koala Pad.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start — but can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders,
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all, for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICIREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for  the keen prog,
rammer_
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like s m. QUINX
and KAMIKAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order), However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at ow
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
