Since the Magento 2 platform is absolutely new, the available information is not yet 
enough to write a book which is as informative as our Magento 1 DIY, but Magento 2 DIY 
is an ongoing project, so we will update the book as new information is available. Thus, 
having bought it, you get free lifetime updates as well as useful tips and recommendations 
from the Firebear team. We are going to create a manual which will cover all aspects 
of the platform, making it possible to master e-commerce on the basis of Magento 2 
without any third-party specialists. If you are looking for a complete guide to Magento 
e-commerce, check our first book, Magento 1 DIY (Apress, 2016).

﻿ ■ Acknowledgments
xviii
In addition to Magento 2 DIY, we also recommend you read the official developer 
documentation1 and The Official Magento 2 User Guide2, since they fully describe the 
platform. As for our book, we are going to release several more editions within this year, 
because the platform is constantly evolving and we get new information, which is worth 
sharing.
The book has been created by Viktor Khliupko3 in collaboration with the Firebear 
team. Andrii Pechatkin, Demyd Maiornykov, Rita Aloshkina, Konstantin Sokolov, Oleg 
Pomjanski, and Andrey Nikolaev have contributed a lot to make this happen. They’ve 
shared their ideas as well as edited my thoughts. The team is:
Andrii Pechatkin4—lead editor, co-author;
Rita Aloshkina5—editor;
Demyd Maiornykov6—editor;
Oleg Pomjanski7—art direction, design;
Konstantin Sokolov8—consulting, editor;
Andrey Nikolaev9—Magento consulting;
Jewgeni Faktorov10—business support;
Ewgenij Sokolov—legal advisor.
The Magento platform is constantly changing, so it is impossible to create a book 
that will cover all its aspects. Therefore, check the Firebear blog11 and sign up for updates. 
All the latest news, reviews, and advice related to both Magento 1 and Magento 2 are 
available there.

CHAPTER 1
Overview
Magento Commerce, the leading e-commerce provider, announced the general 
availability of much-anticipated Magento 2.0, which represents the next generation of 
the most popular e-commerce platform. The new product has been essentially revamped 
in comparison to 1.X and, as you might have guessed, it is still an open source solution 
with unrivaled flexibility and scalability, but with lots of new innovation opportunities. 
Consequently, Magento 2 empowers brands, retailers, and merchants to deliver 
omnichannel shopping experiences to their customers:
• 
quickly,
• 
cost-effectively,
• 
and with a personal approach to every buyer.
Besides, this version of the popular e-commerce platform introduces dramatic 
improvements in such areas as scalability, performance, and security. Thus, Magento 2.0 
is a foundational milestone and an inevitable step that not only extends the company’s 
market presence, but provides it with the status of the innovation leader and the 
trendsetter for the whole e-commerce ecosystem.

Chapter 1 ■ Overview
2
Dubbed the e-commerce platform of the future, Magento 2 offers a strong 
competitive edge to its customers and partners, keeping their businesses ahead of 
the innovation curve. Since the platform relies on a revamped code base, modular 
architecture, and a modern technology stack, its users get the following advantages:
• 
quite easy, but literally unlimited customization
• 
fast time to market
• 
deployment flexibility to various cloud environments
Such features form a robust basis for exceptional business agility. Hence, the 
Magento 2 e-commerce changes the way you add product lines, explore new channels, 
and integrate additional capabilities into your web site. It not only simplifies daily 
processes, but features the ability to do them faster than any packaged software can.
With this release, the Magento 2 community gets rapid testing, leading omnichannel 
capabilities, and advanced business metrics management across all product lines and 
channels. Already the platform of choice among the top 1,000 internet retailers, Magento 
2.0 offers the following innovations:
New architecture
As mentioned above, Magento 2 offers faster time to market, easier customization, greater 
code quality, and a modern technology stack. With a more modular code base as well as 
new service contracts, the platform provides a favorable environment for customization 
of default features and implementation of unique e-commerce ideas. And due to 
automated testing and extensive APIs, Magento 2 e-commerce means faster and higher-
quality deployments and integrations to all possible third-party systems.

Chapter 1 ■ Overview
3
Better performance and scalability
While the first version of the e-commerce platform was resource-hungry and quite 
clumsy, the Magento 2 developers decided to improve this drawback, so the new release 
offers higher performance capabilities. Thus, your visitors have a great opportunity to 
forget about delays in accessing your e-commerce store with significantly faster page load 
times. And in case you are a Magento 2.0 Enterprise Edition merchant, your web site will 
easily handle even the largest enterprise-level site traffic and order volumes.

Chapter 1 ■ Overview
4
Revamped shopping experiences
Magento 2 introduces a revamped shopping experience which includes fast and easy 
checkout as well as renewed responsive design options, such as updated reference and 
blank themes. The streamlined checkout not only consists of fewer steps, but requires 
minimum information. As for the built-in new themes, they offer a seamless experience 
anytime, anywhere. Therefore, it doesn’t matter what devices are used for shopping in the 
ecosystem of Magento 2.
New productivity features
First of all, we’d like to mention that Magento 2.0 introduced a new admin panel, which is 
more user-friendly. Another vital improvement is guided product onboarding developed 
with simplicity in mind. Faster import/export capabilities and customized views are also 
among new productivity features and options of Magento 2. All these improvements 
ensure that merchants will manage various types of data (such as customer, product, 
or order information) more efficiently. Consequently, by using Magento 2 as a major 
e-commerce tool, they will be able to sell the right goods to the right buyers at the proper 
time more precisely. And don’t ignore the modular architecture, as it dramatically 
simplifies integrations and platform upgrades, which are planned to be published four 
times per year, starting from Q1 2016.

Chapter 1 ■ Overview
5
Beta Merchants
Although Magento 2 was released on November 17, there are already some beta 
merchants, including such giants as:
• 
SEAT
• 
Venroy
• 
SOL Lingerie
• 
Alcatel OneTouch
As you can see from the above list, Magento 2.0 has been tested across different 
industries. Furthermore, the platform showed good metrics along every step of the 
business growth cycle.
Magento 2 Extensions
It is also worth mentioning that developers have already created numerous Magento 2 
extensions. There are even two modules in our portfolio:
	
1.	
The Improved Import / Export Magento 2 Extension
	
2.	
Improved Configurable Products for Magento 2
Hence, with the launch of the Magento 2 platform, the ecosystem already has a lot of 
useful stuff merchants need for running a successful e-commerce business. Many more 
Magento 2 plug-ins will be available soon.
More Magento 2 extensions are covered further in this book.

Chapter 1 ■ Overview
6
Magento 2 Courses
The company also offers courses for Magento developers. If you are planning to master 
the ecosystem from within, you can easily attend an online learning class. But note that 
some previous experience with Magento and PHP is required.
Magento 2 Migration
This is the most sensitive issue of the whole Magento 2 platform. The ecosystem offers a 
full data migration tool, but there are still some problems related to the transportation of 
customizations and extensions from 1.X to 2.0. The available solution does not provide 
enough features to implement a seamless migration to the next generation platform 
starting right now. Moreover, the absence of a robust Magento 2 migration tool is a 
key reasons to delay your migration to the second version of the popular e-commerce 
platform.
New Licensing Model
The second major Magento release introduces a tiered licensing model. The new approach 
provides better flexibility and aligns better to customers’ further e-commerce needs. 
Although the revamped pricing model implementation was planned for January 1, 2016,  
both Community Edition and Enterprise Edition were available long before. You can find 
both solutions on the Magento web site: Magento 2 Community Edition and Magento 2 
Enterprise Edition.

CHAPTER 2
Technology Stack
In this chapter, we provide a complete overview of the Magento 21 technology stack. The 
new version of the popular e-commerce platform has been essentially revamped, so you 
will discover a lot of new features and requirements in comparison with 1.X. Below, we 
describe all major elements of the technology stack as well as provide some useful links.
Magento 2 Technology Stack:
• 
PHP
• 
Zend Framework
• 
PSR-0, PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-3, and PSR-4
• 
Composer
• 
HTML5
• 
CSS3 (SASS preprocessor)
• 
JQuery
• 
RequireJS
• 
Symfony
• 
Apache
• 
Nginx
• 
MySQL
• 
Gulp
• 
Twig

Chapter 2 ■ Technology Stack

Other diagrams
PHP
Magento 2 requires PHP 5.5 and 5.6 by default. It will also work with PHP 7. The support 
for the new version of PHP makes the platform much faster and significantly simplifies a 
coding routine.
Zend Framework
Magento 2 uses bits out of different frameworks, such as Zend Framework 1, Zend 
Framework 2, Symfony, etc. Instead of directly relying on ZF 1, it utilizes its own adapters 
and interfaces used for tunneling calls to ZF 1 components. It is highly recommended 
to use the official Magento framework APIs to avoid problems related to the platform’s 
internal changes.

The Magento 2 technology stack includes such coding standards as PSR-0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  
PSR-0 is the default autoloading standard, PSR-1 is a set of basic coding standards, while 
PSR-2 is a coding style guide. Since PSR-0 has been marked as deprecated, PSR-4 is 
recommended as its replacement. As for PSR-3, it defines a logger interface that allows 
writing reusable code independent from any particular logging implementation.
Composer
Composer introduces a dependency management package for PHP. Magento 2 not 
only supports it out of the box, but Composer is among key system requirements of the 
e-commerce platform. You can check how to install Composer here.
HTML5
HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting front-end components 
in Magento 2. It also simplifies development and introduces new abilities, being a vital 
Magento 2 technology stack component.
CSS3
Instead of Bootstrap, Magento 2 uses LESS and CSS in the theme core. LESS preprocessor 
and LESS PHP adapter enable the use of LESS within the platform. In its turn, CSS URL 
resolver resolves links from CSS source files and replaces them with the correct ones. If 
you are wondering why Magento 2 relies on LESS instead of SASS, check this article. For 
further information about Magento UI library, read this post.
JQuery
JQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library incorporated in Magento 
2 by default. The migration from Prototype to JQuery is a very important improvement 
related to the upgrade, since you will forget the way you were writing JavaScript in 1.X.
RequireJS
RequireJS2 is another noticeable component of the Magento 2 technology stack related to 
JavaScript. Being a file and module loader optimized for in-browser use, it improves the 
speed and quality of your code.

Symfony
Symfony is a PHP framework and a set of reusable PHP components used in Magento 2. It 
speeds up your Magento 2 development by providing the ability to avoid repetitive coding 
tasks. YAML is a serialization standard introduced among Symfony components. It is a 
great format for your configuration files, since it makes them as readable as INI files and 
as expressive as XML files. Check this Magento 2 Yaml File and the JavaScript unit tests 
post for further information.
Apache
Magento 2 requires Apache 2.2.x or 2.4.x. According to a Netcraft, 60% of all web sites are 
using this web server, and now it is a part of the Magento 2 technology stack. You can find 
more information about Apache in Magento 2 here.
Nginx
Another Magento 2 technology stack component is Nginx, a reverse proxy server for 
such protocols as HTTPS, HTTP, POP3, SMTP, and IMAP. Besides, it is a load balancer, an 
HTTP cache, and an origin web server. The project is focused on high performance and 
concurrency as well as low usage of memory. You can discover how to use Nginx with 
Magento 2 here: Magento 2 Nginx Configuration3.
MySQL
Many of the world’s largest web sites have relied on MySQL for years, and now Magento 
also incorporates this open source database. The solution helps to save time and money 
powering your high-volume Magento 2 project. The e-commerce platform uses MySQL 
database triggers during reindexing. At the same time, Magento does not support MySQL 
statement-based replication.
Gulp
Although Grunt4 is a contemporary JavaScript task runner used in Magento 2, some 
specialists recommend using Gulp instead of it. Gulp offers much faster building 
processes and streamlines deployment. It is also necessary to mention that Gulp was 
developed with the idea of connecting community-developed microtasks in mind, while 
Grunt relies on a set of commonly used tasks.

Twig
Twig is a fast, flexible, and secure PHP template engine supported in Magento 2. It is 
a Magento 2 technology stack component that will essentially simplify your work with 
themes and templates. You can find the Twig template engine for Magento 2 here5. It 
should be used additionally to .phtml files since it does not provide any .twig template 
files.
Conclusion
As you can see, the technology stack of Magento 2 looks really impressive. The platform 
provides a plethora of new abilities, so don’t hesitate to utilize all Magento 2 features 
in your further e-commerce projects. In addition to the aforementioned Magento 2 
technology stack components, we should also mention a native support for Redis, 
Varnish, and Solr. Compared to 1.x, the new opportunities are almost endless.

CHAPTER 4
Installation / Download
In this chapter, we’ve gathered all the necessary information about Magento 2 
installation. The new version of the platform has been finally released, so don’t hesitate 
to find out how to install the Magento 2 software. Below, we discuss different approaches 
to the Magento 2 installation from the use of the Setup Wizard to more complicated 
procedures based on Composer and the command line.
4 Types of Magento 2 Installation
Before starting our Magento 2 installation guide, we’d like to introduce you to four major 
approaches to this procedure. Below, you will find their descriptions as well as links to 
official guides. Magento 2 offers the ability to perform an easy installation and at the same 
time do everything to contribute code to its code base. Of course, each approach has 
unique requirements, so let’s begin with the easiest one.

Chapter 4 ■ Installation / Download
20
Simple installation on your own server
Easy installation on your own server does not require any complicated tricks with the 
command line. You only need some technical expertise as well as command line access 
to your Magento server. This Magento 2 installation consists of the following steps:
• 
Download a compressed file with the Magento software.
• 
Then, you should extract it on your Magento server.
• 
Now, install the software via the Setup Wizard. Alternatively, you 
can rely on the command line.
Simple installation on shared hosting
This approach to the Magento 2 installation is similar to the aforementioned one. The only 
difference here is in the usage of shared hosting. Get ready to find a hosting provider and 
perform a small technical expertise. You are already familiar with the installation steps:
• 
Take a compressed file with the Magento software.
• 
Extract it on the server.
• 
Install the software via the Setup Wizard.
The metapackage
If you need a full control over all installed components of Magento 2, then this type of 
installation is for you. It is highly technical, provides access to your Magento server, and 
offers the ability to repackage Magento CE with other components. To install Magento 2 
in such a way, do the following:
• 
Create a new Composer project with the list of components you 
want to use.
• 
Update your package dependencies via the same tool. Use the 
composer create-project command to get the metapackage.
• 
Now, you can install Magento 2 via the command line. The Setup 
Wizard can be utilized as well.
Cloning the Magento 2 repository
If you are a contributing developer who has a huge experience in using Composer and 
GitHub, then you might be interested in cloning the Magento 2 repo.
• 
Clone the Magento 2 repository on GitHub.
• 
Update package dependencies via Composer.
• 
Install the software. Use either the Setup Wizard or the 
command line.

Now, when you know four major approaches to Magento 2 installation, we can go 
further.
Magento 2 Installation Guide
Magento 2 System Requirements
This is the set of system requirements for Magento 2:
• 
Operating systems: Linux distributions (RHEL, Ubuntu, CentOS, 
Debian, etc.)
• 
The latest stable version of Composer
• 
Apache 2.2 or 2.4 (don’t forget to enable mod_rewrite module)
• 
PHP: 5.4.x (x is 11 or above); 5.5.x
• 
PHP extensions: PDO/MySQL, mcrypt, mbstring, mhash, curl, 
simplexml, gd2, ImageMagick 6.3.7, soap
• 
MySQL 5.6.x
• 
SMTP server of MTA
There are some optional but also very important recommendations: php_
xdebug2.2.0 or above (development environments only); PHPUnit 4.1 or above as a tool 
for the command line.

Chapter 4 ■ Installation / Download
22
Composer and Magento
­To install the Magento software, you now need a Composer. It provides you with 
the ability to manage the system, extensions, and dependencies. The key features of 
Composer are:
• 
It enables you to reuse third-party libraries with no need to 
bundle them with source code.
• 
With Composer, you get a component-based architecture with a 
robust dependency management.
• 
The tool manages dependencies; as a result you get much less 
compatibility issues and conflicts between extensions.
• 
You also get versioned dependencies with Composer.
• 
And don’t forget about Semantic versioning.
• 
Last but not least is that Composer supports PHP Framework 
Interoperability standard.
More information is available in our Magento 2 Composer Guide1.
Composer Installation
• 
Create a new and empty directory on a Magento server.
• 
Enter the following:
1   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
2   mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
There are also some additional installation options, you can find them in Composer 
installation documentation.
• 
Restart Apache: for Ubuntu use service apache2 restart; for 
CentOS use: service httpd restart
Magento GitHub Repository Cloning
• 
It is extremely important to use secure shell (SSH): generate SSH 
keys; add a public key to GitHub.
• 
Copy the HTTPS clone URL or Magento GitHub repository SSH to 
the clipboard.
• 
Open Magento GitHub repository in a browser.
1https://firebearstudio.com/blog/magento-2-composer.html

Chapter 4 ■ Installation / Download
23
• 
Click SSH or HTTPS (under the “Clone URL” field on the right side).
• 
Use “Copy to clipboard” button.
This is the example of HTTPS clone URL:
• 
Change the docroot directory of web server: for Ubuntu, it’s  
/var/www; for CentOS - /var/www/html.
• 
Use one of the following commands:
• 
For HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/magento/magento2.git
• 
For SSH: git clone git@github.com:magento/magento2.git
• 
Now the repository will be cloned on a server.
File System Permissions & Ownership
The recommend settings for permissions are:
• 
700 permissions for all directories (drwx—-). The owner gets 
the full control—the ability to read/write/execute; other users 
have no permissions.
• 
600 permissions for all files (-rw—–). The owner is able to read 
and write, but nobody else gets the permissions.
Now, when the user of a web server owns the Magento 2 file system, you should use 
the following:
• 
Use cd magento2 to change the Magento directory.
• 
Use ps -ef | grep apache2 to find the web server user in Ubuntu; 
grep User /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf- in CentOS.
• 
Use chown -R [your web server user name] to set ownership; in 
CentOS - chown -R apache; in Ubuntu - chown -R www-data.
And finally you can set the permissions:
1   find . -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;
2   find . -type f -exec chmod 600 {} \;
Installation Dependencies Update
Magento installation dependencies—Introduction
Magento relies on Composer for the first time, so before installing any Magento 
software, you must set up the Composer and perform the following:
• 
First of all you have to Install the Composer.
• 
Now you must Switch to the Apache user to let the Composer 
write files to the docroot of web server as the correct user.

Chapter 4 ■ Installation / Download
24
• 
From both of the below directories, run the composer install 
command:
1   <your Magento install dir>
2   <your Magento install dir>/setup
Keep in mind, that the main reason for failure is an incomplete or non-functional 
installation.
Switching to the Apache user:
For both Ubuntu and CentOS, avoid running Composer as the root user. And don’t 
forget that the user of web server on CentOS is apache; on Ubuntu - www-data.
Ubuntu
• 
Enter su www-data.
• 
In case you don’t know the user’s password and a dedicated 
prompt appears, continue with the next step.
Use the following commands to enable the www-data user’s shell and to set a 
password:
1   sudo chsh -s /bin/bash www-data
2   sudo passwd www-data
• 
Run su www-data again and enter the password.
• 
To end the procedure, continue with Running Composer to 
update dependencies.
CentOS
• 
Run su - apache. If “This account is currently not available” error 
displays, continue with the next step.
• 
Use sudo chsh -s /bin/bash apache to give apache a valid shell 
account.
• 
Enter su - apache again—it should work now.
Running Composer to update dependencies
• 
Switch or log in as the web server user to the Magento server.
• 
Change to the installation directory of Magento 2 - cd /var/www/
html/magento2
• 
Run composer install to update package dependencies.

How To Create A Virtual Machine For Magento 2
Since Magento 2 requires MySQL 5.6, there are a lot of problems with running Magento 
2 in environments such as MAMP and XAMPP with MySQL 5.5 support only. If you 
are going to switch between Magento 1 and 2 projects, the issue can turn into a serious 
headache. Below, we’ve gathered information about solving the versions problem with 
the help of Magento 2 virtualization.
The traditional form of virtualization requires such software as VirtualBox on a host 
OS. A Virtual Machine (VM) with its OS runs inside this software. The other form relies 
on Linux containers, which are used by Docker. They use Linux OS features like chroot to 
guarantee a set of processes in one “container.” With this form of virtualization, you don’t 
have to run a full new OS. Different containers are able to run different versions of software.

Vagrant is a special tool designed to create and configure development 
environments. Vagrant provides few ways of usage. Firstly, Magento 2 code base is 
checked out in the file system, whereupon the developer gets the ability to edit the code 
with the help of text editors. Secondly, the web browser is run right on the OS. Thirdly, the 
code resides in a Vagrant box. The content of the box doesn’t matter much to a developer, 
as long as the project works. In addition, you can easily share an environment definition 
with other developers and switch between different Magento projects—different boxes 
can be defined with different versions of the software. There is also no risk of conflict.
Magento 2 Vagrant Box
Magento 2 Vagrant Box2 provides a simple way to get your Magento 2 project up and 
running. Based on a Debian Wheezy box provided via Puppet (VirtualBox is a provider), 
Magento2 Vagrant Box installs Apache 2 +FastCGI, PHP, PHP-FPM, MySQL and other 
dependencies. Being a git submodule, Magento 2 repository can be edited from the host 
machine. It is accessible via shared directories by the guest.

Get a dirty Vagrant image within minutes. With this Magento 2 tool3, you will be able 
to run MySQL and Apache in a Vagrant box and use other tools on a desktop. vagrant-
magento2-apache-base relies on shell scripts to configure things. As a result, readers can 
poke around and you’ll get problems with learning such technologies as Puppet, Chef, or 
Ansible. The tool requires the latest version of VirtualBox and its Add-ons.
How to Install Magento 2 with Docker
Get your ticket to the world of containerization with Docker. In a situation where you 
are working with several projects, which run on different software versions (for example 
Magento 1.x on PHP 5.4, Magento 2.x on PHP 5.6, and web host on PHP 5.3) you probably 
face the problem when system packages don’t exactly match each other. Therefore, you 
can use Docker to simplify interactions with all your projects. This software solution allows 
you to package your apps with all their dependencies into standardized units (containers) 
designed for convenient software development, since they wrap up everything into a 
complete filesystem with runtime, code, system tools and libraries. As a result, a package 
runs the same in all possible environments. To get deeper insights into what is Docker, 
check this page4 on the official web site of the software. I also recommend you get 
acquainted with basic aspects of Magento development with Docker here5. Additionally, 
there is an important article on Magento 2 development with Docker on OS X6 on

CHAPTER 5
Hosting
Since Magento 2 introduces a bunch of brand-new features and improvements, it also 
has updated requirements related to hosting. Hence, solutions optimized for 1.X are 
no longer suitable for the new version of the e-commerce platform. Although they can 
still work with Magento 2, 1.X optimized hostings never provide the highest possible 
performance. That’s why we’d like to describe Magento 2 hosting services, but let’s 
discuss new system requirements first.
Magento 2 System Requirements
• 
Nginx—Magento 2 supports Nginx by default.
• 
PHP 7 is going to make the platform lightning fast.
• 
Composer is now a part of the system.
• 
Varnish—heavily consumed APIs and dynamic web sites are no 
longer a problem for Magento.

Chapter 5 ■ Hosting
40
• 
Redis—top-notch performance of Magento 2 is now achieved 
with the advanced key-value cache.
• 
MySQL—the most popular open source database for web apps is 
also on board.
• 
PHPUnit and XDebug are now required for your dev server.
As you can see, there are a lot of new features which require a special approach when it 
comes to hosting Magento 2. To get a deeper insight into the new conditions, check this 
article: Magento 2 System Requirements1. The understanding of system requirements 
will help you choose Magento 2 hosting, which will fully satisfy the needs of the platform. 
Please note that a hosting server should support all of them:
Magento 2 Hosting Requirements
• 
I should run the latest available PHP and MySQL versions.
• 
The SSH access is another important feature, since it provides the 
ability to use the Magento 2 CLI and Composer.
• 
As you might have guessed, an optimized Magento 2 web hosting 
server should support Composer.
• 
Varnish is also a must.
We recommend you check reviews of a Magento 2 hosting service you choose and 
compare it with system requirements you have. Thus, you will be able to get a Magento 
2 web hosting which fully complies with your business needs and Magento 2 system 
requirements
Here at Firebear, we anticipate that all major Magento hosting partners will provide 
reliable hosting options for Magento 2 as well. For example, Nexcess and RackSpace have 
always offered various robust solutions optimized for the e-commerce platform, therefore 
you can monitor the below companies:

CHAPTER 6
Composer
In this chapter, we will explain how to use the application-level package manager with the 
most popular e-commerce platform. Being inspired by Node.js npm, Composer provides 
a unified format that simplifies dependency management of PHP software. The usage of 
Composer in various Magento 2 projects is inevitable, because it is a part of the platform. 
You can run the package manager through the command line, installing dependencies 
for your modules. Besides, Composer provides the ability to install Magento 2 extensions 
available on Packagist (the repo is described below). Another important feature 
introduced in Composer is a set of autoload capabilities for libraries that essentially 
simplifies the usage of third-party software solutions.
Magento 2 Composer Integration
You must install Composer if you use the Magento software. The package manager 
will be necessary to update Magento 2 and its components, even if you’ve installed the 
e-commerce solution from an archive.
The Magento 2 Composer combination offers the following features:
• 
provides the ability to use third-party libraries while you don’t 
have to bundle them with source code of Magento 2
• 
offers a component-based architecture as well as reliable 
dependency management
• 
reduces extension conflicts as well as various compatibility issues
• 
streamlines your work with versioned dependencies
• 
introduces semantic versioning
• 
supports some useful standards, such as PHP Framework 
Interoperability
In its turn, Magento 2 relies on Composer while packaging different components as 
well as product editions. Since some third party components used by Magento are not 
presented in the code base, they exist in a form of dependencies in composer.json files. 
Below, we will shed light on them.

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
44
Magento 2 and composer.json
While talking about composer.json files, it is necessary to explain what is a package. A 
package is a directory which contains composer.json as well as other component files. 
It’s an inevitable component of the Magento 2 Composer tandem. These are the types of 
composer.json packages:
• 
Root composer.json package includes the main composer.json file 
utilized for declaring dependencies on third-party components 
and used as a template for other root composer.json files. It is 
located under composer.json, its naming convention is magento/
magento2ce, its type is project.
• 
CE project composer.json package represents Magento CE project 
and declares dependencies on the class autoloader and the 
magento product. It is located under composer.json, its naming 
convention is magento/project-community-edition, its type is 
project.
• 
CE product composer.json package represents Magento 
CE product and declares dependencies on such Magento 
components as themes and modules as well as third-party 
components. The package is located under composer.json, its 
naming convention is magento/project-community-edition, its 
type is metapackage.
• 
base composer.json package represents Magento CE base 
package which includes files/directories (excluding components) 
as well as introduces the “require” section to list the latter. The 
package is located under composer.json, its naming convention is 
magento/magento2-base, its type is magento2-component.
• 
module shows a fully qualified name of a module, which is 
broken down into vendor, suffixes that represent the rest of the 
words, and the mandatory prefix. The package is located under 
app/code/Magento/<Module>/composer.json, its naming 
conventions are magento/module-catalog-inventory and 
magento/module-checkout, its type is magento2-module.
• 
theme belongs to areas, that’s why you should use the area 
name as the first suffix. The package is located under app/
design/<area>/Magento/<theme>/composer.json, its naming 
conventions are magento/theme-frontend-blank and magento/
theme-adminhtml-backend, its type is magento2-theme.
• 
language packs package require the lowercase language identifier. 
The package is located under app/i18n/magento/<language>/
composer.json, its naming conventions are magento/language-
en_us, magento/language-de_de, etc., its type is magento2-
language.

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
45
• 
Magento framework/libraries contains only one package—
magento/framework. Particular libraries are not distinguished as 
separate components. The package is located under lib/internal/
Magento/Framework/composer.json, its naming convention is 
magento/framework, its type is magento2-library.
The Magento 2 Composer cooperation provides you with the ability to submit the 
following package types to Magento Connect:
• 
magento2-module usually includes source files and the top 
composer.json.
• 
metapackage is a placeholder that gathers a collection of 
packages.
• 
magento2-theme package type is utilized with theme packages.
• 
magento2-language usually contains a .csv file used for 
translating certain content.
Naming conventions in Magento 2 and Composer
The required format for Composer packages in Magento 2 is:
1   <vendor_name>/<package_name>
Please note that there is a requirement for all letters in the name in the Magento 2 
Composer duo—they must be lowercase.
Hence, Magento packages are named according to the following format:
1   magento/*
If a package name consists of several words, these word should be separated with 
dash according to the Composer specification. The Magento package name convention 
looks as follows:
1   magento/<type-prefix>-<suffix>[-<suffix>]...
• 
type-prefix is a component type in a Magento-specific domain.
• 
suffix is something that identifies the component within its type.
Package Types
Each component of Magento 2 can be categorized into one of eight types listed above. In 
case you have a component that doesn’t fit into any specific category, you can generalize 
it to magento-component.

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
46
With the aid of identifier types related to each component, the Magento 2 system 
arranges both directories and files of each component and places them in correct 
locations according to the available directory structure of Magento 2.
How to Install Composer
The following section of our Magento 2 Composer guide describes how to install 
Composer. First of all, you should check whether the software solution is already installed 
or not. Open a command prompt and enter this command:
1   composer --help
If the command displays the appropriate information, you’ve already installed 
Composer. If you see an error, perform the following actions:
• 
Go to your Magento server and create a new empty there.
• 
Run the commands listed below:
1   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
2   mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
Congratulations! You’ve just installed Composer on Magento 2. If you have any 
questions, see the official Composer installation guide.
How to Deploy Magento 2 CE with Composer

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
47
To deploy Magento 2 CE with Composer, use the following command:
1   git clone https://github.com/magento/magento2 ./magento2
2   composer install
If you want to update your Magento 2 project to the latest available version, utilize 
this command:
1   git pull composer install
If you are going to deploy Magento 2 CE through Composer to the web site root, 
which is /var/www/example.com/htdocs, there can be two different conditions: you 
can be inside or outside the deploying directory performing the appropriate Magento 2 
Composer command. In the first case, run this one:
1   cd /var/www/example.com/htdocs
2   composer create-project "magento/project-community-edition"
In the second case, utilize this one:
1   composer create-project "magento/project-community-edition" /var/www/
example.com/htdocs
Source
How to clone the Magento 2 repository via 
Composer
This Magento 2 Composer procedure is necessary if you are going to contribute to the code 
base of the platform. You can choose between the master or develop branches. The first 
one is more stable and you can clone it with the help of the optional [-b master] argument, 
while the second one is the latest and and it will be cloned by default. You can find the full 
description of the procedure here: (Contributor) Clone the Magento repository.
How to package a module in Magento 2
In Magento 2, Composer packages are used for distributing, installing, and upgrading 
modules. To package your module, it is necessary to:
• 
create a composer.json file;
• 
package and then publish a module on the Magento Connect.

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
48
Magento 2 Composer file
composer.json defines such basic information as name, version, and requirements. Use 
only a root directory of a module to place its composer.json file and pay attention to the 
Composer generic schema and the following restrictions:
• 
name—requires using the <vendor-name>/module-<module-
name> format as well as lowercase letters only. Dashes must be 
used to separate words in the <module-name>.
• 
type—set this value to magento2-module for all your modules.
• 
autoload—specifies important data to be loaded. For further 
information, check Composer Autoloading.
Metapackages
While talking about the Magento 2 Composer integration, it is necessary to pay special 
attention to metapackages, since they provide the ability to create an extension that 
consists of several packages, combining it into a cohesive system. A metapackage is a 
.zip file that contains the metapackage composer.json file only. If your extension uses 
more than one package, use a metapackage as its root package. Note that it is the only 
use case for this package type. For further information, check the official composer.json 
documentation.
An ordinary composer.json metapackage file looks as follows:
 1   {
 2   "name": "magento/sample-data",
 3   "version": "1.0.0-beta",
 4   "type": "metapackage",
 5   "require": {
 6   "magento/module-sample-data": "self.version",
 7   "magento/sample-data-media": "~0.42.0-beta2",
 8   },
 9   "autoload": {
10   "files": [ "registration.php" ],
11   "psr-4": {
12   "Magento\\sample-data": ""
13   }
14   }
15   }
As for a composer.json file for a module, it has the following structure:
 1   {
 2   "name": "magento/sample-module-newpage",
 3   "description": "A Magento 2 module that creates a new page",
 4   "type": "magento2-module",
 5   "version": "1.0.0",

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
49
 6   "license": [
 7   "OSL-3.0",
 8   "AFL-3.0"
 9   ],
10   "require": {
11   "php": "~5.5.0|~5.6.0|~7.0.0",
12   "magento/framework": "~1.0.0"
13   },
14   "autoload": {
15   "files": [ "registration.php" ],
16   "psr-4": {
17   "Magento\\SampleNewPage\\": ""
18   }
19   }
20   }
Packaging and publishing extensions
The Magento 2 Composer combination requires the following steps to be performed in 
order to package and publish your extensions:
	
1.	
First of all, create a package of your module via a zip 
operation. Unnecessary directories should be excluded. Use 
dashes to separate words and alphanumeric characters to set 
the package file name. Please note that it is important not to 
use whitespaces.
	
2.	
It is also worth mentioning that the Magento 2 system can 
retrieve your package from any valid URL of GitHub or other 
third-party repo.
GitHub and Packagist
If you are going to work with GitHub and Packagist, do the following things:
	
1.	
If you are planning to host your extension package on GitHub 
and Packagist, set up git on your machine.
	
2.	
Then, navigate to your module directory, it should have 
composer.json in the root, and turn it into a new git repository. 
For further information, check this GitHub documentation.
	
3.	
Now, when your module is pushed on GitHub, you can refer to it 
directly via Composer or do the same action through Packagist:
• 
Create an account on Packagist.
• 
Find the Submit Package button, click it, and paste your 
GitHub repository link there.

Chapter 6 ■ Composer
50
Private repositories
As for private repositories, they can be used for private code or development. At the same 
time, it is necessary to perform installation of such modules via a CLI. The Magento 2 
Composer tandem sets the following requirements:
	
1.	
Use Satis or Toran to make your packaging repository.
	
2.	
Create a package and submit or register it on your repository.
	
3.	
Add the following code to your composer.json:
1   {
2   "repositories": [
3   {
4   "type": "composer",
5   "url": [repository url here]
6   }
7   ]
8   }
Now, you can use the require field to reference all your packages from the private 
repository.

CHAPTER 7
API
The following section of the Magento 2 DIY book sheds light on the Magento 2 API, so 
let’s explain what this term means. Application program interface is a special interface 
which consists of protocols, routines, and tools designed to simplify the process of 
software development. Since APIs’ major purpose is to specify how different software 
parts interact within a system, they are often used to program graphical user interface 
components. Good APIs provide all building blocks necessary for developing an 
application, so a programmer only has to put them together. Although Magento 2 APIs 
incorporate the same principle, there are tons of nuances related to the e-commerce 
platform. So, what is the Magento 2 API?

Chapter 7 ■ API
52
Magento 2 API Framework
We will start our journey into the world of the Magento 2 API with core features of the 
Magento web API framework, since it provides developers with the means to use web 
services connected with the Magento 2 system. If you are trying to master the Magento 2 
API you should know that:
• 
the system supports both REST and SOAP APIs;
• 
you’ll have to deal with three types of authentication: OAuth 1.0a 
for third-party apps, tokens for mobile apps, and login credentials 
for admins and customers;
• 
accounts and integrations are assigned to resources if there 
is access to them; the API framework checks whether a call is 
authorized to perform the request;
• 
you only need a few lines of xml to configure any Magento or 
third-party service as a web API; all XML elements and attributes 
should be defined in a webapi.xml file, otherwise a service will 
not be exposed;
• 
the Magento 2 API framework relies on two models—CRUD and 
search, but does not support web hooks;
• 
it offers the web API responses field filtering for conserving 
mobile bandwidth;
• 
since Magento 2 APIs utilize integration style, a single web API 
call can run multiple services simultaneously.
Magento 2 API Opportunities
The Magento 2 APIs provide the ability to perform a wide array of tasks. For example, you 
can create a mobile app for your customers or employees. There is also an opportunity to 
integrate your e-commerce store with CRM or ERP systems with the help of Magento 2  
APIs as well as connect a Magento 2 web site with a CMS. Besides, you can develop 
JavaScript widgets for both storefronts and admin panels.
Getting Started With Magento 2 API
First of all, it is necessary to register a new web service on your Magento admin. In case of 
token-based authentication, create a new web service user under System/All Users/Add 
New User. For session-based and OAuth authentication, there is no need to do this.
Then, create a new integration under System/Integration/Add New Integration. 
Please note that it is extremely important to set up resources the integration can access.
The final step requires using a REST or SOAP client for further configuration.

Magento 2 REST API
Based on the HTTP protocol, Magento 2 REST API interactions incorporate functions 
aimed at making requests and receiving responses. The caller issues an HTTP request 
with the following elements:
• 
an HTTP header (for authentication and other instructions);
• 
a verb (GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE);
• 
an endpoint (URI that determines three important components: 
the server, the web service, and the acted resource);
• 
a call payload (all input attributes and parameters supplied with 
the request).
Please note that Magento 2 returns both a response payload and an HTTP status code. 
For further information about Magento 2 REST API, check the following official guides:
• 
Authentication
• 
Construct a request
• 
Use cURL to run the request
• 
Review the response
Magento 2 REST API Reference
Magento 2 Community Edition offers a set of REST APIs which are listed here. To generate 
live REST API documentation, install Swagger UI on your server. With the following link, 
you will be able to generate a JSON schema with third-party modules and extension 
attributes from your system: http://<magento_- host>/rest/default/schema.
After generating the schema file, you should load it into your Swagger UI. You can 
find all REST schema endpoints for available services here.
Magento 2 SOAP API Reference
You can find the official Magento 2 SOAP API reference here: SOAP Reference. It provides 
a list of service names per each module. The SOAP WSDL endpoint format looks as 
follows:
1   http://<magento_host>/soap/<store_code>?wsdl&services=<serviceName1,ser
viceName2,..>

Chapter 7 ■ API
56
Magento 2 and Swagger
If you don’t want to read a 31,000-line JSON document, pay attention to Swagger, since it 
generates a more human-friendly version of the schema by defining the JSON document 
format. Follow this link to check the official demo by Swagger. For further information 
on Swagger and Magento 2, examine this article: MAGENTO 2 REST API SWAGGER 
SCHEMA.

Magento 2 Developer Documentation
Before starting any customizations related to Magento 2 templates and themes, it is 
extremely important to examine Magento 2 Developer Documentation. All articles here 
are divided into three categories: Get Started with Magento, System Administrators, 
and Developers. Although the information introduced in Developer Documentation 
covers all aspects related to such a Magento 2 component as themes, it is necessary to 
understand the whole platform before diving deep into Magento 2 templates and themes 
development.

Front-end Architecture of Magento 2
The core difference between Magento 2 and previous versions is that the front end is 
now updated with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and other newer technologies. The overall layout 
manipulation also differs a lot. The same is true about file structure and Magento UI library, 
which is now based on LESS preprocessor. The last one includes a built-in compiler.
All nuances of Magento 2 front-end architecture are described at Inchoo. The post 
consists of three parts. The first one is dedicated to theme workflow changes, the second 
part describes updates and improvements of layout, and the last one is about the new 
Magento UI library.

This useful topic is covered by two sources: devdocs.magento8 and Magestore9. The 
official documentation includes six steps. It starts with creation of a theme folder. The 
second step is about theme declaration. Then the post shows how to configure images

parts. For further information, visit its web site: Handlebars.
Grunt and Magento 2
Magento 2 templates and themes development is impossible without repetitive tasks. To 
streamline your routine, we recommend you to pay attention to Grunt, a JavaScript task 
runner. It is designed to automate such processes as compilation, linting, minification, 
unit testing, etc. All you need is to configure a Gruntfile. In Magento 2, Grunt simplifies 
the way you customize styles in a server-side compilation mode. For further information 
on Magento 2 themes and Grunt, follow this link: How to Use Grunt in Magento 2.12

CHAPTER 9
Extensions
Since Magento 2 is a new platform, there are not as many extensions available on the 
marketplace as in case of Magento 1.X, so we are going to explain, how to install the 
existing modules, and within 2016 will release the second edition of the book which 
will describe more Magento 2 extensions. Some modules are already available after the 
installation section.
How to Install Magento 2 Modules
There are several ways to install Magento 2 extensions. If you are familiar with Magento 
1, they won’t be complicated. Before we proceed, you can chech our blog post, How to 
Install Magento 2 Modules1, for further information.
How to Install Magento 2 Extension via Composer
Now, there are only two Composer Repositories aimed at the installation of Magento 2 
modules:
• 
the official one: Magento 2 Composer Repository
• 
Packagist (the official source of Composer packages) To add them 
to your your composer.json use the following code:
1   composer config repositories.magento composer  
http://packages.magento.com/
For packages from Packagist you don’t need to add any repositories because it is the 
official Composer source included by default.
1https://firebearstudio.com/blog/how-to-install-magento-2-modules-extensions.html

Chapter 9 ■ Extensions
68
Once the repositories are added to your system, any Magento 2 extension can be 
installed with the aid of the following command:
1   composer require vendor/module
And then run:
1   composer update
This will install new dependencies and required Magento 2 extensions. Then run:
1   php bin/magento setup:upgrade
This command upgrades Magento 2 database.
Installing Magento 2 extension by copying code
I describe this type of installation on the example of the M2 sample module. Please 
note that parts like M2demo/M2Extension refer to VendorName/ModuleName. 
Since every Magento 2 module requires a particular directory structure 
(<VendorName>/<ModuleName>) under <your Magento install dir>/app/code, don’t 
forget to replace M2demo/M2Extension with the particular data related to your Magento 
2 extension.
Please note that you should be logged in as a user with the permission to write to 
your Magento web server docroot. Typically, it can be the root or web server user.
By performing the following actions, you will install your module:
1) Enter the following commands keeping their order:
1   cd <your Magento install dir>/app/code
2   mkdir -p M2demo/M2Extension
2) Go to the page of your module on Github (reference module in our case).
3) Find the Download Zip button and start your download.
4) Copy the downloaded file to your Magento server’s directory: <magento install 
dir>/app/code/m2demo/module- m2-extension.
5) Run the following commands keeping their order:
1   unzip m2extension-master.zip
2   mv m2extension-master/* .
3   rm -rf m2extension-master
6) Find your <your Magento install dir>/app/etc/config.php file and open it in a text 
editor.

Chapter 9 ■ Extensions
69
7) Add the following command under ‘modules’ Þ array (:
1   'M2Demo_M2Extension' => 1
8) Save the changes and close the editor.
I’ll update this Magento 2 tutorial as soon as new methods are available. If you are 
looking for additional information about module installation in Magento 1.x, check our 
post here: How to Install Magento Extensions.

Mirasvit Sphinx Search Ultimate11
The first reason to buy Sphinx Search Ultimate is its versatility. Mirasvit is famous as 
a developer of various extensions aimed at simplifying e-commerce search, and Sphinx 
Search Ultimate combines the company’s top solutions. The extension incorporates 
features of such modules as Advanced Sphinx Search Pro ($99), Search AutoComplete & 
Suggestions ($49), and Search Spell-Correction ($49), so you get almost a $50 discount if 
you choose Sphinx Search Ultimate ($149).
The second reason to spend your money on this extension is its reliability. There are 
more than 200 reviews on the module’s page and its average score on the basis of these 
reviews is 5/5. It seems that there are no unsatisfied customers.
The third reason to give your preference to Sphinx Search Ultimate is its incredible 
set of features and below we will describe the most important ones.
Imagine a situation when a new user comes to your web site for the first time. He 
or she probably does not know for sure how the name of a particular product is spelled. 
And if you don’t show a hint, your new user can leave your Magento store without even 
placing anything in the cart. In this situation nobody increases your cart abandonment 
rate, but you lose a chance to turn a visitor into a buyer. But if a possible customer gets 
a search tip, chances that they will place an item into their cart significantly increase. 
The right hints help greatly to quickly find a desired product, so it is vital to provide your 
customers with the ability to see a drop-down with search phrases or goods from your 
catalog shown on the basis of what is already typed.
Another essential aspect is related to typos. In case a user made a mistake, the 
default search shows no results, and you lose a chance to turn a visitor into a buyer once 
again. Thus, all typos should be fixed by your search system to provide your visitors with 
what they are looking for.
Eventually, it is necessary to mention that a slow search can also distract visitors 
from your Magento web site. Therefore, your search solution should be lightning fast.
11https://firebearstudio.com/blog/mirasvit-sphinx-search-ultimate-for-magento-
1-and-2.html

Chapter 9 ■ Extensions
77
And all these characteristics are typical for the Sphinx Search Ultimate Magento 
extension. The search mechanism of the module is based on Sphinx, an advanced 
search technology that shows a highly precise result in a fraction of a second. Since your 
visitors get a great opportunity to find what they are looking for, you dramatically increase 
conversion. According to the extension’s page on the Mirasvit web site, Sphinx search 
engine enhances conversion of visitors engaged in searching something by more than 
50%. Now, let’s pay close attention to key features of Sphinx Search Ultimate by Mirasvit.
Key features
• 
enhanced search quality
• 
665 stop words
• 
60,730 synonyms
• 
search by category names, tags, SKUs, and multiple content 
types (catalog products, * categories, and attributes; CMS pages; 
WordPress or other blog; CommerceLab; Simple Press Forum, etc.)
• 
typos correction
• 
singular/plural search
• 
the ability to use hyphens and slashes while searching products

• 
Amazon-like search categories
• 
The extension relies on AJAX to show search results rapidly.
•

Besides, you can easily set a minimum number of characters to search, configure the 
delay in finding, as well as choose a limit for the number of results shown in the drop-
down list or tips from the search box with Sphinx Search Ultimate. The extension shows 
high indexing speed. Its searching speed surpasses 500 queries per second against one 
million SKUs.
It is also necessary to mention that Sphinx supports several languages. In addition 
to English, it also knows Russian and Czech. And there are separate modules for Spanish, 
Portuguese, French, Italian, German, Romanian, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, 
Hungarian, and Finnish, so the extension is suitable for an impressive list of countries. As 
for spell check, it doesn’t need any additional dictionaries to be installed: the content on 
your web site is enough. Sphinx Search Ultimate analyzes all text information available on 
your online store and uses it to take you customer experience to the next level.

Chapter 9 ■ Extensions
78
And since Sphinx supports three working modes (MySQL- based built-in search 
engine; Sphinx Engine on the same server; Sphinx Engine on the external server), 
Mirasvit’s module is suitable for online stores of all sizes.
AheadWorks Advanced Reports for Magento 212
AheadWorks Advanced Reports for Magento 2 is not as robust as its predecessor, 
but it is already a reliable tool for Magento 2 that adds some missing features. With this 
module, you will get only six reports (more reports should be available soon), a report 
drill-down with expanded data, and stunning visual graphs for each report.
The available basic reports provide the ability to evaluate general performance of 
your Magento 2 web site from different perspectives. First of all, you get a complete sales 
overview that assembles core sales KPIs in a convenient table. Then, there is a report 
on product performance that breaks sales down by individual products. Other stats are 
gathered around categories, payment types, coupon codes, and manufacturers.
As for report drill-downs, they provide the ability to combine several reports on 
one interface with responsive settings and a breadcrumb trail. As a result, the minimum 
time is required to adjust and navigate the reports. You can break any given period by 
such periods as day, week, month, quarter, or year. And there is no need to return to 
Magento report selection for switching between reports, since there is an appropriate 
drop-down menu. Furthermore, you can even contact support and access the extension’s 
documentation right from the Advanced Reports Magento 2 extension.

time our customer selects a new attribute.
Moreover, the Layered Navigation Magento 2 extension shows how many items 
match each selection.

uMarketplace Suite Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Magento 231
You might have heard about uMarketplace Suite Multi-Vendor Marketplace for 1.X. 
This extension is quite expensive ($1,650), but it does its work seamlessly, transforming 
your store into a feature-rich e-commerce shopping mall. The same functionality is 
available for Magento 2, so get ready for multiple independent vendors selling their 
products via your store with a centralized product catalog and uniquely themed 
microsites.

vendors with the ability to add and edit products and images, assign attribute values 
and applicable categories, manage shipments, shipping options, and inventory, update

tracking, as well as create shipping labels and packing slips.
Besides, uMarketplace Suite is absolutely friendly to drop shipping: the extension 
offers all the tools required for configuring and automating the workflow. That’s because 
uMarketplace Suite Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Magento 2 is based on the uDropShip 
extension, a module that powers thousands of Magento stores.

CHAPTER 10
SEO
Among all e-commerce platform, Magento is the most powerful in terms of SEO. It provides 
the ability to optimize site URLs, page titles, meta and ALT tags, headings, and other web 
site elements out-of-the-box. Additionally, there is an impressive selection of various third 
party Magento modules designed to improve the default SEO capabilities. As for Magento 2, 
it provides even better SEO options. The new version of the popular e-commerce platform 
has been fully revamped, therefore we’d like to introduce you to Magento 2 SEO1.
Magento 2 SEO Features
• 
Product Page: metadata, canonical tag, product URLs
• 
Category Page: meta tags, SEO-friendly category URL key
• 
Pagination: canonical tag
1https://firebearstudio.com/blog/magento-2-seo.html

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
94
• 
Layered Navigation: canonical tag
• 
XML Sitemap: priority and frequency for each page type, robots.
txt file integration
• 
Rich Snippets are the most anticipated Magento 2 SEO feature.
• 
Robots.txt is now editable from the Admin panel.
• 
Schema.org is added to a default Magento 2 Template.
• 
Product Image Labels is another Magento 2 SEO feature.
• 
Related products, Upsells, and Cross-sells are also optimized in 
Magento 2.
• 
Universal Google Analytics, E-commerce Tracking, and AdWords 
Conversion are available out-of- the-box.
• 
Google Tag Manager is a unique feature of Magento 2 Enterprise 
Edition.
Below, we describe all the aforementioned features.
Product Page Optimization
Since Magento 1.X offered quite robust product page optimization, only a few things 
have been added in Magento 2. Every product page still has the same meta tag settings 
with the ability to set up such standard tags as: meta title, description, and keywords. As 
a Magento administrator, you can do this per each Store View; the same is true about the 
Product URL Key.
As for new Magento 2 SEO features related to product page optimization, there is 
Product Fields Auto-Generation. The new option can be utilized to form the product 
meta tags with the aid of available product attributes and predefined templates. You can 
find the Auto-Generation feature under Stores/- Configuration/Catalog.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
95
The way you set up a Canonical Link meta tag for your products in Magento 
2 is the same as in 1.X. For instance, http://yourstore.com/samsung-2511.
html?referal=13457 is referred to as http://yourstore.com/samsung-2511.html. You 
can change your canonical link options under Stores/Configuration/Catalog/Search 
Engine Optimization. To create SEO-friendly URLs in Magento 2, you can include their 
categories path as in Magento 1 under the same options.
Category Page Optimization
Magento 2 SEO features related to category page optimization include the same standard 
meta tags as title, meta description, and meta keywords, and you can set them up per each 
Store View. The same is true about a category URL key. But unlike 1.X, Magento 2 does not 
include available filter options, so the category page URL always remains the same.
Pagination Optimization
Pagination in Magento 2 is optimized with a canonical tag. As a result, the URL points to 
the category itself. For example, a URL such as http://yourstore.com/products.html?p=3 
points to http://yourstore.com/products.html.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
96
Layered Navigation Optimization
Layered navigation optimization in Magento 2 is also based on a canonical tag. As a 
result, URLs of layered navigation pages point to their categories, so selected attributes 
are not added to meta tags. Thus, http://www.yourstore.com/t-shirts/mens-t-
shirts.html?color=black&manufacturer=nike&price=10-50 refers to http://www.
yourstore.com/t-shirts/mens-t-shirts.html.
XML Sitemap
An XML sitemap now has a bunch of improvements. Thus, you can specify the priority 
and frequency for product, category, CMS, and other pages separately. Furthermore, 
the new Magento 2 SEO functionality provides the ability to add your XML sitemap to a 
robots.txt file automatically. Besides, the new version of the platform provides the ability 
to add images, use the Sitemap Index, and define parameters necessary for splitting items 
between various XML files.
Rich Snippets
The ability to add rich snippets is the most anticipated Magento 2 SEO feature. With its 
help, you can easily show structured markup data from your e-commerce web site within 
Google results. The new improvement helps to improve both SEO and CTR. And it is 
enabled by default.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
97
Robots.txt
Another important Magento 2 SEO feature is the ability to edit a robots.txt file in the 
admin panel under Stores/General/Design.
Alternatively, you can utilize our optimised robots.txt for Magento 2 Community 
Edition and Magento 2 Enterprise Edition. Grab the extension for free from GitHub: 
magento2robotstxt.
Schema.org Integration
Schema.org is now added to a default Magento 2 template. Its vocabulary is used for 
marking up web site content with metadata about itself. This improvement helps search 
engines get a better understanding of your Magento web site.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
98
Product Image Labels
Another crucial Magento 2 SEO feature is the ability to use product labels. Now, you 
can not only draw your customers’ attention but also improve SEO by applying labels to 
product images. Such options are available in 1.X, but only via third-party extensions.
Related products, Upsells, and Cross-sells
These are three types of product relations in Magento. Upsell, for example, is a product 
that you’d like your visitor to purchase instead the one that is already chosen, so it 
appears in the shopping cart. Such a product is always pricey and has better quality. 
Related products appear on the product page and can be purchased in addition to the 
product that the customer is viewing. As for Cross-sells, they appear on product pages 
and in the cart being products related to an impulse buy. All three types are optimized for 
better SEO in Magento 2.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
99
Universal Google Analytics, E-commerce Tracking, and 
AdWords Conversion
Universal Analytics adds a set of options aimed at collecting and organizing data for a 
better understanding of your customers’ behaviour and consequently improving current 
SEO. But before Google Analytics can report e-commerce activity for your Magento store, 
it is necessary to enable e-commerce tracking for your web site, which is significantly 
simplified in case of Magento 2. As for conversion tracking, it can help you find out how 
effectively your keywords engage your customers to perform certain actions. Therefore, 
it is another important SEO improvement introduced in Magento 2. All three features are 
available by default, which is a great SEO improvement introduced in Magento 2.
Google Tag Manager
Google Tag Manager provides the ability to create and update tags for your Magento web 
site any time you want, so you get better SEO opportunities. Please note that this Magento 
2 feature is available only for Enterprise Edition merchants.
SEO configuration
It is also necessary to mention that all SEO settings available in 1.X are still on their usual 
places under Stores/Configuration/Catalog/SEO.

Chapter 10 ■ SEO
100
Conclusion
The default SEO capabilities of the platform have been essentially improved in Magento 2, 
so it is more powerful than its predecessor. If the default SEO options are not enough for 
satisfying your business needs, then you can use various third-party solutions.
Please note that lots of core SEO improvements are still in progress, so you can check 
them on GitHub.
To improve your Magento 2 SEO even more, we recommend you choose one of the 
following extensions: Mageworx Magento 2 SEO Suite2, Amasty SEO Toolkit3, or Mirasvit 
Advanced SEO Suite4. These modules are all-in-one solutions designed to improve the 
search engine-friendliness of all platform areas.

CHAPTER 11
Performance
Good performance is a key aspect of a successful e-commerce project. It is not only important 
as a vital ranking factor, but is highly appreciated by customers. Thus, a fast online store often 
has a higher conversion rate than a slower one. As a result, it turns more visitors into buyers 
and helps to increase sales. Now, when the importance of Magento 2 performance is obvious, 
it’s time to shed light on how to increase it in the case of the platform1.
We already have a detailed guide to Magento 1.X productivity, but the second 
version of the platform differs a lot and requires another approach to performance 
improvements. Magento 2 is faster, less resource-hungry, and better optimized for high 
loads than 1.X. Besides, it offers a lot of new performance features out-of-the-box. For 
instance, you get native support for Varnish, Redis, and Nginx as well as full page caching 
in Magento 2. As for the first version of the e-commerce platform, all these features were 
only available through customizations and extensions.
Although Magento 2 provides better opportunities related to performance, there is 
still a lot of work to be done before your e-commerce store will be as fast as the platform 
allows. You can check the appropriate article on Firebear, The Magento 2 Performance 
Guide2, but now we will start with Nginx.
1https://firebearstudio.com/blog/magento-2.html
2https://firebearstudio.com/blog/the-magento-2-performance-guide-out-of-the-box-
features-extensions-tips.html

Chapter 11 ■ Performance
102
Full Nginx Support
Nginx has been developed with three core principles in mind: high performance, high 
concurrency, and low usage of memory. Thus, it significantly increases the speed of every 
web site. To handle requests, Nginx utilizes an event-driven asynchronous approach, 
while the default Magento 1.X is based on a process-oriented approach with the Event 
MPM as the asynchronous processing model. Due to event-driven architecture, Nginx 
shows more predictable performance even under higher loads.
As mentioned above, Magento 2 offers a native support for this solution, so it can be 
easily installed on top of the platform. To find out how to perform this procedure, check 
this Magento 2 Nginx Configuration3 guide. Besides, Magento 2 has a recommended 
Nginx configuration in the root folder. You can also check it on GitHub here.
Magento 2 and Redis
Redis is an advanced key-value cache which provides top notch performance and offers 
such features as value incrementation in a hash; pushing an element to a list; appending 
to a string; getting a sorted set of members with the highest ranking; and set intersection, 
union and difference computing.
It incorporates several use cases for in-memory datasets, which are the reason for 
high performance results. Thus, you can either persist it by dumping the dataset to disk or 
append each command to a log. Moreover, if you need a feature-rich, in-memory cache, 
the persistence can be disabled.
Additionally, Redis incorporates non-blocking synchronization and auto-
reconnection with resynchronization partial on net split. All these features make it a 
lightning-fast solution for every e-commerce web site, especially for a Magento store.
If you don’t know how to install and use Redis with the second version of the popular 
e-commerce platform, check this Magento 2 guide: Magento 2 Redis Configuration4.
Different Cache Types
Magento works with the following types of cache:
• 
Configuration cache appears when Magento gathers 
configuration from modules. It also includes store-specific 
settings from database and the file system.
• 
Layout cache includes compiled page layouts.
• 
Block HTML output cache consists of HTML page fragments per 
each block.
• 
Collections data cache gathers database queries.

4https://firebearstudio.com/blog/magento-2-redis-configuration.html

Chapter 11 ■ Performance
103
• 
DDL cache is designed to work with database schema.
• 
Entity attribute value cache includes Metadata related to EAV 
attributes: store labels, attribute rendering, search settings, etc.
• 
Page cache gathers data about generated HTML pages.
• 
Translations cache is related to merged translations from modules.
• 
Integration configuration cache is aimed at compiled integrations.
• 
Integration API configuration cache consists of compiled 
integration APIs.
• 
Web services configuration cache is the cache of a web API 
structure.
You can find appropriate configurations under System ➤ Cache Management. For 
further information, check our Magento 2 Cache Management5 guide.
Full Page Cache (FPC)
Full page caching is so powerful due to the ability to store the full page output in a cache. 
As a result, subsequent page loads do not require much server load. Thus, full page 
caching is mandatory for high- traffic web sites, as it keeps server load as low as possible 
and helps to avoid downtime even when traffic is really high. In addition, by using full 
page caching, you will increase the speed of your e-commerce web site, since all the 
server needs will be reduced to fetching and rendering pages from the cache.

If necessary, Magento can clean up this cache automatically, but you can still put 
any data in any segment of the cache manually. Please note that it is necessary to clean 
or flush FPC after modifying any code level that affects HTML output. Always keep this 
cache enabled, since it significantly improves the performance of Magento 2.
Varnish Cache
Varnish cache is an HTTP accelerator for heavily consumed APIs and content-heavy 
dynamic web sites. Magento 2 supports this cache out of the box, you can easily configure 
it for your e-commerce project to increase the default performance.
Every web server receives HTTP requests, but does not return HTTP responses 
immediately. Therefore, a long sequence of steps is required for each request. 
Multiplied by thousands of requests, these steps lead to server overloads, heavy resource 
consumption, and a significant performance decrease. Unfortunately, the server does not 
remember even repeated requests, but you can fix this problem with the aid of Varnish. It 
receives requests instead of your web server, looks at what’s being requested, and sends 
requests to your web server, which sends a response to Varnish to pass it back to the client. 
It seems that such a procedure only slows down the server, but the performance increase 
occurs when Varnish begins to store responses from the back end in its cache. As a result, it 
can rapidly serve further repeated responses without any need to connect to the back-end 
server. Besides, Varnish uses in-memory cache storage which makes it even faster.
As for Magento 2, this cache can be easily configured according to the requirements 
of the platform under STORES ➤ Configuration ➤ ADVANCED ➤ System ➤ Full Page 
Cache. For further information, check our How to Configure Varnish for Magento 2 
tutorial.

CSS Preprocessing
Although CSS has a very powerful syntax, it can easily grow to enormous sizes when 
working on non-trivial projects. Luckily, we can easily fix this problem with the help of 
CSS preprocessors: SASS and LESS. Both allow additional leverage over CSS by offering 
enhanced syntax, but for the Magento 2 development we will focus on LESS. It’s core 
features are:
• 
nested syntax;
• 
ability to define variables and mixins;
• 
operational and mathematical functions;
• 
multiple files joining.
If you are not familiar with this CSS preprocessor, pay attention to the following 
documentation:
• 
Magento 2 CSS preprocessing
• 
Create symlinks to LESS files
CSS and JS minification
In Magento 2, CSS and JS minification procedures are almost the same as in the case of 
1.X. By combining, compressing, and caching Javascript6 and CSS files, you can improve 
the performance of your Magento 2 web site. Thus, it’s only a matter of time when 
appropriate tools will be available. Besides, you can perform everything manually:

Chapter 11 ■ Performance
106
Catalog images caching
Magento pre-generates cropped product images in different sizes to reduce processing on 
every page load. Thumbnails are generated during the first image load and can be easily 
removed.
Code Generation
Code generation provides you with the ability to bring aspect-oriented programming, 
generic programming, and other complicated techniques to languages, which do not 
support them by default. As a result, you can improve Magento 2 performance and add 
unique features to the default setup. There are two ways to trigger code generation in 
Magento 2. First of all, you can perform it on the fly:
• 
Use a meaningful name that follows a certain pattern to declare a 
class.
• 
Now, the system should autoload the class. If it can not find it, the 
class will be generated.

Chapter 11 ■ Performance
107
Unfortunately, this approach slows down the system, so we recommend you utilize 
the command line. By using the following command, you will force the system to inspect 
the code and generate all necessary classes.
1   magento setup:di:compile
This approach speeds up the system, so it is useful for production.
With the aid of both approaches, you will get generated classes in the MAGENTO_
ROOT/var/generation directory.
For further information check this article: Introduction to code generation in Magento 2.
RequireJS for Improved JS Performance
There is the official documentation related to the configuration of JavaScript resources, 
but we are going to focus our attention on RequireJS. Being a JavaScript modular script 
loader, this tool is optimized for both JS environments and in-browser use; therefore, 
it is best suited for Magento 2. RequireJS is used to improve the quality of code and the 
speed of apps. Since JavaScript does not provide any ways for specifying code required 
to execute a file, RequireJS plays a crucial role in the improvement of JS development: 
it specifies dependencies between JS files and loads them into a browser. Such an 
improvement leads to a significant jump in performance; therefore, we recommend you 
check this article: Advanced Development with RequireJS + Magento 2 Tutorial7.
Session Storage Management
Another useful performance improvement is related to session storage management. You 
can move it from files to the database or Redis. Use the -session-save option with any of 
the following:
• 
db will move it to the database. It is necessary to choose database 
storage in case of a clustered database.
• 
redis will move it the Redis back end.
• 
files should be used to store session data in the file system.
We strongly recommend you store everything in Redis, since Magento 2 fully 
supports it and you can prevent your store from performance degradation. In case of a 
large number of users, both your database and file system suffer a dramatic decrease in 
productivity. As a result, your Magento 2 web site slows down, leading to a terrible user 
experience. Thus, Redis is the only reliable option.

108
Out-Of-The-Box CDN Support
Since Magento 2 also provides support for CDN support, media and static content can 
be loaded from separate subdomains located on different servers of CDN networks. CDN 
options can be configured under Stores ➤ Configuration ➤ Web.
PHP 78
Besides tons of new features and improvements introduced in PHP 7, we will get a 
language with completely new performance. It will be much faster than the latest 
available 5.X, and Magento 2 will fully support it. Thus, PHP 7 will change our 
understanding of how fast an e-commerce shop could be. For a deeper insight into  
PHP 7, check this post: PHP 7 - features, release date, rumors; and don’t forget to examine 
a current problem related to PHP 7 and Magento 2: String class name issue for php79.

Magento 2 vs Magento 1
You can compare the performance of both platforms via MageMeter, an amazing service 
from Inchoo. From the following picture, we can see that the latest Magento 2 beta with 
disabled caches already beats Magento 1 Enterprise Edition:
Magento 2 Extensions10
You can check our list of Magento 2 modules on the blog, but the platform is still too 
young to create a separate article related to performance extensions. We expect that 
all the most-wanted Magento 2 performance modules will replace their Magento 1.X 
ancestors. Improved Full Page cache , JS/CSS Minification , CDN services, and dozens of 
other tools will be available soon.

For instance, the second version of our Control for CloudFlare extension allows you 
to control the CloudFlare system directly from your Magento 2 admin. It offers better 
integration as well as more flexible connections between Magento 2 and CloudFlare than 
its first version. Thus, we anticipate that Magento 2 performance extensions will provide a 
better experience than their current analogs.
Besides, we recommend you check Magento 2 modules reviewed on Firebear. All 
tools are divided by companies: Magento 2 Extensions reviewed on Firebear11.
General Server Side Improvements
Although the new version of Magento offers tons of improvements compared to 1.X, 
there are still a lot of common performance optimizations. You can find all of them in 
our Magento Performance Ultimate Guide. Check the links below to find the appropriate 
tutorials”
• 
OPcache is a code-caching module designed to improve that 
part of your Magento 2 performance which is related to PHP. It 
uses a shared memory for storing precompiled script bytecode. 
Thus, OPcache eliminates the PHP’s need for loading and parsing 
scripts on every request. Therefore, by optimising OPcache 
settings, you can dramatically improve the performance of your 
Magento 2 web site. Follow this link—OPcache12 —for further 
optimizations.
• 
MySQL and alternatives. Properly configured MySQL is among 
the most important enhancements to the performance of 
Magento 2. First of all, it requires the understanding of your 
hardware; then, you should know what settings to use. But 
MySQL is not a necessity, since these are two reliable substitutes: 
MariaDB and Percona. Follow this link—MySQL13 —for further 
information.
• 
New Relic. A slow page is always a good reason to leave a 
webstore and never return again. Luckily, there are a ton of 
different monitoring tools developed for identifying the problem 
in a timely fashion, and one of them is New Relic. Follow this 
link—New Relic14 —for further information.

CHAPTER 12
Migration
After the launch of Magento 2, it is vital to understand how to migrate from Magento 1 
to Magento 2. Since the migration is a complex process with lots of all possible aspects, 
you should know what to do with themes, extensions, data, and custom features. In this 
chapter, we’ve gathered all information about Magento 2 migration1. Below you will find 
useful migration tips as well as reliable Magento 2 migration tools.
Magento 2 Migration: Requirements
Migration elapse time is among key requirements. While critical for big projects, it is less 
important for small sites. For a big web site, migration could take from several hours to a 
few days.
Keep in mind that it shouldn’t be necessary to take the site offline for too long. The 
problem is in performing a full bulk copy of the database. That takes too long. A variation 
of the catch-up phase is also required. This phase occurs after the main bulk copy and 
requires the offline phase.
It is important to place restrictions on operations that should not be performed 
during the migration. For instance, it is possible to place orders, but all the changes 
done by administrators are prohibited. It is also expected that developers are going 
to provide migration support for their extensions. There are two possible approaches 
to data migration for extensions. First of all, developers can provide the necessary 
documentation with the detailed tutorials about migration. There is also a possibility of a 
more flexible and pluggable framework that can automate the migration.
Magento 2 Migration: Current conditions
Both an export of database contents and an import into Magento 2 are too slow. The 
current design relies on a direct database-to-database data transfer.
A configuration file specifies which content should be copied from Magento 1 to 
the Magento 2 database. The official support went only to the recent Magento 1 releases. 
Earlier versions require the appropriate adjustment of the configuration file.

extensions-tutorials.html

Chapter 12 ■ Migration
114
Besides simple table copies, PHP code is also able to be plugged into the process. It is 
required to perform more complicated data migration.
To capture changes to selected tables during the bulk copy, database triggers are 
used. All these changes are saved in a table for later use. To reduce the number of triggers, 
you should limit the administrator actions.
The migration tool also works with product images. Sites that do not rely on the 
default image storage may require some additional actions.
Magento 2 Migration: The migration procedure
	
1.	
Create database triggers, which are necessary to capture 
increment changes.
	
2.	
Run the data bulk copy.
	
3.	
Stop all changes and make the old site offline.
	
4.	
Perform catch-up changes.
	
5.	
Delete all triggers from the old database.
	
6.	
Turn the new Magento 2 site online.

Magento 2 Migration Tools
Below, you will find the most robust tools designed to make Magento 2 migration seamless. 
There are both official and third-party software solutions described in this section.
Code Migration Toolkit
A new tool that simplifies migration to Magento 2 has been developed. As members of 
the Magento community, we’ve been waiting for a new migration instrument aimed at 
modules since the first announcement of Magento 2, and finally we’ve got it. Dubbed the 
Magento Code Migration Toolkit, the software solution will essentially change the way you 
used to work with custom Magento extensions while trying to port them from 1.X to 2.0.
With the Magento Code Migration Toolkit, you get scripts that streamline the 
conversion of custom 1.x modules to Magento 2 by automating time-consuming 
processes. The software solution automatically converts such important things as module 
directory structure as well as PHP, config.xml, and layout.xml files.

Chapter 12 ■ Migration
115
Please note that the Magento Code Migration Toolkit requires some manual 
operations to be performed. For instance, conversion scripts must be run in the specified 
order. Besides, it is necessary to edit some files in the installation manually.
As for prerequisites, they are the following:
• 
PHP 5.5.x+
• 
cthe omposer package management software
• 
designated source, which is Magento 1.x
• 
target directories of Magento 2
The installation procedure and module migration process are described on the 
Magento Code Migration Toolkit page on GitHub.

CHAPTER 13
Generating New Sales
The newcomers in the field of e-commerce often tend to have problems with gaining 
enough traffic to their web sites. It is quite difficult to attract customers if nobody 
even knows about your existence. Since making profit online requires a lot of time, 
investments, planning, and management, you have to be patient and consistent to get 
your web site out of the Google search abyss and increase your web site traffic. In this 
chapter, we’ll shed light on the most effective ways of sales generation in the context of a 
successful marketing campaign.
Evaluate your marketing campaign
With the e-commerce industry exceeding $294 billion of profit in 2014, it is not surprising 
that digital commerce is worth being called a competitive market. This, however, must 
call for more actions, because retailers, who think that their marketing strategy can 
bring money steadily for years, are going to lose everything just within several months. 
E-commerce marketing nowadays is a tough job requiring a lot of effort.
The most effective way of maintaining your business on the highest level is a 
constant control over the success of your current strategies and, if they fail in fulfilling a 
plan, the invention of better ones. Therefore, get ready for an intensive study of planning, 
implementing, and evaluating your marketing campaigns.
	
1.	
Understand your aims.
If you’re not really sure what you want to reach by your 
marketing campaign, you will not succeed in it anyway. Even 
if you spend a great amount of money on numerous ads 
believing that this is a successful campaign, you’re wrong. 
Thus, it’s important to make a clear plan of what you want to 
achieve by your strategy. For instance:
• 
Reach the amount of 1,000 orders per month.
• 
Obtain 500 new customers.
• 
Increase the growth of revenues by 30%.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
118
	
2.	
Identify metrics for measuring your campaign.
At the end of the first period, you can start measuring the 
results of a current strategy. For each aim established at the 
beginning, you will have to utilize appropriate metrics to 
calculate their value. For instance, if your aim was to gain 
more sales to your web site, the following rates must be 
considered:
• 
average amount of product page views
• 
percentage ratio of users that purchased your products to all 
users that viewed your web site during a certain period
• 
sum of total revenue
	
3.	
Implement comfortable metrics tracking.
Having your ads active allows you to easily monitor the 
amount of visitors coming to your web site and mostly all the 
activities performed by these visitors through the toolkit of 
your particular ad campaign.
Thus, you’re open to control all stages of a potential purchase 
from the very first view of a page to a complete product 
purchase. In fact, by using your ad stats you will get the 
exact rates for performing final calculations. For example, to 
calculate an overall conversion rate of a particular product, 
you may simply divide the number of its purchases by the 
amount of product page views for a given period.
	
4.	
Be original with every media representation of your site.
For each ad campaign, you should use different visual 
solutions to perfectly suit the social environment you want 
to integrate your web site with. For instance, if you create an 
ad on Facebook, make sure to use unusual color scheme or 
imagery which is likely to attract the major audience of the 
network to your web site. Sometimes you will even have to 
be minimalistic if you don’t want to spoil impressions of your 
customers.
	
5.	
Use UTM links to direct users to the most suitable page.
If you create ads on several web sites or platforms, it would 
be nice if you could see which of them brings the greatest 
amount of customers. Thus, you can utilize so-called UTM 
links which are basically specific parameters assigned to 
the main link. They can help you with tracking the amount 
of clicks performed with every ad as well as analyzing their 
efficiency in your primary campaign.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
119
There are numerous tools for creating UTM links, such as 
Google URL Builder and Terminus, but while the former is 
considered to be relatively easy to use, the latter contains a set 
of more advanced settings for experienced retailers.
The main UTM parameters for adjusting to an ad link are:
• 
source (web site at which your ad is located, e.g., Facebook);
• 
medium (variation of your banner, e.g., banner variation 1);
• 
campaign (name of your ad campaign, e.g., autumn collection).
The result should looks as follows:
http://yoursite.com/blog-post-fall-collection/? 
utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=bannerverision1& 
utm_- campaign=autumncollection
Add such link to all your ads and publish it only if you’re sure 
that it works properly.
	
6.	
Run some tests before publishing your ads.
It is important to test how UTM links work and whether they 
direct users to the right place. Try to produce all the actions of 
a potential customer starting with clicking on ads, browsing 
various product pages and ending with check-out. Then, go to 
your tracking page and see whether the metrics change their 
values. If everything is fine, proceed to the next step.
	
7.	
See the results.
In order to provide yourself with a convenient way of tracking 
your metrics, you can use several handy tools that will help 
you understand whether your goals are achievable. The best 
solutions are listed below:
• 
KISSmetrics—a flexible medium for effective tracking of 
major campaign rates;
• 
Google Analytics—good at dealing with UTM links;
• 
Converto—a more advanced tool which offers the ability 
to analyze the efficiency of all your ads and redirect your 
resources to more profitable channels.
Keep in mind that even if your campaign fails, with these 
analytical add-ons at hand you should identify which rates 
appeared to be insufficient and to calculate current losses. 
Using official ad tools on your advertising channels is also 
possible, but it often happens that rate values are different 
from what you might expect.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
120
	
8.	
Make a conclusion and prepare for further campaigns.
However, getting results is not your final destination yet. In 
addition to evaluating your campaign achievements, you 
should analyze each of your advertising channels to define 
which of them gained the biggest audience. For instance, 
you may discover that Facebook gave you 500 page views, 
among which 50 were purchases. Thus, we can suggest that 
Facebook is likely to be effective for attracting customers, but 
certain modifications of your ad campaign on this platform 
are required. If your Twitter ad campaign brought you just 200 
page views, but 150 of those still ended up with completing an 
order, this ad source is worth being invested. Those ad sources 
that brought you nothing but a few page views for the whole 
period should be discarded.
Finally, learn all your achievements and failures from 
the current marketing strategy and next time apply this 
knowledge for getting your business to the first positions on 
the e-commerce market.
The main traffic sources
As a retailer, you might be curious about what traffic sources can bring you the desired 
number of customers. In fact, everything depends on the size of your business. For 
instance, in case of a small store it is not profitable to rely on direct traffic, so you’ll have 
to look for other alternatives to achieve your marketing goals. Let’s look at some traffic 
sources and define their pros and cons.
Direct traffic
Direct traffic is a flow of users who come to your web site by typing in the direct URL 
address in their browsers. To make this source valuable for you, it is important to 
become a popular brand offline and provide people with the ability to engage with you 
and your products by actually going to your brick-and-mortar stores. In this case, all 
the investments must be made for a high-quality PR scheme and opening of an offline 
store chain. The principle disadvantage of this source is that it can only bring 10-15% of 
visitors. Besides, if you’re generally doing well with your offline business, you can look for 
more advanced ways of driving extra traffic to your online store.
E-mail marketing
This traffic source is considered to be one of the cheapest ones. Furthermore, it can 
be used for all possible kinds of business. The main priority of e-mail marketing is the 
ability to keep in touch with the existing customers and encourage them to make more 
purchases from your online store. This traffic source requires the following:

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
121
• 
Sufficient database volume
This means that you should have an adequate number of 
users to whom you will send your e-mails. You can either buy 
data or build it yourself. Buying data can be fast and easy, but 
it does not guarantee that users will react. After all, they don’t 
know you, so you’re likely to be marked as spam. Building 
your own e-mail list may seem more reasonable, but it 
usually takes a good deal of time to attract enough customers, 
especially if you’ve just started your business. However, you 
can use organic ways to encourage visitors to share their 
e-mail addresses with you. This includes creating visual 
incentives—for instance, offering bargains to your items to 
subscribed users.
• 
Frequent e-mail delivery
Any type of e-mail marketing campaign suggests that you 
should provide a regular e-mail delivery to your contact list 
users. However, this regularity should not exceed three emails 
a month, because frequent e-mailing will cause people, as 
well as e-mail services, to consider you as a spammer. When 
a smart e-mail service, such as Gmail, identifies you as a 
spammer, your e-mails are automatically sent to a spam 
folder, which prevents a recipient from even noticing it. Thus, 
you should be consistent but unobtrusive while gaining 
traffic.
• 
Appropriate quality of e-mail content
When it comes to building up content for your e-mails, use 
the information which can be found on only your web site. 
Goods and prices that don’t exist on your Magento 2 store 
will disappoint potential customers. Besides, don’t make your 
e-mails too long. Write only about the most relevant things 
that can make people interested in what you are doing. It’s 
often useful to combine textual content with catchy images 
to make it more user-friendly. For instance, you can write 4-5 
sentences to describe your content and then support them 
with a relevant picture representing your offer. Apart from the 
things mentioned above, we would like to recommend adding 
corresponding links to your web site.
Thus, you should manage e-mail marketing during the first days of your web site 
existence. Providing yourself with an opportunity to bring your customers back at any 
particular time can double your conversions and create friendly relationships between 
you and your customers. Despite the fact that e-mail marketing accounts for 10-30% of 
visitors, it won’t work for acquiring new customers, because you are unlikely to interest 
people who have never purchased your products.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
122
Apart from independent research and testing opportunities of your e-mail marketing 
campaigns, you can also utilize services of specialized e-mail marketing providers. They 
can consult with you (often for free) and give useful advice on how to get along with this 
source of traffic. The price for paid services varies a lot depending on whether you want 
to save your time and make the whole process run automatically or manage everything 
yourself. Such a service which combines a set of valuable e-commerce features with a 
reasonable price is MailChimp.
MailChimp
For a minimum of $10 per month, you can get high-end e-mail content that will be 
appealing to your customers. Moreover, you can also take advantage of regular analytics 
reports that will inform you about the current progress of your e-mail campaign. With 
MailChimp’s functionality, you will be able to easily improve your marketing performance 
by utilizing a set of its useful features, such as:
• 
E-mail Designer
E-mail Designer is an all-in-one editor which is based on the 
drag-and-drop principle. It can be managed from a PC and 
laptop as well as from a tablet or smartphone. Its built-in 
toolkit allows you to:
	
1.	
edit and resize images;
	
2.	
effectively interact with your team no matter where you are;
	
3.	
conduct a testing campaign before actually launching it;
	
4.	
store and retrieve your files in a specialized file manager;
	
5.

• 
E-mail templates
MailChimp offers a smart collection of predesigned templates 
which you can use if you lack enough time or experience 
for creating a good-looking design. So the only thing you 
have to do is submit the content and check how it looks 
with each particular template. In case you intend to code 
your own e-mail template, there is the E-mail Template 
Reference option that has a lot of useful information and 
recommendations on how to make a nice and working 
template for a successful e-mail marketing scheme.

start monitoring its performance through MailChimp’s smart 
reports, which provide you with detailed data such as the

• 
Integration with e-commerce platforms

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales

If you want to reach various categories of customers with equal efficiency, you will 
need to import all user data to your MailChimp account. Take into consideration that the 
service supports integration with Google Analytics, Magento and Shopify.
There are three plans available for acquisition on MailChimp: Entrepreneur, Growing 
Business, and High Volume Sender.
The Entrepreneur package is free of charge and has no expiration date. You can 
send a fixed number of 12,000 e-mails to 2,000 users each month. Also, you can sort 
your customer list out to manage e-mail delivery to target groups of customers. The 
plan supports e-commerce integration and the access to the pack of ready-to-use e-mail 
templates. The downside of this plan consists of the lack of support for analytical tools for 
monitoring the coming web site traffic. The Entrepreneur package is intended for small 
businesses that don’t have a large audience; this guarantees that every user will receive 
at least one e-mail per month. If you acquire more than 2,000 users, you will need to 
subscribe to a paid plan which widens the functionality of your account and allows you to 
send an unlimited number of messages. It will cost you only $10 per month.
The Growing Business plan supports unlimited monthly e-mail delivery to 600,000 
subscribers. You can use MailChimp’s official web site1 for calculating an actual amount of 
money required for a given number of users per month. For instance, a plan for up to 5,000 
users will cost you $50, while a plan for 10,000 will cost you $75. The same pricing works for 
the High Volume Sender package as well. The plan supports customer list segmentation 
and integration with e-commerce platforms. Additionally, you get an opportunity to 
manage your team work by using E-mail Designer and have a regularly available consulting 
team of experts to help you adapt the MailChimp system within your e-commerce store.
The High Volume Seller package suits large corporations with wide audiences 
(600,000 customers). It offers the ability to send billions of e-mails per month. You can 
automatically adjust your delivery due to provider responses and protect data with a 
two-factor authentication process, SOC II and PCI DSS certifications and security alerts. 
There is also access to a full API provided with detailed documentation and user guides. 
In addition, the package features multi-user accounts for agencies to manage their 
cooperative engagement and interaction with clients.

Organic search engine results
These are results displayed to a user after he enters a search request. The first appearing 
results usually contain the most relevant information, which is more likely to meet search 
requirements. That’s why organic search results almost never include advertising links in 
the top results. Even Google tries to divide relevant result links from ads, putting the former 
in the first place and moving the latter down to the lower positions. This means that placing 
your web site among the first positions requires high popularity among people or original 
and rare products and services which won’t create excessive competitiveness on the 
Internet. In addition to the things mentioned above, you need an effective SEO strategy.
In general, organic search results bring from 10% to 30% of visitors on a regular basis.

Paid search results
Paid search results, if used properly, can provide you with up to 50% of visitors, which 
is the highest rate among all traffic drivers. This source of customers usually requires a 
sufficient number of resources to be spent, since advertising tends to become more and 
more complicated for attracting people’s attention. In a perfect scenario, you should be 
able to invest in both offline and online stores to gain maximum profit from the paid 
search. Online marketing campaigns usually include the following methods: SEO, Pay Per 
Click ads, and affiliate marketing.
	
1.	
Search Engine Optimization
This technique is considered to be the most popular for 
increasing web site traffic because it can attain crazy numbers 
of visits. Please note that it usually takes months until SEO 
strategy shows its results, so you will need consistency and 
patience to gain the desired traffic flow to your web site.
Although the main SEO optimizations are described in the 
first chapter of this book, we’d like to draw your attention to 
this complicated process once again. The main issue related 
to search engine optimization is content, which means that 
you will have to work on the effectiveness of your texts and 
product listings. The whole procedure includes:
• 
Check and improve your product categories. Make sure that 
every product contains a sufficient amount of key-words 
(words and word-phrases that users are likely to type in when 
they search for these products on Google or any other search 
engine). Then, include these keywords in the most noticeable 
places of your web site: headers, item descriptions, image 
names, internal links, and body text itself.
• 
Make your text authentic. Work with professional writers that 
will make your descriptions, articles, and other text pieces 
readable and informative for potential customers. Your main 
aim is to put the most relevant information in proper order.
• 
Utilize landing pages. Originally, a landing page is a single 
web site page that contains relevant and crucial data for a 
viewer. For instance, you can create a customer-specific link that 
will direct a person from a search results page or an ad towards 
a certain product page containing a description, characteristics, 
and price. This is likely to motivate a user for a purchase.
• 
Ask bloggers and other retailers to mention your store on 
their web sites. This part is the most difficult one, because 
further success of your marketing campaign becomes in some 
sense dependant on whether your web site URL appears on 
other blogs or pages. It makes sense to be friendly in order to 
become successful.
• 
Submit your web site to various directories. Google, Bing, and 
Business.com must be your primary candidates.

Pay Per Click advertising
The Pay Per Click ads are really good at increasing your web 
site traffic faster than any other alternative solutions. This 
technology allows you to buy visitors on the web sites where 
you place your ads. Once users click on your ad, they are 
instantly redirected to your web site. As an advertiser, you 
have to pay to web sites owners for every single click.
The most popular Pay Per Click management service is 
Google AdWords which can bring you about 70% of paid 
search visitors. But before using it you should learn all the 
opportunities related to this Pay Per Click solution. Note that 
the service is full of other retailers many of whom occupy the 
top positions in search results.
• 
Analyze how many retailers sell the same goods as you.
• 
Make the most powerful set of keywords for your product ads.
• 
Work on the appearance of your ads (design, colors, images, etc.)
• 
Adjust retargeting ads for your web site. Retargeting ads are 
basically the same old ads but their aim is to track your web 
site visitors after they have left a web site page. For instance, 
when a person goes to your web site, nothing happens, but as 
soon as he or she proceeds to other web sites, your ad will be 
displayed on each of these sites.
• 
Note that cost-per-click or CPC options are always better than 
cost-per-mille or CPM options. Don’t pay for viewers—pay for 
their actions, especially if your goal is to capture leads.
• 
Your ads should have URLs with a unique tracking token. 
Thus, you will be able to test them and evaluate their 
effectiveness. Without this information you will never 
optimize your ROI.
• 
The writing style of your landing page and an advertisement 
on social media should correspond to one another. At least 
try to use the same language, otherwise you’ll confuse your 
customers.
• 
Provide high-quality content: avoid typos (if they are not a 
part of your creative campaign), make sure every image has a 
proper size, check if every URL goes to the right landing pages.
• 
Use A/B testing and try out different types of ads. This will 
help you choose better options and get the most out of your 
PPC campaign.
It is also worth mentioning that Pay Per Click management 
works in social network environments including Twitter, 
Youtube, and Facebook. An even more surprising fact is that 
you can use Pay Per Click ads on mobile devices.

Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing includes interaction with third-party web 
sites that will definitely come in handy when it comes to 
driving traffic to your store. Basically, these sites use the same 
methods as those mentioned above for selling your products 
“on their territory,” but it will require extra expenditures 
(about 10%) from every sale they make. The most reliable 
affiliate web sites are Affiliate Window, Linkshare, and 
Webgain.
Unfortunately, dealing with affiliates will involve additional 
investments into the development of specific data feeds 
obtained from your product database. These data feeds will be 
integrated into the affiliate’s own database to enable ordering 
of your products on their web site. Moreover, additional 
banners and newsletters that will be distinguishable from 
those you use on other advertising platforms are required. 
Keep in mind that you can track user activity on affiliate web 
sites by using Google Analytics platform.

Other useful traffic-driving techniques…
…to use on your web site
	
1.	
Simplified checkout
Approximately 50% of all abandoned check-out processes are 
caused by complex and unfriendly shopping experiences. The 
more complex and lengthy this process is, the less inclined 
customers are to make a purchase.. To increase sales, try to 
simplify the checkout experience:
• 
Choose the most user-friendly template for your shopping 
cart options.
• 
Simplify a sign-in process for returning customers.
• 
Reduce overall checkout time by uniting closely-related data 
in one checkout step.
	
2.	
Full shipping information
This concerns mostly information about shipping costs. When 
a customer literally bumps into a shipping price at the final 
step of his or her order completion, it often spoils a previously 
settled positive mood. The same happens when a shipping 
price is not exact, with a myriad of additional conditions 
and restrictions suggesting that the final sum is subject to 
vary significantly. Therefore, complex shipping costs and 
conditions increase the number of failed check-out processes.
The most reliable solution in this case is to put shipping 
information at the first steps of your checkout procedure 
and make the price as low as possible to avoid discouraging 
positive expectations from customers.
	
3.	
Mobile-friendly environment
There is almost nobody who doesn’t have access to a mobile 
device these days, and there are a huge number of people 
that spend much more time surfing the Internet from their 
smartphones and tablets rather than laptops or computers. 
This means you must adapt to the universal trend and 
optimize your web site for smartphones and tablets. Providing 
your customers with an intuitive mobile shopping experience 
will greatly increase your traffic and sales.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
128
	
4.	
Giveaways
Everybody likes getting things for free, and you can use this 
tendency to attract the attention of potential customers. It 
can be anything ranging from supporting mobile apps and 
extensions to handy accessories and packaging services.
	
5.	
Feedback opportunities
About 80% of all customers tend to make their purchasing 
decisions based on reviews they read on retail web sites. The 
most important thing is that reviews and recommendations 
can be used by consumers in order to provide additional 
information about your products to their colleagues and 
friends, making them even more valuable for retailers. 
Moreover, having reviews available makes your web site 
generally more reliable in comparison with those that don’t 
have this option. But in order to make it more effective, don’t 
hesitate to ask your customers for feedback. Not everyone is 
apt to leave it after purchasing a product.
Although reviews can be positive or negative, you must be 
ready to see both types on your web site. It’s not always the 
case that your products or services are bad, though. But it 
doesn’t matter what the reason for a bad feedback is. Think of 
it as a factor that can help you boost your market performance 
and increase overall traffic to your web site.
These techniques are also important when estimating the 
conversion rate of your web site. Abandoned shopping 
carts, zero returns from e-mail campaigns, and absence of 
feedback from your customers are the main factors affecting 
your conversion rate. Because this value plays the main part 
in determining how good your relationships with existing 
customers are, you will also have to be ready to take steps 
towards conversion rate optimization strategy.

Don’t give up on traditional advertising.
Although we live in the age of computers, it doesn’t mean we 
cannot use old-school methods anymore. It also concerns 
advertising, however controversial this sphere may be. 
Traditional advertising can be still actualized through 
magazines, newspapers, direct mail marketing, radio stations, 
TV, and even billboards. Moreover, it can also increase your 
web site traffic!

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
129
Consider such giants as Zappos, Diapers.com, Bonobos, and 
Amazon. Despite the fact that they are hugely popular on the 
Internet, these companies still rely on traditional advertising 
to keep their sales and web site views high.
	
2.	
Entertain your customers.
Using entertainment as a source of new traffic may seem an 
odd thing, but it really works. Try to turn on your imagination 
and think of various content which could bring you more 
customers since it is funny. One of the most commonly 
used entertaining elements in the sphere of e-commerce is 
a viral video. Viral videos are made by many world-famous 
brands, and their efficiency is considered to be proved due to 
enormous success they achieve afterwards. Some brands even 
adjust themselves to YouTube and create official channels 
where they promote their products by introducing them in a 
row of funny or creative video series.
	
3.	
Take part in offline events.
This might be especially useful if you have only an online 
store which has been recently launched. Apart from using 
traditional ways of e-commerce marketing, you can simply 
attend various offline fairs and other sales events to get people 
acquainted with your products and services. Accompany your 
attendance with original and colorful leaflets and product 
samples. Use all possible ways to make people visit your 
online store.
	
4.	
Expose your business to other e-commerce platforms.
If you don’t yet feel stable enough with traffic, don’t hesitate to 
promote your products on bigger e-commerce platforms such 
as Amazon and eBay. Millions of people visit these sites every 
day, so it’s likely that they will stumble upon your products for 
being original, cheap, or both.
	
5.	
Use banner ads.
This is another efficient technique for driving traffic to your 
Magento 2 web site. Since it is quite complicated, we’ve 
decided to devote a separate part of this chapter to banner 
ads. You can check it out below.
Banner Ads
This type of advertisement must be familiar to every e-commerce retailer, but many of 
them do not consider it to be as effective as previously thought. Firstly, because modern 
users are highly knowledgeable about computers and specifically the Internet, it’s not that 
easy to attract their attention anymore. The only reaction people experience when seeing 

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
130
an ad is utter irritation, because their presence on a web site is dictated by the need to 
read/watch something interesting or communicate with somebody rather than to click 
on some crazy-colored suspicious banners. As a result, retailers develop more original 
approaches and switch to more complicated banners, but the strategy still crashes due to 
ad blocking software, which is popular among users all over the world. In spite of these 
unpleasant facts about banner ads, there is still a green light for retailers to use them for 
driving traffic to their web sites. Below we will tell you how to use them properly.
How to use
Considering current problems related to banner ads, you may come to the conclusion 
that it’s almost impossible to profit from using them. But there are key conditions which 
are to be observed in order to make your banner ads work:
• 
Define a list of web sites relevant for your audience. If you think 
that having an ad everywhere can improve your situation, you’re 
highly mistaken.
• 
Spend more time on making your ads creative. Creativity still 
attracts attention, as it can be beautiful, entertaining, smart, and 
eye-catching.
• 
Make some tests before submitting your banner ad. If it does not 
work properly or cannot be monitored from tracking services, it’s 
better to fix all these problems before investing in it.
• 
Contact potential banner ad publishers directly. Being able to 
communicate with web site owners is a useful skill that provides 
the most favorable advertising conditions. You should sound 
natural and generous. These owners are basically the influencers 
of your products, so the more contacts you have, the more 
successful your banner ad campaign is.
• 
Be aware of the F-shaped view pattern. This is a general page 
view pattern and a common feature for everyone browsing the 
Internet. According to it, users tend to look at the top of a page 
first, then explore the content itself starting from a left side, 
proceeding to a right side and then back, then go to the middle, 
do the same left-right manipulations, and so on. You can use the 
knowledge of the F-shaped pattern to find the best place for your 
banner ads. Accordingly, it will be either the top of the page, or its 
left side. Unfortunately, when dealing with ad publishers, you will 
have to rely on their own ad placement priorities.
• 
Enhance your landing pages, since they are important for all 
kinds of online ads due to the ability to direct users to the most 
desirable places of your web site, either already existing or newly 
created ones. The main purpose of landing pages is to incline 
users to buy your goods. Thus, it’s up to you which place on your 
Magento 2 store will be a landing page.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
131
Where to buy
Basically, you will have to choose among two kinds of banner ads sources: individual 
publishers or ad networks.
Individual publishers
If you already have a list of potential banner ad publishers dealing with a similar market 
segment, go and contact their owners or advertising operators. Learn their prices and 
subscription conditions and decide how long you are going to work with them. Keep in 
mind that if you advertise on a particular web site for a long time, you may become easily 
recognizable by its audience and therefore more trustful. Therefore, you can obtain a 
stable number of loyal customers. But it does not mean that you don’t have to update 
your ads and their design regularly.
Ad networks
Ad networks are not niche-specific banner ad resources, but can be considered as a 
competitive alternative to direct ad publishers. Ad networks are usually a third party 
that chooses web sites to publish your banner ads on. Thus, they can save you time 
performing all the work instead of you. As for the bad side, it is harder to drive traffic 
to your store, and you are not able to communicate with publishers directly. The most 
popular ad network is AdWords.
AdWords
AdWords is Google’s official advertising program that is commonly used by businesses all 
over the world. It’s the first thing you’re advised to try in your never-ceasing attempt to get 
more traffic to your web site. With the help of this program you can manage your ads and 
choose the most appealing web sites to place them on. The main advantage of the service 
is its relatively low cost and easy break-up procedure. In addition, you can adjust the 
program so that your ads are seen only by local users, especially when you tend to attract 
more customers to your physical store. You also can place your ad right on a Google 
results page; therefore, users can go directly to a product page they get interested in.
How it functions
Keyword is a basic element of the AdWords toolkit that allows you to place your web 
site ads near the first positions of a Google search results list. You should simply create 
a range of the most relevant keywords based on your business activity or products. Be 
specific when choosing the most important keywords and give priority to two to three 
word phrases rather than simple words.
It is also important to mention that AdWords can show your ads on other web sites 
sharing Google-owned properties (like YouTube) as well as Google’s partner sites (like 
NYTimes.com or Families.com). The place on the web site used for showing your ad is 
called placement.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
132
AdRank is an additional value of AdWords that is used to determine your ad’s position 
on a web site or among search results. It also determines whether your ad will be displayed 
at all. You should remember, though, that the main factors defining an ad’s location are 
the amount of bids you offer (the sum you’re ready to spend) and the quality of your ad. 
As a result, the first and the most prominent positions in the list will be given to the ads 
with highest bids and quality. What’s even more interesting about AdRank is its ability to 
recalculate processing data and update positions of ads according to their current value.
As for bids and ad/web site quality, their value varies depending on the kind of 
ads you use as well as the kind of web site you have. Note that your actual bid is closely 
connected to your maximum cost-per- click bid, which is the maximum amount you 
could pay per one click. However, usually you’re charged less. Everything depends on 
the quality of your ad (which is calculated according to the expected number of potential 
clicks), ad relevance and landing page availability. Ad auction determines the maximum 
cost-per-click bid which is required to keep your ad at a given position.
How to fit into budget
One of the main drawbacks of AdWords lies in its competitiveness, i.e., constant 
competition among retailers for getting the best ad positions. The more money you offer, 
the more chances you get to appear among the first positions and, accordingly, get more 
clicks to your web site. Thus, a steady-developing retailer has to be able to invest at least 
$2,000-5,000 a month in an ordinary AdWords campaign. Nonetheless, buying web site 
traffic consists of more than clicks. The better retailer you are, the more bids you’re required 
to offer. So before starting your cooperation with AdWords, take the following into account:
• 
How much money are you ready to spend for a single day of your 
advertising campaign? Days are more relevant than weeks or 
months because you cannot predict how long your ad will bring 
you enough profit.
• 
Will you vary your daily bid into parts by bidding in specific times 
of a day? This ad scheduling is very useful and cost-saving if you 
know when your web site experiences the best-selling hours.
• 
Is your quality score high enough to be worth risking? If 
you’re not sure about the relevance of your keywords and the 
quality of your ad and landing page, it’s better to invest in their 
improvement first.
How to structure your ad campaign
Depending on the kind of ads you have, your approaches to an AdWords campaign 
will vary. Product ads usually tend to work out provided they are divided into definite 
categories; for instance, furniture products are better structured when categorized into 
beds, chairs, tables, and so on. Furthermore, you can specify each category by introducing 
single-size beds and double-size beds. That will make your ads more specific for potential 
customers, and will clarify which products are more popular than others.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
133
How to manage your resources
Working with AdWords requires certain time expenditures as well. The more developed 
retailer you are, the more profound ad campaign planning you should do. To buy 
internet traffic simply by putting some money into it is never enough. Using text ads is 
indeed easier, but it’s evident that for a range of products you should work on its proper 
listing in AdWords webpages, manage regular updates of assortment and price, and 
automate submissions to Google Merchant Center. These hard tasks often require hiring 
corresponding specialists, but the results will definitely be worth it.
How to launch an AdWords campaign
Below, we will shed light on launching an ordinary AdWords campaign for your Magento 
2 web site. Let’s start with some basic aspects, such as your AdWords account.
Create an account in AdWords
	
1.	
First, visit AdWords’ main page4 and choose Try AdWords 
Now.
	
2.	
If you already have a Google account, then you can simply 
sign in with the existing login and password; otherwise, tick 
“I do not use these services” and enter your e-mail address as 
well as a relatively strong password. Then solve a captcha and 
create an account.
	
3.	
Select your country, timezone, and currency you’d like to deal 
with. Google’s billing will highly depend on this information. 
Remember that after submitting this data you will not be able 
to change it.
	
4.	
Click Continue and verify your account through the link sent 
to your e-mail address.
Choose your ad campaign
Each campaign can be run on the same or various AdWords settings. It’s up to your tastes 
and possibilities. There are three basic settings areas:
• 
budget and bid amount
• 
optional elements that can be adjusted to the main ad structure 
through ad extensions
• 
specification of places where you want your ads to appear

Now, it’s time to look through settings:
	
1.	
Campaign name. This name will only be visible to you, but 
it would be great if you specify it according to your actual 
business goals. It’s not recommended to use default Google 
names in order to be able to find a particular campaign 
afterwards.
	
2.	
Type. Here you can specify what kind of ads you’re going to 
create. For novices in advertising it’s reasonable to select the 
“Search Network with Display Select” type of a campaign that 
allows you to gain access to the most popular ad placements. 
You can also choose a subtype of your campaign which 
determines the range of settings you will use for making an 
ad. The Standard subtype is preferred when you’re a newbie.
	
3.	
Networks. You can choose either Google Search Network or 
Google Display Network to manage the appearance of your ad 
on other web sites. The first option implies that your ads will 
be shown on Google-related web sites including YouTube and 
AOL, and the second option enables your ads to be shown on 
other web sites having partnership with Google.
	
4.	
Devices. You can work on this option later when you decide to 
optimize your ads for tablets and mobile devices.
	
5.	
Locations and Languages. Here you can choose an 
appropriate language for your ads, as well as a location that 
will provide only targeted location users with the ability to see 
your ads.
	
6.	
Bidding and budget. You can insert bids manually or delegate 
them with the help of this option. Remember that your default 
bid represents the maximum amount you’re ready to pay 
for your ad’s placement, while budget shows how much you 
really intend to spend for every day of your campaign.
	
7.

Create a new campaign.
	
1.	
Click on “Create your first campaign.”

You’ll be directed to the “Select Campaign Settings” page 
where you can set up all the previously mentioned categories.
	
3.	
At the end, don’t forget to click on “Save and Continue.” Later 
you’ll be able to edit most of the settings.
Ad Groups
After you’re done with settings, you will be automatically introduced to the “Create ad 
and keywords” page. It is possible to create an ad group here and use it as a part of a more 
general ad campaign.
Each ad campaign includes one or multiple ad groups depending on the type 
selected in Campaign Settings. Each group consists of an ad, specialized keyword set, 
and bids for its placement. With certain keywords for every ad group, you enhance the 
relevance of your ads in a list of search results. Therefore, an ad group should correspond 
to a particular type of product you offer. After creating an ad group, you can proceed to 
managing ads themselves.
Ads
There are different formats of ads available for your ad campaigns. Regardless of the 
format, it is required to create a separate range of keywords for each of them. The 
available ad formats vary from text and image ads to video and mobile ads.
Let’s have a look at the simplest text ad.
	
1.	
Choose “Create an ad” and click on “Text ad.”
	
2.	
Fill in the spaces by writing your headline, description, display 
URL (your homepage), and landing page. Note that both links 
have to belong to the same domain.
	
3.	
Type in your keywords in the appropriate section. The 
recommended minimum of keywords is 10-20.
	
4.	
Click “Save and Continue to billing” to activate your 
campaign.
Billing information

these steps:

additional settings available for your country. Input additional 
information.

2.	
Choose your payment method: backup credit card for 
automated payments (after your ads have been displayed) 
or a manual payment method (before your ads have been 
displayed). Please note that there are some restrictions related 
to certain countries.
	
3.	
If you chose backup credit card payment, you don’t have 
to perform any additional actions. Otherwise, you can pay 
for your first bid in “Settings > Billing” by choosing “Make a 
payment.” Don’t forget to choose the amount of a bid.
	
4.	
Now, you should provide additional payment information.
	
5.	
Save input data.
Creating a shopping campaign
The format of an ad campaign is valuable when you have a store with various product items. 
Ads of such format usually include an image, name, description, price, and landing page 
leading towards a product page on your web site. To enable shopping campaigns for your 
AdWords account, submit your product information in Google Merchant Center. Consider 
that a shopping campaign is especially useful when you are targeting specific users.
Setup
	
1.	
Click on “Campaigns” and then “Campaign > Shopping”
	
2.	
You will be forwarded to the “Campaign Settings” page. Type 
the name of your campaign in the first place.

Select your country and add Merchant ID information.
	
4.	
In the “Country of Sale” field select the country where your 
products are sold.

(advanced):”

shopping campaigns promoting the same product.
• 
“Inventory filter” will allow you to limit the number of 
product items you’d like to advertise.
• 
You can also activate “Local Inventory Ads” for your Local 
Products feed to Merchant Center.

“Bid strategy” allows you to adjust bidding options. If you 
set bids manually, use default parameters. For conversion 
tracking, choose enhanced cost-per-click (ECPC).

AdWords conversion pixel
AdWords provides its users with an opportunity to track their conversion rates based on 
customers’ interaction with your Magento 2 web site. This includes the number of ad 
clicks, product page views, app downloads, order check-outs, etc. Conversion tracking 
also features all the necessary tools for maximizing profit from you ad campaigns and 
reducing overall expenses. In addition, it sheds light on how good your ads are. The key 
element of AdWords conversion tracking is the conversion pixel tool which is basically a 
1x1 pixel image placed on one or several web site pages through a piece of code that you 
can copy and paste as a part of your primary ad campaign. This pixel effectively reacts on 
every activity on your web site including:
• 
ad clicks from affiliate web sites;
• 
checkout button clicks on a checkout confirmation page;
• 
clicks on referral URLs leading from your store, which allows you 
to track visitors even when they leave your page.
Despite the fact that Magento 2 does not support AdWords conversion tracking out-
of-the-box, there are a lot of third-party possibilities for effective integration. For instance, 
here5 you can find a handy module written in JavaScript. Its primary role is tracking 
conversions from a checkout/success page of Magento 2 stores.

AdWords experience:

Alternatives to Google AdWords
Many retailers are accustomed to think that Google Adwords is the most effective  
Pay-Per-Click management service for driving more traffic to web sites. However, it may 
often be not that efficient and even harmful for your business, especially if you’re a new 
entrepreneur. The problem is that you cannot realize the consequences until you invest in 
an AdWords campaign. Thus, you are facing the following:
• 
Rivalry. Being especially popular among large and highly 
developed companies, the AdWords platform makes it impossible 
for small businesses to be competitive. You will have to invest 
more and more just to be able to provide your ads with the best 
working keywords. With such cost-intensity, you’re likely to burn 
out at the very beginning of your campaign.
• 
Time wasting. As an e-commerce newcomer, you won’t be really 
knowledgeable in all the specifics of AdWords, so you will have to 
spend some time on getting acquainted with the toolkit. But such 
experiments are risky, because, again, you spend your money on 
them, and don’t know any end results.
• 
Vague bidding system. AdWords has a quite intricate system of 
money distribution. Although you can control the amount of bids 
you submit for you campaign and even invest as little or much as 
you can, you will spend much time trying to find out where your 
money eventually goes. Moreover, if you fail to be attentive and 
forget to set a proper management over your bids, you’re likely to 
lose everything.
This appears to be an uneven game where big corporations get the best advertising 
results and small businesses struggle uselessly for a more or less satisfying position in 
Google search results, since they have a tight budget.
In this situation, you have to think of other ad sources that could be more loyal and 
suitable for such a small business as yours.
	
1.	
ExactSeek
ExactSeek is a flexible advertising platform that allows 
retailers to attract many visitors to their online stores. It 
offers various programs from which you can choose the most 
appealing one.
Traffic Program. This program requires a quarterly 
subscription update and seems to be very profitable due to 
the relatively low cost of advertising services. All ads provided 
by this program can bring you up to 3,000 visitors during 
every subscription period. ExactSeek’s exclusive traffic-
gaining program targets users specifically from the UK, the 
US, Canada and Australia.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
139
Featured Listings. The program includes Traffic Program 
combined with simple sidebar ads implemented in search 
engine result lists and directories. Featured Listings tool offers 
low-cost investments and prevents you from tracking your 
ad performance, making additional bids, and inventing too 
complex advertising schemes.
	
2.	
Facebook Paid Ads
Facebook has its own advertising platform which helps 
new entrepreneurs with addressing themselves to certain 
demographics and audiences within a billion-member social 
community. The principal aim here is to create a separate 
Facebook profile which will represent your web site inside the 
social media environment. From there, you can try various 
advertising schemes to gain the maximum web site viewing 
results. The main advantage of Facebook Paid Ads is its 
simplicity and high efficiency.
	
3.	
Clicksor
Clicksor is another alternative to AdWords with targeting 
certain market segments. It has extremely cheap bidding 
offers; therefore, you can start investing from just five cents a 
month. Clicksor relies on time, contextual, and geo targeting 
to achieve the best advertising results.
	
4.	
Yahoo! Bing
Yahoo! Bing advertising platform is the second most popular 
service after Google AdWords which has a lot more to offer. 
If you decide to cooperate with Bing, you can forget about 
investing in other platforms, since apart from being advertised 
in Yahoo! Search results, you will get an opportunity to access 
the service’s ad partnership which includes such giants as 
Amazon and Facebook. Bing is very popular in the US, so you 
may already know what audience to target there. Moreover, 
bidding prices are significantly lower on Bing compared to 
AdWords.
	
5.	
Yahoo! Gemini Ads
This is an additional advertising tool from the Yahoo! search 
engine with the help of which you will effectively encourage 
people to visit your web site; but even if conversions remain 
low, you can be sure that your brand will become more 
popular than it is now. Gemini Ads works simply: you create 
an ad and then choose the most appropriate target audience. 
As always, add a couple of the most relevant keywords and bid 
for publishing your ad at specific resources.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales

6.	
BuySellAds
BuySellAds is not that popular as the ones described 
above, however, it is nonetheless effective. It has recently 
reached a milestone of selling over six billion ads a month; 
consequently, there are no reasons to omit it. First of 
all, BuySellAds is aimed at small businesses. It provides 
convenient ad monitoring conditions, as well as simple and 
transparent reports that show how your investments are 
spent. With BuySellAds you can easily monitor your current 
advertising performance and even pause regular investments 
in case of an unexpected money shortage.
	
7.	
BlogAds
BlogAds service offers more suitable advertising conditions 
for certain segment retailers. In fact, with the help of this 
platform you can advertise your products, using a blog format 
with various types of ads ranging from banners to custom 
skins. BlogAds actively cooperates with large blog web sites 
and social networks that contain easily identifiable target 
audiences. You should note that monthly prices on BlogAds 
vary depending on ad placement. The lowest price is about 
$150 a month.
	
8.	
StumbleUpon Ads
The main advantage of this service is that you can advertise 
here literally everything you want and still get nice rates of 
visits. However, numerous visits won’t necessarily bring you 
numerous customers, and StumbleUpon Ads is a place where 
you can become certain of this statement. Thus, the platform 
is more likely to be used for getting people acquainted with 
your brand rather than converting them into buyers.
	
9.	
Partner Promotion
Cooperation among individuals and companies can 
significantly influence your market presence. Thus, it is often 
enough to be mentioned in somebody’s blog to receive a huge 
feedback and enlarge the amount of your sales. That’s why 
you should always be sociable and head towards friendship 
with companies sharing your interest.
Social Media Advertising and SMM campaigns
Social media is still widely used for advertising and sales boost, and it’s hard to deny its 
efficiency in terms of e-commerce retail promotion. With millions of people surfing social 
network web sites, the traffic source is worth investing. Since different platforms unite 

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
141
people with various tastes and interests, you have lots of opportunities to reach your 
target audience. Unfortunately, social advertising is no longer free of charge. Sometimes, 
you will even have to pay as much as you would spend on an AdWords campaign, but 
there are still lots of opportunities related to this kind of advertising. Start your SMM 
campaign with the following steps:
	
1.	
Clarify your campaign’s objectives: increased traffic, 
engagement, clicks, etc.
	
2.	
Choose a right type for your campaign: you can use ads 
(boosted organic ads for everyone, specific promoted ads 
aimed at certain user group), share some brilliant content, or 
combine both approaches.
	
3.	
Define your target audience. Luckily, social media provides 
tons of information about users. Use this data wisely to find 
your customers and create an approach to uninterested ones.
	
4.	
Plan your budget. Set a total monthly budget and calculate a 
daily budget.
	
5.	
Design your ads. Note, that different social networks have 
different requirements for the content of ads, such as image 
size and resolution, or a number of characters.
	
6.	
Always be on. Note that a quick response can turn your visitor 
into a buyer.
	
7.	
Work with shopping in mind. Socializing is the main reason 
for people to spend their time on social networks. Therefore, 
you should pay attention to making shopping better with the 
help of these services. Sometimes it is enough to add social 
sharing buttons and enable customer reviews in order to gain 
maximum profit from social networks. At least, these are core 
requirements for every e-commerce store. At the same time, 
you can incorporate social media experience into every aspect 
of your Magento 2 web site, so don’t hesitate to provide your 
customers with the ability to use their social network profiles 
everywhere from login to checkout.
	
8.	
Combine social media strategy with other marketing 
strategies. You can always enhance your e-mail marketing 
template with the help of social sharing options. Moreover, 
think of utilizing your social media connections to multiply 
customer subscriptions to your mailing list. And don’t forget 
about Google+ and its influence on search results.
	
9.	
Avoid self-serving. Rely on an 80/20 ratio, where 20% is your 
promotional content, and 80% is the content that engages 
your customers.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
142
	
10.	
Use promoted posts. Usually, such posts don’t include 
any advertising information, drawing users’ attention by 
introducing some truly useful information like how-to guides, 
interesting facts, digests, photos and videos related to your 
activity, downloadable e-books, etc.
	
11.	
Think of target ads. Using target ads helps you get to a specific 
social media audience and, as a result, increase web site traffic.
	
12.	
Utilize specific social media for specific purposes. For 
example, business-to-business e-commerce advertising will 
be more reasonable on LinkedIn; at the same time women-
related products can attract Pinterest users. Thus, you should 
figure out a demographic majority of a social network you’re 
going to use for online advertising.
	
13.	
Reward your social followers. Provide them with exclusive 
offers, bonuses, and discounts. Do you like feeling special? Of 
course, you do, so why do you think your customers wouldn’t 
like being treated the same way?
	
14.	
Social media marketing strategy and visual content:
• 
Create eye-catching visual content.
• 
Include infographics and video content in your social media 
campaign.
• 
Run video ads with good CTAs12.
	
15.	
SMM and SoLoMo (social-local-mobile technology)
• 
Rely on real time engagement to get loyal and highly-active 
customers.
• 
Utilize both offline and online marketing data to track 
individual and collaborative performance.
• 
Reach people with the help of mobile versions of your ads 
(especially Facebook ads).
• 
Use local awareness ads.
• 
Try to increase conversions and decrease CPA. Get the lowest 
possible cost per acquisition.
• 
Rely on advanced data insights and social media marketing 
analysis in a combination with ROI- driven advertising.
	
16.	
New platforms
• 
Don’t limit your SMM campaign to Facebook and Twitter only.
• 
Explore your traffic in order to understand where your 
audience hangs out.

• 
Learn preferences and tastes of your target audience.
• 
Don’t try to conquer all social networking services.
• 
Find new social ad channels.
• 
Allocate budget wisely and reduce wasted ad expenditures.
• 
Try to avoid using outdated social media tactics.
• 
Experiment with new platforms and approaches.
In any case, you should analyze the results of your campaign. 
Thus, you will be able to make vital improvements and fixes 
and, as a result, enhance its future productivity. It is extremely 
important to take all your mistakes into account, as well as 
utilize all past practices. Always try to find answers to the 
following questions:
• 
Did you get the expected results?
• 
What is the ROI of your campaign?
• 
How did a conversion rate change?
• 
What are your mistakes?
• 
How could you improve a future campaign?
Now let’s take a look at various social media ecosystems and proven ways of 
advertising within these ecosystems.
Facebook
Facebook is the most powerful source of online advertising in a social media sphere. 
Since this network is surfed by all possible users, you can easily reach people who might 
be interested in products you are selling.
Start with creating your official store page on Facebook. You can do it even more 
easily by linking your personal page to it:
• 
Go to Options and select “Create page”
• 
Choose the most appropriate business category (i.e., local 
business, company, brand, entertainment, etc.)
• 
Specify the chosen category to fit your industry type.
• 
Agree with “Facebook Terms and Conditions” and click  
“Get Started.”
Furthermore, you have to fill your new business page with content. The procedure 
is quite similar to personal page content management. You should necessarily include a 
description of your store, create a profile image which might be basically a logo of your 
company, and add this page to your personal page’s Favorites (to get immediate access to it).

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
144
Of course, there are several helpful features aimed at increasing the performance of 
your Magento 2 web site on Facebook. The most reliable ones are described below.
	
1.	
Custom Audiences is a handy tool that allows you to monitor 
those users who come to your web site from Facebook. 
Moreover, you can even identify which pages they have seen. 
It is possible due to the aforementioned conversion tracking 
pixel. With the help of the data gathered by this pixel, you get a 
better understanding of your customers and their preferences.
	
2.	
Lookalike Audiences is another useful Facebook tool that 
gathers information about the existing customers and utilizes 
it for searching new users that might be interested in your 
products.
	
3.	
Friend-to-friend Payments is an additional payment method 
for your store. All Facebook users can now link their debit or 
credit cards directly to their personal pages and purchase any 
products right there. As a retailer, you can adjust this feature 
to eliminate the necessity for your customers to visit your 
Magento 2 web site and struggle through a standard checkout 
procedure.
	
4.	
Dynamic Product Ads is a library of cool ad templates 
that considerably simplifies the process of creating ads on 
Facebook.
	
5.	
Multi-Product Ads allows you to display several products in a 
single ad. It increases your chances to grab the interest of your 
target audience.
If you still have questions regarding Facebook advertising management, 
we recommend you look at this profound video-lesson13 devoted to effective online 
advertising.
The Best Facebook modules for Magento 2
Facebook covers a vast variety of demographic groups, which can help you build a good 
stock of loyal audience that always looks for new items on your digital shelves. Utilizing 
Facebook’s endless potential for attracting new customers will become even more 
effective when you connect your Magento 2 store directly to the social network’s features 
and functions, choosing specialized Facebook modules for Magento 2. Since there are 
lots of various extensions available for Magento 2, below you will find only those that are 
really worth being used.
Facebook Store Application14

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales

This extension offers a complete integration with Facebook as well as an opportunity to 
customize almost every feature. Developers from StoreYa provided their product with a set 
of tools that can import all your web site data to a corresponding Facebook page with just 
one click. Moreover, the module is easy to use, so you won’t stop trying to enable or disable 
a specific feature. Facebook Store Application contains a flexible stats dashboard allowing 
you to monitor visitors coming from Facebook to your web site, a number of clicks made to 
get there, and products that tend to be more popular than others. In addition, your Facebook 
store will be available in all languages, as well as accept transactions in all currencies. The 
extension is free and adjustable for sharing content across various social platforms.
Twitter
Since this social media network is in second place by the amount of users after Facebook, 
it is necessary to utilize it for promoting your business as well. Although Twitter shares 
many features typical for other social networks, it also has a certain amount of unique 
stuff that makes it more appealing for online advertising. Let’s consider Twitter’s unique 
features:
	
1.	
Promoted tweets are basic types of ads that require using 
small input space to attract customers in the most concise 
way. Thus, you can promote the most relevant products of 
your web site, the upcoming items of your company, and 
marketing events you take part in by putting them into a 
neatly structured tweet.
	
2.	
The Promoted accounts feature lets your brand account 
appear among the leading positions of the Who to Follow 
list. This will primarily gain more audience to your store and 
evoke extra interest in your current inventory.
	
3.	
Promoted Hashtags are available for the most successful 
merchants due to high cost. They are placed in the Trends 
widget in order to make users notice and discuss them in 
their feeds. Moreover, users often click on hashtags to find all 
related tweets and discussions.
	
4.	
Liking product-related tweets is a pretty smart promotion 
scheme that allows attracting Twitter users’ attention to 
your brand. For instance, if your business concerns making 
furniture, you can use Twitter Search to look for users that 
have your keywords in their posts (like “new bed,” “furniture 
store,” “nice wooden tables”) and add their posts to Favorites.
	
5.	
Twitter Offers is an official Twitter feature that enables 
merchants to create card-linked promotions and share them 
with other Twitter inhabitants.
	
6.	
Quick Promote Ads. To use this Twitter feature, you need an 
advertising account. According to it, your tweets will target 
those users that are interested in your current followers.

Twitter modules for Magento 2
Of course, managing your Twitter profile apart from the web site will not work unless you 
link it to your store page. Check one of the first Magento 2 Twitter extensions here.15
Instagram
Despite Instagram being considered less adjusted for advertising, it still attempts to 
level up as a competitive social marketing platform. Merchants are now widely using 
Instagram for posting the photographs of their goods to attract the attention of local 
users. There are more than 475 huge companies on Instagram. Such giants as Disney, 
Electronic Arts, The Gap, and Taco Bell implement their ad campaigns with the help of 
Instagram. This social networking service still lacks real advertising features, but there are 
already numerous methods created to boost your efficiency on Instagram:
	
1.	
Carousel ads is a feature that has recently been launched 
within the network. It enables merchants to add multiple 
photographs into one post. Images are simply swiped left, so 
there are no obstacles for you to grab users’ attention. Such 
brands as Samsung, Banana Republic, and L’Oreal Paris have 
efficiently used this feature for their campaigns.
	
2.	
Specific amount of hashtags adoption. According to recent 
stats, e-commerce merchants prefer using more hashtags 
than any other businesses which work on Instagram. The lack 
of keywords and links is the main reason of such behavior. So 
don’t hesitate to utilize hashtags, but use them wisely.
	
3.	
Feedback to your followers is the most powerful action on 
Instagram because it helps you get more trust and loyalty. 
An individual approach is likely to bring positive results from 
your interactions within this social media service.
Instagram extensions for Magento 2
If you intend to make Instagram your primary social media traffic source, you will 
simplify your goal with specialized Magento 2 extensions developed for the best practices 
in interaction with Instagram users. We will update this section of the book right after the 
first Twitter extensions for Magento 2 is published.
Pinterest
Pinterest is a visual content social media network that consists mostly of US users. 
Another useful demographic fact is the ratio between female and male users: women 
account for about 80% of all Pinterest users. Moreover, most of these women are in their 
forties; consequently, you get a sufficiently reduced target audience. But you still have the 
chance to get new customers here, so don’t give up on this network.

So what should you do in order to drive more traffic to your Magento 2 web site?
	
1.	
Create multiple company boards. Each board can be devoted 
to a specific type of your product. Additionally, try to utilize 
more creative, sensitive, and even touching images that are 
somehow related to your product.
	
2.	
Provide short descriptions, direct links, and prices to your 
item images.
	
3.	
Give preference to lighter, taller and no-face images. 
According to statistics, these tactics boosts the amount of 
repins to 23%.
	
4.	
Place a pin button on your web site to provide your customers 
with the ability to share your products with their followers.
	
5.	
Use both rich pins and promoted pins features for your ad 
campaign. Although these features are not free, they are rather 
effective in a Pinterest environment. Rich pins allow you to 
include additional information about your products including 
prices, sales, quantity, and brand. Promoted pins are designed 
to enlarge your audience.
	
6.	
Utilize effective hashtags, since there is only one you’re 
allowed to have on Pinterest.

sites. Magento 2 platform also has a wide range of free blogging solutions which you can

Real Time Social Experience with Periscope and 
Meerkat

Both Periscope and Meerkat produce live streams, which is their core common 
feature. Another aspect is integration with Twitter, but in the case of Periscope links-
sharing is optional, while Meerkat tweets all content automatically. Thus, Periscope users 
can easily control their audience of viewers.
Another difference consists of the availability of recorded content after the end of 
your stream. Periscope keeps videos 24 hours, while Meerkat doesn’t provide any storing 
capabilities, which leads to a broken user experience. In addition, Periscope provides 
more tight integration with Twitter: you get access to your followers right within the app.
Periscope is currently used by such giants as Pepsi’s Mountain Dew, Spotify, and 
DKNY. Starbucks and MasterCard are among Meerkat’s prominent users. When it 
comes to the number of users, Periscope also holds the lead position. But what about 
e-commerce opportunities?
Since videos have always helped in becoming transparent with customers, live 
streams play a prominent role in this process. You can easily inform your target audience 
about any latest offer or product by using social streaming services.
There is also an opportunity to show your business from inside, since you already 
have lots of customers interested in this information. Moreover, this will help you to get 
new ones. Note that a live stream is a great tool for establishing credibility among your 
target audience. You can even stream live demos of your products, which will make your 
e-commerce business even more attractive. Thus, by providing live lessons related to 
products you sell, sharing some interesting facts, or offering any other engaging content, 
you will utilize the e-commerce opportunities of Periscope and Meerkat:
	
1.	
Place your customers in the middle of flash sales.
You can easily engage your customers with the help of 
Periscope or Meerkat by placing them at the center of a flash 
sale. You just need to start a live broadcast of your event and 
make customers communicate with you. This should look 
like a TV show: your customers are not only situated on your 
e-commerce web site, they’re live on the air with you.
	
2.	
Introduce your e-commerce business with the help of Q and A 
session.
There are probably dozens of customers willing to ask 
questions about your business. Don’t send them to the FAQ 
section of your web site because there is a better solution. You 
can gain their confidence with the help of Q and A sessions. 
You just need a Periscope or Meerkat live stream. Don’t be 
afraid to show yourself to your customers: by being relatable 
you will push your e-commerce business to a new level.
	
3.	
Build product awareness and grow your sales.
Ask your customers to add their real-life examples while you 
broadcast product information. This will not only help with 
building product awareness, but also increase consumer 
confidence and, as a result, sales.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
152
	
4.	
Provide the customer with better user experience.
You can utilize live streaming for your customer support 
needs. Thus, you will be able to provide help not only to a 
particular customer, but to the whole audience of your buyers.
	
5.	
Get real time feedback.
Ask buyers to leave feedback to your goods and services in 
real time. You can call them or even invite to broadcasting 
events. If someone famous is using your products, ask this 
person to take part in the streaming.
	
6.	
Turn all your offline events into online ones.
With the help of both Periscope and Meerkat, you can easily turn all your offline 
events into online real-time translations. Since you have customers who are not able to 
take part in your events, you will provide them with such opportunity.
The following tips will help you maximize the effectiveness of your Periscope or 
Meerkat campaigns:
• 
First of all we recommend you think about personalization: greet 
your viewer by nicknames or names; stay polite; don’t be afraid to 
say a name every time you answer a question or address a user.
• 
Announce your live streams a few days before you go live. You 
should do this on all possible platforms, as well as on your web 
site. You can also use eye-catching banners to attract more 
attention.
• 
Never omit questions. It’s always better to say that you don’t know 
the answer.
• 
Being in a landscape mode, Periscope still displays messages from 
your customers in a portrait mode, making a stream inconvenient 
for viewers. That’s why you should use it in a portrait mode only.
• 
Both Meerkat and Periscope are tightly connected to Twitter. 
You should always remember this nuance while creating a title 
for a new broadcast. Use the following hashtags to increase 
your findability on this social network: #periscope; #werelive; 
#livestream; #livebroadcast.
Social influencers for promoting your products 
online
One of the most up-to-date methods of gaining some traffic to your web site is dealing 
with famous people on the Internet. They include media personalities, bloggers, vloggers, 
and even social media accounts run by different people all over the world. All of them are 
perfect as marketing channels to boost sales on your web site. This marketing technique 

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
153
might be particularly interesting for those who have recently launched their business, but 
now suffer from the shortage of traffic.
	
1.	
Get to know some Instagram influencers.
Instagram is now very popular among younger audiences, and 
it may become crucially tempting to attract new customers 
from such a crowded place. Moreover, it was found that 
Instagram is the platform giving 25% more customers to those 
brands that integrate their products with the local influencers 
than any other social media networks.
So, if you intend to find influencers for promoting your online 
store on Instagram, start looking for primarily those accounts 
that specialize in activities that might be directly or indirectly 
connected with your goods or services. The common mistake 
in this case is to look just for the most popular users with a 
great amount of followers. It’s more likely that you will tap into 
a community that has nothing to do with your web site at all.
To make your search even more productive, use a handy 
web site called WEBSTA that keeps all the popular Instagram 
hashtags and user information in its database. Users with an 
impressive amount of followers usually don’t limit themselves 
by having only their Instagram page. Probably, they have 
their own web sites and blogs. Meanwhile, Instagram plays 
the role of an additional promoting source. Having found 
several potential candidates, don’t forget to look at their bio 
or contact page. Web site links and e-mail addresses are the 
main indicators of the fact they don’t mind cooperating with 
e-commerce businesses.
Another way to target influencers on Instagram is through the 
official mobile app. You can basically browse “the popular 
page” with thousands of the most popular photos in search 
of those that somehow relate to your business. Through them 
you can reach the owners of those photos and contact them 
through e-mails (if possible).
The final thing is to write to the chosen Instagram account 
holders to attract their attention to your web site and its 
products. You basically have to write a letter, which must be 
as neutral and loyal as possible, saying that you’re a fan of a 
person and his or her posts, and you’ve just launched your 
own web site dedicated to the things you’re selling. Further, 
you should kindly ask a person to try a sample of one of your 
products and share it with his or her followers. At the end, you 
can attach one or two images of your product. Alternatively, 
you can just leave a link to your web site page.

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
154
	
2.	
Look for popular YouTube vloggers, bloggers, and press.
Like Instagram, YouTube is full of popular users, and, what 
is more important, they don’t mind promoting stuff which is 
not only a part of their target subject but also stuff that is not 
related to their subject at all. To reach out to the appropriate 
vloggers, you can use the native search engine of the web 
site by typing keywords that describe your business interest. 
The same traffic-gaining strategy is applied for bloggers, but 
can be realized through the Google main page. It’s worth 
noting that targeting bloggers with less followers is often more 
profitable than targeting those with thousands of them since a 
small audience is usually more loyal to its blogger, his content 
and advertising than a big one.
As for the press, you might have paid more attention to local 
news sites rather than global ones. Here, however, you have a 
chance to promote your products only by writing about them 
in the most original way and presenting it as a good pitch: 
laconic and interesting to read. So if you want to grab the 
attention of the press, make your story concise and valuable.
	
3.	
Do some smart advertising on Reddit.
This platform is very useful in terms of its mechanics, which 
allows you to get involved with an appropriate user category 
right through a corresponding thread called subreddit. There 
are thousands of subreddits devoted to every possible subject, 
so you’re likely to find what fits you the best. But the thread 
which must be of the utmost importance to you is always in 
“/r/entrepreneur” subreddit. There you will find a lot of useful 
discussions concerning business and ways to improve it. “/r/
smallbusiness” is another option for new entrepreneurs.
If you managed to find a subreddit dedicated to your web 
site content, you can post unobtrusive little sentences there 
containing a nice and catchy offer to purchase your products 
for satisfying user needs. However, if you exaggerate with this 
offer, you’ll probably be banned. That will bring you no actual 
profit. Therefore, read general and/or local Reddit rules first.
	
4.	
Convert your family and friends into customers through 
Facebook.
Making advertising posts on your Facebook page seems 
legit and, what’s more important, free. Moreover, this way of 
attracting customers is one of the first free online advertising 
methods being adopted by thousands of businesses all over 
the world. It might not bring you much profit after all, but you 
shouldn’t lose the opportunity of making a few customers out 

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
155
of the people you know. You can even make a 50% discount 
for them: allowing your friends and family to behave as special 
customers can make them become loyal buyers, after all.
	
5.	
Extend your web site to Twitter * It’s also a good idea to create 
a separate Twitter profile for your web site, but it’s certainly not 
enough for getting more traffic to your web site. * The initial 
strategy in this case is the same: use appropriate keywords and 
find people posting tweets about content related to your web 
site. * The next step is to follow those people, as they might 
become interested in what you’re doing. * Take part in your 
product-related events such as fairs or presentations; make 
sure you post a tweet with cool photos. * Inform your followers 
about new stuff coming out—keep their interest warm.
	
6.	
Mention your potential influencers in a profound blog post.
This method might become one of the most effective ones, as it’s probably going to 
get through to target influencers’ hearts. The only thing you need to do is to write a blog 
post about their activities combining all the information you have under a unified title 
and catchy introduction. When writing about their blogs, don’t forget to mention their 
names, because this is what will make a good job for your web site.
Amazon Product Advertising
There is nothing more reasonable than advertising on Amazon since this is the biggest 
and the most popular e-commerce platform that ever existed. It’s no surprise that the 
company works hard on allowing merchants to fulfill their marketing ambitions in the 
easiest way. However, if you want to turn your web site into the primary destination for 
Amazon users, then Amazon Product Ads is what you really need to utilize.
In general, Amazon Product Ads is a program for external businesses selling their 
products outside the Amazon platform, which plays the role of a product promoter 
attracting more customers. How to start using it?
	
1.	
Create Amazon Product Ads account here32. If you already 
have one account, simply sign in on the same page.
	
2.	
Then you can go to the “Settings” bar and select “User 
Permissions.” Here, you will get a pretty long list of product, 
advertising, report, and additional settings which you have to 
either check or uncheck depending on your preferences. Save 
the changed permissions.
	
3.	
Complete your account information. Go to “Settings > 
Account Info.”
32https://services.amazon.com/content/sell-on-amazon/sponsored-products.htm

Chapter 13 ■ Generating New Sales
156
	
4.	
Set a daily budget by clicking on the corresponding category 
in the “Advertising” bar. The daily budget setting page is rather 
straightforward, which means that you can set only one price 
for all your ads on Amazon.
	
5.	
Then you’re able to upload a product list file by selecting “Add 
Products via Upload.” In the new window click on “Download 
Template.” You will have to choose the most convenient 
template format here.
	
6.	
Amazon Product Ads requires using the following attributes: 
category, title, link, SKU (stock keeping unit), and price. Thus, 
you should be ready to edit your uploaded product feed 
according to the requirements above.
	
7.	
After you have uploaded your product feed, wait while it is 
processed. You should also check Status Report for errors.
	
8.	
Later, when you decide to change the bidding amount or 
update your inventory, you will have to upload a new product 
feed to Amazon Product Ads. Seems tough, but if you find 
Amazon helpful, it’s the only way to get the maximum from 
the marketplace, since there are no alternative solutions.
Keep in mind that every SMM campaign is unique. Try to figure out all the particular 
proprieties of your e-commerce business in order to create the most effective social 
media strategy. You can rely on third- party social media companies, hire a social media 
marketer, or do everything with the help of existing specialists. It’s up to you, but core 
principles of a successful campaign will always be the same.

CHAPTER 14
Security
Although Magento is the safest e-commerce platform, there are still additional security 
tricks, which make it even safer. Thousands of Magento web sites have been hacked 
during the last few years. Luckily, there are several useful methods developed to fix all 
the major problems. Below, we’ll tell you about the most important security tips. You can 
check whether your storefront is secure and unaffected on MageReport.com.
	
1.	
Name & Password
You should make all your Magento passwords unique and 
strong. The same is true about an admin name. This simple 
step will help you improve the security of your web site. Just 
create a password which is longer than eight characters, and 
to some extent you will prevent your store from being hacked. 
Note that passwords should combine numbers, letters, and 
special characters. Indeed, do not use weak usernames such 
as ‘admin’ or ‘administrator’. If you are using an insecure 
name and password, you can always change them in “System 
> My Account.”
	
2.	
Custom Path for Admin Panel
A default path to an admin panel has the following 
construction: “http://storename.com/admin.” Everyone 
knows it, consequently it is among Magento’s security 
vulnerabilities. By changing it to a more complex path, for 
example “http://storename.com/superadmin,” you push 
the security of your e-commerce web site to a new level. This 
small step is the best defense against Broken Authentication/
Session Management Attacks.
You can always change the Magento admin path in the 
“app/etc/local.xml” file. Find the line which contains 
“<![CDATA[admin]]>” and create a new string instead of 
admin, for instance “superadmin.” The new code should look 
like the following: “<![CDATA[superadmin]]>”.

Chapter 14 ■ Security
158
	
3.	
Two-Factor Authentication
Another reliable security technique is a two-factor 
authentication. It adds an additional security layer 
to an existing one. The system requires two separate 
authentications to provide users with access. Thus, your 
Magento web site becomes two times more secure. You can 
provide your admins with the two-factor authentication 
solution using Two-Factor Authentication by Xtento1.
	
4.	
Encrypted (HTTPS/SSL) Connection
One more essential security improvement is the usage of 
the HTTPS/SSL secure URLs. Being HTTPS/SSL-encrypted, 
your e-commerce web site will be PCI-compliant as well. It 
means that you will get a secure data transfer between your 
site and server. Otherwise, there is a risk that data (database 
information and login details) will be intercepted by hackers.
To enable the HTTPS/SSL secure URLs, you should go to 
“System > Configuration > General > Web.” Then, it is necessary 
to change ‘http’ to ‘https’ in the Base URL, and enable the “Use 
secure URLs for both Frontend and Admin” feature.
	
5.	
File Upload with Secure FTP
In addition to the HTTPS/SSL secure URLs, you can also take 
care of the FTP connection with your server. Use SFTP, since 
it provides an additional encryption of user credentials. This 
protocol uses a private key file for authentication. Make sure 
that file permissions are not set to 777. Otherwise, anyone will 
be able to rewrite them.
	
6.	
Predefined IP Addresses for Administrators
Magento provides an opportunity to set predefined IP 
addresses for accessing the admin panel, which is a robust 
security enhancement. You just have to create a list of IPs; 
thus, users with other addresses won’t be able to access the 
admin panel of your web site.
To implement this security feature, find your “.htaccess” file 
and enter the following code into it:
1   AuthName "Protected Area"
2   AuthType Basic
3   <Limit  GET POST>
4   order deny,allow
1https://firebearstudio.com/blog/xtento-two-factor-authentication-for-magento-
2-and-1.html

Chapter 14 ■ Security
159
5   deny from all
6   allow from 172.161.132.13
7   allow from 153.119
8   </Limit>
Hence, you will implement a permission to access your 
admin panel for the user with the ‘172.161.132.13’ IP address, 
and for everyone whose IP address starts with ‘153.119’. This 
technique supports an unlimited number of IP addresses.
Then, you should go to Magento root directory and create a 
new folder called ‘admin’. Copy the “index.php” file of your 
Magento and paste it there. Now, you have to change relative 
paths to the “config.php” and “Mage.php” files. Change the 
lines below:
1   $compilerConfig = '../includes/config.php';
2   $mageFilename = '../app/Mage.php';
You should only add ‘../’.
Now go to the “.htaccess” file and enter the following lines:
1   Redirect permanent /index.php/{admin_path} /admin/index.php/{admin_path}
2   Redirect 301 /index.php/{admin_path} /admin/index.php/{admin_path}
Therefore, you will direct users coming to our admin to a 
new directory. ‘{admin_path}’ indicates a new admin path 
manually changed before.
This security step works only with static IP addresses. If your 
ISP assigns dynamic IP addresses, you shouldn’t implement 
this technique.
	
7.	
Malicious PHP Functions
There are malicious PHP functions that should be disabled. 
You can use more secure alternatives instead of them. To 
disable these functions, find your “php.ini” file, open it, and 
add the following code:
1   disable_functions = "apache_child_terminate, apache_setenv,  
define_syslog_variables, escapeshellarg, escap\
2   eshellcmd, eval, exec, fp, fput, ftp_connect, ftp_exec, ftp_get,  
ftp_login, ftp_nb_fput, ftp_put, ftp_raw,\
3   ftp_rawlist, highlight_file, ini_alter, ini_get_all, ini_restore, 
inject_code, mysql_pconnect, openlog, p\
4   assthru, php_uname, phpAds_remoteInfo, phpAds_XmlRpc, phpAds_
xmlrpcDecode, phpAds_xmlrpcEncode, popen, pos\

Chapter 14 ■ Security
160
5   ix_getpwuid, posix_kill, posix_mkfifo, posix_setpgid, posix_setsid, 
posix_setuid, posix_setuid, posix_unam\
6   e, proc_close, proc_get_status, proc_nice, proc_open, proc_terminate, 
shell_exec, syslog, system, xmlrpc_e\
7   ntity_decode"
Take into account that you can disable other functions in your 
“php.ini” file, as well as omit important functions from the 
code above.
	
8.	
Directory Listing
Directory listing is among common server loopholes. It 
provides everyone with the ability to see the directory 
structure and location of all its files by simply entering a web 
site’s URL. Therefore, you should disable directory indexing 
by adding the code below to your “.htaccess” file:
1   Options -Indexes
	
9.	
MySQL Injections
Since every Magento web site has lots of form fields for user 
data input, hackers can easily steal this data by injecting 
MySQL statements. To protect your store from such a threat, 
you should use web firewalls (several apps are described 
below).
To solve this problem, update your Magento to the latest 
version, as it always provides lots of improvements, bug 
fixes, new features, and security enhancements. At the same 
time, there is a possibility of popping up new undiscovered 
problems related to the latest update.
	
10.	
Create backups of your Magento store regularly. It will help 
you decrease every hack damage level, and you will be able to 
restore your Magento web site faster.
	
11.	
Fix all e-mail loopholes. Keep in mind that your e-mail should 
not be widely known. It should be protected by a unique and 
secure password as well.
	
12.	
And don’t forget to check the security of your Magento web 
site regularly. This will help you find all issues at early stages.
	
13.	
Always update your antivirus software, since its older versions 
are not able to protect your store from the latest threats.

Chapter 14 ■ Security
161
	
14.	
Find out where your browser comes from, as it stores lots 
of necessary information about your Magento web site. Try 
not to save passwords in it because, with the access to your 
computer, hackers will easily get your credentials.
	
15.	
The “local.xml” file contains such sensitive data as database 
information and encryption key. Hide it from public access. 
You can do it by changing file permissions for “local.xml” to 
600(-rw) or blocking a web access to the entire app directory.
	
16.	
Upgrade your OS to the most recent version. It should provide 
new security improvements.
	
17.	
Your hosting provider should be reliable and secure. Note that 
some hosting providers are not prepared for hacker attacks.
	
18.	
Provide limited permissions for files and documents. For 
downloadable documents set only read permissions, thus no 
program will be able to modify them.
	
19.	
Disable Magento Connect Manager after having installed 
extensions in order to prevent any random changes.
	
20.	
Use only trusted Magento extensions from reliable sources, 
such as Magento Marketplace.
	
21.	
Change passwords for outside developers. You can set your 
ordinary passwords back after work is done.
	
22.	
Check web server logs for errors or suspicious activities. 
Thereby, you will be able to detect threats at early stages.
	
23.	
Block unwanted countries if you are not shipping worldwide.
	
24.	
Check this PDF2 for more tips. Although it was written for 
Magento 1, you will find a lot of information useful for 
Magento 2 there.

Chapter 15 ■ Certified Partners

Passing through a series of tests is not an easy task, but it’s the only way to become a

Solution Partners.
Inchoo
Inchoo is one of the top Magento 2 Trained Solution Partners. There are 20 Magento 
Certified Developers and 11 Magento Certified Solution Specialists among the company’s

CHAPTER 16
Final Thoughts
Since it is the early days of the platform, the book you’ve just read introduces only basic 
aspects of Magento 2. Therefore, we are going to release several more editions of Magento 
2 DIY to cover more features and details. The platform is rapidly growing, providing us 
with new opportunities every month. Thus, 2016 will be one of the most interesting years 
from the perspective of Magento merchants, developers, admins, and marketers. For 
further information about Magento 1 and Magento 2, visit Firebear Blog1.
