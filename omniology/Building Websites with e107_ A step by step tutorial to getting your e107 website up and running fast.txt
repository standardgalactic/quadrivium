About the Reviewer
Eric Vanderfeesten was born in the Netherlands and currently is one of the 
main developers for e107. He has been using e107 for about 4 years and started 
off as an interested user in content management systems. He soon discovered the 
overwhelming possibilities for code enhancements to the system and also found 
a need to create his own plugins for a number of websites. After releasing several 
plugins he was asked to join the beta test team, for which he contributed ideas to 
the main developers and delivered fixes and enhancements to the core system. Soon 
after that period he joined the main developers team of which he has been a member 
for about two and a half years now.
Although he has been coding for a long time, programming is not his educational 
skill. He is an architect and working in the architectural domain as his 
main profession. 
Since computer science has been a field of interest to him he has taken this interest 
into the domain of architectural design and graduated on a project involving 
generative architecture using a parametric script to produce architectural 
environments based on favela structures that can be found in Brazil.
Besides his work as a main developer for e107 he is also the chairperson of an 
architectural foundation 'Eindhovenseschool.net' and has several freelance activities 
besides his daytime job.

Preface
As of February 2007, there are 13,241 PHP scripts listed at hotscripts.com. Of these, 
641 are content management system (CMS) scripts, all with the ability to manage 
your online content and make your site dynamic. Out of these 641, e107 has been 
voted second in popularity in a recent survey. It's growing legion of fans like it for 
its ease of installation, powerful diverse features, well written code, and built-in 
security features.
E107 doesn't have a flashy name and you can't install it through a control panel 
such as Fantastico DeLuxe, which is probably why it is not the number one CMS. 
Nevertheless, downloading and installing e107 is a very easy straightforward 
process. One of the things that make e107 unique is its modularization. Many CMS 
take the one-size-fits-all approach and for smaller businesses in particular, they 
are a waste of resources. As opposed to this, e107 has a core program with many 
additional features available by activating a plugin (an additional set of scripts). This 
gives you the control to determine what features you need for your particular site.
While this book was written with entrepreneurs, small office/home office, and small 
businesses in mind, it will prove to be a great resource for anyone wishing to use 
e107. I would also like to stress that while targeted towards small business users, 
e107 is perfectly suited for personal sites as well as large corporations. This book is a 
primer to get you started and familiar with using e107. It is not a complete reference. 
However, it does contain references to resources for learning those features not 
covered in the text.
Don't panic if you have never created a database or installed a script, or have no 
knowledge about file permissions. In this book we will work together, step by step, to 
create a website for a small business. The book is a quick-paced tutorial and contains 
lots of screenshots so you need not try to second-guess what you should be seeing in 
your browser. This book will get your e107 up and running quickly and save your 
hundreds if not thousands of dollars in web-design and maintenance fees. 

Preface
[  ]
What This Book Covers
Chapter 1 introduces us to e107 and provides a brief history of content management 
systems, how content management systems work, a brief history of e107, and an 
introduction to the development team.
Chapter 2 covers the requirements for running e107, uploading to the server, setting 
file permissions, creating the database, running the installation script, securing your 
installation, updating e107, and what to do and where to go when things don't go 
as planned.
Chapter 3 takes us to our new website and covers the various components of the 
screen layout, creating and activating usernames, and registrations. After covering 
the front end of our new website, we will get to the heart of our website—the back 
end—where we will learn the various preference settings options, learn about 
emoticons, creating static and dynamic front pages, and different front-page views 
for different user groups.
Chapter 4 deals with the themes—the site theme, admin themes, how to select a 
different theme, core themes, additional themes, and custom themes. We will learn 
where to find additional themes and how to make them available for installation. 
We will cover customizing our theme through the selection of menu items, and learn 
how to use the WYSIWYG editor and file upload manager, create and delete custom 
menu items, and make the navigation of our site multi-lingual.
Chapter 5 takes us into the world of e-commerce with our website through the use of 
plugins. We will learn the difference between core and non-core plugins, where to 
obtain plugins, and how to install and uninstall plugins. We will learn how to create 
banner advertising campaigns and display banner ads on our site using the Banner 
plugin. We will create the Paws R Us store using the Shopping Cart plugin and 
finally we will learn about the FAQ plugin.
Chapter 6 transforms our e107 website into an e-business powerhouse. In this chapter 
we will learn how to create user groups and how to use them to control access 
to the various functions of our system. We will cover the installation, setup, and 
maintenance of forums and polls.
Chapter 7 will no doubt be the most referred to chapter in this book as we learn how 
to use the Content Management plugin, which is a very powerful and versatile 
content organizer. We will also learn how to set up the PDF plugin so our users can 
download documents in their original formatting. Last but not the least, we will 
cover how to use the Coppermine photo gallery plugin.

Preface
[  ]
Chapter 8 covers information dissemination. We will learn how to install, configure, 
and write a newsletter, communicate with our users with the calendar plugin, 
update users about our business by means of RSS, and learn some basic things we 
need to do to get our site listed in the search engines.
Chapter 9 shows us how to keep our database running in top condition, and use e107s 
self-diagnostic features to allow it to help us find problems so that we can make 
corrections. We will also learn security procedures.
Appendix A provides a list of e107 resources from around the world as well as 
resources for Apache, PHP, MySQL, XAMPP, Easy PHP, and WAMPServer

An Introduction to e107
When I coded my first website using Notepad in 1995, little did I know that my 
curiosity would tax the limits of my imagination and lock me into a loop of continual 
education. Each year brought improvements in the presentation of web pages, and 
eventually we were able to present tabular data from databases.
Of course, large businesses with IT staffs were able to provide the first interactive 
sites and eventually these programmers would offer those services to the small 
business sector, but at a price commensurate with their corporate hourly rates. If the 
programming was not enough to prohibit small business from taking advantage of 
interactive websites then the high costs of web-hosting services, especially ones with 
databases made it economically unfeasible.
As time progressed and e-commerce continued to grow in popularity the demand 
was on for a low-cost alternative for small businesses to take advantage of interactive 
websites. The dot-com bust brought a surplus of bandwidth and server space to the 
market effectively reducing hosting costs. Microsoft continued to gain in popularity 
with the FrontPage web-design program, making it easy for non-programmers to 
make attractive sites, and collect data via a form and easily send it to the Access 
database program. Well, maybe it was not so easy for the newbie but it was possible.  
Most entrepreneurs or small business owners did not have the financial resources 
to operate a CMS. In 1995, Rasmus Lerdorft created a set of scripts written in PERL 
called PHP/FI. This early work inspired Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski to create 
a scripting language and, working together with Rasmus Lerdorft, they officially 
launched PHP 3.0 as the successor to PHP/FI. If you would like to learn more you 
can read all about it at http://us2.php.net/history. 
Why is this important? Because it is easy to learn and implement, PHP has grown 
into the primary script for creating interactive websites and is the primary script for 
content management systems. Today CMS are growing in popularity—blogs, dating 
sites, bulletin boards, and yes even book publishers use content management systems.

An Introduction to e107
[  ]
There are hundreds if not thousands of open-source content management systems 
available; however, e107 has rapidly emerged in the forefront for its ease of use and 
its modular build. If you are not a computer geek a modular build allows you to 
activate only the elements necessary thus saving resources. 
History of Content Management Systems
Before we get to e107, we will look at a brief history of Content Management Systems 
and what purpose they serve. Content Management Systems have been around since 
before computers. If you are of my age, which is BC (before computers), then you 
may remember that libraries once used catalog-card systems to assist us with finding 
books. While not computerized, this was a content management system using the 
technology prevalent at that time. Now of course, most card-catalog systems are 
contained within databases in a computer. 
A content management system is defined as a collection of data within which a 
person with proper authorization can query, add, or delete records and have the 
results displayed in a unified manner. For those of you who have been on the 
Internet since it went public please be patient as I cover just a little web history for 
those who wanted to know but were afraid to ask their children.
No, I am not going to write about the complete history of the Internet as there are 
several good web pages out there if you are interested. I will begin with a discussion 
of the first private computer users on the Internet. 
In the beginning, web pages were boring and static. They consisted of headers, text, 
bold, italic, and underline. The early web users were mostly scientists who used web 
to communicate and share information quickly. There was nothing like "webmasters" 
as are prevalent today. The web was still under the military’s control. It wasn't until 
the Internet was commercialized that the focus started to shift from "content" to 
"content with style". Webmasters seldom used pictures, as connection speeds were 
very slow. As the Internet grew so did HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language, the 
language for creating web pages). With the internet service providers providing 
more stable and faster connections, HTML continued to expand to allow web 
designers more control over the layout of their pages.  

Chapter 1
[  ]
Meanwhile, the desktop computer revolution was progressing at breakneck speed. 
Small offices began sharing documents through local area networks. With the growth 
in networks a new concept "intranet" came into existence. An intranet is an internal 
or private network that is accessible within the confines of a company, university, 
or organization. I mention this because intranets are the birthplace of content 
management systems. Within an organization, management and employees began 
sharing documents, budgets, emails, etc. As these intranets grew so did the need for 
continuity of data entry and display. 
If you have ever created a mail-merge document then you have created a template. 
I use this analogy as most of us at one time or another have wanted or needed to 
communicate the same information to a number of different people, yet wanted to 
make it appear as if we are writing to each individual. The mail merge was the first 
application of this sort that was used widely and consists of data file and a merge 
document. The data file is a database with names and addresses and other relevant 
information stored and the merge document is a document that contains the text 
with special merge keys inserted where you can put the "name" and "address". Then 
you can follow the directions for creating the merged documents and print your 
documents. The result is identical letters to different recipients but with different name 
and address.   
As our society and the world became addicted to computers, so did the desire grow 
to provide more sophisticated sharing. While intranets were great, corporations were 
looking for a way for their sales representatives and/or customers to be able to gain 
access to ordering information to purchase and sell items and ensure that accurate 
delivery was predicted by checking inventory levels. And of course, sales needed to 
be credited to the proper person, state, and region and purchase orders needed to be 
charged against specific accounts. The early CMS was very expensive and required 
skilled computer programmers.

make up a content management system today.
A basic content management system works like this: 
1.	 You select a template from the templates that are available by default with 
your content management system. If you prefer, you can spend a little money 
and hire a professional web designer/developer to create a custom template, 
typically with a logo at the top, and standard navigation options across the 
top, down the left-hand side, and/or at the foot of the page incorporating all 
the insert tags required to display information from the database. 

Chapter 1
[ 11 ]
2.	 When the information is submitted, it usually goes through a process of review 
by a designated administrator who may accept it, send it back for revision, or 
reject it. The information is available for viewing from the database only if the 
administrator or designated manager approves the information.
3.	 A text database stores the information. When a user requests information, 
the data script makes a request to the database for the information. The 
information in combination with the template forms the display page you 
see in your browser. Think mail merge in your favorite word processing 
program. The scripting language in use determines the URL page extension; 
in PHP, the extension is .php. It can also be .cfm for Adobe ColdFusion, 
.asp for Microsoft Active Server Pages, or htm/html for UNIX Linux. 
4.	 The content management system generates indexes allowing it to keep track 
of added, updated, accessed, and deleted information. It also keeps track of 
who performed and approved these actions.
5.	 Most content management systems offer document archives, built-in search 
engines, permission controls, e-commerce, and workflow control.
Brief History of e107
Four-score and seven years ago…Whoops! Sorry about that, wrong history 
lesson. As the creator of e107 was not into the development of the program and 
documenting its history simultaneously it is impossible to provide you with an exact 
history of e107. However, the following is a general overview of the development.
In 1998, Steve Dunstan created a Windows shell replacement called LiteStep. After 
moving to a PHP enabled server, Dunstan took his first steps into scripting. After 
eighteen months of coding and maintaining his LiteStep.org site, he was offered 
a chance to take over the main LiteStep theme site LiteStep.net, which continued 
to grow in popularity with the help of a couple of other individuals. The LiteStep 
sites were created as whole entities so when a member requested coding help it was 
next to impossible to provide the necessary assistance. Due to this, work began on 
creating a more modular and distributable form of code.  
The code was completed around May 2002 and since this was Dunstan's seventh 
major project he chose "e107" as the name. The code evolved quickly and when Steve 
opened up http://www.e107.org in July 2002, e107 was at version 2.1. After version 
5.4 released, Dunstan decided on a numbering revision to go with a major code 
revision. The new numbering system set e107 to version 0.6. After releasing version 
0.612, Dunstan decided to ask a few talented and dedicated contributors to form a 
development team. After a couple of versions, he decided to take a step back from 
the development side to take some personal time.

An Introduction to e107
[ 12 ]
On January 16, 2006, the development team had completed an almost complete 
rewrite of e107 to make it more flexible, secure, and intuitive. The team designed 
the system around a core program to which the user could add additional abilities 
through the installation of plugins. This design had several advantages, primarily 
speed and conservation of resources. However, as the code was almost completely 
rewritten, many of the previously developed plugins no longer worked in version 
0.7.0. Additionally e107 had a reputation of being something of a hobby-oriented 
content management system. This impression was changed with version 0.7.5.
With version 0.7.5, developers started releasing business and e-commerce plugins, 
which have turned e107 into a serious business-class content management system 
while not sacrificing ease to learn or use. With the addition of advanced techniques 
such as the Content Management Plugin and Shortcodes, e107 has the power and 
capability to service mid-level to large businesses and organizations. 
The People Who Make e107 Possible
From its humble beginnings e107 has grown and so have the people who support 
the project so that the rest of us may benefit from their hard work and ingenuity. In 
order to respond to the increase in development and support, e107 is supported by 
three groups: the development team, the translators, and the support team. It would 
require a chapter to introduce everyone involved in the e107 project so I will just 
introduce the current primary development team. In alphabetical order they are: 
Cameron Hanly aka CaMerOn
Steve Dunstan aka jalist
Eric Vanderfeesten aka Lisa
Thom Michelbrink aka McFly
Martin Nicholls aka Streaky
James Currie aka SweetAs
I don't wish to diminish the contributions of the translators or the support 
team as each and everyone is important. For an up-to-date list please go to 
http://e107.org/e107_plugins/dev/dev.php?show.278.
Summary
We have learned about the origins of e107 and covered a very basic history and 
the inner working of a content management system in this chapter. You were also 
introduced to the current members of the development team. For those who love 
computer trivia you can find additional information resources in Appendix A.

Installing e107
Now that you have had your history lesson and can define a CMS, we can get down 
to the business of learning how to install and configure e107. I believe the best way 
to learn is through practical application so my veterinarian friend has graciously 
consented to allowing us to create an e107 site called Cuddle Care Animal Hospital: 
http://www.cuddlecare.biz  
Requirements
To function, e107 requires that your web server or your hosting company's server 
meets the following basic requirements:
At least one domain name
At least one email account
PHP 4.3.0 (or newer) http://www.php.org
MySQL 3.22 (or newer) http://mysql.net 
A minimum of 25MB of storage space 
A full installation of e107 requires 8.53 MB but remember 
that you will need more space initially for both the 
compressed files and the expanded files during installation. 
Also, keep in mind your database will grow, and you will 
need space for email accounts, statistic programs, and other 
programs and/or databases you will be running. 
The easiest way to ensure that you find a host that meets the requirements is to 
search for "e107 hosting" at search engines like http://www.google.com. The reason 
•
•
•
•
•

Installing e107
[ 14 ]
for this is that some web-hosting companies install PHP differently, which can stop 
e107 from working properly. The hosting companies are always upgrading software, 
so if any known issues list were provided here it might be obsolete by the time the 
book is printed, so if you are not going to use the method suggested above then 
visit http://wiki.e107.org/?title=HOWTO:Install_troubleshoot#Host_and_
platform-specific_problems before you go any further. 
You may also find some web-hosting companies that have 
their servers set up for optimum performance for e107 by 
checking the http://www.e107.org website. I would 
caution you to be careful about signing up for the cheapest 
web-hosting plans no matter how big the company. Many 
of these companies overload their servers so response time 
can be slow. Also, technical support may not be efficient 
enough. It is also advisable to register your domain name 
separately from the hosting package so that you control 
the account. This way, if you wish to change hosts you 
will not have to wait or in some cases, have your domain 
held hostage.
Operating System Requirements 
The requirements for running e107 on both the operating systems—Windows and 
Unix/Linux—are the same. You must have Apache, PHP, and MySQL installed and 
running successfully. If you plan to use e107 on a web server that you do not own, 
you seriously will need to consider making a change to a web‑hosting service that 
uses Unix/Linux. However, if you wish to test e107 on your Windows computer at 
home, you will need to install Apache, MySQL, and PHP. You can install all three at 
once using:
XAMPP http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
EASYPHP http://www.easyphp.org 
•
•

Chapter 2
[ 15 ]
This list is by no means exhaustive or an endorsement over any others. You can also 
download Apache, PHP, and MySQL from their individual sites (see Appendix A), 
and install and troubleshoot each program.
If you have a dedicated web server and you are planning to run e107 site on this 
server, then it is better to install Apache, MySQL, and PHP independently. If you 
are operating your own server then you should be able to install, configure, and 
debug all three.
When possible, I prefer to develop e107 sites on the platform on which they will 
be running. This is easy with e107 as you can install it in the root directory or 
create a subdirectory in an existing website and install it. In this case, I am actually 
developing and hosting the website http://www.cuddlecare.biz, which we will be 
building together over the next few chapters.
Installing e107
Even if you are new to Linux, installing e107 is very easy. Before we begin let me 
caution those of you who have web-hosting accounts that feature cPanel. cPanel is 
a control panel very widely used in Linux hosting. Most cPanel accounts also offer 
Fantastico DeLuxe (a plug-in with a script library that automates script installation). 
If your web-hosting company activates e107 as an option then you can install e107 
and the database with a mouse click. I strongly recommend against this type of 
installation as it often installs older versions of e107 and once it has finished you will 
still have to go to the e107 site, download, and install the updated files, so you really 
gain nothing.

Installing e107
[ 16 ]
Uploading e107 to Your Server
Now that you have a web space capable for handling e107 it is time to begin the 
installation process. First, you need to go to http://e107.org/ and download the 
latest version; at present it is version .0.7.7. Once you click on the Download link 
from the menu bar you will be presented with a page of download links (see the 
screenshot overleaf):
No Command-Line Access
For security reasons, many web-hosting companies do not give you command-line 
access unless you have a dedicated server or dedicated virtual private server account. 
If you do not have the command-line access, follow these steps:

Chapter 2
[ 17 ]
1.	 Download the e107 0.7.7 Full install (.zip) file to your computer.
2.	 Open your FTP client to your server. (If your web-hosting company supports 
secure FTP then use it instead of regular FTP). If you do not have an FTP 
client you can download a free open-source FTP client called Filezilla at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla. If you are not comfortable 
with the interface you can do a search on FTP clients. 
3.	 Select the folder, which is usually public_html for your HTML files. If you 
wish to upload to a subdirectory, you may create it and then select it. If 
you are worried about someone viewing your site before you are finished 
you will be able to deactivate the site from any visitors once the program is 
installed. Once you select the folder upload the ZIP file to the server.
4.	 Most hosting companies have a ZIP program or module. This is usually 
located within a file-management module within the operating panel. You 
need only to select the ZIP file then tell the panel to unzip it. Since there are 
several different panels available I can not provide more specific information; 
however, most reputable hosts have a knowledge base, flash tutorials, or as 
a last resort the customer support. Depending upon the speed of the server 
unzipping can take a few moments.
Command-Line (Shell) Access
If your web-hosting company provides command-line access, also known as SSH, 
shell, or jailed shell, then you can use a much faster method:
1.	 Download the e107 0.7.7 Full install (.tar.gz) file to your computer.
2.	 Open your FTP client to your server.
3.	 Select the folder for your HTML files or subdirectory where you wish to 
install e107.
4.	 Now log on to the server with your SSH client and navigate to the folder in 
which you placed the .tar.gz file.
5.	 Enter the following command to unpack the archive:
         tar xvzf file.tar.gz
Setting File Permissions
When expanded, e107 will add 8 folders and 40 files to your directory (see the 
screenshot overleaf). Keep in mind that this may change with updates.
www.allitebooks.com

Installing e107
[ 18 ]
Please note that during installation if you do not have 
enough storage capacity then the system will only unzip the 
number of files it has room for and not more than that; and 
it does not warn you that it has encountered this problem.

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
Now we are going to set some directory permissions to enable us to configure and 
customize e107. You may not want to use all the features (plugins) of e107 so the 
following is broken down into core permissions and plug-in permissions. If you have 
never changed permissions before, start with using the Help menu on your FTP 
program and it should provide guidance. Whether you are using FileZilla or some 
other FTP program the screens will look similar to the screenshot below. Right-click 
the folder or file for which you wish to change the permission and look for either 
CHMOD (a UNIX Command) or File Attributes from the context menu.
Core Permissions
We are now going to change the file permissions to enable us to modify, configure, 
and upload files to our installation. To do this we need to change permissions to 
Read, Write, Execute or with some FTP clients that use the UNIX interface to the 
numeric value 777 also known as chmod 777. FileZilla gives you the option of either 
checking off the checkboxes or changing the numeric value.  

Installing e107
[ 20 ]
Change the permissions of the following file:
e107_config.php
Change the permissions of the following folders:
Do not open the folders and change the files. Change the 
folders only
e107_themes/
e107_plugins/
e107_files/public
e107_files/public/avatars
e107_files/cache
e107_files/download
e107_files/downloadimages/
e107_files/downloadthumbs/
e107_images/newspost_images/
Plug-in Permissions
Since e107 can be used for many different purposes its functionality is expanded 
by modular programming code called Plugins. The plugins below are the most 
common and are included in the zip/tar.gz file. To use the plugins you will 
need to chmod to 777 some additional directories.
Content Management Plugin
e107_plugins/content/images/cat/
e107_plugins/content/images/cat/16/
e107_plugins/content/images/cat/48/
e107_plugins/content/images/file/
e107_plugins/content/images/file/tmp/
e107_plugins/content/images/icon/
e107_plugins/content/images/icon/tmp/
e107_plugins/content/images/image/
e107_plugins/content/images/image/tmp
e107_plugins/content/images/menus/

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
The Content Management System Plugin is hands down the best plugin for e107. 
It allows the management of content with great flexibility and if you are creating 
a website that will have large amounts of information then you will come to rely 
on this plugin. A book could be written on this one plugin alone; however, this is 
beyond the scope of this book and for our small veterinary website we will not be 
using the CMS plugin.
Links Page
The Links Page Plugin is used to create a links page with categories and 
sub-categories.  
e107_plugins/links_page/cat_images/
e107_plugins/links_page/link_images/
Statistic Logging  
Most hosts offer web statistics with their hosting accounts; however, e107 does have 
a plug-in for collecting statistics.
e107_plugins/log/logs
If you would like to gather information about the visitors coming to your site, such 
as browser type, country, pages accessed, etc., then you can set the file permission to 
enable you to use the Statistic Logging plugin. 
Running the Installation Script
Now that we have finished changing the core permissions close your FTP client, 
open up your web browser, and navigate to the URL where your files are located. 
In my case, that is http://www.cuddlecare.biz but if you have another domain 
name, just substitute your URL or browse http://www.yourdomain.com.
If you are using Windows with the Apache server then locate your installation where 
you specified your folder structure when you installed Apache. Usually this will 
begin with http://localhost/html/cuddlecare. 

Installing e107
[ 22 ]
Now follow along with me as we finish our installation:
Stage 1
If, all the files were successfully uploaded you will see the first page of the 
install script. It will give you an option for the language you wish to use during 
the configuration.
Select Set Language to proceed to the next stage.
Stage 2
Now, it is time to create our database. This will happen in one of the following two 
ways depending upon your access.
Root Access
If you have root access you can create the database using the e107 installation script 
using your root username and password. Make sure to select the Create checkbox. If 
you do not have root access follow the alternative method explained next.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
Select Continue to proceed to the next stage.

Installing e107
[ 24 ]
No Root Access
Unless you have a dedicated server, most likely you will not have root access. Before 
you can proceed, you will need to log on to your server following the instructions 
that you received from your web-hosting company. Almost all Linux web hosts offer 
a user panel these days that allows you to create email accounts, manage extensions, 
and to create databases. 
I recommend you to name this test website as e107 to avoid any confusion. You will 
also need to assign a user to the database. You can consult your web-host support 
section if you need help, as this varies from system to system. If you use a browser-
based interface, make sure to open a new window or tab so you do not have to start 
the installation process again.
Once you have created the database and assigned a user, return to the installation 
script, and enter data in all the fields except selecting the checkbox Create database 
as shown in the screenshot on the next page. Please note that when you create a 
database on a shared server most of the time you prefix the database name and 
then an underscore ("username_") in this case, it is cuddle_e107. If I entered only 
e107 I would receive an error message stating that e107 was unable to connect to 
the database. Again, if you are unsure, then check your web host's knowledge base 
tutorials, or submit a question through support.

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
Select Continue to go to the next stage.

[ 26 ]
Stage 3
If all the information is entered correctly in Stage 2 then the next screen will confirm 
the e107 connection to the MySQL database (see the screenshot below).
Select Continue to proceed to the next stage.
If you get an error message use the Back button of the browser, correct the necessary 
information, select Continue, and proceed as above.
Stage 4
Way to go! You are half way through the installation process. Stage 4 confirms that 
the installation folders and files have the necessary permissions along with the 
required versions of PHP and MySQL installed before proceeding. If all is well, you 
will see the next screen like that shown in the screenshot on the next page. Select 
Continue Installation to proceed.

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
Stage 5
You are almost there; keep up the good work! In this stage, you will enter details 
such as the admin username, password, and the email account you wish for e107 to 
use for the administration email (see the screenshot on the next page). 
For security reasons, you should use a username and password other than the one 
you use for your web-hosting account access. If you want a quick way to generate 
passwords that are difficult to break, you can search for online password generation 
websites like http://www.techzoom.net/security-password.asp and follow 
the instructions. 

Installing e107
[ 28 ]
Select Continue to proceed to the next stage.
Stage 6
At this stage there is just a confirmation screen confirming that the e107 install 
program has all the information necessary to create the database and tables that are 
required for the program's operations. (See the screenshot on the next page.)

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
Select Continue to proceed to the next stage.
Stage 7
Congratulations! This is the last stage. If you see the screen as shown in the 
screenshot below then you have done a successful installation. If you are 
seeing anything else, then skip down to the heading Troubleshooting Common 
Installation Problems.

Installing e107
[ 30 ]
Select Continue to exit the installation. This takes us to the first page of our new 
cuddlecare.biz website (see the screenshot below).

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
Securing Your Installation
If you see the welcome screen as shown opposite then it is time to secure your 
installation. Connect to your site using your FTP client as we did earlier (see the 
screenshot under the section Setting File Permissions) and change the file permissions 
for file /e107_config.php to 644.
A permissions set of "644" represents read/write access for 
the owner and read-only access for group and other uses
We have now completed a full installation of e107. However, before we move on to 
the next chapter let's look at updating an installation and some troubleshooting tips 
for when the install does not quite go as smoothly as above.
Upgrading an Existing e107 Installation
The e107 development team is dedicated to improving e107. In fact, the 0.7 version 
was almost a complete rewriting of code from 0.6. You should always keep your e107 
up to date. Most version upgrades fix security problems or minor bugs in the code. 
Additionally e107 issues upgrades when updates to MySQL and PHP may affect 
functionality. Before you roll your eyes back into your head, updating is very easy. 
Before any changes are made to your current installation 
you need to make a backup of your e107 database. Failure 
to do this simple operation can cost you hours or days 
of work.
Here is what you need to do:
1.	 You should make a backup of your e107 database before making any 
changes. With a hosting control panel this is usually done by locating the 
MySQL or some panels have a backup feature that allows you to make a full 
backup of your website or databases. If you have this feature, select backup 
of the database. 
2.	 Locate the latest update from http://e107.org/edownload.php. This is 
usually the first file located under the section displaying full installation links 
and will be similar to e107 0.7.x to 0.7.7 Upgrade (.zip).

Installing e107
[ 32 ]
3.	 Click on the link and download into a folder on your computer.
4.	 Unzip the folder.
5.	 Usually updating consists of uploading the files to the server overwriting the 
existing files. But before you do this, make sure to check for any readme 
files. If present, these will contain any special instructions; otherwise you 
can continue.
6.	 Open your FTP client so that you have the upgrade source files as shown in 
the screenshot below.
7.	 Transfer all the folders and files to your web server overwriting existing files.
8.	 Once all the files have been uploaded log out of the FTP client.
You can see that upgrade process was easy and it only took a couple of minutes. I 
recommend that you check for updates preferably once a week or at least once 
a month.

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
Database Updates
There can be database updates within an upgrade release. In this case, when you 
log in to the admin area of your site, you will see a button in the center of the screen 
(above the welcome 'name' part with all the image buttons) stating that an update 
is needed on the database. Before updating your database, ensure that you make a 
backup first before you click on the button.  
Troubleshooting Common Installation 
Problems
I was going to call this section "when things go wrong" and have a little guy pulling 
his hair out but didn't want to confuse you into thinking I was advertising an old 
B horror film. Like everything in life, things do not always go according to plan, 
especially when it comes to loading programs or updating them. I am sure that you 
have experienced a problem or two in your computing lifetime.
If you are the victim of a stuck installation or the files are installed but you have 
a blank screen where the welcome screen should be, do not bang the keyboard or 
throw your computer on the floor. It is all right to swear if you want. However, once 
your face turns from red back to normal go to http://www.e107.org site and 
select forums. By using the search forum feature you can search for your specific 
problem. Chances are that with so many users, the problem and its respective 
solution will be available.
When searching the forums it is best to start with the oldest 
response and work forward providing that you are viewing 
information for the version that you have installed. As you 
look at the forums you will notice that many people ask the 
same questions but usually you will only find a response 
to the first query. Please remember that the development 
team and support team members donate their time and we 
should all endeavor not to waste it on unnecessary queries.

Summary
In this chapter we have learned where to obtain the latest version of e107 and 
gone through the installation process step by step. We learned the importance of 
backing up your database and finally we covered how to keep e107 in up-to-date 
form and provided you with a troubleshooting resource. Now go grab your 
favorite caffeinated beverage, stretch your legs, and we will proceed with 
creating our website.

Setting Site Preferences
Now that we have installed e107 and had a chance to view the front page, you are 
probably thinking to yourself, there is not much available. Trust me, there are plenty 
of options available, which we will explore together as we make our website. Before 
we start, keep in mind that with a CMS, you have a front end and a back end. If 
you are familiar with word processing programs then it is just like a mail-merge 
document. The theme (front end) is analogous to the document body in a theme. It 
then fills in the various fields with the information contained in the database (back 
end), which in turn then displays what look like individually prepared letters. If you 
are new to making websites or have never done mail merge, think of a theme as that 
one meal that you make that comes out perfect every time but then tell each of the 
people that have eaten it that it was prepared especially for them. The principle is the 
same, just a different technology.
The e107 Front End
The front end, also known as the theme, is the web page that our site visitors will see. 
Looking at the screenshot on the next page, you can see how the theme's front page 
is divided into several smaller areas that are as follows:
Header
Search Box
Front Page
Area 1
Area 2
Area 3
Area 4

Setting Site Preferences
[ 36 ]
Of course, you are not restricted to this particular layout when you develop your 
own site. Themes are flexible and provide you with a quick method to change the 
look of your entire site with just a couple of clicks of your mouse. You can make a 
selection from one of the many free themes that are included with e107, develop your 
own theme, or hire a designer to make a customized theme. While customizing a 
theme is beyond the scope of this book, we will look at customizing the layout of an 
existing theme in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
Creating a Username and Password
Many web administrators like to control the display of information on their website 
to its visitors. E107 assumes during the install that you will want to register users. 
You can allow all visitors to view your front page and then you can prompt for 
username and password to access the rest of your site. You can also create different 
levels of user groups and restrict access based on groups, which we will cover later.
For the purpose of Cuddle Care, we would like our visitors to register before using 
any of the features such as using the forums or uploading pet photos, and also so 
that we can notify the users of important information that may affect their pet's 
health, send holiday or birthday greetings, etc. Take a moment now, and go to the 
login block at the upper left corner under the header. Just under where it says, 
Remember Me you will see the Sign Up link as shown in the screenshot below. If 
you have been on the Web and have signed up on CMS websites you may think I am 
insulting your intelligence by explaining and showing screenshots on this but you 
are going to encounter some visitors who want to become members that have never 
registered on a CMS site. Nine out of ten times the reason that they cannot register, 
is that they entered the username and password and then clicked the Login button.
Click on the Signup link. The first thing you will see is the COPPA (Child Online 
Protection and Privacy Act) statement. 
This site complies with The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 
(COPPA) and as such cannot accept registrations from users under the age of 13 
without a written permission document from their parent or guardian. For more 
information you can read the legislation here. Please contact the main site admin 
here if you require assistance.

see online. We will enter Registered User here.
Login Name: This will allow you to enter the login name that you wish 
to use.
Real Name: This field will allow you to enter your legal name. This 
information is not shown on the website. Most administrators use this as part 
of an identification process when there are problems with logins.
Password: This field will allow you to enter the password you wish to use. 
(The best way is to use a combination of upper and lowercase letters mixed 
with numbers.)
Re-Type Password: This is done to confirm whether you have entered the 
same password as that in the previous field. If the two passwords do not 
match you will get an error message.
Email Address: This field will allow you to enter the email address that you 
wish to use. (E107 will then send you an email with a link to validate your 
registration.)
Re-type Email Address: This is done to confirm whether you have entered 
the same email address as that in the previous field. If the two email 
addresses do not match you will get an error message.
Hide email: This field will allow you to select Yes or No depending upon 
your preference.
Signature: You can leave this field blank. For the purpose of showing 
what it is used for I have provided a sample signature of my company. 
(See screenshot on the next page.) 
Avatar: This is optional. An avatar is an 80 x 80 pixels or small graphic used 
to represent an individual. Avatars can be as simple as a photo that has been 
shrunk to these proportions or drawings or logo avatars created by 
artistic individuals. 
Timezone: This field will allow you to enter the appropriate time zone for 
your location from the drop-down list. If you are unsure what your time 
zone is, then you can go to http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/gmt-

Activating Your Registration
The next step is for you to go check your email. You should receive an email with 
a subject line that says Registration details for e107 Powered Website, as shown 
in the screenshot below. This email also contains a registration completion link. To 
complete the registration process you must click on the link or cut and paste the link 
into your browser. If you have completed this step you will be transported to your 
e107 site and see the following message:
Thank You!
This stage of registration is complete. You will receive a confirmation email 
containing your login details. Please follow the link in the email to complete the 
signup process and activate your account.
If you do not click on the registration completion link, you will not be a registered 
user. Your information will stay in the system as incomplete until you complete the 
last step or an administrator manually approves the registration.

The User or Member Welcome Page
Now go over to the login section in the upper-left corner and enter the username 
and password of the registered user that you just now registered, and press the 
Login button. You will now see the member's front page as shown in the 
screenshot below:

Setting Site Preferences
[ 42 ]
It looks just like the visitor front page except you will notice that a small menu has 
replaced the area where the login was located. Just beneath that menu, you will see a 
light blue area that shows that your status is online and what section of the site you 
are viewing. Beneath this information are some general statistics about the number 
of people who have been online at a particular time, how many were members, how 
many were guests, and the date and time details. Just below that are the total number 
of members and the name of the newest member to join your site.
The e107 Back End
The back end is the backbone of your system. All aspects of e107 are configured 
through the back end. Like the front end, we control the back end by means of a 
theme. Initially the administrative theme is different from the front-end theme. So we 
will all be on the same page, leave the administrative theme set to the default, which 
is Jayya v1.0. The administrative theme can be accessed using either a direct or an 
indirect method.
The direct method, which I recommend, is to use the administrative login 
located at http://yourdomain.com/e107_admin/admin.php as 
shown below:
•

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
The indirect method by logging in using your administrative username and 
password on the front page and then selecting the Admin Area in the menu 
on the left side of your screen as shown in the screenshot below:

[ 44 ]
Please note that if you did not delete the install.php file 
as instructed in Chapter 2 you will see a security warning 
on the front page as shown in the screenshot in the previous 
page. If you see this message, open your FTP client, log in, 
and delete the install.php file which is located in your 
e107 installation root directory.
Setting Site Preferences
The first thing we need to do after logging in as administrator is to set our site 
preferences. There are two ways to access administrative functions. One is the 
administrative tool bar in the upper-left corner and the other is by selecting the 
icons on the administrative interface shown below. To set the site preferences 
from the toolbar select Settings | Preferences. To set the site preferences from the 
administrative interface just select the Preferences icon as shown below:

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
The Site Preferences interface, as shown in the screenshot below, is one of the most 
important screens in the administrative interface. 
When you enter Site Preferences, you will automatically see the default Site 
Information menu. It is one of several options available in the Options menu at the 
right-hand side that include: 
Site Information: Here you can configure the site name, site URL, redirect 
all requests to the site URL, specify a site link button, and enter a site tagline. 
You can also provide a site description, specify the main site admin name 
display, specify the admin email address, site contact information (such as 
company name, address, phone, and email address), allow users to email a 
copy of contact email to themselves, and specify a site disclaimer.
Display Information: This option controls the display of theme information, 
page render times, and database queries.
Admin Display Options: This option allows the administrator to let the 
system display plugin information, and to choose if plugins will display their 
own info in an individual menu or as one menu. Only the administrator(s) 
will see this information.

Security & Protection
In a perfect world everyone would use the Internet for genuine purposes like sharing 
information, learning, and entertainment. However, in the real world there are lots 
of people out there using the Internet to spy, spam, and do all kinds of harm. With 
this in mind the developers are constantly making improvements to thwart these 
denizens of the Web. We can use the security and protection options for using secure 
certificates and SSL to operate a pay site or safeguard sensitive information, enable 
the use of image code verification to thwart the use of robots and spiders to create 
auto accounts and flood our system, set cookies, filter profanities, and remind us to 
change our password.

Setting Site Preferences
[ 54 ]
For most users the default settings will be correct. Since 
this is an actual website as well as a site for this book I have 
included the settings that Cuddle Care will be using. Also 
for the sake of decency and to protect minors who may be 
using this book, I have not included the censored words; 
however, one should try to think of as many as possible to 
include in the actual list as if it is not in the list and someone 
uses it, it will not be censored.
Let's make the following settings for our site:
Enable SSL: This setting allows you to secure your site with SSL (Secure 
Socket Layers). If you have done online banking or ordered online then you 
must have used SSL. You need an SSL certificate (ask your web-hosting 
service about this) before this can be used. If you use this function the entire 
site must operate in SSL mode. Only enable SSL if you are sure you know 
what you are doing. We will turn it off.
Enable Image-code verification during signup: This setting when enabled 
creates a small graphic with letters and numbers that must be entered to 
complete the sign-up process. This is done to thwart automated registrations. 
We will select the On option.
Enable Image-code verification during login: If this setting is turned on the 
user will have to enter an image code every time they log in. We will select 
the Off option.  
Enable Image-code verification during forgotten password: When this 
setting is turned on, a user who has received an email with their password 
will have to enter an image code before being allowed to proceed. We will 
select the On option. 
Secure signup verification—hide password in email?: When this setting is 
turned on e107 will not send the password in the email confirmation letter. 
If you set this to off, you should recommend that the user change their 
password upon logging in, as emails can be intercepted. We will select the 
On option. 
Disallow multiple logins: This will prevent more than one person logging in 
with the same username/password (login detail sharing). We will select the 
On option.

User Tracking method: This is the method that e107 will use to track visitors 
to your site. You have a choice between Sessions (for more information on 
sessions go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session) and Cookies (for 
more information on cookies go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_
Cookie). Select the Cookies options. 
Cookie name (if cookies selected): This is the name of the 
cookie that e107 inserts into the users browser. We will enter 
e107cookie.
Filter profanities? This setting when enabled will replace swearwords or 
obscenities with the string entered in the next field. We will select the 
On option. 
Replace string: You can enter the word or words that will replace the 
profanities entered by a user. We will enter the word Censored.
Filter words: This will allow you to specify the words to be censored. You 
can enter your words separated by commas.
Enable flood protection?: This setting enables a script that prevents users 
from overloading or flooding your server with multiple requests. We will 
select the On option.  
Flood timeout: This works in conjunction with the above setting. You can 
specify the time required in seconds between two posts for areas where users 
can post. If a user posts too fast, he or she will be redirected to the homepage. 
We will enter the value 10.
Auto Ban: If someone is attacking your site by multiple requests to your 
server, the IP of that intruder will be automatically banned. You have a 
choice between Off, Flood & Failed Login, Flood Only, and Failed Login 
Only. We are setting this to Off; since we are still developing our site we will 
be logging on and off many times and opening multiple screens.  
Use reverse DNS to allow host banning: This will allow you to ban users by 
hostname, rather than just IP or email address. We will set this to Off.
Display warning when main administrator password hasn't changed for at 
least 30 days: This will send a reminder to the administrator to change their 
password every 30 days. We will select the On option.

We are now done with the Preferences section. So when do we get to change the 
front page? Be patient just a little time longer. Unlike making sites with an HTML 
editor, you have to set all these parameters first, then, you get to make the 
artistic changes.
Emoticons
Look! Up on the screen! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's a smiley face??? No it's an 
emoticon. While they can't fly, they are able to span multiple languages with a single 
smile. They are a valuable tool for allowing your users to display the emotions they 
wish to attach to the posts. The screenshot below shows you the default emoticons 
that were uploaded to the server when we installed e107. To use them all we have to 
do is activate them by selecting.
To activate the emoticons, do the following:
1.	 Select the Settings | Emoticons options from the toolbar or select the 
Emoticons icon in the administrative interface.
2.	 Select the Activate emoticons checkbox.
3.	 Select the Update button to save.

Creating the Front Page
The moment you have been waiting for has finally arrived! We will be now creating 
the first page for our website. But before we make the first page we need to cover 
a couple of things. First you can control whether the front page data should be 
dynamic (changes constantly) or static (stays the same). The second thing is you can 
create different front pages for visitors, members, administrators, or any other user 
class you create. The fantastic thing is that you only need to enter the information for 
each, as the theme will take care of the layout for you. We will be covering adding 
content in detail in Chapter 7 so for now we will just whet our appetites by creating 
our front page.
Creating a Dynamic Front Page
When you click on Home in the administrative interface you are taken to the front 
page of the site. The text that you see on this page has been entered as a news item. We 
will learn more about configuring the news post in Chapter 7. For now we are going to 
create a sample news item. Please follow along with me and do the following:
From the administrative interface select the News icon or select Content | 
News from the toolbar.
From the News Options menu to the right select Create News Item.
In the Title field enter Welcome to Cuddle Care Animal Hospital.
In the Summary field enter Welcome message.
In the Body field enter At Cuddle Care Animal Hospital, we strive to meet 
or exceed client expectations for animal health care, offering high quality 
medical choices for clients. We provide excellent patient care, promote and 
foster the human-animal bond, and provide public education on health 
issues. At Cuddle Care, we truly provide the Cuddle Care Touch.
Scroll down to the bottom of the form and select the Post news to 
database button.
Select Home from the main menu bar and you will see your welcome 
message as shown in the screenshot on the next page.

2.	 Locate the Welcome to Cuddle Care Animal Hospital title and under

Creating a Static Front Page
For some sites, a dynamic page like the one we just did is preferable, but for our

it together:
Login to the administrative interface.
Select the Welcome Message icon or select Content | Welcome Message 
from the toolbar.
Select Create New Message from the Options menu at the right-hand side.

Using the Welcome Message feature the message will stay at the top of all other text. 
For instance, if you were to add a news item about pet adoptions, it would appear 
on the front page where the No news items at the moment – please check back 
soon appears. We do not wish to have any information appear under our welcome 
message so we need to make changes using the Front Page configuration. To do this, 
return to the administrative interface and perform the following steps:
Select the Front Page icon or select Settings | Front Page from the toolbar.
In the Set front page for setting select the All Users option. 
Click the Select button.
Choose the Welcome Message option in the Set front page for all 
users setting.
Select the Update Front Page Settings button. 
Now select Home from the main menu and view the front page. The No news items 
at the moment – please check back soon message will have disappeared.
Creating Different Front Pages by User Class
Perhaps you are operating a site that has several administrators to help you manage 
your busy site. You want to be able to communicate with all of them at one time 
without visitors or members viewing this information. An easy way to do this is by 
creating a different front page by User Class, in this case, for Administrators. To 
accomplish this we must do the following:
Log in to the administrative interface.
Select the Front Page icon or select Settings | Front Page from the toolbar.
In the Set front page for setting select the User Class option and then select 
Admin from the drop-down menu.
Click the Select button, which will take you to a new page.
Choose the News option.
Select the Update Front Page Settings button.
Select Home on the main menu and your front page should now look as 
shown in the screenshot on the next page.

Summary
In this chapter we have learned about the numerous site preferences, their function, 
and how to use them for our website. We learned how emoticons can convey 
emotional intent in messages and we learned the various methods of creating our site 
front page. You have absorbed a lot in this chapter. Give yourself a treat by taking a 
break; there is still plenty more to e107 that we have yet to cover.

Customizing the Look and 
Feel of Your Site
While the original theme layout may be suitable while we get our feet wet, at some 
point you may want to change the theme to one that is more reflective of your own 
needs. It is also quite possible that your site will be used by non-English speaking 
persons and you would want to make the site friendlier for them. As you have 
learned, the front end of e107 is what is viewable via a theme. In many programs 
these themes are referred to as templates, but in e107 they are called themes although 
they serve the same concept. You can change your site's appearance by modifying 
the existing theme, using other freely available themes, or making a customized 
theme. We will explore these options and also internationalizing our site in the 
following sections. 
What is a Theme?
Back in the mid 1970s, programming code became so immense that changing even 
the smallest part of a piece of code could have unpredictable effects in the other 
areas of the program. This led to the development of a concept called modular 
programming, which essentially broke the program down into smaller more 
manageable junks that were called upon by the main program when needed. The 
term for modular programming these days is separation of concerns or SoC. But no 
matter what you call it, this is its function. 
In e107 a theme contains a set of modular code containing XHTML (eXtensible 
HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). In its most basic 
explanation, XHTML allows us to take a text document, create a link to other 
documents, and the eXtensible part of the language allows you to create your own 
tags describing data. Thus a program like e107 can use these tags to extract the 
information it needs. The data shouldn’t show up on the screen like a computer 

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your Site

printout; CSS is employed to define the layout of the various elements and tags such 
that they may be viewed with consistency by all browsers. The screenshot below 
shows you the theme files that are available in e107 on the left, and the typical files 
and folders that make up a particular theme on the right.
They say a picture is worth a thousand words so I have used the PHP code that 
makes up the Reline theme, which is what we are using for our front end. Open 
up your FTP client and go to /public_html/e107_themes/reline/. Locate the file 
theme.php and use your FTP client's view/edit feature to open the file. As you can 
see, there is a fair amount of work that goes into creating a theme. If you want to 
design your own themes, I strongly recommend that you are thoroughly familiar 
with PHP, XHTML, and CSS before making the attempt. 
We won't be tackling theme making in this book. We need an advanced book for that 
subject; however, if you have the knowledge and want to create your own theme you 
can find information in the WIKI at http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Creating_
a_theme_from_scratch. But I wanted to show you that these themes take effort so 
you will appreciate those who take the time to develop themes, especially those who 
develop themes and share them at no charge. Remember to thank them, encourage 
them, and offer to send a little money if you like the theme and can use it. It is not a 
requirement but it encourages more development.
Understanding the Theme Layout
The first thing you can to do is log in as administrator and select Admin Area�|
 | 
Menus. The screenshot on the opposite page shows the correlation between the 
areas displayed on the administrator's menu items control page and those on the 
non-administrator page.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
 

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your Site
[ 68 ]
In Chapter 3 we covered the basic screen divisions in a theme (e.g. header, search, 
links, areas, etc.).
Psychology of Color 
One of the biggest mistakes people make is to choose their theme based on their 
personal preferences for layout and colors. You can have the perfect layout and 
great material on your site and yet, people will just not like the site. So you need to 
ask yourself, "why do people not like my site?" or "why aren't they buying from my 
site?" The answer is probably that your theme uses a color that is sending out a very 
different message to your viewers' brains. This is a subject of protracted discussion 
and there are college courses on this subject. Professionally it is referred 
to as psychology of color. Your best bet for online information on colors is at 
http://www.pantone.com. 
Selecting a Theme
Sometimes, the default theme does not quite convey the style you want for your 
site. While functionality is always the primary consideration, it does not mean that 
you have to abandon your sense of style just because you are using a CMS. There 
are three types of themes available for e107. These are the core themes, additional 
themes (located at http://www.e107themes.org), and custom themes.
Core Themes
There are several core themes within your installation of e107. Before we explore 
custom themes, let us look at how you select one of the existing themes:
1.	 Open the administrator menu by clicking the link Admin Area.
2.	 Select Theme Manager (bottom row, second from left).
3.	 Scroll down to kubrick Version 1.0.
4.	 Select the Preview Theme button.

Chapter 4
[ 69 ]

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your Site
[ 70 ]
As you can see in the screenshot on the previous page, this theme would give our 
site a much different look. You will see a heading Theme Preview and then a box 
with information. Use the links provided instead of the back button on your browser. 
From here, you can preview the different themes. Do not worry, you are not actually 
changing anything permanently. If you want to change themes, return to the Theme 
Manager, find the theme, and then select the Set as Site Theme button. You will 
also notice a button Set as Admin Theme. If you do not set the admin theme, it will 
retain the attributes of the default administrative theme or the last administrative 
theme selected.
Always preview a theme before you commit to changing 
the theme on sites that already have a large amount of 
content. Changing the theme may cause information that 
was visible with the old theme not to be visible with the 
new theme. 
It is always a good idea to open up two windows with one 
window showing the front end and the other showing the 
back end. That way if you commit to a new theme and it 
does not work for some reason, you can switch to the back-
end window and change it back. 
Go ahead and apply some other themes and see how they look on the screen. You 
will notice that you can expand some themes to fit the entire screen. When you are 
done, select the kubrick theme but this time make the selection with the Set as Site 
Theme button.
Additional Themes
If none of the core themes appeals to you, I suggest that you go to the official e107 
themes development and repository site at http://www.e107themes.org. When I 
first started writing this book there were only about 9 themes at the site but as of the 
final edits the number of themes has grown close to 100 and I'm sure there will be 
even more by the time this book gets published.
Take a moment to register on the site and then you can preview and download 
themes and avatar packs, and also find information on developing your own themes.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
The procedure for installing one of these themes is explained in the 
following section��. 
Custom Themes
Sometimes a business owner needs to establish a unique identity before the first 
customer gets to see the website. For those individuals using a theme that is 
downloadable no matter how nice it looks is just not sufficient. In such cases you will 
want to make a custom theme. 
I would caution anyone who is considering making own theme or having a theme 
custom made, to ensure the following:
The theme is coded in XHTML a minimum of 1.0, 1.1, or better the latest 
standard, which is version 2.0. You can learn more about XHTML at 
http://www.w3schools.com/xhtml/. 
While browser creators have made better strides to adhere to W3C standards 
you will still run into the occasional rendering quirk. Therefore I recommend 
that CSS 3.0 should be employed for the latest layout technology but 
certainly nothing older than version 2.0. The older the version, the greater the 
chance for cross-browser rendering differences. You can find out more about 
CSS at http://www.w3schools.com/w3c/w3c_css.asp.
The theme is cross browser compatible i.e. with Internet Explorer, Netscape, 
Firefox, and Opera.
Always check the e107 themes site http://www.e107themes.org for 
e107-specific information, updates, and cross-browser issues. (This could 
save you or your developer a lot of time.)
The Internet is rapidly moving away from HTML to 
XHTML with CSS. You will be purchasing obsolete 
technology if you purchase a theme where the designer 
uses tables for the layout. There is also a high probability 
that your theme will not load properly in all browsers. 
For information on creating custom themes, go to the 
e107.org website. This is where you will find design tags 
and information on the requirements for making a theme 
that e107 will recognize.

Once you have your new theme you need to add it to your e107_themes folder so 
that you will be able to select it through the administrative interface. This can be 
accomplished in two ways:
1.	 Open the administrator menu by clicking the link Admin Area.
2.	 Select Themes Manager.
3.	 Scroll down from the default theme. Right below you will see Theme 
Manager :: Upload Theme. 
4.	 Browse to the ZIP file on your computer, and then select Upload Theme.
The theme is now available for selection. Sometimes the ZIP files do not work the 
way they should. If this should happen to you then do the following: 
1.	 Check to make sure that the fileupload_.php is named fileupload.php 
and that the required file extension is contained inside. 
2.	 If the file is zipped, unzip it creating a folder with the name of the theme.
3.	 Open your FTP client.
4.	 Find the source folder where you just unzipped your files.
5.	 On the web server locate the /public_html/cuddlecare/e107_themes/.
6.	 Now copy the entire folder up to the web server.
7.	 The theme is now available for selection through the Themes Manager 
menu.
Deleting Themes
Sometimes you know that you are never going to use a particular theme or themes 
for your site and having it, or those, present is just a waste of resources. To delete 
unwanted themes do the following: 
1.	 Open you FTP client to your server.
2.	 Locate the theme(s) you wish to delete at /public_html/e107_themes/ and 
delete them.
3.	 Close your FTP client.
The next time you look at themes in the administrative interface you will only see the 
themes that you left on your server.

Customizing Layout
Using the control panel, we can modify the look of our site by activating or 
deactivating and changing the menu items. Let us change some things around on our 
site to demonstrate how this works.
Navigate to Area 2 (the first screenshot under the section Understanding the Theme 
Layout labels Area 2) by selecting Admin Area | Menus. Click the drop‑down menu 
below the heading powered_by. You will see a menu that looks as shown in the 
screenshot below. Select Deactivate and the item will disappear from Area 2 and 
appear in the Inactive Menus section in the middle of your screen.
You can check your work without having to log out of the administrative interface 
by opening up a new instance of your browser and viewing your page as a visitor. 
This will save you a lot of time. Do not forget to refresh the second browser after you 
have made changes with the admin browser or you will not see the changes.
Now go view your page as a visitor and you will notice that the Powered By e107, 
PHP and MySQL text and graphics has disappeared. 

Customizing the Look and Feel of Your Site
[ 74 ]
The WYSIWYG Editor
Before we begin modifying how things are displayed on our site I would like to 
introduce you to the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. As you 
remember, we activated this feature when we were setting our site preferences. It 
will automatically appear in those areas where it can be used. The screenshot below 
shows the toolbar layout and functions:
The File Upload Manager
In addition the WYSIWYG editor, another valuable time-saving tool is the File 
Upload Manager. Instead of opening your FTP client each time you want to upload 
a file (images, video clips, sound clips, documents, etc.) you can click on the File 
Manger icon located in the administrative interface.
Before you can use the file upload manager you need to enable it and also to tell 
it what kinds of files you want to allow to be uploaded to the server. Let's do 
this together:
1.	 On your hard drive unzip the e107 files.
2.	 Locate the \e107_admin\ directory.
3.	 Scroll down the file list until you come to filetypes_.php.
4.	 Open the file using Notepad or similar text or PHP editor.
5.	 You should see the following: zip, gz, jpg, png, gif.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
6.	 If you want to add any other file types enter a "," and then the file extension 
(for example: jpeg, swf, wmf, etc.).
7.	 Save the file.
8.	 Rename the file to filetypes.php. (Make sure to remove the "_" before 
the .php.)
9.	 Open your FTP client and upload this file to the 
public_html/e107_admin/ directory.
Place a bookmark here as the steps above may need to be 
repeated when you update e107. If you do not perform the 
steps above and you use the File Upload Manager you will 
get an error message that says:
The filetype image/png (or substitute png with zip, gz, 
jpg, gif, etc.) is not allowed and has been deleted.
If you search in the forums at http://www.e107.org on 
that error message you will see hundreds of requests for 
how to correct this problem. 
If you added the file type and changed the name of the file to filetype.php and still 
get an error message, it is most likely to be a server configuration problem. If you are 
on a shared server probably there will not be much you can do about it as most hosts 
will not change their configurations for just one person. That doesn't mean you 
can't ask.
If you can't upload using the file upload manager then you can still open up your 
FTP client and upload your graphic to the appropriate location.
Creating Menu Items Using the Custom 
Page/Menu Tool 
We are now going to add a small photo of the pet of the month. Use a photo of 
your pet or any pet. I just happened to have a photo that I took of a frisky little pup, 
down in Key West. You may use an image of any pet your wish and perform the 
following steps. 
1.	 Locate the image called pom.png from the images files in the code download 
for this book. If you want to substitute your own pet photo, resize your photo 
to a width of 90 pixels wide and no more than 90 pixels in height. Save the 
file as pom.png.

[ 76 ]
2.	 Upload your graphic file to the server using one of the following 
two methods:
Select Create Menu by navigating to Custom Menus / Pages 
and then use the Upload Images feature located at the bottom 
of the page.
Open your FTP client and upload the pom.png file to the 
directory /public_html/e107_images/custom/.
3.	 Return to the main administrative interface and select the Custom Menus / 
Pages (second row on the left). 
4.	 On the right side of the screen, select the Create menu option.
5.	 Key in Pet of the Month for the Menu Name and Title / Caption.
6.	 Now position the cursor in the text box and use the Insert Image icon located 
on the second line of the WYSIWYG editor just to the left of the HTML icon. 
When the Insert / Edit Image pop-up menu appears, use the Library drop-
down menu and select Custom Images. Next select the pom.png file, set Text 
flow to Left, and select Save. 
7.	 Now select the Create menu at the bottom of the screen 
(see screenshot below).

Deleting a Custom Menu Item
A custom menu item can be deleted easily. We know that we are not going to be 
using Pet of the Month on our Cuddle Care website and want to delete it. 
1.	 Select the Custom Menus/Pages icon.
2.	 Locate the Pet of the Month item which is ID Number 1 and delete it.
This deletes the menu item but does not delete the image file. The image file can be 
deleted in the following manner:
1.	 Open your FTP client.
2.	 Locate the /public_html/e107_images/ directory.
3.	 Delete the pom.png file.
Changing Views by Membership Level
Say you want only registered members to see the blog calendar but you want any 
visitor to the site to see the clock. We can do this using the following procedure:
1.	 Select Menus icon from the administrative interface.
2.	 Select blogcalendar from the Inactive Menus and select Activate in Area 2.
3.	 Use the blogcalander drop-down menu and select the Move to top option.
4.	 Use the same drop-down menu and select Visibility.
5.	 In the Only visible to drop-down box choose the option Members (see the 
screenshot on the next page).
6.	 Next select clock from the Inactive Menus and select Activate in Area 2.
7.	 Use the clock drop-down menu and select the Move to top option.
8.	 Use the same drop-down menu and select Visibility.
9.	 In the Only visible to drop-down box choose the Guests option (see the 
screenshot on the next page).
You will notice that you have the option to display 
specific menu items on all pages, or certain pages. Enter 
one page per line; enter enough of the URL to distinguish 
it properly. If you need the ending of the URL to match 
exactly, use an ! at the end of the page name 
For example: page.php?1!

10.	 Now log out as administrator and you will see the front page with the clock 
just above the Pet of the Month as shown in the screenshot below.

To see the blog calendar, use the username and password that you created for a 
registered user, back in Chapter 3. Once you log in, you will see the front page with 
the blog calendar just above the Pet of the Month but you will not see the clock, as 
shown in the screenshot below:
We can create custom menus as well as a multitude of other items easily. Consider 
the PC Magazine as one of your product to be sold online. Say you joined an affiliate 
program and made a commission from every sale of a PC Magazine from your site. 
You could edit the menu item to include a URL so that when someone clicked on 
the PC Magazine image a new window would open up and go to the specified 
web page.

Internationalization—Using a Custom 
Language File 
The beauty of the Internet is that it gives you an opportunity to reach customers who 
speak other languages. While core language files do not translate the text of your site, 
the language packs do contain the necessary character sets for most languages and, 
if properly installed, will allow your visitors to select an installed language that will 
allow them to navigate the site in a familiar language.
It is very easy to make e107 multilingual for your users. Cuddle Care has a fair 
number of clients who speak Spanish so we are going to enable the user to select 
Spanish to navigate the site. To do this we must first download the language file that 
we need as follows: 
1.	 Go to� http://e107.cvs.sourceforge.net/e107/e107_langpacks/
zipped_langpacks_utf-8/. 
2.	 Locate the most recent file that starts with e107_0.7.x Spanish_UTF (here x 
denotes the most recent version).
3.	 Locate Links to HEAD and click on download.
4.	 Save the file to your computer.
5.	 Unzip the file.
6.	 Log on to your FTP client.
7.	 Upload each of the folders (e107_docs, e107_handlers, e107_languages, 
e107_plugins, and e107_themes) in the unzipped files to your e107 root 
installation /public_html/cuddlecare/.
Make sure to set your FTP client so that it only overwrites 
files that are newer than the ones on the web server when 
uploading e107 files.

Now we are going to create a small PHP file. Freeze! Don't run away if you have 
never written PHP code. I promise that this is a painless procedure as long as you 
copy the code just as it appears below. Let us walk through it step by step.
Open up Notepad or a similar text editor. (Do not use a word processing program or 
WordPad as these programs may add extra characters that will contaminate 
the code.)
Enter the following text:
<?php
define("LAN_MYUSERCLASS","Mi Userclasso"); 
?>
Save this with the file name Spanish_custom.php.
Congratulations! If you have never done so before then you have just created your 
first bit of PHP coding.
Open a new Notepad and enter the following text:
<?php
define("LAN_MYUSERCLASS","My Userclass"); 
?>
Save this with the file name English_custom.php
Now that we have our files, it is time to upload them to the server in the 
following manner: 
1.	 Locate the directory 
/public_html/cuddlecare/e107_languages/Spanish/.
2.	 Upload the file Spanish_custom.php. 
3.	 Locate the directory /public_html/cuddlecare/e107_languages/.

as shown in the screenshot below:

[ 91 ]
Now we have to make our language selection menu available for visitors and 
members in the following manner:
1.	 Open the administrative interface.
2.	 Select User Classes (see the screenshot below).
3.	 In the Class Name text box key in LAN_MYUSERCLASS. 
4.	 Select the Create New Class button.
5.	 Return to the administrative interface.
Log out as administrator and view your front page. You will now see that the 
language selection is in the upper left corner just above the log on. Just as an 
experiment, select Spanish and select Set Language. Your screen should look as 
shown in the screenshot on the next page.

To change the language back to English, just select English and click on the Eligir 
Idoma button. Congratulations! You now know how to make the navigation of your 
site multilingual. 
Summary
In this chapter we have learned the correlation between the administrative interface 
and the front page and the various methods of adding information to our website. 
We explored how making changes in the method used to display that information 
changes how the information is displayed on our front page. We also learned how to 
create custom menu items, activate them, move and deactivate others, and learned 
about the text editor and file uploads manager and how to use them. We made our 
site multilingual to make it easier for people of other nationalities to navigate our site 
more easily. And for some of us, we wrote our first piece of PHP code. 

Customizing Your Site for 
e-Commerce with Plugins 
We have only been using a fraction of the power of e107 until now. If you were using 
e107 for a personal site or a small hobby site, then you would have completed your 
site except for adding some text and images to it. However, with version 0.7.x (where 
x is the latest version), we now have the tools to make e107 a powerful open-source 
CMS for e-commerce. In this chapter, we will work with setting up a shopping cart, 
banner advertisements, and a frequently asked questions section.
Introduction to Plugins
There are two types of plugins that are available for use with e107. There are the core 
aka certified plugins and non-core plugins. The biggest difference between the two 
types is that core plugins are created by members of the development team and as 
such are packaged with e107. Non-core plugins are created by other developers who 
found a need, developed the plugin, and then uploaded it for others to use. This is 
one of the greatest assets of open‑source software.
While neither set of plugins is free from the occasional bug, I would always use the 
core plugin when available, only for the reason that the development team is more 
intimate with the core code and with upcoming changes to that code.  
The site for all e107 plugins is at http://www.e107coders.org. This is the official 
repository; however, I would caution you to go to the developer's website before 
downloading and installing non-core plugins, as often developers are not quick to 
post updates to the http://www.e107coders.org site.

How to Install Plugins 
Before we go into installing specific plugins, let's cover the general methods for 
installing and uninstalling both core and non-core plugins. This is primarily done so 
that you do not have to read through the entire chapter to refresh your memory later 
when you have worked with e107 and just need a quick reference.
Core Plugin Installation
This is the easiest type of plugin to install because it is a part of the e107 core package 
and it is contained within your e107 installation. To install a core plugin you perform 
the following procedures:
1.	 Log in as administrator.
2.	 From the administrator interface select Plugin Manager at the bottom of 
the screen.
3.	 A page will be displayed; select the plugin that you wish to install by clicking 
on the Install button to the right of each listing. (See the screenshot on the 
next page.)
4.	 When you have selected, the plugin will move to the top of the screen in the 
Installed section with a small green box to the left of the plugin name.
5.	 That completes a core plugin installation.

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
Installing a Non-Core Plugin
The first thing you need to do is to go to http://www.e107coders.org and look 
over the plugins that are available. Once you have found the one you like, do 
the following:
1.	 Download the plugin to your hard drive.
2.	 Unzip the file.
3.	 Open your FTP client.
4.	 Locate the /public_html/e107_plugins/ folder. 
5.	 Upload the unzipped folder to the /public_html/e107_plugins/ folder.

Customizing Your Site for e-Commerce with Plugins
[ 96 ]
6.	 Log in as administrator.
7.	 From the administrative interface select Plugin Manager at the bottom of 
the screen.
8.	 A page with plugins will be displayed; select a plugin that you wish to 
install by clicking on the Install button to the right of each listing. (See the 
screenshot below.)
9.	 When you have selected, the plugin will move to the top of the screen in the 
installed plugins with a small green box to the left of the plugin name.
10.	 That completes a non-core plugin installation.
Plugin Manager Upload Plugin Option
The reason we used the procedure for uploading a non-core plugin instead of 
just using this handy little "browse and install feature" is that often the feature 
doesn't work properly. Now don't go blaming the development team, as they are 
trying to find a solution. The problem seems to be similar to trying to develop a flu 
vaccination. There are many reasons that cause mixed results with this feature. It 
could be that the developer didn't zip the package properly but most of the time is 
that there are multiple ways of configuring a server and unless you have a host that 
specializes in e107 hosting the only sure way is to download, unzip, ftp, select, and 
install. However, you can try using the upload feature by browsing to the ZIP file, 

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
select the uploaded plugin. If the server is configured to be e107 friendly then you 
will see your plugin appear in the list of plugins. If not, you will get a message 
that says:
That file does not appear to be a valid .zip or .tar archive.
If you see that message then just follow the procedure as explained above.
Uninstalling a Plugin
If you don't need a plugin, you should uninstall it. It is a good practice to keep your 
system as clean as possible to avoid unnecessary slowness. To uninstall a plugin you 
need to go to the Plugin Manager interface and do the following:
1.	 Locate the plugin from the Installed plugins section.
2.	 Select the Uninstall button.
3.	 The next page that appears is the uninstall interface as shown in the 
screenshot below. Here you will have two options:  
Delete plugin tables: This will remove the plugin tables from 
the server.
Delete plugin files: This will remove the plugin from 
the server.
4.	 Generally, you can keep the default settings and then select Confirm 
uninstall.
5.	 Return to the administrative interface.
6.	 Select Database.

7.	 Select Optimize SQL database.
Banner Plugin
The banner plugin is part of the core plugins so you do not need to go further than 
the administrative interface to find it. It is always active, even if you are not presently 
using the feature.
There are several ways to advertise with banners on your site. One of the things I have 
disliked about some books is that they tell you how to do the obvious but leave out 
the information that might be more useful. Keeping that in mind, we will cover how 
to use the banner plugin but, since we are using a theme that does not have a banner 
included, we are going to begin this section with a quick lesson on code modification.
Adding the Banner Shortcode to a Theme
For our veterinarian site, the Kubrick theme is perfect except that it does not have a 
banner. Fortunately e107 has made it easy for us to add a banner. We accomplish this 
by adding what is known as a shortcode. For those who may have done merge letters 
in word processing programs a shortcode is similar to a merge code. For those of you 
who do not know what any of this means, a shortcode is a small instruction that tells 
the program to insert specific information from the database or to run a specific script 
and place the information in the area of the theme where the shortcode is located. 
In e107 shortcodes are enclosed in brackets and capitalized. Thus the shortcode for 
banner is {BANNER}.  
We want to add a banner to the bottom of our website and in order to do this we 
must add the {BANNER} tag to our theme. Let's do this together:
1.	 Move to the location where you have placed the e107 files during installation.
2.	 Locate the theme.php file in the Kubrick folder under e107_themes (see the 
screenshot on the next page):

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
3.	 Right-click on the theme.php file and selecting Open will open the file in 
Notepad.
4.	 Scroll down and you will see the beauty of CSS. Each section is clearly 
marked such as $HEADER, $FOOTER, etc. The section we are looking for is 
$FOOTER (as shown below):
       // [layout]
      $layout = "_default";
      $HEADER = "<div id='page'>
      <div id='header'>
      <h1><a href='".SITEURL."' title='{SITENAME}'>{SITENAME}</a></h1>
      <h2>{SITETAG}</h2>
      {UL}
      </div>
      <div id='content' class='narrowcolumn'>";
      $FOOTER = "
      </div>
      <div id='sidebar'>
      {MENU=1}
      {MENU=2}
      </div>

Customizing Your Site for e-Commerce with Plugins
[ 100 ]
      <hr />
      <div id='footer'>
      <p>{SITEDISCLAIMER}<br />{THEMEDISCLAIMER}
      </p>
      </div>
      </div>
      ";
      $CUSTOMHEADER = "<div id='page2'>
      <div id='header'>
      <h1><a href='".SITEURL."' title='{SITENAME}'>{SITENAME}</a></h1>
      <h2>{SITETAG}</h2>
      {UL}
      </div>
      <div id='content' class='widecolumn'>";
5.	 Position your cursor between the <p> tag and the {SITEDISCLAIMER} 
shortcode and key in {BANNER}<br /> to give the following:
      $FOOTER = "
      </div>
      <div id='sidebar'>
      {MENU=1}
      {MENU=2}
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div id='footer'>
      <p>{BANNER}<br/>
      {SITEDISCLAIMER}<br />{THEMEDISCLAIMER}
      </p>
      </div>
      </div>
      "; 
6.	 Save the file as theme.php overwriting the existing file.

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
7.	 Open your FTP client and connect to 
/public_html/e107_themes/kubrick/.
8.	 On the server rename your theme.php file to theme_old.php 
(see screenshot below).
9.	 Now upload your new theme.php file to the server.
10.	 Open up your browser and view your website front page. You should now 
see the banner holder at the bottom of the page (see the screenshot on the 
next page).

[ 102 ]
11.	 Now close your FTP client.

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
Creating a Banner Ad Campaign
Now that our banner marker is in place, we need to replace the generic e107 banners 
with the banners we wish to display on the site. This is done by creating a banner ad 
campaign. The banners you need are contained within the e107_images.rar file that 
you should have downloaded in Chapter 4 from http://packt.connetek.com. 
If you would like to learn how to make your own banners, 
open up your browser and search on How to make a banner. 
You will find plenty of instructions and primers.
You can make the graphic a .gif, .jpg, or .png file.
We are going to be using a standard size horizontal banner which is 468 x 60 
pixels. After you have unzipped images file that you retrieved from 
http://packt.connetek.com do the following:
1.	 Locate the pet911_01.gif and vcbanner.gif files.
2.	 Upload them to the server using either:
The File Manager utility: This will upload to the images or 
banners folder.
The FTP client: This will upload to the e107_images | 
banners| folder.
3.	 The next step may seem a bit strange; however, once you realize that banners 
are the same as ads or commercials you will come to know that people seem 
to prefer banner over ads or commercials. You may have a site that draws 
lots of traffic and want to capitalize on this by selling banner advertising. The 
banner plugin gives you the option to not only sell banner space for a specific 
amount of time but also by the number of times a banner has been clicked 
on (selected) by the viewer. Before we can activate our new banner, we must 
first create a banner campaign. Now there you go again running for the door. 
Take a deep breath, relax, and we will walk through this together: 
If you are not already online, log in, navigate to the 
administrative interface, and select Banners. On the next 
screen, you will see three sample banner campaigns and a 
small menu on the right side of the screen; select create 
new banner.
On the next screen where it says Campaign, go to the right of 
the drop-down menu, as we want to create a new campaign. 
Type in pet911_one.
°

[ 104 ]
For the Client, go to the right of the drop-down menu, and 
key in Pets911.
We are going to skip login and password as we are the client 
but if you wanted to grant access to your advertising client 
to change their banners or campaigns you would assign a 
username and password for them.
Select the Choose banner image button and you will see all 
the available banners on the server. Select the banner that 
you just uploaded by ticking the circle box to the left of 
the banner.
Now you need to enter the URL where the visitor is to be 
sent when the banner is clicked. For my particular banner it is 
http://www.pets911.com.
If you are selling advertising space by impression then you 
would enter the number of impressions in the Impressions 
Purchased. To display the banner indefinitely insert a zero in 
the block.
The start and end dates are self-explanatory. The dates are in 
international format so it may seem odd for US dwellers. The 
date is in the format dd/mm/yyyy.
The last field visibility class is set for targeting your 
advertising more closely. By default the viewing is set to 
the user group Everyone (public); however, say you have 
an advertiser who wants to target a specific group like your 
registered members or some other user group, then you have 
to select the appropriate visibility class. This can result in 
your website having one banner displayed on the front page 
to everyone and another that is displayed only after a user has 
registered and logged into the site. For Cuddle Care we are 
going to use Everyone (public) for our campaign. 
This completes adding the information for our advertising campaign. Your screen 
should now look like as shown in the next page. To complete the process, select the 
Update Banner button

Now create a second campaign using the same procedure as above with the 
following changes:
Campaign Name: In this field enter VetCentric01.
Banner Image: In this field select the vcbanner.gif banner.
URL: In this field enter, http://www.vetcentric.com. 
You are doing really great but we aren’t finished yet.  
Activating the Ad Campaign
Now that we have created the campaign, we need to activate it so that it will be 
displayed on our website (see the screenshot on the next page). To do this we need to 
complete the following steps:
1.	 Click on banner menu using the menu on the right side of your screen.
2.	 Under available campaigns, select pet911_one. It will move to the right in 
the selected campaigns box.

[ 106 ]
3.	 For Render type choose the plain option.
4.	 Select the Update Menu Settings button.
5.	 Now repeat the above process but change the campaign to vetcent_one.
You have now created and published your ad campaign. To check it out, click on 
Home in the main menu. You should now see the banner at the bottom of your page 
in place of the generic e107.org banner. Now select the browser refresh button a 
couple of times and you will see the other banner.
Shopping Cart Plugin
With shopping cart plugins, you can increase the power of your e107 to offer 
different levels of merchandise. After discussing the products that Cuddle Care 
wanted to offer, I searched the http://www.e107coders.org site for e-commerce 
plugins. After viewing the various homepages for the plugins for ZoGo-Shop, 
CafePress, JB Shop, and EBay Auctions, the ZoGo-Shop seemed to provide the 
features and support that a small proprietor would need.
If you have skipped directly to this section, you need to upload the plugin using the 
same procedures as outlined in How to Install Plugins at the beginning of this chapter. 
Once the plugin is loaded, log in to the administrative interface and perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Select the Plugin Manager icon from the Plugins section.
2.	 Locate the Zogo-Shop plugin and select the Install button.
3.	 Just under the Plugin Successfully Installed message you will see 
[Configure]. Click on Configure (see screenshot on the next page).

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
The next screen that will be seen is the ZoGo-Shop Administrative Center. From 
here, we will be able to configure every aspect of our store. We are just going to 
cover the basics of this plugin while building our store; however, I have included the 
manual at http://www.connetek.com for downloading, or you can also refer to the 
ZoGo-Shop manual at http://www.mytipper.com/download.php?view.3, which 
explains all aspects of the plugin.   
On the right side of your screen, you will notice a menu. This is the ZoGo-Shop 
administration menu. We will be using this menu to complete the configuration of 
our store. As you will see, some of these setting will be different for you depending 
on where you live. Feel free to use your own currencies, taxes, etc.
Main ZoGo-Shop Settings
When you click the Main ZoGo-Settings link from the administration menu a page 
will be displayed. Enter the data in these fields as mentioned below:

Manage Store Categories
In this section we are going to learn about how to manage store categories. To manage 
store categories select Manage Store Categories from the menu to the right.
Adding Store Categories
Just to keep things from becoming too complex we will just add three categories: 
Treats, Flea and Tick Control, and Collar and Leashes. All fields must be completed 
when creating a category. For the most part these are self explanatory except where 
noted. Let's create our categories:
Category Name: In this field enter the category name, Treats.
Parent Category: If you are going to create a sub-category, you need to 
specify the parent category in this block. We will enter NONE.
Category Display Order: This field determines the order of category. We will 
enter 1.
Category Images: Choose the image option and from the pop-up menu select 
myStore.gif.
Category Description: In this field enter some description about the category. 
We will enter: Treats and chews that are healthy and safe for your pets.
Active: If you want to activate the category you check the box to make it 
available. Select the yes option. 
Click on the Submit button.
Using the above steps, repeat the procedure for Flea and Tick Control and Collar 
and Leashes. For Category Display Order substitute 2 and 3 in place of the 1, then 
enter test description for Category Description. 
To speed things up instead of adding an image you will 
just select the noimg.jpg. Of course when you set up your 
own store, you would create the graphic or photo, upload it 
to the images folder, and then you would select it.
Editing and Deleting Categories
You can edit and delete categories from the same screen where you have added the 
categories. Once you have created your first category and the screen refreshes you 
will notice a new block at the top of the screen entitled Category List as shown in the

Manage Gateways
At the time I installed this plugin, there were two methods for your customers to 
pay through ZoGo Shop. One is to pay by PayPal, which requires you to open up a 
PayPal Merchant Account www.paypal.com. This is a very inexpensive and less risky 
way for you to begin accepting credit/debit cards and e-checks over the internet. 
The other is for the customer to print the order and mail it along with a check or 
money order to you. We always like to offer both as some people still do not trust 
internet transactions but on the flip side exercise caution when accepting checks and 
money orders.
On the ZoGo-Shop menu to the right select Manage Gateways and follow along:
Select both gateways as Activate.

then you will see a nicely formatted and professional invoice, which you can save to 
your computer or print out as shown on the next page. 
Before testing the PayPal payment function, make sure to 
check your PayPal Merchant Account to set up for testing. 
Otherwise, PayPal will charge your account.

Select ZoGo-Shop from the Plugins section. 
Select Manage Orders from the ZoGo administrative interface.
Select the Order Number option from the Filter by combo box and click the 
search button.
Here you will see the received orders. When you box up and ship the 
package check the shipping block. Once the package has left your shop, you 
can mark the order as complete.
If after placing the order, the customer decides to cancel, just click on the 
delete order key located under the Total Price. 
Always make sure to print out copies of orders and make 
regular daily MySQL backups. Check with your web-
hosting service if you are unfamiliar with how to perform 
the backups and to automate the backup procedure.
ZoGo-Shop is easy to use, has a nice interface, and great support. It is ideal if you 
do not have a mega store. If you like this plugin, you should consider purchasing it. 
The cost is modest and your store will be rid of the built-in advertising. Your support 
also helps to encourage developers to upgrade their plugins and make new ones.
If you are going to open a store with thousands of items then you will want 
to check out osCommerce http://www.oscommerce.org/. This is a very powerful 
and sophisticated piece of software, yet it is amazingly simple to learn and 
use. If osCommerce is the program you need, then make a post on the 
http://www.e107coders.org and the http://www.oscommerce.org websites 
briefly stating that you are seeking a programmer to develop a bridge between e107 
and osCommerce. Your best bet is to incorporate in your ad that you willing to pay 
for the code. Like all contract jobs, make sure to get references. 
Packt Publishing offers both Beginner's edition and 
Professional edition osCommerce books written by David 
Mercer, and the Deep Inside osCommerce: The Cookbook by 
Monica Mathé. Visit the official website of Packt Publishing,

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) 
Plugin
This is a fantastic plugin if you have clients who are constantly calling or emailing 
requesting answers to questions of a general nature. If used properly, this can be a 
great time saver for you, your sales/support team, and your clients. 
To get started obtain the latest version of the plugin from http://www.e107coders.
com . Then upload it to the server using your FTP client as explained earlier. Once 
this has been completed log on to the administrative interface. Locate the FAQ 
plugin and perform the following steps:
Click the Install button. 
Once you have done the install process of the plugin, check to see if the 
plugin status light is green. If it is green, you have installed the plugin 
successfully. If it is yellow, then click on the upgrade button to the right.
Once the plugin is successfully installed, it will take you to the next page. 
Locate the area where it says The FAQ plugin is installed. To configure 
go to your admin page and click the FAQ link in the plugins section. 
[Configure] and click on Configure. 
If for some reason, you jumped ahead or left the page 
and want to get back to configure it you can return to the 
administrative interface, scroll to the bottom under Plugins, 
and select the FAQ icon.
Adding Categories
Now that we have successfully installed the plugin, we want to create topic 
categories. We will enter the FAQ admin screen. If you have been following along 
you are already there, if you left then follow the instructions in the information box 
above to get to the screen. However, before we begin we need to be in the right 
frame of reference. Think of the category as a filing cabinet. Its purpose is to provide 
space for the file drawers (sub-categories) and the file drawers (sub-categories) hold 
the files (the questions and responses). Now that we are all on the same page, we are 
going to add some categories by performing the following steps:
1.	 Select Add Category from the menu to the right and a screen will appear as 
shown on the next page:

top menu bar. You will now see the number 1 by both the Hours of Operation and 
the Credentials indicating that these categories each have one FAQ .
Summary
In Chapter 5 we learned about core and non-core plugins to enhance the capabilities 
of our e107-powered site. We learned where to find non-core plugins and how 
to install them through the plugin installer as well as how to bypass the plugin 
upload utility if the need arises. We learned how to install and configure the banner 
advertising plugin, ZoGo Cart shopping cart plugin, and the Frequently Asked 
Questions plugin.

Customizing Your Site for 
Business with Plugins
In the last chapter, we learned how to customize e107 for the particular needs of 
e‑commerce and in this chapter we will explore and install various plugins that can 
turn our e107 site into a powerful business website.
User Class
In this chapter we will begin to use plugins for our business site where we want to 
control who has access to view the information and who may post comments, make 
posts, upload photos, participate in polls, or download information. These are just a 
few of the things that can be controlled via user class aka userclass. 
User class is assigned through the administrative interface. There are four user 
classes that are initially assigned when you install e107: 
1.	 Everyone (Public): This user class provides access to anyone who visits the 
site to view, post, or manipulate the data.
2.	 No one (Inactive): If this user class is selected then no one will be able to 
view whatever has been assigned to this user group. 
3.	 Admin: When this user class is selected, only those with administrative 
privileges will be able to view, post, or manipulate the data.
4.	 Main Admin: When this user class is selected, only the main administrator 
will be able to view, post, or manipulate the data.

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 126 ]
Creating a User Class
Say we wanted to restrict access to certain sections or functions to members of the 
website. We would create a new user class by doing the following (see the 
screenshot below):
1.	 Select the User Classes icon from the administrative interface.
2.	 In the Class Name field enter Members.
3.	 In the Class Description field enter Registered Members.
4.	 Select the Create New Class button.
Attaching a User Class to a User
We have created the class but how do we assign users to it? Well some plugins do 
this for you depending upon their function, but you can assign any user class to any 
registered user. Since we already have a member called Registered User that we 
created back in Chapter 3 we will assign this user to our newly created member's 
user class. To do this we will need to:
1.	 Select the Users icon from the administrative interface.
2.	 To the right of the Registered User link locate the drop-down menu under 
the Options column and select Set Class as shown below:

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
3.	 Once you have made your selection, you will automatically advance to the 
next screen as shown below.
4.	 Optionally, check the box to notify the user of their updated user class.
5.	 Select the Set Classes button. 
Deleting a User from a User Class
Let's say that we wanted to remove Registered User from the members' user class. 
To do this we would:
1.	 Select the Users icon from the administrative interface.
2.	 Find the user you want to delete and locate the drop-down menu under the 
Options column and select Set Class as we did before.
3.	 You will advance to the next screen automatically. Uncheck the box that says 
Members as shown below.
4.	 Optionally, check the Notify User checkbox to notify the user of their 
updated user class.
Assigning Admin User Class to a User or 
Removing It
Assigning admin privileges to a user or removing them is very simple. Say we wanted 
to assign Registered User to the admin user class. We would do the following:
1.	 Select the Users icon from the administrative interface.
2.	 Find the user and locate the drop-down menu under the Options column 
and select Make admin.

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 128 ]
3.	 To remove administrative privileges you would once again locate the 
drop-down menu to the right of Registered User and select Remove 
admin status.
Before we move on, go back and reassign Registered User to the Members user class.
The Forum Plugin
If you visit any business website, you will find a forum. It can be open to the public, 
restricted to registered members, or it may be an internal forum only for employees 
or for both visitors and employees. Sometimes it is set up for peers to help peers 
solve problems. By controlling access to view and post by user class, we can easily 
achieve this level of control.
Normally, before you would install this plugin you would plan the parent categories 
(topical subdivisions), the forums (the topics within those categories), and the 
permissions level for viewing, posting, and administering the forums. The main 
purpose of breaking information into parent levels is to assist users in finding things 
faster, so resist the urge to over categorize.
Installing Forum
The Forum plugin is one of the core e107 plugins. As you know this means that we 
have uploaded it to the server when we installed e107. To install the plugin we need 
to do the following:
1.	 Log on to our website as administrator.
2.	 If you are using the default admin theme (Jayya v1.0) for administration, 
use the drop-down menu on the top-left side of your screen and select 
Plugins. If you are using another theme, scroll down to the Plugins section 
and select Plugin Manager.
3.	 Locate the Forum plugin and click on the Install button.
4.	 Just under the successfull installation message you will see: Your forum is 
now installed [Configure]. Click on Configure.
5.	 You will then be taken to the forum-configuration interface as shown in the 
screenshot on the next page.

Chapter 6
[ 129 ]
Creating the Forum Parents
Before creating any forums, we have to create our forum parents (topical 
subdivisions). You may only have a small organization and not need different 
categories but in order to create a forum you must have at least one parent as it acts 
as the container that holds the forums. This can be done as follows:
1.	 Select Create Parents from the Configuration Menu.
2.	 In the Name field enter General Information. 
3.	 Leave the Viewable by field set to Everyone (public). 
4.	 Set the Post permission field to Members.
5.	 Select the Create Parent button.
6.	 Similarly create the following forum parents listed below:
Dogs and Puppies 
Cats and Kittens
Birds
Other Animals
Pets and Travel
Miscellaneous Pet Topics
If you select Forums Front Page from the Forums Options menu at the right-hand 
side, you will now see the Existing Forums screen where you see the parent categories 
and the various permission levels. In the screenshot on the next page you can see that 
while the parent categories exist, there are no forums created under the categories. We 
will learn to create forums under the parent categories in the following section. If you 
made a mistake in the creation process, you can edit it here by clicking on the Edit icon 
under the Options column.

Creating the Forums
Now that we have defined our parent categories, we will create our forums.
1.	 Click on Create Forums from the Forum Options menu.
2.	 In the Parent drop-down menu General Information is selected 
by default.
3.	 Enter General Information for the forum's Name field.
4.	 In the Description field enter: This forum contains general information 
about Cuddle Care and using this forum. It is a read-only forum.
5.	 In the Moderators drop-down menu select Admin.
6.	 In the Viewable By drop-down menu select Everyone (public). 
7.	 In the Post Permission drop-down menu select Admin. 
8.	 Make forums for the rest of the parents in the same manner, except for Dogs 
and Puppies and Cats and Kittens, with the following changes:
In the Post Permission drop-down menu select Members.
°

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
In the Description field substitute the name of the forum as 
applicable (e.g. This forum is for the discussion of pet topics 
not covered elsewhere. You must be a registered member 
to post to this forum). You can copy the forum descriptions 
from the screenshot below.
9.	 Now make a forum for Dogs and Puppies. In the Name field enter Dogs and 
Puppies beginning with an asterisk (*). The asterisk tells the plugin to create 
the forum as a container for holding sub-forums.
10.	 In the Description field enter: This forum is divided into two sub-forums. 
One is for the discussion of adult dogs and the other for the discussion of 
puppies. You must be a registered member to post to this forum.
11.	 Similarly, create a forum container for Cats and Kittens changing the 
description appropriately.
Now select Forums Front Page and it should look as shown below:
°

[ 132 ]
Creating the Sub-Forums
As you can imagine, if you created enough forums the page would just get longer 
and longer. Fortunately, e107 also helps to create sub-forums. This can be done 
as follows:
1.	 Click on the Forums Front Page.
2.	 Locate the Dogs and Puppies forum. Click on the Configure Sub Forums 
icon under the Options column.
3.	 In the Name field, enter Puppies for the sub-forum name.
4.	 In the Description field, enter This forum is for the discussion of 
adult dogs. You must be a registered member to post to this forum.
5.	 In the Order field enter 0.
6.	 Select the Create sub-forums button.
7.	 Similarly create another forum Dogs. In the Name field enter Dogs for the 
second sub-forum name.
8.	 In the Description field, enter This forum is for the discussion of 
puppies. You must be a registered member to post to this forum.
9.	 In the Order field enter 0 for order and then select the Create 
sub-forums button.

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
Click on Forums Front Page to view the updated list. Now click on the Dogs and 
Puppies forum link. You will see your sub-forums as shown in the screenshot below. 
Repeat the above process for Cats and Kittens.

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 134 ]
Now click on the Dogs sub-forum and you will see our dog forum ready for our 
first post. (See the screenshot below).

Chapter 6
[ 135 ]
Changing the Category Order
Sometimes when we don't plan ahead, we create our categories and forums on 
the fly, or someone thinks of adding more after we have already set up our initial 
categories and forums. We can adjust the order in which categories and forums 
are displayed. This is controlled through the Forum Order option. In forum 
administration, select Forum Order from the Forum Options menu. As you view the 
page, you will notice that all the categories and forums are numbered 1. Unless we 
change the order all categories appear in the order created.
We want to change the order of our categories so that they are alphabetical with the 
General Information category at the top and other miscellaneous category at the 
bottom. To do this, locate the drop-down menu with the number for the category 
and change the following:
General Information: This forum will have order number 1
Birds: This forum will have order number 2
Cats and Kittens: This forum will have order number 3
Dogs and Puppies: This forum will have order number 4
Other Animals: This forum will have order number 5
Pets and Travel: This forum will have order number 6
Miscellaneous Pet Topics: This forum will have order number 7

Now select the Update Order button. If you have completed this task correctly, your 
screen will now appear as shown on the next page.
Changing the Forum Order
If we had more than one forum under a category you would be able to use the 
drop-down menus for the forums to change the order just as we did to change the 
category order above. If there is only one forum then the drop-down menu will only 
show the number 1.

Chapter 6
[ 137 ]
Changing the Order of the Sub-Forums 
To change the order of a sub-forum is slightly different. Say we would like to put 
Kittens first and then Cats second. We would do the following:
Select the Forum plugin from the administrative interface.
1.	 Select the Configure sub-forums button (the blue round-shaped button next 
to the Delete button) as shown in the screenshot on the next page.
2.	 In the next screen locate the Order column, which is to the right of the forum 
description. Key in 2 next to Cats and a 1 next to Kittens as shown in the 
screenshot on the next page.

3.	 Select the Update sub-forums button. Make sure not to select the Create 
Sub-forums button or your changes will not be saved.
You can now check to make sure that the order has changed by going to the Forums 
Front Page and clicking on the *Cats and Kittens title/hyperlink.
Setting Forum Preferences
How you set forum preferences will largely depend upon the type of site you are 
operating, server loads, and other factors. For most of the things, you will not have 
to make any changes from the default settings; however, I want to cover all the 
preference settings so that you know what they are, what they do, and how to set 
them up. Remember that you can always find information on all the functions at 
http://wiki.e107.org and help in the forums at http://www.e107.org.
You can set the forum preferences by selecting the Preferences option from the 
Forum Options menu. A Forum Options page will appear; make changes to the 
settings as follows:
1.	 Enclose tables Tick this to render the forum within theme table: Select 
the checkbox.
2.	 Skip down to the Enable file / image attachments setting. To use this setting 
you also need to check 'Enable image posting' on the images page.

Chapter 6
[ 139 ]
When you select the set max file size link—click here under the Enable file 
/ image attachments you will be taken to a configuration screen as shown in 
the screenshot below. Let's change the settings to:
Uploads enabled? Choose the Yes option.
Storage type: Select the Flatfile option.
Maximum file size: Set this field to 100kb.
Allowed file types: Select Members from the drop-down 
menu. Finish the configuration by selecting the Submit button.
Next we need to configure the Images Settings. To do this first locate Plugins 
in the top-left menu and select Forum from the Plugins drop-down menu. 
Select Preferences from the Forum Options menu to the right. In the Enable 
file / image attachments field click on the images link and do the following:
Enable image posting: This will display images, this will 
apply site-wide (comments, chatbox, etc.). We will select 
the checkbox.
Image posting class: When this is enabled it will restrict users 
who can post images. We will set it to Members Only.
Disabled image method: We will set this to the Show image 
URL option.
Resize method: This method is used to resize images, either 
GD1/2 library, or ImageMagick. This setting will depend 
upon what your web hosting provider has installed. Usually 
you are safe with the default setting of gd2.

Your screen should look as shown in the screenshot below. Click the Update 
Options button at the bottom of the screen to finalize your settings. If later 
you decide that you want or need to change the settings come back, make the 
changes, and finish by clicking on the Update Options button.
Prune
In time, your forums will grow in size. As this happens, fewer people will look at 
the original posts as the most current information will be at the top of the forum. 
Additionally, certain information becomes obsolete after a specific time. Pruning 
(removing) obsolete information will improve server response time and decrease 
storage requirements. 
To solve this problem the forum comes with a tool to prune the information. This is 
a fantastic timesaver but you have the ability to delete huge amounts of data so it is 
necessary to exercise extreme caution. 

Chapter 6
[ 143 ]
With prune, we can select from any or all of the available forums to:
Prune topics that have not had a response within a set number of days
Delete posts completely
Make posts inactive
The forum prune function is accessed by selecting Prune from the Forum Options 
menu. When you access the prune function you will see a screen that has well 
documented choices. 
Exercise extreme care when using the prune function. 
Before selecting the Carry Out Prune button cross-check 
the updates you are making to make sure you didn't make 
any mistake.
Ranks
While we are not going to use ranks with the Cuddle Care forum you should be 
aware that you have the ability to assign "ranks" to users. Ranks are a means of 
acknowledging that certain users are more active in the forum through posts than 
others. When you installed the forums plugin it came preconfigured with a ranks 
point system. To access this screen select Ranks from the Forum Options menu. The 
screen will look as shown in the screenshot below:
•
•
•

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 144 ]
You have the versatility to name these ranks to match the subject matter of your 
forum. Say for instance that you are making a military site you might assign the 
ranks of Colonel down to Private. You can assign up to 10 levels and the number 
of posts (points) a member must make before they advance to the next level. This 
encourages participation and in many cases, you will find that users who participate 
frequently often provide excellent responses to less frequent users. This will save you 
or your appointed forum administrator much time. You may also change the points 
and the graphics.
Forum Rules
You can create forum rules for guests, members, and administrators. In most cases 
everyone uses the same set of rules; however, the option is available should you 
desire to make distinctions. We are not going to add forum rules into our forum to 
save time. To create forum rules select Forum Rules from the Forums Options menu. 
We would then have the option of adding them in one of two manners:
Use the built-in WYSIWYG editor and enter the information.
Use a word processor to create the forum rules, check for spelling, and then 
cut and paste into the blocks for guests, members, and/or administrators 
as applicable.
To activate forum rules make sure to check the Activation box under the Rules for 
Guest, Rules for Members, and Rules for Administrators. Click the Submit button.
If you are uncertain as to what forum rules are, you can open your internet browser 
and do a search on forum rules. Most forum rules are similar.
Reported Posts
When someone reports a post, it is flagged and appears in a list under reported posts. 
This enables the forum administrator to view the post and take appropriate action. 
When we set our forum preferences we checked the block for the administrator to 
automatically receive an email when someone reports a post. 
Moderators
The moderators menu is a fantastic tool especially if you have a large number of 
forums. It allows the assignment of individual moderators to a forum versus 
having one moderator for all forums. A good example of this in action is at the 
http://www.e107.org forums. If you view the individual forums and scroll down 
to the bottom of the page, you will see the moderator(s) of that forum. Moderators 
are forum administrators. For example they can block, move, or close threads. 
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 145 ]
Forum Moderators are assigned by selecting Moderators from the Forums Options 
menu. When the moderators screen appears you will be able to assign moderator 
levels for each forum. In this case, the default is Admin, which we assigned when we 
created the forums at the beginning of this chapter.
Tools
The Tools option comes in handy for large busy forums. Select the Tools option from 
the Forum Options menu. Its use is primarily to instruct e107 forums to recalculate 
forum last post information, number of posts/replies, and forum counts. You have 
the option to check all of these or any number of these items as well as select the 
forums on which you wish the operation performed. 
You are now finished installing and configuring the forum plugin. There are just a 
couple more things to cover, but before we do, let's take a moment to examine the 
differences that you can see when the forums are viewed from the end-user point of 
view at the various levels. To save space I am just going to show you the bottom part 
of the forum window. By default, you can access the forums by the main menu at the 
top of the screen in any mode.
Visitors to our site can only view the forums. They do not have the ability to 
make posts or participate in any way without first registering. If you look at 
the screenshot below, just to the right of the Search button you will see that 
the forums provide this information to the viewer.
•

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 146 ]
Registered users or members logging in would see a similar screen except 
the permissions statement to the right of the Search button has changed as 
shown below:
Administrators, having more responsibilities, also have more options 
available to them although you won't notice that from the screenshot below.
You will notice the difference in the forums itself. To show you what I mean, log in 
as a registered user and do the following:
Select Forums from the main menu.
Select the Miscellaneous Pet Topics forum.
Select the new thread button.
In the Subject field enter Test.
In the Post enter Can I make this a sticky?

We have not yet installed we plugin so the polls will skip this for now. We 
will install the poll plugin in the section that follows after this. 
We have no need to upload a file so we can skip this section.
Select Preview and double-check your spelling as a courtesy to those who are 
trying to read your post.
Make any necessary corrections and then press the Submit new 
thread button.
Now log out as registered user, log back in as administrator and do the following:
Select Forum from the top menu.
Select Miscellaneous Pet Topics.
Next to the Test thread you will see four colored administrator function icons 
as in the screenshot below. They are from left to right:
Delete thread: This deletes the thread.
Sticky thread: This makes the thread appear at the top of the 
forum.
Lock thread: This sometimes used when a thread has useful 
information but the responses have run their course. To keep 
more responses from being added the thread can be locked.
Move thread: This is used to move a thread from one forum 
to aother.

Go ahead and select the sticky icon. Once you click on the icon the screen refreshes 
and the word [Sticky] appears above Test. If you want to remove this property from 
the item select the sticky icon again and the thread will revert to a regular thread.
This is not all inclusive regarding the forum plugin but it should be enough of a 
primer so that you will be able to get started. For more information on the forum 
plugin make sure to check out both the forums at http://www.e107.org and the 
e107 Wiki at http://wiki.e107.org. 
The Poll Plugin
The Poll plugin is another core plugin. It is not only a fun way to garner 
participation on our site but a valuable tool in collecting information. You will see 
in this chapter and in Chapter 7 that it can be integrated into other plugins like the 
Forums Plugin and Content Management. Since this is a core plugin, which was 
loaded as part of the e107 upload, the installation is easy.
1.	 Log in as administrator.
2.	 Select the Plugin Manager from the main menu (top left) or by the Plugin 
Manager icon.
3.	 Scroll down to Poll and select Install.
4.	 Select Configure as shown below:

Chapter 6
[ 149 ]
Now we can configure our first poll. When you have clicked Configure a screen as 
shown in the screenshot on the next page appears.
•	
Poll Question: This field allows you to enter the poll question. We will 
enter, What Type of Pet Do You Own?.
•	 In the Options field enter the following:
Dog
Cat
Bird
Reptile
Other
•	
Allow multiple choices: This field will enable you to add multiple choices 
since some people might have different kinds of pets. We will select the 
Yes option.
•	
Show results: This field will enable you to display results when you want. 
We will select the after voting option. 
•	
Allowed to vote in poll: This field enables you to control who can vote. We 
will set this to Members.
•	
Vote storage method: We will use the last option User ID since only our 
members will be voting. If we were allowing anyone who comes to the 
website to vote then we would use the cookie method. A small cookie is 
placed in the user's browser when they place their first vote. This cookie will 
prevent them from repeatedly voting (or stacking the vote). 
•	
Allow people to post comments to poll?: This field enables you to allow 
people to post comments to the poll. We will select the yes option.
•	
Select the Preview button.

At the top of the screen you will see how your poll will look. If there are any 
mistakes, scroll down, and correct them. If there are no changes, select the 
Create Poll button at the bottom of the screen.
Now that the poll is created we need to make it visible. To do this we do the following:
Select Content then Menus from the main menu at the top left or the Menus 
icon from the administrative interface.
In Area 2 to the right, deactivate the blogcalendar and the clock menu items.
•

Under the Inactive Menus locate poll and activate it in Area 2.
Select Home from the site menu (top right part of the screen).
Your front page in the administrator's view should look as shown in the screenshot 
below. It will also appear similarly in the other views but the menu item will change 
appropriately. Just a little note before we move on to the next section: if you, or a 
member wanted to start a forum thread with a poll, they would now be able to check 
the box and create their forum poll.

Changing Themes for a More 
Professional Business Appearance 
But now that we have begun expanding our site with plugins the front page is 
starting to look a bit lopsided. This is because the Kubrick template was designed for 
minimalist blog sites, and not small business applications like we are getting into. So 
before we go any further, we are going to change the site theme. Before we proceed 
I want to apologize as this will seem rather autocratic with all the steps we are going 
to undertake but I want to get you through this quickly so we can move on with our 
plugins. By now you should be getting proficient at moving around the site. Let's 
change some of the graphics to the lamb theme.
1.	 Select Tools from the top menu.
2.	 Select Themes from the drop-down menu.
3.	 Locate the lamb theme and click on the Set As Site Theme button.

Chapter 6
[ 153 ]
4.	 Open your FTP client and connect to your site.
5.	 On your computer locate the file called lamb/logo.png from the unzipped 
folder that can be downloaded from the code downloads for this chapter.
6.	 On the server locate the directory /public_html/e107_themes/lamb/
images/ and rename the logo.png to logo_bk.png.
7.	 Upload the new logo.png file to the server.
8.	 Refresh your browser and you should now see the Cuddle Care logo in the 
upper-left corner of the site in place of the e107 website logo as shown in the 
screenshot below:

Customizing Your Site for Business with Plugins
[ 154 ]
You will also notice that both the Main Menu and the Welcome Administrator 
menu have moved to the left side of the screen while the Pet of the Month and the 
Poll have stayed on the right side of the screen. This is because Area 1 has moved to 
the left side while Area 2 is on the right side. Let's make a couple of quick cosmetic 
changes before installing more plugins:
1.	 Select Menus from the administrative interface.
2.	 Move Pet of the Month down below Poll.
3.	 Select Content | Customer Menus/Pages from the main menu at the top left.
4.	 Select the Edit icon available under the Options column for the title Pet of 
the Month.
5.	 Left-click on the picture of the dog and align it to the center position.	
6.	 Select Update Menu.
We will now move further to update the information in the welcome message. 
Additionally we will also insert some images in the message. Let's do the following: 
1.	 Select Content | Welcome Message.
2.	 Select the Edit icon for the Cuddle Care Welcome Message.
3.	 Select the existing text and set the font size to 4(14 pt).
4.	 Move the cursor to the right of the last text entry and click on your Enter key 
five times.
5.	 Open your FTP client and upload the map.png, phone.png, and fax.png files 
from the downloaded graphics file to /public_html/e107_images/custom/.
6.	 Insert the map.png and modify the setting Text flow to Left.
7.	 Set Margin Right to 20 px.

Chapter 6
[ 155 ]
8.	 Set Margin Top to 20 px and click the Save button. (See the screenshot below.) 
9.	 Now to the top-right corner of the map.png image select the text align right 
icon from the WYSIWYG editor.
10.	 Enter below the image the text Address: 3878 Austell Road, Austell GA 
[map] and press Enter.
11.	 Next insert the phone.png graphic, setting only the Margin Right to 10 px 
and Save.

[ 156 ]
12.	 Enter below the image the text Phone: 770-434-0311 and click Enter twice.
13.	  Insert the fax.png graphic, setting only the Margin Right to 10 px and Save.
14.	  Enter below the image the text Fax: 770-434-0312, click Enter twice, and enter 
the following information:
Our Hours 
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 8am to 3pm 
Saturdays 8am to 12pm 
Closed Wednesdays and Sundays 
15.	 Select Text Align Center and enter: We gladly accept walk-ins as well as 
appointments and always welcome new patients!
Now insert a map in the following manner:
1.	 Move to the Address section and select the word map.
2.	 Open up a browser tab or window and go to http://www.mapquest.com 
and enter the information in the street address, city, and state fields for 
Cuddle Care.
3.	 When the map appears, copy the URL (Browser address) from the 
address bar.
4.	 Now switch back to the browser window showing our website that has the 
word map highlighted. From the WSYIWYG editor select the link icon. It 
looks like a chain link. (See the screenshot above.)
5.	 Paste the URL you copied from Mapquest in the Link URL field.

Chapter 6
[ 157 ]
6.	 For Target select the Open Link in a New Window option from the 
drop-down menu.
7.	 For Title enter Link for directions to Cuddle Care.
8.	 Select the Update button.
When you select Home from the main menu your screen should look as 
shown below:
Summary
In this chapter we learned about user classes, what they are, how to assign them, 
and how to use them. We also learned how to set up forums using the forum plugin 
giving you a basic understanding of how information is entered, stored, organized, 
and presented. We learned how to configure the poll plugin so we can conduct polls 
not only to garner interest and participation in our site but also to gain valuable 
information that may help us market our products and services better. As our site 
began to grow with more business features we learned that we needed to adapt our 
theme to better accommodate all the new features and learned how to change default 
graphics with our own graphics.

Adding Content to e107
One of the things that all content management systems have in common is the ability 
to store, organize, and present large amounts of information. The factor that makes 
e107 unique is its ability to do this in a number of ways. However, since I conducted 
a little poll of my own, we have decided to concentrate our efforts on using a core 
e107 plugin called Content Management. In this chapter we also cover another core 
plugin called links.
Content Management Plugin
The Content Management plugin is a core plugin and is a very powerful and 
versatile plugin. Before we get started let's clear up a question that always seems 
to come up. Why does a content management system need a content management 
plugin? The plugin is simply named content management. It could have been called 
content organizer, site content manger, or any number of other names. The plugin is 
a module of programming code that stores and organizes content. The plugin does 
not have to be installed for e107 to manage content but, as you will see, this plugin is 
a very powerful system that makes managing content very easy. 
In the following parts of the chapter we are going to learn briefly the key features 
of the Content Management Plugin. In some parts the link to the corresponding 
section of the WIKI http://wiki.e107.org is provided for reference purposes. 
There is also additional information to be found in the e107 Forums at http://www.
e107.org. The powerful, versatile, and incomprehensible number of configurations 
available would take more pages than this entire book, so we will cover only a 
cursory use of the plugin and leave you to explore its versatility. 

Adding Content to e107
[ 160 ]
Key Features
Built-in Template System for Content Pages
The built-in template system allows an administrator to use an unlimited series of 
templates. It also allows an administrator to code any article to their liking. Since 
the templates are saved easily, they can also be referred to again using a drop-down 
menu in the fill-in area. More information regarding the template system can be 
found at http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_Management_Templates.
Preset and Custom Tag Capabilities 
The automation of certain elements of your content is made possible by preset and 
custom tags. You already learned a little about preset tags when you viewed the 
Menus option under the administrative interface. Some of the examples of preset 
tags are { site info }, { area 1 }, { area 2 }, { main menu }, and { footer }. 
The Custom tags can be assigned a value and are great for storing values that are 
repeated throughout content. For more information and a list of available tags see: 
http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_Management_PresetCustomTags. 
Menu System
When you install the CM plugin it incorporates Custom Menus/Pages into it so you 
are able to create menus linked to categories while controlling the different kinds of 
output. The menus have the capability of dynamically incorporating information on 
recent additions and too many other functions to cover in this limited space.
For more advanced users who need a greater degree of individualization, the 
menu system creates a PHP file, which can be modified. More information about 
the menu system can be found at http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_
Management_Options.
Advanced Sorting System
Another great feature of CM is the advanced sorting system. What makes it so 
great is that you can sort one category one way, a second category a different 
way, and just about any other combination you can think of. No longer are you 
stuck with just one way of sorting. More information on this can be found at 
http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_Management_Order.

Chapter 7
[ 161 ]
Personal Content Manager
Through assignment of user classes, which we learned about in Chapter 6, the 
Personal Content Manger feature allows all approved users to access, create, or 
edit content without the need for them to become system administrators. For 
more information on this feature see http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_
Management_Personal_Content_Manager. 
Options
There are so many options available under the options section that you may feel 
overwhelmed, strike that, you will feel overwhelmed. At this point even the WIKI 
has limited information but what it does have could fill up this chapter, so for more 
information go to http://wiki.e107.org/?title=Content_Management_Options. 
Installation and Configuration
As the Content Management plugin is a core plugin, it is already available for 
activation. Log in as administrator, select either the Plugins Manager icon or from 
the top-left menu select Plugins | Plugin Manager, locate Content Management 
and click on the Install button. You will see a Plugin successfully installed message 
once the plugin is successfully installed. Click on the Configure link and you will 
then be presented with the Content Management configuration screen that looks as 
shown in the screenshot below:

Adding Content to e107
[ 162 ]
You will notice that the screen is divided into three sections:
The left side provides a brief explanation of the screen being shown. This 
corresponds with the selection of the menu item on the right side of the 
screen.
In the center of this screen, you will see a drop-down menu with the 
following choices:
content
article
review
On the right side there is a menu that contains the various 
configuration templates.
Before we go any further, let's stop for a moment. If you have a small site and will 
have only a few articles like we will have at Cuddle Care the layout is pretty simple. 
We can use the same categories and sub-categories that we used for the forums in the 
previous chapter. Cuddle Care has no need for various authors or administrators so 
the setup is very easy.
But say for instance, our publisher wanted to use the content management plugin, 
we would need to sit down and plan out the various categories, sub-categories, 
who has access, who can edit, who can approve, and who can delete. For very small 
organizations this might be done on a piece of paper but for a large organization or 
an organization where there will be lots of content, a program such as Microsoft's 
Visio might be preferable. There is a great primer at http://wiki.e107.org/
?title=HOWTO:Get_Started_With_the_Content_Management_Plugin on this 
subject that I will defer to as we can only touch briefly on this plugin.
Creating a New Category
If we are going to use the same categories and sub-categories as we did for our 
forum, then we first need to create our categories. The only difference between 
Content Management and forums is that we do not need to create an empty 
container first, except for Dogs and Puppies which we will name Canines, and Cats 
and Kittens which we will name Feline. So let's create our main categories first:
Select Create Category from the Options menu on the right side of 
the screen.
heading: This will allow you to enter the heading for the category. We will 
enter Birds.
•
•

subheading: This will allow you to enter the sub-heading for the category. 
We will enter Information about Birds.
Skip down to icon and select the view icons button. Select the icon with the 
name ledlightgreen.png.
comments: This when enabled will allow you to display comments. We will 
select the enabled option.
rating: This when enabled will allow you to display rating. We will select the 
enabled option.
print email/icons: This when enabled will allow you to print email or icons. 
We will select the enabled option.
visibility: We will leave this set to Everyone (public).
Select the submit button.
Repeat the above procedure for the following:
Fish
Reptiles
Other Animals
Now we have to create containers for both the Canines and the 
Feline categories.
heading: We will enter Canines.
subheading: We will enter Information about Dogs 
and Puppies.
Skip down to icon and select the view icons button. Select the 
second icon, which is the red icon ledred.png.
comments: We will select the disabled option.
rating: We will select the disabled option.
print email/icons: We will select the disabled option.
visibility: We will leave this setting to Everyone (public).

Now we create our sub-categories for Dogs and Puppies by doing the 
following from the Create Category:

shown in the screenshot in the next page. A new screen will 
appear enter information as follows:
heading: We will enter Puppies.
subheading: We will enter Information about puppies.
Skip down to icon and select the view icons button. Select the 
first icon which is the ledlightgreen.png.

When you are done, select Manage Category from the options menu and your screen 
should show your categories and sub-categories as shown below. You may also 
notice that these categories and sub-categories are also shown on the right side in the 
Options menu column.

Chapter 7
[ 167 ]
Changing the Order of Categories
We have created our categories and sub-categories but we would like to present 
them in a different order then the one in which we entered them. Not a problem! 
From the options menu select Order and a screen as shown below appears:

Adding Content to e107
[ 168 ]
We are going to move the original three categories to the bottom of the list and 
change the order of our categories to alphabetical. This is done by changing the 
numbers in the drop-down list in the order column. For our purposes, the order we 
assign from top to bottom is: 7, 8, 9, 1, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, and 1. When you have 
made these changes, select the update order button and your screen will look as 
shown opposite:

[ 170 ]
For those of you who haven't thought of it when you 
were creating the categories. If you haven't see the 
possibilities just yet, you could have a site with content for 
the customers, suppliers, sales and management simply 
by creating user groups and assigning user groups to 
particular categories and sub-categories.
Managing Categories
From time to time you will need to delete or edit your categories. If we didn't have 
the ability to do this then it would not be much of a content manager. These are very 
simple operations.

Chapter 7
[ 171 ]
Deleting a Category
Deleting a category is a simple procedure. You can select Manage Category from 
the Options menu, locate the category you wish to delete, and click on the delete 
icon. A warning will pop up on your screen alerting you to the fact that only empty 
categories can be deleted. If the category was empty, you would click the OK button. 
If the category contained content, the content would either have to be moved to a 
different category or deleted before proceeding.
Editing a Category
To edit a category, select Manage Categories from the Options menu, locate the 
category you wish to edit, and click on the edit icon. The edit screen will appear. 
Make any necessary changes and finish by selecting the update button. 
Creating Content 
Creating content is very similar to creating categories. We are going to create some 
test articles so you can see how this works. Select the Create Content option from the 
Options menu. When the content screen appears do the following:
category: Select Puppies from the drop-down menu and wait for the screen 
to refresh.
heading: We will enter Test.
subheading: We will enter Test.
summary: We will enter Test.
text: We will enter Test.
author details: Leave as default (but if you are reprinting an article you 
would change this to the appropriate information).
start date: If you want the content to appear right away skip over this option. 
Optionally you can prepare your content in advance and specify a start date, 
which comes in handy for holiday information, special sales, or information 
that is only applicable during a certain time of the year.
end date: If you want the content to appear indefinitely, skip over this

comments: If you want people to be able to comment about the content you 
would enable this option. It is disabled by default.

Now select the preview button and check your entries. (It is always a good practice 
to use this button before actually creating content.) Make any necessary changes 
and when you are satisfied that the information is correct, select the create content 
item button.
Now create some random content and don't be afraid to experiment with the 
different options. You can enter as much information as is necessary to satisfy your 
curiosity about different features. 
Managing Content
I created two test pieces of content under Puppies and I want to edit the title of one 
of the articles. There are two ways we can access the screen to manage our content. 
The quickest way is to look down the Options menu and click on Puppies.
The second way is to select the Manage Content option from the Options 
menu and select Puppies from the drop-down menu.
You will then be taken to a list of existing content articles. You will notice some 
buttons right under the word first letters (locate the cursor in the screenshot below). 
These letters correspond to the first letter of the content heading.

If you select the letter P button the screen would filter the articles and display only 
the ones that start with the letter P as shown below. To view all of the content again 
you would select the all button.
Deleting Content
Deleting content is a simple procedure. Select the Manage Content option from the 
Options menu, locate the content you wish to delete, and click on the delete icon. A 
warning will pop up on your screen confirming the delete process as shown in the 
screenshot below. Select OK.
Editing Content
To edit a content item, select the Manage Content option from the Options menu, 
locate the content you wish to edit, and click on the edit icon. The edit screen will 
appear. Make any necessary changes and finish by selecting the update content 
item button.

will vary depending upon how many test items you created but you can see 
the differences.

We haven't even begun to show you the real power of this plugin. This is only the 
most basic function. The true power of this plugin is in its templating system. Take 
some time and get to know e107, getting familiar with its various functions, and when 
you feel like spreading your wings make your first stop by searching the How To: Get 
Started With the Content Management Plugin topic at http://wiki.e107.org. 
PDF Creation Plugin
The PDF (Portable Document Format) creation plugin allows your users to save 
articles and pages of your website in PDF Format. In the simplest terms, a PDF 
document is saved or printed exactly as it appears on your screen. If you would like 
to learn more about PDF documents you can go to http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Portable_Document_Format. To use the PDF plugin we need to do 
the following:
From the administrative interface select Plugin Manager.
Locate the PDF plugin and select the Install button. 
Click on the Configure link under the successfully installed message.
Select the settings that you desire. Usually the default settings are what you 
will want to use (see the screenshot below).
Select the update button.

will now notice the PDF icon next to the email and print icons as shown in the 
screenshot below:
The Coppermine Plugin
They say a picture is worth a thousand words and that is definitely true when 
it comes to animals. Our website will include ample of pictures of animals, and 
to accommodate them we require a powerful gallery plugin. A quick trip to 
http://www.e107coders.org and you can see there are several plugins from which 
to choose. If you are going to have a large number of photographs, I definitely 
recommend the Coppermine Image-Gallery plugin, which is a non-core plugin 
adapted from another open-source program called Coppermine Photo Gallery 
http://coppermine-gallery.net/. 
Installing the Coppermine Plugin
If you have not done so yet, download the most recent Coppermine plugin from the 
http://www.e107coders.org site and unzip the plugin. Locate the folder called 
docs and you will see a README.html and a PDF file called manual. The readme 
document contains a brief overview on installation, setup, and known security 
issues. The manual is in Portable Document Format so you will need to have a 
program like Adobe Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/) 
to view the file. I strongly suggest that you view it.
Like all plugins you have the option of using the plugin upload method from the 
Plugins Manager or expanding the files on your computer and then uploading the 
folder called coppermine_menu to the /public_html/e107_plugins/ directory.

From the administrator toolbar select Plugin | Plugin Manager or from the 
administrative interface select the Plugin Manager icon. Browse the list of 
uninstalled plugins until you see Coppermine. Click on the Install button. When 
completed you will see a screen that looks like the screenshot below:
IMPORTANT—Make sure you follow these steps!
Down at the bottom of the screen you will see the following 
notice:
Please go to the coppermine admin 'config' area and fix 
any errors that are seen.
 Also:
* Edit your coppermine 'groups' area as needed, 
* Make sure that you create at least one album or you 
won't be able to do anything :)
* Give users ('visitors') appropriate permission to upload 
to albums. 
I can tell you from looking at the support requests that 
failure to following those steps will cause you many hours 
of frustration trying to figure out why things will not work.
Click on the Configure link.

Coppermine Configuration
The first thing you need to do is to select the Coppermine Config option from the 
CPG Config menu on the right side of your screen. Upon selection, you will see an 
error page but don't panic! It is alerting you that in order to use the plugin, you will 
have to change the permissions (CHMOD) on some folders contained within the 
plugin, just as we did in back in Chapter 2. 
Always change the folders as per the instructions that are show on your installation 
screen. It will look similar to the screen below, which is showing version 1.35C, the 
latest version at the time of publication. Make the following changes:
The ../../e107_plugins/coppermine_menu/albums directory (located in 
the directory where you uploaded Coppermine) should be writable in order 
to allow uploading pictures. Use your FTP client to change its permissions 
to 777.
The ../../e107_plugins/coppermine_menu/albums/userpics directory 
(the userpics folder is located in the albums directory on your server) 
should be writable in order to allow uploading pictures. Use your FTP client 
to change its mode to 777.
The ../../e107_plugins/coppermine_menu/albums/edit directory (the 
edit folder is located in the albums directory on your server) should be 
writable in order to allow uploading pictures. Use your FTP client to change 
its mode to 777.

Once you have changed the folder permissions, return to your browser, and refresh 
it. Your screen will now show the actual configuration screen below.
Under the section called Admin Menu select, the Admin Tools button. 
Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and select the Update Database 
(1) link.
On the next screen, you will be presented with a list of the tables that were 
checked and updated. If you see any error messages and do not understand 
them, go to the forums at http://www.e107coders.org and search on 
the error message. If everything is OK you will see a status message at the 
bottom of the page intimating to you that the Coppermine is updated and 
ready to roll.

General Settings
The f﻿irst four entries are automatically configured from information contained in the 
e107 database. Let's enter the following settings:
Gallery name: This will allow us to enter the name of our gallery. We will 
leave this setting as Cuddle Care Animal Hospital Gallery. 
Gallery description: You can provide a brief description of the images 
contained in the gallery. Change Your online photo album to Images of our

Gallery administrator email: Enter the email address for the gallery 
administrator. Leave this set to admin@cuddlecare.biz.
Target address for the "See more pictures" link in e-cards: When someone 
sends an e-card, it also sends a link for the recipient to come to our website 
and view more pictures. This is the default location where these images are 
located. It only needs to be changed if you change the location where images 
are stored. We will leave the default path.
Gallery is offline: If you set this option to Yes, the gallery will be taken 
offline and not viewable. You would use this function when performing 
maintenance. Leave this option set to No.
Log ecards: This function gathers statistics on e-card usage. Set this option 
to Yes.
Allow ZIP-download of favorites: If downloads are allowed then having 
this option set to Yes will allow the users to download their favorites in a ZIP

Language, Themes & Charset Settings
With the exception of a couple of settings, this section is self-explanatory.
Language: You can change the language for the gallery as with e107 by 
setting the default language. You must have the language files already 
installed in e107 for this option to function. If you have UTF-8 (Unicode 
encoded) language files installed and a user views your site, the script will 
auto detect the language from the browser and display it automatically. 
Leave the default setting of English.
Theme: Allows you to change themes. Usually you will want your gallery to 
look like the rest of your site so leave this set to E107.
Display language list: This allows the languages to be displayed in the 
drop‑down list that the user will see. Set this to Yes.
Display language flags: If available this will allow the display of language 
icons. Leave this set to No.
Display "reset" in language selection: This allows users to reset back to their 
own language if they should accidentally select a different language. Leave 
this set to Yes.
Display theme list: If you have installed optional Coppermine themes and 
wish your users to be able to select them then you would set this to yes. 
Leave this set to No.
Display FAQ: This shows a FAQ link in the user's Coppermine menu 
bar that will display a list of frequently asked questions on how to use 
Coppermine. The default setting is No; we will change this to Yes.

Album List View 
In this section we can configure how our albums are viewed.
The settings are:
Width of the main table (pixels or %): As the name implies, this controls the 
width of the main table that is displayed within your e107 theme. You can 
set this as an absolute number of pixels in width or a percentage of the main 
window. For our purposes we will set it to 100%.
Number of levels of categories to display: This controls the number of 
category levels displayed. The default is 2 which would be the main category 
level plus one sub-category. Leave the default level of 2.

page. Leave the default setting of 12.
Number of columns for the album list: Leave the default setting of 2.
Size of thumbnails in pixels: This sets the size of the thumbnails to be 
displayed for each album, the default is 50. This means the thumbnails will 
be 50 pixels high by 50 pixels wide.
The content of the main page: This allows you to change the content 
displayed on the main page. The default is breadcrumb/catlist/alblist/
random,2/lastup,2 . The variables that can be changed are the category list 
(catlist) and album list (alblist). It is recommended that you do not change 
this unless you know what you are doing. Leave the default setting.
Show first level album thumbnails in categories: This setting allows you to 
choose whether to display thumbnails from the first album of the categories 
listed on the default gallery entry page. Set to Yes.
Thumbnail View
As the name implies, this controls how thumbnail views are displayed.
Let's make the following settings:
Number of columns on thumbnail page: This is the number of thumbnails 
that will display in each row. The default is 4 columns (four across). Leave

Maximum number of tabs to display: Tabs are displayed at the bottom of 
the page when the number of thumbnails is spread across numerous pages. 
The value sets how many tabs are displayed. The default is 12 but you 
can use the drop-down menu to select values from 5 to 25. Leave the 
default setting. 
Display file caption (in addition to tile) below the thumbnail: Controls the 
display of the file caption below each thumbnail while the user is in (user) 
view. The default is Yes. Leave the default setting.
Display number of views below the thumbnail: When this is set to Yes, the 
program will display the number of times the thumbnail has been selected. 
Leave the default setting of Yes.
Display number of comments below the thumbnail: Shows the number of 
comments displayed for each thumbnail. Set to No.

Image View & Comment Settings
This controls the image view and comment settings.
Let's make the following settings:
Width of the table for file display (pixels or %): This sets the width for 
the table that will display the intermediate picture. If you set the width in 
pixels and the picture is larger that the table width you specified, it will 
automatically expand the set limits. Leave this set to 600.
File information is visible by default: With this setting you can allow/
disallow the file information block that appears below the intermediate 
image. Leave the default setting of No.
Filter bad words in comments: This is self explanatory. The default setting is 
No; set this to Yes.
Allow smiles in comments: If set to the default setting of Yes our users will 
be able to add emoticons in comments.
Allow several consecutive comments on one file from the same user 
(disable flood protection): The default setting is No. If you set it to Yes, you 
will disable the flood protection, which could allow abuse of your album.
Max length for an image description: This is the maximum number of 
characters that can be entered to describe and image. The default is 512. 
Leave this setting.

Max number of characters in a word: This setting prevents someone from 
breaking the layout of your gallery by posting lengthy comments without 
using spaces between words. Any characters over the number specified will 
automatically be censored. Leave this with default setting 38.
Max number of lines in a comment: This will keep users from entering 
too many new line entries <enter key> in the comments. Leave the default 
setting of 10. 
Show film strip: Displays a filmstrip simulation showing previous and 
following thumbnails from the presently selected image. The default is set 
to Yes.
Number of items in filmstrip: Set the number of thumbnails you wish 
displayed in the film strip. Leave the default setting of 5.
Notify admin of comments by email: This allows the admin to receive an 
email each time a comment is posted. The default setting is No. Change 
to Yes.
Slideshow interval in milliseconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds): 
This controls the length of time between images when viewing using the 
slideshow option. Decreasing the value shortens the interval and increasing 
it lengthens it. Leave the default value of 5000.
You would be wise to filter for bad words and limit 
consecutive posts by the same user, with the program 
sending you notification whenever you let someone upload 
to your website.

Let's make the following settings:
Quality for JPEG files: This is the value that controls compression when a 
utility makes a thumbnail. The default value is 80. Do not change this value 
unless you really know what you are doing.
Max dimension of a thumbnail**: This specifies the maximum number of 
pixels based on Use Dimension (below). The default setting is 100. Leave 
this setting.
Use dimension (width or height or Max aspect for thumbnail) **: Based on 
your entry in Max Dimension above, set if the thumbnail is created by height 
or width. With Max Aspect the program will decide based upon the type of 
image which way to create the thumbnail. Leave this set to Max Aspect.
Create intermediate pictures: When this is set to Yes, whenever you upload 
a file, the script creates both a thumbnail of the file (file name using "thumb_" 
as its prefix) and an intermediate version of the file (file name using "normal_
" as its prefix). Leave the default setting of Yes.
Max width or height of an intermediate picture/video**: When someone 
clicks on a thumbnail the intermediate picture will display the specified size 
window. The default is 400 pixels. This means the display window would be 
400 x 400 pixels.
Maximum size of uploaded files (KB): This specifies the maximum number 
of kilobytes that a file size can be. Leave the default setting 1024.
Max width or height for uploaded pictures/videos (pixels): This sets the 
maximum number of pixels with which a picture can be displayed. The 
default is 2048 pixels. 
(**) When changing this setting, only the files that are 
added from that point on are affected, so it is advisable that 
this setting should not be changed if there are already files 
in the gallery. You can, however, apply the changes to the 
existing files with the admin tools (resize pictures) utility 
from the admin menu.

Files and Thumbnails Advanced Settings
This section requires you to know a little about the utilities that are available with 
your hosting account package: 
Show private album Icon to unlogged user: By default this is set to No, 
which means when a visitor views the gallery, private albums are completely 
hidden. If you set this to Yes, the album name, description, and statistics are 
shown, but not the thumbnails or any of the contained files.
Characters forbidden in filenames: The program will replace with an 
underscore any of the characters specified here that is found in the name of 
an uploaded file. Don't change unless you know what you are doing. The 
default is $/\:*?"'<>|`.

Allowed image types: Allows image file types that your installed image 
library (GD or ImageMagick) is capable of handling and will be allowed as 
uploads and content in your gallery. You can restrict this to certain file types 
by entering a slash-separated list of extensions (e.g. jpg/bmp/tif). Leave the 
setting as ALL.
Allowed movie types: Allows movie file types to be uploaded. If you want 
to restrict the allowable file types to certain extensions you would enter a 
slash‑separated list of extensions (e.g. wmv/avi/mov/asf). It is important 
to note that being able to display these files requires that the person 
downloading the movie have the necessary programs and codecs installed 
on their computers (e.g. if you allow the file type asf, the user who wishes 
to view the file needs to have a program like Windows Media Player that has 
the necessary codec to allow viewing. Leave the default setting of ALL.
Allowed audio types: Allows audio files to be uploaded, If you want to 
restrict the allowable file types to certain extension you would enter a slash-
separated list of extensions (e.g. wma/wav/mp3). It is important to note that 
being able to listen to these files requires that the person downloading the 
files have the necessary program with installed codecs on their computer. 
Leave the default setting of ALL.
Allowed document types: Allow document types to be uploaded. If you want 
to restrict files types to certain extensions, you would enter a slash-separated 
list of extension (e.g. pdf/txt). It is important to note that being able to view 
document types will depend upon the viewer having the necessary program 
installed to view the document. SECURITY RISK! – Allowing file types 
that can contain code is a major security risk. The default setting is 
ALL – Set this to NONE.

Read EXIF data in JPEG files: Turned on, the script will read the EXIF 
(Exchangeable Image File Format) data stored by digicams in JPEG files. 
Leave Yes, which is the default setting. 
Read IPTC data in JPEG files: Turned on, the script will read IPTC 
(International Press Telecommunications Council) data stored in digicams 
and picture files. Leave the default set to No.
The album directory*: This is the base directory where images are stored. 
The path is relative to the main directory of the script. If you want to change 
the path where files are stored, they must be in the visible web-server 
directory and use the format ../ to move-up one level in the directory tree. 
Absolute paths (/var/my_images/) will not work. Do not change this setting 
if your database already contains files, otherwise all references to your 
existing files will break. Leave the default setting of /albums.
The Directory for user files*: A subdirectory of the base directory, this is 
the directory where files are stored using the web interface (URL/URI). It's 
recommended that you leave this setting as it is. If you decide to change it, 
keep in mind that the folder must exist within the album's folder and the 
path should be relative to it. When you upload files by FTP, store them in a 
subdirectory (folder) of the "album directory" and not inside the "directory 
for user files". Do not change this setting if your database already contains 
f﻿iles, otherwise all references to your existing files will break. Leave the 
default setting of userpics/. 
The prefix for intermediate pictures*: This is a prefix assigned to all 
intermediate pictures. The default is normal_. If you want to change this you 
need to do it before any pictures are loaded into the database.
The prefix for thumbnails*: This is a prefix assigned to all thumbnail 
pictures. The default is thumb_. If you want to change this you need to do it 
before any pictures are uploaded.
Default mode for directories: The default is 0777. Do not change this setting. 
If you are having problems, refer to the Coppermine documentation.
Default mode for files: the default is 0666. This is the permissions level the 
program assigns to an uploaded file. It should not be changed.

messages that are usually suppressed and is helpful in trying 
to find the source of a problem. Leave the default setting 
of No.

Image Watermarking
Image watermarking allows you to place a watermark (identifying mark or logo) on 
photos uploaded to your galleries. Its primary purpose is to thwart individuals from 
stealing your images. Due to the nature of the web browsers, this will only stop only 
the most inexperienced user. We will keep the default settings above.
If you wish to use this plugin, go to the folder on your computer where you 
expanded the downloaded Coppermine plugin. In the root directory there is a 
Readme.txt file and associated MySQL tables. Just follow the instruction in the 
Readme.txt, set your settings (see the above image), and you are set to go.
If your images are of your business and you want to use e107 with the Coppermine 
plugin then you can consider trackable digital watermarking through a company 
such as Digimarc http://www.digimarc.com/tech/. 
Saving Configuration
The last thing we need to do is to save all the configurations that we made above. 
Just under the watermark section you will see a couple of warning notices At this 
point you are given two options:
Save new configuration: Select this button to commit the changes. We will be 
selecting this button.

Restore factory defaults: If you make configuration changes and then want 
to discard them and start from the beginning you can click on the Restore 
factory defaults button.
 
Admin Mode and User Mode
While you are logged in as an admin in e107 and access the Coppermine photo 
gallery, you have access to two modes of operation: user mode and admin mode. 
This is very convenient since you can operate as either the end user or administrator 
without having to open multiple browsers. Switch to user mode and then switch 
back to admin mode so you can see the difference. The following screenshot 
shows the difference in how the screen would look if you logged out of e107 as 
administrator and then selected the Gallery as a visitor. In the top half of the 
screenshot you see the two menus whereas in the bottom of the figure you see the 
menu as an end user only.

The Group Control Panel
You can access the Group Control Panel by clicking on Groups in the Admin Menu. 
This is where you control permissions for Coppermine. For the purposes of Cuddle 
Care please set the controls as follows:
Administrators: 0, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES
Registered: 0, NO, YES.YES, YES, NO, YES, NO (note: Later when we allow 
users to upload the 0 will automatically change to 1024)
Anonymous: 0, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO
Banned: 0, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO
LAN_MYUSERCLASS: 0, NO, YES. YES, YES, NO, YES, NO 
Make sure to select the Apply modifications button at the bottom of the screen.
If you are curious about what each of these functions does, I suggest that you read 
the Coppermine manual, located at http://www.yoursite.com/docs/manual.pdf 
(assuming your e107 installation is in the root directory). 
Categories, Albums, and Pictures
Right now, I know we are walking through the samples in the book together, but 
when you strike out on your own, you will take some time to plan how you wish 
to categorize the photo galleries. Remember the five P's: prior planning prevents 
poor performance. 
Things will go smoothly if you remember the following:
Categories are the main container for information.
Categories can optionally be broken into sub-categories (also called 
nested categories).
Albums are organized and stored in categories or sub-categories if present.
Images are stored in albums.

You can view a visual representation of this below:
Creating Categories
Now that we know how everything works, we will create our categories. Select 
Categories from the Admin Menu. You will see the User galleries category; 
Coppermine created this category automatically when we selected to allow 
user-submitted photos during the configuration phase above. We want to create 
our parent categories so do the following: 
Scroll down to the Update Create/Category block.
In the Category Title box enter Our Clients.
For Description enter Images of our clientele.
Select the Update/Create category button at the bottom.
Repeating the steps above create categories for the following and for now just use the 
category title name as the description:
Special Events
Missing
Adoption

[ 200 ]
Creating Sub-Categories
We need to create a couple of sub-categories. This is similar to creating a category 
with one exception.
Scroll down to the Update/Create Category block.
Using the scroll bar, select the Parent Category Our Clients.
In the Category Title box enter the following sub-category title: 
Adult Clients.
For Description enter Images of our Adult Clients.
Select the Update/Create Category button at the bottom.
Repeat the step above in the same Parent Category and create the sub-
category Newborns.
For Description enter Images of our Newborns.
Select the Update/Create Category button at the bottom.
Creating Albums
Now that we have set up our categories and sub-categories, we will create the 
albums, which will contain our images. Creating albums is different from creating 
categories. To create an album, do the following:
Select Albums from the Admin Menu.
From the drop-down menu select Our Clients.
Click on the New button. You will see New album appear in the main block. 
You will also notice that New album is also in the box just under the New 
and Delete buttons.
In that input area at the bottom, replace New Album with, Remembrances.
Click on the Apply modifications button.
A pop-up confirmation window will appear asking, Are you sure you wish 
to make these modifications? Select OK.
You will then see a box on the screen (see screenshot opposite) confirming that 
Album Manager is creating the album Remembrances. Select CONTINUE. 
Using the same procedures as above, create albums under each of the 
following categories using the category title as the name of the album

The only thing left to do is to upload your photos. This you can accomplish by using 
the file upload feature. We upload the files to a general area and once uploaded we 
place them into their respective albums. The process is self-explanatory.
Block (Menu) Configuration
Block (menu) configuration is for placing information on the main page of your 
template. Cuddle Care would like to display a random image and a drop-down 
photo category menu. Before we can activate the block, we have to configure it to 
display our information. To do this we need to follow these steps:
From the main Coppermine Menu select Block (menu) Config.
Adjust the entries to mirror those in the screenshot below:
Select the Save Settings button.

Chapter 7
[ 203 ]
Now that we have configured the Block Menu, we need to make it visible. Click on 
Main in the top administrator menu bar. Select Menus and follow these steps:
On the right side of your screen, deactivate all of the block menus except for 
banners in Area 4. 
Move the banner block menu to Area 5.
Find and select the Coppermine Block Menu under the Inactive Menus and 
assign it to Area 4.
You have now activated the Coppermine Block Menu, which now displays a random 
image from your files. 
Congratulations, you are done with Coppermine configuration!
Summary
In this chapter we have covered how to install and configure the Content 
Management plugin and provided a brief overview of this highly flexible and 
powerful tool. We also installed the PDF (Portable Documents Format) plugin 
to enable our users to download copies of our articles, etc. and maintain their 
original formatting. And last, we covered how to install and configure the non-core 
Coppermine Photo Gallery Plugin and learned to create our first gallery and album.

Information Dissemination
In this chapter we will look at disseminating information using different methods 
such as newsletters, calendars, and RSS feeds. We will also learn a little bit about 
search engines and various methods we can use to get our e107 site noticed.
The Newsletter Plugin
Newsletters are a great way to communicate information about you and your 
business or topics of interest. From a marketing standpoint, newsletters provide you 
with a rich database of individuals and/or companies that have expressed an interest 
to the topic of your newsletter.
Installation
To use this fantastic feature you need not look any further than your core plugins. 
Log in as administrator and select Plugins | Plugin Manager from the administrator 
toolbar or select the Plugin Manager icon from the administrative interface. Next 
locate the Newsletter plugin and click on the Install button. When the plugin is 
installed, click on the Configure link and your screen will look as shown below. On 
the right side of your screen you will see the Newsletter Options menu.

Information Dissemination
[ 206 ]
Configuration 
We will select the Create Newsletter option from the Newsletter Options menu to 
create a newsletter. This will bring you to the Create Newsletter screen. Actually 
this screen can be a little misleading to the uninitiated. The best way to explain what 
we are going to do is imagine this screen as bucket called Dog Fancy Monthly. 
In creating this newsletter we assign the title and provide a description of the 
newsletter that people will actually be able to read, so make it a good description. 
And we have a place for a header and a footer that will be common to all of our 
future issues. You will see what I'm talking about in a minute but for now let's put 
the following information into our waiting screen:
Title: We will enter the title of the newsletter as Dog Fancy Monthly.
Description: We will enter the description for the newsletter as: Each month 
is packed full of information on living, playing, and sharing life with your 
man's best friend. 
Header: We will enter the header of the newsletter as Dog Fancy Monthly.
Footer: We will enter the footer of the newsletter as Copyright 2007, Cuddle 
Care Animal Hospital.
Your screen should now look as shown below: 
•

Chapter 8
[ 207 ]
Now click on the Create Newsletter button and you have created your newsletter. 
Next, click on Newsletter Front Page from the Newsletter Options menu. You will 
see your first newsletter listed under the heading Existing Newsletters.
Creating Our First Mailing 
Now that we have created the newsletter, it is time to create our first edition. 
Continuing the analogy that we started above, we are now going to create our water 
drops (newsletter editions), which will then be contained within the bucket. So let's 
quickly do this together. Click on the Create mailing option from the Newsletter 
Options menu and fill in the following:
Newsletter: We will choose the Dog Fancy Monthly option from the 
drop‑down menu.
Subject/Title: We will enter the subject as Tough Love.
Issue Number: We will enter the issue number as Jan 2007.
Text: We will enter the text as: This is the first edition of my newsletter.
Your screen should look as shown below:

Information Dissemination
[ 208 ]
Now click on the Create Mailing button. This will bring you to the newsletter front 
page as shown in the screenshot below, which will now show the Jan 2007 issue 
under the newsletter. You will also notice that there is a status message to the right 
of the Subject/Title. It is alerting you to the fact that you have not yet mailed the 
newsletter. To send out the mail you can click on the Not sent out click to send 
button. But wait! How and where does someone subscribe to the newsletter? 
How to Subscribe to the Newsletter
We have to create the ability for our subscribers to sign up for our newsletter. To do 
this we need to click on Content | Menus or from the administrative screen click on 
the Menus icon and do the following:
Scroll down the list of Inactive Menus and locate Newsletters and select it.
Next click on the Activate in Area 1 button as shown below:
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 209 ]
You will then see the Newsletter menu appear in Area 1 under the login menu. Now 
open up a new browser window and select Home from the main menu on the top 
right. It will look as shown in the screenshot below. Now people will be able to see 
the subscription button and subscribe to your newsletter.
Event Calendar Plugin
Another way to disseminate information is via the use of the Event Calendar plugin. 
This is another core plugin that is easily installed. Cuddle Care is going to use the 
events calendar to show days when the office will be closed.
Installation
Go to the Plugins section in the administrative interface and select the Plugin 
Manager icon or select Plugin | Plugin Manager from the administrator toolbar. 
Locate the Event Calendar plugin and select the Install button.
Once the plugin is installed, click on the readme.pdf link, which shows important 
information about the plugin. If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions 
for e107 functions and core plugins, go to http://e107.org.

Configuring Calendar Settings
The Calendar can be configured by clicking the Configure link under the Plugin 
Successfully Installed message. You can also configure it by selecting from the 
Plugins section in the administrative interface. As you can see in the screenshot on 
the next page, the configuration screen is pretty much self explanatory. This is a 
simple configuration so let's complete the Calendar Settings together quickly:

Categories
Now select categories from the options menu. In order for us to add events we must 
first specify categories. Cuddle Care would like to display in its events calendar 
the days of the week that it is closed. In order for us to do this we need to create 
a category called Closed. To do this first select the Categories option from the 
Calendar menu on the right side of the screen and do the following:
In the Action block select: New.
Select the Proceed button.
On the next screen enter the following:

This plugin is very versatile and with a little imagination can be a valuable and 
powerful business tool. As with all of the e107 program and core plugins, you can 
find additional information in the forums at http://www.e107.org or in the WIKI at 
http://wiki.e107.org. 
RSS Plugin
RSS is an abbreviation for Really Simple Syndication. Its basic function is to 
distribute frequently updated digital content. This information is disseminated 
via a feed, which can then be subscribed and viewed by means of a program called 
an aggregator. Over the years since RSS was first introduced, it has become 
increasingly popular. So much so that many of the newer web browsers have 
the aggregator built into them. You can find additional information about RSS at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS(file_format).
Now some of you may have remembered when we first installed e107 and viewed 
our front page that the RSS menu was active and we deactivated it. We are going to 
go back and reactivate that menu item in a minute but first we want to install the RSS 
plugin from our core plugins.
Installation
Select Plugins | Plugin Manager from the administrator toolbar or the Plugin 
Manager icon from the administrative interface. Now install the RSS plugin. Select 
configure and you will see a screen as shown below:

[ 221 ]
Existing RSS Feeds
You notice there are existing feeds. These are already active, when installing the 
plugin, as a default set. If we clicked on the edit icon for news and entered 1 under 
the Topic id and selected the Update button then the screen will now look as 
shown below:
Import
We are not limited to these existing topics. We can select Import from the RSS 
Options menu to import additional feed items. Let's select a couple of feed items. 
Click on the Import option.
Select the checkboxes with following names in the Name field:

Your screen after selecting the checkboxes will look as shown above. Select 
the import ticked links button, which will navigate you to the Listing screen 
automatically. You will notice that there are hyperlinks for Id, Name, Path, Url, 
and Limit. By clicking on these hyperlinks you can change the order of display. For 
example, if you click on the Name link the listing will be sorted by name, etc.

Chapter 8
[ 223 ]
If you click on any of the items under the Url category you will be taken to the RSS 
Feeds screen as shown below:
The buttons in the Feed Links column to the right represent various RSS aggregator 
formats. If for instance, you are using the Mozilla Firefox browser and selected the 
RSS 1 button next to Calendar you will see a screen as shown below. To subscribe to 
the feed you can select the Subscribe Now button.

[ 224 ]
Activating RSS on the Front End
Now that we have finished configuring our feeds, we need to make it possible for 
our users to subscribe to the feeds. This is accomplished by activating the RSS Menu. 
From the administrative screen select the Menus icon or from the administrator 
toolbar select Content | Menus and do the following:
Locate rss from the inactive menus list and select it.
Select the Activate in Area 1 button.
Now open up a new browser window and view our front page. It will now show the 
RSS menu in the lower-left side of the screen as shown below:

Search Engines
In the past to rate their site high in the search engines, site owners used a 
combination of the site description and meta tag keywords. However, some site 
owners used keywords that had nothing to do with their site's content to draw traffic 
to their sites. Consequently, for all practical purpose description and meta tags are 
no longer worth wasting your time. Today, search engine optimization techniques 
determine one's placement in search engines along with paid for placement. Some 
small older search engines still use keywords and description so it never hurts to add 
these to your site. However there are some useful features of this old system that we 
can use to help us get listed using SEO.
Meta Tags
Select Settings | Meta Tags from the administrator toolbar or from the 
administrative screen select the Meta Tags icon. Enter the following information to 
complete the form:
Description: We will enter Cuddle Care Animal Hospital, Austell, Georgia 
offers professional veterinary care with the cuddle care touch.
Keywords: We will enter veterinary,medicine,vet,Austell,Cobb 
County,GA,animal (do not leave space after the coma).
Copyright: We will enter Copyright 2007, Cuddle Care Animal Hospital.
Author: You can insert your name or your company name here.
Enter Additional Meta Tags: We will enter <meta name='author' 
content='your name and site url' />. 
Meta tags offer us a foot in the door to get our site listed into the search 
engines. While not as useful as they once were, you should always take 
advantage of any tool at your disposal to help you promote your website. For 
a list of the various meta tags and an explanation of their function you can go to 
http://www.submitcorner.com/Guide/Meta/. 
Most of you are familiar with myspace.com, yahoo profiles, msn profiles, etc. One of 
the quickest ways to get into these search engines is to have a link from these profiles. 
There are many tricks that you will learn over time. Don't forget to submit your site 
to the search engines and various directories. If you are unfamiliar with how to do 
this I would recommend you to visit http://www.selfpromotion.com. This is a free 
service that you can use and if you are pleased with the service donations are always 
accepted. Save your money and don't pay someone bucks for submitting your site to 
8000 plus search engines. There are really only a handful of search engines that the 
majority of people use.

Summary
In this chapter we have learned how to install and configure the newsletter plugin. 
We learned how to create our first newsletter and how to activate subscriptions. 
We also learned how to install and configure the Events Calendar and how it can 
be used to send out advanced notice of upcoming events. In addition we learned 
a little about RSS feeds and how we can configure them so people can be updated 
automatically on subscription events. And last we briefly covered search engines and 
meta tags and provided a couple of useful sites to assist you with site promotion. 

Maintenance, Optimization, 
and Security
We have learned so far how to create, manipulate, and delete data from our e107 site. 
All that information that we have coded into individual pages is now contained in 
tables within a database. In this chapter we will look at how to keep e107 running 
and how to maintain and optimize our database as well as measures we can take to 
toughen our e107 site against security threats. 
Database Utilities
The heart of our e107 website is our database. We can select themes, create and present 
content, and communicate with the World Wide Web, but if the database does not 
function properly or efficiently, all our hard work will go in vain. As you can see in the 
screenshot below, e107 has some fantastic database utilities built right into it. To access 
the database utilities log in as administrator and either select the Database icon from 
the administrative interface or select Tools | Database from the toolbar.

The Scan Plugin Directories utility checks all installed plugins for any hooked 
(attached to the main database) parameters and the availability of any custom 
bbcodes (bulletin board codes) and shortcodes. It also scans the plugin.php file of 
each plugin for any changes. To run a scan of the plugin directories select Scan plugin 
directories from the Database menu. A new screen will appear as shown below:

Always make a complete database backup before working 
on a database or upgrading e107. In the event that things 
don't go as smoothly as they should, the only time you 
will lose is what it takes to restore the database. Most 
web-hosting companies that offer MySQL will also have 
phpMyAdmin installed. While you can make backups from 
MySQL or phpMyAdmin, most inexperienced users will 
find the later more user friendly. I would also recommend 
the book Mastering phpMyAdmin 2.8 for Effective MySQL 
Management by Marc Delisle published by Packt Publishing. 
If you are unsure how to make a backup, please consult 
your web‑hosting technical support about making a 
complete database backup.
Maintenance Flag
When you are going to perform maintenance on your e107 site, it is always best, to 
temporarily take it off line. We do this so that information is not lost. For instance if 
a customer was placing an order through the store while database maintenance was 
being performed the customer could receive a message stating that the order was 
completed yet the information might not be updated in the database, which might 
make the customer unhappy.
To take your site offline select Tools | Maintenance from the toolbar or the 
Maintenance icon from the administrative interface. On the Maintenance Setting 
screen, you will see two entry fields. Before we take the site offline, we need to place 
a message that people will see. Let's add the following text in the Text to display 
when site down field to display information to users when we are performing 
our maintenance:
Cuddle Care Animal Hospital is temporarily offline for maintenance. 
We are located at 3979 Austell Rd in Austell near the intersection of Mulkey Rd. 
and Austell Rd.
Our hours of operation are Monday, Tuesday Thursday 7 AM to 3 PM, Fridays 
from 7am to 6pm, and Saturdays 9am to 12pm. We are closed on Wednesdays 
and Sundays.
Our Phone Number is 770-434-0311.
Select all of the text and click on the Center Align button in the WYSWIG editor. 
The next step is to check the checkbox next to Activate Maintenance Flag. 
When the maintenance flag is enabled, the site will only be accessible by those with 

Maintenance, Optimization, and Security
[ 230 ]
administrative privileges logging in via the http://www.yoursite.com/e107_
admin/admin.php address. Visitors arriving at the main http://www.yoursite.com 
URL will be redirected to http://yoursite.com/sitedown.php, which will show 
the message you just wrote. Next select the Update Maintenance Setting button to 
save our message.
If you open up a new window and select Home you will now see our site 
maintenance message as shown below:
If you want to turn the Maintenance flag off, you will have to uncheck the checkbox. 
To do so if you have logged off as administrator, you will need to enter via the 
administrator logon screen at http://www.yoursite.com/e107_admin/admin.
php, select Maintenance from the administrative interface, uncheck the Activate 
maintenance flag checkbox and then select the Update Maintenance Setting button.
Check for Available Database Updates
E107 provides the utility to check for available database updates, which will quickly 
alert you to any database updates that you may need. This utility is accessed by 
clicking the Check for Updates button. This will take you to a report screen that will 
look as shown below:

Chapter 9
[ 231 ]
Check Database Validity
If you begin to experience problems one of the first things you should do is to check 
the validity of the database. This MySQL verification can easily be done using the 
Check database validity option available in the Database Utilities. For instance, say 
you received a report that your forum posts were behaving erratically. 
Let's perform the following steps to check the database validity of the forum tables:
1.	 You will first select the Check database validity option.
2.	 An SQL Verification screen appears, select the forum checkbox.
3.	 Click on the Start Verify button to initiate the check.
The resultant screen will appear as shown below: 

Maintenance, Optimization, and Security
[ 232 ]
Optimize SQL Database
This function is used to clean up your database and make it perform more efficiently. 
Instances where optimization would be used would be if you have installed a plugin 
and then uninstalled it or you have pruned your forum by moving or deleting data. 
Select the Optimize SQL database button from the Database Utilities. This will 
initiate the optimization process and provide you with a completion message when it 
has finished. 
Backup Core
Before installing any plugins that have hooks into the core database, it is best to back 
up your core database files. This way, if the plugin doesn't perform properly and you 
corrupt your core data while uninstalling the plugin, it can easily be restored. To run 
this utility you simply select the Backup core option from the Database Utilities.
The Backup Core function is not the same as making a 
complete database backup. 
Security
There is a remarkable amount of security coded into e107. For the beginner, the 
default file settings should be sufficient. If you are really paranoid about security, 
you can rename the directories; however, I would not recommend this unless you are 
comfortable editing PHP files. One of the things you can do is to make sure that the 
register_globals directive is set to On in your PHP installation. To verify this:
Select Tools | PHP Info from the toolbar or the PHP Info icon from the 
administrative interface. After selecting the PHP info option, if you see a blank 
screen then your web‑hosting service might have disabled this function from 
executing. If this happens you can ask your web-hosting support for the information. 
If the register globals are there and you have your own server then set them to On.
File Uploads
File uploads are controlled through the filetypes.php file located in the directory 
/public_html/e107_admin/ e107_admin/. By default, the file types included are:
zip, gz, jpg, png, gif

Chapter 9
[ 233 ]
If you attempt to upload a file with an extension that is not contained in the 
filetypes.php file you will get an error message saying:
The filetype application/pdf is not allowed and has been deleted.
To correct this to the following:
Download the filetypes.php file from the /public_html/e107_admin/ 
e107_admin/ directory.
Open the downloaded file in Notepad or a similar text editor. Place a comma 
after the last file name, leave one space, and then enter the file type. Note that 
you don't have to include a period at the start of the file type. For instance if 
you wanted to add the file type swf to the file types, your list would look like 
the following: zip, gz, jpg, png, gif, swf
When you have finished, save the filetypes.php file and upload it back to 
the /public_html/e107_admin/ e107_admin/ directory overwriting the 
existing file. 
Never allow .htm, .html, .xhtml, .shtml, .xml, .php, 
.doc, text, or similar files as they may be embedded with 
JavaScript or other malicious code or executable script.
Passwords
One of the best ways to keep your sites secure is to change your passwords 
frequently and use sufficiently complex passwords to make the task of cracking/
hacking difficult. One way is to use a combination of upper and lower case letters 
with numbers. Passwords should no be less than six alphanumeric characters but 
nine are recommended. 
You should not include your name, names of members of your family, your date of 
birth, their date of birth, anniversaries, or combinations of this information. These are 
the first things that a skilled hacker will use. For the curious, open your web browser 
and do a search on "Common Methods to Hack Websites". You will find a wealth of 
information about how passwords are hacked easily. 
For a quick way to generate a password, go to http://www.techzoom.net/
security-password.asp or do a search on password generation for similar sites. 
Just remember that as admin, you will need to change the password to your MySQL 
server password as well or you will receive an error message that you are unable to 
connect with the database due to an invalid password.

Maintenance, Optimization, and Security
[ 234 ]
Security & Protection Preferences
To set security and protection preferences for the site, log in, go to the administrative 
interface, select the Preferences option, and then click on Security& Protection. 
Now change the settings as shown in the screenshot below except select the Filter 
profanities? checkbox to filter profanities and then provide a list of words in the 
Filter Words field.
For more information on the settings for maintaining security as shown in the 
screenshot above you can refer to Chapter 3.
Summary
In this chapter, we examined setting the maintenance flag, checking for database 
updates, checking database validity, optimizing your SQL database, scanning plugin 
directories, and making a backup of your core files. We also discussed file uploads, 
password complexity, and setting security and protection preferences.
