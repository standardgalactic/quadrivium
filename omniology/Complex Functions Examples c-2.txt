Introduction
Introduction
This is the second book containing examples from the Theory of Complex Functions. The ﬁrst topic
will be examples of the necessary general topological concepts. Then follow some examples of complex
functions, complex limits and complex line integrals. Finally, we reach the subject itself, namely the
analytic functions in general. The more speciﬁc properties of these analytic functions will be given in
the books to follow.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Some necessary theoretical results
This chapter must not be considered as a replacement of the usual textbooks, concerning the theory
necessary for the examples. We shall always assume that all the fundamental deﬁnitions of continuity
etc. are well-known. Furthermore, we are also missing some theoretical results. The focus here is
solely on the most important theorems for this book. We start by quoting the three main theorems
for the continuous functions:
Theorem 1.1 If f : Ω →C is continuous and the domain A ⊆Ω is compact, (i.e. closed and
bounded), then the range f(A) is also compact.
Theorem 1.2 If f : Ω →C is continuous and the domain A ⊆Ω is connected, then the range f(A)
is also connected.
Theorem 1.3 Any continuous map f : Ω →C is uniformly continuous on every compact subset
A ⊆Ω.
We see that the compact sets, i.e. the bounded and closed sets, are playing a central role in connection
with continuous functions. This is why we have given them the name compact sets.
The complex plane C is in a natural correspondence with the real plane R × R, by writing
z = x + iy ∈C,
corresponding to
(x, y) ∈R × R.

Then a complex function f(z) can also be written
f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y),
where
u(x, y) = Re f(z)
and
v(x, y) = Im f(z)
are the real part and the imaginary part respectively of the complex function f(z) in the complex
variable z = x + iy ∈C.
In the same way we consider a plane curve C as both lying in C and in R × R. Since we formally have
by a splitting into the real part and the imaginary part
f(z) dz = {u(x, y) + i v(x, y)}{dx + i dy} = {u dx −v dy} + i{u dy + v dx},
we deﬁne the complex line integral along C by

C
f(z) dz :=

C
{u dx −v dy} + i

C
{u dy + v dx},
and then the complex line integral is reduced to a complex sum of of two ordinary real line integrals.
Deﬁnition 1.1 Assume that Ω is an open non-empty subset of C, and let f : Ω →C be a complex
function. If the limit
lim
z∈Ω
z→z0
f(z) −f (z0)
z −z0
exists for some given z0 ∈Ω, then we say that f is diﬀerentiable at z0, and we use all the usual
notations of the derivative from the real analysis like e.g. f ′ (z0).
If f : Ω →C is diﬀerentiable at every z ∈Ω, and the derivative f ′(z) is continuous in Ω, then we call
f an analytical function.
Then we have the following theorem:
Theorem 1.4 Assume that f(z) = u(x, y)+i v(x, y) is deﬁned in an open set Ω, and assume further-
more that both u(x, y) and v(x, y) are continuously diﬀerentiable with respect to both x and y. Then
the complex function f(z) is an analytic function, if and only if the pair u(x, y) and v(x, y) fulﬁl the
Cauchy-Riemann equations in Ω:
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y
and
∂u
∂u = −∂v
∂x.
If we instead use polar coordinates,
x = r · cos θ,
y = r · sin θ,
in our description of a complex function, i.e.
f(z) = u(r, θ) + i v(r, θ),

then the same theorem still holds if and only if the Cauchy-Riemann equations in polar coordinates
are satisﬁed,
∂u
∂r = 1
r
∂v
∂θ ,

∂θ = −∂v
∂r .
One of the main theorems of the Theory of Complex Functions is
Theorem 1.5 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem.
Assume that the function f(z) is analytic in a
simply connected domain Ω (this means roughly speaking that the domain does not contain “holes”),
then the value of the line integral
 z
z0
f(z) dz
is independent of the choice of the continuous and piecewise diﬀerentiable curve C in Ω from the ﬁxed
point z0 ∈Ω to the ﬁxed point z ∈Ω.
In in particular the curve is closed, then

C
f(z) dz = 0.
The next important result, which is given here, is also due to Cauchy:
Theorem 1.6 Cauchy’s integral formula. Assume that f(z) is analytic in an open domain Ω.
Assume that C is composed of simple and closed piecewise diﬀerentiable curves in Ω, run through in
such a way that all points inside C (this means to the left of C seen in the direction of the movement)
belong to Ω.
Let z0 be any point inside C in the sense above. Then
f (z0) =
1
2πi

C
f(z)
z −z0
dz.
We also mention
Theorem 1.7 The Mean Value Theorem. The value of an analytic function f(z) at a point z0
is equal to the mean value of the function over any circle of centrum z0 and radius r, assuming that
the closed disc B [z0, r] of centrum z0 and radius r is contained in Ω. We have for such r > 0,
f (z0) = 1
2π
 2π

f

z0 + r eiθ
dθ.
Finally, we mention
Theorem 1.8 Cauchy’s inequalities. Assume that f(z) is analytic in a domain which contains
the closed disc
B [z0, r] = {z ∈C | |z −z0| ≤r} ,
and let Mr denote the maximum of |f(z)| on the circle |z −z0| = r. Then
f (n) (z0)
 ≤Mr · n!

for every n ∈N0.

Example 2.1 Let Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Find the smallest system of open sets in Ω, such that
{1},
{2, 4},
{1, 2, 3}
are all open sets.
We shall ﬁnd the open system, which is generated by
{1},
{2, 4},
{1, 2, 3}.
First of all, both ∅and Ω must belong to the system.
Then all intersections must also be contained in the system, thus
{1} ∩{2, 4} = ∅,
{1} ∩{1, 2, 3} = {1},
{2, 4} ∩{1, 2, 3} = {2}.
By this process we conclude that {2} must also be open.
Finally, all unions of sets from the system must again be open. This gives
{1} ∪{2} = {1, 2},
{1} ∪{1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3},
{1} ∪{2, 4} = {1, 2, 4},
{2} ∪{2, 4} = {2, 4},
{2} ∪{1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3},
{2, 4} ∪{1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4} = Ω.
We have now exhausted all possibilities, so the system of open sets must consist of the sets
∅,
{1},
{2},
{1, 2},
{2, 4},
{1, 2, 3},
{1, 2, 4},
Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Example 2.2 Let f : R 	→R be deﬁned by
f(x) =
1
2 + |x|.
Prove that f is a contraction, and ﬁnd the corresponding ﬁxpoint.
We shall prove that there exists a constant C < 1, such that
|f(x) −f(y)| ≤C |x −y|.
By a small computation and an estimate,
|f(x) −f(y)| =

1
2 + |x| −
1
2 + |y|
 =

2 + |y| −2 −|x|
(2 + |x|)(2 + |y|)
 =

|y| −|x|
(2 + |x|)(2 + |y|)
 ≤1
4 |x −y|,
proving that the map is a contraction.
Now, f(x) > 0 for every x ∈R, so a ﬁxpoint must necessarily be positive, thus |x| = x. Then we shall
solve the equation
1
2 + x = x,
x > 0.

This is equivalent to
x2 + 2x = 1,
x > 0,
hence
(x + 1)2 = x2 + 2x + 1 = 2,
x > 0,
and thus
x = ±2 −1,
x > 0.
It follows that the ﬁxpoint is
x =
√
2 −1.

Example 2.3 Let f : R × R 	→R be given by
f(x, y) =

x2 + 1

sinh y + x + y2
2 .
Prove that the equation f(x, y) = 0 globally determines y as a function of x.
Hint: Prove for every ﬁxed x that f(x, y) is a continuous and strictly increasing function of y, which
takes on the value 0.
Then ﬁnd by implicit diﬀerentiation the approximating polynomial of at most second degree for y as
a function of x from the point (x0, y0) = (0, 0).
We see that f ∈C∞(R × R) and
f ′
y(x, y) =

x2 + 1

cosh y + y ≥cosh y + y > 0,
so f(x, y) is for every ﬁxed x strictly increasing in. Furthermore, we clearly have
f(x, y) →−∞for y →−∞
og
f(x, y) →+∞for y →+∞
for every ﬁxed x. By the continuity there exists for every x ∈R precisely one y ∈R, such that
f(x, y) = 0. This is another way of saying that y is determined as a function of x.
Now let y = y(x) be given by the construction above. Then y(0) = 0, because (0, 0) clearly satisﬁes
the equation, and because the solution is unique. Then we get by implicit diﬀerentiation,

x2 + 1

cosh y + y
 dy
dx + 2x sinh y + 1 = 0.
If we here put (x, y) = (0, 0) and solve with respect to the derivative, we get

1 = −1.
In general we get by another implicit diﬀerentiation,

If we here put


x=0

hence
d2y

The approximating polynomial of at most second degree form the point of expansion x = 0 is given
by
P(x) = −x −1

Example 3.1 Let w = u + iv. Find in the following examples u(x, y) and v(x, y) as real functions in
two real variables:
(a) w = z3,
(b) w = z + 1
z ,
(c) w =
z
1 + z ,
(d) w = z ez.
(a) If z ∈C, then
w = u + iv = z3 = (x + iy)3 = x3 + 3ix2y −3xy2 −iy3,
hence by a separation into real and imaginary parts
u(x, y) = x3 −3xy2
and
v(x, y) = 3xy2 −y3,
(b) If z ∈C \ {0}, then
w = u + iv = x + 1
z = z +

v(x, y) = y −

The function

x + 1
(x + 1)2 + y2 ,
v(x, y) =
y
(x + 1)2 + y2 .
The function w =
z
z + 1 is an example of an homography, also called a fractional linear transfor-
mation.
(d) If z ∈C, then
w
=
u + iv = z ez = (x + iy)ex(cos y + i sin y)
=
x ex cos y −y ex sin y + i {x ex sin y + y ex cos y} ,
hence by separation into real and imaginary parts,
u(x, y) = x ex cos y −y ex sin y,
v(x, y) = x ex sin y + y ex cos y.

v = 2ct.
If y = 0, thus c = 0, we get u = t2 and v = 0, so the image of y = 0 is R+ ∪{0} “run through twice”.
If c > 0, it follows by eliminating t that we have the following equation of a parabola,
u = v2

suﬃces to ﬁnd the images of the boundary curves z = ±1 + iy.
Since w = ±2 + i(2y + 1), we conclude that the range is
{w ∈C | |Re(w)| < 2}.

Figure 3: (b) The image of Ω is the open domain between the two oblique lines.
(b) The map w = (1 + i)z + 1 is continuous and open. Therefore, it suﬃces as in (a) to ﬁnd the
images of the boundary curves.
If we put z = −1 + iy, y ∈R, then
w = (1 + i)(−1 + iy) + 1 = −1 −i + y(−1 + i) + 1 = −i + y(i −1).
This is a parametric description of a line through the points −i and −1 (put y = 0 and y = 1).
If we instead put z = 1 + iy, then
w = (1 + i)(1 + iy) + 1 = 2 + i + (−1 + i)y,
which is the parametric description of a line. By putting y = 0, or y = 1, we get the points 2 + i
and 1 + 2i, and it is easy to sketch the domain.

The map is open, so we get by a continuity argument (use e.g. that z = i is mapped into w = −i)
it follows that the range is the open domain outside the two discs.
Notice that the point z = 0 must be removed from the domain |Re(z)| < 1, because the map is
not deﬁned at that point.

We conclude by the symmetry about (0, 0) that the image of the strips

Summing up, the range is that domain which “lies between” the circle and the vertical straight
line u = 1, thus the range is a part of the open left half plane given by u = 1, and which also lies
outside the closed disc of centrum 1

When we eliminate the parameter x, we get the equation of the parabola

Now, x = eu + u runs through all of R, when u runs through R, so the curve is the horizontal line
y = 2pπ. This is in particular true p = 0, so in this case the curve is the whole of the x-axis.
If v = (2p + 1)π, p ∈Z, then
x = u −eu
and
y = (2p + 1)π,
u ∈R.
Since
dx
du = 1 −eu,
we conclude that the function x(u) has a maximum for u = 0, corresponding to x = −1, and since
x(u) →−∞for u →+∞and for u →−∞, we conclude that the half lines
x ≤−1,
y = (2p + 1)π,
p ∈Z,
are run through twice. This is in particular true for p = 0.

2c is equivalent to 2cx = x2 + y2, thus
(x −c)2 + y2 = c2,
(x, y) ̸= (0, 0),
and the level curve is a circle of centrum (c, 0) and radius |c|, with the exception of the singular
point (0, 0).

x2 + (y −1)2

x2 + (y −1)2 .
Then by separation into the real and the imaginary parts,
u(x, y) = 1 +
2(y −1)
x2 + (y −1)2
and
v(x, y) =
2x
x2 + (y −1)2 .
It follows that the curve u(x, y) = 1 is the line y = 1, with the exception of the point (0, 1), in
which the denominator is always 0.

k =

singular point (0, 1).
The case v(x, y) = k is treated analogously.
If v = 0, then x = 0 (i.e. the y-axis), with the exception of the singular point (0, 1).
If v = k ̸= 0, then we get instead,

Example 4.1 Check if the following limits exist:
(a)
lim
z→0
z
z ,
(b)
lim
z→−1
z4 −2z2 + 1
z + 1
.
(a) Put z = x + iy ̸= 0. Then
z
z = x −iy
x + iy .
If in particular we choose z real, z = x, we get
z
z = 1,
hence
lim
x→0
x
x = 1.
If we instead choose z imaginary, z = iy, then
z
z = −iy
iy
= −1,
hvoraf
lim
y→0
iy
iy = −1.
Since we do not get the same limit value by the two diﬀerent limits towards the same point, the
limit value does not exist for z →0, by the deﬁnition.
(b) Since
z4 −2z2 + 1 =

z2 −1
2 = (z + 1)2(z −1)2,
it follows for z ̸= −1 that
z2 −2z2 + 1
z + 1
= (z + 1)(z −1)2 →0 · (−1)2 = 0
for z →−1.
Hence the limit value exists ant
lim
z→−1
z4 −2z2 + 1
z + 1
= 0.
Example 4.2 Check if any of the following functions (deﬁned for z ̸= 0), can be extended continuously
to z = 0:

(b) Since e.g.

for y = 0 and x ̸= 0,

for x = 0 and y ̸= 0,
we cannot extend this function continuously to z = 0.
(d) Since

Re(z)
|z|


x2 + y2 ≤1
for every z ̸= 0,
we get

z Re(z)
|z|
 ≤|z| · 1 →0

and we conclude that this function can be extended continuously to z = 0 with the value f(0) = 0.
Example 4.3 Check if the following limit values exist. In the case of existence, ﬁnd the limit value:

(c)

(a) We shall prove that the limit value is 0, thus
|an −0| < ε
for every n ≥N(ε).
This follows easily from the following trivial estimate
|an −0| = |an| =

nn = 1

n ≤1

for n →+∞. This proves that the limit value exists and that
lim
n→+∞
n!in
nn = 0.
(b) Since the sequence repeats cyclical the values i, −1, −i and 2, the limit value does not exist.

(c) We shall prove that the limit value also in this case is 0, thus we shall prove that

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Figure 32: The line segment C from 1 + i to 3 + 2i.
Here we have at least three diﬀerent variants:
1) The “standard” method. The curve C has the parametric description
z(t) = 1 + i + (2 + i)t,
t ∈[0, 1],
hence by separation into real and imaginary parts,
x(t) = 1 + 2t
and
y(t) = 1 + t
for t ∈[0, 1].
Hence by insertion,

which can be seen by

and the form is deﬁned in the simply connected domain R2. Hence, the value can be found by
some clever manipulation of the integrand,

The curve C is just a half circle in the upper half plan of radius 1 and centrum 0. It is well-known
that its length is L = π.
If z ∈C, then |z| =

Diﬀerentiable and analytic functions; Cauchy-Riemann’s equa-
tions
Example 6.1 Given the function
f(x + iy) =

x2 + 2y

+ i

x2 + y2
.
Find the points z0 in which f ′ (z0) exists.
Clearly, f ∈C∞
R2
. Then by partial diﬀerentiation,
∂u
∂x = 2x,
∂v
∂y = 2y,
thus
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y for x = y,
and
∂u
∂y = 2,
∂v
∂x = 2x,
thus
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x for x = −1.
It follows that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only fulﬁlled for x = y = −1, hence the complex
derivative f ′ (z0) does only exist at the point z0 = −1 −i, where
f ′(−1 −i) = −2 −2i.
Example 6.2 Prove that the function
2x2+3y2+4xy+5x+2y+3 + i

6x2+2y2+3xy+2x+7y+1

is not analytic in any domain of the complex plane.
The function is clearly of class C∞
R2
. We shall therefore only check Cauchy-Riemann’s equations.
We get
∂u
∂x = 4x + 4y + 5,
∂v
∂y = 4y + 3x + 7,
∂u
∂y = 6y + 4x + 2,
∂v
∂x = 12x + 3y + 2.
The it follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y ,
thus
4x + 4y + 5 = 3x + 4y + 7,
hence x = 2, and
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x,
thus
4x + 6y + 2 = −12x −3y −2.
We conclude from the latter equation that
16x + 9y + 4 = 0.

If we here put x = 2, we get y = −4, hence Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only fulﬁlled at the point
z = 2 −4i.
Now, a point does not contain an open domain, so we conclude that the function is not analytic.
Example 6.3 Prove that none of the following functions is analytic at any point:
(a) f(z) = xy + iy,
(b) f(z) = ey(cos x + i sin x).
All the given functions are of class C∞
R2
, so we shall only prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations
are not fulﬁlled in any open domain.
(a) It follows from
u(x, y) = xy
and
v(x, y) = y,
that
∂u
∂x = y,
∂u
∂y = x
og
∂v
∂x = 0,
∂v
∂y = 1,
and we conclude that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only satisﬁed at the point (0, 1), and a
point cannot contain any domain.
(b) Since
u(x, y) = ey cos x
and
v(x, y) = ey sin x,
it follows by diﬀerentiation that
∂u
∂x = −ey sin x,
∂u
∂y = ey cos x,
∂v
∂x = ey cos x,
∂v
∂y = ey sin x.
We see that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only fulﬁlled when both sin x = 0 and cos x = 0 at
the same time, and this is not possible, because
cos2 x + sin2 x = 1.
Example 6.4 Given ϕ(x, y) = x3y. Is it possible to ﬁnd a function ψ(x, y), such that
f(z) = ϕ(x, y) + i ψ(x, y)
becomes analytic?
According to Cauchy-Riemann’s equations ψ must satisfy
∂ψ
∂x = −∂ϕ
∂y = −x3,
∂ψ
∂y = ∂ϕ
∂x = 3x2y.

It follows from the former equation that
ψ(x, y) = −1
4 x4 + C1(y),
and then from the latter equation,
ψ(x, y) = 3
2 x2y2 + C2(x).
It follows that these two expressions can never be identical, no matter how C1(y) and C2(x) are chosen.
In fact, the variables occur in diﬀerent terms in the former expression of ψ, while such a separation
of the variables is impossible in the second expression.
Hence one cannot ﬁnd such a function ψ.
Alternatively (and better) we see that ϕ(x, y) = x3y is not harmonic:
△ϕ = 6xy + 0 = 6xy ̸= 0
for xy ̸= 0,
and since △ϕ = 0 is a necessary condition for ϕ being the real part of some analytic function, there
does not exist such a ψ.
Example 6.5 Prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled for the function f(z) =

|xy|,
z = x + iy, at the point z = 0, and that the derivative nevertheless does not exist.
Since f(z) is real, we have
u(x, y) =

|xy|
and
v(x, y) = 0.
Since u(x, 0) = 0, we have
∂u
∂x (0, 0) = 0 = ∂v
∂y (0, 0),
and since u(0, y) = 0, we also have
∂u
∂y (0, 0) = −∂v
∂x (0, 0) = 0,
and we have proved that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations hold at the point z ∼(0, 0).
Let us approach (0, 0) along the curve of the parametric description
x(t) = t,
y(t) = t,
t ∈R+.
Then
ϕ(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) =
√
t2 = t,
t ∈R+,
so ϕ′(t) = 1 ̸= 0, and the derivative does not exist.

Since f(z) for z ̸= 0 is the composition of analytic functions, it follows that f analytic for z ̸= 0. In
particular, f(z) fulﬁls Cauchy-Riemann’s equations for z ̸= 0.
On the other hand, the function is not continuous at z = 0, thus it cannot be analytic at z = 0 either.
In fact, if we choose the curve of the parametric description

It follows by inspection that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are also fulﬁlled at (0, 0), thus they hold
all over C.
The lesson is that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations alone without any assumption of continuity are not
suﬃcient for analyticity.

Example 6.7 Prove by means of Cauchy-Riemanns equations that the function
f(z) = (−ex sin y + 3) + i (ex cos y + 5)
is analytic everywhere in C.
The functions
u(x, y) = −ex sin y + 3
and
v(x, y) = ex cos y + 5
are both of class C∞
R2
, so it suﬃces to prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled every-
where in C. We get by diﬀerentiation
∂u
∂x = −ex sin y,
∂v
∂y = −ex sin y,
dvs.
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y ,
∂u
∂y = −ex cos y,
∂v
∂x = ex cos x,
dvs.
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x.
Since Cauchy-Riemann’s equations hold everywhere in C, we conclude that f(z) is analytic in all of
C.
Remark 6.1 Note that it is easy to ﬁnd f(z) by the following manipulations,
f(z)
=
{−ex sin y + 3} + i {ex cos y + 5} = i2ex sin y + i ex cos y + (3 + 5i)
=
i {ex cos y + i ex sin y} + (3 + 5i) = i ez + (3 + 5i).

Example 6.8 Check the diﬀerent concepts of logarithm in the Theory of Complex Functions.
In the Theory of Complex Functions one use in particular the following three diﬀerent forms of the
logarithm:
1) The real natural logarithm ln : R+ →R.
2) The principal branch of the logarithm Log : C \ (R−∪{0}), where Ω = C \ (R−∪{0}) is an open
sliced domain of the complex plane along the negative real axis, such that always Arg z ∈] −π, π[
for z ∈Ω. In this case,
Log z := ln |z| + i Arg z = ln r + iθ,
where z = r eiθ ∈Ω, and θ ∈] −π, π[.
By using Cauchy-Riemann’s equations in polar coordinates it is easy to prove that Log z is analytic
in Ω with the derivative
f ′(z) = e−iθ
∂u
∂r + i ∂v
∂r = 1
r e−iθ

=
1
r eiθ = 1
z ,
and it follows that Log z deﬁned on Ω is an extension of ln x deﬁned on R+.
We also note that
exp ◦Log (z) = exp(ln r + iθ) = eln r eiθ = r eiθ = z,
hence in Ω the functions exp and Log are inverse to each other.

3) Finally, we also have the multiple-valued function log z, deﬁned on C \ {0} by
log z =
⎧
⎨
⎩
Log z + 2ipπ,
p ∈Z,
for z ∈Ω,
ln |z| + i{2p + 1}π,
p ∈Z,
for z ∈R−.
This function is not uniquely determined, so we shall not call it an analytic function, even though it
has many properties in common with the analytic functions. Notice that none of these logarithms
is deﬁned for z = 0.
Example 6.9 Check the following functions, if they fulﬁl the Cauchy-Riemann equations in their
domains:
(a)
f(z) = x2 −y2 −2ixy.
(b)
x3 −3y2x + 2x + i

3x2y −y3 + 2y

.
(c)
f(z) = 1
2 ln

x2 −y2
+ i Arctan y
x.
(d)
f(z) = 1
2 ln

x2 + y2
+ i Arccot x
y .
(a) The domain is C, and by separating the real and the imaginary part we get
u(x, y) = x2 −y2
and
v = −2xy,
hence
∂u
∂x = 2x
and
∂v
∂y = 2x ̸= ∂u
∂x
for x ̸= 0.
We conclude that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are not satisﬁed in any open domain.
Remark 6.2 If one also consider the second one of Cauchy-Riemann’s equation, it can be proved
that they are only fulﬁlled at (0, 0). ♦
Remark 6.3 Note that f(z) = z2.

(b) The domain is C, and we get by separation of the real and the imaginary part that
u(x, y) = x3 −3y2x + 2x
and
v(x, y) = 3x2y −y3 + 2y,
thus
∂u
∂x = 3x2 −3y2 + 2 = ∂v
∂y
og
∂u
∂y = −6yx = −∂v
∂x.
We have proved that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are satisﬁed in all of C.
Remark 6.4 In this case it follows that
f(z)
=
x3 −3y2x + 2x + i

3x2y −y3 + 2y

=
x3 + 3x·iy + 3x(iy)2 + (iy)3 + 2(x + iy)
=
z3 + 2z.

Example 6.10 Check if the following functions are analytic in any domain of the plane,
(a)
f(z) = x2 + y2 + 2ixy.
(b)
f(z) = 2x −3y + i(3x + 2y).
(c)
f(z) = x + iy
x2 + y2 .
(d)
f(z) =
x2 −y2 + 2i |xy|.
(a) The function
f(z) = x2 + y2 + 2ixy
is not analytic anywhere. It is seen by a separation of the real and the imaginary part that
u(x, y) = x2 + y2
and
v(x, y) = 2xy
are both of class C∞
R2
. Then by a diﬀerentiation,
∂u
∂x = 2x = ∂v
∂y
and
∂y
∂y = 2y = ∂v
∂x.
We see that one of the Cauchy-Riemann equations is satisﬁed, but the other
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x,
is only fulﬁlled for y = 0, i.e. on the real axis, and the real axis does not contain any open domain
of the plane.
(b) It is seen by inspection that
f(z) = 2x −3y + i(3x + 2y) = 2(x + iy) + 3i(x + iy) = (2 + 3i)z,
which of course is analytic everywhere in C.

(c) An inspection shows that if z ̸= 0 (i.e. when f(z) is deﬁned), then
f(z) = x + iy

Indirect proof. Assume that f(z) = 1
z were analytic for z ̸= 0. Then according to the rules of
computation,
1
f(z) = z must be analytic in the same domain.
However, since
1
f(z) = z is not analytic anywhere, f(z) cannot be analytic.

If x2 −y2 > 0 and 2xy > 0 (two angular spaces), then clearly
f(z) =
x2 −y2 + 2i|xy| = x2 −y2 + 2ixy = z2
is analytic, cf. the ﬁgure.
If x2 −y2 < 0 and 2xy (again two angular spaces), then
f(z) =
x2 −y2 + 2i|xy| = −

x2 −y2 + 2ixy

= −z2
is analytic, and f(z) is (at least) analytic in the four marked angular spaces on the ﬁgure.
If x2 −y2 < 0 and 2xy > 0 (again two angular spaces), then
f(z) =
x2 −y2 + 2i|xy| = −

x2 −y2 −2ixy

= −z2.
If x2 −y2 > 0 and 2xy < 0 (the two remaining angular spaces), then
f(z) =
x2 −y2 + 2i|xy| = x2 −y2 −2ixy = z2.
The function f(z) is not analytic in any of these latter cases. We have e.g. for z2 that
u(x, y) = x2 −y2
and
v(x, y) = −2xy,
hence
∂u
∂x = 2x,
∂v
∂y = −2x,
∂u
∂y = −2y,
∂v
∂x = −2y.
It follows that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only satisﬁed at (0, 0).
Example 6.11 Prove that the following functions are analytic:
(a)
f(z) = x2 −y2 −2xy + i

x2 −y2 + 2xy

for z ∈C.
(b)
f(z) = x3 + xy2 + x + i

x2 + y2

for z ∈C \ {0}.
(c)
f(z) = sin x · cosh y + i cos x · sinh y,
for z ∈C.
As usual it is worth while ﬁrst to make an inspection. This will give us some variants in each part of
the example.

(a) 1) Inspection. All terms contain the variables (x, y) of degree 2. Therefore, it is quite reasonable
ﬁrst to consider
z2 = (x + iy)2?x2 −y2 + 2ixy.
When we try to rewrite the expression of f(z) by means of expressions which contain z2, we
see that
f(z)
=

x2 −y2
−2xy + i

x2 −y2 + {2xy}

=

x2 −y2 + 2ixy

+ i

x2 −y2 + 2ixy

=
(1 + i)z2.
Since f(z) = (1 + i)z2 is a polynomial, we conclude that f(z) is analytic.
2) Cauchy-Riemann’s equations. First note that
u(x, y) = x2 −y2 −2xy
and
v(x, y) = x2 −y2 + 2xy
are both of class C∞
R2
. We shall therefore only prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations
are fulﬁlled. We ﬁnd
u(x, y) = x2 −y2 −2xy,
v(x, y) = x2 −y2 + 2xy,
∂u
∂x = 2x −2y,
∂v
∂y = −2y + 2x,
∂u
∂y = −2y −2x,
∂v
∂x = 2x + 2y.
This implies that
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y
and
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x,
hence Cauchy-Riemann’s are satisﬁed everywhere, and we conclude that f(z) is analytic.
In order to prove that f(z) = (1 + i)z2, one must either go through the argument of (1) once
more, or otherwise diﬀerentiate twice, in which case we get f ′′(z) = 2(1 + i). Then we get the
result by two successive integrations.
(b) 1) Inspection. The degree of the numerator is 3, and the denominator has only degree 2. It is
reasonable ﬁrst to try a reduction. Here we get without any problems
x3 + xy2 = x

x2 + y2
and
x2y + y3 = y

x2 + y2
.
Then by insertion and reduction,
(1) f(z) = x3 + xy2 + x + i

x2y + y3 −y

x2 + y2
x +
x
x2 + y2 + i

y −
y
x2 + y2

.
Since x2 + y2 = |z|2 = z · z, it follows from (1) that
f(z) = x + iy + x −iy
x2 + y2 = z +
z
z · z = z + 1
z ,
which of course is analytic for z ̸= 0.

2) Cauchy-Riemann’s equations. We shall here immediately use the reduction (1), which we
here assume. If z ̸= 0, then
u(x, y) = x +
x
x2 + y2
and
v(x, y) = y −
y
x2 + y2 ,
which of course are both of class C∞
R2 \ {(0, 0)}

. Then
∂u
∂x = 1 +
1
x2 + y2 −
2x2
(x2 + y2)2 = 1 +
y2 −x2
(x2 + y2)2 ,
∂v
∂y = 1 −
1
x2 + y2 +
2y2
(x2 + y2)2 = 1 +
y2 −x2
(x2 + y2)2 = ∂u
∂x,
and
∂u
∂y = −
2xy
(x2 + y2)2 ,
∂v
∂x = +
2xy
(x2 + y2)2 = −∂u
∂y .
Thus it follows that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are fulﬁlled, so f(z) is analytic everywhere
in its domain.
3) Cauchy-Riemann’s equations without the reduction (1). This is the diﬃcult variant,
in which one checks if the original expressions
u(x, y) = x3 + yx + x
x2 + y2
and
v(x, y) = x2y + y3 −y
x2 + y2
satisfy Cauchy-Riemann’s equations.

(c) It will later be shown that f(z) is the deﬁnition of the complex function sin z, z ∈C. Since this
function has not yet been deﬁned, we must instead use the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
Clearly, the functions
u(x, y) = sin x · cosh y
and
v(x, y) = cos x · sinh y
are both of class C∞
R2
. Furthermore,
∂u
∂x = cos x · cosh y = ∂v
∂y
and
∂u
∂y = sin x · sinh y = −∂v
∂x,
hence Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are satisﬁed, thus
f(z) = sin x · cosh y + i cos x · sinh y
{= sin z = sin(x + iy)}
is analytic in all of C.

Example 6.12 Find some real constants a, b, c, d, such that the following functions become analytic:
(a)
f(z) = x + a y + i(bx + cy).
(b)
f(x) = x2 + a xy + b y2 + i

c x2 + d xy + y2
.
(c)
f(z) = cos x · cosh y + a cos x · sinh yi (b sin x · sinh y + sin x · cosh y) .
We ﬁrst note that all the functions are of class C∞
R2
. Therefore, we shall only check if Cauchy-
Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled.
(a) Since
u(x, y) = x + a y
and
v(x, y) = b x + c y,
it follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that
∂u
∂x = 1 = ∂v
∂y = c
and
∂u
∂y = a = −∂v
∂x = −b.
Thus, the function is analytic, if and only if c = 1 and a = −b. In that case we also have
f(z) = x −b y + i(b x + y) = (1 + ib)(x + iy) = (1 + ib)z.
(b) Since
u(x, y) = x2 + a xy + b y2
and
v(x, y) = c x2 + d xy + y2,
it follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that
∂u
∂x
=
2x + a y = ∂v
∂y = d · x + 2y,

These equations must hold for all x and y, hence we conclude that
d = 2,
a = 2,
a = −2c
and
2b = −d,
hence
a = 2,
b = −1
2 d = −1,
c = −1
2 a = −1,
d = 2,
and we conclude that the only possible function is

x2 −y2 + 2ixy

(c) Since
u(x, y)
=
cos c · cosh y + a · cos x · sinh y,
v(x, y)
=
b · sin x · sinh y + sin x · cosh y,
we get
∂u
∂x
=
−sin x · cosh y −a · sin x · sinh y,
∂v
∂y
=
b · sin x · cosh y + sin x · sinh y,
∂u
∂y
=
cosh x · sinh y + a · cos x · cosh y,
∂v
∂x
=
b · cos x · sinh y + cos x · cosh y.
It follows that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are satisﬁed, if
b = −1,
−a = 1,
b = −1
and
a = −1,
thus for a = b = −1. For these values we obtain the analytic function
f(z)
=
cos x · cosh y −cos x · sinh y + i {−sin x · sinh y + sin x · cosh y}
=
cos x · {cosh y −sinh y} + i sin x · {cosh y −sinh y}

Example 6.13 Find all analytic functions in C of the form
f(z) = f(x + iy) = ϕ(x) + i ψ(y),
where ϕ and ψ are C1-functions in one real variable.
We ﬁrst assume that ϕ and ψ are real functions. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for f(z) being
analytic is that ϕ and ψ are both of class C1, and that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled,
i.e.
∂ϕ
∂x (x) = ϕ′(x) = ∂ψ
∂y (y) = ψ′(y),
because it is trivial that
∂ϕ
∂y (x) = −∂ψ
∂x (y) = 0
The equation ϕ′(x) = ψ′(y) is only satisﬁed, if the common value is a real constant a. In fact, since
ϕ′(x) is independent of y, we conclude that ψ′(y) = ϕ′(x) is a constant. Hence
ϕ′(x) = a
and
ψ′(y) = a,
a ∈R,
thus
ϕ(x) = a x + c1
and
ψ(y) = a y + c2,

f(z) = ϕ(x) + i ψ(y) = a · (x + iy) + c1 + i c2 = a z + c,
where a ∈R and c ∈C. Finally,
f(z) = a z + c,
a ∈R and c ∈C,
is clearly analytic.
Then assume that ϕ(x) and ψ(y) in the real variables have complex values. Then by separation into
real and imaginary parts,
ϕ(x) = ϕ1(x) + i ϕ2(x)
and
ψ(y) = ψ1(y) + i ψ2(y),
hence
f(z)
=
ϕ(x) + i ψ(y)
=
{ϕ1(x) −ψ2(y)} + i {ϕ2(x) + ψ1(y)} ,
and by a separation into real and imaginary parts,
u(x, y) = ϕ1(x) −ψ2(y),
v(x, y) = ϕ2(x) + ψ1(y).
It follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that we get the conditions

1(x) = ∂v
∂y = ψ′
1(y)
∂u
∂y

−ψ′
2(y) = −∂v

and we conclude as above that there exist real constants a1 and a2, such that
ϕ′
1(x) = ψ′
1(y) = a1
and
ϕ′
2(x) = ψ′
2(y) = a2,
thus
ϕ1(x) = a1x + b11,
ψ1(y) = a1y + b12,
ϕ2(x) = a2x + b21,
ψ2(y) = a2y + b22,

Prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are equivalent to

Remark 6.7 One often says due to this result that the analytic functions only depend on z and not
on z. This claim can only be taken as a mnemonic rule, because ∂f
∂z is not the derivative of f with
respect to z. It is only a shorthand for

According to Example 6.14, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are equivalent to

thus
0 = ∂f

∂y = ∂f

and it follows that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are equivalent to

∂z = 0.

Example 6.16 Assume that f is analytic in a domain Ω and that
∂u
∂x + ∂v
∂y = 0
in Ω.
Prove that f ′ is constant in Ω.
It follows from Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that
0 = ∂u
∂x + ∂v
∂y = ∂u
∂x + ∂u
∂x = 2 ∂u
∂x,
hence
u(x, y) = u(y).
Analogously,
0 = ∂u
∂x + ∂v
∂y = ∂v
∂y + ∂v
∂y = 2 ∂v
∂y ,
hence
v(x, y) = v(x).
Then it follows from the second of Cauchy-Riemann’s equations that
∂u
∂y = u′(y) = −∂v
∂x = −v′(x),
independently of both x and y, hence the common value must be a real constant −c. Hereby we
obtain the derivative
f ′(z) = ∂u
∂x + i ∂v
∂x = 0 + i(+c) = i c,
c ∈R.

(b) Here it pays oﬀﬁrst to decompose. Since z3 −3z −2 has the root z = 2, we easily get the
expansion
z3 −3z −2 = (z −2)(z + 1)2.
Since
z2 −4 = (z −2)(z + 2),
we have the reduction
f(z) =
z2 −4
z3 −3z −2 =
z + 2
(z + 1)2 =
1
(z + 1)2 +
1
z + 1.
Hence the function f(z) is analytic in C \ {2, −1} with a removable singularity at z = 2. This
means that the domain of analyticity can be extended to C \ {−1}. In this extended domain the
derivative is given by
f ′(z) = −

(z + 1)2 −

(z + 1)3 = −z + 3

(c) We write the function in the following way,
f(z) = z + i
z −2 = 1 + 2 + i
z −2,
(note that we again start with a decomposition). This is clearly analytic in C \ {2}. Since we have
decomposed the function, it is very easy to compute the derivative,
f ′(z) = −
2 + i
(z −2)2 .
Remark 6.9 If we did not decompose before the diﬀerentiation, the computations would have
been somewhat larger, to put it mildly. ♦
(d) The function f(z) = i
z3 is analytic in C \ {0} and its derivative is
f ′(z) = −3i
z4 .
Example 6.18 Find the derivatives of the following analytic function in their domains:
(a) f(z) = z5 −3z2 −1,

.
(a) The function is deﬁned everywhere in C, and it follows from the elementary rules of computation
that
f ′(z) = 5z4 −6z.
(b) Here it is better to start with a decomposition,
f(z) =
z

(d) The function f(z) =

is deﬁned in C \ {−1}. Before the diﬀerentiation we note that

Example 6.19 (a) Check where in the complex plane the functions u and v, given by
u + iv = f(z) = (z)2 ,
satisfy Cauchy-Riemann’s equations.
(b) Is f(z) analytic at z = 0?
(a) Since
u + iv = (z)2 = (x −iy)2 = x2 −y2 −2ixy,
we get by a separation into the real and the imaginary parts that
u(x, y) = x2 −y2
and
v(x, y) = −2xy.
These functions are both of class C∞
R2
. Then
∂u
∂x = 2x,
∂v
∂y = −2x,
∂u
∂y = −2y,
∂v
∂x = −2y.
It follows that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled,
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y
for x = 0,
∂u
∂y = −∂v
∂x
for y = 0.
This proves that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations are only satisﬁed for z = 0.
(b) Since the domain of analyticity is always an open domain contained in the set where Cauchy-
Riemann’s equations are fulﬁlled, and since the set {(0, 0)} ∼{0} does not contain any open
domain, the function f(z) is not analytic at z = 0.

Remark 6.10 The diﬃcult thing here is that the function f(z) actually is complex diﬀerentiable
at 0. In fact, if z ̸= 0 we get for the diﬀerence quotient that

f(z) −f(0)
z −0
 =

(z)2
z
 = |z|2
|z| = |z| →0
for z →0,
and it follows that
f ′(0) = lim
z→0
f(z) −f(0)
z −0
= 0.
However, this does not assure that f(z) is analytic at z = 0. ♦
Example 6.20 We shall check the map w = z + z2, where z = x + iy and w = u + iv.
(a) Prove that the straight lines x = x0, where x0 is a real constant ̸= −1
2, is mapped into the
parabolas
(2) u = −
v2
(1 + 2x0)2 + x0 (x0 + 1) .
(b) Which curves are the images of y = y0, where y0 is a real constant ̸= 0?
(c) Find the image of x0 = −1
2, and the image of y0 = 0.
(d) Find a straight line x = x1, where x1 is a real constant ̸= x0, with the property that it is mapped
into (2).
(e) What are the image curves of the circles
z + 1
2
 = r0, where r0 is a positive constant?
(a) Since
w = f(z) = z + z2 = x + iy + (x + iy)2 = x + x2 −y2 + i(y + 2xy),
it follows by a separation of the real and the imaginary part that
(3) u(x, y) = x + x2 −y
and
v(x, y) = y(1 + 2x).
If therefore z(t) = x0 + i t, t ∈R, then it follows from (3) that
u(t) = x0 (x0 + 1) −t2
and
v(t) = (1 + 2x0) t,
t ∈R,
and the task has now been reduced to eliminating the parameter t.
If x0 ̸= −1
2, then t =
v
1 + 2x0
, hence by putting this into the expression of u gives (2), thus
u = −
v2
(+2x0)2 + x0 (x0 + 1) ,
x0 ∈R \

(b) If instead z(t) = t + iy0, t ∈R, y0 ̸= 0, then it follows from (3) that

and

thus the interval

(d) If x = x1 ̸= x0 and x0 ̸= −1

It follows from x1 ̸= x0 that x1 = −1 −x0. Using this value we get
(1 + 2x1)2 = (1 −2 −2x0)2 = (1 + 2x0)2 ,
and we conclude that the two parabolas are identical.
(e) Finally, we shall ﬁnd the images of the circles

Example 7.1 Prove that the complex function f(z), which is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) by

z = r eiθ,
is analytic in the sliced domain
Ω =

z = r eiθ | r ∈R+, θ ∈] −π, π[

where we have removed the closed real negative axis. Then ﬁnd its derivative.
Given that 0 does not belong to the domain Ω, and that
u(r, θ) = √r · cos θ
2
and
v(r, θ) = √r · sin θ

are of class C∞in this domain, we shall only check that the Cauchy-Riemann equations in polar

Example 7.2 Prove that the complex function f(z), which is given in polar coordinates (r, θ) by

It follows immediately from x = r cos θ and y = r · sin θ that
f(z) = ex cos y + i ex sin y = ex(cos y + i sin y) = exeiy = ez,
thus f(z) = ez is analytic with the derivative
f ′(z) = ez = f(z).
Alternatively we prove that Cauchy-Riemann’s equations in polar coordinates are satisﬁed. First
note that 0 does not belong to the domain. Then by a separation of the real and the imaginary parts,
u(r, θ) = er cos θ cos(r sin θ),
v(r, θ) = er cos θ sin(r sin θ),

Example 7.4 Sketch the curves u(x, y) = constant and v(x, y) = constant in the domains of the
following functions:
(a) f(z) = z3,
(b) f(z) = ez,
(x) f(z) = Log z.
(a) We have in rectangular coordinates
f(z) = (x + iy)3 = x3 −3xy2 + i

3x2y −y3
,
thus
(4) u(x, y) = x3 −3sy2,
v(x, y) = 3x2y −y3,
If we instead use polar coordinate, then
f(z) = r3e3iθ = r3 cos 3θ + i r3 sin 3θ,
hence
u(r, θ) = r3 cos 3θ,
v(r, θ) = r3 sin 3θ.
Empirically the treatment of systems of curves of e.g. the form
u(x, y) = c,
is often causing some diﬃculties. Hence we shall go through this example in more detail than
usually. We shall restrict ourselves to consider only the rectangular version (4).
First we consider the curves u(x, y) = c. If we insert a point (x, y), we only obtain one value of
the constant c. Hence we conclude that curves belonging to diﬀerent values of c do not intersect.

which intersect at (0, 0). Any other curve of the type u(x, y) = c, c ̸= 0, is now conﬁned to one
of the six open angular spaces. Furthermore, the lines corresponding to c = 0 must be asymptotes
for any other curve u(x, y) = c, where c ̸= 0.

and the corresponding angular spaces. Let (x0, y0) be a point on the claimed asymptote, and let
(x, y) be a point on the curve. Then
x3
0 −3x0y2
0 = 0
and
x3 −3xy2 = c.
If we here put x0 = x, it follows that the distance from the curve to one of the lines is smaller
than or equal to either
|y −y0|
or
|y −(−y0)| = |y + y0| .
Therefore, we shall only prove that one of these two distances tends towards zero, when x = x0 →
±∞. When we subtract the two equations, we get
3x0

y2 −y2

= c,
thus
y2 −y2
0
 = |y −y0| · |y + y0| =

c
3x0
 .
Since the right hand side tends towards zero for x0 →±∞, at least one of the two factors |y −y0|
and |y + y0| will tend towards zero by the same limit, and the claim is proved.
Then we threat the v-curves, either in the same way, or by using that the v-curves are orthogonal
to the u-curves. A third method is simply by the symmetry to interchange x and y.

(b) We have in rectangular coordinates
f(z) = ex cos y + i ex sin y,
hence by separating the real and the imaginary part,
u(x, y) = ex cos y,
v(x, y) = ex sin y.
In this case it is very diﬃcult to handle the polar description, so we shall only consider the
rectangular version.
We ﬁrst investigate the u-curves
ex cos y = c,
c ∈R.
If c = 0, then cos y = 0, and we get the horizontal lines
y = π
2 + pπ,
p ∈Z.
The curves corresponding to c ̸= 0 must now be restricted to the horizontal “strips”, deﬁned by
the curves corresponding to c = 0. If c ̸= 0, it follows from the equation
ex cos y = c,
that cos y and c must have the same sign, thus
y ∈
(
−π
2 + 2pπ , π
2 + 2pπ
'
,
p ∈Z, if c > 0,
and
y ∈
&π
2 + 2pπ , 3π
2 + 2pπ
%
,
p ∈Z, if c < 0.
One may say that every second of the horizontal strips belong to positive c, and every second to
negative c.
The point is that the equation can now be written, such that x is expressed as a function of y.
This is due to the fact that Arccos is a somewhat diﬃcult function, while cos is not. If c and cos y
have the same sign, then
x = ln
	
c
cos y

.
The minimum of x is obtained when | cos y| = 1, corresponding to y = qπ, q ∈Z, and x = ln |c|.
We note that this minimum is negative, if |c| < 1. If y approaches one of the boundary “curves”,
±π
2 +qπ, q ∈Z, then the denominator tends towards 0, thus x →+∞. Hence, the horizontal lines
y = ±π
2 + qπ,
q ∈Z,
corresponding to the system of curves for c = 0, become the asymptotes. It follows from
x = ln |c| −ln | cos y|,

so the v-curves are obtained from the u-curves by a translation of the amount i π

r > 0,
θ ∈] −π, π],
thus
u(r, θ) = ln r
and
v(r, θ) = θ.

The curves u(r, θ) = c are the circles r = ec, and the curves v(r, θ) = c are the half lines θ = c ∈
] −π, π], where we usually include θ = π, which gives a discontinuity in the function Arg z.
The point z = 0 is a singular point.
We interpret this situation as the model of a point source at z = 0, where the v-curves denote the
streamlines and the u-curves denote the equipotential curves.

Log⋆z by
Log⋆z = ln |z| + i θ,
where θ is the argument of z, z = r eiθ, for which θ ∈[0, 2π[.
Consider the complex potential
F(z) = zc := ecLog
⋆z.
Write z = r eiθ. Prove that the half lines θ = 0 and θ = π
c are streamlines.
(Hence, the pattern of the ﬂow does not change, if we put barriers along these half lines).

If we put u(x, y) = c, then we get by solving with respect to y that
y2 = e2c−2x −x2 = C e−2x −x2,
y > 0,
where we have put C = e2c > 0.
Analogously, from v(x, y) = k we get by solving with respect to x that
x = y · cot(k −y).
Example 7.7 Let
F(z) = c Log(z −a) + c Log(z + a),
where a, c ∈R+ are given constants. We consider F in its domain Ω as a complex potential. Find
the streamlines and the equipotential curves of F in Ω.
This example can be interpreted as the model of two sources of the same strength at the points z = a
and z = −a.
Obviously, we may choose c = 1 and a = 1, so we only consider
F(z) = Log(z −1) + Log(z + 1),
z ∈C \ (] −∞, 1]),
where we must be aware of the branch cuts of the two principal logarithms. A separation into real
and imaginary part gives
u(x, y) = ln |z −1| + ln |z + 1| = ln
z2 −1
 ,
and
v(x, y) = Arg(z −1) + Arg(z + 1).
The curves
u(x, y) = ln
z2 −1
 = k,
thus
|z −1| · |z + 1| = c,
are the so-called Cassini’s rings. These are the equipotential curves. I have not been able to let
MAPLE give some reasonable sketches, so they are here omitted. On the other hand, it is easy to
sketch the streamlines by using MAPLE, and then we may use that the equipotential curves are
orthogonal on this system of curves.
It follows from
v(0, y) = Arg(−1 + iy) + Arg(1 + iy) = ±π,
that the positive and the negative y-axis each form a streamline.
Since
cot(u + v) = cot u · cot v −1
cos u + cot v ,

This expression is extended by the obvious symmetry to the lower half plane. Hence the curve system
becomes a system of hyperbolic arcs with the y-axis as one of their asymptotes, and where they all
pass through either (1, 0) or (−1, 0). We shall of course add the lines x = −1 and x = 1 to this system.

(c) Since the numerator and the denominator have the same degree, and since z = 1 is a root of both

Furthermore, f2(z) = −4

Example 9.2 Assume that f : [0, +∞[ →C is continuous and that f(t) = 0 for t > R. Prove that
the function L{f}, given by
L{f}(z) =
 +∞
0
f(t) e−zt dt
is analytic in all of C.
Assume that f : [0, +∞[ →C is continuous and that there exist constants A, B > 0, such that
|f(t)| ≤A eBt
for every t ∈[0, +∞[.
Prove that one can ﬁnd a σ ∈R, such that the function
L{f}(z) =
 +∞
0
f(t) e−zt dt
is analytic in the half plane Re(z) > σ.
We call the analytic function L{f}(z) the Laplace-transformed of f. The smallest real number σ0,
for which L{f}(z) is analytic in the half plane Re(z) > σ0, is called the abscissa of convergence.
When f : [0, +∞[ →C is continuous, and f(t) = 0 for t > R, then the support of f is compact, so
|f(t)|, which is also continuous, must have a maximum. In particular, f is bounded,
|f(t)| ≤M
for every t ≥0,

and we get for every ﬁxed z ∈C that

e−(x+iy)t dt = M

e−xt dt < +∞.
We conclude that L{f}(z) is deﬁned for every z ∈C.
Since the integrand f(t) e−zt is continuous in t and since the derivative with respect to the parameter
z is continuous and absolutely integrable, it follows that L{f}(z) is continuously diﬀerentiable, and
its derivative is


f(t) e−zt
dt = −
 +∞

t f(t) e−zt dt,
which proves that L{f}(z) is analytic in all of C.
Then we assume that
|f(t)| ≤A eBt
for every t ∈[0, +∞[.
If σ > B, then we get for Re(z) ≥σ that


 ≤
 +∞
0
A eBt e−tRe(x) dt ≤A
 +∞

e(σ−B)t dt < +∞,
so the Laplace-transform exists for every z, for which Re(z) ≥σ.
When we diﬀerentiate the integrand with respect to the parameter z, then
∂


f(t) e−zt
= −t f(t) e−zt.
If Re(z) ≥σ > b, then we have the estimate

∂


f(t) e−zt ≤A t eBt e−σt = A t e−(σ−B)t,
t ≥0.
It follows from the magnitudes that
∂
∂z {f(t) e−zt} has an integrable majoring function, thus we
conclude that L{f} is complex diﬀerentiable (and even continuously diﬀerentiable) for Re(z) > σ.
This proves that L{f}(z) is analytic in the half plane Re(z) > σ.

Example 9.4 Assume that f is analytic in an open domain Ω. Deﬁne Ω⋆by
Ω⋆= {z | z ∈Ω},
and a function f ⋆on Ω⋆by
f ⋆(z) = f(x).
Prove that f ⋆is analytic in Ω⋆.
Obviously, f ⋆is continuous and of class C∞(Ω⋆). Write f = u + iv, i.e.
f(z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y).
Then
f ⋆(z)
=

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

This inequality holds for every r > r0 and for every ﬁxed z0. We therefore conclude that

.
(a) Using polar coordinates (r, θ), where z = r eiθ, ﬁnd an equation of the equipotential curves and
an equation of the streamlines.
(b) Then ﬁnd the complex ﬁeld of velocity F ′(z), the x and y parts of the real ﬁeld of velocity V, and
the speed |V| of the ﬁeld corresponding to (5), where everything should be expressed as functions
in (r, θ).
The function F1/ζ) = −A
ζ , where ζ = ξ + i η and A > 0 is a constant, models a ﬁeld of a dipole
where the dipole is lying in ζ = 0 of strength A and of orientation in the positive ξ-direction.
Find a transformation of the form z = ζ eiα (where α is a real constant), such that F(z) = F1(ζ).
Apply this result to show that the ﬁeld corresponding to (5) is a ﬁeld of a dipole. Find the position
and strength of the dipole, and show its orientation on a sketch.

which is the wanted transformation.
Since the orientation corresponds to the positive ξ-axis, it follows that the orientation of the given
