The Bittinger Program
Math hasn’t changed, but students—and the way they learn it—have.
Basic College Mathematics, 12th Edition, continues the Bittinger tradition of 
­objective-based, guided learning, while integrating timely updates to the proven 
pedagogy. In this edition, there is a greater emphasis on guided learning and helping 
students get the most out of all of the course resources available with the Bittinger 
program, including new opportunities for mobile learning. 
The program has expanded to include these comprehensive new teaching and 
learning resources: MyMathGuide workbook, To-the-Point Objective Videos, and 
enhanced, media-rich MyMathLab courses. Feedback from instructors and students 
motivated these and several other significant improvements: a new design to support 
guided learning, new figures and photos to help students visualize both concepts and 
applications, and many new and updated real-data applications to bring the math  
to life. 
With so many resources available in so many formats, the trusted guidance of the 
Bittinger team on what to do and when will help today’s math students stay on task. 
Students are encouraged to use Your Guide to Success in Math, a four-step learning 
path and checklist. The guide will help students identify the resources in the textbook, 
supplements, and MyMathLab that support their learning style, as they develop and 
retain the skills and conceptual understanding they need to succeed in this and future 
courses.
In this preface, a look at the key new and hallmark resources and features of the 
Basic College Mathematics program—including the textbook/eText, video program, 
MyMathGuide workbook, and MyMathLab—is organized around Your Guide to  
Success in Math. This will help instructors direct students to the tools and ­resources that 
will help them most in a traditional lecture, hybrid, lab-based, or online ­environment. 
neW and HallmarK FeatUreS in Relation to 
your Guide to Success in Math
Step 1  Learn the Skills and Concepts
Students have several options for learning, reviewing, and practicing the math con-
cepts and skills. 
Textbook/eText
	
Skill to Review. At the beginning of nearly every text section, Skill to Review offers a 
just-in-time review of a previously presented skill that relates to the new material in the 
section. Section and objective references are included for the student’s convenience, 
and two practice exercises are provided for review and reinforcement. 
	
Margin Exercises. For each objective, problems labeled “Do Exercise . . .” give stu-
dents frequent opportunities to solve exercises while they learn. 
	
New!  Guided Solutions. Nearly every section has Guided Solution margin exer-
cises with fill-in blanks at key steps in the problem-solving process.
Preface

	
Enhanced!  MyMathLab. MyMathLab now includes Active Learning Figures for 
directed exploration of concepts; more problem types, including Reading Checks 
and Guided Solutions; and new, objective-based videos. (See pp. 16–19 for a 
­detailed description of the features of MyMathLab.)
	
New!  To-the-Point Objective Videos. This is a comprehensive new program of 
­objective-based, interactive videos that are incorporated into the Learning Path 
in MyMathLab and can be used hand-in-hand with the MyMathGuide workbook.
	 New! 
Interactive Your Turn Exercises. For each objective in the videos, 
students solve exercises and receive instant feedback on their work.
	
New! 
MyMathGuide: Notes, Practice, and Video Path. This is an objective-
based workbook (available in MyMathLab) for guided, hands-on learning. 
It offers vocabulary, skill, and concept review—along with problem-solving 
­practice—with space to show work and write notes. Incorporated in the Learn-
ing Path in MyMathLab, it can be used together with the To-the-Point ­Objective 
Video program, instructor lectures, and the textbook.
Step 2  Check Your Understanding
Throughout the program, students have frequent opportunities to check their work 
and confirm that they understand each skill and concept before moving on to the 
next topic.
	 New!   Reading Checks. At the beginning of each set of section exercises in the text, 
students demonstrate their grasp of the skills and concepts.
	 New!  Active Learning Figures. In MyMathLab, Active Learning Figures guide stu-
dents in exploring math concepts and reinforcing their understanding.
	 Translating for Success. In the text and in MyMathLab, these activities offer stu-
dents extra practice with the important first step of the process for solving applied 
problems.
Step 3  Do Your Homework
Basic College Mathematics, 12th Edition, has a wealth of proven and updated exer-
cises. 
  	 Skill Maintenance. In each section, these exercises offer a thorough review of the 
math in the preceding text. 
	 Synthesis Exercises. To help build critical-thinking skills, these section exercises 
require students to use what they know and combine learning objectives from the 
current section with those from previous sections.
Step 4  Review and Test Your Understanding
Students have a variety of resources to check their skills and understanding along 
the way and to help them prepare for tests.
	 Mid-Chapter Review. Mid-way through each chapter, students work a set of exer-
cises (Concept Reinforcement, Guided Solutions, Mixed Review, and Understanding 
Through Discussion and Writing) to confirm that they have grasped the skills and 
concepts covered in the first half before moving on to new material.
	 Summary and Review. This resource provides an in-text opportunity for active 
learning and review for each chapter. Vocabulary Reinforcement, Concept Rein-
forcement, objective-based Study Guide (examples paired with similar exercises), 
Review Exercises (including Synthesis problems), and Understanding Through 
Discussion and Writing are included in these comprehensive chapter reviews.

PreFaCe
	 Chapter Test. Chapter Tests offer students the opportunity for comprehensive 
review and reinforcement prior to taking their instructor’s exam. ­Chapter Test-
Prep Videos (in MyMathLab and on YouTube) show step-by-step solutions to the 
Chapter Tests. 
	 Cumulative Review. Following every chapter beginning with Chapter 3, a Cumu-
lative Review revisits skills and concepts from all preceding chapters to help stu-
dents retain previously learned material. 
Study Skills
Developing solid time-management, note-taking, test-taking, and other study skills is 
key to student success in math courses (as well as professionally and personally). In-
structors can direct students to related study skills resources as needed.
	 New!  Studying for Success. Checklists of study skills—designed to ensure that 
students develop the skills they need to succeed in math, school, and life—are 
integrated throughout the text at the beginning of selected sections. 
	 New!  Study Skills Modules. In MyMathLab, interactive modules address com-
mon areas of weakness, including time-management, test-taking, and note-­
taking skills. Additional modules support career-readiness.
	 New!  Student Study Reference. At a Glance, provided at the end of this book, lists 
the key information and expressions for quick reference as students work exercises 
and review for tests.
learning math in Context
	 New!  Applications. Throughout the text in examples and exercises, real-data 
­applications encourage students to see and interpret the mathematics that appears 
every day in the world around them. Applications that use real data are drawn 
from business and economics, life and physical sciences, medicine, technology, 
and areas of general interest such as sports and daily life. New applications include 
“Fastest-Growing Occupations” (p. 90), “Training Regimens” (p. 210), “Media  
Usage” (p. 309), and “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” (p. 337). For a complete 
list of applications, please refer to the Index of Applications (p. 7).

A digit is a number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 that names a place-value 
location. For large numbers, digits are separated by commas into groups of 
three, called periods. Each period has a name: ones, thousands, millions, 
billions, trillions, and so on. To understand the number of jobs for registered 
nurses in the table above, we can use a place-value chart, as shown below.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
The number of families assisted in the Americas was 934,871. This 
number is expressed in standard notation. We write expanded notation 
for 934,871 as follows:
 934,871 = 9 hundred thousands + 3 ten thousands
 + 4 thousands + 8 hundreds
 + 7 tens + 1 one.
example 7 
Write expanded notation for 1815 ft, the height of the CN 
Tower in Toronto, Canada.
1815 = 1 thousand + 8 hundreds + 1 ten + 5 ones
example 8  Write expanded notation for 407,640, the number of fami-
lies in Asia and the South Pacific assisted by Heifer International in 2011.
 407,640 = 4 hundred thousands + 0 ten thousands
 + 7 thousands + 6 hundreds + 4 tens + 0 ones
or
4 hundred thousands + 7 thousands + 6 hundreds + 4 tens
Do Exercises 8–11.
 c 	Converting Between Standard Notation 
and Word Names
We often use word names for numbers. When we pronounce a number, 
we are speaking its word name. Russia won 82 medals in the 2012 Sum-
mer Olympics in London, Great Britain. A word name for 82 is “eighty-two.” 
Word names for some two-digit numbers like 36, 51, and 72 use hyphens. 
Others like that for 17 use only one word, “seventeen.”

For word names for larger numbers, we begin at the left with the larg-
est period. The number named in the period is followed by the name of 
the period; then a comma is written and the next number and period are 
named. Note that the name of the ones period is not included in the word 
name for a whole number.
example 12  Write a word name for 46,605,314,732.
Forty-six billion,

The word “and” should not appear in word names for whole numbers. 
Although we commonly hear such expressions as “two hundred and one,” 
the use of “and” is not, strictly speaking, correct in word names for whole 
numbers. For decimal notation, it is appropriate to use “and” for the deci-
mal point. For example, 317.4 is read as “three hundred seventeen and four 
tenths.”

SECTION  1.2  Addition
Add ones. We get 13 ones, or 1 ten + 3 ones.  
Write 3 in the ones column and 1 above the tens.  
This is called carrying, or regrouping.
Add tens. We get 17 tens, so we have 10 tens + 7 tens.  
This is also 1 hundred + 7 tens. Write 7 in the tens 
column and 1 above the hundreds.
Add hundreds. We get 18 hundreds.
 a 	 Addition of Whole Numbers
To answer questions such as “How many?”, “How much?”, and “How tall?”, 
we often use whole numbers. The set, or collection, of whole numbers is
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, c .
The set goes on indefinitely. There is no largest whole number, and the 
smallest whole number is 0. Each whole number can be named using vari-
ous notations. The set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, c , without 0, is called the set of natu-
ral numbers.
Addition of whole numbers corresponds to combining things together.
3 cards

We say that the sum of 3 and 2 is 5. The numbers added are called 
­addends. The addition that corresponds to the figure above is
3 +   2 =  5.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
How do we perform an addition of three numbers, like 2 + 3 + 6? We 
could do it by adding 3 and 6, and then 2. We can show this with parentheses:
2 + 13 + 62 = 2 + 9 = 11.    Parentheses tell what to do first.
We could also add 2 and 3, and then 6:
12 + 32 + 6 = 5 + 6 = 11.
Either way the result is 11. It does not matter how we group the numbers. This 
illustrates the associative law of addition, a + 1b + c2 = 1a + b2 + c. 
We can also add whole numbers in any order. That is, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2. This 
­illustrates the commutative law of addition, a + b = b + a. ­Together, the 
commutative and associative laws tell us that to add more than two num-
bers, we can use any order and grouping we wish. Adding 0 to a number does 
not change the number: a + 0 = 0 + a = a. That is, 6 + 0 = 0 + 6 = 6, 
or 198 + 0 = 0 + 198 = 198. We say that 0 is the additive identity.

This is also 3 hundreds + 5 tens. Write 5 in the tens

Minuend  Subtrahend  Difference
The minuend is the number from which another number is being sub-
tracted. The subtrahend is the number being subtracted. The difference is 
the result of subtracting the subtrahend from the minuend.
In the subtraction above, note that the difference, 4, is the number we 
add to 2 to get 6. This illustrates the relationship between addition and 
subtraction and leads us to the following definition of subtraction.

Subtraction
The difference a - b is that unique whole number c for which 
a = c + b.
We see that 6 - 2 = 4 because 4 + 2 = 6.
To subtract whole numbers, we subtract the ones digits first, then the 
tens digits, then the hundreds, then the thousands, and so on.

Subtract ones.
We cannot subtract the tens because there is no whole number that when 
added to 6 gives 4. To complete the subtraction, we must borrow 1 hundred 
from 3 hundreds and regroup it with the 4 tens. Then we can do the sub-
traction 14 tens - 6 tens = 8 tens.

When you write a multiplication corresponding to a real-world situa-
tion, you should think of either a rectangular array or repeated addition. In 
some cases, it may help to think both ways.
We have used an “*” to denote multiplication. A dot “ # ” is also com-
monly used. (Use of the dot is attributed to the German mathematician 
Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz over three centuries ago.) Parentheses are 
also used to denote multiplication. For example,
3 * 5 = 3 # 5 = 132152 = 3152 = 15.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
The product of 0 and any whole number is 0: 0 # a = a # 0 = 0. For 
­example, 0 # 3 = 3 # 0 = 0. Multiplying a number by 1 does not change 
the number: 1 # a = a # 1 = a. For example, 1 # 3 = 3 # 1 = 3. We say 
that 1 is the multiplicative identity.

Do Exercises 1–4.
    Multiply the 4 ones by 5: 5 # 14 ones2 = 20 ones 
= 2 tens + 0 ones. Write 0 in the ones column  
and 2 above the tens.
    Multiply the 3 tens by 5 and add 2 tens:
    5 # 13 tens2 = 15 tens, 15 tens + 2 tens = 17 tens 
= 1 hundred + 7 tens. Write 7 in the tens column  
and 1 above the hundreds.
    Multiply the 7 hundreds by 5 and add 1 hundred: 
5 # 17 hundreds2 = 35 hundreds, 35 hundreds
+ 1 hundred = 36 hundreds.
Multiplication of whole numbers is based on a property called the dis-
tributive law. It says that to multiply a number by a sum, a # 1b + c2, we 
can multiply each addend by a and then add like this: 1a # b2 + 1a # c2. 
Thus, a # 1b + c2 = 1a # b2 + 1a # c2. For example, consider the following.
4 # 12 + 32 = 4 # 5 = 20	
Adding first;  
	
then multiplying
4 # 12 + 32 = 14 # 22 + 14 # 32 = 8 + 12 = 20    Multiplying first; 
then adding
The results are the same, so 4 # 12 + 32 = 14 # 22 + 14 # 32.
Let’s find the product 51 * 32. Since 32 = 2 + 30, we can think of this 
product as
51 * 32 = 51 * 12 + 302 = 151 * 22 + 151 * 302.
That is, we multiply 51 by 2, then we multiply 51 by 30, and finally we add. 
We can write our work in columns.

Do Exercises 13–16.
When we multiply two numbers, we can change the order of the 
numbers without changing their product. For example, 3 # 6 = 18 and 
6 # 3 = 18. This illustrates the commutative law of multiplication: 
a # b = b # a.
Do Exercise 17.
To multiply three or more numbers, we group them so that we multiply 
two at a time. Consider 2 # 3 # 4. We can group these numbers as 2 # 13 # 42 
or as 12 # 32 # 4. The parentheses tell what to do first:
2 # 13 # 42 = 2 # 1122 = 24.    We multiply 3 and 4 and then that 
product by 2.
We can also multiply 2 and 3 and then that product by 4:
12 # 32 # 4 = 162 # 4 = 24.
Either way we get 24. It does not matter how we group the numbers. This 
illustrates the associative law of multiplication: a # 1b # c2 = 1a # b2 # c.
Do Exercises 18 and 19.
 b 	 Finding Area
We can think of the area of a rectangular region as the number of square

Tis is a square

In this case, we have a rectangular array of 3 rows, each of which con-

A = l # w = 3 cm # 4 cm = 12 sq cm.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
 a 	Division of Whole Numbers
Repeated Subtraction
Division of whole numbers applies to two kinds of situations. The first is re-
peated subtraction. Suppose we have 20 doughnuts, and we want to find out 
how many sets of 5 there are. One way to do this is to repeatedly ­subtract sets 
of 5 as follows.
20 doughnuts
How many 
sets of 5
doughnuts each?
4
1
2
3
Since there are 4 sets of 5 doughnuts each, we have
20 ,  5 =  4.
 	
	
  
      Dividend Divisor Quotient
The division 20 , 5 is read “20 divided by 5.” The dividend is 20, the 
­divisor is 5, and the quotient is 4. We divide the dividend by the divisor to 
get the quotient. We can also express the division 20 , 5 = 4 as
20
5 = 4  or 
4
5)20.
Rectangular Arrays
We can also think of division in terms of rectangular arrays. Consider 
again the 20 doughnuts and division by 5. We can arrange the doughnuts 
in a rectangular array with 5 rows and ask, “How many are in each row?”
We can also consider a rectangular array with 5 doughnuts in each 
­column and ask, “How many columns are there?” The answer is still 4.
In each case, we are asking, “What do we multiply 5 by in order to get 20?”

SECTION  1.5  Division
This definition shows the relation between division and ­multiplication. 
We see, for instance, that
20 , 5 = 4 because 20 = 5 # 4.
This relation allows us to use multiplication to check division.
example 1  Divide. Check by multiplying.
	a)	 16 , 8	
b)  36
4 	
c)  7)56
We do so as follows.
	a)	 16 , 8 = 2	
Check:  8 # 2 = 16.
	b)	 36
4 = 9	
Check:  4 # 9 = 36.
	c)	
8
7)56	
Check:  7 # 8 = 56.
Do Exercises 1–3.
Let’s consider some basic properties of division.
Division
The quotient a , b, where b is not 0, is that unique number c for 
which a = b # c.
Dividing by 1
Any number divided by 1 is that same number:  a , 1 = a
1 = a.
For example, 6 , 1 = 6 and 15
1 = 15.
Dividing a Number by Itself
Any nonzero number divided by itself is 1:  a , a = a
a = 1,  a ≠0.
For example, 7 , 7 = 1 and 22
22 = 1.
Dividends of 0
Zero divided by any nonzero number is 0:  0 , a = 0
a = 0,  a ≠0.
For example, 0 , 14 = 0 and 0
3 = 0.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
Why can’t we divide by 0? Suppose the number 4 could be divided by 0. 
Then if   
  were the answer, we would have
4 , 0 =  
 ,
and since 0 times any number is 0, we would have
4 =
# 0 = 0.    False!
Thus, the only possible number that could be divided by 0 would be 0 itself. 
But such a division would give us any number we wish. For instance,
0 , 0 = 8
because
0 = 8 # 0;
0 , 0 = 3
because
0 = 3 # 0;
0 , 0 = 7
because
0 = 7 # 0.
s    All true!
We avoid the preceding difficulties by agreeing to exclude division by 0.
Do Exercises 8–9.
Division with a Remainder
Suppose everyone in a group of 22 people wants to ride a roller coaster. If 
each car on the ride holds 6 people, the group will fill 3 cars and there will 
be 4 people left over.
We can think of this situation as the following division. The people left 
over are the remainder.

Adding the remainder. The result is the dividend.
We now show a procedure for dividing whole numbers.
example 2  Divide and check: 4 ) 3 4 5 7.
First, we try to divide the first digit of the dividend, 3, by the divisor, 4. Since 
3 , 4 is not a whole number, we consider the first two digits of the dividend.
8 
4 )  3 4 5 7

     
Since 4 # 8 = 32 and 32 is smaller than 34, we write an 
8 in the quotient above the 4. We also write 32 below 34 
and subtract.
What if we had chosen a number other than 8 for the first digit of the quo-
tient? Suppose we had used 7 instead of 8 and subtracted 4 # 7, or  28, from 
34. The result would have been 34 - 28, or 6. Because 6 is larger than the di-
visor, 4, we know that there is at least one more factor of 4 in 34, and thus 7 is 
too small. If we had used 9 instead of 8, then we would have tried to subtract 
4 # 9, or 36, from 34. That difference is not a whole number, so we know 9 is 
too large. When we subtract, the difference must be smaller than the divisor.
Let’s continue dividing.

    
Now we bring down the 5 in the dividend and consider 
25 , 4. Since 4 # 6 = 24 and 24 is smaller than 25, 
we write 6 in the quotient above the 5. We also write 
24 ­below 25 and subtract. The difference, 1, is smaller 
than the divisor, so we know that 6 is the correct choice.

We bring down the 7 and consider 17 , 4. Since 
4 # 4 = 16 and 16 is smaller than 17, we write 4 in the 
quotient above the 7. We also write 16 below 17 and 
subtract.
Check:  864 # 4 = 3456 and 3456 + 1 = 3457.
The answer is 864 R 1.

Dividing Whole Numbers 
To divide whole numbers on a calculator, we use 
the ,  and =  keys.
When we enter 453 , 15, the display reads 
30.2  . Note that the result 
is not a whole number. This tells us that there is a remainder. The number 30.2 is 
expressed in decimal notation. The symbol “.” is called a decimal point. Although it 
is possible to use the number to the right of the decimal point to find the remain-
der, we will not do so here.

SECTION  1.6  Rounding and Estimating; Order
 a 	 Rounding
We round numbers in various situations when we do not need an exact 
­answer. For example, we might round to see if we are being charged the cor-
rect amount in a store. We might also round to check if an answer to a prob-
lem is reasonable or to check a calculation done by hand or on a calculator.
To understand how to round, we first look at some examples using the 
number line. The number line displays numbers at equally spaced intervals.
example 1  Round 47 to the nearest ten.
47 is between 40 and 50. Since 47 is closer to 50, we round up to 50.

example 2  Round 42 to the nearest ten.
42 is between 40 and 50. Since 42 is closer to 40, we round down to 40.

example 3  Round 45 to the nearest ten.

	b)	 Consider the next digit to the right, 5.
7 8 , 5 9 5
	c)	 Since that digit, 5, is 5 or higher, round 9 tens to 10 tens. We think of  
10 tens as 1 hundred + 0 tens and increase the hundreds digit by 1, to 
get 6 hundreds + 0 tens. We then write 6 in the hundreds place and 0 in 
the tens place.
	d)	 Change the digit to the right of the tens digit to zero.

CHAPTER  1  Whole Numbers
In the sentence 7 - 5 = 2, the equals sign indicates that 7 - 5 is the 
same as 2. When we round to make an estimate, the outcome is rarely the 
same as the exact result. Thus we cannot use an equals sign when we round. 
Instead, we use the symbol ≈. This symbol means “is ­approximately 
equal to.” In Example 9, for instance, we could have written
9324 - 2849 ≈6000.
example 10 
Estimate the following product by first rounding to the 
nearest ten and then to the nearest hundred:  683 * 457.
Nearest ten:
   6 8 0
*     4 6 0
 4 0 8 0 0

A sentence like 8 + 5 = 13 is called an equation. It is a true equation. The 
equation 4 + 8 = 11 is a false equation.
A sentence like 7 6 11 is called an inequality. The sentence 7 6 11 is 
a true inequality. The sentence 23 7 69 is a false inequality.
Some common inequality symbols follow.
Inequality Symbols
6

means  “is greater than”
≠  means  “is not equal to”
We know that 2 is not the same as 5. We express this by the sentence 
2 ≠5. We also know that 2 is less than 5. We symbolize this by the expres-
sion 2 6 5. We can see this order on the number line: 2 is to the left of 5. 
The number 0 is the smallest whole number.

Solve simple equations by trial.
	
Solve equations like  
t + 28 = 54, 28 # x = 168,  
and 98 # 2 = y.
a
b
 a 	Solutions by Trial
Let’s find a number that we can put in the blank to make this sentence true:
9 = 3 +
.
We are asking “9 is 3 plus what number?” The answer is 6.
9 = 3 + 6
Do Margin Exercises 1 and 2.
A sentence with = is called an equation. A solution of an equation is a 
number that makes the sentence true. Thus, 6 is a solution of
9 = 3 +  
  because 9 = 3 + 6 is true.
However, 7 is not a solution of
9 = 3 +
  because 9 = 3 + 7 is false.
Do Exercises 3 and 4.
We can use a letter in an equation instead of a blank:
9 = 3 + n.
We call n a variable because it can represent any number. If a replacement for a 
variable makes an equation true, the replacement is a solution of the equation.

Solutions of an Equation
A solution of an equation is a replacement for the variable that makes 
the equation true. When we find all the solutions, we say that we have 
solved the equation.
example 1  Solve y + 12 = 27 by trial.
We replace y with several numbers.
If we replace y with 13, we get a false equation: 13 + 12 = 27.
If we replace y with 14, we get a false equation: 14 + 12 = 27.
If we replace y with 15, we get a true equation: 15 + 12 = 27.
No other replacement makes the equation true, so the solution is 15.

SECTION  1.7  Solving Equations
 b 	Solving Equations
We now begin to develop more efficient ways to solve certain equations. 
When an equation has a variable alone on one side and a calculation on the 
other side, we can find the solution by carrying out the calculation.
example 4  Solve:  x = 245 * 34.
To solve the equation, we carry out the calculation.
2 4 5
*  3 4
9 8 0
7 3 5 0
8 3 3 0
     
x = 245 * 34
	
x = 8330
The solution is 8330.
Do Exercises 9–12.
Look at the equation
x + 12 = 27.
We can get x alone by subtracting 12 on both sides. Thus,
 x + 12 - 12 = 27 - 12    Subtracting 12 on both sides
 x + 0 = 15
    Carrying out the subtraction
 x = 15.

Solving x + a = b
To solve x + a = b, subtract a on both sides.
If we can get an equation in a form with the variable alone on one side, 
we can “see” the solution.
example 5  Solve:  t + 28 = 54.
We have
 t + 28 = 54
 t + 28 - 28 = 54 - 28    Subtracting 28 on both sides
 t + 0 = 26
 t = 26.
To check the answer, we substitute 26 for t in the original equation.
Check:     t + 28 = 54
26 + 28  ?  54

We have
 182 = 65 + n
 182 - 65 = 65 + n - 65    Subtracting 65 on both sides 
 117 = 0 + n
    65 plus n minus 65 is 0 + n.

 7381 + x - 7381 = 8067 - 7381  Subtracting 7381 on both sides
 x = 686.
Check: 
7381 + x = 8067
7381 + 686  ?   8067
	
8067          true
The solution is 686.
Do Exercises 16 and 17.
We now learn to solve equations like 8 # n = 96. Look at
8 # n = 96.
We can get n alone by dividing by 8 on both sides. Thus,
 8 # n
8
= 96
8     Dividing by 8 on both sides
  
 n = 12.     8 times n divided by 8 is n.
To check the answer, we substitute 12 for n in the original equation.
Check:  8 # n = 96
8 # 12 ?    96

a
 a 	 A Problem-Solving Strategy
One of the most important ways in which we use mathematics is as a tool 
in solving problems. To solve a problem, we use the following five-step 
strategy.
Five Steps for Problem Solving
	 1.	 Familiarize yourself with the problem situation.
	 2.	 Translate the problem to an equation using a variable.
	 3.	 Solve the equation.

	1.	 Familiarize. 
First, we assign a letter, or variable, to the number we 
wish to find. We let p = the total number of video game units sold by 
PlayStation. Since we are combining numbers, we will add.

576,565 + 152,049 + 54,677 = p
783,291 = p

	4.	 Check. 
We check our result by rereading the original problem and 
­seeing if 783,291 answers the question. Since we are looking for a total, 
we could repeat the addition calculation. We could also check whether 
the answer is reasonable. In this case, since the total is greater than 
any of the three separate sales numbers, the result seems reasonable. 
­Another way to check is to estimate the expected result and compare 
the estimate with the calculated result. If we round each PlayStation 
sales number to the nearest ten thousand and add, we have
580,000 + 150,000 + 50,000 = 780,000.
	 	 Since 780,000 ≈783,291, our result again seems reasonable.
	5.	 State.  The total number of the three PlayStation units sold worldwide 
as of December 8, 2012, is 783,291.

Multistep Problems
Sometimes we must use more than one operation to solve a problem, as in 
the following example.
example 7 
Weight Loss. 
To lose one pound, you must burn about 
3500 calories in excess of what you already burn doing your regular daily 
activities. The following chart shows how long a person must engage in 
several types of exercise in order to burn 100 calories. For how long would a 
person have to run at a brisk pace in order to lose one pound?
To burn 100 calories,
you must:
• Run for 8 minutes at a brisk pace, or
• Swim for 2 minutes at a brisk pace, or
• Bicycle for 15 minutes at 9 mph, or
• Do aerobic exercises for 15 minutes, or
• Golf, walking, for 20 minutes, or
• Play tennis, singles, for 11 minutes
	 1.	 Familiarize.  This is a multistep problem. We will first find how 
many hundreds are in 3500. This will tell us how many times a person 
must run for 8 min in order to lose one pound. Then we will find the 
total number of minutes required for the weight loss.
	
	   We let x = the number of hundreds in 3500 and t = the time it 
takes to lose one pound.
	 2.	 Translate.  We translate to two equations.

	 3.	 Solve.  We divide by 100 on both sides of the first equation to find x.
 100 # x = 3500

 x = 35

Then we use the fact that x = 35 to find t.
 x # 8 = t
 35 # 8 = t
 280 = t
  3 5
*   8
2 8 0
	 4.	 Check.  Suppose you run for 280 min. For every 8 min of running, 
you burn 100 calories. Since 280 , 8 = 35, there are 35 groups of 
8 min in 280 min, so you will burn 35 * 100 = 3500 calories.
	 5.	 State.  You must run for 280 min, or 4 hr 40 min, at a brisk pace in 
­order to lose one pound.
Do Exercise 9.
The key words, phrases, and concepts in the following table are useful 
when translating the problems to equations.

	 9.	 Weight Loss.  Use the 
information in Example 7  
to determine how long an 
individual must swim at a brisk 
pace in order to lose one pound.
	
1.	 Familiarize. Let x = the 
number of hundreds in 
3500. Let t = the time it 
takes to lose one pound.
	
2.	 Translate. 
    100 # x =

3.	 Solve.  From Example 7, 
we know that x =

 x # 2 = t
 # 2 = t
= t
	
4.	 Check.  Since 70 , 2 =  
35, there are 
 groups of 
2 min in 70 min. Thus, you 
will burn 35 * 100 =
 
calories.
	
5.	 State.  You must swim for 
 min, or 1 hr

in order to lose one pound.

Problem-Solving Tips
	 1.	 Look for patterns when solving problems.
	 2.	 When translating in mathematics, consider the dimensions of the 
variables and constants in the equation. The variables that rep-
resent length should all be in the same unit, those that represent 
money should all be in dollars or all in cents, and so on.
	 3.	 Make sure that units appear in the answer whenever appropriate 
and that you completely answer the original problem.

Writing Exponential Notation
Consider the product 3 # 3 # 3 # 3. Such products occur often enough that 
mathematicians have found it convenient to create a shorter notation, 
called exponential notation, for them. For example,
3 # 3 # 3 # 3 is shortened to 34.  
 exponent
	 4 factors	
base
We read exponential notation as follows.
a
(+1)1+* 
The wording “seven squared” for 72 is derived from the fact that a square 
with side s has area A given by A = s2.
s
s
A 5 s2
An expression like 3 # 52 is read “three times five squared,” or “three 
times the square of five.”

We evaluate exponential notation by rewriting it as a product and then 
computing the product.

 c 	 Simplifying Expressions
Suppose we have a calculation like the following:
3 + 4 # 8.
How do we find the answer? Do we add 3 to 4 and then multiply by 8, or do 
we multiply 4 by 8 and then add 3? In the first case, the answer is 56. In the 
second, the answer is 35. We agree to compute as in the second case:
3 + 4 # 8 = 3 + 32 = 35.
The following rules are an agreement regarding the order in which we 
perform operations. These are the rules that computers and most scientific 
calculators use to do computations.
Caution!
103 does not mean 10 # 3.

Averages
In order to find the average of a set of numbers, we use addition and then 
division. For example, the average of 2, 3, 6, and 9 is found as follows.
The number of addends is 4.
Average = 2 + 3 + 6 + 9
4
= 20
4 = 5
Divide by 4.
The fraction bar acts as a grouping symbol, so
2 + 3 + 6 + 9
4
   is equivalent to 12 + 3 + 6 + 92 , 4.
Thus we are using order of operations when we compute an average.
Average
The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers ­divided 
by the number of addends.

Order of Operations 
We can test whether a calculator 
is programmed to follow the rules 
for order of operations by entering 
a calculation such as 3 + 4 # 2. 
Using the rules for order of opera-
tions, the value of this expression is 
11. If a calculator returns the result 
14 instead of 11, that calculator 
performs operations as they are 
entered rather than following the 
rules for order of operations. When 
using such a calculator, we have to 
enter the operations in the order 
in which we want them performed.

 d 	 Removing Parentheses within Parentheses
When parentheses occur within parentheses, we can make them different 
shapes, such as 3 4 (called “brackets”) and 5 6 (called “braces”). All of these 
have the same meaning. When parentheses occur within parentheses, 
computations in the innermost ones are to be done first.
example 13  Simplify:  325 - 14 + 32 # 34 , 111 - 72.
325 - 14 + 32 # 34 , 111 - 72
= 325 - 7 # 34 , 111 - 72	
Doing the calculations in the  
innermost parentheses first
= 325 - 214 , 111 - 72	
Doing the multiplication in the 
brackets
= 4 , 4

= 16 , 2 + 540 - 313 - 646	
Doing the calculations in the  
innermost parentheses first
= 16 , 2 + 540 - 76

the innermost brackets

Example 
Round to the nearest thousand.
6 4 7 1
The digit 6 is in the thousands place. We consider 
the next digit to the right. Since the digit, 4, is 4 or 
lower, we round down, meaning that 6 thousands stays 
as 6 thousands. Change all digits to the right of the 
thousands digit to zeros. The answer is 6000.

In this chapter, we begin our work with fractions and fraction notation. 
Factoring is an important skill in working with fractions. For example, in 
order to simplify 12
32, it is important that we be able to factor 12 and 32, as 
follows:
12
32 = 4 # 3
4 # 8.
Then we “remove” a factor of 1:
4 # 3
4 # 8 = 4
4 # 3
8 = 1 # 3
8 = 3
8.
 a 	Factors and FactorizationS
Here we consider only the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on.
Let’s look at the product 3 # 4 = 12. We say that 3 and 4 are factors of 
12. When we divide 12 by 3, we get a remainder of 0. We say that the divisor 
3 is a factor of the dividend 12.

SECTION  2.1  Factorizations
Note that all of the factors 
of a natural number are less 
than or equal to the number.
Consider 12 = 3 # 4. We say that 3 # 4 is a factorization of 12. ­Similarly, 
6 # 2, 12 # 1, 2 # 2 # 3, and 1 # 3 # 4 are also factorizations of 12. Since 
a = a # 1, every number has a factorization, and every number has fac-
tors. For some numbers, the factors consist of only the number itself and 1. 
For example, the only factorization of 17 is 17 # 1, so the only factors of 17  
are 17 and 1.
example 2  List all the factors of 70.
We list as many “two-factor” factorizations as we can. We check sequen-
tially the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on, to see if we can form any factorizations:
70
1 # 70
2 # 35
5 # 14
7 # 10
The factors of 70 are 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, and 70.
Do Exercises 3–6.
 b 	Multiples and Divisibility
A multiple of a natural number is a product of that number and some natu-
ral number. For example, some multiples of 2 are
2 1because 2 = 1 # 22;
4 1because 4 = 2 # 22;
6 1because 6 = 3 # 22;
8 1because 8 = 4 # 22.
 
We find multiples of 2 by counting by twos: 2, 4, 6, 8, and so on. We can find 
multiples of 3 by counting by threes: 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on.
example 3  Show that each of the numbers 8, 12, 20, and 36 is a ­multiple 
of 4.
8 = 2 # 4  12 = 3 # 4  20 = 5 # 4  36 = 9 # 4
Do Exercises 7 and 8.
example 4  Multiply by 1, 2, 3, and so on, to find ten multiples of 7.
1 # 7 = 7  3 # 7 = 21  5 # 7 = 35  7 # 7 = 49  9 # 7 = 63

Prime and Composite Numbers
 • A natural number that has exactly two different factors, only itself 
and 1, is called a prime number.
 • The number 1 is not prime.
 • A natural number, other than 1, that is not prime is composite.
example 6  Determine whether the numbers 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 39, and 
59 are prime, composite, or neither.
The number 1 is not prime. It does not have two different factors.
The number 2 is prime. It has only the factors 2 and 1.
The numbers 7, 11, and 59 are prime. Each has only two factors, itself 
and 1.
The number 8 is not prime. It has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8 and is 
composite.
The numbers 9, 18, and 39 are composite. Each has more than two 
factors.
Thus we have
Prime:	
2, 7, 11, 59;
Composite:	
8, 9, 18, 39;
Neither:

SECTION  2.1  Factorizations
The number 2 is the only even prime number. It is also the smallest 
prime number. The number 0 is neither prime nor composite, but 0 is not a 
natural number and thus is not considered here. We are considering only 
natural numbers. The number 1 is the only natural number that is neither 
prime nor composite.
The table at right lists the prime numbers from 2 to 97. These prime 
numbers will be the most helpful to you in this text.
 d 	Prime Factorizations
When we factor a composite number into a product of primes, we find the 
prime factorization of the number. To do this, we consider the primes
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on,
and determine whether a given number is divisible by the primes.
example 7  Find the prime factorization of 39.
	a)	 We divide by the first prime, 2.
19
2)39
2
19
18
1
	 	 Because the remainder is not 0, 2 is not a factor of 39, and 39 is not 
­divisible by 2.
	b)	 We divide by the next prime, 3.
  13 R = 0
3)39
	 	 The remainder is 0, so we know that 39 = 3 # 13. Because 13 is a prime, 
we are finished. The prime factorization is
39 = 3 # 13.
example 8  Find the prime factorization of 220.
	a)	 We divide by the first prime, 2.
  110 R = 0
2)220
   
220 = 2 # 110
	b)	 Because 110 is composite, we continue to divide, starting with 2 again.
   55 R = 0
2)110
   
220 = 2 # 2 # 55
	c)	 Since 55 is composite and is not divisible by 2 or 3, we divide by the next 
prime, 5.
  11 R = 0
5)55
   
220 = 2 # 2 # 5 # 11
	 	 Because 11 is prime, we are finished. The prime factorization is
220 = 2 # 2 # 5 # 11.

Divisibility and ­Factors  We 
can use a calculator to determine 
whether one number is divisible by 
another number or whether one 
number is a factor of another 
number. For example, to deter-
mine whether 387 is divisible  
by 9, we press 3  8  7  ,  
9  =  . The display is 
43  . 
Since 43 is a natural number, we 
know that 387 is a multiple of 9; 
that is, 387 = 43 # 9. Thus, 387 is 
divisible by 9, and 9 is a factor of 387.

CHAPTER  2  Fraction Notation: Multiplication and Division
We abbreviate our procedure as follows.
11
5)55
2)110
2)220
220 = 2 # 2 # 5 # 11
Because multiplication is commutative, a factorization such as 
2 # 2 # 5 # 11 could also be expressed as 5 # 2 # 2 # 11 or 2 # 5 # 11 # 2 (or, in 
exponential notation, as 22 # 5 # 11 or 11 # 22 # 5), but the prime factors are 
the same in each case. For this reason, we agree that any of these is “the” 
prime factorization of 220.
Every number has just one (unique) prime factorization.
example 9  Find the prime factorization of 72.
We can do divisions “up” as follows:
   3
3) 9
2)18
2)36
2)72
72 = 2 # 2 # 2 # 3 # 3
Another way to find the prime factorization of 72 uses a factor tree as 
follows. Begin by determining any factorization you can, and then con-
tinue factoring. Any one of the following factor trees gives the prime fac-
torization of 72:

Caution!
Keep in mind the difference 
between finding all the factors 
of a number and finding the 
prime factorization. In Exam-
ple 9, the prime factorization 
of 72 is 2 # 2 # 2 # 3 # 3. The 
factors of 72 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 
12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.

SECTION  2.2  Divisibility
Suppose you are asked to find the simplest fraction notation for
117
225.
Since the numbers are quite large, you might feel that the task is difficult. 
However, both the numerator and the denominator are divisible by 9. 
If ­you knew this, you could factor and simplify as follows:
117
225 = 9 # 13
9 # 25 = 9
9 # 13
25 = 1 # 13
25 = 13
25.
How did we know that both numbers have 9 as a factor? There is a simple 
test for determining this.
In this section, you learn quick ways to determine whether a number is 
divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10. This will make simplifying fraction nota-
tion much easier.

A number is divisible by 2 (is even) if it has a ones digit of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 
8 (that is, it has an even ones digit).
Let’s see why this test works. Consider 354, which is
3 hundreds + 5 tens + 4.
Hundreds and tens are both multiples of 2. If the last digit is a multiple of 2, 
then the entire number is a multiple of 2.

Divisibility by 3
By 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
Let’s illustrate why the test for divisibility by 3 works. Consider 852; 
since 852 = 3 # 284, 852 is divisible by 3.
 852 = 8 # 100 + 5 # 10 + 2 # 1
 = 8199 + 12 + 519 + 12 + 2112
 = 8 # 99 + 8 # 1 + 5 # 9 + 5 # 1 + 2 # 1    Using the distributive law: 
a1b + c2 = a # b + a # c
Since 99 and 9 are each a multiple of 3, we see that 8 # 99 and 5 # 9 are mul-
tiples of 3. This leaves 8 # 1 + 5 # 1 + 2 # 1, or 8 + 5 + 2. If 8 + 5 + 2, the 
sum of the digits, is divisible by 3, then 852 is divisible by 3.
examples  Determine whether each number is divisible by 3.
	 5.	 18 1 + 8 = 9
	 6.	 93 9 + 3 = 12
	 7.	 201 2 + 0 + 1 = 3
	 8.	 256 2 + 5 + 6 = 13
Do Exercises 5–8.
Divisibility by 6
A number divisible by 6 is a multiple of 6. But 6 = 2 # 3, so the number is 
also a multiple of 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 have no factors in common, we have 
the following.
Each is divisible by 3 because the 
sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
The sum of the digits, 13, is not divisible 
by 3, so 256 is not divisible by 3.

 a 	 Multiplication Using Fraction Notation
Let’s visualize the product of two fractions. We consider the multiplication
3
5 # 3
4.
This is equivalent to finding 3
5 of 3
4. We first consider an object and take 3
4 of 
it. We divide the object into 4 equal parts using vertical lines and take 3 of 
them. That is shown by the shading below.
3
4
3

Next, we take 3
5 of the shaded area. We divide it into 5 equal parts using 
horizontal lines and take 3 of them. That is shown by the darker shading 
below.
?
3
5
3
5
3
4
The entire object has now been divided into 20 parts, and we have shaded 9 
of them twice. Thus we see that 3
5 of 3
4 is 9
20, or
3
5 # 3
4 = 9
20.
The figure above shows a rectangular array inside a rectangular array. The 
number of pieces in the entire array is 5 # 4 (the product of the denomina-
tors). The number of pieces shaded a second time is 3 # 3 (the product of 
the numerators). The product is represented by 9 pieces out of a set of 20, 
or 9
20, which is the product of the numerators over the product of the de-
nominators. This leads us to a statement of the procedure for multiplying a 
fraction by a fraction.

SECTION  2.4  Multiplication and Applications
 b 	 Applications and Problem Solving
Many problems that can be solved by multiplying fractions can be thought 
of in terms of rectangular arrays.
example 7  A real estate developer owns a plot of land and plans to use 
4
5 of the plot for a small strip mall and parking lot. Of this, 2
3 will be needed 
for the parking lot. What part of the plot will be used for parking?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We first make a drawing to help familiarize ourselves 
with the problem. The land may not be rectangular, but we can think 
of it as a rectangle. The strip mall, including the parking lot, uses 4
5 of 
the plot. We shade 4
5 as shown on the left below. The parking lot alone 
uses 2
3 of the part we just shaded. We shade that as shown on the right 
below.
4
5
. 4
5
2
3
	 2.	 Translate.  We let n = the part of the plot that is used for ­parking. 
We are taking “two-thirds of four-fifths.” The word “of” corresponds 
to multiplication. Thus the following multiplication sentence 
­corresponds to the situation:
2
3 # 4
5 = n.
	 3.	 Solve.  The number sentence tells us what to do. We multiply:
2
3 # 4
5 = 2 # 4
3 # 5 = 8
15.
	
	 Thus, 8
15 = n.
	 4.	 Check.  We can do a partial check by noting that the answer is a frac-
tion less than 1, which we expect since the developer is using only 
part of the original plot of land. Thus, 8
15 is a reasonable answer. We 
can also check this in the figure above, where we see that 8 of 15 parts 
­represent the parking lot.
	 5.	 State.  The parking lot takes up 8
15 of the plot of land.
Do Exercise 8.
	 8.	 A developer plans to set aside 
3

The tests for divisibility are very helpful in simplifying fraction nota-
tion. We could have shortened the preceding example had we noted that 6 
is a factor of both the numerator and the denominator. Then we would have
90
84 = 6 # 15
6 # 14 = 6
6 # 15
14 = 15
14.
example 6  Simplify:  603
207.
At first glance this looks difficult. But, using the test for divisibility by 9 
(sum of digits is divisible by 9), we find that both the numerator and the 
­denominator are divisible by 9. Thus we write both numbers with a factor of 9:
603
207 = 9 # 67
9 # 23 = 9
9 # 67
23 = 67
23.
example 7  Simplify:  660
1140
 .
Using the tests for divisibility, we have
660
1140 = 10 # 66
10 # 114 = 10
10 # 66
114 = 66
114	
Both 660 and 1140
are divisible by 10.

CHAPTER  2  Fraction Notation: Multiplication and Division
Canceling
Canceling is a shortcut that you may have used for removing a factor of 1 
when working with fraction notation. With great concern, we mention it as 
a possibility for speeding up your work. Canceling may be done only when 
removing common factors in numerators and denominators. Each such 
pair allows us to remove a factor of 1 in a fraction.
Our concern is that canceling be done with care and understanding. In 
effect, slashes are used to indicate factors of 1 that have been removed. For 
instance, Example 5 might have been done faster as follows:
90
84 = 2 # 3 # 3 # 5
2 # 2 # 3 # 7    Factoring the numerator and the denominator
	
= 2 # 3 # 3 # 5
2 # 2 # 3 # 7
	
= 3 # 5
2 # 7 = 15
14.
Caution!
The difficulty with canceling is that it is often applied incorrectly in situations 
like the following:
2 + 3
2
= 3;  4 + 1
4 + 2 = 1
2;  15
54 = 1
4.
	
Wrong!	
Wrong!	
Wrong!
The correct answers are
2 + 3
2
= 5
2
 ;  4 + 1
4 + 2 = 5
6
 ;  15
54 = 3 # 5
3 # 18 = 3
3 # 5
18 = 5
18.
In each situation, the number canceled was not a factor of 1. Factors are parts of 
products. For example, in 2 # 3, 2 and 3 are factors, but in 2 + 3, 2 and 3 are not 
factors. Canceling may not be done when sums or differences are in numerators 
or denominators, as shown here. If you cannot factor, you cannot cancel! If in 
doubt, do not cancel!
 c 	 A Test for Equality
When denominators are the same, we say that fractions have a common 
denominator. When fractions have a common denominator, we can 
­compare them by comparing numerators. Suppose we want to compare 
3
6 and 2
4. First, we find a common denominator. To do this, we multiply 
each fraction by 1, using the denominator of the other fraction to form the 
­symbol for 1. We multiply 3
6 by 4
4 and 2
4 by 6
6:
3
6 = 3
6 # 4
4 = 3 # 4
6 # 4 = 12
24 ;    Multiplying by 4
4
2
4 = 2
4 # 6
6 = 2 # 6
4 # 6 = 12
24.     Multiplying by 6
6
Once we have a common denominator, 24, we compare the numerators. And 
since these numerators are both 12, the fractions are equal:
3
6 = 2
4.

Note in the preceding that if

This tells us that we need to check only the products 3 # 4 and 6 # 2 to compare

Two fractions are equal if their cross products are equal.
We multiply these two 
numbers: 3 # 4.
We multiply these two 
numbers: 6 # 2.
3
6  
  2

We call 3 # 4 and 6 # 2 cross products. Since the cross products are 
the same—that is, 3 # 4 = 6 # 2—we know that
3
6 = 2
4.
If a sentence a = b is true, it means that a and b name the same num-
ber. If a sentence a ≠b (read “a is not equal to b”) is true, it means that a 
and b do not name the same number.

CHAPTER  2  Fraction Notation: Multiplication and Division
 a 	 Multiplying and Simplifying  
Using Fraction Notation
It is often possible to simplify after we multiply. To make such simplifying 
easier, it is usually best not to carry out the products in the numerator and 
the denominator immediately, but to factor and simplify first. Consider the 
product
3
8 # 4
9.
We proceed as follows:
 3
8 # 4
9 = 3 # 4
8 # 9
 =
3 # 2 # 2
2 # 2 # 2 # 3 # 3    Factoring the numerator and the 
denominator
 =
3 # 2 # 2 # 1
2 # 2 # 2 # 3 # 3    Using the identity property of 1 to insert 
the number 1 as a factor
 = 3 # 2 # 2
3 # 2 # 2 #

2 # 3    Factoring the fraction
 = 1 #
1
2 # 3
 =
1
2 # 3               Removing a factor of 1
 = 1
6.
The procedure could have been shortened had we noticed that 4 is a factor 
of the 8 in the denominator:
3
8 # 4
9 = 3 # 4
8 # 9 =
3 # 4
4 # 2 # 3 # 3 = 3 # 4

example 4 
Landscaping. 
Celina’s Landscaping uses 2
3 lb of peat 
moss when planting a rosebush. How much will be needed to plant 21 
rosebushes?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We let n = the number of pounds of peat moss needed. 
Each rosebush requires 2
3 lb of peat moss, so repeated addition, or mul-
tiplication, applies.
	 2.	 Translate.  The problem translates to the following equation:
n = 21 # 2
3.
	 3.	 Solve.  To solve the equation, we carry out the multiplication:
 n = 21 # 2
3 = 21
1 # 2
3 = 21 # 2
1 # 3
    Multiplying
 = 3 # 7 # 2
1 # 3
= 3
3 # 7 # 2
1
= 14.
	 4.	 Check.  We check by repeating the calculation. (This is left to the stu-
dent.) We can also ask if the answer seems reasonable. We are putting 
less than a pound of peat moss on each bush, so the answer should be 
less than 21. Since 14 is less than 21, we have a partial check. The num-
ber 14 checks.
	 5.	 State.  Celina’s Landscaping will need 14 lb of peat moss to plant 21 
rosebushes.

CHAPTER  3  Fraction Notation and Mixed Numerals
When we want to add or subtract fractions, the fractions must share a 
­common denominator. If necessary, we find equivalent fractions using the 
least common denominator (LCD), or least common multiple (LCM) of 
the denominators.

Least Common Multiple, LCM
The least common multiple, or LCM, of two natural numbers is the 
smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.
example 1  Find the LCM of 20 and 30.
First, we list some multiples of 20 by multiplying 20 by 1, 2, 3, and so on:
20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, c.
Then we list some multiples of 30 by multiplying 30 by 1, 2, 3, and so on:
30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, c.
Now we determine the smallest number common to both lists. The LCM of 
20 and 30 is 60.
Do Margin Exercise 1.
Next, we develop three more efficient methods for finding LCMs. You 
may choose to learn only one method. (Consult with your instructor.) If you 
are going to study algebra, you should definitely learn method 2.
Method 1: Finding LCMs Using One List of Multiples
The first method for finding LCMs works especially well when the ­numbers 
are relatively small.
	 1.	 Find the LCM of 9 and 15 by 
examining lists of multiples.

Margin Exercise:
1.  45
Method 1. To find the LCM of a set of numbers using a list of multiples:
	a)	 Determine whether the largest number is a multiple of the others. 
If it is, it is the LCM. That is, if the largest number has the others as 
­factors, the LCM is that number.
	b)	 If not, check multiples of the largest number until you get one that 
is a multiple of each of the others.

169
SECTION  3.1  Least Common Multiples
example 2 
Find the LCM of 12 and 15.
a)	 15 is the larger number, but it is not a multiple of 12.
b)	 Check multiples of 15:
2 # 15 = 30,    Not a multiple of 12
3 # 15 = 45,    Not a multiple of 12
4 # 15 = 60.    A multiple of 12:  5 # 12 = 60
The LCM = 60.
example 3  Find the LCM of 8 and 32.
a)	 32 is a multiple of 8 14 # 8 = 322, so the LCM = 32.
example 4  Find the LCM of 10, 20, and 50.
a)	 50 is a multiple of 10 but not a multiple of 20.
b)	 Check multiples of 50:
2 # 50 = 100.    A multiple of 10 and of 20:  
10 # 10 = 100 and 5 # 20 = 100
The LCM = 100.
Do Exercises 2–5.
Method 2: Finding LCMs Using Prime Factorizations
A second method for finding LCMs uses prime factorizations. Con-
sider again 20 and 30. Their prime factorizations are 20 = 2 # 2 # 5 and 
30 = 2 # 3 # 5. Any multiple of 20 will have to have two 2’s as factors and 
one 5 as a factor. Any multiple of 30 will need to have one 2, one 3, and one 5 
as factors. The smallest number satisfying these conditions is
2 # 2 # 3 # 5.
Thus the LCM of 20 and 30 is 2 # 2 # 3 # 5, or 60. It has all the factors of 20 
and all the factors of 30, but the factors are not repeated when they are 
common to both numbers.
Note that each prime factor is used the greatest number of times that it 
occurs in either of the individual factorizations.
Find the LCM.

SECTION  3.1  Least Common Multiples
Consider the factor 5. The greatest number of times that 5 occurs in any 
one factorization is one time. We write 5 as a factor one time.
2 # 2 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 5 # ?
Consider the factor 7. The greatest number of times that 7 occurs in any 
one factorization is one time. We write 7 as a factor one time.
2 # 2 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 # 5 # 7
Since there are no other prime factors in any of the factorizations, the
LCM is  2 #  2 #  3 #  3 #  3 #  3 #  5 #  7, or 11,340.
Do Exercise 9.
example 8  Find the LCM of 8 and 9.
We write the prime factorization of each number.
8 = 2 # 2 # 2,  9 = 3 # 3
Note that the two numbers, 8 and 9, have no common prime factor. When 
this is the case, the LCM is just the product of the two numbers. Thus the 
LCM is 2 # 2 # 2 # 3 # 3, or 8 # 9, or 72.
Do Exercises 10 and 11.
example 9  Find the LCM of 7 and 21.
We write the prime factorization of each number. Because 7 is prime, it 
has no prime factorization.
7 = 7,  21 = 3 # 7
Note that 7 is a factor of 21. We stated earlier that if one number is a factor of 
another, the LCM is the larger of the numbers. Thus the LCM is 7 # 3, or 21.
Do Exercises 12 and 13.
Let’s reconsider Example 7 using exponents. We write the prime factor-
izations of 81, 90, and 84 using exponential notation. The largest exponents 
indicate the greatest number of times that 2, 3, 5, and 7 occur as factors.
81 = 3 # 3 # 3 # 3 = 34;	
4 is the largest exponent of 3 in 
any of the factorizations.
90 = 2 # 3 # 3 # 5 = 21 # 32 # 51;	
1 is the largest exponent of 5 in 
any of the factorizations.
84 = 2 # 2 # 3 # 7 = 22 # 31 # 71.    2 is the largest exponent of 2 
and 1 is the largest exponent of 
7 in any of the factorizations.
Thus the LCM is 22 # 34 # 51 # 71, or 11,340.

	b)	 Create a product with the prime factors 2, 3, and 5. Lining up all the

Method 3: Finding LCMs Using Division by Primes

numbers.

of 24, 35, and 45.
	15.	 Redo Margin Exercises 6–8 
using exponents.
Method 3. To find the LCM using division by primes:
	a)	 First look for any prime that divides at least two of the numbers  
with no remainder. Then divide, bringing down any numbers not  
divisible by the prime. If you cannot find a prime that divides at  
least two of the numbers, then the LCM is the product of the  
numbers.
	b)	 Repeat the process until you can divide no more—that is, until  
there are no two numbers divisible by the same prime.
example 11  Find the LCM of 48, 72, and 80.
We first look for any prime that divides any two of the numbers with 
no remainder. Then we divide. We repeat the process, bringing down any 
numbers not divisible by the prime, until we can divide no more—that is, 
until there are no two numbers divisible by the same prime:
2 ƒ 48 72 80
3 ƒ 24 36 40
2 ƒ 8 12 40
2 ƒ 4 6 20
2 ƒ 2 3 10
1 3 5
No two of 1, 3, and 5 are divisible by the same prime. We stop here. The 
LCM is
2 # 3 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 1 # 3 # 5, or 720.
example 12  Find the LCM of 12, 18, 21, and 40.
3 ƒ 12 18 21 40
2 ƒ 4 6 7 40
2 ƒ 2 3 7 20
  1 3 7 10
No two of 1, 3, 7, and 10 are divisible by the same prime. We stop here.
The LCM is 3 # 2 # 2 # 1 # 3 # 7 # 10, or 2520.

We had to simplify at the end in (A) but not in (B). In (B), we used the 
least common multiple of the denominators, 12, as the common denomi-
nator. That number is called the least common denominator, or LCD. We 
may still need to simplify when using the LCD, but it is usually easier than 
when we use a larger common denominator.
To add when denominators are different:
	a)	 Find the least common multiple of the denominators. That number 
is the least common denominator, LCD.
	b)	 Multiply by 1, using an appropriate notation, n>n, to express each 
number in terms of the LCD.
	c)	 Add the numerators, keeping the same denominator.
	d)	 Simplify, if possible.

example 10 
Phases of the Moon. 
The moon rotates in such a way 
that the same side always faces the earth. Throughout a lunar cycle, the 
portion of the moon that appears illuminated increases from nearly none 
(new moon) to nearly all (full moon), then decreases back to nearly none. 
These phases of the moon can be described by fractions between 0 and 1, 
indicating the portion of the moon illuminated. The partial calendar from 
August 2013 shows the fraction of the moon illuminated at midnight, 
­Eastern Standard Time, for each day.
How much more of the moon appeared illuminated on August 18, 2013, 
than on August 15, 2013?
	 1.	 Familiarize. 
From the calendar, we see that 3
5 of the moon was 
­illuminated on August 15 and that 17
20 of the moon was illuminated on 
August 18. We let m = the additional part of the moon that appeared 
illuminated on August 18.

Men’s Long-Jump World Records. 
On October 18, 1968, 
Bob Beamon set a world record of 29 3
16 ft for the long jump, a record that was 
not broken for nearly 23 years. This record-setting jump was significantly 
longer than the previous one of 27 19
48 ft, accomplished on May 29, 1965, by 
Ralph Boston. How much longer was Beamon’s jump than Boston’s?
Source: “Long jump world record progression,” en.wikipedia.org
	 1.	 Familiarize.  The phrase “how much longer” indicates subtraction. 
We let w = the difference in the world records.
	 2.	 Translate.  We translate as follows:

“d” stands for “penny,” which 
was used years ago in England 
to specify the number of pennies 
needed to buy 100 nails. Today, 
“penny” is used only to indicate 
the length of the nail.)

CHAPTER  3  Fraction Notation and Mixed Numerals
example 10 
Locks of Love.  Locks of Love, Inc., is a non-profit orga-
nization that provides hairpieces for children who have lost their hair as a 
result of medical conditions. The minimum length for hair that is donated 
is 10 in. Karissa and Cayla allowed their hair to grow in order to donate 
it. The length cut from Karissa’s hair was 15 1
4 in., and the length cut from 
­Cayla’s hair was 14 1
2 in. After the hair was cut, it was discovered that the 
ends of each lock had highlighting that needed to be trimmed. Because of 
the highlighting, 1 1
2 in. was cut from Karissa’s lock of hair and 2 3
4 in. was 
cut from Cayla’s. In all, what was the total usable length of hair that Karissa 
and Cayla donated?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We let l = the total usable length of hair that Karissa 
and Cayla donated.
	 2.	 Translate.  The length l is the sum of the lengths that were cut, minus 
the sum of the lengths that were trimmed from the locks. Thus we have
l = 115 1
4 + 14 1
22 - 11 1
2 + 2 3
42.
	 3.	 Solve.  This is a three-step problem.
a)	 We first add the two lengths 15 1
4 and 14 1
2.
15 1
4 =

Thus, l = 25 1

	 4.	 Check.  We can check by doing the problem a different way. We can 
subtract the trimmed length from each lock, then add the adjusted 
lengths together.

Training Regimens. 
Fitness trainers suggest training 
regimens for athletes who are preparing to run marathons and mini-­
marathons. One suggested twelve-week regimen combines days of short, 
easy running with other days of cross-training, rest, and long-distance 
running. During week nine, this regimen calls for a long-distance run of  
10 mi, which is 2 1
2 times the length of the long-distance run recommended 
for week one. What is the length of the long-distance run recommended for 
week one?
Source: shape.com
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We ask the question “10 is 2 1
2 times what number?” We 
let r =  the length of the long-distance run recommended for week one.
	 2.	 Translate.  The problem can be translated to an equation.

	 2.	 Translate.  This is a multistep problem. We first find 
the area of the room, B, and the area of the rug, R. Then 
H = B - R. We find each area using the formula for the area 
of a rectangle:  A = l * w.

28 hr per week for six weeks watching for the perfect 
opportunity to photograph this family of six. At the 
time of this photo, an observer estimated that the 
cubs weighed 7 1
2 lb, 8 lb, 9 1
2 lb, 10 5
8 lb, and 11 3
4 lb. What 
was the average weight of the cubs?

CHAPTER  4  Decimal Notation
The set of arithmetic numbers, or nonnegative rational numbers, con-
sists of the whole numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and so on, and frac-
tions like 1
2, 2
3, 7
8, 17
10, and so on. Note that we can write the whole numbers 
using fraction notation. For example, 3 can be written as 3
1. We studied the 
use of fraction notation for arithmetic numbers in Chapters 2 and 3.
In this chapter, we will study the use of decimal notation. The word dec-
imal comes from the Latin word decima, meaning a tenth part. Although 
we are using different notation, we are still considering the nonnegative 
rational numbers. Using decimal notation, we can write 0.875 for 7
8, for ex-
ample, or 48.97 for 48 97
100.
 a 	 Decimal Notation and Word Names
One model of the Magellan GPS navigation system sells for $249.98. The 
dot in $249.98 is called a decimal point. Since $0.98, or 98¢, is 98
100 of a dol-
lar, it follows that
$249.98 = $249 + $0.98.
Also, since $0.98, or 98¢, has the same value as 9 dimes + 8 cents and 
1 dime is 1
10 of a dollar and 1 cent is 1
100 of a dollar, we can write
249.98 = 2 # 100 + 4 # 10 + 9 # 1 + 9 # 1
10 + 8 #
1
100.
This is an extension of the expanded notation for whole numbers that we 
used in Chapter 1. The place values are 100, 10, 1, 1
10, 1
100, and so on. We can 
see this on a place-value chart. The value of each place is 1
10 as large as that 
of the one to its left.
Let’s consider decimal notation using a place-value chart to represent 
2.0677 min, the women’s 200-meter backstroke world record held by Missy 
Franklin from the United States.

If fraction notation has a denominator that is a power of ten, such as 10, 
100, 1000, and so on, we convert to decimal notation by reversing the pro-
cedure that we used before.
To convert from decimal to fraction notation,
	a)	 count the number of decimal places,

If a mixed numeral has a fraction part with a denominator that is a 
power of ten, such as 10, 100, or 1000, and so on, we first write the mixed 
numeral as a sum of a whole number and a fraction. Then we convert to 
decimal notation.

SECTION  4.1  Decimal Notation, Order, and Rounding
 c 	 Order
To understand how to compare numbers in decimal notation, consider 
0.85 and 0.9. First note that 0.9 = 0.90 because 9
10 =
90
100. Then 0.85 =
85
100 
and 0.90 =
90
100. Since 85
100 6
90
100, it follows that 0.85 6 0.90. This leads us to a 
quick way to compare two numbers in decimal notation.
Comparing Numbers in Decimal Notation
To compare two numbers in decimal notation, start at the left and 
compare corresponding digits moving from left to right. If two digits 
differ, the number with the larger digit is the larger of the two num-
bers. To ease the comparison, extra zeros can be written to the right 
of the last decimal place.
example 14  Which of 2.109 and 2.1 is larger? 
	
Think.
2.109	
2.109
	
 
 
2.1	
2.100
	
Same	
Different; 9 7 0
Thus, 2.109 is larger than 2.1. That is, 2.109 7 2.1.
example 15  Which of 0.09 and 0.108 is larger? 
	
Think.
0.09	
0.090
	
 
 
0.108	
0.108
	
Same	
Different; 1 7 0
Thus, 0.108 is larger than 0.09. That is, 0.108 7 0.09.
Do Exercises 17–22.
 d 	 Rounding
Rounding of numbers in decimal notation is done as for whole numbers. To 
understand, we first consider an example using the number line. It might 
help to review Section 1.6.
example 16  Round 0.37 to the nearest tenth.
Here is part of a number line.
0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6
0
0.7 0.8 0.9
1
0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35 0.36
0.30
0.37 0.38 0.39 0.40
We see that 0.37 is closer to 0.40 than to 0.30. Thus, 0.37 rounded to the 
nearest tenth is 0.4.

mal places past the rounding place, which is the same as changing all digits to the right to zeros. For example, rounding 
6.78093456285102 to the ninth decimal place, using truncating, gives us 6.780934562. Use truncating to round each of the

Adding with decimal notation is similar to adding whole numbers. First, 
we line up the decimal points so that we can add corresponding place-
value digits. Then we add digits from the right. For example, we add the 
thousandths, then the hundredths, and so on, carrying if necessary. If

Now we consider the addition 3456 + 19.347. Keep in mind that any 
whole number has an “unwritten” decimal point at the right that can be 
followed by zeros. For example, 3456 can also be written 3456.000. When 
adding, we can always write in the decimal point and extra zeros if desired.

Let’s find the product
2.3 * 1.12.

Converting from cents to dollars is like multiplying by 0.01. To see why, 
consider 65¢.
65¢ = 65 * 1¢	
We think of 65¢ as 65 * 1 cent, or 65 * 1¢.
	
= 65 * $0.01    Substituting $0.01 for 1¢: 1¢ = $0.01

the end with as many zeros as we wish after the decimal point. For example,  
12 = 12. = 12.0 = 12.00 = 12.000, and so on. We can also add zeros after the 
last digit in the decimal portion of a number:  3.6 = 3.60 = 3.600, and so on.

CHAPTER  4  Decimal Notation
Divisors That Are Not Whole Numbers
Consider the division
0 . 2 4 ) 8 . 2 0 8
We write the division as 8.208
0.24 . Then we multiply by 1 to change to a whole-
number divisor:
8.208
0.24 = 8.208
0.24 * 100
100 = 820.8
24 .
The divisor is now a whole number.
    The division 0.24)8.208 is the 
same as 24)820.8.
(The new decimal  
point in the dividend  
is indicated by a caret.)
To divide when the divisor is not a whole number,
	a)	 move the decimal point 
­(multiply by 10, 100, and so 
on) to make the divisor a 
whole number;
0 . 2 4 ) 8 . 2 0 8
Move 2 places to the right.
	b)	 move the decimal point in 
the dividend the same num-
ber of places (multiply the 
same way); and
0 . 2 4 ) 8 . 2 0 8
Move 2 places to the right.
	c)	 place the decimal point 
­directly above the new 
­decimal point in the 
­dividend and divide as

Dividing by 10, 100, 1000, and So On
It is often helpful to be able to divide quickly by a ten, hundred, or thou-
sand, or by a tenth, hundredth, or thousandth. Each procedure we use is 
based on multiplying by 1. Consider the following example:
23.789
1000
= 23.789
1000  #  1000
1000 =
23,789
1,000,000 = 0.023789.
We are dividing by a number greater than 1:  The result is smaller than 23.789.
    Place a decimal point at the end of the  
whole number.
    Multiply the divisor by 100. (Move the  
decimal point 2 places.) Multiply the same  
way in the dividend. (Move 2 places after  
adding extra zeros.)
    Place a decimal point above the new decimal  
point and then divide.

The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 
the number of addends. We find the sum of the population densities per 
square mile and divide it by the number of addends, 6:
43.1 + 147 + 67.9 + 839.4 + 1018.1 + 738.1
6
= 2853.6
6
= 475.6.
Thus the average number of residents per square mile for these six states is 
475.6.

 a 	 Fraction Notation to Decimal Notation
When a denominator has no prime factors other than 2’s and 5’s, we can 
find decimal notation by multiplying by 1. We multiply to get a denomina-
tor that is a power of ten, like 10, 100, or 1000.
example 1  Find decimal notation for 3
5.
3
5 = 3
5 # 2
2 = 6
10 = 0.6    5 # 2 = 10, so we use 2
2 for 1  
to get a denominator of 10.

25.
87
25 = 87
25 # 4
4 = 348
100 = 3.48    25 # 4 = 100, so we use 4
4 for 1 to  
get a denominator of 100.
example 3  Find decimal notation for 9
40.
9
40 = 9
40 # 25
25 = 225
1000 = 0.225    40 # 25 = 1000, so we use 25

CHAPTER  4  Decimal Notation
Do Exercises 4 and 5.
In Examples 4 and 5, the division terminated, meaning that eventually 
we got a remainder of 0. A terminating decimal occurs when the denomi-
nator of a fraction has only 2’s or 5’s, or both, as factors, as in 17
25, 5
8, or 83
100. 
This assumes that the fraction notation has been simplified.
Consider a different situation: 5
6, or 5>12 # 32. Since 6 has a 3 as a fac-
tor, the division will not terminate. Although we can still use division to get 
decimal notation, the answer will be a repeating decimal, as follows.

Since 2 keeps reappearing as a remainder, the digits repeat and will con-
tinue to do so; therefore,
5
6 = 0.83333c.
The red dots indicate an endless sequence of digits in the quotient. When 
there is a repeating pattern, the dots are often replaced by a bar to indicate 
the repeating part—in this case, only the 3:
5
6 = 0.83.

answers. To round a repeating decimal, we can extend the decimal nota-

SECTION  4.5  Converting from Fraction Notation to Decimal Notation 
c 	 Calculations with Fraction Notation 
and Decimal Notation Together
In certain kinds of calculations, fraction notation and decimal notation 
­occur together. In such cases, there are at least three ways in which we 
might proceed.
example 15  Calculate:  3
5 * 0.56.
Method 1:  One way to do this calculation is to convert the fraction nota-
tion to decimal notation so that both numbers are in decimal notation.
3
5 * 0.56 = 0.6 * 0.56 = 0.336
Method 2:  A second way to do this calculation is to convert the decimal 
notation to fraction notation so that both numbers are in fraction notation. 
The answer can be left in fraction notation and simplified, or we can con-
vert to decimal notation and round, if appropriate.
 3
5 * 0.56 = 3
5 # 56
100 = 3 # 2 # 2 # 2 # 7
5 # 2 # 2 # 5 # 5
 = 2 # 2
2 # 2 # 3 # 2 # 7
5 # 5 # 5 = 1 # 3 # 2 # 7
5 # 5 # 5
 = 3 # 2 # 7
5 # 5 # 5 = 42
125, or 0.336
Method 3:  A third way to do this calculation is to treat 0.56 as 0.56
1 . Then 
we multiply 0.56 by 3 and divide the result by 5.
3
5 * 0.56 = 3
5 * 0.56
1
= 3 * 0.56
5
= 1.68
5
= 0.336
Do Exercise 17.
example 16  Calculate:  2
3 * 0.576 + 3.287 , 4
5.
We use the rules for order of operations, doing first the multiplication 
and then the division. Then we add. Since 2
3 would convert to a repeating 
decimal that would need to be rounded, method 1 would give an approxi-
mation. Here we use method 3.
 2
3 * 0.576 + 3.287 , 4
5 = 2
3 * 0.576
1
+ 3.287
1
* 5
4
 = 2 * 0.576
3
+ 3.287 * 5
4
 = 0.384 + 4.10875
 = 4.49275

4 * 0.62.
Method 1:
 3
4 * 0.62 = 0.   5 * 0.62

Method 2:
 3
4 * 0.62 = 3

 a 	 Estimating Sums, Differences, 
­Products, and Quotients
Estimating has many uses. It can be done before we even attempt a prob-
lem in order to get an idea of the answer. It can be done afterward as a 
check, even when we are using a calculator. In many situations, an esti-
mate is all we need. We usually estimate by rounding the numbers so that 
there are one or two nonzero digits, depending on how accurate we want 
our estimate to be. Consider the following prices for Examples 1–3.
example 1 
Estimate by rounding to the nearest ten the total cost of 
one grill and one TV.
We are estimating the sum
$289.95 + $449.99 = total cost.
The estimate found by rounding the addends to the nearest ten is
$290 + $450 = $740.    (Estimated total cost)
Do Margin Exercise 1.
example 2  About how much more does the TV cost than the camera? 
Estimate by rounding to the nearest ten.
We are estimating the difference
$449.99 - $139.97 = price difference.
The estimate, found by rounding the minuend and the subtrahend to the 
nearest ten, is
$450 - $140 = $310.    (Estimated price difference)

SECTION  4.6  Estimating
example 3   Estimate the total cost of four cameras.
We are estimating the product
4 * $139.97 = total cost.
The estimate is found by rounding 139.97 to the nearest ten:
4 * $140 = $560.
Do Exercise 3.
example 4 
A student government group is planning an event for in-
coming freshmen. Since the local weather is often rainy, the group decides 
to purchase umbrellas bearing the university logo for door prizes. About 
how many umbrellas that cost $39.99 each can be purchased for $356?
We are estimating the quotient
$356 , $39.99.
Since we want a whole-number estimate, we need to round appropriately. 
Rounding $39.99 to the nearest one, we get $40. Since $356 is close to $360, 
which is a multiple of $40, we estimate
$360 , $40 = 9.
The answer is about 9 umbrellas.
Do Exercise 4.
example 5  Estimate:  4.8 * 52. Do not find the actual product. Which 
of the following is an appropriate estimate?
	a)	 25
	b)	 250
	c)	 2500
	d)	 360
We round 4.8 to the nearest one and 52 to the nearest ten:
5 * 50 = 250.    (Estimated product)
Thus an approximate estimate is (b).
Other estimates that we might have used in Example 5 are
5 * 52 = 260,  or  4.8 * 50 = 240.
The estimate used in Example 5, 5 * 50 = 250, is the easiest to do ­because 
the factors have the fewest nonzero digits.

	a)	 0.3

	d)	 3
We estimate 3 for a quotient. We check by multiplying.
0.23 * 3 = 0.69
We make the estimate smaller. We estimate 0.3 and check by multiplying.
0.23 * 0.3 = 0.069
We make the estimate smaller. We estimate 0.03 and check by multiplying.
0.23 * 0.03 = 0.0069
This is about 0.0074, so the quotient is about 0.03. Thus an appropriate es-

SECTION  4.7  Applications and Problem Solving
 a 	 Solving Applied Problems
Solving applied problems with decimals is like solving applied problems 
with whole numbers. We translate first to an equation that corresponds to 
the situation. Then we solve the equation.
example 1 
Window Code. 
To meet building codes, the area of the 
opening when the lower part of a double-sash window is raised must be 
5 ft2 1720 in22 for first-floor windows and 5.7 ft2 1820.8 in22 for second-floor 
windows. A contractor orders windows that have an opening measuring 
27.063 in. * 28.563 in. Find the area of the opening and determine if the 
windows meet the first-floor code.
Sources: Matt Beecher Builders; Paul’s Glass
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We first make a drawing.
27.063 in.
28.563 in.
	 2.	 Translate.  We use the formula A = l # w and substitute.
A = l # w = 27.063 * 28.563
	 3.	 Solve.  We solve by carrying out the multiplication.
2 8 . 5 6 3
*  2 7 . 0 6 3
8 5 6 8 9
1 7 1 3 7 8 0
1 9 9 9 4 1 0 0 0
5 7 1 2 6 0 0 0 0
7 7 3 . 0 0 0 4 6 9
	
	 Thus, A = 773.000469 in2.
	 4.	 Check.  We obtain a partial check by estimating the product:
A = 27.063 * 28.563 ≈25 * 30 = 750.
	
	 The estimate is close to 773, so the answer is probably correct.
	 5.	 State.  The area of the opening is about 773 in2. Since 773 7 720, the 
windows meet the first-floor code.

Tracking a Bank Balance. 
Revenue of U.S. banks from 
checking account overdraft charges was $31.5 billion in a recent fiscal year. 
(Source: Moebs Services) To avoid overdrafts and to track her spending, Mag-
gie keeps a running account of her banking transactions. She checks her 
balance online, but because of pending amounts that post later, she keeps 
a separate record. Maggie had $2432.27 in her account. She used her debit 
card to pay her rent of $835 and make purchases of $14.13, $38.60, and 
$205.98. She then deposited her weekly pay of $748.35. What was her bal-
ance after these transactions?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We first find the total of the debits. Then we find how 
much is left in the account after the debits are deducted. Finally, we 
add to this amount the deposit to find the balance in the account after 
all the transactions.
	2, 3.  Translate and Solve.  We let d = the total amount of the debits. We 
are combining amounts: $835 + $14.13 + $38.60 + $205.98 = d. 
To solve the equation, we add.
835 . 00

Thus, d = 1093.71.
Now let a = the amount in the account after the debits are deducted. 
We subtract: $2432.27 - $1093.71 = a.

Do Exercise 5.
example 6  Gas Mileage.  Ava filled her gas tank and noted that the 
odometer read 67,507.8. After the next fill-up, the odometer read 68,006.1. 
It took 16.5 gal to fill the tank. How many miles per gallon did Ava get?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We first make a drawing.
n miles, 16.5 gallons
	
	 This is a two-step problem. First, we find the number of miles that 
have been driven between fill-ups. We let n = the number of miles 
driven.
	2, 3.  Translate and Solve.  We translate and solve as follows:

To solve the equation, we subtract 67,507.8 on both sides:
 n = 68,006.1 - 67,507.8
 = 498.3.
6 8 , 0 0 6 . 1
- 6 7 , 5 0 7 . 8
4 9 8 . 3
Next, we divide the total number of miles driven 
by the number of gallons. This gives us m =
the number of miles per gallon—that is, the gas 
­mileage. The division that corresponds to the 
situation is 498.3 , 16.5 = m. To find the number 
m, we divide.
Thus, m = 30.2.
	 4.	 Check.  To check, we first multiply the number of miles per gallon 
times the number of gallons to find the number of miles driven:
16.5 * 30.2 = 498.3.
	
	 Then we add 498.3 to 67,507.8 to find the new odometer reading:
67,507.8 + 498.3 = 68,006.1.
	
	 The gas mileage of 30.2 checks.
	 5.	 State.  Ava got 30.2 miles per gallon.

Ratio
A ratio is the quotient of two quantities.
The average wind speed in Chicago is 10.4 mph. The average wind speed in 
Boston is 12.5 mph. The ratio of average wind speed in Chicago to average 
wind speed in Boston is written using colon notation,
Chicago wind speed  
  10.4 : 12.5,  
  Boston wind speed
or fraction notation,
10.4
12.5.
We read both forms of notation as “the ratio of 10.4 to 12.5.”
  
  Chicago wind speed

SECTION  5.1  Introduction to Ratios
 b 	 Simplifying Notation for Ratios
Sometimes a ratio can be simplified. Simplifying provides a means of find-
ing other numbers with the same ratio.
example 8 
Find the ratio of 6 to 8. Then simplify to find two other 
numbers in the same ratio.
We write the ratio in fraction notation and then simplify:
6
8 = 2 # 3
2 # 4 = 2
2 # 3
4 = 1 # 3
4 = 3
4.
Thus, 3 and 4 have the same ratio as 6 and 8. We can express this by saying 
“6 is to 8 as 3 is to 4.”
Do Exercise 8.
example 9  Find the ratio of 2.4 to 10. Then simplify to find two other 
numbers in the same ratio.
We first write the ratio in fraction notation. Next, we multiply by 1 to 
clear the decimal from the numerator. Then we simplify.
2.4
10 = 2.4
10 # 10
10 = 24
100 = 4 # 6
4 # 25 = 4
4 # 6
25 = 6
25
Thus, 2.4 is to 10 as 6 is to 25.
Do Exercises 9 and 10.
example 10  An HDTV screen that measures approximately 46 in. diago-
nally has a width of 40 in. and a height of 22 1
2 in. Find the ratio of width to 
height and simplify.

10 = 400
225
 = 25 # 16
25 # 9 = 25
25 # 16
9
 = 16
9 .
Thus we can say that the ratio of width to height is 16 to 9, which can also 
be expressed as 16 : 9.
Do Exercise 11.
	 8.	 Find the ratio of 18 to 27. Then 
simplify to find two other 
numbers in the same ratio.
	10.	 Find the ratio of 1.2 to 1.5. 
Then simplify to find two other

	11.	 An HDTV screen that 
measures 44 in. diagonally has 
a width of 38.4 in. and a height

Rate
When a ratio is used to compare two different kinds of measure, we 
call it a rate.
Suppose David’s car travels 475.4 mi on 16.8 gal of gasoline. Is the gas 
­mileage (mpg) of his car better than that of the Honda Odyssey above? 
To determine this, it helps to convert the ratio to decimal notation and 
­perhaps round. Thus we have
475.4 miles
16.8 gallons = 475.4
16.8  mpg ≈28.298 mpg.
Since 28.298 7 28, David’s car gets better gas mileage than the Honda 
­Odyssey does.

SECTION  5.2  Rates and Unit Prices
Unit prices enable us to do comparison shopping and determine the 
best buy for a product on the basis of price. It is often helpful to change all 
prices to cents so that we can compare unit prices more easily.
example 6 
Unit Price of Salad Dressing. 
At the request of his cus-
tomers, Angelo started bottling and selling the basil and lemon salad dress-
ing that he serves in his café. The dressing is sold in four sizes of containers 
as listed in the table below. Compute the unit price of each size of container 
and determine which size is the best buy on the basis of unit price alone.
Size

Unit Price
10 oz
$2.49
16 oz
$3.59
20 oz
$4.09
32 oz
$6.79
We compute the unit price of each size and fill in the chart:
 10 oz: $2.49
10 oz = 249 cents
10 oz
= 249
10  cents
oz
= 24.900¢>oz;
 16 oz: $3.59
16 oz = 359 cents
16 oz

On the basis of unit price alone, we see that the 20-oz container is the 
best buy.
Do Exercise 7.
Although we often think that “bigger is cheaper,” this is not always the 
case, as we see in Example 6. In addition, even when a larger package has a 
lower unit price than a smaller package, it still might not be the best buy for 
you. For example, some of the food in a large package could spoil before it 
is used, or you might not have room to store a large package.

CHAPTER  5  Ratio and Proportion
 a 	 Proportions
When two pairs of numbers, such as 3, 2 and 6, 4, have the same ratio, we 
say that they are proportional. The equation
3
2 = 6
4
states that the pairs 3, 2 and 6, 4 are proportional. Such an equation is called a 
proportion. We sometimes read 3
2 = 6
4 as “3 is to 2 as 6 is to 4.”
Since ratios can be written using fraction notation, we can use the test 
for equality of fractions to determine whether two ratios are the same.

Do Exercise 6.
 b 	 Solving Proportions
One way to solve a proportion is to use cross products. Then we can divide 
on both sides to get the variable alone.
example 5  Solve the proportion x
3 = 4
6.
 x
3 = 4
6
 x # 6 = 3 # 4    Equating cross products (finding cross products  
and setting them equal)
 x # 6
6
= 3 # 4
6     Dividing by 6 on both sides
 x = 3 # 4
6
= 12
6 = 2
We can check that 2 is the solution by replacing x with 2 and finding cross 
products:
2 # 6 = 12   
2
3 =
? 4
6   
3 # 4 = 12.
Since the cross products are the same, it follows that 2
3 = 4
6. Thus the pairs 
of numbers 2, 3 and 4, 6 are proportional, and 2 is the solution of the 
­proportion.
Solving Proportions
To solve x
a = c
d for x, equate cross products and divide on both sides 
to get x alone.

SECTION  5.4  Applications of Proportions
Studying for Success      Applications
	
If you find applied problems challenging, don’t give up! Your skill will improve with each problem  
you solve.
	
Make applications real! Look for applications of the math you are studying in newspapers and magazines.
 a 	 Applications and Problem Solving
Proportions have applications in such diverse fields as business, chemis-
try, health sciences, and home economics, as well as in many areas of daily 
life. Proportions are useful in making predictions.
example 1 
Predicting Total Distance.  Donna drives her delivery van 
800 mi in 3 days. At this rate, how far will she drive in 15 days?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We let d = the distance traveled in 15 days.
	 2.	 Translate.  We translate to a proportion. We make each side the ratio 
of distance to time, with distance in the numerator and time in the 
denominator.
d
15 = 800
3
	
	 It may help to verbalize the proportion above as “the unknown dis-
tance d is to 15 days as the known distance 800 mi is to 3 days.”
	 3.	 Solve.  Next, we solve the proportion:
 d # 3 = 15 # 800    Equating cross products
 d # 3
3
= 15 # 800
3
    Dividing by 3 on both sides
 d = 15 # 800
3
 d = 4000.
    Multiplying and dividing
	 4.	 Check.  We substitute into the proportion and check cross products:
4000
15
= 800
3 ;
4000 # 3 = 12,000;  15 # 800 = 12,000.
	
	 The cross products are the same.
	 5.	 State.  Donna will drive 4000 mi in 15 days.
Do Margin Exercise 1.
Problems involving proportions can be translated in more than one 
way. For Example 1, any one of the following is also a correct translation:
15
d =
3
800 ,    15
3 =
d
800 ,    800
d
= 3
15 .
Equating the cross products in each proportion gives us the equation 
d # 3 = 15 # 800, which is the equation we obtained in Example 1.

Recommended Dosage. 
To control a fever, a doctor sug-
gests that a child who weighs 28 kg be given 320 mg of a liquid pain reliever. 
If the dosage is proportional to the child’s weight, how much of the medica-
tion is recommended for a child who weighs 35 kg?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We let t = the number of milligrams of the liquid pain 
reliever recommended for a child who weighs 35 kg.
	 2.	 Translate.  We translate to a proportion, keeping the amount of medica-
tion in the numerators.
320
28 =
t
35
	 3.	 Solve.  Next, we solve the proportion:
 320 # 35 = 28 # t    Equating cross products
 320 # 35
28
= 28 # t
28     Dividing by 28 on both sides
 320 # 35
28
= t
 400 = t.
    Multiplying and dividing
	 4.	 Check.  We substitute into the proportion and check cross products:
320
28 = 400
35 ;
320 # 35 = 11,200;    28 # 400 = 11,200.
	
	 The cross products are the same.

Do Exercise 2.
example 3  Purchasing Tickets.  Carey bought 8 tickets to an interna-
tional food festival for $52. How many tickets could she purchase with $90?

chased with $90.

ets in the numerators.

	 3.	 Solve.  Next, we solve the proportion:
 52 # n = 8 # 90    Equating cross products
 52 # n
52
= 8 # 90
52
    Dividing by 52 on both sides
 n = 8 # 90
52
 n ≈13.8.     Multiplying and dividing
	
	 Because it is impossible to buy a fractional part of a ticket, we must 
round our answer down to 13.
	 4.	 Check.  As a check, we use a different approach: We find the cost 
per ticket and then divide $90 by that price. Since 52 , 8 = 6.50 and 
90 , 6.50 ≈13.8, we have a check.
	 5.	 State.  Carey could purchase 13 tickets with $90.

	 2.	 Translate.  Then we translate to a proportion, using 0.75 for 3
4 in.
0.75
2.25 = 4.3

	 3.	 Solve.  Next, we solve the proportion:
 0.75 * w = 2.25 * 4.3    Equating cross products
 0.75 * w
0.75
= 2.25 * 4.3
0.75

 0.75
2.25 = 4.3
12.9;
 0.75 * 12.9 = 9.675;    2.25 * 4.3 = 9.675.

Estimating a Wildlife Population. 
Scientists often use 
proportions to estimate the size of a wildlife population. They begin by 
­collecting and marking, or tagging, a portion of the population. This 
tagged sample is released and mingles with the entire population. At a 
later date, the scientists collect a second sample from the population. 
The proportion of tagged individuals in the second sample is ­estimated 
to be the same as the proportion of tagged individuals in the entire 
population.
The marking can be done by using actual tags or by identifying in-
dividuals in other ways. For example, marine biologists can identify an 
­individual whale by the patterns on its tail. Recently, scientists have begun 
using DNA to identify individuals in populations. For example, to identify 
individual bears in the grizzly bear population of the Northern Continen-
tal Divide ecosystem in Montana, geneticists use DNA from fur samples 
left on branches near the bears’ feeding areas.
In one recent large-scale study in this ecosystem, biologists identified 
545 individual grizzly bears. If later a sample of 30 bears contained 25 of 
the previously identified individuals, estimate the total number of bears in 
the ecosystem.
Source: Based on information from the Northern Divide Grizzly Bear Project
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We let B = the total number of bears in the ecosystem. 
We assume that the ratio of the number of identified bears to the total 
number of bears in the ecosystem is the same as the ratio of the num-
ber of identified bears in the later sample to the total number of bears 
in the later sample.
	 2.	 Translate.  We translate to a proportion as follows.
545
B
= 25
30
	 3.	 Solve.  Next, we solve the proportion:
 545 # 30 = B # 25    Equating cross products
 545 # 30
25
= B # 25
25
    Dividing by 25 on both sides
 545 # 30
25
= B
 654 = B.
    Multiplying and dividing
	 4.	 Check.  We substitute into the proportion and check cross products:
545
654 = 25
30;
545 # 30 = 16,350;  654 # 25 = 16,350.
	
	 The cross products are the same.
	 5.	 State.  We estimate that there are 654 bears in the ecosystem.

are caught, and it is found that

The ratio 1 : 3 : 2 is used to estimate the relative costs of a CD player, receiver, and speakers when shopping for a 
sound system. That is, the receiver should cost three times the amount spent on the CD player and the speakers should 
cost twice the amount spent on the CD player. If you had $900 to spend, how would you allocate the money, using this 
ratio?

CHAPTER  5  Ratio and Proportion
 a 	 Proportions and Similar Triangles
Look at the pair of triangles below. Note that they appear to have the 
same shape, but their sizes are different. These are examples of similar 
­triangles. You can imagine using a magnifying glass to enlarge the smaller 
triangle so that it looks the same as the larger one. This process works be-
cause the corresponding sides of each triangle have the same ratio. That is, 
the following proportion is true.

Similar Triangles
Similar triangles have the same shape. The lengths of their corre-

The ratio of x to 9 is the same as the ratio of 24 to 8 or 21 to 7. We get the 
proportions

We can solve either one of these proportions. We use the first one:
 x

 x # 8 = 9 # 24    Equating cross products
 x # 8

= 9 # 24

    Dividing by 8 on both sides
 x = 27.

The missing length x is 27. Other proportions could also be used.

SECTION  5.5  Geometric Applications
Similar triangles and proportions can often be used to find lengths 
that would ordinarily be difficult to measure. For example, we could find 
the height of a flagpole without climbing it or the distance across a river 
without crossing it.
example 2  How high is a flagpole that casts a 56-ft shadow at the same 
time that a 6-ft man casts a 5-ft shadow?
Sun’s
rays
56 ft
Sun’s
rays
5 ft
6 ft
p
If we use the sun’s rays to represent the third side of the triangle in our 
drawing of the situation, we see that we have similar triangles. Let p = the 
height of the flagpole. The ratio of 6 to p is the same as the ratio of 5 to 56. 
Thus we have the proportion
6
p = 5
56.
Solve:   6 # 56 = p # 5    Equating cross products
 6 # 56
5
= p # 5
5     Dividing by 5 on both sides
 6 # 56
5
= p
    Simplifying
 67.2 = p.
The height of the flagpole is 67.2 ft.
Do Exercise 2.
example 3  Rafters of a House.  Carpenters use similar triangles to de-
termine the length of rafters for a house. They first choose the pitch of the 
roof, or the ratio of the rise over the run. Then using a triangle with that ratio, 
they calculate the length of the rafters needed for the house. Loren is making 
rafters for a roof with a 6>12 pitch on a house that is 30 ft wide. Using a rafter 
guide, Loren knows that the rafter length corresponding to the 6>12 pitch is 
13.4. Find the length x of the rafters for this house to the nearest tenth of a foot.

52 ft, what will the actual height of the addition be?
12 cm
15 cm

h
Solve:   12 # h = 52 # 15
Equating cross products
 12 # h
12
= 52 # 15
12
Dividing by 12 on both sides
 h = 52 # 15
12

Thus the height of the addition will be 65 ft.

Bicycle Design. 
Two ­important 
dimensions to consider when buying a bicycle are 
stack and reach, as illustrated in the ­diagram at the 
right. The Country Racer bicycle comes in six differ-
ent frame sizes, each proportional to the ­others. In 
the smallest frame size, the stack is 50 cm and the 
reach is 37.5 cm. In the largest size, the stack is 60 
cm. What is the reach in the largest frame size of the 
Country Racer?
We let r = the  reach in the largest frame size. Then we translate to a 
proportion.
	
50
37.5 = 60
r
Solve: 
 50 # r = 37.5 # 60
  Equating cross products
 50 # r
50
= 37.5 # 60
50
  Dividing by 50 on both sides
 r = 37.5 # 60
50
= 45.
Thus the reach in the largest frame size is 45 cm.

CHAPTER  6  Percent Notation
 a 	 Understanding Percent Notation
Today almost half of the world’s population lives in cities. It is estimated 
that by 2050, 70% of the population will live in cities. What does 70% mean? 
It means that of every 100 people on Earth in 2050, 70 will live in cities. 
Thus, 70% is a ratio of 70 to 100, or 70
100.

SECTION  6.1  Percent Notation
This definition leads us to the following equivalent ways of defining 
percent notation.
Notation For n%
Percent notation, n%, can be expressed using:
ratio 
 n% = the ratio of n to 100 =
n
100,
fraction notation 
 n% = n *
1
100,  or
decimal notation 
 n% = n * 0.01.
example 1  Write three kinds of notation for 67.8%.
Using ratio:	
 67.8% = 67.8
100
    A ratio of 67.8 to 100
Using fraction notation: 
 67.8% = 67.8 *
1
100     Replacing % with *
1
100
Using decimal notation:	  67.8% = 67.8 * 0.01    Replacing % with * 0.01
Do Exercises 1–4.
 b 	 Converting Between Percent  
Notation and Decimal Notation
Consider 78%. To convert to decimal notation, we can think of percent 
­notation as a ratio and write
 78% = 78
100     Using the definition of percent as a ratio
 = 0.78.    Dividing
Similarly,
4.9% = 4.9
100 = 0.049.
We can also convert 78% to decimal notation by replacing “%” with 
“*  0.01” and writing
 78% = 78 * 0.01    Replacing % with * 0.01
 = 0.78.
    Multiplying
Similarly,
4.9% = 4.9 * 0.01 = 0.049.
Dividing by 100 amounts to moving the decimal point two places to 
the left, which is the same as multiplying by 0.01. This leads us to a quick 
way to convert from percent notation to decimal notation: We drop the per-
cent symbol and move the decimal point two places to the left.
During 2011, 42.2% of electricity in  
the United States was generated  
using coal.

It is thought that the Roman 
emperor Augustus began 
percent notation by taxing 
goods sold at a rate of 1
100. In 
time, the symbol “%” evolved 
by interchanging the parts of 
the symbol “100” to “0>0” and 
then to “%.”

Converting from Percent 
­Notation to Decimal Notation
Many calculators have a  %  key 
that can be used to convert from 
percent notation to decimal 
­notation. This is often the second 
operation associated with a partic-
ular key and is accessed by first 
pressing a  2nd  or  SHIFT  key. To 
convert 57.6% to decimal notation, 
for example, you might press 5  
7   #  
6    2nd    %  or 5  
7  
#  
6    SHIFT    %  . The display 
would read 
0.576  , so  
57.6% = 0.576.

To convert 0.38 to percent notation, we can first write fraction notation, 
as follows:
 0.38 = 38
100     Converting to fraction notation
 = 38%.    Using the definition of percent as a ratio
Note that 100% = 100 * 0.01 = 1. Thus to convert 0.38 to percent 
­notation, we can multiply by 1, using 100% as a symbol for 1.
 0.38 = 0.38 * 1
 = 0.38 * 100%
 = 0.38 * 100 * 0.01
    Replacing 100% with 100 * 0.01
 = 10.38 * 1002 * 0.01    Using the associative law of 
multiplication
 = 38 * 0.01
 = 38%
    Replacing * 0.01 with %
Even more quickly, since 0.38 = 0.38 * 100%, we can simply multiply 0.38 
by 100 and write the % symbol.
To convert from decimal notation to percent notation, we multiply by 
100%. That is, we move the decimal point two places to the right and write 
a percent symbol.

Notation 
A calculator can be 
used to ­convert from fraction 
notation to percent notation. We 
­simply ­perform the division on the 
­calculator and then use the ­percent 
key. To convert 17
40 to percent 
­notation, for example, we press 
1   7   ,   4   0   2nd   %  , or
1   7   ,   4   0   SHIFT   %  .
The display reads         42.5  , so   
17
40 = 42.5%.

SECTION  6.2  Percent Notation and Fraction Notation
In some cases, division is not the fastest way to convert a fraction to 
percent notation. The following are some optional ways in which the 
­conversion might be done.
example 3  Find percent notation for 69
100.
We use the definition of percent as a ratio.
69
100 = 69%	
example 4  Find percent notation for 17
20.
We want to multiply by 1 to get 100 in the denominator. We think of 
what we must multiply 20 by in order to get 100. That number is 5, so we 
multiply by 1 using 5
5.
17
20 # 5
5 = 85
100 = 85%
Note that this shortcut works only when the denominator is a factor 
of 100.
example 5  Find percent notation for 18

25 = 18

are used so often it would speed up your work if you memorized them. For 
example, 1
3 = 0.3, so we say that the decimal equivalent of 1
3 is 0.3, or that 
0.3 has the fraction equivalent 1

CHAPTER  6  Percent Notation
 b 	 Solving Percent Problems
In solving percent problems, we use the Translate and Solve steps in the 
problem-solving strategy used throughout this text.
Percent problems are actually of three different types. Although the 
method we present does not require that you be able to identify which type 
you are solving, it is helpful to know them. Each of the three types of percent 
problems depends on which of the three pieces of information is missing.
	 1.	 Finding the amount (the result of taking the percent)
	
	 Example:	
What  is  25%  of  60?
	
	 Translation:	
a	
= 	 25%	 # 	 60
	 2.	 Finding the base (the number you are taking the percent of)
	
	 Example:	
15  is  25%  of  what?
	
	 Translation:	
15	 = 	 25%	 # 	
b
	 3.	 Finding the percent number  (the percent itself)
	
	 Example:	
15  is  what percent  of  60?
	
	 Translation:	
15	 = 	
p	
# 	
60
Finding the Amount
example 7  What is 17.9% of $14,660,000,000,000?
Translate:  a = 17.9% * 14,660,000,000,000.
Solve:  The letter is by itself. To solve the equation, we convert 17.9% to 
­decimal notation and multiply:
 a = 17.9% * 14,660,000,000,000
 = 0.179 * 14,660,000,000,000 = 2,624,140,000,000.
Thus, $2,624,140,000,000 is 17.9% of $14,660,000,000,000. The answer is 
$2,624,140,000,000, or about $2.6 trillion.
Do Exercise 7.
example 8  120% of 42 is what?
Translate:  120% * 42 = a.
Solve:  The letter is by itself. To solve the equation, we carry out the 
calculation:
a = 120% * 42
 a = 1.2 * 42
   
120% = 1.2
 a = 50.4.
Thus, 120% of 42 is 50.4. The answer is 50.4.
Do Exercise 8.
The U.S. gross domestic product for 
2010 was approximately $14.66 ­trillion. 
Of that amount, Americans spent 
17.9% on health care. What was spent 
on health care? (See Example 7.)

SECTION  6.3  Solving Percent Problems Using Percent Equations 
Finding the Base
example 9  8% of what is 32?
Translate:  8% * b = 32.
Solve:  This time the letter is not by itself. To solve the equation, we ­divide 
by 8% on both sides:
 8% * b
8%
= 32
8%     Dividing by 8% on both sides
 b =
32
0.08   
8% = 0.08
 b = 400.
Thus, 8% of 400 is 32. The answer is 400.
example 10  $3 is 16% of what?
Translate:  $3  is  16%  of  what?
	
	 	
3	
= 	 16%	
* 	
b
Solve:  To solve the equation, we divide by 16% on both sides:
 3
16% = 16% * b
16%
    Dividing by 16% on both sides
 3
0.16 = b
   
16% = 0.16
 18.75 = b.
Thus, $3 is 16% of $18.75. The answer is $18.75.
Do Exercises 9 and 10.
Finding the Percent Number
In solving these problems, you must remember to convert to percent 
­notation after you have solved the equation.
example 11  414,000 is what percent of 621,000?
Translate:  414,000 is what percent of 621,000?
	
	 	
414,000	 =	
p	
* 	 621,000
Solve:  To solve the equation, we divide by 621,000 on both sides and 
­convert the result to percent notation:
 p * 621,000 = 414,000
 p * 621,000
621,000
= 414,000
621,000
    Dividing by 621,000 on both sides
 p = 0.666c
    Converting to decimal notation
 p = 66.6%, or 66 2
3  %.    Converting to percent notation
Thus, 414,000 is 66 2
3  % of 621,000. The answer is 66 2
3 %.

Caution!
When a question asks “what percent?”, be sure to give the answer in percent 
notation.
Using Percents in Computations 
Many calculators have a %  key that can be used in computations. (See the Calculator  
Corner on page 362.) For example, to find 11% of 49, we press  1  1  2nd  %  *  4  9  =  , or 4  9  *  1  1  SHIFT  %  .  
The display reads 
5.39  , so 11% of 49 is 5.39.
In Example 9, we performed the computation 32/8%. To use the %  key in this computation, we press  3  2  ,  8  2nd   
%  =  , or 3  2  ,  8  SHIFT  %  . The result is 400.
We can also use the  %  key to find the percent number in a problem. In Example 11, for instance, we answered the question 
“414,000 is what percent of 621,000?” On a calculator, we press 4  1  4  0  0  0  ,  6  2  1  0  0  0  2nd  %  =  , or  
4  1  4  0  0  0  ,  6  2  1  0  0  0  SHIFT  %  . The result is 66.6, so 414,000 is 66.6% of 621,000.

To solve a percent problem using a proportion, we translate as follows:
N
100 = a
b
Number 
100 
 Amount
 Base
You might find it helpful to read this as  
“part is to whole as part is to whole.”
For example, 60% of 25 is 15 translates to
60
100 = 15
25
A clue for translating is that the base, b, corresponds to 100 and usu-
ally follows the wording “percent of.” Also, N% always translates to N>100. 
Another aid in translating is to make a comparison drawing. To do this, 
we start with the percent side and list 0% at the top and 100% near the bot-
tom. Then we estimate where the specified percent—in this case, 60%—is 
located. The corresponding quantities are then filled in. The base—in this 
case, 25—always corresponds to 100%, and the amount—in this case, 15—
corresponds to the specified percent.

force is age 65 or older. In 2012, there 
were approximately 154,000,000

that about 7,700,000 workers were age 
65 or older.

 b 	 Solving Percent Problems
After a percent problem has been translated to a proportion, we solve as in 
Section 5.3.
example 7  5% of what is $20?
 Translate: 5
100 = 20
b
 Solve: 5 # b = 100 # 20    Equating cross products
 5 # b
5
= 100 # 20
5
    Dividing by 5
 b = 2000
5
 b = 400
    Simplifying
Thus, 5% of $400 is $20. The answer is $400.
Do Exercise 8.
example 8  120% of 42 is what?
Translate: 120
100 = a
42
 Solve: 120 # 42 = 100 # a    Equating cross products
 120 # 42
100
= 100 # a
100
    Dividing by 100

100 = a
 50.4 = a
    Simplifying
Thus, 120% of 42 is 50.4. The answer is 50.4.

5500, or 1

CHAPTER  6  Percent Notation
 b 	 Percent Increase or Decrease
Percent is often used to state an increase or a decrease. Let’s consider an 
example of each, using the price of a car as the original number.
Percent Increase
One year a car sold for $20,455. The manufacturer decides to raise the price 
of the following year’s model by 6%. The increase is 0.06 * $20,455, or 
$1227.30. The new price is $20,455 + $1227.30, or $21,682.30. Note that the 
new price is 106% of the former price.
New price: $21,682.30

New price:

The increase, $1227.30, is 6% of the former price, $20,455. The percent 
increase is 6%.
Percent Decrease
Abigail buys the car listed above for $20,455. After one year, the car depre-
ciates in value by 25%. The decrease is 0.25 * $20,455, or $5113.75. This 
lowers the value of the car to $20,455 - $5113.75, or $15,341.25. Note that 
the new value is 75% of the original price. If Abigail decides to sell the car 
after one year, $15,341.25 might be the most she could expect to get for it.

For proportion, N% = p.
	 3.	 Solve.  We have two ways in  
which to solve the problem.
	
	 Percent equation:
 778 = p * 11,143
 778
11,143 = p * 11,143
11,143
    Dividing by 11,143 on both sides

11,143
    Dividing by 11,143 on both sides
 N = 77,800

	 4.	 Check.  To check, we note that, with a 7% decrease, the closing Dow 
average should be 93% of the opening average. Since
93% * 11,143 = 0.93 * 11,143 ≈10,363,
 
 and 10,363 is close to 10,365, our answer checks. (Remember that we

Sales Tax, Commission, and Discount
 a 	 Sales Tax
Sales tax computations represent a special type of percent increase prob-
lem. The sales tax rate in Colorado is 2.9%. This means that the tax is 2.9% 
of the purchase price. Suppose the purchase price of a canoe is $749.95. The 
sales tax is then 2.9% of $749.95, or 0.029 * $749.95, or $21.74855, which is 
about $21.75.
$749.95
+2.9% sales tax
COLORADO
The total that you would pay for the canoe is the purchase price plus the 
sales tax:
$749.95 + $21.75, or $771.70.
Bill:
Purchase price  =  $749.95
Sales tax 
12.9% of $749.952    =  + 21.75
Total price
$771.70
Sales Tax
Sales tax = Sales tax rate * Purchase price
Total price = Purchase price + Sales tax
example 1 
Maine Sales Tax.  The sales tax rate in Maine is 5%. How 
much tax is charged on the purchase of 3 shrubs at $42.99 each? What is 
the total price?
	a)	 We first find the purchase price of the 3 shrubs. It is
3 * $42.99 = $128.97.
b)	 The sales tax on items costing $128.97 is
Sales tax rate  *  Purchase price
	
5%	
* 	
128.97,
	 	 or 0.05 * 128.97, or 6.4485. Thus the tax is $6.45 (rounded  
to the nearest cent).
c)	 The total price is given by the purchase price plus the sales tax:
$128.97 + $6.45, or $135.42.
To check, note that the total price is the purchase price plus 5% of the 
purchase price. Thus the total price is 105% of the purchase price. Since 
1.05 * 128.97 ≈135.42, we have a check. The sales tax is $6.45, and the 
total price is $135.42.

example 8 
The price of a snowblower is marked down from $950 to 
$779. What is the rate of discount?
We first find the discount by subtracting the sale price from the origi-

950 - 779 = 171.
The discount is $171.
Next, we use the equation for discount:

Simple Interest Formula
The simple interest I on principal P, invested for t years at interest 
rate r, is given by
I = P # r # t.
 a 	 Simple Interest
Suppose you put $1000 into an investment for 1 year. The $1000 is called 
the principal. If the interest rate is 5%, in addition to the principal, you get 
back 5% of the principal, which is
5% of $1000,  or 
0.05 * $1000,  or  $50.00.
The $50.00 is called simple interest. It is, in effect, the price that a financial 
institution pays for the use of the money over time.

Do Exercise 3.
 b 	 Compound Interest
When interest is paid on interest, we call it compound interest. This is the 
type of interest usually paid on investments. Suppose you have $5000 in 
a savings account at 6%. In 1 year, the account will contain the original 
$5000 plus 6% of $5000. Thus the total in the account after 1 year will be
106% of $5000,  or  1.06 * $5000,  or  $5300.
Now suppose that the total of $5300 remains in the account for another 
year. At the end of this second year, the account will contain the $5300 plus 
6% of $5300. The total in the account would thus be
106% of $5300,  or  1.06 * $5300,  or  $5618.
Note that in the second year, interest is also earned on the first year’s inter-
est. When this happens, we say that interest is compounded annually.

CHAPTER  6  Percent Notation
Suppose that the interest in Example 4 were compounded semi- 
­annually—that is, every half year. Interest would then be calculated twice 
a year at a rate of 8% , 2, or 4% each time. The approach used in Example 4 
can then be adapted, as follows.
After the first 1
2 year, the account will contain 104% of $2000:
1.04 * $2000 = $2080.
After a second 1
2 year (1 full year), the account will contain 104% of $2080:
1.04 * $2080 = $2163.20.
After a third 1
2 year (1 1
2 full years), the account will contain 104% of $2163.20:
 1.04 * $2163.20 = $2249.728
 ≈$2249.73.     Rounding to the nearest cent
Finally, after a fourth 1
2 year (2 full years), the account will contain 104% of 
$2249.73:
 1.04 * $2249.73 = $2339.7192
 ≈$2339.72.     Rounding to the nearest cent
Let’s summarize our results and look at them another way:
End of 1st 1
2 year	
  1.04 * 2000 = 2000 * 11.0421;
End of 2nd 1
2 year	
  1.04 * 11.04 * 20002 = 2000 * 11.0422;
End of 3rd 1
2 year	
  1.04 * 11.04 * 1.04 * 20002 = 2000 * 11.0423;
End of 4th 1
2 year	
  1.04 * 11.04 * 1.04 * 1.04 * 20002 = 2000 * 11.0424.
Note that each multiplication was by 1.04 and that
$2000 * 1.044 ≈$2339.72.    Using a calculator and rounding to the 
nearest cent
We have illustrated the following result.
Compound Interest Formula
If a principal P has been invested at interest rate r, compounded  
n times a year, in t years it will grow to an amount A given by
A = P # a1 + r
n b
n# t
.
Let’s apply this formula to confirm our preceding discussion, where 
the amount invested is P = $2000, the number of years is t = 2, and the 
number of compounding periods each year is n = 2. Substituting into the 
compound interest formula, we have
 A = P # a1 + r
n b
n# t
= 2000 # a1 + 8%
2 b
2# 2
 = $2000 # a1 + 0.08
2 b
4
= $200011.0424
 = $2000 * 1.16985856 ≈$2339.72.
If you were using a calculator, you could perform this computation in one step.

Compound Interest 
A calculator is useful in computing compound interest. Not only does it perform computations quickly but 
it also eliminates the need to round until the computation is completed. This minimizes round-off errors that occur when rounding is 
done at each stage of the computation. We must keep order of operations in mind when computing compound interest.
To find the amount due on a $20,000 loan made for 25 days at 11% interest, compounded daily, we compute
 20,000a1 + 0.11
365 b
25
. To do this on a calculator, we press 2  0  0  0  0  *  1  1  +  #  1  1  ,  3  6  5  2  y x   
(or ^  ) 2  5  =  . The result is $20,151.23, rounded to the nearest cent.
Some calculators have business keys that allow such computations to be done more quickly.

 c 	 Credit Cards
According to nerdwallet.com, the average credit-card debt among 
U.S. households with such debt was $15,162 per household in 
2012. According to the Aggregate Revolving Consumer Debt Sur-
vey in 2012, the average credit-card debt carried by undergradu-
ate college students is $3137.
The money you obtain through the use of a credit card is not 
“free” money. There is a price (interest) to be paid for the conve-
nience of using a credit card. A balance carried on a credit card is 
a type of loan. Comparing interest rates is essential if one is to be-
come financially responsible. A small change in an interest rate 
can make a large difference in the cost of a loan. When you make 
a payment on a credit-card balance, do you know how much of 
that payment is interest and how much is applied to reducing the 
principal?

CHAPTER  6  Percent Notation
example 6 
Credit Cards.  After the holidays, Addison has a balance 
of $3216.28 on a credit card with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 19.7%. 
She decides not to make additional purchases with this card until she has 
paid off the balance.
	a)	 Many credit cards require a minimum monthly payment of 2% of the 
balance. At this rate, what is Sarah’s minimum payment on a balance of 
$3216.28? Round the answer to the nearest dollar.
	b)	 Find the amount of interest and the amount applied to reduce the prin-
cipal in the minimum payment found in part (a).
c)	 If Addison had transferred her balance to a card with an APR of 12.5%, 
how much of her first payment would be interest and how much would 
be applied to reduce the principal?
	d)	Compare the amounts for 12.5% from part (c) with the amounts for 
19.7% from part (b).
We solve as follows.
	a)	 We multiply the balance of $3216.28 by 2%:
0.02 * $3216.28 = $64.3256.    Addison’s minimum payment, 
rounded to the nearest dollar, is $64.
	b)	 The amount of interest on $3216.28 at 19.7% for one month* is given by
I = P # r # t = $3216.28 * 0.197 * 1
12 ≈$52.80.
	 	 We subtract to find the portion of the first payment applied to reduce 
the principal:
 Amount applied to
reduce the principal = Minimum payment - Interest for
the month
 = $64 - $52.80
 = $11.20.
  Thus the principal of $3216.28 is decreased by only $11.20 with the first 
payment. (Addison still owes $3205.08.)
c)	 The amount of interest on $3216.28 at 12.5% for one month is
I = P # r # t = $3216.28 * 0.125 * 1
12 ≈$33.50.
	 	 We subtract to find the amount applied to reduce the principal in the 
first payment:
 Amount applied to
reduce the principal = Minimum payment - Interest for
the month
 = $64 - $33.50
 = $30.50.
  Thus the principal of $3216.28 would have decreased by $30.50 with the 
first payment. (Addison would still owe $3185.78.)
*Actually, the interest on a credit card is computed daily with a rate called a daily 
percentage rate (DPR). The DPR for Example 6 would be 19.7%>365 = 0.054%. When 
no payments or additional purchases are made during a month, the difference in total 
interest for the month is minimal and we will not deal with it here.

417
SECTION  6.7  Simple Interest and Compound Interest; Credit Cards
At 19.7%, the interest is $52.80 and the principal is decreased by $11.20. 
At 12.5%, the interest is $33.50 and the principal is decreased by $30.50. 
Thus the interest at 19.7% is $52.80 - $33.50, or $19.30, greater than the 
interest at 12.5%. Thus the principal is decreased by $30.50 - $11.20, or 
$19.30, more with the 12.5% rate than with the 19.7% rate.
Do Exercise 6.
d)	Let’s organize the information for both rates in the following table.

Even though the mathematics of the information in the table below is 
beyond the scope of this text, it is interesting to compare how long it takes 
to pay off the balance of Example 6 if Addison continues to pay $64 each 
month, compared to how long it takes if she pays double that amount, or 
$128, each month. Financial consultants frequently tell clients that if they 
want to take control of their debt, they should pay double the minimum 
payment.

As with most loans, if you pay an extra amount toward the principal 
with each payment, the length of the loan can be greatly reduced. Note 
that at the rate of 19.7%, it will take Addison almost 9 years to pay off her 
debt if she pays only $64 per month and does not make additional pur-
chases. If she transfers her balance to a card with a 12.5% rate and pays 
$128 per month, she can eliminate her debt in approximately 2 1
2 years. You 
can see how debt can get out of control if you continue to make purchases 
and pay only the minimum payment each month. The debt will never be 
eliminated.

compounded two or more times a year. For example, if P is invested at 12%, compounded quarterly, we multiply P by 
11 + 0.12>424, or 1.034. Since 1.034 ≈1.126, the 12% compounded quarterly corresponds to an effective yield of approxi-
mately 12.6%. In Exercises 47 and 48, find the effective yield for the indicated account.

Objective 6.3b 
Solve basic percent problems.
Example 
165 is what percent of 3300?
We have
 165 = p # 3300    Translating to a percent  
equation
 165
3300 = p # 3300
3300
 165
3300 = p
 0.05 = p
 5% = p.
Thus, 165 is 5% of 3300.

Objective 6.5b  Solve applied problems involving percent increase or percent decrease.
Example 
The total cost for 16 basic grocery items in 
the second quarter of 2008 averaged $46.67 nation-
ally. The total cost of these 16 items in the second 
quarter of 2007 averaged $42.95. What was the percent 
increase?
Source: American Farm Bureau Federation
We first determine the amount of increase:
$46.67 - $42.95 = $3.72.
Then we translate to a percent equation or a proportion 
and solve.
Rewording:  $3.72 is what percent of $42.95?

Objective 6.7a  Solve applied problems involving simple interest.
Example 
To meet its payroll, a business borrows 
$5200 at 4 1
4 % for 90 days. Find the amount of simple 
interest that is due and the total amount that must be 
paid after 90 days.
 I = P # r # t = $5200 * 4 1
4 % * 90
365
 = $5200 * 0.0425 * 90

CHAPTER  7  Data, Graphs, and Statistics
 a 	 Averages
A statistic is a number describing a set of data. One statistic is a center point, 
or measure of central tendency, that characterizes the data. The most com-
mon kind of center point is the arithmetic (pronounced aˇr´ıˇth-meˇt´-ıˇk)

Average
To find the average of a set of numbers, add the numbers and then 
divide by the number of items of data.
example 1  On a 4-day trip, a car was driven the following number of 
miles:  240, 302, 280, 320. What was the average number of miles per day?
240 + 302 + 280 + 320
4
= 1142
4 , or 285.5
The car was driven an average of 285.5 mi per day. Had the car been driven 
exactly 285.5 mi each day, the same total distance (1142 mi) would have 
been traveled.
example 2 
Gas Mileage.  The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta TDI is estimated 
to travel 546 miles on the highway on 13 gal of diesel fuel. What is the ex-
pected average number of miles per gallon (mpg)—that is, what is the fuel 
mileage for highway driving?
Source: vw.com
We divide the total number of miles, 546, by the total number of 
­gallons, 13:
546 mi
13 gal = 42 mpg.
The Jetta’s expected average is 42 mi per gallon for highway driving.

If Allison has scored 70% on quizzes, 100% on homework, and 92% on 
tests, she cannot calculate her course grade by averaging 70, 100, and 92, 
because each category is weighted differently. Instead, she must multiply 
each percentage by its weight, add the results, and divide by the total of the 
weights:
 Course grade = 70 # 20 + 100 # 30 + 92 # 50
20 + 30 + 50
 = 9000
100 = 90.
Allison’s course grade is 90%.
A grade point average is another example of a weighted average.
example 3 
Grade Point Average.  In many schools, students are as-
signed grade point values for grades obtained. The grade point average, or 
GPA, is the average of the grade point values for each credit hour taken. At 
Meg’s college, grade point values are assigned as follows:
A: 4.0  B: 3.0  C: 2.0  D: 1.0  F: 0.0.
Meg earned the following grades for one semester. What was her grade

To find the GPA, we first multiply the grade point value for each grade

quality points, and then add. Here each grade is weighted by the number of 
credit hours in the course.

CHAPTER  7  Data, Graphs, and Statistics
The total number of credit hours taken is 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 1, or 15. We di-
vide the number of quality points, 46, by the number of credit hours, 15, 
and round to the nearest tenth:
GPA = 46
15 ≈3.1.
Meg’s grade point average was 3.1.
Do Exercises 5 and 6.
example 4 
Grading.  To get a B in math, Geraldo must score an aver-
age of 80 on five tests. On the first four tests, his scores were 79, 88, 64, and 78. 
What is the lowest score that Geraldo can get on the last test and still get a B?
We can find the total of the five scores needed as follows:
80 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 = 5 # 80, or 400.
The total of the scores on the first four tests is
79 + 88 + 64 + 78 = 309.
Thus Geraldo needs to get at least
400 - 309, or 91
in order to get a B. We can check this as follows:
79 + 88 + 64 + 78 + 91
5
= 400
5 , or 80.
Do Exercise 7.
 b 	 Medians
Another type of center-point statistic is the median. Medians are useful 
when we wish to de-emphasize unusually extreme numbers. For example, 
suppose a small class scored as follows on an exam.
Jae:	
78      Pat:	
56
Jill:	
81      Carmen:  84
Matt:  82
Let’s first list the scores in order from smallest to largest:
56, 78, 81, 82, 84.
	
	
Middle score
The middle score—in this case, 81—is called the median. Note that 
­because of the extremely low score of 56, the average of the scores is 76.2. In 
this example, the median may be a more appropriate center-point statistic.

Median
Once a set of data is listed in order, from smallest to largest, the 
­median is the middle number if there is an odd number of data 
items. If there is an even number of items, the median is the number 
that is the average of the two middle numbers.
example 6  What is the median of this set of numbers?
69, 80, 61, 63, 62, 65
We first rearrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest. There 
is an even number of numbers. We look for the middle two, which are 63 
and 65. The median is halfway between 63 and 65, the number 64.
61, 62, 63, 65, 69, 80    The average of the middle numbers is 
63 + 65

We rearrange the numbers in order from smallest to largest:
$8,250,000, $8,700,000, $8,700,000, $9,500,000.
The two middle numbers are $8,700,000 and $8,700,000. Since they are 
the same number, their average is $8,700,000. Thus the median salary is 
$8,700,000.

CHAPTER  7  Data, Graphs, and Statistics
 c 	 Modes
The final type of center-point statistic we will consider is the mode.
Mode
The mode of a set of data is the number or numbers that occur most 
often. If each number occurs the same number of times, there is no 
mode.
example 8  Find the mode of these data.
17, 13, 18, 17, 14, 19
To find the mode, it is helpful to first rearrange the numbers in order 
from smallest to largest.
13, 14, 17, 17, 18, 19
The number that occurs most often is 17. Thus the mode is 17.
example 9  Find the mode of these data.
5, 5, 11, 11, 13, 13
The numbers in this set of data are 5, 11, and 13. Each occurs twice, so 
all the numbers are equally represented. There is no mode.
A set of data has just one average (mean) and just one median, but it 
can have more than one mode.
example 10  Find the modes of these data.
33,  34,  34,  34,  35,  36,  37,  37,  37,  38,  39,  40
There are two numbers that occur most often, 34 and 37. Thus the 
modes are 34 and 37.
Do Exercises 13–16.
Which statistic is best for a particular situation? If someone is bowling, 
the average from several games is a good indicator of that person’s ability. 
If someone is applying for a job, the median salary at that business is often 
most indicative of what people are earning there because although execu-
tives tend to make a lot more money, there are fewer of them. For similar 
reasons, the selling price of homes is usually reported as a median price. 
­Finally, if someone is reordering stock for a clothing store, the mode of the 
sizes sold is probably the most important statistic.
Find the modes of these data.

	31.	 Price Negotiations.  Amy offers $6400 for a used Ford Taurus advertised at $8000. The first offer from Jim, the car’s owner, 
is to “split the difference” and sell the car for 16400 + 80002 , 2, or $7200. Amy’s second offer is to split the difference 
between Jim’s offer and her first offer. Jim’s second offer is to split the difference between Amy’s second offer and his first 
offer. If this pattern continues and Amy accepts Jim’s third (and final) offer, how much will she pay for the car?

SECTION  7.2  Interpreting Data from Tables and Graphs 
Comparing the table and the graphs reveals that the exact data values 
are most easily read in a table. The fastest and slowest heart rates can be 
determined easily from the graphs. The graph below communicates addi-
tional information about the data. The size of each mammal in this graph 
indicates the heart rate, not the actual size of the animal. The unexpected 
relative sizes of the mammals in the graph emphasize the fact that many 
smaller animals have faster heart rates than larger animals.

CHAPTER  7  Data, Graphs, and Statistics
	a)	 Which country had the largest population in 2012?
	b)	 In which country or countries did the population decrease from 2008  
to 2012?
	c)	 What was the percent increase in population density in India from 2008 
to 2012?
	d)	 Find the average land area of the four largest countries in the table.
Careful examination of the table allows us to answer the questions.
	a)	 Note that the column head “Population” actually refers to two table 
­columns. We look down the Population column headed “2012” and find 
the largest number. That number is 1,343,239,923. Then we look across 
that row to find the name of the country: China.
	b)	 Comparing the Population columns headed “2008” and “2012,” we 
see that the population decreased in the fifth row (from 82,400,996 to 
81,305,856) and in the seventh row (from 127,433,494 to 127,368,088). 
Looking across these rows, we find the countries: Germany and Japan.
	c)	 We look down the column headed “Country” and find India. Then 
we look across that row to the columns headed “Population Density.” 
The population density of India in 2008 was 984 people per square 
mile. This increased to 1050 people per square mile in 2012. To find 
the ­percent increase, we find the amount of increase and divide by the 
population density in 2008.
 Amount of Increase: 1050 - 984 = 66
 Percent Increase: 66
984 ≈0.067 = 6.7%
	 	 The population density of India increased by 6.7% from 2008 to 2012.
	d)	 By looking down the column headed “Land Area,” we determine that 
the four largest countries in the table are Australia, Brazil, China, and 
the United States. We find the average land area of these countries:
 2,941,299 + 3,265,077 + 3,600,947 + 3,537,439

= 13,344,762

 b 	 Reading and Interpreting Graphs
Pictographs (or picture graphs) are another way to show information. 
­Instead of actually listing the amounts to be considered, a pictograph uses 
symbols to represent the amounts. A pictograph includes a key that tells 
what each symbol represents.

443
SECTION  7.2  Interpreting Data from Tables and Graphs 
example 2 
Roller Coasters. 
The following pictograph shows the 
number of roller coasters listed in the Roller Coaster Data Base for six 
­continents. Below the graph is a key that tells you that each 
 represents 
100 roller coasters.
Africa
Asia
Australia
Europe
North America
South America
5 100 roller coasters
Roller Coasters of the World
	a)	 Which continent has the greatest number of roller coasters?
	b)	 About how many roller coasters are there in Australia?
	c)	 How many more roller coasters are there in Europe than in North 
America?
We can determine the answers by reading the pictograph.
	a)	 The continent with the most symbols is Asia, so Asia has the greatest 
number of roller coasters.
	b)	 The pictograph shows about 1
4 symbol for Australia. Since each  
symbol represents 100 roller coasters, there are about 1
4 * 100, or 25, 
roller coasters in Australia.
	c)	 From the graph, we see that there are 8 * 100, or 800, roller coasters  
in Europe and about 7 1
2 * 100, or 750, roller coasters in North America. 
Thus there are 800 - 750, or 50, more roller coasters in Europe than 
in North America. We could also estimate this difference by noting 
that Europe has 1
2 of a symbol more than North America does, and 
1
2 * 100 = 50.
Do Exercises 6–8.
Use the pictograph in Example 2 to 
answer Margin Exercises 6–8.

smallest number of roller 
coasters?
	 7.	 About how many roller 
coasters are there in Asia?
	 8.	How many more roller coasters 
are there in South America 
than in Africa?
	
	The graph shows 1 1
2 symbols  
for South America.
	
	This represents 
 roller 
coasters.
	
	The graph shows 1
2 symbol for 
Africa.
	
	This represents 
 roller 
coasters.
	
	There are 
 more roller 
coasters in South America  
than in Africa.
Answers
6.  Australia
7.  1400 roller coasters
8.  About 100 more roller coasters
Guided Solution:
8.  150, 50, 100
When representing data with graphs, we must be sure that the areas of 
regions of the graph are proportional to the numbers that the regions rep-
resent. For example, in pictographs, each symbol is the same size, and the 
number of symbols is proportional to the actual data values. Thus the total 
area of the symbols is proportional to the data values. This area principle is 
illustrated in the following example.

Electricity Generation. 
The following graph illustrates 
the different methods used in the United States to generate electricity.  
Each yellow circle represents the amount of electricity generated, in  
terawatt-hours per year (TWh). Some methods of electricity generation are 
more efficient than others. The larger circle surrounding each yellow ­circle 
represents the amount of electricity that could have been generated if  
the method were 100% efficient.

	a)	 How much electricity is generated annually with wind?
	b)	 Which method generates the least electricity?
	c)	 Which method of electricity generation is the most efficient?
	d)	 Is generation of electricity from oil or from biomass more efficient?
We use the information in the graph to answer the questions. Note that 
the area of the larger circle that is not covered by the yellow circle repre-
sents the amount of energy lost or wasted during the generation process.
	a)	 From the yellow circle labeled “Wind,” we see that 74 TWh of ­electricity 
is generated annually with wind.
	b)	 The smallest yellow circle is labeled “Solar,” so the least electricity is 
generated by solar methods.
	c)	 The yellow circle that most nearly fills its outer circle is labeled 
“­Hydroelectric,” so hydroelectric generation is the most efficient.
	d)	 The same amount of electricity, 50 TWh, is generated using oil and 
biomass. Since the outer circle corresponding to oil is smaller than that 
corresponding to biomass, generation of electricity from oil is more 
efficient.

16 mpg?
	c)	 About how many more midsize models had gas mileages between 26 
mpg and 30 mpg than between 31 mpg and 35 mpg?
We use the histogram to answer the questions.
	a)	 The tallest rectangle in the histogram is above the range 21–25, so the 
range 21 mpg to 25 mpg included the greatest number of midsize models.
	b)	 The rectangle corresponding to 11–15 is 5 units high, so 5 midsize 
­models had gas mileages that were less than 16 mpg.
	c)	 From the histogram, we estimate that about 44 midsize models had gas 
mileages in the 26–30 range and about 21 models had gas mileages in the 
31–35 range. Thus about 44 - 21, or 23, more midsize models had gas 
mileages between 26 mpg and 30 mpg than between 31 mpg and 35 mpg.

CHAPTER  7  Data, Graphs, and Statistics
 a 	 Reading and Interpreting Bar Graphs
A bar graph is convenient for showing comparisons because you can 
tell at a glance which quantity is the largest or smallest. A scale is usually 
­included with a bar graph so that estimates of values can be made with 
some accuracy. Bar graphs may be drawn horizontally or vertically, and 
sometimes a double bar graph is used to make comparisons.
example 1 
Coffee and Tea Consumption.

tal bar graph is a double bar graph, showing per capita consumption, in 
pounds per person per year, of both coffee and tea for several countries.

	a)	 Which country has the highest per capita coffee consumption?
	b)	 What is the per capita tea consumption in Brazil?
	c)	 In which country do people consume about the same number of pounds 
of coffee and pounds of tea per year?
	d)	 In which two countries do people consume about the same amount  
of tea?
	e)	 In which countries is per capita coffee consumption greater than  
10 pounds per year?
We use the graph to answer the questions.
	a)	 The longest brown bar is for Norway. Thus Norway has the highest cof-
fee consumption per capita.
	b)	 We look to the right along the green bar associated with Brazil. Since it 
ends halfway between 4 and 5, we estimate Brazil’s per capita tea con-
sumption to be 4.5 pounds per year.
	c)	 The brown and green bars representing data for the United Kingdom 
are about the same length, so people in the United Kingdom consume 
about the same number of pounds of coffee and pounds of tea per year.

	d)	 The green bars are the same length for Australia and China; both 
­countries have a per capita consumption of 1.5 pounds of tea. Thus 
people in Australia and China, on average, consume about the same 
amount of tea per year.
	e)	 We move across the horizontal scale to 10. From there we move up, 
­noting any brown bars that are longer than 10 units. We see that per cap-

for selected age groups. Make a vertical bar graph of the data.
First, we indicate the age groups in seven equally spaced intervals on 
the horizontal scale and give the horizontal scale the title “Age category.” 
(See Figure 1 below.)
Next, we scale the vertical axis. To do so, we look over the data and note 
that it ranges from 2% to 76%. We start the vertical scaling at 0, labeling the 
marks by 10’s from 0 to 80. We give the vertical scale the title “Percent of 
population” and the graph the overall title “U.S. Population by Age.”
Finally, we draw vertical bars to show the various percents, as shown 
in Figure 2.

First, we indicate the 10-min elapsed time intervals on the horizon-
tal scale and give the horizontal scale the title “Elapsed time (in min-
utes).” See the figure on the left below. Next, we scale the vertical axis by 
10’s ­beginning with 80 to show the number of degrees and give the verti-
cal scale the title “Temperature (in degrees).” The jagged line at the base 
of the vertical scale indicates that an unused portion of the scale has been 
omitted. We also give the graph the overall title “Temperature in Enclosed 
Vehicle with Outside Temperature 80°F.”

SECTION  7.4  Interpreting and Drawing Circle Graphs
We often use circle graphs, also called pie charts, to show the percent 
of a quantity in each of several categories. Circle graphs can also be used 
very effectively to show visually the ratio of one category to another. In 
­either case, it is quite often necessary to use mathematics to find the actual 
amounts represented for each specific category.
 a 	 Reading and Interpreting Circle Graphs
example 1 
Endangered Species. 
According to the International 
Union for Conservation of Nature, seven species of whales are endangered 
or near-threatened. The following circle graph shows the approximate per-
centage of the entire population of endangered or near-threatened whales 
that each species represents.

Endangered or Near-Treatened Whales
	a)	 Which species has the greatest population?
	b)	 Which species accounts for 25% of the entire population of endangered 
or near-threatened whales?
	c)	 The total number of whales in these seven species is about 300,000. 
How many blue whales are there?
	d)	 What percent of the population of endangered or near-threatened 
whales are right whales?
We look at the sections of the graph to find the answers.
	a)	 The largest section (or sector) of the graph represents 35% of the popula-
tion and corresponds to fin whales.
	b)	 The narwhal accounts for 25% of the endangered or near-threatened 
whales.
	c)	 The section representing blue whales is 4.3% of the circle. Since 4.3% of 
300,000 is 12,900, there are approximately 12,900 blue whales.
	d)	 There are two kinds of right whales represented on the graph: North 
Pacific right whales and North Atlantic right whales. We add the per-
cents corresponding to these whales:
0.4% + 0.3% = 0.7%.

Using a circle with 100 equally spaced tick marks, we start with the 46% 
of students who are in grades K–8 in public schools. We draw a line from 
the center of the circle to any tick mark. Then we count off 46 ticks and 
draw another line. We label the wedge as shown in the figure on the left 
below. To distinguish the sectors, we can use different colors. We choose 
blue for this first sector.

to largest: 
2.6, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 10.4, 10.4, 21.6, 61.8.
The median is halfway between the middle two, which 
are 3.5 and 10.4. The average of these middle numbers 
is 6.95.

Objective 7.2a  Extract and interpret data from tables.
Example  The table below lists comparative 
­information for oatmeal sold by six companies.
a)	 Which oatmeal has the greatest number of calories?
b)	 How much sodium is in a serving of Market Pantry 
Maple & Brown Sugar?
	
An examination of the table will give the answers.
a)	 We look down the column headed “Calories” and 
find the largest number. That number is 200. Then 
we look left across that row to find the name of the 
oatmeal: Nature’s Path Organic Maple Nut.
b)	 We look down the column of products and find 
Market Pantry. Then we move right across that 
row to the column headed “Sodium” and find the 
amount of sodium: 240 mg.
Practice Exercises
Use the table in the example shown above for ­Exercises 
2 and 3.
	 2.	 Which oatmeal has the greatest cost per serving? 
What is that cost?
	 3.	 How many grams of sugar are in the Kashi 
­oatmeal?
Objective 7.3a  Extract and interpret data from bar 
graphs.
Example  The horizontal bar graph below shows the 
building costs of selected stadiums. When comparing 
the costs, note the year in which each stadium was 
built.

Stadium, 2008
Invesco Field
@ Mile High, 2001
SOURCE: National Football League
a)	 Estimate how much more Lucas Oil Stadium cost 
than Invesco Field did.
b)	 Which stadium cost approximately $250 million to 
build?
	
We look at the graph to answer the questions.
a)	 We move to the right along the bars for Lucas Oil 
Stadium and Invesco Field and move down to the 
horizontal scale to estimate the costs: about $720 
million for Lucas Oil Stadium and $360 million 
for Invesco Field. The difference in cost is about 
$720 million - $360 million, or $360 million. 
Thus Lucas Oil cost about $360 million more than 
Invesco Field.
b)	 We locate the lines representing $200 million and 
$300 million and go up until we reach a bar that 
ends close to $250 million. Then we go to the left 
and read the name of the stadium: Bank of America 
Stadium.

b)	 From the graph, we see that 26% of the population 
is 20–39 years old and only 15% is 60–79 years old. 
We subtract: 26% - 15% = 11%. Thus the percent 
of the population that is 20–39 years old is 11% 
greater than the percentage that is 60–79 years old.

CHAPTER  8  Measurement
Studying for Success      Working with Others
	
Try being a tutor for a fellow student. You may find that you understand concepts better after 
explaining them to someone else.
	
Consider forming a study group.
	
Verbalize the math. Often simply talking about a concept with a classmate can help clarify  
it for you.
Length, or distance, is one kind of measure. To find lengths, we start with 
some unit segment and assign to it a measure of 1. Suppose AB below is a 
unit segment. Let’s measure segment CD, using AB as our unit segment.
Unit segment:
   
1
A
B
C
D
1
1
1
1
Since we can place 4 unit segments end to end along CD, the measure of  
CD is 4.
Sometimes we need to use parts of units, called subunits. For example, 
the measure of the segment MN below is 11
2. We place one unit segment 
and one half-unit segment end to end.

SECTION  8.1  Linear Measures: American Units
We can visualize comparisons of the units as follows:
12
1
36
1
3
1 yard = 12 inches
=
foot =
yard
1 inch =
1 foot
= 3 feet = 36 inches
1 yard
We can also abbreviate the units inches and feet like this: 13 in. = 13″ 
and 27 ft = 27′. American units have also been called “English,” or “British–
American,” because at one time they were used by both countries. Today, 
both Canada and England have officially converted to the metric system.
To change from certain American units to others, we make substitu-
tions. Such a substitution is usually helpful when we are converting from a 
larger unit to a smaller one.
example 1  Complete:  7 1
3 yd = _________ in.
7 1
3 yd = 7 1
3 * 1 yd      ⁜We think of 7 1
3 yd as 7 1
3 * yd, or 7 1
3 * 1 yd.
= 7 1
3 * 36 in.      Substituting 36 in. for 1 yd
= 22
3 * 36 in.
= 264 in.
Do Exercises 5–7.
Sometimes it helps to use multiplying by 1 in making conversions. For 
example, 12 in. = 1 ft, so
12 in.
1 ft
= 1 and 1 ft
12 in. = 1.
If we divide 12 in. by 1 ft or 1 ft by 12 in., we get 1 because the lengths are 
the same. Let’s first convert from smaller units to larger units.
example 2 
Complete:  48 in. = _________ ft.
We want to convert from “in.” to “ft.” We multiply by 1 using a symbol 
for 1 with “in.” on the bottom and “ft” on the top to eliminate inches and to 
convert to feet:
48 in. = 48 in.

We can also look at this conversion as “canceling” units:
48 in. = 48 in.
1
*
1 ft
12 in. = 48
12 * 1 ft = 4 ft.
This method is used not only in mathematics, as here, but also in fields 
such as medicine, chemistry, and physics.
Do Exercises 8 and 9.
example 3 
Complete:  25 ft =
  yd.
Since we are converting from “ft” to “yd,” we choose a symbol for 1 
with “yd” on the top and “ft” on the bottom:
25 ft = 25 ft * 1 yd
3 ft     3 ft = 1 yd, so 3 ft
1 yd = 1 and 1 yd
3 ft = 1. 
We use 1 yd
3 ft  to eliminate ft.
= 25
3 * ft
ft * 1 yd
= 8 1
3 * 1 yd      The ft
ft acts like 1, so we can omit it.
= 8 1
3  yd, or 8.3 yd. 
Again, in this example, we can consider conversion from the point of 
view of canceling:
25 ft = 25 ft * 1 yd
3 ft = 25
3 * 1 yd =  8 1
3 yd, or 8.3 yd.
Do Exercises 10 and 11.
example 4 
Complete:  23,760 ft =  
 mi.
We choose a symbol for 1 with “mi” on the top and “ft” on the bottom:
23,760 ft = 23,760 ft *
1 mi
5280 ft      5280 ft = 1 mi, so 1 mi
5280 ft = 1.
= 23,760
5280
* ft
ft * 1 mi
= 4.5 * 1 mi              Dividing
= 4.5 mi.
Let’s also consider this example using canceling:
23,760 ft = 23,760 ft *
1 mi
5280 ft
= 23,760
5280
* 1 mi
= 4.5 * 1 mi = 4.5 mi.

CHAPTER  8  Measurement
Although the metric system is used in most countries of the world, it is 
used very little in the United States. The metric system does not use inches, 
feet, pounds, and so on, but its units for time and electricity are the same as 
those used now in the United States.
An advantage of the metric system is that it is easier to convert from 
one unit to another within this system than within the American system. 
That is because the metric system is based on the number 10.
The basic unit of length is the meter. It is just over a yard. In fact, 
1 ­meter ≈ 1.1 yd.
1 Meter
(Comparative sizes are shown.)
1 Yard
The other units of length are multiples of the length of a meter:
10 times a meter,  100 times a meter,  1000 times a meter,  and so on,
or fractions of a meter:
1
10 of a meter, 1
100 of a meter, 1
1000 of a meter, and so on.
You should memorize the names and abbreviations for metric 
units of length. Remember kilo- for 1000, hecto- for 100, deka- for 
10, deci- for 1
10, centi- for 1
100, and milli- for 1
1000. (The units dekameter 
and decimeter are not used often.) We will also use these prefixes 
when considering units of area, capacity, and mass.
Thinking Metric
To familiarize yourself with metric units, consider the following.
1 kilometer (1000 meters)	
is slightly more than 1
2 mile  
(0.6 mi).
1 meter	
is just over a yard (1.1 yd).
1 centimeter (0.01 meter)	
is a little more than the width of 
a paperclip (about 0.3937 inch).

You should try to make metric conversions mentally as much as possible.
The fact that conversions can be done so easily is an important advan-
tage of the metric system. The most commonly used metric units of length 
are km, m, cm, and mm. We have purposely used these more often than 
the others in the exercises.

example 5 
Millau Viaduct.  The Millau viaduct is part of the E11 ex-
pressway connecting Paris, France, and Barcelona, Spain. The viaduct has 
the highest bridge piers ever constructed. The tallest pier is 804 ft high and 
the overall height including the pylon is 1122 ft, making this the highest 
bridge in the world. Convert 804 feet and 1122 feet to meters.
Source: www.abelard.org/france/viaduct-de-millau.php
We let P = the height of the pier and H = the overall height of the 
bridge. To convert feet to meters, we substitute 0.305 m for 1 ft.
 P = 804 ft        H = 1122 ft
 = 804 * 1 ft       = 1122 * 1 ft
 ≈804 * 0.305 m    ≈1122 * 0.305 m

Studying for Success      Throughout the Semester
	
Review regularly. A good way to do this is by doing the Skill Maintenance exercises found in each 
exercise set.
	
Try creating your own glossary. Understanding terminology is essential for success in any math course.
	
Memorizing is a helpful tool in the study of mathematics. Ask your instructor what you are expected to 
have memorized for tests.
There is a difference between mass and weight, but the terms are often 
used interchangeably. People sometimes use the word “weight” when, 
technically, they are referring to “mass.” Weight is related to the force of 
gravity. The farther you are from the center of the earth, the less you weigh. 
Your mass stays the same no matter where you are.

The term “ounce” used here for weight is different from the “ounce” 
used for capacity, which we will discuss in Section 8.5. We convert units of 
weight using the same techniques that we use with linear measures.

1 g = 1 gram = the mass of 1 cm3 of water
The metric units of mass are listed to the left. The prefixes are the 
same as those for length.
Thinking Metric
One gram is about the mass of 1 raisin or 1 package of artificial 
sweetener. Since 1 kg is about 2.2 lb, 1000 kg is about 2200 lb, or 
1 metric ton (t), which is just a little more than 1 American ton (T), 
which is 2000 lb.
1 g 5 1 cm3
of water
1 gram
1 kilogram of grapes
1 pound of grapes
Small masses, such as dosages of medicine and vitamins, may be mea-
sured in milligrams (mg). The gram (g) is used for objects ordinarily mea-
sured in ounces, such as the mass of a letter, a piece of candy, or a coin.
1 kg
2 g
Each 2.5 mg
15 g
125 kg
The kilogram (kg) is used for larger food packages and for body masses. The 
metric ton (t) is used for very large masses, such as the mass of an automobile, a 
truckload of gravel, or an airplane.
Do Exercises 3–7.

Fluid ounces, abbreviated fl oz, are often referred to as ounces, or oz.
example 1  Complete:  9 gal =

Since we are converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit, we use 
substitution:
9 gal = 9 # 1 gal = 9 # 4 qt	
Substituting 4 qt for 1 gal
= 9 # 4 # 1 qt = 9 # 4 # 2 pt	
Substituting 2 pt for 1 qt
= 9 # 4 # 2 # 1 pt = 9 # 4 # 2 # 16 oz	
Substituting 16 oz for 1 pt
= 1152 oz.	
example 2  Complete:  24 qt =
 gal.
Since we are converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit, we multi-
ply by 1 using 1 gal in the numerator and 4 qt in the denominator:
24 qt = 24 qt # 1 gal

Medical Dosage.  A physician orders 3.5 L of 5% dextrose 
in water (abbreviated as D5W) to be administered over a 24-hr period. How 
many milliliters were ordered?
We convert 3.5 L to milliliters:

example 6  Medical Dosage.  Liquids at a pharmacy are often labeled 
in liters or milliliters. This means that if a physician’s prescription is given 
in ounces, it must be converted. For conversion, a pharmacist knows that 
1 fluid oz ≈29.57 mL.* A prescription calls for 3 fluid oz of theophylline. 
How many milliliters does the prescription call for?

Temperature Conversions 
Temperature conversions can be done 
quickly using a calculator. To convert 
37°C to Fahrenheit, for ­example, we 
press 1   .   8   *   3   7   +   3   2  
=  . The calculator ­displays 
98.6  , 
so 37°C = 98.6°F. We can convert 
212°F to Celsius by pressing 
  2   1  
2   -   3   2  
  ,   1   .   8   =  .
The display reads 
100  , so 
212°F = 100°C. Note that we 
must use parentheses when con-
verting from Fahrenheit to Celsius 
in order to get the correct result.

Mental Conversion
To convert mentally, we first note that 102 = 100, 1002 = 10,000, and  
0.12 = 0.01. We use the table as before and multiply the number of places 
we move for the simple unit conversion by 2 to determine the number of 
places to move the decimal point for conversion of squared units.

Perimeter of a Polygon
A polygon is a closed geometric figure with three or more sides. The 
perimeter of a polygon is the distance around it, or the sum of the 
lengths of its sides.
example 1  Find the perimeter of this polygon.
6 m
9 m
5 m
4 m
5 m
We add the lengths of the sides. Since all units are the same, we add the 
numbers, keeping meters (m) as the unit.
 Perimeter = 6 m + 5 m + 4 m + 5 m + 9 m
 = 16 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 92 m
 = 29 m

her rectangular dining room, which measures 14 ft by 12 ft. How many feet 
of molding will be needed? If the molding sells for $3.25 per foot, what will 
its total cost be?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  We make a drawing and let P = the perimeter.
12 ft
14 ft
	 2.	 Translate.  The perimeter of the room is given by
P = 2 # 1l + w2 = 2 # 114 ft + 12 ft2.
	 3.	 Solve.  We calculate the perimeter as follows:
P = 2 # 114 ft + 12 ft2 = 2 # 126 ft2 = 52 ft.
Then we multiply by $3.25 to find the cost of the crown molding:
Cost = $3.25 * Perimeter = $3.25 * 52 ft = $169.
	 4.	 Check.  The check is left to the student.

Mosquito Netting.  Malaria is the leading cause 
of death among children in Africa. Bed nets prevent malaria 
transmission by creating a protective barrier against mosquitoes 
at night. In November 2006, the United Nations Foundation, the 
United Methodist Church, and the National Basketball ­Association 
launched the Nothing But Nets campaign to distribute mosquito 
netting in Africa. In the next six years, nets were sent to more than  
25 countries in Africa. A medium-sized net measures ­approximately  
9.843 ft by 8.2025 ft. A large-sized net measures approximately 
13.124 ft by 8.2025 ft. Find the area of each net. How much larger is 
the area of the large net than that of the medium net?
Source: www.nothingbutnets.net
We find the area of each net using the area formula A = l # w  
and substituting values for l and w. Then we subtract the area of  
the medium net from the area of the large net.
Area of Medium Net	
Area of Large Net
A = l * w	
A = l * w
A ≈9.843 ft * 8.2025 ft	
A ≈13.124 ft * 8.2025 ft
A ≈80.74 ft2	
A ≈107.65 ft2
 Area of Large Net - Area of Medium Net = 107.65 ft2 - 80.74 ft2
 = 26.91 ft2
The area of the large net is approximately 26.91 ft2 larger than that of the 
­medium net.

Lucas Oil Stadium. 
The retractable roof of Lucas Oil 
­Stadium, the home of the Indianapolis Colts football team, divides length-
wise. Each half measures 588 ft by 160 ft. The roof opens and closes in ap-
proximately 9–11 min. The opening measures 300 ft across. What is the total 
area of the retractable roof? What is the area of the opening?
160 ft
588 ft
300 ft
Each half of the retractable roof is a rectangle that measures 588 ft by 
160 ft. The area of a rectangle is length times width, so we have
 A = l # w
 = 588 ft * 160 ft
 = 94,080 ft2.
The total area of the two halves of the retractable roof is
 Total area = 2 * 94,080 ft2
 = 188,160 ft2.
When the retractable roof is open, the dimensions of the opening are 588 ft 
by 300 ft. The area of this rectangle is
 A = l # w
 = 588 ft * 300 ft
 = 176,400 ft2.
When the roof is open, the area of the opening is 176,400 ft2.

SECTION  9.3  Circles
 b 	 Circumference
The circumference of a circle is the distance around it. Calculating the 
­circumference is similar to finding the perimeter of a polygon.
To find a formula for the circumference C of any circle given its 
­diameter d, we consider the ratio C>d. Take a dinner plate and measure the 
circumference C with a tape measure. Also measure the diameter d. The 
results for a specific plate are shown in the figure below.
d ≈ 10.75 in.
C ≈ 33.7 in.
Finding the ratio, we have
C
d = 33.7 in.
10.75 in. ≈3.1.
Suppose we do this with plates and circles of several sizes. We get dif-
ferent values for C and d, but always a number close to 3.1 for C>d. For any 
circle, if we divide the circumference C by the diameter d, we get the same 
number. We call this number p (pi). The exact value of the ratio C>d is p; 
3.14 and 22>7 are approximations of p. If C>d = p, then C = p # d.
Circumference and Diameter
The circumference C of a circle of diameter d is given by
C = P ~ d.
The number p is about 3.14, or about 22

CHAPTER  9  Geometry
Since d = 2 # r, where r is the length of a radius, it follows that
C = p # d = p # 12 # r2, or 2 # p # r.
The P  Key  Many calculators 
have a p  key that can be used to 
enter the value of p in a computa-
tion. Results obtained using the p  
key might be slightly different from 
those obtained when 3.14 is used for 
the value of p in a computation.
When we use the p  key to 
find the circumference of the circle 
in Example 3, we get a result of 
approximately 18.85. Note that this 
is slightly different from the result 
found using 3.14 for the value of p.

CHAPTER  9  Geometry
To measure angles, we start with some arbitrary angle and assign to 
it a measure of 1. We call it a unit angle. Suppose that ∠U, shown below, is 
a unit angle. Let’s measure ∠DEF. If we made 3 copies of ∠U, they would 
“fill up” ∠DEF. Thus the measure of ∠DEF would be 3.

To indicate the measure of ∠XYZ, we write m ∠XYZ = 90°. Recall that the 
symbol 
∟
 is sometimes drawn on a figure to indicate a 90° angle.
A device called a protractor is used to measure angles. Protractors 
have two scales (inside and outside). To measure an angle like ∠Q be-
low, we place the protractor’s ▲ at the vertex and line up one of the angle’s 
sides at 0°. Then we check where the angle’s other side crosses the scale. 
In the figure below, the side QR
¡  lines up with 0° on the inside scale, so we 
check where the angle’s other side, QP
¡, crosses the inside scale. We see that 
m ∠Q = 145°.

Complementary Angles
Two angles are complementary if the sum of their measures is 90°. 
Each angle is called a complement of the other.
If two angles are complementary, each is an acute angle. When com-
plementary angles are adjacent to each other, they form a right angle.

 a 	 Square Roots
Square Root
If a number is a product of two identical factors, then either factor is 
called a square root of the number. (If a = c2, then c is a square root 
of a.) The symbol 1  (called a radical sign) is used in naming square 
roots.
For example, 136 is the square root of 36. It follows that
136 = 16 # 6 = 6    The square root of 36 is 6.
because 62 = 36.
example 1  Simplify:  125.
125 = 15 # 5 = 5    The square root of 25 is 5 because 52 = 25.	
example 2  Simplify:  1144.
1144 = 112 # 12 = 12    The square root of 144 is 12 because 
122 = 144.	
Caution!
It is common to confuse squares and square roots. A number squared is 
that number multiplied by itself. For example, 162 = 16 # 16 = 256. A 
square root of a number is a number that when multiplied by itself gives 
the original number. For example, 116 = 4, because 4 # 4 = 16.

SECTION  9.6  Square Roots and the Pythagorean Theorem 
 b 	 Approximating Square Roots
Many square roots can’t be written as whole numbers or fractions. For ex-
ample, 12, 13, 139, and 170 cannot be precisely represented in decimal 
notation. To see this, consider the following decimal approximations for 
12. Each gives a closer approximation, but none is exactly 12:
12 ≈1.4	
because	
11.422 = 1.96;
12 ≈1.41	
because	
11.4122 = 1.9881;
12 ≈1.414	
because	
11.41422 = 1.999396;
12 ≈1.4142	
because	
11.414222 = 1.99996164.
Decimal approximations like these are commonly found by using a 
calculator.
example 6 
Use a calculator to approximate 13, 127, and 1180 to 
three decimal places.
We use a calculator to find each square root. Since the calculator dis-
plays more than three decimal places, we round back to three places.
13 ≈1.732,  127 ≈5.196,  1180 ≈13.416
As a check, note that 1 # 1 = 1 and 2 # 2 = 4, so we expect 13 to be be-
tween 1 and 2. Similarly, we expect 127 to be between 5 and 6 and 1180 
to be between 13 and 14.
Do Exercises 25–28.
 c 	 The Pythagorean Theorem
A right triangle is a triangle with a 90° angle, as 
shown here. In a right triangle, the longest side 
is called the hypotenuse. It is the side opposite 
the right angle. The other two sides are called 
legs. We generally use the letters a and b for the 
lengths of the legs and c for the length of the  
hypotenuse. They are related as follows.
Use a calculator to approximate to 
three decimal places.

The Pythagorean Theorem
In any right triangle, if a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the 
length of the hypotenuse, then
a2 + b2 = c2, or
1Leg22 + 1Other leg22 = 1Hypotenuse22.
The equation a2 + b2 = c2 is called the Pythagorean equation.*

*The converse of the Pythagorean theorem is also true. That is, if a2 + b2 = c2, then the 
triangle is a right triangle.
Calculator Corner
Finding Square Roots 
Many calculators have a square 
root key, 1   . Often we enter the 
radicand first and then press the 
1   key.
It is always best to wait until  
calculations are complete before 
rounding. For example, to find 
9 # 130 rounded to the nearest 
tenth, we do not first determine 
that 130 ≈5.5 and then mul-
tiply by 9 to get 49.5. Rather, we 
press 9  *  3  0  2nd  1   
=  or 9  *  3  0  SHIFT  1   
=  . The result is 49.29503018, so 
9 # 130 ≈49.3.

The Pythagorean theorem is named for the Greek mathematician 
­Pythagoras (569?–500? b.c.e.). We can think of this relationship as adding

If we know the lengths of any two sides of a right triangle, we can use 
the Pythagorean equation to determine the length of the third side.
example 7  Find the length of the hypotenuse of this  
right triangle.
We substitute in the Pythagorean equation:
a2 + b2  = c2
62 + 82  = c2     Substituting
36 + 64 = c2
100 = c2.
The solution of this equation is the square root of 100, which is 10:
c = 1100 = 10.

Height of Ladder.  A 12-ft ladder leans against a building. 
The bottom of the ladder is 7 ft from the building. How high is the top of the

	 1.	 Familiarize.  We first make a drawing. In it we see a right triangle. 
We let h = the unknown height.
12 ft
7 ft

	 2.	 Translate.  We substitute 7 for a, h for b, and 12 for c in the Pythago-
rean equation:
a2 + b2 = c2       Pythagorean equation
72 + h2 = 122.
	 3.	 Solve.  We solve for h2 and then h.
 49 + h2 = 144
49 + h2 - 49 = 144 - 49
 h2 = 144 - 49
 h2 = 95

h = 195
Approximation:  h ≈9.7 ft
	 4.	 Check. 
72 + 119522 = 49 + 95 = 144 = 122.

CHAPTER  10  Real Numbers
In this section, we introduce the real numbers. We begin with numbers 
called integers and build up to the real numbers. To describe integers, we 
start with the whole numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. For each number 1, 2, 3, 
and so on, we obtain a new number to the left of zero on the number line:
For the number 1, there will be an opposite number -1  
(negative 1).
For the number 2, there will be an opposite number -2  
(negative 2).
For the number 3, there will be an opposite number -3  
(negative 3), and so on.
The integers consist of the whole numbers and these new numbers. 
We picture them on the number line as follows.

0, neither positive nor negative
We call the integers to the left of zero negative integers. The natural num-
bers are called positive integers. Zero is neither positive nor negative. We call 
-1 and 1 opposites of each other. Similarly, -2 and 2 are opposites, -3 and 3 
are opposites, -100 and 100 are opposites, and 0 is its own opposite. Opposite 
pairs of numbers like -3 and 3 are the same distance from 0. The integers ex-
tend infinitely on the number line to the left and right of zero.

SECTION  10.1  The Real Numbers
 c 	 Notation for Rational Numbers
Each rational number can be named using fraction notation or decimal 
notation.
example 7  Find decimal notation for -5
8.
We first find decimal notation for 5
8. Since 5
8 means 5 , 8, we divide:
  0 . 6 2 5  
8 ) 5 . 0 0 0  
4   8      
2 0     
1 6     
4 0  
4 0  
0  
Thus, 5
8 = 0.625, so -5
8 = -0.625.
Decimal notation for -5
8 is -0.625. We consider -0.625 to be a termi-
nating decimal. Decimal notation for some numbers repeats.
example 8  Find decimal notation for 7
11.
Since 7
11 means 7 , 11, we divide.
  0 . 6 3 6 3 c  
1 1 ) 7 . 0 0 0 0
6 6         
4 0        
3 3        
7 0      
6 6      
4 0    
3 3    
 7    
Repeating decimal notation can be abbreviated by writing a bar over the 
repeating part; in this case, we write 0.63. Thus, 7
11 = 0.63.	
The following are other examples showing how any rational number 
can be named using fraction notation or decimal notation:
0 = 0
6,  27
100 = 0.27, -8 3
4 = -8.75, -  13
6 = -2.16.
Do Exercises 9–11.
 d 	 The Real Numbers and Order
Every rational number corresponds to a point on the number line. How-
ever, not every point on the line corresponds to a rational number. Many 
points correspond to what are called irrational numbers. Some examples 
of irrational numbers are p and 12.

CHAPTER  10  Real Numbers
Decimal notation for rational numbers either terminates or repeats. 
Decimal notation for irrational numbers neither terminates nor repeats. 
Some other examples of irrational numbers are 13, - 18, 111, and 
0.121221222122221c. Whenever we take the square root of a number that 
is not a perfect square (see Section 9.6), we will get an irrational number.

The Real-Number System
The rational numbers and the irrational numbers together correspond to 
all the points on the number line and make up the real-number system.
The real numbers consist of the rational numbers and the irrational 
numbers. The following figure shows the relationships among various 
kinds of numbers.

Real numbers are named in order on the number line, increasing as we 
move from left to right. (See Section 1.6.) For any two numbers on the line, 
the one on the left is less than the one on the right.

Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the 
­number line. We use the symbol  x  to represent the absolute value 
of a number x.
To find the absolute value of a number:
	a)	 If a number is negative, its absolute value is its opposite.
	b)	 If a number is positive or zero, its absolute value is the same as the 
number.

CHAPTER  10  Real Numbers
We now consider addition of real numbers. First, to gain an understanding, 
we add using the number line. Then we consider rules for addition.
Addition on the Number Line
To find a + b, we start at 0, move to a, and then move according to b.
a)	 If b is positive, we move from a to the right.
b)	 If b is negative, we move from a to the left.
c)	 If b is 0, we stay at a.
example 1  Add:  3 + 1-52.
We start at 0 and move to 3. Then we move 5 units left since -5 is 
negative.

Rules for Addition of Real Numbers
	 1.	 Positive numbers:  Add the same way you do arithmetic numbers. 
The answer is positive.
	 2.	 Negative numbers:  Add absolute values. The answer is negative.
	 3.	 A positive number and a negative number:
• If the numbers have the same absolute value, the answer is 0.
• If the numbers have different absolute values, subtract the 
smaller absolute value from the larger. Then:
a)	 If the positive number has the greater absolute value, the 
answer is positive.
b)	If the negative number has the greater absolute value, the 
answer is negative.
	 4.	 One number is zero:  The sum is the other number.
Rule 4 is known as the identity property of 0. It says that for any real 
number a, a + 0 = a.

CHAPTER  10  Real Numbers
The commutative and associative laws hold for real numbers. Thus we 
can change grouping and order as we please when adding. For instance, 
we can group the positive numbers together and the negative numbers to-
gether and add them separately. Then we add the two results.
example 13  Add:  15 + 1-22 + 7 + 14 + 1-52 + 1-122.
	a)	 15 + 7 + 14 = 36	
Adding the positive numbers
	b)	 -2 + 1-52 + 1-122 = -19	
Adding the negative numbers
	c)	 36 + 1-192 = 17	
Adding the results of (a) and (b)
We can also add the numbers in any other order we wish, say, from left 
to right as follows:
 15 + 1-22 + 7 + 14 + 1-52 + 1-122 =  13 + 7 + 14 + 1-52 + 1-122
 =
 20 + 14 + 1-52 + 1-122

 b 	 Opposites, or Additive Inverses
Suppose we add two numbers that are opposites, such as 6 and -6. The 
result is 0. When opposites are added, the result is always 0. Opposites are 
also called additive inverses. Every real number has an opposite, or addi-
tive inverse.

Symbolizing Opposites
The opposite, or additive inverse, of a number a can be named -a 
(read “the opposite of a,” or “the additive inverse of a”).
Note that if we take a number, say 8, and find its opposite, -8, and then 
find the opposite of the result, we will have the original number, 8, again.

SECTION  10.2  Addition of Real Numbers
example 18  Evaluate -x and -1-x2 when x = 16.
We replace x in each case with 16.
	a)	 If x = 16, then -x = -16 = -16.	
The opposite of 16 is -16.
	b)	 If x = 16, then -1-x2 = -1-162 = 16.	
The opposite of the  
opposite of 16 is 16.
example 19  Evaluate -x and -1-x2 when x = -3.
We replace x in each case with -3.
	a)	 If x = -3, then -x = -1-32 = 3.
	b)	 If x = -3, then -1-x2 = -1-1-322 = -132 = -3.
Note that in Example 19 we used an extra set of parentheses to show 
that we are substituting the negative number -3 for x. Symbolism like 
- -x is not considered meaningful.
Do Exercises 30–33.
A symbol such as -8 is usually read “negative 8.” It could be read 
“the additive inverse of 8,” because the additive inverse of 8 is negative 8. 
It could also be read “the opposite of 8,” because the opposite of 8 is -8. 
Thus a symbol like -8 can be read in more than one way. A symbol like 
-x, which has a variable, should be read “the opposite of x” or “the additive 
inverse of x” and not “negative x,” because we do not know whether x rep-
resents a positive number, a negative number, or 0.
We can use the symbolism -a to restate the definition of opposite, or 
additive inverse.
The Opposite of the Opposite
The opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself. (The 
additive inverse of the additive inverse of a number is the number 
­itself.) That is, for any number a,
-1-a2 = a.
Opposites, or Additive Inverses
For any real number a, the opposite, or additive inverse, of a, ­denoted 
-a, is such that
a + 1-a2 = 1-a2 + a = 0.
Negative Numbers 
On many 
calculators, we can enter negative 
numbers using the  + > -  key. This 
allows us to perform calculations 
with real numbers. On some 
­calculators, this key is labeled  1-2 . 
To enter -8, for example, we press 
8   + > -  . To find the sum -14 +
1-92, we press  1   4   + > -   +  
9   + > -   =  . The result is -23. 
Note that it is not necessary to use 
parentheses when entering this 
expression.

Subtraction
The difference a - b is the number c for which a = b + c.
Consider, for example, 45 - 17. Think:  What number can we add to 17 
to get 45? Since 45 = 17 + 28, we know that 45 - 17 = 28. Let’s consider 
an example whose answer is a negative number.
example 1  Subtract:  3 - 7.
Think: What number can we add to 7 to get 3? The number must be 
negative. Since 7 + 1-42 = 3, we know the number is -4: 3 - 7 = -4. 
That is, 3 - 7 = -4 because 7 + 1-42 = 3.
Do Exercises 1–3.
The definition above does not provide the most efficient way to do 
subtraction. We can develop a faster way to subtract. As a rationale for the 
faster way, let’s compare 3 + 7 and 3 - 7 on the number line.
To find 3 + 7 on the number line, we start at 0, move to 3, and then 
move 7 units to the right since 7 is positive.

Multiplication of real numbers is very much like multiplication of 
­arithmetic numbers. The only difference is that we must determine 
whether the answer is positive or negative.
Multiplication of a Positive Number  
and a Negative Number
To see how to multiply a positive number and a negative number, consider 
the pattern shown at the left.
According to this pattern, it looks as though the product of a negative 
number and a positive number is negative. That is the case, and we have 
the first part of the rule for multiplying real numbers.

The rules for division of real numbers are the same as those for 
multiplication.
To multiply or divide two real numbers (where the divisor is nonzero):
	a)	 Multiply or divide the absolute values.
	b)	 If the signs are the same, the answer is positive.
c)	 If the signs are different, the answer is negative.
Do Exercises 4–6.
Excluding Division by 0
Example 4 shows why we cannot divide -17 by 0. We can use the same 
argument to show why we cannot divide any nonzero number b by 0. Con-
sider b , 0. We look for a number that when multiplied by 0 gives b. There 
is no such number because the product of 0 and any number is 0. Thus we 
cannot divide a nonzero number b by 0.
On the other hand, if we divide 0 by 0, we look for a number c such that 
0 # c = 0. But 0 # c = 0 for any number c. Thus it appears that 0 , 0 could 
be any number we choose. Getting any answer we want when we divide 0 by 
0 would be very confusing. Thus we agree that division by 0 is not defined.

CHAPTER  10  Real Numbers
A number and its reciprocal must have the same sign, because the 
product of the two numbers must be the positive number 1.
The Sign of a Reciprocal
The reciprocal of a number has the same sign as the number itself.
It is important not to confuse opposite with reciprocal. Keep in mind 
that the opposite, or additive inverse, of a number is what we add to the 
number to get 0. A reciprocal, or multiplicative inverse, is what we multiply 
the number by to get 1. Compare the following.
Do Exercise 15.
 c 	 Division of Real Numbers
We know that we can subtract by adding an opposite. Similarly, we can di-
vide by multiplying by a reciprocal.

 d 	 Applications and Problem Solving
We can use multiplication and division of real numbers to solve applied 
problems.
example 19 
Mine Rescue.  The San Jose copper and gold mine near 
Copiapó, Chile, caved in on August 5, 2010, trapping 33 miners. Each miner 
was safely brought out in a specially designed capsule that could be low-
ered into the mine at -137 feet per minute. It took approximately 15 min 
to lower the capsule to the miners’ location. Determine how far below the 
surface of the earth the miners were trapped.
Source: Reuters News
Since the capsule moved -137 feet per minute and it took 15 min to 
reach the miners, we have the depth d given by
d = 15 # 1-1372 = -2055.
Thus the miners were trapped at -2055 ft.
example 20 
Chemical Reaction. 
During a ­chemical 
reaction, the temperature in a beaker decreased every min-
ute by the same number of degrees. The temperature was 
56°F at 10:10 a.m. By 10:42 a.m., the temperature had dropped 
to -12°F. By how many degrees did it change each minute?
We first determine by how many degrees d the temper-
ature changed altogether. We subtract -12 from 56:
d = 56 - 1-122 = 56 + 12 = 68.
The temperature changed a total of 68°. We can express this 
as -68° since the temperature dropped.
The amount of time t that passed was 42 - 10, or 32 
min. Thus the number of degrees T that the temperature 
dropped each minute is given by
T = d
t = -68
32
= -2.125.
The change was -2.125°F per minute.

SECTION  10.5  Division of Real Numbers and Order of Operations 
 e 	 Order of Operations
When several operations are to be done in a calculation or a problem in-
volving real numbers, we apply the same rules that we did in Sections 1.9, 
3.7, and 4.4. We repeat them here for review. If you did not study those sec-
tions before, you should do so before continuing.
Rules for Order of Operations
	 1.	 Do all operations within grouping symbols before operations 
outside.
	 2.	 Evaluate all exponential expressions.
	 3.	 Do all multiplications and divisions in order from left to right.
	 4.	 Do all additions and subtractions in order from left to right.
example 21  Simplify:  -34 # 56 - 17.
There are no parentheses or exponents so we start with the third step.
 -34 # 56 - 17 = -1904 - 17    Carrying out all multiplications 
and divisions in order from left to 
right
 = -1921
    Carrying out all additions and 
­subtractions in order from left 
to right
example 22  Simplify:  24 + 51 # 4 - 137 + 23 # 22.
 24 + 51 # 4 - 137 + 23 # 22
 = 24 + 51 # 4 - 137 + 462    Carrying out all operations inside 
parentheses, first multiplying 
23 by 2, following the rules for 
order of operations within the 
parentheses
 = 24 + 51 # 4 - 83
      Completing the addition inside 
parentheses
 = 16 + 51 # 4 - 83
      Evaluating exponential expressions
 = 16 + 204 - 83
     
Doing all multiplications
 = 220 - 83
      Doing all additions and subtrac-
tions in order from left to right
 = 137
A fraction bar can act as a grouping symbol.
example 23  Simplify:  -64 , 1-162 , 1-22
23 - 32
.
An equivalent expression with brackets as grouping symbols is
3-64 , 1-162 , 1-224 , 323 - 324.
This shows, in effect, that we can do the calculations in the numerator and 
then in the denominator, and divide the results:
-64 , 1-162 , 1-22
23 - 32
= 4 , 1-22

Objective 10.1e  Find the absolute value of a real number.
Example 
Find.  a)  -9.7    b)  35
a)	  The number is negative, so we make it positive.
 -9.7 = 9.7
b)  The number is positive, so the absolute value is the 
same as the number.
35 = 35
Objective 10.2a  Add real numbers without using the number line.

Example 
Add without using the number 
line:  -8 + 1-92.
We have two negative numbers. We add the 
absolute values, 8 and 9. The answer is negative.

CHAPTER  11  Algebra: Solving Equations and Problems
The study of algebra involves the use of equations to solve problems. Equa-
tions are constructed from algebraic expressions.
 a 	 Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
In arithmetic, you have worked with expressions such as
37 + 86,  7 * 8,  19 - 7,  and 
3
8.
In algebra, we can use letters for numbers and work with algebraic expres-
sions such as
x + 86,  7 * t,  19 - y,  and 
a
b.
Expressions like these should be familiar from the equation and problem 
solving that we have already done.
Sometimes a letter can stand for various numbers. In that case, we call 
the letter a variable. Let a = your age. Then a is a variable since a changes 
from year to year. Sometimes a letter can stand for just one number. In 
that case, we call the letter a constant. Let b = your birth year. Then b is a 
constant.
An algebraic expression consists of variables, constants, numerals, 
operation signs, and/or grouping symbols. When we replace a variable 
with a number, we say that we are substituting for the variable. When we 
replace all the variables in an expression with numbers and carry out the 
operations in the expression, we are evaluating the expression.
example 1  Evaluate x + y for x = 37 and y = 29.
We substitute 37 for x and 29 for y and carry out the addition:
x + y = 37 + 29 = 66.
The number 66 is called the value of the expression when x = 37 and 
y = 29.

­expression by substitution.

Area of a Rectangle. 
The area A of a rectangle of length l 
and width w is given by the formula A = lw. Find the area when l is 24.5 in.

 b 	 Equivalent Expressions and  
the Distributive Laws
In solving equations and doing other kinds of work in algebra, we manipu-
late expressions in various ways. To see how to do this, let’s consider some 
examples in which we evaluate expressions.
example 6  Evaluate 1 # x when x = 5 and when x = -8 and compare 
the results to x.
We substitute 5 for x:
1 # x = 1 # 5 = 5.
Then we substitute -8 for x:
1 # x = 1 # 1-82 = -8.
We see that 1 # x and x represent the same number. 
Do Exercises 7 and 8.
We see in Example 6 and in Margin Exercise 7 that the expressions 
1 # x and x represent the same number for any allowable replacement of x. 
In that sense, the expressions 1 # x and x are equivalent.
Complete each table by evaluating 
each expression for the given values.

Equivalent Expressions
Two expressions that have the same value for all allowable replace-
ments are called equivalent.
In the expression 3>x, the number 0 is not an allowable replacement 
because 3>0 is not defined. Even so, the expressions 6>12x2 and 3>x are 
equivalent because they represent the same number for any allowable  
(not 0) replacement of x. For example, when x = 5,
6
2x =
6
2 # 5 = 6
10 = 3
5 and 3
x = 3
5.
We see in Margin Exercise 8 that the expressions 2x and 5x are not 
equivalent.
The fact that 1 # x and x are equivalent is a law of real numbers called the 
identity property of 1. We often refer to the use of the identity property of 1 
as “multiplying by 1.” We have used multiplying by 1 many times in this text.
The Identity Property of 1 
(Multiplicative Identity)
For any real number a,
a # 1 = 1 # a = a.
We now consider two other laws of real numbers called the distribu-
tive laws. They are the basis of many procedures in both arithmetic and al-
gebra and are probably the most important laws that we use to manipulate 
algebraic expressions. The first distributive law involves two operations: 
addition and multiplication.

SECTION  11.1  Introduction to Algebra
Let’s begin by considering a multiplication problem from arithmetic:
4 5
*   7
3 5
2 8 0
3 1 5
  
  This is 7 # 5.
	
  
  This is 7 # 40.
	
  
  This is the sum 7 # 40 + 7 # 5.
To carry out the multiplication, we actually added two products. That is,
7 # 45 = 7140 + 52 = 7 # 40 + 7 # 5.
Let’s examine this further. If we wish to multiply a sum of several num-
bers by a factor, we can either add and then multiply or multiply and then add.
example 7  Evaluate 51x + y2 and 5x + 5y when x = 2 and y = 8, and 
compare the results.
We substitute 2 for x and 8 for y in each expression. Then we use the 
rules for order of operations to calculate.
	a)	 51x + y2 = 512 + 82 = 51102 = 50
	b)	  5x + 5y = 5 # 2 + 5 # 8 = 10 + 40 = 50
The results of (a) and (b) are the same. 
 Do Exercises 9–11.
The expressions 51x + y2 and 5x + 5y, in Example 7 and in Margin Ex-
ercise 9, are equivalent. They illustrate the distributive law of multiplication 
over addition. Margin Exercises 10 and 11 also illustrate this distributive law.

The Distributive Law of  
Multiplication Over Addition
For any numbers a, b, and c, 
a1b + c2 = ab + ac.
In the statement of the distributive law, we know that in the expres-
sion ab + ac, the multiplications are to be done first according to the rules 
for order of operations. So, instead of writing 14 # 52 + 14 # 72, we can 
write 4 # 5 + 4 # 7. However, in a1b + c2, we cannot omit the parenthe-
ses. If we did, we would have ab + c, which means 1ab2 + c. For example, 
314 + 22 = 18, but 3 # 4 + 2 = 14.
The second distributive law relates multiplication and subtraction. 
This law says that to multiply by a difference, we can either subtract and 
then multiply or multiply and then subtract.
The Distributive Law of  
Multiplication Over Subtraction
For any numbers a, b, and c, 
a1b - c2 = ab - ac.

CHAPTER  11  Algebra: Solving Equations and Problems
We often refer to “the distributive law” when we mean either or both of 
these laws.
Do Exercises 12–14.
What do we mean by the terms of an expression? Terms are separated 
by addition signs. If there are subtraction signs, we can find an equivalent 
expression that uses addition signs.
example 8  What are the terms of 3x - 4y + 2z?
3x - 4y + 2z = 3x + 1-4y2 + 2z    Separating parts with + signs

Do Exercises 15 and 16.
The distributive laws are the basis for a procedure in algebra called 
multiplying. In an expression such as 81a + 2b - 72, we multiply each 
term inside the parentheses by 8:
81a + 2b - 72 = 8 # a + 8 # 2b - 8 # 7 = 8a + 16b - 56.

 c 	 Factoring
Factoring is the reverse of multiplying. To factor, we can use the ­distributive 
laws in reverse:
ab + ac = a1b + c2 and ab - ac = a1b - c2.
Factor
To factor an expression is to find an equivalent expression that is a 
product.
Look at Example 9. To factor 9x - 45, we find an equivalent expression 
that is a product, 91x - 52. When all the terms of an expression have a fac-
tor in common, we can “factor it out” using the distributive laws. Note the 
following.
9x has the factors 9, -9, 3, -3, 1, -1, x, -x, 3x, -3x, 9x, -9x;
-45 has the factors 1, -1, 3, -3, 5, -5, 9, -9, 15, -15, 45, -45.
We remove the greatest common factor. In this case, that factor is 9. Thus,
 9x - 45 = 9 # x - 9 # 5
 = 91x - 52.
Remember that an expression is factored when we find an equivalent  
expression that is a product.
examples   Factor.
	12.	 5x - 10 = 5 # x - 5 # 2    Try to do this step mentally.
= 51x - 22  	
You can check by multiplying.
	13.	 9x + 27y - 9 = 9 # x + 9 # 3y - 9 # 1
= 91x + 3y - 12
examples    Factor. Try to write just the answer, if you can.
	14.	 5x - 5y = 51x - y2
	15.	 -3x + 6y - 9z = -3 # x - 31-2y2 - 313z2 = -31x - 2y + 3z2
	
	 We usually factor out a negative factor when the first term is negative. 
The way we factor can depend on the context in which we are working. 
We might also factor the expression in this example as follows:
-3x + 6y - 9z = 31-x + 2y - 3z2.

to 9x + 27y - 9, it is not the

 d 	 Collecting Like Terms
Terms such as 5x and -4x, whose variable factors are exactly the same, are 
called like terms. Similarly, numbers, such as -7 and 13, are like terms. Also, 
3y2  and 9y2  are like terms because the variables are the same and have the 
same expo­nent. Terms such as 4y and 5y2 are not like terms, and 7x and 2y 
are not like terms.
The distributive laws are used to collect like terms. This procedure 
can also be called combining like terms.

Solving Equations:  
The Addition Principle
 a 	 Using the Addition Principle
Consider the equation x = 7. We can easily see that the solution of this 
equation is 7. If we replace x with 7, we get 7 = 7 which is true. Now con-
sider the equation x + 6 = 13. The solution of this equation is also 7, but 
the fact that 7 is the solution is not as obvious. We now begin to consider 
principles that allow us to start with an equation like x + 6 = 13 and end 
up with an equation like x = 7, in which the variable is alone on one side 
and for which the solution is easier to find. The equations x + 6 = 13 and 
x = 7 are equivalent.

Solve.
	 1.	 x + 5 = 9
	 2.	 y + 15 = 24
Equivalent Equations
Equations with the same solutions are called equivalent equations.
One principle that we use to solve equations is the addition principle, 
which we have used throughout this text.
The Addition Principle
For any real numbers a, b, and c, 
a = b is equivalent to a + c = b + c.
Let’s solve x + 6 = 13 using the addition principle. We want to get x 
alone on one side. To do so, we use the addition principle, choosing to add 
-6 on both sides because 6 + 1-62 = 0:
 x + 6 = 13
 x + 6 + 1-62 = 13 + 1-62    Using the addition principle:  
adding -6 on both sides
 x + 0 = 7
    Simplifying
 x = 7.
    Identity property of 0
The solution of x + 6 = 13 is 7.
Do Margin Exercise 1.
When we use the addition principle, we sometimes say that we “add the 
same number on both sides of the equation.” This is also true for subtrac-
tion, since we can express every subtraction as an addition. That is, since
a - c = b - c  is equivalent to  a + 1-c2 = b + 1-c2,
the addition principle tells us that we can “subtract the same number on 
both sides of an equation.”

When using the multiplication principle, we sometimes say that we 
“multiply on both sides of the equation by the same number.”
example 1  Solve:  5x = 70.
To get x alone, we multiply by the multiplicative inverse, or reciprocal, 
of 5. Then we get the multiplicative identity 1 times x, or 1 # x, which sim-
plifies to x. This allows us to eliminate 5 on the left.
 5x = 70	
The reciprocal of 5 is 1

Check:
 
    5x = 70
5 # 14 ? 70

true
The solution is 14.	
The multiplication principle also tells us that we can “divide on both 
sides of the equation by the same nonzero number.” This is because divid-
ing is the same as multiplying by a reciprocal. That is,
a
c = b
c  is equivalent to 
a # 1
c = b # 1
c,  when c ≠0.
In an expression like 5x in Example 1, the number 5 is called the coef-
ficient. Example 1 could be done as follows, dividing on both sides by 5, the 
coefficient of x.
example 2  Solve:  5x = 70.
 5x = 70

Consider the equation 3x + 4 = 13. It is more complicated than those in 
the two preceding sections. In order to solve such an equation, we first 
­isolate the x-term, 3x, using the addition principle. Then we apply the 
­multiplication principle to get x by itself.
example 1  Solve:  3x + 4 = 13.
 3x + 4 = 13

 b 	 Collecting Like Terms
If there are like terms on one side of the equation, we collect them before 
using the addition principle or the multiplication principle.

 3x + 4x = -14
 7x = -14    Collecting like terms

 x = -2
The number -2 checks, so the solution is -2.
Do Exercises 7 and 8.
If there are like terms on opposite sides of the equation, we get them 
on the same side by using the addition principle. Then we collect them. In 
other words, we get all terms with a variable on one side of the equation 
and all terms without a variable on the other side.
example 6  Solve:  2x - 2 = -3x + 3.
 2x - 2 = -3x + 3

Clearing Fractions and Decimals
For the equations considered so far, we generally used the addition princi-
ple first. There are, however, some situations in which it is to our advantage 
to use the multiplication principle first. Consider, for example,
1
2
 x + 5 = 3
4.
The LCM of the denominators is 4. If we multiply by 4 on both sides, we get
 4a 1
2
 x + 5b = 4 # 3
4
 4 # 1
2
 x + 4 # 5 = 4 # 3
4
 2x + 20 = 3.
We have “cleared” the fractions. Now consider
2.3x + 8 = 15.43.
If we multiply by 100 on both sides, we get
 10012.3x + 82 = 100 # 15.43
 100 # 2.3x + 100 # 8 = 100 # 15.43
 230x + 800 = 1543,
which has no decimal points. We have “cleared” the decimals. The equa-
tions 2x + 20 = 3 and 230x + 800 = 1543 are easier to solve than the 
original equations. It is your choice whether to clear fractions or decimals, 
but doing so often eases computations.

CHAPTER  11  Algebra: Solving Equations and Problems
In what follows, we use the multiplication principle first to “clear,” or 
eliminate, fractions or decimals. For fractions, the number by which we 
multiply is the least common multiple of all the denominators.
example 8  Solve:
2
3
 x - 1
6 + 1
2
 x = 7
6 + 2x.
The denominators are 3, 6, and 2. The number 6 is the least common 
multiple of all the denominators. We multiply by 6 on both sides of the 
equation:
 6a 2
3
 x - 1
6 + 1

 xb = 6a 7
6 + 2xb
 6 # 2
3
 x - 6 # 1

 x = 6 # 7
6 + 6 # 2x     Using the distribu-
tive laws. (Caution! 
Be sure to multiply all 
terms by 6.)
 4x - 1 + 3x = 7 + 12x
    Simplifying. Note 
that the fractions are 
cleared.
 7x - 1 = 7 + 12x
    Collecting like terms
 7x - 1 - 12x = 7 + 12x - 12x    Subtracting 12x

clear the decimals first.

The greatest number of decimal places in any one number is two. Mul-
tiplying by 100, which has two zeros, will clear the decimals.
 100116.3 - 7.2y2 = 1001-8.182
    Multiplying by 100  
on both sides
 100116.32 - 10017.2y2 = 1001-8.182
    Using a distributive law
 1630 - 720y = -818
    Simplifying
 1630 - 720y - 1630 = -818 - 1630    Subtracting 1630 on 
both sides
 -720y = -2448

Do Exercise 14.
 c 	 Equations Containing Parentheses
To solve certain kinds of equations that contain parentheses, we first 
use the distributive laws to remove the parentheses. Then we proceed as 
before.
example 10  Solve:  8x = 2112 - 2x2.
 8x = 2112 - 2x2
 8x = 24 - 4x
    Using the distributive law to multiply 
and remove parentheses
 8x + 4x = 24 - 4x + 4x    Adding 4x to get all x-terms on one side
 12x = 24
    Collecting like terms
 12x
12 = 24

    Dividing by 12
 x = 2
Check:	
8x = 2112 - 2x2

example 1  Translate to an algebraic expression:
Twice (or two times) some number.
Think of some number—say, 8. We can write 2 times 8 as 2 * 8, or 
2 # 8. We multiplied by 2. To translate to an algebraic expression, we do the 
same thing using a variable. We can use any variable we wish, such as x, y, 
m, or n. Let’s use y to stand for some number. If we multiply y by 2, we get
2 * y,  2 # y,  or  2y.
In algebra, 2y is the expression used most often.
example 2  Translate to an algebraic expression:
Seven less than some number.
We let x = the number. If the number were 10, then 7 less than 10 
would be 10 - 7, or 3. If we knew the number to be 34, then 7 less than the 
number would be 34 - 7. Thus if the number is x, then the translation is 
x - 7.
example 3  Translate to an algebraic expression:
Eighteen more than a number.
We let t = the number. Now if the number were 26, the translation 
would be 18 + 26, or 26 + 18. If we knew the number to be 174, then the 
translation would be 18 + 174, or 174 + 18. The translation we want is
Eighteen  more than  a number
18 + t, or t + 18.
Caution!
Note that 7 - x is not a correct 
translation of the expression 
in Example 2. The expression 
7 - x is a translation of “seven 
minus some number.”

example 6 
Cycling in Vietnam. 
National Highway 1, which runs 
along the coast of Vietnam, is considered one of the top routes for avid bi-
cyclists. While on sabbatical, a history professor spent six weeks biking 
1720 km on National Highway 1 from Hanoi through Ha Tinh to Ho Chi 
Minh City. At Ha Tinh, he was four times as far from Ho Chi Minh City as 
he was from Hanoi. How far had he biked, and how far did he still need to 
bike in order to reach Ho Chi Minh City?
Sources: www.smh.com; Lonely Planet’s Best in 2010
	 1.	 Familiarize.  Let’s look at a map, shown at right. To become familiar 
with the problem, let’s guess a possible distance that the professor 
is from Hanoi—say, 400 km. Four times 400 km is 1600 km. Since 
400 km + 1600 km = 2000 km and 2000 km is greater than 1720 km, 
we see that our guess is too large. Rather than guess again, let’s use the 
equation-solving tools that we learned in this ­chapter. We let
 d = the distance, in kilometers, from Ha Tinh to Hanoi, and
 4d = the distance, in kilometers, from Ha Tinh to Ho Chi Minh City.
	
	 (We also could let d = the distance from Ha Tinh to Ho Chi Minh City 
and 1
4 d = the distance from Ha Tinh to Hanoi.)
	 2.	 Translate.  From the map, we see that the lengths of the two parts of 
the trip must add up to 1720 km. This leads to our translation.

To familiarize yourself with a problem:
 • If a problem is given in words, read it carefully. Reread the prob-
lem, perhaps aloud. Try to verbalize the problem as though you 
were ­explaining it to someone else.
 • Choose a variable (or variables) to represent the unknown and 
clearly state what the variable represents. Be descriptive! For 
­example, let L = the length in feet, d = the distance in miles, 
and so on.
 • Make a drawing and label it with known information, using 
­specific units if given. Also, indicate unknown information.
 • Find further information. Look up formulas or definitions with 
which you are not familiar.  (Geometric formulas appear on the 
inside back cover of this text.) Consult a reference librarian or the 
Internet.
 • Create a table that lists all the information you have available. 
Look for patterns that may help in the translation to an equation.
 • Guess what the answer might be and check the guess. Note what  
you do in checking your guess.

4d = 1376 km. Since 344 km + 1376 km = 1720 km, the answer 
checks.

Knitted Scarf. 
Lilly knitted a scarf with orange and red 
yarn, starting with an orange section, then a medium-red section, and fi-

the orange section. The dark-red section is one-fourth the length of the or-
ange section. The scarf is 7 ft long. Find the length of each section of the 
scarf.
	 1.	 Familiarize.  Because the lengths of the medium-red section and the 
dark-red	 section are expressed in terms of the length of the orange 
section, we let

example 8 
Delivery Truck Rental. 
An appliance business needs to 
rent a delivery truck for 6 days while one of its trucks is being repaired. The 
cost of renting a 16-ft truck is $29.95 per day plus $0.29 per mile. If $550 is 
budgeted for the rental, how many miles can the truck be driven without 
exceeding the budget?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  Suppose the truck is driven 1100 mi. Then since the cost 
is given by the daily charge plus the mileage charge, we have

1100,
	
	 which is $498.70. We see that the truck can be driven more than   
1100 mi without exceeding the budget of $550. This process of  
guessing familiarizes us with the way the calculation is done.
We let m = the number of miles that can be driven on the  
budgeted amount of $550.

cost of driving 1277 mi is 12771$0.292 = $370.33. The rental 
charge for 6 days is 61$29.952 = $179.70. The total cost is then

SECTION  11.5  Applications and Problem Solving
	 3.	 Solve.  We solve the equation:
 21w + 502 + 2w = 340.
 2 # w + 2 # 50 + 2w = 340
    Using the distributive law
 4w + 100 = 340
    Collecting like terms
 4w + 100 - 100 = 340 - 100    Subtracting 100
 4w = 240
 4w

= 240

    Dividing by 4
 w = 60.
	
	 Thus possible dimensions are
w = 60 yd and l = w + 50 = 60 + 50, or 110 yd.
	 4.	 Check.  If the width is 60 yd and the length is 110 yd, then the perim-
eter is 2160 yd2 + 21110 yd2, or 340 yd. This checks.

Fastest Roller Coasters. 
The average top speed of the 
three fastest steel roller coasters in the United States is 116 mph. The third-
fastest roller coaster, Superman: The Escape (located at Six Flags Magic 
Mountain, Valencia, California), reaches a top speed that is 28 mph less 
than that of the fastest roller coaster, Kingda Ka (located at Six Flags Great 
Adventure, Jackson, New Jersey). The second-fastest roller coaster, Top 
Thrill Dragster (located at Cedar Point, Sandusky, Ohio), has a top speed of 
120 mph. What is the top speed of the fastest steel roller coaster?
Source: Coaster Grotto
	 1.	 Familiarize.  The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the num-
bers divided by the number of addends.
We are given that the second-fastest speed is 120 mph. Suppose 
the three top speeds are 109, 120, and 125. The average is then
109 + 120 + 125

= 118,
	
	 which is too high. Instead of continuing to guess, let’s use our 
equation-solving skills. We let x = the top speed of the fastest roller 
coaster. Then x - 28 = the top speed of the third-fastest roller 
coaster.

Simple Interest.  An investment is made at 3% simple in-
terest for 1 year. It grows to $746.75. How much was originally invested (the 
principal)?
	 1.	 Familiarize.  Suppose that $100 was invested. Recalling the formula 
for simple interest, I = Prt, we know that the interest for 1 year on $100 
at 3% simple interest is given by I = $100 # 0.03 # 1 = $3. Then, at the 
end of the year, the amount in the account is found by adding the  
principal and the interest:
Principal 
+  Interest 
=  Amount
	
	
	
	 $100	
+	
$3	
=	
$103.
	
	 In this problem, we are working backward. We are trying to find the 
principal, which is the original investment. We let x = the principal. 
Then the interest earned is 3%x.
	 2.	 Translate.  We reword the problem and then translate:
Principal 
+  Interest 
=  Amount
	
	
	
	
x	
+	
3%x	
=	
746.75.	
Interest is 3% of the  
principal.
	 3.	 Solve.  We solve the equation:
 x + 3%x = 746.75
 x + 0.03x = 746.75
 1x + 0.03x = 746.75    Converting to decimal notation
 11 + 0.032x = 746.75    Identity property of 1
 1.03x = 746.75    Collecting like terms
 1.03x
1.03 = 746.75
1.03     Dividing by 1.03
 x = 725.
	 4.	 Check.  We check by taking 3% of $725 and then adding it to $725:
3% * $725 = 0.03 * 725 = $21.75.
	
	 Then $725 + $21.75 = $746.75, so $725 checks.

Summary and Review: Chapter 11
Objective 11.1c  Use the distributive laws to factor expressions like 4x - 12 + 24y.
Example 
Factor:  12x - 6y + 9.
 12x - 6y + 9 = 3 # 4x - 3 # 2y + 3 # 3
 = 314x - 2y + 32
Practice Exercise
	 3.	 Factor:  24a - 8b + 16.
Objective 11.1d  Collect like terms.
Example  Collect like terms:  4a - 2b - 2a + b.
 4a - 2b - 2a + b = 4a - 2a - 2b + b
 = 4a - 2a - 2b + 1 # b
 = 14 - 22a + 1-2 + 12b
 = 2a - b
Practice Exercise
	 4.	 Collect like terms:  7x + 3y - x - 6y.
Objective 11.2a  Solve equations using the addition principle.
Example 
Solve:  x + 6 = 8.
 x + 6 = 8
 x + 6 - 6 = 8 - 6
 x + 0 = 2

Objective 11.4b  Solve equations in which like terms may need to be collected.
Example  Solve:  2y - 1 = -3y - 8 + 2.
 2y - 1 = -3y - 8 + 2
 2y - 1 = -3y - 6
 2y - 1 + 1 = -3y - 6 + 1
 2y = -3y - 5
 2y + 3y = -3y - 5 + 3y
 5y = -5
 5y
5 = -5

 y = -1
The solution is -1.
Practice Exercise
	 8.	 Solve:  6x - 4 - x = 2x - 10.
Objective 11.4c  Solve equations by first removing parentheses and collecting like terms.
Example  Solve:  8b - 213b + 12 = 10.
 8b - 213b + 12 = 10
 8b - 6b - 2 = 10
 2b - 2 = 10
 2b - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2
 2b = 12
 2b
2 = 12

 b = 6
The solution is 6.
Practice Exercise
	 9.	 Solve:  21y - 12 = 51y - 42.
Objective 11.5a  Translate phrases to algebraic expressions.
Example 
Translate to an algebraic expression:  Three 
less than some number.
We let n = the number. Now if the number were 
5, then the translation would be 5 - 3. Similarly, if the 
number were 35, then the translation would be 35 - 3. 
Thus we see from these numerical examples that if the 
number were n, the translation would be
n - 3.

This cumulative review also serves as a review for a final examination covering the entire book. A question that may occur at 
this point is what notation to use for a particular problem or exercise. Although there is no particular rule, especially as you 
use mathematics outside the classroom, here is the guideline that we follow: Use the notation given in the problem. That is, if 
the problem is given using mixed numerals, give the answer in mixed numerals. If the problem is given in decimal notation, 
give the answer in decimal notation.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  No; if subtraction were associative, then a - 1b - c2 =
1a - b2 - c for any a, b, and c. But, for example,
12 - 18 - 42 = 12 - 4 = 8,
whereas
112 - 82 - 4 = 4 - 4 = 0.
Since 8 ≠0, this example shows that subtraction is not associative.
2.  By rounding prices and estimating their sum, a shopper can 
estimate the total grocery bill while shopping. This is particularly 
useful if the shopper wants to spend no more than a certain amount.
36.  112 R 5      37.  23 R 19      38.  144 R 31      39.  25 m
40.  8 sq in.      41.  When numbers are being added, it does 
not matter how they are grouped.      42.  Subtraction is not 
commutative. For example, 5 - 2 = 3, but 2 - 5 ≠3.
43.  Answers will vary. Suppose one coat costs $150. Then the 
multiplication 4 #  $150 gives the cost of four coats. Or, suppose 
one ream of copy paper costs $4. Then the multiplication $4 # 150 
gives the cost of 150 reams.      44.  If we use the definition of 
division, 0 , 0 = a such that a # 0 = 0. We see that a could be any 
number since a # 0 = 0 for any number a. Thus we cannot say  
that 0 , 0 = 0. This is why we agree not to allow division by 0.

10,000 mi2      41.  Find the product of two prime 
numbers.      42.  If we use the divisibility tests, it is quickly clear that 
none of the even-numbered years is a prime number. In addition, 
the divisibility tests for 5 and 3 show that 2001, 2005, 2007, 2013, 
3.  Answers will vary. Anthony is driving from Kansas City to 
Minneapolis, a distance of 512 mi. He stops for gas after driving  
183 mi. How much farther must he drive?      4.  The parentheses 
are not necessary in the expression 9 - 14 # 22. Using the 
rules for order of operations, the multiplication would be 
performed before the subtraction even if the parentheses were 
not present. The parentheses are necessary in the expression 
13 # 422; 13 # 422 = 122 = 144, but 3 # 42 = 3 # 16 = 48.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  The student is probably multiplying the divisor by the reciprocal 
of the dividend rather than multiplying the dividend by the 
reciprocal of the divisor.     
2.  9432 = 9 # 1000 + 4 # 100 + 3 # 10 + 2 # 1 =  
91999 + 12 + 4199 + 12 + 319 + 12 + 2 # 1 =  
9 # 999 + 9 # 1 + 4 # 99 + 4 # 1 + 3 # 9 + 3 # 1 + 2 # 1. Since 
999, 99, and 9 are each a multiple of 9, 9 # 999, 4 # 99, and 3 # 9 
are multiples of 9. This leaves 9 # 1 + 4 # 1 + 3 # 1 + 2 # 1, or 
9 + 4 + 3 + 2. If 9 + 4 + 3 + 2, the sum of the digits, is divisible 
by 9, then 9432 is divisible by 9.      3.  Taking 1
2 of a number 
is equivalent to multiplying the number by 1
2. Dividing by 1
2 is 
equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of 1
2, or 2. Thus taking 1
2 
of a number is not the same as dividing by 1
2.       4.  We first consider 
an object, and take 4
7 of it. We divide the object into 7 parts and take 
4 of them, as shown by the shading below.
7
4

7
Next, we take 2
3 of the shaded area above. We divide it into 3 parts 
and take two of them, as shown below.
2
3
4
7
2
3
The entire object has been divided into 21 parts, 8 of which have 
been shaded twice. Thus, 2
3 # 4
7 =
8
21.      5.  Since 1
7 is a smaller 
number than 2
3, there are more 1
7’s in 5 than 2
3’s. Thus, 5 , 1
7 is a 
greater number than 5 , 2
3.      6.  No; in order to simplify a fraction, 
we must be able to remove a factor of the type n
n, n ≠0, where n is a 
factor that the numerator and the denominator have in common.

2015, and 2019 are not prime numbers. Then the years 2003, 2009, 
2011, and 2017 can be divided by prime numbers to determine 
whether they are prime. When we do this, we find that 2003, 2011, 
and 2017 are prime numbers. If the divisibility tests are not used, 
each of the numbers from 2000 to 2020 can be divided by prime 
numbers to determine if it is prime.      43.  It is possible to cancel 
only when identical factors appear in the numerator and the 
denominator of a fraction. Situations in which it is not possible to 
cancel include the occurrence of identical addends or digits in the 
numerator and the denominator.      44.  No; since the only factors 
of a prime number are the number itself and 1, two different prime 
numbers cannot contain a common factor (other than 1).

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  No; if the sum of the fractional parts of the mixed numerals is 
n>n, then the sum of the mixed numerals is an integer. For example, 
1 1
5 + 6 4
5 = 7 5
5 = 8.      2.  A wheel makes 33 1
3 revolutions per 
minute. It rotates for 4 1
2 min. How many revolutions does it make? 
Answers may vary.      3.  The student is multiplying the whole 
numbers to get the whole-number portion of the answer and 
multiplying fractions to get the fraction part of the answer. The 
student should have converted each mixed numeral to fraction 
notation, multiplied, simplified, and then converted back to a mixed 
numeral. The correct answer is 4 6
7.      4.  It might be necessary to 
find the least common denominator before adding or subtracting. 
The least common denominator is the least common multiple of 
the denominators.      5.  Suppose that a room has dimensions 
15 3
4 ft by 28 5
8 ft. The equation 2 # 15 3
4 + 2 # 28 5
8 = 88 3
4 gives the 
perimeter of the room, in feet. Answers may vary.      6.  Note that 
5 # 3 2
7 = 513 + 2
72 = 5 # 3 + 5 # 2
7. The products 5 # 3 and 5 # 2
7 should 
be added rather than multiplied together. The student could also 
have converted 3 2
7 to fraction notation, multiplied, simplified, and 
converted back to a mixed numeral. The correct answer is 16 3
7.

45.  For 0.247 , 0.1 = 0.0247, the divisor, 0.1, is smaller than the 
dividend, 0.247.  Thus the answer will be larger than 0.247. The 
correct answer is 2.47. For 0.247 , 10 = 2.47, the divisor, 10, is 
larger than the dividend, 0.247. Thus the answer will be smaller than 
0.247. The correct answer is 0.0247.

must be twice the width.      41.  The student’s approach will work. 
However, when we use the approach of equating cross products, we 
eliminate the need to find the least common denominator. 
42.  The instructor thinks that the longer a student studies, the 
higher his or her grade will be. An example is the situation in which 
one student gets a test grade of 96 after studying for 8 hr while 
another student gets a score of 78 after studying for 6 1

3.  When the denominator of a fraction is a multiple of 10, long 
division is not the fastest way to convert the fraction to decimal 
notation. Many times when the denominator is a factor of some 
multiple of 10, this is also the case. The latter situation occurs when 
the denominator has only 2’s or 5’s, or both, as factors.     
4.  Multiply by 1 to get a denominator that is a power of 10:
44
125 = 44
125 # 8
8 = 352

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  In terms of cost, a low faculty-to-student ratio is less expensive 
than a high faculty-to-student ratio. In terms of quality of education 
and student satisfaction, a high faculty-to-student ratio is more 
desirable. A college president must balance the cost and quality 
issues.      2.  Yes; unit prices can be used to solve proportions 
involving money. In Example 3 of Section 5.4, for instance, we could 
have divided $90 by the unit price, or the price per ticket, to find the 
number of tickets that could be purchased for $90.      3.  Leslie used 
4 gal of gasoline to drive 92 mi. At the same rate, how many gallons 
would be needed to travel 368 mi?      4.  Yes; consider the following 
pair of triangles.

x
y

Two pairs of sides are proportional, but we can see that x is shorter 
than y, so the ratio of x to y is clearly not the same as the ratio of 1 to 1 
(or 2 to 2).

36.  Some will say that the conversion will be done most accurately 
by first finding decimal notation. Others will say that it is more 
efficient to become familiar with some or all of the fraction and 
percent equivalents that appear inside the back cover and to make 
the conversion by going directly from fraction notation to percent 
notation.      37.  Since 40% , 10 = 4%, we can divide 36.8 by 10, 
obtaining 3.68. Since 400% = 40% * 10, we can multiply 36.8 by 
10, obtaining 368.      38.  Answers may vary. Some will say this is 
a good idea since it makes the computations in the solution easier. 
Others will say it is a poor idea since it adds an extra step to the 
solution.      39.  They all represent the same number.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  A 40% discount is better. When successive discounts are taken, 
each is based on the previous discounted price rather than on the 
original price. A 20% discount followed by a 22% discount is the 
same as a 37.6% discount off the original price.      2.  Let S = the 
original salary. After both raises have been given, the two situations 
yield the same salary: 1.05 # 1.1S = 1.1 # 1.05S. However, the first 
situation is better for the wage earner, because 1.1S is earned the 
first year when a 10% raise is given while in the second situation 
1.05S is earned that year.      3.  No; the 10% discount was based on 
the original price rather than on the sale price.      4.  For a number n,  
40% of 50% of n is 0.4(0.5n), or 0.2n, or 20% of n. Thus, taking 40% of 
50% of a number is the same as taking 20% of the number.     
5.  The interest due on the 30-day loan will be $41.10 while that due 
on 60-day loan will be $131.51. This could be an argument in favor 
of the 30-day loan. On the other hand, the 60-day loan puts twice as 
much cash at the firm’s disposal for twice as long as the 30-day loan 
does. This could be an argument in favor of the 60-day loan.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  The equation could represent a person’s average income during 
a 4-yr period. Answers may vary.      2.  Bar graphs that show 
change over time can be converted to line graphs. Other bar graphs 
cannot be converted to line graphs.      3.  One advantage is that 
we can use circle graphs to visualize how the numbers of items in 
various categories compare in size.      4.  A bar graph is convenient 
for showing comparisons. A line graph is convenient for showing 
a change over time as well as to indicate patterns or trends. The 
of 20 mph, the trip would take 1 1
2 hr 130 mi , 20 mph = 1 1
2 hr2. 
But the driver could have driven at a speed of 75 mph for a brief 
period during that time and at lower speeds for the remainder of 
the trip and still have an average speed of 20 mph.      24.  Answers 
may vary. Some would ask for the average salary since it is a center 
point that places equal emphasis on all the salaries in the firm. 
Some would ask for the median salary since it is a center point that 
deemphasizes the extremely high and extremely low salaries. Some 
would ask for the mode of the salaries since it might indicate the 
salary the applicant is most likely to earn.

choice of which to use to graph a particular set of data would 
probably depend on the type of data analysis desired.      5.  The 
average, the median, and the mode are “center points” that 
characterize a set of data. You might use the average to find a center 
point that is midway between the extreme values of the data. The 
median is a center point that is in the middle of all the data. That is, 
there are as many values less than the median as there are values 
greater than the median. The mode is a center point that represents 
the value or values that occur most frequently.      6.  Circle graphs 
are similar to bar graphs in that both allow us to tell at a glance how 
items in various categories compare in size. They differ in that circle 
graphs show percents whereas bar graphs show actual numbers of 
items in a given category.

have multiplied by 1
12 (or divided by 12) to convert inches to feet. 
The correct procedure is as follows:
 23 in. = 23 in. *
1 ft
12 in. = 23 in.
12 in. * 1 ft
 = 23
12 * in.
in. * 1 ft = 23
12 * 1 ft = 23
12 ft.
42.  Metric units are based on tens, so computations and 
conversions with metric units can be done by moving a 
decimal point. American units, which are not based on tens, 
require more complicated arithmetic in computations and 
conversions.      43.  A larger unit can be expressed as an 
equivalent number of smaller units. Thus when converting  
from a larger unit to a smaller unit, we can express the quantity  
as a number times one of the larger unit and then substitute  
the equivalent number of smaller units for the larger unit.  
When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit, we  
multiply by 1 using one larger unit in the numerator and the 
equivalent number of smaller units in the denominator. This 
allows us to “cancel” the smaller units, leaving the larger 
units.      44.  Answers may vary.

might be expressed using fractional or decimal parts of ounces can 
often be expressed by whole numbers when grams are used.       
2.  A single container is all that is required for both types of measure.   
3.  Consider the table on p. 487 in the text. Moving one place in 
the table corresponds to moving the decimal point one place. To 
convert units of length, we determine the corresponding number of 
moves in the table and then move the decimal point that number 
of places. Since area involves square units, to convert units of 
length, we multiply the number of moves in the table on p. 487 by 
2 and move the decimal point that number of places.      4.  Since 
metric units are based on 10, they are more easily converted than 
American units.      5.  (a) 23°C = 73.4°F, so you would want 
to play golf. (b) 10°C = 50°F, so you would not want to take a 
bath. (c) Since 0°C = 32°F, the freezing point of water, the lake 
would certainly be frozen at the lower temperature of -10°C, 
and it would be safe to go ice skating.      6.  1 m ≈3.281 ft, so 
1 square meter ≈3.281 ft * 3.281 ft = 10.764961 square feet. 
1 yd = 3 ft, so 1 square yard = 3 ft * 3 ft = 9 square feet. Thus one 
square meter is larger than 1 square yard.

4 ft and height 8 ft: 16 ft2; Perimeter of a square with side 4 ft: 16 ft; 
Perimeter of a rectangle with length 8 ft and width 4 ft: 24 ft       
17.  The area of a 16-in.-diameter pizza is approximately 
3.14 # 8 in. # 8 in., or 200.96 in2. At $16.25, its unit price is $16.25
200.96 in2,  
or about $0.08>in2. The area of 10-in.-diameter pizza is approximately 
3.14 # 5 in. # 5 in., or 78.5 in2. At $7.85, its unit price is $7.85
78.5 in2, or 
$0.10>in2. Since the 16-in.-diameter pizza has the lower unit price, 
it is a better buy.      18.  No; let l and w represent the length and 
the width of the smaller rectangle. Then 3 # l and 3 # w represent 
the length and the width of the larger rectangle. The area of the first 
rectangle is l # w, but the area of the second is 3 # l # 3 # w =  
3 # 3 # l # w = 9 # l # w, or 9 times the area of the smaller rectangle.    
19.  Yes; let s represent the length of a side of the larger square. 
Then 1
2 s represents the length of a side of the smaller square. The 
perimeter of the larger square is 4 # s, and the perimeter of the 
smaller square is 4 # 1
2 s = 2s, or 1
2 the perimeter of the larger square.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  Add 90° to the measure of the angle’s complement.      2.  This 
could be done using the technique in Example 7 of Section 9.4. We 
could also approximate the volume with the volume of a rectangular 
solid of similar size. Another method is to break the egg and 
measure the capacity of its contents.      3.  Show that the sum of the 
squares of the lengths of the legs is the same as the square of the 
length of the hypotenuse.      4.  Divide the figure into 3 triangles.
The sum of the measures of the angles of each triangle is 180°, so 
the sum of the measures of the angles of the figure is 3 # 180°, or 
540°.      5.  The volume of the cone is half the volume of the dome. 
It can be argued that a cone-cap is more energy-efficient since there 
is less air under it to be heated and cooled.      6.  Volume of two 
spheres, each with radius r: 214
3pr32 = 8
3pr3; volume of one sphere 
with radius 2r: 4
3p12r23 = 32
3 pr3. The volume of the sphere with 
radius 2r is four times the volume of the two spheres, each with 
radius r: 32
3 pr3 = 4 # 8
3pr3.

20.	 For a rectangle with length l 
and width w,
	
	  P = l + w + l + w
	
	
 = 1l + w2+1l + w2
	
	
 = 2 # 1l + w2.
	
	 We also have
	
	  P = l + w + l + w
	
	
 = 1l + l2+1w + w2
	
	
 = 2 # l + 2 # w.
     
21.  See p. 539 of the text.     
22.  No; let r = radius of the 
smaller circle. Then its area is 
p # r # r, or pr2. The radius of 
the larger circle is 2r, and its area 
is p # 2r # 2r, or 4pr2, or 4 # pr2. 
Thus the area of the larger circle 
is 4 times the area of the smaller 
circle.

49.  Answers may vary. Three examples are 6
13, -23.8, and 43
5 . These
are rational numbers because they can be named in the form a
b, 
where a and b are integers and b is not 0. They are not integers, 
however, because they are not whole numbers or the opposites 
of whole numbers.      50.  Answers may vary. Three examples 
are p, - 17, and 0.31311311131111. . . . Rational numbers can be 
named as described in Exercise 49 above. Real numbers that are 
not rational are irrational. Decimal notation for rational numbers 
either terminates or repeats. Decimal notation for irrational 
numbers neither terminates nor repeats.       51.  Answers may 
vary. If we think of the addition on the number line, we start at 
a negative number and move to the left. This always brings us to 
a point on the negative portion of the number line.      52.  Yes; 
consider m - 1-n2, where both m and n are positive. Then, 
m - 1-n2 = m + n. Now m + n, the sum of two positive 
numbers, is positive.

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  We know that the product of an even number of negative 
numbers is positive, and the product of an odd number of negative 
numbers is negative. Since 1-728 is equivalent to the product of 
eight negative numbers, it will be a positive number. Similarly, since 
1-7211 is equivalent to the product of eleven negative numbers, 
it will be a negative number.      2.  Yes; the numbers 1 and -1 
are their own reciprocals: 1 # 1 = 1 and -11-12 = 1.      3.  Jake 
is expecting the multiplication to be performed before the 
division.      4.  Answers will vary. At 4 p.m., the temperature in Circle 
City was 23°F. By 11 p.m., the temperature had dropped 32°F. What 
was the temperature at 11 p.m.?

Understanding Through Discussion and Writing
1.  The distributive laws are used to multiply, factor, and collect like 
terms in this chapter.      2.  For an equation x + a = b, we add the 
opposite of a on both sides of the equation to get x alone.     
3.  For an equation ax = b, we multiply by the reciprocal of a on 
both sides of the equation to get x alone.      4.  We add  -b  
(or subtract b) on both sides and simplify. Then we multiply by the 
reciprocal of  a (or divide by a) on both sides and simplify.

let  a = 2 and b = 3. Then 1a + b22 = 12 + 322 = 52 = 25, but 
a2 + b2 = 22 + 32 = 4 + 9 = 13.      51.  We use the distributive 
law when we collect like terms even though we might not always 
write this step.      52.  The student probably added  1
3 on both 
sides of the equation rather than adding  -  1
3 on (or subtracting  1
3 
from) both sides. The correct solution is -2.      53.  The student 
apparently multiplied by  - 2

on both sides. The correct solution is - 5
