PREFACE
This is a concise multi-subject handbook, which consists of three major parts: mathe-
matics, physics, and applied and engineering sciences. It presents basic notions, formulas,
equations, problems, theorems, methods, and laws on each of the subjects in brief form. The
absence of proofs and a concise presentation has permitted combining a substantial amount
of reference material in a single volume. The handbook is intended for a wide audience of
engineers and researchers (not specialized in mathematics or theoretical physics) as well as
graduate and postgraduate students.
• The ﬁrst part of the book contains chapters on arithmetics, elementary and analytic
geometry, algebra, differential and integral calculus, functions of complex variable, integral
transforms, ordinary and partial differential equations, special functions, probability theory,
etc.
• The second part of the book contains chapters on molecular physics and thermo-
dynamics, electricity and magnetism, oscillations and waves, optics, special relativity,
quantum mechanics, atomic physics, etc.
• The third part of the book contains chapters on dimensional analysis and similarity,
mechanics of point masses and rigid bodies, strength of materials, hydrodynamics, mass and
heat transfer, electrical engineering, and methods for constructing empirical and engineering
formulas.
A compact and clear presentation of the material allows the reader to get quick help on
(or revise) the desired topic. Special attention is paid to issues that many engineers and
students may ﬁnd difﬁcult to understand.
When selecting the material, the authors have given a pronounced preference to practical
aspects; namely, to formulas, problems, methods, and laws that most frequently occur in sci-
ences and engineering applications and university education. Many results are represented
in tabular form.
For the convenience of a wider audience with different mathematical backgrounds,
the authors tried to avoid special terminology whenever possible. Therefore, some of the
topics and methods are outlined in a schematic and somewhat simpliﬁed manner, which is
sufﬁcient for them to be used successfully in most cases. Many sections were written so that
they could be read independently. The material within subsections is arranged in increasing
order of complexity. This allows the reader to get to the heart of the matter quickly.
The material of the reference book can be roughly categorized into the following three
groups according to meaning:
1. The main text containing a concise, coherent survey of the most important deﬁnitions,
formulas, equations, methods, theorems, and laws.
2. For thereader’sbetter understandingof the topics and methods under study, numerous
examples are given throughout the book.
3. Discussion of additional issues of interest, given in the form of remarks in small
print.
For the reader’s convenience, several long mathematical tables—indeﬁnite and deﬁnite
integrals, direct and inverse integral transforms (Laplace, Mellin, and Fourier transforms),
and exact solutions of differential equations—which contain a large amount of information,
are presented in the supplement of the book. Also included are some physical tables and
the periodic table of the chemical elements.
This handbook consists of parts, chapters, sections, and subsections. Figures and ta-
bles are numbered separately in each section, while formulas (equations) and examples

PREFACE
are numbered separately in each subsection. When citing a formula, we use notation like
(M3.1.2.5), which means formula 5 in Subsection M3.1.2. For the reader’s convenience,
each citation number is preceded by a letter to indicate one of the major parts: mathe-
matics (M), physics (P), engineering sciences (E), or supplements (S). At the end of each
chapter, we present a list of main and additional literature sources containing more detailed
information about topics of interest to the reader.
Special font highlighting in the text, cross-references, an extensive table of contents,
and a detailed index help the reader to ﬁnd the desired information.
Chapters M1, M2, and M6–M9 were written by V. M. Safrai and A. I. Zhurov, Chapters
M3–M5, M10, and M14 by A. V. Manzhirov and V. A. Popov, Chapters M11–M13, E1, E4,
E5, E7, and S1–S5 by A. D. Polyanin, Chapters P1–P8 by A. I. Chernoutsan, Chapter E2 by
V. D. Polyanin, Chapter E3 by B. V. Putyatin, Chapter E6 by A. V. Egorov and Yu. V. Repina,
and Chapters S6 and S7 by A. I. Chernoutsan and A. I. Zhurov. Part M was edited by A. D.
Polyanin and parts E and S were edited by A. D. Polyanin and A. I. Chernoutsan.
We would like to express our deep gratitude to Vladimir Nazaikinskii for translating
several chapters of this handbook.
The authors hope that this book will be helpful for a wide range of engineers, scientists,
university teachers, and students engaged in the ﬁelds of physics, mechanics, engineering
sciences, chemistry, biology, ecology, medicine as well as social and economical sciences.

Mathematics


Chapter M1
Arithmetic and Elementary Algebra
M1.1. Real Numbers
M1.1.1. Integer Numbers
◮Natural, integer, even, and odd numbers. Natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, . . . (all positive
whole numbers).
Integer numbers (or simply integers): 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, . . .
Even numbers: 0, 2, 4, . . . (all nonnegative integers that can be divided evenly by 2).
An even number can generally be represented as n = 2k, where k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Remark 1. Sometimes all integers that are multiples of 2, such as 0, ±2, ±4, . . . , are considered to be
even numbers.
Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, . . . (all natural numbers that cannot be divided evenly by 2). An
odd number can generally be represented as n = 2k + 1, where k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Remark 2. Sometimes all integers that are not multiples of 2, such as ±1, ±3, ±5, . . . , are considered to
be odd numbers.
All integers as well as even numbers and odd numbers form inﬁnite countable sets,
which means that the elements of these sets can be enumerated using the natural numbers
1, 2, 3, . . .
◮Prime and composite numbers. A prime number is a positive integer that is greater
than 1 and has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime numbers form
an inﬁnite countable set. The ﬁrst ten prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,
29, . . .
A composite number is a positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime, i.e.,
has factors other than 1 and itself. Any composite number can be uniquely factored into
a product of prime numbers. The following numbers are composite: 4 = 2 × 2, 6 = 2 × 3,
8 = 23, 9 = 32, 10 = 2 × 5, 12 = 22 × 3, . . .
The number 1 is a special case that is considered to be neither composite nor prime.
◮Divisibility tests. Below are some simple rules helping to determine if an integer is
divisible by another integer.
All integers are divisible by 1.
Divisibility by 2: last digit is divisible by 2.
Divisibility by 3: sum of digits is divisible by 3.
Divisibility by 4: two last digits form a number divisible by 4.
Divisibility by 5: last digit is either 0 or 5.
Divisibility by 6: divisible by both 2 and 3.
Divisibility by 9: sum of digits is divisible by 9.
Divisibility by 10: last digit is 0.
Divisibility by 11: the difference between the sum of the odd-numbered digits (1st, 3rd,
5th, etc.) and the sum of the even-numbered digits (2nd, 4th, etc.) is divisible by 11.

ARITHMETIC AND ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA
Example 1. Let us show that the number 80729 is divisible by 11.
The sum of the odd-numbered digits is Σ1 = 8 + 7 + 9 = 24. The sum of the even-numbered digits is
Σ2 = 0 + 2 = 2. The difference between them is Σ1 – Σ2 = 22 and is divisible by 11. Consequently, the original
number is also divisible by 11.
◮Greatest common divisor and least common multiple.
1◦. The greatest common divisor of natural numbers a1, a2, . . . , an is the largest natural
number, b, which is a common divisor to a1, . . . , an.
Suppose some positive numbers a1, a2, . . . , an are factored into products of primes so
that
a1 = pk11
1 pk12
2
. . . pk1m
m ,
a2 = pk21
1 pk22
2
. . . pk2m
m ,
. . . ,
an = pkn1
1
pkn2
2
. . . pknm
m
,
where p1, p2, . . . , pm are different prime numbers and the kij are nonnegative integers
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n; j = 1, 2, . . . , m). Then the greatest common divisor b of a1, a2, . . . , an is
calculated as
b = pσ1
1 pσ2
2 . . . pσm
m ,
σj = min
1≤i≤n kij.
Example 2. The greatest common divisor of 180 and 280 is 22 × 5 = 20 due to the following factorization:
180 = 22 × 32 × 5 = 22 × 32 × 51 × 70,
280 = 23 × 5 × 7 = 23 × 30 × 51 × 71.
2◦. The least common multiple of n natural numbers a1, a2, . . . , an is the smallest natural
number, A, that is a multiple of all the ak.
Suppose some natural numbers a1, . . . , an are factored into products of primes just as
in Item 1◦. Then the least common multiple of all the ak is calculated as
A = pν1
1 pν2
2 . . . pνm

M1.1.2. Real, Rational, and Irrational Numbers
◮Real numbers. The real numbers are all the positive numbers, negative numbers, and
zero. Any real number can be represented by a decimal fraction (or simply decimal), ﬁnite
or inﬁnite. The set of all real numbers is denoted by R.
All real numbers are categorized into two classes: the rational numbers and irrational
numbers.
◮Rational numbers. A rational number is a real number that can be written as a fraction
(ratio) p/q with integer p and q (q ≠0). It is only the rational numbers that can be written
in the form of ﬁnite (terminating) or periodic (recurring) decimals (e.g., 1/8 = 0.125 and
1/6 = 0.16666 . . . ). Any integer is a rational number.
The rational numbers form an inﬁnite countable set. The set of all rational numbers is
everywhere dense. This means that, for any two distinct rational numbers a and b such that
a < b, there exists at least one more rational number c such that a < c < b, and hence there
are inﬁnitely many rational numbers between a and b. (Between any two rational numbers,
there always exist irrational numbers.)
◮Irrational numbers. An irrational number is a real number that is not rational; no
irrational number can be written as a fraction p/q with integer p and q (q ≠0).
To
the irrational numbers there correspond nonperiodic (nonrepeating) decimals. Here are
examples of irrational numbers:
√
3 = 1.73205 . . . , π = 3.14159 . . .
The set of irrational numbers is everywhere dense, which means that between any
two distinct irrational numbers, there are both rational and irrational numbers. The set of
irrational numbers is uncountable.

M1.2.1. Equalities and Inequalities
Throughout Subsection 1.2.1, it is assumed that a, b, c, d are real numbers.
◮Basic properties of equalities.
1. If a = b, then b = a.
2. If a = b, then a + c = b + c, where c is any real number; furthermore, if a + c = b + c, then
a = b.
3. If a = b, then ac = bc, where c is any real number; furthermore, if ac = bc and c ≠0, then
a = b.
4. If a = b and b = c, then a = c.
5. If ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0; furthermore, if ab ≠0, then a ≠0 and b ≠0.
◮Basic properties of inequalities.
1. If a < b, then b > a.
2. If a ≤b and b ≤a, then a = b.
3. If a ≤b and b ≤c, then a ≤c.
4. If a < b and b ≤c (or a ≤b and b < c), then a < c.
5. If a < b and c < d (or c = d), then a + c < b + d.
6. If a ≤b and c > 0, then ac ≤bc.
7. If a ≤b and c < 0, then ac ≥bc.
8. If 0 < a ≤b (or a ≤b < 0), then 1/a ≥1/b.
M1.2.2. Addition and Multiplication of Numbers
◮Addition of real numbers. The sum of real numbers is a real number.
Properties of addition:
a + 0 = a
(property of zero),
a + b = b + a
(addition is commutative),
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c = a + b + c
(addition is associative),
where a, b, c are arbitrary real numbers.
For any real number a, there exists its unique additive inverse, or its opposite, denoted
by –a, such that
a + (–a) = a – a = 0.
◮Multiplication of real numbers. The product of real numbers is a real number.
Properties of multiplication:
a × 0 = 0
(property of zero),
ab = ba
(multiplication is commutative),
a(bc) = (ab)c = abc
(multiplication is associative),
a × 1 = 1 × a = a
(multiplication by unity),
a(b + c) = ab + ac
(multiplication is distributive),
where a, b, c are arbitrary real numbers.
For any nonzero real number a, there exists its unique multiplicative inverse, or its
reciprocal, denoted by a–1 or 1/a, such that
aa–1 = 1
(a ≠0).

M1.2.3. Ratios and Proportions
◮Operations with fractions and properties of fractions. Ratios are written as fractions:
a : b = a/b. The number a is called the numerator and the number b (b ≠0) is called the
denominator of a fraction.

M1.2.4. Percentage
◮Deﬁnition. Main percentage problems. A percentage is a way of expressing a ratio
or a fraction as a whole number, by using 100 as the denominator. One percent is one per
one hundred, or one hundredth of a whole number; notation: 1%.
Below are the statements of main percentage problems and their solutions.

M1.2.5. Absolute Value of a Number (Modulus of a Number)
◮Deﬁnition. The absolute value of a real number a, denoted by |a|, is deﬁned by the
formula
|a| =
n a
if a ≥0,
–a
if a < 0.
An important property: |a| ≥0.

|ab| = |a| |b|,
|a/b| = |a|/|b|.
2◦. From the inequalities |a| ≤A and |b| ≤B it follows that |a + b| ≤A + B and |ab| ≤AB.
M1.3. Powers and Logarithms
M1.3.1. Powers and Roots
◮Powers and roots: the main deﬁnitions. Given a positive real number a and a positive
integer n, the nth power of a, written as an, is deﬁned as the multiplication of a by itself
repeated n times:

Raising to a negative power: a–n = 1

If a is a positive real number and n is a positive integer, then the nth arithmetic root or
radical of a, written as
n√a, is the unique positive real number b such that bn = a. In the
case of n = 2, the brief notation √a is used to denote
2√a.

given base a is the exponent of the power c to which the base a must be raised to produce b.
It is written as loga b = c.

M1.7. Some Mathematical Methods
M1.7.1. Proof by Contradiction
Proof by contradiction (also known as reductio ad absurdum) is an indirect method of
mathematical proof. It is based on the law of non-contradiction (a statement cannot be true
and false at the same time) and includes the following reasoning:
1. Suppose one has to prove some statement S.
2. One assumes that the opposite of S is true.
3. Based on known axioms, deﬁnitions, theorems, formulas, and the assumption of
Item 2, one arrives at a contradiction (deduces some obviously false statement).
4. One concludes that the assumption of Item 2 is false and hence the original state-
ment S is true, which was to be proved.
Example. (Euclid’s proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2 by contradiction.)
1. It is required to prove that
√
2 is an irrational number, that is, a real number that cannot be represented
as a fraction p/q, where p and q are both integers.
2. Assume the opposite:
√
2 is a rational number. This means that
√
2 can be represented as a fraction
√
2 = p/q.
(1.7.1.1)
Without loss of generality the fraction p/q is assumed to be irreducible, implying that p and q are mutually
prime (have no common factor other than 1).
3. Square both sides of (1.7.1.1) and then multiply by q2 to obtain
2q2 = p2.
(1.7.1.2)
The left-hand side is divisible by 2. Then the right-hand side, p2, and hence p is also divisible by 2. Consequently,
p is an even number so that
p = 2n,
(1.7.1.3)
where n is an integer. Substituting (1.7.1.3) into (1.7.1.2) and then dividing by 2 yields
q2 = 2p2.
(1.7.1.4)
Now it can be concluded, just as above, that q2 and hence q must be divisible by 2. Consequently, q is an even
number so that
q = 2m,
(1.7.1.5)
where m is an integer.
It is now apparent from (1.7.1.3) and (1.7.1.5) that the fraction p/q is not simple, since p and q have a
common factor 2. This contradicts the assumption made in Item 2.
4. It follows from the results of Item 3 that the representation of
√
2 in the form of a fraction (1.7.1.1) is
false, which means that
√
2 is irrational.
M1.7.2. Mathematical Induction
The method of proof by (complete) mathematical induction is based on the following
reasoning:
1. Let A(n) be a statement dependent on n with n = 1, 2, . . . (A is a hypothesis at this
stage).
2. Base case. Suppose the initial statement A(1) is true. This is usually established by
direct substitution n = 1.
3. Induction step. Assume that A(n) is true for any n and then, based on this assumption,
prove that A(n + 1) is also true.
4. Principle of mathematical induction. From the results of Items 2–3 it is concluded
that the statement A(n) is true for any n.

BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR CHAPTER M1

Example.
1. Prove the formula for the sum of odd numbers
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2n – 1) = n2
(1.7.2.1)
for any natural n.
2. For n = 1, we have an obvious identity: 1 = 1.
3. Let us assume that formula (1.7.2.1) holds for any n. To consider the case of n + 1, let us add the next
term, (2n + 1), to both sides of (1.7.2.1) to obtain
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2n – 1) + (2n + 1) = n2 + (2n + 1) = (n + 1)2.
Thus, from the assumption of the validity of formula (1.7.2.1) for any n it follows that (1.7.2.1) is also valid
for n + 1.
4. According to the principle of mathematical induction, this proves formula (1.7.2.1).
Remark. The ﬁrst step, the formulation of an original hypothesis, is the most difﬁcult part of the method
of mathematical induction. This step is often omitted from the method.
M1.7.3. Proof by Counterexample
A counterexample is an example which is used to prove that a statement (proposition) is
false. Counterexamples play an important role in mathematics. Whereas a complicated
proof may be the only way to demonstrate the validity of a particular theorem, a single
counterexample is all that is needed to refute the validity of a proposed theorem.
In general, the scheme of a proof by counterexample is as follows:
1. Given a proposition: all elements a that belong to a set A also belong to a set (possess
a property) B.
2. Refutation of the proposition: one speciﬁes an element a∗(counterexample) that
belongs to A but does not belong to B.
Example. Proposition: Numbers in the form 22n + 1, where n is a positive integer, were once thought to
be prime.
These numbers are prime for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. But for n = 5, we have a counterexample, since
225 + 1 = 4294967297 = 641 × 6700417;
it is a composite number.
Conclusion: When faced with a number in the form 22n+ 1, we are not allowed to assume it is either prime
or composite, unless we know for sure for some other reason.

Elementary Functions
Basic elementary functions: power, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse
trigonometric (arc-trigonometric or antitrigonometric) functions.
All other elementary
functions are obtained from the basic elementary functions and constants by means of
the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and the
operation of composition (composite functions).
The graphs and the main properties of the basic as well as some other frequently
occurring elementary functions of the real variable are described below.
M2.1. Power, Exponential, and Logarithmic Functions
M2.1.1. Power Function: y = xα (α is an Arbitrary Real Number)
◮Graphs of the power function. General properties of the graphs: the point (1, 1)
belongs to all the graphs, and y > 0 for x > 0. For α > 0, the graphs pass through the origin
(0, 0); for α < 0, the graphs have the vertical asymptote x = 0 (y →+∞as x →0). For
α = 0, the graph is a straight line parallel to the x-axis.
Consider more closely the following cases.
Case 1: y = x2n, where n is a positive integer (n = 1, 2, . . . ). This function is deﬁned

and it crosses the axis Oy at y = 1 and does not cross the axis Ox. For a > 1, it is an

◮Graphs of the logarithmic function. This function is deﬁned for all x > 0 and its range
is the entire y-axis. The function is neither odd nor even; it is nonperiodic and unbounded;
it crosses the axis Ox at x = 1 and does not cross the axis Oy. For a > 1, this function is

Figure M2.5. Trigonometric circle.
Let α be the angle between the x-axis and the polar radius OM measured from the positive
direction of the x-axis. This angle is assumed positive in the case of counterclockwise
rotation and negative in the case of clockwise rotation.
Angles are measured either in radians or in degrees. One radian is the angle at the vertex
of the sector of the trigonometric circle supported by its arc of unit length. One degree is
the angle at the vertex of the sector of the trigonometric circle supported by its arc of length
π/180. The radians are related to the degrees by the formulas
1 radian = 180◦
π
;
1◦=

180 .
◮Deﬁnition of trigonometric functions. The sine of α is the ordinate (the projection to
the axis Oy) of the point on the trigonometric circle corresponding to the angle of α radians.
The cosine of α is the abscissa (projection to the axis Ox) of that point (see Fig. M2.5).
The sine and the cosine are basic trigonometric functions and are denoted, respectively, by
sin α and cos α.
Other trigonometric functions are tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant. These are
derived from the basic trigonometric functions, sine and cosine, as follows:
tan α = sin α
cos α ,
cot α = cos α
sin α ,
sec α =
1
cos α ,
cosec α =
1
sin α .
Table M2.1 gives the signs of the trigonometric functions in different quadrants. The
signs and the values of sin α and cos α do not change if the argument α is incremented by
±2πn, where n = 1, 2, . . . The signs and the values of tan α and cot α do not change if the
argument α is incremented by ±πn, where n = 1, 2, . . .

sine is an odd, bounded, periodic function (with period 2π). It crosses the axis Oy at the
point y = 0 and crosses the axis Ox at the points x = πn, n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . The sine is an
increasing function on every segment [– π

M2.3. Inverse Trigonometric Functions
M2.3.1. Deﬁnitions. Graphs of Inverse Trigonometric Functions
◮Deﬁnitions of inverse trigonometric functions. Inverse trigonometric functions (arc
functions) are the functions that are inverse to the trigonometric functions. Since the trigono-
metric functions sin x, cos x, tan x, cot x are periodic, the corresponding inverse functions,
denoted by Arcsin x, Arccos x, Arctan x, Arccot x, are multi-valued. The following rela-
tions deﬁne the multi-valued inverse trigonometric functions:
sin(Arcsin x) = x,
cos(Arccos x) = x,
tan(Arctan x) = x,
cot(Arccot x) = x.
These functions admit the following verbal deﬁnitions: Arcsin x is the angle whose sine is
equal to x; Arccos x is the angle whose cosine is equal to x; Arctan x is the angle whose
tangent is equal to x; Arccot x is the angle whose cotangent is equal to x.
The principal (single-valued) branches of the inverse trigonometric functions are denoted
by
arcsin x ≡sin–1 x
(arcsine is the inverse of sine),
arccos x ≡cos–1 x
(arccosine is the inverse of cosine),
arctan x ≡tan–1 x
(arctangent is the inverse of tangent),
arccot x ≡cot–1 x
(arccotangent is the inverse of cotangent)
and are determined by the inequalities
– π
2 ≤arcsin x ≤π
2 ,
0 ≤arccos x ≤π
(–1 ≤x ≤1);
– π
2 < arctan x < π
2 ,
0 < arccot x < π
(–∞< x < ∞).
The following equivalent relations can be taken as deﬁnitions of single-valued inverse
trigonometric functions:
y = arcsin x,
– 1 ≤x ≤1
⇐⇒
x = sin y,
– π
2 ≤y ≤π
2 ;
y = arccos x,
– 1 ≤x ≤1
⇐⇒
x = cos y,
0 ≤y ≤π;
y = arctan x,
– ∞< x < +∞
⇐⇒
x = tan y,
– π
2 < y < π
2 ;
y = arccot x,
– ∞< x < +∞
⇐⇒
x = cot y,
0 < y < π.
The multi-valued and the single-valued inverse trigonometric functions are related by
the formulas
Arcsin x = (–1)n arcsin x + πn,
Arccos x = ± arccos x + 2πn,
Arctan x = arctan x + πn,
Arccot x = arccot x + πn,
where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
The graphs of inverse trigonometric functions are obtained from the graphs of the
corresponding trigonometric functions by mirror reﬂection with respect to the straight line
y = x (with the domain of each function being taken into account).

with no points of extremum. The graph of the function y = sinh x is given in Fig. M2.14.
◮Hyperbolic cosine:
y = cosh x. This function is deﬁned for all x, and its range
is y ∈[1, +∞). The hyperbolic cosine is an even, nonperiodic, unbounded function that
crosses the axis Oy at y = 1 and does not cross the axis Ox. This function is decreasing on
the interval (–∞, 0) and increasing on the interval (0, +∞); it takes its smallest value y = 1
at x = 0. The graph of the function y = cosh x is given in Fig. M2.15.
◮Hyperbolic tangent: y = tanh x. This function is deﬁned for all x, and its range is
y ∈(–1, 1). The hyperbolic tangent is an odd, nonperiodic, bounded function that crosses
the coordinate axes at the origin x = 0, y = 0. This is an increasing function on the entire
x-axis and has two horizontal asymptotes: y = –1 (as x →–∞) and y = 1 (as x →+∞).
The graph of the function y = tanh x is given in Fig. M2.16.
◮Hyperbolic cotangent:
y = coth x.
This function is deﬁned for all x ≠0, and
its range consists of all y ∈(–∞, –1) and y ∈(1, +∞). The hyperbolic cotangent is an
odd, nonperiodic, unbounded function that does not cross the coordinate axes. This is a
decreasing function on each of the semiaxes of its domain; it has no points of extremum. It
has two horizontal asymptotes: y = –1 (as x →–∞) and y = 1 (as x →+∞). The graph of
the function y = coth x is given in Fig. M2.17.

◮Deﬁnitions of inverse hyperbolic functions. The inverse hyperbolic functions (also
known as the area hyperbolic functions) are the inverses of the respective hyperbolic
functions. The following notation is used for inverse hyperbolic functions:
arcsinh x ≡arsinh x ≡sinh–1 x
(inverse of hyperbolic sine),
arccosh x ≡arcosh x ≡cosh–1 x
(inverse of hyperbolic cosine),
arctanh x ≡artanh x ≡tanh–1 x
(inverse of hyperbolic tangent),
arccoth x ≡arcoth x ≡coth–1 x
(inverse of hyperbolic cotangent).
Inverse hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of logarithmic functions:

(|x| < 1);
arccoth x = 1
2 ln x + 1
x – 1
(|x| > 1).
Here, only one (principal) branch of the function arccosh x is listed, the function itself being
double-valued. In order to write out both branches of arccosh x, the symbol ± should be
placed before the logarithm on the right-hand side of the formula.
The graphs of the inverse hyperbolic functions are given below. These are obtained
from the graphs of the corresponding hyperbolic functions by mirror reﬂection with respect
to the straight line y = x (with the domain of each function taken into account).
◮Inverse hyperbolic sine: y = arcsinh x. This function is deﬁned for all x, and its
range coincides with the y-axis. The arcsinh x is an odd, nonperiodic, unbounded function
that crosses the axes Ox and Oy at the origin x = 0, y = 0. This is an increasing function
on the entire x-axis with no points of extremum. The graph of the function y = arcsinh x is
given in Fig. M2.18.
◮Inverse hyperbolic cosine: y =arccosh x. This functionis deﬁnedfor all x∈[1, +∞),
and its range consists of y ∈[0, +∞). The arccosh x is neither odd nor even; it is nonperiodic
and unbounded. It does not cross the axis Oy and crosses the axis Ox at the point x = 1. It
is an increasing function in its domain with the minimal value y = 0 at x = 1. The graph of
the function y = arccosh x is given in Fig. M2.19.

◮Inverse hyperbolic tangent: y = arctanh x. This function is deﬁned for all x ∈
(–1, 1), and its range consists of all y. The arctanh x is an odd, nonperiodic, unbounded
function that crosses the coordinate axes at the origin x = 0, y = 0. This is an increasing
function in its domain with no points of extremum and an inﬂection point at the origin. It
has two vertical asymptotes: x = ±1. The graph of the function y = arctanh x is given in
Fig. M2.20.
◮Inverse hyperbolic cotangent:
y = arccoth x. This function is deﬁned for x ∈
(–∞, –1) and x ∈(1, +∞).
Its range consists of all y ≠0.
The arccoth x is an odd,
nonperiodic, unbounded function that does not cross the coordinate axes. It is a decreasing
function on each of the semiaxes of its domain. This function has no points of extremum
and has one horizontal asymptote y = 0 and two vertical asymptotes x = ±1. The graph of
the function y = arccoth x is given in Fig. M2.21.

M3.1.1. Triangles
◮Plane triangle and its properties.
1◦. A plane triangle, or simply a triangle, is a plane ﬁgure bounded by three straight line
segments (sides) connecting three noncollinear points (vertices) (Fig. M3.1a). The smaller
angle between the two rays issuing from a vertex and passing through the other two vertices
is called an (interior) angle of the triangle. The angle adjacent to an interior angle is called
an external angle of the triangle. An external angle is equal to the sum of the two interior
angles to which it is not adjacent.

A triangle is uniquely determined by any of the following sets of its parts:
1. Two angles and their included side.
2. Two sides and their included angle.
3. Three sides.
Depending on the angles, a triangle is said to be:
1. Acute if all three angles are acute.
2. Right (or right-angled) if one of the angles is right.
3. Obtuse if one of the angles is obtuse.
Depending on the relation between the side lengths, a triangle is said to be:
1. Regular (or equilateral) if all sides have the same length.
2. Isosceles if two of the sides are of equal length.
3. Scalene if all sides have different lengths.
2◦. Congruence tests for triangles:
1. If two sides of a triangle and their included angle are congruent to the corresponding
parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
2. If two angles of a triangle and their included side are congruent to the corresponding
parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.
37

38
ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY
3. If three sides of a triangle are congruent to the corresponding sides of another triangle,
then the triangles are congruent.
3◦. Triangles are said to be similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corre-
sponding sides are proportional.
Similarity tests for triangles:
1. If all three pairs of corresponding sides in a pair of triangles are in proportion, then the
triangles are similar.
2. If two pairs of corresponding angles in a pair of triangles are congruent, then the triangles
are similar.
3. If two pairs of corresponding sides in a pair of triangles are in proportion and the
included angles are congruent, then the triangles are similar.
The areas of similar triangles are proportional to the squares of the corresponding linear
parts (such as sides, altitudes, medians, etc.).
4◦. The line connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is called a midline of the
triangle. The midline is parallel to and half as long as the third side (Fig. M3.1b).
Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle; let α, β, and γ be the respective
opposite angles (Fig. M3.1a); let R and r be the circumradius and the inradius, respectively;
and let p = 1
2 (a + b + c) be the semiperimeter.

Table M3.2 permits one to ﬁnd the sides and angles of an arbitrary triangle if three
appropriately chosen sides and/or angles are given. From the relations given in Tables M3.1
and M3.2, one can derive all missing relations by cyclic permutations of the sides a, b, and c
and the angles α, β, and γ.

First method.
One of the angles is determined by the law of cosines, cos α = b2 + c2 – a2
2bc
.
Then either the law of sines or the law of cosines is applied.
Second method.
One of the angles is determined by trigonometric angle formulas. Further
proceed in a similar way.
Remark. The sum of lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of
the third side.

First method.
The side c is determined by the law of cosines, c =

a2 + b2 – 2ab cos γ.
The angle α is determined by either the law of cosines or the law of sines. The
angle β is determined from the sum of angles in triangle, β = 180◦– α – γ.
Second method.
α + β is found from the sum of angles in triangle, α + β = 180◦– γ;
α – β is found from the law of tangents, tan α – β
2

a + b cot γ

Then α and β can be found. The third side c is determined by either the law of
cosines or the law of sines.
3
A side c

angles α, β

The third angle γ is found from the sum of angles in triangle, γ = 180◦– α – β.
Sides a and b are determined by the law of sines.
4
Two sides a, b
and the angle α
opposite one
of them
The second angle is determined by the law of sines, sin β = b
a sin α.
The third angle is γ = 180◦– α – β.
The third side is determined by the law of sines, c = a sin γ
sin α .
Remark. Five cases are possible:
1. a > b; i.e., the angle is opposite the greater side. Then α > β, β < 90◦(the larger
angle is opposite the larger side), and the triangle is determined uniquely.
2. a = b; i.e., the triangle is isosceles and is determined uniquely.
3. a < b and b sin α < a. Then there are two solutions, β1 + β2 = 180◦.
4. a < b and b sin α = a. Then the solution is unique, β = 90◦.
5. a < b and b sin α > a. Then there are no solutions.
◮Medians, angle bisectors, and altitudes of a triangle.
A straight line through a
vertex of a triangle and the midpoint of the opposite side is called a median of the triangle
(Fig. M3.2a). The three medians of a triangle intersect in a single point lying strictly inside
the triangle, which is called the centroid or center of gravity of the triangle. This point cuts
the medians in the ratio 2 : 1 (counting from the corresponding vertices).
The length of the median ma to the side a is equal to

Figure M3.2. Medians (a), angle bisectors (b), and altitudes (c) of a triangle.
An angle bisector of a triangle is a line segment between a vertex and a point of the
opposite side and dividing the angle at that vertex into two equal parts (Fig. M3.2b). The
three angle bisectors intersect in a single point lying strictly inside the triangle. This point
is equidistant from all sides and is called the incenter (the center of the incircle of the
triangle). The angle bisector through a vertex cuts the opposite side in ratio proportional to
the adjacent sides of the triangle.
The length of the angle bisector la drawn to the side a is given by the formulas

where R is the circumradius (see below).
An altitude of a triangle is a straight line passing through a vertex and perpendicular to
the straight line containing the opposite side (Fig. M3.2c). The three altitudes of a triangle
intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle.
The length of the altitude ha to the side a is given by the formulas
ha = b sin γ = c sin β = bc
2R ,
ha = 2(p – a) cos α
2 cos β
2 cos γ
2 = 2(p – b) sin α
2 sin β
2 cos γ
2 .
(M3.1.1.3)
The lengths of the altitude, the angle bisector, and the median through the same vertex
satisfy the inequality ha ≤la ≤ma. If ha = la = ma, then the triangle is isosceles; moreover,
the ﬁrst equality implies the second, and vice versa.
◮Circumcircle and incircle. A straight line passing through the midpoint of a segment
and perpendicular to it is called the perpendicular bisector of the segment. The circle
passing through the vertices of a triangle is called the circumcircle of the triangle. The
center O1 of the circumcircle, called the circumcenter, is the point where the perpendicular
bisectors of the sides of the triangle meet (Fig. M3.3a). The feet of the perpendiculars
drawn from a point Q on the circumcircle to the three sides of the triangle lie on the same
straight line called the Simpson line of Q with respect to the triangle (Fig. M3.3b). The
circumcenter, the orthocenter, and the centroid lie on a single line, called the Euler line
(Fig. M3.3c).
The circle tangent to the three sides of a triangle and lying inside the triangle is called
the incircle of the triangle. The center O2 of the incircle (the incenter) is the point where the
angle bisectors meet (Fig. M3.4a). The straight lines connecting the vertices of a triangle
with the points at which the incircle is tangent to the respective opposite sides intersect in
a single point G called the Gergonne point (Fig. M3.4b).

◮Right (right-angled) triangles. A right triangle is a triangle with a right angle. The
side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the
legs (Fig. M3.5).

where h is the length of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse; moreover, the altitude cuts
the hypotenuse into segments of lengths m and n.
In a right triangle, the length of the median mc drawn from the vertex of the right
angle coincides with the circumradius R and is equal to half the length of the hypotenuse c,

Properties of isosceles triangles:
1. In an isosceles triangle, the angles adjacent to the base are equal.
2. In an isosceles triangle, the median drawn to the base is the angle bisector and the
altitude.
3. In an isosceles triangle, the sum of distances from a point of the base to the legs is
constant.

Criteria for a triangle to be isosceles:
1. If two angles in a triangle are equal, then the triangle is isosceles.
2. If a median in a triangle is also an altitude, then the triangle is isosceles.
3. If a bisector in a triangle is also an altitude, then the triangle is isosceles.
2◦. An equilateral (or regular) triangle is a triangle with all three sides equal (Fig. M3.6b).
All angles of an equilateral triangle are equal to 60◦. In an equilateral triangle, the circum-
radius R and the inradius r satisfy the relation R = 2r.
For an equilateral triangle with side length a, the circumradius and the inradius are given
by the formulas R =

M3.1.2. Polygons
◮Polygons. Basic information. A polygon is a plane ﬁgure bounded by a closed broken
line. The straight line segments forming a polygon are called its sides (or edges). The
points at which two sides meet are called the vertices (or corners) of the polygon. Two
sides sharing a vertex, as well as two successive vertices (the endpoints of the same edge),
are said to be adjacent. A polygon is said to be convex if it lies on one side of any straight
line passing through two neighboring vertices. In what follows, we consider only simple
convex polygons.
An (interior) angle of a convex polygon is the angle between two sides meeting in a
vertex. A convex polygon is said to be inscribed in a circle if all of its vertices lie on the
circle. A polygon is said to be circumscribed about a circle if all of its sides are tangent to
the circle.
For a convex polygon with n sides, the sum of interior angles is equal to 180◦(n – 2).
One can ﬁnd the area of an arbitrary polygon by dividing it into triangles.

same length and all of its interior angles are equal. A convex n-gon is regular if and only if
it is taken to itself by the rotation by an angle of 2π/n about some point O. The point O is
called the center of the regular polygon. The angle between two rays issuing from the center
and passing through two neighboring vertices is called the central angle (Fig. M3.11).

M3.1.3. Circle
◮Some deﬁnitions and formulas. A circle is the set of all points in the plane that are
the same ﬁxed distance R from a ﬁxed point O (Fig. M3.12a). The distance R is called the
radius of the circle and the point O is called its center. A plane ﬁgure bounded by a circle,
including its interior, is called a disk. A segment connecting two points on a circle is called
a chord. A chord passing through the center of a circle is called a diameter of the circle
(Fig. M3.12b). The length of a diameter is d = 2R. A straight line that touches a circle
at a single point is called a tangent, and the common point is called the point of tangency
(Fig. M3.12c). A straight line that cuts a circle at two points, an extended chord, is called a

◮Segment and sector. A plane ﬁgure bounded by two radii and one of the subtended

radii (Fig. M3.14b). Let R be the outer radius of an annulus (the radius of the outer bounding
circle), and let r be the inner radius (the radius of the inner bounding circle). Then the area

M3.2.1. Straight Lines, Planes, and Angles in Space
◮Mutual arrangement of straight lines and planes.
1◦. Two distinct straight lines lying in a single plane either have exactly one point of
intersection or do not meet at all. In the latter case, they are said to be parallel. If two
straight lines do not lie in a single plane, then they are called skew lines.
The angle between skew lines is determined as the angle between lines parallel to them
and lying in a single plane (Fig. M3.15a). The distance between skew lines is the length of
the straight line segment that meets both lines and is perpendicular to them.

2◦. Two distinct planes either intersect in a straight line or do not have common points.
In the latter case, they are said to be parallel. Coinciding planes are also assumed to be
parallel. If two planes are perpendicular to a single straight line or each of them contains a
pair of intersecting straight lines parallel to the corresponding lines in the other pair, then
the planes are parallel.

50
ELEMENTARY GEOMETRY
3◦. A straight line either entirely lies in the plane, meets the plane at a single point, or has
no common points with the plane. In the last case, the line is said to be parallel to the plane.
The angle between a straight line and a plane is equal to the angle between the line
and its projection onto the plane (Fig. M3.15b). If a straight line is perpendicular to two
intersecting straight lines on a plane, then it is perpendicular to each line on the plane, i.e.,
perpendicular to the plane.
◮Polyhedral angles.
1◦. A dihedral angle is a ﬁgure in space formed by two half-planes issuing from a single
straight line as well as the part of space bounded by these half-planes. The half-planes are
called the faces of the dihedral angle, and their common straight line is called the edge.
A dihedral angle is measured by its linear angle ABC (Fig. M3.16a), i.e., by the angle
between the perpendiculars raised to the edge DE of the dihedral angle in both planes
(faces) at the same point.

Figure M3.16. A dihedral (a) and a trihedral (b) angle.
2◦. A part of space bounded by an inﬁnite triangular pyramid is called a trihedral angle
(Fig. M3.16b). The faces of this pyramid are called the faces of the trihedral angle, and the
vertex of the pyramid is called the vertex of a trihedral angle. The rays in which the faces
intersect are called the edges of a trihedral angle. The edges form face angles, and the faces
form the dihedral angles of the trihedral angle. As a rule, one considers trihedral angles
with dihedral angles less than π (or 180◦), i.e., convex trihedral angles. Each face angle of
a convex trihedral angle is less than the sum of the other two face angles and greater than
their difference.
Two trihedral angles are equal if one of the following conditions is satisﬁed:
1. Two face angles, together with the included dihedral angle, of the ﬁrst trihedral angle
are equal to the respective parts (arranged in the same order) of the second trihedral
angle.
2. Two dihedral angles, together with the included face angle, of the ﬁrst trihedral angle
are equal to the respective parts (arranged in the same order) of the second trihedral
angle.
3. The three face angles of the ﬁrst trihedral angle are equal to the respective face angles
(arranged in the same order) of the second trihedral angle.
4. The three dihedral angles of the ﬁrst trihedral angle are equal to the respective dihedral
angles (arranged in the same order) of the second trihedral angle.
3◦. A polyhedral angle OABCDE (Fig. M3.17a) is formed by several planes (faces)
having a single common point (the vertex) and successively intersecting along straight lines
OA, OB, . . . , OE (the edges). Two edges belonging to the same face form a face angle of
the polyhedral angle, and two neighboring faces form a dihedral angle.

Figure M3.17. A polyhedral (a) and a solid (b) angle.
Polyhedral angles are equal (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by
translations and rotations. For polyhedral angles to be congruent, the corresponding parts
(face and dihedral angles) must be equal.
A convex polyhedral angle lies entirely on one side of each of its faces.
The sum
∠AOB + ∠BOC + · · · + ∠EOA of face angles (Fig. M3.17a) of any convex polyhedral
angle is less that 2π (or 360◦).
4◦. A solid angle is a part of space bounded by straight lines issuing from a single point
(vertex) to all points of some closed curve (Fig. M3.17b). Trihedral and polyhedral angles
are special cases of solid angles. A solid angle is measured by the area cut by the solid angle
on the sphere of unit radius centered at the vertex. Solid angles are measured in steradians.
The entire sphere forms a solid angle of 4π steradians.
M3.2.2. Polyhedra
◮General concepts. A polyhedron is a closed object formed by intersecting planes. In
other words, a polyhedron is a set of ﬁnitely many plane polygons satisfying the following
conditions:
1. Each side of each polygon is simultaneously a side of a unique other polygon, which is
said to be adjacent to the ﬁrst polygon (via this side).
2. From each of the polygons forming a polyhedron, one can reach any other polygon by
successively passing to adjacent polygons.
These polygons are called the faces, their sides are called the edges, and their vertices are
called the vertices of a polyhedron.
A polyhedron is said to be convex if it lies entirely on one side of the plane of any of its
faces; if a polyhedron is convex, then so are its faces.
EULER’S THEOREM. If the number of vertices in a convex polyhedron is v, the number
of edges is e, and the number of faces is f, then v + f – e = 2.
◮Prism. Parallelepiped.
1◦. An n-sided prism is a polyhedron in which two faces are equal n-gons (the base faces)
that lie on parallel planes and have respectively parallel sides, and the remaining n faces
(joining or lateral faces) are parallelograms; see Fig. M3.18a. A right prism is a prism in
which the lateral faces are perpendicular to the base faces; otherwise it is an oblique prism.
A right prism is said to be regular if its base faces are regular polygons.
If l is the lateral edge length, S is the area of the base face, H is the height of the prism
(perpendicular distance between the planes of the bases), Psec is the perimeter of a normal

the area of the lateral surface Slat and the volume V of the prism are given by the formulas
Slat = Psecl
V = SH = Ssecl.
(M3.2.2.1)
The portion of a prism between one of the bases and a plane nonparallel to it is called a
truncated prism (Fig. M3.18b). The volume of a truncated prism is
V = LS1,
(M3.2.2.2)
where L is the length of the segment connecting the centroids of the base faces and S1 is
the area of the section of the prism by a plane perpendicular to this segment.
The volume of a truncated regular prism (its base being a regular n-gon) is expressed as
V = Ssec
l1 + l2 + · · · + ln
n
,
where Ssec is the area of a normal section and l1, l2, . . . , ln are the lengths of the lateral
edges.
2◦. A prism whose bases are parallelograms is called a parallelepiped. All four diagonals
in a parallelepiped intersect at a single point and bisect each other (Fig. M3.19a).
A
parallelepiped is said to be rectangular if it is a right prism and its base faces are rectangles.
In a rectangular parallelepiped, all diagonals are equal (Fig. M3.19b).

If a, b, and c are the lengths of the edges of a rectangular parallelepiped, then the
diagonal d can be determined by the formula d2 = a2 + b2 + c2. The volume of a rectangular
parallelepiped is given by the formula V = abc, and the lateral surface area is Slat = PH,
where P is the perimeter of the base face.
3◦. A rectangular parallelepiped all of whose edges are equal (a = b = c) is called a cube.
The diagonal of a cube is given by the formula d2 = 3a2. The volume of the cube is V = a3,
and the lateral surface area is Slat = 4a2.

◮Pyramid, obelisk, and wedge.
1◦. A pyramid is a polyhedron in which one face (the base of the pyramid) is an arbitrary
polygon and the other (lateral) faces are triangles with a common vertex, called the apex of
the pyramid (Fig. M3.20a). The base of an n-sided pyramid is an n-gon. The perpendicular
through the apex to the base of a pyramid is called the altitude (height) of the pyramid.

where S is the area of the base and H is the altitude of the pyramid.
If DO is the altitude of the pyramid ABCD and DA ⊥BC, then the plane DAE is

Given the length of the edges, DA = a, DB = b, DC = c, BC = p, AC = q, and AB = r,

A pyramid is said to be regular if its base is a regular n-gon and the altitude passes
through the center of the base. The altitude (dropped from the apex) of a lateral face is
called the apothem of a regular pyramid. For a regular pyramid, the lateral surface area is
Slat = 1

◮Cylinder. A cylindrical surface is a surface in space swept by a straight line (the gen-
erator) moving parallel to a given direction along some curve (the directrix) (Fig. M3.24a).
1◦. A solid bounded by a closed cylindrical surface and two planes is called a cylinder; the
planes are called the bases of the cylinder (Fig. M3.24b).
If P is the perimeter of the base, Psec is the perimeter of the section perpendicular to the

the generator, then the lateral surface area Slat and the volume V of the cylinder are given
by the formulas
Slat = PH = Psecl,
V = SbasH = Ssecl.
(M3.2.3.1)
In a right cylinder, the bases are perpendicular to the generator. In particular, if the
bases are disks, then one speaks of a right circular cylinder. The volume, the lateral surface

◮Sphere. Spherical parts. The torus.
1◦. A sphere is the set of all points in space that are the same distance R from a ﬁxed
point O (Fig. M3.27a). The distance R is called the radius of the sphere and the point O
is called its center. A straight line segment that passes through the center of a sphere and
whose endpoints are on the sphere is called a diameter of the sphere. A solid formed by
a sphere together with its interior is called a ball. Any section of the sphere by a plane is
a circle. The section of the sphere by a plane passing through its center is called a great
circle of radius R. There exists exactly one great circle passing through two arbitrary points
on the sphere that are not antipodal (i.e., are not the opposite endpoints of a diameter); the
smaller arc of this great circle is the shortest distance on the sphere between these points.

M4.1. Points, Segments, and Coordinate Plane
M4.1.1. Cartesian and Polar Coordinates on Plane
◮Rectangular Cartesian coordinates in the plane. A rectangular Cartesian coordinate
system consists of two mutually perpendicular directed lines, called coordinate axes, each
treated as a number line (see Subsection M6.1.1). The point of intersection of the axes is
called the origin and usually labeled with the letter O, while the axes themselves are called
the coordinate axes. As a rule, one of the coordinate axes is horizontal, directed from left to
right, and called the abscissa axis. The other axis is vertical, directed upwards, and called the
ordinate axis. The two axes are usually denoted by X or OX and Y or OY , respectively,
and the coordinate system itself is denoted by XY or OXY . The two coordinate axes
divide the plane into four parts, which are called quadrants and numbered I, II, III, and IV
counterclockwise as shown in Fig. M4.1.
Figure M4.1. A rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.
Each point M in the plane is uniquely deﬁned by a pair of real numbers (x0, y0), called
its coordinates, which specify its projections onto the X- and Y -axes. The numbers x0
and y0 are called, respectively, the abscissa and the ordinate of the point M.
Remark. Strictly speaking, the coordinate system introduced above is a right rectangular Cartesian
coordinate system. A left rectangular Cartesian coordinate system can, for example, be obtained by changing
the direction of one of the axes. A right rectangular Cartesian coordinate system is usually called simply a
Cartesian coordinate system.
If A and B are two points in the plane, then the length of the segment AB will be
denoted |AB|.
◮Polar coordinates. A polar coordinate system is determined by a point O called the
pole, a ray OA issuing from this point, which is called the polar axis, a scale segment
for measuring lengths, and the positive sense of rotation around the pole. Usually, the
counterclockwise sense is assumed to be positive (see Fig. M4.2a).

ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
The position of each point M on the plane is determined by two polar coordinates,
the polar radius ρ = |OM| and the polar angle θ = ∠AOM (the values of the angle θ are
deﬁned up to an additive term 2πn, where n is an integer). To be deﬁnite, one usually
assumes that 0 ≤θ ≤2π or –π ≤θ ≤π. The polar radius of the pole is zero, and its polar
angle does not have any deﬁnite value.
Figure M4.2. A polar coordinate system (a). Relationship between Cartesian and polar coordinates (b).
◮Relationship between Cartesian and polar coordinates.
Suppose that M is an
arbitrary point in the plane, (x, y) are its rectangular Cartesian coordinates, and (ρ, θ) are
its polar coordinates (see Fig. M4.2b). The transformation from one coordinate system to
the other is expressed by the formulas
x = ρ cos θ,
y = ρ sin θ
or
ρ =
q
x2 + y2,
tan θ = y/x,
(M4.1.1.1)
where the polar angle θ is determined with regard to the quadrant where the point M lies.
Example. Let us ﬁnd the polar coordinates ρ, θ (0 ≤θ ≤2π) of the point M whose Cartesian coordinates
are x = –3, y = –3.
From formulas (M4.1.1.1), we obtain ρ =
p
(–3)2 + (–3)2 = 3
√
2 and tan θ = –3
–3 = 1. Since the point M
lies in the third quadrant, we have θ = arctan 1 + π = 5
4 π.
M4.1.2. Distance Between Points. Division of Segment in Given
Ratio. Area of a Polygon
◮Distance between points on plane.
The distance d between two arbitrary points
A1(x1, y1) and A2(x2, y2) on the plane is given by the formula
d =
q
(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2,
where x and y with the respective subscripts are the Cartesian coordinates of these points,
and by the formula
d =
q
ρ2
1 + ρ2
2 – 2ρ1ρ2 cos(θ2 – θ1),
where ρ and θ with the respective subscripts are the polar coordinates of these points.
◮Angles between segments. The angle β between arbitrary segments A1A2 and A3A4
joining the points A1(x1, y1), A2(x2, y2) and A3(x3, y3), A4(x4, y4), respectively, can be
found from the relation
cos β =
(x2 – x1)(x4 – x3) + (y2 – y1)(y4 – y3)
p
(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2p
(x4 – x3)2 + (y4 – y3)2 .

◮Division of a segment in a given ratio. Given two points, A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2),
and a number λ, the coordinates of the point M(x, y) dividing the segment AB in the
ratio λ = |AM| : |MB| are expressed as
x = x1 + λx2
1 + λ
,
y = y1 + λy2
1 + λ
.

In
formulas (M4.1.2.2) and (M4.1.2.3), one takes the plus sign if the vertices are numbered
counterclockwise (see Fig. M4.3a) and the minus sign otherwise.

In
formulas (M4.1.2.4) and (M4.1.2.5), one takes the plus sign if the vertices are numbered
counterclockwise (see Fig. M4.3b) and the minus sign otherwise.
Remark. One often says that formulas (M4.1.2.2)–(M4.1.2.5) express the oriented area of the corre-
sponding ﬁgures.

M4.2. Straight Lines and Points on Plane
M4.2.1. Equations of Straight Lines on Plane
◮Equation of a curve. Given a coordinate system, the set of all points in the plane can
be treated as the set of various pairs of numbers x, y. Relations imposed upon x and y
deﬁne subsets of the plane.
A line in the plane is usually deﬁned using an equation relating the Cartesian coordinates
x and y. An equation
F(x, y) = 0
is an equation of a curve in the plane if the coordinates of all the points lying on the curve
satisfy the equation and the coordinates of all those points that do not lie on the curve do
not satisfy it.
Example 1. Derive an equation of the line all of whose points are equidistant from the points A(0, 2) and
B(4, –2).
Let M(x, y) be a point that belongs to the line. For the distances to A and B, we have
ρ(A, M) =
p
x2 + (y – 2)2,
ρ(B, M) =
p
(x – 4)2 + (y + 2)2.
It follows from the relation ρ(A, M) = ρ(B, M) that x2 +(y –2)2 = (x –4)2 +(y +2)2. Expanding and collecting
similar terms yields y = x – 2, which is an equation that determines a straight line.
Parametric equations of a curve on the plane have the form
x = ϕ(t),
y = ψ(t),
where x and y are treated as the coordinates of some point M for each value of the variable
parameter t.
◮Slope-intercept equation of a straight line. The slope-intercept equation of a straight
line in the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system OXY has the form
y = kx + b,
(M4.2.1.1)
where k = tan ϕ is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept of the line, i.e., the signed
distance from the point of intersection of the line with the ordinate axis to the origin.
Equation (M4.2.1.1) is meaningful for any straight line that is not perpendicular to the
abscissa axis (see Fig. M4.4a).

M4.2. STRAIGHT LINES AND POINTS ON PLANE
65
If a straight line is not perpendicular to the OX-axis, then its equation can be written
as (M4.2.1.1), but if a straight line is perpendicular to the OX-axis, then its equation can
be written as
x = a,
(M4.2.1.2)
where a is the abscissa of the point of intersection of this line with the OX-axis (see
Fig. M4.4b).
For the slope of a straight line, we also have the formula
k = y2 – y1
x2 – x1
,
(M4.2.1.3)
where A1(x1, y1) and A2(x2, y2) are two arbitrary points of the line.
◮Point-slope equation of a straight line. In the rectangular Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem OXY , the equation of a straight line with slope k passing through a point A(x1, y1)
has the form
y – y1 = k(x – x1).
(M4.2.1.4)
If we set x1 = 0 and y1 = b in equation (M4.2.1.4), then we obtain equation (M4.2.1.1).
◮Equation of a straight line passing through two given points. The equation of a
straight line passing through two distinct points A1(x1, y1) and A2(x2, y2) has the form
x – x1
x2 – x1
= y – y1
y2 – y1
(x1 ≠x2, y1 ≠y2).
(M4.2.1.5)
If x1 = x2, this equation degenerates into x = x1. If y1 = y2, the equation becomes y = y1.
Example 2. Let us derive the equation of the straight line passing through the points A1(5, 1) and A2(7, 3).
Substituting the coordinates of these points into formula (M4.2.1.5), we obtain
x – 5
2
= y – 1
2
or
y = x – 4.
◮General equation of a straight line. A linear equation of the form
Ax + By + C = 0
(A2 + B2 ≠0)
(M4.2.1.6)
is called the general equation of a straight line in the rectangular Cartesian coordinate
system OXY . In rectangular Cartesian coordinates, each straight line is determined by an
equation of degree 1, and, conversely, each equation of degree 1 determines a straight line.
If B ≠0, then equation (M4.2.1.6) can be written as (M4.2.1.1), where k = –A/B and
b = –C/B.
Special cases of equation (M4.2.1.6):
1. If A = 0 and B ≠0, then the equation becomes y = –C/B and determines a straight line
parallel to the axis OX.
2. If B = 0 and A ≠0, then the equation becomes x = –C/A and determines a straight line
parallel to the axis OY .
3. If C = 0, then the equation becomes Ax + By = 0 and determines a straight line passing
through the origin.
◮General equation of a straight line passing through a given point. In the rectangular
Cartesian coordinate system OXY , the general equation of a straight line passing through
a point M(x1, y1) in the plane has the form
A(x – x1) + B(y – y1) = 0.
(M4.2.1.7)

ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
◮Parametric equations of a straight line. In the rectangular Cartesian coordinate sys-
tem OXY , a straight line passing through a point M(x1, y1) in the plane can be represented
by the parametric equations
x = x1 + At,
y = y1 + Bt,
(M4.2.1.8)
where A and B are constants and t is a variable parameter.
A straight line passingthroughtwopoints, M1(x1, y1) andM2(x2, y2), canbe represented
by the parametric equations
x = x1(1 – t) + x2t,
y = y1(1 – t) + y2t.
(M4.2.1.9)
◮Intercept-intercept equation of a straight line. The general equation of a straight line
can be rewritten in the form
x
a + y
b = 1,
which is called the intercept-intercept equation of a straight line. The numbers a and b are
the x- and y-intercepts of the straight line, i.e., the signed distances from the origin to the
points at which the straight line crosses the coordinate axes (see Fig. M4.5).

Figure M4.5. A straight line with intercept-intercept equation.
◮Equation of a pencil of straight lines. The set of all straight lines passing through a
ﬁxed point M in the plane is called a pencil of straight lines, and the point M itself is called
the center of the pencil. The equation determining all straight lines in the pencil is called
the equation of the pencil.
1◦. Given the Cartesian coordinates of the pencil center M(x1, y1), then the equation of any
straight line in the pencil has the form (M4.2.1.7), where A and B are arbitrary constants.
2◦. If the equations of two straight lines in the pencil are known, A1x + B1y + C1 = 0
and A2x + B2y + C2 = 0, then the equation of the pencil can be written as
α(A1x + B1y + C1) + β(A2x + B2y + C2) = 0,
where α and β are any numbers that are not simultaneously zero.
M4.2.2. Mutual Arrangement of Points and Straight Lines
◮Condition for three points to be collinear. Suppose there are three distinct points,
M1(x1, y1), M2(x2, y2), and M3(x3, y3), given in the Cartesian coordinate system OXY on
the plane. They are collinear (lie on the same straight line) if and only if

This condition reﬂects the fact that the area of the triangle with vertices at the above points
is zero; cf. Eq. (M4.1.2.2).
◮Distance from a point to a straight line. The distance d from a point M(x0, y0) to a

(M4.2.2.1)
Example 1. Let us ﬁnd the distance from the point M(2, 1) to the straight line 3x – 4y + 8 = 0. We use
formula (M4.2.2.1) to obtain
d = |3 ⋅2 – 4 ⋅1 + 8|

◮Angle between two straight lines.
1◦. If two straight lines are given by the equations
y = k1x + b1,
y = k2x + b2,
where k1 = tan ϕ1 and k2 = tan ϕ2 are the slopes of the respective lines (see Fig. M4.6), the
angle α between these straight lines is determined by the formula
tan α = k2 – k1
1 + k1k2
(k1k2 ≠–1).
If k1 = k2, the straight lines are parallel (α = 0).
If k1k2 = –1, the straight lines are perpendicular (α = 1

Example 2. Given a triangle with vertices A(–2, 0), B(2, 4), and C(4, 0), derive the equations of the side
BC and the altitude AH.
Using (M4.2.1.5), one ﬁnds an equation for the side BC: x – 2
4 – 2 = y – 4
0 – 4 , or y = –2x + 8. It follows that
the slope of this straight line is kBC = –2. The above condition for two straight lines to be perpendicular gives
kAH = –

kBC = 1

2◦. If two straight lines are deﬁned by the general equations
A1x + B1y + C1 = 0,
A2x + B2y + C2 = 0,
(M4.2.2.2)
the angle α between them can be calculated from
tan α = A1B2 – A2B1
A1A2 + B1B2
(A1A2 + B1B2 ≠0).
If A1B2 – A2B1 = 0 (or A1/A2 = B1/B2), the straight lines are parallel.
If A1A2 + B1B2 = 0, the straight lines are perpendicular.
◮Point of intersection of straight lines. Suppose that two straight lines are deﬁned by
general equations in the form (M4.2.2.2). Each common solution of equations (M4.2.2.2)
determines a common point of the two lines.
If the determinant of system (M4.2.2.2) is not zero, i.e.,
 A1
B1
A2
B2
 = A1B2 – A2B1 ≠0,
then the system is consistent and has a unique solution; hence, these straight lines are
distinct and nonparallel and meet at the point A(x0, y0), where
x0 = B1C2 – B2C1
A1B2 – A2B1
,
y0 = C1A2 – C2A1

◮Distance between parallel lines. The distance between the parallel lines given by

◮Other equations of a circle. The equation of the circle (M4.3.1.1) can be represented
in parametric form as
x = a cos θ,
y = a sin θ,
where the polar angle θ plays the role of the variable parameter.
In the polar coordinate system, the equation of the circle (M4.3.1.1) becomes
ρ = a.
Note that it does not contain the polar angle θ.
M4.3.2. Ellipse
◮Deﬁnition and the canonical equation of an ellipse. An ellipse is the locus of points
in the plane the sum of whose distances to two points, F1 and F2, is a constant quantity,
denoted 2a; see Fig. M4.8 a. Either of the points F1 and F2 is called a focus of the ellipse
and the distance between them, ρ(F1, F2) = 2c, is called the focal distance.
In the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system where the X-axis is the straight line
passing through the foci, the origin O coincides with the midpoint of the segment F1F2, and
the Y -axis passes through O and is perpendicular to the X-axis, as shown in Fig. M4.8 a,

Equation (M4.3.2.1) is called the canonical equation of the ellipse. Here, it is assumed that
a ≥b > 0.
The positive numbers a and b are called, respectively, the semimajor axis and semiminor
axis of the ellipse, with b =
√
a2 – c2.
The number c =
√
a2 – b2 is called the linear
eccentricity of the ellipse. The number e = c/a =
p
1 – b2/a2 is called the eccentricity or
the numerical eccentricity of the ellipse, with 0 ≤e < 1. The number p = b2/a is called the
focal parameter (or simply the parameter) of the ellipse.
The point O(0, 0) is called the center of the ellipse. The points of intersection of the
ellipse with the axes of symmetry, A1(–a, 0), A2(a, 0) and B1(0, –b), B2(0, b), are called its
vertices. The straight line passing through the foci of an ellipse is known as its major axis
and is sometimes called its focal axis. Either of the straight lines x = ±a/e (e ≠0) is called
a directrix of the ellipse. The focus F2(c, 0) and the directrix x = a/e are said to be right,
and the focus F1(–c, 0) and the directrix x = –a/e are said to be left.
Remark. For a = b (c = 0), equation (M4.3.2.1) becomes x2 + y2 = a2 and determines a circle.

◮Focal and focus-directrix properties of an ellipse.
The segments joining a point
M(x, y) of an ellipse with the foci F1(–c, 0) and F2(c, 0) are called the left and right focal
radii of this point. We denote the lengths of the left and right focal radii by r1 = |F1M| and
r2 = |F2M|, respectively (see Fig. M4.8 b). By the deﬁnition of an ellipse,
r1 + r2 = 2a,
where r1 and r2 satisfy the relations
r1 =
q
(x + c)2 + y2 = a + ex,
r2 =

with the focal radii of the point of tangency, and

This fact, written as
ϕ1 = ϕ2,
is known as the optical property of an ellipse. It means that a light ray issued from one
focus of the ellipse will reﬂect to the other focus (see Fig. M4.8 b, where M = M0).
◮Equations of an ellipse in polar coordinates and parametric equations. In polar
coordinates (ρ, ϕ), with the pole coinciding with the right focus and the polar axis directed
along the X-axis, the equation of an ellipse has the form
ρ =
p
1 + e cos ϕ ,
where 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π, p = b2/a, and e =
p
1 – b2/a2. If the pole is taken at the left focus, this
equation becomes
ρ =

1 – e cos ϕ .
The equation of an ellipse can also be represented in the parametric form
x = a cos t,
y = b sin t,
with the parameter t assuming any values from 0 to 2π.
M4.3.3. Hyperbola
◮Deﬁnition and the canonical equation of a hyperbola. A hyperbola is the locus of
points in the plane the absolute difference of whose distances to two points, F1 and F2, is
a constant quantity, denoted 2a; see Fig. M4.9 a. Either of the points F1 and F2 is called
a focus of the hyperbola and the distance between them, ρ(F1, F2) = 2c, is called the focal
distance.
In the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system where the X-axis is the straight line
passing through the foci, the origin O coincides with the midpoint of the segment F1F2, and
the Y -axis passes through O and is perpendicular to the X-axis, as shown in Fig. M4.8 a,

and is called the canonical equation of the hyperbola.
The number a is called the real semiaxis of the hyperbola and the number b is called
its imaginary semiaxis, with b =
√
c2 – a2. The number c =
√
a2 + b2 is known as the
linear eccentricity of the hyperbola and the number e = c/a =
p
1 + b2/a2 is its eccentricity,
e > 1. The number p = b2/a is called the focal parameter (or simply the parameter) of the
hyperbola.
The point O(0, 0) is called the center of the hyperbola. The points (–a, 0) and (a, 0) at
which the hyperbola crosses the X-axis are known as the vertices of the hyperbola. Either
of the straight lines x = ±a/e is called a directrix of the hyperbola. The focus F2(c, 0) and
the directrix x = a/e are said to be right, while the focus F1(–c, 0) and the directrix x = –a/e
are said to be left.
A hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches, lying in the domains x ≥a and
x ≤–a. It has two asymptotes, straight lines the hyperbola approaches at large distances
from its center, which are given by
y = b
a x
and
y = – b
a x.
The branches of a hyperbola lie within two vertical angles formed by the asymptotes and
are called its left and right branches. The angle ϕ between the asymptotes of a hyperbola
is determined by the equation
tan ϕ
2 = b
a .
Remark. If a = b (e =
√
2 ), then ϕ =
1
2 π.
In this case, the hyperbola is said to be equilateral or
rectangular and its asymptotes are mutually perpendicular. The equation of an equilateral hyperbola has the
form x2 – y2 = a2. If the asymptotes are taken to be the coordinate axes, then the equation of the hyperbola
becomes xy = a2/2; i.e., an equilateral hyperbola represents an inverse proportionality dependence.
◮Focal and focus-directrix properties of a hyperbola. The segments joining a point
M(x, y) of the hyperbola with the foci F1(–c, 0) and F2(c, 0) are called the left and right
focal radii of this point. We denote the lengths of the left and right focal radii by r1 = |F1M|
and r2 = |F2M|, respectively (see Fig. M4.9 b). By the deﬁnition of a hyperbola,
|r1 – r2| = 2a,
where r1 and r2 satisfy the relations
r1 =

Fig. M4.9 b, where M = M0).
The tangent to a hyperbola at any point bisects the angles between the straight lines
joining this point with the foci. The tangent to a hyperbola at either of its vertices intersects
the asymptotes at two points such that the distance between them is equal to 2b.
◮Equations of a hyperbola in polar coordinates and parametric equations. In polar
coordinates (ρ, ϕ), with the pole coinciding with the right focus and the polar axis directed

where 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π, p = b2/a, and e =

◮Deﬁnition and the canonical equation of a parabola. A parabola is the locus of all
points in the plane equidistant from a given point F and a given straight line l, with F ∉l;
see Fig. M4.10 a. The point F is called the focus of the parabola and the straight line l is
its directrix.
Figure M4.10. Parabola (a). Tangent to a parabola (b). Optical property of a parabola (c).
Let us draw a straight line through the focus F and perpendicularly to the directrix
and denote the point at which this line crosses the directrix by C. Introduce the following
Cartesian coordinate system: take the above line to be the X-axis (directed from C to F),
the midpoint of the segment CF to be the origin O, and the perpendicular line through O
to be the Y -axis. In this coordinate system, the parabola is determined by the equation
y2 = 2px,
(M4.3.4.1)
where p = |FC| > 0. The number p is called focal parameter and equation (M4.3.4.1) is
called the canonical equation of the parabola.
A parabola consists of an inﬁnite branch symmetric about the X-axis. The point O(0, 0)
is called the vertex of the parabola. The directrix of the parabola is given by the equation
x = –p/2. The number p/2 is known as the focal distance. The segment joining a point
M(x, y) on the parabola with the focus F(p/2, 0) is called the focal radius of the point.
◮Focal properties of a parabola. If r denotes the length of the focal radius FM, then

The same relation holds for the angle between the tangent (M4.3.4.2) and the X-axis. This

off the parabola in the direction parallel to the parabola axis (see Fig. M4.10 c).
◮Equation of a parabola in polar coordinates and parametric equations. In polar
coordinates (ρ, ϕ), with the pole at the focus of the parabola and the polar axis directed

M4.3.5. Transformation of Quadratic Curves to Canonical Form
◮General equation of a quadratic curve. Translation and rotation. A set of points
in the plane whose coordinates in the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system satisfy the
general second-order algebraic equation
a11x2 + 2a12xy + a22y2 + 2a13x + 2a23y + a33 = 0
(M4.3.5.1)
is called a (bivariate) quadratic curve (or just quadratic); it is also known as a second-order
curve. If equation (M4.3.5.1) does not determine a real geometric object, this equation is
said to determine an imaginary quadratic curve.
Equation (M4.3.5.1) may be simpliﬁed using the following transformations of the Carte-
sian coordinate system:
1. Translation:
x = ¯x + x0,
y = ¯y + y0.
(M4.3.5.2)
It means that the origin O(0, 0) is transferred to the point ¯O(x0, y0) and the coordinate axes
are moved parallel to the original ones; ¯x and ¯y denote the new coordinates.
2. Rotation:
x = ˆx cos ϕ – ˆy sin ϕ,
y = ˆx sin ϕ + ˆy cos ϕ.
(M4.3.5.3)
The coordinate axes are rotated about the origin, which does not move, by the angle ϕ
counterclockwise; ˆx and ˆy denote the new coordinates.
◮Canonical equations of quadratic curves. The classiﬁcation table. With transfor-
mations (M4.3.5.2)–(M4.3.5.3), equation (M4.3.5.1) can be reduced to one of the nine
canonical forms classiﬁed in Table M4.1. The ﬁrst ﬁve curves, with δ ≠0, are nondegen-
erate (their canonical equations contain two quadratic terms proportional to x2 and y2).
The last four curves, with δ = 0, are degenerate (their canonical equations contain only one
quadratic term, x2 or y2). Curves 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9, with ∆= 0, split into straight lines; their
equations can be represented as the product of two factors linear in the coordinates, each
having the form (αnx + βny + γn), on the left-hand side and zero on the right-hand side.

If the coefﬁcients a13 and a23 are respectively proportional to α and β, i.e., a13 = kα and

The parameters k, γ, and q can be determined by comparing the coefﬁcients in equa-

M4.4.1. Vectors and Their Properties
◮Notion of a vector. A directed line segment connecting an initial point A and a terminal
point B (see Fig. M4.11) is called a vector and denoted −−→
AB. The nonnegative number
equal to the length of the segment AB is called the length (or magnitude) of the vector
−−→
AB and denoted |−−→
AB|. The vector −−→
BA is said to be opposite to the vector −−→
AB; it has the
same magnitude but opposite direction. Vectors are usually denoted by a single lowercase
letter, either with an arrow above (e.g., ⃗a) or without (e.g., a); the latter is the most common
notation for vectors, in which case a boldface lowercase letter is used.
A
B
Figure M4.11. Vector −→
AB.
Two vectors are said to be collinear (parallel) if they lie on the same straight line or
on parallel lines. Three vectors are said to be coplanar if they lie in the same plane or
in parallel planes. A vector 0 whose initial and terminal points coincide is called the zero
vector (or null vector); its length is zero (|0| = 0) and its direction is assumed to be arbitrary.
A vector e of length one is called a unit vector.
Two vectors are called equal is they are collinear and have the same magnitude and
direction. It follows that, for any vector a and any point A, there exists a unique vector −−→
AB
with its start point at A that is equal to a. For this reason, vectors in analytical geometry are
deﬁned up to their position, so that all vectors obtained from each other by parallel transport
are considered to be the same.
◮Sum and difference of vectors. The sum a + b of vectors a and b is deﬁned as the
vector directed from the initial point of a to the terminal point of b where the start of b is
placed at the tip of a. This method of the addition of vectors is called the triangle rule (see
Fig. M4.12 a). The sum a + b can also be found using the parallelogram rule as shown in
Fig. M4.12 b. The difference a – b of vectors a and b is deﬁned as the vector that must be
added to b to get a: b + (a – b) = a (see Fig. M4.12 c).

The product λa of a vector a by a number λ is deﬁned as the vector whose magnitude
is equal to |λa| = |λ||a| and direction coincides with that of a if λ > 0 or is opposite to it if
λ < 0.
Remark. If a = 0 or λ = 0, then the resulting product is the zero vector. In this case, the direction of the
product λa is undetermined.

◮Main properties of operations with vectors.
1. a + b = b + a (commutativity).
2. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c (associativity of addition).
3. a + 0 = a (existence of zero vector).
4. a + (–a) = 0 (existence of opposite vector).
5. λ(a + b) = λa + λb (distributivity with respect to addition of vectors).
6. (λ + µ)a = λa + µa (distributivity with respect to addition of constants).
7. λ(µa) = (λµ)a (associativity of product).
8. 1a = a (multiplication by unity).
M4.4.2. Coordinate Systems
◮Cartesian coordinate system.
Some useful formulas.
A rectangular Cartesian
coordinate system (also called just rectangular coordinate system or Cartesian coordinate
system) is deﬁned by three pairwise perpendicular directed straight lines OX, OY , and OZ
(the coordinate axes) concurrent at a single point O (the origin).
Figure M4.13. A point in a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.
For an arbitrary point M in space, let us draw through it three planes parallel to the
planes OY Z, OXZ, and OXY . These planes will intersect the coordinate axes OX,
OY , and OZ at three points. Denote by x0, y0, and z0 the distances from these points
to the origin O (see Fig. M4.13). The numbers x0, y0, and z0 are, respectively, called
the x-coordinate (or abscissa), the y-coordinate (or ordinate), and the z-coordinate of the
point M. One usually uses the notation M(x0, y0, z0) to specify that the point M has the
coordinates (x0, y0, z0).
Planes parallel to the coordinate planes are coordinate surfaces on which one of the
coordinates is constant. Straight lines parallel to the coordinate axes are coordinate lines
along which only one coordinate varies and the other two remain constant. Coordinate
surfaces meet at coordinate lines.
Each point M in three-dimensional space uniquely deﬁnes a vector −−→
OM, which is called
the position vector of the point M. The coordinates of the position vector coincide with
those of M and one usually writes r = −−→
OM = (x0, y0, z0).
The distance between two points, M1(x1, y1, z1) and M2(x2, y2, z2), is given by the
formula
d =
q
(x2 – x1)2 + (y2 – y1)2 + (z2 – z1)2 = |r2 – r1|,
(M4.4.2.1)
where r2 = −−→
OM2 and r1 = −−→
OM1 are the position vectors of the points M1 and M2,
respectively (see Fig. M4.14).
Any triple of numbers (x, y, z) can be identiﬁed with a point P and a position vector −−→
OP,
whose coordinates are these numbers. An arbitrary vector (x, y, z) can be represented as
(x, y, z) = xi + yj + zk,

Two vectors r1 = (x1, y1, z1) and r2 = (x2, y2, z2) are equal to each other if and only if
the relations
x1 = x2,
y1 = y2,
z1 = z2
hold simultaneously. The coordinates of the sum or difference of vectors and the product
of a vector by a scalar are calculated as
(x1, y1, z1) ± (x2, y2, z2) = (x1 ± x2, y1 ± y2, z1 ± z2),
α (x, y, z) = (αx, αy, αz).
If a point M divides a directed segment −−−−→
M1M2 in a ratio λ, then the coordinates of this
point are given by
x = x1 + λx2

y = y1 + λy2

to λ = 1.
The angles α, β, and γ between −−−−→
M1M2 and the coordinate axes OX, OY , and OZ are
determined by
cos α = x2 – x1
|r2 – r1| ,
cos β = y2 – y1
|r2 – r1| ,
cos γ = z2 – z1
|r2 – r1| ,
with
cos2 α + cos2 β + cos2 γ = 1.
The numbers cos α, cos β, and cos γ are called the direction cosines of the vector −−−−→
M1M2.
The angle ϕ between two vectors −−−−→
M1M2 and −−−−→
M3M4 deﬁned by the points M1(x1, y1, z1),
M2(x2, y2, z2), M3(x3, y3, z3), and M4(x4, y4, z4) can be found from

◮Cylindrical coordinates. Cylindrical coordinates are a generalization of polar coor-
dinates (see Subsection M4.1.1) that adds a third dimension. If a point M is speciﬁed by
its cylindrical coordinates, they are the polar coordinates ρ and ϕ of the projection of M
onto a base plane (usually OXY ) and the distance (usually z) of M from this base plane
(see Fig. M4.15 a). It is usually assumed that 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π (or –π ≤ϕ ≤π). For cylindrical
coordinates, the coordinate surfaces are planes z = const perpendicular to the axis OZ,
half-planes ϕ = const bounded by the axis OZ, and cylindrical surfaces ρ = const with
axis OZ.
Figure M4.15. Point in cylindrical (a) and spherical (b) coordinates.
Let M be an arbitrary point in space with its Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and cylindri-
cal coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z). The conversion formulas from Cartesian to cylindrical and from
cylindrical to Cartesian coordinates are as follows:
x = ρ cos ϕ,
ρ =
p
x2 + y2,
y = ρ sin ϕ,
tan ϕ = y/x,
z = z,
z = z,
where the polar angle ϕ is taken with regard to the quadrant in which the projection of the
point M onto the base plane lies.
◮Spherical coordinates. The spherical coordinates of a point M are deﬁned as the
length r = |−−→
OM| of its position vector, the azimuthal angle ϕ from the positive direction of
the axis OX to the projection of M onto the plane OXY , and the zenithal angle θ from
the positive direction of the axis OZ to M (see Fig. M4.15 b). It is usually assumed that
0 ≤ϕ ≤2π and 0 ≤θ ≤π (or –π ≤ϕ ≤π and 0 ≤θ ≤π). For spherical coordinates,
the coordinate surfaces are spheres r = const centered at the origin, half-planes ϕ = const
bounded by the axis OZ, and cones θ = const with vertex O and axis OZ.
The conversion formulas from the Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to the spherical coor-
dinates (r, ϕ, θ) and back are as follows:
x = r sin θ cos ϕ,
y = r sin θ sin ϕ,
z = r cos θ,
r =
p
x2 + y2 + z2,
tan ϕ = y/x,

where the angle ϕ is determined from the same considerations as in the case of cylindrical
coordinates.
M4.4.3. Scalar, Cross, and Scalar Triple Products of Vectors
◮Scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product (also known as the dot product) of
two vectors a and b, is deﬁned as the product of their magnitudes by the cosine of the angle
between the vectors (see Fig. M4.16),
a ⋅b = |a||b| cos ϕ.
It follows that a ⋅b > 0 if the angle between a and b is acute, a ⋅b < 0 if it is obtuse, and
a ⋅b = 0 if it is right.
Remark. The scalar product of a vector a by a vector b is also denoted by (a ⋅b), (a, b), and ab.

Figure M4.16. Scalar product of two vectors.
Properties of the scalar product:
1. a ⋅b = b ⋅a (commutativity).
2. a ⋅(b + c) = a ⋅b + a ⋅c (distributivity with respect to addition of vectors). This property
holds for any number of summands.
3. If a and b are collinear, then a ⋅b = ±|a||b|. (The plus sign is taken if a and b have the
same direction, and the minus sign is taken if they have opposite directions.)
4. (λa) ⋅b = λ(a ⋅b) (associativity with respect to a scalar factor).
5. a ⋅a = |a|2. The scalar product a ⋅a is denoted by a2 (the scalar square of the vector a).
6. The magnitude of a vector is expressed via the scalar product as
|a| = √a ⋅a =
p
a2.
7. Two nonzero vectors a and b are perpendicular if and only if a ⋅b = 0.
8. The scalar products of the basis vectors are
i ⋅j = i ⋅k = j ⋅k = 0,
i ⋅i = j ⋅j = k ⋅k = 1.
9. If vectors are given by their coordinates, a = (ax, ay, az) and b = (bx, by, bz), then
a ⋅b = (axi + ayj + azk)(bxi + byj + bzk) = axbx + ayby + azbz.
10. The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality
|a ⋅b| ≤|a||b|.
11. The Minkowski inequality
|a + b| ≤|a| + |b|.

◮Cross product of two vectors. The cross product of a vector a by a vector b is deﬁned
as the vector c denoted by a × b (see Fig. M4.17), satisfying the following three conditions:
1. Its absolute value (magnitude) is equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the
vectors a and b; i.e.,
|c| = |a × b| = |a||b| sin ϕ.
2. It is perpendicular to the plane of the parallelogram; i.e., c ⊥a and c ⊥b.
3. The vectors a, b, and c form a right-handed trihedral; i.e., the vector c points to the side
from which the sense of the shortest rotation from a to b is counterclockwise.
Figure M4.17. Cross product of two vectors.
Remark. The cross product of a vector a by a vector b is also denoted by c = [a, b].
Properties of cross product:
1. a × b = –b × a (anticommutativity).
2. a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c (distributivity with respect to the addition of vectors). This
property holds for any number of summands.
3. Vectors a and b are collinear if and only if a × b = 0. In particular, a × a = 0.
4. (λa) × b = a × (λb) = λ(a × b) (associativity with respect to a scalar factor).
5. The cross products of basis vectors are
i × i = j × j = k × k = 0,
i × j = k,
j × k = i,
k × i = j.

◮Conditions for vectors to be parallel or perpendicular.
A vector a is collinear to a vector b if
b = λa
or
a × b = 0.

84
ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
A vector a is perpendicular to a vector b if
a ⋅b = 0.
Remark. In general, the condition a ⋅b = 0 implies that the vectors a and b are perpendicular or one of
them is the zero vector. The zero vector can be viewed to be perpendicular to any other vector.
◮Scalar triple product of three vectors. The scalar triple product of vectors a, b, and
c is deﬁned as the scalar product of a by the cross product of b and c:
[abc] = a ⋅(b × c).
Remark. The scalar triple product of three vectors a, b, and c is also denoted by abc.
Properties of scalar triple product:
1. [abc] = [bca] = [cab] = –[bac] = –[cba] = –[acb].
2. [aab] = [bab] = 0 or a ⋅(a × b) = b ⋅(a × b) = 0.
3. [(a + b)cd] = [acd] + [bcd] (distributivity with respect to addition of vectors). This
property holds for any number of summands.
4. [λabc] = λ[abc] (associativity with respect to a scalar factor).
5. If the vectors are given by their coordinates a = (ax, ay, az), b = (bx, by, bz), and
c = (cx, cy, cz), then
[abc] =

ax
ay
az
bx

 .
6. The scalar triple product [abc] is equal to the volume V of the parallelepiped spanned by
the vectors a, b, and c taken with the sign + if the vectors a, b, and c form a right-handed
trihedral and the sign – if the vectors form a left-handed trihedral,
[abc] = ±V .
7. Three nonzero vectors a, b, and c are coplanar if and only if [abc] = 0. In this case,
the vectors a, b, and c are linearly dependent; they satisfy a relation of the form
αa + βb + γc = 0.
M4.5. Line and Plane in Space
M4.5.1. Plane in Space
◮General equation of a plane. In a Cartesian coordinate system, a plane is given by a
ﬁrst-order algebraic equation.
The general (complete) equation of a plane has the form
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0,
(M4.5.1.1)
where A2 + B2 + C2 ≠0.
1. For D = 0, the equation deﬁnes a plane passing through the origin.
2. For A = 0 (respectively, B = 0 or C = 0), the equation deﬁnes a plane parallel to the
axis OX (respectively, OY or OZ).
3. For A = D = 0 (respectively, B = D = 0 or C = D = 0), the equation deﬁnes a plane
passing through the axis OX (respectively, OY or OZ).
4. For A = B = 0 (respectively, A = C = 0 or B = C = 0), the equation deﬁnes a plane
parallel to the plane OXY (respectively, OXZ or OY Z).

M4.5. LINE AND PLANE IN SPACE
85
◮Intercept equation of a plane. A plane Ax+By +Cz +D = 0 that is not parallel to the
axis OX (i.e., A ≠0) meets this axis at a (signed) distance a = –D/A from the origin (see
Fig. M4.18). The number a is called the x-intercept of the plane. Similarly, one deﬁnes the
y-intercepts b = –D/B (for B ≠0) and the z-intercept c = –D/C (for C ≠0). Then such a
plane can be deﬁned by the equation
x
a + y
b + z
c = 1,
which is called the intercept equation of the plane.
Figure M4.18. A plane with intercept equation.
Remark. A plane parallel to the axis OX but nonparallel to the other two axes is deﬁned by the equa-
tion y/b + z/c = 1, where b and c are the y- and z-intercepts of the plane. A plane simultaneously parallel to
the axes OX and OY can be represented in the form z/c = 1.
◮Equation of the plane passing through a point M0 and perpendicular to a vector N.
The equation of the plane passing through a point M0(x0, y0, z0) and perpendicular to a
vector N = (A, B, C) has the form
A(x – x0) + B(y – y0) + C(z – z0) = 0,
or
(r – r0) ⋅N = 0,
(M4.5.1.2)
where r and r0 are the position vectors of the points M(x, y, z) and M0(x0, y0, z0), re-

◮Parametric equations of a straight line. The parametric equations of the line that

or

(M4.5.2.1)
where r = −−→

OM1. As the parameter t varies from –∞to +∞, the point M with
position vector r = (x, y, z) determined by formula (M4.5.2.1) runs over the entire straight
line in question. It is convenient to use parametric equations (M4.5.2.1) if one needs to ﬁnd
the point of intersection of a straight line with a plane.
Figure M4.24. Straight line passing through a point and parallel to a direction vector.
The numbers l, m, and n characterize the direction of the straight line in space; they are
called the direction coefﬁcients of the straight line. For a unit vector R = R0, the coefﬁcients
l, m, n are the cosines of the angles α, β, and γ formed by this straight line (the direction
vector R0) with the coordinate axes OX, OY , and OZ. These cosines can be expressed
via the coordinates of the direction vector R as

ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
Remark 1. One can obtain canonical equations (M4.5.2.2) from parametric equations (M4.5.2.1) by
eliminating the parameter t.
Remark 2. In the canonical equations, all coefﬁcients l, m, and n cannot be zero simultaneously, since
|R| ≠0. But some of them may be zero. If one of the denominators in equations (M4.5.2.2) is zero, this means
that the corresponding numerator is also zero.
◮General equation of a straight line. The general equation of a straight line in space
deﬁnes it as the line of intersection of two planes (see Fig. M4.25) and is given analytically
by a system of two linear equations
A1x + B1y + C1z + D1 = 0,
A2x + B2y + C2z + D2 = 0.
(M4.5.2.3)
The normals to the planes are N1 = (A1, B1, C1) and N2 = (A2, B2, C2). The direction
vector R is equal to the cross product of the normals N1 and N2; i.e.,
R = N1 × N2,
(M4.5.2.4)
and its coordinates l, m, and n can be obtained by the formulas

Remark 1. Simultaneous equations of the form (M4.5.2.3) deﬁne a straight line if and only if the coefﬁ-
cients A1, B1, and C1 in one of them are not proportional to the respective coefﬁcients A2, B2, and C2 in the
other.
Remark 2. For D1 = D2 = 0 (and only in this case), the line passes through the origin.

Example. Let us reduce the equation of the straight line
x + 2y – z + 1 = 0,
x – y + z + 3 = 0
to canonical form.
We choose one of the coordinates arbitrarily; say, x = 0. Then
2y – z + 1 = 0,
–y + z + 3 = 0,
and hence y = –4, z = –7. Thus the desired line contains the point M(0, –4, –7). We ﬁnd the cross product of the
vectors N1 = (1, 2, –1) and N2 = (1, –1, 1) and, according to (M4.5.2.4), obtain the direction vector R = (1, –2, –3)

◮Central surfaces. A segment joining two points of a surface is called a chord. If there
exists a point in space, not necessarily lying on the surface, that bisects all chords passing
through it, then the surface is said to be central and the point is called the center of the
surface.
The equations listed below for central surfaces are given in canonical form; i.e., the
center of a surface is at the origin, and the surface symmetry axes are the coordinate axes.
Moreover, the coordinate planes are symmetry planes.

where the numbers a, b, and c are the lengths of the segments called the semiaxes of
the ellipsoid (see Fig. M4.31 a). The coordinates of all points of the ellipsoid satisfy the
inequalities –a ≤x ≤a, –b ≤y ≤b, and –c ≤z ≤c.
Figure M4.31. Triaxial ellipsoid (a) and spheroid (b).
If a ≠b ≠c, then the ellipsoid is said to be triaxial, or scalene. If a = b ≠c, then the
ellipsoid is called a spheroid; it can be obtained by rotating the ellipse x2/a2 + z2/c2 = 1,
y = 0 lying in the plane OXZ about the axis OZ (see Fig. M4.31 b). If a = b > c, then the
ellipsoid is an oblate spheroid, and if a = b < c, then the ellipsoid is a prolate spheroid. If
a = b = c, then the ellipsoid is the sphere of radius a given by the equation x2 + y2 + z2 = a2.
An arbitrary plane section of an ellipsoid is an ellipse (or, in a special case, a circle).
The volume of an ellipsoid is equal to V = 4

where c is the real semiaxis and a and b are the imaginary semiaxes (see Fig. M4.32 b). A

A hyperboloid approaches the surface

which is called an asymptotic cone, inﬁnitely closely.
A plane passing through the axis OZ intersects each of the hyperboloids (M4.6.1.2) and
(M4.6.1.3) in two hyperbolas and the asymptotic cone in two straight lines, which are the
asymptotes of these hyperbolas. The section of a hyperboloid by a plane parallel to OXY
is an ellipse. The section of a one-sheeted hyperboloid by the plane z = 0 is an ellipse,
which is called the gorge or throat ellipse.
For a = b, we deal with the hyperboloid of revolution obtained by rotating a hyperbola
with semiaxes a and c about its focal axis 2c (which is an imaginary axis for a one-sheeted
hyperboloid and a real axis for a two-sheeted hyperboloid). If a = b = c, then the hyperboloid
of revolution is said to be right, and its sections by the planes OXZ and OY Z are equilateral
hyperbolas.
◮Cone. A cone is a central surface deﬁned by the equation

b2 – z2
c2 = 0.
(M4.6.1.4)
The cone (see Fig. M4.33) deﬁned by (M4.6.1.4) has vertex at the origin, and for its base we
can take the ellipse with semiaxes a and b in the plane perpendicular to the axis OZ at the
distance c from the origin. This cone is the asymptotic cone for the hyperboloids (M4.6.1.2)
and (M4.6.1.3). For a = b, we obtain a right circular cone.
Remark. About the cone, see also Subsection M3.2.3.
◮Paraboloids. In contrast to the surfaces considered above, paraboloids are not central
surfaces. For the equations listed below, the vertex of a paraboloid lies at the origin, the
axis OZ is the symmetry axis, and the planes OXZ and OY Z are symmetry planes.

The sections of an elliptic paraboloid by planes parallel to the axis OZ are parabolas,

paraboloid of revolution, which is obtained by rotating the parabola 2pz = x2 lying in the
plane OXZ about its axis.
The volume of the part of an elliptic paraboloid cut by the plane perpendicular to its
axis at a height h is equal to V = 1
2 πabh, i.e., half the volume of the elliptic cylinder with
the same base and altitude.

M4.6.2. Quadrics (General Theory)
◮General equation of a quadric. Translation and rotation. A quadric is a set of points
inthree-dimensional space whose coordinates intherectangular Cartesian coordinate system
satisfy a second-order algebraic equation
a11x2+a22y2+a33z2+2a12xy+2a13xz+2a23yz+2a14x+2a24y+2a34z+a44 =0, (M4.6.2.1)
or
(a11x + a12y + a13z + a14)x + (a21x + a22y + a23z + a24)y
+ (a31x + a32y + a33z + a34)z + a41x + a42y + a43z + a44 = 0,
with symmetric coefﬁcients, aij = aji (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4); the factors 2 appearing in some
terms are introduced for further convenience. If equation (M4.6.2.1) does not deﬁne a real
geometric object, then one says that this equation deﬁnes an imaginary quadric.
Equation (M4.6.2.1) can be simpliﬁed using the transformations of translation and
rotation.
1. Translation:
x = ¯x + x0,
y = ¯y + y0,
z = ¯z + z0.
(M4.6.2.2)
This transformation means that the origin O(0, 0, 0) is translated to the point ¯O(x0, y0, z0)
with the new axes of coordinates remaining parallel to the original ones; ¯x, ¯y, and ¯z are the
new coordinates.
2. Rotation:
x = e11 ˆx + e12 ˆy + e13ˆz,
y = e21 ˆx + e22 ˆy + e23ˆz,
z = e31 ˆx + e32 ˆy + e33ˆz.
(M4.6.2.3)
This transformation means that all points are rotated about the origin O, with e11, e21, e31
beingthe direction cosines of the axisO bX, e12, e22, e32 those of the axis ObY , ande13, e23, e33
those of the axis ObZ in the initial coordinate system OXY Z.
◮Classiﬁcation of quadrics. With successive application of transformations (M4.6.2.2)–
(M4.6.2.3), equation (M4.6.2.1) can be reduced to one of the following 17 canonical forms,
each of which is associated with a certain class of quadrics (see Table M4.2). The ﬁrst six
surfaces, with δ ≠0, are nondegenerate; their canonical equations contain three quadratic
terms proportional to x2, y2, and z2. The other surfaces, 7–17, with δ = 0, are degenerate;
their canonical equations contain only two (proportional to x2 and y2) or even one (x2)
quadratic term. The last ﬁve surfaces, 13–17, disintegrate into planes (real or imaginary);
their equations can be represented as the product of two factors linear in coordinates on the
left-hand side and zero on the right-hand side.

◮Characteristic quadratic form of a quadric. The characteristic quadratic form

The roots λ1, λ2, and λ3 of the characteristic equation (M4.6.2.8) are the eigenvalues of
the real symmetric matrix [aij] and hence are always real. The invariants S, T, and δ can
be expressed in terms of the roots λ1, λ2, and λ3 as follows:
S = λ1 + λ2 + λ3,
T = λ1λ2 + λ1λ3 + λ2λ3,
δ = λ1λ2λ3.

Chapter M5
Algebra
M5.1. Polynomials and Algebraic Equations
M5.1.1. Polynomials and Their Properties
◮Deﬁnition of a polynomial. A polynomial of degree n of a scalar variable x is an
expression of the form
f(x) ≡anxn + an–1xn–1 + · · · + a1x + a0
(an ≠0),
(M5.1.1.1)
where a0, . . . , an are real or complex numbers (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Polynomials of degree
zero are nonzero numbers.
Two polynomials are equal if they have the same coefﬁcients of like powers of the
variable.
◮Main operations over polynomials.
1◦. The sum (difference) of two polynomials f(x) of degree n and g(x) of degree m is the
polynomial of degree l ≤max{n, m} whose coefﬁcient of each power of x is equal to the
sum (difference) of the coefﬁcients of the same power of x in f(x) and g(x), i.e., if
g(x) ≡bmxm + bm–1xm–1 + · · · + b1x + b0,
(M5.1.1.2)
then the sum (difference) of polynomials (M5.1.1.1) and (M5.1.1.2) is
f(x) ± g(x) = clxl + cl–1xl–1 + · · · + c1x + c0,
where
ck = ak ± bk
(k = 0, 1, . . . , l).
If n > m then bm+1 = · · · = bn = 0; if n < m then an+1 = · · · = am = 0.
2◦. To multiply a polynomial f(x) of degree n by a polynomial g(x) of degree m, one
should multiply each term in f(x) by each term in g(x), add the products, and collect
similar terms. The degree of the resulting polynomial is n+m. The product of polynomials
(M5.1.1.1) and (M5.1.1.2) is
f(x)g(x) = cn+mxn+m + cn+m–1xn+m–1 + · · · + c1x + c0,
ck =
i+j=k
X
i,j=0
aibj,
where k = 0, 1, . . . , n + m.
3◦. Each polynomial f(x) of degree n can be divided by any other polynomial p(x) of
degree m (p(x) ≠0) with remainder, i.e., uniquely represented in the form f(x) = p(x)q(x)+
r(x), where q(x) is a polynomial of degree n – m (for m ≤n) or q(x) = 0 (for m > n),
referred to as the quotient, and r(x) is a polynomial of degree l < m or r(x) = 0, referred to
as the remainder.
If r(x) = 0, then f(x) is said to be divisible by p(x) (without remainder).
If m > n, then q(x) = 0 and r(x) ≡f(x).
103

104
ALGEBRA
◮Methods for ﬁnding quotient and remainder.
1◦. Horner’s scheme. To divide a polynomial f(x) of degree n (see (M5.1.1.1)) by the
polynomial p(x) = x – b, one uses Horner’s scheme: the coefﬁcients of f(x) are written out
in a row, starting from an; b is written on the left; then one writes the number an under an,
the number anb + an–1 = bn–1 under an–1, the number bn–1b + an–2 = bn–2 under an–2, . . . ,
the number b1b + a0 = b0 under a0. The number b0 is the remainder in the division of f(x)
by p(x), and an, bn–1, . . . , b1 are the coefﬁcients of the quotient.
Remark. To divide f(x) by p(x) = ax + b (a ≠0) with remainder, one ﬁrst uses Horner’s scheme to divide
by p1(x) = x – (– b
a ); now if q1(x) and r1 are the quotient and remainder in the division of f(x) by p1(x), then
q(x) =
1
a q1(x) and r = r1 are the quotient and remainder in the division of f(x) by p(x).
Example 1. Let us divide f(x) = x3 – 2x2 – 10x + 3 by p(x) = 2x + 5.
We use Horner’s scheme to divide f(x) by p1(x) = x + 5/2:
1
–2
–10
3
– 5
2
1 – 9

Thus f(x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x), where

POLYNOMIAL REMAINDER THEOREM. The remainder in the division of a polynomial
f(x) by the polynomial p(x) = x –b is the number equal to the value of the polynomial f(x)
at x = b.
2◦. Long division. To divide a polynomial f(x) of degree n by a polynomial p(x) of degree
m ≤n, one can use long division.
Example 2. Let us divide f(x) = x3 + 8x2 + 14x – 5 by p(x) = x2 + 3x – 1.
We use long division:
x3 + 8x2 + 14x – 5 x2 + 3x – 1
– x3 + 3x2
– x
x + 5
5x2 + 15x – 5
–
5x2 + 15x – 5
0
Thus f(x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x), where q(x) = x + 5 and r(x) = 0; i.e., f(x) is divisible by p(x).
Example 3. Let us divide f(x) = x3 – 4x2 + x + 1 by p(x) = x2 + 1.
We use long division:
x3 – 4x2 + x + 1 x2 + 1
–x3
+ x
x – 4
– 4x2
+ 1
– – 4x2
– 4
5
Thus f(x) = p(x)q(x) + r(x), where q(x) = x – 4 and r(x) = 5.
◮Expansion of polynomials in powers of a linear binomial. For each polynomial f(x)
given by equation (M5.1.1.1) and any number c, one can write out the expansion of f(x) in
powers of x – c:
f(x) = bn(x – c)n + bn–1(x – c)n–1 + · · · + b1(x – c) + b0.
To ﬁnd the coefﬁcients b0, . . . , bn of this expansion, one ﬁrst divides f(x) by x – c with
remainder. The remainder isb0, andthe quotient is some polynomial g0(x). Thenone divides

M5.1. POLYNOMIALS AND ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
105
g0(x) by x – c with remainder. The remainder is b1, and the quotient is some polynomial
g1(x). Then one divides g1(x) by x – c, obtaining the coefﬁcient b2 as the remainder, etc. It
is convenient to perform the computations by Horner’s scheme (see above).
The coefﬁcients in the expansion of a polynomial f(x) in powers of the difference x – c
are related to the values of the polynomial and its derivatives at x = c by the formulas
b0 = f(c),
b1 = f ′

(M5.1.5.1)
where ak are real or complex coefﬁcients.
Denote the polynomial of degree n on the
left-hand side in equation (M5.1.5.1) by
Pn(x) ≡anxn + an–1xn–1 + · · · + a1x + a0
(an ≠0).
(M5.1.5.2)
A value x = x1 such that Pn(x1) = 0 is called a root of equation (M5.1.5.1) (and
also a root of the polynomial Pn(x)). A value x = x1 is called a root of multiplicity m if
Pn(x) = (x–x1)mQn–m(x), where m is an integer (1 ≤m ≤n), and Qn–m(x) is a polynomial
of degree n – m such that Qn–m(x1) ≠0.
THEOREM 1 (FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA). Any algebraic equation of degree
n has exactly n roots (real or complex), each root counted according to its multiplicity.
Thus, the left-hand side of equation (M5.1.5.1) with roots x1, x2, . . . , xs of the respective
multiplicities k1, k2, . . . , ks (k1 + k2 + · · · + ks = n) can be factorized as follows:
Pn(x) = an(x – x1)k1(x – x2)k2 . . . (x – xs)ks.
THEOREM 2. Any algebraic equation of an odd degree with real coefﬁcients has at least
one real root.
THEOREM 3. Suppose that equation (M5.1.5.1) with real coefﬁcients has a complex
root x1 = α + iβ. Then this equation has the complex conjugate root x2 = α – iβ, and the
roots x1, x2 have the same multiplicity.
THEOREM 4. Any rational root of equation (M5.1.5.1) with integer coefﬁcients ak is an
irreducible fraction of the form p/q, where p is a divisor of a0 and q is a divisor of an. If
an = 1, then all rational roots of equation (M5.1.5.1) (if they exist) are integer divisors of
the free term.
THEOREM 5 (ABEL–RUFFINI THEOREM). Any equation (M5.1.5.1) of degree n ≤4 is
solvable by radicals, i.e., its roots can be expressed via its coefﬁcients by the operations of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots (see Subsections M5.1.2–

N = 1 + A
|an| ,
(M5.1.5.3)
where A is the largest of |a0|, |a1|, . . . , |an–1|.
The last result admits the following generalization: all roots of equation (M5.1.5.1) in
absolute value do not exceed
N1 = ρ + A1

Example 2. Consider the following equation of degree 4:
P4(x) = 9x4 – 9x2 – 36x + 1.
Formula (M5.1.5.3) for n = 4, |an| = 9, A = 36 yields a fairly rough estimate N = 5, i.e., the roots of the
equation belong to the interval [–5, 5]. Formula (M5.1.5.4) for ρ = 2, n = 4, |an| = 9, A1 = 9 yields a better
estimate for the bounds of the roots of this polynomial, N1 = 3.
2◦. A constant K is called an upper bound for the real roots of equation (M5.1.5.1) or the
polynomial Pn(x) if equation (M5.1.5.1) has no real roots greater than or equal to K; in a
similar way, one deﬁnes a lower and an upper bound for positive and negative roots of an
equation or the corresponding polynomial.
Let
K1 be an upper bound for the positive roots of the polynomial Pn(x),
K2 be an upper bound for the positive roots of the polynomial Pn(–x),
K3 > 0 be an upper bound for the positive roots of the polynomial xnPn(1/x),
K4 > 0 be an upper bound for the positive roots of the polynomial xnPn(–1/x).
Then all nonzero real roots of the polynomial Pn(x) (if they exist) belong to the intervals
(–K2, –1/K4) and (1/K3, K1).
Next, we describe three methods for ﬁnding upper bounds for positive roots of a
polynomial.
Maclaurin method. Suppose that the ﬁrst m leading coefﬁcients of the polynomial
(M5.1.5.2) are nonnegative, i.e., an > 0, an–1 ≥0, . . . , an–m+1 ≥0, and the next coefﬁcient
is negative, an–m < 0. Then
K = 1 +
 B
an
1/m
(M5.1.5.5)
is an upper bound for the positive roots of this polynomial, where B is the largest of the
absolute values of negative coefﬁcients of Pn(x).
Example 3. Consider the fourth-degree equation from Example 2. In this case, m = 2, B = 36 and
formula (M5.1.5.5) yields K =K1 =1+(36/9)1/2 =3. Now, consider the polynomial P4(–x)=9x4–9x2+36x+1.
Its positive roots has the upper bound K2 = 1+(9/9)1/2 = 2. For the polynomial x4P4(1/x) = x4–36x3 –9x2 +9,
we have m = 1, K3 = 1+36 = 37. Finally, for the polynomial x4P4(–1/x) = x4 +36x3 –9x2 +9, we have m = 2,
k4 = 1 + 91/2 = 4. Thus if P4(x) has real roots, they must belong to the intervals (–2, –1/4) and (1/37, 3).
Newton method. Suppose that the polynomial Pn(x) and all its derivatives P ′
n(x), . . . ,
P (n)
n (x) take positive values for x = c. Then c is an upper bound for the positive roots
of Pn(x).
Example 4. Consider the polynomial from Example 2 and calculate the derivatives
P4(x) = 9x4 – 9x2 – 36x + 1, P ′
4(x) = 36x3 – 18x – 36, P ′′
4 (x) = 108x2 – 18, P ′′′
4 (x) = 216x, P ′′′′
4
(x) = 216.
It is easy to check that for x = 2 this polynomial and all its derivatives take positive values, and therefore c = 2
is an upper bound for its positive roots.
◮Theorems on the number of real roots of polynomials. The number of all negative
roots of a polynomial Pn(x) is equal to the number of all positive roots of the polynomial
Pn(–x).
1◦. The exact number of positive roots of a polynomial whose coefﬁcients form a sequence
that does not change sign or changes sign only once can be found with the help of the
Descartes theorem (rule of signs).
DESCARTES THEOREM. The number of positive roots (counted considering their multi-
plicity) of a polynomial Pn(x) with real coefﬁcients is either equal to the number of sign
alterations between consecutive nonzero coefﬁcients or is less than it by a multiple of 2.
Applying the Descartes theorem to Pn(–x), we obtain a similar theorem for the negative
roots of the polynomial Pn(x).

112
ALGEBRA
Example 5. Consider the cubic polynomial
P3(x) = x3 – 3x + a2
(a ≠0).
Its coefﬁcients have the signs + – +, and therefore we have two alterations of sign. Therefore, the number of
positive roots of P3(x) is equal either to 2 or to 0. Now, consider the polynomial P3(–x) = –x3 + 3x + a2. The
sequence of its coefﬁcients changes sign only once. Therefore, the original equation has one negative root.
2◦. A stronger version of the Descartes theorem. Suppose that all roots of a polynomial
Pn(x) are real∗; then the number of positive roots of Pn(x) is equal to the number of sign
alterations in the sequence of its coefﬁcients, and the number of its negative roots is equal
to the number of sign alterations in the sequence of coefﬁcients of the polynomial Pn(–x).
Example 6. Consider the characteristic polynomial of the symmetric matrix
P3(x) =

–2 – x
1
1
1
1 – x
3
1
3
1 – x
 = –x3 + 14x + 20,
which has only real roots. The sequence of its coefﬁcients changes sign only once, and therefore it has a single
positive root. The number of its negative roots is equal to two, since this polynomial has three nonzero real
roots and only one of them can be positive.
3◦. If two neighboring coefﬁcients of a polynomial Pn(x) are equal to zero, then the roots
of the polynomial cannot be all real (in this case, the stronger version of the Descartes
theorem cannot be used).
4◦. The number of real roots of a polynomial Pn(x) greater than a ﬁxed c is either equal to
the number of sign alterations in the sequence Pn(c), . . . , P (n)
n (c) or is by an even number
less. If all roots of Pn(x) are real, then the number of its roots greater than c coincides with
the number of sign alterations in the sequence Pn(c), . . . , P (n)
n (c).
Example 7. Consider the polynomial
P4(x) = x4 – 3x3 + 2x2 – 2a2x + a2.
For x = 1, we have P4(1) = –a2, P ′
4(1) = –1 – 2a2, P ′′
4 (1) = –2, P ′′′
4 (1) = 6, P ′′′′
4
(1) = 24. Thus, there is a single
sign alteration, and therefore the polynomial has a single real root greater than unity.

(M5.2.1.1)
The numbers aij are elements of the determinant ∆.
The determinant (M5.2.1.1) is calculated using the formulas
∆= ai1Ai1 + ai2Ai2 + · · · + ainAin
= a1jA1j + a2jA2j + · · · + anjAnj
(M5.2.1.2)
for any ith row and jth column. Here, Aij is the cofactor of the element aij, which is
deﬁned as Aij = (–1)i+jMij, where Mij is the minor corresponding to aij. The minor Mij
is deﬁned as the (n–1)st-order determinant of size (n–1)×(n–1) obtained from the original
determinant by removing the ith row and the jth column (i.e., the row and the column that
intersect at aij). It follows from (M5.2.1.2) that the calculation of an nth-order determinant
is reduced to the calculation of n determinants of order n – 1.
The ﬁrst formula in (M5.2.1.2) is called the cofactor expansion of the determinant along
row i and the other one is called the cofactor expansion of the determinant along column j.
◮Properties of determinants.
1. If a determinant contains a row (column) consisting of all zeroes, then this determinant
is equal to zero.
2. If a determinant has two proportional rows (columns), then the determinant is zero.
3. If a determinant has a row (column) that is a linear combination of its other rows
(columns), then the determinant is zero.
4. If two rows (columns) are interchanged, the determinant changes its sign.
5. If each element of a row (column) is divisible by a common number, this number can
be factored out of the determinant.
6. The determinant does not change if a linear combination of some of its rows (columns)
is added to another row (column).
Remark. The determinant is equal to zero if and only if its rows (columns) are linearly dependent.

M5.2.2. Matrices. Types of Matrices. Operations with Matrices
◮Deﬁnition of a matrix. Types of matrices. A matrix of size (or dimension) m × n is
a rectangular table with entries aij (i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n) arranged in m rows
and n columns:
A ≡

.
(M5.2.2.1)
Note that, for each entry aij, the index i refers to the ith row and the index j to the jth
column. Matrices are brieﬂy denoted by uppercase letters (for instance, A, as here), or by
the symbol [aij], sometimes with more details: A ≡[aij] (i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n).
The numbers m and n are called the dimensions of the matrix.
The null or zero matrix is a matrix whose entries are all equal to zero: aij = 0 (i =
1, 2, . . . , m, j = 1, 2, . . . , n).
A column vector or column is a matrix of size m × 1. A row vector or row is a matrix
of size 1 × n. Both column and row vectors are often simply called vectors.
A square matrix is a matrix of size n × n, and n is called the dimension of this square
matrix. The main diagonal of a square matrix is its diagonal from the top left corner to the
bottom right corner with the entries a11 a22 . . . ann. Table M5.2 lists the main types of
square matrices.
◮Basic operations with matrices. Two matrices are equal if they are of the same size
and their respective entries are equal.
The sum of two matrices A ≡[aij] and B ≡[bij] of the same size m × n is the matrix
C ≡[cij] of size m × n with the entries
cij = aij + bij.

THEOREM (DECOMPOSITION OF MATRICES). For any square matrix A, the matrix S1 =
1
2 (A + AT ) is symmetric and the matrix S2 = 1
2 (A – AT ) is skew-symmetric. The represen-
tation of A as the sum of symmetric and skew-symmetric matrices is unique: A = S1 + S2.
A square matrix A is said to be orthogonal if AT A = AAT = I, i.e., AT = A–1, where
A–1 is the inverse of A (see Subsection M5.2.3).
Properties of orthogonal matrices:
1. If A is an orthogonal matrix, then AT is also orthogonal.
2. The product of two orthogonal matrices is an orthogonal matrix.
3. Any symmetric orthogonal matrix is involutive, i.e., AA = I.
The complex conjugate of a matrix A ≡[aij] of size m × n is the matrix C ≡[cij] of
size m × n with entries
cij = ¯aij
(i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n),
where ¯aij is the complex conjugate of aij.
The complex conjugate matrix is denoted
by C = A.
The adjoint matrix of a matrix A ≡[aij] of size m × n is the matrix C ≡[cij] of size
n × m with entries
cij = ¯aji
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n; j = 1, 2, . . . , m).
The adjoint matrix is denoted by C = A∗.
Properties of adjoint matrices:
(A + B)∗= A∗+ B∗,
(λA)∗= ¯λA∗,
(A∗)∗= A,
(AC)∗= C∗A∗,
O∗= O1,
I∗= I,
where λ is a scalar; matrices A, B, and zero matrix O have size m × n; matrix C has size
n × l; zero matrix O1 has size n × m.
Remark. If a matrix is real (i.e., all its entries are real), then the corresponding transpose and the adjoint
matrix coincide.
A square matrix A is said to be normal if A∗A = AA∗. A normal matrix A is said
to be unitary if A∗A = AA∗= I, i.e., A∗= A–1, where A–1 is the inverse of A (see
Subsection M5.2.3).
◮Trace of a matrix. The trace of a square matrix A ≡[aij] of size n × n is the sum of
its diagonal entries,
Tr(A) =
n
X
i=1
aii.
If λ is a scalar and square matrices A and B have the same size, then
Tr(A + B) = Tr(A) + Tr(B),
Tr(λA) = λTr(A),
Tr(AB) = Tr(BA),
◮Minors. Rank and defect of a matrix. In a square or rectangular matrix, let us select
k arbitrary rows and k arbitrary columns to make up a square submatrix. The kth-order
determinant formed by the entries where the selected rows and columns intersect is called
a kth-order minor of the matrix.

118
ALGEBRA
The rank of a matrix A is the maximum order of nonzero minors of A. The rank of a
matrix A is denoted rank(A). If all entries of a matrix are zero, the rank of the matrix is
taken to be zero.
Properties of the rank of a matrix:
1. The rank of a matrix does not change if: a row (column) whose entries are all zero
is deleted; some rows (columns) are interchanged; a row (column) is multiplied by a
nonzero number; the entries of one row (column) multiplied by any number are added to
the respective entries of another row (column); and the rows are substituted by columns
while the columns are substituted by the respective rows (for square matrices).
Example 3. Find the rank of the matrix A =
 1
2
3
6
2
3

.
Subtract the sum of the ﬁrst three columns from column 4 and then delete the resulting column, whose
entries are now all zero, to obtain the matrix A1 =
 1
2
3

!
, which has the same rank as A. Since
det(A1) = –18 ≠0, we have rank(A1) = 3, and hence rank(A) = 3.
2. For any matrices A and B of the same size the following inequality holds:
rank(A + B) ≤rank(A) + rank(B).
3. For a matrix A of size m × n and a matrix B of size n × k, the Sylvester inequalities
hold:
rank(A) + rank(B) – n ≤rank(AB) ≤min{rank(A), rank(B)}.
For a square matrix A of size n × n, the value d = n – rank(A) is called the defect of the
matrix A, and A is called a d-fold degenerate matrix. The rank of a nondegenerate square
matrix A ≡[aij] of size n × n is equal to n.
4. Let r be the rank of a matrix; basic minor of this matrix is its nonzero minor of the order
r. Basic rows (columns) of the matrix are the rows (columns) forming the basic minor.
THEOREM ON BASIC MINOR.
Basic rows (resp., basic columns) of a matrix are linearly
independent. Any row (resp., any column) of a matrix is a linear combination of its basic
rows (resp., columns).
◮Linear dependence of row vectors (column vectors). A row vector (column vector)
B is a linear combination of row vectors (column vectors) A1, . . . , Ak if there exist scalars
α1, . . . , αk such that
B = α1A1 + · · · + αkAk.
Row vectors (column vectors) A1, . . . , Ak are said to be linearly dependent if there
exist scalars α1, . . . , αk (α2
1 + · · · + α2
k ≠0) such that
α1A1 + · · · + αkAk = O,
where O is the zero row vector (column vector).
Row vectors (column vectors) A1, . . . , Ak are said to be linearly independent if, for
any α1, . . . , αk (α2
1 + · · · + α2
k ≠0) we have
α1A1 + · · · + αkAk ≠O.
Remark. Row vectors (column vectors) A1, . . . , Ak are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of
them is a linear combination of the others.

◮Determinant of a matrix. For any square matrix A of the form (M5.2.2.1), one can
calculate its determinant (M5.2.1.1), denoted det A, det(A), or |A|.
The determinant of a matrix has the following properties:
1. The determinant of a triangular (upper or lower) and a diagonal matrices is equal to the
product of its entries on the main diagonal. In particular, the determinant of the unit
matrix is equal to 1.
2. The determinant of the product of two matrices A and B of the same size is equal to the
product of their determinants,
det(AB) = det A det B.
3. The determinant is invariant under matrix transposition:
det A = det AT .

◮Inverse matrices. Let A be an n × n square matrix and let I be the unit matrix of the
same size.
A square matrix A is called nonsingular or nondegenerate if det A ≠0.
THEOREM. A square matrix is nondegenerate if and only if its rows (columns) are
linearly independent.
A square matrix A is called invertible if one can ﬁnd a matrix B such that AB = BA = I.
The matrix B is called the inverse of A and denoted A–1. An invertible matrix A has a
unique inverse.
THEOREM. A square matrix A is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero (i.e.,
A is nonsingular).

ALGEBRA
◮Powers of square matrices. The product of several identical square matrices A can be
written as a positive integer power of the matrix A: AA = A2, AAA = A2A = A3, etc. For
a positive integer k, one deﬁnes Ak = Ak–1A as the kth power of A. For a nondegenerate
matrix A, one deﬁnes A0 = AA–1 = I, A–k = (A–1)k. Powers of a matrix have the following
properties:
ApAq = Ap+q,
(Ap)q = Apq,
where p and q are arbitrary positive integers and A is an arbitrary square matrix; or p and q
are arbitrary integers and A is an arbitrary nondegenerate matrix.
There exist matrices Ak whose positive integer power is equal to the zero matrix, even
if A ≠O. If Ak = O for some integer k > 1, then A is called a nilpotent matrix.
A matrix A is said to be involutive if it coincides with its inverse: A = A–1 or A2 = I.
◮Polynomials and functions of matrices. A polynomial with matrix argument is the
expression obtained from a scalar polynomial f(x) by replacing the scalar argument x with
a square matrix X:
f(X) = a0I + a1X + a2X2 + · · · ,
where ai (i = 0, 1, 2, . . .) are real or complex coefﬁcients. The polynomial f(X) is a square
matrix of the same size as X.
The exponential function of a square matrix X can be represented as the following
convergent series:
eX = 1 + X + X2
2! + X3
3! + · · · =

The inverse matrix has the form

Remark. Note that eXeY ≠eY eX, in general. The relation eXeY = eX+Y holds only for commuting
matrices X and Y .

sin X = 1
2i (eiX – e–iX),
cos X = 1
2 (eiX + e–iX),
sinh X = 1

M5.2.4. Eigenvalues and Characteristic Equation of a Matrix. The
Cayley–Hamilton Theorem
◮Eigenvalues and spectra of square matrices. An eigenvalue of a square matrix A is
any real or complex λ for which the matrix F(λ) ≡A – λI is degenerate. The set of all
eigenvalues of a matrix A is called its spectrum, and F(λ) is called its characteristic matrix.
The inverse of an eigenvalue, µ = 1/λ, is called a characteristic value.
A square matrix is nondegenerate if and only if all its eigenvalues are different from
zero.
A nonzero (column) vector X satisfying the condition
AX = λX
is called an eigenvector of the matrix A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ. Eigenvectors
corresponding to distinct eigenvalues of A are linearly independent.

is called the characteristic equation of the matrix A of size n × n, and fA(λ) is called its

coincides with the set of all roots of its characteristic equation.

Therefore the spectrum of the matrix A consists of three eigenvalues: λ1 = –1, λ2 = –2, and λ3 = –3.
Let λj be an eigenvalue of a square matrix A. Then:
1) αλj is an eigenvalue of the matrix αA for any scalar α;
2) λp
j is an eigenvalue of the matrix Ap (p=0, ±1, . . . , ±N for a nondegenerate A; otherwise,
p = 0, 1, . . . , N), where N is a natural number;
3) a polynomial f(A) of the matrix A has the eigenvalue f(λ).

ALGEBRA
A scalar polynomial p(λ) is called an annihilating polynomial of a square matrix A if
p(A) = 0. For example, the characteristic polynomial fA(λ) is an annihilating polynomial
of A. The unique monic annihilating polynomial of least degree is called the minimal
polynomial of A and is denoted by ψ(λ). The minimal polynomial is a divisor of every
annihilating polynomial.
By dividing an arbitrary polynomial f(λ) of degree n by an annihilating polynomial p(λ)
of degree m (p(λ) ≠0), one obtains the representation
f(λ) = p(λ)q(λ) + r(λ),
where q(λ) is a polynomial of degree n – m (if m ≤n) or q(λ) = 0 (if m > n) and r(λ) is a
polynomial of degree l < m or r(λ) = 0. Hence
f(A) = p(A)q(A) + r(A),
where p(A) = 0 and f(A) = r(A). The polynomial r(λ) in this representation is called the
interpolation polynomial of A.
Example 3. Let
f(A) = A4 + 4A3 + 2A2 – 12A – 10I,
where the matrix A is deﬁned in Example 1. Dividing f(λ) by the characteristic polynomial fA(λ) = –λ3 –
6λ2 – 11λ – 6, we obtain the remainder r(λ) = 3λ2 + 4λ + 2. Consequently,
f(A) = r(A) = 3A2 + 4A + 2I.
The Cayley–Hamilton theorem can also be used to ﬁnd the powers and the inverse of a
matrix A (since if fA(A) = 0, then AkfA(A) = 0 for any positive integer k).
Example 4. For the matrix in Examples 1–3, one has
fA(A) = –A3 – 6A2 – 11A – 6I = 0.
Hence we obtain
A3 = –6A2 – 11A – 6I.
By multiplying this expression by A, we obtain
A4 = –6A3 – 11A2 – 6A.
Now we use the representation of the cube of A via lower powers of A and eventually arrive at the formula
A4 = 25A2 + 60A + 36I.
For the inverse matrix, by analogy with the preceding, we obtain
A–1fA(A) = A–1(–A3 – 6A2 – 11A – 6I) = –A2 – 6A – 11I – 6A–1 = 0.
The deﬁnitive result is
A–1 = – 1
6 (A2 + 6A + 11I).

a11x1 + a12x2 + · · · + a1kxk + · · · + a1nxn = b1,
a21x1 + a22x2 + · · · + a2kxk + · · · + a2nxn = b2,

am1x1 + am2x2 + · · · + amkxk + · · · + amnxn = bm,
(M5.3.1.1)
where a11, a12, . . . , amn are the coefﬁcients of the system; b1, b2, . . . , bm are its constant
terms; and x1, x2, . . . , xn are the unknown quantities.
System (M5.3.1.1) is said to be homogeneous if all its constant terms are equal to
zero.
Otherwise (i.e., if there is at least one nonzero free term) the system is called
nonhomogeneous.
If the number of equations is equal to that of the unknown quantities (m = n), sys-
tem (M5.3.1.1) is called a square system.
A solution of system (M5.3.1.1) is a set of n numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn satisfying the
equations of the system. A system is said to be consistent if it admits at least one solution.
If a system has no solutions, it is said to be inconsistent.
A consistent system of the
form (M5.3.1.1) is called a determined system if it has a unique solution. A consistent
system with more than one solution is said to be undetermined.
It is convenient to use matrix notation for systems of the form (M5.3.1.1),
AX = B,
(M5.3.1.2)
where A ≡[aij] is a matrix of size m × n called the basic matrix of the system; X ≡[xi] is
a column vector of size n; B ≡[bi] is a column vector of size m.
◮Consistency condition for a general linear system. System (M5.3.1.1) or (M5.3.1.2)
is associated with two matrices: the basic matrix A of size m × n and the augmented matrix
A1 of size m×(n+1) formed by the matrix A supplemented with the column of the constant
terms, i.e.,
A =

KRONECKER–CAPELLI THEOREM. A linear system (M5.3.1.1) or (M5.3.1.2) is consistent
if and only if its basic matrix and its augmented matrix (M5.3.1.3) have the same rank, i.e.,
rank(A1) = rank(A).

ALGEBRA
◮Equivalent systems of equations. The elementary transformations. Two systems
are said to be equivalent if their sets of solutions coincide.
Systems of linear equations can be simpliﬁed using the following three types of elemen-
tary transformations:
1. Interchange of two equations (or the corresponding rows of the augmented matrix).
2. Multiplication of both sides of one equation (or the corresponding row of the augmented
matrix) by a nonzero constant.
3. Adding to both sides of one equation both sides of another equation multiplied by
a constant (adding to some row of the augmented matrix its other row multiplied by
a constant).
Under the above elementary transformations, a system of linear equations reduces to an
equivalent system of equations.
M5.3.2. Finding Solutions of a System of Linear Equations
◮System of two equations with two unknown quantities. A system of two equations
with two unknown quantities has the form
a1x + b1y = c1,
a2x + b2y = c2.
(M5.3.2.1)
Depending on the coefﬁcients ak, bk, ck, the following three cases are possible:
1◦. If ∆= a1b2 – a2b1 ≠0, then system (M5.3.2.1) has a unique solution,
x = c1b2 – c2b1
a1b2 – a2b1
,
y = a1c2 – a2c1
a1b2 – a2b1
.
2◦. If ∆= a1b2 – a2b1 = 0 and a1c2 – a2c1 = 0 (the case of proportional coefﬁcients), then
system (M5.3.2.1) has inﬁnitely many solutions described by the formulas
x = t,
y = c1 – a1t
b1
(b1 ≠0),
where t is arbitrary.
3◦. If ∆= a1b2 – a2b1 = 0 and a1c2 – a2c1 ≠0, then system (M5.3.2.1) has no solutions.
◮General square system of linear equations with m = n. A square system of linear
equations has the form (M5.3.1.1) with m = n.
1◦. Cramer’s rule. If the determinant of the matrix of system (M5.3.1.1) with m = n is
different from zero, i.e., ∆= det A ≠0, then the system admits a unique solution, which is
expressed by formulas
x1 = ∆1

M5.3. SYSTEMS OF LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS

Example 1. Using Cramer’s rule, let us ﬁnd the solution of the system of linear equations
2x1 + x2 + 4x3 = 16,
3x1 + 2x2 + x3 = 10,
x1 + 3x2 + 3x3 = 16.
The determinant of its basic matrix is different from zero,
∆=

Therefore, by Cramer’s rule (M5.3.2.2), the only solution of the system has the form
x1 = ∆1
∆= 26
26 = 1,
x2 = ∆2
∆= 52
26 = 2,
x3 = ∆3
∆= 78
26 = 3.
2◦. System (M5.3.1.1) with m = n can be treated in the matrix form (M5.3.1.2) where A
is a square matrix. If det A ≠0, the system has a unique solution
X = A–1B,
expressed in terms of the inverse A–1, which can be found by formula (M5.2.3.1).
3◦. Reduction of a system to a triangular form (Gaussian method). Suppose that det A ≠0.
The Gaussian method is based on elementary transformations (see Subsection M5.3.1) used
for the reduction of a given system to an equivalent system having the triangular form
x1 + α12x2 + α13x3 + · · · + α1nxn = β1,
x2 + α23x3 + · · · + α2nxn = β2,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
xn–1 + αn–1,nxn = βn–1,
xn = βn.
This system can be easily solved: inserting xn = βn (from the last equation) into the
preceding (n – 1)st equation, one ﬁnds xn–1. Then, inserting the values obtained for xn,
xn–1 into the (n–2)nd equation, one ﬁnds xn–2. Proceeding in this way, one ﬁnally ﬁnds x1.
This back substitution process is described by the formulas
xk = βk –
n
X
s=k+1
αksxs
(k = n – 1, n – 2, . . . , 1).
Example 2. Solve the system
x1 + x2 – 2x3 = –2,
2x1 + 3x2 + x3 = 9,
3x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 = 7.
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by –2 and add to the second one. Multiply the ﬁrst equation by –3 and add to
the third one. As a result, the ﬁrst equation together with the two obtained make up the equivalent system
x1 + x2 – 2x3 = –2,
x2 + 5x3 = 13,
–x2 + 8x3 = 13.

126
ALGEBRA
Adding together the last two equations and dividing the result by 13, one arrives at the triangular system
x1 + x2 – 2x3 = –2,
x2 + 5x3 = 13,
x3 = 2.
Solving this system from bottom to top, one ﬁnds that
x3 = 2,
x2 = 13 – 5x3 = 3,
x1 = –2 – x2 + 2x3 = –1.
4◦. The Jordan–Gauss method. Let us introduce some deﬁnitions. An unknown xi is called
resolved or basic if it enters only in one equation of the system with coefﬁcient 1 and is not
contained in the other equations.
If each equation of the system contains a resolved unknown, this system is called
resolved. The unknowns of the system that are not basic are called free.
In order to ﬁnd all solutions of a consistent system of linear equations, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd
an equivalent resolved system. If all the unknowns happen to be basic, the resolved system
gives the values of these unknowns. Otherwise, the basic unknowns are expressed in terms
of the free ones.
Description of the method. Let us write down the system of linear equations (M5.3.1.1)
as the table
x1
· · ·
xk
· · ·
xn
a11
· · ·
a1k

For a resolvingentryark ≠0, the followingprocedure is calledtheJordantransformation:
1) multiply the rth row of the table by 1/ark;
2) add the resulting rth row multiplied by –a1k to the ﬁrst row;
3) add the rth row multiplied by –a2k to the second row; and so on for all remaining
rows.
After that, the unknown xk becomes resolved, with all entries of the kth column equal
to zero except that ark = 1.
By choosing other resolving entries in different rows and performing the respective
Jordan transformations, one arrives at a resolved system equivalent to the original one.
If, at some point, the coefﬁcients of the unknowns in a row become all zero and the free
term of that row is nonzero, then the system of equations is inconsistent. If all entries of a
row, including the free term, become zero, then this row is crossed out from the table.
Example 3. Solve the system of equations
2x1 – 3x2 + 5x3 = 1,
x1 + 2x2 – 3x3 = –7,
2x1
+ 5x3 = 4.
Rewrite this system as a table and reduce it to a resolved form in six steps:

M5.4. QUADRATIC FORMS

In the tables above, the resolving entries are boxed. The following sequence of actions has been performed:
(1) double the second row has been subtracted from the ﬁrst and third ones, (2) the ﬁrst row has been subtracted
from the third one, (3) the third row has been divided by 3, (4) the third row multiplied by 7 (resp., by –2)
has been added to the ﬁrst (resp., second) one, (5) the ﬁrst row has been divided by 11, and (6) the ﬁrst row
multiplied by 3 has been added to the second one. Thus, the original system acquires the resolved form





0 ⋅x1 + 0 ⋅x2 + 1 ⋅x3 = 2,
1 ⋅x1 + 0 ⋅x2 + 0 ⋅x3 = –3,
0 ⋅x1 + 1 ⋅x2 + 0 ⋅x3 = 1.
The resulting solution is x1 = –3, x2 = 1, x3 = 2.
Example 4. Solve the system of equations
( 2x1 + 7x2 + 3x3 + x4 = 6,
3x1 + 5x2 + 2x3 + 2x4 = 4,
9x1 + 4x2 + x3 + 7x4 = 2.
With Jordan transformations, this system is reduced to the resolved form
n
– 11x2 – 5x3 + x4 = – 10,
x1 + 9x2 + 4x3
=
8.
Hence, the set of all solutions to the original system is given by
x1 = 8 – 9x2 – 4x3,
x4 = –10 + 11x2 + 5x3,
with x2 and x3 assuming any real values.
◮General system of m linear equations with n unknown quantities. Suppose that
system (M5.3.1.1) is consistent and its basic matrix A has rank r. First, in the matrix A,
one ﬁnds a submatrix of size r ×r with a nonzero rth-order determinant and drops the m–r
equations whose coefﬁcients do not belong to this submatrix (the dropped equations follow
from the remaining ones and can, therefore, be neglected). In the remaining equations,
the n – r unknown quantities (free unknown quantities) that are not involved in the said
submatrix should be transferred to the right-hand sides. Thus, one obtains a system of r
equations with r unknown quantities, which can be solved by any of the methods described
above in the current subsection.
Remark. If the rank r of the basic matrix and the rank of the augmented matrix of system (M5.3.1.1) are
equal to the number of the unknown quantities n, then the system has a unique solution.
◮Existence of nontrivial solutions of a homogeneous system. Consider the homoge-
neous system (M5.3.1.1), with b1 = b2 = · · · = bm = 0. This system is always consistent,
since it always has the so-called trivial solution x1 = x2 = · · · = xn = 0.
THEOREM. A homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution if and only if the rank of
the matrix A is less than the number of the unknown quantities n.
It follows that a square homogeneous system has a nontrivial solution if and only if the
determinant of its matrix of coefﬁcients is equal to zero, det A = 0.
M5.4. Quadratic Forms
M5.4.1. Quadratic Forms and Their Transformations
◮Quadratic form with n variables. A real quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial
of degree 2 in n variables x1, x2, . . . , xn of the form
An(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ≡
n
X
i,j=1
aijxixj,
(M5.4.1.1)
with real coefﬁcients aij satisfying the symmetry condition aij = aji.

128
ALGEBRA
The quadratic form (M5.4.1.1) can be conveniently written in short matrix notation
An(X) = XT AX,
(M5.4.1.2)
where X ≡[xi] is a column vector consisting of n elements, XT is its transpose, and
A ≡[aij] is an n × n symmetric matrix, called the matrix of the quadratic form.
A real-valued quadratic form An(X) is said to be:
a) positive deﬁnite (resp., negative deﬁnite) if An(X) > 0 (resp., An(X) < 0) for any X ≠0;
b) indeﬁnite if there exist vectors X and Y such that An(X) > 0 and An(Y ) < 0;
c) nonnegative (resp., nonpositive) if An(X) ≥0 (resp., An(X) ≤0) for all X ≠0.
The determinant det A of the matrix A is called the discriminant of the quadratic form
An(X). A quadratic form is called degenerate if its discriminant is zero.
◮Criteria of positive and negative deﬁniteness of a quadratic form.
1◦. A real quadratic form An(X) is positive deﬁnite, negative deﬁnite, indeﬁnite, nonnega-
tive, nonpositive if the eigenvalues λi of its matrix A ≡[aij] are all positive, are all negative,
some are positive and some negative, are all nonnegative, are all nonpositive, respectively.
2◦. Sylvester criterion. A real quadratic form An(X) is positive deﬁnite if and only if it
satisﬁes the conditions
∆1 ≡a11 > 0,
∆2 ≡
 a11
a12
a21
a22
 > 0,
. . . ,
∆n ≡det A > 0.
If the signs of the minor determinants alternate,
∆1 < 0,
∆2 > 0,
∆3 < 0, . . . ,
then the quadratic form is negative deﬁnite.
◮Transformations of a real quadratic form. Let us ﬁnd out how the coefﬁcient matrix
changes under a linear transformation of the variables
xi =
n
X
k=1
bikyk
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n),
(M5.4.1.3)
where bik are real numbers. In matrix notation, transformation (M5.4.1.3) becomes
X = BY ,
(M5.4.1.4)
where Y ≡[yi] is a column vector of size n and B ≡[bij] is a transformation matrix of size
n × n.
Substituting (M5.4.1.4) into (M5.4.1.2) gives
An(X) = Y T BT ABY = Y T eAY = eAn(Y ),
where
eA = BT AB.
(M5.4.1.5)
It follows that the discriminant of a quadratic form changes according to the rule
det eA = det A (det B)2.
In what follows, only nondegenerate transformations of variables are considered, i.e.,
those with det B ≠0. The rank of the coefﬁcient matrix remains unchanged under such
transformations. The rank of the coefﬁcient matrix is usually said to be the rank of the
quadratic form.

M5.4. QUADRATIC FORMS
129
M5.4.2. Canonical and Normal Representations of a Quadratic Form
◮Canonical representation of a quadratic form. Any real quadratic form (M5.4.1.1)
can be reduced to the form
An(X) =
r
X
i=1
λiy2
i ≡Ar(Y )
(M5.4.2.1)
using an appropriate nondegenerate linear transformation (M5.4.1.3).
This representation is called a canonical representation of the quadratic form, the real
coefﬁcients λ1, . . . , λr are called the canonical coefﬁcients.
Reduction of the quadratic form (M5.4.1.1) to the canonical form (M5.4.2.1) is not
unique and can be performed using various linear transformations of the form (M5.4.1.3).
LAW OF INERTIA OF QUADRATIC FORMS. The number of terms with positive coefﬁcients
and the number of terms with negative coefﬁcients in any canonical representation of a real
quadratic form does not depend on the method used to obtain such a representation.
The index of inertia of a real quadratic form is the integer r equal to the number of
nonzero coefﬁcients in its canonical representation (this number coincides with the rank
of the quadratic form). Its positive index of inertia is the integer p equal to the number
of positive coefﬁcients in the canonical representation of the form, and its negative index
of inertia is the integer q equal to the number of its negative canonical coefﬁcients. The
integer s = p – q is called the signature of the quadratic form.
A real quadratic form An(X) is
a) positive deﬁnite (resp., negative deﬁnite) if p = n (resp., q = n);
b) indeﬁnite if p ≠0 and q ≠0;
c) nonnegative (resp., nonpositive) if q = 0, p < n (resp., p = 0, q < n).
THEOREM. For any real symmetric quadratic form An(X) there exists a real orthogonal
transformation (M5.4.1.3), whose matrix B possesses the property BTB = BBT = I, that
reduces the quadratic form to the canonical form (M5.4.2.1). The canonical coefﬁcients
λ1, . . . , λn are eigenvalues of the quadratic form matrix A.
◮Lagrange’s method of reduction of a quadratic form to a canonical form. For the
canonical form (M5.4.1.1), consider the following two cases.
Case 1. Suppose that amm ≠0 for some m (1 ≤m ≤n). By letting
An(X) =

amm

2
+ An–1(X),
(M5.4.2.2)
one can easily verify that the quadratic form An–1(X) does not contain the variable xm (it
contains n – 1 variables or fewer). This method of isolating a perfect square in a quadratic
form can always be applied if the matrix [aij] (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n) contains nonzero diagonal
elements.
Case 2. Suppose that amm = ass = 0, but ams ≠0. In this case, the quadratic form can
be represented as
An(X) =

130
ALGEBRA
where An–2(X) does not contain the variables xm and xs (it contains n – 2 variables), and
the linear forms in square brackets are linearly independent (and therefore can be taken as
new independent variables or coordinates).
By combining the above two procedures, the quadratic form An(X) can always be
represented in terms of squared linear forms; these forms are linearly independent, since
each contains a variable which is absent from the other linear forms. By taking the linear
forms to be new independent variables, one obtains the canonical representation of the
quadratic form (M5.4.2.1).
Note that the main formulas (M5.4.2.2) and (M5.4.2.3) can be rewritten as

Example. Reduce the quadratic form
A3(X) = 4x2

to a canonical form.
Using formula (M5.4.2.2a) with m = 1, we get
A3(X) =
1
16 (8x1 – 4x2 – 4x3)2 + 2x2x3 = (2x1 – x2 – x3)2 + A2(X).
Further applying formula (M5.4.2.3a) with m = 2 and s = 3 to A2(X) = 2x2x3, we obtain
A2(X) = 2x2x3 = 1
8 (2x2 + 2x3)2 – 1
8 (2x3 – 2x2)2 = 1
2 (x2 + x3)2 – 1

where
y1 = 2x1 – x2 – x3,

THEOREM. Let An(X) and Bn(X) be real symmetric quadratic forms in n variables
and let Bn(X) be positive deﬁnite. Then there exists a real transformation (M5.4.1.3) that
reduces the two forms to
A(X) =
n
X
k=1

k,
B(X) =
n
X
k=1
y2
k,
where yk are new variables. The set of real λ1, . . . , λn coincides with the spectrum of
eigenvalues of the matrix B–1A; this set consists of the roots of the algebraic equation
det(A – λB) = 0.
M5.5. Linear Spaces
M5.5.1. Concept of a Linear Space. Its Basis and Dimension
◮Deﬁnition of a linear space. A linear space or a vector space over a ﬁeld of scalars
(usually, the ﬁeld of real numbers or the ﬁeld of complex numbers) is a set V of elements
x, y, z, . . . (also called vectors) of any nature for which the following conditions hold:
I. There is a rule that establishes correspondence between any pair of elements x, y ∈V
and a third element z ∈V, called the sum of the elements x, y and denoted by z = x + y.
II. There is a rule that establishes correspondence between any pair x, λ, where x is an
element of V and λ is a scalar, and an element u ∈V, called the product of a scalar λ
and a vector x and denoted by u = λx.
III. The following eight axioms are assumed for the above two operations:
1. Commutativity of the sum: x + y = y + x.
2. Associativity of the sum: (x + y) + z = x + (y + z).
3. There is a zero element 0 such that x + 0 = x for any x.

132
ALGEBRA
4. For any element x there is an opposite element x′ such that x + x′ = 0.
5. A special role of the unit scalar 1: 1 ⋅x = x for any element x.
6. Associativity of the multiplication by scalars: λ(µx) = (λµ)x.
7. Distributivity with respect to the addition of scalars: (λ + µ)x = λx + µx.
8. Distributivity with respect to a sum of vectors: λ(x + y) = λx + λy.
This is the deﬁnition of an abstract linear space. We obtain a speciﬁc linear space if
the nature of the elements and the operations of addition and multiplication by scalars are
concretized.
Example 1. Consider the set of all free vectors in three-dimensional space. If addition of these vectors
and their multiplication by scalars are deﬁned as in analytic geometry (see Subsection M4.5.1), this set becomes
a linear space denoted by B3.
Example 2. Consider the n-dimensional coordinate space Rn, whose elements are ordered sets of n
arbitrary real numbers (x1, . . . , xn). The generic element of this space is denoted by x, i.e., x = (x1, . . . , xn),
and the reals x1, . . . , xn are called the coordinates of the element x. From the algebraic standpoint, the set Rn
may be regarded as the set of all row vectors with n real components.
The operations of addition of elements of Rn and their multiplication by scalars are deﬁned by the following
rules:
(x1, . . . , xn) + (y1, . . . , yn) = (x1 + y1, . . . , xn + yn),
λ(x1, . . . , xn) = (λx1, . . . , λxn).
Remark. If the ﬁeld of scalars λ, µ, . . . in the above deﬁnition is the ﬁeld of all real numbers, the
corresponding linear spaces are called real linear spaces. If the ﬁeld of scalars is that of all complex numbers,
the corresponding space is called a complex linear space. In many situations, it is clear from the context which
ﬁeld of scalars is meant.
The above axioms imply the following properties of an arbitrary linear space:
1. The zero vector is unique, and for any element x the opposite element is unique.
2. The zero vector 0 is equal to the product of any element x by the scalar 0.
3. For any element x, the opposite element is equal to the product of x by the scalar –1.
4. The difference of two elements x and y, i.e., the element z such that z + y = x, is unique.
◮Basis and dimension of a linear space. Isomorphism of linear spaces. An element
y is called a linear combination of elements x1, . . . , xk of a linear space V if there exist
scalars α1, . . . , αk such that
y = α1x1 + · · · + αkxk.
Elements x1, . . . , xk of the space V are said to be linearly dependent if there exist scalars
α1, . . . , αk such that |α1|2 + · · · + |αk|2 ≠0 and
α1x1 + · · · + αkxk = 0,
where 0 is the zero element of V.
Elements x1, . . . , xk of the space V are said to be linearly independent if for any scalars
α1, . . . , αk such that |α1|2 + · · · + |αk|2 ≠0, we have
α1x1 + · · · + αkxk ≠0.
Remark 1. Elements x1, . . . , xk of a linear space V are linearly dependent if and only if at least one of
them is a linear combination of the others.
Remark 2. If at least one of the elements x1, . . . , xk is equal to zero, then these elements are lin-
early dependent.
If some of the elements x1, . . . , xk are linearly dependent, then all these elements are
linearly dependent.

M5.5. LINEAR SPACES
133
Example 3. The elements i1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), i2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0), . . . , in = (0, 0, . . . , 1) of the space Rn (see
Example 2) are linearly independent. For any x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn, the vectors x, i1, . . . , in are linearly
dependent.
A basis of a linear space V is deﬁned as any system of linearly independent vectors
e1, . . . , en such that for any element x of the space V there exist scalars x1, . . . , xn such
that
x = x1e1 + · · · + xnen.
This relation is called the representation of an element x in terms of the basis e1, . . . , en,
and the scalars x1, . . . , xn are called the coordinates of the element x in that basis.
UNIQUENESS THEOREM. The representation of any element x ∈V in terms of a given
basis e1, . . . , en is unique.
Let e1, . . . , en be any basis in V and vectors x and y have the coordinates x1, . . . , xn and
y1, . . . , yn in that basis. Then the coordinates of the vector x + y in that basis are x1 + y1,
. . . , xn + yn, and the coordinates of the vector λx are λx1, . . . , λxn for any scalar λ.
Example 4. Any three noncoplanar vectors form a basis in the linear space B3 of all free vectors. The n
elements i1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), i2 = (0, 1, . . . , 0), . . . , in = (0, 0, . . . , 1) form a basis in the linear space Rn.
A linear spaceV issaidtoben-dimensional if it contains n linearly independent elements
and any n + 1 elements are linearly dependent. The number n is called the dimension of
that space, n = dim V.
A linear space V is said to be inﬁnite-dimensional (dim V = ∞) if for any positive
integer N it contains N linearly independent elements.
THEOREM 1. If V is a linear space of dimension n, then any n linearly independent
elements of that space form its basis.
THEOREM 2. If a linear space V has a basis consisting of n elements, then dim V = n.
Example 5. The dimension of the space B3 of all free vectors is equal to 3. The dimension of the space
Rn is equal to n.
Two linear spaces V and V′ over the same ﬁeld of scalars are said to be isomorphic
if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of these spaces such that if
elements x and y from V correspond to elements x′ and y′ from V′, then the element x + y
corresponds to x′ + y′ and the element λx corresponds to λx′ for any scalar λ.
Remark. If linear spaces V and V′ are isomorphic, then the zero element of one space corresponds to the
zero element of the other.
THEOREM. Any two n-dimensional real (or complex) spaces V and V′ are isomorphic.
◮Afﬁne space. An afﬁne space is a nonempty set A that consists of elements of any
nature, called points, for which the following conditions hold:
I. There is a given linear (vector) space V, called the associated linear space.
II. There is a rule by which any ordered pair of points A, B ∈A is associated with an
element (vector) from V; this vector is denoted by −−→
AB and is called the vector issuing
from the point A with endpoint at B.
III. The following conditions (called axioms of afﬁne space) hold:
1. For any point A ∈A and any vector a ∈V, there is a unique point B ∈A such that
−−→
AB = a.
2. −−→
AB + −−→
BC = −→
AC for any three points A, B, C ∈A.
By deﬁnition, the dimension of an afﬁne space A is the dimension of the associated
linear space V, dim A = dim V.
Any linear space may be regarded as an afﬁne space.

134
ALGEBRA
In particular, the space Rn can be naturally considered as an afﬁne space. Thus if A =
(a1, . . . , an) and B = (b1, . . . , bn) are points of the afﬁne space Rn, then the corresponding
vector −−→
AB from the linear space Rn is deﬁned by −−→
AB = (b1 – a1, . . . , bn – an).
Let A be an n-dimensional afﬁne space with the associated linear space V. A coordinate
system in the afﬁne space A is a ﬁxed point O ∈A, together with a ﬁxed basis e1, . . . ,
en ∈V. The point O is called the origin of this coordinate system.
Let M be a point of an afﬁne space A with a coordinate system Oe1 . . . en. One says
that the point M has afﬁne coordinates (or simply coordinates) x1, . . . , xn in this coordinate
system, and one writes M = (x1, . . . , xn) if x1, . . . xn are the coordinates of the radius-vector
−−→
OM in the basis e1, . . . , en, i.e., −−→
OM = x1e1 + · · · + xnen.
M5.5.2. Subspaces of Linear Spaces
◮Concept of a linear subspace and a linear span. A subset L of a linear space V is
called a linear subspace of V if the following conditions hold:
1. If x and y belong to L, then the sum x + y belongs to L.
2. If x belongs to L and λ is an arbitrary scalar, then the element λx belongs to L.
The null subspace in a linear space V is its subset consisting of the single element zero.
The space V itself can be regarded as its own subspace. These two subspaces are called
improper subspaces. All other subspaces are called proper subspaces.
Example 1. A subset B2 consisting of all free vectors parallel to a given plane is a subspace in the linear
space B3 of all free vectors.
The linear span L(x1, . . . , xm) of vectors x1, . . . , xm in a linear space V is, by deﬁnition,
the set of all linear combinations of these vectors, i.e., the set of all vectors of the form
α1x1 + · · · + αmxm,
where α1, . . . , αm are arbitrary scalars. The linear span L(x1, . . . , xm) is the least subspace
of V containing the elements x1, . . . , xm.
If a subspace L of an n-dimensional space V does not coincide with V, then dim L <
n = dim V.
Let elements e1, . . . , ek form a basis in a k-dimensional subspace of an n-dimensional
linear space V. Then this basis can be supplemented by elements ek+1, . . . , en of the space
V, so that the system e1, . . . , ek, ek+1, . . . , en forms a basis in the space V.
THEOREM ON THE DIMENSION OF A LINEAR SPAN.
The dimension of a linear span
L(x1, . . . , xm) of elements x1, . . . , xm is equal to the maximal number of linearly indepen-
dent vectors in the system x1, . . . , xm.
◮Sum and intersection of subspaces. The intersection of subspaces L1 and L2 of one
and the same linear space V is, by deﬁnition, the set of all elements x of V that belong
simultaneously to both spaces L1 and L2. Such elements form a subspace of V.
The sum of subspaces L1 and L2 of one and the same linear space V is, by deﬁnition,
the set of all elements of V that can be represented in the form y + z, where y is an element
of V1 and z is an element of L2. The sum of subspaces is also a subspace of V.
THEOREM. The sum of dimensions of arbitrary subspaces L1 and L2 of a ﬁnite-
dimensional space V is equal to the sum of the dimension of their intersection and the
dimension of their sum.
Example 2. Let B3 be the linear space of all free vectors (in three-dimensional space). Denote by L1 the
subspace of all free vectors parallel to the plane OXY , and by L2 the subspace of all free vectors parallel to

M5.5. LINEAR SPACES
135
the plane OXZ. Then the sum of the subspaces L1 and L2 coincides with B3, and their intersection consists
of all free vectors parallel to the axis OX.
The dimension of each space L1 and L2 is equal to two, the dimension of their sum is equal to three, and
the dimension of their intersection is equal to unity.
M5.5.3. Coordinate Transformations Corresponding to Basis
Transformations in a Linear Space
◮Basis transformation and its inverse. Let e1, . . . , en and ee1, . . . , een be two arbitrary
bases of an n-dimensional linear space V.
Suppose that the elements ee1, . . . , een are
expressed via e1, . . . , en by the formulas
ee1 = a11e1 + a12e2 + · · · + a1nen,
ee2 = a21e1 + a22e2 + · · · + a2nen,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
een = an1e1 + an2e2 + · · · + annen.
Thus, the transition from the basis e1, . . . , en to the basis ee1, . . . , een is determined by the
matrix
A ≡




a11




.
Note that det A ≠0, i.e., the matrix A is nondegenerate.
The transition from the basis ee1, . . . , een to the basis e1, . . . , en is determined by the
matrix B ≡[bij] = A–1. Thus, we can write
eei =
n
X
j=1
aijej,
ek =
n
X
j=1
bkjeej
(i, k = 1, 2, . . . , n).
(M5.5.3.1)
◮Relations between coordinate transformations and basis transformations. Suppose
that in a linear n-dimensional space V, the transition from its basis e1, . . . , en to another
basis ee1, . . . , een is determined by the matrix A (see above). Let x be any element of
the space V with the coordinates (x1, . . . , xn) in the basis e1, . . . , en and the coordinates
(ex1, . . . , exn) in the basis ee1, . . . , een, i.e.,
x = x1e1 + · · · + xnen = ex1ee1 + · · · + exneen.
Then using formulas (M5.5.3.1), we obtain the following relations between these coordi-
nates:
xj =
n
X
i=1
exiaij,
exk =
n
X
l=1
xlblk,
j, k = 1, . . . , n.
In terms of matrices and row vectors, these relations can be written as follows:
(x1, . . . , xn) = (ex1, . . . , exn)A,
(ex1, . . . , exn) = (x1, . . . , xn)A–1
or, in terms of column vectors,
(x1, . . . , xn)T = AT (ex1, . . . , exn)T ,
(ex1, . . . , exn)T = (A–1)T (x1, . . . , xn)T ,
where the superscript T indicates the transpose of a matrix.

ALGEBRA
M5.5.4. Euclidean Space
◮Deﬁnition and properties of a Euclidean space. A real Euclidean space (or simply,
Euclidean space) is a real linear space V endowed with a scalar product (also known as
inner product and dot product), which is a real-valued function of two arguments x ∈V,
y∈V denoted by x⋅y, and satisfying the following conditions (axioms of the scalar product):
1. Symmetry: x ⋅y = y ⋅x.
2. Distributivity: (x1 + x2) ⋅y = x1 ⋅y + x2 ⋅y.
3. Homogeneity: (λx) ⋅y = λ(x ⋅y) for any real λ.
4. Positive deﬁniteness: x ⋅x ≥0 for any x, and x ⋅x = 0 if and only if x = 0.
Example 1. Consider the linear space B3 of all free vectors in three-dimensional space. The space B3
becomes a Euclidean space if the scalar product is introduced as in analytic geometry (see Subsection M4.5.3):
x ⋅y = |x| |y| cos ϕ,
where ϕ is the angle between the vectors x and y.
Example 2. Consider the n-dimensional coordinate space Rn whose elements are ordered systems of n
arbitrary real numbers, x = (x1, . . . , xn). Endowing this space with the scalar product
x ⋅y = x1y1 + · · · + xnyn,
we obtain a Euclidean space.
THEOREM. For any two elements x and y of a Euclidean space, the Cauchy–Schwarz
inequality holds:
(x ⋅y)2 ≤(x ⋅x)(y ⋅y).
Here equality holds if and only if one of the vectors is 0 or one vector is a multiple of the
other.
A linear space V is called a normed space if it is endowed with a norm, which is a
real-valued function of x ∈V, denoted by ∥x∥and satisfying the following conditions:
1. Homogeneity: ∥λx∥= |λ| ∥x∥for any real λ.
2. Positive deﬁniteness: ∥x∥≥0 and ∥x∥= 0 if and only if x = 0.
3. The triangle inequality (also called the Minkowski inequality) holds for all elements
x and y:
∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥.
(M5.5.4.1)
The value ∥x∥is called the norm of an element x or its length.
THEOREM. Any Euclidean space becomes a normed space if the norm is introduced by
∥x∥= √x ⋅x.
(M5.5.4.2)
COROLLARY. In any Euclidean space with the norm (M5.5.4.2), the triangle inequality
(M5.5.4.1) holds for all its elements x and y.
The distance between elements x and y of a Euclidean space is deﬁned by
d(x, y) = ∥x – y∥.
One says that ϕ is the angle between two elements x and y of a Euclidean space if
cos ϕ =
x ⋅y
∥x∥∥y∥.
Two elements x and y of a Euclidean space are said to be orthogonal if their scalar product
is equal to zero, x ⋅y = 0.
PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM. Let x1, . . . xm be mutually orthogonal elements of a Eu-
clidean space, i.e., xi ⋅xj = 0 for i ≠j. Then
∥x1 + · · · + xm∥2 = ∥x1∥2 + · · · + ∥xm∥2.

M5.5. LINEAR SPACES
137
Example 3. In the Euclidean space B3 of free vectors with the usual scalar product (see Example 1), the
following relations hold:
∥a∥= |a|,
(a ⋅b)2 ≤|a|2|b|2,
|a + b| ≤|a| + |b|.
In the Euclidean space Rn of ordered systems of n numbers with the scalar product deﬁned in Example 2,
the following relations hold:
∥x∥=
q
x2
1 + · · · + x2n,
(x1y1 + · · · + xnyn)2 ≤(x2

◮Orthonormal basis in a ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean space. For elements x1, . . . , xm
of a Euclidean space, the mth-order determinant det[xi⋅xj] is called their Gram determinant.
These elements are linearly independent if and only if their Gram determinant is different
from zero.
One says that n elements i1, . . . , in of an n-dimensional Euclidean space V form its
orthonormal basis if these elements have unit norm and are mutually orthogonal, i.e.,
ii ⋅ij =
n 1
for i = j,
0
for i ≠j.
THEOREM. In any n-dimensional Euclidean space V, there exists an orthonormal basis.
Orthogonalization of linearly independent elements:
Let e1, . . . , en be n linearly independent vectors of an n-dimensional Euclidean space V.
From these vectors, one can construct an orthonormal basis of V using the following
algorithm (called Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization):
ii =
gi
√gi ⋅gi
,
where
gi = ei –
i
X
j=1
(ei ⋅ij)ij
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n).
(M5.5.4.3)
Remark. In any n-dimensional (n > 1) Euclidean space V, there exist inﬁnitely many orthonormal bases.
Properties of an orthonormal basis of a Euclidean space:
1. Let i1, . . . , in be an orthonormal basis of a Euclidean space V. Then the scalar product
of two elements x = x1i1 + · · · + xnin and y = y1i1 + · · · + ynin is equal to the sum of
products of their respective coordinates:
x ⋅y = x1y1 + · · · + xnyn.
2. The coordinates of any vector x in an orthonormal basis i1, . . . , in are equal to the scalar
product of x and the corresponding vector of the basis (or the projection of the element
x on the axis in the direction of the corresponding vector of the basis):
xk = x ⋅ik
(k = 1, 2, . . . , n).
Remark. In an arbitrary basis e1, . . . , en of a Euclidean space, the scalar product of two elements
x = x1e1 + · · · + xnen and y = y1e1 + · · · + ynen has the form
x ⋅y =
n
X
i=1
n
X
j=1
aijxiyj,
where aij = ei ⋅ej (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n).
Two Euclidean spaces V and eV are said to be isomorphic if one can establish a one-to-one
correspondence between the elements of these spaces satisfying the following conditions:
if elements x and y of V correspond to elements ex and ey of eV, then the element x + y
corresponds to ex +ey; the element λx corresponds to λex for any λ; the scalar product (x⋅y)V
is equal to the scalar product (ex ⋅ey)eV.
THEOREM. Any two n-dimensional Euclidean spaces V and eV are isomorphic.

Limits and Derivatives
M6.1. Basic Concepts of Mathematical Analysis
M6.1.1. Number Sets. Functions of Real Variable
◮Real axis, intervals, and segments. The real axis is a straight line with a point O
chosen as the origin, a positive direction, and a scale unit.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all real numbers R and the set
of all points of the real axis, with each real x being represented by a point on the real axis
separated from O by the distance |x| and lying to the right of O for x > 0, or to the left of O
for x < 0.
One often has to deal with the following number sets (sets of real numbers or sets on
the real axis).
1. Sets of the form (a, b), (–∞, b), (a, +∞), and (–∞, +∞) consisting, respectively, of
all x ∈R such that a < x < b, x < b, x > a, and x is arbitrary are called open intervals
(sometimes simply intervals).
2. Sets of the form [a, b] consisting of all x ∈R such that a ≤x ≤b are called closed
intervals or segments.
3. Sets of the form (a, b], [a, b), (–∞, b], [a, +∞) consisting of all x such that a < x ≤b,
a ≤x < b, x ≤b, x ≥a are called half-open intervals.
A neighborhood of a point x0 ∈R is deﬁned as any open interval (a, b) containing x0
(a < x0 < b). A neighborhood of the “point” +∞, –∞, or ∞is deﬁned, respectively, as
any set of the form (b, +∞), (–∞, c) or (–∞, –a) ∪(a, +∞) (here, a ≥0).
◮Lower and upper bound of a set on a straight line. The upper bound of a set of real
numbers is the least number that bounds the set from above. The lower bound of a set of
real numbers is the largest number that bounds the set from below.
In more details: let a set of real numbers X ∈R be given. A number β is called its
upper bound and denoted sup X if for any x ∈X the inequality x ≤β holds and for any
β1 < β there exists an x1 ∈X such that x1 > β1. A number α is called the lower bound
of X and denoted inf X if for any x ∈X the inequality x ≥α holds and for any α1 > α
there exists an x1 ∈X such that x1 < α1.
Example 1. For a set X consisting of two numbers a and b (a < b), we have
inf X = a,
sup X = b.
Example 2. For intervals (open, closed, and half-open), we have
inf(a, b) = inf[a, b] = inf(a, b] = inf[a, b) = a,
sup(a, b) = sup[a, b] = sup(a, b] = sup[a, b) = b.
One can see that the upper and lower bounds may belong to a given set (e.g., for closed intervals) and may not
(e.g., for open intervals).
The symbol +∞(resp., –∞) is called the upper (resp., lower) bound of a set unbounded
from above (resp., from below).

LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
◮Real-valued functions of real variable. Methods of deﬁning a function.
1◦. Let D and E be two sets of real numbers. Suppose that there is a relation between the
points of D and E such that to each x ∈D there corresponds some y ∈E, denoted by
y = f(x). In this case, one speaks of a function f deﬁned on the set D and taking its values
in the set E. The set D is called the domain of the function f, and the subset of E consisting
of all elements f(x) is called the range of the function f. This functional relation is often
denoted by y = f(x), f : D →E, f : x 7→y.
The following terms are also used: x is the independent variable or the argument; y is
the dependent variable.
2◦. The most common and convenient way to deﬁne a function is the analytic method: the
function is deﬁned explicitly by means of a formula (or several formulas) depending on the
argument x; for instance, y = 2 sin x + 1.
Implicit deﬁnition of a function consists of using an equation of the form F(x, y) = 0,
from which one calculates the value y for any ﬁxed value of the argument x.
Parametric deﬁnition of a function consists of deﬁning the values of the independent
variable x and the dependent variable y by a pair of formulas depending on an auxiliary
variable t (parameter): x = p(t), y = q(t).
Quite often functions are deﬁned in terms of convergent series or by means of tables or
graphs. There are some other methods of deﬁning functions.
3◦. The graph of a function is the representation of a function y = f(x) as a line on the plane
with orthogonal coordinates x, y, the points of the line having the coordinates x, y = f(x),
where x is an arbitrary point from the domain of the function.
◮Single-valued, periodic, odd and even functions.
1◦. A function is single-valued if each value of its argument corresponds to a unique value
of the function. A function is multi-valued if there is at least one value of its argument
corresponding to two or more values of the function. In what follows, we consider only
single-valued functions, unless indicated otherwise.
2◦. A function f(x) is called periodic with period T (or T-periodic) if f(x + T) = f(x) for
any x.
3◦. A function f(x) is called even if it satisﬁes the condition f(x) = f(–x) for any x. A
function f(x) is called odd if it satisﬁes the condition f(x) = –f(–x) for any x.
◮Decreasing, increasing, monotone, and bounded functions.
1◦. A function f(x) is called increasing or strictly increasing (resp., nondecreasing) on a set
D ⊂R if for any x1, x2 ∈D such that x1 > x2, we have f(x1) > f(x2) (resp., f(x1) ≥f(x2)).
A function f(x) is called decreasing or strictly decreasing (resp., nonincreasing) on a set
D if for all x1, x2 ∈D such that x1 > x2, we have f(x1) < f(x2) (resp., f(x1) ≤f(x2) ). All
such functions are called monotone functions. Strictly increasing or decreasing functions
are called strictly monotone.
2◦. A function f(x) is called bounded on a set D if |f(x)| < M for all x ∈D, where M is
a ﬁnite constant. A function f(x) is called bounded from above (bounded from below) on a
set D if f(x) < M (M < f(x)) for all x ∈D, where M is a real constant.
◮Composite and inverse functions.
1◦. Consider a function u = u(x), x ∈D, with values u ∈E, and let y = f(u) be a function
deﬁned on E. Then the function y = f
 u(x)

, x ∈D, is called a composite function or the
superposition of the functions f and u.

M6.1. BASIC CONCEPTS OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
141
2◦. Consider a function y = f(x) that maps x ∈D into y ∈E. The inverse function of
y = f(x) is a function x = g(y) deﬁned on E and such that x = g(f(x)) for all x ∈D. The
inverse function is often denoted by g = f –1.
For strictly monotone functions f(x), the inverse function always exists. In order to
construct the inverse function g(y), one should use the relation y = f(x) to express x
through y. The function g(y) is monotonically increasing or decreasing together with f(x).
M6.1.2. Limit of a Sequence
◮Some deﬁnitions. Suppose that there is a correspondence between each positive integer
n and some (real or complex) number denoted, for instance, by xn. In this case, one says
that a numerical sequence (or, simply, a sequence) x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . is deﬁned. Such a
sequence is often denoted by {xn}; xn is called the generic term of the sequence.
Example 1. For the sequence {n2 – 2}, we have x1 = –1, x2 = 2, x3 = 7, x4 = 14, etc.
A sequence is called bounded (bounded from above, bounded from below) if there is a
constant M such that |xn| < M (respectively, xn < M, xn > M) for all n = 1, 2, . . .
◮Limit of a sequence. A number b is called the limit of a sequence x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . if
for any ε > 0 there is N = N(ε) such that |xn – b| < ε for all n > N.
If b is the limit of the sequence {xn}, one writes lim
n→∞xn = b or xn →b as n →∞.
The limit of a constant sequence {xn = c} exists and is equal to c, i.e., lim
n→∞c = c. In
this case, the inequality |xn – c| < ε takes the form 0 < ε and holds for all n.
Example 2. Let us show that lim
n→∞
n
n + 1 = 1.
Consider the difference

n
n + 1 – 1
 =
1
n + 1 . The inequality
1
n + 1 < ε holds for all n > 1
ε – 1 = N(ε).
Therefore, for any positive ε there exists an N = 1
ε – 1 such that for n > N we have

n
n + 1 – 1
 < ε.
It may happen that a sequence {xn} has no limit at all. For example, this is the case for
the sequence {xn} = {(–1)n}. A sequence that has a ﬁnite limit is called convergent.
THEOREM (BOLZANO–CAUCHY). A sequence xn has a ﬁnite limit if and only if for any
ε > 0, there is N such that the inequality
|xn – xm| < ε
holds for all n > N and m > N.
◮Properties of convergent sequences.
1. Any convergent sequence can have only one limit.
2. Any convergent sequence is bounded. From any bounded sequence one can extract
a convergent subsequence.*
3. If a sequence converges to b, then any of its subsequences also converges to b.
4. If {xn}, {yn} are two convergent sequences, then the sequences {xn ±yn}, {xn ⋅yn},
and {xn/yn} (in this ratio, it is assumed that yn ≠0 and lim
n→∞yn ≠0) are also convergent
* Let {xn} be a given sequence and let {nk} be a strictly increasing sequence with k and nk being natural
numbers. The sequence {xnk} is called a subsequence of the sequence {xn}.

◮Increasing, decreasing, and monotone sequences. A sequence {xn} is called in-
creasing or strictly increasing (resp., nondecreasing) if the inequality xn+1 > xn (resp.,
xn+1 ≥xn) holds for all n. A sequence {xn} is called decreasing or strictly decreasing
(resp., nonincreasing) if the inequality xn+1 < xn (resp., xn+1 ≤xn) holds for all n. All such
sequences are called monotone sequences. Strictly increasing or decreasing sequences are
called strictly monotone.
THEOREM. Any monotone bounded sequence has a ﬁnite limit.
Example 3. It can be shown that the sequence

convergent. Its limit is denoted by the letter e:

(e ≈2.71828).
Logarithms with the base e are called natural or Napierian, and loge x is denoted by
ln x.
◮Properties of positive sequences.
1◦. If a sequence xn (xn > 0) has a limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite), then the sequence
yn =
n√x1 ⋅x2 . . . xn

◮Inﬁnitely small and inﬁnitely large sequences. A sequence xn converging to zero is
called inﬁnitely small or inﬁnitesimal.
A sequence xn whose terms inﬁnitely grow in absolute values with the growth of n
is called inﬁnitely large or “tending to inﬁnity.” In this case, the following notation is
used:
lim
n→∞xn = ∞. If, in addition, all terms of the sequence starting from some number
are positive (negative), then one says that the sequence xn converges to “plus (minus)
inﬁnity,” and one writes lim
n→∞xn = +∞
 lim
n→∞xn = –∞

. For instance, lim
n→∞(–1)nn2 = ∞,
lim
n→∞
√n = +∞, lim
n→∞(–n) = –∞.
THEOREM (STOLZ). Let xn and yn be two inﬁnitely large sequences, yn →+∞, and yn
increases with the growth of n (at least for sufﬁciently large n): yn+1 > yn. Then
lim
n→∞
xn
yn
= lim
n→∞
xn – xn–1

,
provided that the right limit exists (ﬁnite or inﬁnite).
Example 5. Let us ﬁnd the limit of the sequence
zn = 1k + 2k + · · · + nk
nk+1
.
Taking xn = 1k + 2k + · · · + nk and yn = nk+1 in the Stolz theorem, we get
lim
n→∞zn = lim
n→∞
nk
nk+1 – (n – 1)k+1 .
Since (n – 1)k+1 = nk+1 – (k + 1)nk + · · · , we have nk+1 – (n – 1)k+1 = (k + 1)nk + · · · , and therefore
lim
n→∞zn = lim
n→∞
nk
(k + 1)nk + · · · =
1
k + 1 .
◮Upper and lower limits of a sequence. The limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) of a subsequence
of a given sequence xn is called a partial limit of xn. In the set of all partial limits of any
sequence of real numbers, there always exists the largest and the least (ﬁnite or inﬁnite).
The largest (resp., least) partial limit of a sequence is called its upper (resp., lower) limit.
The upper and lower limits of a sequence xn are denoted, respectively,
lim
n→∞xn,
lim
n→∞
xn.
Example 6. The upper and lower limits of the sequence xn = (–1)n are, respectively,
lim
n→∞xn = 1,
lim
n→∞xn = –1.
A sequence xn has a limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) if and only if its upper limit coincides with
its lower limit:
lim
n→∞xn = lim
n→∞xn = lim
n→∞
xn.

M6.1.3. Limit of a Function. Asymptotes
◮Deﬁnition of the limit of a function. One-sided limits.
1◦. One says that b is the limit of a function f(x) as x tends to a if for any ε > 0 there is
δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that |f(x) – b| < ε for all x such that 0 < |x – a| < δ.
Notation: lim

THEOREM (BOLZANO–CAUCHY 1). A function f(x) has a ﬁnite limit as x tends to a
(a is assumed ﬁnite) if and only if for any ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that the inequality
|f(x1) – f(x2)| < ε

2◦. One says that b is the left-hand limit (resp., right-hand limit) of a function f(x) as x
tends to a if for any ε > 0 there is δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that |f(x) –b| < ε for a –δ < x < a (resp.,
for a < x < a + δ).
Notation:

◮Asymptotes of the graph of a function. An asymptote of the graph of a function
y = f(x) is a straight line whose distance from a point (x, y) on the graph of y = f(x) tends
to zero if at least one of the coordinates (x, y) tends to inﬁnity.
The line x = a is a vertical asymptote of the graph of the function y = f(x) if at least
one of the one-sided limits of f(x) as x →a ± 0 is equal to +∞or –∞.
The line y = kx + b is an oblique asymptote of the graph of y = f(x) if at least one of
the limit relations holds:
lim
x→+∞[f(x) – kx – b] = 0
or
lim
x→–∞[f(x) – kx – b] = 0.
If there exist ﬁnite limits
lim
x→+∞

lim

(M6.1.3.2)
then the line y = kx + b is an oblique asymptote of the graph for x →+∞(in a similar way,
one deﬁnes an asymptote for x →–∞).
Example. Let us ﬁnd the asymptotes of the graph of the function y =
x2

1◦. The graph has a vertical asymptote x = 1, since lim

M6.1.4. Inﬁnitely Small and Inﬁnitely Large Functions
◮Deﬁnitions. A function f(x) is called inﬁnitely small for x →a if lim
x→a f(x) = 0.
A function f(x) is said to be inﬁnitely large for x →a if for any K > 0 the inequality
|f(x)| > K holds for all x ≠a in a small neighborhood of the point a. In this case, one writes
f(x) →∞as x →a or lim
x→a f(x) = ∞. (In these deﬁnitions, a is a ﬁnite number or any of
the symbols ∞, +∞, –∞.) If f(x) is inﬁnitely large for x →a and f(x) > 0 (f(x) < 0) in
a neighborhood of a (for x ≠a), one writes lim
x→a f(x) = +∞(resp., lim
x→a f(x) = –∞).
◮Properties of inﬁnitely small and inﬁnitely large functions.
1. The sum and the product of ﬁnitely many inﬁnitely small functions for x →a is an
inﬁnitely small function.
2. The product of an inﬁnitely small function f(x) for x →a and a function g(x) which
is bounded in a neighborhood U of the point a (i.e., |g(x)| < M for all x ∈U, where M > 0
is a constant) is an inﬁnitely small function.
3. lim
x→a f(x) = b if and only if f(x) = b + g(x), where g(x) is inﬁnitely small for x →a.
4. A function f(x) is inﬁnitely large at some point if and only if the function g(x) =
1/f(x) is inﬁnitely small at the same point.
◮Comparison of inﬁnitely small quantities. Symbols of the order: O and o. Func-
tions f(x) and g(x) that are inﬁnitely small for x →a are called equivalent near a if
lim
x→a

g(x) = 1. In this case one writes f(x) ∼g(x).

M6.1.5. Continuous Functions. Discontinuities of the First and the
Second Kind
◮Continuous functions. A function f(x) is called continuous at a point x = a if it is
deﬁned at that point and its neighborhood and lim
x→a f(x) = f(a).
For continuous functions, a small variation of their argument ∆x = x – a results in a
small variation of the function ∆y = f(x) – f(a), i.e., ∆y →0 as ∆x →0. (This property
is often used as a deﬁnition of continuity.)
A function f(x) is called right-continuous at a point x = a if it is deﬁned at that point
(and to its right) and lim
x→a+0 f(x) = f(a). A function f(x) is called left-continuous at a point
x = a if it is deﬁned at that point (and to its left) and lim
x→a–0 f(x) = f(a).
◮Properties of continuous functions.
1. Suppose that functions f(x) and g(x) are continuous at some point a. Then the
functions f(x) ± g(x), cf(x), f(x)g(x), f(x)
g(x) (g(a) ≠0) are also continuous at a.
2. Suppose that a function f(x) is continuous on the segment [a, b] and takes values of
different signs at its endpoints, i.e., f(a)f(b) < 0. Then there is a point c between a and b
at which f(x) vanishes:
f(c) = 0
(a < c < b).
3. If f(x) is continuous at a point a and f(a) > 0 (resp., f(a) < 0), then there is δ > 0
such that f(x) > 0 (resp., f(x) < 0) for all x ∈(a – δ, a + δ).
4. Any function f(x) that is continuous at each point of a segment [a, b] attains its
largest and its smallest values, M and m, on that segment.
5. A function f(x) that is continuous on a segment [a, b] takes any value c ∈[m, M] on
that segment, where m and M are, respectively, its smallest and its largest values on [a, b].
6. If f(x) is continuous and increasing (resp., decreasing) on a segment [a, b], then on
the segment

f(a), f(b)

(resp.,

f(b), f(a)

continuous and increasing (resp., decreasing).

is continuous at a.
Remark. Any elementary function is continuous at each point of its domain.
◮Points of discontinuity of a function. A point a is called a point of discontinuity of the
ﬁrst kind for a function f(x) if there exist ﬁnite one-sided limits f(a + 0) and f(a – 0), but
the relations
lim
x→a+0 f(x) = lim
x→a–0 f(x) = f(a) do not hold. The value |f(a + 0) – f(a – 0)| is
called the jump of the function at the point a. In particular, if f(a + 0) = f(a – 0) ≠f(a),
then a is called a point of removable discontinuity.
* There is another deﬁnition of the symbol O. Namely, f(x) = O
 g(x)

for x →a if the inequality
|f(x)| ≤K|g(x)|, K = const, holds in some neighborhood of the point a (for x ≠a).

LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
Examples of functions with discontinuities of the ﬁrst kind.
1. The function f(x) =
n 0
for x < 0
1
for x ≥0 has a jump equal to 1 at the discontinuity point x = 0.
2. The function f(x) =
n 0
for x ≠0
1
for x = 0 has a removable discontinuity at the point x = 0.
A point a is called a point of discontinuity of the second kind if at least one of the
one-sided limits f(a + 0) or f(a – 0) does not exist or is equal to inﬁnity.
Examples of functions with discontinuities of the second kind.
1. The function f(x) = sin 1
x has a second-kind discontinuity at the point x = 0 (since this function has
no one-sided limits as x →±0).
2. The function f(x) = 1/x has an inﬁnite limit as x →0, so it has a second-kind discontinuity at the point
x = 0.
M6.1.6. Convex and Concave Functions
◮Deﬁnition of convex and concave functions.

M6.1. BASIC CONCEPTS OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS
149
The geometrical meaning of concavity is that all points of the graph curve between two
graph points lie above or on the rectilinear segment joining the two graph points (see
Fig. M6.2 b).
If for x1 ≠x2, condition (M6.1.6.2) holds with > instead of ≥, then the function f(x) is
called strictly concave.
◮Some properties of convex and concave functions.
1. The product of a convex (concave) function and a positive constant is a convex
(concave) function.
2. The sum of two or more convex (concave) functions is a convex (concave) function.
3. A non-constant convex (resp., concave) function f(x) on a segment [a, b] cannot
attain its largest (resp., smallest) value inside the segment.
4. A function f(x) that is continuous on a segment [a, b] and twice differentiable on the
interval (a, b) is convex downward (resp., convex upward) if and only if f ′′(x) ≥0 (resp.,
f ′′(x) ≤0) on that interval.
M6.1.7. Convergence of Functions
◮Pointwise, uniform, and nonuniform convergence of functions. Let {fn(x)} be a
sequence of functions deﬁned on a set X ⊂R. The sequence {fn(x)} is said to be pointwise
convergent to f(x) as n →∞if for any ﬁxed x ∈X, the numerical sequence {fn(x)}
converges to f(x). The sequence {fn(x)} is said to be uniformly convergent to a function
f(x) on X as n →∞if for any ε > 0 there is an integer N = N(ε) such that for all n > N
and all x ∈X, the following inequality holds:
|fn(x) – f(x)| < ε.
(M6.1.7.1)
Note that in this deﬁnition, N is independent of x. For a sequence {fn(x)} pointwise
convergent to f(x) as n →∞, by deﬁnition, for any ε > 0 and any x ∈X, there is
N = N(ε, x) such that (M6.1.7.1) holds for all n > N(ε, x).
If one cannot ﬁnd such an N independent of x and depending only on ε (i.e., one cannot
ensure (M6.1.7.1) uniformly; to be more precise, there is an ε > 0 such that for any N > 0
there is a kN > N and xN ∈X such that |fkN(xN) – f(xN)| ≥ε), then one says that the
sequence {fn(x)} converges nonuniformly to f(x) on the set X.
◮Basic theorems. Let X be an interval on the real axis.
THEOREM. Let fn(x) be a sequence of continuous functions uniformly convergent to
f(x) on X. Then f(x) is continuous on X.
COROLLARY. If the limit function f(x) of a pointwise convergent sequence of contin-
uous functions {fn(x)} is discontinuous, then the convergence of the sequence {fn(x)} is
nonuniform.
Example. The sequence {fn(x)} = {xn} converges to f(x) ≡0 as n →∞uniformly on each segment
[0, a], 0 < a < 1. However, on the segment [0, 1] this sequence converges nonuniformly to the discontinuous
function f(x) =
n 0
for 0 ≤x < 1,
1
for x = 1.
CAUCHY CRITERION. A sequence of functions {fn(x)} deﬁned on a set X ∈R uniformly
converges to f(x) as n →∞if and only if for any ε > 0 there is an integer N = N(ε) > 0
such that for all n > N and m > N, the inequality |fn(x) – fm(x)| < ε holds for all x ∈X.
◮Geometrical meaning of uniform convergence. Let fn(x) be continuous functions on
the segment [a, b] and suppose that {fn(x)} uniformly converges to a continuous function
f(x) as n →∞. Then all curves y = fn(x), for sufﬁciently large n > N, belong to the strip
between the two curves y = f(x) – ε and y = f(x) + ε (see Fig. M6.3).

M6.2. Differential Calculus for Functions of a Single
Variable
M6.2.1. Derivative and Differential: Their Geometrical and Physical
Meaning
◮Deﬁnition of derivative and differential. The derivative of a function y = f(x) at a
point x is the limit of the ratio
y′ = lim
∆x→0
∆y
∆x = lim
∆x→0
f(x + ∆x) – f(x)
∆x
,
where ∆y = f(x+∆x)–f(x) is the increment of the function corresponding to the increment
of the argument ∆x. The derivative y′ is also denoted by y′
x, ˙y, dy
dx , f ′(x), df(x)
dx .
Example 1. Let us calculate the derivative of the function f(x) = x2.
By deﬁnition, we have
f ′(x) = lim
∆x→0
(x + ∆x)2 – x2
∆x
= lim
∆x→0 (2x + ∆x) = 2x.
The increment ∆x is also called the differential of the independent variable x and is
denoted by dx.
A function f(x) that has a derivative at a point x is called differentiable at that point.
The differentiability of f(x) at a point x is equivalent to the condition that the increment
of the function, ∆y = f(x + dx) – f(x), at that point can be represented in the form
∆y = f ′(x) dx + o(dx) (the second term is an inﬁnitely small quantity compared with dx as
dx →0; see Subsection M6.1.4).
A function differentiable at some point x is continuous at that point. The converse is
not true, in general; continuity does not always imply differentiability.
A function f(x) is called differentiable on a set D (interval, segment, etc.) if for any
x ∈D there exists the derivative f ′(x). A function f(x) is called continuously differentiable
on D if it has the derivative f ′(x) at each point x ∈D and f ′(x) is a continuous function
on D.
The differential dy of a function y = f(x) is the principal linear part of its increment ∆y
at the point x, so that dy = f ′(x)dx, ∆y = dy + o(dx).
The approximate relation ∆y ≈dy or f(x + ∆x) ≈f(x) + f ′(x)∆x (for small ∆x) is
often used in numerical analysis.

1◦. Let y = f(x) be the function describing the path y traversed by a body by the time x.
Then the derivative f ′(x) is the velocity of the body at the instant x.
2◦. The tangent line or simply the tangent to the graph of the function y = f(x) at a point
M(x0, y0), where y0 = f(x0), is deﬁned as the straight line determined by the limit position

the x-axis and the tangent line, then f ′(x0) = tan α is the slope ratio of the tangential line
(Fig. M6.4).

◮Main theorems about differentiable functions.
ROLLE THEOREM. If the function y = f(x) is continuous on the segment [a, b], differ-
entiable on the interval (a, b), and f(a) = f(b), then there is a point c ∈(a, b) such that
f ′(c) = 0.
LAGRANGE THEOREM. If the function y = f(x) is continuous on the segment [a, b] and
differentiable on the interval (a, b), then there is a point c ∈(a, b) such that
f(b) – f(a) = f ′(c)(b – a).
This relation is called the formula of ﬁnite increments.
CAUCHY THEOREM. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions that are continuous on the
segment [a, b], differentiable on the interval (a, b), and g′(x) ≠0 for all x ∈(a, b). Then
there is a point c ∈(a, b) such that
f(b) – f(a)
g(b) – g(a) = f ′(c)
g′(c) .
◮L’Hospital’s rules on indeterminate expressions of the form 0/0 and ∞/∞.
THEOREM 1. Let f(x) and g(x) be two functions deﬁned in a neighborhood of a point
a, vanishing at this point, f(a) = g(a) = 0, and having the derivatives f ′(a) and g′(a), with
g′(a) ≠0. Then

Here, both the numerator and the denominator vanish for x = 0. Let us calculate the derivatives
f ′(x) = (sin x)′ = cos x
=⇒
f ′(0) = 1,
g′(x) = (1 – e–2x)′ = 2e–2x
=⇒
g′(0) = 2 ≠0.
By the L’Hospital rule, we ﬁnd that

THEOREM 3. Let f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions and g′(x) ≠0 in a neighbor-

The derivative of the second derivative of a function y = f(x) is called the third-order

M6.2.5. Extremal Points. Points of Inﬂection
◮Maximum and minimum. Points of extremum. Let f(x) be a differentiable function
on the interval (a, b) and f ′(x) > 0 (resp., f ′(x) < 0) on (a, b). Then f(x) is an increasing
(resp., decreasing) function on that interval*.
Suppose that there is a neighborhood of a point x0 such that for all x ≠x0 in that
neighborhood we have f(x) > f(x0) (resp., f(x) < f(x0)). Then x0 is called a point of local
minimum (resp., local maximum) of the function f(x).
Points of local minimum or maximum are called points of extremum.
* At some isolated points of the interval, the derivative may vanish.

M6.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS FOR FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE
157
◮Necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of extremum. Suppose that
f(x) is continuous in some neighborhood (x0 – δ, x0 + δ) of a point x0 and differentiable
at all points of the neighborhood except, possibly, x0.
NECESSARY CONDITION OF EXTREMUM. A function f(x) can have an extremum only at
points in which its derivative either vanishes or does not exist (or is inﬁnite).
FIRST SUFFICIENT CONDITION OF EXTREMUM. If f ′(x) > 0 for x ∈(x0 – δ, x0) and
f ′(x) < 0 for x ∈(x0, x0 + δ), then x0 is a point of local maximum of this function. If
f ′(x) < 0 for x ∈(x0 – δ, x0) and f ′(x) > 0 for x ∈(x0, x0 + δ), then x0 is a point of local
minimum of this function.
If f ′(x) is of the same sign for all x ≠x0, x ∈(x0 – δ, x0 + δ), then x0 cannot be a point
of extremum.
SECOND SUFFICIENT CONDITION OF EXTREMUM.
Let f(x) be a twice differentiable
function in a neighborhood of x0. Then the following statements hold:
(i)
f ′(x0) = 0 and f ′′(x0) < 0
=⇒
f(x) has a local maximum at the point x0;
(ii)
f ′(x0) = 0 and f ′′(x0) > 0
=⇒
f(x) has a local minimum at the point x0.
THIRD SUFFICIENT CONDITION OF EXTREMUM. Let f(x) be a function that is n times
differentiable in a neighborhood of a point x0 and f ′(x0) = f ′′(x0) = · · · = f (n–1)(x0) = 0,
but f (n)(x0) ≠0. Then the following statements hold:
(i)
n is even and f (n)(x0) < 0
=⇒
f(x) has a local maximum at the point x0;
(ii)
n is even and f (n)(x0) > 0
=⇒
f(x) has a local minimum at the point x0.
If n is odd, then x0 cannot be a point of extremum.
◮Largest and the smallest values of a function. Let y = f(x) be continuous on the
segment [a, b] and differentiable at all points of this segment except, possibly, ﬁnitely many
points. Then the largest and the smallest values of f(x) on [a, b] belong to the set consisting
of f(a), f(b), and the values f(xi), where xi ∈(a, b) are the points at which f ′(x) is either
equal to zero or does not exist (is inﬁnite).
◮Direction of the convexity of the graph of a function. The graph of a differentiable
function y = f(x) is said to be convex upward (resp., convex downward) on the interval
(a, b) if for each point of this interval, the graph lies below (resp., above) the tangent line at
that point.
If the function y = f(x) is twice differentiable on the interval (a, b) and f ′′(x) < 0 (resp.,
f ′′(x) > 0), then its graph is convex upward (resp., downward) on that interval. (At some
isolated points of the interval, the second derivative may vanish.)
Thus, in order to ﬁnd the intervals on which the graph of a twice differentiable function
f(x) is convex upward (resp., downward), one should solve the inequality f ′′(x) < 0 (resp.,
f ′′(x) > 0).
◮Inﬂection points. An inﬂection point on the graph of a function y = f(x) is deﬁned as
a point (x0, f(x0)) at which the graph passes from one side of its tangent line to another.
At an inﬂection point, the graph changes the direction of its convexity.
Suppose that the function y = f(x) has a continuous second derivative f ′′(x) in some
neighborhood of a point x0. If f ′′(x0) = 0 and f ′′(x) changes sign as x passes through the
point x0, then (x0, f(x0)) is an inﬂection point.

LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
M6.2.6. Qualitative Analysis of Functions and Construction of
Graphs
◮General scheme of analysis of a function and construction of its graph.
1. Determine the domain in which the function is deﬁned.
2. Determine whether the function is odd or even and whether it is periodic.
3. Find the points at which the graph crosses the coordinate axes.
4. Find the asymptotes of the graph.
5. Find extremal points and intervals of monotonicity.
6. Determine the directions of convexity of the graph and its inﬂection points.
7. Draw the graph, using the properties 1 to 6.
Example. Let us examine the function y = ln x
x
and construct its graph.
We use the above general scheme.
1. This function is deﬁned for all x such that 0 < x < +∞.
2. This function is neither odd nor even, since it is deﬁned only for x > 0 and the relations f(–x) = f(x)
or f(–x) = –f(x) cannot hold. Obviously, this function is nonperiodic.
3. The graph of this function does not cross the y-axis, since for x = 0 the function is undeﬁned. Further,
y = 0 only if x = 1, i.e., the graph crosses the x-axis only at the point (1, 0).
4. The straight line x = 0 is a vertical asymptote, since lim
x→+0
ln x
x
= –∞. We ﬁnd the oblique asymptotes:
k =
lim
x→+∞
y
x = 0,
b =
lim
x→+∞(y – kx) = 0.
Therefore, the line y = 0 is a horizontal asymptote of the graph.
5. The derivative y′ = 1 – ln x
x2
vanishes for ln x = 1. Therefore, the function may have an extremum at
x = e. For x ∈(0, e), we have y′ > 0, i.e., the function is increasing on this interval. For x ∈(e, +∞), we have
y′ < 0, and therefore the function is decreasing on this interval. At x = e the function attains its maximal value
ymax = 1
e .
One should also examine the points at which the derivative does not exist. There is only one such point,
x = 0, and it corresponds to the vertical asymptote (see Item 4).
6. The second derivative y′′ = 2 ln x – 3
x3
vanishes for x = e3/2. On the interval (0, e3/2), we have y′′ < 0,
and therefore the graph is convex upward on this interval. For x ∈(e3/2, +∞), we have y′′ > 0, and therefore
the graph is convex downward on this interval. The value x = e3/2 corresponds to an inﬂection point of the
graph, with the ordinate y = 3
2 e–3/2.
7. Using the above results, we construct the graph (Fig. M6.5).

many cases allow us to construct the graph of a function if we have the graph of a simpler
function.
1. The graph of the function y = f(x) + a is obtained from that of y = f(x) by shifting
the latter along the axis Oy by the distance |a|. For a > 0 the shift is upward, and for a < 0

3. The graph of the function y = –f(x) is obtained from that of y = f(x) by symmetric
reﬂection with respect to the axis Ox (see Fig. M6.6 c).
4. The graph of the function y = f(–x) is obtained from that of y = f(x) by symmetric
reﬂection with respect to the axis Oy (see Fig. M6.6 d).
5. The graph of the function y = f(kx) for k > 1 is obtained from that of y = f(x)
by contracting the latter k times to the axis Oy, and for 0 < k < 1 by extending the latter
1/k times from the axis Oy. The points at which the graph crosses the axis Oy remain
unchanged (see Fig. M6.6 e).
6. The graph of the function y = kf(x) for k > 1 is obtained from that of y = f(x) by
extending the latter k times from the axis Ox, and for 0 < k < 1 by contracting the latter 1/k
times to the axis Ox. The points at which the graph crosses the axis Ox remain unchanged
(see Fig. M6.6 f).
7. The graph of the function y = |f(x)| is obtained from that of y = f(x) by preserving
the parts of the latter for which f(x) ≥0 and symmetric reﬂection, with respect to the axis
Ox, of the parts for which f(x) < 0 (see Fig. M6.6 g).
8. The graph of the inverse function y = f –1(x) is obtained from that of y = f(x) by
symmetric reﬂection with respect to the straight line y = x (see Fig. M6.6 h).
M6.2.7. Approximate Solution of Equations
(Root-Finding Algorithms for Continuous Functions)
◮Preliminaries. For a vast majority of algebraic (transcendental) equations of the form
f(x) = 0,
(M6.2.7.1)
where f(x) is a continuous function, there are no exact formulas for the roots.
When solving the equation approximately, the ﬁrst step is to bracket the roots, i.e., ﬁnd
sufﬁciently small intervals containing exactly one root each. Such an interval [a, b], where
the numbers a and b satisfy the condition f(a)f(b) < 0 (which is assumed to hold in what
follows), can be found, say, graphically.
The second step is to compute successive approximations xn ∈[a, b] (n = 1, 2, . . .) to
the desired root c = lim
n→∞xn, usually by one of the following methods.
◮Bisection method. To ﬁnd the root of equation (M6.2.7.1) on the interval [a, b], we
bisect the interval. If f
 a + b
2

= 0, then c = a + b
2
is the desired root. If f
 a + b
2

≠0,
then of the two intervals
h
a, a + b
2
i
and
h a + b
2
, b
i
we take the one at whose endpoints the
function f(x) has opposite signs. Now we bisect the new, smaller interval, etc. As a result,
we obtain either an exact root of equation (M6.2.7.1) at some step or an inﬁnite sequence
of nested intervals [a1, b1], [a2, b2], . . . such that f(an)f(bn) < 0. The root is given by the
formula c = lim
n→∞an = lim
n→∞bn, and the estimate
0 ≤c – an ≤1
2n (b – a)
is valid.
The following two methods are more efﬁcient.
◮Regula falsi method (false position method). Suppose that the derivatives f ′(x) and
f ′′(x) exist on the interval [a, b] and the inequalities f ′(x) ≠0 and f ′′(x) ≠0 hold for all
x ∈[a, b].

M6.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS FOR FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE

If f ′(a)f ′′(a) > 0, then we take x0 = a for the zero approximation; the subsequent
approximations are given by the formulas
xn+1 = xn –
f(xn)
f(b) – f(xn) (b – xn),
n = 0, 1, . . .
If f ′(a)f ′′(a) < 0, then we take x0 = b for the zero approximation; the subsequent
approximations are given by the formulas
xn+1 = xn –
f(xn)
f(a) – f(xn) (a – xn),
n = 0, 1, . . .
The regula falsi method has the ﬁrst order of local convergence as n →∞, that is,
|xn+1 – c| ≤k|xn – c|,
where k is a constant depending on f(x) and c is the root of equation (M6.2.7.1).
The regula falsi method has a simple geometric interpretation. The straight line (secant)
passing through the points (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)) of the curve y = f(x) meets the abscissa
axis at the point x1; the value xn+1 is the abscissa of the point where the line passing through
the points (x0, f(x0)) and (xn, f(xn)) meets the x-axis (see Fig. M6.7 a).

Figure M6.7. Graphical construction of successive approximations to the root of equation (M6.2.7.1) by the
regula falsi method (a) and the Newton–Raphson method (b).
◮Newton–Raphson method. Suppose that the derivatives f ′(x) and f ′′(x) exist on the
interval [a, b] and the inequalities f ′(x) ≠0 and f ′′(x) ≠0 hold for all x ∈[a, b].
If f(a)f ′′(a) > 0, then we take x0 = a for the zero approximation; if f(b)f ′′(b) > 0, then
x0 = b. The subsequent approximations are computed by the formulas
xn+1 = xn – f(xn)
f ′(xn) ,
n = 0, 1, . . .
If the initial approximation x0 is sufﬁciently close to the desired root c, then the Newton–
Raphson method exhibits quadratic convergence:
|xn+1 – c| ≤M
2m |xn – c|2,
where M = max
a≤x≤b |f ′′(x)| and m = min
a≤x≤b |f ′(x)|.
The Newton–Raphson method has a simple geometric interpretation. The tangent to the
curve y = f(x) through the point (xn, f(xn)) meets the abscissa axis at the point xn+1 (see
Fig. M6.7 b).
The Newton–Raphson method has a higher order of convergence than the regula falsi
method. Hence the former is more often used in practice.

◮Sets on the plane and in space. The distance between two points A and B on the plane
and in space can be deﬁned as follows:
ρ(A, B) =
q
(xA – xB)2 + (yA – yB)2
(on the plane),
ρ(A, B) =
q
(xA – xB)2 + (yA – yB)2 + (zA – zB)2
(in three-dimensional space),
ρ(A, B) =
p
(x1A – x1B)2 + · · · + (xnA – xnB)2
(in n-dimensional space),
where xA, yA and xB, yB, and xA, yA, zA and xB, yB, zB, and x1A, . . . , xnA and
x1B, . . . , xnB are Cartesian coordinates of the respective points.
An ε-neighborhood of a point M0 (on the plane or in space) is the set consisting of all
points M (resp., on the plane or in space) such that ρ(M, M0) < ε, where it is assumed
that ε > 0. An ε-neighborhood of a set K (on the plane or in space) is the set consisting
of all points M (resp., on the plane or in space) such that
inf
M0∈K ρ(M, M0) < ε, where it is
assumed that ε > 0.
An interior point of a set D is a point belonging to D, together with some neighborhood
of that point. An open set is a set containing only interior points. A boundary point of a
set D is a point such that any of its neighborhoods contains points both inside and outside D.
A closed set is a set containing all its boundary points. A set D is called a bounded set
if ρ(A, B) < C for any points A, B ∈D, where C is a constant independent of A, B.
Otherwise (i.e., if there is no such constant), the set D is called unbounded.
◮Functions of two or three variables. A (numerical) function on a set D is, by deﬁnition,
a relation that sets up a correspondence between each point M ∈D and a unique numerical
value. If D is a plane set, then each point M ∈D is determined by two coordinates x, y,
and a function z = f(M) = f(x, y) is called a function of two variables. If D belongs to
a three-dimensional space, then one speaks of a function of three variables. The set D on
which the function is deﬁned is called the domain of the function. For instance, the function
z =
p
1 – x2 – y2 is deﬁned on the closed circle x2 + y2 ≤1, which is its domain.
The graph of a function z = f(x, y) is the surface formed by the points (x, y, f(x, y)) in
three-dimensional space. For instance, the graph of the function z = ax + by + c is a plane,
and the graph of the function z =
p
1 – x2 – y2 is a semisphere.
A level line of a function z = f(x, y) is a line on the plane x, y with the following
property: the function takes one and the same value z = c at all points of that line. Thus, the
equation of a level line has the form f(x, y) = c. A level surface of a function u = f(x, y, z)
is a surface on which the function takes a constant value, u = c; the equation of a level
surface has the form f(x, y, z) = c.
A function f(M) is called bounded on a set D if there is a constant C such that
|f(M)| ≤C for all M ∈D.
◮Limit of a function at a point and its continuity. Let M be a point that comes inﬁnitely
close to some point M0, i.e., ρ = ρ(M0, M) →0. It is possible that the values f(M) come
close to some constant b.
One says that b is the limit of the function f(M) at the point M0 if for any (arbitrarily
small) ε > 0, there is δ > 0 such that for all points M belonging to the domain of the function
and satisfying the inequality 0 < ρ(M0, M) < δ, we have |f(M) – b| < ε. In this case, one
writes
lim
ρ(M,M0)→0 f(M) = b.

M6.3. FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES. PARTIAL DERIVATIVES

A function f(M) is called continuous at a point M0 if
lim
ρ(M,M0)→0 f(M) = f(M0). A
function is called continuous on a set D if it is continuous at each point of D.
Any
continuous function f(M) on a closed bounded set is bounded on that set and attains its
smallest and its largest values on that set.
M6.3.2. Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables
For the sake of brevity, we consider the case of a function of two variables. However, all
statements can be easily extended to the case of n variables.
◮Total and partial increments of a function. Partial derivatives. A total increment of
a function z = f(x, y) at a point (x, y) is
∆z = f(x + ∆x, y + ∆y) – f(x, y),
where ∆x, ∆y are increments of the independent variables. Partial increments in x and in
y are, respectively,
∆xz = f(x + ∆x, y) – f(x, y),
∆yz = f(x, y + ∆y) – f(x, y).
Partial derivatives of a function z with respect to x and to y at a point (x, y) are deﬁned
as follows:
∂z
∂x = lim
∆x→0
∆xz
∆x ,
∂z
∂y = lim
∆y→0
∆yz
∆y
(provided that these limits exist). Partial derivatives are also denoted by zx and zy, ∂xz
and ∂yz, or fx(x, y) and fy(x, y).
◮Differentiable functions. Differential. A function z = f(x, y) is called differentiable
at a point (x, y) if its increment at that point can be represented in the form
∆z = A(x, y)∆x + B(x, y)∆y + o(ρ),
ρ =
q
(∆x)2 + (∆y)2,
where o(ρ) is a quantity of a higher order of smallness compared with ρ as ρ →0 (i.e.,
o(ρ)/ρ →0 as ρ →0). In this case, there exist partial derivatives at the point (x, y), and
zx = A(x, y), zy = B(x, y).
A function that has continuous partial derivatives at a point (x, y) is differentiable at that
point.
The differential dz of a function z = f(x, y) is deﬁned as follows:
dz = fx(x, y)∆x + fy(x, y)∆y.
Taking the differentials dx and dy of the independent variables equal to ∆x and ∆y,
respectively, one can also write dz = fx(x, y) dx + fy(x, y) dy.
The relation ∆z = dz + o(ρ) for small ∆x and ∆y is widely used for approximate
calculations, in particular, for ﬁnding errors in numerical calculations of values of a function.
Example 1. Suppose that the values of the arguments of the function z = x2y5 are known with the error
x = 2 ± 0.01, y = 1 ± 0.01. Let us calculate the approximate value of the function.
We ﬁnd the increment of the function z at the point x = 2, y = 1 for ∆x = ∆y = 0.01, using the formula
∆z ≈dz = 2 ⋅2 ⋅15 ⋅0.01 + 5 ⋅22 ⋅14 ⋅0.01 = 0.24. Therefore, we can accept the approximation z = 4 ± 0.24.
If a function z = f(x, y) is differentiable at a point (x0, y0), then
f(x, y) = f(x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x – x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y – y0) + o(ρ).
Hence, for small ρ (i.e., for x ≈x0, y ≈y0), we obtain the approximate formula
f(x, y) ≈f(x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x – x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y – y0).
The replacement of a function by this linear expression near a given point is called lin-
earization.

164
LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES
◮Composite function. Consider a function z = f(x, y) and let x = x(u, v), y = y(u, v).
Suppose that for (u, v) ∈D, the functions x(u, v), y(u, v) take values for which the function
z = f(x, y) is deﬁned. In this way, one deﬁnes a composite function on the set D, namely,
z(u, v) = f
 x(u, v), y(u, v)

. In this situation, f(x, y) is called the outer function and x(u, v),
y(u, v) are called the inner functions.
Partial derivatives of a composite function are expressed by
∂z
∂u = ∂f
∂x
∂x
∂u + ∂f
∂y

∂u ,

For z = z(t, x, y), let x = x(t), y = y(t). Thus, z is actually a function of only one
variable t. The derivative dz
dt is calculated by
dz
dt = ∂z
∂t + ∂z
∂x
dx
dt + ∂z
∂y
dy
dt .
This derivative, in contrast to the partial derivative ∂z
∂t , is called a total derivative.
◮Second partial derivatives and second differentials. The second partial derivatives
of a function z = f(x, y) are deﬁned as the derivatives of its ﬁrst partial derivatives and are
denoted as follows:
∂2z
∂x2 = zxx ≡(zx)x,
∂2z
∂x ∂y = zxy ≡(zx)y,
∂2z
∂y ∂x = zyx ≡(zy)x,
∂2z
∂y2 = zyy ≡(zy)y.
The derivatives zxy and zyx are called mixed derivatives.
If the mixed derivatives are
continuous at some point, then they coincide at that point, zxy = zyx.
In a similar way, one deﬁnes higher-order partial derivatives.
The second differential of a function z = f(x, y) is the expression
d2z = d(dz) = (dz)x∆x + (dz)y∆y = zxx(∆x)2 + 2zxy∆x∆y + zyy(∆y)2.
In a similar way, one deﬁnes d3z, d4z, etc.
◮Implicit functions and their differentiation. Consider the equation F(x, y) = 0 with
a solution (x0, y0). Suppose that the derivative Fy(x, y) is continuous in a neighborhood
of the point (x0, y0) and Fy(x, y) ≠0 in that neighborhood. Then the equation F(x, y) = 0
deﬁnes a continuous function y = y(x) (called an implicit function) of the variable x in a
neighborhood of the point x0. Moreover, if in a neighborhood of (x0, y0) there exists a
continuous derivative Fx, then the implicit function y = y(x) has a continuous derivative
expressed by dy
dx = – Fx
Fy
.
Consider the equation F(x, y, z) = 0 that establishes a relation between the variables
x, y, z. If F(x0, y0, z0) = 0 and in a neighborhood of the point (x0, y0, z0) there exist contin-
uous partial derivatives Fx, Fy, Fz such that Fz(x0, y0, z0) ≠0, then equation F(x, y, z) = 0,
in a neighborhood of (x0, y0), has a unique solution z = ϕ(x, y) such that ϕ(x0, y0) = z0;

Example 2. For the equation x sin y + z + ez = 0 we have Fz = 1 + ez ≠0. Therefore, this equation

◮Jacobian. Dependent and independent functions. Invertible transformations.
1◦. Two functions f(x, y) and g(x, y) are called dependent if there is a function Φ(z) such
that g(x, y) = Φ(f(x, y)); otherwise, the functions f(x, y) and g(x, y) are called independent.

(M6.3.2.1)
1) If the Jacobian (M6.3.2.1) in a domain D is identically equal to zero, then the
functions f(x, y) and g(x, y) are dependent in D.
2) If the Jacobian (M6.3.2.1) is nonzero in D, then the functions f(x, y) and g(x, y) are
independent in D.
2◦. Functions fk(x1, x2, . . . , xn), k = 1, 2, . . . , n, are called dependent in a domain D if
there is a function Φ(z1, z2, . . . , zn) such that
Φ

otherwise, these functions are called independent.

(M6.3.2.2)
The functions fk(x1, x2, . . . , xn) are dependent in a domain D if the Jacobian (M6.3.2.2)
is identically equal to zero in D. The functions fk(x1, x2, . . . , xn) are independent in D if
the Jacobian (M6.3.2.2) does not vanish in D.
3◦. Consider the transformation
yk = fk(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(M6.3.2.3)
Suppose that the functions fk are continuously differentiable and the Jacobian (M6.3.2.2)
differs from zero at a point (x◦
1, x◦
2, . . . , x◦
n). Then, in a sufﬁciently small neighborhood of
this point, equations (M6.3.2.3) specify a one-to-one correspondence between the points
of that neighborhood and the set of points (y1, y2, . . . , yn) consisting of the values of
the functions (M6.3.2.3) in the corresponding neighborhood of the point (y◦
1, y◦
2, . . . , y◦

This means that the system (M6.3.2.3) is locally solvable in a neighborhood of the point
(x◦

n), i.e., the following representation holds:
xk = gk(y1, y2, . . . , yn),
k = 1, 2, . . . , n,
where gk are continuously differentiable functions in the corresponding neighborhood of
the point (y◦

M6.3.3. Directional Derivative. Gradient. Geometrical Applications
◮Directional derivative. One says that a scalar ﬁeld is deﬁned in a domain D if any
point M(x, y) of that domain is associated with a certain value z = f(M) = f(x, y). Thus,
a thermal ﬁeld and a pressure ﬁeld are examples of scalar ﬁelds. A level line of a scalar
ﬁeld is a level line of the function that speciﬁes the ﬁeld (see Subsection M6.3.1). Thus,
isothermal and isobaric curves are, respectively, level lines of thermal and pressure ﬁelds.
In order to examine the behavior of a ﬁeld z = f(x, y) at a point M0(x0, y0) in the
direction of a vector a = {a1, a2}, one should construct a straight line passing through
M0 in the direction of the vector a (this line can be speciﬁed by the parametric equations
x = x0 +a1t, y = y0 +a2t) and study the function z(t) = f(x0 +a1t, y0 +a2t). The derivative
of the function z(t) at the point M0 (i.e., for t = 0) characterizes the change rate of the ﬁeld
at that point in the direction a. Dividing z′(0) by |a| =
p
a2
1 + a2
2, we obtain the so-called
derivative in the direction a of the given ﬁeld at the given point:
∂f
∂a = 1
|a|

a1fx(x0, y0) + a2fy(x0, y0)

.
The gradient of the scalar ﬁeld z = f(x, y) is, by deﬁnition, the vector-valued function
grad f = fx(x, y)i + fy(x, y)j,
where i and j are unit vectors along the coordinate axes x and y.
At each point, the
gradient of a scalar ﬁeld is orthogonal to the level line passing through that point. The
gradient indicates the direction of maximal growth of the ﬁeld. In terms of the gradient, the
directional derivative can be expressed as follows:
∂f
∂a = a
|a| grad f.
The gradient is also denoted by ∇f = grad f.
Remark. The above facts for a plane scalar ﬁeld obviously can be extended to the case of a spatial scalar
ﬁeld.
◮Geometrical applications of the theory of functions of several variables.
1. The equation of the tangent plane to the surface z = f(x, y) at a point (x0, y0, z0),
where z0 = f(x0, y0), has the form
z = f(x0, y0) + fx(x0, y0)(x – x0) + fy(x0, y0)(y – y0).
The vector of the normal to the surface at that point is
n =

–fx(x0, y0), –fy(x0, y0), 1
	
.
2. If a surface is deﬁned by the equation Φ(x, y, z) = 0, then the equation of its tangent
plane at the point (x0, y0, z0) has the form
Φx(x0, y0, z0)(x – x0) + Φy(x0, y0, z0)(y – y0) + Φz(x0, y0, z0)(z – z0) = 0.
A normal vector to the surface at this point is
n =

Φx(x0, y0, z0), Φy(x0, y0, z0), Φz(x0, y0, z0)
	
.
3. Consider a surface deﬁned by the parametric equations
x = x(u, v),
y = y(u, v),
z = z(u, v)
or, in vector form, r= r(u, v), where r = {x, y, z}, and let M0
 x(u0, v0), y(u0, v0), z(u0, v0)

be the point of the surface corresponding to the parameter values u = u0, v = v0. Then the
vector of the normal to the surface at the point M0 can be expressed by

M6.3.4. Extremal Points of Functions of Several Variables
◮Conditions of extremum of a function of two variables.
1◦. Points of minimum, maximum, or extremum. A point (x0, y0) is called a point of local
minimum (resp., maximum) of a function z = f(x, y) if there is a neighborhood of (x0, y0)
in which the function is deﬁned and satisﬁes the inequality f(x, y) > f(x0, y0) (resp.,
f(x, y) < f(x0, y0)). Points of maximum or minimum are called points of extremum.
2◦. A necessary condition of extremum. If a function has the ﬁrst partial derivatives at a
point of its extremum, these derivatives must vanish at that point. It follows that in order
to ﬁnd points of extremum of such a function z = f(x, y), one should ﬁnd solutions of the
system of equations
fx(x, y) = 0,
fy(x, y) = 0.
The points whose coordinates satisfy this system are called stationary points. Any point of
extremum of a differentiable function is its stationary point, but not every stationary point
is a point of its extremum.
3◦. Sufﬁcient conditions of extremum are used for the identiﬁcation of points of extremum
among stationary points. Some conditions of this type are given below.
Suppose that the function z = f(x, y) has continuous second derivatives at a stationary
point. Let us calculate the following quantity at this point:
∆= fxxfyy – f 2
xy.
The following statements hold:
1)
If
∆> 0,
fxx > 0,
then the stationary point is a point of local minimum;
2)
If
∆> 0,
fxx < 0,
then the stationary point is a point of local maximum;
3)
If
∆< 0,
then the stationary point cannot be a point of extremum.
In the degenerate case, ∆= 0, a more delicate analysis of a stationary point is required. In
this case, a stationary point may happen to be a point of extremum and may not.
Remark. In order to ﬁnd points of extremum, one should check not only stationary points, but also points
at which the ﬁrst derivatives do not exist or are inﬁnite.
4◦. The smallest and the largest values of a function. Let f(x, y) be a continuous function
in a closed bounded domain D. Any such function takes its smallest and its largest values
in D.
If the function has partial derivatives in D, except at some points, then the follow-
ing method can be helpful for determining the coordinates of the points (xmin, ymin) and
(xmax, ymax) at which the function attains its minimum and maximum, respectively. One
should ﬁnd all internal stationary points and all points at which the derivatives are inﬁnite
or do not exist. Then one should calculate the values of the function at these points and
compare these with its values at the boundary points of the domain, and then choose the
largest and the smallest values.
◮Extremal points of functions of three variables. For functions of three variables,
points of extremum are deﬁned in exactly the same way as for functions of two variables.
Let us brieﬂy describe the scheme of ﬁnding extremal points of a function u = Φ(x, y, z).
Finding solutions of the system of equations
Φx(x, y, z) = 0,
Φy(x, y, z) = 0,

The following statements hold:
1) If ∆1 > 0, ∆2 > 0, ∆3 > 0, then the stationary point is a point of local minimum;
2) If ∆1 < 0, ∆2 > 0, ∆3 < 0, then the stationary point is a point of local maximum.
◮Conditional extremum of a function of two variables. Lagrange function. A point
(x0, y0) is called a point of conditional or constrained minimum (resp., maximum) of a
function
z = f(x, y)
(M6.3.4.1)
under the additional condition*
ϕ(x, y) = 0
(M6.3.4.2)
if there is a neighborhood of the point (x0, y0) in which f(x, y) > f(x0, y0) (resp., f(x, y) <
f(x0, y0)) for all points (x, y) satisfying the condition (M6.3.4.2).
For the determination of points of conditional extremum, it is common to use the
Lagrange function
Φ(x, y, λ) = f(x, y) + λϕ(x, y),
where λ is the so-called Lagrange multiplier. Solving the system of three equations (the
last equation coincides with the condition (M6.3.4.2))
∂Φ
∂x = 0,
∂Φ
∂y = 0,
∂Φ
∂λ = 0,
one ﬁnds stationary points of the Lagrange function (and also the value of the multiplier λ).
The stationary points may happen to be points of extremum. The above system yields
only necessary conditions of extremum, but these conditions may be insufﬁcient; it may
happen that there is no extremum at some stationary points. However, with the help of other
properties of the function under consideration, it is often possible to establish the character
of a critical point.
Example 1. Let us ﬁnd an extremum of the function
z = xny,
(M6.3.4.3)
under the condition
x + y = a
(a > 0, n > 0, x ≥0, y ≥0).
(M6.3.4.4)
Taking ϕ(x, y) = x + y – a, we construct the Lagrange function
Φ(x, y, λ) = xny + λ(x + y – a).
Solving the system of equations
Φx ≡nxn–1y + λ = 0,
Φy ≡xn + λ = 0,
Φλ ≡x + y – a = 0,
we ﬁnd the coordinates of a unique stationary point,
x◦=
an
n + 1 ,
y◦=
a
n + 1 ,
λ◦= –
 an
n + 1
n
,
which corresponds to the conditional maximum of the given function, zmax =
an+1nn
(n + 1)n+1 .
* This condition is also called a constraint.

Remark. In order to ﬁnd points of conditional extremum of functions of two variables, it is often convenient
to express the variable y through x (or vice versa) from the additional equation (M6.3.4.2) and substitute the
resulting expression into the right-hand side of (M6.3.4.1). In this way, the original problem is reduced to the
problem of extremum for a function of a single variable.
Example 2. Consider again the extremum problem of Example 1 for the function of two variables
(M6.3.4.3) with the constraint (M6.3.4.4). After the elimination of the variable y from (M6.3.4.3)–(M6.3.4.4),
the original problem is reduced to the extremum problem for the function z = xn(a – x) of one variable.
◮Conditional extrema of functions of several variables.
Consider a function u =
f(x1, . . . , xn) of n variables under the condition that x1, . . . , xn satisfy m equations
(m < n):







ϕ1(x1, . . . , xn) = 0,
ϕ2(x1, . . . , xn) = 0,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,
ϕm(x1, . . . , xn) = 0.
In order to ﬁnd the values of x1, . . . , xn for which f may have a conditional maximum or
minimum, one should construct the Lagrange function
Φ(x1, . . . , xn; λ1, . . . , λm) = f + λ1ϕ1 + λ2ϕ2 + · · · + λmϕm
and equate to zero its ﬁrst partial derivatives with respect to the variables x1, . . . , xn and the
parameters λ1, . . . , λm. From the resulting n+m equations, one ﬁnds x1, . . . , xn (and also
the values of the unknown Lagrange multipliers λ1, . . . , λm). As in the case of functions of
two variables, the question whether the given function has points of conditional extremum
can be answered on the basis of additional investigation.
Example 3. Consider the problem of ﬁnding the shortest distance from the point (x0, y0, z0) to the plane
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.
(M6.3.4.5)
The squared distance between the points (x0, y0, z0) and (x, y, z) is equal to
R2 = (x – x0)2 + (y – y0)2 + (z – z0)2.
(M6.3.4.6)
In our case, the coordinates (x, y, z) should satisfy equation (M6.3.4.5) (this point should belong to the plane).
Thus, our problem is to ﬁnd the minimum of the expression (M6.3.4.6) under the condition (M6.3.4.5). The
Lagrange function has the form
Φ = (x – x0)2 + (y – y0)2 + (z – z0)2 + λ(Ax + By + Cz + D).
Equating to zero the derivatives of Φ with respect to x, y, z, and λ, we obtain the following system of algebraic
equations:
2(x – x0) + Aλ = 0,
2(y – y0) + Bλ = 0,
2(z – z0) + Cλ = 0,
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0.
Its solution has the form
x = x0 – 1
2 Aλ,
y = y0 – 1
2 Bλ,
z = z0 – 1
2 Cλ,
λ = 2(Ax0 + By0 + Cz0 + D)
A2 + B2 + C2
.
(M6.3.4.7)
Thus we have a unique answer, and since the distance between a given point and the plane can be realized at a
single point (x, y, z), the values obtained should correspond to that distance. Substituting the values (M6.3.4.7)
into (M6.3.4.6), we ﬁnd the squared distance
R2 = (Ax0 + By0 + Cz0 + D)2
A2 + B2 + C2
.

M6.3.5. Differential Operators of the Field Theory

commonly known as the nabla vector operator or the gradient operator, is the symbolic
vector
∇= i ∂
∂x + j ∂
∂y + k ∂
∂z .
This vector can be used for expressing the following differential operators:
1) gradient of a scalar function u(x, y, z):
grad u = i ∂u
∂x + j ∂u
∂y + k ∂u
∂z = ∇u;
2) divergence of a vector ﬁeld a = P i + Q j + R k:
div a = ∂P

Each scalar ﬁeld u(x, y, z) generates a vector ﬁeld grad u. A vector ﬁeld a(x, y, z)
generates two ﬁelds: the scalar ﬁeld div a and the vector ﬁeld curl a.
◮Second-order differential operators. The following differential identities hold:
1)

Integrals
M7.1. Indeﬁnite Integral
M7.1.1. Antiderivative. Indeﬁnite Integral and Its Properties
◮Antiderivative. An antiderivative (or primitive function) of a given function f(x) on
an interval (a, b) is a differentiable function F(x) such that its derivative is equal to f(x) for
all x ∈(a, b):
F ′(x) = f(x).
Example 1. Let f(x) = 2x. Then the functions F(x) = x2 and F1(x) = x2 – 1 are antiderivatives of f(x),
since (x2)′ = 2x and (x2 – 1)′ = 2x.
THEOREM. Any function f(x) continuous on an interval (a, b) has inﬁnitely many con-
tinuous antiderivatives on (a, b). If F(x) is one of them, then any other antiderivative has
the form F(x) + C, where C is a constant.
◮Indeﬁnite integral. The indeﬁnite integral of a function f(x) is the set, F(x) + C, of
all its antiderivatives. This fact is written as
Z
f(x) dx = F(x) + C.
Here, f(x) is called the integrand (or the integrand function). The process of ﬁnding an
integral is called integration. The differential dx indicates that the integration is carried out
with respect to x.
Example 2.
Z
6x2 dx = 2x3 + C, since (2x3)′ = 6x2.
◮Most important corollaries of the deﬁnition of the indeﬁnite integral. Differentiation
is the inverse of integration:
d
dx
Z
f(x) dx

= f(x).
Integration is the inverse of differentiation:*
Z
f ′(x) dx = f(x) + C.
The latter formula serves to make up tables of indeﬁnite integrals. The procedure is
often reversed here: an integral is ﬁrst given in explicit form (i.e., the function f(x) on the
right-hand side is prescribed), and then the integrand is obtained by differentiation.
* Integration recovers the function from its derivative, to an additive constant.

M7.1.3. Integration of Rational Functions
◮Partial fraction decomposition of a rational function.
A rational function (also
known as a rational polynomial function) is a quotient of polynomials:
R(x) = Pn(x)
Qm(x) ,
(M7.1.3.1)
where
Pn(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0,
Qm(x) = bmxm + · · · + b1x + b0.
The fraction (M7.1.3.1) is called proper if m > n and improper if m ≤n.
Every proper fraction (M7.1.3.1) can be decomposed into a sum of partial fractions. To
this end, one should factorize the denominator Qm(x) into irreducible multipliers of the
form
(x – αi)pi,
i = 1, 2, . . . , k;
(M7.1.3.2a)
(x2 + βjx + γj)qj,
j = 1, 2, . . . , s,
(M7.1.3.2b)
where the pi and qj are positive integers satisfying the condition p1+· · ·+pk+2(q1+· · ·+qs)=
m; β2
j –4γj < 0. The rational function (M7.1.3.1) can be represented as a sum of irreducibles
and to each irreducible of the form (M7.1.3.2) there correspond as many terms as the power
pi or qi:
Ai,1
x – αi
+
Ai,2
(x – αi)2 + · · · +
Ai,pi
(x – αi)pi ;
(M7.1.3.3a)

Bj,2x + Dj,2
(x2 + βjx + γj)2 + · · · +
Bj,qjx + Dj,qj
(x2 + βjx + γj)qj .
(M7.1.3.3b)
The constants Ai,l, Bj,r, Dj,r are found by the method of undetermined coefﬁcients.
To that end, one should equate the original rational fraction (M7.1.3.1) with the sum of
the above partial fractions (M7.1.3.3) and reduce both sides of the resulting equation to a
common denominator. Then, one collects the coefﬁcients of like powers of x and equates
them with zero, thus arriving at a system of linear algebraic equations for the Ai,l, Bj,r,
and Dj,r.

Example 1. This is an illustration of how a proper fraction can be decomposed into partial fractions:
b5x5 + b4x4 + b3x3 + b2x2 + b1x + b0

◮Integration of a proper fraction.
1◦. To integrate a proper fraction, one should ﬁrst rewrite the integrand (M7.1.3.1) in the
form of a sum of partial fractions. Below are the integrals of most common partial fractions
(M7.1.3.3a) and (M7.1.3.3b) (with qj = 1):

(M7.1.3.4)
The constant of integration C has been omitted here. More complex integrals of partial
fractions (M7.1.3.3b) with qj > 1 can be computed using the formula
Z
Bx + D
(x2 + βx + γ)q dx =
P(x)
(x2 + βx + γ)q–1 + λ
Z
dx
x2 + βx + γ ,
(M7.1.3.5)
where P(x) is a polynomial of degree 2q–3. The coefﬁcients of P(x) and the constant λ can
be found by the method of undetermined coefﬁcients by differentiating formula (M7.1.3.5).
Remark. The following recurrence relation may be used in order to compute the integrals on the left-hand
side in (M7.1.3.5):
Z
Bx + D
(x2 + βx + γ)q dx =
(2D – Bβ)x + Dβ – 2Bγ
(q – 1)(4γ – β2)(x2 + βx + γ)q–1 + (2q – 3)(2D – Bβ)
(q – 1)(4γ – β2)
Z
dx
(x2 + βx + γ)q–1 .
Example 2. Compute the integral
Z
3x2 – x – 2
x3 + 8
dx.
Let us factor the denominator of the integrand, x3 +8 = (x +2)(x2 –2x +4), and perform the partial fraction
decomposition:
3x2 – x – 2
(x + 2)(x2 – 2x + 4) =
A
x + 2 +
Bx + D
x2 – 2x + 4 .
Multiplying both sides by the common denominator and collecting the coefﬁcients of like powers of x, we
obtain
(A + B – 3)x2 + (–2A + 2B + D + 1)x + 4A + 2D + 2 = 0.
Now equating the coefﬁcients of the different powers of x with zero, we arrive at a system of algebraic equations
for A, B, and D:
A + B – 3 = 0,
–2A + 2B + D + 1 = 0,
4A + 2D + 2 = 0.
Its solution is: A = 1, B = 2, D = –3. Hence, we have

M7.2. Deﬁnite Integral
M7.2.1. Basic Deﬁnitions. Classes of Integrable Functions.
Geometrical Meaning of the Deﬁnite Integral
◮Basic deﬁnitions. Let y = f(x) be a bounded function deﬁned on a ﬁnite closed interval
[a, b]. Let us partition this interval into n elementary subintervals deﬁned by a set of points
{x0, x1, . . . , xn} such that a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b. Each subinterval [xk–1, xk] will be
characterized by its length ∆xk = xk – xk–1 and an arbitrarily chosen point ξk ∈[xk–1, xk].
Let us make up an integral sum (a Cauchy–Riemann sum, also known as a Riemann sum)
sn =
n
X
k=1
f(ξk)∆xk
(xk–1 ≤ξk ≤xk).
If, as ∆xk →0 for all k and, accordingly, n →∞, there exists a ﬁnite limit of the
integral sums sn and it depends on neither the way the interval [a, b] was partitioned, nor
the selection of the points ξk, then this limit is denoted
Z b
a f(x) dx and is called the deﬁnite
integral (also the Riemann integral) of the function y = f(x) over the interval [a, b]:
Z b
a
f(x) dx = lim
n→∞sn

max
1≤k≤n ∆xk →0

.
In this case, the function f(x) is called integrable on the interval [a, b].
◮Classes of integrable functions.
1. If a function f(x) is continuous on an interval [a, b], then it is integrable on this
interval.
2. If a bounded function f(x) has ﬁnitely many jump discontinuities on [a, b], then it is
integrable on [a, b].
3. A monotonic bounded function f(x) on [a, b] is always integrable on [a, b].
◮Geometric meaning of the deﬁnite integral. If f(x) ≥0 on [a, b], then the integral
Z b
a f(x) dx is equal to the area of the domain D = {a ≤x ≤b, 0 ≤y ≤f(x)} (the area of the
curvilinear trapezoid shown in Fig. M7.1).

M7.2.2. Properties of Deﬁnite Integrals and Useful Formulas
◮Qualitative properties of integrals.
1. If a function f(x) is integrable on [a, b], then the functions cf(x), with c = const, and
|f(x)| are also integrable on [a, b].
2. If two functions f(x) and g(x) are integrable on [a, b], then their sum, difference,
and product are also integrable on [a, b].
3. If a function f(x) is integrable on [a, b] and its values lie within an interval [c, d],
where a function g(y) is deﬁned and continuous, then the composite function g(f(x)) is also
integrable on [a, b].
4. If a function f(x) is integrable on [a, b], then it is also integrable and on any subin-
terval [α, β] ⊂[a, b].
Conversely, if an interval [a, b] is partitioned into a number of
subintervals and f(x) is integrable on each of the subintervals, then it is integrable on the
whole interval [a, b].
5. If the values of a function are changed at ﬁnitely many points, this will not affect the
integrability of the function and will not change the value of the integral.
◮Properties of integrals in terms of identities.
1. The integral over a zero-length interval is zero:

2. Antisymmetry under the swap of the integration limits:

then the function Φ(x) =

M7.2.3. Asymptotic Formulas for the Calculation of Integrals
Below are some general formulas, involving arbitrary functions and parameters, that may

The integral diverges as ε →0 for α ≥β, that is, lim
ε→0 I(ε) = ∞. In this case, the leading
term of the asymptotic expansion of the integral I(ε) is given by
I(ε) = Γ(β)Γ(α – β)
Γ(α)
f(0)εβ–α + O(εσ)

Suppose the function g(x) attains a maximum on [a, b] at only one point x0 ∈[a, b] and is
differentiable in a neighborhood of x0, with g′(x0) = 0, g′′(x0) ≠0, and f(x0) ≠0. Then the

Under the same conditions, if g(x) attains a maximum at either endpoint, x0 = a or

maximum at only one point x0 = [a, b] and to be differentiable in a neighborhood of x = x0,
with g′(x0) = 0, g′′(x0) ≠0, and f(x0) ≠0. Then the leading asymptotic term of the integral,

there exists a ﬁnite limit lim
b→∞
Z b
a f(x) dx, then it is called a (convergent) improper integral
of f(x) on the interval [a, ∞) and is denoted

M7.2. DEFINITE INTEGRAL
191
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx. Thus, by deﬁnition
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx = lim
b→∞
Z b
a
f(x) dx.
(M7.2.6.1)
If the limit is inﬁnite or does not exist, the improper integral is called divergent.
The geometric meaning of an improper integral is that the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx, with
f(x) ≥0, is equal to the area of the unbounded domain between the curve y = f(x), its
asymptote y = 0, and the straight line x = a on the left.
2◦. Suppose an antiderivative F(x) of the integrand function f(x) is known. Then the
improper integral (M7.2.6.1) is
(i)
convergent if there exists a ﬁnite limit lim
x→∞F(x) = F(∞);
(ii)
divergent if the limit is inﬁnite or does not exist.
In case (i), we have
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx = F(x)
∞
a = F(∞) – F(a).
Example 1. Let us investigate the improper integral I =
Z ∞
a
dx
xλ , a > 0.
The integrand f(x) = x–λ has an antiderivative F(x) =
1
1 – λ x1–λ if λ ≠1. Depending on the value of the
parameter λ, we have
lim
x→∞F(x) =
1
1 – λ lim
x→∞x1–λ =
n 0
if λ > 1,
∞
if λ < 1.
Therefore, if λ > 1, the integral is convergent and is equal to I = F(∞) – F(a) = a1–λ
λ – 1 , and if λ < 1, the
integral is divergent. It is easy to show that the integral is also divergent if λ = 1.
3◦. Improper integrals for other inﬁnite intervals are deﬁned in a similar way:
Z b
–∞
f(x) dx = lim
a→–∞
Z b
a
f(x) dx,
Z ∞
–∞
f(x) dx =
Z c
–∞
f(x) dx +
Z ∞
c
f(x) dx,
where c is an arbitrary number. Note that if either improper integral on the right-hand side
of the latter relation is convergent, then, by deﬁnition, the integral on the left-hand side
is also convergent. If at least one of the integrals on the right-hand side is divergent, the
integral on the left is called divergent.
4◦. Properties 2–4 and 6–9 from Subsection M7.2.2, where a can be equal to –∞and b can
be ∞, apply to improper integrals as well; it is assumed that all quantities on the right-hand
sides exist (the integrals are convergent).
◮Sufﬁcient conditions for convergence of improper integrals. In many problems, it
sufﬁces to establish whether a given improper integral is convergent or not and, if yes,
evaluate it. The theorems presented below can be useful in doing so.

192
INTEGRALS
THEOREM 1 (CAUCHY’S CONVERGENCE CRITERION). For the integral (M7.2.6.1) to be
convergent it is necessary and sufﬁcient that for any ε > 0 there exist a number R such that
the inequality

Z β
α
f(x) dx
 < ε
holds for any β > α > R.
THEOREM 2. If 0 ≤f(x) ≤g(x) for x ≥a, then the convergence of the integral
Z ∞
a
g(x) dx implies the convergence of the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx; moreover,
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx ≤
Z ∞
a
g(x) dx. If the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx is divergent, then the integral
Z ∞
a
g(x) dx is also
divergent.
THEOREM 3. If the integral
Z ∞
a
|f(x)| dx is convergent, then the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx
is also convergent; in this case, the latter integral is called absolutely convergent.
Example 2. The improper integral
Z ∞
1
sin x
x2
dx is absolutely convergent, since
 sin x
x2
 ≤1
x2 and the
integral
Z ∞
1
1
x2 dx is convergent (see Example 1).
THEOREM 4. Let f(x) and g(x) be integrable functions on any ﬁnite interval a ≤x ≤b
and let there exist a limit, ﬁnite or inﬁnite,
lim
x→∞
f(x)
g(x) = K.
Then the following assertions hold:
1. If 0 < K < ∞, both integrals
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx,
Z ∞
a
g(x) dx
(M7.2.6.2)
are convergent or divergent simultaneously.
2. If 0 ≤K < ∞, the convergence of the latter integral in (M7.2.6.2) implies the
convergence of the former integral.
3. If 0<K ≤∞, the divergence of the latter integral in (M7.2.6.2) implies the divergence
of the former integral.
THEOREM 5 (COROLLARY OF THEOREM 4). Given a function f(x), let its asymptotics
for sufﬁciently large x have the form
f(x) = ϕ(x)
xλ
(λ > 0).
Then: (i) if λ > 1 and ϕ(x) ≤c < ∞, then the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x) dx is convergent; (ii) if
λ ≤1 and ϕ(x) ≥c > 0, then the integral is divergent.
THEOREM 6. Let f(x) be an absolutely integrable function on an interval [a, ∞) and let
g(x) be a bounded function on [a, ∞). Then the product f(x)g(x) is an absolutely integrable
function on [a, ∞).
THEOREM 7 (ANALOGUE OF ABEL’S TEST FOR CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SERIES). Let
f(x) be an integrable function on an interval [a, ∞) such that the integral (M7.2.6.1) is

M7.2. DEFINITE INTEGRAL
193
convergent (maybe not absolutely) and let g(x) be a monotonic and bounded function on
[a, ∞). Then the integral
Z ∞
a
f(x)g(x) dx
(M7.2.6.3)
is convergent.
THEOREM 8 (ANALOGUE OF DIRICHLET’S TEST FOR CONVERGENCE OF INFINITE SE-
RIES). Let (i) f(x) be an integrable function on any ﬁnite interval [a, A] and

Z A
a f(x) dx
 ≤K < ∞
(a ≤A < ∞);
(ii) g(x) be a function tending to zero monotonically as x →∞:
lim
x→∞g(x) = 0. Then the
integral (M7.2.6.3) is convergent.
Example 3. Let us show that the improper integral
Z ∞
a
sin x
xλ
dx is convergent for a > 0 and λ > 0.
Set f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x–λ and verify conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 8. We have
(i)

Z A
a
sin x dx
 = |cos a – cos A| ≤2;
(ii)
since λ > 0, the function x–λ is monotonically decreasing and tends to zero as x →∞.
So both conditions of Theorem 8 are met, and therefore the given improper integral is convergent.
M7.2.7. Improper Integrals of Unbounded Functions
◮Basic deﬁnitions.
1◦. Let a function f(x) be deﬁned and continuous for a ≤x < b, but lim
x→b–0 f(x) = ∞. If
there exists a ﬁnite limit
lim
λ→b–0
Z λ
a f(x) dx, it is called the (convergent) improper integral
of the unbounded function f(x) over the interval [a, b]. Thus, by deﬁnition
Z b
a
f(x) dx = lim
λ→b–0
Z λ
a
f(x) dx.
(M7.2.7.1)
If no ﬁnite limit exists, the integral is called divergent.
If lim
x→a+0 f(x) = ∞, then, by deﬁnition, it is assumed that
Z b
a
f(x) dx =
lim
γ→a+0
Z b
γ
f(x) dx.
Finally, if f(x) is unbounded near a point c ∈(a, b) and both integrals
Z c
a f(x) dx and
Z b
c f(x) dx are convergent, then, by deﬁnition,
Z b
a
f(x) dx =
Z c
a
f(x) dx +
Z b
c
f(x) dx.
If at least one of the integrals on the right-hand side is divergent, the integral on the left-hand
side is called divergent.

INTEGRALS
2◦. The geometric meaning of an improper integral of an unbounded function and also
sufﬁcient conditions for convergence of such integrals are similar to those for improper
integrals with inﬁnite limit(s).
◮Convergence tests for improper integrals of unbounded functions. Presented below
are theorems for the case where the only singular point of the integrand function is the right
endpoint of the interval [a, b].
THEOREM 1 (CAUCHY’S CONVERGENCE CRITERION). For the integral (M7.2.7.1) to be
convergent it is necessary and sufﬁcient that for any ε > 0 there exist a number δ > 0 such
that for any δ1 and δ2 satisfying 0 < δ1 < δ and 0 < δ2 < δ the following inequality holds:

Z b–δ2
b–δ1
f(x) dx
 < ε.
THEOREM 2. If 0 ≤f(x) ≤g(x) for a ≤x < b, then the convergence of the inte-
gral
Z b
a g(x) dx implies the convergence of the integral
Z b
a f(x) dx, with
Z b
a f(x) dx ≤
Z b
a g(x) dx. If the integral
Z b
a f(x) dx is divergent, then the integral
Z b
a g(x) dx is also
divergent.
Example. For any continuous function ϕ(x) such that ϕ(1) = 0, the improper integral
Z 1
0
dx
ϕ2(x) +
√
1 – x
is convergent and does not exceed 2, since

√
1 – x
, while the integral
Z 1
0
dx
√
1 – x
is
convergent and is equal to 2.
THEOREM 3. Let f(x) and g(x) be continuous functions on [a, b) and let the following
limit exist:
lim
x→b
f(x)
g(x) = K
(0 < K < ∞).
Then both integrals
Z b
a f(x) dx,
Z b
a g(x) dx
are either convergent or divergent simultaneously.
THEOREM 4. Let a function f(x) be representable in the form
f(x) =
ϕ(x)
(b – x)λ
(λ > 0),
where ϕ(x) is continuous on [a, b] and the condition ϕ(b) ≠0 holds.
Then: (i) if λ < 1 and ϕ(x) ≤c < ∞, then the integral
Z b
a f(x) dx is convergent; (ii) if
λ ≥1 and ϕ(x) ≥c > 0, then this integral is divergent.
M7.2.8. Approximate (Numerical) Methods for Computation of
Deﬁnite Integrals
For approximate computation of an integral like
Z b

[a, b] into n equal subintervals with length h = b – a

M7.3. Double and Triple Integrals
M7.3.1. Deﬁnition and Properties of the Double Integral
◮Deﬁnition and properties of the double integral. Suppose there is a bounded set of
points deﬁned on the plane, so that it can be placed in a minimal enclosing circle. The
diameter of this circle is called the diameter of the set. Consider a domain D in the xy-
plane. Let us partition D into n nonintersecting subdomains (cells). The largest of the cell
diameters is called the partition diameter and is denoted λ = λ(Dn), where Dn stands for
the partition of the domain D into cells. Let a function z = f(x, y) be deﬁned in D. Select
an arbitrary point in each cell (xi, yi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and make up an integral sum,
sn =
n
X
i=1
f(xi, yi) ∆Si,
where ∆Si is the area of the ith subdomain.
If there exists a ﬁnite limit, J , of the sums sn as λ →0 and it depends on neither the
partition Dn nor the selection of the points (xi, yi), this limit is denoted
ZZ
D f(x, y) dx dy
and is called the double integral of the function f(x, y) over the domain D:
ZZ
D
f(x, y) dx dy = lim
λ→0 sn.
This means that for any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that for all partitions Dn such that
λ(Dn) < δ and for any selection of the points (xi, yi), the inequality |sn – J | < ε holds. In
this case, the function f(x, y) is called integrable over the domain D.

◮Classes of integrable functions. Further on, it is assumed that D is a closed bounded
domain.
1. If f(x, y) is continuous in D, then the double integral
ZZ
D f(x, y) dx dy exists.
2. If f(x, y) is bounded and the set of points of discontinuity of f(x, y) has a zero area
(e.g., the points of discontinuity lie on ﬁnitely many continuous curves in the xy-plane),
then the double integral of f(x, y) over the domain D exists.
◮Properties of the double integral.

ZZ
D
f(x, y) dx dy = f(¯x, ¯y) S.
The number f(¯x, ¯y) is called the mean value of the function f(x, y) in D.

M7.3.4. Deﬁnition and Properties of the Triple Integral
◮Deﬁnition of the triple integral. Let a function f(x, y, z) be deﬁned in a domain U of
the three-dimensional space. Let us break up U into n subdomains (cells) that do not have
common internal points. Denote by λ = λ(Un) the diameter of the resulting partition Un, i.e.,
the maximum of the cell diameters (the diameter of a domain in space is the diameter of the
minimal sphere enclosing the domain). Select an arbitrary point, (xi, yi, zi), i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
in each cell and make up an integral sum
sn =
n
X
i=1
f(xi, yi, zi) ∆Vi,
where ∆Vi is the volume of the ith cell.
If there exists a ﬁnite limit of the sums sn
as λ(Un) →0 that depends on neither the partition Un nor the selection of the points
(xi, yi, zi), then it is called the triple integral of the function f(x, y, z) over the domain U
and is denoted
ZZZ
U
f(x, y, z) dx dy dz = lim
λ→0 sn.
◮Properties of the triple integral. The properties of triple integrals are similar to those
of double integrals.

Chapter M8
Series
M8.1. Numerical Series and Inﬁnite Products
M8.1.1. Convergent Numerical Series and Their Properties.
Cauchy’s Criterion
◮Basic deﬁnitions. Let {an} be a numerical sequence. The expression
a1 + a2 + · · · + an + · · · =
∞
X
n=1
an
is called a numerical series (inﬁnite sum, inﬁnite numerical series), an is the generic term
of the series, and
sn = a1 + a2 + · · · + an =
n
X
k=1
ak
is the nth partial sum of the series. If there exists a ﬁnite limit lim
n→∞sn = S, the series
is called convergent, and S is called the sum of the series.
In this case, one writes
∞
P
n=1
an = S. If
lim
n→∞sn does not exist (or is inﬁnite), the series is called divergent. The
series an+1 + an+2 + an+3 + · · · is called the nth remainder of the series.
Example 1. Consider the series
∞
P
n=1
aqn–1 = a + aq + aq2 + · · · whose terms form a geometric progression
with ratio q. This series is convergent for |q| < 1 (its sum has the form S =
a
1–q ) and is divergent for |q| ≥1.
◮Necessary condition for a series to be convergent. Cauchy’s criterion.
1. A necessary condition for a series to be convergent. For a convergent series
∞
P
n=1
an,
the generic term must tend to zero, lim
n→∞an = 0. If lim
n→∞an ≠0, then the series is divergent.
Example 2. The series
∞
P
n=1
cos 1
n is divergent, since its generic term an = cos 1
n does not tend to zero as
n →∞.
The above necessary condition is insufﬁcient for the convergence of a series.
Example 3. Consider the series
∞
P
n=1
1
√n . Its generic term tends to zero,
lim
n→∞
1
√n = 0, but the series
∞
P
n=1
1
√n is divergent because its partial sums are unbounded,
sn =
1
√
1
+
1
√
2
+ · · · +

√n > n 1
√n = √n →∞
as
n →∞.
2. Cauchy’s criterion of convergence of a series. A series
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent if and
only if for any ε > 0 there exists an N = N(ε) such that for all n > N and any positive
integer k, the following inequality holds: |an+1 + · · · + an+k| < ε.
211

212
SERIES
◮Properties of convergent series.
1. If a series is convergent, then any of its remainders is convergent.
Removal or
addition of ﬁnitely many terms does not affect the convergence of a series.
2. If all terms of a series are multiplied by a nonzero constant, the resulting series
preserves the property of convergence or divergence (its sum is multiplied by that constant).
3. If the series
∞
P
n=1
an and
∞
P
n=1
bn are convergent and their sums are equal to S1 and S2,
respectively, then the series
∞
P
n=1
(an ± bn) are convergent and their sums are equal to S1 ± S2.
4. Terms of a convergent series can be grouped in successive order; the resulting series
has the same sum. In other words, one can insert brackets inside a series in an arbitrary
order. The inverse operation of opening brackets is not always admissible. Thus, the series
(1–1)+(1–1)+· · · is convergent (its sum is equal to zero), but, after removing the brackets,
we obtain the divergent series 1 – 1 + 1 – 1 + · · · (its generic term does not tend to zero).
M8.1.2. Convergence Criteria for Series with Positive (Nonnegative)
Terms
◮Basic convergence (divergence) criteria for series with positive terms.
1. The ﬁrst comparison criterion. If 0 ≤an ≤bn (starting from some n), then the
convergence of the series
∞
P
n=1
bn implies the convergence of
∞
P
n=1
an; and the divergence of
the series
∞
P
n=1
an implies the divergence of
∞
P
n=1
bn.
2. The second convergence criterion. Suppose that there exists a ﬁnite limit
lim
n→∞
an
bn
= σ,
where 0 < σ < ∞. Then
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent (resp., divergent) if and only if
∞
P
n=1
bn is
convergent (resp., divergent).
Corollary. Suppose that an+1/an ≤bn+1/bn starting from some N (i.e., for n > N).
Then convergence of the series
∞
P
n=1
bn implies convergence of
∞
P
n=1
an, and divergence of
∞
P
n=1
an implies divergence of
∞
P
n=1
bn.
3. D’Alembert criterion. Suppose that there exists the limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite)
lim
n→∞
an+1
an
= D.
If D < 1, then the series
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent. If D > 1, then the series is divergent. For
D = 1, the d’Alembert criterion cannot be used for deciding whether the series is convergent
or divergent.
Example 1. Let us examine the convergence of the series
∞
P
n=1
nkxn with x > 0, using the d’Alembert
criterion. Taking an = nkxn, we get
an+1
an
=

1 + 1
n
k
x →x
as
n →∞.

M8.1. NUMERICAL SERIES AND INFINITE PRODUCTS
213
Therefore, D = x. It follows that the series is convergent for x < 1 and divergent for x > 1. The series is
divergent for x = 1, since an does not tend to zero as n →∞.
4. Cauchy criterion. Suppose that there exists the limit (ﬁnite or inﬁnite)
lim
n→∞
n√an = K.
For K < 1, the series
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent; for K > 1, the series is divergent. For K = 1,
the Cauchy criterion cannot be used to establish convergence of a series.
Remark. The Cauchy criterion is stronger than the d’Alembert criterion, but the latter is, in many cases,
simpler than the former.
5. Gauss’s criterion. Suppose that the ratio of two consecutive terms of a series can be
represented in the form
an
an+1
= λ + µ
n + o
 1
n

as
n →∞.
The series
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent if λ > 1 or if λ = 1 and µ > 1. The series is divergent if λ < 1
or if λ = 1 and µ ≤1.
6. Maclaurin–Cauchy integral criterion.
Let f(x) be a nonnegative nonincreasing
continuous function on the interval 1 ≤x < ∞. Let f(1) = a1, f(2) = a2, . . . , f(n) = an, . . .
Then the series
∞
P
n=1
an is convergent if and only if the improper integral
Z ∞
1
f(x) dx is
convergent.
Example 2. The harmonic series
∞
P
n=1
1
n = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + · · · is divergent, since the integral
Z ∞
1
1
x dx is
divergent. In a similar way, one ﬁnds that the series
∞
X
n=1
1
nα is convergent for α > 1 and divergent for α ≤1.
M8.1.3. Convergence Criteria for Arbitrary Numerical Series.
Absolute and Conditional Convergence
◮Arbitrary series. Leibniz, Abel, and Dirichlet convergence criteria.
1. Leibniz criterion. Suppose that the terms an of a series
∞
P
n=1
an have alternating signs,
their absolute values form a nonincreasing sequence, and an →0 as n →∞. Then this
“alternating” series is convergent. If S is the sum of the series and sn is its nth partial sum,
then the following inequality holds for the error |S – sn| ≤|an+1|.
Example 1. The series 1 – 1
22 + 1
33 – 1
44 + 1
55 – · · · is convergent by the Leibniz criterion. Taking
S ≈s4 = 1 – 1
22 + 1
33 – 1
44 , we obtain the error less than a5 = 1
55 = 0.00032.
2. Abel criterion. Consider the series
∞
X
n=1
anbn = a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn + · · · ,
(M8.1.3.1)
where an and bn are two sequences or real numbers.

214
SERIES
Series (M8.1.3.1) is convergent if the series
∞
X
n=1
bn = b1 + b2 + · · · + bn + · · ·
(M8.1.3.2)
is convergent and the an form a bounded monotone sequence (|an| < K).
3. Dirichlet criterion.
Series (M8.1.3.1) is convergent if partial sums of series
(M8.1.3.2) are bounded uniformly in n,

n
X
k=1
bk
 ≤M
(n = 1, 2, . . . ),
and the sequence an →0 is monotone.
Example 2. Consider the series
∞
P
n=1
an sin(nx), where an →0 is a monotonically decreasing sequence.
Taking bn = sin(nx) and using a well-known identity, we ﬁnd the partial sum
sn =
n

k=1
sin(kx) = cos


x


(x ≠2mπ; m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).
This sum is bounded for x ≠2mπ:
|sn| ≤
1
sin
  1
2 x
 .
Therefore, by the Dirichlet criterion, the series
∞
P
n=1
an sin(nx) is convergent for any x ≠2mπ. Direct veriﬁcation
shows that this series is also convergent for x = 2mπ (since all its terms at these points are equal to zero).
Remark. The Leibniz and the Abel criteria can be deduced from the Dirichlet criterion.
◮Absolute and conditional convergence.
1. Absolutely convergent series. A series
∞
P
n=1
an (with terms of arbitrary sign) is called
absolutely convergent if the series
∞
P
n=1
|an| is convergent.
Any absolutely convergent series is convergent. In order to establish absolute conver-
gence of a series, one can use all convergence criteria for series with nonnegative terms
given in Subsection M8.1.2 (in these criteria, an should be replaced by |an|).
Example 3. The series 1 + 1
22 – 1
32 – 1
42 + 1
52 + 1
62 – · · · is absolutely convergent, since the series with
the absolute values of its terms,
∞
P
n=1
1
n2 , is convergent (see the second series in Example 2 of Subsection M8.1.2
for α = 2).
2. Conditionally convergent series. A convergent series
∞
P
n=1
an is called conditionally
convergent if the series
∞
P
n=1
|an| is divergent.
Example 4. The series 1 – 1
2 + 1
3 – 1
4 + · · · is conditionally convergent, since it is convergent (by the
Leibniz criterion), but the series with absolute values of its terms is divergent (it is a harmonic series; see
Example 2 in Subsection M8.1.2).
Any rearrangement of the terms of an absolutely convergent series (in particular, a
convergent series with nonnegative terms) neither violates its absolute convergence nor
changes its sum. Conditionally convergent series do not possess this property: the terms of
a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged in such order that the sum of the new
series becomes equal to any given value; its terms can also be rearranged so as to result in
a divergent series.

P
n=0
bn is understood as a series whose terms have the form anbm
(n, m = 0, 1, . . .). The products anbm can be ordered to form a series in many different
ways. The following theorems allow us to decide whether it is possible to multiply series.
CAUCHY THEOREM. Suppose that the series

P

an and
∞
P

and their sums are equal to A and B, respectively.
Then any product of these series

one of the series,
∞
P
n=0
an or
∞
P
n=0
bn, is absolutely convergent and the other is (condition-
ally) convergent. In this case, the product is a convergent series, possibly, not absolutely
convergent.
ABEL THEOREM. Consider two convergent series with sums A and B. Suppose that the
product of these series in the form of Cauchy (M8.1.4.1) is a convergent series with sum C.
Then C = AB.

M8.2. Function Series
M8.2.1. Pointwise and Uniform Convergence of Function Series

SERIES
where un(x) are functions deﬁned on a set X ⊂R. The series

P

un(x) is called convergent
at a point x0 ∈X if the numerical series
∞
P
n=1
un(x0) is convergent. The set of all x ∈X for
which the function series is convergent is called its convergence domain. The sum of the
series is a function of x deﬁned on its convergence domain.
Inorder toﬁndtheconvergencedomainfor a function series, one canuse the convergence
criteria for numerical series described in Subsections M8.1.2 and M8.1.3 (with the variable x
regarded as a parameter).
A series
∞
P
n=1
un(x) is called absolutely convergent on a set X if the series
∞
P
n=1
|un(x)| is
convergent on this set.
Example. The function series
1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·
is convergent for –1 < x < 1 (see Example 1 in Subsection M8.1.1). Its sum is deﬁned on this interval, S =
1
1 – x .
The series

P
k=n+1
uk(x) is called the remainder of a function series

un(x). For a series
convergent on a set X, the relation S(x) = sn(x) + rn(x), where sn(x) is the partial sum of
the series and rn(x) is the sum of its remainder, implies that lim
n→∞rn(x) = 0 for x ∈X.
◮Uniformly convergent series. Condition of uniform convergence. A function series
is called uniformly convergent on a set X if for any ε > 0 there exists an N (dependent on ε
but not on x) such that for all n > N, the inequality

M8.2.2. Basic Criteria of Uniform Convergence. Properties of

formly convergent on a set X ⊂R if there is a convergent number series
∞
P

an with

nonnegative terms such that |un(x)| ≤an for all sufﬁciently large n and all x ∈X. The
series
∞
P

an is called a majorant series for
∞
P
n=1
un(x).
Example. The series

P
n=1
(–1)n sin nx

and the numerical series
∞
P
n=1

n2 is convergent (see the second series in Example 2 in Subsection M8.1.2).
2. Abel criterion of uniform convergence of function series. Consider a function series
∞
X
n=1
un(x)vn(x) = u1(x)v1(x) + u2(x)v2(x) + · · · + un(x)vn(x) + · · · ,
(M8.2.2.1)
where un(x) and vn(x) are sequences of functions of the real variable x ∈[a, b].
Series (M8.2.2.1) is uniformly convergent on the interval [a, b] if the series
∞
X
n=1
vn(x) = v1(x) + v2(x) + · · · + vn(x) + · · ·
(M8.2.2.2)
is uniformly convergent on [a, b] and the functions un(x) form a monotone sequence for
each x and are uniformly bounded (i.e., |un(x)| ≤K with a constant K independent of n, x).
3. Dirichlet criterion of uniform convergence of function series. Series (M8.2.2.1) is
uniformly convergent on the interval [a, b] if the partial sums of the series (M8.2.2.2) are
uniformly bounded, i.e.,

n
X
k=1
vk(x)
 ≤M = const
(x ∈[a, b],
n = 1, 2, . . . ),
and the functions un(x) form a monotone sequence (for each x) that uniformly converges
to zero on [a, b] as n →∞.
◮Properties of uniformly convergent series. Let
∞
P
n=1
un(x) be a function series that
is uniformly convergent on a segment [a, b], and let S(x) be its sum. Then the following
statements hold.
THEOREM 1. If all terms un(x) of the series are continuous at a point x0 ∈[a, b], then
the sum S(x) is continuous at that point.
THEOREM 2. If the terms un(x) are continuous on [a, b], then the series admits term-

Remark. The condition of continuity of the functions un(x) on [a, b] can be replaced by a weaker condition
of their integrability on [a, b].

◮Abel theorem. Convergence radius of a power series. A power series is a function
series of the form
∞
X
n=0
anxn = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · ·
(M8.3.1.1)
(the constants a0, a1, . . . are called the coefﬁcients of the power series), and also a series of
a more general form
∞
X
n=0
an(x – x0)n = a0 + a1(x – x0) + a2(x – x0)2 + a3(x – x0)3 + · · · ,
where x0 is a ﬁxed point. Below, we consider power series of the ﬁrst form, since the
second series can be transformed into the ﬁrst by the replacement ¯x = x – x0.
ABEL THEOREM. A power series
∞
P
n=0
anxn that is convergent for some x=x1 is absolutely
convergent for all x such that |x| < |x1|. A power series that is divergent for some x = x2 is
divergent for all x such that |x| > |x2|.
Remark. There exist series convergent for all x, for instance,
∞
P
n=1
xn
n! . There are series convergent only
for x = 0, for instance,
∞
P
n=1
n! xn.
For a given power series (M8.3.1.1), let R be the least upper bound of all |x| such that
the series (M8.3.1.1) is convergent at point x. Thus, by the Abel theorem, the series is
(absolutely) convergent for all |x| < R, and the series is divergent for all |x| > R. The
constant R is called the radius of convergence of the power series, and the interval (–R, R)
is called its interval of convergence. The problem of convergence of a power series at the
endpoints of its convergence interval has to be studied separately in each speciﬁc case. If a
series is convergent only for x = 0, the convergence interval degenerates into a point (and
R = 0); if a series is convergent for all x, then, obviously, R = ∞.
◮Formulas for the radius of convergence of power series.
1◦. The radius of convergence of a power series (M8.3.1.1) with ﬁnitely many zero terms
can be calculated by the formulas
R = lim
n→∞

an
an+1

(obtained from the d’Alembert criterion for numerical series),
R = lim
n→∞
1
n√|an|
(obtained from the Cauchy criterion for numerical series).
Example 1. For the power series
∞
P
n=1
3n

R = lim
n→∞
 an
an+1
 = lim

 n + 1
3n
 = 1
3 .
Therefore, the series is absolutely convergent on the interval – 1
3 < x < 1
3 and is divergent outside that interval.
At the left endpoint of the interval, for x = – 1
3 , we have the conditionally convergent series

If the number of zero coefﬁcients in a power series is inﬁnite, the above formulas for R
are inapplicable. In such cases, one can directly apply the d’Alembert or Cauchy criteria to
the series.
Example 2. For the power series

4n
n x2n, the d’Alembert criterion gives

an+1x2(n+1)
anx2n
 = lim
n→∞

4nx2
n + 1
 = 4x2.
Then the given series is absolutely convergent if 4x2 < 1, or on the interval – 1
2 < x < 1
2 , and hence R = 1
2 . (It
is easily seen that the original series diverges at both endpoints of the interval of convergence.)
2◦. Suppose that a power series (M8.3.1.1) is convergent at a boundary point of its conver-
gence interval, say, for x = R. Then its sum is left-continuous at that point,

Example 3. Having the expansion
ln(1 + x) = x – x2

(R = 1)
in the domain –1 < x < 1 and knowing that the series
1 – 1
2 + 1
3 – · · · + (–1)n+1 1
n + · · ·
is convergent (by the Leibniz criterion for series with terms of alternating sign), we conclude that the sum of
the last series is equal to ln 2.
◮Properties of power series. Onanyclosedsegment belongingtothe (open) convergence
interval of a power series, the series is uniformly convergent.
Therefore, on any such
segment, the series has all the properties of uniformly convergent series described in
Subsection M8.2.2. Therefore, the following statements hold:
1. A power series (M8.3.1.1) admits term-by-term integration on any segment [0, x] for
|x| < R,

Remark 1. The value of x in this formula may coincide with an endpoint of the convergence interval
(x = –R and/or x = R), provided that series (M8.3.1.1) is convergent at that point.
Remark 2. The convergence radii of the original series and the series obtained by its term-by-term
integration on the segment [0, x] coincide.

M8.3.2. Taylor and Maclaurin Power Series
◮Basic deﬁnitions. Let f(x) be an inﬁnitely differentiable function at a point x0. The
Taylor series for this function is the power series
∞
X
n=0
1
n! f (n)(x0)(x – x0)n = f(x0) + f ′(x0)(x – x0) + 1
2 f ′′(x0)(x – x0)2 + · · · ,
where 0! = 1 and f (0)(x0) = f(x0).
A special case of the Taylor series (for x0 = 0) is the Maclaurin series:
∞
X
n=0
1
n! f (n)(0)xn = f(0) + f ′(0)x + 1
2 f ′′(0)x2 + · · · .
A formal Taylor series (Maclaurin series) for a function f(x) may be:
1) divergent for x ≠x0,
2) convergent in a neighborhood of x0 to a function different from f(x),
3) convergent in a neighborhood of x0 to the function f(x).
In the last case, one says that f(x) is expandable in a Taylor series in the said neighborhood,
and one writes
f(x) =
∞
X
n=0
1
n! f (n)(x0)(x – x0)n.
◮Conditions of expansion in Taylor series. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a
function f(x) to be represented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of a point x0 is that the
remainder term in the Taylor formula* should tend to zero as n →∞in this neighborhood
of x0.
In order that f(x) could be represented by its Taylor series in a neighborhood of x0,
it sufﬁces that all its derivatives in that neighborhood be bounded by the same constant,
|f (n)(x)| ≤M for all n.
Uniqueness of the Taylor series expansion. If a function f(x) is representable by the sum
of a power series, the coefﬁcients of this series are determined uniquely (since this series is
the Taylor series of f(x) and its coefﬁcients have the form f (n)(x0)
n!
, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ).
Therefore, in problems of representing a function by a power series, the answer does not
depend on the method adopted for this purpose.
◮Representation of some functions by the Maclaurin series. The following represen-
tations of elementary functions by Maclaurin series are often used in applications:
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · · + xn
n! + · · · ;
sin x = x – x3
3! + x5
5! – · · · + (–1)n–1

THEOREM ON CONVERGENCE OF SERIES (M8.3.3.4).
(i) If series (M8.3.3.2) is convergent for all y (i.e., R = ∞), then the convergence radius
of series (M8.3.3.4) coincides with the convergence radius r of series (M8.3.3.3).
(ii) If 0 ≤|b0| < R, then series (M8.3.3.4) is convergent on the interval (–R1, R1), where
R1 =
(R – |b0|)ρ
M + R – |b0| ,
and ρ is an arbitrary constant such that 0 < ρ < r; ρ can be chosen arbitrarily close to r; and
M is the least upper bound of the quantities |bm|ρm (m = 1, 2, . . .), so that |bm|ρm ≤M for
all m.
(iii) If |b0| > R, then series (M8.3.3.4) is divergent.

Main Results
◮Dirichlet theorem on representation of a function by Fourier series. A function
f(x) is said to satisfy the Dirichlet conditions on an interval (a, b) if:
1) this interval can be divided into ﬁnitely many intervals on which f(x) is monotone
and continuous;
2) at any discontinuity point x0 of the function, there exist ﬁnite one-sided limits
f(x0 + 0) and f(x0 – 0).

(M8.4.1.2)
At the points of continuity of f(x), the Fourier series converges to f(x), and at any
discontinuity point x0, the series converges to 1
2 [f(x0 + 0) + f(x0 – 0)].
The coefﬁcients an and bn of the series (M8.4.1.1) are called the Fourier coefﬁcients.
Remark. Instead of the integration limits –π and π in (M8.4.1.2), one can take c and c + 2π, where c is
an arbitrary constant.
◮Lipschitz and Dirichlet–Jordan convergence criteria for Fourier series. LIPSCHITZ
CRITERION. Suppose that f(x) is continuous at a point x0 and for sufﬁciently small ε > 0
satisﬁes the inequality |f(x0 ± ε) – f(x0)| ≤Lεσ, where L and σ are constants, 0 < σ ≤1.
Then the representation (M8.4.1.1)–(M8.4.1.2) holds at x = x0.
In particular, the conditions of the Lipschitz criterion hold for continuous piecewise
differentiable functions.
Remark. The Fourier series of a continuous periodic function with no additional conditions (for instance,
of its regularity) may happen to be divergent at inﬁnitely many (even uncountably many) points.
DIRICHLET–JORDAN CRITERION. Suppose that f(x) is a function of bounded variation
on some interval (x0 – h, x0 + h) ∈(–π, π) (i.e., f(x) can be represented as a difference of
two monotonically increasing functions). Then the Fourier series (M8.4.1.1)–(M8.4.1.2) of
the function f(x) at the point x0 converges to the value 1
2 [f(x0 + 0) + f(x0 – 0)].
◮Asymptotic properties of Fourier coefﬁcients.
1◦. Fourier coefﬁcients of an absolutely integrable function tend to zero as n goes to inﬁnity:
an →0 and bn →0 as n →∞.

i.e., an = o(1/n) and bn = o(1/n).

by changing the variable x to z = πx

sum of that series S(x) may differ from f(x)*.
◮Fourier expansion of even and odd functions.
1◦. Let f(x) be an even function, i.e., f(–x) = f(x). Then the Fourier expansion of f(x)

3◦. If f (x) is deﬁned on the interval (0, l) and satisﬁes the Dirichlet conditions, it can be
represented by the cosine Fourier series, as well as the sine Fourier series (with the help of
the above formulas). The cosine Fourier expansion of f(x) on the interval (0, l) corresponds
to the extension of f(x) to the interval (–l, 0) as an even function: f(–x) = f(x). The sine
Fourier expansion of f(x) on (0, l) corresponds to the extension of f(x) to the interval (–l, 0)
as an odd function: f(–x) = –f(x). Both series on the interval (0, l) give the values of f(x)
at points of its continuity and the value 1
2 [f(x0 +0)+f(x0 –0)] at points of its discontinuity;
outside the interval (0, l), these two series represent different functions.

is called the discrete spectrum of the function.
M8.4.3. Criteria of Uniform and Mean-Square Convergence of
Fourier Series
◮Criteria of uniform convergence of Fourier series.
LIPSCHITZ CRITERION. The Fourier series of a function f(x) converges uniformly to that
function on an interval [–l, l] if on a wider interval [–L, L] (–L < –l < l < L) the following
inequality holds:
|f(x1) – f(x2)| ≤K|x1 – x2|σ
for all
x1, x2 ∈[–L, L],
where K and σ are constants, 0 < σ ≤1.
Corollary. The Fourier series of a continuous function f(x) converges uniformly to
that function on an interval [–l, l] if on a wider interval the function f(x) has a bounded
derivative f ′(x).
For any continuously differentiable 2l-periodic function f(x), its Fourier series [deﬁned
by formulas (M8.4.2.1)–(M8.4.2.2)] is uniformly convergent to f(x).

M9.1.1. Deﬁnition of a Complex Number. Arithmetic Operations with
Complex Numbers
◮Deﬁnition of a complex number. Geometric interpretation. The set of complex
numbers is an extension of the set of real numbers. An expression of the form z = x + iy,
where x and y are real numbers, is called a complex number, and the symbol i is called
the imaginary unit, which possesses the property i2 = –1. The numbers x and y are called,
respectively, the real and imaginary parts of z and denoted by
x = Re z
and
y = Im z.
The complex number x + i0 is identiﬁed with real number x, and the number 0 + iy is
denoted by iy and is said to be pure imaginary. Two complex numbers z1 = x1 + iy1 and
z2 = x2 + iy2 are equal if x1 = x2 and y1 = y2.
The complex number ¯z = x – iy is said to be conjugate to the number z.
A complex number z = x + iy can be conveniently represented as a point (x, y) in a
two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (see Fig. M9.1). The axes OX and OY are
called the real and imaginary axis, respectively, and the plane OXY is called the complex
plane. The notions of a complex number and a point on the complex plane are identical.

numbers.
◮Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers. The sum
or difference of complex numbers z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 is deﬁned as the number
z1 ± z2 = x1 ± x2 + i(y1 ± y2).
The geometric meaning of the operations of addition and subtraction of complex num-
bers is as follows: the sum and the difference of complex numbers z1 and z2 are the vectors
equal to the directed diagonals of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors z1 and z2
(Fig. M9.2). The following inequalities hold (Fig. M9.2):
|z1 + z2| ≤|z1| + |z2|,
|z1 – z2| ≥
|z1| – |z2|

FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLE
Inequalities (M9.1.2.1) become equalities if and only if the arguments of the complex
numbers z1 and z2 coincide (i.e., arg z1 = arg z2; see Subsection M9.1.2) or one of the
numbers is zero.
The product z1z2 of complex numbers z1 = x1 + iy1 and z2 = x2 + iy2 is deﬁned to be
the number
z1z2 = (x1x2 – y1y2) + i(x1y2 + x2y1).
The product of a complex number z = x + iy by its conjugate is always nonnegative:
z¯z = x2 + y2.
If z2 ≠0, then the quotient of z1 and z2 is deﬁned as
z1

Relation (M9.1.1.1) can be obtained by multiplying the numerator and the denominator of
the fraction z1/z2 by ¯z2.
M9.1.2. Trigonometric Form of Complex Numbers. Powers and
Radicals
◮Modulus and argument of a complex number. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between complex numbers z = x + iy and points M with coordinates (x, y) on the plane
with a Cartesian rectangular coordinate system OXY or with vectors −−→
OM connecting the
origin O with M (Fig. M9.1). The length r of the vector −−→
OM is called the modulus (also
magnitude and absolute value) of the number z and is denoted by r = |z|, and the angle ϕ
formed by the vector −−→
OM and the positive direction of the OX-axis is called the argument
(also phase) of the number z and is denoted by ϕ = Arg z.
The modulus of a complex number is determined by the formula
|z| =
q
x2 + y2.
The argument Arg z is determined up to a multiple of 2π, Arg z = arg z + 2kπ, where k is
an arbitrary integer and arg z is the principal value of Arg z determined by the condition
–π < arg z ≤π. The principal value arg z is given by the formula
arg z =

for x < 0, y < 0,
π/2
for x = 0, y > 0,
–π/2
for x = 0, y < 0.
For z = 0, Arg z is undeﬁned.
◮Trigonometric form of complex numbers. Since x = r cos ϕ and y = r sin ϕ, it follows
that the complex number can be written in the trigonometric (or polar) form
z = x + iy = r(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ).
For two complex numbers written in trigonometric form, z1 = r1(cos ϕ1 + i sin ϕ1) and
z2 = r2(cos ϕ2 + i sin ϕ2), the following arithmetic rules are valid:

◮Powers and radicals. For any positive integer n, the nth power of z is calculated by de
Moivre’s formula
zn = rn(cos nϕ + i sin nϕ),
For z ≠0 and positive integer n, there are exactly n distinct values of the nth root of
z = r(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ), which are determined by

M9.2. Functions of Complex Variables
M9.2.1. Basic Concepts. Differentiation of a Function of a Complex
Variable
◮Some concepts and deﬁnitions. A subset D of the complex plane such that each point
of D has a neighborhood contained in D (i.e., D is open) and two arbitrary points of D
can be connected by a broken line lying in D (i.e., D is connected) is called a domain in
the complex plane. Each point of D is its interior point. A point that does not lie in D but
whose arbitrary neighborhood contains points of D is called a boundary point of D. The
set of all boundary points of D is called the boundary of D. The union of a domain D
with its boundary is called a closed domain and denoted by D. The boundary of a domain

232
FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLE
can consist of ﬁnitely many closed curves, segments, and points; the curves and cuts are
assumed to be piecewise smooth.
The simplest examples of domains are neighborhoods of points on the complex plane.
A neighborhood of a point a on the complex plane is understood as the set of points z such
that |z – a| < R, i.e., the interior of the disk of radius R > 0 centered at the point a. The
extended complex plane is obtained by augmenting the complex plane with the ﬁctitious
point at inﬁnity. A neighborhood of the point at inﬁnity is understood as the set of points z
such that |z| > R (including the point at inﬁnity itself).
If to each point z of a domain D there corresponds a single point w (resp., a number of
points w), then one says that there is a single-valued (resp., multi-valued) function w = f(z)
deﬁned on the domain D. If we set z = x + iy and w = u + iv, then deﬁning a function
w = f(z) of the complex variable z is equivalent to deﬁning two functions Re f = u = u(x, y)
and Im f = v = v(x, y) of two real variables. If the function w = f(z) is single-valued on D
and the images of distinct points of D are distinct, then the mapping determined by this
function is said to be schlicht. The notions of boundedness, limit, and continuity for single-
valued functions of a complex variable do not differ from the corresponding notions for real
functions of two real variables.
◮Differentiability. The Cauchy–Riemann conditions. Let a single-valued function
w = f(z) be deﬁned in a neighborhood of a point z. If there exists a limit
lim
h→0
f(z + h) – f(z)
h
= f ′
z(z),
then the function w = f(z) is said to be differentiable at the point z and f ′
z(z) is called its
derivative at the point z.
Cauchy–Riemann conditions. If the functions u(x, y) = Re f(z) and v(x, y) = Im f(z)
are differentiable at a point (x, y), then the Cauchy–Riemann conditions
∂u
∂x = ∂v
∂y ,
∂u
∂y = – ∂v
∂x
(M9.2.1.1)
are necessaryandsufﬁcient for the function w =f(z) tobe differentiable at the point z =x+iy.
If the function w = f(z) is differentiable, then
w′
z = ux + ivx = vy – iuy = ux – iuy = vy + ivx,
where the subscripts x and y indicate the corresponding partial derivatives.
Remark. The Cauchy–Riemann conditions are sometimes also called the d’Alembert–Euler conditions.
The rules for arithmetic operations on the derivatives and those for taking the derivative
of a composite function and the inverse function (if it exists) have exactly the same form as
in the case of functions of a real variable:
1.

αf1(z) ± βf2(z)

4. If a function w = f(z) is differentiable at a point z and a function W = F(w) is
differentiable at the point w = f(z), then the composite function W = F(f(z)) is
differentiable at the point z and W ′
z = [F(f(z))]′
z = F ′
f(f)f ′
z(z).

5. If a function w = f(z) is differentiable at a point z and the inverse z = g(w) ≡f –1(w)
exists and is differentiable at the point w, then
[f –1(w)]′
w =
1
f ′z(z)|z=f–1(w)
(f ′
z(z) ≠0).
◮Analyticity. The maximum modulus principle. The Liouville’s theorem. A single-
valued function differentiable in some neighborhood of a point z0 is said to be analytic
(regular, holomorphic) at this point.
A function w = f(z) is analytic at a point z0 if and only if it can be represented by a
power series
f(z) =
∞
X
k=0
ck(z – z0)k
converging in some neighborhood of z0.
A function analytic at each point of the domain D is said to be analytic in D.
A function w = f(z) is said to be analytic at the point at inﬁnity if the function
F(z) = f(1/z) is analytic at the point z = 0.
A function w = f(z) is analytic at the point at inﬁnity if and only if this function can be
represented by a power series
f(z) =
∞
X
k=0
bkz–k
converging for sufﬁciently large |z|.
If a function w = f(z) is analytic at a point z0 and f ′
z(z0) ≠0, then f(z) has an analytic
inverse function z(w) deﬁned in a neighborhood of the point w0 = f(z0). If a function
w = f(z) is analytic at a point z0 and the function W = F(w) is analytic at the point
w0 = f(z0), then the composite function W = F[f(z)] is analytic at the point z0. If a
function is analytic in a domain D and continuous in D, then its value at any interior point
of the domain is uniquely determined by its values on the boundary of the domain. The
analyticity of a function at a point implies the existence and analyticity of its derivatives of
arbitrary order at this point.
Single-valued functions, as well as single-valued branches of multi-valued functions,
are analytic everywhere on the domains where they are deﬁned. It follows from (M9.2.1.1)
that the real and imaginary parts u(x, y) and v(x, y) of a function analytic in a domain are
harmonic in this domain, i.e., satisfy the Laplace equation
∆f = fxx + fyy = 0
in this domain.
Remark. If u(x, y) and v(x, y) are two arbitrary harmonic functions, then the function f(z) = u(x, y) +
iv(x, y) is not necessarily analytic, since for the analyticity of f(z) the functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) must satisfy
the Cauchy–Riemann conditions.
Example 1. The function w = z2 is analytic.
Indeed, since z = x + iy, we have w = (x + iy)2 = x2 – y2 + i2xy, u(x, y) = x2 – y2, and v(x, y) = 2xy. The
Cauchy–Riemann conditions
ux = vy = 2x,
uy = –vx = –2y
are satisﬁed at all points of the complex plane, so the function w = z2 is analytic.

234
FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLE
Example 2. The function w = ¯z is not analytic.
Indeed, since z = x + iy, we have w = x – iy, u(x, y) = x, v(x, y) = –y. The Cauchy–Riemann conditions
are not satisﬁed,
ux = 1 ≠–1 = vy,
uy = –vx = 0,
so the function w = ¯z is not analytic.
MAXIMUM MODULUS PRINCIPLE. If a function w = f(z) that is not identically constant
is analytic in a domain D and continuous in D, then its modulus cannot attain a maximum
at an interior point of D.
LIOUVILLE’S THEOREM. If a function w = f(z) is analytic and bounded in the entire
complex plane, then it is constant.
Remark. The Liouville theorem can be stated in the following form:
if a function w = f(z) is analytic in the extended complex plane, then it is constant.
◮Geometric meaning of the derivative. Geometric meaning of the absolute value of the
derivative. Suppose that a function w = f(z) is analytic at a point z0 and f ′
z(z0) ≠0. Then
the value |f ′
z(z0)| determines the dilatation (similarity) coefﬁcient at the point z0 under the
mapping w = f(z). The value |f ′
z(z0)| is called the dilatation ratio if |f ′
z(z0)| > 1 and the
contraction ratio if |f ′
z(z0)| < 1.
Geometric meaning of the argument of the derivative. The argument of the derivative
f ′
z(z0) is equal to the angle by which the tangent at the point z0 to any curve passing
through z0 should be rotated to give the tangent to the image of the curve at the point
w0 = f(z0). For ϕ = arg f ′
z(z) > 0, the rotation is counterclockwise, and for ϕ = arg f ′
z(z) < 0,
the rotation is clockwise.
◮Elementary functions.
1◦. Consider the functions w = zn and w =
n√z for positive integer n. The function
w = zn
is single-valued. It is schlicht in the sectors 2πk/n < ϕ < 2π(k + 1)/n, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , each
of which is transformed by the mapping w = zn onto the plane w with a cut on the positive
real semiaxis.
The function
w =
n√z
is an n-valued function for z ≠0, and its value is determined by the value of the argument
chosen for the point z. If a closed curve C does not surround the point z = 0, then, as the
point z goes around the entire curve C, the point w =
n√z for a chosen value of the root
also moves along a closed curve and returns to the initial value of the argument. But if the
curve C surrounds the origin, then, as the point z goes around the entire curve C in the
positive sense (in the counterclockwise direction), the argument of z increases by 2π and the
corresponding point w =
n√z does not return to the initial position. It will return there only
after the point z goes n times around the entire curve C. If a domain D does not contain a
closed curve surrounding the point z = 0, then one can single out n continuous single-valued
functions, each of which takes only one of the values w =
n√z; these functions are called the
branches of the multi-valued function w =
n√z. One cannot single out n separate branches
of the function w =
n√z in any neighborhood of the point z = 0; accordingly, the point z = 0
is called a branch point of this function.
2◦. The Zhukovskii function

M9.2. FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLES
235
is deﬁned and single-valued for all z ≠0; it is schlicht in any domain that does not
simultaneously contain any points z1 and z2 such that z1z2 = 1.
3◦. The exponential function w = ez is deﬁned by the formula
w = ez = ex+iy = ex(cos y + i sin y).
The function w = ez is analytic everywhere. For the exponential function, the usual
differentiation rule is preserved:
(ez)′
z = ez.
The basic property of the exponential function is also preserved:
ez1ez2 = ez1+z2.
For x = 0 and y = ϕ, the deﬁnition of the exponential function implies the Euler formula
eiϕ = cos ϕ + i sin ϕ, which permits one to write any complex number with modulus r and
argument ϕ in the exponential form
z = r(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ) = reiϕ.
The exponential function is periodic with imaginary period 2πi, and the mapping w = ez
is schlicht in the strip 0 ≤y < 2π.
4◦. The logarithm is deﬁned as the inverse of the exponential function: if ew = z, then
w = Ln z.
This function is deﬁned for z ≠0. The logarithm satisﬁes the following relations:
Ln z1 + Ln z2 = Ln(z1z2),
Ln z1 – Ln z2 = Ln z1
z2
,
Ln(zn) = n Ln z,
Ln n√z = 1
n Ln z.
The exponential form of complex numbers readily shows that the logarithm is inﬁnite-
valued:
Ln z = ln |z| + i Arg z = ln |z| + i arg z + 2πki,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
(M9.2.1.2)
The quantity ln z = ln |z| + i arg z is taken to be the principal value of this function. Just as
with the function w =
n√z, we see that if the point z = 0 is surrounded by a closed curve C,
then the point w = Ln z does not return to its initial position after z goes around C in the
positive sense, since the argument of w increases by 2πi. Thus if a domain D does not
contain a closed curve surrounding the point z = 0, then in D one can single out inﬁnitely
many continuous and single-valued branches of the multi-valued function w = Ln z; the
differences between the values of these branches at each point of the domain are equal to
2πki, where k is an integer. This cannot be done in an arbitrary neighborhood of the point
z = 0, and this point is called a branch point of the logarithm.
5◦. Trigonometric functions are deﬁned in terms of the exponential function as follows:
cos z = eiz + e–iz
2
,
sin z = eiz – e–iz
2i
,
tan z = sin z
cos z = –i eiz – e–iz
eiz + e–iz ,
cot z = cos z
sin z = i eiz + e–iz
eiz – e–iz .

236
FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLE
These are properties of the functions cos z and sin z:
1. They are analytic for any z.
2. The usual differentiation rules are valid:
(sin z)′
z = cos z,
(cos z)′
z = – sin z.
3. They are periodic with real period T = 2π.
4. sin z is an odd function, and cos z is an even function.
5. In the complex plane, they are unbounded.
6. The usual trigonometric relations hold:
cos2 z + sin2 z = 1,
cos 2z = cos2 z – sin2 z,
etc.
The function tan z is analytic everywhere except for the points
zk = π
2 + kπ,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . ,
and the function cot z is analytic everywhere except for the points
zk = kπ,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
The functions tan z and cot z are periodic with real period T = π.
6◦. Hyperbolic functions are deﬁned by the formulas
cosh z = ez + e–z
2
,
sinh z = ez – e–z
2
,
tanh z = sinh z
cosh z = ez – e–z
ez + e–z ,
coth z = cosh z
sinh z = ez + e–z
ez – e–z .
For real values of the argument, each of these functions coincides with the corresponding
real function. Hyperbolic and trigonometric functions are related by the formulas
cosh z = cos iz,
sinh z = –i sin iz,
tanh z = –i tan iz,
coth z = i cot iz.
7◦. Inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are expressed via the logarithm and
hence are inﬁnite-valued:
Arccos z = –i Ln(z +
p
z2 – 1),
Arcsin z = –i Ln(iz +
p
1 – z2),
Arctan z = – i
2 Ln 1 + iz

Arccot z = – i
2 Ln z + i
z – i ,
arccosh z = Ln(z +

z2 – 1),
arcsinh z = Ln(z +
p
z2 – 1),
arctanh z = 1
2 Ln 1 + z
1 – z ,
arccoth z = 1
2 Ln z + 1
z – 1 .
The principal value of each of these functions is obtained by choosing the principal
value of the corresponding logarithmic function.
8◦. The power function w = zγ is deﬁned by the relation
zγ = eγ Ln z,
(M9.2.1.3)
where γ = α + iβ is an arbitrary complex number. Substituting z = reiϕ into (M9.2.1.3)
yields
zγ = eα ln r–β(ϕ+2kπ)eiα(ϕ+2kπ)+iβ ln r,
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
(M9.2.1.4)
It follows from relation (M9.2.1.4) that the function w = zγ has inﬁnitely many values
for β ≠0.

9◦. The general exponential function is deﬁned by
w = γz = ez Ln γ = ez ln |γ|ezi Arg γ,
(M9.2.1.5)
where γ = α + iβ is an arbitrary nonzero complex number. The function (M9.2.1.5) is a set
of separate mutually independent single-valued functions that differ from one another by
the factors e2kπiz, k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
Example 3. Let us calculate the values of some elementary functions at speciﬁc points:
1. cos 2i = 1
2 (e2ii + e–2ii) = 1
2 (e2 + e–2) = cosh 2 ≈3.7622.
2. ln(–2) = ln 2 + iπ, since | – 2| = 2 and the principal value of the argument is equal to π.
3. Ln(–2) is calculated by formula (M9.2.1.2):
Ln(–2) = ln 2 + iπ + 2πki = ln 2 + (1 + 2k)iπ
(k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

◮Analytic continuation. Let two domains D1 and D2 have a common part γ of the
boundary, and let single-valued analytic functions f1(z) and f2(z), respectively, be given in
these domains. The function f2(z) is called a direct analytic continuation of f1(z) into the
domain D2 if there exists a function f(z) analytic in the domain D1 ∪γ ∪D2 and satisfying
the condition
f(z) =
n f1(z)
for z ∈D1,
f2(z)
for z ∈D2.
(M9.2.1.6)
If such a continuation is possible, then the function f(z) is uniquely determined. If the
domains are simply connected and the functions f1(z) and f2(z) are continuous in D1 ∪γ
and D2 ∪γ, respectively, and coincide on γ, then f2(z) is the direct analytic continuation
of f1(z) into the domain D2. In addition, suppose that the domains D1 and D2 are allowed
to have common interior points. A function f2(z) is called a direct analytic continuation
of f1(z) through γ if f1(z) and f2(z) are continuous in D1 ∪γ and D2 ∪γ, respectively,
and their values on γ coincide. At the common interior points of D1 and D2, the function
determined by relation (M9.2.1.6) can be double-valued.
M9.2.2. Integration of Functions of Complex Variables
◮Deﬁnition and properties of the integral of a function of a complex variable. Sup-
pose that an oriented curve C connecting points z = a and z = b is given on the complex
plane and a function w = f(z) of the complex variable z is deﬁned on the curve. We divide
the curve C into n parts, a = z0, z1, . . . , zn–1, zn = b, arbitrarily choose ξk ∈[zk, zk+1], and
compose the integral sum

f(ξk)(zk+1 – zk).
If there exists a limit of this sum as max |zk+1 – zk| →0, independent of the way it is
partitioned and the choice of the points ξk, then this limit is called the integral of the
function w = f(z) over the curve C and is denoted by

If C is a piecewise smooth curve and f(z) is bounded and piecewise continuous, then
the integral (M9.2.2.1) exists. If z = x + iy and w = u(x, y) + iv(x, y), then the computation

then its sum is analytic in the domain D.
If a series (M9.2.3.1) of functions analytic in a domain D and continuous in D converges

|z – a| < |z0 – a|. Moreover, the series converges uniformly in any disk |z – a| ≤q|z0 – a|,
where 0 < q < 1.
It follows from Abel’s theorem that the domain of convergence of a power series is an
open disk centered at the point a; moreover, this disk can ﬁll the entire plane. The radius of
this disk is called the radius of convergence of a power series. The sum of the power series

Example 1. Let us consider Laurent series expansions of the function
f(z) =

z(1 – z)
in a Laurent series in the domain 0 < |z| < 1. This function is analytic in the annulus 0 < |z| < 1 and hence can

f(z) =

Since |z| < 1, we can use formula (M9.2.3.7) and obtain the expansion

Example 2. Let us consider Laurent series expansions of the function

we should replace z by 1/z. Thus we obtain

M9.2.4. Zeros and Isolated Singularities of Analytic Functions
◮Zeros of analytic functions. A point z = a is called a zero of a function f(z) if f(a) = 0.
If f(z) is analytic at the point a and is not zero identically, then the least order of nonzero
coefﬁcients in the Taylor expansion of f(z) centered at a, in other words, the number n
of the ﬁrst nonzero derivative f (n)(a), is called the order of zero of this function. In a
neighborhood of a zero a of order n, the Taylor expansion of f(z) has the form
f(z) = cn(z – a)n + cn+1(z – a)n+1 + . . .
(cn ≠0, n ≥1).
In this case, f(z) = cn(z – a)ng(z), where the function g(z) is analytic at the point a and
g(a) ≠0. A ﬁrst-order zero is said to be simple. The point z = ∞is a zero of order n for a
function f(z) if z = 0 is a zero of order n for F(z) = f(1/z).
If a function f(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of its zero a and is not identically zero in
any neighborhood of a, then there exists a neighborhood of a in which f(z) does not have
any zeros other than a.
UNIQUENESS THEOREM. If functions f(z) and g(z) are analytic in a domain D and their
values coincide on some sequence ak of points converging to an interior point a of the
domain D, then f(z) ≡g(z) everywhere in D.
ROUCH´E’S THEOREM. If functions f(z) and g(z) are analytic in a simply connected
domain D bounded by a curve C, are continuous in D, and satisfy the inequality |f(z)|>|g(z)|
on C, then the functions f(z) and f(z) + g(z) have the same number of zeros in D.
◮Isolated singularities of analytic functions. A point a is called an isolated singularity
of a single-valued analytic function f(z) if there exists a neighborhood of this point in which
f(z) is analytic everywhere except for the point a itself. The point a is called
1. A removable singularity if lim
z→a f(z) exists and is ﬁnite.
2. A pole if lim
z→af(z) = ∞.
3. An essential singularity if lim
z→a f(z) does not exist.

A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a point a to be a removable singularity of a
function f(z) is that the Laurent expansion of f(z) around a does not contain the principal
part.
If a function f(z) is bounded in a neighborhood of an isolated singularity a, then a is a

(M9.2.4.1)
The order of a pole a of a function f(z) is deﬁned to be the order of the zero of the
function F(z) = 1/f(z). If c–n ≠0 in expansion (M9.2.4.1), then the order of the pole a of
the function f(z) is equal to n. For n = 1, we have a simple pole.
A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a point a to be an essential singularity of a
function f(z) is that the principal part of the Laurent expansion of f(z) around a contains
inﬁnitely many nonzero terms.
SOKHOTSKI’S THEOREM. If a is an essential singularity of a function f(z), then for each
complex number A there exists a sequence of points zk →a such that f(zk) →A.
Example. Let us consider some functions with singular points of different kind.
1◦. The function f(z) = (1 – cos z)/z2 has a removable singularity at the origin, since its Laurent expansion
about the origin,
1 – cos z
z2
= 1
2 – z2
24 + z4
720 – . . . ,
does not contain the principal part.
2◦. The function f(z) = 1/(1+ez2) has inﬁnitely many poles at the points z = ±√(2k + 1)πi (k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).
All these poles are simple poles, since the function 1/f(z) = 1 + ez2 has simple zeros at these points. (Its
derivative is nonzero at these points.)
3◦. The function f(z) = sin(1/z) has an essential singularity at the origin, since the principal part of its Laurent
expansion
sin 1
z = 1
z –
1
z33! + . . .
contains inﬁnitely many terms.
The following two simplest classes of single-valued analytic functions are distinguished
according to the character of singular points.
1. Entire functions. A function f(z) is said to be entire if it does not have singular
points in the ﬁnite part of the complex plane. An entire function can be represented by an
everywhere convergent power series
f(z) =
∞
X
n=0
cnzn.
An entire function can have only one singular point at z = ∞. If this singularity is a pole of
order n, then f(z) is a polynomial of degree n. If z = ∞is an essential singularity, then f(z)
is called an entire transcendental function. If z = ∞is a regular point (i.e., f(z) is analytic
for all z), then f(z) is constant (Liouville’s theorem). All polynomials, the exponential
function, sin z, cos z, etc. are examples of entire functions. Sums, differences, and products
of entire functions are themselves entire functions.

M9.2. FUNCTIONS OF COMPLEX VARIABLES
245
2. Meromorphic functions. A function f(z) is said to be meromorphic if it does not
have any singularities except for poles. The number of these poles in each ﬁnite closed
domain D is always ﬁnite.
Suppose that a function f(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of the point at inﬁnity. The
deﬁnition of singular points can be generalized to this function without any changes. But
the criteria for the type of a singular point at inﬁnity related to the Laurent expansion are
different.
THEOREM. In the case of a removable singularity at the point at inﬁnity, the Laurent
expansion of a function f(z) in a neighborhood of this point does not contain positive
powers of z. In the case of a pole, it contains ﬁnitely many positive powers of z. In the case
of an essential singularity, it contains inﬁnitely many powers of z.
Let f(z) be a multi-valued function deﬁned in a neighborhood D of a point z = a except
possibly for the point a itself, and let f1(z), f2(z), . . . be its branches, which are single-
valued continuous functions in the domain where they are deﬁned. The point a is called
a branch point (ramiﬁcation point) of the function f(z) if f(z) passes from one branch to
another as the point z goes along a closed curve around the point z in a neighborhood of D.
If the original branch is reached again after going around this curve m times (in the same
sense), then the number m – 1 is called the order of the branch point, and the point a itself
is called a branch point of order m – 1.
If all branches fk(z) tend to the same ﬁnite or inﬁnite limit as z →a, then the point a is
called an algebraic branch point. (For example, the point z = 0 is an algebraic branch point
of the function f(z) =
m√z.) In this case, the single-valued function
F(z) = f(zm + a)
has a regular point or a pole for z = 0.
If the limit of fk(z) as z →a does not exist, then the point a is called a transcendental
branch point. For example, the point z = 0 is a transcendental branch point of the function
f(z) = exp( mp
1/z ).
In a neighborhood of a branch point a of ﬁnite order, the function f(z) can be expanded
in a fractional power series (Puiseux series)
f(z) =
∞
X
k=–∞
ck(z – a)k/m.
(M9.2.4.2)
If a new branch is obtained each time after going around this curve (in the same sense),
then the point a is called a branch point of inﬁnite order (a logarithmic branch point). For
example, the points z = 0 and z = ∞are logarithmic branch points of the multi-valued
function w = Ln z. A logarithmic branch point is classiﬁed as a transcendental branch point.
For a ≠∞, the expansion (M9.2.4.2) contains ﬁnitely many terms with negative k
(inﬁnitely many in the case of a transcendental point).

Remark. Residues are sometimes denoted by res[f(z); a] or resz=a f(z).

5. If a is an essential singularity of f(z), then to obtain res f(a), one has to ﬁnd the
coefﬁcient c–1 in the Laurent expansion of f(z) in a neighborhood of a.
◮Basic theorems on residues.
A function f(z) is said to be continuous on the boundary C of the domain D if for each
boundary point z0 there exists a limit lim
z→z0 f(z) = f(z0) as z →z0, z ∈D.
CAUCHY’S RESIDUE THEOREM. Let f(z) be a function continuous on the boundary C
of a domain D and analytic in the interior of D everywhere except for ﬁnitely many points

THEOREM. The logarithmic derivative f ′
z(z)/f(z) has ﬁrst-order poles at the zeros and
poles of f(z). Moreover, the logarithmic residue of f(z) at a zero or a pole of f(z) is equal
to the order of the zero or minus the order of the pole, respectively.

Γ
f(z) dz,
where Γ is a circle of sufﬁciently large radius |z| = ρ and the integral is taken in the clockwise
sense (so that the neighborhood of the point z = ∞remains to the left of the contour, just
as in the case of a ﬁnite point).
The residue of f(z) at inﬁnity is equal to minus the coefﬁcient of z–1 in the Laurent
expansion of f(z) in a neighborhood of the point z = ∞,
res f(∞) = –c–1.
THEOREM. If a function f(z) has ﬁnitely many singular points in the extended complex
plane, then the sum of all its residues, including the residue at inﬁnity, is zero:
res f(∞) +

In the disk |z| ≤1

◮Jordan’s lemma. Calculation of deﬁnite integrals using residues. Suppose that
we need to calculate the integral of a real function f(x) over a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) interval
(a, b). Let us supplement the interval (a, b) with a curve Γ that, together with (a, b), bounds
a domain D, and then analytically continue the function f(x) into D. Then the residue
theorem can be applied to this analytic continuation of f(z), and by this theorem

where Λ is the sum of residues of f(z) in D. If
R
Γ f(z) dz can be calculated or expressed
in terms of the desired integral
R b
a f(x) dx, then the problem will be solved.
When calculating integrals of the form
R ∞
–∞f(x) dx, one should apply (M9.2.5.4) to
the contour C that consists of the interval (–R, R) of the real axis and the arc CR of the
semicircle |z| = R in the upper half-plane. Sometimes, it is only possible to ﬁnd the limit
as R →∞of the integral over the contour CR rather than to calculate it, and often it turns
out that the limit of this integral is equal to zero.
LEMMA. If a function f(z) is analytic for |z| > R0 and zf(z) →0 as |z| →∞for y ≥0,
then

The analytic continuation of the integrand into the upper half-plane is f(z) = (1+z4)–1; it satisﬁes the conditions

(both points are ﬁrst-order poles). Using formulas (M9.2.5.3) and (M9.2.5.6), one ﬁnds

Integral Transforms
M10.1. General Form of Integral Transforms. Inversion
Formulas
Normally an integral transform has the form
ef(λ) =
Z b
a
ϕ(x, λ)f(x) dx.
The function ef(λ) is called the transform of the function f(x) and ϕ(x, λ) is called the
kernel of the integral transform. The function f(x) is called the inverse transform of ef(λ).
The limits of integration a and b are real numbers (usually, a = 0, b = ∞or a = –∞, b = ∞).
For brevity, we rewrite the integral transform as follows: ef(λ) = L{f(x)}.
General properties of integral transforms (linearity):
L{kf(x)} = kL{f(x)},
L{f(x) ± g(x)} = L{f(x)} ± L{g(x)}.
Here, k is an arbitrary constant; it is assumed that integral transforms of the functions f(x)
and g(x) exist.
In Subsections M10.2–M10.4, the most popular (Laplace, Fourier, Mellin, etc.) integral
transforms are described.
These subsections also describe the corresponding inversion
formulas, which normally have the form
f(x) =
Z
C
ψ(x, λ)ef(λ) dλ
and make it possible to recover f(x) if ef(λ) is given. The integration path C can lie either
on the real axis or in the complex plane.
In many cases, to evaluate the integrals in the inversion formula—in particular, to ﬁnd
the inverse Laplace, Mellin, and Fourier transforms—methods of the theory of functions
of a complex variable can be applied, including the theorems about residue and Jordan’s
lemma, which are outlined in Subsection M9.2.5.
M10.2. Laplace Transform
M10.2.1. Laplace Transform and the Inverse Laplace Transform
◮Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of an arbitrary (complex-valued) func-
tion f(x) of a real variable x (x ≥0) is deﬁned by
ef(p) =
Z ∞
0
e–pxf(x) dx,
(M10.2.1.1)
where p = s + iσ is a complex variable.
251

252
INTEGRAL TRANSFORMS
The Laplace transform exists for any continuous or piecewise-continuous function
satisfying the condition |f(x)| < Meσ0x with some M > 0 and σ0 ≥0. In the following,
σ0 often means the greatest lower bound of the possible values of σ0 in this estimate; this
value is called the growth exponent of the function f(x).
For any f(x), the transform ef(p) is deﬁned in the half-plane Re p > σ0 and is analytic
there.
For brevity, we shall write formula (M10.2.1.1) as follows:
ef(p) = L

f(x)
	
or
ef(p) = L

f(x), p
	
.
◮Inverse Laplace transform. Given the transform ef(p), the function f(x) can be found
by means of the inverse Laplace transform
f(x) =
1
2πi
Z c+i∞
c–i∞
ef(p)epx dp,
i2 = –1,
(M10.2.1.2)
where the integration path is parallel to the imaginary axis and lies to the right of all
singularities of ef(p), which corresponds to c > σ0.
The integral in inversion formula (M10.2.1.2) is understood in the sense of the Cauchy
principal value:
Z c+i∞
c–i∞
ef(p)epx dp = lim
ω→∞
Z c+iω
c–iω
ef(p)epx dp.
In the domain x < 0, formula (M10.2.1.2) gives f(x) ≡0.
Formula (M10.2.1.2) holds for continuous functions. If f(x) has a (ﬁnite) jump dis-
continuity at a point x = x0 > 0, then the right-hand side of (M10.2.1.2) evaluates to
1
2 [f(x0 – 0) + f(x0 + 0)] at this point (for x0 = 0, the ﬁrst term in the square brackets must
be omitted).
For brevity, we write the Laplace inversion formula (M10.2.1.2) as follows:
f(x) = L–1ef(p)
	
or
f(x) = L–1ef(p), x
	
.
There are tables of direct and inverse Laplace transforms (see Sections S2.1 and S2.2),
which are handy in solving linear differential and integral equations.

tables, see Section S2.1 and the list of references at the end of this chapter.
◮Inverse transforms of rational functions. Consider the important case in which the
transform is a rational function of the form
ef(p) = R(p)
Q(p) ,
(M10.2.2.1)
where Q(p) and R(p) are polynomials in the variable p and the degree of Q(p) exceeds that
of R(p).
Assume that the zeros of the denominator are simple, i.e.,
Q(p) ≡const (p – λ1)(p – λ2) . . . (p – λn).
Then the inverse transform can be determined by the formula
f(x) =

(M10.2.2.2)
where the primes denote the derivatives.

Example 1. The transform
ef(p) =
b
p2 – a2
(a and b real numbers)
can be represented as the fraction (M10.2.2.1) with R(p) = b and Q(p) = (p – a)(p + a). The denominator Q(p)
has two simple roots, λ1 = a and λ2 = –a. Using formula (M10.2.2.2) with n = 2 and Q′(p) = 2p, we obtain
the inverse transform in the form
f(x) = b
2a eax – b
2a e–ax = b
a sinh(ax).
Example 2. The transform
ef(p) =
b
p2 + a2
(a and b real numbers)
can be written as the fraction (M10.2.2.1) with R(p) = b and Q(p) = (p – ia)(p + ia), i2 = –1. The denominator
Q(p) has two simple pure imaginary roots, λ1 = ia and λ2 = –ia. Using formula (M10.2.2.2) with n = 2, we
ﬁnd the inverse transform:
f(x) =
b
2ia eiax –
b
2ia e–iax = b
a sin(ax).
Example 3. The transform
ef(p) = ap–n,
where n is a positive integer, can be written as the fraction (M10.2.2.1) with R(p) = a and Q(p) = pn. The
denominator Q(p) has one root of multiplicity n, λ1 = 0. By formula (M10.2.2.3) with m = 1 and s1 = n, we
ﬁnd the inverse transform:
f(x) =
a
(n – 1)! xn–1.
Remark. Fairly detailed tables of inverse Laplace transforms can be found in Section S2.2.

M10.4. Mellin Transform and Other Transforms
M10.4.1. Mellin Transform and the Inversion Formula
◮Mellin transform. Suppose that a function f(x) is deﬁned for positive x and satisﬁes
the conditions
Z 1
0
|f(x)| xσ1–1 dx < ∞,
Z ∞
1
|f(x)| xσ2–1 dx < ∞
for some real numbers σ1 and σ2, σ1 < σ2.
The Mellin transform of f(x) is deﬁned by
ˆf(s) =
Z ∞
0
f(x)xs–1 dx,
(M10.4.1.1)
where s = σ + iτ is a complex variable (σ1 < σ < σ2).
For brevity, we rewrite formula (M10.4.1.1) as follows:
ˆf(s) = M{f(x)}
or
ˆf(s) = M{f(x), s}.
◮Inverse Mellin transform. Given ˆf(s), the function f(x) can be found by means of the
inverse Mellin transform
f(x) =

(σ1 < σ < σ2),
(M10.4.1.2)
where the integration path is parallel to the imaginary axis of the complex plane s and the
integral is understood in the sense of the Cauchy principal value.
Formula (M10.4.1.2) holds for continuous functions. If f(x) has a (ﬁnite) jump dis-
continuity at a point x = x0 > 0, then the right-hand side of (M10.4.1.2) evaluates to
1
2

f(x0 – 0) + f(x0 + 0)

at this point (for x0 = 0, the ﬁrst term in the square brackets must
be omitted).
For brevity, we rewrite formula (M10.4.1.2) in the form
f(x) = M–1{ ˆf(s)}
or
f(x) = M–1{ ˆf(s), x}.

which makes it possible to apply much more common tables of direct and inverse Laplace

Chapter M11
Ordinary Differential Equations
M11.1. First-Order Differential Equations
M11.1.1. General Concepts. The Cauchy Problem. Uniqueness and
Existence Theorems
◮Equations solved for the derivative. General solution. A ﬁrst-order ordinary differ-
ential equation* solved for the derivative has the form
y′
x = f(x, y).
(M11.1.1.1)
Sometimes it is represented in terms of differentials as dy = f(x, y) dx.
A solution of a differential equation is a function y(x) that, when substituted into
the equation, turns it into an identity. The general solution of a differential equation is
the set of all its solutions. In some cases, the general solution can be represented as a
function y = ϕ(x, C) that depends on one arbitrary constant C; speciﬁc values of C deﬁne
speciﬁc solutions of the equation (particular solutions). In practice, the general solution
more frequently appears in implicit form, Φ(x, y, C) = 0, or parametric form, x = x(t, C),
y = y(t, C).
Geometrically, the general solution (also called the general integral) of an equation is
a family of curves in the xy-plane depending on a single parameter C; these curves are
called integral curves of the equation. To each particular solution (particular integral) there
corresponds a single curve that passes through a given point (x0, y0) in the plane.
For each point (x, y), the equation y′
x = f(x, y) deﬁnes a value of y′
x, i.e., the slope of the
integral curve that passes through this point. In other words, the equation generates a ﬁeld
of directions in the xy-plane. From the geometrical point of view, the problem of solving
a ﬁrst-order differential equation involves ﬁnding the curves, the slopes of which at each
point coincide with the direction of the ﬁeld at this point.
Figure M11.1 depicts the tangent to an integral curve at a point (x0, y0); the slope of the
integral curve at this point is determined by the right-hand side of equation (M11.1.1.1):
tan α = f(x0, y0). The little segments show the ﬁeld of tangents to the integral curves of the
differential equation (M11.1.1.1) at other points.
◮Equations integrable by quadrature. The process of ﬁnding a solution to a differen-
tial equation is called integration of this equation. The problem of integration of equation
(M11.1.1.1) can often be reduced to the problem of ﬁnding indeﬁnite integrals, or quadra-
tures. A solution is expressed as a quadrature if it expressed in terms of elementary functions
and the functions appearing in the equation using a ﬁnite set of the arithmetic operations,
function compositions, and indeﬁnite integrals. An equation is said to be integrable by
quadrature if its general solution can be expressed in terms of quadratures.
* In what follows, we often call an ordinary differential equation a “differential equation” or, even shorter,
an “equation.”

◮Cauchy problem. The uniqueness and existence theorems. The Cauchy problem:
ﬁnd a solution of equation (M11.1.1.1) that satisﬁes the initial condition
y = y0
at
x = x0,
(M11.1.1.2)
where y0 and x0 are some numbers.
Geometrical meaning of the Cauchy problem:
ﬁnd an integral curve of equation
(M11.1.1.1) that passes through the point (x0, y0); see Fig. M11.1.
Condition (M11.1.1.2) is alternatively written y(x0) = y0 or y|x=x0 = y0.
THEOREM (EXISTENCE, PEANO). Let the function f(x, y) be continuous in an open
domain D of the xy-plane. Then there is at least one integral curve of equation (M11.1.1.1)
that passes through a point (x0, y0) ∈D; each of these curves can be extended at both ends
up to the boundary of any closed domain D0 ⊂D such that (x0, y0) belongs to the interior
of D0.
THEOREM (UNIQUENESS). Let the function f(x, y) be continuous in an open domain D
and have in D a bounded partial derivative with respect to y (or the Lipschitz condition
holds: |f(x, y) – f(x, z)| ≤M|y – z|, where M is some positive number and (x, z) ∈D).
Then there is a unique solution of equation (M11.1.1.1) satisfying condition (M11.1.1.2).
◮Equations not solved for the derivative.
The existence theorem.
A ﬁrst-order
differential equation not solved for the derivative can generally be written as
F(x, y, y′
x) = 0.
(M11.1.1.3)
THEOREM (EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS). There exists a unique solution y = y(x) of
equation (M11.1.1.3) satisfying the conditions y|x=x0 = y0 and y′
x|x=x0 = t0, where t0 is
one of the real roots of the equation F(x0, y0, t0) = 0 if the following conditions hold in a
neighborhood of the point (x0, y0, t0):
1. The function F(x, y, t) is continuous in each of the three arguments.
2. The partial derivative Ft exists and is nonzero.
3. There is a bounded partial derivative with respect to y, |Fy| ≤M.
The solution surely exists if |x – x0| ≤a, where a is a (sufﬁciently small) positive number.
◮Singular solutions. A point (x, y) at which the uniqueness of the solution to equa-
tion (M11.1.1.3) is violated is called a singular point. If conditions 1 and 3 of the existence
and uniqueness theorem hold, then
F(x, y, t) = 0,
Ft(x, y, t) = 0
(M11.1.1.4)

M11.1. FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

simultaneously at each singular point. Relations (M11.1.1.4) deﬁne a t-discriminant curve
in parametric form. In some cases, the parameter t can be eliminated from (M11.1.1.4) to
give an equation of this curve in implicit form, Ψ(x, y) = 0. If a branch y = ψ(x) of the
curve Ψ(x, y) = 0 consists of singular points and, at the same time, is an integral curve,
then this branch is called a singular integral curve and the function y = ψ(x) is a singular
solution of equation (M11.1.1.3).
The singular solutions can be obtained by ﬁnding the envelope of the family of integral
curves, Φ(x, y, C) = 0, of equation (M11.1.1.3). The envelope is part of the C-discriminant
curve, which is deﬁned by the equations
Φ(x, y, C) = 0,
ΦC(x, y, C) = 0.
The branch of the C-discriminant curve at which
(a) there exist bounded partial derivatives, |Φx| < M1 and |Φy| < M2, and
(b) |Φx| + |Φy| ≠0
is the envelope.
M11.1.2. Equations Solved for the Derivative. Simplest Techniques
of Integration
◮Equations with separated or separable variables.
1◦. An equation with separated variables (a separated equation) has the form
f(y)y′
x = g(x).
Equivalently, the equation can be rewritten as f(y) dy = g(x) dx (the right-hand side depends
on x alone and the left-hand side on y alone). The general solution can be obtained by
integration:
Z
f(y) dy =
Z
g(x) dx + C,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
2◦. An equation with separable variables (a separable equation) is generally represented
by
f1(y)g1(x)y′
x = f2(y)g2(x).
Dividing the equation by f2(y)g1(x), one obtains a separated equation. Integrating yields
Z f1(y)
f2(y) dy =
Z g2(x)
g1(x) dx + C.
Remark. Solutions corresponding to f2(y) = 0 may be lost when dividing the equation by f2(y)g1(x).
Therefore, the case of f2(y) = 0, should be treated separately.
Many ordinary differential equations are reduced to separable equations.
Example. The equation
y′
x = yf(eλxyk)
can be reduced, with the substitution z = eλxyk, to a separable equation: z′
x = λz + kzf(z).
Some other equations reducible to separable equations are considered below.

264
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
◮Equation of the form y′
x = f(ax + by). For b = 0, it is an equation with separated
variables. For b ≠0, the substitution z = ax+by brings the equation to a separable equation,
z′
x = bf(z) + a.
◮Homogeneous equation. A homogeneous equation remains the same under simulta-
neous scaling (dilation) of the independent and dependent variables in accordance with the
rule x →αx, y →αy, where α is an arbitrary constant (α ≠0). Such equations can be
represented in the form
y′
x = f
 y
x

.
The substitution u = y/x brings a homogeneous equation to a separable one, xu′
x = f(u)–u.
Remark. The equations of the form
y′
x = f
 a1x + b1y + c1
a2x + b2y + c2

can be reduced to a homogeneous equation. To this end, for a1x + b1y ≠k(a2x + b2y), one should use the
change of variables ξ = x – x0, η = y – y0, where the constants x0 and y0 are determined by solving the linear
algebraic system
a1x0 + b1y0 + c1 = 0,
a2x0 + b2y0 + c2 = 0.
As a result, one arrives at the following equation for η = η(ξ):
η′
ξ = f
 a1ξ + b1η
a2ξ + b2η

.
On dividing the numerator and denominator of the argument of f by ξ, one obtains a homogeneous equation
whose right-hand side is dependent on the ratio η/ξ only:
η′
ξ = f
 a1 + b1η/ξ
a2 + b2η/ξ

.
◮Generalized homogeneous equation.
1◦. A generalized homogeneous equation remains the same under simultaneous scaling of
the independent and dependent variables in accordance with the rule x →αx, y →αky,
where α≠0 is an arbitrary constant and k is some number. Such equations can be represented
in the form
y′
x = xk–1f(yx–k).
The substitution u = yx–k brings a generalized homogeneous equation to a separable
equation, xu′
x = f(u) – ku.
Example. Consider the equation
y′
x = ax2y4 + by2.
(M11.1.2.1)
Let us perform the transformation x = α¯x, y = αk¯y and then multiply the resulting equation by α1–k to
obtain
¯y′
¯x = aα3(k+1)¯x2¯y4 + bαk+1¯y2.
(M11.1.2.2)
It is apparent that if k = –1, the transformed equation (M11.1.2.2) is the same as the original one, up to notation.
This means that equation (M11.1.2.1) is generalized homogeneous of degree k = –1. Therefore, the substitution
u = xy brings it to a separable equation: xu′
x = au4 + bu2 + u.
2◦. Alternatively, a generalized homogeneous equation can be represented as
y′
x = y
x f(xnym).
The substitution z = xnym leads to a separable equation: xz′
x = nz + mzf(z).

M11.1. FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
265
◮Linear equation. A ﬁrst-order linear equation is written as
y′
x + f(x)y = g(x).
(M11.1.2.3)
The solution is sought in the product form y = uv, where v = v(x) is any function that
satisﬁes the “truncated” equation v′
x + f(x)v = 0 [as v(x) one takes the particular solution
v = e–F , where F =
R
f(x) dx]. As a result, one obtains the following separable equation
for u = u(x): v(x)u′
x = g(x). Integrating it yields the general solution:
y(x) = e–F Z
eF g(x) dx + C

,
F =
Z
f(x) dx,
where C is an arbitrary constant.
◮Bernoulli equation. A Bernoulli equation has the form
y′
x + f(x)y = g(x)ya,
a ≠0, 1.
(M11.1.2.4)
(For a = 0 and a = 1, it is a linear equation; see above.) The substitution z = y1–a brings it
to a linear equation, z′
x + (1 – a)f(x)z = (1 – a)g(x). With this in view, one can obtain the
general integral:
y1–a = Ce–F + (1 – a)e–F
Z
eF g(x) dx,
where
F = (1 – a)
Z
f(x) dx.
◮Equation with exponential nonlinearity reducible to a linear equation. Consider
the equation
y′
x = f(x)eλy + g(x).
The substitution u = e–λy leads to a linear equation: u′
x = –λg(x)u – λf(x).
M11.1.3. Exact Differential Equations. Integrating Factor
◮Exact differential equations. An exact differential equation has the form
f(x, y) dx + g(x, y) dy = 0,
where
∂f
∂y = ∂g
∂x .
(M11.1.3.1)
The left-hand side of the equation is the total differential of a function of two variables
U(x, y). In this case, the general integral is given by
U(x, y) = C,
where C is an arbitrary constant and the function U is determined from the system
∂U
∂x = f,
∂U
∂y = g.
Integrating the ﬁrst equation yields U =
R
f(x, y) dx+Ψ(y) (while integrating, the variable y
is treated as a parameter). On substituting this expression into the second equation, one
identiﬁes the function Ψ (and hence, U). As a result, the general integral of an exact
differential equation can be represented in the form
Z x
x0 f(ξ, y) dξ +
Z y
y0 g(x0, η) dη = C,
(M11.1.3.2)
where x0 and y0 are any numbers (from the domain of deﬁnition of the equation).

M11.1.4. Riccati Equation
◮General Riccati equation. A Riccati equation has the general form
y′
x = f2(x)y2 + f1(x)y + f0(x).
(M11.1.4.1)
If f2 ≡0, we have a linear equation, and if f0 ≡0, we have a Bernoulli equation (see equation
(M11.1.2.4) for a = 2), whose solutions were given previously. For arbitrary f2, f1, and f0,
the Riccati equation is not integrable by quadrature.
◮Use of particular solutions to construct the general solution.
1◦. Given a particular solution y0 = y0(x) of the Riccati equation (M11.1.4.1), the general
solution can be written as
y = y0(x) + Φ(x)

2◦. Let y1 = y1(x) and y2 = y2(x) be two different particular solutions of equation
(M11.1.4.1). Then the general solution can be expressed as

To the particular solution y1(x), there corresponds C = ∞; and to y2(x), there corresponds

3◦. Let y1 = y1(x), y2 = y2(x), and y3 = y3(x) be three distinct particular solutions of
equation (M11.1.4.1). Then the general solution can be found without quadrature:
y – y2
y – y1
y3 – y1
y3 – y2

◮Some transformations.
1◦. The transformation (ϕ, ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, and ψ4 are arbitrary functions)
x = ϕ(ξ),
y = ψ4(ξ)u + ψ3(ξ)
ψ2(ξ)u + ψ1(ξ)
reduces the Riccati equation (M11.1.4.1) to a Riccati equation for u = u(ξ).
2◦. Let y0 = y0(x) be a particular solution of equation (M11.1.4.1). Then the substitution

M11.1.5. Equations Not Solved for the Derivative
◮Method of “integration by differentiation.” In the general case, a ﬁrst-order equation
not solved for the derivative,
F(x, y, y′
x) = 0,
(M11.1.5.1)
can be rewritten in the equivalent form
F(x, y, t) = 0,
t = y′
x.
(M11.1.5.2)
We look for a solution in parametric form: x = x(t), y = y(t). In accordance with the ﬁrst
relation in (M11.1.5.2), the differential of F is given by
Fx dx + Fy dy + Ft dt = 0.
(M11.1.5.3)
Using the relation dy = t dx, we eliminate successively dy and dx from (M11.1.5.3). As a
result, we obtain the system of two ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations:
dx
dt = –
Ft
Fx + tFy
,
dy
dt = –
tFt
Fx + tFy
.
(M11.1.5.4)
By ﬁnding a solution of this system, one thereby obtains a solution of the original equa-
tion (M11.1.5.1) in parametric form, x = x(t), y = y(t).
Remark 1. The application of the above method may lead to loss of individual solutions (satisfying the
condition Fx + tFy = 0); this issue requires further investigation.
Remark 2. One of the differential equations of system (M11.1.5.4) can be replaced by the algebraic
equation F(x, y, t) = 0; see equation (M11.1.5.2). This technique is used further for solving some equations.
◮Equations of the form y = f(y′
x).
This equation is a special case of equation
(M11.1.5.1), with F(x, y, t) = y – f(t). The method of “integration by differentiation”
yields
dx
dt = f ′(t)
t
,
y = f(t).
(M11.1.5.5)
Note the original equation is used here instead of the second equation in system (M11.1.5.4);
this is convenient because the ﬁrst equation in (M11.1.5.4) does not depend on y explicitly.
Integrating the ﬁrst equation in (M11.1.5.5) yields the solution in parametric form,
x =
Z f ′(t)
t
dt + C,
y = f(t).
◮Equations of the form x = f(y′
x).
This equation is a special case of equation
(M11.1.5.1), with F(x, y, t) = x – f(t). The method of “integration by differentiation”
yields
x = f(t),
dy
dt = tf ′(t).
(M11.1.5.6)
Note the original equation is used here instead of the ﬁrst equation in system (M11.1.5.4);
this is convenient because the second equation in (M11.1.5.4) does not depend on x explic-
itly.
Integrating the second equation in (M11.1.5.6) yields the solution in parametric form,
x = f(t),
y =
Z
tf ′(t) dt + C.

M11.1. FIRST-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
269
◮Clairaut’s equation y = xy′
x + f(y′
x).
Clairaut’s equation is a special case of
equation (M11.1.5.1), with F(x, y, t) = y – xt – f(t). It can be rewritten as
y = xt + f(t),
t = y′
x.
(M11.1.5.7)
This equation corresponds to the degenerate case Fx+tFy ≡0, where system (M11.1.5.4)
cannot be obtained.
One should proceed in the following way: the ﬁrst relation in
(M11.1.5.7) gives dy = x dt + t dx + f ′(t) dt; performing the substitution dy = t dx, which
follows from the second relation in (M11.1.5.7), one obtains
[x + f ′(t)] dt = 0.
This equation splits into dt = 0 and x + f ′(t) = 0. The solution of the ﬁrst equation is
obvious: t = C; it gives the general solution of Clairaut’s equation,
y = Cx + f(C),
(M11.1.5.8)
which is a family of straight lines. The second equation generates a solution in parametric
form,
x = –f ′(t),
y = –tf ′(t) + f(t),
(M11.1.5.9)
which is a singular solution and is the envelope of the family of lines (M11.1.5.8).
Remark. There are also “compound” solutions of Clairaut’s equation; they consist of part of the curve
(M11.1.5.9) joined with the tangents at ﬁnite points; these tangents are deﬁned by formula (M11.1.5.8).
◮Lagrange’s equation y = xf(y′
x) + g(y′
x). Lagrange’s equation is a special case
of equation (M11.1.5.1), with F(x, y, t) = y – xf(t) – g(t). In the special case f(t) ≡t, it
coincides with Clairaut’s equation.
The method of “integration by differentiation” yields
dx
dt +
f ′(t)
f(t) – t x =
g′(t)
t – f(t) ,
y = xf(t) + g(t).
(M11.1.5.10)
Here, the original equation is used instead of the second equation in system (M11.1.5.4);
this is convenient because the ﬁrst equation in (M11.1.5.4) does not depend on y explicitly.
The ﬁrst equation of system (M11.1.5.10) is linear and can easily be integrated to obtain
a solution to Lagrange’s equation in parametric form.
Remark. With the above method, solutions of the form y = tkx + g(tk), where the tk are roots of the
equation f(t)–t = 0, may be lost. These solutions can be particular or singular solutions of Lagrange’s equation.
M11.1.6. Approximate Analytic Methods for Solution of Equations
◮Method of successive approximations (Picard’s method). The method of successive
approximations consists of two stages. At the ﬁrst stage, the Cauchy problem
y′
x = f(x, y)
(equation),
(M11.1.6.1)
y(x0) = y0
(initial condition)
(M11.1.6.2)
is reduced to the equivalent integral equation:
y(x) = y0 +
Z x
x0 f(t, y(t)) dt.
(M11.1.6.3)
Then a solution of equation (M11.1.6.3) is sought using the formula of successive approxi-
mations:
yn+1(x) = y0 +
Z x
x0 f(t, yn(t)) dt;
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The initial approximation y0(x) can be chosen arbitrarily; the simplest way is to take
y0(x) = y0. The iterative process converges as n →∞, provided the conditions of the
theorems in Subsection M11.1.1 are satisﬁed.

270
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
◮Method of Taylor series expansion in the independent variable. A solution of the
Cauchy problem (M11.1.6.1)–(M11.1.6.2) can be sought in the form of the Taylor series in
powers of (x – x0):
y(x) = y(x0) + y′
x(x0)(x – x0) + y′′
xx(x0)
2!
(x – x0)2 + · · · .
(M11.1.6.4)
The ﬁrst term y(x0) insolution(M11.1.6.4) is prescribedby the initial condition (M11.1.6.2).
The values of the derivatives of y(x) at x = x0 are determined from equation (M11.1.6.1)
and its derivative equations (obtained by successive differentiation), taking into account the
initial condition (M11.1.6.2). In particular, setting x = x0 in (M11.1.6.1) and substitut-
ing (M11.1.6.2), one obtains the value of the ﬁrst derivative:
y′
x(x0) = f(x0, y0).
(M11.1.6.5)
Further, differentiating equation (M11.1.6.1) yields
y′′
xx = fx(x, y) + fy(x, y)y′
x.
(M11.1.6.6)
On substituting x = x0, as well as the initial condition (M11.1.6.2) and the ﬁrst deriva-
tive (M11.1.6.5), into the right-hand side of this equation, one calculates the value of the
second derivative:
y′′
xx(x0) = fx(x0, y0) + f(x0, y0)fy(x0, y0).
Likewise, one can determine the subsequent derivatives of y at x = x0.
Solution (M11.1.6.4) obtained by this method can normally be used in only some
sufﬁciently small neighborhood of the point x = x0.
Example. Consider the Cauchy problem for the equation
y′
x = ey + cos x
with the initial condition y(0) = 0.
Since x0 = 0, we will be constructing a series in powers of x. It follows from the equation that y′
x(0) =
e0 + cos 0 = 2. Differentiating the original equation yields y′′
xx = eyy′
x – sin x. Using the initial condition
and the condition y′
x(0) = 2 just obtained, we have y′′
xx(0) = e0 × 2 – sin 0 = 2.
Similarly, we ﬁnd that
y′′′
xxx = eyy′′
xx + ey(y′
x)2 – cos x, whence y′′′
xxx(0) = e0 × 2 + e0 × 22 – cos 0 = 5.
Substituting the values of the derivatives at x = 0 into series (M11.1.6.4), we obtain the desired series
representation of the solution: y = 2x + x2 + 5
6 x3 + · · ·.
M11.1.7. Numerical Integration of Differential Equations
◮Method of Euler polygonal lines. Consider the Cauchy problem for the ﬁrst-order
differential equation
y′
x = f(x, y)
with the initial condition y(x0) = y0. Our aim is to construct an approximate solution
y = y(x) of this equation on an interval [x0, x∗].
Let us split the interval [x0, x∗] into n equal segments of length ∆x = x∗– x0
n
. We
seek approximate values y1, y2, . . . , yn of the solution y(x) at the partition points x1, x2,
. . . , xn = x∗.
For a given initial value y0 = y(x0) and a sufﬁciently small ∆x, the values of the unknown
function yk = y(xk) at the other points xk = x0 + k∆x are calculated successively by the
formula
yk+1 = yk + f(xk, yk)∆x
(Euler polygonal line),
where k = 0, 1, . . . , n – 1. The Euler method is a single-step method of the ﬁrst-order
approximation (with respect to the step ∆x).

M11.2. SECOND-ORDER LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
271
◮Single-step methods of the second-order approximation. Two single-step methods
for solving the Cauchy problem in the second-order approximation are speciﬁed by the
recurrence formulas
yk+1 = yk + f
 xk + 1
2 ∆x, yk + 1

(ﬁrst method),
yk+1 = yk + 1


fk + f(xk+1, yk + fk∆x)

∆x
(second method),
where fk = f(xk, yk); k = 0, 1, . . . , n – 1.
◮Runge–Kutta method of the fourth-order approximation. This is one of the widely
used methods. The unknown values yk are successively found by the formulas
yk+1 = yk + 1
6 (f1 + 2f2 + 2f3 + f4)∆x,
where
f1 = f(xk, yk),
f2 = f(xk + 1
2 ∆x, yk + 1
2 f1∆x),
f3 = f(xk + 1
2 ∆x, yk + 1
2 f2∆x),
f4 = f(xk + ∆x, yk + f3∆x).
Remark 1. All methods described in Subsection M11.1.7 are special cases of the Runge–Kutta method
(a detailed description of this method can be found in the monographs listed at the end of the current chapter).
Remark 2. In practice, calculations are performed on the basis of any of the above recurrence formulas
with two different steps ∆x, 1
2 ∆x and an arbitrarily chosen small ∆x. Then one compares the results obtained
at common points. If these results coincide within the given order of accuracy, one assumes that the chosen
step ∆x ensures the desired accuracy of calculations. Otherwise, the step is halved and the calculations are
performed with the steps 1
2 ∆x and 1
4 ∆x, after which the results are compared again, etc. (Quite often, one
compares the results of calculations with steps varying by a factor of ten or more.)

mogeneous linear equation has the form

(M11.2.1.6)
THEOREM (EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS). Onanopeninterval a<x<b, let the functions
f2, f1, f0, and g be continuous and f2 ≠0. Also let
y(x0) = A,
y′
x(x0) = B
be arbitrary initial conditions, where x0 is any point such that a < x0 < b, and A and B are
arbitrary prescribed numbers. Then a solution of equation (M11.2.1.6) exists and is unique.
This solution is deﬁned for all x ∈(a, b).
◮Formulas for the general solution.
1◦. The general solution of the nonhomogeneous linear equation (M11.2.1.6) is the sum
of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous linear equation (M11.2.1.1) and
any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M11.2.1.6).
2◦. Let y1 = y1(x), y2 = y2(x) be a fundamental system of solutions of the correspond-
ing homogeneous equation, with g ≡0. Then the general solution of nonhomogeneous

Remark. Given a nontrivial particular solution y1 = y1(x) of the homogeneous equation (with g ≡0), a
second particular solution y2 = y2(x) of the homogeneous equation can be calculated from formula (M11.2.1.3).
Then the general solution of equation (M11.2.1.6) can be constructed by (M11.2.1.3) and (M11.2.1.7).
3◦. Let ¯y1 and ¯y2 be respective solutions of the nonhomogeneous differential equations
L [¯y1] = g1(x) and L [¯y2] = g2(x), which have the same left-hand side but different right-
hand sides, where L [y] is the left-hand side of equation (M11.2.1.6). Then the function
¯y = ¯y1 + ¯y2 is also a solution of the equation L [¯y] = g1(x) + g2(x).

of (x – x0).*

Depending on the values of λ1 and λ2, three cases are possible. These cases are considered

ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
To construct the solution in each of the three cases, the following procedure should
be performed: substitute the above expressions of y1 (resp., y2) into the original equa-
tion (M11.2.2.1), taking into account (M11.2.2.4), and equate the coefﬁcients of (x – x0)n
and (resp., (x – x0)n ln |x – x0|) for like values of n to obtain recurrence relations for the
unknown coefﬁcients. The desired solution can be found from these recurrence relations.

(M11.2.3.5)
(The unknown is prescribed at one point, and its derivative at another point.)
Conditions (M11.2.3.2), (M11.2.3.3), (M11.2.3.4), and (M11.2.3.5) are called homoge-
neous if a1 = a2 = 0.
◮Simpliﬁcation of boundary conditions. The self-adjoint form of equations.
1◦. Nonhomogeneous boundary conditions can be reduced to homogeneous ones by the
change of variable z = A2x2 +A1x+A0 +y (the constants A2, A1, and A0 are selected using
the method of undetermined coefﬁcients). In particular, the nonhomogeneous boundary
conditions of the ﬁrst kind (M11.2.3.2) can be reduced to homogeneous boundary conditions
by the linear change of variable
z = y – a2 – a1
x2 – x1
(x – x1) – a1.
2◦. On multiplying by p(x) = exp

(M11.2.3.6)
Without loss of generality, we can further consider equation (M11.2.3.6) instead of
(M11.2.3.1). We assume that the functions p, p′
x, q, and r are continuous on the interval
x1 ≤x ≤x2, and p is positive.

◮Green’s function. Linear problems for nonhomogeneous equations. The Green’s
function of the ﬁrst boundary value problem for equation (M11.2.3.6) with homogeneous
boundary conditions (M11.2.3.2) is a function of two variables G(x, ξ) that satisﬁes the
following conditions:
1◦. G(x, ξ) is continuous in x for ﬁxed ξ, with x1 ≤x ≤x2 and x1 ≤ξ ≤x2.
2◦. G(x, ξ) is a solution of the homogeneous equation (M11.2.3.6), with r = 0, for all
x1 < x < x2 exclusive of the point x = ξ.
3◦. G(x, ξ) satisﬁes the homogeneous boundary conditions G(x1, ξ) = G(x2, ξ) = 0.
4◦. The derivative G′
x(x, ξ) has a jump of 1/p(ξ) at the point x = ξ, that is,
G′

For the second, third, and mixed boundary value problems, the Green’s function is
deﬁned likewise except that in 3◦one adopts, respectively, the homogeneous boundary
conditions (M11.2.3.3), (M11.2.3.4), and (M11.2.3.5), with a1 = a2 = 0.
The solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M11.2.3.6) subject to appropriate ho-
mogeneous boundary conditions is expressed in terms of the Green’s function as follows:*
y(x) =
Z x2
x1 G(x, ξ)r(ξ) dξ.
◮Representation of the Green’s function in terms of particular solutions. We consider
the ﬁrst boundary value problem. Let y1(x) and y2(x) be linearly independent particular
solutions of the homogeneous equation (M11.2.3.6), with r = 0, that satisfy the conditions
y1(x1) = 0,
y2(x2) = 0.
(Each of the solutions satisﬁes one of the homogeneous boundary conditions.)
The Green’s function is expressed in terms of solutions of the homogeneous equation
as follows:
G(x, ξ) =







y1(x)y2(ξ)

(M11.2.3.7)
where W(x) = y1(x)y′
2(x) – y′
1(x)y2(x) is the Wronskian determinant.
Remark. Formula (M11.2.3.7) can also be used to construct the Green’s functions for the second, third,
and mixed boundary value problems. To this end, one should ﬁnd two linearly independent solutions, y1(x)
and y2(x), of the homogeneous equation; the former satisﬁes the corresponding homogeneous boundary
condition at x = x1 and the latter satisﬁes the one at x = x2.

The Sturm–Liouville problem: Find the values λn of the parameter λ at which problem

the corresponding solutions yn = yn(x) are called eigenfunctions of the Sturm–Liouville
problem (M11.2.4.1)–(M11.2.4.2).
◮General properties of the Sturm–Liouville problem (M11.2.4.1)–(M11.2.4.2).
1◦. There are inﬁnitely (countably) many eigenvalues. All eigenvalues can be ordered so
that λ1 < λ2 < λ3 < · · · . Moreover, λn →∞as n →∞; hence, there can only be a ﬁnite
number of negative eigenvalues.
2◦. The eigenfunctions are deﬁned up to a constant factor. Each eigenfunction yn(x) has
precisely n – 1 zeros on the open interval (x1, x2).
3◦. Any two eigenfunctions yn(x) and ym(x), n ≠m, are orthogonal with weight ρ(x) on
the interval x1 ≤x ≤x2:
Z x2
x1 ρ(x)yn(x)ym(x) dx = 0
if
n ≠m.
4◦. An arbitrary function F(x) that has a continuous derivative and satisﬁes the boundary
conditions of the Sturm–Liouville problem can be decomposed into an absolutely and
uniformly convergent series in the eigenfunctions
F(x) =

5◦. If the conditions
q(x) ≥0,
s1k1 ≤0,
s2k2 ≥0
(M11.2.4.3)
hold true, there are no negative eigenvalues. If q ≡0 and k1 = k2 = 0, the least eigenvalue
is λ1 = 0, to which there corresponds an eigenfunction y1 = const. In the other cases where
conditions (M11.2.4.3) are satisﬁed, all eigenvalues are positive.

xx = f(x, y, y′
x).
(M11.3.1.1)
The general solution of this equation depends on two arbitrary constants, C1 and C2. In
some cases, the general solution can be written in explicit form, y = ϕ(x, C1, C2), but more
often implicit or parametric forms of the general solution are encountered.
◮Cauchy problem. The existence and uniqueness theorem. Cauchy problem: Find a
solution of equation (M11.3.1.1) satisfying the initial conditions

(M11.3.1.2)
(At a point x = x0, the value of the unknown function, y0, and its derivative, y1, are
prescribed.)
EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS THEOREM. Let f(x, y, z) be a continuous function in all its
arguments in a neighborhood of a point (x0, y0, y1) and let f have bounded partial derivatives
fy andfz inthisneighborhood, or the Lipschitz condition is satisﬁed: |f(x, y, z)–f(x, ¯y, ¯z)|≤

, where A is some positive number. Then a solution of equation (M11.3.1.1)
satisfying the initial conditions (M11.3.1.2) exists and is unique.
M11.3.2. Equations Admitting Reduction of Order
◮Equations not containing y explicitly. In the general case, a second-order equation
that does not contain y explicitly has the form
F(x, y′
x, y′′
xx) = 0.
(M11.3.2.1)
Such equations remain unchanged under an arbitrary translation of the dependent variable:
y →y + const. The substitution y′
x = z(x), y′′
xx = z′
x(x) brings (M11.3.2.1) to a ﬁrst-order
equation: F(x, z, z′
x) = 0.
◮Equations not containing x explicitly (autonomous equations). In the general case,
a second-order equation that does not contain x explicitly has the form
F(y, y′
x, y′′
xx) = 0.
(M11.3.2.2)
Such equations remain unchanged under an arbitrary translation of the independent vari-
able: x →x + const. Using the substitution y′
x = w(y), where y plays the role of the
independent variable, and taking into account the relations y′′
xx = w′
x = w′
yy′
x = w′
yw, one
can reduce (M11.3.2.2) to a ﬁrst-order equation: F(y, w, ww′
y) = 0.
Example 1. Consider the autonomous equation
y′′
xx = f(y),
which often arises in the theory of heat and mass transfer and combustion. The change of variable y′
x =w(y) leads
to a separable ﬁrst-order equation: ww′
y = f(y). Integrating yields w2 = 2F(y) + C1, where F(y) =
R
f(y) dy.
Solving for w and returning to the original variable, we obtain the separable equation y′
x = ±√2F(y) + C1. Its
general solution is expressed as
Z
dy
√2F(y) + C1
= ±x + C2,
where
F(y) =
Z
f(y) dy.
Remark. The equation y′′
xx = f(y + ax2 + bx + c) is reduced by the change of variable u = y + ax2 + bx + c
to an autonomous equation, u′′
xx = f(u) + 2a.

simultaneous translations of the independent and dependent variables in accordance with
the rule x →x + bc, y →y – ac, where c is an arbitrary constant.
For b = 0, see equation (M11.3.2.1). For b ≠0, the substitution bw = ax + by leads to
the autonomous equation, F(bw, w′

◮Homogeneous equations.
1◦. The equations homogeneous in the independent variable remain unchanged under
scaling of the independent variable, x →αx, where α is an arbitrary nonzero number. In
the general case, such equations can be written in the form

(M11.3.2.3)
The substitution z(y) = xy′

xx/y) = 0.
(M11.3.2.4)
The substitution z(x) = y′
x/y leads to a ﬁrst-order equation, F(x, z, z′
x + z2) = 0.
3◦. The equations homogeneous in both variables are invariant under simultaneous scaling
(dilatation) of the independent and dependent variables, x →αx and y →αy, where α is
an arbitrary nonzero number. In the general case, such equations can be written in the form

Example 2. The homogeneous equation

is reduced by the transformation t = ln |x|, w = y/x to the autonomous form: w′′
tt = f(w) + w. For solution of
this equation, see Example 1 above (the notation of the right-hand side has to be changed there).
◮Generalized homogeneous equations.
1◦. The generalized homogeneous equations remain unchanged under simultaneous scaling
of the independent and dependent variables in accordance with the rule x→αx and y →αky,
where α is an arbitrary nonzero number and k is some number. Such equations can be
written in the form
F(x–ky, x1–ky′

(M11.3.2.6)
The transformation t = ln x, w = x–ky leads to the autonomous equation,

(M11.3.2.7)
The transformation z = xnym, u = xy′

Remark. For m ≠0, equation (M11.3.2.7) is equivalent to equation (M11.3.2.6) in which k = –n/m. To
the particular values n = 0 and m = 0 there correspond equations (M11.3.2.3) and (M11.3.2.4) homogeneous
in the independent and dependent variables, respectively. For n = –m ≠0, we have an equation homogeneous
in both variables, which is equivalent to equation (M11.3.2.5).

(M11.3.2.8)
remain unchanged under simultaneous translation and scaling of variables, x →x + α

(M11.3.2.9)
is invariant under the simultaneous translation and scaling of variables, x →x + α and

◮Equations of the form F (x, xy′

M11.3.3. Methods of Regular Series Expansions with Respect to the
Independent Variable
A solution of the Cauchy problem
y′′
xx = f(x, y, y′
x),
(M11.3.3.1)
y(x0) = y0,
y′
x(x0) = y1
(M11.3.3.2)
can be sought in the form of a Taylor series in powers of the difference (x–x0), speciﬁcally:
y(x) = y(x0) + y′
x(x0)(x – x0) + y′′
xx(x0)
2!
(x – x0)2 + y′′′
xxx(x0)
3!
(x – x0)3 + · · · . (M11.3.3.3)
The ﬁrst two coefﬁcients y(x0) and y′
x(x0) in solution (M11.3.3.3) are deﬁned by the initial
conditions (M11.3.3.2). The values of the subsequent derivatives of y at the point x = x0 are

284
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
determined from equation (M11.3.3.1) and its derivative equations (obtained by successive
differentiation of the equation) taking into account the initial conditions (M11.3.3.2). In
particular, setting x = x0 in (M11.3.3.1) and substituting (M11.3.3.2), we obtain the value
of the second derivative:
y′′
xx(x0) = f(x0, y0, y1).
(M11.3.3.4)
Further, differentiating (M11.3.3.1) yields
y′′′
xxx = fx(x, y, y′
x) + fy(x, y, y′
x)y′
x + fy′
x(x, y, y′
x)y′′
xx.
(M11.3.3.5)
On substituting x = x0, the initial conditions (M11.3.3.2), and the expression of y′′
xx(x0)
of (M11.3.3.4) into the right-hand side of equation (M11.3.3.5), we calculate the value of
the third derivative:
y′′′
xxx(x0) = fx(x0, y0, y1) + y1fy(x0, y0, y1) + f(x0, y0, y1)fy′
x(x0, y0, y1).
The subsequent derivatives of the unknown are determined likewise.
The thus obtained solution (M11.3.3.3) can only be used in a small neighborhood of the
point x = x0.
Example. Consider the following Cauchy problem for a second-order nonlinear equation:
y′′
xx = yy′
x + y3;
(M11.3.3.6)
y(0) = y′
x(0) = 1.
(M11.3.3.7)
Substituting the initial values of the unknown and its derivative (M11.3.3.7) into equation (M11.3.3.6)
yields the initial value of the second derivative:
y′′
xx(0) = 2.
(M11.3.3.8)
Differentiating equation (M11.3.3.6) gives
y′′′
xxx = yy′′
xx + (y′
x)2 + 3y2y′
x.
(M11.3.3.9)
Substituting here the initial values from (M11.3.3.7) and (M11.3.3.8), we obtain the initial condition for the
third derivative:
y′′′
xxx(0) = 6.
(M11.3.3.10)
Differentiating (M11.3.3.9) followed by substituting (M11.3.3.7), (M11.3.3.8), and (M11.3.3.10), we ﬁnd that
y′′′′
xxxx(0) = 24.
(M11.3.3.11)
On substituting the initial data (M11.3.3.7), (M11.3.3.8), (M11.3.3.10), and (M11.3.3.11) into (M11.3.3.3), we
arrive at the Taylor series expansion of the solution about x = 0:
y = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4 + · · · .
(M11.3.3.12)
This geometric series is convergent only for |x| < 1. In this case, summing up the series (M11.3.3.12) gives the
exact solution of the Cauchy problem (M11.3.3.6)–(M11.3.3.7) of the form y(x) =
1
1 – x .
M11.3.4. Perturbation Methods in Problems with a Small Parameter
◮Preliminary remarks. Perturbation methods are widely used in nonlinear mechanics
and theoretical physics for solving problems that are described by differential equations with
a small parameter ε. The primary purpose of these methods is to obtain an approximate
solution that would be equally suitable at all (small, intermediate, and large) values of the
independent variable as ε →0.
It is further assumed that the order of the equation remains unchanged at ε = 0.
In many problems of nonlinear mechanics and theoretical physics, the independent
variable is dimensionless time t. Therefore, in this subsection we use the conventional t
(0 ≤t < ∞), instead of x.

M11.3. SECOND-ORDER NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
285
◮Method of regular (direct) expansion in powers of the small parameter. We consider
an equation of general form with a parameter ε:
y′′
tt + f(t, y, y′
t, ε) = 0.
(M11.3.4.1)
We assume that the function f can be represented as a series in powers of ε:
f(t, y, y′
t, ε) =
∞
X
n=0
εnfn(t, y, y′
t).
(M11.3.4.2)
Solutions of the Cauchy problem and various boundary value problems for equa-
tion (M11.3.4.1) with ε →0 are sought in the form of a power series expansion:
y =
∞
X
n=0
εnyn(t).
(M11.3.4.3)
One should substitute expression (M11.3.4.3) into equation (M11.3.4.1) taking into account
(M11.3.4.2). Then the functions fn are expanded into a power series in the small parameter
and the coefﬁcients of like powers of ε are collected and equated to zero to obtain a system
of equations for yn:
y′′
0 + f0(t, y0, y′
0) = 0,
(M11.3.4.4)
y′′
1 + F(t, y0, y′
0)y′
1 + G(t, y0, y′
0)y1 + f1(t, y0, y′
0) = 0,
F = ∂f0
∂y′ ,
G = ∂f0
∂y . (M11.3.4.5)
Only the ﬁrst two equations are written out here. The prime denotes differentiation with
respect to t. To obtain the initial (or boundary) conditions for yn, the expansion (M11.3.4.3)
should be taken into account.
The success in the application of this method is primarily determined by the possibility
of constructing a solution of equation (M11.3.4.4) for the leading term y0. It is signiﬁcant to
note that the other terms yn with n ≥1 are governed by linear equations with homogeneous
initial conditions.
Example 1. The Dufﬁng equation
y′′
tt + y + εy3 = 0
(M11.3.4.6)
with initial conditions
y(0) = a,
y′
t(0) = 0
describes the motion of a cubic oscillator, i.e., oscillations of a point mass on a nonlinear spring. Here, y is the
deviation of the point mass from the equilibrium and t is dimensionless time.
For ε →0, an approximate solution of the problem is sought in the form of the asymptotic expan-
sion (M11.3.4.3). We substitute (M11.3.4.3) into equation (M11.3.4.6) and initial conditions and expand in
powers of ε. On equating the coefﬁcients of like powers of the small parameter to zero, we obtain the following
problems for y0 and y1:
y′′
0 + y0 = 0,
y0(0) = a,
y′
0(0) = 0;
y′′
1 + y1 = –y3
0,
y1(0) = 0,
y′
1(0) = 0.
The solution of the problem for y0 is given by
y0 = a cos t.
Substituting this expression into the equation for y1 and taking into account the identity cos3 t= 1
4 cos 3t+ 3
4 cos t,
we obtain
y′′
1 + y1 = – 1
4 a3(cos 3t + 3 cos t),
y1(0) = 0,
y′
1(0) = 0.

286
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Integrating yields
y1 = – 3


+ O(ε2).
Remark 1. The term t sin t causes y1/y0 →∞as t →∞. For this reason, the solution obtained is
unsuitable at large times. It can only be used for εt ≪1; this results from the condition of applicability of the
expansion, y0 ≫εy1.
This circumstance is typical of the method of regular series expansions with respect to the small parameter;
in other words, the expansion becomes unsuitable at large values of the independent variable. Methods that
allow avoiding this difﬁculty are discussed below.
Remark 2. Growing terms as t →∞, like t sin t, that narrow down the domain of applicability of
asymptotic expansions are called secular.
◮Method of scaled parameters (Lindstedt–Poincar´e method). This method is usually
used for ﬁnding periodic solutions to equations of the form
y′′
tt + ω0y = εf(y, y′

(M11.3.4.7)
where ε ≪1.

(M11.3.4.8)
The constants ωk and functions yk(z) are determined; it is assumed that yk+1/yk = O(1).
By choosing appropriate ωk, one removes the secular terms from the solution.
Example 2. Consider the Dufﬁng equation (M11.3.4.6) once again. Following (M11.3.4.8), one performs
the change of variable
t = z(1 + εω1 + · · ·)
to obtain
y′′
zz + (1 + εω1 + · · ·)2(y + εy3) = 0.
(M11.3.4.9)
The solution is sought in the series form (M11.3.4.8), y = y0(z) + εy1(z) + · · ·. Substituting it into equa-
tion (M11.3.4.9) and matching the coefﬁcients of like powers of ε, one arrives at the following system of
equations for two leading terms of the series:
y′′
0 + y0 = 0,
(M11.3.4.10)
y′′
1 + y1 = –y3
0 – 2ω1y0,
(M11.3.4.11)
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to z.
The general solution of equation (M11.3.4.10) is given by
y0 = a cos(z + b),
(M11.3.4.12)
where a and b are constants of integration. Taking into account (M11.3.4.12) and rearranging terms, we reduce
equation (M11.3.4.11) to

(M11.3.4.13)
For ω1 ≠– 3
8 a2, the particular solution of equation (M11.3.4.13) contains a secular term proportional to
z cos(z + b). In this case, the condition of applicability of the expansion, y1/y0 = O(1), cannot be satisﬁed at
sufﬁciently large z. For this condition to be met, one should set
ω1 = – 3
8 a2.
(M11.3.4.14)
In this case, the solution of equation (M11.3.4.13) is given by
y1 =

(M11.3.4.15)
Subsequent terms of the expansion can be found likewise.
With (M11.3.4.12), (M11.3.4.14), and (M11.3.4.15), we obtain a solution of the Dufﬁng equation in the

M11.3. SECOND-ORDER NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
287
◮Averaging method (Van der Pol–Krylov–Bogolyubov scheme).
The averaging
method involves two stages.
First, the second-order nonlinear equation (M11.3.4.7) is
reduced with the transformation
y = a cos ϕ,
y′
t = –ω0a sin ϕ,
where
a = a(t),
ϕ = ϕ(t),
to an equivalent system of two ﬁrst-order differential equations:
a′
t = – ε
ω0
f(a cos ϕ, –ω0a sin ϕ) sin ϕ,
ϕ′
t = ω0 –
ε
ω0a f(a cos ϕ, –ω0a sin ϕ) cos ϕ.
(M11.3.4.16)
The right-hand sides of equations (M11.3.4.16) are periodic in ϕ, with the amplitude a
being a slow-varying function of time t. The amplitude and the oscillation character are
changing little during the time the phase ϕ changes by 2π.
At the second stage, the right-hand sides of equations (M11.3.4.16) are being averaged
with respect to ϕ. This procedure results in an approximate system of equations:
a′
t = – ε
ω0
fs(a),
ϕ′
t = ω0 –
ε
ω0a fc(a),
(M11.3.4.17)
where
fs(a) = 1

fc(a) = 1
2π
Z 2π
0
cos ϕ f(a cos ϕ, –ω0a sin ϕ) dϕ.
System (M11.3.4.17) is substantially simpler than the original system (M11.3.4.16)—the
ﬁrst equation in (M11.3.4.17), for the oscillation amplitude a, is a separable equation and,
hence, can readily be integrated; then the second equation in (M11.3.4.17) can also be
integrated.
M11.3.5. Galerkin Method and Its Modiﬁcations (Projection Methods)
◮General form of an approximate solution. Consider a boundary value problem for
the equation
F[y] – f(x) = 0
(M11.3.5.1)
with linear homogeneous boundary conditions* at the points x = x1 and x = x2 (x1 ≤x ≤x2).
Here, F is a linear or nonlinear differential operator of the second order (or a higher order
operator); y = y(x) is the unknown function and f = f(x) is a given function. It is assumed
that F[0] = 0.
Let us choose a sequence of linearly independent functions (called basis functions)
ϕ = ϕn(x)
(n = 1, 2, . . . , N)
(M11.3.5.2)
* Nonhomogeneous boundary conditions can be reduced to homogeneous ones by the change of variable
z = A2x2 + A1x + A0 + y (the constants A2, A1, and A0 are selected using the method of undetermined
coefﬁcients).

288
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
satisfying the same boundary conditions as y = y(x). According to all methods that will
be considered below, an approximate solution of equation (M11.3.5.1) is sought as a linear
combination
yN =
N
X
n=1
Anϕn(x),
(M11.3.5.3)
with the unknown coefﬁcients An to be found in the process of solving the problem.
The ﬁnite sum (M11.3.5.3) is called an approximation function. The remainder term
RN obtained after the ﬁnite sum has been substituted into the left-hand side of equation
(M11.3.5.1),
RN = F[yN] – f(x).
(M11.3.5.4)
If the remainder RN is identically equal to zero, then the function yN is the exact
solution of equation (M11.3.5.1). In general, RN /≡0.
◮Galerkin method. In order to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients An in (M11.3.5.3), consider another
sequence of linearly independent functions
ψ = ψk(x)
(k = 1, 2, . . . , N).
(M11.3.5.5)
Let us multiply both sides of (M11.3.5.4) by ψk and integrate the resulting relation over the
region V = {x1 ≤x ≤x2}, in which we seek the solution of equation (M11.3.5.1). Next, we
equate the corresponding integrals to zero (for the exact solutions, these integrals are equal
to zero). Thus, we obtain the following system of algebraic equations for the unknown
coefﬁcients An:
Z x2
x1 ψkRN dx = 0
(k = 1, 2, . . . , N).
(M11.3.5.6)
Relations (M11.3.5.6) mean that the approximation function (M11.3.5.3) satisﬁes equa-
tion (M11.3.5.1) “on the average” (i.e., in the integral sense) with weights ψk. Introducing
the scalar product 〈g, h〉=
Z x2
x1 gh dx of arbitrary functions g and h, we can consider equa-
tions (M11.3.5.6) as the condition of orthogonality of the remainder RN to all weight
functions ψk.
The Galerkin method can be applied not only to boundary value problems, but also
to eigenvalue problems (in the latter case, one takes f = λy and seeks eigenfunctions yn,
together with eigenvalues λn).
Mathematical justiﬁcation of the Galerkin method for speciﬁc boundary value problems
can be found in the literature listed at the end of Chapter M11. Below we describe some
other methods that are in fact special cases of the Galerkin method.
Remark. Most often, one takes suitable sequences of polynomials or trigonometric functions as ϕn(x) in
the approximation function (M11.3.5.3).
◮Bubnov–Galerkin method, the moment method, the least squares method.
1◦. The sequences of functions (M11.3.5.2) and (M11.3.5.5) in the Galerkin method can
be chosen arbitrarily. In the case of equal functions,
ϕk(x) = ψk(x)
(k = 1, 2, . . . , N),
(M11.3.5.7)
the method is often called the Bubnov–Galerkin method.

M11.3. SECOND-ORDER NONLINEAR DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
289
2◦. The moment method is the Galerkin method with the weight functions (M11.3.5.5)
being powers of x,
ψk = xk.
(M11.3.5.8)
3◦. Sometimes, the functions ψk are expressed in terms of ϕk by the relations
ψk = F[ϕk]
(k = 1, 2, . . .),
where F is the differential operator of equation (M11.3.5.1). This version of the Galerkin
method is called the least squares method.
◮Collocation method. In the collocation method, one chooses a sequence of points xk,
k = 1, . . . , N, and imposes the condition that the remainder (M11.3.5.4) be zero at these
points,
RN = 0
at
x = xk
(k = 1, . . . , N).
(M11.3.5.9)
When solving a speciﬁc problem, the points xk, at which the remainder RN is set equal
to zero, are regarded as most signiﬁcant. The number of collocation points N is taken equal
to the number of the terms of the series (M11.3.5.3). This allows one to obtain a complete
system of algebraic equations for the unknown coefﬁcients An (for linear boundary value
problems, this algebraic system is linear).
Note that the collocation method is a special case of the Galerkin method with the
sequence (M11.3.5.5) consisting of the Dirac delta functions:
ψk = δ(x – xk).
In the collocation method, there is no need to calculate integrals, and this essentially
simpliﬁes the procedure of solving nonlinear problems (although usually this method yields
less accurate results than other modiﬁcations of the Galerkin method).
Example. Consider the boundary value problem for the linear second-order ordinary differential equation
with variable coefﬁcients
y′′
xx + g(x)y – f(x) = 0
(M11.3.5.10)
subject to the boundary conditions of the ﬁrst kind
y(–1) = y(1) = 0.
(M11.3.5.11)
Assume that the coefﬁcients of equation (M11.3.5.10) are smooth even functions, so that f(x) = f(–x)
and g(x) = g(–x). We use the collocation method for the approximate solution of problem (M11.3.5.10)–
(M11.3.5.11).
1◦. Take the polynomials
yn(x) = x2n–2(1 – x2),
n = 1, 2, . . . N,
as the basis functions; they satisfy the boundary conditions (M11.3.5.11), yn(±1) = 0.
Let us consider three collocation points
x1 = –σ,
x2 = 0,
x3 = σ
(0 < σ < 1)
(M11.3.5.12)
and conﬁne ourselves to two basis functions (N = 2), so that the approximation function is taken in the form
y(x) = A1(1 – x2) + A2x2(1 – x2).
(M11.3.5.13)
Substituting (M11.3.5.13) into the left-hand side of equation (M11.3.5.10) yields the remainder
R(x) = A1

–2 + (1 – x2)g(x)

+ A2

2 – 12x2 + x2(1 – x2)g(x)

It must vanish at the collocation points (M11.3.5.12). Taking into account the properties f(σ) = f(–σ) and
g(σ) = g(–σ), we obtain two linear algebraic equations for the coefﬁcients A1 and A2:
A1

–2 + g(0)

+ 2A2 – f(0) = 0
(at x = 0),
A1

g(x) = 1 + x2.

On solving the corresponding system of algebraic equations (M11.3.5.14), we ﬁnd the coefﬁcients
A1 =

A2 = –

In Fig. M11.2, the solid line depicts the numerical solution to problem (M11.3.5.10)–(M11.3.5.11), with

both cases provide good agreement between the approximate and numerical solutions; the use of Chebyshev
points gives a more accurate result.

◮Method of partitioning the domain. The domain V = {x1 ≤x ≤x2} is split into N
subdomains: Vk = {xk1 ≤x ≤xk2}, k = 1, . . . , N. In this method, the weight functions are
chosen as follows:
ψk(x) =
n 1
for x ∈Vk,
0
for x ∉Vk.
The subdomains Vk are chosen according to the speciﬁc properties of the problem under
consideration and can generally be arbitrary (the union of all subdomains Vk may differ
from the domain V , and some Vk and Vm may overlap).
◮Least squared error method. Sometimes, in order to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients An of the
approximation function (M11.3.5.3), one uses the least squared error method based on the
minimization of the functional:
Φ =
Z x2
x1 R2
N dx →min .
(M11.3.5.17)
For given functions ϕn in (M11.3.5.3), the integral Φ is a function with respect to the
coefﬁcients An. The corresponding necessary conditions of minimum in (M11.3.5.17)
have the form
∂Φ
∂An

(n = 1, . . . , N).
This is a system of algebraic equations for the coefﬁcients An.

M11.3.6. Iteration and Numerical Methods
◮Method of successive approximations (Cauchy problem). The method of successive
approximations is implemented in two steps. First, the Cauchy problem

(M11.3.6.1)
y(x0) = y0,
y′
x(x0) = y′

(initial conditions)
(M11.3.6.2)
is reduced to an equivalent system of integral equations by the introduction of the new
variable u(x) = y′
x. These integral equations have the form

dt,
y(x) = y0 +
Z x

(M11.3.6.3)
Then the solution of system (M11.3.6.3) is sought by means of successive approximations
deﬁned by the following recurrence formulas:
un+1(x) = y′

 t, yn(t), un(t)

dt,
yn+1(x) = y0 +
Z x

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
As the initial approximation, one can take y0(x) = y0 and u0(x) = y′
0.
◮Runge–Kutta method (Cauchy problem). For the numerical integration of the Cauchy
problem (M11.3.6.1)–(M11.3.6.2), one often uses the Runge–Kutta method.
Let ∆x be sufﬁciently small. We introduce the following notation:
xk = x0 + k∆x,
yk = y(xk),
y′
k = y′
x(xk),
fk = f(xk, yk, y′
k);
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The desired values yk and y′

yk+1 = yk + y′

In practice, the step ∆x is determined in the same way as for ﬁrst-order equations (see
Remark 2 in Subsection M11.1.7).
◮Shooting method (boundary value problems). In order to solve the boundary value
problem for equation (M11.3.6.1) with the boundary conditions
y(x1) = y1,
y(x2) = y2,
(M11.3.6.4)
one considers an auxiliary Cauchy problem for equation (M11.3.6.1) with the initial condi-
tions
y(x1) = y1,
y′
x(x1) = a.
(M11.3.6.5)
(The solution of this Cauchy problem can be obtained by the Runge–Kutta method or some
other numerical method.)
The parameter a is chosen so that the value of the solution

292
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
y = y(x, a) at the point x = x2 coincides with the value required by the second boundary
condition in (M11.3.6.4):
y(x2, a) = y2.
First, one ﬁnds an a1 and an a2 (a1 < a2) such that
[y(x2, a1) – y2][y(x2, a2) – y2] < 0.
This implies that the desired a in (M11.3.6.5) belongs to the interval (a1, a2). Then a sequence of numbers an
such that
[y(x2, an–1) – y2][y(x2, an) – y2] < 0
is determined numerically, for example, by using the bisection method. The desired a is obtained as: a =
lim
n→∞an.
In a similar way one constructs the solution of the boundary value problem with mixed
boundary conditions
y(x1) = y1,
y′
x(x2) + ky(x2) = y2.
(M11.3.6.6)
In this case, one also considers the auxiliary Cauchy problem (M11.3.6.1), (M11.3.6.5).
The parameter a is chosen so that the solution y = y(x, a) satisﬁes the second boundary
condition in (M11.3.6.6) at the point x = x2.
M11.4. Linear Equations of Arbitrary Order

(M11.4.1.1)
The general solution of this equation is determined by the roots of the characteristic
equation
P(λ) = 0,
where
P(λ) = λn + an–1λn–1 + · · · + a1λ + a0.
(M11.4.1.2)
The following cases are possible:
1◦. All roots λ1, λ2, . . . , λn of the characteristic equation (M11.4.1.2) are real and distinct.
Then the general solution of the homogeneous linear differential equation (M11.4.1.1) has
the form
y = C1 exp(λ1x) + C2 exp(λ2x) + · · · + Cn exp(λnx).
2◦. There are m equal real roots λ1 = λ2 = · · · = λm (m ≤n), and the other roots are real
and distinct. In this case, the general solution is given by
y = exp(λ1x)(C1 + C2x + · · · + Cmxm–1)
+ Cm+1 exp(λm+1x) + Cm+2 exp(λm+2x) + · · · + Cn exp(λnx).
3◦. There are m equal complex conjugate roots λ1,2 = α ± iβ (2m ≤n), and the other roots
are real and distinct. In this case, the general solution is

m1, m2, . . . , mr, respectively, the left-hand side of the characteristic equation (M11.4.1.2)
can be represented as the product
P(λ) = (λ – λ1)m1(λ – λ2)m2 . . . (λ – λr)mr,

If the characteristic equation (M11.4.1.2) has complex conjugate roots λs = αs + iβs
and λs+1 = αs – iβs, then in the above solution, the corresponding functions exp(λsx) and
exp(λs+1x) should be replaced with exp(αsx) cos(βsx) and exp(αsx) sin(βsx), respectively,
in a similar way to that in Item 3◦.
Example 1. Find the general solution of the linear third-order equation
y′′′ + ay′′ – y′ – ay = 0.
Its characteristic equation is λ3 + aλ2 – λ – a = 0, or, in factorized form,
(λ + a)(λ – 1)(λ + 1) = 0.
Depending on the value of the parameter a, three cases are possible.
1. Case a ≠±1. There are three different roots, λ1 = –a, λ2 = –1, and λ3 = 1. The general solution of the
differential equation is expressed as y = C1e–ax + C2e–x + C3ex.
2. Case a = 1. There is a double root, λ1 = λ2 = –1, and a simple root, λ3 = 1. The general solution of the
differential equation has the form y = (C1 + C2x)e–x + C3ex.
3. Case a = –1. There is a double root, λ1 = λ2 = 1, and a simple root, λ3 = –1. The general solution of
the differential equation is expressed as y = (C1 + C2x)ex + C3e–x.
Example 2. Consider the linear fourth-order equation

Its characteristic equation, λ4 – 1 = 0, has four distinct roots, two real and two pure imaginary,
λ1 = 1,
λ2 = –1,
λ3 = i,
λ4 = –i.
Therefore, the general solution of the equation in question has the form (see Item 3◦)
y = C1ex + C2e–x + C3 sin x + C4 cos x.
◮Nonhomogeneous linear equations. Forms of particular solutions.

solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M11.4.1.3).
If the roots λ1, λ2, . . . , λn of the characteristic equation (M11.4.1.2) are all real and

M11.4. LINEAR EQUATIONS OF ARBITRARY ORDER AND LINEAR SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS

Problem (M11.4.1.3), (M11.4.1.6) can be solved using the Laplace transform based on

and the initial conditions (M11.4.1.6), we arrive at a linear algebraic equation for the
transform ey(p):
P(p)ey(p) – Q(p) = ef(p),
(M11.4.1.7)
where
P(p) = pn + an–1pn–1 + · · · + a1p + a0,
Q(p) = bn–1pn–1 + · · · + b1p + b0,
bk = yn–k–1 + an–1yn–k–2 + · · · + ak+2y1 + ak+1y0,
k = 0, 1, . . . , n – 1.
The polynomial P(p) coincides with the characteristic polynomial (M11.4.1.2) at λ = p.
The solution of equation (M11.4.1.7) is given by the formula
ey(p) =
ef(p) + Q(p)
eP(p)
.
(M11.4.1.8)
On applying the Laplace inversion formula (see in Section M10.2) to (M11.4.1.8), we obtain
a solution to problem (M11.4.1.3), (M11.4.1.6) in the form
y(x) =

(M11.4.1.9)
Since the transform ey(p) (M11.4.1.8) is a rational function, the inverse Laplace transform
(M11.4.1.9) can be obtained using the formulas from Subsection M10.2.2 or the tables of
Section S2.2.
Remark. In practice, the solution method for the Cauchy problem based on the Laplace transform leads to
the solution faster than the direct application of general formulas like (M11.4.1.4), where one has to determine
the coefﬁcients C1, . . . , Cn.
Example 3. Consider the following Cauchy problem for a homogeneous fourth-order equation:
y′′′′
xxxx + a4y = 0;
y(0) = y′
x(0) = y′′′
xxx(0) = 0,
y′′
xx(0) = b.
The Laplace transform reduces this problem to a linear algebraic equation for ey(p): (p4 + a4)ey(p) – bp = 0.
It follows that
ey(p) =
bp
p4 + a4 .
In order to invert this expression, let us use the table of inverse Laplace transforms S2.2.2 (see row 52) and take
into account that a constant multiplier can be taken outside the transform operator to obtain the solution to the

(M11.4.2.4)
The general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M11.4.2.4) is obtained as the sum
of the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation (M11.4.2.1) and any
particular solution of equation (M11.4.2.4).
2◦. Let y1(x), . . . , yn(x) be a fundamental system of solutions of the homogeneous equa-
tion (M11.4.2.1), and let W(x) be the Wronskian determinant (M11.4.2.3). Then the general

The substitution x = bet (b ≠0) leads to a constant coefﬁcient linear equation of the
form (M11.4.1.3).
Particular solutions of the homogeneous Euler equation [with f(x) ≡0] are sought in
the form y = xk. If all k are real and distinct, its general solution is expressed as
y(x) = C1|x|k1 + C2|x|k2 + · · · + Cn|x|kn.
Remark. To a pair of complex conjugate values k = α±iβ there corresponds a pair of particular solutions:
y = |x|α sin(β|x|) and y = |x|α cos(β|x|).

M11.4.3. Systems of Linear Equations with Constant Coefﬁcients
◮Systems of ﬁrst-order linear homogeneous equations. The general solution.
1◦. In general, a homogeneous linear system of ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equations
with constant coefﬁcients has the form
y′
1 = a11y1 + a12y2 + · · · + a1nyn,
y′
2 = a21y1 + a22y2 + · · · + a2nyn,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
y′
n = an1y1 + an2y2 + · · · + annyn,
(M11.4.3.1)
where a prime stands for the derivative with respect to x. In the sequel, all the coefﬁcients aij
of the system are assumed to be real numbers.
The homogeneous system (M11.4.3.1) has the trivial particular solution y1 = y2 = · · · =
yn = 0.
Superposition principle for a homogeneous system: any linear combination of particular
solutions of system (M11.4.3.1) is also a solution of this system.
The general solution of the system of differential equations (M11.4.3.1) is the sum of
its n linearly independent (nontrivial) particular solutions each multiplied by an arbitrary
constant.
Remark. System (M11.4.3.1) can be reduced to a single homogeneous linear constant-coefﬁcient nth-
order equation.
2◦. For brevity (and clarity), system (M11.4.3.1) is conventionally written in vector-matrix
form:
y′ = Ay,
(M11.4.3.2)
where y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn)T is the column vector of the unknowns and A = (aij) is the matrix
of the equation coefﬁcients. The superscript T denotes the transpose of a matrix or a vector.
So, for example, a row vector is converted into a column vector:
(y1, y2)T ≡
 y1
y2

.
The right-hand side of equation (M11.4.3.2) is the product of the n × n square matrix a by
the n × 1 matrix (column vector) y.
Let yk = (yk1, yk2, . . . , ykn)T be linearly independent particular solutions* of the homo-
geneous system (M11.4.3.1), where k = 1, 2, . . . , n; the ﬁrst subscript in ykm = ykm(x)
denotes the number of the solution and the second subscript (m = 1, . . . , n) indicates the
component of the vector solution. Then the general solution of the homogeneous system
(M11.4.3.2) is expressed as
y = C1y1 + C2y2 + · · · + Cnyn.
(M11.4.3.3)
A method for the construction of particular solutions that can be used to obtain the general
solution by formula (M11.4.3.3) is presented below.
* This means that the condition det |ykm(x)| ≠0 holds.

◮Systems of ﬁrst-order linear homogeneous equations. Particular solutions. Par-
ticular solutions to system (M11.4.3.1) are determined by the roots of the characteristic

(M11.4.3.4)
The following cases are possible:
1◦. Let λ be asimple real root of the characteristic equation (M11.4.3.4). The corresponding
particular solution of the homogeneous linear system of equations (M11.4.3.1) has the
exponential form
y1 = A1eλx,
y2 = A2eλx,
. . . ,
yn = Aneλx,
(M11.4.3.5)
where the coefﬁcients A1, A2, . . . , An are determined by solving the associated linear
homogeneous system of equations:
(a11 – λ)A1 + a12A2 + · · · + a1nAn = 0,
a21A1 + (a22 – λ)A2 + · · · + a2nAn = 0,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
an1A1 + an2A2 + · · · + (ann – λ)An = 0.
(M11.4.3.6)
The solution of this system is unique to within a constant factor.
If all roots of the characteristic equation λ1, λ2, . . . , λn are real and distinct, then the
general solution of system (M11.4.3.1) has the form
y1 = C1A11eλ1x + C2A12eλ2x + · · · + CnA1neλnx,
y2 = C1A21eλ1x + C2A22eλ2x + · · · + CnA2neλnx,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
yn = C1An1eλ1x + C2An2eλ2x + · · · + CnAnneλnx,
(M11.4.3.7)
where C1, C2, . . . , Cn are arbitrary constants. The second subscript in Amk indicates a
coefﬁcient corresponding to the root λk.
2◦. For each simple complex root, λ = α+iβ, of the characteristic equation (M11.4.3.4), the
corresponding particular solution is obtained in the same way as in the simple real root case;
the associated coefﬁcients A1, A2, . . . , An in (M11.4.3.5) will be complex. Separating the
real and imaginary parts in (M11.4.3.5) results in two real particular solutions to system
(M11.4.3.1); the same two solutions are obtained if one takes the complex conjugate root,
¯λ = α – iβ.
3◦. Let λ be a real root of the characteristic equation (M11.4.3.4) of multiplicity m. The
corresponding particular solution of system (M11.4.3.1) is sought in the form
y1 = P 1
m(x)eλx,
y2 = P 2
m(x)eλx,
. . . ,
yn = P n
m(x)eλx,
(M11.4.3.8)
where the P k
m(x)=
m–1
P
i=0
Bkixi are polynomials of degree m–1. The coefﬁcients of these poly-
nomials result from the substitution of expressions (M11.4.3.8) into equations (M11.4.3.1);
after dividing by eλx and collecting like terms, one obtains n equations, each representing
a polynomial equated to zero. By equating the coefﬁcients of all resulting polynomials
to zero, one arrives at a linear algebraic system of equations for the coefﬁcients Bki; the
solution to this system will contain m free parameters.

300
ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
4◦. For a multiple complex root, λ = α+iβ, of multiplicity m, the corresponding particular
solution is sought, just as in the case of a multiple real root, in the form (M11.4.3.8); here
the coefﬁcients Bki of the polynomials P k
m(x) will be complex. Finally, in order to obtain
real solutions of the original system (M11.4.3.1), one separates the real and imaginary parts
in formulas (M11.4.3.8), thus obtaining two particular solutions with m free parameters
each. The two solutions correspond to the complex conjugate roots λ = α ± iβ.
5◦. In the general case, where the characteristic equation (M11.4.3.4) has simple and mul-
tiple, real and complex roots (see Items 1◦–4◦), the general solution to system (M11.4.3.1)
is obtained as the sum of all particular solutions multiplied by arbitrary constants.
Example 1. Consider the homogeneous system of two linear differential equations
y′
1 = y1 + 4y2,
y′
2 = y1 + y2.
The associated characteristic equation,

1 – λ
4
1
1 – λ
 = λ2 – 2λ – 3 = 0,
has distinct real roots:
λ1 = 3,
λ2 = –1.
The system of algebraic equations (M11.4.3.6) for the solution coefﬁcients becomes
(1 – λ)A1 + 4A2 = 0,
A1 + (1 – λ)A2 = 0.
(M11.4.3.9)
Substituting the ﬁrst root, λ = 3, into system (M11.4.3.9) yields A1 = 2A2. We can set A1 = 2 and A2 = 1,
since the solution is determined to within a constant factor. Thus the ﬁrst particular solution of the homogeneous
system of linear ordinary differential equations (M11.4.3.9) has the form
y1 = 2e3x,
y2 = e3x.
(M11.4.3.10)
The second particular solution, corresponding to λ = –1, is found in the same way:
y1 = –2e–x,
y2 = e–x.
(M11.4.3.11)
The sum of the two particular solutions (M11.4.3.10) and (M11.4.3.11) multiplied by arbitrary constants,
C1 and C2, gives the general solution to the original homogeneous system of linear ordinary differential
equations:
y1 = 2C1e3x – 2C2e–x,
y2 = C1e3x + C2e–x.
Example 2. Consider the system of ordinary differential equations
y′
1 = –y2,
y′
2 = 2y1 + 2y2.
(M11.4.3.12)
The characteristic equation

–λ
–1
2
2 – λ
 = λ2 – 2λ + 2 = 0
has complex conjugate roots:
λ1 = 1 + i,
λ2 = 1 – i.
The algebraic system (M11.4.3.6) for the complex coefﬁcients A1 and A2 becomes
–λA1 – A2 = 0,
2A1 + (2 – λ)A2 = 0.
With λ = 1 + i, one nonzero solution is given by A1 = 1 and A2 = –1 – i. The corresponding complex solution
to system (M11.4.3.12) has the form
y1 = e(1+i)x,
y2 = (–1 – i)e(1+i)x.

M11.5. NONLINEAR EQUATIONS OF ARBITRARY ORDER
301
Separating the real and imaginary parts, taking into account the formulas
e(1+i)x = ex(cos x + i sin x) = ex cos x + iex sin x,
(–1 – i)e(1+i)x = –(1 + i)ex(cos x + i sin x) = ex(sin x – cos x) – iex(sin x + cos x),
and making linear combinations of them, one arrives at the general solution to the original system (M11.4.3.12):
y1 = C1ex cos x + C2ex sin x,
y2 = C1ex(sin x – cos x) – C2ex(sin x + cos x).
◮Nonhomogeneous systems of linear ﬁrst-order equations.
1◦. In general, a nonhomogeneous linear system of ﬁrst-order differential equations with
constant coefﬁcients has the form
y′
1 = a11y1 + a12y2 + · · · + a1nyn + f1(x),

2 = a21y1 + a22y2 + · · · + a2nyn + f2(x),

y′
n = an1y1 + an2y2 + · · · + annyn + fn(x).
(M11.4.3.13)
For brevity, the conventional vector notation will also be used:
y′ = Ay + f(x),
where f(x) = (f1(x), f2(x), . . . , fn(x))T.
The general solution of this system is the sum of the general solution to the corresponding
homogeneous system with fk(x) ≡0 [see system (M11.4.3.1)] and any particular solution
of the nonhomogeneous system (M11.4.3.13).
2◦. Let yk = (Dk1(x), Dk1(x), . . . , Dkn(x))T be particular solutions to the homogeneous lin-
ear system of ﬁrst-order constant-coefﬁcient differential equations (M11.4.3.1) that satisfy
the special initial conditions
yk(0) = 1,
ym(0) = 0
for
m ≠k;
k, m = 1, . . . , n.
Then the general solution to the nonhomogeneous system (M11.4.3.13) is expressed as

(M11.5.1.3)
(At a point x0, the values of the unknown function y(x) and all its derivatives of orders
≤n – 1 are prescribed.)
EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS THEOREM. Suppose the function f(x, y, z1, . . . , zn–1) is
continuous in all its arguments in a neighborhood of the point (x0, y0, y(1)
0 , . . . , y(n–1)
0
) and
has bounded derivatives with respect to y, z1, . . . , zn–1 in this neighborhood.
Then a
solution of equation (M11.5.1.1) satisfying the initial conditions (M11.5.1.3) exists and is
unique.
◮Reduction of an nth-order equation to a system of n ﬁrst-order equations. The
differential equation (M11.5.1.1) is equivalent to the following system of n ﬁrst-order
equations:
y′
0 = y1,

. . . ,
y′
n–2 = yn–1,
y′
n–1 = f(x, y0, y1, . . . , yn–1),

M11.5.2. Equations Admitting Reduction of Order
◮Equations not containing y, y′

(1 ≤k + 1 < n).
(M11.5.2.1)
Such equations are invariant under arbitrary translations of the unknown function, y →
y + const (the form of such equations is also preserved under the transformation u(x) =
y+akxk+· · ·+a1x+a0, where the am are arbitrary constants). The substitution z(x) = y(k+1)

(M11.5.2.2)
Such equations are invariant under arbitrary translations of the independent variable, x →

x = w(y) (where y plays the role of the independent variable)
reduces by one the order of an autonomous equation. Higher derivatives can be expressed
in terms of w and its derivatives with respect to the new independent variable, y′′

where Φ(u, v) is an arbitrary function of two variables. With equation (M12.1.1.4) solved
for u1 or u2, we often specify the general solution in the form
uk = Ψ(u3–k),
where k = 1 or 2 and Ψ(u) is an arbitrary function of one variable.
Remark. In the special case h(x, y, w) ≡0, one of the integrals of the characteristic system is w = C1.
Another integral may be determined from the ﬁrst equation in (M12.1.1.3).
Example. Consider the linear constant coefﬁcient equation
∂w
∂x + a ∂w
∂y = b.
The characteristic system for this equation is
dx
1 = dy
a = dw
b .
It has two independent integrals:
y – ax = C1,
w – bx = C2.
Hence, the general solution of the original equation is given by Φ(y – ax, w – bx) = 0. On solving this equation
for w, one obtains the general solution in explicit form
w = bx + Ψ(y – ax),
where Ψ(u) is an arbitrary function.

Φ(u1, . . . , un) = 0,
where Φ is an arbitrary function of n variables.
M12.1.2. Cauchy Problem
◮Two formulations of the Cauchy problem. Consider two formulations of the Cauchy
problem.
1◦. Generalized Cauchy problem. Find a solution w = w(x, y) of equation (M12.1.1.1)
satisfying the initial conditions
x = h1(ξ),
y = h2(ξ),
w = h3(ξ),
(M12.1.2.1)
where ξ is a parameter (α ≤ξ ≤β) and the hk(ξ) are given functions.
Geometric interpretation: ﬁnd an integral surface of equation (M12.1.1.1) passing
through the line deﬁned parametrically by equations (M12.1.2.1).
2◦. Classical Cauchy problem.
Find a solution w = w(x, y) of equation (M12.1.1.1)
satisfying the initial condition
w = ϕ(y)
at
x = 0,
(M12.1.2.2)
where ϕ(y) is a given function.
It is convenient to represent the classical Cauchy problem as a generalized Cauchy
problem by rewriting condition (M12.1.2.2) in the parametric form
x = 0,
y = ξ,
w = ϕ(ξ).
(M12.1.2.3)
◮Procedure of solving the Cauchy problem. The procedure of solving the Cauchy
problem (M12.1.1.1), (M12.1.2.1) involves several steps.
First, two independent inte-
grals (M12.1.1.2) of the characteristic system (M12.1.1.3) are determined. Then, to ﬁnd
the constants of integration C1 and C2, the initial data (M12.1.2.1) must be substituted into
the integrals (M12.1.1.2) to obtain
u1
 h1(ξ), h2(ξ), h3(ξ)

= C1,
u2
 h1(ξ), h2(ξ), h3(ξ)

= C2.
(M12.1.2.4)
Eliminating C1 and C2 from (M12.1.1.2) and (M12.1.2.4) yields
u1(x, y, w) = u1
 h1(ξ), h2(ξ), h3(ξ)

,
u2(x, y, w) = u2
 h1(ξ), h2(ξ), h3(ξ)

.
(M12.1.2.5)
Formulas (M12.1.2.5) are a parametric form of the solution of the Cauchy problem
(M12.1.1.1), (M12.1.2.1). In some cases, one may succeed in eliminating the parame-
ter ξ from relations (M12.1.2.5), thus obtaining the solution in an explicit form.

M12.2. CLASSIFICATION OF SECOND-ORDER LINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
307
Example 1. Consider the Cauchy problem for linear equation
∂w
∂x + a ∂w
∂y = bw
(M12.1.2.6)
subjected to the initial condition (M12.1.2.2).
The corresponding characteristic system for equation (M12.1.2.6),
dx
1 = dy
a = dw
bw ,
has two independent integrals
y – ax = C1,
we–bx = C2.
(M12.1.2.7)
Represent the initial condition (M12.1.2.2) in parametric form (M12.1.2.3) and then substitute the data
(M12.1.2.3) into the integrals (M12.1.2.7). As a result, for the constants of integration we obtain C1 = ξ and
C2 = ϕ(ξ). Substituting these expressions into (M12.1.2.7), we arrive at the solution of the Cauchy problem
(M12.1.2.6), (M12.1.2.2) in parametric form:
y – ax = ξ,
we–bx = ϕ(ξ).
By eliminating the parameter ξ from these relations, we obtain the solution of the Cauchy problem (M12.1.2.6),
(M12.1.2.2) in explicit form:
w = ebxϕ(y – ax).
Example 2. Consider the Cauchy problem for Hopf’s equation
∂w
∂x + w ∂w
∂y = 0
(M12.1.2.8)
subject to the initial condition (M12.1.2.2).
First, we rewrite the initial condition (M12.1.2.2) in the parametric form (M12.1.2.3).
Solving the
characteristic system
dx
1 = dy
w = dw
0 ,
(M12.1.2.9)
we ﬁnd two independent integrals,
w = C1,
y – wx = C2.
(M12.1.2.10)
Using the initial conditions (M12.1.2.3), we ﬁnd that C1 = ϕ(ξ) and C2 = ξ. Substituting these expressions
into (M12.1.2.10) yields the solution of the Cauchy problem (M12.1.2.8), (M12.1.2.2) in the parametric form
w = ϕ(ξ),
(M12.1.2.11)
y = ξ + ϕ(ξ)x.
(M12.1.2.12)
The straight lines deﬁned by equation (M12.1.2.12) are called characteristics. They have the slope ϕ(ξ) and
intersect the y-axis at the points ξ. On each characteristic, the function w has the same value equal to ϕ(ξ)
(generally, w takes different values on different characteristics).
For ϕ′(ξ) > 0, different characteristics do not intersect and, hence, formulas (M12.1.2.11) and (M12.1.2.12)
deﬁne a unique solution.
M12.2. Classiﬁcation of Second-Order Linear Partial
Differential Equations
M12.2.1. Equations with Two Independent Variables
◮Examples of equations encountered in applications. There are three basic types of
linear partial differential equations—parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic. The solutions
of the equations pertaining to each of the types have their own characteristic qualitative
differences.
The simplest example of a parabolic equation is the heat equation
∂w
∂t – ∂2w
∂x2 = 0,
(M12.2.1.1)

308
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
where the variables t and x play the role of time and the spatial coordinate, respectively. Note
that equation(M12.2.1.1) containsonly one highest derivative term. Frequentlyencountered
particular solutions of equation (M12.2.1.1) can be found at the end of Subsection M12.4.1.
The simplest example of a hyperbolic equation is the wave equation
∂2w
∂t2 – ∂2w
∂x2 = 0,
(M12.2.1.2)
where the variables t and x play the role of time and the spatial coordinate, respectively.
Note that the highest derivative terms in equation (M12.2.1.2) differ in sign. The general
solution of equation (M12.2.1.2) can be found at the end of Subsection M12.4.1.
The simplest example of an elliptic equation is the Laplace equation
∂2w
∂x2 + ∂2w
∂y2 = 0,
(M12.2.1.3)
where x and y play the role of the spatial coordinates. Note that the highest derivative
terms in equation (M12.2.1.3) have like signs. Frequently encountered particular solutions
of equation (M12.2.1.3) can be found at the end of Subsection M12.4.1.
Any linear partial differential equation of the second order with two independent vari-
ables can be reduced, by appropriate manipulations, to a simpler equation that has one of the
threehighest derivative combinations speciﬁedabove in examples (M12.2.1.1), (M12.2.1.2),
and (M12.2.1.3).
◮Types of equations. Characteristic equations. Consider a second-order partial dif-
ferential equation with two independent variables that has the general form
a(x, y) ∂2w
∂x2 + 2b(x, y) ∂2w

∂y2 = F

(M12.2.1.4)
where a, b, c are some functions of x and y that have continuous derivatives up to the second
order inclusive.*
Given a point (x, y), equation (M12.2.1.4) is said to be
parabolic
if b2 – ac = 0,
hyperbolic
if b2 – ac > 0,
elliptic
if b2 – ac < 0
at this point.
In order to reduce equation (M12.2.1.4) to a canonical form, one should ﬁrst write out
the characteristic equation
a (dy)2 – 2b dx dy + c (dx)2 = 0,
which splits into two equations
a dy –

(M12.2.1.5)
and
a dy –

(M12.2.1.6)
and then ﬁnd their general integrals.
* The right-hand side of equation (M12.2.1.4) may be nonlinear. The classiﬁcation and the procedure of
reducing such equations to a canonical form are only determined by the left-hand side of the equation.

M12.2. CLASSIFICATION OF SECOND-ORDER LINEAR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
309
Remark. The characteristic equations (M12.2.1.5) and (M12.2.1.6) may be used if a /≡0. If a ≡0, the
simpler equations
dx = 0,
2b dy – c dx = 0
should be used; the ﬁrst equation has the obvious general solution x = C.
◮Canonical form of parabolic equations (case b2 – ac = 0). In this case, equations
(M12.2.1.5) and (M12.2.1.6) coincide and have a common general integral,
ϕ(x, y) = C.
By passing from x, y to new independent variables ξ, η in accordance with the relations
ξ = ϕ(x, y),
η = η(x, y),
where η = η(x, y) is any twice differentiable function that satisﬁes the condition of nonde-
generacy of the Jacobian D(ξ,η)
D(x,y) in the given domain, we reduce equation (M12.2.1.4) to the
canonical form

.
(M12.2.1.7)
As η, one can take η = x or η = y.
It is apparent that the transformed equation (M12.2.1.7) has only one highest-derivative
term, just as the heat equation (M12.2.1.1).
Remark. In the degenerate case where the function F1 does not depend on the partial derivative ∂ξw,
equation (M12.2.1.7) is an ordinary differential equation for the variable η, in which ξ serves as a parameter.
◮Canonical forms of hyperbolic equations (case b2 – ac > 0). The general integrals
ϕ(x, y) = C1,
ψ(x, y) = C2
of equations (M12.2.1.5) and (M12.2.1.6) are real and different. These integrals determine
two different families of real characteristics.
By passing from x, y to new independent variables ξ, η in accordance with the relations
ξ = ϕ(x, y),
η = ψ(x, y),
we reduce equation (M12.2.1.4) to
∂2w
∂ξ∂η = F2

ξ, η, w, ∂w
∂ξ , ∂w

.
This is the so-called ﬁrst canonical form of a hyperbolic equation.
The transformation
ξ = t + z,
η = t – z
brings the above equation to another canonical form,

∂z2 = F3

t, z, w, ∂w

where F3 = 4F2. This is the so-called second canonical form of a hyperbolic equation.
Apart from notation, the left-hand side of the last equation coincides with that of the wave
equation (M12.2.1.2).
In some cases, reduction of an equation to a canonical form allows ﬁnding its general
solution.

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
◮Canonical form of elliptic equations (case b2 – ac < 0). In this case the general
integrals of equations (M12.2.1.5) and (M12.2.1.6) are complex conjugate; these determine
two families of complex characteristics.
Let the general integral of equation (M12.2.1.5) have the form
ϕ(x, y) + iψ(x, y) = C,
i2 = –1,
where ϕ(x, y) and ψ(x, y) are real-valued functions.
By passing from x, y to new independent variables ξ, η in accordance with the relations
ξ = ϕ(x, y),
η = ψ(x, y),
we reduce equation (M12.2.1.4) to the canonical form

Every equation of mathematical physics governs inﬁnitely many qualitatively similar phe-

under study is isolated from the set of particular solutions of the given differential equation

value problem (M12.3.1.7)–(M12.3.1.9) is said to be homogeneous if Φ ≡0 and g ≡0.
M12.3.2. First, Second, Third, and Mixed Boundary Value Problems
For any (parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic) second-order partial differential equations, it is
conventional to distinguish four basic types of boundary value problems, depending on the
form of the boundary conditions (M12.3.1.4) [see alsothe analogous condition (M12.3.1.9)].
For simplicity, here we conﬁne ourselves to the case where the coefﬁcients aij of equations
(M12.3.1.1) and (M12.3.1.5), with the operator deﬁned by (M12.3.1.2), have the special
form
aij(x, t) = a(x, t)δij,
δij =
n 1
if i = j,
0
if i ≠j.
This situation is rather frequent in applications; such coefﬁcients are used to describe various
phenomena (processes) in isotropic media.
◮First boundary value problem. The function w(x, t) takes prescribed values at the
boundary S of the domain:
w(x, t) = g1(x, t)
for
x ∈S.
(M12.3.2.1)
◮Second boundary value problem. The derivative along the (outward) normal is pre-
scribed at the boundary S of the domain:
∂w
∂N = g2(x, t)
for
x ∈S.
(M12.3.2.2)
In heat transfer problems, where w is temperature, the left-hand side of the boundary
condition (M12.3.2.2) is proportional to the heat ﬂux per unit area of the surface S.

and its normal derivative is prescribed at the boundary S of the domain:
∂w
∂N + k(x, t)w = g3(x, t)
for
x ∈S.
(M12.3.2.3)

tion, the boundary condition (M12.3.2.3) with g3 ≡0 describes a surface chemical reaction
of the ﬁrst order.
◮Mixed boundary value problems. Conditions of various types, listed above, are set at
different portions of the boundary S.
If g1 ≡0, g2 ≡0, or g3 ≡0, the respective boundary conditions (M12.3.2.1), (M12.3.2.2),
and (M12.3.2.3) are said to be homogeneous.
Boundary conditions for various boundary value problems for parabolic and hyperbolic
equations in two independent variables x and t are displayed in Table M12.2. The equation
coefﬁcients are assumed to be continuous, with the coefﬁcients of the highest derivatives
being nonzero in the range x1 ≤x ≤x2 considered.
Remark 1. For elliptic equations, the coefﬁcients aij as well as the right-hand sides of the boundary
conditions (M12.3.2.1)–(M12.3.2.3) are independent of time t.
Remark 2. For elliptic equations, the ﬁrst boundary value problem is often called the Dirichlet problem,
and the second boundary value problem is called the Neumann problem.

Equations
M12.4.1. Homogeneous Linear Equations and Their Particular
Solutions
◮Preliminary remarks. For brevity, in this paragraph a homogeneous linear partial
differential equation will be written as
L[w] = 0.
(M12.4.1.1)
For second-order linear parabolic and hyperbolic equations, the linear differential opera-
tor L[w] is deﬁned by the left-hand side of equations (M12.3.1.1) and (M12.3.1.5), respec-
tively. It is assumed that equation (M12.4.1.1) is an arbitrary homogeneous linear partial
differential equation of any order in the variables t, x1, . . . , xn with sufﬁciently smooth
coefﬁcients.

M12.4. PROPERTIES AND EXACT SOLUTIONS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS
315
A linear differential operator L possesses the properties
L[w1 + w2] = L[w1] + L[w2],
L[Aw] = AL[w],
A = const.
An arbitrary homogeneous linear equation (M12.4.1.1) has a trivial solution, w ≡0.
A function w is called a classical solution of equation (M12.4.1.1) if w, when substituted
into (M12.4.1.1), turns the equation into an identity and if all partial derivatives of w that
occur in (M12.4.1.1) are continuous; the notion of a classical solution is directly linked to
the range of the independent variables. In what follows, we usually write “solution” instead
of “classical solution” for brevity.
◮Use of particular solutions for the construction of other solutions. Below are some
properties of particular solutions of homogeneous linear equations.
1◦. Let w1 = w1(x, t), w2 = w2(x, t), . . . , wk = wk(x, t) be any particular solutions of the
homogeneous equation (M12.4.1.1). Then the linear combination
w = A1w1 + A2w2 + · · · + Akwk
(M12.4.1.2)
with arbitrary constants A1, A2, . . . , Ak is also a solution of equation (M12.4.1.1); in
physics, this property is known as the principle of linear superposition.
Suppose {wk} is an inﬁnite sequence of solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1). Then the
series
∞
P
k=1
wk, irrespective of its convergence, is called a formal solution of (M12.4.1.1). If
the solutions wk are classical, the series is uniformly convergent, and the sum of the series
has all the necessary partial derivatives, then the sum of the series is a classical solution of
equation (M12.4.1.1).
2◦. Let the coefﬁcients of the linear differential operator L be independent of time t. If
equation (M12.4.1.1) has a particular solution ew = ew(x, t), then the partial derivatives of ew
with respect to time,*
∂ew
∂t ,
∂2ew
∂t2 ,
. . . ,
∂k ew
∂tk ,
. . . ,
are also solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1).
3◦. Let the coefﬁcients of the linear differential operator L be independent of the space
variables x1, . . . , xn. If equation (M12.4.1.1) has a particular solution ew = ew(x, t), then the
partial derivatives of ew with respect to the space coordinates

. . .
are also solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1).
If the coefﬁcients of L are independent of only one space coordinate, say x1, and
equation (M12.4.1.1) has a particular solution ew = ew(x, t), then the partial derivatives
∂ew
∂x1

are also solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1).
* Here and in what follows, it is assumed that the particular solution ew is differentiable sufﬁciently many
times with respect to t and x1, . . . , xn (or the parameters).

316
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
4◦. Let the coefﬁcients of the linear differential operator L be constant and let equa-
tion (M12.4.1.1) have a particular solution ew = ew(x, t). Then any partial derivatives of ew
with respect to time and the space coordinates (including mixed derivatives)

. . .
are solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1).
5◦. Suppose equation (M12.4.1.1) has a particular solution dependent on a parameter µ,
ew = ew(x, t; µ), and the coefﬁcients of the linear differential operator L are independent of µ
(but can depend on time and the space coordinates). Then, by differentiating ew with respect
to µ, one obtains other solutions of equation (M12.4.1.1),
∂ew
∂µ ,
∂2ew
∂µ2 ,
. . . ,
∂k ew
∂µk ,
. . .
Example 1. A linear heat equation with a source of the form
∂w
∂t = a ∂2w
∂x2 + bw
has a particular solution
w(x, t) = exp[µx + (aµ2 + b)t],
where µ is an arbitrary constant. Differentiating this solution with respect to µ yields another solution
w(x, t) = (x + 2aµt) exp[µx + (aµ2 + b)t].
Let some constants µ1, . . . , µk belong to the range of the parameter µ. Then the sum
w = A1ew(x, t; µ1) + · · · + Ak ew(x, t; µk),
(M12.4.1.3)
where A1, . . . , Ak are arbitrary constants, is also a solution of the homogeneous linear
equation (M12.4.1.1). The number of terms in the sum (M12.4.1.3) can be both ﬁnite and
inﬁnite.
6◦. Another effective way of constructing solutions involves the following considerations.
The particular solution ew(x, t; µ), which depends on the parameter µ (as before, it is
assumed that the coefﬁcients of the linear differential operator L are independent of µ), is
ﬁrst multiplied by an arbitrary function ϕ(µ). Then the resulting expression is integrated
with respect to µ over some interval [α, β]. Thus, one obtains a new function,
Z β
α
ew(x, t; µ)ϕ(µ) dµ,
which is also a solution of the original homogeneous linear equation.
The properties listed in Items 1◦– 6◦enable one to use known particular solutions
to construct other particular solutions of homogeneous linear equations of mathematical
physics.
◮Multiplicative separable solutions.
Many homogeneous linear partial differential
equations have solutions that can be represented as the product of functions depending
on different arguments. Such solutions are referred to as multiplicative separable solu-
tions; very commonly these solutions are brieﬂy, but less accurately, called just separable
solutions.

Table M12.3 presents the most commonly encountered types of homogeneous linear
differential equations with many independent variables that admit exact separable solu-
tions. Linear combinations of particular solutions that correspond to different values of the
separation parameters, λ, β1, . . . , βn, are also solutions of the equations in question. For
brevity, the word “operator” is used below to denote “linear differential operator.”
For a constant coefﬁcient equation (see the ﬁrst row in Table M12.3), the separation
parameters must satisfy the algebraic equation
D(λ, β1, . . . , βn) = 0,
(M12.4.1.4)
which results from substituting the solution into equation (M12.4.1.1). In physical appli-
cations, equation (M12.4.1.4) is usually referred to as a dispersion equation. Any n of the
n + 1 separation parameters in (M12.4.1.4) can be treated as arbitrary.
Example 2. Consider the telegraph equation
∂2w
∂t2 + k ∂w
∂t = a2 ∂2w
∂x2 + b ∂w
∂x + cw.
A particular solution is sought in the form
w = A exp(βx + λt).
This results in the dispersion equation λ2 + kλ = a2β2 + bβ + c, where one of the two parameters β or λ can
be treated as arbitrary.
Remark 1. For stationary equations that do not depend on t, one should set λ = 0, Lt[w] ≡0, and ϕ(t) ≡1
in rows 1, 6, and 7 of Table M12.3.

M12.4.2. Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations and Their Particular
Solutions
◮Simplest properties of nonhomogeneous linear equations. For brevity, we write a
nonhomogeneous linear partial differential equation in the form
L[w] = Φ(x, t),
(M12.4.2.1)
where the linear differential operator L is deﬁned above (see the beginning of Subsec-
tion M12.4.1).
Below are the simplest properties of particular solutions of the nonhomogeneous equa-
tion (M12.4.2.1).
1◦. If ewΦ(x, t) is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M12.4.2.1) and
ew0(x, t) is a particular solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation (M12.4.1.1),
then the sum
Aew0(x, t) + ewΦ(x, t),
with arbitrary constant A, is also a solution of the nonhomogeneous equation (M12.4.2.1).
The following, more general statement holds: The general solution of the nonhomogeneous
equation (M12.4.2.1) is the sum of the general solution of the corresponding homoge-
neous equation (M12.4.1.1) and any particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equa-
tion (M12.4.2.1).
2◦. Suppose w1 and w2 are solutions of nonhomogeneous linear equations with the same
left-hand side and different right-hand sides, i.e.,
L[w1] = Φ1(x, t),
L[w2] = Φ2(x, t).
Then the function w = w1 + w2 is a solution of the equation
L[w] = Φ1(x, t) + Φ2(x, t).

320
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
◮Fundamental and particular solutions of stationary equations. Consider the second-
order linear stationary (time-independent) nonhomogeneous equation
Lx[w] = –Φ(x).
(M12.4.2.2)
Here, Lx is a linear differential operator of the second (or any) order of general form whose
coefﬁcients are dependent on x, where x ∈Rn.
A function
=
(x, y) that satisﬁes the equation with a special right-hand side
Lx[ ] = –δ(x – y)
(M12.4.2.3)
is called a fundamental solution corresponding to the operator Lx. In (M12.4.2.3), δ(x) is
an n-dimensional Dirac delta function and the vector quantity y = {y1, . . . , yn} appears in
equation (M12.4.2.3) as an n-dimensional free parameter. It is assumed that y ∈Rn.
The n-dimensional Dirac delta function possesses the following basic properties:
1.
δ(x) = δ(x1)δ(x2) . . . δ(xn),
2.
Z
Rn Φ(y)δ(x – y) dy = Φ(x),
where δ(xk) is the one-dimensional Dirac delta function, Φ(x) is an arbitrary continuous
function, and dy = dy1 . . . dyn.
For constant coefﬁcient equations, a fundamental solution always exists.
The fundamental solution
=
(x, y) can be used to construct a particular solution of
the linear stationary nonhomogeneous equation (M12.4.2.2) for arbitrary continuous Φ(x);
this particular solution is expressed as follows:
w(x) =
Z
Rn Φ(y) (x, y) dy.
(M12.4.2.4)
Remark 1. The fundamental solution
is not unique; it is deﬁned up to an additive term w0 = w0(x),
which is an arbitrary solution of the homogeneous equation Lx[w0] = 0.
Remark 2. For constant coefﬁcient differential equations, the fundamental solution possesses the property
(x, y) =
(x – y).
Remark 3. The right-hand sides of equations (M12.4.2.2) and (M12.4.2.3) are often preﬁxed with the
plus sign. In this case, formula (M12.4.2.4) remains valid.

(M12.5.1.3)
We assume that the coefﬁcients of equation (M12.5.1.1) and boundary conditions
(M12.5.1.2) meet the following requirements:
a(x), b(x), c(x), and γ(t) are continuous functions; a(x) > 0, |s1| + |k1| > 0, |s2| + |k2| > 0.
Remark. In various applications, equations of the form (M12.5.1.1) may arise with the coefﬁcient b(x)
going to inﬁnity at the boundary, b(x) →∞as x →x1, with the other coefﬁcients being continuous. In this
case, the ﬁrst boundary condition in (M12.5.1.2) should be replaced with a condition of boundedness of the
solution as x →x1. This may occur in spatial problems with central or axial symmetry where the solution
depends only on the radial coordinate.
◮Derivation of equations and boundary conditions for particular solutions. The
method of separation of variables is based on searching for particular solutions of equa-
tion (M12.5.1.1) in the product form
w(x, t) = ϕ(x) ψ(t).
(M12.5.1.4)
Let us substitute (M12.5.1.4) into (M12.5.1.1) and divide all terms of the equation by
ϕ(x) ψ(t). Then we move the terms dependent on t to the left-hand side and those dependent
on x to the right-hand side to obtain
ψ′
t
ψ – γ(t) = a(x)ϕ′′
xx + b(x)ϕ′
x + c(x)ϕ

This equality is achieved if both sides are equal to the same constant quantity, –λ. The
free parameter λ is called the separation constant. Thus, we arrive at the following linear
ordinary differential equations for ϕ = ϕ(x) and ψ = ψ(t):
a(x)ϕ′′
xx + b(x)ϕ′
x + [λ + c(x)]ϕ = 0,
(M12.5.1.5)

◮Solution of eigenvalue problems. Orthogonality of eigenfunctions. Let eϕ1(x, λ) and

(M12.5.1.8)
where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants.

322
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS
Substituting solution (M12.5.1.8) into the boundary conditions (M12.5.1.7) yields the
following homogeneous linear algebraic system of equations for C1 and C2:
σ11(λ)C1 + σ12(λ)C2 = 0,
σ21(λ)C1 + σ22(λ)C2 = 0,
(M12.5.1.9)
where σij(λ) =

x=xi. For system (M12.5.1.9) to have nontrivial solutions,
its determinant must be zero; we have
σ11(λ)σ22(λ) – σ12(λ)σ21(λ) = 0.
(M12.5.1.10)
Solving the transcendental equation (M12.5.1.10) for λ, one obtains the eigenvalues λ = λn,
where n = 1, 2, . . . For these values of λ, equation (M12.5.1.5) has nontrivial solutions,
ϕn(x) = σ12(λn)eϕ1(x, λn) – σ11(λn)eϕ2(x, λn),
(M12.5.1.11)
which are called eigenfunctions (these functions are deﬁned up to a constant multiplier).
To facilitate the further analysis, we represent equation (M12.5.1.5) in the form

The eigenvalue problem for equation (M12.5.1.12) subject to the boundary conditions
(M12.5.1.7) is known to possess the following properties:
1. All eigenvalues λ1, λ2, . . . are real, and λn →∞as n →∞; consequently, the
number of negative eigenvalues is ﬁnite. Each eigenvalue is of multiplicity 1.

there are no negative eigenvalues. If q ≡0 and k1 = k2 = 0, the least eigenvalue is λ1 = 0

provided that conditions (M12.5.1.15) are satisﬁed; the ﬁrst inequality in (M12.5.1.15) is
satisﬁed if c(x) ≤0.

of equation (M12.5.1.1) satisfying the boundary conditions (M12.5.1.2). By the principle of
linear superposition, series (M12.5.1.17) is also a solution of the original partial differential

ψn(t) = exp(–λnt).
(M12.5.1.21)
The functions ϕn(x) are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem (M12.5.1.5), (M12.5.1.7) with a(x) = 1,

(M12.5.1.23)
If the function f0(x) is twice continuously differentiable and the compatibility conditions (see below)
are satisﬁed, then series (M12.5.1.23) is convergent and admits termwise differentiation, once with respect
to t and twice with respect to x. In this case, formula (M12.5.1.23) gives the classical smooth solution of
problem (M12.5.1.19, (M12.5.1.20), (M12.5.1.3). [If f0(x) is not as smooth as indicated or if the compatibility
conditions are not met, then series (M12.5.1.23) may converge to a discontinuous function, thus giving only a
generalized solution.]
◮Conditions of compatibility of initial and boundary conditions. Suppose the func-
tion w has a continuous derivative with respect to t and two continuous derivatives with
respect to x and is a solution of problem (M12.5.1.1)–(M12.5.1.3). Then the boundary
conditions (M12.5.1.2) and the initial condition (M12.5.1.3) must be consistent; namely,
the following compatibility conditions must hold:
[s1f ′
0 + k1f0]x=x1 = 0,
[s2f ′
0 + k2f0]x=x2 = 0.
(M12.5.1.24)

[a(x)f ′′

must also hold; the primes denote the derivatives with respect to x.

(M12.5.2.3)
We assume that the coefﬁcients of equation (M12.5.2.1) and boundary conditions
(M12.5.1.2) meet the following requirements:
α(t), β(t), γ(t), a(x), b(x), and c(x) are continuous functions,
α(t) > 0,
a(x) > 0,
|s1| + |k1| > 0,
|s2| + |k2| > 0.
Let us use the method of separation of variables to solve boundary value problems
for homogeneous linear equations of the hyperbolic type (M12.5.2.1) with homogeneous
boundary conditions (M12.5.1.2) and nonhomogeneous initial conditions (M12.5.2.2) and
(M12.5.2.3).
The approach is based on searching for particular solutions of equation (M12.5.2.1) in
the product form (M12.5.1.4). After separating the variables and rearranging (in much the

course of solving the problem. The functions ϕn(x) and the numbers λn are determined by
solving the eigenvalue problem (M12.5.2.4), (M12.5.1.7). The functions ψn1(t) and ψn2(t)
are particular solutions of the linear equation (M12.5.2.5) for ψ (with λ = λn) that satisfy
the conditions

Taking advantage of the principle of linear superposition, we seek the solution to the

different arguments (M12.5.3.3), determined by equations (M12.5.1.5) and (M12.5.3.4).
The solution to each of the auxiliary problems is sought in the series form (M12.5.3.6).
M12.6. Integral Transforms Method
Various integral transforms are widely used to solve linear problems of mathematical

where the integration path is parallel to the imaginary axis and lies to the right of all
singularities of ef(p).
In order to solve nonstationary boundary value problems, the following Laplace trans-
form formulas for derivatives will be required:

where f(0) and f ′(0) are the initial values.
More details ontheproperties of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform
can be found in Section M10.2. The Laplace transforms of some functions are listed in
Section S2.1. Tables of inverse Laplace transforms are listed in Section S2.2. Such tables
are convenient to use when solving linear problems for partial differential equations.

shows schematically how one can utilize the Laplace transforms to solve boundary value
problems for linear parabolic or hyperbolic equations with two independent variables in the
case where the equation coefﬁcients are independent of t (the same procedure can be applied
to solving linear problems characterized by higher-order equations). Here and henceforth,
the short notation ew(x, p) = L{w(x, t)} will be used; the arguments of ew may be omitted.

(n = 1, 2). On solving problem
(M12.6.1.6), (M12.6.1.7), one should apply to the resulting solution ew = ew(x, p) the inverse
Laplace transform (M12.6.1.2) to obtain the solution, w = w(x, t), of the original problem.
Example. Consider the ﬁrst boundary value problem for the heat equation:
∂w
∂t = ∂2w
∂x2
(x > 0, t > 0),
w = 0
at
t = 0
(initial condition),
w = w0
at
x = 0
(boundary condition),
w →0
at
x →∞
(boundary condition).
We apply the Laplace transform with respect to t. Let us multiply the equation, the initial condition, and
the boundary conditions by e–pt and then integrate with respect to t from zero to inﬁnity. Taking into account
the relations
L{∂tw} = pew – w|t=0 = pew
(used are ﬁrst property (M12.6.1.3) and the initial condition),
L{w0} = w0L{1} = w0/p
(used are the ﬁrst property of Subsection S2.1.1 and the relation L{1} = 1/p),
we arrive at the following problem for a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with parameter p:
ew′′
xx – pew = 0,
ew = w0/p
at
x = 0
(boundary condition),
ew →0
at
x →∞
(boundary condition).
Integrating the equation yields the general solution ew = A1(p)e–x√p + A2(p)ex√p.
Using the boundary
conditions, we determine the constants, A1(p) = w0/p and A2(p) = 0. Thus, we have
ew = w0

where the integral is understood in the sense of the Cauchy principal value.
The main properties of the correspondence between functions and their Fourier trans-
forms are gathered in Table M10.4.
◮Solving linear problems of mathematical physics by the Fourier transform. The
Fourier transform is usually employed to solve problems for linear partial differential
equations whose coefﬁcients are independent of the space variable x, –∞< x < ∞.
The scheme for solving linear boundary value problems with the help of the Fourier
transform is similar to that used in solving problems with the help of the Laplace transform.
With the Fourier transform, the derivatives with respect to x in the equation are replaced
by appropriate algebraic expressions; see Property 4 or 5 in Table M10.4. In the case of
two independent variables, the problem for a partial differential equation is reduced to a
simpler problem for an ordinary differential equation with parameter u. On solving the
latter problem, one determines the transform. After that, by applying the inverse Fourier
transform, one obtains the solution of the original boundary value problem.
Example. Consider the following Cauchy problem for the heat equation:
∂w
∂t = ∂2w
∂x2
(–∞< x < ∞),
w = f(x)
at
t = 0
(initial condition).
We apply the Fourier transform with respect to the space variable x. Setting ew = F{w(x, t)} and taking into
account the relation F{∂xxw} = –u2 ew (see Property 4 in Table M10.4), we arrive at the following problem for
a linear ﬁrst-order ordinary differential equation in t with parameter u:
ew′
t + u2ew = 0,
ew = ef(u)
at
t = 0,
where ef(u) is deﬁned by (M12.6.2.1). On solving this problem for the transform ew, we ﬁnd
ew = ef(u)e–u2t.
Let us apply the inversion formula to both sides of this equation. After some calculations, we obtain the solution

The quantities y and τ appear in problem (M12.7.1.7)–(M12.7.1.10) as free parameters,
with x1 ≤y ≤x2, and δ(x) is the Dirac delta function.

The functions Λ1(x, t, τ) and Λ2(x, t, τ) involved in the integrands of the last two terms
in solution (M12.7.1.6) can be expressed in terms of the Green’s function G(x, y, t, τ). The
corresponding formulas for Λm(x, t, τ) are given in Table M12.4 for the basic types of
boundary value problems.
It is signiﬁcant that the Green’s function G and the functions Λ1, Λ2 are independent of
the functions Φ, f, g1, and g2 that characterize various nonhomogeneities of the boundary
value problem.
If the coefﬁcients of equation (M12.7.1.1)–(M12.7.1.2) are independent of time t, i.e.,
the conditions
a = a(x),
b = b(x),
c = c(x)
(M12.7.1.11)
hold, then the Green’s function depends on only three arguments,
G(x, y, t, τ) = G(x, y, t – τ).
(M12.7.1.12)
In this case, the functions Λm depend on only two arguments, Λm = Λm(x, t – τ), m = 1, 2.
Formula (M12.7.1.6) also remains valid for the problem with boundary conditions of
the third kind if k1 = k1(t) and k2 = k2(t). Here, the relations between Λm (m = 1, 2) and the
Green’s function G are the same as in the case of constant k1 and k2; the Green’s function
itself is now different.

parameters (x1 ≤y ≤x2), and δ(x) is the Dirac delta function.
The functions Λ1(x, t, τ) and Λ2(x, t, τ) involved in the integrands of the last two terms
in solution (M12.8.1.3) can be expressed in terms of the Green’s function G(x, y, t, τ). The
corresponding formulas for Λm(x, t, τ) are given in Table M12.4 for the basic types of
boundary value problems.
It is signiﬁcant that the Green’s function G and Λ1, Λ2 are independent of the functions
Φ, f0, f1, g1, and g2 that characterize various nonhomogeneities of the boundary value
problem.
If the coefﬁcients of equation (M12.8.1.1) are independent of time t, then the Green’s
function depends on only three arguments, G(x, y, t, τ) = G(x, y, t – τ). In this case, one
can set

Remark. The corresponding formulas for Λm(x, t) for the basic types of boundary value problems can

◮Properties of the Sturm–Liouville problem. The Klein–Gordon equation. The gen-
eral and special properties of the Sturm–Liouville problem (M12.8.2.4) are given in Subsec-
tions M12.5.1 and M11.2.5; various asymptotic and approximate formulas for eigenvalues
and eigenfunctions can also be found there.
Example. Consider the second boundary value problem in the domain 0 ≤x ≤l for the Klein–Gordon

The Klein–Gordon equation is a special case of equation (M12.8.2.1) with ρ(x) = 1, p(x) = a2, q(x) = b,

Λ1(x, t) = –G(x, x1, t),
Λ2(x, t) = G(x, x2, t)
(see the second row in Table M12.4 and the above remark), one obtains the solution to the problem in question.

M12.8.3. Goursat Problem (a Problem with Initial Data of
Characteristics)
◮Statement of the Goursat problem. Basic property of the solution. Consider the
general linear hyperbolic equation in two independent variables which is reduced to the ﬁrst
canonical form (see Subsection M12.2.1):
∂2w
∂x∂y + a(x, y) ∂w
∂x + b(x, y) ∂w
∂y + c(x, y)w = f(x, y),
(M12.8.3.1)
where a(x, y), b(x, y), c(x, y), and f(x, y) are continuous functions.
The Goursat problem for equation (M12.8.3.1) is stated as follows: ﬁnd a solution to
equation (M12.8.3.1) that satisﬁes the conditions at characteristics
w(x, y)|x=x1 = g(y),
w(x, y)|y=y1 = h(x),
(M12.8.3.2)
where g(y) and h(x) are given continuous functions that match each other at the point of
intersection of the characteristics, so that
g(y1) = h(x1).
Basic properties of the Goursat problem: the value of the solution at any point M(x0, y0)
depends only on the values of g(y) at the segment AN (which is part of the characteristic
x = x1), the values of h(x) at the segment BN (which is part of the characteristic y = y1),
and the values of the functions a(x, y), b(x, y), c(x, y), and f(x, y) in the rectangle NAMB;
see Fig. M12.2. The domain of inﬂuence on the solution at the point M(x0, y0) is shaded

THEOREM. If the functions a, b, c and the partial derivatives ax, by are all continuous,
then the Riemann function R(x, y; x0, y0) exists. Moreover, the function R(x0, y0, x, y),
obtained by swapping the parameters and the arguments, is a solution to the homogeneous
equation (M12.8.3.1), with f = 0.
Remark. It is signiﬁcant that the Riemann function is independent of the initial data on characteris-
tics (M12.8.3.2).
Example 1. The Riemann function for the equation wxy = 0 is just R ≡1.
Example 2. The Riemann function for the equation
wxy + cw = 0
(c = const)
is expressed in terms of the Bessel function J0(z) as
R = J0

◮Solution representation for the Goursat problem in terms of the Riemann function.
Given a Riemann function, the solution to the Goursat problem (M12.8.3.1), (M12.8.3.2)
at any point (x0, y0) can be written as

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is evaluated at the point of intersection of the charac-
teristics (x1, y1). The second and third terms are integrals along the characteristics y = y1
(x1 ≤x ≤x0) and x = x1 (y1 ≤y ≤y0); these involve the initial data of (M12.8.3.2).
The last integral is taken over the rectangular domain NAMB deﬁned by the inequalities
x1 ≤x ≤x0, y1 ≤y ≤y0.
The Goursat problem for a hyperbolic equation reduced to the second canonical form
(see Subsection M12.2.1) is treated similarly.
Example 3. Consider the Goursat problem for the wave equation
∂2w
∂t2 – a2 ∂2w
∂x2 = 0
with the boundary conditions prescribed on its characteristics
w = f(x)
for
x – at = 0
(0 ≤x ≤b),
w = g(x)
for
x + at = 0
(0 ≤x ≤c),
(M12.8.3.5)
where f(0) = g(0).
Substituting the values set on the characteristics (M12.8.3.5) into the general solution of the wave equation,
w = ϕ(x – at) + ψ(x + at), we arrive to a system of linear algebraic equations for ϕ(x) and ψ(x). As a result,
the solution to the Goursat problem is obtained in the form
w(x, t) = f

The propagation domain of the solution is the parallelogram bounded by the four straight lines

(M12.10.1.8)
The vector y = {y1, . . . , yn} appears in problem (M12.10.1.6)–(M12.10.1.8) as an n-
dimensional free parameter (y ∈V ), and δ(x – y) = δ(x1 – y1) . . . δ(xn – yn) is the n-
dimensional Dirac delta function.
The Green’s function G is independent of the func-
tions Φ, f, and g that characterize various nonhomogeneities of the boundary value prob-
lem. In (M12.10.1.5), the integration is performed everywhere with respect to y, with
dVy = dy1 . . . dyn.
The function H(x, y, t, τ) in the integrand of the last term in solution (M12.10.1.5)
can be expressed via the Green’s function G(x, y, t, τ). The corresponding formulas for
H(x, y, t, τ) are given in Table M12.8 for the three basic types of boundary value problems;
in the third boundary value problem, the coefﬁcient k can depend on x and t. The boundary
conditions of the second and third kinds, as well as the solution of the ﬁrst boundary value
problem, involve operators of differentiation along the conormal of operator (M12.10.1.2);
these operators act as follows:

where aii(x, t) = 1 and aij(x, t) = 0 for i ≠j, operator (M12.10.1.9) coincides with the
ordinary operator of differentiation along the outward normal to S.

If the coefﬁcient of equation (M12.10.1.6) and the boundary condition (M12.10.1.8) are
independent of t, then the Green’s function depends on only three arguments, G(x, y, t, τ) =
G(x, y, t – τ).
Remark. Let Si (i = 1, . . . , p) be different portions of the surface S such that S =

and the homogeneous boundary condition (M12.10.1.8).
If the coefﬁcients of equation (M12.10.2.5) and the boundary condition (M12.10.1.8)
are independent of time t, then the Green’s function depends on only three arguments,
G(x, y, t, τ) = G(x, y, t – τ). In this case, one can set

assume that the equation is subject to the general linear boundary condition
Γx[w] = g(x)
for
x ∈S.
(M12.10.3.3)
The solution of the stationary problem (M12.10.3.1)–(M12.10.3.3) can be obtained by
passing in (M12.10.1.5) to the limit as t →∞. To this end, one should start with equa-
tion (M12.10.1.1), whose coefﬁcients are independent of t, and take the homogeneous initial
condition (M12.10.1.3), with f(x) = 0, and the stationary boundary condition (M12.10.3.3).
◮Representation of the problem solution in terms of the Green’s function. The solu-
tion of the linear boundary value problem (M12.10.3.1)–(M12.10.3.3) can be represented

(M12.10.3.4)
Here, the Green’s function G(x, y) satisﬁes the nonhomogeneous equation of special form
–Lx[G] = δ(x – y)
(M12.10.3.5)
with the homogeneous boundary condition
Γx[G] = 0
for
x ∈S.
(M12.10.3.6)
The vector y = {y1, . . . , yn} appears in problem (M12.10.3.5), (M12.10.3.6) as an n-
dimensional free parameter (y ∈V ). Note that G is independent of the functions Φ and g
characterizing various nonhomogeneities of the original boundary value problem.
The function H(x, y) in the integrand of the second term in solution (M12.10.3.4) can be
expressed via the Green’s function G(x, y). The corresponding formulas for H for the three
basic types of boundary value problems can be obtained using Table M12.8, where one
should consider the functions to be independent of t and τ. The boundary conditions of the
second and third kinds, as well as the solution of the ﬁrst boundary value problem, involve
operators of differentiation along the conormal of operator (M12.10.3.2); these operators
are deﬁned by (M12.10.1.9); in this case, the coefﬁcients aij depend on x only.

that can deﬁne a boundary condition of the ﬁrst, second, or third kind; the coefﬁcients of
the operators Lx and Γx can depend on the space variables but are independent of time t.
The coefﬁcients λk and the functions uk(x) are determined by solving the homogeneous
eigenvalue problem
Lx[u] + λu = 0,
(M12.11.1.1)
Γx[u] = 0
for
x ∈S.
(M12.11.1.2)
It is apparent from Table M12.9 that, given the Green’s function in the problem for a
parabolic (or hyperbolic) equation, one can easily construct the Green’s functions of the
corresponding problems for elliptic and hyperbolic (or parabolic) equations. In particular,
the Green’s function of the problem for an elliptic equation can be expressed via the Green’s
function of the problem for a parabolic equation as follows:
G0(x, y) =
Z ∞
0
G1(x, y, t) dt.
(M12.11.1.3)
It is assumed here that λ = 0 is not an eigenvalue of problem (M12.11.1.1), (M12.11.1.2).
Remark 1. Formula (M12.11.1.3) can also be used if the domain V is inﬁnite. In this case, one should
make sure that the integral on the right-hand side is convergent.
Remark 2. Suppose the equations given in the ﬁrst column of Table M12.9 contain –Lx[w] – βw instead
of –Lx[w], with β being a free parameter. Then the λk in the expressions of the Green’s function in the third
column of Table M12.9 must be replaced by λk – β; just as previously, the λk and uk(x) were determined by
solving the eigenvalue problem (M12.11.1.1), (M12.11.1.2).

following simpler stationary boundary condition at x = x1:

(M12.11.1.6)
Remark. A similar formula also holds for the homogeneous boundary condition at x = x1 and a nonho-

Chapter M14
Probability Theory
M14.1. Basic Concepts and Simplest Probabilistic
Models
M14.1.1. Rules and Formulas of Combinatorics
Below are rules and formulas of combinatorics that are useful in solving problems of
probability theory.
◮Rule of sum and rule of product.
Rule of sum. Suppose there is a collection of objects (of arbitrary nature). If an object α
can be chosen from this collection in m different ways and another object β can be chosen
in k ways, then one can choose either object α or object β in m + k different ways.
Rule of product. If an object α can be chosen in m ways and after that an object β can
be chosen in k ways, then one can choose the ordered pair of objects (α, β) in mk ways.
Example 1. How many two-digit numbers are there consisting of different digits?
The ﬁrst digit can be one of 1, 2, . . . , 9 and the other, one of the eight remaining plus 0 (i.e., one of nine
digits). So, by the rule of product, there are 9 × 9 = 81 two-digit numbers consisting of different digits.
◮Permutations and combinations.
Given a set of n (distinct) elements, an arrangement of r elements from this set (r ≤n)
taken in a certain order is called a permutation. The total number of different permutations
is equal to
P r
n = n(n – 1)(n – 2) . . . (n – r + 1) =
n!
(n – r)! ,
which is also denoted P n
r = nPr = P(n, r).
Example 2. How many three-digit numbers can be made up from the six digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without
repetitions?
Three out of the six digits (in a certain order) can be selected in P 3
6 ways. The triplets that start with 0 (i.e.,
the number of two-digit numbers consisting of 1, . . . , 5) must be subtracted from this. So the desired number
of three-digit numbers is P 3
6 – P 2
5 = 6 ⋅5 ⋅4 – 5 ⋅4 = 100.
Note that the number of different permutations on a set of n elements (i.e., arrangements
that differ from each other by only the order of selection of the n elements) is equal to
P n
n = n! = 1 ⋅2 ⋅3 . . . n.
Note that 0! = 1.
Example 3. How many ways can four people be seated at a table?
This can be done in P 4
4 = 4! = 1 ⋅2 ⋅3 ⋅4 = 24 ways.
An arrangement of r elements selected from a set of n elements where the order is not
important is called a combination. The number of combinations is equal to
Cr
n = P r
n
P rr
= n(n – 1)(n – 2) . . . (n – r + 1)
r!
=
n!
r! (n – r)!
and is also denoted Cn
r = nCr = C(n, r) =
 n
r

. Note that the relation Cr
n = Cn–r
n
holds.

PROBABILITY THEORY
Example 4. How many ways can three balls be selected from a box containing six numbered balls?
The desired number equals the number of combinations of three elements from a set of six elements, or
C3
6 = 6 ⋅5 ⋅4
3 ⋅2 ⋅1 = 20.
M14.1.2. Probabilities of Random Events
◮Random events. Basic deﬁnitions. The simplest mutually exclusive outcomes of an
experiment are called elementary events ωi. The set of all elementary outcomes, which we
denote by the symbol Ω, is called the space of elementary events (or the sample space).
Any subset of Ωis called a random event A (or simply an event A). Event A is said to
occur when the outcome of the experiment is one of the elementary events that make up A.
Example 1. Suppose the experiment is rolling a six-sided die once. There are six possible mutually
exclusive outcomes and the space of elementary events is Ω= {ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4, ω5, ω6}, where elementary
event ωk stands for rolling a k on the die. If event A is rolling an odd number on the die, then A occurs when
the outcome is one of the elementary events ω1, ω3, ω5.
An event A implies an event B (A ⊆B) if B occurs when A occurs. Events A and B
are said to be equivalent (A = B) if A implies B and B implies A, i.e., if both events A and
B occur or do not occur simultaneously.
The union C = A ∪B = A + B of events A and B is the event that at least one of the
events A or B occurs. The elementary outcomes of the union A + B are the elementary
outcomes that belong to at least one of the events A and B.
The intersection C = A ∩B = AB of events A and B is the event that both A and B
occur. The elementary outcomes of the intersection AB are the elementary outcomes that
simultaneously belong to A and B.
The difference C = A\B = A–B of events A and B is the event that A occurs and B does
not occur. The elementary outcomes of the difference A\B are the elementary outcomes
of A that do not belong to B.
The event that A does not occur is called the complement of A, or the complementary
event, and is denoted by A. The elementary outcomes of A are the elementary outcomes
that do not belong to event A.
The set Ωis called a sure event or a certain event (it will always happen). The empty
set ∅is called an impossible event (it will never happen).
Two complementary events A and A are said to be opposite; they simultaneously satisfy
the following two conditions:
A ∪A = Ω,
A ∩A = ∅.
Events A and B are said to be incompatible, or mutually exclusive, if their simultaneous
realization is impossible, i.e., if A ∩B = ∅.
Events H1, . . . , Hn are said to form a complete group of events, or to be collectively
exhaustive, if at least one of them necessarily occurs for each trial of the experiment, i.e., if
H1 ∪· · · ∪Hn = Ω.
Events H1, . . . , Hn form a complete group of mutually exclusive or pairwise incompat-
ible events if exactly one of the events necessarily occurs for each trial of the experiment,
i.e., if
H1 ∪· · · ∪Hn = Ω
and
Hi ∩Hj = ∅
(i ≠j).
Main properties of random events:
1. A ∪B = B ∪A and A ∩B = B ∩A (commutativity).

M14.1. BASIC CONCEPTS AND SIMPLEST PROBABILISTIC MODELS
381
2. (A∪B)∩C = (A∩C)∪(B ∩C) and (A∩B)∪C = (A∪C)∩(B ∪C) (distributivity).
3. (A ∪B) ∪C = A ∪(B ∪C) and (A ∩B) ∩C = A ∩(B ∩C) (associativity).
4. A ∪A = A and A ∩A = A.
5. A ∪Ω= Ωand A ∩Ω= A.
6. A ∪A = Ωand A ∩A = ∅.
7. ∅= Ω, Ω= ∅, and A = A.
8. A \ B = A ∩B.
9. A ∪B = A ∩B and A ∩B = A ∪B (de Morgan’s laws).
◮Discrete probability space. Classical deﬁnition of probability. Suppose that Ω=
{ω1, . . . , ωn} is a ﬁnite sample space. To each elementary event ωi ∈Ω(i = 1, 2, . . . , n)
there corresponds a number p(ωi), called the probability of the elementary event ωi. Thus
a real function satisfying the following two conditions is deﬁned on the set Ω:
1. Nonnegativity condition: p(ωi) ≥0 for any ωi ∈Ω.
2. Normalization condition:
nP
i=1
p(ωi) = 1.
The probability P(A) of an event A for any subset A ⊂Ωis deﬁned to be the sum of
the probabilities of the elementary events that form A; i.e.,
P(A) =
X
ωi∈A
p(ωi).
(M14.1.2.1)
Note that the relations 0 ≤P(A) ≤1, P(∅) = 0, and P(Ω) = 1 are always valid.
A special case of the deﬁnition of probability (M14.1.2.1) is the classical deﬁnition of
probability, in which all elementary events are equally likely: p(ω1) = · · · = p(ωn) = 1/n.
Then the probability of the event A is
P(A) = m
n ,
(M14.1.2.2)
where m is the number of elementary events making up A (the number favorable outcomes).
Example 2. In example 1, the probability of rolling an odd number is
P(A) = 3
6 = 1
2 .
Example 3. Let two dice be rolled. Under the assumption that the elementary events are equiprobable,
ﬁnd the probability of the event A that the sum of the numbers rolled is greater than 10. Obviously, the sample
space can be represented as Ω= {(i, j) : i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, where i is the number shown by the ﬁrst die and j is
that shown by the second die. The total number of elementary events is |Ω| = 36. Event A is represented by the
subset A = {(5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6)} of Ω. Since |A| = 3, formula (M14.1.2.2) gives P(A) = |A|/|Ω| = 3/36 = 1/12.
◮Statistical deﬁnition of probability. Suppose an experiment has been repeated N times
and an event A has occurred k times. The ratio k/N is called the relative frequency of the
event A in the given series of experiments. The number about which the relative frequency
oscillates in long series of experiments is called the probability P(A) of the event A.
◮Geometric deﬁnition of probability. In the geometric approach to deﬁning probability,
one takes an arbitrary set on a straight line, in a plane, or in space to be the sample space Ω.
A trial of an experiment is interpreted as a random selection of a point in Ω. The occurrence
of an event A is treated as the occurrence of the point in a subdomain A of Ω. It is assumed
that the probability of selecting a point in the domain A is proportional to the measure of A
(i.e., to its length, area, or volume) and is independent of the position and shape of the
domain. The probability of the event A is deﬁned as
P(A) = measure A
measure Ω.

Example 3. A point is randomly dropped inside a circle of radius R = 1. Find the probability of the event
that the point lands in the circle of radius r = 1
2 concentric with the larger one.
Let A be the event that the point lands in the smaller circle. We ﬁnd the probability P(A) as the ratio of
the area of the smaller circle to that of the larger one:
P(A) = πr2
πR2 = 1
4 .
◮Axiomatic deﬁnition of probability. The probability of an event is deﬁned to be a
single-valued real function P(A) satisfying the following three axioms:
1. Nonnegativity: P(A) ≥0 for any A ∈Ω.
2. Normalization: P(Ω) = 1.
3. Additivity: P

Properties of probability:
1. The probability of an impossible event is zero; i.e., P(∅) = 0.
2. The probability of the event A opposite to an event A is equal to P(A) = 1 – P(A).
3. Probability is a bounded function; i.e., 0 ≤P(A) ≤1.
4. If an event A implies an event B (A ⊆B), then P(A) ≤P(B).
5. If events A1, . . . , An form a complete group of pairwise incompatible events, then

P(Ai) = 1.
M14.1.3. Conditional Probability. Total Probability Formula
◮Probability of the union of events. The probability of realization of at least one of two
events H1 and H2 is given by the formula (addition theorem)
P(H1 ∪H2) = P(H1) + P(H2) – P(H1 ∩H2).
In particular, for H1 ∩H2 = ∅, we have
P(H1 ∪H2) = P(H1) + P(H2).
The probability of realization of at least one of n events is given by the formula
P(H1 ∪· · · ∪Hn) =

(M14.1.3.1)
Note that P(H1 ∪H2) is also written P(H1 + H2).
For n pairwise incompatible events H1, H2, . . . , Hn (Hi ∩Hj = ∅for i ≠j), formula
(M14.1.3.1) simpliﬁes to become
P(H1 ∪· · · ∪Hn) = P(H1) + P(H2) + · · · + P(Hn).
It may often be convenient to calculate the probability of the sum of events via the
probability of the product of opposite events:
P(H1 ∪· · · ∪Hn) = 1 – P( ¯
H1 ∩¯
H2 ∩· · · ∩¯
Hn).

◮Conditional probability. The conditional probability P(A|H) of an event A given the
occurrence of some other event H is deﬁned by the formula
P(A|H) = P(A ∩H)
P(H)
,
P(H) > 0.
(M14.1.3.2)
Relation (M14.1.3.2) can be rewritten (multiplication theorem)
P(A ∩H) = P(H) P(A|H).
(M14.1.3.3)
The probability P(A ∩H) is also written P(AH).
The formula
P(A1 ∩· · · ∩An) = P(A1) P(A2|A1) P(A3|A1 ∩A2) . . . P(An|A1 ∩· · · ∩An–1)
is a generalization of (M14.1.3.3).
Example 1. Two guns shoot one and the same target independently, once each. The probability for the
ﬁrst gun to hit the target is 0.8 and that for the second gun is 0.9. It is required to ﬁnd:
a) the probability that the target is hit only once and
b) the probability that the target is hit at least once.
a) Let A and B denote the events that the ﬁrst and second guns hit the target, respectively. Then the
probability that the target is hit only once is P(A ¯B + ¯AB) = P(A ¯B) + P( ¯AB) = P(A)P( ¯B) + P( ¯A)P(B) =
0.8 (1 – 0.9) + (1 – 0.8) 0.9 = 0.26.
b) The probability of at least one hit is P(A+B) = P(A)+P(B)–P(A)P(B) = 0.8+0.9–0.8⋅0.9 = 0.98.
Note that this result is usually obtained as follows: P(A+B)=1–P( ¯A ¯B)=1–P( ¯A)P( ¯B)=1–0.2⋅0.1=0.98.
◮Independence of events. Two random events A and B are said to be independent if the
conditional probability of A, given the occurrence of B, coincides with the unconditional
probability of A,
P(A|B) = P(A).
In this case, P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B).
Random events A1, . . . , An are jointly independent if the relation

holds whenever 1 ≤i1 < · · · < im ≤n and m ≤n.
The pairwise independence of the events Ai and Aj for all i ≠j (i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n) does
not imply that the events A1, . . . , An are jointly independent.
Example 2. Suppose that the experiment is to draw one of four balls. Let three of them be labeled by the
numbers 1, 2, and 3, and let the fourth ball bear all these numbers. By Ai (i = 1, 2, 3) we denote the event that
the chosen ball bears the number i. Are the events A1, A2, and A3 dependent?
Since each number is encountered twice, P(A1) = P(A2) = P(A3) = 1/2. Since any two distinct numbers
are present only on one of the balls, we have P(A1A2) = P(A2A3) = P(A1A3) = 1/4, and hence the events
A1, A2, and A3 are pairwise independent. All three distinct numbers are present only on one of the balls, and
P(A1A2A3) = 1/4 ≠P(A1) P(A2) P(A3) = 1/8.
Thus we see that the events A1, A2, and A3 are jointly dependent, even though they are pairwise independent.
◮Total probability formula. Bayes’s formula. Suppose that a group of pairwise incom-
patible events H1, . . . , Hn is given and their probabilities P(H1), . . . , P(Hn) as well as
the conditional probabilities P(A|H1), . . . , P(A|Hn) of an event A are known. Then the
probability of A can be determined by the total probability formula

Example 3. There are two urns: the ﬁrst urn contains a white balls and b black ones, and the second urn
contains c white balls and d black ones. We take one ball from the ﬁrst urn and put it into the second urn. After
this, we draw one ball from the second urn. Find the probability of the event that this ball is white.
Let A be the event of drawing a white ball. Consider the following group of events:
H1, a white ball is taken from the ﬁrst urn and put into the second urn.
H2, a black ball is taken from the ﬁrst urn and put into the second urn. Obviously,
P(H1) =

P(A|H1) =

If it is known that the event A has occurred as a result of one trial but it is unknown
which of the events H1, . . . , Hn has occurred, then the conditional probabilities of the
hypotheses Hk (under the condition that the event A has occurred) are calculated using
Bayes’s formula:
P(Hk|A) = P(Hk) P(A|Hk)
P(A)
(k = 1, 2, . . . , n).
Example 4. A box contains same parts made by two automats, 40% produced by the ﬁrst automat and the
rest by the second. It is known that 3% of the ﬁrst automat’s products are faulty, while the percentage of faulty
products made by the second automat is 2%. Find
a) the probability that a randomly chosen part will be faulty and
b) the probability that a randomly chosen part was made by the ﬁrst automat if found faulty.
Let A denote the event that a randomly chosen part is faulty and let H1 and H2 denote the events that a
part is made by the ﬁrst and second automat, respectively. Then
a) the total probability formula gives
P(A) = P(H1) P(A|H1) + P(H2) P(A|H2) = 0.4 ⋅0.03 + (1 – 0.4) ⋅0.02 = 0.024;
b) Bayes’s formula gives
P(H1|A) = P(H1) P(A|H1)
P(A)

M14.1.4. Sequence of Trials
◮Bernoulli process. In this case, some event A occurs with probability p = P(A) (the
probability of “success”) and does not occur with probability q = P(A) = 1 – P(A) = 1 – p
(the probability of “failure”) in each trial. The probability that in n independent trials, the
event A (“success”) occurs exactly k times is determined by the Bernoulli formula (binomial
distribution):

Example 2 (Banach’s problem).
A smoker mathematician has two matchboxes on him, each of which
initially contains exactly n matches. Each time he needs to light a cigarette, he selects a matchbox at random.
Find the probability of the event that as the mathematician takes out an empty box for the ﬁrst time, precisely k
matches will be left in the other box (k ≤n).
The mathematician has taken matches 2n – k times, n out of them from the box that is eventually empty.
This scheme corresponds to the scheme of 2n – k independent Bernoulli trials with n “successes.”
The
probability of a “success” in a single trial is equal to 0.5. The desired probability can be found by the formula

◮Limit formulas for Bernoulli process. It is very difﬁcult to use Bernoulli’s formula

In this case, one has to use approximate formulas for
calculating Pn(k) with desired accuracy.
Poisson formula. If the number of independent trials increases unboundedly (n →∞)

M14.2. Random Variables and Their Characteristics
M14.2.1. One-Dimensional Random Variables
◮Notion of a random variable. The distribution function of a random variable. Let
Ω= {ω} be the space of elementary events. A random variable X is a real number function
X = X(ω) deﬁned on the set Ω.
Any rule (table, function, graph, or otherwise) that permits one to ﬁnd the probabilities
of events is usually called the distribution law of a random variable. In general, random
variables can be discrete or continuous.
The cumulative distribution function of a random variable X is the function F(x) whose
value at every point x is equal to the probability of the event {X < x}:
F(x) = P(X < x).
Properties of the cumulative distribution function:
1. 0 ≤F(x) ≤1.
2.
lim
x→–∞F(x) = F(–∞) = 0, lim
x→+∞F(x) = F(+∞) = 1.
3. If x2 > x1, then F(x2) ≥F(x1).
4. P(x1 ≤X < x2) = F(x2) – F(x1).
5. F(x) is continuous from the left, i.e.,
lim
x→x0–0 F(x) = F(x0).
◮Discrete random variables. Let X be a discrete random variable assuming the values
x1, x2, . . . , xn, . . . with probabilities p1, p2, . . . , pn, . . . , so its distribution law can be
deﬁned by the table

(Here and in what follows, it is assumed that the values of a discrete random variable X are
arranged in ascending order, so that x1 < x2 < · · · < xk–1 < xk < · · · .)
In this case, the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable X is the
step function deﬁned as the sum
F(x) = P{X < x} =

◮Continuous random variables. The probability density function. A continuous
random variable is deﬁned by either a distribution function F(x) or a probability density
function p(x), which are related by
p(x) = F ′(x),
F(x) =

M14.2. RANDOM VARIABLES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

Sometimes, the distributionfunctionandprobabilitydensityfunctionof a random variableX
are denoted FX(x) and pX(x), respectively, rather than F(x) and p(x).

The differential dF(x) = p(x) dx ≈P(x ≤X ≤x + dx) is called a probability element.
Remark. For continuous random variables, one always has P(X = x0) = 0, but the event {X = x0} is not
necessarily impossible.
◮Functions of random variables. Suppose that a random variable Y is related to a
random variable X by a functional dependence Y = ϕ(X). If X is discrete, then, obviously,
Y is also discrete. To ﬁnd the distribution law of the random variable Y , it sufﬁces to
calculate the values ϕ(xi).
If there are repeated values among yi = ϕ(xi), then these
repeated values are taken into account only once, the corresponding probabilities being
added.
If X is a continuous random variable with probability density function p(x), then, in
general, the random variable Y is also continuous. The cumulative distribution function
of Y is given by the formula
FY (y) = P(Y < y) = P(ϕ(X) < y) =
Z
ϕ(x)<y
p(x) dx.
(M14.2.1.1)
If the function y = ϕ(x) is differentiable and monotone on the entire range of the
argument x, then the probability density function pY (y) of the random variable Y is given
by the formula
pY (y) = p(g(y)) |g′
y(y)|,
where g is the inverse of ϕ(x).

the probability density of the random variable Y = |X| is given by the formula pY (y) = p(x)+ p(–x) (y ≥0). In
particular, if X is symmetric (i.e., the condition P(X < –x) = P(X > x) holds for all x), then pY (y) = 2p(x)
(y ≥0).

The expectation is the main characteristic deﬁning the “position” of a random variable,
i.e., the number near which its possible values are concentrated.
◮Expectation of function of random variable. If a random variable Y is related to
a random variable X by a functional dependence Y = ϕ(X), then the expectation of the
random variable Y = ϕ(X) can be determined by two methods. The ﬁrst method is to
construct the distribution of the random variable Y and then use already known formulas
to ﬁnd E{Y }. The second method is to use the formulas

p(x) = 1/π for x ∈(–π/2, π/2) and p(x) = 0 for |x| > π/2. Then the expectation of the random variable

3. E{XY } = E{X}E{Y } for independent random variables X and Y .
4. |E{X}| ≤E{|X|}.
5. E{X} ≤E{Y } if X(ω) ≤Y (ω), ω ∈Ω.

In particular, µ0 = 1 and µ1 = 0 for any random variable.
The number mk = E{|X – a|k} is called the kth absolute moment of X about a.
The existence of a kth moment αk or µk implies the existence of the moments αm and
µm of all orders m < k; if the integral (or series) for αk or µk diverges, then all integrals
(series) for αm and µm of orders m > k also diverge.

◮Variance. The variance of a random variable, Var{X}, is the measure of the deviation
of a random variable X from its expectation E{X}, determined by the relation
Var{X} = E{(X – E{X})2}.
The variance Var{X} is the second central moment of the random variable X. The
variance can be determined by the formulas

The variance characterizes the spread in values of the random variable X about its
expectation.
Properties of the variance:
1. Var{a} = 0 for any real number a = const.
2. The variance is nonnegative: Var{X} ≥0.
3. Var{X} = E{X2} – (E{X})2.
4. Var{αX + β} = α2Var{X} for any real numbers α and β.
5. Var{X ± Y } = Var{X} + Var{Y } for independent random variables X and Y .
6. If X and Y are independent random variables, then
Var{XY } = Var{X}Var{Y } + Var{X}(E{Y })2 + Var{Y }(E{X})2.

PROBABILITY THEORY
◮Other numerical characteristics of random variables. The standard deviation (root
mean square deviation) of a random variable X is the square root of its variance,
σ =
p
Var{X}.
The standard deviation has the same dimension as the random variable itself.
The coefﬁcient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the expected value,
v =
σ
E{X} .
The asymmetry coefﬁcient, or skewness, is deﬁned by the formula
γ1 =
µ3
(µ2)3/2 .
If γ1 > 0, then the distribution curve is more ﬂattened to the right of the mode Mode{X};
if γ1 < 0, then the distribution curve is more ﬂattened to the left of the mode Mode{X}
(see Fig. M14.1).

One says that for γ2 = 0 the distribution has a normal excess, for γ2 > 0 the distribution has
a positive excess, and for γ2 < 0 the distribution has a negative excess.
Remark. The coefﬁcients γ2
1 and γ2 + 3 or (γ2 + 3)/2 are often used instead of γ1 and γ2.
A mode Mode{X} of a continuous probability distribution is a point of local maximum
of the probability density function p(x). A mode of a discrete probability distribution is a
value preceded and followed by values having probabilities smaller than p(Mode{X}).
Distributions with one, two, or more modes are said to be unimodal, bimodal, or
multimodal, respectively.

eters n and p if

k = 0, 1, . . . , n,
where 0 < p < 1 and n ≥1.

The binomial distribution is a model of random experiments consisting of n independent
identical Bernoulli trials. If X1, . . . , Xn are independent random variables, each of which
can take only two values 1 or 0 with probabilities p and q = 1 – p, respectively, then the
random variable X =
nP
k=1
Xk has the binomial distribution with parameters (n, p).
See also the limit formulas (M14.1.4.2)–(M14.1.4.4) for the Bernoulli process.
◮Geometric distribution.
A random variable X has a geometric distribution with
parameter p (0 < p < 1) if
P(X = k) = p(1 – p)k,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Numerical characteristics for the geometric distribution can be calculated by the formulas

The geometric distribution has a maximum at k = 0 and decreases monotonically with
increasing k.
The geometric distribution describes a random variable X equal to the number of failures
before the ﬁrst success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials with probability p of success in
each trial.
The geometric distribution is the only discrete distribution that is memoryless, i.e.,
satisﬁes the relation
P(X > t + s | X > t) = P(X > s)
for any s > 0 and t > 0. This property permits one to view the geometric distribution as the
discrete analogue of the exponential distribution (see Subsection M14.2.4).

N – 1 np(1 – p).

392
PROBABILITY THEORY
A typical scheme in which the hypergeometric distribution arises is as follows: n ele-
ments are randomly drawn without replacement from a population of N elements containing
exactly Np elements of type I and N(1 – p) elements of type II. The number of elements
of type I in the sample is described by the hypergeometric distribution.
If n ≪N (in practice, n < 0.1N), then

i.e., the hypergeometric distribution tends to the binomial distribution.
◮Poisson distribution. A random variable X has a Poisson distribution with parameter λ
(λ > 0) if
P(X = k) = λk
k! e–λ,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The cumulative distribution function of the Poisson distribution at the points k =

α4 = λ(λ3 + 6λ2 + 7λ + 1),
µ3 = λ,
µ4 = 3λ2 + λ,
γ1 = λ–1/2,
γ2 = λ–1.
The sum of independent random variables X1, . . . , Xn obeying the Poisson distributions
with parameters λ1, . . . , λn, respectively, has the Poisson distribution with parameter
λ1 + · · · + λn.
The Poisson distribution is the limit distribution for many discrete distributions such as
the hypergeometric distribution, the binomial distribution, the negative binomial distribu-
tion, distributions arising in problems of arrangement of particles in cells, etc. The Poisson
distribution is an acceptable model for describing the random number of occurrences of
certain events on a given time interval in a given domain in space.
◮Negative binomial distribution. A random variable X has a negative binomial distri-
bution with parameters r and p if
P(X = k) = Cr–1
r+k–1pr(1 – p)k,
k = 0, 1, . . . , r,
where 0 < p < 1 and r > 0.

The negative binomial distribution describes the number X of failures before the rth
success in a Bernoulli process with probability p of success on each trial. For r = 1, the
negative binomial distribution coincides with the geometric distribution.

M14.2. RANDOM VARIABLES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

A normally distributed random variable takes values close to its expectation with large
probability; this is expressed by the sigma rule
P(|X – m| ≥kσ) = 2[1 – Φ(k)] =



0.3173
for k = 1,
0.0456
for k = 2,
0.0027
for k = 3.
The three-sigma rule is most frequently used.
The fundamental role of the normal distribution is due to the fact that, under mild
assumptions, the distribution of a sum of random variables is asymptotically normal as the
number of terms increases. The corresponding conditions are speciﬁed in the central limit
theorem.
◮Chi-square distribution. A random variable X = χ2(n) has a chi-square distribution
with n degrees of freedom if its probability density function has the form
p(x) =

of squares of independent random variables obeying the standard normal distribution has
the chi-square distribution with n degrees of freedom.
Relationship with other distributions:
1. For n = 1, formula (M14.2.4.2) gives the probability density function of the square X2
of a random variable with the standard normal distribution.
2. For n = 2, formula (M14.2.4.2) gives the exponential distribution with parameter λ = 1

3. As n →∞, the random variable X = χ2(n) has an asymptotically normal distribution

PROBABILITY THEORY
M14.2.5. Two-dimensional and Multivariate Random Variables
◮Distribution of bivariate random variable. Suppose that random variables X1 and X2
are deﬁned in a probability space Ω2; then one says that a two-dimensional random vector
X = (X1, X2) or a system of two random variables is given.
The distribution function F(x1, x2) (also denoted FX1,X2(x1, x2)) of a two-dimensional
random vector (X1, X2), or the joint distribution function of the random variables X1
and X2, is deﬁned as the probability of the simultaneous occurrence (intersection) of the
events (X1 < x1) and (X2 < x2); i.e.,
F(x1, x2) = P(X1 < x1, X2 < x2).
Properties of the joint distribution function of random variables X1 and X2:
1. The function F(x1, x2) is a nondecreasing function of each of the arguments.
2. F(x1, –∞) = F(–∞, x2) = F(–∞, –∞) = 0.
3. F(+∞, +∞) = 1.
4. The probability that the random vector lies in a rectangle with sides parallel to the
coordinate axes is
P(a1 ≤X1 < b1, a2 ≤X2 < b2) = F(b1, b2) – F(b1, a2) – F(a1, b2) + F(a1, a2).
5. The function F(x1, x2) is left-continuous in either argument.
◮Discrete bivariate random variables. A bivariate random variable (X1, X2) is said to
be discrete if each of the random variables X1 and X2 is discrete.
If the random variable X1 takes the values x11, . . . , x1m and the random variable X2
takes the values x21, . . . , x2n, then the random vector (X1, X2) can take only the pairs of
values (x1i, x2j) (i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n). The entries pij = P(X1 = x1i, X2 = x2j) are
the probabilities of the simultaneous occurrence of the events (X1 = x1i) and (X2 = x2j);
PX1,i = pi1 + · · · + pin is the probability that the random variable X1 takes the value x1i;
PX2,j = p1j + · · · + pmj is the probability that the random variable X2 takes the value x2j.
The distribution function of a discrete bivariate random variable can be determined by
the formula
F(x1, x2) =
X
x1i<x1
x2j<x2
pij.
◮Continuous bivariate random variables. A bivariate random variable (X1, X2) is said
to be continuous if its joint distribution function F(x1, x2) can be represented as
F(x1, x2) =
Z x2
–∞
Z x1
–∞
p(y1, y2) dy1 dy2,
(M14.2.5.1)
where the joint probability density function p(x1, x2) is piecewise continuous.
The joint probability density function can be expressed in terms of the joint distribution
function as follows:
p(x1, x2) =
∂2
∂x1∂x2
F(x1, x2).
(M14.2.5.2)
Formulas (M14.2.5.1) and (M14.2.5.2) establish a one-to-one correspondence (up to sets
of probability zero) between the joint probability density functions and the joint distribution
functions of continuous bivariate random variables. The differential p(x1, x2) dx1 dx2 is
called a probability element. Up to higher-order inﬁnitesimals, the probability element is

M14.2. RANDOM VARIABLES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS
397
equal to the probability for the random variable (X1, X2) to lie in the inﬁnitesimal rectangle
(x1, x1 + ∆x1) × (x2, x2 + ∆x2).
Properties of the joint probability density function of random variables X1 and X2:
1. The function p(x1, x2) is nonnegative; i.e., p(x1, x2) ≥0.
2.

4. The probability for a two-dimensional random variable (X1, X2) to lie in a domain
D ⊂R2 is numerically equal to the volume of the curvilinear cylinder with base D
bounded above by the surface of the joint probability density function:
P[(X1, X2) ∈D] =
ZZ
(x1,x2)∈D
pX1,X2(x1, x2) dx1 dx2.
Random variables X1 and X2 are said to be independent if the relation
P(X1 ∈S1, X2 ∈S2) = P(X1 ∈S1) P(X2 ∈S2)
holds for any measurable sets S1 and S2.
THEOREM. Random variables X1 and X2 are independent if and only if
F(x1, x2) = F1(x1) F2(x2),
where F1 and F2 are the cumulative distribution functions of X1 and X2, respectively.
◮Numerical characteristics of bivariate random variables.
The expectation of a
function ϕ(X1, X2) of a bivariate random variable (X1, X2) is deﬁned as the expression
computed by the formula
E{ϕ(X1, X2)} =

in the continuous case,
if these expressions exist in the sense of absolute convergence; otherwise, one says that
E{ϕ(X1, X2)} does not exist.
The moment of order r1 + r2 of a two-dimensional random variable (X1, X2) about a
point (a1, a2) is deﬁned as the expectation E{(X1 – a1)r1(X2 – a2)r2}.
If a1 = a2 = 0, then the moment of order r1 + r2 of a two-dimensional random variable
(X1, X2) is called simply the moment, or the initial moment. The initial moment of order
r1 + r2 is usually denoted by αr1,r2; i.e., αr1,r2 = E{Xr1
1 Xr2
2 }.
The ﬁrst initial moments are the expectations of the random variables X1 and X2; i.e.,
α1,0 = E{X1
1X0
2} = E{X1} and α0,1 = E{X0
1X1
2} = E{X2}. The point (E{X1}, E{X2})
on the OXY -plane characterizes the position of the random point (X1, X2); this position
spreads about the point (E{X1}, E{X2}).
If a1 = E{X1} and a2 = E{X2}, then the moment of order r1 + r2 of the bivariate
random variable (X1, X2) is called the central moment. The central moment of order r1 +r2

398
PROBABILITY THEORY
is usually denoted by µr1,r2; i.e., µr1,r2 = E{(X1 – E{X1})r1(X2 – E{X2})r2}. Obviously,
the ﬁrst central moments are zero.
The second central moments are of special interest and have special names and notation:
λ11 = µ2,0 = Var{X1},
λ22 = µ0,2 = Var{X2},
λ12 = λ21 = µ1,1 = E{(X1 – E{X1})(X2 – E{X2})}.
The ﬁrst two of these moments are the variances of the respective random variables, and
the third one is called the covariance and will be considered below.
◮Covariance and correlation of two random variables. The covariance (correlation
moment, or mixed second moment) Cov(X1, X2) of random variables X1 and X2 is deﬁned
as the central moment of order (1 + 1):
Cov(X1, X2) = α1,1 = E{(X1 – E{X1})(X2 – E{X2})}.
Properties of the covariance:
1. Cov(X1, X2) = Cov(X2, X1).
2. Cov(X, X) = Var{X}.
3. If the random variables X1 and X2 are independent, then Cov(X1, X2) = 0 and if
Cov(X1, X2) ≠0, then the random variables X1 and X2 are dependent.
4. If Y1 = a1X1 + b1 and Y2 = a2X2 + b2, then Cov(Y1, Y2) = a1a2Cov(X1, X2).
5. Cov(X1, X2) = E{X1X2} – E{X1}E{X2}.
6. |Cov(X1, X2)| ≤√Var{X1}Var{X2}. Moreover, Cov(X1, X2) = ±√Var{X1}Var{X2}
if and only if the random variables X1 and X2 are linearly dependent.
7. Var{X1 + X2} = Var{X1} + Var{X2} + 2Cov(X1, X2).
If Cov(X1, X2) = 0, then the random variables X1 and X2 are said to be uncorrelated;
if Cov(X1, X2) ≠0, then they are correlated. Independent random variables are always
uncorrelated, but uncorrelated random variables are not necessarily independent in general.
Example. Suppose that we roll two dice. Let X1 be the number on the ﬁrst die and let X2 be the number
on the second die. We consider the random variables Y1 = X1 + X2 and Y2 = X1 – X2 (the sum and difference
of the points obtained). Then
Cov(Y1, Y2) = E{(X1 + X2 – E{X1 + X2})(X1 – X2 – E{X1 – X2})}
= E{(X1 – E{X1})2 – (X2 – E{X2})2}
= Var{X1} – Var{X2} = 0,
since X1 and X2 are identically distributed and hence Var{X1} = Var{X2}. But Y1 and Y2 are obviously
dependent; for example, if Y1 = 2 then one necessarily has Y2 = 0.
The covariance of random variables X1 and X2 characterizes both their dependence
on each other and their spread around the point (E{X1}, E{X2}). The covariance of X1
and X2 has the dimension equal to the product of dimensions of X1 and X2. Along with
the covariance of X1 and X2, one often uses the coefﬁcient of correlation ρ(X1, X2), which
is a dimensionless normalized quantity. The correlation coefﬁcient of random variables
X1 and X2 is the ratio of the covariance of X1 and X2 to the product of their standard
deviations,
ρ(X1, X2) = Cov(X1, X2)
σ1σ2
.
The correlation coefﬁcient of random variables X1 and X2 indicates the degree of linear
dependence between the variables. If ρ(X1, X2) = 0, then there is no linear relation between
the random variables, but there may well be some other relation between them.

M14.3. LIMIT THEOREMS

Properties of the correlation coefﬁcient:
1. ρ(X1, X2) = ρ(X2, X1).
2. ρ(X, X) = 1.
3. If random variables X1 and X2 are independent, then ρ(X1, X2) = 0. If ρ(X1, X2) ≠0,
then the random variables X1 and X2 are dependent.
4. If Y1 = a1X1 + b1 and Y2 = a2X2 + b2, then ρ(Y1, Y2) = ±ρ(X1, X2).
5. |ρ(X1, X2)| ≤1. Moreover, ρ(X1, X2) = ±1 if and only if the random variables X1 and
X2 are linearly dependent.
The theory of distribution functions of multivariate random variables (random vectors)
can be developed in a similar way.
M14.3. Limit Theorems
M14.3.1. Convergence of Random Variables
◮Convergence in probability. A sequence of random variables X1, X2, . . . is said to
converge in probability to a random variable X(Xn
P
−→X) if
lim
n→∞P(|Xn – X| ≥ε) = 0
for any ε > 0, i.e., if for any ε > 0 and δ > 0 there exists a number N, depending on ε and δ,
such that the inequality
P(|Xn – X| ≥ε) < δ
holds for n > N. A sequence of k-dimensional random variables Xn is said to converge in
probability to a random variable X if each coordinate of the random variable Xn converges
in probability to the respective coordinate of the random variable X.
◮Convergence in the mean. A sequence of random variables X1, X2, . . . with ﬁnite qth
initial moments (E{Xq} < ∞, q = 1, 2, . . . ) is said to converge in the qth mean to a random
variable X if
lim
n→∞E{|Xn – X|q} = 0.
Convergence in the qth mean for q = 2 is called convergence in mean square. If Xn →X
in the qth mean then Xn →X in the q1th mean for all q1 ≤q.
Convergence inthe qth mean implies convergence in probability. The converse statement
is generally not true.
◮Convergence in distribution. Suppose that a sequence F1(x), F2(x), . . . of cumulative
distribution functions converges to a distribution function F(x),
lim
n→∞Fn(x) = F(x),
for every point x. In this case, we say that the sequence X1, X2, . . . of the corresponding
random variables converges to the random variable X in distribution. The random variables
X1, X2, . . . can be deﬁned on different probability spaces.
A sequence F1(x), F2(x), . . . of distribution functions weakly converges to a distribution
function F(x) (Fn →F) if
lim
n→∞E{h(Xn)} = E{h(X)}
for any bounded continuous function h.

lishing the stability of average results and revealing conditions for this stability to occur.

Physics


Chapter P1
Physical Foundations of Mechanics
Preliminary remarks. Mechanical motion is change in the location of a body with respect
to other bodies.
This deﬁnition implies that mechanical motion is relative.
In order
to describe motion, one should specify a frame of reference, which includes a body of
reference, a coordinate system ﬁxed relative to the body, and a set of clocks synchronized
with one another. Mechanics studies motions of model objects, a point particle (or a point
mass) and a rigid body.
The location of these objects is determined by a ﬁnite set of
independent parameters; the objects are said to have ﬁnitely many degrees of freedom.
Kinematics deals with the characterization of motion without ﬁnding out its reasons.
P1.1. Kinematics of a Point
P1.1.1. Basic Deﬁnitions. Velocity and Acceleration
◮Point particle. Law of motion. Path, distance and displacement. A body whose
dimensions can be neglected in studying its motion (compared to the distances of its
movement) is called a point particle (or just a particle). The position of a point particle at
an instant of time t is determined by the position vector r from the origin of some reference
frame to the particle (see Fig. P1.1). As the particle moves, the end of the position vector
traces a spatial curve, a path (also called a trajectory). In a rectangular Cartesian reference
frame, the position vector is determined by its projections onto the coordinate axis, its x-, y-,
and z-coordinates. The motion of a particle is completely determined by specifying its law
of motion, a single vector function r(t) or three scalar functions x(t), y(t), z(t). A position
vector (or any other vector) can be conveniently written in terms of its projections using
unit vectors, i, j, and k, of the respective coordinate axes as follows: r = xi + yj + zk. The
distance traveled by the particle in a given time interval is measured along the curvilinear
path. Distance is a scalar quantity; it is nonnegative and nondecreasing with time. The
displacement of a particle is the vector ∆r = r – r0 that connects an original position of the
particle with a ﬁnal one and is equal to the difference of the position vectors at the initial
and ﬁnal time.
Figure P1.1. Path and displacement.

PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
◮Velocity. The (instantaneous) velocity of a particle is the derivative of its position vector
with respect to time:
v = dr
dt .
The velocity is tangent to the path. The (time) average velocity over a ﬁnite time interval ∆t
is deﬁned as the ratio of the displacement to the time interval, vave = ∆r/∆t. (The mean
speed is equal to the ratio of the distance traveled to the time interval.) Motion is called
uniform if v = const. A uniform motion is a motion along a straight line. A uniform motion
along a given curvilinear path is a motion with a constant velocity magnitude. (An example
of such a motion is a uniform motion in a circle.)
Figure P1.2. Normal and tangential acceleration.
◮Acceleration. The acceleration of a particle is the derivative of the velocity with respect
to time:
a = dv
dt .
The vector of acceleration lies in the same plane as the portion of the path where the motion
takes places and is directed “inward” the path (if the path is a straight line, the acceleration
is directed along it). The projection of the acceleration on the velocity direction is called the
tangential acceleration and denoted aτ; it deﬁnes the rate at which the velocity magnitude
changes with time and equals its time derivative, aτ = dv/dt. The other component of
the acceleration, which is perpendicular to the velocity, is called the normal acceleration
(Fig. P1.2) and denoted an; it characterizes the rate at which the velocity direction changes
and equals an = v2/R, where R is the radius of curvature of the path (i.e., the radius of the
circle that is the best approximation to the path at the given point). The average acceleration
over a time interval ∆t is deﬁned as aave = ∆v/∆t. A motion is said to be uniformly
accelerated if a = const. A uniformly accelerated motion along a given trajectory is a
motion with aτ = const.
P1.1.2. The Direct and Inverse Problems of Kinematics
◮Direct problem. The problem of determining the characteristics of a motion for a given
law of motion is called the direct problem of kinematics.
Example 1. Let the law of motion of a particle be given by x = R cos ωt and y = R sin ωt. Find the
trajectory equation, velocity, and acceleration of the particle.
Solution. Eliminating time (by making use of the identity sin2 ωt + cos2 ωt = 1) gives the trajectory
equation: x2 + y2 = R2 (a circle of radius R). Further,
vx = dx
dt = –ωR sin ωt,
vy = dy
dt = ωR cos ωt
(velocity components),

P1.1. KINEMATICS OF A POINT
407
ax = d2x
dt2 = –ω2R cos ωt,
ay = d2y
dt2 = –ω2R sin ωt
(acceleration components).
The magnitude of the velocity, v =
p
v2x + v2y = ωR, and magnitude of the acceleration, a = ω2R, are
independent of time and are related by a = v2/R. The acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity and directed
towards the center of the circle: a = –ω2r.
◮Inverse problem. The problem of determining the law of motion for a given accelera-
tion a(t) is called the inverse problem of kinematics. For unique solvability of this problem,
one needs to know the initial conditions—the position and the velocity of the particle at an
initial instant of time.
Example 2. Uniformly accelerated motion. Given the acceleration a = const of a particle and its initial
velocity v0 and initial position r0, ﬁnd the trajectory and the law of motion of the particle.
Solution. Integrating the relation
d
dt v = a gives the velocity: v = v0 +
R t
0 a dt = v0 +at. Integrating
d
dt r = v
gives the position vector of the particle: r = r0 +
R t
0 v dt = r0 + v0t + 1
2 at2.
The particle moves in the plane of the vectors v0 and a in a parabola. This becomes apparent in the
reference frame where the y-axis is directed along a and the x-axis is perpendicular to a; we have x = x0 + v0xt
and y = y0 + v0yt + 1
2 at2.
◮Other problems. In the cases where the kinematical problem is neither direct nor
inverse and not reduced to a direct or inverse problem, one has to consider a differential
equation. Sometimes this equation can be solved by separation of variables.
Example 3. Quite often, when solving dynamical problems, one has to deal with an equation like dv/dt =
–αv2 (the body slows down with an acceleration proportional to the velocity squared; α is a constant quantity).
Find the speed of the body versus time if its initial value is v0. Also ﬁnd the speed versus the displacement s.
Solution. Separating the variables gives dv/v2 = –α dt. Integrating the left-hand side from v0 to v and the
right-hand side from 0 to t, one ﬁnds v–1 – v–1
0 = αt, and subsequently v = v0/(1 + v0αt). Integrating further,
one could ﬁnd the law of motion s(t) and then, having eliminated t, determine v(s). However, the result can be
obtained in an easier way: since v dt = ds, the original separable equation can be rewritten as dv/v = –α ds.
Integrating gives ln(v/v0) = –αs, and hence v = v0 exp(–αs).
P1.1.3. Circular Motion
Motion in a circular path can be described using three angular variables: angle of rotation ϕ,
angular velocity ω = dϕ/dt, and angular acceleration ε = dω/dt. If angles are measured
in radians, then the length of the arc corresponding to the angle ϕ equals s = ϕR. It follows
that
v = ωR,
aτ = dv
dt = εR,
an = v2
R = ω2R.
In the case of a uniform circular motion, the normal acceleration an is sometimes called
centripetal.
The above formulas for the normal and tangential accelerations can be derived by writing
the velocity as v = vτ, where τ is the unit vector directed along the velocity. Then we have
a=(dv/dt)τ +v(dτ /dt). Here we should take into account that dτ/dt=n(dϕ/dt)=n(v/R),
where n is the unit vector perpendicular to the velocity and directed along the radius. This
holds for an arbitrary path as well, provided that the radius of curvature R and the unit
normal direction n are deﬁned by the relation dτ = n(ds/R).
P1.1.4. Relativity of Motion. Addition of Velocities
If the motion of a particle is considered relative to two frames of reference, K and K′,
whose respective axes remain parallel to each other, then the velocities of the particle in

408
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
these reference frames, v and v′, satisfy the following velocity-addition formula at any
instant of time:
v = v′ + vK,
(P1.1.4.1)
where vK is the velocity of the reference frame K′ relative to K. The accelerations satisfy
a similar addition formula: a = a′ + aK.
P1.2. Kinematics of a Rigid Body
P1.2.1. Translational and Rotational Motion. Plane Motion
◮Rigid body. Translational and rotational motion. In mechanics, a rigid body is an
idealized body the distance between any two points of which does not change (i.e., there
is no deformation).
Special attention is paid to the description of two simple kinds of
motion of a rigid body: translational and rotational. In translational motion, the segment
connecting any two points of the body moves parallel to itself at all times. Since all points
of the body move in the same manner, it sufﬁces to describe the motion of a single point
only. In rotational motion, all points of the body move in circular paths whose centers lie
on the same straight line, called the axis of rotation, and the velocities of all points are
perpendicular to it. The angular velocities of all points are the same at any instant of time;
therefore, it is convenient to introduce a common vector of angular velocity ω, directed
along the axis of rotation following the right-hand rule. The distribution of linear velocities
of points of the body is expressed using cross product*
v = ω × r,
(P1.2.1.1)
where the positions vectors are drawn from any point at the axis of rotation. If the axis of
rotation is ﬁxed, the vector of angular acceleration, ε = dω/dt, is also directed along the
axis.
◮Plane motion of a rigid body. Plane motion of a rigid body is deﬁned as motion
in which the velocities of all points of the body are parallel to some plane. If there is a
translationally moving reference frame associated with an arbitrary point of the body (or its
imaginary continuation), then the relative motion of any other point will be purely rotational
about a ﬁxed axis perpendicular to the plane of motion.
Example. Wheel rolling without slipping on a ﬂat surface with a speed v is convenient to represent as
the combination of a translation motion with the speed v and a rotational motion with an angular velocity ω
(Fig. P1.3). The velocity of any point of the wheel relative to the surface can be found by the velocity-addition
law (P1.1.4.1). The speed of the lowest point O′ must be zero; it follows that v and ω are related by v = ωR.
The accelerations of all points are directed toward the wheel center.
P1.2.2. Instantaneous Axis of Rotation. Addition of Angular
Velocities. Motion Relative to a Rotational Frame
◮Instantaneous axis of rotation. If some point of a body (or its imaginary continuation)
is at rest at some instant, then there exists a straight line that passes through this point and
is at rest at this instant. This straight line is called an instantaneous axis of rotation. The
velocity distribution at the instant in question is given by (P1.2.1.1). The instantaneous axis
and ω can change their position both in space and relative to the body. In particular, the
velocities of all points of the wheel in the above example can be obtained as the result of pure
rotation about the instantaneous axis through contact point O′. The angular acceleration ε
can be nonparallel to the instantaneous axis.
* This equation is a special case of the important mathematical formula dA/dt = ω × A expressing the time
derivative of any vector A rotating with an angular velocity ω.

P1.2. KINEMATICS OF A RIGID BODY
409
Figure P1.3. Rolling of a wheel can be represented as the sum of its translational and rotational motions or as
a pure rotation about the instantaneous axis O′.
◮Motion of a rigid body with a ﬁxed point. Addition of angular velocities.
The
motion of a rigid body with a ﬁxed point is, at any instant of time, pure rotation about an
instantaneous axis. If this motion can be represented as rotation with an angular velocity ω2
relative to a reference frame rotating with an angular velocity ω1, then the resulting angular
velocity equals ω = ω1 + ω2. To prove this, one should generalize the velocity-addition law
(P1.1.4.1) to nontranslational motion of the reference frame:
v = vrel + vtransl,
(P1.2.2.1)
where vtransl is the translatory velocity of the moving reference frame at the point considered.
If the reference is rotating, we have
v = vrel + ω1 × r.
(P1.2.2.2)
If the relative motion is pure rotation, vrel = ω2 × r, then v = ω1 × r + ω2 × r = (ω1 + ω2) × r
and so the resulting motion is rotation with the angular velocity ω1 + ω2.
Figure P1.4. A cone rolls on a plane. The sum of the rotational motions is a pure rotation about the axis OA.
Example. A circular cone with a semi-apex angle α is put on its side and rolled without sliding so that its
axis rotates with an angular velocity ω1 (Fig. P1.4). Find the total angular velocity and angular acceleration of
the cone.
Solution. In the rotating reference frame where the cone axis is at rest, the cone rotates about this axis with
an angular velocity ω2. The relation between ω1 and ω2 can be found from the condition that the point A is at
rest; we have ω1l = ω2r, or ω1 = ω2 sin α. It follows that the vector ω = ω1 +ω2 is horizontal and directed along
the line of contact between the cone and the surface; this line is, of course, the instantaneous axis of rotation.
The angular acceleration is contributed by only the rotation of the vector ω2 with the angular velocity ω1, so
that ε = dω/dt = ω1 × ω2 and ε = ω1ω2 cos α.
Formula (P1.2.2.2) is a special case of the formula for the time derivative of an arbitrary
vector A:

dt =
 dA

rel
+ ω × A,
(P1.2.2.3)

410
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
where the ﬁrst term denotes the rate of change of A relative to the rotating reference frame
(see also the footnote to formula (P1.2.1.1)).
In studying motion in noninertial reference frames (see Subsection P1.8.3), we will need the relation
between the accelerations of a particle in a ﬁxed reference frame and a rotating one. This relation can be
obtained by applying (P1.2.2.3) to either term in (P1.2.2.2):
dv
dt = dvrel
dt
+ ω × dr
dt =
 dvrel
dt

rel + ω × vrel + ω × (vrel + ω × r) = arel + 2ω × vrel + ω × (ω × r).
The last term, ω × (ω × r), is the translatory acceleration of the reference frame at the given point (radial or
centripetal). Note that along with the relative and translatory accelerations, an additional term arises here. This
term, 2ω × vrel, is called the Coriolis acceleration.
P1.3. Dynamics
P1.3.1. Newton’s First Law. Mass. Momentum. Force
◮Newton’s ﬁrst law. Newton’s ﬁrst law states that there are reference frames in which
a body not interacting with other bodies is either at rest or in motion in a straight line with
constant speed. The reference frames postulated by this law are called inertial.
It follows from the velocity-addition law that any reference frame that moves with a
constant velocity relative to an inertial reference frame is also inertial.
A heliocentric
reference frame, related to the Sun and distant stars, can be considered inertial virtually
exactly. The Earth can be treated as an inertial reference frame only approximately—
the acceleration of the points at its surface amounts to 0.034 m/s2 due to Earth’s daily
rotation. In addition, the Earth orbits the Sun but the associated acceleration is three orders
of magnitude lower (check this as an exercise).
◮Mass. Momentum. From Newton’s ﬁrst law it follows that in inertial reference frames, a
body’s acceleration results from interaction of the body with other bodies. This acceleration
depends on the inertia of the body, or its ability to resist a change in velocity, and also on
the intensity and direction of action of other bodies.
The mass of a body, m, is a positive scalar quantity that characterizes the body’s
inertia. It follows from experiments that when two bodies interact with each other, their
accelerations in an inertial reference frame, a1 and a2, are opposite to each other in direction
and the ratio of their magnitudes, a1/a2, is independent of the character and intensity of
the interaction. This makes it possible to deﬁne the ratio of two masses as the reciprocal of
the ratio of the accelerations resulting from the interaction of the bodies: m1/m2 = a2/a1.
In order to express mass numerically, one has to choose a mass unit. In the International
System of Units (SI), the unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). Mass possesses the property of
additivity: if a body is divided into a number of parts, the sum of masses of all parts equals
the mass of the whole body. However, the theory of relativity shows that this property is
only valid approximately—it is violated if there is strong interaction between parts of the
body. For example, the mass of a nucleus turns out to be less than the sum of masses of its
constituting nucleons.
The momentum (also referred to as linear momentum) of a particle is a vector quantity
that equals the product of the mass of the particle by its velocity:
p = mv.
(P1.3.1.1)
Deﬁnition (P1.3.1.1) applies only if v ≪c, where c is the speed of light. A more general
deﬁnition that is valid for any v < c is introduced in the theory of relativity.

P1.3. DYNAMICS

◮Force. A force acting on a body of mass m interacting with another body is the vector
quantity F = ma, where a is the acceleration imparted by this force to the body m in
an inertial reference frame.
The more general deﬁnition is F = dp/dt.
In Newtonian
mechanics, both deﬁnitions are equivalent. However, in the theory of relativity, only the
latter is valid. In SI, force is measured in newtons (N); 1 N = 1 kg m/s2.
The change of momentum in a time interval ∆t, from time 0 to t, under the action of a
force F equals the integral ∆p = p(t) – p(0) =
R t
0 F dt. This quantity is called the impulse
produced by the force F in the time interval ∆t. The average force equals Fave = ∆p/∆t.
P1.3.2. Newton’s Second and Third Laws
◮Newton’s second law. If a particle is acted upon by N bodies with forces F1, . . . , FN,
then the particle acquires an acceleration a determined by the vector sum of the forces:
a = F
m = 1
m
N
X
j=1
Fj
or
dp
dt =
N
X
j=1
Fj.
The vector F = PN
j=1 Fj is called the net force (also known as the resultant force) of the
forces F1, . . . , FN. Newton’s second law is an equation of motion of a particle, since it
allows (in principle) the calculation of the motion of the particle if the net force applied is a
known function of time and the particle position (and velocity). Likewise, given a system
of particles, the set of Newton’s second laws for each of them allows the calculation of
the motion of the particles if the forces applied are known functions of time and mutual
positions of the particles.
Outlined below are the properties of forces that are useful in solving mechanical prob-
lems.
◮Newton’s third law states that the forces FAB and FBA with which two bodies, A and B,
act upon each other are directed along the same straight line, opposite in direction, and equal
in magnitude:
FAB = –FBA.
P1.3.3. Action at a Distance. Causality. Natural Forces
◮Action at a distance. Causality. Field. In Newtonian mechanics, Newton’s third law
is considered to hold regardless of the nature of interaction and of whether the bodies
are in direct contact with each other or interact at a distance by means of gravitational or
electromagnetic forces. However, the validity of Newton’s third law for long-range forces
would mean instantaneous transmission of information about changes in body positions.
The notion of long-range action contradicts the postulates of the theory of relativity, which
forbids information transmission at speeds faster than the speed of light. Modern physics
has rejected the use of the concept of action at a distance. Instead, it has introduced a new
participant—a force ﬁeld (e.g., gravitational, electric, etc.) that ﬁlls the whole of space.
A particle at a given point in space is acted upon not by distant bodies but by a ﬁeld in
the vicinity of the point; this ﬁeld is produced by distant bodies (ﬁeld sources). A change
in the ﬁeld is transmitted from point to point and propagates with a ﬁnal speed (speed
of light). Newtonian mechanics is valid in low-speed approximation, v ≪c, and in this,
nonrelativistic limit, one can use both action at a distance and ﬁeld.
It is convenient to study motion of a particle (or a system of particles) in an external
stationary ﬁeld generated by sources at rest (e.g., Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld). A force ﬁeld

412
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
is called central if the force exerted by the ﬁeld on a particle placed in it is directed toward
a single point called the ﬁeld origin (force center) and the magnitude of the force depends
only on the distance r to the origin, so that
F(r) = Fr(r) r
r ,
where Fr(r) is the projection of the force onto the radial direction; Fr > 0 corresponds to
repulsive forces and Fr < 0 corresponds to attractive forces. A ﬁeld is called uniform in a
region of space if this force is the same (in direction and magnitude) at every point of space:
F = const.
◮Natural forces. The whole diversity of naturally occurring forces can be reduced to
a few fundamental types of interaction: gravitational, weak, electromagnetic, and strong.
However, for practical purposes, this approach is unsuitable. Apart from the fundamental
long-range forces (gravitational force in mechanics), one needs to know properties of various
forces arising when macroscopic bodies are in contact with one another. Below is the list
of forces arising in solving mechanical problems.
1. Gravitational force mg (the force with which a body at the Earth’s surface is pulled
to the Earth’s center).
2. Elastic force. When a body is deformed in a certain direction, the restoring elastic
force is proportional to the deformation (Hooke’s law): Fe = k|∆l|, where k is the spring
constant (body stiffness) and ∆l is the deformation in this direction. The spring constant
of an elastic rod is proportional to its cross-sectional area and inversely proportional to its
length, so that
Fe = ES |∆l|
l
,
where E is Young’s modulus, which depends on the rod material. In the limit of inﬁnitely
large stiffness, the (normal) reaction force N and the string tension force T arise; these
forces are determined from the equations of motion. Such forces are called constraint
reaction forces or constraint reactions.
3. Dry friction force. Sliding friction force: Ffr = µ1N, where µ1 is the sliding friction
coefﬁcient. Static friction force: Ffr ≤µ2N, where µ2 is the static friction coefﬁcient. It
is usually assumed that µ1 = µ2 in solving problems. The static friction force is also a
constraint reaction.
4. Drag force. Drag refers to forces that oppose the relative motion of a body through
a liquid or gas. It depends on the relative speed and the transverse size of the body. For low
relative speeds and small sizes, the drag force is proportional to the speed (viscous drag).
For large relative speeds, the drag force is proportional to the cross-sectional area and the
speed squared (head-on drag or quadratic drag).
P1.3.4. Galilean Relativity Principle
Galilean relativity (also known as Galilean invariance) is a principle that states that all
laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial reference frames. Suppose a frame K′ moves
relative to a frame K with a constant velocity V. Let the respective axes of the two frames
be parallel to each other and let the x- and x′-axes be directed along V (Fig. P1.5). Also
let time be counted off from the instant when the frames coincide. Then the coordinates
and time in the frame K′ are expressed in terms of those in the frame K using the Galileo
transformations
x′ = x – V t,
y′ = y,
z′ = z,
t′ = t.

Figure P1.5. Two inertial reference frames. The mechanical laws have the same form in both frames.
Under the Galileo transformations, the difference of the velocities of two particles as well as
the distance between them remain unchanged; this means that the forces acting between the
two particles also remain the same. Furthermore, the Galileo transformations do not change
the accelerations of the particles. Consequently, both sides of the equation of Newton’s
second law remain unchanged. So the equation of motion has the same form in various
reference frames (invariance under the Galileo transformations).
The Galileo transformations are based on the assumption that the course of time and the
lengths of segments are independent of the reference frame, which were considered to be
inherent properties of space and time. The theory of relativity revises the traditional view of
space and time and shows that the Galileo transformations are valid for V ≪c. The more
general transformations are the Lorenz transformations, which are valid for any V < c.
P1.4. Law of Conservation of Momentum
P1.4.1. Center of Mass. Momentum of a System of Particles
◮System of particles. Center of mass. Consider a system of N particles. The forces
acting on a jth particle can be divided into internal ones, Fi
jk, exerted by the other particles,
and external ones, the resultant of which will be denoted Fe
j . According to Newton’s third
law, the sum of the internal forces is zero. Hence, the sum of all forces acting on the system
equals the sum of external forces. If the particles do not interact with external bodies, then
the system is called closed (or isolated).
The center of mass (or center of inertia) of a system of N particles with masses
m1, . . . , mN and position vectors r1, . . . , rN is the point whose position is deﬁned by the
vector
rcm = m1r1 + · · · + mNrN
m1 + · · · + mN
.
(P1.4.1.1)
A translationally moving reference frame with origin at the center of mass is called a
center-of-mass frame.
If the mass of a system is distributed continuously (in space, on surface, or along a
line), the system can be mentally divided into a large number of small regions to represent
particles.
Further, passing to a limit, one can replace summation by integration.
The
distribution of mass over volume is deﬁned using mass density (or simply density), ρ(r),
such that dm = ρ(r) dV . Then, for continuously distributed mass, the deﬁnition of the center
of mass (P1.4.1.1) becomes
rcm =
R
rρ(r) dV
R
ρ(r) dV .
A body with constant density across the whole volume is called a uniform body.

PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
◮Momentum. The momentum of a system of particles is deﬁned as the sum of momenta
of the constituting particles:
p =
X
pj.
Differentiating equation (P1.4.1.1) with respect to time, one can ﬁnd that the momentum of
the system is expressed in terms of the center-of-mass velocity as
p = mvcm,
(P1.4.1.2)
where m is the total mass of the system. It follows that the momentum of a system of
particles equals zero in a center-of-mass frame.
Summing up the Newton’s Second Law equations for each particle, dpj/dt = Fj, and
taking into account that the internal forces are canceled out, one obtains
dp
dt =

Fe
j
(P1.4.1.3)
This means that the rate of change of the momentum of the system equals the net external
force.
P1.4.2. Law of Conservation of Momentum. Motion of Center of
Mass
◮Law of conservation of momentum. From equation (P1.4.1.3) it follows that the
momentum of a closed system is conserved. The law of conservation of (linear) momentum
is a consequence of uniformity of space (there is no distinguished point in space) and is
therefore a fundamental law of nature. Although derived within the scope of Newtonian
mechanics, this law remains valid beyond it. Even with allowance for a ﬁnite speed of
signal propagation, which leads to violation of Newton’s third law, the law of conservation
of momentum is obeyed exactly, provided that the momentum of the transmitter (force ﬁeld)
is taken into account.
The momentum of an unclosed system is conserved in the following cases:
1. The net external force is zero.
2. The net external force is perpendicular to some direction. Then the projection of
momentum on this direction (not the whole momentum) is conserved.
3. If the interaction last a very short time ∆t and the net external force Fe is bounded,*
then the change in the momentum of the system, Fe∆t, can be neglected (effectively
assuming that ∆t →0).
◮Motion of center of mass. On differentiating equation (P1.4.1.2) with respect to time
and taking into account (P1.4.1.3), we arrive at the equation of motion of the center of mass
macm =
X
Fe
j .
(P1.4.2.1)
It follows that the center of mass moves in the same manner as though it was a single
particle, whose mass is equal to the mass of the system, moving under the action of the net
external force.
* Under these conditions, the momenta of particles can change considerably under the action of large
internal forces (explosion, impact, etc.).

P1.5. LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY

Example. A thin rod of length l and mass m rotates in a horizontal plane about one of its ends with an
angular velocity ω. Find the tension force at the middle of the rod.
Solution. The center of mass of the outer half of the rod moves in a circle of radius 3
4 l under the action of a
single force, the unknown tension force. It follows from equation (P1.4.2.1) that F =

Note that the center of mass of a closed system moves with a constant velocity; hence,
a center-of-mass frame is inertial.
◮Spacecraft propulsion. For a spacecraft in outer space (far away from gravitating
bodies), a change initsvelocityis only possible byexhaustingpart of mass, rocket propellant.
The equation of motion of a spacecraft under the action of an external force F and a
propulsive jet can be easily obtained by writing down Newton’s second law in the form
(P1.4.1.3) in an inertial frame associated with the spacecraft at the current instant:
m ∆v + ∆M u = F ∆t,
where u is the jet velocity relative to the spacecraft and ∆M is the mass of the propellant
exhausted in time ∆t. Dividing by ∆t, one arrives at the Meshcherskii equation:
ma = F – µu,
where µ = ∆M/∆t = –∆m/∆t is the propellant use in the jet. The latter term on the
right-hand side is called the propulsive force.
Let us write the Meshcherskii equation for the case of motion in a straight line with no
external force applied to obtain m(dv/dt) = –(dm/dt)u. Assuming that u is constant and
denoting the initial mass of the spacecraft by m0, we ﬁnd how the speed of the spacecraft
depends on its mass: v/u = – ln(m/m0) (Tsiolkovsky equation).
P1.5. Law of Conservation of Energy
P1.5.1. Work and Power. Kinetic Energy
◮Mechanical work is a scalar quantity that is a measure of change in energy. The work
of external forces equals the change in energy:
A = E2 – E1.
(P1.5.1.1)
Based on this equation, we will deﬁne different kinds of energy. (A reﬁnement of this
principle will be given in Chapter P2.)
The work of a force on a small portion of a path is deﬁned as the dot product of the force
by the displacement: δA = F ⋅dr. The work on the whole path from position 1 to position 2
equals
A =
Z 2

F ⋅dr =
Z 2

Fτ |dr| =

F |dr| cos α,
where Fτ is the projection of the force on the direction of motion of the point where the
force is applied and α is the angle between the force and this direction. In SI, work and
energy are measured in joules (J) (1 J = 1 N m).

= F ⋅(r2 – r1),
equals the dot product of the force by the total displacement and is independent of the path of the point at which
the force is applied.

Example 2. The work of a central force, the force exerted by a central ﬁeld (see Subsection P1.3.3), equals
A =
Z 2
1
F ⋅dr =
Z r2
r1
Fr(r) dr.
It has been taken into account that the projection of dr onto the radial direction is equal to the change in the
distance r to the origin. The work depends only on the initial, r1, and ﬁnal, r2, distance to the origin and is
independent of the path.
◮Mechanical power is the rate at which work is performed.
The average power is
the ratio of the work done to the time interval. The instantaneous work equals the time
derivative of the work done:
P = dA
dt = F ⋅dr
dt
= F ⋅v = Fτv.
Power is measured in watts (W): 1 W = 1 J/s.
◮Kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a particle is the energy it possesses due to its
motion and depending on its speed. The velocity of a particle changes under the action of
a net force F, the work of which equals
A =

It is apparent that, in accordance with the general principle (P1.5.1.1), kinetic energy can
be deﬁned as Ek = mv2/2. The above equation, stating that the change in the kinetic energy
equals the work of the net force, is known as the work-energy theorem.
The kinetic energy of a system of particles is deﬁned as the sum of the kinetic energies
of all constituting particles. The change in the kinetic energy of the system equals the work
of all forces acting on its particles. The kinetic energy of a system of particles equals
Ek = mv2
cm
2
+ Erel,
(P1.5.1.3)
where m is the mass of the system, vcm is the speed of its center of mass, and Erel is the
kinetic energy relative to a center-of-mass frame. Equation (P1.5.1.3) is known as K¨onig’s
theorem.
P1.5.2. Conservative Forces. Potential Energy
◮Conservative forces. Potential ﬁeld. A force of interaction between two particles is
called conservative if the work of this force depends on only the initial and ﬁnal positions
of the particles and does not depend on their paths. Forces that do not satisfy this condition
are called nonconservative.
An external stationary ﬁeld is called potential if its work on moving a particle depends
on only its initial and ﬁnal positions and does not depend on its path. (It is equivalent to say
that the work of the ﬁeld on moving a particle through a closed path is zero.) A potential
ﬁeld is a ﬁeld of conservative forces; it is generated by ﬁxed external sources. As follows
from example 1, a uniform ﬁeld is potential. From example 2 it follows that any central
ﬁeld is potential. A superposition of several central ﬁelds (generated by several sources) is
also a potential ﬁeld. Hence, an electrostatic ﬁeld and a stationary gravitational ﬁeld are
also potential. From example 2 it also follows that the elastic force produced by a light
spring is conservative.
A system of particles with only conservative forces acting between them is referred to
as a conservative system.

P1.5. LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
417
◮Potential energy is energy stored within a system; it characterizes interaction between
particles and depends on their mutual positions. The potential energy of a particle in an
external potential ﬁeld is deﬁned as follows.
Let us deﬁne the difference between the
potential energies of the particle as the work performed by the ﬁeld to move the particle
from one position to another:
Ep(r1) – Ep(r2) = A12.
(P1.5.2.1)
This work is independent of the path. Hence, the change in the potential energies, E2 – E1,
equals the negative of the work done by the ﬁeld. If the particle is moved very slowly by
an external force, then the work performed by the external force is equal in magnitude and
opposite in sign to the work of the ﬁeld, so Ae
12 = E2 – E1 in accordance with the general
principle (P1.5.1.1).
Equation (P1.5.2.1) deﬁnes the difference of potential energies; so the potential energy
is deﬁned up to an additive constant. To make the deﬁnition unambiguous, one should
specify the value (usually zero) of the potential energy at some point in space.
Example 1. The work done by the force of gravity mg on lifting a particle of mass m from height h1 to
height h2 is equal to mgh1 – mgh2. Consequently, the potential energy of the particle in the gravitational ﬁeld
is Ep = mgh, where the height is counted off from a chosen zero level. The potential energy of a system of
points in the ﬁeld of gravity equals
Ep =
X
j
mjghj = mg
P
j mjhj
m
= mghcm,
where m is the mass of the system and hcm is the height of its center of mass.
Example 2. The work done by the elastic force equals
R x2
x1 (–kx) dx = 1
2 kx2
1 – 1
2 kx2
2, where x1 and x2 are
the initial and ﬁnal points of the spring deformation. Consequently, the potential energy of the elastic spring is
Ep = 1
2 kx2, where zero energy corresponds to the undeformed spring.
Example 3. The work done by friction or resistive forces is negative on each segment of the path and
also along a closed path. Consequently, these forces do not satisfy the condition of being conservative and are
nonconservative.
The potential energy of conservative interation of two particles can be treated as the
potential energy of one particle in the ﬁeld generated by the other. The result is independent
of which particle is considered to be the ﬁeld source.
◮Relation between force and potential energy. By writing equation (P1.5.2.1) for two
close particles lying on the x-axis and separated by a distance dx, one obtains Ep(x) –
Ep(x + dx) = Fx dx. It follows that the projection Fx of the force F onto the x-axis is
determined by the derivative of the potential energy:
Fx = – ∂Ep
∂x .
(P1.5.2.2)
The partial derivative means that Ep is treated as a function of only x here. The same is
obviously valid for projections on any other direction. Consequently, the vector of force
equals the opposite of the gradient of the potential energy:
F = –
 ∂Ep
∂x i + ∂Ep
∂y j + ∂Ep
∂z k

= – grad Ep,
(P1.5.2.3)
where i, j, and k are unit vectors in the x-, y-, and z-axis, respectively.
For central ﬁeld, formula (P1.5.2.2) becomes
Fr = – dEp(r)
dr
.

PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
P1.5.3. Mechanical Energy of a System of Particles. Law of
Conservation of Mechanical Energy
◮Mechanical energy.
The mechanical energy of a system of particles is deﬁned as
the sum of its kinetic energy, the internal potential energy due to interaction between the
particles, and the potential energy in an external ﬁeld:
Emech =
X
j
mjv2
j
2
+
X
j<n
Ejn +
X
j
Ee
j.
(P1.5.3.1)
According to K¨onig’s theorem (P1.5.1.3), the kinetic energy of a system equals the sum of two terms, the
energy of its motion as a whole, mv2
cm/2, and the kinetic energy in a center-of-mass frame, Erel. The sum
of Erel and the potential energy of particle interactions is sometimes called the internal mechanical energy of
the system.
◮Change in mechanical energy. The change in the kinetic energy of a system equals
the total work of all forces applied to the particles (see equation (P1.5.1.2)). The change in
the potential energy equals the negative of the work of the conservative forces and external
potential ﬁelds. Consequently, the change in the mechanical energy of the system equals
the work done by the internal nonconservative forces and all external forces, except for the
potential ﬁelds, whose contribution is included into Emech. So we have
∆Emech = Anonconservative + Ae.
(P1.5.3.2)
◮Law of conservation of mechanical energy. The mechanical energy of a closed conser-
vative system does not change. This statement is a special case of the general fundamental
principle of conservation of energy: the total energy of a closed system is conserved. Apart
from the mechanical energy, the total energy also includes the different kinds of internal
energy: thermal, chemical, and nuclear. The general principle of conservation of energy
goes far beyond the scope of Newtonian mechanics, within the framework of which the
law of conservation of the mechanical energy has been obtained. This principle is in close
connection with the fundamental postulate of uniformity of time (there is no selected instant
in time) and is one of the fundamental principles on which modern physics is based.
Note that if a conservative system is in an external potential ﬁeld, the mechanical energy is also conserved,
provided that the potential energy of the particles in the ﬁeld is included in it.
The condition for a system to be conservative is equivalent to the requirement that both
the mechanical and internal components of the total energy must be conserved individually.
If, for example, there are friction forces acting in the system, whose work is negative, then
the mechanical energy is reduced (see equation (P1.5.3.2)) being converted into the internal
energy; in this case, heat is said to be produced in the system. The mechanical energy can
change also in the case where there is a mechanism present in the system that can produce
work at the expense of the internal energy (e.g., an internal combustion engine, a human
being, etc.).
Example 1. Elastic collision. In a central elastic impact of two balls, both the momentum of the system
and its mechanical energy are conserved. If m1 and m2 are the masses of the balls, v1 and v2 are speeds of the
balls before the collision, and u1 and u2 are those after the collision, we have
m1v1 + m2v2 = m1u1 + m2u2,
m1v2
1
2
+ m2v2
2
2
= m1u2

2
+ m2u2

.
Instead of the second equation, it is more convenient to use the condition that the relative speed of the balls does
not change in magnitude but changes in sign: v1x – v2x = u2x – u1x. This equation can be derived directly from

P1.5. LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
419
the ﬁrst two, but it becomes obvious if we consider the motion in a center-of-mass frame (the relative speed
remains the same here). In this frame, the total momentum of the system is zero and the speed of either ball
simply reverses after the impact; both conservation laws are obeyed. Then, solving the two linear equations,
we ﬁnd the ﬁnal speeds of the balls:
u1 = (m1 – m2)v1 + 2m2v2
m1 + m2
,
u2 = (m2 – m1)v2 + 2m1v1
m1 + m2
.
If we replace the second ball with a moving wall (m2 ≫m1), we get
u1 ≈–v1 + 2v2,
u2 ≈v2.
Example 2. Inelastic collision.
Two balls of masses m1 and m2 with velocities v1 and v2 undergo
a perfectly inelastic collision such that the balls move as one with a velocity u after the collision.
(No
rotation occurs if the impact is central in a center-of-mass frame.) The velocities become equal as a result of
nonconservative forces, which means that some heat is released in the impact. This can be veriﬁed by ﬁnding
the ﬁnal velocity using the law of conservation of momentum, m1v1 + m2v2 = (m1 + m2)u, and calculating the
decrease in the mechanical energy:
m1v2

+ m2v2
2
2
– (m1 + m2)u2

=
m1m2

.
It is even easier to obtain this result considering the motion in a center-of-mass frame, where the balls are at
rest after the collision.
P1.5.4. Potential Curves. Stability
If we know the potential energy Ep(r) of a one-dimensional motion in a potential ﬁeld
(an example is shown in Fig. P1.6), then we can ﬁnd out the following based on relation
(P1.5.2.2):
a) The direction of the force (F > 0 for 0< r < rmin and r > rmax; F < 0 for rmin < r < rmax).
b) The points of equilibrium (F = 0 at r = rmin and r = rmax).
c) Stability of equilibrium. In the vicinity of the point r = rmin, the force is directed
toward the point, so the equilibrium is stable. At r = rmax, the equilibrium is unstable. A
stable equilibrium corresponds to a minimum of the potential energy.
Figure P1.6. Given a potential energy curve, one can determine the direction of the force, the positions of the
equilibrium points and their stability, and the character of motion.
d) The character of motion for a given value of the total mechanical energy E. Motion
is possible only where E > Ep (the kinetic energy is nonnegative). If E < Ep(∞) (in
Fig. P1.6, Ep(∞) = 0), motion is ﬁnite, so it can occur in a limited range of r. With E < 0
in Fig. P1.6, motion occurs only between the turning points r2 and r3. For E > 0, motion
is either inﬁnite, where the particle goes to inﬁnity with kinetic energy E after reﬂecting
from the turning point r5, or locked by a potential barrier, where the particle moves between
the turning points r1 and r4. In classical mechanics, a potential barrier is impenetrable. In
quantum mechanics, there is a nonzero probability that a potential barrier can be penetrated
(tunnel effect).

P1.6. Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum
P1.6.1. Moment of Force. Net Force
◮Moment of force. The moment of a force F about a point O is deﬁned as
M = r × F,
(P1.6.1.1)
where r is the vector from O to the point where the force is applied.
A moment of
force is also called a torque. The moment of force does not change if the force is moved
along the straight line of its application. The magnitude of the moment of force equals
M = Fr sin α = Fd, where α is the angle between the force vector and the radius vector r,
and d is the distance between the point O and the line of action of the force; the distance d
is called the moment arm (Fig. P1.7).
Figure P1.7. The moment of the force F is perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁgure and directed away from the
reader. The magnitude of the moment equals the product of F by the arm d.
The most important property of moment of force is that the sum of the moments of
internal forces in an arbitrary system of particles is zero. This fact follows from Newton’s
third law (see Subsection P1.3.2), since the forces acting between each pair of particles are
equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and directed along the straight line connecting
the particles.
Note another property of moment of force: if the sum of forces is zero, then these forces
produce the same net moment about any point in space.
◮Net force. The net force of a system of forces is the force that equals the vector sum of
them and is applied so that its moment about any point in space equals the net moment of
this system of forces.
Example. Compute the net moment of the forces of gravity acting on the particles of a system:
M =
X
rj × mjg =
X
mjrj

× g = rcm × (mg),
where m is the mass of the system, rcm is the radius vector of the center of mass. It is apparent that the net
force passes through the center of mass; hence, the center of mass is also the center of gravity.
The moment of force about an axis z is the z-projection, Mz, of the moment of force
about any point on the axis. If both r and F in (P1.6.1.1) are resolved into two components,
parallel and perpendicular to the axis z, so that r = r∥+ r⊥and F = F∥+ F⊥, then the
components parallel to the axis will not contribute to the projection of the moment onto
the axis. It follows that Mz = (r⊥× F⊥)z. In the plane perpendicular to the axis, we have
the same picture as in Fig. P1.7, except that r and F must be replaced with r⊥and F⊥.
Accordingly, the magnitude of the moment about an axis is also equal to the product of the
force by the moment arm, while the choice of the positive direction along the axis can be
replaced with the easier choice of the positive direction of rotation about the axis.

P1.6. LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM
421
P1.6.2. Angular Momentum of a Particle. Motion in Central Field
◮Angular momentum. The angular momentum of a particle about a point O is the
vector quantity
L = r × p,
(P1.6.2.1)
where r is the vector from O to the position of the particle and p = mv is the (linear)
momentum of the particle. Angular momentum is also known as moment of momentum. If
the particle moves with a constant velocity, its angular momentum does not change. The
magnitude of the angular momentum equals the product of the momentum by the arm. The
angular momentum about an axis z is the z-projection, Lz, of the angular momentum L
about any point at the axis. The angular momentum about an axis is determined by the
projection of the momentum on a plane perpendicular to the axis: Lz = (r⊥× p⊥)z. These
properties are similar to those of the moment of force.
The time derivative of the angular momentum of a particle about a point O,
dL
dt = dr
dt × p + r × dp
dt = v × p + r × F = M,
(P1.6.2.2)
equals the moment of the net force about O (since v and p are parallel to each other, we
have v × p = 0)
◮Motion in central ﬁeld. Since the force acting on a particle in a central ﬁeld (also
called a central-force ﬁeld) is directed to the origin of the ﬁeld, the moment of this force
about the origin is identically zero. Hence, the vector angular momentum L is conserved.
It follows from deﬁnition (P1.6.2.1) that the motion occurs in one plane perpendicular
to L and the quantity L = mvr sin α is conserved. The magnitude of the angular momen-
tum is proportional to the rate at which the radius vector r sweeps out area (Fig. P1.8):
dS/dt = 1
2 r(v dt) sin α/dt = 1
2 L/m. Consequently, the statement that angular momentum
is conserved in a central ﬁeld turns out to be equivalent to Kepler’s second law of planetary
motion.
Figure P1.8.
The rate at which the radius vector
sweeps out area is expressed in terms of the angular
momentum.
Figure P1.9. Fly-by of a particle near a force ﬁeld
center; b is the aiming parameter.
Example 1. Aiming parameter. Conservation of angular momentum in a central ﬁeld allows one to relate
the aiming parameter b of a particle approaching the ﬁeld origin from far away (Fig. P1.9) to the distance of
closest approach r1 to the origin. (The aiming parameter is the distance from the ﬁeld origin to the straight line
of particle motion in the absence of interaction.) At the instant of closest approach to the origin, the particle
velocity is perpendicular to the radius vector, so the law of conservation of angular momentum can be written
as
mv0b = mv1r1,
where v0 is the initial speed of the particle far away from the origin and v1 is the particle speed at the instant of
closest approach. Expressing v1 and substituting into the law of conservation of energy, 1

the scattering angle θ.
Solution. From symmetry considerations it is clear that the change in momentum in the whole duration
of the motion is directed along the z-axis (see Fig. P1.10) and is equal to
|∆p| = ∆pz = 2mv0 sin(θ/2).
The change in momentum (projected onto the z-axis) in the time dt is

from –(π – θ)/2 to (π – θ)/2 yields
∆pz = 2mA

Comparing the two expressions of ∆pz and taking into account that L = mv0b, we ﬁnd that

◮Effective potential energy.
With the laws of conservation of energy and angular
momentum, one can establish the time dependence of the central distance r by reducing
the problem to that of one-dimensional motion. To this end, the particle velocity should be
resolved into two mutually perpendicular components (Fig. P1.11), a radial one, vr = dr/dt,

and an azimuthal one, vϕ. The angular momentum is expressed in terms of the azimuthal

The second term is sometimes called the centrifugal energy. The graph of the effective

conditions.

Figure P1.12 depicts qualitatively the dependence of the effective potential energy Eeff

on the distance r for various L (L0 = 0 and L1 < L2 < L3) in the case that Ep = –b/r. It is
apparent that, for any L, the condition of ﬁniteness of the motion remains the same: E < 0.
P1.6.3. Conservation of Angular Momentum for a System of
Particles
◮Angular momentum of a system of particles. The angular momentum of a system
of particles about a point O is the vector sum of the angular momenta of the constituting
particles. It is equal to
L = rcm × p + Lrel,
(P1.6.3.1)
where Lrel is the angular momentum in a center-of-mass frame. One of the consequences
of equation (P1.6.3.1) is that if the linear momentum of the system is zero, the angular
momentum L does not depend on the choice of the point O.
Summing up equation
(P1.6.2.2) over all point of the system and taking into account that the net moment of
internal forces is zero, we ﬁnd that
dL
dt = Me,
(P1.6.3.2)
or the time derivative of the angular momentum of the system equals the net moment of
external forces.

424
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
◮Law of conservation of angular momentum. It follows from equation (P1.6.3.2) that
the angular momentum of a closed system is conserved. The law of conservation of angular
momentum is a fundamental law based on the postulate of isotropy of space (there is no
selected direction in space). Just as with the laws of conservation of linear momentum and
energy, the application of the law of conservation of angular momentum goes beyond the
scope of Newtonian mechanics, where it was derived.
The angular momentum of a unclosed system is conserved in the following cases:
1. If the net moment of external forces Me is zero. (Example: a system of interacting
particles in an external central ﬁeld.)
2. If the moment of external forces about an axis is zero, then the angular momentum
about this axis is conserved.
Example. If a weight of mass m attached to one end of a weightless string moves in a horizontal circle,
the other end of the string ﬁxed, then the angular momentum about any point at the axis of rotation (except
for the center of the circle) is not conserved. However, the angular momentum about the axis of rotation is
conserved, since the moment of the force of gravity and that of the tension force about this axis are both zero.
3. If the external forces are bounded, then the change in angular momentum ∆L=Me∆t
in the short time of impact ∆t can be neglected.
P1.6.4. Two-Body Problem. Reduced Mass
◮Reduced mass.
Consider a closed system consisting of two interacting particles.
Solving the problem of motion of these particles (known as the two-body problem) means
determining the particle positions at any time for given initial conditions. The positions
of the particles are expressed in terms of the position of their center of mass rcm(t) (see
(P1.4.1.1)) and their relative displacement r12 = r1 – r2 as follows:
r1 = rcm +
m2
m1 + m2
r12,
r2 = rcm –
m1
m1 + m2
r12.
The center of mass moves with a constant velocity, with the initial position and velocity
found from the initial conditions (see equations (P1.4.1.1) and (P1.4.1.2)). Thus, solving
the two-body problem is reduced to determining r12.
From the conditions of uniformity and isotropy of space and uniformity of time, it
follows that the particles interact with central forces such that F12 = –F21 = F, where F is
parallel to r12 and the magnitude F is dependent on |r12| only. Let us write the equations of
motion for each particle:
F = m1
d2r1
dt2 ,
–F = m2
d2r2
dt2 .
Subtracting the second equation divided by m2 from the ﬁrst equation divided by m1, we
get

F = d2r12

or
F = µ d2r12

where µ is the reduced mass determined by

so
µ =

m1 + m2
.
(P1.6.4.1)
It is apparent that the vector r12 is determined by solving the problem of motion of a particle
of mass µ in a central ﬁeld.

P1.7. GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
425
◮Linear momenta and kinetic energies of two bodies in a center-of-mass frame. The
particle momenta in a center-of-mass frame, ep1 and ep2, are equal in magnitude (the total
momentum is zero, with ep2 = –ep1 and |ep1| = |ep2| = ep) and are expressed in terms of the
particle relative velocity (independent of the reference frame) as
|vrel| =

This formula was already encountered in considering inelastic collision (example 2, Sub-
section P1.5.3).
P1.7. Gravitational Field
P1.7.1. Law of Universal Gravitation. Superposition Principle
◮Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated
by a distance r are pulled to each other with a force of gravity (gravitational force) equal to
F = G m1m2
r2
,
(P1.7.1.1)
where G ≈6.673 × 10–11 N m2/kg2 is the gravitational constant. The gravitational force is
a central force; it acts along the line connecting the particles.
The force exerted on a point mass m in a central ﬁeld of gravity (gravitational ﬁeld)
produced by a ﬁxed mass M can be represented as (see Subsection P1.3.3)
F = –G mM
r2
r
r
or
Fr(r) = –G mM
r2 .
(P1.7.1.2)
Thus, the role of the “charge” for a gravitational ﬁeld is played by the inertial mass m.
This property is sometimes formulated as the equivalence of gravitational and inertial
masses.
The potential energy of a particle in a central ﬁeld of gravity can be found
by using the relation between force and potential energy (formula (P1.5.2.4)); we have
–GmM/r2 = –dEp/dr, so Ep = –GmM/r +const. The constant is usually set to zero, thus
taking the potential energy to be zero at inﬁnity:
Ep = –G mM
r
.
(P1.7.1.3)
◮Principle of superposition. If a ﬁeld of gravity is generated by several point masses,
M1, . . . , MN, then the force acting on a particle m and its potential energy are expressed as
F =

(P1.7.1.4)
where r is the position vector of the particle m and rj is the position vector of the mass
point Mj. If a gravitational ﬁeld is generated by a continuously distributed mass, then the
summation in (P1.7.1.4) must be replaced by integration.

426
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
P1.7.2. Strength and Potential of Gravitational Field
◮Strength and potential of the gravitational ﬁeld generated by a point mass.
It
is apparent from equations (P1.7.1.4) that both the force acting on a particle of mass m
in a gravitational ﬁeld and the potential energy of the particle are proportional to m.
Hence, the speciﬁc force, F/m, and speciﬁc energy, Ep/m, are independent of m and so
characterize the ﬁeld itself. These are called the strength and potential of the gravitational
ﬁeld, respectively, and denoted
g = F
m ,
ϕ = Ep
m .
The ﬁeld strength has a simple physical meaning: it is the acceleration due to gravity, or
the acceleration acquired by any particle placed at a given point due to the action of the
gravitational ﬁeld only. The strength and potential created by a point mass M are expressed
as
g = –G M
r2
r
r ,
ϕ = –G M
r .
(P1.7.2.1)
The strength and potential of the gravitation ﬁeld generated by several point masses are cal-
culated using the principle of superposition. For example, let us write equations (P1.7.2.1)
for the case of a body with distributed mass:
g(r) = –
Z
G
ρ(r′)
(r – r′)2
r – r′
|r – r′| dV ′,
ϕ(r) = –
Z
G ρ(r′)
|r – r′| dV ′,
(P1.7.2.2)
where ρ(r) is the mass density at the position r and the integration is performed over the
volume occupied by the body.
Example 1. Show that the gravitational strength inside a hollow spherical layer is zero.
Solution. For a given point A, consider the contributions to the ﬁeld strength of the small regions B and C
cut out from the sphere by a thin cone with apex at A (Fig. P1.13). The ratio of the areas of these regions, and
hence the ratio of their masses, equals the ratio of the squared distances of the regions to the point A. It follows
that the strengths produced by the regions B and C at A are equal in magnitude.
Figure P1.13. The strengths of the gravitational ﬁelds generated by opposite regions on a spherical surface
cancel each other out.
The ﬁeld strength produced by a thin hollow sphere of mass M outside the sphere turns
out to be equal to the strength produced by a point mass M placed at the sphere center.
Cumbersome integration is required to prove this result (Newton was ﬁrst to do this). In
Chapter P3, this statement will be proved using Gauss’s theorem. The same result holds
true for any spherically symmetric distributed mass and, in particular, for any spherical
planet.

P1.8. NON-INERTIAL REFERENCE FRAMES
427
Example 2. Suppose a mass M is uniformly distributed along a segment of length l.
Compute the
gravitational strength and potential at the point lying outside on the continuation of the segment at a distance x

It is apparent that a symmetric but nonspherical body cannot be replaced by a point mass placed at its center.
This example illustrates also that the strength and potential are linked by the relation gx = –∂ϕ/∂x, which is
similar to (P1.5.2.2).
P1.7.3. Motion in a Central Field of Gravity. Kepler’s Laws. Orbital
and Escape Velocities
◮Motion in a central ﬁeld of gravity. Kepler’s laws. Motion in a central ﬁeld of gravity
obeys the general laws of motion in a central ﬁeld. However, it has some speciﬁc features
reﬂected in Kepler’s ﬁrst and third laws initially formulated for planets of the solar system.
Kepler’s ﬁrst law states that a ﬁnite motion (E < 0) of a particle in a central gravitational
ﬁeld occurs in a closed path—an ellipse with the force center (the sun) located at one of its
foci.
Kepler’s second law afﬁrms the constancy of the areal velocity, i.e., the rate at which
the radius vector of the moving particle sweeps area. This law holds for any central ﬁeld
and follows directly from the law of conservation of momentum (see Subsection P1.6.2).
Kepler’s third law states that, for any two particles moving in a central gravitational
ﬁeld, the ratio of the squares of their orbital periods equals the ratio of the cubes of the
semimajor axes of their orbits: T 2
1 /T 2
2 = a3
1/a3
2.
Kepler’s ﬁrst law should be supplemented with the statement that an inﬁnite motion of
a particle in a central gravitational ﬁeld occurs in either a parabola (E = 0) or a hyperbola
(E > 0). The third law can be supplemented by the relationship between the speciﬁc energy
of orbital motion and the semimajor axis: |E|/m = GM/(2a). It is apparent that the orbital
period is uniquely determined by the speciﬁc energy of the moving particle.
◮Orbital and escape velocities. The orbital velocity (also known as the ﬁrst cosmic
velocity) of a small body around a planet is the speed at which the body moves in a circular
orbit around the planet near its surface, with the atmospheric drag neglected. The orbital
speed is determined from the equation mg = mv2
o/R and equals vo =
p
gR =
p
GM/R,
where M is the mass of the planet. (For Earth, vo ≈7.9 km/s.)
The escape velocity (also known as the second cosmic velocity) of a body is the minimum
speed the body must have to “break free” from a planet’s gravitational pull and go to inﬁnity.
As follows from Subsection P1.6.2, the condition for a motion to be inﬁnite is the inequality
E ≥0; hence, the escape velocity is determined by the equation mv2
e/2 – GmM/R = 0 and
equals ve =
p
2GM/R =
p
2gR. (For Earth, ve ≈11.2 km/s.)
P1.8. Non-Inertial Reference Frames
P1.8.1. Deﬁnition of Fictitious Forces
In many cases, it is convenient to solve a dynamics problem in a non-inertial frame of
reference (a reference frame that is not inertial) instead of recalculating results ﬁrst obtained

428
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
in an inertial frame. To this end, ﬁctitious forces (also called inertial forces) are introduced
as follows. In Newton’s second law for a particle of mass m moving under the action of a
net force F, the acceleration is ﬁrst represented as the sum of two components, a = arel + a∗,
where arel is the acceleration of the particle in the non-inertial frame.
Then the other
component, multiplied by m, is transferred to the other side of the equation and called the
ﬁctitious force. So we have
F = ma,
F = m(arel + a∗),
F + (–ma∗) = marel,
F + Fﬁct = marel.
The ﬁctitious forces are thus deﬁned by
Fﬁct = –ma∗,
(P1.8.1.1)
where the acceleration a∗is determined by the kinematic equation
a = arel + a∗
(P1.8.1.2)
and is dependent on the non-inertial frame itself and the position and velocity of the particle
in it. Consider some speciﬁc cases.
P1.8.2. Translationally Moving Non-Inertial Frames
In this case, a∗equals the acceleration of the inertial frame K (see formula (P1.1.4.1)).
Then the ﬁctitious force is expressed as
Fﬁct = –maK.
It is apparent that the ﬁctitious force here is equivalent to the force of gravity. So it is
convenient to combine the two forces together in solving problems. With this done, the
introduction of a ﬁctitious force turns out to be equivalent to adjusting the acceleration due
to gravity (see Subsection P1.7.2), so that g is effectively replaced by g∗= g + a∗= g – aK.
Example. A container ﬁlled with a liquid moves with a constant horizontal acceleration a. Find the
angle β between surface of the liquid and the horizontal plane.
Solution. In a reference frame associated with the container, the liquid surface is at rest and “horizontal,”
which means that it is perpendicular to the vector g∗= g + a∗= g – a. So we need to ﬁnd the angle between g
and g – a. We have tan β = a/g.
The principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational forces was laid by Einstein at
the basis of his general theory of relativity, which is a relativistic theory of gravitation and
explains the appearance of gravitational forces by the fact that the space–time continuum is
curved by external massive bodies.
P1.8.3. Uniformly Rotating Reference Frame
In this case the kinematic equation for the acceleration (P1.8.1.2) becomes: a = arel + ω ×
(ω × r) + 2ω × vrel (see Subsection P1.2.2). The second term is associated with the rotation
of the translatory velocity ω × r together with the reference frame. This vector is directed
toward the axis of rotation and its magnitude equals ω2R (R is the distance to the axis), and
hence it is the normal (centripetal) acceleration of the reference frame at the given point.

P1.9. DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODY
429
The third term (Coriolis acceleration) is due to, ﬁrst, the rotation of vrel together with
the reference frame and, second, the change in the translatory velocity ω × r due to the
movement of the particle from one point of the rotating non-inertial frame to another.
Accordingly, the ﬁctitious force (P1.8.1.1) is the sum of two components, the ﬁrst called
the centrifugal force and the second called the Coriolis force:
Fﬁct = Fcf + FCor = mω2R + 2mvrel × ω.
(P1.8.3.1)
The centrifugal ﬁctitious force is directed outward from the axis of rotation (R is directed
from the axis and is perpendicular to it). Since it is independent of the particle velocity,
its action is indistinguishable from a (nonuniform) gravitational ﬁeld. For example, the
force of gravity measured at the Earth’s surface is the sum of the gravitational force and the
centrifugal inertial force.
The Coriolis force is perpendicular to the particle velocity. For example, in the Northern
hemisphere, for motions along the Earth’s surface the horizontal component of the Coriolis
force is directed to the right of the motion, which exhibits itself in the formation of cyclones
(rotate counterclockwise), greater erosion of right river banks, etc.
Example. Find the deﬂecting action of the Coriolis force onto a body freely falling on the Earth’s surface
from a height h at the equator.
Solution. Since the deviation is small, the “undisturbed” velocity of free falling v = gt can be substituted
in the Coriolis force (P1.8.3.1). The vector ω is perpendicular to v, and hence the Coriolis force is directed
eastward, its magnitude equal 2mvω, and the horizontal acceleration imparted to the body is aeast = 2ωgt.
Integrating yields the horizontal speed veast = gωt2 and the horizontal displacement seast = 1
3 gωt3. Substituting
the time of falling t =
p
2h/g gives the ﬁnal deviation. For example, if the initial height is h = 300 m, the ﬁnal
deviation is approximately 10 cm.
P1.9. Dynamics of Rigid Body
P1.9.1. Rotation About a Fixed Axis
For a rigid body consisting of many particles of mass mj and rotating about a ﬁxed axis z

external forces about the axis of rotation (see equation (P1.6.3.2)), we get
Mz = Izε,

Example. A body of mass m is attached to one end of a weightless rope wound around a pulley of radius R
and moment of inertia I. Find the acceleration of the body after it has been released.
Solution. Let us write Newton’s second law for the body: mg – T = ma. The equation of motion of the
pulley (P1.9.1.3) is TR = Iε. Using the kinematic relation a = εR (the rope does not slide against the pulley)
and solving the above equations for a, we obtain a = g/(1 + I/mR2).
P1.9.2. Properties of Moment of Inertia
The moment of inertia (P1.9.1.2) is a scalar quantity that characterizes the distribution mass
of the body relative to the axis of rotation. It can be seen from equations (P1.9.1.3) and
(P1.9.1.4) that the moment of inertia is a measure of the body’s inertia with respect to
rotational motion; moment of inertia plays the same role as mass in translational motion.

theorem) relates the moment of inertia I about an arbitrary axis to the moment of inertia I0
about a parallel axis passing through the center of mass of the body:
I = I0 + ma2,
(P1.9.2.1)
where m is mass of the body and a is the distance between the axes. For example, the
moment of inertia of a disk about an axis perpendicular to its plane and passing through its
edge equals 1
2 mR2 + mR2 = 3
2 mR2. The minimum moment of inertia among all parallel
axes is for the axis passing the center of mass.
◮Perpendicular axis theorem. The perpendicular axis theorem asserts that the moment
of inertia of a plane body about an arbitrary axis z perpendicular to the body plane equals
the sum of the moments of inertia about mutually perpendicular axes x and y lying in the
body plane and intersecting z:
Iz = Ix + Iy.
For example, the moment of inertia of a thin disk about an axis of symmetry lying in its
plane equals Ix = Iy = 1
2 Iz = 1
4 mR2.

◮Moments of inertia of some bodies. Listed below are moments of inertia of some
bodies of various shape.
1) Thin ring of radius R (about its axis of symmetry): I = mR2. The same result holds
for a thin hollow cylinder (without end caps).
2) Thin rod of length l (about an axis through its center and perpendicular to its axis):
I =
1
12 ml2. A thin rectangular plate has the same moment of inertia about the axis through
the centers of its opposite sides having the length l. The moment of inertia about a parallel
axis through one of the ends of the rod equals I = 1
3 ml2.
3) A thin rectangular plate (about the axis through its center and perpendicular to its
plane): I =
1
12 m(a2 + b2). A rectangular parallelepiped has the same moment of inertia
about the axis through the centers of its opposite faces.
4) Thin spherical shell (about its axis of symmetry): I = 2
3 mR2.
5) Homogeneous solid ball (about its axis of symmetry): I = 2
5 mR2.
6) Hollow cylinder with inner radius R1 and outer radius R2: I = 1
2 m(R2
1 + R2
2).
P1.9.3. Plane Motion of a Rigid Body
Plane motion of a rigid body is the superposition of translational motion of its center of mass
and rotational motion in a center-of-mass frame (see Subsection P1.4.2). The motion of the
center of mass is described by Newton’s second law and determined by the net external force
(equation (P1.4.2.1)), where only real external forces must be taken into account, since the
moment of ﬁctitious forces relative to the center of mass is zero (just like in the case of the
forces of gravity in the example of Subsection P1.6.1). The kinetic energy of plane motion
equals Ek = 1
2 mv2
cm + 1
2 I0ω2 (see equation (P1.5.1.3)). The angular momentum about a
ﬁxed axis perpendicular to the plane of motion is calculated as (see equation (P1.6.1.3)):
Lz = ±mvcmd ± I0ω, where d is the arm of the center-of-mass velocity relative to the axis,
and the plus or minus sign is determined by the positive direction of rotation selected.
Example 1. Find the acceleration of a round body that rolls down an inclined plane without slipping
(Fig. P1.14). The radius of the body is R, its mass is m, and the moment of inertia about the central axis is I.
The angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal surface is α.
Figure P1.14. Forces acting on a body rolling down an inclined plane.
Solution. The equations of motion are: mg sin α – Ffr = ma and FfrR = Iε. The no-slipping condition
(v = ωR) leads to the equation a = εR (see the example in Subsection P1.2.1). Solving the above equations
gives the acceleration a = g sin α/(1 + I/mR2). Since the static friction force does not produce any work, the
mechanical energy is conserved.
Example 2. A thin rod of length l and mass M rests on a smooth horizontal plane. A ball of mass m
moves in the plane and undergoes an elastic collision with an end of the rod perpendicularly to the line of the
rod. The ﬁnal speed of the ball, u, and the rod center, V , as well as angular velocity of the rod, ω, after the
collision are determined from the following three equations:
1) law of conservation of linear momentum: mv = mu + MV ,

432
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
2) law of conservation of energy: mv2/2 = mu2/2 + MV 2/2 + (Ml2/12)ω2/2,
3) law of conservation of angular momentum (e.g., about the point of impact): 0 = MV (l/2)–(Ml2/12)ω.
P1.9.4. Motion with a Fixed Point
For a rigid body rotating about a ﬁxed point, its angular velocity is directed along the
instantaneous axis of rotation and changes its direction both in space and relative to the
body itself. The equation of motion
dL
dt = Me,
which is referred to as the basic equation of motion of a rigid body with a ﬁxed point,
allows us to ﬁnd out how the angular momentum L changes in time. Since L is generally
non-parallel to the angular velocity ω, we need an equation that relates L and ω in order to
close the system of equations of motion.
Example. As an inclined dumbbell rotates about a vertical axis (as shown in Fig. P1.15), its angular
momentum L = r1 × p1 + r2 × p2 is perpendicular to the straight line connecting the masses m1 and m2 of the
dumbbell and directed at a non-right angle to the axis of rotation. Also the vector L itself rotates about the
vertical axis with the angular velocity ω.
Figure P1.15. The vector of angular momentum L can be nonparallel to the axis of rotation (to ω).
◮Theorem of principal axes of inertia. The relationship between L and ω can be found
using the theorem of principal axes of inertia which states that for any rigid body and any
point O there are three mutually perpendicular axes through O such that, when the body
rotates about any of these axes, the vector L is parallel to the axis: Li = Iiωi (i = 1, 2, 3).
The moments of inertia about these axes are called principal moments of inertia. If the
rotation occurs about an arbitrary axis through O, the angular velocity can be resolved into
its projections onto the principal axes, ω = ω1 + ω2 + ω3, and the angular momentum can
be expressed as
L = I1ω1 + I2ω2 + I3ω3.
(P1.9.4.1)
(Likewise, L can be resolved into its projections onto the principal axes and then ω can be
expressed in terms of them.)
If the principal axes are through the center of mass (center of inertia) of the body, they
are called free axes. When the body rotates about any of the free axes (free rotation), both
the linear momentum and the angular momentum of the body are conserved, which means
that there is no need to apply an external force or external moment to maintain rotation.
(In the above example, the net force is zero; however, there are a couple of forces arising
at points of support whose moments provide change of L with time.) It should be noted
that free rotation is stable only about two of the three axes, the ones with the minimum and
maximum principal moments of inertia.

P1.9. DYNAMICS OF RIGID BODY
433
Example 1. When is the choice of the free axes unique?
Solution. The free axes are uniquely determined only if the three principal moments of inertia are all
different. If two moments are equal (e.g., I1 = I2 = I), then any axis that lies in the plane of the two free axes
is also a free axis, with L = Iω1 + Iω2 = Iω. If all three principal moments of inertia are equal (e.g., such is a
homogeneous cube), then any axis through the center of mass is a free axis.
Example 2. Given three principal moments of inertia (I1, I2, and I3) of a body, ﬁnd the moment of inertia I
about the axis that makes angles γ1, γ2, and γ3 with the principal axes.
Solution. The kinetic energy of the body rotating with an angular velocity ω about the speciﬁed axis can
be calculated in two ways. On the one hand, it is equal to
E = Iω2
2 .
On the other hand,
E = Lωω
2
= (L ⋅ω)
2
= I1ω2

2
+ I2ω2

,
where Lω = Iω is the projection of L onto ω. Since ωi/ω = cos γi, we ﬁnd that
I = I1 cos2 γ1 + I2 cos2 γ2 + I3 cos2 γ3.
Example 3. Free symmetric top. Nutation of the Earth’s axis. Let is ﬁnd out how the position of the
axis of rotation changes relative to a rotating body (in a reference frame associated with the body). Let us
conﬁne ourselves to the case of a free symmetric top, or a freely rotating body with I1 = I2 = I⊥and I3 = I∥≠I⊥.
(The Earth is an example of such a top.) For a symmetric top, the vector L = I∥ω∥+ I⊥ω⊥lies in the same
plane as the third axis (axis of symmetry) and the vector ω = ω∥+ ω⊥. In an inertial reference frame, the
angular momentum L is conserved. Consequently, in the rotating top-related reference frame, the vector L
performs rotation with an angular velocity ω at the current time, and hence it obeys the equation
dL
dt = ω × L.
This equation is called Euler’s equation (usually, a system of three scalar equations is written out which is
obtained by projecting this vector equation onto axes 1, 2, and 3 taking into account relation (P1.9.4.1)).
The complexity of Euler’s equation is that the vector ω is not constant but linked to L by the linear relation
(P1.9.4.1). For a symmetric top, ω × L is perpendicular to the plane (ω, L); hence, dL∥/dt = I∥dω∥/dt = 0
(ω∥= const). For ω⊥, we have the equation
I⊥dω⊥
dt
= (ω∥+ ω⊥) × (I∥ω∥+ I⊥ω⊥) = (I⊥– I∥) ω∥× ω⊥
or
dω
dt = Ω× ω,
where
Ω= (I⊥– I∥)
I⊥
ω∥
This equation shows that in the top-related frame, the axis of rotation performs a circular motion about axis 3
with the angular velocity Ω. For the Earth, there is a small relative difference between the moments of inertia
I⊥and I∥, which leads to a slow periodic motion of the Earth’s axis (nutation of the Earth’s axis) with a period
of tens of days.
◮Gyroscopes. A gyroscope is a rigid body that rapidly spins about its axis of symmetry.
The problem of motion of the gyroscope’s axis can be solved in the so-called gyroscope
approximation, L = Iω, where both L and ω are directed along the axis of symmetry. A
perfectly balanced gyroscope is a gyroscope whose center of mass is ﬁxed. It possesses the
property of being inertialess: its axis stops moving as soon as the external action is removed
(M = 0). This property allows to use such gyroscopes to preserve orientation in space. A
heavy gyroscope is a gyroscope whose center of mass is displaced by a distance d from the
ﬁxed point (Fig. P1.16). The moment of the force of gravity acting on a heavy gyroscope is
perpendicular to L. Since dL/dt ⊥L, the angular momentum L and the gyroscope’s axis
perform regular rotation about the vertical axis (precession of a gyroscope). The end of the
vector L moves in a horizontal circle of radius L sin α with the angular velocity
Ω= |dL/dt|
L sin α = mgd sin α
Iω sin α
= mgd
Iω .
The angular velocity of precession is independent of the angle α made by the axis of rotation
with the vertical.

P1.10. Special Theory of Relativity
P1.10.1. Basics of the Special Theory of Relativity
Einstein’s special theory of relativity (STR), also known as special relativity (SR), extends
the limits of classical Newtonianphysics, validfor nonrelativistic velocities (small compared
to the speed of light c), to any velocities, including relativistic (comparable with c). In
the classical limit v/c →0, all results of special relativity reduce to results of classical,
nonrelativistic physics.
◮Postulates of STR. The special theory of relativity relies on two postulates:
The principle of relativity: all physical laws, both mechanical and electromagnetic,
have the same form in all inertial reference frames. This implies that no inertial reference
frame can be distinguished from any other by any experiments and taken to be the rest
inertial frame.
This postulate is an extension of the Galilean relativity principle (see
Subsection P1.3.4) to electromagnetic phenomena.
The principle of invariant light speed: the speed of light in vacuum is the same for any
inertial frame and equals c ≈3 × 108 m/s. This postulate contains two statements: (i) the
speed of light is independent of the state of motion of the light source and (ii) the speed
of light is independent of which inertial frame is the observer measuring this speed in (i.e.,
independent of the speed of the receiver).
The invariance of the light speed and its independence of the state of motion of the light source follow from
Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic ﬁeld. It seemed obvious that this statement could hold in only one
reference frame. From the classical conceptions of space and time, any other observer moving with a speed v
relative to this frame should measure the speed of light as c + v if moving toward the source or c – v if moving
away from the source. This result would mean that Maxwell’s equations hold in only one reference frame ﬁlled
with quiescent “ether,” through which electromagnetic waves travel. However, the attempt to detect a change
in the light speed due to Earth’s motion relative to the ether (Michelson–Morley experiment) failed to detect
such a change. Einstein put forward the hypothesis that Maxwell’s equations, as well as all physics laws, must
have the same form in all inertial frames, and hence the light speed must be the same in all inertial frames. This
hypothesis led to revision of the basic concepts of space and time.
◮Lorentz transformations. The Lorentz transformations link the coordinates and time
of an event measured in two inertial frames, one of which (K′) moves relative to the other
(K) with a constant velocity V. If the coordinate axes and the initial instant are chosen
in the same way as in the Galilean transformations (see formulas (P1.3.4.1)), the Lorentz
transformations have the form
x′ =
x – V t
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
y′ = y,
z′ = z,
t′ = t – (V/c2)x
p
1 – V 2/c2 .
(P1.10.1.1)

P1.10. SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
435
It is often convenient to use the transformations for the differences of the coordinates and
time instants of two events:
∆x′ = γ(∆x – V ∆t),
∆y′ = ∆y,
∆z′ = ∆z,
∆t′ = γ

∆t – (V/c2)∆x

. (P1.10.1.2)
where the notation
γ =
1
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
γ ≥1,
(P1.10.1.3)
is used for brevity. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations
for V ≪c. The Lorentz transformations are derived from the second pustulate of STR
(invariance of light speed) and the requirement of linearity of the transformations (this
requirement expresses the condition of uniformity of space). The inverse transformations,
expressing the coordinates and time in K via those in K′, can be obtained from (P1.10.1.1)
and (P1.10.1.2) by substituting –V for V :
∆x = γ(∆x′+V ∆t′),
∆y = ∆y′,
∆z = ∆z′,
∆t = γ

∆t′ +(V/c2)∆x′
. (P1.10.1.4)
P1.10.2. Consequences of the Lorentz Transformations. STR
Kinematics
◮Length contraction. The length of a moving segment is deﬁned as the distance between
the points at which the segment ends were at the same time (i.e., ∆t = 0). Consider a rigid
body that moves translationally with a speed v and let K′ denote a reference frame associated
with it. From equation (P1.10.1.2), where one should set V = v and ∆t = 0, one ﬁnds that
the longitudinal dimension of a moving body is reduced:
l = l0/γ = l0
q
1 – v2/c2,
(P1.10.2.1)
where l0 is the proper longitudinal dimension measured in frame K′, where the body is at
rest. The transverse dimensions of a moving body do not change.
Example 1. A square plate moving at the speed v = 0.8 c along one of its sides becomes a rectangular
with the angle between the diagonals equal to arccot
p
1 – v2/c2 = arccot 0.6 ≈59◦.
◮Time dilation.
It can be seen from the Lorentz transformations that time passes
differently in different inertial frames. In particular, two events occurring simultaneously
(∆t = 0) but at different points in frame K may not be simultaneous in frame K′, so
that ∆t′ = –γV ∆x/c2 can be positive or negative. This effect is known as relativity of
simultaneity. A clock that moves together with frame K′ (i.e., that rests relative to K′, with
∆x′ = 0) shows the proper time of this frame. For an observer in frame K, this clock is
slow (time dilation). Considering two readings of the moving clock as two events, we ﬁnd
from (P1.10.1.4) that
∆t = γ∆τ =
∆τ
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
(P1.10.2.2)
where ∆τ = ∆t′ is the proper time of the moving clock (to be precise, of the associated
reference frame). The fact that all reference frames are indistinguishable manifests itself in
that a clock resting relative to frame K appears to the observer in frame K′ to lag behind
the observer’s clock in K′. (Note that, to control the moving clock, the stationary observer
in K uses different clocks at different instants.)

436
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
The twin paradox consists in that special relativity predicts a change in the age of two
twins, one of which stayed on the Earth and the other traveled in deep space at relativistic
speeds and then returned to the Earth (the traveler will be younger). It may seem as though
this thought experiment violates the principle of indistinguishability of reference frames. In
fact, the Earth’s twin stayed all the time in one and the same inertial frame but the astronaut
changed his or her frame to return to the Earth (the astronaut-associated frame was not
inertial).
Example 2. The mean proper lifetime of the muon (an unstable subatomic particle) is τ = 2.2 × 10–6 s,
with cτ ∼660 m (c is the speed of light). Due to time dilation, from the viewpoint of an Earth’s observer, a
space muon ﬂying with a relativistic speed v with γ ≫1 has a mean lifetime of γτ and travels a distance cγτ
from its birth in upper atmosphere, which allows detecting the muon on the Earth’s surface.
◮Velocity addition in special relativity. If a particle moves with velocity v′ relative to
frame K′, then its velocity relative to frame K can be found by expressing dx, dy, dz,
and dt from (P1.10.1.4) and substituting into vx = dx/dt, vy = dy/dt, and vz = dz/dt to
obtain
vx =
v′
x + V
1 + v′xV/c2 ,
vy =
v′
y
p
1 – V 2/c2
1 + v′xV/c2
,
vz = v′
z
p
1 – V 2/c2
1 + v′xV/c2
.
(P1.10.2.3)
For nonrelativistic speeds, vx ≪c andV ≪c, the above formulas reduce to the nonrelativistic
velocity-addition law (see equation (P1.1.4.1)). Formulas (P1.10.2.3) have the important
property that if V and v′ less than c, then v is also less than c. For example, if the particle
is ﬁrst accelerated to V = 0.9 c relative to the rest frame and then is further accelerated to
v′ = 0.9 c in the moving, particle-associated frame, the resulting speed will be 1.8 c/1.81 < c
rather than 1.8 c. It is apparent that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. The light speed
is the maximum possible speed at which interactions can be transferred in nature.
◮Spacetime interval. Casuality. The Lorentz transformations preserve neither the time
interval nor the length of a spatial segment. However, it can be shown that the following
quantity is preserved under the Lorentz transformations:
s2
12 = (c∆t)2 – (∆x)2 – (∆y)2 – (∆z)2 = (c∆t)2 – (∆r)2.
(P1.10.2.4)
The quantity s12 is called the spacetime interval between events 1 and 2 (∆t = t2 – t1 and
∆r = r2 – r1).
If s2
12 > 0, the spacetime interval is called time-like. In this case, there is an inertial
frame where ∆r = 0, which means that the events occur at the same place but at different
times. Such events can have a cause–effect relationship.
If s2
12 < 0, the spacetime interval between events is called space-like.
In this case,
there is an inertial frame in which ∆t = 0, so that the events occur simultaneously at
different locations in space. Such events cannot have a causal relationship. The condition
c|∆t| < |∆r|, or c|t2 – T1| < |r2 – v1|, means that a light beam emitted at the instant of the
earlier event (at t1) from the point r1 cannot reach the point r2 by the instant t2. Events
separated from event 1 by time-like intervals represent its absolute past (if t2 – t1 < 0) or
absolute future (if t2 – t1 > 0); the sequence of events is the same in all inertial frames. The
sequence of events separated by a space-like interval can be different in different inertial
frames.
◮Lorentz four-vectors. A quadruple of scalar quantities (Ax, Ay, Az, Aτ) = (A, Aτ) that
are transformed, when passing from frame K to frame K′, in the same way as (x, y, z, ct),
or (see (P1.10.1.1))
Ax′ = Ax – (V/c)Aτ
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
Ay′ = Ay,
Az′ = Az,
Aτ ′ = Aτ – (V/c)Ax
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
(P1.10.2.5)

P1.10. SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY
437
is called a Lorentz four-dimensional vector (or, for short, four-vector or 4-vector). The
numbers Ax, Ay, and Az are called the spatial components of the 4-vector and Aτ is called
its time component. The sum of two 4-vectors and the product of a 4-vector by a scalar
number are also 4-vectors. The quantity A2 = A2
τ –A2, analogous to the spacetime interval,
and also the scalar product AτBτ – A ⋅B are preserved in changing from one inertial frame
to another. A physical equation written as an equality of two 4-vectors remains valid in all
inertial frames.
P1.10.3. STR Dynamics
◮Momentum and energy in special relativity. The velocity components are not trans-
formed in the same way as the components of a 4-vector (cf. equations (P1.10.2.3) and
(P1.10.2.5)), since both the numerator and the denominator are transformed in the ex-
pression v = dr/dt. Consequently, the quantity P
j mjvj, corresponding to the classical
deﬁnition of momentum, cannot be preserved in all inertial frames. The relativistic 4-vector
of momentum is deﬁned as
p = m dr
dτ =
m
p
1 – v2/c2
dr
dt ,
pτ = m d(ct)
dτ
=
mc
p
1 – v2/c2 ,
where dτ = dt
p
1 – v2/c2 is the inﬁnitesimal change in the proper time of the particle (see
(P1.10.2.2)), i.e., the time measured in an inertial frame whose velocity coincides with that
of the particle at the given instant (dτ is independent of which inertial frame the particle is
observed from). The spatial components of the 4-vector make up the relativistic momentum
p =
mv
p
1 – v2/c2 ,
(P1.10.3.1)
while the time component pτ turns out to be equal to E/c, where E is the relativistic energy
of the particle:
E =
mc2
p
1 – v2/c2 .
(P1.10.3.2)
The 4-vector (p, E/c) is called the momentum-energy four-vector or the four-momentum.
It is noteworthy that the relativistic energy and momentum are linked by the simple relation
p = Ev
c2 .
(P1.10.3.3)
In accordance with (P1.10.2.5), in changing from one inertial frame to another, the energy
and momentum are transformed as
px′ = px – V E/c2
p
1 – V 2/c2 ,
py′ = py,
pz′ = pz,
E′ =
E – V px
p
1 – V 2/c2 .
(P1.10.3.4)
The relativistic energy of a particle is nonzero at v = 0; it consists of the rest energy, mc2,
and the kinetic energy,
E =
mc2
p
1 – v2/c2 = mc2 + Ek.
(P1.10.3.5)

438
PHYSICAL FOUNDATIONS OF MECHANICS
Note that for v/c ≪1, the relativistic kinetic energy reduces to the classical kinetic energy
Ek = mv2/2. Since the quantity (E/c)2 – p2 is conserved, it can be calculated in a frame
where the particle is at rest at the given instant:
E2
c2 – p2 = m2c2
or
E2 – p2c2 = m2c4.
(P1.10.3.6)
For particles with zero mass (e.g., photons), the energy–momentum relation becomes
E = pc
(P1.10.3.7)
(see also (P1.10.3.3)). Substituting E = mc2 + Ek into (P1.10.3.6) yields a convenient
relation between momentum and kinetic energy:
p2c2 = Ek(Ek + 2mc2).
◮Inelastic collision. Relation between energy and mass. Let us write down the law
of conservation of relativistic energy for a perfectly inelastic collision of two particles of
mass m each that moved toward each other with identical speeds v. We have
mc2
p
1 – v2/c2 +
mc2
p
1 – v2/c2 = Mc2.
It is apparent that the mass M of the combined particle is larger than the total mass of the
initial particles. The increase in the internal energy at the inelastic collision by ∆E resulted
in a mass increase of ∆E/c2. This example illustrates the general Einstein relationship
between the relativistic energy of a resting body and its mass:
E = mc2.
(P1.10.3.8)
Relativistic energy includes all kinds of energy.
Example 1. Suppose the energy of a body at rest equals E. Find the momentum of the body in a reference
frame moving with a speed –v.
Solution. In accordance with the relativistic transformation formulas (P1.10.3.4), the momentum equals
p′ = (E′/c2)v =
(E/c2)v
p
1 – v2/c2 .
It is seen that we have obtained the formula for relativistic momentum with mass m = E/c2.
Example 2. Accelerators with colliding particle beams. Suppose that in order to achieve the threshold
energy of a nuclear reaction, the particles in colliding beams must be accelerated to a kinetic energy αmc2. To
what kinetic energy must a single particle be accelerated if the other particle is in a stationary target?
Solution. In the nonrelativistic case, the energy in a center-of-mass frame equals half the energy of the
oncoming particle. It is this energy that can be spent to the reaction, while the other half is inaccessible—
it remains as kinetic energy of the system. In the relativistic (an especially ultrarelativistic) limit, the picture
is cardinally different. Compute the energy of the moving particle (the other particle is at rest). Write the
energy-momentum invariance condition for E2 – p2c2. In a center-of-mass frame, we have E = 2αmc2 + 2mc2
and p = 0. In a moving inertial frame where one of the particles is at rest, we have E = E1 + mc2 and p = p1,
with E1 and p1 being the energy and momentum of the moving particle. On rearranging and taking into account
the identity E2
1 –p2
1c2 = m2c4, we ﬁnd the kinetic energy of the oncoming particle as E1 –mc2 = 2mc2α(α+2).
For example, if α = 100, we ﬁnd that one particle must be accelerated to 20,400 mc2. Approximately, 1/100
of the particle energy is available for the reaction.

However, the relativistic momentum (P1.10.3.1) is different from the classical one. Under
the action of the load applied, the momentum can increase unboundedly. However, as seen

(P1.10.3.2) and also p ⋅dp = E dE/c2 (see (P1.10.3.6)).

Chapter P2
Molecular Physics and Thermodynamics
P2.1. Basic Principles and Deﬁnitions
P2.1.1. Two Approaches to Studying Matter
◮Thermodynamic approach.
The thermodynamic approach of studying substances
consists of establishinglinks and relations betweenexperimentally determined (phenomeno-
logical) parameters (called thermodynamic parameters) based on several postulates (laws
of thermodynmics).
◮Statistical approach. The statistical approach relies on kinetic-molecular postulates
on the structure of substance (fundamentals of kinetic-molecular theory). These postulates
include the following:
1. All bodies consist of a huge number of tiny particles—atoms and molecules.
2. These molecules are in constant random motion.
3. The molecules interact with one another: they experience attractive forces at large
distances and repulsive forces at small enough distances.
The thermodynamic parameters are calculated within the framework of a speciﬁc model
of internal structure of substance (i.e., the model of motion and interaction of atoms and
molecules) by averaging over a huge number of states of the system. Statistical physics
employs methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics. The classical theory
relies on the classical laws of molecular motion, while quantum statistics relies on the laws
of quantum mechanics.
◮Amount of substance. Mole. The amount of substance in a system—or the number
of constituting structural units, atoms and molecules—is measured in moles. One mole of
any substance contains a certain number of molecules, called Avogadro’s number (or the
Avogadro constant) and equal to the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12. Avogadro’s
number equals NA ≈6.02 × 1023 mol–1. The number of moles in the system is expressed as
ν = N
NA
= m
µ ,
(P2.1.1.1)
where N is the number of molecules in the system, m = m0N is the mass of the system,
m0 being the mass of a single molecule, and µ = m0NA is the molar mass of the substance.
P2.1.2. Equation of State
◮Equilibrium states. A thermodynamic system that is kept under unchanged external
conditions comes to an equilibrium state, where there are no ﬂuxes of any kind (e.g., mass
or energy ﬂuxes). The thermodynamic parameters of the equilibrium state (pressure p,
temperature T, volume V , density ρ, molar mass µ, etc.) are related by an equation of state.
For example, the ideal gas law (also known as the Clapeyron–Mendeleev equation), which
is the equation of state of an ideal gas, has the form
pV = νRT
or
pV = NkT,
(P2.1.2.1)
441

MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
where R ≈8.31 J/(mol K) is the gas constant and k = R/NA ≈1.38 × 10–23 J/K is the
Boltzmann constant.
This equation was obtained empirically and it describes well the
behavior of thin real gases (see Subsection P2.5.2). The van der Waals equation,
(V – νb)

p + aν2
V 2

= νRT,
(P2.1.2.2)
is an equation of state that provides good approximation to the behavior of dense real gases
(see Section P2.6).
A process of changing the state of a system is called equilibrium (also quasi-equilibrium
or quasistatic) if it occurs so slowly that every intermediate state of the system can be treated
as equilibrium. Equilibrium processes are typically reversible (i.e., can be made to pass
through all their intermediate states in order); however, irreversible equilibrium processes
are possible (e.g., for systems with memory).
In what follows, when speaking of an
equilibrium process we imply a reversible equilibrium process.
◮Simple thermodynamic system. A homogeneous and isotropic thermodynamic sys-
tem whose chemical composition does not change is called (thermodynamically) simple.
Examples of simple systems are one-component (pure) gases and liquids. A simple system
has two degrees of freedom, which means that only two of its thermodynamic parameters
are independent. Equilibrium states of a simple system can be represented by points in a
plane (e.g., in coordinates p and V ) and equilibrium processes, by lines in this plane. The
work done by a simple system against external forces equals
δA = p dV ,
A =
Z V2
V1
p(V ) dV ,
(P2.1.2.3)
where the relationship p(V ) is called a process equation. Since the work is not a function
of state, the inﬁnitesimal work increment is denoted by δA, in order to distinguish it from
the inﬁnitesimal increment of a function (differential).
If any three parameters of a simple system are related to one another, due to an equation of state, their
derivatives are also related by an equation. For example, expressing the inﬁnitesimal increment of T in terms
of those of p and V , we have dT = (∂T/∂V )p dV + (∂T/∂p)V dp. By applying this expression to isothermal
process (dT = 0), we obtain

◮Nonequilibrium systems. Equilibrium thermodynamics deals with equilibrium states
and processes. It can judge the direction of nonequilibrium processes between the ini-
tial and ﬁnal equilibrium states but cannot provide quantitative characterization of these
processes. Nonequilibrium systems are studied by physical kinetics and nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. Note that the time in which a system comes to equilibrium (relaxation
time) decreases with decreasing system size, and therefore the term local equilibrium in a
small portion of a nonequilibrium system makes sense. Consequently, it is meaningful to
speak of local thermodynamic parameters (functions of state) that vary from point to point
in a nonequilibrium system (e.g., temperature T(r)).
An important role in studying nonequilibrium systems is played by the notions of ﬂux
of a physical quantity (e.g., the number of molecules, mass, momentum, energy, charge,
etc.) through a given surface and ﬂux density at a given point in space.

P2.2. FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
443
For instance, energy ﬂux W equals the amount of energy transferred through a surface per unit time
(measured in J/s, or W). A ﬂux density is a vector quantity that characterizes the direction and intensity of
transfer of a physical quantity through a given point in space. For instance, energy ﬂux density w equals in
magnitude to the ratio of the energy ﬂux ∆W through a small surface to the area ∆S of this surface (measured
in W/m2) in the limit ∆S →0. Among all small surfaces through the given point, one must take one for
which the above ratio is maximum. The vector w is taken to be perpendicular to this surface and pointing in the
direction of the energy transfer. The energy ﬂux through a given surface equals W =
R
w ds, where ds = n ⋅ds,
with n being the positive unit normal vector at the given point of the surface. Note that in electrodynamics (see
Subsection P3.7.1), the ﬂux of electric charge is called the electric current I and the ﬂux density, the current
density j.
A state of a nonequilibrium system is called stationary if the ﬂux densities of all physical
quantities at all points are time independent. Recall that in an equilibrium state, there are
no ﬂuxes, that is, the ﬂux densities at all points are zero.
P2.2. First Law of Thermodynamics
P2.2.1. Quantity of Heat. Internal Energy
◮Quantity of heat. Unlike mechanical energy, which can only change through work,
internal energy can change both due to work and due to contact with bodies having different
temperatures (in the process of heat exchange). The amount of energy absorbed or lost by
a system in a thermal contact is called the quantity of heat or just heat and denoted Q. Heat
is considered positive if energy is received by the system and negative if it is given off.
In a thermal contact, energy is transferred from a body with a higher temperature to a
body with a lower temperature. Any temperature scale must satisfy this property. Empirical
temperature scales are based on indirect measurements, that is, on changes in parameters
monotonically dependent on temperature. A gas scale of temperatures relies on the equation
of state of the ideal gas (P2.1.2.1). A thermodynamic, or absolute scale, is based on the
second law of thermodynamics.
◮Internal energy. From the viewpoint of classical kinetic-molecular theory, the internal
energy U of a thermodynamic system equals the sum of the kinetic energy of motion
of all its molecules and the potential energy of their interaction.
The internal energy,
U = U(V , T, . . . ), is a function of state of a thermodynamic system;* it is the most
important characteristic of the system.
Thermodynamics must deﬁne any quantity phenomenologically, regardless of our knowledge about the
internal structure of the substance. The concept of an adiabatic envelope can be used to see that this is possible
in principle. The adiabatic envelope of thermodynamic system allows the shape of the system to be changed
and work on the system to be done but excludes thermal exchange of the system with external bodies. In this
case, the work done by the external forces, Ae, as the system performs a transition from state 1 to state 2 is
independent of the transition process and is only dependent on the initial and ﬁnal states. This allows us to
deﬁne the internal energy difference as U2 – U1 = Ae(1 →2).
P2.2.2. First Law of Thermodynamics
The general law of conservation of energy, which takes into account thermal exchange and
internal energy, reads
∆Emech + ∆U = Ae + Q.
(P2.2.2.1)
It states that the change in the total (mechanical plus internal) energy equals the work done
by external forces and the quantity of heat received by the system in thermal exchange
* The relationship U = U(V , T, . . . ) is called a caloric equation of state, in contract to p = p(V , T), called
a thermal equation of state.

444
MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
with external bodies. Sometimes, the law of conservation of energy is formulated as the
impossibility of creating a perpetual motion machine of the ﬁrst kind (that would produce
energy from nothing). The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is the special case of the law of
conservation of energy as applied to thermodynamic systems, whose mechanical energy
does not change. In addition, in thermodynamics it is customary to use the work done by
the system against external forces: A = –Ae. We have
Q = ∆U + A,
(P2.2.2.2)
which means that the heat supplied to a thermodynamic system is spent to change its internal
energy and produce work against external forces.
◮First law of thermodynamics for a simple system. Heat capacity. Using equation
(P2.1.2.3), let us write out the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for a simple system that has
received an inﬁnitesimal quantity of heat:
δQ = dU + p dV .
(P2.2.2.3)
The ratio of δQ to the temperature increment dT is called the heat capacity of the system
in the equilibrium process being considered. Heat capacity is measured in J/K and denoted
by C. We have
C dT = dU + p dV .
(P2.2.2.4)
Considering U in (P2.2.2.4) to be a function of two variables (V , T), we can write
dU =
 ∂U
∂T

V dT +
 ∂U
∂V

T dV = CV dT +
 ∂U
∂V

T dV ,
(P2.2.2.5)
where CV =
 ∂U
∂T

V is the heat capacity at constant volume (see equation (P2.2.2.4)). So
we have
C dT = CV dT +
h
p +
 ∂U
∂V

T
i
dV .
(P2.2.2.6)
It can be seen that the heat capacity for a process V (T) depends on the value of the derivative
dV/dT. Since the parameters (V , T) can be varied independently, this derivative and, hence,
the heath capacity at a given point can take any value.
◮Enthalpy. The Joule–Thomson process. If the state of a system is changed as an
equilibrium process under a constant pressure, then the heat supplied can be expressed as
Q = ∆U + p∆V = ∆(U + pV ) = ∆H
(p = const).
(P2.2.2.7)
The quantity H = U + pV is called the enthalpy of the system. So the heat supplied equals
the enthalpy difference at the ﬁnal and initial states. Enthalpy is also used to describe
the Joule–Thomson process (also called a throttling process), where a substance is forced
through a porous wall without heat exchange with the environment. This process is used
to achieve very low temperatures. Enthalpy is conserved in the Joule–Thomson process:
U1 + p1V1 = U2 + p2V2.
◮Thermodynamic cycle. A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes
in which a system eventually returns to its initial equilibrium state. At some stage, the system
absorbs a quantity of heat Q1 from higher-temperature bodies (hot reservoir) and at another
stage, it gives up some heat Q2 to lower-temperature bodies (cold reservoir). (This follows
from the second law of thermodynamics; see Section P2.3.) For a heat engine, a device that
runs on a thermodynamic cycle, its thermal efﬁciency is the number deﬁned as
η = A
Q1
= Q1 – Q2
Q1
= 1 – Q2
Q1
,
(P2.2.2.8)
where A is the net work done in one cycle. In a thermodynamic cycle, ∆U = 0, and hence
Q1 – Q2 = A.

P2.2. FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
445
P2.2.3. First Law of Thermodynamics for an Ideal Gas
◮Internal energy of an ideal gas. The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its
temperature, so that U(p1, V1, T) = U(p2, V2, T). There is experimental evidence supporting
this statement.
1. When a gas expands into a void space inside a rigid adiabatic container, both the
work done by the gas, A, and the heat absorbed, Q, are zero, and hence ∆U = 0. It was
found (experiments by Gay-Lussac and Joule) that in this non-equilibrium process, the
temperature of ideal gases does not change.
2. The temperature of an ideal gas does not change in the Joule–Thomson process.
The second law of thermodynamics allows us to prove that (∂U/∂V )T = 0 based on the
thermic equation of state (P2.1.2.1).
From equations (P2.2.2.4) and (P2.2.2.5) we ﬁnd the increment in the internal energy
and the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for an ideal gas:
dU = CV dT,
δQ = CV dT + p dV .
(P2.2.3.1)
Experiments show that CV is independent of T in a wide range of temperatures. Hence,
we can write U = CV T + const.
◮Processes in an ideal gas. Consider a few examples to illustrate the application of the
ﬁrst law of thermodynamics to speciﬁc equilibrium processes in an ideal gas.
Example 1. Isothermal process (dT = 0). In this case, dU = 0. Hence,
δQ = p dV ,
Q = A =
Z V2
V1
p(V ) dV = νRT ln
 V2
V1

.
(P2.2.3.2)
The heat capacity of this process can be considered inﬁnitely large.
Example 2. Isobaric process (dp = 0). Introducing the heat capacity at constant pressure and taking
into account the equation of state (P2.1.2.1), we get
Cp dT = CV dT + p dV = CV dT + νR dT.
Dividing by dT gives the relation between the heat capacities (Mayer’s relation):
Cp = CV + νR,
cp = cV + R
µ ,
Cm
p = Cm
V + R,
(P2.2.3.3)
where c = C/m is the speciﬁc heat capacity and Cm = C/ν is the molar heat capacity of the gas (measured in
J/(kg K) and J/(mol K), respectively).
Example 3. Adiabatic process. If an equilibrium process occurs without heat supply (δQ = 0), then
CV dT = –p dV
=⇒
νCm
V dT = – νRT
V
dV
=⇒
dT
T

Cm

V .
Integrating yields the equation of the adiabatic process (Poisson’s equation):
TV γ–1 = const
or
pV γ = const,
(P2.2.3.4)
where the dimensionless parameter γ = Cp/CV = 1 + (R/Cm
V ) is called the adiabatic index. Using Mayer’s
relation (P2.2.3.3), we can express the molar heat capacities in terms of γ as
Cm
V =
R
γ – 1 ,
Cm
p =
γR
γ – 1 .
Example 4. Polytropic process. A thermodynamic process with constant heat capacity (C = const) is
called polytropic. We have
C dT = CV dT + p dV
=⇒
(CV – C) dT = –p dV .
Proceeding in the same manner as for the adiabatic process, we arrive at the polytropic process equation
pV n = const,
where n = 1 +
R
Cm
V – Cm = Cp – C
CV – C is the polytropic index.
It can be veriﬁed that the above thermodynamic processes are special cases of a polytropic process—
isochoric with n = ∞, isobaric with n = 0, isothermal with n = 1, and adiabatic with n = γ.

Figure P2.1 A Carnot cycle consists of two isothermal processes (1 to 2 and 3 to 4) and two adiabatic processes

Example 5. Carnot cycle.
A Carnot cycle is a thermodynamic cycle consisting of two isothermal
processes (at temperatures T1 and T2 with T1 > T2) and two adiabatic processes as shown in Fig. P2.1.

It follows that V2/V1 = V3/V4. Hence, the thermal efﬁciency is
η = 1 – T2
T1 .
(P2.2.3.5)
This means that the thermal efﬁciency of a Carnot cycle depends only on the cold-to-hot reservoir temperature
ratio.
P2.3. Second Law of Thermodynamics
P2.3.1. Formulations
Below are two most common formulations of the second law of thermodynamics:
1. It is impossible to construct an engine that would convert 100% of heat extracted
from a heat reservoir into work in a cyclic process (formulation by William Thomson—
Lord Kelvin). It is the same to say that it is impossible to create a perpetual motion machine
of the second kind (that would produce work at the expense of solely the internal energy of
a heat reservoir).
2. It is impossible to construct a refrigerator that would produce no other effect than
the transfer energy from a cooler body to a hotter one (formulation by Rudolf Clausius).
The Thomson and Clausius formulations are equivalent.
P2.3.2. Carnot’s Theorem
In general, a Carnot cycle is a thermodynamic cycle in which the working substance (of a
heat engine) absorbs heat from a hot reservoir (at a constant temperature T1) and gives up
heat to a cold reservoir (at a constant temperature T2).
Carnot’s theorem states that the thermal efﬁciency of an arbitrary Carnot cycle cannot
exceed that of any reversible Carnot cycle operating at the same temperatures T1 and T2. It
immediately follows that the thermal efﬁciency of a reversible Carnot cycle depends on T1
and T2 only and is independent of the working substance nature.

P2.3. SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
447
Let us sketch the proof of Carnot’s theorem. Assume that the thermal efﬁciency of the reversible heat
engine is less than that of the irreversible one. Let us choose the amount of the working substance in the
reversible engine such that the work done in one cycle is the same as the work done by the irreversible engine.
Using (P2.2.2.8) and the above assumption, we can write the thermal efﬁciency inequality as A/Qrev
1 < A/Qirrev
1
,
or Qrev
1
> Qirrev
1
. Now let us revert the operation of the reversible engine so that its work is consumed by the
irreversible engine. In one cycle, the combined engine produces zero work and the hot reservoir receives the
energy Qrev
1
– Qirrev
1
> 0 completely extracted from the cold reservoir. We have come to a conclusion that
contradicts the Clausius formulation of the second law.
Since we know the thermal efﬁciency of a Carnot engine, the one that runs on an ideal
gas (see (P2.2.3.5)), we can rewrite Carnot’s theorem as
Q1 – Q2
Q1
≤T1 – T2
T1
or
Q1
T1
– Q2
T2
≤0.
(P2.3.2.1)
The equality corresponds to a reversible Carnot cycle.
◮Thermodynamic temperature scale. Carnot’s theorem allows us to introduce a tem-
perature scale that does not depend on the properties of speciﬁc bodies involved.
The
temperature ratio of two bodies can be determined by connecting them with a reversible
Carnot engine. Since the ratio Q1/Q2 depends only on the two temperatures, it can be
taken to be equal to the ratio of the thermodynamic temperatures: θ1/θ2 = Q1/Q2. As seen
from (P2.3.2.1), the ratio of the thermodynamic temperatures equals that of the ideal gas
temperatures (in the range where the gas scale is deﬁned).
P2.3.3. Calculation of the Internal Energy

the important formula for the internal energy of a simple system

Carnot cycle for a simple system and plot it in the pV -coordinates. The work done by the system in one

P2.4.2. Deﬁnition of Entropy

for the integral

(P2.4.2.1)
To be precise, this relation deﬁnes the entropy difference between two states. If there is
no heat supply in an equilibrium process, entropy does not change; so an adiabatic process
can be called isentropic. For a simple system in an equilibrium process, the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics (P2.2.2.3) acquires the form
T dS = dU + p dV .
(P2.4.2.2)
Since δQ = T dS for any equilibrium process, it is convenient to plot equilibrium processes
and cycles in the TS-coordinates, where the area under the curve T(S) equals the quantity of
heat received. For example, a Carnot cycle is represented by a rectangle in TS-coordinates.

P2.4.3. Direction of Non-Equilibrium Processes in a Thermally
Insulated System
Consider a non-equilibrium process that takes a system from an equilibrium state 1 to an
equilibrium state 2. Let us set up a cyclic process by returning from 2 to 1 using any
equilibrium process. Writing down the Clausius inequality (P2.4.1.1) for this cycle and
taking into account the entropy deﬁnition (P2.4.2.1) for the equilibrium process, we get

MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
If the non-equilibrium process occurs in an adiabatic envelope, then the left-hand side
vanishes and then
S2 ≥S1,
(P2.4.3.2)
which means that entropy does not decrease in any process without heat supply.
The
equilibrium state of a thermally insulated system corresponds to the maximum of entropy.
◮Examples of non-equilibrium processes.
Example 1. Heat exchange. Consider heat exchange between two bodies having initial temperatures T1
and T2 and identical heat capacities C. From the heat balance equation it follows that the bodies will reach the
same equilibrium temperature Tf = 1
2 (T1 + T2). Moreover, according to (P2.4.2.3), the entropy change of the
system will be positive:

the argument of the logarithm is greater than one, since the arithmetic mean is greater than the geometric mean.
Example 2. Expansion of an ideal gas into a vacuum. The internal energy and, hence, temperature of
an ideal gas remain constant when it expands into a vacuum. The entropy change can be found from (P2.4.2.4):
S2 – S1 = νR ln

(P2.4.3.3)

proved for any simple system. If S in (P2.4.2.2) is treated as a function of U and V , then
 ∂S

U = p
T > 0.
Example 3. Gas mixing. Consider a thermally insulated container divided by a partition into two equal
compartments each containing one mole of an ideal gas under the same temperatures and pressures. When the
partition is removed, the gases mix with each other. As follows from (P2.4.3.3), the entropy of the system is
increased by 2R ln 2 (entropy of mixing). If the gases are different, the initial state of the system is different
from the ﬁnal state; the gases can be separated again by doing work on special pistons letting through only one
sort of molecules. However, if the gases are identical, the initial and ﬁnal states of the system are the same, and
hence the entropy must not change. The absence of a continuous transition when nearly identical molecules
are replaced by completely identical ones is called the Gibbs paradox.
P2.4.4. Statistical Meaning of Entropy
Boltzmann’s entropy formula relates the entropy S of a macroscopic state of a system to the
statistical weight W of this macrostate (or the number of microstates corresponding to the
given macrostate):
S = k ln W,
(P2.4.4.1)
where k is the Boltzmann constant.
The greater W, the higher the probability of the
macrostate; in non-equilibrium processes, the systems goes from less probable states to more
probable states. The logarithm provides for the additivity of entropy: the statistical weight
of a system consisting of two independent subsystems equals the product of their statistical
weights. (For more details about the statistical meaning of entropy, see Subsection P7.1.1.
Example. Identity of particles and the Gibbs paradox.
To illustrate the application of formula
(P2.4.4.1), let us calculate the spatial part of the entropy of an ideal gas.
Imagine that the whole vol-
ume V of the system is divided into small cells of volume v.
The corresponding number of indepen-
dent states equals W = (V/v)N, where N is the number of molecules in the gas.
Then the entropy is
S = k ln W = kN ln(V/v) = νR ln(V/v). Quantum statistics states that two identical particles are indistin-
guishable in principle, which means that W must be divided by the number of permutations N!. Finally, the
spatial part of the entropy becomes S = kN ln(V/Nv). It can be seen that this approach allows us to resolve
the Gibbs paradox.

P2.4.5. Third Law of Thermodynamics
The third law of thermodynamics (also known as Nernst’s theorem) states that as a system
approaches absolute zero, its entropy tends to a certain constant value independent of the
values of other thermodynamic parameters. The entropy of a system at T = 0 is commonly
taken to be zero. From the statistical viewpoint this is explained as follows: at T = 0, the
system is in its lowest energy state whose statistical weight is very low (close to 1) and,
by Boltzmann formula (P2.4.4.1), the entropy is negligibly small. It follows from this law
that as T →0, the heat capacities CV and Cp of the system as well as its thermal volume
expansion and pressure coefﬁcients, α and β, tend to zero.
P2.4.6. Thermodynamic Potentials
◮System in a thermostat. Consider a change in the state of a system that is in a thermal
contact with a thermostat having a constant temperature T. The system will have the same
temperature at its initial and ﬁnal equilibrium states. With T e = const and after a sequence
of transformations
Q/T ≤S2 – S1
=⇒
(U2 – U1) + A ≤TS2 – TS1,
inequality (P2.4.3.1) becomes
(U1 – TS1) – (U2 – TS2) ≥A
(P2.4.6.1)
◮Helmholtz free energy. With the new state variable
F = U – TS,
(P2.4.6.2)
called the Helmholtz free energy, inequality (P2.4.6.1) becomes
F1 – F2 ≥A.
If the volume of the system does not change in a non-equilibrium process, then
F2 ≤F1,
and so the free energy does not increase.
This fact can be rephrased as follows: an
equilibrium state of a system of constant volume that is in thermal contact with a thermostat
corresponds to the minimum of the free energy. For an equilibrium process, both inequalities
above become equalities.
If a system placed in a thermostat and having constant volume is used to produce some
“useful” work (e.g., by connecting internal moving parts of the system with external bodies),
then the maximum work done by the system as it passes from state 1 to state 2 is equal to
Amax = F1 – F2,
with the maximum work being done in a completely reversible equilibrium process. This
is why this thermodynamic function is called free energy.
From formulas (P2.4.6.2) and (P2.4.2.2) it follows that
dF = –S dT – p dV .
(P2.4.6.3)
Therefore, the natural variables to express free energy are volume and temperature: F =
F(V , T).

452
MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
◮Gibbs free energy. Suppose that a thermodynamic system is placed in a thermostat
and is in mechanical contact (e.g., through a light piston or a ﬂexible envelope) with
the environment that has a ﬁxed pressure p (the system will have the same pressure in
the equilibrium state). Then the work done by the system to change its volume equals
A = p(V2 – V1). From (P2.4.6.1) we get
F1 + pV1 ≥F2 + pV2
or
G1 ≥G2,
(P2.4.6.4)
with
G = F + pV = U – TS + pV .
(P2.4.6.5)
The new thermodynamic function G is called the Gibbs free energy. It does not increase
in non-equilibrium processes and remains constant in completely reversible equilibrium
processes. The minimum of G(p, T) corresponds to an equilibrium state. The maximum
“useful” work that the system can perform (i.e., the total work minus the work done to
change the volume of the system) equals
Amax = G1 – G2.
Since
dG = –S dT + V dp,
(P2.4.6.6)
the natural variables for the Gibbs free energy are pressure and temperature: G = G(p, T).
◮Chemical potential. If the pressure and temperature are kept constant, the Gibbs free
energy is proportional to the quantity of substance: G(p, T, m) = mg or G(p, T, N) = Nµ,
where g is the speciﬁc Gibbs free energy and µ is the thermodynamic potential per molecule,
or the chemical potential. (Sometimes, the chemical potential per mole is used.)
◮Canonic equations of state. Natural variables. Although the functions U, H, F,
and G, called thermodynamic potentials, can be expressed in terms of any independent
variables, there are so-called natural variables associated with each of them. These are
S and V for internal energy, S and p for enthalpy, V and T for Helmholtz free energy, and
p and T for the Gibbs free energy. Below are the deﬁnitions and the differentials of the
above functions listed together:
dU = T dS – p dV + µ dN;
H = U + pV ;
dH = T dS + V dp + µ dN;
F = U – TS;
dF = –S dT – p dV + µ dN;
G = U + pV – TS;
dG = –S dT + V dp + µ dN.
(P2.4.6.7)
Note that each differential has the additive term µ dN, which shows the dependence of each
function on the number of particles in the system. The expression of a thermodynamic
potential in terms of its natural variables is called a canonic equation of state.
Given
a canonic equation, one can obtain both the thermic, p = p(V , T), and caloric, U(V , T),
equations of state. For example, –

P2.5. Kinetic Theory of Ideal Gases
P2.5.1. The Basic Equation of the Kinetic Theory
◮Pressure of an ideal gas. From the viewpoint of kinetic-molecular theory, a gas is
considered ideal if the potential energy of interaction among its molecules is negligible
as compared to the kinetic energy and the molecule size is negligible as compared to the
average distance between the molecules. The pressure on the walls of the container results
from numerous elastic collisions of the molecules with them. (The collisions can be treated
as elastic, on the average, since the gas is in thermal equilibrium with the walls.) The basic
equation of the kinetic theory of an ideal gas expresses pressure in terms of the mean square
velocity of the molecules:
p = 1
3 n〈pv〉= 1
3 nm0〈v2〉= 2
3 n〈εtransl〉,
(P2.5.1.1)
where n = N/V is the number of molecules per unit volume, m0 is the mass of one molecule,
p = m0v is its momentum, and 〈εtransl〉= 〈1
2 m0v2〉is the mean kinetic energy of translational
motion of a molecule.
If the relation between energy and momentum is other than classical, then the expression
in (P2.5.1.1) is different. For example, |p| = ε/c for a photon (see Subsection P1.10.3). As
a result, pressure is expressed as
p = 1
3 n〈ε〉
(P2.5.1.2)
for a photon gas.

(P2.5.1.3)
Calculation formulas. Formulas for the transfer of the number of molecules, momentum, energy, etc.
through a small area are obtained by dividing molecules into groups and calculating the contribution of each
group. One of the most common approaches is to group molecules having nearly the same velocity, v. Consider
the group of molecules having velocity magnitudes in the range from v to v + dv in a solid angle dΩ. The
number of molecules in this group per unit volume equals dn(v, v + dv; dΩ) = dn(v, v + dv) dΩ/4π. In order
to ﬁnd how many molecules in this group pass through a plane region of area ∆S in time ∆t, we should
construct an oblique cylinder based on this region (Fig. P2.3) whose generatrix has the length v∆t and make an
angle θ with the x-axis. The molecules from the group concerned that belong to this cylinder only will reach
its base in time ∆t. Integrating ﬁrst with respect to angles (dΩ= sin θ dθ dϕ) and then with respect to v, one
can obtain formulas (P2.5.1.1), (P2.5.1.3), and others. For example, the energy transferred through area ∆S in
time ∆t is expressed as

P2.5.2. Temperature and Energy of an Ideal Gas
◮Temperature deﬁnition in kinetic theory of gases. It is proved in kinetic theory of
gases that if two subsystems (consisting of identical or different molecules) can exchange
energy, their mean kinetic energies of translational motion per molecule are equal to each
other in equilibrium. Based on this fact, kinetic theory of gases deﬁnes temperature as a
quantity proportional to the average kinetic energy of translational motion of molecules:
〈εtransl〉= 3
2 kT,
(P2.5.2.1)
where k is the Boltzmann constant. The proportionality coefﬁcient is chosen so that the
equation of state of an ideal gas,
p = nkT = N
V kT,
(P2.5.2.2)
obtained from the basic equation (P2.5.1.1) and the temperature deﬁnition (P2.5.2.1), coin-
cides with equation (P2.1.2.1), where the gas temperature scale is used.

P2.5. KINETIC THEORY OF IDEAL GASES

◮Root mean square velocity. Using (P2.5.1.1) and (P2.5.2.1), one can calculate the root
mean square velocity of translational motion of molecules:

(P2.5.2.3)
where ρ = m0n is the gas density.
◮Internal energy of an ideal gas. The number of degrees of freedom of a molecule, i, is
an important characteristic of an ideal gas. A monatomic molecule has only three degrees of
freedom; these correspond to translational motion in three spatial coordinates: i = itransl = 3.
A rigid diatomic molecule has two additional, rotational degrees of freedom, associated with
the rotation about two axes perpendicular to the axis of the molecule: i=itransl+irot =3+2=5.
A rigid multiatomic molecule (whose atoms are not collinear) has three rotational degrees of
freedom, and therefore i = 6. Classical statistical physics proves the equipartition theorem
(also known as law of equipartition). According to this theorem, an average energy of 1
2 kT
per molecule is associated with any degree of freedom to which there corresponds a term
like αx2 or β ˙x2 in the expression of the molecule energy. Formula (P2.5.2.1) is in complete
agreement with this theorem. Accordingly, the average energy per one molecule and the
total internal energy of the gas are expressed as
〈ε〉= 1
2 iphyskT,
U = N〈ε〉= 1
2 iphysνRT.
(P2.5.2.4)
The physical number of degrees of freedom, iphys, for rigid molecules coincides with the
mathematical one. However, at sufﬁciently high temperatures (T ∼103 K), when molecules
can no longer be treated as rigid and vibrational energy must be taken into account, an
average energy of kT will be associated with each vibrational degree of freedom. As a
result, the total number of degrees of freedom becomes iphys = itransl + irot + 2ivib, where ivib
is the mathematical number of vibrational degrees of freedom in a molecule. For an s-atom
molecule, ivib = 3s – (itransl + irot). In particular, for a nonrigid diatomic molecule, we have
ivib = 6 – (3 + 2) = 1 and iphys = 3 + 2 + 2 × 1 = 7.
◮Heat capacities of an ideal gas. Using (P2.5.2.4) and the deﬁnitions of heat capacities
at constant volume and constant pressure as well as adiabatic index (see Subsection P2.2.3),
we ﬁnd that
Cm
V = iphys
2 RT,
Cm
p = iphys + 2
2
RT,
γ = Cp
CV
= iphys + 2
iphys
.
(P2.5.2.5)
At room temperatures, the heat capacity follows the model of rigid molecules; the rotational degrees of
freedom are not excited, or, as is often said, “frozen.” However, at temperature increases to ∼103 K, the heat
capacity begins to increase, that is, vibrational degrees of freedom “unfreeze.” Furthermore, as temperature
decreases to several tens of kelvins, the rotational degrees of freedom “freeze out,” which results in decreasing
heat capacity. The phenomenon of freezing-out of degrees of freedom is explained by quantum mechanics: if
the average energy of thermal motion, kT, is small compared to the distance to the nearest discrete energy
level, the kind of motion concerned is not excited.
◮Mixture of ideal gases. Dalton’s law reads: the pressure of a mixture of ideal gases
equals the sum of their partial pressures. In particular, for two gases,
p = p1 + p2 = (n1 + n2)kT = (ν1 + ν2)RT.
The internal energy of a mixture equals the sum of the internal energies of its components:
U = 1
2 i1ν1RT + 1
2 i2ν2RT. This formula allows us to introduce the so-called effective
number of degrees of freedom, i(ν1 + ν2) = i1ν1 + i2ν2, effective molar heat capacity,
(ν1 + ν2)Cµ = ν1Cµ1 + ν2Cµ2, and effective molar mass, (ν1 + ν2)µ = ν1µ1 + ν2µ2.

P2.5.3. Maxwell’s Distribution
◮Deﬁnition and properties of distribution functions. The distribution of molecules
over their velocities is characterized by the following functions:
ϕ(vx) dvx = dn(vx, vx + dvx)
n
,
f(v) dv = dn(v, v + dv)
n
,
Φ(v) dvx dvy dvz = dn(vx, vx + dvx; vy, vy + dvy; vz, vz + dvz)
n
.
(P2.5.3.1)
The deﬁnition of each of the distribution functions is based on the assumption that the
fraction of molecules that fall (on the average) within a very small interval of a given
variable (e.g., velocity, its projection onto an axis, energy, etc.) is proportional to the width
of this interval. Note that dv denotes a physically very narrow, rather than mathematically
inﬁnitesimal, interval but wide enough to contain a large number of molecules. The mean
fraction of molecules having a certain property (e.g., having velocities within a given
interval) can be treated as the probability that an arbitrary molecule possesses this property.
Therefore, a distribution function is sometimes referred to as a probability density function.
Listed below are properties of a distribution function (exempliﬁed by f(v)).

The three distribution functions deﬁned in (P2.5.3.1) are related by
f(v) = Φ(v)4πv2,
Φ(vx, vy, vz) = ϕ(vx)ϕ(vy)ϕ(vz).
The function ϕ is even, and hence one can write ϕ = ϕ(v2
x). The function Φ(v) depends on
v2 = v2
x+v2

z only. The relation between Φ and ϕ is satisﬁed only if ϕ(vx) = A exp(–ζv2
x).
The coefﬁcients A and ζ are determined from two conditions: (a) the normality of ϕ and
(b) the requirement that 〈v2

The latter expression is referred to as Maxwell’s distribution (Fig. P2.4). The func-
tion f(v) attains its maximum at vmp = (2kT/m0)1/2, which is called the most probable
velocity. The value of f(v) at this point is f(vmp) = 4e–1(2πkT/m0)–1/2. For example, it

follows that if T increases by a factor of 4, the most probable velocity doubles and the value
of the function, f(vmp), is halved; note that the area under the curve f(v) is equal to one.

P2.6.1. Isotherms of a Real Gas
◮Low temperatures, T < Tc. If the gas temperature is less than the critical temper-
ature (see below), then the following processes occur in equilibrium isothermal volume
contraction (Fig. P2.5):
Figure P2.5. Isotherms of a real gas. ACB is the region of two-phase equilibrium.
1. Pressure increases to the point A. If temperature is well below the critical tempera-
ture, then the ideal gas law works well up to the point A.
2. Pressure does not change along AB. Some liquid emerges in the container; it is
separated from the gas by a clear interphase surface. A gas which is in thermodynamic
equilibrium with its liquid phase is called a saturated vapor. The liquid-to-gas mass ratio
at a point D on the segment AB equals the ratio between the lengths of the segments
AD and DB: mliq/mvap = AD/DB. The isotherm portions AL1 and L2B correspond to
metastable states, or states at which the system can remain for some time but then quickly
passes to a stable state on the segment AB. A gas and liquid in a metastable state are
called a supercooled vapor and superheated liquid (at constant pressure). The existence
of metastable states is accounted for by the fact that the formation of tiny nuclei of a new
phase (liquid in vapor or vapor in liquid) requires a considerable amount of energy, known
as surface energy (see Subsection P2.8.1).
3. After the point B, pressure sharply increases. There is only the liquid phase in the
container.

◮Critical temperature, T = Tc. The higher the temperature, the shorter the horizontal
portion of the isotherm. At some critical temperature, Tc, it reduces to a mere point, C, the
inﬂection point of the isotherm (Fig. P2.5). The pressure at the critical point is called the
critical pressure, pc, and the volume of a single mole of the gas is called the critical molar
volume, Vc.
◮High temperatures, T > Tc.
For higher temperatures, T > Tc, the isotherm is a
smooth monotonic curve. The region above the critical isotherm is called the true gas (it
cannot be isothermally transferred to a liquid + vapor state). The region below the critical
isotherm consists of three subregions: liquid, unsaturated vapor, and liquid + saturated
vapor. It is possible to pass (non-isothermally) from the vapor region to the liquid region
without entering the liquid + vapor region. So gas and liquid differ from each other by only
quantitative characteristics.


= RT.
(P2.6.2.1)
Note that equation (P2.1.2.2) from Section P2.1 for ν moles is obtained by substituting
Vµ = V/ν. The positive constant b reﬂects the fact that not all of the container volume is
available for the motion of molecules due to their own volume. This constant is taken to
be the total volume of all molecules multiplied by four: b = 4NA × 1
6 πd3, where d is the
diameter of a molecule. The term a/V 2
µ reﬂects the fact that the total pressure decreases
due to mutual interaction of molecules. This can be clearly seen from the expression of the
internal energy of a van der Waals gas: U = CµV T – a/Vµ.

MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
The average potential energy of interaction among the molecules is characterized by a model expression
containing two terms, ﬁrst corresponding to strong repulsion at small distances (∼10–10 m) and second
corresponding to van der Waals attractive forces at large distances (Fig. P2.6):
Ep = α
r12 – β
r6 .
The minimum of Ep corresponds to the average inter-molecule distance in the absence of thermal motion. For
kT ≪Emin, the motion of molecules reduces to vibrations about the bottom of the potential well (solid state).
The case kT ∼Emin corresponds to liquid state and the case kT ≫Emin corresponds to gaseous state. Since
the left branch of the potential curve, corresponding to repulsion, is nearly vertical, the minimum distance to
which molecules approach each other before rebounding is weakly dependent on their average translational
energy (see also Subsection P1.5.4).
Figure P2.6. Potential energy of interaction of molecules.
◮Van der Waals isotherms. Figure P2.7 depicts isotherms predicted by the van der
Waals equation (P2.6.2.1). At temperatures below the critical value, the isotherms have
two extrema, K1 and K2.
However, for the path AK1K2B of a subcritical isotherm,
the condition of mechanical stability, (∂p/∂V )T ≤0, is violated. In fact, the transition
between the points A and B occurs along a horizontal line. According to Maxwell’s rule,
the position of the segment AB is determined by the condition that shaded areas must be
equal. Otherwise, the isothermal cycle AK1K2BA would perform work, which contradicts
the second law of thermodynamics. The portions AK1 and K2B correspond to metastable
states.

The critical parameters satisfy the relation pcVc = 3

variables υ = V/Vc, π = p/pc, and θ = T/Tc, one can rewrite the van der Waals equation

This equation is the same for all gases. It follows that the van der Waals equation satisﬁes
the experimentally established principle of corresponding states. This principle asserts that
if two respective reduced state variables for two gases coincide, the third will also coincide.
This law is obeyed very well by most real gases.
P2.7. Phase Equilibrium. Phase Transitions
P2.7.1. Conditions for Phase Equilibrium
◮Phase.
A phase is a part of a system which is homogeneous in its physical and
chemical properties. The same substance can be in different phases, although its chemical
composition does not change. Examples of a two-phase system are: liquid+saturated vapor,
solid + liquid, and solid + vapor.
◮Three equilibrium conditions. For the phases of a system to be in equilibrium, the
following conditions must hold: (1) the pressures must be equal (mechanical equilibrium),
(2) the temperatures must be equal (thermal equilibrium), and (3) the chemical potentials
must be equal (equilibrium with respect to interphase transitions).
The last condition
corresponds to the minimum of the Gibbs free energy G = µ1N1 + µ2(N – N1) (see
Subsection P2.4.6) with respect to the number of molecules in one of the phases, N1.
For a simple system, the condition µ1(p, T) = µ2(p, T) determines the equation of the
two-phase coexistence curve p(T); a simple two-phase system has only one degree of
freedom. In particular, the pressure of a saturated vapor, determined by the horizontal
portion of the isotherm (see Subsection P2.6.1), is a single-valued function of temperature
(the evaporation–condensation curve). The same applies to the dependence of the melting
temperature on the external pressure (the melting–freezing curve) and also to the temperature
dependence of the vapor pressure over a solid surface (the sublimation–deposition curve).
◮Triple point. Figure P2.7 depicts a schematic phase diagram for water, which includes
the three phase-equilibrium curves: evaporation–condensation (I), melting–freezing (II),
and sublimation–deposition (III). The point of intersection of the three curves is called the
triple point (for water, T3 = 0.01◦C and p3 = 610.5 Pa). The conditions µvap(p, T) = µliq(p, T)
and µliq(p, T) = µsol(p, T) must hold simultaneously for a three-phase system to exist. The
pressure and temperature, identifying the triple point, are determined uniquely by these
conditions.

MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
P2.7.2. First-Order Phase Transitions
◮Transition heat and entropy. In order to transfer a portion of substance of mass m in a
two-phase system from one phase to the other, the quantity of heat Q = mq must be supplied
(or removed) in an equilibrium isobar-isothermal process. This quantity of heat Q is called
the phase transition heat or latent heat; the quantity q is the speciﬁc phase transition heat
or speciﬁc latent heat. When a substance changes to a new phase, its entropy changes by
∆S = Q/T = mq/T and the internal energy, by ∆U = mq – mp∆v, where v = V/m is the
speciﬁc volume. The quantity ∆s = q/T is called the speciﬁc entropy of the phase transition,
and ∆u = q – p∆v is the change in the speciﬁc internal energy at the phase transition.
A transition between phases in a two-phase system in which some heat is absorbed or
released and an abrupt change in internal energy, entropy, density, volume, etc. occurs is
called a ﬁrst-order phase transition. This name is due to the fact that the ﬁrst derivatives of
the Gibbs free energy, S = –(∂G/∂T)p and V = (∂G/∂p)T , experience a jump discontinuity.
◮Clausius–Clapeyron relation. If the temperature of a two-phase system is changed,
then its pressure will adapt so that the chemical potentials (or the speciﬁc Gibbs free
energies) of the phases remain the same: dg1 = dg2, or –s1 dT + v1 dp = –s2 dT + v2 dp (see
Subsection P2.4.6). It follows that the slope of the phase equilibrium curve equals
dp
dT = ∆s
∆v =
q
T∆v .
(P2.7.2.1)
This equation is referred to as the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.
Example 1. For the ice–water phase transition at atmospheric pressure, the melting temperature is 273 K,
q = 3.34 × 105 J/kg, and vw – vi = –0.91 × 10–4 m3/kg. Consequently dp/dT = –1.1 × 107 Pa/K. The minus
sign reﬂects the anomalous property of water: its density increases in melting.
Example 2. If heat is continuously supplied to a liquid, intensive evaporation begins across the whole
volume when the temperature attains the value at which the saturation vapor pressure equals the external
pressure. This process is called boiling. Equation (P2.7.2.1) determines the dependence between the boiling
temperature and external pressure. Neglecting the speciﬁc volume of the liquid and expressing the speciﬁc
volume of the vapor from the ideal gas law v = RT
µp , we arrive at the approximate equation dp
dT = µqp
RT 2 .
In particular, for water (µ = 18 g/mol) at atmospheric pressure (p = 105 Pa), we have the boiling temperature
T = 373 K and the speciﬁc latent heat of evaporation q = 2.26 × 106 J/kg. If follows that dp
dT = 3.5 × 103 Pa/K.
◮Second-order phase transitions. In a second-order phase transition, density, internal
energy, and entropy (the ﬁrst derivatives of the Gibbs free energy) are changed continu-
ously, while the various derivatives of these thermodynamic functions (such as heat capacity,
compressibility, dielectric constant, magnetic permeability, etc.) experience a jump discon-
tinuity or show critical behavior (tend to inﬁnity when approaching the transition point).
The name is due to the fact that the second derivatives of the Gibbs free energy experi-
ence a discontinuity. Examples of such transitions are the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic
transition at the Curie point, transition of liquid helium to the superconducting state, super-
ﬂuid transitions, etc. A second-order phase transition occurs at the whole volume at once
and is associated with a qualitative change in the internal structure (such as appearance of
additional symmetries or loss of some symmetries).
P2.8. Surface Tension
P2.8.1. Surface Energy
◮Surface tension coefﬁcient. Molecules at the surface of a liquid possess higher potential
energy as compared to molecules in the bulk, since the former have fewer “neighbors,” the

energy of interaction with which is negative (see Fig. P2.6). At constant temperature, the
additional energy is proportional to the surface area, Σ:
Fsurf = σ(T)Σ,
(P2.8.1.1)
where σ is the surface free energy per unit area, called the surface tension coefﬁcient.
In an equilibrium isothermal change of a rectangular area on the surface, the work
done by external forces equals the change in the Helmholtz free energy (P2.4.6.2). So
A = ∆Fsurf = σ∆Σ = σLx, where L is the rectangle side and x is its displacement. It
follows that a surface tension force acts on the rectangle side which is perpendicular to the
side and tangent to the liquid surface:
fsurf = σL.
(P2.8.1.2)
In equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy is minimum and, hence, a liquid of a liquid ﬁlm
tend to minimize their surface. For example, a drop of liquid tends to a spherical shape at
zero gravity.
◮Thermodynamics of surface layer. Since Fsurf is a function of T and Σ, then dFsurf =
σ dΣ + Σ dσ
dT dT. It follows, taking into account (P2.4.6.3), that the surface layer entropy
and internal energy as well as the heat absorbed by the layer under isothermal area extension
are expressed as
S = – dσ

U = F + TS =

δQ = T dS = –T dσ
dT dΣ.
With increasing temperature T, the surface tension coefﬁcient σ decreases and vanishes at
a critical temperature.
P2.8.2. Additional Pressure Under a Curved Surface
◮Spherical surface. It follows from the condition of mechanical equilibrium of the
surface layer that the pressure inside a convex surface must be higher than outside. For
a spherical surface of radius R, the additional pressure, ∆p, can be found by increasing
its radius by dR and equating the work done by external forces with the change in the
Helmholtz energy: ∆p dV = σ dΣ and hence ∆p d( 4
3 πR3) = σ d(4πR2). Finally, we have
∆p = 2σ
R .

where R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature of the surface (i.e., the minimum and
maximum radii of curvature of the curves obtained by cutting the surface with two mutually
perpendicular planes at a given point). Relation (P2.8.2.1) is called the Young–Laplace
formula or Young–Laplace equation.

MOLECULAR PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS
P2.8.3. Wetting. Capillary Effects
◮Contact angle.
When a liquid and solid are in contact with each other and both
are in a gas environment, the liquid surface (liquid–gas interface) and the solid surface
(solid–gas interface) meet at an angle, which is called the contact angle. The value of
the contact angle, θ, depends on the surface tension coefﬁcients at the liquid–gas (σliq–gas),
liquid–solid (σliq–sol), and solid–gas (σsol–gas) interfaces.
It follows from the condition
of mechanical equilibrium at the line where the three phases meet (see Fig. P2.8) that
σsol–gas = σliq–sol + σliq–gas cos θ (per unit length). Hence,
cos θ = σsol–gas – σliq–sol
σliq–gas
.
If 0 < cos θ < 1, or 0 < θ < 90◦, the liquid is said to wet the solid surface. If –1 < cos θ ≤0,
or 90◦≤θ < 180◦, it is said that the liquid does not wet the surface. If the right-hand side of
the equation is greater than or equal to 1 (θ = 0), the liquid forms a thin molecular ﬁlm of
the solid surface (this phenomenon is known as perfect wetting); in a container, the liquid
makes a zero angle with the solid wall. If the right-hand side of the equation is less than or
equal to –1 (θ = 180◦), this situation is known as perfect non-wetting.
Figure P2.8. Contact angle.
◮Capillary effects. If one end of a thin, capillary tube is immersed in a wetting liquid,
the liquid will go up the capillary and reach a height h. This height is determined by the
mechanical equilibrium condition.
If there is a capillary tube with inner radius r and the radius of curvature of the liquid
meniscus is R = r/ cos θ, the pressure under the meniscus (see (P2.8.2.1)) must be less than
atmospheric pressure by the value 2σ/R = 2σ cos θ/r. Equating the pressure difference
with ρgh, we ﬁnd the height of the liquid column: h = 2σ cos θ
ρgr
.
P2.9. Transfer Phenomena in Gases
P2.9.1. Collision of Molecules in a Gas

per unit time (collision frequency) with other molecules is equal to
z = nσ〈v〉
√
2,
(P2.9.1.1)
where n is the molecule concentration, 〈v〉is the average speed of the molecules, and σ is the
effective cross-section of elastic collisions. If the molecules are modeled as identical rigid
balls of diameter d, we have σ = πd2. The factor
√
2 accounts for the motion of oncoming
molecules; this factor is usually omitted in the qualitative theory of transfer phenomena.

P2.9. TRANSFER PHENOMENA IN GASES

In order to estimate the collision frequency, the polygonal path of a molecule is usually surrounded by a
tube of radius d. The moving molecule will collide with any resting molecule whose center is inside the tube.
In a unit time, the molecule travels the distance 〈v〉, the corresponding tube volume equals πd2〈v〉, and the
number of molecules in the tube is z = πd2〈v〉n.

(P2.9.1.3)
Effective cross-section. The effective cross-section of an interparticle collision process (with respect to
a result of interest, such as scattering within a given solid angle, particle absorption, etc.) is determined as
follows. Consider a ﬁxed molecule (a scattering center) and an incident beam of molecules with ﬂux I = nv
(the number of particles passing through a unit area per unit time, with the area perpendicular to the velocity
vector). The effective cross-section of a process is the ratio between the number of collisions per unit time that
have led to the desired result, ∆N, and the incident ﬂux:
σ = ∆N/I.
(P2.9.1.4)
The attenuation of the molecule beam traveling through a gas over a distance dx equals
dI = –Iσn dx = –(I/λ) dx,
where σ is the cross-section of elastic scattering, n dx is the number of scattering centers along the path dx
(per unit area), and λ = 1/(nσ). Integrating yields the incident ﬂux as a function of the distance traveled:
I = I0 exp(–nσx) = I0 exp(–x/λ).
(P2.9.1.5)
It follows that the probability for a molecule to experience a collision on the interval (x, x + dx) is |dI|/I0 =
exp(–x/λ) d(x/λ). The mean distance traveled by a molecule to the ﬁrst collision equals

P2.9.2. Qualitative Model of Transfer Phenomena in Gases
The phenomena of viscosity, heat conduction, and diffusion are accounted for by the transfer
of linear momentum, energy, and concentration due to chaotic thermal motion.
◮Viscosity.
Fourier’s law. Viscosity is the appearance of frictional forces between
parallel gas layers as they move relative to each other. If the directed ﬂow velocity, u, is
parallel to the x-axis and only changes in the y-direction (Fig. P2.9), then a resistive force
arises which is proportional to the area and the velocity gradient:
|Fx| = ηS du
dy ,
(P2.9.2.1)
where η is the coefﬁcient of viscosity (or simply the viscosity). Equation (P2.9.2.1) is known
as Fourier’s law. The appearance of the resistive force is associated with the transfer of
the momentum px along the y-axis by the molecules crossing the contact area due to their
thermal motion. The force per unit area equals the momentum ﬂux density.

Figure P2.9. A frictional force arises between adjacent gas layers having different relative velocities.
◮Heat conduction. Newton’s law of cooling. If the gas temperature rather than the
directed ﬂow velocity changes along the y-axis, then the local heat ﬂux density in the
y-direction is expressed as
q = –κ dT
dy ,
(P2.9.2.2)
where κ is the thermal conductivity. This equation is known as Newton’s law of cooling.
◮Diffusion. Fick’s law. If the concentration of selected gas molecules, n1, changes along
the y-axis (the total concentration n must be constant), then the ﬂux density of the selected
molecules, j, in the y-direction is given by
j = –D dn1
dy ,
(P2.9.2.3)
where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient (or diffusivity). This equation is known as Fick’s law of
diffusion. The quantity j is called the diffusion ﬂux density.
◮Flux calculation formulas. Let g(y) denote a quantity whose transfer along the y-
axis is of interest. Examples of such a quantity are the momentum of directed motion,
g(y) = m0u(y), for viscosity, the mean energy of thermal motion, g(y) = 〈ε〉= cV m0T
(cV is the speciﬁc heat capacity at constant volume), for heat conduction, and the relative
concentration of selected molecules, g(y) = n1(y)/n, for diffusion. Let us assume that each
molecule transfers a certain (average) amount of the quantity g through a given surface; this
amount of g was acquired by the molecule at its latest collision. Then the ﬂux density of g
in the y-direction can be calculated using the formula
G = – 1
3 n〈v〉λ dg
dy .
(P2.9.2.4)
For rough estimates, it can be assumed that the particles move with velocity 〈v〉in one
of the six directions determined by the coordinate axes. Then the particle ﬂux through a
unit area is equal to n〈v〉. It can also be assumed that the particles crossing the area the
y-level experienced their latest collision at an average distance λ (Fig. P2.9). Then we have
G ≈1
6 n〈v〉[g(y – λ) – g(y + λ)], and hence G ≈1
3 n〈v〉λ(dg/dy).
◮Formulas for transfer coefﬁcients in a gas.
1. Substituting g = m0vx into (P2.9.2.4), gives the momentum ﬂux, which is equal to
the frictional force (P2.9.2.1) for a unit area. Then the coefﬁcient of viscosity is expressed
as
η = 1

3 ρ〈v〉λ.

(P2.9.2.7)
There are two important conclusions that can be drawn from formulas (P2.9.2.5)–
(P2.9.2.7):
1) The mean free path is inversely proportional to ρ, which can be seen from equation
(P2.9.1.2); hence, the viscosity and thermal conductivity of gases at a given ﬁxed temper-
ature are pressure independent (Maxwell’s law). This conclusion holds true as long as the
mean free path is small compared to the container size.
2) The ratio between the viscosity and the thermal conductivity is temperature inde-
pendent.
◮Extremely rareﬁed gas. When the mean free path becomes commensurable with the
container size (rareﬁed gas), the viscosity and thermal conductivity begin to depend on
density. For example, consider the heat transfer between two walls having temperatures T1
and T2 and separated by a distance d ≪λ (extremely rareﬁed gas). It can be assumed that,
after its collision with the wall having the temperature T1, each molecule acquires (on the
average) the energy cV m0T1, then ﬂies without collisions to the opposite wall and gives
up the energy cV m0(T2 – T1). It follows from (P2.5.1.3) that the number of molecules
reaching the wall in time ∆t is equal to 1
4 n〈v〉S∆t. Consequently, q = 1
4 ρ〈v〉cV ∆T, and
hence κ = 1
4 ρ〈v〉cV d.

Electrodynamics
P3.1. Electric Charge. Coulomb’s Law
P3.1.1. Electric Charge and Its Properties
◮Electric charge is a scalar physical quantity that determines the electromagnetic inter-
action of subatomic particles. In SI, the unit of charge is the coulomb (C); it is deﬁned in
terms of the unit of electric current, the ampere (A): 1 C = 1 A s.
Properties of electric charge:
1. The carriers of electric charge are many subatomic particles such as protons and
electrons (as well as antiprotons and positrons) and some metastable particles as π-mesons,
K-mesons, muons, etc. Charged particles interact with each other with forces that decay
with the distance as slowly as gravitational forces but are much stronger in magnitude.
2. Proton and electron and many other charged subatomic particles have the same
electric charge in magnitude. This charge is called the elementary charge and denoted e.
In SI, e = 1.602 × 10–19 C. As experiments have shown, the charge of subatomic particles is
independent of their velocity.
3. The charge of subatomic particles can be either positive or negative. Particles with
like charges repel one another and particles with unlike charges attract. By convention, the
charge of a proton is positive (+e) and the charge of an electron is negative (–e).
If a macroscopic body includes different numbers of electrons, Ne, and protons, Np, the
body is charged and its charge is always multiple of the elementary charge: q = e(Np –Ne).
◮Law of conservation of electric charge. A system is called electrically closed if it
does not exchange charges with external bodies, which means that charges do not cross its
boundary. The total charge of an electrically closed system, or the algebraic sum of all its
charges, remains constant. This statement is obvious if there are no elementary particle
reactions. However, the law of conservation of charge is fundamental—it holds even if
charged particles are created or destroyed.
◮Charge distribution. The spatial distribution of charge is characterized by its volume
density ρ(r), measured in C/m3, surface density σ(r), measured in C/m2, and linear
density λ(r), measured in C/m. We have
dq = ρ dV ,
dq = σ dS,
dq = λ dl.
(P3.1.1.1)
◮Dipole. Dipole moment. A system of charges is called electrically neutral if its net
charge is zero. An electric dipole is a simple example of an electrically neutral system;
it consists of two point charges, q and –q, separated by a distance l. The electric dipole
moment is a vector quantity deﬁned as
p = ql,
(P3.1.1.2)
where l = r+ – r– is the displacement vector from the charge –q to the charge q. The dipole
moment is measured in C m.

ELECTRODYNAMICS
The following deﬁnition is a generalization to the case of an electrically neutral system:
p =
X
i
qiri = q(r+ – r–),
where q = P
qi>0 qi is the sum of all positive charges, r+ = P
qi>0 qiri/q is the center of
positive charges, and r– = – P
qi<0 qiri/q is the center of negative charges.
P3.1.2. Coulomb’s Law
Coulomb’s law describes the electrostatic interaction of point charges, i.e., charged particles
and bodies whose dimensions can be neglected as compared to the distances between them.
Coulomb’s law states that, in vacuum, the electrostatic force, F, acting on a point charge q1
due to the presence of a point charge q2 is directly proportional to each of the charges and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between them:
F = k |q1| |q2|
r2
,
(P3.1.2.1)
where k is the proportionality coefﬁcient, dependent on the unit system chosen. The force
is directed along the straight line connecting the point charges; like charges repel and unlike
charges attract.
In SI, the coefﬁcient in (P3.1.2.1) equals k = 9.0 × 109 N m2/C2. Also k = 1/(4πε0),
where ε0 = 8.85 × 10–12 F/m is the electric constant. In Gaussian units (CGS system), k is
taken to be equal to one and the unit of charge is deﬁned by Coulomb’s law.
The electrostatic force acting on a charge q due to the presence of many point charges,
Q1, Q2, . . . , equals the linear vector superposition of forces
F =
X
i
k

(r – ri)2
r – ri
|r – ri| ,
(P3.1.2.2)
where r is the position vector of the charge q and ri is the position vector of the charge Qi
(i = 1, 2, . . . ).
◮On unit conventions in electrostatics. In what follows, all formulas will be given in
SI. To convert to Gaussian units (CGS system), it will be sufﬁcient to set k = 1 in most
cases; if a formula contains ε0, one should ﬁrst replace ε0 with 1/(4πk).
P3.2. Electric Field. Strength and Potential
P3.2.1. Strength of Electric Field
◮Electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The interaction between charged particles is implemented
through electromagnetic ﬁeld. This means that: (a) a charged particle generates an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in the surrounding space and (b) the electromagnetic ﬁeld exerts a force on
other charged particles. The ﬁeld generated by a point charge is proportional to its charge;
the force exerted by the ﬁeld on a particle is proportional to the charge of this particle.
◮Electric ﬁeld. An electromagnetic ﬁeld is a combination of an electric ﬁeld and a
magnetic ﬁeld, which are closely related to each other. The action of an electric ﬁeld on a
charged particle does not depend on the particle velocity and that of a magnetic ﬁeld does.
The sources of electric ﬁelds are any charged particles, while magnetic ﬁelds are generated
by moving charges. The proportion between electric and magnetic ﬁelds changes when
passing from one inertial frame to another. The properties of electric and magnetic ﬁelds
are completely determined by Maxwell’s equations (see Subsection P3.11.1). Maxwell’s
equations are invariant under relativistic, Lorentz transformations.

P3.2. ELECTRIC FIELD. STRENGTH AND POTENTIAL
471
◮Test charge. Strength of an electric ﬁeld. The characteristics of an electromagnetic
ﬁeld are studied using the concept of a test charged particle, which is an idealized small
object whose dimensions and charge are small enough so that, when placed into a ﬁeld of
interest, it does not distort the ﬁeld (does not change the positions of the ﬁeld sources). The
force acting on a stationary test particle of charge q is proportional to the charge and is only
determined by the electric ﬁeld:
Fq = qE.
(P3.2.1.1)
This formula deﬁnes the strength of an electric ﬁeld, E. It also answers the question what
force the ﬁeld exerts on any charge q, moving or stationary. In SI, the strength of an electric
ﬁeld is measured in N/C or V/m. For brevity, the term electric ﬁeld is used to mean the
strength of an electric ﬁeld whenever this does not lead to confusion.
◮Electrostatic ﬁeld. Principle of superposition. A stationary electric ﬁeld generated by
a system of stationary charges is called an electrostatic ﬁeld. The strength of an electrostatic
ﬁeld can be determined using Coulomb’s law (P3.1.2.2).
1. Electric ﬁeld of a point charge. If a point charge q is placed in the ﬁeld of a point
charge Q, then it follows from (P3.1.2.2) and (P3.2.1.1) that
E = k Q

r
r = Er
r

(P3.2.1.2)
where Er is the projection of E onto the radial direction.

get
E = E1 + E2 + · · · =
X
i

(r – ri)2
r – ri
|r – ri| .
(P3.2.1.3)
For a continuously distributed charge, the summation must be replaced by integration (see
(P3.1.1.1)). (Compare with the formulas for the gravitational ﬁeld in Subsection P1.7.2.)
Example 1. There is a charge continuously distributed along an arc of a circle of radius R with a linear
density λ (Fig. P3.1). The arc angle is 2α0. Find the strength of the electric ﬁeld generated by the charge, at
the circle center.
Figure P3.1. Strength of the electric ﬁeld generated by a charged arc of a circle.
Solution. By symmetry, the ﬁeld strength is directed along the y-axis, which passes through the midpoint
of the arc and the circle center O. The strength of the ﬁeld generated by the arc element dα at O equals
dE = k dq/R2, where dq = λR dα. Projecting onto y and integrating yields

Figure P3.2. Strength of the electric ﬁeld generated by a charged segment.
Example 2. Field of a segment. A charge is evenly distributed along a segment with a linear density λ.
Find the ﬁeld strength at the point A whose position is determined by the distance y to the straight line of the
segment and two angles α1 and α2 as shown in Fig. P3.2.
Solution. The contribution of the element dx to the ﬁeld strength at A equals dE = kλ dx/r2, where
r is the distance from dx to A. The respective projections on the x- and y-axes are dE cos α and dE sin α.
It is convenient to integrate with respect to the angle α. Substituting r = y/sin α and x = –y cot α, with
dx = y dα/sin2 α, and integrating, we obtain the following expressions of Ex and Ey:
Ex = k λ
y (sin α2 – sin α1),
Ey = k λ
y (cos α1 – cos α2).
If α1 = π – α2 = α (the point A lies on the straight line perpendicular to the segment through its midpoint), then
Ex = 0 and Ey = 2kλ cos α/y. If α →0 (the segment becomes a straight line), then Ey = 2kλ/y. If α1 = 0
and α2 = π/2 (a ray), then Ex = Ey = kλ/y.
P3.2.2. Potential of an Electrostatic Field
◮Deﬁnition of potential. An electrostatic ﬁeld is potential (see Subsection P1.5.3) just
as any static central ﬁeld. This means that the work done by the ﬁeld to move a test charge
from one point in space to another is independent of the path. This allows us to deﬁne the
potential of an electrostatic ﬁeld, ϕ(r). We have
Aq(1 →2) = Wq(r1) – Wq(r2) = q

ϕ(r1) – ϕ(r2)

,
(P3.2.2.1)
where Aq(1 →2) is the work done by the ﬁeld to transfer the charge q from point r1
to point r2, Wq(r) = qϕ(r) is the potential energy of the charge in the electrostatic ﬁeld
(throughout this chapter, energy will be denoted by W). The scalar quantity ϕ(r1)–ϕ(r2) is
called the potential difference between points r1 and r2. For Wq(r) and ϕ(r) to be uniquely
deﬁned, one has to choose a point where they are zero. In SI, potential is measure in
volts (V).
◮Relation between ﬁeld strength and potential. Given the ﬁeld strength E(r), one can
determine the potential difference and potentials as
ϕ(r1) – ϕ(r2) =
Z r2
r1
E dr,
ϕ(r) =
Z r0
r
E dr,
(P3.2.2.2)
where r0 is the reference point where the potential is taken to be zero. Given the poten-
tial ϕ(r), one can ﬁnd the projection of the ﬁeld strength onto any direction l (based on
(P3.2.2.2) for two close points):
El = – ∂ϕ
∂l .
(P3.2.2.3)
Consequently, we can ﬁnd the ﬁeld strength vector:
E = – grad ϕ = –

i ∂ϕ
∂x + j ∂ϕ

(P3.2.2.4)
where i, j, and k are the unit vectors of the respective coordinate axes.

Usually, the potential is taken to be zero at inﬁnity. In this case,

r .
(P3.2.2.5)
2. The potential of the ﬁeld of a system of point charges equals the algebraic sum of the
potentials of individual charges (principle of superposition for potential):

In the limit R →∞, we arrive at the ﬁeld strength of a plane: Ex = 2πkσ = σ/(2ε0).
Example 2. Field of a dipole. Find the potential and ﬁeld strength far away from a dipole shown in
Fig. P3.4.

and p = ql (see Subsection P3.1.1).

(P3.2.2.7)

Subsection P3.1.1) at large distances.

This energy changes if the dipole is turned by an angle—the ﬁeld exerts a rotational moment

M = l × (qE) = p × E,
(P3.2.2.9)

P3.3. Gauss’s Theorem
P3.3.1. Statement of the Theorem
◮Flux of electric ﬁeld. The ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld E through a plane area element ds
is deﬁned as
dΦ = (E ⋅ds) = Ends = E cos θ ds,
(P3.3.1.1)
where ds = n ds, n is a normal vector to the plane, θ is the angle between E and n,
En = E cos θ is the projection of E onto the normal n. The sign of dΦ depends on how the
normal direction is chosen. The ﬂux of the ﬁeld E through a ﬁnite surface S is determined
as
Φ =
Z
S
En ds.
(P3.3.1.2)
If the surface is closed, the normal is taken to point outward.
Flux additivity: if an electrostatic ﬁeld is a superposition of several ﬁelds, E(r) = P
i Ei,
then Φ = P
i Φi for any surface.
The ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld generated by point charge Q through an area ds is
dΦ = Er cos θ ds = ±k Q
r2 ds⊥= ±kQ dΩ,

P3.3. GAUSS’S THEOREM
475
where ds⊥= |ds cos θ| is the projection of ds onto the plane perpendicular to r, and
dΩ= ds⊥/r2 is the solid angle at which the area ds is seen from the charge Q. The plus
sign corresponds to an acute angle between n and r, and the minus sign corresponds to an
obtuse angle. The ﬁeld ﬂux through a closed surface is equal to 4πkQ if the charge is inside
the surface, and zero if it is outside.
◮Gauss’s theorem. The ﬂux of an electrostatic ﬁeld through a closed surface is only
determined by the net charge, qenc, enclosed within the surface:
Φ = 4πkqenc = q
ε0
.
(P3.3.1.3)
◮Gauss’s theorem and electric ﬁeld lines. Electric ﬁeld lines are useful to visualize
electric ﬁelds. These are drawn using the following rules: (a) the tangent to a ﬁeld line
is directed along the vector E at every point in space and (b) the density of ﬁeld lines
is proportional to the magnitude of the ﬁeld at point of interest. The ﬁeld ﬂux through
a surface is proportional to the number of ﬁeld lines piercing the surface. (Lines of any
vector ﬁeld can be introduced likewise.) Gauss’s theorem implies that the electric ﬁeld lines
must start and ﬁnish at charges and also they must be continuous in an empty space. It is
noteworthy that Gauss’s theorem and continuity of ﬁeld lines are corollaries of the fact that
the Coulomb force decays with distance as 1/r2.
Apart from ﬁeld lines, equipotential surfaces are also used for visualization of electric
ﬁelds. Equipotential surfaces are everywhere perpendicular to ﬁeld lines (the work done by
the ﬁeld to transfer a test charge along such a surface must be zero).
P3.3.2. Application of Gauss’s Theorem
◮Calculatingthe ﬁeld usingGauss’s theorem. Suppose, from symmetryconsiderations,
it is possible to construct an imaginary surface such that E is perpendicular to it and constant
in magnitude on some part of the surface and is parallel to the surface (E ⊥n) on the other
part. Such a surface is called a Gaussian surface. Gauss’s theorem can be applied to this
surface to ﬁnd the ﬁeld magnitude E.
Example 1. Field of a charged string. Find the electric ﬁeld generated by an inﬁnitely long, evenly
charged straight string (Fig. P3.5).
Figure P3.5. To the calculation of the electric ﬁeld generated by an inﬁnite string using Gauss’s theorem.
Solution. The electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the string at any point in space. The ﬁeld magnitude Er is
only dependent on the distance r to the string. Evidently, any cylinder of radius r with generatrix of length l
and the axis lying on the string, can be taken as a Gaussian surface. Writing Gauss’s theorem (P3.3.1.2), we
ﬁnd
Er 2πrl = λl

Example 2. Field of a charged plane. Find the electric ﬁeld generated by an evenly charged plane

Solution. The ﬁeld is everywhere perpendicular to the plane and Ex is only dependent on the distance
to the plane. A right cylinder whose bases of area S are symmetric with respect to the plane can be taken as
a Gaussian surface. The ﬁeld ﬂux through this surface equals Ex(x)S – Ex(–x)S = 2ExS. Writing Gauss’s
theorem, we ﬁnd that
2ExS = σS
ε0
=⇒
Ex(x) = –Ex(–x) =
σ
2ε0
(see example 1 from Subsection P3.2.2). Taking ϕ = 0 at x = 0, we have ϕ(x) =
σ
2ε0 |x|.
Example 3. Field of a charged ball. Find the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly charged ball of radius R with
charge q.
Solution. The ﬁeld of a uniformly charged ball is a central ﬁeld. A concentric sphere of radius r can
be taken as a Gaussian surface. If r > R, then the surface encloses the entire ball and so qenc = q. Hence,
Er 4πr2 = q/ε0. If r < R, then qenc = qr3/R3 and hence Er 4πr2 = qr3/(ε0R3). Finally, we have

The unknown constant is determined from the continuity condition for the potential at the ball surface.
◮Earnshaw’s theorem. Earnshaw’s theorem is a corollary of Gauss’s theorem. It states
that a charged particle in vacuum cannot be in a stable equilibrium under the action of
electric forces only. Indeed, if this were the case, the electric ﬁelds generated by the other
charges would all have to point inward a small sphere enclosing the particle (if its charge
is positive). But this would contradict Gauss’s theorem (all other charges are outside the
sphere).
◮Maxwell’s equations in electrostatics. The condition that an electrostatic ﬁeld must
be potential,
I
E ⋅dr = 0
=⇒
curl E = 0,
is one of Maxwell’s equations (in integral and differential forms) written for the special

P3.4. Conductors and Capacitors
P3.4.1. Electrostatics of Conductors
◮Field in a conductor. The potential of a conductor. A conductor is a material that
is capable of carrying electric current. To this end, the material must contain movable
electric charges that can travel across. Electrostatics deals with states where charges are at
equilibrium, when there is no directed motion of charged particles—electric current. This
means that the electric ﬁeld must be zero everywhere within the conductor. It follows that:
1. The potential of all point within the conduction has the same value, which is called
the potential of the conductor.
2. The conductor surface is an equipotential surface. The electric ﬁeld lines are per-
pendicular to it.
3. The volume charge density in the conductor is zero (it follows from Gauss’s theorem
that it must be zero charge in any volume within the conductor).
The uncompensated
charges must be distributed on the surface.
4. The electric ﬁeld near the conductor surface is related to the local surface charge
density σ by
E = σ
ε0
.
(P3.4.1.1)
This formula can be obtained from Gauss’s theorem (P3.3.1.3) by taking as a Gaussian surface a small
cylinder whose one base is outside the conductor but near its surface and the other is inside. Then we get
ES = σS/ε0.
◮Isolated conductor. The potential of an isolated conductor is proportional to its charge:
ϕ = 1
C q,
(P3.4.1.2)
where C is the capacitance of the conductor; it depends on the shape and size of the
conductor and the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. In SI, the unit of
capacitance is the farad (F). In CGS, capacitance is measured in centimeters (cm). For
example, the potential and capacitance of an isolated ball of radius R equal
ϕ =
1
4πε0
q
R ,
C = 4πε0R.
(P3.4.1.3)
◮Connection of conductors.
When two conductors having different potentials are
connected to each other with a conducting wire, their potentials become equal.
If the
conductors are sufﬁciently far away from each other, their individual potentials can be
calculated as the potential of an isolated conductor. Then the law of conservation of electric
charge allows us to ﬁnd the resulting common potential, ϕ′:
C1ϕ1 + C2ϕ2 = C1ϕ′ + C2ϕ′
=⇒
ϕ′ = C1ϕ1 + C2ϕ2
C1 + C2
(the capacitance of the wire and its charge may be neglected). If the capacitance of one
conductor is much larger than that of the other, its potential remains almost unchanged.
For example, if a conductor is connected to the earth (it is said to be earthed), its potential
becomes equal to the Earth’s potential, which is constant and usually taken to be zero.

478
ELECTRODYNAMICS
◮Conductor in an external electric ﬁeld. When any conductor is placed in an external
electric ﬁeld, its movable charges redistribute so that the resulting ﬁeld (superposition of the
external and internal ﬁelds) within the conductor is zero. For example, if a positive point
charge is brought near an uncharged conductor, then negative charges will gather on the side
that is closer to the charge and positive charges will move to the side that is further away.
As a result, the charge and conductor will attract. (This phenomenon is called electrostatic
induction.) Since the charge distribution on the conductor surface is usually unknown,
the principle of superposition becomes unsuitable for the calculation of the resulting ﬁeld.
Sometimes, the problem may be solved by indirect techniques.

distance a compared to the conductor size. In this case, the conductor can be replaced by an inﬁnite conducting
half-space (Fig. P3.7). There will be induced negative charges at the plane surface. It is required to ﬁnd the
ﬁeld Epl produced by these charges at any point of the free space. Note that the charge distribution is unknown!
To begin with, let us ﬁnd the ﬁeld Epl inside the conductor at the point symmetric to an outside point of
interest. The ﬁeld Epl will compensate the ﬁeld produced by the charge q at this point. Hence, the ﬁeld Epl
inside will exactly coincide with that generated by an imaginary charge –q placed at the same point as q. Now
we see that the ﬁeld Epl produced by the surface charges of the conductor is symmetric relative to the plane.
Consequently, Epl outside will exactly coincide with the ﬁeld produced by the imaginary charge –q placed
symmetrically relative to the charge q. This symmetric charge is called the image of the charge q and the
method is known as the electrostatic image method. It is now fairly easy to ﬁnd: (a) the attractive force between
the charge and the conductor, F = kq2/(2a)2, (b) the electric ﬁeld everywhere outside the conductor (it is equal
to the ﬁeld produced by the charge q and its image –q), and (c) the charge distribution of the surface—once the
ﬁeld near the surface is known, we can ﬁnd the charge density σ using formula (P3.4.1.1).
◮Principle of uniqueness. The principle of uniqueness is useful in solving problems with
unknown charge distribution. This principle states that for a system of conductors, there
exists a unique surface charge distribution and a unique ﬁeld E(r) such that the net ﬁelds
inside the conductors vanish and their potentials and charges acquire prescribed values. If
one guesses a charge distribution or a ﬁeld conﬁguration that satisﬁes the above conditions,
it will be the correct solution. For example, one can notice that the equipotential surface
ϕ = 0 of the ﬁeld produced by two charges, q and –q, coincides with their symmetry
plane (see Fig. P3.7). Then it can be inferred that the ﬁelds produced by the charge q and
it image –q coincides with that produced by the charge q and the induced charge of the
conducting plane (see the preceding example).
Example 2. A conducting ball in a uniform ﬁeld. Consider an uncharged conducting ball of radius R
in a unform ﬁeld E0. The induced charges on the ball will redistribute so as to generate the ﬁeld –E0 inside

P3.4. CONDUCTORS AND CAPACITORS

the ball. In order to obtain this distribution, consider two imaginary balls of the same radius but having a
uniform volume charge, one of density ρ and the other of density –ρ. (The ﬁeld of a uniformly charged ball
was considered in example 3 from Subsection P3.3.2.) If the center of the positively charged ball is slightly
displaced by l relative to the center of the negatively charged ball (Fig. P3.8), then the ﬁeld in the overlapping
region is
E = – ρr
3ε0 + ρ(r – l)
3ε0
= – ρl
3ε0 ,
and hence is uniform. The charge inside the overlapping region is zero. Now by letting l →0 and ρ →∞so
that ρl/(3ε0) = E0, we obtain the desired induced charge distribution: σ = σ0 cos θ, where σ0 = ρl = 3ε0E0.
Also, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld the induced charges produce outside the ball. It coincides with that produced by a point
dipole with the dipole moment p = (ρV )l = 4πε0R3E0 (see example 2, Subsection P3.2.2).

P3.4.2. Capacitors
◮Capacitance of a capacitor. A capacitor is an object consisting of a pair of insulated
conductors, one of which having a charge +q and the other the charge –q. The conductors
are often called the plates of the capacitor. The charge q is called the capacitor charge.
The potential difference between the positive and negative plates, U, is called the capacitor
voltage. The voltage is proportional to the capacitor charge:
U = 1
C q,
(P3.4.2.1)
where C is the electric capacitance (or just capacitance) of the capacitor.
◮Simple capacitors. A capacitor is called simple if: (a) its electric ﬁeld is concentrated
within a limited region between the plates (so it can be assumed that all ﬁeld lines start at
the positive plate and ﬁnish at the negative one), (b) the whole region where the ﬁeld is con-
centrated is ﬁlled with a dielectric material having a dielectric permittivity ε. (A dielectric
weakens the electric ﬁeld by a factor of ε; see Subsection P3.5.1.)
Example 1. Parallel-plate capacitor.
A parallel-plate capacitor is one in which the conductors are
parallel plates of area S each separated by a small distance b as compared to the plate size (b ≪
√
S). The
electric ﬁeld between the plates can be regarded as uniform everywhere except for the very edges. The ﬁeld
can be found using formula (P3.4.1.1): E = q/(ε0εS). The voltage of a parallel-plate capacitor equals U = Eb
and its capacitance is
C = ε0εS
b
.
(P3.4.2.2)
Example 2. Spherical capacitor. In a spherical capacitor, its plates are concentric spheres of radii R1
and R2. The ﬁeld between the plates is E =
q
4πε0εr2 , where r is the distance to the center. The voltage is
expressed as U =
R R2
R1 E(r) dr and the capacitance equals
C = 4πε0εR1R2
R2 – R1
.
For R2 →∞, this expression reduces to the capacitance of an isolated sphere (see formula (P3.4.1.3)).

Example 3. Cylindrical capacitor. In a cylindrical capacitor, its plates are concentric cylinders of radii
R1 and R2 with length l ≫R2 – R1. The ﬁeld between the plates is E =
q
2πε0εrl . The voltage is given by
U =
R R2
R1 E(r) dr and the capacitance equals is expressed as
C =
2πε0εl
ln(R2/R1) .
◮Compoundcapacitors. By connecting plates of several simple capacitors, one obtains a
compound capacitor. The capacitance of a compound capacitor is determined by (P3.4.2.1)
and is expressed in terms of the capacitances of its constituents.

Example 4. Consider the circuit shown in Fig. P3.10. Let us take ϕA = 0. Then ϕB = U. The three
connected plates of the capacitors C1, C3, and C5 must have the same potential, ϕ1, and their total charge is
zero. The same holds for the capacitors C2, C4, and C5. This allows us to write a system of equations for the
potentials ϕ1 and ϕ2:
(ϕ1 – U)C3 + (ϕ1 – ϕ2)C5 + ϕ1C1 = 0,
(ϕ2 – U)C4 + (ϕ2 – ϕ1)C5 + ϕ2C2 = 0.
Solving the system, we ﬁnd the charge of the compound capacitor, q = C1ϕ1 + C2ϕ2, and its capacitance
C = q/U.

P3.5. ELECTROSTATICS OF DIELECTRICS

P3.5. Electrostatics of Dielectrics
P3.5.1. Polarization of Dielectrics
◮Bound charges. Polarization density. A dielectric is a material that does not conduct
electric current and, hence, has no free charges (or their number is negligibly small).
Nevertheless, an electric ﬁeld becomes weaker inside a dielectric. This indicates that some
macroscopic charges arise in the volume and on the surface of a dielectric when placed in
an electric ﬁeld. These charges are due to polarization of the dielectric—the phenomenon
where charges bound to individual molecules or the crystal lattice are displaced along the
ﬁeld; these charges are called bound charges. The average dipole moment of molecules
becomes nonzero, which results in a nonzero dipole moment of any volume of the dielectric.
The degree of polarization is characterized by the polarization density vector, P, which is
deﬁned as the net dipole moment of the molecules per unit volume:
P =
P
i pi
∆V
= n〈p 〉,
where n is the molecule concentration.
Macroscopic equations of the electric ﬁeld in a dielectric can be derived using the
simpliﬁed assumption that all molecules in the small volume ∆V have the same dipole
moment 〈p〉= P/n = q0〈l〉.
◮Formation of macroscopic bounded charges. Macroscopic charges distributed over
surface and volume can be used to describe the electric ﬁeld produced by a huge number
of oriented microscopic dipoles. The situation where polarization is uniform (P = const)
is easiest to study. In this case, the volume of the dielectric remain electrically neutral and
positive surface charges arise on one side of the dielectric and negative surface charges arise
on the other side. The vector P is directed from the negative to positive charges and the
electric ﬁeld produced will be in opposite direction.
Figure P3.11. Some charges cross a selected area when the dielectric is polarized.
Polarized molecules in the volume of a dielectric are displaced from their original
positions so that some charge, ∆q, crosses an arbitrary area ∆s in the perpendicular
direction. This charge equals
∆q = n(∆s〈l〉cos θ)q0 = Pn∆s = (P ⋅∆s)
(P3.5.1.1)
where ∆s〈l 〉cos θ is the volume of a thin cylindrical layer whose molecules cross the area
(Fig. P3.11). Integrating over any closed surface yields the net bound charge displaced

from the enclosed volume (the net bound charge enclosed within the surface will have the
opposite sign):
qb
enc = –
I
P ⋅ds
or
div P = –ρb,
(P3.5.1.2)
where ds = n ds is the surface element vector directed along the normal toward the sur-
rounding space and ρb is the volume density of the bound charge. The surface density of
the bound charge of (P3.5.1.1) is given by
σb = Pn.
(P3.5.1.3)
◮Electric displacement. The macroscopic electric ﬁeld, E(r), in a polarized dielectric
is determined by averaging the microscopic ﬁeld, Emicro (highly varying at interatomic
distances), over a small volume containing sufﬁciently many molecules: E(r) = 〈Emicro〉.
The total electric ﬁeld is determined by both bound charges and free charges brought to the
dielectric from outside:
I
E ⋅ds = 1
ε0
(qf
enc + qb
enc).
(P3.5.1.4)
Since the bound charge distribution is unknown in advance, it is convenient to introduce
a vector quantity
D = ε0E + P,
(P3.5.1.5)
which is called the electric displacement ﬁeld or just the electric displacement. It follows
from equations (P3.5.1.2) and (P3.5.1.4) that the electric displacement is determined by the
free charges only:
I
D ⋅ds = qf
enc.
(P3.5.1.6)
This equation is known as Gauss’s law for the electric displacement. In differential form,
this law reads
div D = ρf.
◮Isotropic dielectric.
The polarization density P at a given point in a dielectric is
determined by the external electric ﬁeld E. For not too strong ﬁelds, P is linearly dependent
on E. Furthermore, P ∥E in an isotropic dielectric, and hence
P = ε0χE,
(P3.5.1.7)
whereχ is theelectricsusceptibilityof the dielectricmaterial. Thenthe electric displacement
can be expressed as
D = ε0E + P = ε0E + ε0χE = ε0εE,
(P3.5.1.8)
where ε = 1 + χ is the electric permittivity of the material.
◮Boundary conditions at dielectric interface. For two dielectric media meeting along a
common interface, the following boundary conditions for tangential and normal components
hold:
E1τ = E2τ,
P2n – P1n = –σb,
D2n – D1n = σf.
(P3.5.1.9)
The normal n points from medium 1 to medium 2. If there is no free charge at the interface,
the normal components of the displacement are equal to each other. The ﬁrst condition
in (P3.5.1.9) results from the potentiality of the ﬁeld E (the work along a closed path is
zero). The second and third conditions follow from formulas (P3.5.1.2) and (P3.5.1.6),
respectively. For an isotropic dielectric, we have
E1τ = E2τ,
ε1E1n = ε2E2n;
D1n = D2n,
D1τ
ε1
= D2τ
ε2
.
(P3.5.1.10)
It can be seen that the ﬁeld lines are refracted at the interface between dielectric media. Note
that unlike the electric ﬁeld, the electric displacement lines are continuous at the interface.

P3.5. ELECTROSTATICS OF DIELECTRICS
483
◮Calculation of ﬁelds in the presence of dielectrics. Given the distribution of free
charges, the ﬁeld in the whole space is uniquely determined by the equations for E and D
together with the relation between them (P3.5.1.8) and the boundary conditions (P3.5.1.10).
The solution has the following important properties:
1. Using equations (P3.5.1.2) and (P3.5.1.6) and the formula P = – ε – 1
ε
D, which
follows from (P3.5.1.7) and (P3.5.1.8), we ﬁnd for a homogeneous isotropic dielectric that
ρb = – ε – 1
ε
ρf.
(P3.5.1.11)
Consequently, surface bound charge only will arise due to polarization in the absence of
volume free charge. Note that for an inhomogeneous dielectric, for which ε depends on the
coordinates, volume bound charge arises even if there is no volume free charge.
2. If the boundaries of a homogeneous dielectric coincide with equipotential surfaces
of the ﬁeld E0 produced by free charges in the absence of the dielectric, then the solution
E(r) = E0(r)
ε
(P3.5.1.12)
satisﬁes the boundary conditions.
Example 1. Suppose a point charge q is surrounded by a hollow dielectric sphere with inner radius R1 and
outer radius R2. The ﬁeld in the cavity and outside the dielectric will remain the same. Inside the dielectric,
the ﬁeld will change so that

Example 2. Consider a ball made from a homogeneous dielectric and charged uniformly by a free charge
with volume density ρ. The ﬁeld in the absence of the dielectric was found in example 3, Subsection P3.3.2.
The ﬁeld in the dielectric, for r < R, will be weaker by a factor of ε:

It is not difﬁcult to verify that σb4πR2 = –ρb 4
3 πR3, so the total bound charge is zero, as one would expect.
Example 3. A dielectric slab is placed in a ﬁeld E0 so that it enters the slab at the right angle. The electric
permittivity of the slab varies from ε1 at one side to ε2 at the other side. Then we have
D = ε0E0 = const,

It is easy to verify that the total bound charge is zero.
Example 4. If a homogeneous dielectric ball is placed in a uniform ﬁeld E0, the ball will polarize
uniformly (P = const). Indeed, uniform polarization corresponds to two uniformly charged balls whose centers
are displaced by a small vector l, as was shown in example 2, Subsection P3.4.1. The induced polarization
ﬁeld inside the balls is E1 = –ρl/3ε0 = –(ql/V )/3ε0 = –P/3ε0.
Then the total ﬁeld in the dielectric is
E = E0 + E1 = E0 – P/3ε0. From this equation and the condition P = (ε – 1)ε0E, we ﬁnd that
E = 3E0
ε + 2 ,
P = 3ε0(ε – 1)
ε + 2
E0.
The boundary conditions are all satisﬁed.

484
ELECTRODYNAMICS
P3.5.2. Types of Dielectric and Polarization Mechanisms
There are three main mechanisms of polarization. Accordingly, three basic types of dielec-
tric are distinguished.
◮1. Dipolar polarization in polar dielectrics.
The molecules of a polar dielectric
(polar molecules) have a permanent dipole moment, p0, in the absence of electric ﬁeld.
Examples of such substances, are water (H2O), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonia (NH3),
etc. Due to thermal motion, all dipoles are oriented chaotically in the absence of electric
ﬁeld, resulting in a zero average dipole moment. If there is an external ﬁeld E, dipoles
tend to orient along the ﬁeld (see Subsection P3.2.2). The competition between the chaotic
thermal motion and the orienting action of the electric ﬁeld results in an average dipole
moment 〈p〉. In a weak ﬁeld (p0E ≪kT), the average dipole moment is proportional to E
and decreases with increasing temperature.
In gaseous dielectrics, the probability for polar molecules to be oriented along p is
proportional to exp(–Wp/kT ), where Wp = –(p ⋅E), which follows from Boltzmann’s
distribution (see Subsection P2.5.4). It is apparent that, in an external electric ﬁeld, the
average dipole moment must be directed along E and proportional to p0f(p0E/kT), where
f(x) is some function such that f(0) = 0 and f(x) →1 as x →∞. The case f(x) →1
corresponds to a strong ﬁeld, where all dipoles are nearly parallel to E. For small x (a
weak ﬁeld), we have f(x) ≈γx and 〈p〉≈γ(p2
0/kT ) E, so the average dipole moment is
proportional to E and inversely proportional to T. The analysis gives γ = 1/3. Then,
P = 1
3 (np2
0/kT ) E, and hence the electric permittivity evaluates to
ε = 1 + 1
3
np2
0
ε0kT .
This formula is known as the Langevin–Debye law.
◮2. Electronic polarization in nonpolar dielectrics. In the absence of external electric
ﬁelds, the dipole moment of a nonpolar molecule (e.g., H2, O2, N2, etc.) is zero.
So
the minimum potential energy corresponds to the state where the center of the negative
charge (electronic cloud) of the molecule coincides with that of the positive charge. In the
presence of an electric ﬁeld, the centers of the negative and positive charges are displaced
and a force arises that tries to return them to an equilibrium. If the displacement, l, is small,
the restoring force is proportional to it: F = –βl (quasielastic force). In equilibrium, qE = βl
and the induced dipole moment, p = q0l, turns out to be proportional to the ﬁeld: p = αε0E.
The coefﬁcient α here is called the molecular polarizability. The polarization density is
P = np = nε0αE, where E is the ﬁeld acting on a single molecule. In gases, this ﬁeld can
be regarded as the average ﬁeld in the dielectric. Consequently, the electric permittivity
evaluates to
ε = 1 + χ = 1 + αn.
In dense gases as well as liquid and solid dielectrics, one should take into account that the
ﬁeld acting on a molecule is different from the average ﬁeld. The molecular ﬁeld includes
the local ﬁeld produced by the molecule itself, whereas the average ﬁeld does not.
◮
Difference between the local and average ﬁelds. Consider a homogeneous dielectric crystal with nonpolar
molecules. In order to ﬁnd the ﬁeld acting on a given molecule, consider a sphere with its center at the molecule.
If the molecules are arranged in a regular manner (e.g., at the vertices of a cubic lattice), the ﬁeld produced
by the molecules included within the sphere is zero at the center. Hence, the local ﬁeld at a given point is
Eloc = E + E1, where E is the average macroscopic ﬁeld (equal to the sum of the external ﬁeld and the outer
surface charge ﬁeld) and E1 is the inner surface charge ﬁeld of the spherical hollow. As follows from example 4
above, E1 = P/3ε0, and hence P = nε0α

ε – 1 =
nα
1 – nα
3
or
ε – 1
ε + 2 = nα
3 .
This result is known as the Clausius–Mossotti relation.
◮3. Ionic polarization in solid crystal dielectrics. Examples of such dielectrics are
NaCl, KCl, NaF, KI, etc. In the presence of an external electric ﬁeld, the sublattice of
positive ions (e.g., Na+) is shifted, as a whole, along the ﬁeld and the sublattice of negative
ions (e.g., Cl–) is displaced in the opposite direction.
◮Ferroelectrics. Ferroelectric materials are substances that contain small regions (do-
mains) where all dipoles are spontaneously polarized in the same direction. Ferroelectrics
demonstrate this property only below a certain phase transition temperature, Tc, called the
Curie temperature. These materials are electric analogues of ferromagnetic materials. They
have anomalously large electric permittivity, dependent on the electric ﬁeld and tempera-
ture, demonstrate hysteresis properties when polarized, and become usual dielectrics above
the Curie temperature. (For details about ferromagnetics, see Subsection P3.9.2.)
P3.6. Energy of Electrostatic Field
P3.6.1. Energy of a System of Charges
◮Potential energy of interaction of charged particles.
The energy of interparticle
interaction in a system of charged particles is deﬁned as the work done by external forces to
create this system or as the work done by the electric ﬁeld to destroy this system. The energy
of interaction between two charged particles equals the potential energy of one particle in
the ﬁeld produced by the other:
W12 = q1ϕ2(r1) = q2ϕ1(r2) = k q1q2

.
The energy of a system of charged particles is

other particles at ri. For continuously distributed charges with volume density ρ(r) and
surface density σ(r), the above formula becomes
W = 1

ϕ(r)ρ(r) ds.
(P3.6.1.2)
Although formula (P3.6.1.2) is obtained as a formal generalization of formula (P3.6.1.1),
there are essential differences between them. In the latter, ϕ(ri) is the potential produced
by all charges but the ith, whereas in the former, ϕ(r) is the potential of all the charges
at r (the contribution of a volume or surface element decreases to zero with the element
size). However, the most important difference is this. Formula (P3.6.1.1) considers only
the energy of interaction and if the point charges are moved far away from one another,
the energy of interaction will be negligibly small but there will still remain the ﬁelds of
individual charges. Unlike this, formula (P3.6.1.2) calculates the total energy of a system
of continuously distributed charges and if the system is divided into increasingly smaller
parts that are moved away to inﬁnity, the total energy of all these parts will tend to zero.

P3.6.2. Energy of an Electrostatic Field
◮Energy density of an electric ﬁeld. Within a ﬁeld approach, one should deal with

interaction. The volume energy density of an electric ﬁeld, w = dW/dV , in vacuum is only
dependent on the ﬁeld strength:
w = 1
2 ε0E2.
(P3.6.2.1)
This expression holds for any charge distribution (e.g., it can be obtained by considering
the uniform ﬁeld of a parallel-plate capacitor).

ﬁnite region of space. However, formula (P3.6.2.2) calculates not only ﬁeld energy in the

The ﬁrst term in the last expression is the ﬁeld energy in the dielectric itself while the

2 E ⋅P, is the work done by the ﬁeld to polarize the dielectric. This
expression can be generalized to the case where P (and D) are not proportional to E (e.g.,
for ferroelectrics and strong ﬁelds). To this end, one should look at the process of charging

◮Law of conservation of energy. Force calculation. To calculate the forces, acting on
a charged or polarized body in an electric ﬁeld, one should look at the process of slow
isothermal change of the body position. The work done by external forces together with
work done by voltage sources are equal to the change in the ﬁeld energy. Since the body is
in mechanical equilibrium, the work done by external forces equals the work done by the
force exerted by the ﬁeld, taken with the opposite sign.
Example 2. A parallel-plate capacitor charged to a voltage U is ﬁlled with a liquid or gaseous dielectric
with permittivity ε. Find the force acting on either plate. Also treat the case of a solid dielectric.
Solution. Assume that the capacitor is disconnected from the voltage source. When the distance between
the plates is increased by dx, the energy increases by 1
2 EDS dx and the work done is F dx. Hence, the force
of attraction equals F = 1
2 EDS = 1
2 Eq, where 1
2 E is the ﬁeld strength in the dielectric produced by either
plate (E = U/b). However, if the dielectric is a solid slab, then there is an air gap between the dielectric and
either plate. Then the energy increment equals 1

parallel-plate capacitor charged to a voltage U (see Fig. P3.12).

ELECTRODYNAMICS
Solution. Assume that the respective dimensions of the slab coincide with those of the plates and the slab
is slightly thinner than the interplate distance, b. We also assume that the capacitor is connected to a constant
voltage source, U. Let us pull the slab out of the capacitor by a distance dx (Fig. P3.12). The ﬁeld energy
within the volume dV = ab dx will change by dW =

ab dx (a is the slab width and E = U/b
is the ﬁeld). The charge at the plates will change by dq = ∆σa dx = (ε0E – ε0εE)a dx and the work done by
the source will be δAsource = U dq, which is twice the ﬁeld energy increment. Writing the law of conservation
of energy, F dx + δAsource = dW , we ﬁnd that
F = 1
2 ε0(ε – 1)abE2.
Note that this force arises due to ﬁeld distortion near the plate edges, although the energy calculation was
performed without taking into account edge effects.
P3.7. Direct Current
P3.7.1. Electric Current in a Circuit
◮Electric current. Current density. Electric current is an ordered motion of electric
charges. Convection current is a motion of charges associated with the motion of a charged
body.
Conduction current is a drift motion of free charges (charge carriers) through
a substance (conductor) due to an electric ﬁeld applied.
Examples of free charges are
electrons in metals, ions in electrolytes, electrons and ions in plasma, and electrons and
“holes” in semiconductors. The positive direction of electric current is conventionally taken
to be the direction of positive moving charges.
The charge passing in time dt through an area ds = n ds inside a conductor in the normal
direction n is determined by the average velocity of free charges, 〈v〉:
dq = q0n〈v〉⋅ds dt = j ⋅s dt,
(P3.7.1.1)
where q0 is the charge of a single charge carrier, n is the carrier concentration, and j = q0n〈v〉
is the current density. The charge passing through the cross-section, S, of a conductor per
unit time is called the electric current (or the current) and denoted I:
dq = I dt = dt
Z
j ⋅ds,
(P3.7.1.2)
where the integration is performed over the cross-section. For a linear conductor (S =const),
the current density is constant, j = const, and formula (P3.7.1.2) gives I = jS. A current is
said to be constant if I = const.
The decrease in the total charge within a closed surface equals dqenc = –dt
H
j ⋅ds. In differential form, the
law of conservation of charge is expressed as dρ
dt = – div j. For a constant current,
H
j ⋅ds = 0, or div j = 0, so
the current ﬂows in continuous lines directed along the conductor.
◮Ohm’s law in differential form. To maintain current through a substance, free charges
must be actedupon by an electromagnetic force F, characterizedbyan electric ﬁeldE =F/q0.
As soon as the force is removed, the average velocity of free charges vanishes in a very
short time. For not too strong ﬁelds, the current density in an isotropic conductor must be
proportional to E:
j = σE = 1
ρ E,
(P3.7.1.3)
where σ is the conductivity of the material and ρ is the resistivity. It follows from the law
of conservation of charge that if ρ = const, then
H
E ⋅ds = ρ
H
j ⋅ds = 0, or div E = 0.
Consequently, the ﬁeld lines in a homogeneous conductor are continuous and in a wire of
constant cross-section, they are parallel to the wire surface.

P3.7. DIRECT CURRENT
489
◮Joule–Lenz law in differential form. As current ﬂows through a conductor, the work
done by the ﬁeld E on free charges converts completely into thermal energy due to collisions
with ions. The volume density of the thermal power of the current equals the work done by
the ﬁeld on charges per unit time in a unit volume:
wtherm = n〈v〉⋅F = q0n〈v〉⋅E = j ⋅E = σE2 = ρj2.
(P3.7.1.4)
◮Simple circuit segment. Resistance. If current ﬂows through a segment of an electrical
circuit is due to an electrostatic (Coulomb) ﬁeld only (ρj = Ecoulomb), this circuit segment
is called simple. In a homogeneous conductor (ρ = const),
H
E ⋅ds = ρ
H
j ⋅ds = 0, and,
according to Gauss’s theorem (see Section P3.3), the ﬁeld producing charge is only on the
surface. In a wire of constant cross-section, the equipotential surfaces coincide with wire
cross-sections. The current from a section 1 to section 2 is proportional to the potential
difference ϕ1 – ϕ2:

ϕ1 – ϕ2 = IR.
(P3.7.1.5)
This result is known as Ohm’s law for a simple circuit segment. If I < 0, then current
ﬂows from section 2 to 1. The quantity R =
R 2
1 (ρ/S) dl is the electrical resistance of the
conductor. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (denoted Ω).
For a homogeneous linear conductor, R = ρl/S, where ρ is the electrical resistivity,
l is the conductor length, and S is the cross-sectional area. The electrical resistivity is
temperature dependent; this dependence is practically linear in a wide range of temperatures:
ρ = ρ0[1+ α(T –T0)], where ρ0 is the resistivity at the reference temperature T0 (e.g., 0◦C),
α is the temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity. For many metals, α ≈1/273 (so ρ ≈ρ0αT);
for semiconductors, α < 0.
◮Electromotive force. Although electrostatic forces can maintain current through an
open circuit segment, the total work done by these forces around a closed circuit is zero.
Consequently, other, nonelectrostatic forces must be present in a closed circuit to compen-
sate for thermal losses; the total work of these forces around a closed circuit is nonzero,
and hence these are nonconservative. However, these forces are of electromagnetic nature,
Fnoncons = q0Enoncons, and their work done to transfer a test charge q from point 1 to point 2
is proportional to q:
Aq(1 →2) = q

Enoncons ⋅dl = q 12 = ±q ,
(P3.7.1.6)
where
is the so-called electromotive force (or emf for short), which has the dimension of
voltage and is measured in volts (V). A source of electromotive force is usually regarded as
a source of current (such as a battery) and denoted in circuit diagrams by a circle with the
minus and plus signs as shown in Fig. P3.13. The plus sign in formula (P3.7.1.6) is taken
when the nonconservative forces act in the direction from point 1 to point 2, and the minus
sign is taken otherwise. The power of the nonconservative forces (the power of the emf
source) equals
Pnoncons = Aq(1 →2)

(P3.7.1.7)
The work done by the nonconservative forces in time dt on all charges in the conductor
equals the work done to transfer the charge I dt from one end of the conductor to the other.

If I < 0, current ﬂows from 2 to 1. The quantity U12 = (ϕ1 – ϕ2) +
12, equal to the work
done by all forces to transfer a unit charge from cross-section 1 to 2, is called the voltage on
the selected segment of the circuit. For a simple segment, the voltage equals the potential
difference. Thus, Ohm’s law states that IR = U12 on any circuit segment.

P3.7.2. Current in a Closed Circuit
◮Ohm’s law for an unbranched circuit. The current through an unbranched closed
circuit is constant, I = const. Adding up equations (P3.7.1.9) for all circuit segments, we
get
I
X
Ri =
X
ij.
(P3.7.2.1)
For example, if the current source has internal resistancer andthe resistance of the remaining
circuit is R, we have I =
/(R + r). The potential difference at the source terminals is
ϕ+–ϕ– = IR = –Ir. The short circuit current of the source (R = 0) equals Isc = /r. Ohm’s
law (P3.7.2.1) expresses the law of conservation of energy for an unbranched closed circuit:
the power of nonconservative forces equals the power of thermal losses at the resistors in
the circuit.
◮Useful power of a current source. If a current source is used to transmit energy into
an external circuit, then the total (spent) power equals the power on nonconservative forces:
Ptotal =
I. The lost power equals the thermal losses at the internal resistance: Plost = I2r.
Then the useful power is Puseful = I – I2r = I∆ϕ, where ∆ϕ is the potential difference at
the source terminals. It can be seen that the maximum of Puseful is attained at I =
/(2r)
and is equal to Pmax =
2/(4r).
If the potential difference supplied at the ends of a circuit segment is ϕ1 – ϕ2 and the
segment contains a device that performs work against the external forces (e.g., an electric
motor), then the total power is Ptotal = (ϕ1 – ϕ2)I and the lost power is Plost = I2R,
where R is the resistance of the motor winding. Hence, the useful power equals Puseful =
(ϕ1 – ϕ2)I – I2R = – 12I =
I. The quantities
and I depend on the revolution speed of
the rotor and the maximum of Puseful is attained at I = (ϕ1 – ϕ2)/(2R).

◮Analysis of branched circuits. Kirchhoff’s circuit laws. In order to determine the
currents at various segments of a branchedcircuit, one shouldassign symbols tothe unknown
currents and specify the current directions (in a voluntary way). One of the following two
methods should be used thereafter:
1. Node potential method. For a circuit involving N nodes, the nodal potentials are
taken to be the unknowns (one of the potentials is set to zero). The currents are expressed
in terms of the potentials using (P3.7.1.9). The law of conservation of charge is written
for each of the N – 1 unknown nodal potentials in the form P
i Ii = 0 (the algebraic sum
of the currents ﬂowing into and out of a node is zero; the summation is performed over all
currents involved). Solving the resulting linear system, one ﬁnds the unknown potentials ϕi
and then calculates the currents.
2. Kirchhoff’s laws. In this method, the currents are taken to be the unknowns. First,
the equation P
i Ii = 0 (known as Kirchhoff’s current law or Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst rule) is written
for N – 1 nodes. Then, one chooses an arbitrary closed path and traces it (either clockwise
or counterclockwise) summing up the equations of the form (P3.7.1.9) for each segment.
This results in an equation of the form P
i IiRi = P
i,j
ij (known as Kirchhoff’s voltage
law or Kirchhoff’s second rule). This procedure is repeated for all independent closed paths
to obtain the required number of equations. Finally, the resulting linear system of equations
is solved for the unknown currents.
For more details and examples, see Chapter E6.
◮Equivalent resistances and sources. Several resistances Ri connected with one another
can be replaced by a single equivalent resistance R.

P3.7.3. Classical Free-Electron Theory of Metals
◮Basic postulates. Conduction of metals is explained by the behavior of valence elec-
trons. The free valence electrons are assumed to form an electron gas. In the classical
free-electron theory of Drude–Lorentz, the electron gas is considered to be a classical gas
whose concentration equals the atomic concentration of the metal and temperature equals
the metal temperature. Conduction current is calculated by assuming that the electrons
acquire the drift velocity as they freely move without collisions and that they lose this
velocity completely at each collision with metal ions.
In addition, it is assumed that
|〈v〉| ≪〈v〉∼
√
kT. The average drift velocity is expressed as 〈v〉∼aτ/2 = eEτ/(2me),
where the mean time between collisions τ is expressed in terms of the mean free path and
the mean thermal speed: τ = λ/ 〈v〉. Using (P3.7.1.1), we get
j = en〈v〉=
e2nλ
2me〈v〉E
or
ρ = 2me〈v〉
e2nλ .
A thorough analysis leads to the same result except that the 2 is absent from the numerator;
however, this is not essential for estimates.

ELECTRODYNAMICS
◮Discussion of the result of the classical free-electron theory.
1. The theory explains the increase of ρ with temperature but predicts the behavior
ρ ∼
√
T, which is different from the observed relationship ρ ∼T.
2. The theory successfully explains the Wiedemann–Franz law: for all metals, the
product of the thermal conductivity κ (see Subsection P2.9.2) by the electric resistivity ρ is
proportional to temperature T (the product κρ contains 〈v〉2 only).
3. The mean free path of electrons predicted by the classical theory is several orders of
magnitude larger than the interatomic distance, which contradicts the basic postulates.
4. The electron contribution to the molar heat capacity (see Subsection P2.5.2) is
predicted to be 3
2 R. However, the experimentally found contribution is negligibly small.
P3.8. Constant Magnetic Field
P3.8.1. Lorentz Force and Amp`ere Force
◮Magnetic ﬁeld. Lorentz force. Magnetic ﬁeld is one of the two components of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld (see Subsection P3.2.1). It acts on moving charged particles, currents,
and magnetic moments.
The sources of magnetic ﬁeld are moving charged particles,
currents, magnetic moments, and changing electric ﬁeld. A magnetic ﬁeld is characterized
by a vector quantity B called the magnetic induction (also called the magnetic ﬁeld or
magnetic ﬂux density). The vector B is determined by the equation expressing the force
acting on a moving charged particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld:
F = qE + qv × B.
(P3.8.1.1)
The force FL = qv × B exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld on a moving charged particle is called
the Lorentz force. (The electromagnetic force F is sometimes also called the Lorentz force
or generalized Lorentz force.) The Lorentz force perpendicular to the particle velocity and,
hence, does not produce work.
In order to determine the magnetic induction B by formula (P3.8.1.1), one should do the following:
1) measure the force acting on a static particle to isolate the action of the electric ﬁeld;
2) ﬁnd the direction of the velocity v for which the magnitude of the magnetic force is maximum at
constant v;
3) calculate the magnitude of the magnetic induction as B = Fmax/(qv);
4) for known Fmax and v, ﬁnd the direction of B by the right-hand rule.
The magnetic induction can also be determined by the moment of force the magnetic ﬁeld acts on a small
loop of electric current. The electric ﬁeld does not affect the electric current loop.
The SI unit of magnetic induction is the tesla (T): 1 T = 1 N/(A m) = 1 kg/(A s2).
Example 1. The Hall effect. A conductor with a current ﬂowing through it is immersed in a transverse
constant magnetic ﬁeld (perpendicular to the current). An electrostatic ﬁeld perpendicular to the magnetic
induction arises within the conductor as shown in Fig. P3.14 (the Hall effect). This ﬁeld results from dis-
placement of the drifting free charges by the action of the Lorentz force. The displacement continues until
the Lorentz force is equalized by the electric force: q0〈v〉× B = –q0E. Multiplying by the concentration of
free charges, n, we express E in terms of the current density to obtain E = –
1
q0n j × B. It can be seen that the
free charge concentration (for charges of the same type) and the sign of the charges can be obtained from the
measurement of the magnitude and direction of the electric ﬁeld E.

Example 2. Particle in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. Consider a nonrelativistic particle of mass m and
charge q moving with a velocity v in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. Suppose that v makes an angle α with B
at some instant. The Lorentz force is perpendicular to both v (hence, v = const) and B (hence, the velocity
projections v∥and v⊥onto B and the plane perpendicular to B are conserved). In the projection onto the
perpendicular plane, the particle moves in a circle, whose radius can be found from Newton’s second law:
qv⊥B = mv2
⊥/R. The period of revolutions, T = 2πR/v⊥= 2πm/qB, is independent of the speed. So the
resulting motion occurs in a helical path with radius R and pitch h = v∥T = 2πmv cos α/(qB).
◮Amp`ere’s law. The force acting on a current element in a magnetic ﬁeld (Amp`ere’s
force) equals the sum of the forces acting on the moving free charges:
dF = q0[〈v〉× B] dN = nq0[〈v〉× B] dV = j × B dV = I dl × B.
(P3.8.1.2)
This result is known as Amp`ere’s force law (in differential form). Note the use of formula
(P3.7.1.1), linking the current density to the mean velocity of free charges, to relate the
force acting on a volume element dV with current density j and a line element dl with
current I. The total force acting of a ﬁnite volume with distributed current j(r) of a linear
current-carrying wire is obtained by integrating. For example, the force acting on a wire of
length l with current I in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B equals Il × B. The force acting on a
current-carrying loop is zero: F =

◮Magnetic moment of a current-carrying loop. The magnetic moment of a wire loop
carrying current I is deﬁned as the vector quantity
pm = I
Z
n ds,
(P3.8.1.3)
where the integration is carried out over any surface spanning the loop and the direction of
the normal is determined by the right-hand rule. For a plane loop, we have
pm = ISn = IS.
The magnetic moment of a loop is a magnetic analogue of the electric dipole moment
(see Subsections P3.1.1 and P3.2.2); it determines the magnetic ﬁeld of the loop at large
distances from it and characterizes the behavior of the loop in a magnetic ﬁeld.
Example 3. Consider a rectangular loop with sides a and b, suspended at the side a is a vertical uniform
magnetic ﬁeld B (Fig. P3.15). When current I is supplied, the loop will deﬂect by an angle β such that the
moment of the force of gravity is equalized by the moment of the Amp`ere force: mg 1
2 b sin β = IBabcos β,
or tan β = 2IBa/(mg). Note that the torque exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld on the loop equals M = IS × B =
pm × B. A similar expression was obtained for the torque acting on an electric dipole in an electric ﬁeld (see
Subsection P3.2.2).

where r is the radius vector from the current element to the point A and µ0 = 1/(ε0c2) =

a ﬁnite volume, surface, or wire, one has to perform integration (principle of superposition
for magnetic induction).
◮On systems of units in electromagnetism. Here and henceforth the formulas are given
in SI. To convert units to the Gaussian system (CGS), it sufﬁces in most cases to substitute
B by B/c (and the ﬂux Φ by Φ/c) and µ0 by 4π/c2. If a formula involves the Coulomb
constant k, it must be substituted by 1. The electric constant ε0 is substituted by 1/(4π). It
is noteworthy that µ0ε0 = 1/c2.

circulation of magnetic induction around any closed path is determined by the algebraic

spanning the path):

(P3.8.3.1)
The positive direction of the surface normal is determined by the right-hand rule.
◮Gauss’s law for magnetism. The ﬂux of magnetic induction (magnetic ﬂux) through
any closed surface is zero:
I
B ⋅ds = 0.
(P3.8.3.2)
This means the magnetic ﬁeld lines are everywhere continuous, or there are no magnetic
charges, at which magnetic ﬁeld lines would start or terminate.
The magnetic ﬂux through any surface S is deﬁned as
Φ =

S
B ⋅ds.
The SI unit of magnetic ﬂux is the weber (Wb), with 1 Wb = 1 T m2. It is noteworthy that
magnetic ﬂux through a surface spanning a closed path does not depend on the shape of the
surface. Therefore, it is meaningful to speak about magnetic ﬂux through a closed path.
Example 1. Magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid. A solenoid is a helical coil formed by a long thin wire densely
wound on a cylinder. A solenoid is characterized by the number of turns per unit length, n. The ideal model of
a solenoid is an inﬁnitely long thin cylindrical surface carrying current i = nI, with the current perpendicular
to the axis. It is not difﬁcult to verify that the magnetic ﬁeld inside an ideal solenoid is everywhere parallel to
the axis (to this end, one should consider the contributions of any two symmetric current elements). There is
no magnetic ﬁeld outside the solenoid. It follows from Amp`ere’s circuital law and Gauss’s law that B = const
inside the solenoid. In order to ﬁnd the magnitude B, one should apply Amp`ere’s circuital law to a rectangular
loop one side of which is inside the solenoid and parallel to its axis and the opposite side is outside as shown
in Fig. P3.18. One ﬁnds that Bl = µ0il. So the magnetic ﬁeld inside the solenoid is
B = µ0i = µ0nI.
(P3.8.3.3)
Figure P3.18. The magnetic ﬁeld inside a solenoid can be found using Amp`ere’s circuital law.
Example 2. Magnetic ﬁeld of a rod. Find the magnetic ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely long straight rod of radius R
carrying current I (Fig. P3.19). The magnetic lines are circles. Choose a circle of radius r as the closed
path for Amp`ere’s circuital law (P3.8.3.1). For r > R, we get B × 2πr = µ0I. For r < R, we ﬁnd that
B × 2πr = µ0I(πr2/πR2). Hence,

Example 3. Magnetic ﬁeld of a current plane. Consider an inﬁnite plane (x, y) carrying current in the
y-direction with a constant density i. The magnetic ﬁeld above the plane, z > 0, is directed in the positive
x-direction and that below the plane, z < 0, is in the negative x-direction (this can be veriﬁed by considering the
contributions of two inﬁnite straight currents symmetric relative to the point of interest). Choose a rectangular
path with one side above the plane and in the x-direction and the other being symmetrically located below the
plane (Fig. P3.20). Amp`ere’s circuital law gives 2Bl = µ0il, and hence B = 1
2 µ0i.
Figure P3.21. Displacement of a current loop element in a magnetic ﬁeld.
◮Displacement of a current loop in a magnetic ﬁeld. When a loop carrying constant
current I is moved or deformed in a constant magnetic ﬁeld, the Amp`ere force performs
work. The elementary work done by the Amp`ere force acting on a loop element equals
δA = dF ⋅dr = I[dl × B] ⋅dr = IB ⋅[dr × dl] = IB ⋅ds,
where dr is the displacement of the loop element dl, ds is the area element swept out by dl
(Fig. P3.21). Integrating around the loop yields the elementary mechanical work done by
the magnetic ﬁeld in terms of the increment in the magnetic ﬂux Φ through the loop:
δAmech = I dΦ.
(P3.8.3.4)
It follows that a potential function, Wp = –IΦ, can be associated with a loop carrying
current I in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. A change in this function equals (with the opposite
sign) the work done by the Amp`ere force:
Amech = –∆Wp,
Wp = –IΦ.
(P3.8.3.5)
For a uniform ﬁeld or a small plane loop, formula (P3.8.3.5) becomes
Wp = –pm ⋅B,
(P3.8.3.6)
where pm is the magnetic moment of the current loop (see Subsection P3.8.1). Since this
expression coincides with the potential energy of an electric dipole (see Subsection P3.2.2),
it is natural to assume that the torque acting on a magnetic dipole and the force acting on a
magnetic dipole in a nonuniform ﬁeld should have the same form:
M = pm × B,
F = pm
∂B
∂n = pmx
∂B
∂x + pmy
∂B
∂y + pmz
∂B
∂z ,
(P3.8.3.7)
where n is parallel pm. The equilibrium orientation of a magnetic dipole corresponds to the
minimum potential energy, and hence it corresponds to pm ∥B. A current loop oriented in
this manner is pulled into the region of a stronger magnetic ﬁeld.

ELECTRODYNAMICS
◮Maxwell’s equations for a constant magnetic ﬁeld. In differential form, these equa-
tions are
curl B = µ0j,
div B = 0.
In integral form, these are equations (P3.8.3.1) and (P3.8.3.2).
◮
Vector potential. Maxwell’s equation div B = 0 is satisﬁed if the magnetic ﬁeld is sought in the form
B = curl A.
The vector potential A is deﬁned up to an arbitrary constant scalar ﬁeld χ.
The potential
A′ = A + grad χ generates the same ﬁeld B as A; this expression is known as the calibration transformation
for a vector potential. This transformation allows us to simplify the vector potential equation resulting from
substituting B = curl A into the ﬁrst Maxwell equation: grad div A – ∆A = µ0j. By choosing a scalar ﬁeld χ
such that div A = 0, we arrive at the equation
∆A = –µ0j.
The equation for each projection of A onto the coordinate axes is mathematically identical with the equation
for the electric scalar potential (see Subsection P3.3.2). Consequently, the solution of these equations is given
by
A(r) = µ0
4π
Z
j(r′) dV ′
|r – r′| .
In particular, one can ﬁnd the ﬁeld of a small current loop (see (P3.8.2.3)) or prove the Biot–Savart law using
this expression.
P3.9. Magnetic Field in Matter
P3.9.1. Magnetization. Molecular Currents
◮Magnetization of a material. A material is regarded as magnetized if it creates a
magnetic ﬁeld inside itself and in the surrounding space in the absence of conduction
currents. The source of magnetic ﬁeld of a magnetized material are magnetic moments
of atoms and molecules (atomic and molecular currents). In the absence of an external
magnetic ﬁeld, microscopic magnetic moments are either absent (in diamagnetic materials)
or chaoticallyoriented(in paramagneticmaterials). Inbothcases, themacroscopic magnetic
ﬁeld is zero. Constant magnets (made from ferromagnetic substances) are an exception; they
can have a macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld (see below for details). When a material is immersed
in an external magnetic ﬁeld, the material is magnetized and an induced volumetric magnetic
moment arises. The degree to which a material is magnetized is characterized by the vector
of magnetization J, which is deﬁned as the net magnetic moment per unit volume:
J =
P
i pmi
∆V
= n〈pm〉,
(P3.9.1.1)
where n is the molecule concentration. For the construction of macroscopic ﬁeld equations
for a magnetized material, it can be assumed for simplicity that all molecules in a small
volume ∆V have the same magnetic moment 〈pm〉= J/n = I0s, or they can be represented
as identical microscopic current loops.
◮Macroscopic molecular currents. In characterizing magnetic ﬁeld in matter, the huge
number of oriented microscopic currents (magnetic moments) may be replaced by macro-
scopic molecular currents distributed across surface and volume. For a simple example,
consider a homogeneous magnetized cylinder whose molecular current loops are all oriented
along the cylinder axis. The different currents will compensate for one another inside the
cylinder and there will be uncompensated current ﬂowing along the surface. The magnetic

ﬁeld of the surface current, Bmol, will have, inside the cylinder, the same direction as the
magnetization J.
For an arbitrary closed path, its element dl inside the magnetized material pierces the
current loops whose centers fall within the volume dV = s⋅dl (Fig. P3.22). The contribution
into the molecular current enclosed by the path (i.e., the current crossing the surface that
spans the path) equals I0n dV = nI0s ⋅dl = J ⋅dl. Integrating gives
I
J ⋅dl = Imol
enc .
(P3.9.1.2)
In differential form, this equation becomes curl J = jmol. These two equations allow us to
express the current density at the surface as
imol = J × n,
(P3.9.1.3)
where n is the outward normal to the surface of the magnetized material.
◮Magnetic ﬁeld strength. Macroscopic magnetic induction in a magnetized material
results from averaging the microscopic ﬁeld B, highly varying at interatomic distances, over
a small volume, though large enough to contain a large number of molecules: B(r)=〈Bmicro〉.
The magnetic induction is determined by both molecular and nonmolecular currents (such
as conduction currents or convection currents):
I
B ⋅dl = µ0(Inonmol
enc
+ Imol
enc ).
(P3.9.1.4)
Since the molecular current distribution is usually unknown, it is convenient to introduce a
new vector quantity called the magnetic ﬁeld strength and deﬁned as
H = B
µ0
– J,
(P3.9.1.5)
which is only deﬁned by nonmolecular currents:
I
H ⋅dl = Inonmol
enc
(P3.9.1.6)
(Amp`ere’s circuital law for the magnetic ﬁeld strength). In differential form, this expression
becomes: curl H = jnonmol. The SI unit for magnetic ﬁeld strength is A/m.
◮Boundary conditions at the interface between different magnetic materials. For
the normal and tangential components of B, H, and J, the following boundary conditions
hold at the interface between two magnetic media:
B2n = B1n,
H1 × n – H2 × n = inonmol,
J1 × n – J2 × n = imol,
(P3.9.1.7)
where n is a normal vector pointing from medium 1 to medium 2 and |H × n| = Hτ. If
there is no nonmolecular current at the interface, the second condition can be rewritten
as H1τ = H2τ. The ﬁrst condition follows from Gauss’s law (P3.8.3.2) for B, the second
follows from (P3.9.1.6), and the third from (P3.9.1.3). There is a formal analogy in boundary
conditions between H and E and also between B and D (see Subsection P3.5.1).

500
ELECTRODYNAMICS
◮Isotropic magnetic material. The magnetization J at a given point inside a magnetic
material arises due to an external magnetic ﬁeld and is determined by the vector B. For not
too strong ﬁelds, J depends on B linearly and in an isotropic material, in addition, J ∥B.
Then both vectors J and H are proportional to B and to each other. For historical reasons
(due to the analogy between E and H in boundary conditions), the magnetic susceptibility
is deﬁned by
J = χH,
J =
χ
µ0(1 + χ) B.
(P3.9.1.8)
From (P3.9.1.5) we get
B = µ0(1 + χ)H = µ0µH,
(P3.9.1.9)
where µ is the magnetic permeability of the material. For paramagnetic materials, χ > 0.
For diamagnetic materials, χ < 0. In both cases, |χ| ≪1 (weak magnetic properties). For
ferromagnetic materials, χ ≫1.
The boundary conditions at the interface between two isotropic magnetic media are
B1n = B2n,
B1τ

µ1H1n = µ2H2n,
H1τ = H2τ.
◮Calculation of ﬁelds in the presence of a magnetic material. The equations for B
and H together with the above boundary conditions determine magnetic ﬁeld in the whole
space if the nonmolecular currents are known. Below are some important properties of
solutions:
1. The volume density of the molecular current is proportional to that of the nonmolec-
ular current: jmol = χjnonmol. If there are no nonmolecular currents, then surface molecular
currents only arise when the material is magnetized.
2. If the boundaries of a homogeneous magnetic material are everywhere tangent to the
original (B0) magnetic lines, then B = µB0 everywhere in the magnetic material.
Example 1. A long paramagnetic cylinder is immersed in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld whose induction B0
is parallel to the cylinder axis. Find the magnetic induction, magnetic ﬁeld strength, and magnetization inside
the cylinder.
Solution. Everywhere inside the cylinder (except for its edges) we have: B = µB0, H = H0 = B0/µ0, and
J = (µ – 1)B0/µ0.
Example 2. An inﬁnitely long rod of circular cross-section, made from a material with magnetic perme-
ability µ > 1, carries a constant current with density j. Find the magnetic ﬁeld strength, magnetic induction,
and magnetization. Also calculate the surface and volume density of the molecular current.
Solution. The molecular current within the rod volume has the density jmol = (µ–1)j. The ﬁeld strength H
can be found using Amp`ere’s circuital law (P3.9.1.6). We get H = I/(2πr) for r > R and H = Ir/(2πR2) for
r < R (see example 2, Subsection P3.8.3). The magnetic induction equals B = µ0H for r > R and B = µ0µH
for r < R; it has a jump discontinuity at the surface current. The magnetization equals J = (µ – 1)Ir/(2πR2)
(J = 0 outside the rod). The magnetic lines are concentric circles and the vectors H and J are parallel to B.
The surface molecular current is i = J × n; it equals imol = (µ – 1)I/(2πR) in magnitude and is opposite to j in
direction. The total molecular current is zero, and hence jmolπR2 = imol2πR.
P3.9.2. Types of Magnetic Materials and Magnetization Mechanisms
Atomic and molecular magnetic moments are created by (a) the motion of electrons in closed
orbits (orbital magnetic moments) and (b) the intrinsic magnetic moments of electrons re-
lated to the intrinsic mechanical angular momentum—spin (spin magnetic moments). Each
type of magnetic moment is proportional to the corresponding mechanical angular momen-
tum: pm = –g(e/2m)L, where g is a dimensionless coefﬁcient called the gyromagnetic
ratio. For orbital moment, g = 1. For spin moment, g = 2.

P3.9. MAGNETIC FIELD IN MATTER
501
◮Diamagnets. Larmor’s mechanism of diamagnetic magnetization. In the absence
of external magnetic ﬁelds, the magnetic moments of atomic (molecular) electrons in a
diamagnetic material (diamagnet) compensate for one another. When a magnetic ﬁeld is
applied, a torque starts to act on each magnetic moment. As a result, the magnetic moment
rotates about the magnetic ﬁeld direction (Larmor precession):
dL
dt = pm × B = –g e
2m L × B =

× L.
The vector L (and also pm) rotates with an angular velocity ωL = g e
2m B (Fig. P3.23). This
rotation gives rise to an additional magnetic moment of each electron, ∆pm, opposing to B
(independently of the original direction of pm).

◮Orientational mechanism of magnetization in paramagnetic materials. In param-
agnets, the magnetic moments of electrons do not compensate for one another even in the
absence of external magnetic ﬁelds. The weak mechanism of diamagnetic magnetization
is superimposed by a stronger orientational mechanism: in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld,
the orientation of the magnetic moment along the ﬁeld is less costly energetically.
In
weak ﬁelds (pmB ≪kT), the average magnetic moment is proportional to the magnetic
induction. In strong ﬁelds, saturation is achieved, where all magnetic moments are oriented
along the ﬁeld and the magnetization virtually does not change. The orientational mecha-
nism of paramagnetic magnetization is similar to that of polar dielectric polarization (see
Subsection P3.5.2). In particular, the conclusion about inverse proportionality between the
susceptibility and temperature remains valid.
◮Ferromagnets are materials that show spontaneous magnetization in macroscopic
(compared to interatomic distances) regions called domains.
The domains are small
(∼10–5 to 10–4 m) as compared to the size of the sample under examination.
Within
each domain, spin magnetic moments are parallel to one another, which results from a
special quantum interaction among them. In the absence of external magnetic ﬁelds, the
domains are oriented in such a way that the average magnetization of the material is zero.
When an external magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the domains oriented along the ﬁeld increase in
size and the domains oriented against the ﬁeld decrease. For stronger ﬁelds, the domains
tend to turn as a whole to be oriented along the ﬁeld. In strong enough ﬁelds, all domains
are oriented along the ﬁeld and saturation is achieved, when the magnetization reaches its
maximum magnitude, Jsat, called the saturation magnetization.
The relationship between J and H is nonlinear (see Fig. P3.24). This means that the
magnetic permeability, determined by the formula J = (µ – 1)H, depends on H and at-
tains very large values (µ ∼105–106). When the external ﬁeld is removed, some residual
magnetization, Jres, is observed. The ﬁeld strength required to completely demagnetize the
sample, HC, is called the coercive ﬁeld or coercive force. Ferromagnetic materials possess-
ing a large coercive force are used to make permanent magnets. The dependence J(H) for
direct and reverse magnetization to saturation is called a hysteresis loop.

P3.10. Electromagnetic Induction
P3.10.1. Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction
◮Motion of a wire loop in a constant ﬁeld. When a current-carrying wire loop is moved
or deformed in a constant magnetic ﬁeld, the Amp`ere forces are everywhere perpendicular
to the current and, according to (P3.8.3.4), perform mechanical work δA⊥= I dΦ. Since
the total work done by the Lorentz force on any moving particle is zero, the same work (but
opposite in sign) is performed by the magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., the tangential component of the
Lorentz force) on free charges moving through the wire. This gives rise to an additional
electromotive force (induced emf) in the loop:
δA∥= –I dΦ = –(Idt) dΦ
dt =
dq,
= – dΦ
dt .
(P3.10.1.1)
◮Static loop. Solenoidal electric ﬁeld. It follows from Einstein’s relativity principle
that an induced emf must also arise when a static current-carrying loop is placed in a time
varying magnetic ﬁeld. Consider, for example, a permanent magnet approaching a closed
loop at a constant velocity. In the magnet-associated inertial frame of reference, the ﬁeld
produced by the magnet is time independent and the induced emf in the loop is accounted for
by the action of the Lorentz force. On the other hand, in the loop-associated inertial frame,
the same emf is observed, but it cannot be caused by magnetic forces. Hence, the varying
magnetic ﬁeld must bring about an electric ﬁeld. Since the work of this ﬁeld around the
loop must be nonzero, it follows that the ﬁeld is not electrostatic—it is called a solenoidal
(eddy) electric ﬁeld. Thus, an induced emf arises in the loop regardless of the reason for
which the magnetic ﬂux through the loop changes. The induced emf equals
= – dΦ
dt .
(P3.10.1.2)
This equation is known as Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The average induced
emf in a ﬁnite time ∆t equals
ave = –∆Φ/∆t. The charge passed through the loop in this
time is
q =
Z
I dt =
Z
R dt = – ∆Φ
R ,
where R is the resistance of the loop.

P3.10. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
503
◮Lenz’s rule. The direction of the emf is determined by its sign. It should be reminded
(see Subsection P3.8.3) that the loop is oriented: the positive direction of the normal to the
surface, in the formula for the calculation of Φ, and the positive direction of tracing the
path, which determines the sign of the emf, are related by the right-hand rule. The minus
sign in (P3.10.1.2) is in accordance with Lenz’s rule. It states that the induced emf must
be directed so that the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the induced current ﬂowing in the same
direction, generates a magnetic ﬂux (induced magnetic ﬂux) of opposite sign as compared
to the ﬂux change that caused the emf. Lenz’s rule is closely associated with the law of
conservation of energy.
◮Motion of part of a loop. When a loop element dl moves with a velocity v, the work
done by the Lorentz force to transfer a test charge q along dl equals δA = q[v×B]⋅dl = q d .
The electromotive forces induced by an arbitrarily moving portion of the loop in an arbitrary
constant ﬁeld and by a translationally moving portion of the loop in a uniform constant ﬁeld
are, respectively, equal to
=
Z
[v × B] ⋅dl,
= [v × B] ⋅l,
(P3.10.1.3)
where l is the vector connecting the beginning and the end of the moving portion. If the
wire loop is unclosed, a potential difference will arise between its ends, which is equal to
the emf (since the electrostatic force is equalized by the Lorentz force at any point of the
wire).
Example 1. A crosspiece of length l and resistance r moves with a speed v along two horizontal rails
immersed in a vertical magnetic ﬁeld (Fig. P3.25). Find the current through the crosspiece.
Figure P3.25. To example 1. An equivalent diagram is on the right.
Solution. Suppose that the rails are connected by a resistance R1 on one side and a resistance R2 on the
other side. In order to ﬁnd the current through the crosspiece as it moves with the speed v, we use (P3.10.1.3)
to calculate the emf induced in the crosspiece:
= Bvl. The fact that the emf is localized within the moving
crosspiece enables us to draw an equivalent diagram, shown on the right, and eventually ﬁnd the current:
I =
/(r + R), where R = R1R2/(R1 + R2).
◮Equations of solenoidal electric ﬁeld. By writing down Faraday’s law (P3.10.1.2) for
a static loop in a varying magnetic ﬁeld, we obtain a solenoidal electric ﬁeld equation in
integral form:
I
E ⋅dl = – d
dt
Z
B ⋅ds.
(P3.10.1.4)
Since the circulation of the electrostatic ﬁeld strength around a closed path is zero, the total
electric ﬁeld satisﬁes the same equation. The differential form of this equation is
curl E = – ∂B
∂t .
(P3.10.1.5)
Equations (P3.10.1.4) and (P3.10.1.5) represent one of Maxwell’s equation (in integral and
differential forms).

504
ELECTRODYNAMICS
◮Quasistationary approximation. If the currents and ﬁelds change sufﬁciently slowly,
time delay of processes can be neglected. This means that the varying magnetic ﬁeld is
determined at any point (using the Biot–Savart–Laplace formulas) by the currents at the
same instant of time.
This also means that the electrostatic ﬁeld is determined by the
charge distribution at the same instant and the solenoidal electric ﬁeld is calculated from
the varying magnetic ﬁeld using (P3.10.1.4) and (P3.10.1.5). It is this approximation that
is used for the analysis of alternating current circuits. For this approximation to be valid it
is required that the characteristic current variation time, τ, is large compared to (a) the local
relaxation times (e.g., the time in which an equilibrium charge distribution is established in
the conductor) and (b) the delay time τd = l/c, where l is the characteristic size of the system
and c is the speed of light. The latter condition suggests that we neglect the displacement
current in Maxwell’s equations (i.e., we assume that curl B = µ0j).
Example 2. Let us estimate the time τ of charge redistribution in a conductor with resistivity ρ. We assume
that there is a local volume charge somewhere in the conductor. The charge redistribution within an arbitrary
volume is governed by the equation dq

, and
so τ = ε0ρ.
P3.10.2. Self-Induction and Mutual Induction
◮Self-induction. Consider a stationary wire loop carrying current I changing in time.
The magnetic induction produced by the current will change at a rate proportional to dI/dt.
Hence, the solenoidal electric ﬁeld arising at every point in space is also proportional
to dI/dt. This ﬁeld induces the emf
self = –L dI
dt
(P3.10.2.1)
in the loop. This emf is called the self-induction electromotive force. The quantity L
is called the coefﬁcient of self-inductance or the inductance of the loop. The SI unit of
inductance is the henry (H). The quantity Φself = LI is the self-induced magnetic ﬂux
through the area spanned by the loop. Using (P3.10.2.1), we get
self = – dΦself
dt
.
(P3.10.2.2)
This formula remains valid not only if I changes but also if L does.
Note that the deﬁnition of L as the coefﬁcient of proportionality between magnetic ﬂux and current meets
with difﬁculties: for a linear wire, the magnetic ﬂux is inﬁnitely large and for a wire of ﬁnite thickness, the
usual deﬁnition of the ﬂux is unsuitable, since it is unclear how to choose a path.
Example 1. Inductance of a solenoid.
Consider a solenoid of length l and cross-sectional area S
(l ≫
√
S ) carrying current with surface density i = (N/l)I, where N is the number of turns and I is the current
in the coil. The magnetic ﬁeld in the solenoid is uniform and its magnetic induction (in the ideal solenoid
approximation) is given by (P3.8.3.3): B = µ0µi. For a changing current, the circulation of the solenoidal
electric ﬁeld is calculated as
I
E ⋅dl = –S dB
dt = –µ0µS di
dt and the emf induced along the whole length of the
winding equals
c = –Nµ0µS di
dt = – N 2µ0µS

dt . The inductance and the magnetic ﬂux are expressed as
L = N 2µ0µS

,
Φself = LI = NBS.
(P3.10.2.3)
Example 2. Since the self-induction emf is proportional to the current change rate, the presence of
inductance in a circuit impedes too rapid changes of the current. Suppose that a resistor R and an induction coil L
are in a closed circuit with a source of constant emf
. The current increases from zero to I0 =
/R in a ﬁnite
time and this process is governed by the equation
–L(dI/dt) = IR, whose solution is I = I0[1–exp(–tR/L)].
Hence, the characteristic time of current increasing equals τ = L/R.

P3.10. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION
505
◮Mutual induction. If there are two stationary loops, the current change in one of them
will bring about in the other loop an electromotive force proportional to dI/dt, called the
mutual induction emf. We have
21 = –L21
dI1
dt ,
12 = –L12
dI2
dt ,
(P3.10.2.4)
where L12 and L21 are the so-called coefﬁcients of mutual inductance; the mutuality theorem
(in a non-ferromagnetic medium) states that L12 = L21. The magnetic ﬂux through loop 1
produced by the current through loop 2 is given by Φ12 = L12I2. This quantity is meaningful
for two linear currents also.
In the quasistationary approximation, the vector potential can be calibrated in the same way as in magne-
tostatics (see Subsection P3.8.3). The magnetic ﬂux can be written as
Φ =

B ds =

curl A ds =

For Φ12, we get
Φ12 =

It is apparent that the expression of L12 is symmetric with respect to the subscripts 1 and 2.
P3.10.3. Energy of Magnetic Field
◮Energy of a loop. The energy of a current-carrying loop is the work done by external
forces and sources to create the current (or, equivalently, the work of the solenoidal ﬁeld to
destroy the current). The work done by the current source against the self-induction emf of
the loop is calculated as
W = A =
Z ∞
0
L dI
dt (I dt) = LI2
2 .
(P3.10.3.1)
Within a consistent ﬁeld approach, the energy must be related with the magnetic ﬁeld
rather than the loop current. The easiest way to ﬁnd the dependence between the energy
density and the magnetic induction is to consider a long solenoid with a uniform ﬁeld in it.

◮Law of conservation of energy and force calculation. If the positions of the bodies
and current-carrying loops change sufﬁciently slowly and isothermally, the total work done
by external forces and current sources is spent on changing the magnetic ﬁeld energy and
releasing Joulean heat. Moreover, the work done by external forces on each body equals
the work done by the magnetic forces on the body. If the currents are maintained constant,
one has only to take into account the additional work done by the current sources against
the induction emf; the work done by the original emf equals the heat released and, hence,
they cancel each other out in the law of conservation of energy.
Example. Consider two loops carrying currents I1 and I2 that are maintained constant. Let us calculate the
work Ae done by external forces for a slow movement of the ﬁrst loop. According to (P3.10.3.3), the changing
part of the energy is only the energy of current interaction, which is equal to W12 = L12I1I2 = I1Φ12, where Φ12 is
the magnetic ﬂux created by the second current and passing through the ﬁrst loop. At the same time, the potential
function of the loop in an external ﬁeld is Wp = –I1Φ12 (see (P3.8.3.5)), and hence δAe = –I1 dΦ12 = –I1I2 dL12.
The apparent contradiction is resolved by taking into account the additional work done by the current sources
against the induction emf in either loop. This work equals δAsources = I1 dΦ12 +I2 dΦ21 = I1 dL12 I2 +I2 dL21 I1,
which is twice the ﬁeld energy change dW12 = I1I2 dL12, and δAe + δAsources = dW12.
P3.11. Maxwell’s Equations
P3.11.1. Maxwell’s Equations in Vacuum and Matter
◮Displacement current. To generalize the electromagnetic ﬁeld equations in vacuum
to cover varying ﬁelds, only one of the four equations (see Subsections P3.3.2, P3.8.3,
and P3.10.1) has to be changed.
Three equations hold true in all cases but Amp`ere’s
circuital law (P3.8.3.1) turns out to be invalid for varying ﬁelds and currents. According
to (P3.8.3.1), the current
R
j ⋅ds must be the same for any two surfaces spanning the
closed path; if the charge within the volume between the two selected surfaces changes,
this statement will contradict the principle of conservation of charge. For example, when a
parallel-plate capacitor is being charged (Fig. P3.26), the current through one of the surfaces
is I = dq/dt and there in no current through the other surface (passing between the plates).
Figure P3.26. To the determination of the displacement current.
To remove the contradiction, Maxwell introduced a displacement current in the equation,
with its density proportional to the rate of change of the electric ﬁeld D:
jd = ∂D
∂t .
(P3.11.1.1)

P3.11. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS
507
In a dielectric medium, the displacement current density equals
jd = ε0
∂E
∂t + ∂P
∂t .
(P3.11.1.2)
The ﬁrst term represents the displacement current density in vacuum and the second term
is the real current density due to motion of bound charges in changing polarization. The
displacement current through a surface equals dΦD/dt, where ΦD is the ﬂux of D through
the surface. The introduction of the displacement current removes the contradiction with the
principle of conservation of charge. For example, when a parallel-plate capacitor is being
charged, the displacement current through a surface between the plates, Id = S(dD/dt) =
S(dσ/dt) = dq/dt, equals the current ﬂowing through the wires.
◮System of Maxwell’s equations in vacuum. Once the displacement current has been
introduced, the system of Maxwell’s equations in differential form becomes:

Solution of Maxwell’s equations in the form of delayed potentials.
The ﬁrst and fourth Maxwell
equations can be satisﬁed by using the ﬁelds in the form
B = curl A,
E = – grad ϕ – ∂A

The scalar potential ϕ and vector potential A are deﬁned up to the calibration transformation:
A′ = A + grad χ,
ϕ′ = ϕ – ∂χ

The equations for the potentials resulting from the second and third Maxwell equations can be simpliﬁed using
the calibration transformation. To this end, the potentials are required to satisfy Lorentz’s calibration condition:

If the right-hand side vanishes, d’Alembert’s equation becomes the wave equation (see Chapter P4). In the

The potentials at a given point in space and a given time instant are determined by the charges and currents at
all other points at preceding instants of time, taking into account the time required for a light signal to deliver
information to the given point about the current and charge values at a remote point.

These serve to determine the four vector quantities E, D, B, and H. Maxwell’s equations
in a medium must be supplemented by the material equations relating D to E and H to B
and characterizing the electric and magnetic properties of the medium. For isotropic linear
media, the equations are
D = ε0εE,
B = µ0µH.
Maxwell’s equations can also be used to obtain boundary conditions for E, D, B, and H
(see Subsections P3.5.1 and P3.9.1).

The ﬁrst term characterizes the rate of change of electromagnetic ﬁeld energy in the volume.
In general, the formulas obtained before for electrostatic and magnetostatic ﬁelds remain
valid for the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy. The second term represents the power of the ﬁeld
work on the charged particles within the volume of interest; it is equal to the rate of change
of their kinetic energy. It follows from the law of conservation of energy that the third
term has the meaning of (outward) electromagnetic energy ﬂux through the closed surface
bounding the volume. The energy ﬂux at a given point in space (the Poynting vector) is
determined by the vectors E and B at this point:

inﬂux through the lateral surface of the cylinder, S(2πrb) = HE(2πrb) = Eπr2b dD
dt , equals the energy change
in the volume.
P3.11.3. Relativistic Properties of Fields
◮Transformation of charges and currents. When changing from one inertial frame of
reference to another, both the electromagnetic ﬁeld sources (charge and current densities)
and the ﬁelds themselves change. However, Maxwell’s equations remain the same. The
source transformation formulas for ρ (density of moving charge) and j = ρv have the simplest
form. Denoting by ρ0 the charge density in the inertial frame where j = v = 0 and taking
into account length contraction (see Subsection P1.10.3), we get
ρ = γρ0,
j = γρ0v;
γ =
1
p
1 – v2/c2 .
Comparing with the momentum-energy 4-vector, we see that (j, ρc) also forms a 4-vector,
which means that j and ρc are transformed in the same manner as (r, ct), by the Lorentz
formulas.
◮Transformation of ﬁelds. Once we know the transformation formulas for ﬁeld sources,
it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd out how E and B are transformed. The formulas are
E′

where V is the velocity of inertial frame K′ relative to inertial frame K; the transformations
are written for the ﬁeld components parallel and perpendicular to V. The scalar quantities
E ⋅B and E2 – c2B2 are invariant under these transformations:
E ⋅B = E′ ⋅B′,
E2 – c2B2 = (E′)2 – c2(B′)2.
(P3.11.3.2)
For V ≪c, formulas (P3.11.3.1) simplify to
E′ = E + V × B,
B′ = B – 1
c2 V × E.
(P3.11.3.3)
Example 1. Magnetic ﬁeld of a nonrelativistic particle. Consider a particle with charge q moving
relative to inertial frame K with a constant nonrelativistic velocity v.
In the particle associated inertial
frame K′, there is only the electric ﬁeld E′ = kqr′/r′3. To ﬁnd the ﬁelds in frame K, one has to write out the
transformation formulas (P3.11.3.3) with V = –v. Since there is no length contraction in the nonrelativistic
limit, we ﬁnd that
E = E′ =

we have used the relation 1/c2 = µ0ε0.

ELECTRODYNAMICS
Example 2. Polarization of a dielectric moving in a magnetic ﬁeld. When a dielectric moves through a
magnetic ﬁeld with an nonrelativistic velocity perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld lines, it becomes polarized.
In the dielectric-associated inertial frame, there is transverse electric ﬁeld: E′ = v×B. The detailed polarization
picture depends on the shape of the dielectric.
Example 3. Electric ﬁeld of a relativistic particle. Suppose a particle with charge q moves relative to
inertial frame K with a constant relativistic velocity v. In the particle associated inertial frame K′, there is only
the electric ﬁeld E′ = kqr′/r′3. To ﬁnd the ﬁelds in frame K, one has to write out the transformation formulas
(P3.11.3.1) with V = –v. Let us write out the formulas for the instant when the particle passes through the origin
of coordinates in frame K. For simplicity, consider the plane (x, y). When changing from the coordinates
(x′, y′) to (x, y), we must take into account that x′ = γx and y′ = y (the coordinates of a point in frame K are
measured at the same instant when the particle passes through the origin). We get
Ex = E′
x = k
qγx
[(γx)2 + y2]3/2 ,
Ey = γE′
y = k
qγy
[(γx)2 + y2]3/2 .
It is seen that E is collinear with r. However, the ﬁeld at a point on the line of motion will be smaller than that
at a point which is at the same distance from the charge but on a straight line perpendicular to v. The magnetic
ﬁeld is obtained as
B = γ
c2 v × E′ = 1
c2 v × E = µ0

Note that the above electric ﬁeld is not potential.

Chapter P4
Oscillations and Waves
P4.1. Oscillations
◮General deﬁnitions. Oscillations are repetitive variations in the state of a system such
that the state parameters vary in time according to a periodic or almost periodic law. If
oscillations occur without external action due to system deviation from a stable equilibrium,
the oscillations are said to be free or natural. If the oscillations occur under the action of an
external periodic force, then they are said to be forced. The oscillations are characterized
by their period T and frequency ν = 1/T (measured in hertzs: 1 Hz = 1 s–1). The term
vibrations is often used in a narrower sense to mean mechanical oscillations, but sometimes
is used synonymously with oscillations.
P4.1.1. Harmonic Oscillations. Composition of Oscillations
◮Simple harmonic oscillations. An oscillation of a quantity x is said to be a simple
harmonic oscillation (or simple harmonic motion) if x varies in time t by the law
x = A cos(ωt + ϕ0),
(P4.1.1.1)
where A is the amplitude, ϕ = ωt + ϕ0 is the phase, ϕ0 is the initial phase, and ω = 2π/T is
the angular or circular frequency of the oscillation. The ﬁrst and second time-derivatives
of the quantity x,
˙x = –Aω sin(ωt + ϕ0) = Aω cos
 ωt + ϕ0 + π/2

,
¨x = –Aω2 cos(ωt + ϕ0) = Aω2 cos(ωt + ϕ0 + π),
(P4.1.1.2)
oscillate harmonically with the same frequency but with amplitudes ωA and ω2A and with
the phase shifts π/2 and π, respectively.
Example. If the initial values (at t = 0) of the quantity x and its derivative, x(0) = x0 and ˙x(0) = v0,
are known, then the amplitude and the initial phase of the oscillation can be determined.
The equations
x0 = A cos ϕ0 and v0 = –ωA sin ϕ0 allow one to ﬁnd A =
p
x2
0 + (v0/ω)2 and tan ϕ0 = –v0/(ωx0).
◮Equation of simple harmonic oscillations. It follows from (P4.1.1.2) that if x varies by
the harmonic law (P4.1.1.1), then x satisﬁes the equation of simple harmonic oscillations:
¨x + ω2x = 0.
(P4.1.1.3)
The converse is also true: if the equation of motion of a physical system whose state is
determined by a single quantity x can be reduced under certain conditions (usually, for
small values of x) to the differential equation ¨x + γx = 0, where γ is a positive constant,
then x varies according to the law (P4.1.1.1) with ω = √γ (the parameters A and ϕ0 are
determined by the initial conditions; see the example above).

OSCILLATIONS AND WAVES
◮Energy method for determining the frequency. If the state of a physical system
undergoes repetitive variations and the quadratic function
E = 1
2 µ˙x2 + 1
2 κx2
(µ and κ are positive constants)
(P4.1.1.4)
remains constant during these variations, then x changes according to the law (P4.1.1.1)
with ω =
p
κ/µ. Indeed, differentiating (P4.1.1.4) with respect to time, we obtain the
equation µ¨x + κx = 0, which is the equation of simple harmonic oscillations. Usually, the
quantity E is proportional to the energy of the oscillatory system for small x; accordingly,
such an approach is called the energy method for determining the oscillation frequency.
◮Complex exponential and vector diagram. Using Euler’s formula eiϕ = cos ϕ+i sin ϕ,
one can treat the law of harmonic oscillations (P4.1.1.1) as the real part of a complex
exponential function, x(t) = Re ex, where
ex = eA exp(iωt),
(P4.1.1.5)
and eA = A exp(iϕ0) is called the complex amplitude of oscillations.
This technique is
especially convenient for studying systems described by linear equations, since, in this
case, the real and imaginary parts are transformed independently of each other.
The harmonic law (P4.1.1.1) can be obtained as the projection on the x-axis of a
radius vector of length A that uniformly rotates counterclockwise with a constant angular
velocity ω from an initial angular position ϕ0; in this case, the angle made with the axis x
varies by the law ϕ = ϕ0 + ωt. This technique is called the method of vector diagrams; it
is especially convenient for the composition of harmonic oscillations. With this technique,
the addition of functions is replaced by the graphical addition of vectors; note that the
projection of the sum of vectors is equal to the sum of their individual projections.
◮Composition of harmonic oscillations of a single direction. The sum of two har-
monic oscillations of the same frequency with amplitudes A1 and A2 and the initial phases
ϕ1 and ϕ2 is a harmonic oscillation of the same frequency, whose amplitude and initial
phase can be found by the method of vector diagrams (Fig. P4.1):
A2 = A2
1 + A2
2 + 2A1A2 cos(ϕ2 – ϕ1),
tan ϕ0 = A1 sin ϕ1 + A2 sin ϕ2
A1 cos ϕ1 + A2 cos ϕ2
.
The parallelogram spanned by the vectors rotates with angular velocity ω as a rigid body.
The phase difference of oscillations with the same frequency does not vary in time; such
oscillations are said to be coherent. If ϕ2 – ϕ1 = ±2mπ, the amplitude is a maximum,
A = A1 + A2, and if ϕ2 – ϕ1 = ±(2m + 1)π, the amplitude is a minimum, A = |A1 – A2|.
Figure P4.1. Composition of oscillations by the method of vector diagrams.
In the vector addition of incoherent oscillations with different frequencies, the parallel-
ogram spanned by the vectors deforms with time and the magnitude of the resultant vector

and its angular velocity vary, and hence the composite motion is not a harmonic oscilla-
tion. However, oscillations with close frequencies (∆ω = |ω1 – ω2| ≪max{ω1, ω2}) can be
assumed to be approximately coherent on a sufﬁciently short time interval as compared to
the time of coherence τcoh = 2π/∆ω. The composite oscillation will occur with the angular
frequency ω = (ω1 + ω2)/2 and an amplitude periodically varying between A1 + A2 and
|A1 –A2| with period 2π/∆ω. Such oscillations are called beats, ωb = ∆ω is the beat angular
frequency, and the period of variation in the amplitude Tb = 2π/ωb is the beat period. If
A1 = A2 = A, then
x(t) = 2A cos

The beats are an example of modulated oscillations, or oscillations obeying the har-
monic law (P4.1.1.1) with one of the parameters (amplitude, frequency, or phase) varying
periodically in time with a period signiﬁcantly greater than that of the base oscillations.
Amplitude, frequency, and phase modulation techniques are distinguished.
An arbitrary periodic oscillation with period T can be expanded into a Fourier series
in simple harmonic oscillations with frequencies ωn = n(2π/T). Such a representation is
called the harmonic analysis of the periodic oscillation. The Fourier series terms are called
the ﬁrst (fundamental), second, third, etc. harmonics of the periodic oscillation. Aperiodic
oscillations have, as a rule, a continuous spectrum of frequencies and can be represented as
a Fourier integral in harmonic oscillations of all frequencies ranging from zero to inﬁnity.
All periodic oscillations have a line (discrete) spectrum of frequencies, but oscillations with
a line spectrum are not necessarily periodic.
◮Composition of mutually perpendicular harmonic oscillations. If a point moves in
the plane so that its projections on the x- and y-axes oscillate harmonically, this motion
is said to be the composition of mutually perpendicular simple harmonic oscillations.
If the oscillations in either coordinate have equal frequencies, x = A1 cos(ωt + ϕ1) and
y = A2 cos(ωt + ϕ2), the path of the point is an inclined ellipse:
x2
A2
1
+ y2
A2

– 2xy
A1A2
cos(ϕ2 – ϕ1) = sin2(ϕ2 – ϕ1).
Such a motion is called an elliptically polarized oscillation. If ϕ2 – ϕ1 = (2m + 1)π/2, the
ellipse axes coincide with the coordinate axes. If ϕ2 –ϕ1 = mπ, the ellipse degenerates into
a straight line segment; such a motion is called a linearly polarized oscillation. The point
can move clockwise (for 2mπ < ϕ2 – ϕ1 < 2mπ + π) or counterclockwise; in these cases,
one speaks about the right or left elliptic polarization.
Two-dimensional harmonic motions with frequencies ω1 and ω2 occur along curves
called Lissajous ﬁgures. If the frequency ratio ω1/ω2 is a rational number, these ﬁgures are
closed curves. Closed Lissajous ﬁgures can be used to determine the frequency ratio.
P4.1.2. Free Undamped Oscillations
◮Free mechanical oscillations with a single degree of freedom. If the displacement
of a conservative mechanical system from a stable equilibrium is described by a single
parameter x, then for small x, the potential energy has the form
Ep(x) = 1

OSCILLATIONS AND WAVES
It follows that small oscillations of the system about its stable equilibrium occur harmon-
ically. The potential energy of an oscillatory system is usually reckoned from the stable
equilibrium (Ep = 0 for x = 0). For small x, the generalized force, Fx = –dEp/dx, is pro-
portional to the displacement: Fx = –κx. (If x is a linear coordinate, then the generalized
force is the force projection on the displacement direction, and if x is an angle, then Fx is
a torque.)
If a mechanical system is a point particle or a translationally moving body, then the
kinetic energy of the system has the form Ek = 1

m¨x = –κx
(P4.1.2.2)
has the same form as that of a mass attached to a spring. For small x, the restoring force
acting on the body (i.e., the force that tends to bring the body back to the equilibrium) is
called the quasielastic force, Fx = –κx, and the coefﬁcient κ is the effective spring constant.

Figure P4.2. To example 1.
Example 1. If the level of a liquid in an U-shaped tube (Fig. P4.2) is displaced by a distance x from
equilibrium, the potential energy of the liquid increases by ∆mgx = (ρSx)gx = (2ρgS)x2/2 (where ρ is the
liquid density and S is the tube cross-section) and the kinetic energy is equal to m˙x2/2. Hence the angular
frequency of oscillations is equal to ω =
p
2ρgS/m.
Example 2. In one of the early models of the hydrogen atom (the Thomson model), it was assumed that
the positive charge is uniformly distributed across a ball of radius R, equal to the atomic radius, and the electron
was placed at the center of the ball. Let us ﬁnd the frequency of electron oscillations when it is displaced
from the equilibrium. If r denotes the displacement, the attraction force is equal to Fr = –ke2r/R3 (see
Subsection P3.3.2). Hence, for small displacements, r < R, there occur harmonic oscillations with frequency
ω =
p
ke2/(mR3).

Figure P4.3. Physical pendulum.
Example 3. Physical pendulum. The physical pendulum is a rigid body whose horizontal immovable
axis of rotation does not pass through its center of mass. For the pendulum deviation from equilibrium by
a small angle α (Fig. P4.3), there arises a moment of the gravity force equal to M = –mgd sin α (d is the
distance from the center of mass to the axis of rotation), which tends to return the pendulum to equilibrium.
The equation of rotational motion of the rigid body has the form: I ¨α = –mgd sin α, where I is the moment
of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation. For small deviation angles α ≪1, this equation becomes
the equation of harmonic oscillations with respect to the angle α: ¨α + (mgd/I)α = 0. The pendulum angular
frequency and oscillation period are equal to
ω =
p
mgd/I,
T = 2π
p
I/(mgd).
For example, for a homogeneous rod of length l suspended by one of its ends, we obtain I = ml2/3, d = l/2,
T = 2π
p
2l/(3g). The reduced length L of a physical pendulum is the length of a mathematical pendulum
such that its period T = 2π
p
L/g is equal to the period of the given physical pendulum: L = I/(md). (For a
homogeneous rod suspended by an end, we have L = 2l/3.) The point lying at a distance L from the suspension
axis on the straight line passing through the center of mass perpendicularly to the suspension axis is called the
center of oscillation. If a body is suspended on the axis passing through the center of oscillation parallel to the
previous axis, then the oscillation period, and hence the pendulum reduced length do not change.
In this example, the generalized force is the moment of gravity force. The frequency can also be determined
by the energy method if the dependence of the potential energy on the deviation angle is found: Ep =
mgd(1–cos α) ≈mgdα2/2. For the total energy, we obtain E = 1
2 I ˙α2 + 1
2 mgdα2, which implies the oscillation
frequency.
◮Isochronism of harmonic oscillations. The harmonic oscillations are isochronous,
which means that their period is independent of the amplitude. The point is that, in the
equation of harmonic oscillations ¨x + γx = 0, the coefﬁcient γ has dimension s–2 and
it follows from the dimension considerations that the period cannot depend on anything
else except for γ. The oscillations of large amplitude cease to be harmonic and hence
isochronous; the period begins to depend on the amplitude. But in several special cases,
even small oscillations may not be isochronous. This occurs if the second derivative in
formula (P4.1.2.1) for the expansion of Ep in x is zero. Such a situation arises, for example,
in the case where a load ﬁxed at the middle of an unstrained spring with ﬁxed ends deviates
in the direction perpendicular to the spring. For small x, the potential energy is proportional
to x4, and the equation of motion has the form: ¨x+ γx3 = 0. In this case, the dimension γ is
m–2s–2, and the oscillation period T ∼γ–1/2A–1 is inversely proportional to the amplitude.
◮Oscillatory systems with several degrees of freedom. If the system displacement
from the stable equilibrium is characterized by N independent parameters x1, . . . , xN,
then for an arbitrarily small initial deviation, the dependence xi(t) cannot be harmonic
oscillations. But any motion can be represented as the sum of N special motions called
normal vibrational modes, in each of which, all xi harmonically oscillate with a angular

distinct.
Example 4. Coupled pendulums. We consider two equal mathematical pendulums of length l whose
loads are connected by an unstrained spring of rigidity k (Fig. P4.4). The normal modes of this system can be
guessed because of the system symmetry. Harmonic oscillations arise for: (a) equal deviations of the pendulums
to the same side (x1 = x2) and (b) for the equal deviations of the pendulums to opposite sides (x1 = –x2). In
the ﬁrst case: ω1 =
p
g/l, in the second case: ω2 =
p
(g/l) + (2k/m). If only the ﬁrst pendulum deviates to a
side, which corresponds to the initial conditions (x10, x20) = (A, 0), then such a deviation can be represented as
the sum of two normal deviations: (A, 0) =

law: x2 = 1

∆ω ≈ω1 k/m
g/l , and, under superposition of two oscillations with close frequencies, one observes beats (see
Subsection P4.1.1): in the time Tb/2 = π/∆ω, the second pendulum is in full swing, and the ﬁrst pendulum
stops, and after the same time period, the energy is again transferred to the ﬁrst pendulum, etc.
Figure P4.5. Electric oscillatory circuit.
◮Free oscillations in electric circuit. The oscillatory circuit is a closed circuit consisting
of a capacitor of capacitance C and a coil of inductance L (Fig. P4.5). The processes in
an oscillatory circuit, just as in alternating current circuits, are studied in the domains of
frequencies, where the quasi-stationarity condition is satisﬁed (see Subsection P3.10.1);
that is, ω ≪c/l, where l are typical dimensions of the system (in this approximation, in
particular, one can neglect the circuit radiation). For the chosen rule of bypassing the circuit,
the Ohm law for the subcircuit containing the inductance and for the capacitor charge has
the form: IR = (ϕ1 – ϕ2) + , where R is the resistance of the wires and the coil. Taking
the relations I = ˙q (that holds the chosen signs), q = (ϕ2 –ϕ1)/R, and
= –L ˙I into account,
we obtain IR = –(q/C) – L ˙I. This implies that

The current in the circuit varies according to the harmonic law with amplitude Im = ωqm

expression for the circuit energy:
W = LI2

taking into account that I = ˙q. The energy is transformed from electric into magnetic
and conversely: at the moment of maxima capacitor charge, it is equal to W = q2
m/(2C),
and when the capacitor charge is zero, it is equal to W = LI2
m/2. The relations for the
time-dependence of the magnetic and electric energy are the same as for the kinetic and
potential energies in the case of mechanical oscillations.
P4.1.3. Damped and Forced Oscillations
◮Damped oscillations. If the energy is lost in an oscillatory system, then the oscillation
amplitude decreases with time.
If the losses of energy of mechanical oscillations are
determined by the force of viscous friction, which is proportional to the velocity for small
velocities, then the equation of motion m¨x = –κx–b˙x can be reduced to the linear differential
equation
¨x + 2β ˙x + ω2
0x = 0,
(P4.1.3.1)
which is called the equation of damped oscillations. Here β = b/(2m) is the damping
coefﬁcient, ω0 is the angular frequency of natural oscillations without damping (as β →0).
It is convenient to seek the solution of this equation in exponential form: ex = eA exp(–γt).
Substituting this into (P4.1.3.1), we obtain the quadratic equation for γ: γ2 – 2βγ + ω2
0 = 0.
If β < ω0, then the equation has two complex conjugate solutions: γ1,2 = β ± i
p
ω2
0 – β2,
which result in equal answers, and hence one can take any of them. Applying the Euler
formula (see Subsection P4.1.1), we obtain
x(t) = A0e–βt cos(ωt + ϕ0),
ω =
q
ω2
0 – β2,
(P4.1.3.2)
where the constants A0 and ϕ0 are determined by the initial conditions.
The function (P4.1.3.2) takes the zero value in equal time intervals T = 2π/ω (Fig. P4.6),
and hence ω and T are conditionally called the frequency and period of damped oscillations.
If β ≪ω0, then on each time interval T ≪τ ≪β–1, the oscillations can be assumed to
be harmonic, and A(t) = A0 exp(–βt) has the meaning of the oscillation amplitude on this
interval. Therefore (for any β < ω0), A(t) is said to be time-dependent amplitude of damped
oscillations. In time τ = β–1, the amplitude decreases by e times. The amplitude decrease
per a period, equal to A(t)/A(t + T) = exp(βT), is called the damping decrement, and the

A(t)
A(t + T) = βT
(P4.1.3.3)
is called the logarithmic damping decrement. The quantity 1/λ is the number of total
oscillations in which the amplitude decreases by a factor of e.
If β > ω0 (strong damping), then the quadratic equation for γ has two real positive roots:
γ1,2 = β ±
p
β2 – ω2
0, and the general solution
x(t) = A1 exp(–γ1t) + A2 exp(–γ2t)
(P4.1.3.4)
is of non-oscillatory (anharmonic) character (the parameters A1 and A2 are determined by
the initial conditions).
◮Damped electric oscillations. Comparing the equation of oscillations in an electric
circuit (P4.1.2.4) withthe equationof dampedoscillations (P4.1.3.1), we ﬁndthe expressions

(P4.1.3.5)
The condition for weak damping λ ≪1 has the form: R ≪

L/C (the quantity
√
L/C is
called the wave resistance of the circuit).
◮Forced mechanical oscillations. The motion of a system under the action of an external
periodic force is called the forced oscillations, the external force itself is called the driving
force. From the equation of motion m¨x = –κx–b˙x+Fx(t), we obtain the equation of forced
oscillations:
¨x + 2β ˙x + ω2
0x = f(t),
(P4.1.3.6)
where the notation f(t) = Fx(t)/m is used.
The general solution of such an inhomogeneous (with nonzero right-hand side) equation
can be represented as the sum of a particular (that is, any) solution of the inhomogeneous
equation and the general solution of the homogeneous equation. (The general solution must
contain free parameters, which permit satisfying any initial conditions.) The homogeneous
equation is the equation of damped oscillations, its general solution (formulas (P4.1.3.2)
and (P4.1.3.4)) exponentially decays in time τ ∼1/β. The damping of natural oscillations
means the termination of the regime of transient oscillations and the beginning of the regime
of steady-state forced oscillations whose characteristics are determined by the functions f(t)
and the parameters β, ω0, but are independent of the initial conditions.
We seek a particular solution of equation (P4.1.3.6) in the form of steady-state oscilla-
tions. Because any periodic force Fx(t) can be expanded in the Fourier series, it is natural
to study the steady-state forced oscillations under the action of a harmonic driving force
f(t) = Fx(t)/m = (F0/m) cos Ωt. We seek them in the form of harmonic oscillations of the
same frequency but with a phase shift:
x = A cos(Ωt + ϕ).

For Ω= 0, we obtain ϕ = 0 and A = F0/(mω2

displacement of the body following the slowly varying force. For Ω→∞, we have A →0
and ϕ →–π. The graphs of A(Ω) and ϕ(Ω) are given in Fig. P4.7.
◮Resonance. The maximum value of the amplitude of steady-state oscillations is attained
at the resonance frequency Ωr =

ω2
0 – β2 is the angular frequency of damped oscillations. For
β ≪ω0, the dependence A(Ω) contains a sharp and narrow maximum at the resonance
frequency, which in this limit is close to the natural frequency of the system oscillations.
This phenomenon is called resonance, and the curves of the dependence A(Ω) are the
resonance curves. The maxima characteristics (for β ≪ω0) are: the ratio of Amax to the
static deviation A(0) is equal to ω/(2β) = π/λ (λ is the logarithmic damping decrement);
the quantity Q = π/λ is called the quality factor of the oscillatory system. The width of the
resonance curve at the level Amax/
√
2 is equal to the damping coefﬁcient: ∆Ω≈β.
The amplitude of steady-state oscillations of the velocity attains the maximum value
F0/(2mβ) at Ω= ω0. At resonance, the velocity oscillations coincide in phase with the
driving force oscillations.
We consider the process of establishing the oscillations in the case where the frequency
driving force is equal to the resonance frequency (it is assumed that β ≪ω0). If, at the
initial moment, the point displacement and velocity are zero, then in the limit under study
the initial conditions are satisﬁed by the solution:
x ≈Amax sin ωt – Amaxe–βt sin ωt = Amax
 1 – e–βt
sin ωt.
The obtained dependence is shown in Fig. P4.8. For t ≪1/β, the amplitude increases
proportionally to time: A(t) ≈Amaxβt = = F0t/(2mω); the damping at this stage does
not exhibit any inﬂuence. We note that the time of establishment of oscillations is large
compared with the period: 1/β ≫2π/ω. If the frequency Ωis close to ω, but differs from it,
then the motion at the initial stage t ≪1/β is the sum of oscillations with close frequencies.
If the condition ω ≫|Ω– ω| ≫1/β is satisﬁed, then in the process of establishment of
oscillations, profound beats can be observed (the oscillation amplitude increases almost up
to 2Amax and decreases almost to zero with period Tb = 2π/|Ω– ω|).
Resonance under arbitrary periodic action. If the period of external action Fx(t) is multiple of the
period of the system natural oscillations T = 2π/ω, then the expansion of Fx(t) in the Fourier series can contain
the harmonic with frequency ω. If the Q-factor of an oscillatory system is large, then harmonic oscillations of
a noticeable amplitude can arise under the action of this harmonic. For example, the swings can be slightly
pushed at each swing (then the ﬁrst harmonic has the resonance frequency), or at the next nearest swing (then
the second harmonic will work), etc.

(the current amplitude is the same on all the elements, because they are connected in series).
The coefﬁcients of proportionality between the current and voltage amplitudes are called
as follows: xC =1/(ΩC) is thecapacitive reactance and xL =ΩL isinductive reactance. The
quantity x = xL–xC is called the reactance, R is the resistance (the energy is dissipated only
at this resistance), and the quantity z =

R2 + x2 is the impedance of the circuit. Formula
(P4.1.3.10) can be rewritten as I0 =
0/z, tan ϕ1 = x/R. All these relations become rather
obvious if the vector diagrams are used (Fig. P4.9). At resonance, the reactance vanishes,
x = 0, that is, the voltage oscillations on the capacitance and inductance compensate for
each other and the circuit impedance becomes purely resistive, z = R. If the resistance of a
circuit is zero, R = 0, the impedance is called purely reactive, with z = x.

P4.2. Wave Processes
P4.2.1. Elastic and Acoustic Waves
◮Basic deﬁnitions. If a continuum has elastic properties, then the motion of points
at one place of the medium (at the source) results in propagation of this motion with a
certain velocity in the form of an elastic wave. The medium wave motion is described by
the function ξ(r, t) determining the medium particle displacement from equilibrium r at
time t. (The medium particle is a sufﬁciently small macroscopic element of the medium,
that is, an element containing rather many atoms and molecules.) An elastic wave can
propagate in three-dimensional medium, two-dimensional medium (elastic membrane),
and one-dimensional medium (elastic rod, stretched rigid ﬁber, air column). The simplest
wave mode is the plane wave, where the function ξ = ξ(x, t) varies only in one direction
and depends on the coordinate x. If in this case the vector ξ is perpendicular to the wave
propagation direction, then the wave is said to be transverse, and if it is parallel, then the
wave is said to be longitudinal.
A medium is said to be homogeneous if all its points are equivalent, isotropic if all
the directions in it are equivalent, elastic if all forces arising in it depend only on the
displacement (strain), and linear if the forces are proportional to the strains. In an absolutely
elastic medium, the wave mechanical energy is not dissipated (is not transformed into
internal energy). If the medium has only volume elasticity, then only longitudinal waves
can propagate in it (liquid, gas); if it also has elasticity of form, then transverse (shear)
waves are also possible. In the linear medium, the wave propagation is described by linear
differential equations, and the superposition principle holds: if two independent sources
cause two different waves ξ1(r, t) and ξ2(r, t), then the common action of the sources results
in the wave ξ(r, t) = ξ1(r, t) + ξ2(r, t). The same statement holds for a single source whose

522
OSCILLATIONS AND WAVES
motion can be decomposed into two motions. Since any function of time can be represented
as the Fourier integral in harmonic functions, it follows that the wave motion of a linear
medium can be decomposed into harmonic waves. Through an arbitrary point of a harmonic
wave, one can draw a single surface of constant phase, which is called the wave surface.
The wave surface coinciding with the leading edge of the wave perturbation is called the
wave front.
◮Equation of plane harmonic wave. If the displacement in the source obeys the law
ξ(0, t) = ξm cos ωt, then at the points with the coordinate x, the displacement occurs
according to the same law, but with the delay by x/v, where v is the wave propagation

(P4.2.1.1)
where λ = 2πv/ω = vT is wavelength, and k = ω/v = 2π/λ is the wavenumber. The
wavelength is the shortest distance between points exhibiting synchronous oscillations (the
phase difference is ∆ϕ = 2π); the wavelength is the spatial period of the harmonic wave
proﬁle at any time moment. The phase difference between arbitrary points of the wave
is equal to ∆ϕ = 2π(x2 – x1)/λ. In equation (P4.2.1.1), it is assumed that the energy
losses at the distance x are negligibly small; a small energy dissipation can be taken into
account empirically introducing the factor exp(–γx), where γ is coefﬁcient of wave damping,
in (P4.2.1.1). If we introduce the wave vector k directed perpendicularly to the wave front
in the direction of wave propagation, then (P4.2.1.1) takes the form invariant under the
choice of the coordinate system:
ξ(r, t) = ξm cos(ωt – k ⋅r),
eξ(r, t) = eξmei(ωt–k⋅r).
(P4.2.1.2)
The last form of the traveling wave equation is based on the Euler formula; only the real part
Reeξ has a physical meaning. If the wave velocity is independent of the frequency (there is
no dispersion), then the plane wave perturbation of any form propagates without distortion.
◮Spherical and cylindrical diverging waves.
If the wave propagates from a point
(spherical) or linear (cylindrical) source isotropically in all directions, then the wave surfaces
have the respective shape of spheres or circular cylinders. In these cases, the equations of
diverging waves without energy losses have the form:

where r =

surface area increases; the energy conservation law demands that the energy ﬂux remain
constant (we recall that the energy of oscillations is proportional to the squared amplitude;
see also below).

wave ξ(r, t) satisﬁes the equation

which is called the wave equation. If the harmonic wave velocity is independent of the
frequency (the dependence of ω on k is linear, that is, the dispersion is absent), then any
superposition of plane waves satisﬁes the same equation.
The converse statement also
holds: if the equation of motion of a particle of the medium can be reduced to (P4.2.1.3),
then any wave perturbations of this medium propagate with the velocity v.
In the one-dimensional case, the general solution of equation (P4.2.1.3) has the form
ξ = f1(x – vt) + f2(x + vt),
(P4.2.1.4)
where f1 and f2 are arbitrary (differential) functions. The ﬁrst term describes propagation
of the plane signal f1(x) with velocity v without changes in the form in the direction of
positive x, and the second term describes propagation of the signal f2(x) with velocity v in
the direction of negative x.

Hence, the wave propagation speed in an elastic rod is equal to v =

media propagate with the same speed.
Example 2. Stretched string. A transverse wave can propagate along a string whose tension is equal
to T. Suppose that the string proﬁle at a given time moment is described by the function ξ(x, t) (Fig. P4.10).
We obtain the equation of motion of the medium particle of dimension ∆x under the assumption of low-slope
wave: ∂ξ/∂x ≪1. The vertical projection of the tensile force is equal to F⊥(x) = T sin α ≈T(∂ξ/∂x) (α
is the string inclination angle); the vertical force acting on the medium particle of dimension ∆x and mass
∆m = ρlin∆x S is equal to F⊥(x + ∆x) – F⊥(x) (ρlin is the linear string density). The equation of motion of
the medium particle has the form

hence the wave propagation velocity in the string is equal to v =

Example 3. Air column in a cylinder. The volume elasticity of a gas (or any thermodynamically simple
medium) is characterized by the bulk modulus of elasticity K = –V (∂p/∂V ) = ρ(∂p/∂ρ). The value of K
depends on the condition under which bulk deformation of the gas occurs. For sound oscillations (ν >16 Hz), one
can neglect the heat exchange between distinct medium particles and assume that K is the adiabatic modulus of

is ∆p(x) = – limV →0 K(∆V/V ) = – lim∆x→0 K[Sξ(x +∆x)–Sξ(x)]/(S∆x) = –K(∂ξ/∂x); the force acting
on the air medium particle of dimension ∆x and mass ∆m = ρ ∆x S is equal to ∆F = [∆p(x)–∆p(x+∆x)]S.

and hence the wave propagation velocity in the air cylinder is equal to v =

(These
expressions remain valid for any thermodynamically simple medium such as a real gas or a liquid.) For the
sound waves in an ideal gas, we obtain: K = γp, v =

γp/ρ =
p
γRT/µ, where γ is the adiabatic exponent
(see Subsection P2.2.3).
◮Volume density of energy. Energy ﬂux density.

potential energies at a given point of the plane elastic longitudinal wave are equal to

wp = E

.
For a traveling wave of arbitrary form ξ = f(x ± vt), we have the relation (∂ξ/∂t)2 =
v2(∂ξ/∂x)2. Taking into account that v2 = E/ρ for the elastic longitudinal wave, we see
that the densities of the kinetic and potential energies at each point of the traveling wave
are equal to each other. This statement holds for traveling waves of any nature. In the case
of a harmonic plane wave (P4.2.1.1), the wave energy per unit volume and its time average
have the form:
w = wk + wp = ρω2ξ2
m sin2(ωt – kx),
〈w〉= 1
2 ρω2ξ2
m.
The energy ﬂux density (the Umov vector) at a given point of the traveling wave is
equal to
U = wu,
(P4.2.1.5)
where u is the rate of the energy transfer. In the dispersionless medium, u = v, where v is the
wavepropagationvelocitycontainedin the wave equation (P4.2.1.4). For harmonic traveling
wave (P4.2.1.1), u = v, where v is the phase velocity of the wave: v = ω/k. The energy
transferred by the traveling wave through the site ds per unit time (the energy ﬂux) is equal
to dΦ = U ⋅ds. The magnitude of time-average value of the Umov vector (it is sometimes
called the wave intensity) for a harmonic plane wave is equal to I = |〈U〉| = v〈w〉= 1
2 ρvω2ξ2
m.
In the case of an arbitrary (including the standing) longitudinal elastic wave, one can use
the expression for U in terms of the power of elastic forces (per unit area):
U = –σ ∂ξ
∂t ,
where σ = E ∂ξ/∂x is the stress at a given point of the medium (see example 1). For the
transverse wave in the string (example 2), the energy ﬂux has a similar form:
P = –F⊥
∂ξ
∂t = –T ∂ξ
∂x
∂ξ
∂t .
◮Dispersion. Group velocity. The dependence of the harmonic wave velocity on the fre-
quency or the wavelength is called the dispersion, and the medium where this phenomenon
is observed is called the dispersion medium. In the dispersion medium, the nonsinusoidal
traveling pulse changes its shape in the process of motion, because the harmonic waves
contained in its Fourier expansion move with different velocities. The energy transfer rate
contained in expression (P4.2.1.5) for the Umov vector is determined in this case as the
velocity of motion of the center of pulse (or as the velocity of the point at which the strain
is maximum) and is called the group velocity of the wave packet (in contrast to the phase
velocity of the sinusoidal wave v = ω/k). A ﬁnite pulse of dimension ∆x is called the wave
packet because its expansion in the Fourier integral in harmonic waves contains a ﬁnite

group of waves whose spectral width is determined by the relation: ∆x ∆k ∼1. The group
velocity of such a pulse is equal to
ugr = dω
dk = v – λ dv
dλ ,
(P4.2.1.6)
where v = ω/k is the phase velocity of the wave. The points of maxima (the “humps”)
inside the wave packet move with the phase velocity v, and the envelope of these maxima
moves with the velocity ugr (Fig. P4.11).
The notion of group velocity of a wave packet can be used only if its spectral width is
small so that the dependence ω(k) can be assumed to be linear.
To illustrate this, we consider the wave that is the superposition of at most two traveling waves with close
frequencies and equal amplitude:
ξ = ξm cos[(ω + ∆ω)t – (k + ∆k)x] + ξm cos[(ω – ∆ω)t – (k – ∆k)x]
= 2ξm cos(∆ω t – ∆k x) cos(ωt – kx).
This shows that the wave envelope has the spatial period ∆x = 2π/∆k and propagates with velocity u = ∆ω/∆k.
Example 4. The group velocity can be both less and greater than the phase velocity. The phase velocity
of waves on the surface of a ﬂuid for long (gravitational) waves depends on the wavelength according to the
law v =
p
gλ/2π, and for short (capillary) waves, according to the law v =
p
2πσ/ρλ. Substituting this in
formula (P4.2.1.6), we see that the group velocity in the ﬁrst case is equal to ugr = v/2, and in the second, to
ugr = 3v/2. We also see that the group velocity can be strongly different from the phase velocity.
◮Wave interference.
Two waves are called coherent if, at any point of the space,
they generate coherent oscillations whose phase difference does not vary in time (see
Subsection P4.1.1). The sources of coherent waves are called coherent sources. In the case
of addition of incoherent waves, the time-average energy of the resultant oscillation is equal
to the sum of their average energies. In the case of addition of coherent waves and in the
case of particle oscillations that occur in the same or close directions, the phenomenon of
interference can be observed. Interference of two or more coherent waves is characterized
by increased amplitudes of the resulting wave at some points of space (where wave crests
meet) and decreased amplitudes at other points (where a crest of a wave meets a trough of
another wave). If a point lies at the distance r1 from one of the coherent sources and at the
distance r2 from the other, then the phase difference between the oscillations at this point
is equal to
∆ϕ = (ϕ10 – kr1) – (ϕ20 – kr2) = 2π r2 – r1
λ
– (ϕ20 – ϕ10) = 2π ∆
λ – ∆ϕ0.
Here ∆ϕ0 is the phase difference between the source oscillations, ∆= (r2 – r1) is the wave
path difference. The maximum conditions for the resultant oscillations is ∆ϕ = ±2πm,
the minimum condition is ∆ϕ = ±2π

(minimum).
Example 5. We consider two linear coherent sources of cylindrical waves that are at the distance λ/2
from each other. For the points at far distances from sources, the wave propagation difference is determined
only by the direction of radiation and is equal to ∆= 1
2 λ cos θ (Fig. P4.12). In the case of in-phase sources, the
radiation is weakened in the direction θ = 0 and reinforced in the direction θ = π/2, and in the case of sources
oscillating in opposite phase (∆ϕ0 = π), the situation is opposite.
Figure P4.12. To example 5.
◮Standing waves. Natural oscillations. An important example of interference is the
standing wave, arising in addition of two equal plane traveling waves propagating towards
each other:
ξ = ξm cos(ωt – kx) + ξm cos(ωt + kx) = 2ξm cos kx cos ωt.
(P4.2.1.7)
The oscillation amplitude A(x) = 2ξm cos kx of the wave points varies periodically from
zero (at the wave nodes) to 2ξm (at the wave antinodes). The distance between neighboring
nodes is equal to λ/2. The oscillations of points between two nodes occur in phase, but
the oscillations of points on the opposite sides of the node occur in opposite phase. At
the nodes, the velocity oscillation amplitude is zero, but the oscillation amplitude of the
strain ∂ξ/∂x takes the maximum value. Conversely, at the antinodes, the strains are zero,
but the velocity oscillations have the maximum amplitude. The time-average energy has
the same value at all the points of the standing wave. The Umov vector is zero at both the
nodes and antinodes and periodically changes its direction at the intermediate points.
If the end of the rod in oscillatory motion is rigidly ﬁxed, then the displacement of the
rod end points is zero; if the rod end is free, then the strain is zero. In the ﬁrst case, the
boundary condition has the form ξ|x=0 = 0, and in the second case, the form ∂ξ/∂x|x=0 = 0,
where the value x = 0 corresponds to the rod end. (The same conditions arise for the air
oscillations in a cylindrical tube in the case of closed or open end of the tube. For transverse
oscillations of the stretched string considered in example 2, only the ﬁrst version in which
the string end is ﬁxed is possible.) If all the points of a ﬁnite rod oscillate harmonically
with a single frequency, then such a motion is called a natural or free oscillation of the
rod. If an inﬁnitely long rod is mentally cut at the point where the standing wave node is
located, then the boundary condition for the ﬁxed end is satisﬁed; and if the cut is at the
point of antinode, then the boundary condition for the free end is satisﬁed. Hence the free
oscillations of a rod of length l in the case of two free or two ﬁxed ends must satisfy the
condition l = 1
2 mλ or ωm = πmv/l (the spectrum of natural oscillations, m = 1, 2, . . . ),

natural oscillation with the least possible frequency is called the fundamental oscillation,
all the other natural oscillations are overtones or harmonics.
◮Traveling wave reﬂection. We consider reﬂection of traveling pulse from the rod end.
If the rod end is ﬁxed, then the boundary condition ξ|x=0 = 0 and the initial conditions (one
incident pulse) are satisﬁed by the superposition of the incident pulse and the pulse of just
the same form traveling towards it in which the point displacements have opposite direction
(Fig. P4.13a). But if the rod end is free, then the boundary condition ∂ξ/∂x|x=0 = 0 is
satisﬁed by the pulse of displacements of the same sign traveling towards it (Fig. P4.13b).
In the case of a harmonic traveling wave, the reﬂection from the free end occurs without
changes in the phase, and a standing wave with antinode at the rod end is formed in this
case. The reﬂection from the ﬁxed end occurs with the phase shift by π, and a standing
wave with node at the rod end is formed.
◮Doppler effect in acoustics. In motion of the wave source and (or) the wave receiver
with respect to the medium where the wave propagates, the registered frequency differs from
the one under study (if the distance between the source and the receiver varies). We direct
the axis x from the receiver to the source. If the source radiates sound with frequency ν0
and moves along the axis x with velocity vS

If the receiver is ﬁxed, then precisely this frequency is registered. If the receiver moves

P4.2.2. Electromagnetic Waves
◮Properties of electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic wave is the propagation of
perturbations of an electromagnetic ﬁeld in empty space or in a medium without sources.
The existence of electromagnetic waves follows from the Maxwell theory (see Subsection
P3.11.1), which states that an alternating electric ﬁeld generates an alternating magnetic
ﬁeld and an alternating magnetic ﬁeld generates an alternating electric ﬁeld. In the case of
a homogeneous isotropic medium, the Maxwell equation have the form
1) curl E = – ∂B
∂t ,
3) div D = 0,
2) curl H = ∂D
∂t ,
4) div B = 0,
(P4.2.2.1)
where D = εε0E and B = µµ0H. For the electromagnetic ﬁeld depending only on the
coordinate x, we obtain the equations:
–µµ0

∂x ,
εε0
∂Ez

∂x .
(P4.2.2.2)
In this case, the equations for longitudinal components have the form ∂Ex/∂x=∂Ex/∂t=0,
∂Hx/∂x = ∂Hx/∂t = 0, that is, all longitudinal components of the ﬁeld are constant
quantities.
It is easy to see that the transverse components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld satisfy the
wave equation:
∆Ey = εε0µµ0
∂2Ey
∂t2 ,
∆Hz = εε0µµ0
∂2Hz
∂t2
(the quantities Ez and Hy satisfy the same equations). It follows from these equations that
the electromagnetic perturbations in a medium propagate with the velocity
v =
1
√εε0µµ0
=
c
√εµ = c
n ,
(P4.2.2.3)
where c = 1/√ε0µ0 ≈3 × 108 m/c is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum,
and n = √εµ is the index of refraction of the medium.
We consider the plane electromagnetic wave of a certain frequency (the monochromatic
plane wave) propagating along the axis x: Ey = E0y cos(ωt–kx), Ez = E0z cos(ωt–kx+ϕ).
From (P4.2.2.2) we ﬁnd that Hy = –
p
εε0/µµ0 Ez and Hz =
p
εε0/µµ0 Ey. These formulas
permit one to obtain the following properties of the plane traveling electromagnetic wave:
1) The electromagnetic wave is transverse.
2) Since E ⋅H = 0, it follows that E ⊥H. The vectors (E, H, k) form the right triple of
vectors; that is, the direction of the vector E × H coincides with the direction of the wave
propagation.
3) The values of the vectors E and H at each time moment are related as √εε0 E =
√µµ0 H (E = vB).
The character of the wave polarization depends on the phase difference ϕ. For ϕ = ±mπ,
the wave is plane polarized; that is, the vector E oscillates in one plane (this plane is called
the wave polarization plane), and for another phase difference, the wave is elliptically
polarized, or (for ϕ = ±(m + 1
2 )π and for E0x = E0y), the wave is circularly polarized (see
Subsection P4.1.1).

energy is calculated by the formula
w = 1

In the case of a monochromatic plane polarized wave, we have

For the wave circularly polarized (E0y = E0z = E0, ϕ = 1
2 π ± πm), the energy density
does not vary in time: w = εε0E2
0.
The energy ﬂux density in an electromagnetic wave is determined by the Poynting vector
(see Subsection P3.11.2):
S = wv = E × H,
which points in the direction of the wave propagation. The intensity of an electromagnetic
wave is the magnitude of the time-average of the Poynting vector:
I = |〈S〉| = v〈w〉.
◮Wave pressure. According to the theory of relativity, the energy ﬂux density of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld in a vacuum means that there exists a momentum of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. The volume density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum is equal (in magnitude)
to w/c, the momentum ﬂux density is equal to S/c, and its modulus is equal to w. In the
case of wave reﬂection or absorption, there is a variation in the wave momentum, which
must manifest itself in the wave pressure on an obstacle. In the case of normal reﬂection of
a plane wave, the pressure is equal to p = 〈w〉(1+R), where R is the fraction of the reﬂected
energy (the coefﬁcient of reﬂection). Within the framework of electrodynamics, the wave
pressure is explained by the action of the wave magnetic ﬁeld on the current excited on
reﬂecting surface by the wave electric ﬁeld.
◮Radiation of plane current. The simplest example of a system creating alternating
ﬁelds and radiating a plane electromagnetic wave is the time-alternating plane current.
We consider the current in the plane (x, z) directed along z and varying by the law iz =
i0 cos ωt (Fig. P4.15). It follows from the second of Maxwell’s equations in integral form
(see Subsection P3.11.1) that the displacement current vanishes, and hence, for a narrow
loop surrounding the current, we have Bx(0, t) = ± 1
2 µ0i0 cos ωt, where the minus sign
corresponds to the ﬁeld on the right of the plane (for small y > 0), and the plus sign
corresponds to the ﬁeld on the left of the plane. Using the relation between E and B in
a plane wave, we obtain Ez(0, t) = –AE cos ωt, where AE = 1
2 µ0ci0 = i0/(2ε0c). The
electric ﬁeld is directed opposite to the current, its work over the current is negative;
that is, the current gives energy to the wave. The ﬁeld far from the plane has the form
E(y, t) = –AE cos(ωt – ky) for y > 0 and E(y, t) = –AE cos(ωt + ky) for y < 0.

Figure P4.15. Radiation of plane current.
◮Wave radiation by moving charges. The radiation of electromagnetic waves occurs
in accelerated motion of charges. An electric dipole whose dipole moment rapidly varies
in time (a Hertz oscillator or a Hertz vibrator) is a simple radiating system. Since the elec-
tromagnetic perturbations propagate with velocity c, the ﬁeld of radiation at the distance r
at time t is determined by the motion of charges in the dipole at time t′ = t – r/c. The
radiation ﬁeld has a rather simple form only in the wave zone; that is, at distances that are
large compared with both the dipole dimensions and λ = cτ, where τ is the typical time
of the dipole moment variation (in the case of harmonic oscillations, λ is the wavelength).
The electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the wave zones are perpendicular to the radius vector r

The solution of the Maxwell equations in the form or retarded potentials (see Subsection P3.11.1) permits
one to write the expressions for the potentials at the point r at time t. For example, the vector potential has the

also be performed for the electric ﬁeld.
The ﬁelds decrease with the distance according to the law 1/r. The Poynting vector in

exhibits forced oscillations with amplitude A = eE0/(mω2) (the equation of motion of the electron has the form
m¨x = –eE0 cos ωt). One can see that the radiation power of a free electron in the ﬁeld of an electromagnetic
wave is independent of the frequency, and the scattering cross-section (the ratio of the radiation power to the
incident wave intensity) is equal to

Another situation arises if, in the electromagnetic wave ﬁeld, there is an atomic electron the natural frequency ω0
of whose oscillations is large compared to the frequency of the incident (light) wave. Then the oscillation
amplitude (see Subsection P4.1.3) is equal to A = eE0/(mω2
0); that is, it is almost independent of ω. In
this case, the radiation power and the light scattering cross-section are proportional to ω4, which qualitatively
explains the blue color of the sky (the blue color scattering is stronger).

OSCILLATIONS AND WAVES
◮Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves in vacuum. The main distinction from
the acoustic Doppler effect (see Subsection P4.2.1) is that there is no reference system
associated with the medium, where the wave propagates. Therefore, the relation between
the radiation frequency ν0 (measured in the source reference system KS) and the registered
frequency ν (measured in the receiver reference system KR) can depend only on their
relative velocity. Assume that in KR, the source moves with velocity v directed at the
angle θ made with the radius vector drawn from the receiver to the source. Repeating the
argument given in Subsection P4.2.1, we obtain
ν =
eν0
1 + (v/c) cos θ ,
where eν0 is the source frequency measured by the clock in the system KR. Passing to the
intrinsic time (eT0 = γT0, or eν0 = ν0/γ; see Subsection P1.10.2), we obtain
ν =

also the transverse Doppler effect is observed (for the source motion perpendicular to the

It is useful to consider the Doppler effect from a different viewpoint. Since the oscillation phase at a given
point of the wave (ωt – k ⋅r) must be invariant under the transition to another reference system, the (k, ω/c) is
a four-vector of zero length (k2 – ω2/c2 = 0). If, in the frame KR, the axis x is directed parallel to the source
velocity vS (Fig. P4.18), then, in this reference system, we have kx = –k cos θ = –(ω/c) cos θ. Using the Lorentz
transformations to pass to the frame KS, we obtain: ω0/c = γ[(ω/c) – kx(v/c)], or ω0 = γ[ω + ω(v/c) cos θ].
Expressing ω, we obtain (P4.2.2.6). This method allows us, by writing the Lorentz transformations for the
wave vector k, to obtain formulas for the light aberration phenomenon, which is important in astronomy.
◮Scale of electromagnetic waves. Depending on the way of radiation and registration
of electromagnetic waves, several ranges with conditional (overlapping) boundaries are
distinguished in the scale of the frequency ν or of the wavelengths in a vacuum λ = c/ν:
1. The radio waves (λ > 0.05 mm).
2. The optical (light) radiation (10 nm < λ < 1 mm):
a) the infrared (IR) radiation (770 nm < λ < 1 mm),
b) the visible light (380 nm < λ < 770 nm),
c) the ultraviolet (UV) radiation (10 nm < λ < 380 nm).
3. The X-rays radiation (0.01 pm < λ < 100 nm).
4. The gamma radiation (gamma rays) (λ < 0.1 nm).

Optics
P5.1. Geometric Optics. Radiometry
P5.1.1. Geometric Optics
◮Fundamental laws of geometric optics. Optics studies the electromagnetic radiation
of optic (light) range (see Subsection P4.2.2) as well as phenomena arising in its propagation
in space and under interaction with matter. Geometric optics does not consider the wave
character and polarization of light radiation and deals with notions of light rays pointing
out the direction of light propagation and narrow light beams formed by light rays.
The fundamental laws of geometric optics are listed below.
1. Law of rectilinear light propagation.
2. Law of independence of light beams. The energy in each beam propagates indepen-
dently of other beams; illumination of the surface on which several beams are incident, is
equal to the sum of illuminations created by each beam separately.
3. Law of light reﬂection. The reﬂected ray lies in incidence plane, formed by the
incident ray and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence; the angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reﬂection. All the angles are counted from the normal.
4. Law of light refraction. The refracted ray lies in the plane of incidence; the ratio of
the sine of the angle of incidence α1 to the sine of angle of refraction α2 depends on the
wavelength but is independent of the angle of incidence (Snell law):
sin α1
sin α2
= n21 = n2
n1
.
(P5.1.1.1)
The constant quantity n21 is called the relative index of refraction of the second medium
with respect to the ﬁrst one, which is equal to the ratio of (absolute) indices of refraction
of each of the media (of indices of refraction of the medium with respect to a vacuum).
From the viewpoint of wave optics, the absolute index of refraction shows by what factor
the phase velocity of the light wave of a given frequency is less than the velocity of this
wave in a vacuum:
v = c/n,
n = √µε ≈√ε
(P5.1.1.2)
(see Subsection P4.2.2). If n2 < n1, then for α1 > αc, where sin αc = n21 < 1, one observes
the total reﬂection of light; that is, the refracted ray is absent. If the light ray propagates in
a medium with index of refraction gradually varying along an axis (in a layered medium),
then it is convenient to use formula (P5.1.1.1) in the form n sin α = const, where α is the
angle with this axis. One can see that α varies gradually, which means that the ray is
bending.
The laws of geometric optics listed above must be supplemented with the principle of
reversibility of light beams.
◮Limits of applicability of geometric optics. The laws of geometric optics act where
the phenomena of interference, diffraction, and polarization are insigniﬁcant. This happens
535

536
OPTICS
when the wave amplitude and its ﬁrst spatial derivatives vary just slightly over the wave-
length. These conditions are violated at the shadow boundary, near the geometric point of
convergence of light rays (focus), where light travels past narrow diaphragms, and also light
propagates through media with rapidly varying index of refraction or with strong absorption.
For example, when a light beam travels past a circular diaphragm of diameter d (for holes
of irregular shape, d is understood as the minimum transverse dimension), it spreads out
due to diffraction at a distance l ∼d2/λ; one can use the laws of geometric optics at small
distances compared to l.
◮Huygens principle and Fermat principle. The laws of geometric optics are closely
related to the Huygens principle (Huygens wave construction) and the Fermat principle.
The Huygens principle is based on abstract-wave concepts and, at each point, permits
constructing an auxiliary wave surface the normal to which shows the light ray direction.
To construct the wave surface at time t+∆t, one considers all the points of the wave surface
at time t as sources of secondary light waves. The envelope of spherical wave surfaces of
secondary waves forms a new wave surface of the principal wave.
The Fermat principle is one of the examples of variational principles that play an impor-
tant role in physics. It states that the time of light propagation along the true trajectory is
extremal (usually, minimum or maximum) compared with all the virtual nearby trajectories.
More precisely, this time does not vary (in the ﬁrst order of magnitude) for a small distortion
of the trajectory.
The Huygens and Fermat principles permit obtaining the fundamental laws of geometric
optics but do not permit leaving its limits.
◮Optical path length. It is convenient to express the time of light propagation through
a medium with a variable index of refraction in terms of the optical path length L:
t =
Z 2
1
dl
c/n = L
c ,
L =
Z 2
1
n dl.
(P5.1.1.3)
This notion is also useful in studying the interference.
◮Images in optical systems. One of the important problems of geometric optics is the
construction of images formed by optical systems and the study of their properties. An
image is the point of intersection of ray transmitted through an optical system. Images are
real (the rays converge after leaving the system) and virtual (emergent rays diverge from
the virtual point of intersection of their virtual continuations). The system of reﬂecting
and refracting spherical (and plane) surfaces perpendicular to an axis forms the image of
a point source by rays incident at small angles to the axis (paraxial approximation). The
system axis is called the principal optic axis. The point of convergence of rays parallel
to the axis is called the focus of the system; the plane perpendicular to the axis and drawn
through the focus is called the focal plane.
Like the images, the foci can be real and
apparent. Additionally, one introduces the notion of “apparent source” denoting the point
of intersection of imaginary continuations of the converging rays incident on the system.
In what follows, we use the important property of images: the optical path lengths of all
rays from the source to the image are the same; that is, the optical system does not change
the path difference of rays.
The basic elements of optical systems are the simple optical systems: plane and spherical
mirrors, plane and spherical refracting surfaces, and thin lenses. The image formed by each
of these elements is the source for the subsequent element.
When considering a simple system, one counts all the distances from the point of
intersection of this system with the principal optical axis. The distance from this point to
the source is denoted by s, the distance to the image, by s′, and the distance to the focus,

P5.1. GEOMETRIC OPTICS. RADIOMETRY
537
by f (focal distance). To real sources, images, and foci there correspond positive values, to
apparent sources, negative values.
Below are formulas relating s, s′, and f for simple optical systems.
1) Spherical mirror of radius R:
1
s + 1
s′ = 1
f .
(P5.1.1.4)
The focal distance is equal to f = R/2, for a concave mirror, R > 0, for a convex mirror,
R < 0.
2) Plane mirror forms the image of a point source located behind the mirror symmet-
rically to the source. Formally, (P5.1.1.4) holds for it as R →∞; that is, s′ = –s (to a real
source there corresponds a virtual image, to an apparent source, there corresponds a real
image).
3) Spherical refracting surface of radius R with the relative index of refraction n21 =
n2/n1:
1
s + n21
s′
= n21 – 1
R
.
For a convex surface, R > 0, for a concave surface, R < 0.
4) Plane refracting surface is obtained from the spherical surface in the limit as
|R| →∞:
s′ = –n21s.
5) Thin lens bounded by spherical surfaces of radii R1 and R2. Relation (P5.1.1.4)
holds, the focal distance of a thin lens is calculated by the formula:
1
F = (n21 – 1)
 1
R1
+ 1
R2

.
The radii R1, R2 are assumed to be positive for convex surfaces and negative for concave
surfaces. The quantity D = 1/F is called the focal power; it is measured in dioptres (dpt),
with 1 dpt = 1/m.
The theoretical limit of the image dimensions and the resolving power of optical systems
is determined by the light diffraction.
P5.1.2. Radiometry and Photometry
Radiometry studies the measurement of electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths, in-
cluding visible light. Photometry studies the measurement of light within the wavelength
range visible by the human eye.
◮Characteristics of radiation in space. The radiation power emitted by a radiation
source at a given point of space in a particular direction is characterized by the radiant
intensity, I:
dΦ = I cos θ ds dΩ.
(P5.1.2.1)
The radiation power dΦ is called the radiant ﬂux; it is the energy transferred per unit time
through the area element ds by the light rays contained in the solid angle dΩ. The angle θ
is the angle between a selected direction and the normal to the area element. The product
cos θ ds is called the apparent size of the area element in the speciﬁed direction. The volume
density of radiant energy, u = dW/dV , is calculated as
u = 1
c
Z
I dΩ.
(P5.1.2.2)

538
OPTICS
In the case of isotropic radiation, u = 4πI/c. For the intensity I and the density u, one can
obtain the spectral decomposition in frequencies or wavelengths:
u =
Z ∞
0
uν dν =
Z ∞
0
uω dω =
Z ∞
0
uλ dλ.
Equating the energy contained in the mutually corresponding spectral intervals, one can
ﬁnd the relation between distinct spectral representations. For example, by setting uν |dν| =
uλ |dλ| with λ = c/ν taken into account, we obtain
uν =
 c
ν2

uλ.
Similarly, we can obtain the decomposition in two mutually perpendicular polarizations.
◮Light and energy characteristics. The above-introduced energy characteristics are
used to obtain an objective description of the radiation. The photometric or light character-
istics take account of the sensitivity of the eye to the optical radiation. The radiant power
is measured in watts and the photometric unit corresponding to it is called the luminous
ﬂux and is measured in lumens (lm). To pass to the luminous ﬂux, it is necessary to mul-
tiply the radiant power by the luminous efﬁcacy η (measured in lm/W), which is equal to
η0 = 625 lm/W for the wavelength λ0 = 555 nm and to η0Vλ for other wavelengths, where Vλ
is the curve of visibility, or relative spectral sensitivity of the eye (Vλ = 1 for λ = 555 nm and
decreases to zero approaching the boundaries of the optical range). Recalculations from ar-
bitrary radiant power to luminous ﬂux can be performed by the formula Φlu = η0
R
ΦλVλ dλ.
Recalculations from other energy characteristics to luminous characteristics and conversely
can be performed similarly (for example, from the radiation intensity to the light intensity).
◮Characteristics of radiation source. The point source is characterized by the source
energy power determined as the radiant power in a given direction per unit solid angle:
dΦ = J dΩ.
The luminous characteristic — that is, the source luminous intensity— is
determined in terms of the luminous ﬂow. The radiant power unit, candela, is one of the
basic SI units (1 lm = 1 cd × 1 sr, where “cd” stands for the candela and “sr” stands for the
steradian). If there is no absorption or scattering of radiation, then the radiation intensity
in the same direction at the distance r from the source is equal to
I = J
r2 .
For area sources—that is, for radiating surfaces—the notion of energy radiance in a
given direction Bθ is introduced (the luminous characteristic is the brightness). The energy
power emitted by a surface element ds is equal to
dJ = Bθ cos θ ds
or
dΦ = Bθ cos θ ds dΩ,
(P5.1.2.3)
where θ is the angle between the normal to the radiating surface and the radiation direction.
The source whose Bθ is independent of the direction is called a Lambertian source. A
Lambertian source of any shape appears uniformly bright (for example, the solar disk). The
radiant exitance R (the luminous characteristic is the luminous exitance) is determined as
the total radiant power in the solid angle 2π per unit area of a radiating surface:
R =
Z
Bθ cos θ dΩ.
(P5.1.2.4)
For a Lambertian source, R = πB.

P5.2. WAVE PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
539
◮Irradiance. The radiant energy ﬂux per unit area of illuminated surface is called the
irradiance and denoted E. The corresponding light quantity is called the illuminance and
measured in luxes (lx), with 1 lx = 1 lm/m2. If a point source radiation is incident at an
angle θ with the normal, then
E = J
r2 cos θ.
Figure P5.1. To calculations of the irradiance created by an area source.
The irradiance created by a luminous surface S on a site of the irradiated surface ds′
is equal to the sum of contributions of all the sites ds. The solid angle from which ds′
is viewed at ds is equal to cos θ′ ds′/r2 (Fig. P5.1). For the luminous ﬂux radiated into
this solid angle, we have Bθ cos θ ds(cos θ′ ds′/r2). Since cos θ ds/r2 is equal to the solid
angle dΩfrom which the radiating site is viewed at the point of irradiance, it follows that
dE = Bθ cos θ′ dΩ.
Example. Calculate the irradiance created by a Lambertian source of disk shape irradiating a small area
located on the disk axis oriented perpendicularly to the axis (Fig. P5.2).
Figure P5.2. Irradiance of a surface element ds′ by a Lambertian disk.
Solution. The solid angle element bounded by θ′ and θ′ + dθ′ is equal to dΩ= 2π sin θ′dθ′.
After
integration, we obtain E = πB sin2 θ0, where θ0 is the cone half-opening angle from which the disk is viewed
from the irradiated area element.
P5.2. Wave Properties of Light
P5.2.1. Interference of Light
◮Coherence of light waves.
In the superposition of light waves with a very high
frequency of oscillations, one can observe only the time-average energy of oscillations,
which is characterized by the oscillation intensity I ∼〈E2〉. When adding two oscillations
E = E1 +E2, we obtain I = I1 +I2 +I12, where I12 = 2〈E1 ⋅E2〉is called the interference term.
If I12 = 0, then the light beams are said to be incoherent. The waves polarized in mutually
perpendicular directions are always incoherent. Monochromatic waves are coherent only if
their phase difference is constant (that is, their frequencies coincide) and if they are parallel
polarized (or almost parallel polarized). In superposition of such waves,
I = I1 + I2 + 2
p
I1I2 cos ∆ϕ,
where ∆ϕ is the oscillation phase difference at a given point.
In the special case for
I1 = I2 = I0, we have I = 2I0(1 + cos ∆ϕ). For in-phase oscillations, I = (√I1 + √I2 )2, for
anti-phase oscillations, I = (√I1 – √I2 )2.

540
OPTICS
◮Interference of two waves. In superposition of two plane waves E1 = E10 cos(ωt–k1⋅r)
and E2 = E20 cos(ωt – k2 ⋅r), we obtain ∆ϕ = (k1 – k2) ⋅r. The surfaces of constant phase
difference are planes perpendicular to the vector k1 –k2. The distance between neighboring
planes with maximum intensity is equal to
∆x =
2π
|k1 – k2| =
π
k sin(α/2) =
λ
2 sin(α/2) ,
(P5.2.1.1)
where α is the angle between the vectors k1 and k2. For small α, we obtain ∆x ∼λ/α. If
in the region of wave overlap there is a plane screen parallel to k1 –k2, then one can observe
parallel alternating dark and light fringes on it.

Figure P5.3. Interference of two closely located linear sources.
In superposition of spherical waves from two in-phase point sources, the maximum
condition for the intensity of the mth order has the form r2 – r1 = mλ (this is the equation
of a hyperboloid of rotation whose axis passes through the sources). If a screen is placed
parallel to this axis, we obtain light and dark fringes of hyperbolic shape. If the distance to
the screen D is large compared to the distance d between the sources, then, at the screen
center, we obtain equidistant almost parallel fringes. The distance between the fringes is
the same as in the Young experiment, where the interference is created by two parallel linear
sources of coherent light. If x is the distance from a screen point to its center (Fig. P5.3),
then r2
1 = D2 +(x+d/2)2, r2
2 = D2 +(x–d/2)2, and for d, x ≪D, we obtain the optical path
difference ∆= r1 – r2 ≈xd/D ≈αx, where α ≈d/D is the angle from which the source
is viewed at the screen center. The intensity varies from 4I for ∆= αx = mλ to zero for
∆= (m + 1
2 )λ. The distance between the fringes is equal to ∆x = λ/α = λD/d.
◮Fraunhofer approximation.
At a large distance from two in-phase linear sources
(r1, r2 ≫d), one can write r2 – r1 ≈d sin θ, where θ is the angle between the normal
to the plane of sources and the direction of the interference observation (the Fraunhofer
approximation). The oscillation amplitudes in interfering waves are assumed to be equal;
that is, I = 2I0[1 + cos(kd sin θ)]. The interference maxima are observed at the angles
satisfying the relation sin θ = mλ/d.
Let us specify at what distance from the sources the Fraunhofer approximation can be
used. We express r2 according to the cosine theorem:
r2 = (r2
1 + d2 – 2dr1 sin θ)1/2
(the angle in the triangle is equal to 90◦– θ), expand it up to the terms of the second order
in d/r1, and obtain
r2 – r1 ≈d sin θ + d2
2r1
– d2
r1
sin2 θ.
The correction can be neglected if d2/r1 ≪λ. We see that the Fraunhofer approximation
works in the case where the distance r from the observation point to the sources satisﬁes
the relation
r ≫d2
λ .

Figure P5.4. Composition of oscillations from several sources.
We note that this inequality is stronger than the simple condition r ≫d.
◮Interference of many waves. We consider the interference of N equal in-phase sources
located on the same straight line at the distance d from one another. At a large distance from
the sources (r ≫(Nd)2/λ) in the direction of θ, the composition of N oscillations of the
same amplitude A0 occurs, and the phase difference between the neighboring oscillations
is equal to φ = (2π/λ)d sin θ. The resultant amplitude A is obtained from the equations
(see the vector diagram in Fig. P5.4): A0 = R sin(φ/2), A = R sin(Nφ/2). Eliminating the
radius of the circumscribed circle R, we obtain
A = A0
sin(Nφ/2)
sin(φ/2) ,
I = I0
sin2(Nφ/2)
sin2(φ/2) .
(P5.1.2.3)
◮Interference from natural sources of light. The radiation of natural (thermal) sources
of light is the set of wave trains spontaneously radiated by excited atoms in their lumines-
cence; that is, when they return to normal state. The train duration is ∼10–10–10–8 c, it
contains 106–108 oscillations. Hence two different natural sources are incoherent even if a
narrow spectral band is separated in their radiation, because the oscillation phase difference
varies very fast and chaotically at each observation point. To observe the interference, it is
necessary to split the radiation of one source into two or several beams and to make them to
enter the observation point by different paths. In this case, each train interferes with itself,
and the maximum or minimum condition is simultaneously satisﬁed for all the trains of the
same frequency radiated from the same point of the source. It is convenient to introduce
optical path difference of beams
∆=
Z
n2 dl –
Z
n1 dl,
where the integration is performed over the line passed by a given beam from the radiation
point to the interference point. The maximum condition is ∆= mλ; the minimum condition
is ∆=
 m + 1


λ, where m is called the order of interference.
We present the classical examples of obtaining two coherent sources.
1. The Young experiment (mentioned above). The sunlight is incident on a very narrow
slit in the ﬁrst screen, diverges because of diffraction, and is incident on the two narrow
slits in the second screen. Again because of diffraction behind these slits, the light splits
and forms overlapping coherent beams.
2. Fresnel mirrors. The light from the brightly illuminated slit is incident on two mirrors
placed at an angle nearly equal to 180◦. The closely located virtual images of the slit form
two coherent sources.
3. Fresnel biprism. The light from a brightly illuminated slit refracts in two glass prisms
with small refraction angles that contact by their bases. As the result of refraction, two
closely located virtual images of the slit are formed.

542
OPTICS
4. Billet split lens. A collecting lens is cut into halves and the halves are slightly moved
apart. The split lens is illuminated through a narrow split parallel to the cut line. Each of
the lens halves forms its own real image of the slit.
5. Lloyd mirror. The light from a narrow slit is reﬂected from the mirror plane and
forms the virtual image of the slit. The light from the slit itself and from its image interfere.
◮The inﬂuence of the source dimensions. The spatial coherence. The optical path
difference at a given point of the screen has a deﬁnite value only in the case of a point
source. The path difference varies in transitions from point to point of the area source.
If the path difference varies by λ/2, then the maximum condition becomes the minimum
condition; that is, the interference patterns from different sites of the area source overlap
and the total interference pattern is smeared.
Figure P5.5. Inﬂuence of the source dimensions on the interference pattern.
For example, we consider a plane source. We assume that the ﬁrst of the interfering
rays is radiated by the source at an angle α1 with its normal, and the second, at an angle α2.
We assume that these rays lie in the one plane with the normal and the angles of radiation
are almost the same for all point of the source (Fig. P5.5). In transition from one end of
the source to the other, the path length of the ﬁrst ray varies by l sin α1, and that of the
second ray varies by l sin α2 (l is the dimension of the source in the plane of rays), and the
path difference varies by l(sin α2 – sin α1). The interference pattern conservation condition
(condition of spatial coherence) takes the form
l |sin α2 – sin α1| < λ/2.
Example 1. In the Young experiment, l is the slit width in the ﬁrst screen, and α1 = –α2 = b/(2L), where b
is the distance between the slits in the second screen and L ≫b is the distance between the screens; we obtain:
2l(b/2L) < λ/2; that is, l < λL/(2b).
We rewrite this formula as: b < λ/(2ψ), where ψ = l/L is the angular dimension of the source or the
divergence angle of the rays incident on the slits. For example, in the case of the sun direct illumination of
the slits, ψ ≈0.009 rad, λ ≈500 nm; that is, the distance between the slits must be less than 0.06 mm. Just
therefore, the sun light must ﬁrst be transmitted through a narrow slit.
◮Inﬂuence of the light nonmonochromaticity. Temporal coherence. A violation of the
monochromaticity of the combined waves may result in the interference pattern smearing.
We assume that the frequencies of the radiated waves lie in a narrow spectral interval ∆ω.
A strong distortion of the interference pattern occurs if the path difference ∆exceeds a
certain critical value Lc, which is called the coherence length; Lc has the meaning of the
length of the wave train radiated by the atom in a single act of radiation (we recall that
stable interference occurs when the trains in one of the separated beams are combined with
the trains corresponding to them in the other beam).
The time τc = Lc/c that is called the coherence time has the meaning of duration of the
wave train. According to general properties of the Fourier transform, the spectral width of
a wave packet is related to its duration as ∆ω ∆t ∼2π.
Example 2. The “truncated” sinusoid A(t) sin ω0t, where A =const in the interval –τ/2<t <τ/2 and A =0
outside this interval, has the Fourier transform a(ω) ∼sin[ 1
2 (ω – ω0)τ]
(ω – ω0)τ
whose width is equal to ∆ω ∼2π
τ .

P5.2. WAVE PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
543
We see that the spectral width of interference is related to the coherence duration as
∆ω ∼2π/τc. The maximum order of the spectrum, where one can observe the interference
can be estimated as N ∼τc/T = ω/∆ω = λ/∆λ. It is useful to note that the bands of
neighboring orders merge just in this order:
(N + 1)λ = N(λ + δλ)
(the trailing edge of the band of order N + 1 coincides with the leading edge of the band of
order N). The coherence length is often expressed in terms of δλ:
Lc = Nλ = λ2
δλ .
◮Interference in thin ﬁlms. We consider the interference of rays reﬂected from the
leading and trailing surfaces of a thin ﬁlm (Fig. P5.6). We assume that the wave front
is plane; that is, the source is sufﬁciently remote. Since the front of refracted wave is
Figure P5.6. Interference in light reﬂection from a thin ﬁlm.
perpendicular to the ray, it follows that ray 1 at point D and ray 2 at point D′ have equal
phases. Hence the optical path difference of rays at point D is equal to n(D′C + CD).
Moreover, λ/2 must be added to the path difference, which permits taking account of the
phase variation on π in reﬂection from a medium with a greater index of refraction (on the
air–ﬁlm interface at point D). After transformations, we obtain:

where d is the ﬁlm width, n is its index of refraction, and θ and ψ are the incidence and
refraction angles. The maximum condition for observation in reﬂected light ∆= mλ is
satisﬁed for certain wavelengths. For very thin ﬁlms, the maximum condition is satisﬁed
for one or two wavelengths from the visible region, and the ﬁlm turns out to be colored. The
maximum condition for observation in reﬂected light corresponds to the minimum condition
for observation in transmitted light (no reﬂection occurs from the air–ﬁlm interface). As
always in interference, the energy does not increase but is redistributed.
Now we consider two important cases:
1) Fringes of equal thickness. If the rays are incident at an almost constant angle, for
example, normally and the ﬁlm width varies, then the lines of constant thickness are lines
of constant path difference. In illumination by monochromatic light, these lines are visible
as dark or light fringes. In observation in white light (for ﬁlms of small thickness) the lines
are colored. The interference occurs near the ﬁlm surface (interference pattern is localized
at the surface).
2) Fringes of equal inclination. The ﬁlm thickness is constant, the illumination is by
scattered light from a remote source. Changing the angle of observation, we alternatively

obtain the maximum condition and the minimum condition. The interference pattern is
localized at inﬁnity (or in the focal plane lens). For extremely thin ﬁlms, the light can be
nonmonochromatic; the observation at a given angle separates the wavelength for which
the maximum condition is satisﬁed.
Example 3. Newton rings. If a plane-convex lens is put on the surface of a glass plate (Fig. P5.7) and
illuminated by normally incident monochromatic light, then fringes of the shape of rings of equal thickness are
observed in the air interval. The air interval thickness is equal to d ≈

◮Holography principles. Holography is used to record the volume image of an object.
The object is illuminated by laser light with a very high degree of coherence and after
reﬂection goes to a photographic plate. The information about the object shape is carried by
the dependence of the object wave phase on the coordinates along the photographic plate.
If, simultaneously with light reﬂected from the object, the photographic plate is illuminated
by a reference ray, the same as that used to illuminate the object but going directly to the
plate after reﬂection from a mirror. Then, as the result of interference, a wave is generated
whose amplitude and intensity will depend on the phase of the object wave. Since the
photographic plate blackening is proportional to the intensity, it preserves the information
about the wave phase. Illuminating the developed photographic plate by the light of the
same laser, one can reconstruct the initial signal.
Recording the interference signal in the bulk of a thick transparent photographic plate,
one obtains a volume hologram, which bears information about both the object shape and
the laser signal wavelength. If the hologram is illuminated by white light, the waves of
other frequencies cancel one another due to the interference, and the image of the object
illuminated by the monochromatic laser light arises. If three holograms from lasers with
different wavelengths are recorded in one photographic plate, then the volume colored
image appears in illumination by white light.
◮Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation. If a particle moves in a medium with velocity V exceed-
ing the phase velocity v = c/n of light in this medium, then the radiation of electromagnetic
waves arises at a certain angle with the direction of the particle motion. The elementary
explanation of this phenomenon is quite similar to the explanation of the appearance of
shock wave in motion with supersonic speed. As a particle moves, the medium atoms
excited by the particle begin to radiate. The path difference of waves radiated by excited
atoms in the direction θ from positions A and B (Fig. P5.8) is equal to
∆= v L
V – L cos θ = L
 v

.
If V < v, then for any angle θ, one can choose L such that the radiation of points A
and B cancel each other (∆= λ/2). For V > v, the same concerns any angle other than

θ0 = arccos(v/V ) (one can attain ∆= ±λ/2). But in the direction θ0, all the points radiate
wave with the same phase; that is, the radiation is mutually reinforced.
P5.2.2. Diffraction
◮Huygens–Fresnel principle. Deviations from the law of light rectilinear propagation
is called diffraction. Approximate calculations of the light intensity behind obstacles or
holes in the screen is based on the Huygens–Fresnel principle which supplements the
geometric Huygens construction (see Subsection P5.1.1) with the condition of interference
of secondary rays. According to this principle, all points of an arbitrary surface surrounding
the wave sources are sources of coherent secondary waves, and the amplitude of the
wave oscillations at an arbitrary point outside this surface can be obtained as the result
of interference of secondary waves. Usually, for such a surface one takes the wave front,
and then the sources of secondary waves are in phase. The secondary wave amplitude is
proportional to the primary wave amplitude and to the area of the surface site:
dE = E0
K(α)
r


i(ωt – kr)

ds,
(P5.2.2.1)
where E0 is the (complex) amplitude of the primary wave at the front points, α is the angle
between the radiation direction and the normal to the surface, r is the distance from the
front of secondary sources to the point of observation, and K(α) is a slowly decreasing
function (K(π) = 0).
We consider the diffraction of a plane monochromatic wave incident normally on a ﬂat
screen with a hole of various shape.
Circular hole of radius Rh. The point of observation B lies on the hole axis at a
distance l from its center (Fig. P5.9). For the surface of secondary waves we take a part of
the front in the plane of the hole. We divide the front into thin circular segments, by cutting
circles from point B on it at intervals whose lengths are l+δr, l+2δr, . . . (δr ≪λ). Since the
optical path length acquires the constant increment δr in transition from segment to segment,
it follows that the oscillation phase increments are also the same; moreover, the amplitudes
of oscillations from separate circular segments, which are calculated by formula (P5.2.2.1),
also coincide. Indeed, from r2 = R2 + l2 we obtain RδR = rδr and δS/r = 2πδr = const
(δS = 2πRδR). Hence the vector diagram of combined oscillations (Fig. P5.10) has the
form of a slowly twisted spiral (with slow decrease in K(α) taken into account). From
the symmetry consideration, one can conclude that the spiral converges to the center of
the circle. The sum of the entire spiral corresponds to the free propagation of light in the
absence of the screen.
The part of the surface from center to the points, where r1 = l + λ/2, is called the ﬁrst
Fresnel zone, the part of the surface from the edge of the ﬁrst zone to r2 = l +λ is the second
Fresnel zone, etc. One can see that if only the ﬁrst Fresnel zone is open, and all the others

546
OPTICS
are closed by a screen, then the oscillation amplitude is twice greater than that without the
screen, and the intensity is greater by the factor 4. If the ﬁrst two zones are open, then the
amplitude and intensity at point B are close to zero, etc. Conversely, if a small number of
central Fresnel zones is closed by the screen, then this hardly affects the oscillation intensity
at point B, it is almost the same as without the screen (this paradoxical fact is known as the
“Poisson spot”).
If an obstacle of complicated shape is prepared to close the next nearest Fresnel zones
(all even zones or all odd zones), then the intensity increases many times at the point of
observation. Such an instrument focusing the light like a lens is called a zone plate and
ﬁnds numerous applications.

We ﬁnd the radius of the mth Fresnel zone from the Pythagorean theorem r2 = R2 + l2,
substituting r = l + ∆(where ∆≪l is the path difference between the hole edge and the
hole center):
R(∆) =
√
2l∆.
(P5.2.2.2)
If ∆= mλ/2 is substituted, we obtain the radius of the mth Fresnel zone: Rm =

We also present the formula for the case of incidence at the hole of a spherical wave radiated by a point
source lying on the hole axis at the distance a from its center:
Rm =

As a →∞, this expression becomes (P5.2.2.2).
The number of Fresnel zones opened by the hole is equal to m = R2
h/lλ.
Hence
for l ≪R2
h/λ, there are many open Fresnel zones and the light intensity at the point of
observation slightly differs from the intensity of the incident wave; that is, the diffraction
effects at the hole axis are weak (the geometric optics approximation works). In the converse
limit l ≫R2
h/λ, only a small part of the ﬁrst Fresnel zone is open; that is, all the oscillations
at the point of observation are combined in one phase (the Fraunhofer approximation).
For a circular hole, it is more difﬁcult to calculate the diffraction for off-axis points of
observation. We will revisit this problem below considering it for the case of Fraunhofer
diffraction. Unlike a circular hole, it turns out that the solution of the diffraction problem
for all observation points is possible for a long slit-shaped hole.
Slit-shaped hole of width b. The point of observation B lies at a distance l from the screen. In this case,
the front must be divided not into circular but into thin rectilinear segments (Fig. P5.11) of the same width δx.
The main difference is that the segment areas are proportional not to R δR but simply to δx. In this case, just as

before, we have the identity r2 = x2 +l2, with x δx = r δr, and hence δr = x δs/r, and the phase increment from
segment to segment increases with the distance from point O. This results in that the radius of curvature of the
vector diagram gradually decreases and it acquires the shape of spiral called the “Cornu spiral” (Fig. P5.12).
The values of the parameter v = x
p
2/(lλ) are marked on this spiral. For x ≪l, the path difference is equal
to ∆= r – l ≈x2/2l, and hence ∆= v2 λ
4 (v = 1 corresponds to ∆= λ/4 and v = 2 corresponds to ∆= λ; see
Fig. P5.12). The distance between ﬁnite points F1 and F2 of the spiral is equal to the amplitude A0 of oscillations
without the obstacle, or to the amplitude of the incident wave. If the slit edges are at the distances x1 and x2
from point O, then we calculate the corresponding values v1 and v2, obtain the corresponding points on the
spiral, and, connecting them, determine the amplitude. Thus, one can obtain the diffraction pattern at the slit not
only at the screen center but also aside the center. The case b ≪
√
lλ corresponds to the Fraunhofer diffraction
(a small part of the spiral is open); the case b ≫
√
lλ corresponds to the geometric optics approximation. In
this case, near the slit edges, one observes the diffraction pattern corresponding to diffraction at the half-plane
(Fig. P5.13); precisely opposite the slit edge (point P), the amplitude OF2 is equal to half the amplitude of the
incident wave A0 (intensity is four times less than I0), and the width of the diffraction spreading is ∼
√
lλ.
Using the Fresnel zone method, one can study the diffraction pattern at a slit graphically
using the Cornu spiral obtained numerically. A simple analytic description of diffraction at
a slit can be obtained in the Fraunhofer approximation.
◮Fraunhofer diffraction at a slit. Fraunhofer diffraction is diffraction in parallel rays,
where the phase difference of secondary waves radiated from different points of the wave
front segment under study can be found under the assumption that they are parallel. In
this approximation, the diffraction pattern becomes simpler, and one can calculate the
light intensity at different points of the screen. The Fraunhofer approximation acts in the
following two cases: (i) if the diffracted light rays are collected by a lens in its focal plane
or (ii) if the screen is separated from the diffraction hole by a sufﬁciently large distance
r ≫R2/λ, where R is the source dimension (see the discussion of the Fraunhofer condition
in Subsection P5.2.1, formula (P5.2.1.2).

Figure P5.14. Fraunhofer diffraction at a thin slit.
In the Fraunhofer approximation, we calculate the diffraction of a plane monochromatic
wave at a slit of width b. We consider only the normal incidence of a wave on a screen with
a slit; in this case, all the slit points are sources of secondary in-phase waves. We divide the
plane slit into a large number N of equal narrow strips (Fig. P5.14). The light amplitude
from each of the strips is equal to E0/N, where E0 is the amplitude of light radiated by
the slit in the direction θ = 0 (in this case, all the strips radiate in-phase light). In the case
of radiation in the direction at an angle θ with the normal, the radiation phase difference
between the neighboring strips is equal to δϕ = (2π/λ)(b/N) sin θ, the phase difference
between the extreme strips is equal to ϕ = (2π/λ)b sin θ = Nδϕ. Using expression (P5.2.1.3)
for the interference of N sources (Subsection P5.2.1), we obtain the amplitude for the slit
radiation in the direction θ (sin δϕ must be replaced by δϕ):
E1(θ) = E0

where

(P5.2.2.3)
The radiation intensity is equal to I1 = I0 sin2(ϕ/2)/(ϕ/2)2, the typical vector diagrams
are shown in Fig. P5.15. The minima condition for the radiation has the form:
b sin θ = mλ
(m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . ).
(P5.2.2.4)
the maxima condition is b sin θ ≈(m + 1
2 )λ (m = 1, 2, . . . ). The maxima of intensity are
to one another as I0 : I1 : I2 : · · · ≈1 : (1.5π)2 : (2.5π)2 : · · · . The maximum order of the
spectrum is determined by the condition m ≤b/λ.
Figure P5.15. Angular distribution of radiation intensity and the vector diagrams for the Fraunhofer diffraction
at a slit.
◮Fraunhofer diffraction at a circular hole. In the case of diffraction at a circular hole,
the intensity distribution has the form of concentric dark and light circles around the central
light spot. The intensity distribution for small angles θ with hole axis is expressed in terms
of the Bessel function of the ﬁrst order: I = I0J2
1(πDθ/λ), where D is the hole diameter. In
outward appearance, the angular distribution of the intensity slightly differs from the case
of diffraction at a slit; the ﬁrst minimum corresponds to the angle θ1 = 1.22 λ/D.

P5.2. WAVE PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
549
The angle θ1 can be treated as the angle of diffraction expansion of the light beam. The
beam spreading is weak at distances l satisfying the condition: lθ1 ≪D or l ≪D2/λ. This
inequality is a condition of the geometric optics applicability (see Subsection P5.1.1).
◮Rayleigh criterion. Resolving power of optical instrument. When two nearby points
are observed in an optical instrument (lens, telescope), their images on the screen are small
diffraction circles. It is conditionally assumed that the image points are indistinguishable
if the distance between them is so small that the central maximum of one of the circles
coincides with the ﬁrst minimum of the other circle (Rayleigh criterion). Hence the angular
resolution of such optical instruments (with an open diaphragm of diameter D) is given by
the formula
θmin = 1.22 λ
D .
This limit of an instrument possible resolution is imposed by the wave nature of light and
cannot be overcome by any technical improvements.
◮Diffraction grating.
The diffraction grating is a sequence of large number N of
equal parallel slits (Fig. P5.16). The width of each slit is denoted by b, and the distance
between the corresponding points (for example, centers) of neighboring slits, which is
Figure P5.16. Diffraction grating.
called the diffraction grating period, is denoted by d (d = l/N, where l is the grating
width).
In the direction θ, each slit radiates light whose amplitude E1 is determined
by expression (P5.2.2.3). The phase difference between the neighboring slits is equal to
δ = (2π/λ)d sin θ, and to calculate the ﬁnal amplitude, one can again use formula (P5.1.2.3)
for the sum of oscillations of N independent sources:
E = E1
sin(Nδ/2)
sin(δ/2) ,
I = I1
sin2(Nδ/2)
sin2(δ/2) ,
where
δ = 2π d
λ sin θ.
The principal maxima of the diffraction grating are determined by the condition
d sin θ = mλ.
(P5.2.2.5)
At the principal maxima, the phase difference between the neighboring slits equals 2πm
and the oscillations from all slits are in phase. The vector diagram is a straight line of
length NE1. In the direction of the principal maxima, the radiated wave intensity I = N 2I1
is completely determined by the radiation intensity of a separate slit in this direction. If the
principal maximum is near the minimum of I1(θ) determined by the condition b sin θ = mλ,

550
OPTICS
then this maximum is suppressed. The maximum order of the spectrum is determined by
the condition m ≤d/λ.
The diffraction pattern has N – 1 minimum and N – 2 additional maxima between each
two principal maxima. The minima are determined by the conditions d sin θ = (m+n/N)λ
(n = 1, 2, . . . , N – 1). The ﬁrst minimum is especially important because it determines
the width of the principal maximum. In the vector diagram, the ﬁrst minimum corresponds
to the phase difference between the slits 2π/N, and the vector diagram for N slits is a
closed ﬁgure, namely, a regular N-gon. One can see that the width of the principal maxima
decreases proportionally to 1/N. The intensity of additional maxima is much less than that
of the principal maximum, and it can be neglected in the case of a large number of slits.
If light is incident on the grating at an angle θ0 ≠0, then the principal maxima condition
takes the form:
d(sin θ – sin θ0) = mλ.
(P5.2.2.6)
For coarse gratings (d ≫λ), it is efﬁcient to use grazing rays (θ0 ≈π/2), for which the
principal maxima condition takes the form: d cos θ0(θ –θ0) = mλ. One can see that the role
of the effective period in this case is played by the small quantity d cos θ0.
◮Diffraction grating as a spectral device. The properties of any spectral device are
determined by its angular dispersion, free spectral range, and resolving power.
The angular dispersion is the derivative Dm = dθm/dλ, where θm is the position of the
principal maximum of mth order. It follows from the principal maximum condition that
Dm =
m
d cos θ .
The free spectral range is the maximum width ∆λ of the spectral interval for which
there still is no overlapping of the spectra of neighboring orders.
From the equations
d sin θ = m(λ + ∆λ) and d sin θ = (m + 1)λ, we have ∆λ = λ/m. One can see that to study
wide parts of the spectrum, it is necessary to use lower orders.
The resolving power is the ratio R = λ/δλ, where δλ is the least wavelength difference
that can be resolved by the spectral device. Two lines are assumed to be resolved if the
maximum of one line lies on the minimum of the other line (Rayleigh criterion). From the
equations d sin θ = (m + 1/N)λ and d sin θ = m(λ + δλ) it follows that δλ = λ/(mN); that
is,
R = λ
δλ = mN.
◮Diffraction of X-rays at a crystal. The wavelength of X-rays is comparable with
the distance between the atoms of a crystal lattice, which is a spatial diffraction grating
for incident rays. The condition of diffraction maxima consists in simultaneous satisfac-
tion of three equations (P5.2.2.6) for the three mutually perpendicular crystal axes (Laue
conditions):
d1(cos α – cos α0) = n1λ,
d2(cos β – cos β0) = n2λ,
d3(cos γ – cos γ0) = n3λ,
where α, β, γ is angles with the axes such that cos2α + cos2β + cos2γ = 1. These three
equations cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously for an arbitrarily chosen direction of the
incident ray and for a given wavelength. This means that in the case of the crystal irradiation
by monochromatic but scattered X-rays (that is, in all possible directions), there arise
diffraction maxima in quite certainly determined directions.
An analysis of the Laue
patterns thus obtained permits obtaining information about the crystal structure.
The
diffraction maxima are absent if λ/2 exceeds all the lattice periods; for visible light, the
crystal can be treated as a homogeneous medium.

P5.3. INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHT AND MATTER
551
The reﬂection of X-rays from the crystal surface can also be considered as the interfer-
ence of rays reﬂected from a system of successive atomic planes in the crystal. By analogy
with the interference in thin ﬁlms (see Subsection P5.2.1), the path difference between the
rays reﬂected from the neighboring planes is equal to 2d sin θ, where θ is the angle between
the incident ray and the atomic plane (not the normal!), and d is the interplanar distance. (We
note that the index of refraction of X-rays is almost equal to one; see Subsection P5.3.2.)
The reﬂection is observed only in the directions of the diffraction maxima satisfying the
Wulf–Bragg condition:
2d sin θ = mλ,
where m = 1, 2, . . . is the order of the diffraction maximum.
P5.3. Interaction Between Light and Matter
P5.3.1. Light Polarization. Fresnel Formulas
◮Polarized and natural light. A plane wave is said to be linearly polarized or plane
polarized if the vector E oscillates in one plane that is perpendicular to the wave front (it
is called the plane of polarization of the wave). The monochromatic plane wave is either
linearly polarized or elliptically polarized or circularly polarized (see Subsection P4.2.2).
The elliptically polarized wave is the sum of two mutually perpendicular plane waves such
that there is a phase difference between their oscillations. The natural light radiated by
heated bodies is not polarized, because the direction of the vector E oscillations at each
point varies rapidly and chaotically.
A mixture of natural and polarized light is called
partially polarized light.
The polarizer is a device at whose output the light is linearly polarized in a certain
plane called the transmission plane of polarizer. The point is that the polarizer completely
absorbs the light polarized perpendicularly to the transmission plane. If the natural light is
transmitted through a polarizer, then it becomes linearly polarized and its intensity decreases
twice (if there is no absorption in the transmission plane of the polarizer). If the linearly
polarized light of intensity I0 is transmitted through a polarizer whose transmission plane
makes an angle α with the plane of oscillations of the light wave, then the intensity of the
transmitted wave is equal to
I = I0 cos2 α
(Malus’s law). This can be explained by the fact that the linearly polarized light with
amplitude E0 is the sum of two linearly polarized waves: the wave polarized in the
transmission plane (its amplitude is equal to E0 cos α) propagates through the polarizer
without changes and the second wave is completely absorbed.
◮Reﬂection and refraction of waves. Fresnel formulas. The intensity and polarization
of the reﬂected and refracted waves depend on the incident wave polarization. We write the
boundary conditions on the interface between two media:

The subscripts τ and n denote the tangential and normal components, and the superscripts

Moreover, it is necessary to take account of the relations between the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds in the plane of the electromagnetic wave (see Subsection P4.2.2).

n1 sin α = n2 sin ψ.
Figure P5.17. Decomposition in polarizations for incident, reﬂected, and refracted waves.
Special attention is drawn to the case where the light is incident from an optically denser medium (n1 > n2)
at an angle α greater than the limit angle αc of total reﬂection (sin αc = n2/n1). In this case, k1 sin α > k2, and kd

the transmitted wave decays exponentially at the distance δ ∼1/|kd
⊥|, and the amplitude of the reﬂected wave
is equal to the amplitude of the incident wave.
The amplitudes of the transmitted and reﬂected waves depend on the polarization of the
incident wave. We present the result of the reﬂected waves:

(Fresnel formulas). Here the ﬁrst formula concerns the wave polarized in the incidence
plane (it is convenient to derive it from the boundary conditions for E), and the second
formula concerns the wave polarized in the perpendicular plane (it is convenient to derive it
from the boundary conditions for H). One can see that, for an angle of incidence satisfying
the condition α + ψ = π/2, the wave polarized in the incidence plane does not reﬂect at
all. Since sin ψ = cos α in this case, it follows that the angle of incidence at which the
reﬂected wave is linearly polarized perpendicularly to the incidence plane (the Brewster
angle) satisﬁes the relation:
tan α = n.
The qualitative explanation is that, in this case, the direction of the dipole oscillations (shown
in the ﬁgure), generated in the second media by the wave polarized in the incidence plane
turns out to be parallel to the direction of the reﬂected wave (reﬂected and refracted rays
are mutually perpendicular). But the oscillator does not radiate any wave in the direction
of its oscillations (see Subsection P4.2.2).
In the case of normal incidence, there is no difference between polarizations:
Er = Ei n1 – n2
n1 + n2
.

P5.3. INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHT AND MATTER
553
One can see that in the case of reﬂection from an optically denser medium (n2 > n1), the
oscillation phase becomes opposite (more precisely, π is added to the phase). By the way,
this property follows directly from the Fresnel formulas: for α > ψ, the oscillations change
the sign.
The ratio of the reﬂected energy to the ﬂux of the incident energy is called the reﬂection
index. In the case of normal incidence, it is equal to
R = (n1 – n2)2
(n1 + n2)2 .
(P5.3.1.1)
The transmission coefﬁcient is equal to D = 1 – R (the energy conservation law).
We note that if the index of reﬂection is equal to the ratio of the energy volume densities of the reﬂected
and incident waves: R = (Er/Ei)2, then, calculating the transmission coefﬁcient, one must take account of
both the difference in the wave velocities in different media and (for incidence at an angle) the variation in the
transverse area due to refraction: Sd/Si = cos ψ/ cos α (Fig. P5.18). Finally,
D = v2(Ed)2 cos ψ
v1(Ei)2 cos α .
(The energy ﬂux is equal to the product of the energy volume density by the wave velocity and the area of the
transverse cross-section.)
Figure P5.18. In refraction, the beam transverse cross-section is changed.
The coefﬁcients R and D depend only on the relative index of refraction n21 = n2/n1
of the two media. The index of reﬂection is usually not large; for example, for n21 = 1.5,
we obtain R = 0.04.
Example. Blooming of optical systems. The reﬂection index of glasses in optical instruments is not large
(of several percents); nevertheless, it is an important problem to decrease the reﬂection for certain wavelengths.
To this end, the surface is covered with a transparent ﬁlm with the index of refraction n′ = √n (n is the
index of refraction of glass) and of thickness λ/(4n′). The optical path difference of the rays reﬂected from
the ﬁlm surfaces is equal to λ/2 (the phase variation in reﬂection need not be taken into account, because
it occurs for each of the rays), and the indices of reﬂection from these surfaces are close to each other (see
formula (P5.3.1.1)). As a result, the light reﬂection is suppressed almost completely.
◮Optically anisotropic media. When an electromagnetic wave travels through an aniso-
tropic media, the vectors E and D are generally not parallel to each other.

relation between them is of tensor character, which means that each component of the
vector D can be expressed as a linear combination of all three components of E. There exist
three mutually perpendicular axes, called the dielectric axes of the crystal, for which D ∥E:
Di = ε0εiEi (i = 1, 2, 3). The values εi are called the principal dielectric permittivities of
the crystal. We consider only the case of uniaxial crystals for which two of the three εi
coincide (ε = ε⊥). The distinguished axis (ε = ε∥) is called the optical axis of the crystal.
If a plane wave propagates in a uniaxial crystal, then the principal plane of the crystal
is introduced, which is the plane passing through the optical axis and the vector n normal to
the wave front. It turns out that the propagation of a linearly polarized light wave depends on

554
OPTICS
the direction of its polarization. The wave polarized perpendicularly to the principal plane
is said to be ordinary. The speed of such a wave propagation v⊥= c/√ε⊥is independent of
the direction; the oscillations of the vectors E and D have the same directions; the direction
of energy propagation (i.e., the Poynting vector S = E×H) is perpendicular to the wave front.
The wave polarized parallel to principal plane is said to be extraordinary. The velocity of its
propagation depends on the angle between n and the optical axis (for the angle π/2 between
them, it is equal to v∥= c/√ε∥). The vectors E and D oscillate in different directions, and
the Poynting vector S = E × H is not perpendicular to the wave front (the normal to the
wave front is parallel to D × H). The difference between the ordinary and extraordinary
rays disappears only if the light propagation is parallel to the optical axis.

Figure P5.19. Ordinary and extraordinary rays in the case of light normal incidence on the crystal cut at an
angle with the optical axis.
If the light is incident on the crystal surface, then it splits into ordinary and extraordinary
rays that are linearly polarized perpendicular to each other and have different indices of
refraction (phenomenon of birefringence). For an extraordinary ray, only the direction of
the front propagation obeys the refraction law (see Subsection P5.1.1), but the ray itself can
leave the incidence plane. Even in the case of the ray normal incidence on a crystal cut at
an angle with the optical axis, the spatial splitting of rays occurs (Fig. P5.19). The fronts
are indicated by dashes, the optical axis is indicated by arrow. The extraordinary ray is
polarized in the plane of the drawing, the ordinary ray is polarized perpendicularly to it.
To obtain and analyze polarized light, one uses the polarization prisms (nicols) cut
at an angle with the ray propagation direction so that the ordinary ray is totally reﬂected
from the plane of the cut and propagates sidewise, while the extraordinary propagates
straightforwardly. Another method for obtaining polarized light is based on the difference
in absorption of ordinary and extraordinary rays in some matters (dichroism phenomenon).
When the light propagates through a dichroic plate (tourmaline plate, polaroid), the ordinary
ray is absorbed and the linearly polarized extraordinary ray is transmitted.
To analyze the light polarization character, one studies the intensity dependence on the
nicol orientation. If the intensity does not vary, then the light is either natural or circularly
polarized. To distinguish these cases, one uses a quarter wave plate or a compensator. The
plate thickness d is chosen so that the difference between the ordinary and extraordinary
rays ∆= ∆n d is equal to λ/4. The phase shift between mutually perpendicular oscillations
becomes either zero or π, and the circular polarization becomes the linear polarization.
◮Rotation of the polarization plane. In the case of propagation of linearly polarized
light in several matters (they are said to be optically active) the rotation of polarization
plane can occur. The rotation angle is proportional to the plate thickness: χ = αl, where
α is rotation per unit length. Depending on the rotation direction, there are right- and
left-handed matters.
An example is given by a quartz plate cut perpendicularly to the
optical axis (quartz can be either levorotary or dextrorotary). In solutions of optically active

P5.3. INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHT AND MATTER
555
matter in an inactive solvent, α is proportional to the concentration. The molecules of
active matters are antisymmetric with respect to the right- and left-handed rotation of spiral
type. The phenomenon of rotation of the polarization plane can be characterized as the
circular birefringence. The wave circularly polarized in opposite directions propagates with
different velocities; that is, the phase difference between them varies. The sum of two such
oscillations is a linear oscillation whose direction depends on the phase difference.
◮Artiﬁcial anisotropy. If many isotropic bodies are placed in a homogeneous electric
ﬁeld, they acquire uniaxial anisotropy with the optical axis oriented parallel to the electric
intensity ﬁeld (the electro-optical Kerr effect). The phase difference between the ordinary
and extraordinary rays in light propagation perpendicularly to E is proportional to the
squared electric intensity:
∆ϕ = 2πBlE2,
where l is the thickness of the matter layer and B is called the Kerr constant. Artiﬁcial
anisotropy arises in the cases where the matter molecule polarizability depends on their
orientation with respect to the ﬁeld. A similar effect arise in the case of several matters
placed in a magnetic ﬁeld (the Cotton–Mouton effect).
It is described by the relation
∆ϕ = 2πClB2.
In the case of inactive matters placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, the optical activity may
arise for light propagating parallel to the vector B (magnetic rotation of polarization plane).
The rotation angle per unit length in this case (for diamagnetic and paramagnetic materials)
is proportional to the value of the magnetic induction: α = RB, where R is called the Verdet
constant.
P5.3.2. Light Dispersion and Absorption
◮Classical model of dispersion medium.
When an electromagnetic wave propagates
through matter, the charged particles of the medium come into forced oscillatory motion.
The amplitude of these oscillations and their phase shift with respect to the wave ﬁeld
strength oscillations depend on the relation between the wave frequency ω and the fre-
quency ω0 of natural oscillations of particles (see Subsection P4.1.3). The resultant wave
perturbation can be considered as the result of interference of the original wave and the
waves radiated by the medium particles (such an approach is called the molecular optics).
But in the case of homogeneous media, it is possible to obtain the wave frequency char-
acteristics semi-phenomenologically taking account of the polarization arising due to the
particle displacement, introducing the dielectric susceptibility and permittivity depending
on the frequency, and calculating the index of refraction. The wave damping—that is,
the transformation of the energy oscillations into thermal energy—is taken into account
by introducing the semi-empirical attenuation of oscillators; then the dielectric permittivity
and the index of refraction become complex numbers.
First, we consider the medium of equal oscillators. The equation of motion of a charged
particle has the form
¨ξ + 2β˙ξ + ω2
0ξ = e
m E,
where E is the ﬁeld acting on the particle (in the optical range, only the electrons are
signiﬁcant). In rare gases, one can neglect the difference between the local and average
ﬁelds; that is, one can assume that the electrons are under direct action of the wave ﬁeld
E = E0 exp

i(ωt – k ⋅r)

. We seek the solution of the equation of motion in the form
ξ = ξ0 exp(iωt) and, after the substitution, we obtain
ξ =
e
m(ω2
0 – ω2 + 2iβω) E

556
OPTICS
(in complex representation, the phase shift is automatically taken into account). The particle
displacement results in the molecules acquiring the dipole moments p = eξ, thus leading to
the polarization P = Np (N is the particle concentration). From the relation P = ε0(ε – 1)E
we derive the complex dielectric permittivity
ε = 1 +
Ne2
ε0m(ω2
0 – ω2 + 2iβω) .
(P5.3.2.1)
The index of refraction is also complex, √ε = n – iκ, as well as the wavenumber, ek =
ω
c en = ω
c (n – iκ). Consequently, for the argument of the exponential function we have
i(ωt – ekx) = i(ωt – kx) – κ ω
c x, where k = ωn
c = ω
v , and the attenuation coefﬁcient is equal
to κ ω
c . Hence,
E = E0 exp

– κω
c x

exp[i(ωt – kx)].
(P5.3.2.2)
To ﬁnd n(ω) and κ(ω), it is necessary to equate the real and imaginary parts in ε = (n –iκ)2.
Far from the natural frequency (for |ω – ω0| ≫β), we obtain
ε = n2 = 1 +
Ne2
ε0m(ω2
0 – ω2) .
The dependencies n(ω) and κ(ω) are qualitatively shown in Fig. P5.20 (n0 is the value of n
as ω →0, which is called the static value). In the region where the absorption is not large,
the index of refraction increases with frequency (normal dispersion). In the narrow region
of strong absorption, one observes the anomalous dispersion.
Figure P5.20. Dependence of the index of refraction (upper curve) and of the wave attenuation on the frequency.
A similar situation arises near each natural frequency (ω01 and ω02 in Fig. P5.20). For
example, in the infrared region of the spectrum, the absorption and anomalous dispersion
bands related to ion oscillations are observed. The absorption bands in the ultraviolet (some-
times, in the optical) regions of the spectrum can be explained by the electron oscillations
on the atomic outer shells (the optical electrons). In the X-ray region of the spectrum, the
wave frequency ω is large compared with all natural frequencies and the dependence n(ω)
is determined by electron oscillations, which can be assumed to be free:
n2 = 1 –
Ne2
mε0ω2 .
(P5.3.2.3)
The index of refraction of X-rays is slightly different from one. The same formula holds
for a wave propagating in rareﬁed plasma containing free electrons.

P5.3. INTERACTION BETWEEN LIGHT AND MATTER
557
The phase velocity of a wave in plasma (and also to the right from the absorption band in dielectrics) turns
out to be greater than the light speed in a vacuum (n < 1). But this does not contradict the theory of relativity,
because the wave group velocity u = dω/dk (see Subsection P4.2.1) is less than c in this case. Let us verify
this fact for a wave in plasma. Using the relation k2 = ω2n2(ω)/c2 and equation (P5.3.2.3), we obtain:
c2k dk = ω dω
=⇒
ω
k
dω
dk = c2.
Hence, in this case, u = nc < c.
In the case of polar molecules (for example, of water), a wide band of anomalous
dispersion lies in the region of centimeter radio waves, where the amplitude of rotational
oscillations of dipoles tending to rotate following the ﬁeld strength strongly depends on the
frequency. Just in this region, n = √ε decreases from a large static value (for water, n0 ≈9)
to the high-frequency value (for water, n ≈1.3).
Formula (P5.3.2.1) is only valid for n close to unity, or in the regions where the difference
of the ﬁeld acting on the molecule from the average ﬁeld in the matter can be neglected. A
generalization to the case of dense ﬂuids is the Lorentz–Lorentz formula:
n2 – 1
n2 + 2 =
Ne2
3ε0m(ω2
0 – ω2) ,
which follows from the Clausius–Mossotti formula (Subsection P3.5.2). As the matter
density varies, the quantity
r = 1
ρ
n2 – 1
n2 + 2 ,
which is called the speciﬁc refraction, must remain constant.
◮Light scattering. Wave attenuation. The wave intensity decreases in a medium not
only because of the light absorption, but also because of its scattering. The scattering can
be explained by the light emission by atomic oscillators, which occurs in all directions (see
Subsection P4.2.2). But in an ideal homogeneous medium, the light scattered at molecules
located at the distance λ/2 from each other would experience the total interference damping,
and no attenuation due to scattering would occur in this case. The scattering is observed at
small foreign particle (Tyndall scattering in turbid media) and at inhomogeneities arising
due to the density ﬂuctuations (the Rayleigh scattering).
The intensityof light scatteredat inhomogeneities whose dimensions are small compared
with the wavelength is proportional to λ–4 (Rayleigh law, also see Subsection P4.2.2).
This explains the blue color of the sky (the scattered sunlight) and the yellow-red color
of the sun (the transmitted light).
The degree of polarization of the scattered natural
light depends on the angle of scattering; the light scattered at the angle π/2 is completely
polarized. The qualitative explanation is that only the oscillators whose oscillation direction
is perpendicular to the scattering direction radiate in this direction.
The scattering at
inhomogeneities large compared with the wavelength weakly depend on the frequency; this
explains the white color of clouds.
The Rayleigh scattering at the density ﬂuctuations or concentration depend on the
temperature. As the critical point is approached, the average values of ﬂuctuations increase
sharply and one observes white turbidity of the ﬂuid, which is called the critical opalescence.
The light beam attenuation in the case of not large intensity occurs by the exponential
law (the Bouger law):
I = I0e–αx,
where the wave attenuation coefﬁcient α is equal to the sum of the absorption coefﬁcient,
expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the index of refraction (see formula (P5.3.2.2)),
and the scattering coefﬁcient, which describes the wave attenuation due to scattering.

OPTICS
P5.4. Foundations of Quantum Optics
P5.4.1. Thermal Radiation
◮Equilibrium thermal radiation. The radiation of electromagnetic (radiant) energy
by a body due to the energy of chaotic (thermal) motion of its molecules is called the
thermal radiation. The properties of thermal radiation are determined by the body material
and its temperature.
If one makes a closed cavity of any material and maintains the
temperature of its walls to be constant, then the system (wall + radiation) comes to the state
of thermodynamical equilibrium, and the equilibrium thermal radiation is attained in the
bulk of the cavity. The most important characteristic of equilibrium thermal radiation is that
its properties are completely determined by the wall temperature and are independent of
their material. This statement follows from the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover,
the equilibrium thermal radiation is homogeneous and isotropic.
The main characteristics of both the radiation from a body surface and the radiation in
volume were introduced in Subsection P5.1.2. The radiation from a surface is characterized
by the radiance B and the radiant exitance R equal to the radiant energy radiated from
unit surface per unit time in all directions (that is, in the solid angle 2π). The spectral
decompositions of the radiant exitance rλ, rω, rν are also introduced, for example, R =
R ∞
0
rλ dλ; the quantities r are called the radiation capacities of a body.
The volume
radiation is characterized by the luminous ﬂux intensity I and the volume density of radiant
energy u, as well as by their spectral decompositions. In the case of isotropic radiation,
they are related as u = 4πI/c. The illumination E is determined as the total radiant power
through unit site from all directions (from the solid angle 2π); in the case of isotropic
radiation,
E = πI = 1
4 cu.
The spectral densities of illumination E are denoted by eλ, eν and eω. The recalculation
from one spectral characteristic to another is discussed in Subsection P5.1.2.
◮Absorption capacity. Kirchhoff law. The absorption capacity of a body is the fraction
of incident radiant energy absorbed by the body for a narrow interval of wavelengths or
frequencies:
aλ = dΦabs
dΦi
.
A body for which aλ = 1 in the entire spectral interval is called a black body. A black body
can be modeled by a closed cavity with a small hole; almost all the rays incident into the
cavity through the hole are absorbed as the result of multiple reﬂections from the internal
walls. A body with aλ = const < 1 (usually, aλ < 0.99) is called a grey body.
Since the equilibrium thermal radiation is in equilibrium with the surface, it follows
that for any spectral interval, the quantity of absorbed radiant energy, which is equal to
eλaλ dλ, must be equal to the quantity of the radiated energy, which is equal to rλ dλ. Since
the characteristics of the equilibrium bulk radiation are independent of the properties of a
speciﬁc body, it follows that the ratio of the radiation capacity of any body to its absorption
capacity is a universal function of the wavelength and temperature (Kirchhoff law):
rλ
aλ
= eλ(T) = 1
4 cuλ(T).
(P5.4.1.1)
Since, for a black body, the absorption capacity is equal to one, it follows that the function
on the right-hand side is precisely the radiation capacity of a black body, which we denote
by r∗
λ:
rλ
aλ
= r∗
λ(T).

P5.4. FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM OPTICS
559
One can see that the radiation capacity of a black body and its radiant exitance are in-
dependent of the method of its production; they are related to the energy volume density
as
r∗
λ(T) = 1
4 cuλ(T),
R∗(T) = 1
4 cu(T).
(P5.4.1.2)
At a ﬁxed temperature, a black body has the largest radiation capacity and radiant exitance.
For example, for a grey body with aλ = const = α, we have R = αR∗. We note that since
the equilibrium thermal radiation is isotropic, it follows that a black body is a Lambertian
source (see Subsection P5.1.2).
◮Stefan–Boltzmann and Wien laws. The radiation capacity of a black body at a given
temperature tends to zero for small and large λ and attains the maximum value for a certain
wavelength λm, which depends on the temperature. The area under the curve r∗
λ is equal
to the radiant exitance R∗(T). The application of general thermodynamical relations to
the equilibrium thermal radiation in a cavity allows one to obtain several general relations
for it. (The temperature of the equilibrium thermal radiation is assumed to be equal to the
temperature of the walls.) The Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the radiant exitance of a
black body is proportional to the fourth power of temperature:
R∗= σT 4,
(P5.4.1.3)
where σ = 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant.
To derive (P5.4.1.3), we use the expression for the pressure of isotropic radiation p = u/3 (see Subsec-
tion P2.5.1) and the formula
  ∂U
∂V

T = T
  ∂p
∂T

V –p, which is a consequence of the second law of thermodynam-
ics (Subsection P2.3.1). Substituting U = u(T)V , we obtain the equation 4u = du/dT, which implies u ∼T 4.
Moreover, from the formula for pressure and from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics
 0 = d(uV ) + 1
3 u dV

, one
can derive the adiabatic process equation for the equilibrium radiation: uV 4/3 = const. Taking into account
that u ∼T 4, we obtain V T 3 = const.
If we consider a slow adiabatic variation in a radiation volume contained in a vessel
with mirror walls and apply the Doppler effect formula to the light reﬂection from a moving
mirror (see Subsections P4.2.1 and P4.2.2), then we can prove the Wien formula:
r∗
λ = λ–5f1(λT)
or
r∗
λ = T 5f2(λT),
(P5.4.1.4)
where fi(x) are unknown functions whose form cannot be found in the framework of
thermodynamics. Similar expressions for r∗
ω have the form
r∗
ω = ω3ϕ1(ω/T)
or
r∗
ω = T 3ϕ2(ω/T).
(P5.4.1.5)
From the Wien formula (P5.4.1.4) (or (P5.4.1.5)), one can derive the Stefan–Boltzmann
law (P5.4.1.3). Moreover, these formulas imply the Wien displacement law, which presents
the temperature dependence of the position of the maximum of the function r∗
λ (or r∗
ω):
λmaxT = b
(ωmax/T = b1),
(P5.4.1.6)
where b = 2.9 × 10–3 m K is the Wien constant. For example, as the temperature decreases
by the factor 2, then the position of the maximum of the function r∗
ω (or uω) becomes twice
closely to the origin, and the maximum itself is eight times below (Fig. P5.21); in this case,
the area under the graph decreases by the factor 16.

Rayleigh–Jeans
Figure P5.21. Frequency dependence of the energy volume density of the equilibrium thermal radiation.
◮Rayleigh–Jeans law. Rayleigh and Jeans tried to obtain the form of the function uω
in the framework of the classical statistical physics. They considered radiation in a cavity
as an ensemble of standing electromagnetic waves randomly exchanging energy with the
walls and between each other. From the viewpoint of statistics, each independent standing
wave with a certain frequency of oscillations is equivalent to the oscillator with the same
frequency. The energy calculation is reduced to the two independent problems:
1) What is the number dg of oscillators (standing waves) contained in the frequency
interval dω? The answer must be expressed in the form of the function G(ω), which is
called the density of states: dg = V G(ω) dω, where V is the vessel volume.
To calculate G(ω), one can consider a vessel of the shape of a rectilinear parallelepiped with sides
Lx, Ly, Lz.
The boundary conditions (for example, the requirement that the nodes of standing waves
lie on the boundaries) lead to the conditions kξLξ = mξπ (ξ = x, y, z). Therefore, in the space of wave
vectors, the admissible states correspond to the nodes of the lattice with sides π/Lξ and the cell volume
δ = π3/(LxLyLz) = π3/V .
The volume of the k-space, corresponding to the variation in the value of
the wave vector from k to k + dk, is equal to
1
8 (4πk2 dk) (the volume of the spherical layer cut by the
ﬁrst quadrant). Dividing by the cell volume, we obtain the number of spatially distinct oscillations in the
interval dk: dg = V k2 dk
2π2 . It is also necessary to take account of the additional degrees of freedom (in the case
of electromagnetic waves, there are two possible states of polarization), which we generally take into account
by the additional factor γ.
Let us ﬁnd the number of states per unit volume:
dg
V = γ k2 dk
2π2 .
(P5.4.1.7)
This formula is obtained from the boundary conditions and has a very general character
and numerous applications. To pass to ω, we must take the formula k = ω/c into account.
Finally, we obtain (γ = 2)
G(ω) =
ω2
π2c3 .
(P5.4.1.8)
2) What is the average energy of a single oscillator?
The classical physics gives the following answer (see Subsection P2.5.2): to each
oscillator, independently of its frequency, one must assign two degrees of freedom and,
according to the energy equipartition theorem, the average energy of each oscillator must
be equal to kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant.
As a result of this reasoning, the classical physics gives the Rayleigh–Jeans law:
uω = G(ω)kT = ω2kT
π2c3 .
(P5.4.1.9)

P5.4. FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM OPTICS
561
Experiments show that the Rayleigh–Jeans law is well satisﬁed at small frequencies (for
ω ≪ωm) but is absolutely falseat large frequencies (Fig. P5.21). Indeed, although(P5.4.1.9)
satisﬁes the conditions imposed on any possible function uω by the Wien formula (P5.4.1.5),
one can readily see that the function thus obtained does not have any maximum; it mono-
tonically increases, and the integral
R ω
0 uωdω; that is, the total energy of radiation is equal
to inﬁnity! This situation is one of the symptoms of the deep crisis in the classical physics
and the contemporaries called it the ultraviolet catastrophe.
◮Planck’s law. The energy equipartition theorem is a consequence of the fact that the
oscillator classical energy is proportional to its squared amplitude and can take any even
very small values. According to Planck’s quantization assumption, the oscillator energy
(counted from the minimum value) can take only discrete values multiple of a quantity
depending on the oscillator frequency:
εn(ω) = nε1(ω),
n = 0, 1, . . .
(P5.4.1.10)
To calculate the average energy, one can use the Maxwell–Boltzmann formula (see Subsec-
tion P2.5.4), according to which the probability of a state with energy ε is proportional to

Comparing with Wien formula (P5.4.1.5), we see that ε1 = ε1(ω) must be proportional to ω:
ε1(ω) = ℏω,
(P5.4.1.12)
where ℏ= h/(2π) = 1.05×10–34 J s is a universal constant. The constant h is called Planck’s
constant and ℏis the reduced Planck constant, often called “h-bar”; it is convenient to use
the former constant in the case of frequency, and the latter, in the case of cyclic frequency:
ε1 = hν = ℏω. Since the quantum energy is proportional to the oscillator frequency, it
follows, that at a given temperature, the high-frequency oscillations are excited with a very
small probability and their contribution to the energy radiation energy is negligibly small.
This solves the problem of ultraviolet catastrophe.

P5.4.2. Light Quanta
◮Photoeffect. The external photoelectric effect (photoeffect) is the effect of light-induced
emission of electrons from a matter. To study the photoeffect, one employs a vacuum tube
with cold cathode (in this case, the thermoelectron emission can be neglected). Radiating
the cathode by light of ﬁxed frequency and intensity, one takes the volt-ampere characteristic
of the tube (dependence of the current on the anode voltage). The volt-ampere characteristic
(Fig. P5.22) permits ﬁnding: (a) the number of electrons emitted from the cathode per unit
time (it is expressed in terms of the saturation current: N = Isat/e) and (b) the maximum
kinetic energy of emitted electron; it is expressed in terms of the stopping voltage, the anode
voltage at which the current is zero:
1
2 mv2 = e|Us|.
At this voltage, even the fastest electrons cannot reach the anode.

The ﬁrst law of photoeffect: the number of electrons emitted from metal by light per
unit time is directly proportional to the light wave intensity.
The second law of photoeffect: the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons linearly
increases with light frequency and is independent of light intensity. If the light frequency
is less than a certain minimum frequency νmin determined for a given material, then the
photoeffect is not observed. It was experimentally found that the dependence of e|Us| on ν
for a given metal has the form of an inclined straight line, and the inclination of the lines
constructed for different metals turned out to be the same (Fig. P5.23). The classical wave
theory of light could not explain the second law of photoeffect. Moreover, this theory
cannot explain the fact that the photoeffect is inertialess; that is, absolutely no delay arises
between the beginning of radiation and the appearance of current.

◮Light quanta. The photoeffect laws were explained by Einstein. He used Planck’s
quantization assumption (Subsection P5.4.1), but proceeded much further assuming that
the light energy quanta are completely absorbed by separate electrons. This means that in
the process of absorption, light behaves like a localized particle (it was called photon) with
energy
E = hν = ℏω = hc/λ.
(P5.4.2.1)
Just as any massless particle moving with the speed of light, a light quantum (a photon) has
the momentum
p = E/c = hν/c = h/λ.
(P5.4.2.2)
The relation between the energy and momentum of a massless particle is given by the theory
of relativity (see Subsection P1.10.3).
The quantum properties of light manifest themselves in light radiation, absorption,
and scattering. Its wave properties manifest themselves in the phenomena related to light
propagation. The light is of dual nature (the wave-particle duality). The same properties
are exhibited by all elementary particles.
The photoeffect (an act of photoeffect) is the absorption of photon by a particle, for
example, by electron. As a result of photoeffect, the light quantum disappears, and the
electron acquires additional energy. If a photoelectron is emitted from a matter, then the
external photoeffect is observed; if it remains inside, then the internal photoeffect takes
place. In the case of internal photoeffect, electrons can move from a bound state in a free
state, which increases the number of current carriers and hence decreases the resistance.
Photoeffect is used to construct photoelements, photorelay, etc.
Example 1. Can photoeffect occur on a free electron?
Solution. The answer is negative, because, in this case, the energy and momentum conservation laws
cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously. This becomes obvious if we pass to the inertial reference system in which
the electron after the photoeffect is at rest. Before the photoeffect, the system contained a light quantum and
a moving electron, and after the photoeffect, it contains only an immovable electron; that is, the energy is not
conserved.
Absorbing a light quantum, the electron acquires the energy hν. After escape from
a metal, the energy of each electron decreases by a certain value, which is called the
photoelectric work function Aexit (the work required to remove an electron from metal; the
photoelectric work function depends on the kind of the matter). The maximum energy of
electrons after escape (if there are no other losses) has the form
1
2 mv2 = hν – Aexit
(P5.4.2.3)
(Einstein equation). If hν < Aexit, then the external photoeffect does not occur. Hence the
threshold frequency is equal to
νmin = Aexit/h.
It follows from (P5.4.2.3) that the inclination of lines in the graph of the dependence of e|Us|
on ν (Fig. P5.23) is equal to h and the segment cut by the straight line on the ordinate axis
is equal to the photoelectric work.
The photon energy and the photoelectric work are usually expressed in electronvolts
(eV). One electronvolt, which is a non-SI unit, equals the energy acquired by an electron
as it accelerates through a potential difference of –1 V: 1 eV = 1.6022 × 10–19 J. If, for
example, the stopping voltage is –3.5 V, then the maximum kinetic energy of electrons is
equal to 3.5 eV.

Example 2. The existence of the photoelectric work function means that, on the metal boundary, there
arise forces retaining the electron inside the metal. How can the electron attraction to an electrically neutral
metal be explained?
Solution. A charge particle is attracted by charges of opposite sign induced on the conductor surface. The
attraction force is calculated by using the method of electrostatic images (Subsection P3.4.1). The escaping and
returning electrons form a charge cloud near the surface, and the charges on the metal surface form a positively
charged layer. Between the charged layers, there exists a nonzero average ﬁeld intensity directed outwards.
◮Boundary of the X-ray spectrum. If electrons are accelerated in a vacuum tube whose
electrodes are charges at several kilovolts, then on impact of electrons on anode, the effect of
slowing down the X-ray radiation arises. The study of the spectrum of this radiation shows
that it does not contain the wavelengths less than a certain value λc, which is inversely
proportional to the voltage applied to the tube. This fact ﬁnds a natural explanation in
quantum optics. The radiated photon energy cannot exceed the energy electron kinetic
energy: hc/λ ≤eU, which implies
λ ≥λc = hc
eU .
The theoretical value of the coefﬁcient of proportionality between λc and 1/U is in good
agreement with experiments.
◮Light pressure.
The light pressure was predicted by Maxwell on the basis of the
electromagnetic theory and was measured by Lebedev. Lebedev’s installation consisted of
a light rod suspended in a vacuum on a thin ﬁlament. Two thin plates were ﬁxed at the ends
of the rod, one of them was a reﬂecting plate, the other was an absorbing plate. Illuminating
the plate and measuring the ﬁlament twisting, he calculated the light pressure.
The electromagnetic theory gave the following explanation of the light pressure: the
electric ﬁeld of an electromagnetic wave induces current in the metal and this current is
under the action of the Amp`ere force from the magnetic ﬁeld of the wave; this force has the
same direction as the wave propagation and is the cause of light pressure. The explanation
of pressure in the language of light quanta looks much simpler: the photons with the
momentum (P5.4.2.2) are absorbed or reﬂected transferring their momentum to the matter.
In the case of photon reﬂection, the transferred momentum is twice larger than that in the
case of absorption (also see Subsection P4.2.2).
◮Compton effect. As a photon interacts with a free electron, the process of photon
absorption is forbidden by conservation laws, but the photon scattering may occur. If the
electron was originally at rest, then, as a result of interaction, it acquires a certain velocity.
The energy conservation laws require that the photon energy decrease by the value of the
electron kinetic energy, which means that its frequency must also decrease. At the same
time, from the viewpoint of the wave theory, the frequency of scattered light must coincide
with the frequency of incident light. This phenomenon is called the Compton effect, it was
discovered in X-ray scattering and played an important role in the formation of quantum
theory.
The photon scattering on an electron can be considered as an elastic collision of two
particles obeying the energy and momentum conservation laws:
pc + mc2 = p ′c + E′
e,
p = p ′ + p ′
e,
where p and p ′ is the initial and terminal photon momenta, p ′
e and E′
e are the momentum and
energyof the recoil electron(Fig. P5.24). We express the energy and momentum of the recoil
electron and substitute them into the relation E ′ 2
e – p ′ 2
e c2 = m2c4 (see Subsection P1.10.3).
After transformations, we obtain
mc(p – p′) = pp′(1 – cos θ),

where θ is angle of the photon scattering (the angle between the vectors p and p ′). We
express the momenta of incident and scattered photon from equation (P5.4.2.2): p = h/λ,
p′ = h/λ′, and obtain the formula for dependence of the wavelength increment on the angle
of scattering:
λ′ – λ = λC(1 – cos θ).
The quantity λC = h/mc = 2.43 × 10–12 m is called the electron Compton wavelength. The
energy of photon with wavelength λC is equal to the energy of electron at rest mc2. The
maximum effect corresponds to the photon scattering at the angle θ = π.
◮Number of photons in equilibrium thermal radiation. Planck’s formula (P5.4.1.13)
for the density of energy of equilibrium thermal radiation can be written in the language of
light quanta as follows:
uω = ℏωG(ω)Nω,
where ℏω is the energy of a quantum, G(ω) = ω2/π2c3 is the density of states, and
Nω =
1
eℏω/kT – 1
(P5.4.2.4)
has the meaning of the number of photons in the state with a certain frequency ω.
P5.4.3. Principle of Laser Operation
◮Spontaneous and forced transitions. Einstein coefﬁcients. We consider an atom in
the ﬁeld of equilibrium radiation. If the atom is in the state with energy Ei, then, under the
action of radiation, it can move into a state with larger energy Ej absorbing a light quantum

with frequency ω = (Ej – Ei)/ℏ(Fig. P5.25). Such a process is called the forced (induced)
absorption. The probability of such a transition per unit time is proportional to the density
of energy radiation at the frequency ω:
Pi→j = Bijuω.

566
OPTICS
The reverse transition from a state with larger energy to a state with lesser energy is related
to creation and emission of a quantum of frequency ω. It can occur in two ways. The
ﬁrst type of transitions is called the spontaneous emission, it occurs even in the absence of
external radiation (for uω = 0), and its probability is independent of uω:
P sp
j→i = Aji.
The second type of transitions is called the forced emission, it occurs under the action of
a quantum of frequency ω. The transition probability per unit time, just as in the case of
forced absorption, is proportional to uω:
P ind
j→i = Bjiuω.
The coefﬁcients Bij, Bji, and Aji thus derived are called Einstein coefﬁcients, and they are
independent of the radiation temperature.
◮Equilibrium between atoms and radiation. We assume that a volume ﬁlled with
equilibrium radiation at temperature T contains equal atoms. We also assume that the
thermal equilibrium is established between atoms and radiation, and in this case the average
number of atoms in state i is equal to Ni and that in state j is equal to Nj. These numbers
at temperature T are related to each other by the Boltzmann relation:
Nj = Nie–(Ej–Ei)/kT .
In equilibrium, the number of transitions from i to j must be equal to the number of reverse
transitions:
NiBijuω = Nj(Aji + Bjiuω).
(P5.4.3.1)
It follows from the Boltzmann relation that Ni/Nj →1 as T →∞. Taking into account
that then uω →∞, we obtain Bij = Bji.
Let us express uω from (P5.4.3.1):
uω =
Aji/Bji
eℏω/kT – 1
(P5.4.3.2)
(we took into account that Ni/Nj = exp(ℏω/kT)). One can see that, in fact, we derived
Planck’s law for equilibrium radiation. The ratio Aji/Bji can be obtained from the condition
that the classical Rayleigh–Jeans law must hold at high temperatures:
Aji
Bji
= ℏω3
π2c3 .
We look at this relation from a different standpoint. Taking formula (P5.4.2.4) for the
number of quanta with a certain frequency into account, we write (P5.4.3.2) as
Bjiuω
Aji
= Nω.
Hence the ratio of the probability of forced radiation to the probability of spontaneous
emission is equal to the number of quanta of frequency ω. In other words, the probability
of forced emission calculated per one quantum is equal to the probability of spontaneous
emission. One can see that the spontaneous and forced emissions must be of the same nature.
The (qualitative) explanation is that even in the absence of light quanta in the system, the
electromagnetic ﬁeld has the so-called zero-point oscillations of a given frequency (the
oscillator energy in quantum mechanics is equal to ℏω(N + 1
2 )). Precisely these oscillations
cause spontaneous transitions.

P5.4. FOUNDATIONS OF QUANTUM OPTICS
567
◮Inverse population of levels. In each act of forced emission, a new quantum is formed,
and the created quantum has the same phase as the quantum generating this radiation. In
other words, instead of one quantum, two coherent quanta appear in the system. Each
of these quanta can in turn cause the appearance of a new coherent quantum, etc. Thus,
coherent radiation may be ampliﬁed. But the newly created quanta are absorbed by atoms
that are in the lower of the two energy states. In equilibrium, the number of atoms in the
lower state (the population of the lower level) is higher than that in the upper level. Hence
absorption prevails over the forced emission, and ampliﬁcation is impossible.
To make a coherent ray ampliﬁcation possible, it is necessary to create a metastable
state with inverse population of levels. Then ampliﬁcation of the quantum ﬂux J occurs by
the formula
dJ = σ(nj – ni)J dx,
or
J(x) = J(0)eγx,
(P5.4.3.3)
where nj and ni are the atom concentrations, σ is the cross-section of forced absorption or
emission, and γ = σ(nj – ni) is the quantum ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient of the medium.
Figure P5.26. Three- and four-level schemes of laser operation.
The inverse population is created by using different methods of pumping. The most
widely spread are the three- and four-level schemes (Fig. P5.26). In the three-level scheme
(ruby laser), there is intense pumping from the lower level 1 to the wide short-living level 3
from which the long-living (metastable) level 2 is ﬁlled. It is necessary to ensure that
the population of the upper operation level 2 exceeds the population of the lower operation
level 1. The difﬁculty is that the initial population of level 2 is much less than the population
of level 1, and intensive pumping is required. The four-level scheme does not have this
drawback. In this scheme, the lower operation level 2 ﬁrst contains as few atoms as level 3.
The ﬁlling of level 3 occurs from level 4 which is pumped from the ground level 1. The
neodymium laser operates according to this scheme.
◮Construction elements of lasers. To use the phenomenon of quantum ampliﬁcation
of coherent light for creating the quantum generator, it is necessary to ensure positive
feedback in order that a beam amplify itself. To this end, mirrors are arranged at the ends
of the sample (or a mirror coating is applied). One of the mirrors is partially transparent,
which ensures that part of light escapes from the system as a laser beam. The initial beam
ampliﬁes itself by multiple reﬂections from the two mirrors if the following condition is
satisﬁed:
2Ln = mλ,
where n is index of refraction, L is the distance between the mirrors (the sample length),
and m is an integer. To ensure coherent light generation, the total ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient
on the entire closed path must be greater than 1:
R1R2e2γL > 1,
where γ is the quantum ampliﬁcation coefﬁcient (see (P5.4.3.3)) and R1 and R2 are the
indices of reﬂection of the mirrors.

Chapter P6
Quantum Mechanics. Atomic Physics
By the beginning of the twentieth century, classical physics had accumulated many con-
tradictions that could only be resolved by changing the main concepts of space and time
(Einstein’s theory of relativity, Chapter P1) and the laws of motion of particles on atomic
scales (quantum mechanics). The ﬁrst quantum concepts appeared at the very beginning of
the century (Planck’s formula for thermal radiation and Einstein’s formula for photoeffect,
Chapter P5), but quantum mechanics as a closed science was not constructed until the end
of the 1920s.
P6.1. Atomic Structure. Bohr Model
P6.1.1. Nuclear Atomic Model
◮Experimental antecedents. The atomic theory must, ﬁrst of all, explain the accumu-
lated experimental facts concerning the spectra of radiation of rareﬁed gases (that is, of
separate atoms).
The atomic spectra consist of separate very narrow lines (line spectra) whose location
is typical of each element. It was noted that any frequency is the difference of some two
terms: νmn = Tm – Tn, so that the element can be characterized not by a set of frequencies
but by a set of terms. For hydrogen, we have Tn = Rν/n2, where Rν is the Rydberg constant
(for frequency). The spectral lines for which one of the terms is ﬁxed are called a spectral
series. For example, in the hydrogen atom spectrum, the Lyman series (n = 1), the Balmer
series (n = 2), etc. are distinguished.
But at the beginning of the twentieth century, there were no clear concepts about the
atomic structure, the massive nucleus and electronic orbits. The Thomson model, in which
the mass and the positive charge are uniformly distributed over the atomic volume and the
electrons are contained inside this positive cloud as raisin in a pudding, seemed to be more
attractive.
◮Rutherford experiments. The nuclear atomic model was constructed in Rutherford’s
experiments on scattering of alpha particles at the atoms of thin goldfoil (performed by his
collaborators Geiger and Marsden in 1911). It was found that some particles deviate by
larger angles and even ﬂy in the opposite direction. The number of such particles was small
(approximately one of 8000 particles was scattered by an angle larger than 90◦), but the
mere fact of the existence of such particles contradicted the Thomson model.
Example 1. Estimate the maximum angle of deviation of alpha particles by the atom in the Thomson
model.
Solution. To obtain this estimate, we assume that, in the Thomson model, the maximum deviation is
exhibited by the particles ﬂying near the edge of the atom (a ball of radius R ∼10–10 m), where the electric ﬁeld
strength is maximum (see example 3, Subsection P3.3.2). The formula for the angle of the particle deviation
by the Coulomb ﬁeld was derived in Subsection P1.6.2 (example 2):

where A = 2Ze2/4πε0 (Z = 79), Ek ∼5–7 MeV is the kinetic energy of alpha particles, and b is the impact
parameter. Taking b ≈R ∼10–10 m for the Thomson model, and see that the maximum deviation of alpha
particles is ∼0.01◦. If the multiple scattering is taken into account, then a greater angle of deviation is obtained,
but for the ﬁlm thickness d ∼10–7–10–6 m, the probability of scattering even by several degrees is negligibly
small.
Rutherford showed that the experimental results are in good agreement with the formula
for the angular distributionof α-particles scatteredat a point Coulombcenter withchargeZe.
Example 2. Rutherford’s formula. We consider a thin target whose unit area contains N0 = nd nuclei
(n is the bulk concentration of nuclei, d is the target width). Assuming that each particle interacts only with a
single nucleus, we see that the particles scattered in the angle interval (θ, θ + dθ) are the particles whose impact
parameter with respect to any nucleus lies in the interval [b(θ), b(θ + dθ)]. The fraction of particles scattered in
this angle is equal to the total area of such annuli around all the nuclei contained in the unit area of the target:
dN
N
= N02πb db = N02πb db
dθ dθ.
Taking into account that the solid angle is equal to dΩ= 2π sin θdθ, we obtain
dN

Expressing b from formula (P6.1.1.1) for the scattering of alpha particles at the Coulomb center Ze, we obtain
the Rutherford formula:

(P6.1.1.2)
Numerous experiments conﬁrmed that this formula is in good agreement with experimental data. (We note that
the coefﬁcient at N0dΩis called the differential scattering cross-section; see Subsection P8.2.2 for details.)
◮Atomic structure. An atom with atomic number Z consists of a heavy nucleus with
charge +Ze and electrons in the ﬁeld of this nucleus. An atom whose number of electrons is
not equal to its atomic number Z is called an ion. The minimum energy required to remove
an electron and form an ion is called the ionization energy.
The nuclear model is in unresolvable contradiction with the fundamental concepts of
classical physics. The electrons are attracted to the nucleus, and hence they cannot be at
rest but must move around the nucleus (therefore, the nuclear model is sometimes called the
planetary model). But in accelerated motion, the electron radiates electromagnetic waves,
and within a time interval of the order of 10–10 s, it must lose its entire energy and fall on
the nucleus (see example 2, Subsection P4.2.2). Within the framework of classical physics,
the atom cannot be stable.
P6.1.2. Bohr Model
◮Bohr postulates. Bohr’s semiclassical model describes the properties of the hydrogen
atom and hydrogen-like ions (one electron in the ﬁeld of the nucleus Ze). The model is
based on the Bohr postulates:
1) The electrons can move only in certain stationary orbits according to the classical
equations of motion but without energy radiation.
2) In this case, the angular momentum can take only discrete values Ln = nℏ. For
circular orbits, the quantization rule takes the form
mvnrn = nℏ.
(P6.1.2.1)
The number n is called the principal quantum number.
3) The radiation or absorption of quanta of electromagnetic radiation occurs only in
transition from one stationary orbit to another stationary orbit:
ℏω = En – Em.

the excited states. The lifetime of excited states is of the order of 10–8 s. The radius of the
orbit of electron in the ground state in the hydrogen atom is called the Bohr radius and is
denoted by a0:
a0 = r1 =

length), n1 is the number of the initial state, n2 is the number of the ﬁnal state of electron
(Fig. P6.1). The hydrogen lines with n2 = 1 and n1 = 2, 3, . . . form the Lyman series (ultra-
violet region), the lines with n2 = 2 and n1 = 3, 4, . . . form the Balmer (visible region), the
lines with n2 = 3 form the Paschen series (infrared region), the further series are Brackett,
Pfund, etc. series.
◮Hydrogen-like ions. Taking account of the nucleus motion. The formulas obtained
for the hydrogen atom can easily be generalized to the case of a hydrogen-like ion, or
the case of one electron in the ﬁeld of a charge Ze. It is simply required to replace e2
by Ze2 in all formulas.
In this case, the Rydberg constant is multiplied by Z2.
For
example, in the case of helium one-electron ion He+, the electron energy takes the values
En = –4R/n2. Obviously, the energy with number 2n coincides with the electron energy
in the hydrogen atom with number n. This means that the transition, for example, from the
fourth level to the second level must correspond to the same frequency as the transition from
the second level in the hydrogen atom to the ﬁrst level. An analysis of the spectra shows
that all the corresponding levels of the helium ion lie below the levels of the hydrogen atom

approximately by 0.04 %. This difference can be explained by the fact that the nucleus
mass is ﬁnite: both the electron and nucleus move about their common center of mass. The
simplest way to take the nucleus motion into account is to replace the electron mass m by
the reduced mass µ (see Subsection P1.6.4). This results in multiplication of all values of
the energy and frequencies by the factor M/(m + M), where M is the nucleus mass. The
largest increase in the energy is for the hydrogen atom.
By the same reason, the energy levels of electrons in heavier isotopes lie below (isotopic
effect). For example, the deuterium levels lie a little below the hydrogen levels, and the
tritium levels lie a little below the deuterium levels.
◮The Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition. A generalization of the orbit quanti-
zation rule is the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition:
I
p dq = 2πnℏ,
(P6.1.2.7)
where q and p are the generalized coordinate and momentum.
If for the generalized
coordinates of motion in a central ﬁeld we take the angle ϕ and the angular momentum L,
then we obtain the Bohr quantization rule. In the case of one-dimensional motion, the
quantization condition (P6.1.2.7) takes the form
2
Z x2
x1
p
2m(En – U(x)) dx = 2πnℏ.
where x1 and x2 are the turning points, at which the momentum is zero. For example, in
the case of oscillator, U(x) = mω2x2/2, and calculating the integral, we obtain
En = nℏω,
which up to the term ℏω/2 (zero-point oscillations) coincides with the exact answer given
by quantum mechanics.
The Bohr theory is not a consistent quantum theory.
It does not describe the ﬁne
structure of hydrogen-like atoms and the properties of many-electron atoms, starting from
the helium atom.

P6.2. ELEMENTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

P6.2. Elements of Quantum Mechanics
P6.2.1. Wave Function. Uncertainty Relation
◮The corpuscular-wave duality. De Broglie waves. A moving particle of matter can
exhibit wave-like properties; also a wave can exhibit particle-like properties. This behav-
ior is known as corpuscular-wave duality or wave-particle duality. The corresponding
wavelengths, wave vector, and cyclic frequency are given by the de Broglie formulas:
λ = h
p ,
k = p
ℏ,
ω = E
ℏ,
(P6.2.1.1)
where p is the particle linear momentum and E is its relativistic energy.
An important argument for de Broglie waves was the fact that, with deﬁnition (P6.2.1.1) taken into account,
the Bohr quantization rule (formula (6.1.2.1)) takes the form of the existence condition for the closed standing
wave: 2πrn = nλ (an integer number of de Broglie waves can be put on the orbit length).
The phase velocity of the de Broglie wave of a free particle moving with velocity v is
equal to c2/v, its group velocity is equal to v. (The phase velocity is not an observable
quantity.)
◮Wave function. A particle is associated with a complex wave function ψ(r), which has
a statistical meaning. The squared modulus of the wave function is equal to the density of
probability of ﬁnding a particle at a given point in space:
dP = |ψ(r)|2 dV .
(P6.2.1.2)
The interference and diffraction phenomena in propagation of particles and in their detection
arise due to superposition principle: if states ψ1 and ψ2 are realized, then the superposition
ψ = c1ψ1 + c2ψ2 is also realized. The wave properties of particles were ﬁrst discovered in
experiments on diffraction of electrons at crystals in 1927. (Davison–Germer experiments).
◮Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
The measurement of a particle coordinates and
projections of its momentum is of statistical character. The uncertainties in measurements
of these quantities are related as
∆px∆x ≥1
2 ℏ,
∆py∆y ≥1
2 ℏ,
∆pz∆z ≥1
2 ℏ.
(P6.2.1.3)
The momentum and coordinates cannot simultaneously take exact values, and the notion of
classical trajectory becomes meaningless.
The electron state with a deﬁnite momentum px is determined by the wave function in
the plane wave form:
ψ(x) =

In this case, the electron is completely delocalized in space. To estimate the uncertainty in
measuring the momentum for an electron with localized wave function ψ(x), it is necessary
to expand this function in the Fourier integral in wave functions with a deﬁnite momentum:
ψ(x) =

ϕ(px) dpx.
The probability of that the result of measuring of px lies in the interval (px, px + dpx) is
determined by the squared Fourier transform |ϕ(px)|2dpx. According to general properties
of the Fourier transformation, the function width and its Fourier transform are related as
∆x ∆(px/ℏ) ≥1
2 (also see Subsection P5.2.1, discussion of the temporal coherence).
The uncertainty relation for time and energy has the form:
∆E∆t ≥ℏ,
(P6.2.1.4)
where ∆E is the state energy uncertainty and ∆t is the particle lifetime in this state.

Example 1. Impossibility of electron localization in the nucleus.
If we assume that the electron is contained inside a nucleus of dimension r ∼10–15 m, then the uncertainty
of its coordinate is of the order of the nucleus dimensions and the uncertainty of the momentum is ∆p ∼ℏ/r.
Assuming that the average momentum is of the order of its uncertainty, we obtain the following estimate for
the energy: E = p2/2m ∼10–8J ≈105 MeV, which exceeds the electron binding energy in the atom by many
orders of magnitude.
Example 2. Estimate of the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom. Assuming that the coordinate
uncertainty is of the order of the atom average dimension and the momentum uncertainty is of the order of the
average momentum, we obtain the following relation between momentum and radius:
p ∼ℏ
r .
Substituting p(r) into expression (P6.1.2.4) for the electron energy, we obtain the energy as a function of one
parameter, the orbit radius:
E ∼
ℏ2
2mr2 – k e2
r .
This expression takes the minimum value equal (up to a dimensionless factor) to the ground state energy for r
equal to the Bohr radius.
◮Applicability criterion for the classical description. The notion of trajectory can be
used only if the coordinate uncertainty ∆x is small compared with the typical dimensions R
of the motion region and the momentum uncertainty ∆p is small compared to the momen-
tum p. In other words, the inequality pR ≫ℏmust be satisﬁed. In addition to this criterion,
one can compare ℏwith other combinations of the system parameters that are of dimension
of angular momentum: (momentum × length) or (energy × time).
P6.2.2. The Schr¨odinger Equation

Time-dependent and time-independent Schr¨odinger equations. The evolution of
the wave function of a particle in the force ﬁeld U(r) is described by the Schr¨odinger
equation:

(P6.2.2.3)

and in the case of a free particle with momentum p = mv is equal to S = v|ψ(r)|2. The
variation in the probability of ﬁnding a particle in a certain region is determined by the
probability ﬂux through the boundary of this region.

P6.2. ELEMENTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS

◮Properties of stationary states. The solutions of the time-independent Schr¨odinger
equation (P6.2.2.3) describing the bound states of a particle in a potential ﬁeld must satisfy
the following conditions:
1) The function and its ﬁrst derivatives must be continuous.
2) The function must be normed:
R
|ψ|2 dV = 1. These two conditions can be satisﬁed
only for deﬁnite values of energy E1, E2, . . . (discreteness of energy levels).
3) In the one-dimensional case, the solutions are real and nondegenerate; that is, to
each energy value En there corresponds one function ψn(x).
The function ψn is zero
at n – 1 points (nodes of the wave function). If the potential energy is an even function
(U(–x) = U(x)), then the wave functions with odd numbers (including the wave function
of the ground state) are even (ψ2n+1(–x) = ψ2n+1(x)), and the wave functions with even
numbers are odd (ψ2n(–x) = –ψ2n(x)).
The average value of the physical quantity g(r), which is a function of coordinates, is
calculated by the formula:
〈g〉=
Z
g|ψ|2 dV ,
where ψ(r) is the normed wave function.
Example 1. Well with inﬁnite walls. If the potential energy has the form
U =
n 0,
for 0 ≤x ≤L;
∞,
for x < 0 or x > L,
then the wave function vanishes at edges of the well, at x = 0 and x = L. The Schr¨odinger equation (P6.2.2.3)
takes the form
d2ψ
dx2 + 2m
ℏ2 Eψ = 0
and has the solutions
ψn(x) =

The well width is equal to an integer number of de Broglie half-waves. The energy of the nth level is equal to
En = ℏ2k2
n
2m
= n2π2ℏ2
2mL2 . One can see that the wave functions with odd numbers are symmetric with respect to
the well center, and the wave functions with even numbers are antisymmetric.

U =



0
for 0 ≤x ≤L;
U0 > 0
for x > L;

for x < 0,
then the Schr¨odinger equation inside the well has the same form as in the preceding example and outside the
well, for x > L, takes the form
d2ψ

ℏ2 (E – U0)ψ = 0.

576
QUANTUM MECHANICS. ATOMIC PHYSICS
The localized (bound) states must have energies in the interval 0 < E < U0. The wave function vanishes for
x = 0 and is equal to ψ1(x) = A sin(k1x) inside the well and to ψ2(x) = B exp(–k2x) + C exp(k2x) outside the
well, where k1 =
√
2mE/ℏ, k2 = √2m(U0 – E)/ℏ. It follows from the ﬁniteness and integrability condition
for the wave function that C = 0. Eliminating the coefﬁcients A and B from the conditions of continuity,
ψ1(L) = ψ2(L), and smoothness, dψ1
dx

x=L = dψ2
dx

x=L, of the wave function, we obtain the equation for the
allowed values of the energy: k2 = –k1 cot k1L.
The roots must be sought graphically, as points of intersection of the graph k2L = –k1L cot k1L with the
circle (k1L)2 + (k2L)2 = 2mU0L2/ℏ2 in the region k1L ≥0, k2L ≥0 (Fig. P6.3). The new bound states arise
under the condition E = U0 with k1L = π(n + 1/2); for U0L2 < π2ℏ2/(8m) (a very “narrow” or very “shallow”
well), there are no bound states.
Figure P6.3. Graphical solution of the equations in example 2.
We note that the wave function of a bound state is nonzero for x > L (Fig. P6.2). According to the classical
concepts, the particle penetration under the potential barrier is impossible, because for E < U0, the kinetic
energy in this region is negative. In quantum mechanics, the probability of ﬁnding a particle under the barrier
is nonzero, although it decreases exponentially with the distance from the barrier.
Example 3. Harmonic oscillator. The potential energy of harmonic oscillator is U(x) = mω2x2/2. The
energies of stationary states are equal to En =
 n + 1/2

ℏω, and the wave functions of stationary states are
expressed in terms of special functions, Hermitian polynomials (see Subsection M13.10.4). The energy of the
ground state is equal to ℏω/2 (the energy of zero-point oscillations).
Passing to dimensionless variables by the change E = ℏω
2 ε, x =
r
ℏ
mω ξ, we obtain the Schr¨odinger
equation for the oscillator in the form
d2ψ
dξ2 + (ε – ξ2)ψ = 0.
As ξ →∞, the term ε in parentheses can be neglected, and we obtain the asymptotic for large ξ behavior of
the wave function: ψ ∼exp(–ξ2/2). We seek the wave function in the form ψ = exp(–ξ2/2)ϕ(ξ), and for ϕ, we
obtain the equation
ϕ′′ – 2ξϕ′ + (ε – 1)ϕ = 0.
Representing ϕ(ξ) as a series, ϕ = a0 + a1ξ + · · · , and substituting it into the equation, we obtain a series of
recursive relations: 2a2 + (ε – 1)a0 = 0, 6a3 + (ε – 3)a1 = 0, . . . , (n + 1)(n + 2)an+2 + (ε – 2n – 1)an = 0,
. . . . The wave function ψ(ξ) satisﬁes the ﬁniteness condition only if the series for ϕ(ξ) contains ﬁnitely many
terms (otherwise, as ξ →∞, ϕ(ξ) increases as exp(ξ2)). The series can be truncated under the condition that it
contains either only odd powers (for this, we must set a0 = 0) or only even powers (a1 = 0). The series truncation
condition permits obtaining allowed values of the energy: εn = 2n + 1 or En = ℏω(n + 1/2) (n = 0, 1, . . . ).
Just as in the preceding example, the wave functions of the oscillator stationary states are nonzero in the
region, where the oscillator energy is less than its potential energy. The probability of ﬁnding a particle in the
forbidden region decreases exponentially in the direction inside this region.
We note that in the ground state, the oscillator energy is equal not to zero but to ℏω/2; this energy is called
the energy of zero-point oscillations. The existence of such an energy is inevitable from the viewpoint of the
uncertainty relation: a particle cannot be at the lowest point of the well and have zero momentum.
Just as any other quantum system, the oscillator can radiate or absorb photons in transitions from level
to level. An analysis of probabilities of such transitions shows that they can occur only between neighboring

P6.2. ELEMENTS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
577
levels; in other words, the transitions between the oscillator levels obey the rule of selection: ∆n = ±1. This
means that the oscillator radiates photons only of a single frequency ω.
Figure P6.4. A step-like potential barrier (example 4).
Example 4. Reﬂection from a barrier. We show how to calculate the probability of reﬂection of the
incident particles from an obstacle (barrier). We consider a barrier of the simplest shape, which is like a step
of height U0 (Fig. P6.4):
U =
 0
for x ≤0;
U0
for x > 0.
We write the Schr¨odinger equation as (see example 22)
ψ′′ + k2
1ψ = 0
for x < 0;
ψ′′ + k2
2ψ = 0
for x > 0.
where k1 =
√
2mE/ℏ, k2 = √2m(E – U0)/ℏ. The solution of this equation must describe the incident and
reﬂected waves for x < 0 and the transmitted wave for x > 0:
ψ(x) =
 A exp(ik1x) + B exp(–ik1x)
for x < 0;
C exp(ik2x)
for x > 0.
(We omit the time-dependent part exp(–iEt/ℏ) of the wave function.)
The densities of the probability
ﬂux (formula (P6.2.2.4)) of the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted waves are equal to S1 = |A|2(ℏk1/m),
S2 = |B|2(ℏk1/m), and S3 = |C|2(ℏk2/m). Hence the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients are equal to
R = S2/S1 = |B/A|2 and D = S3/S1 = (k2/k1)|C/A|2. From the continuity conditions for the wave function
and its derivatives for x = 0 we have

 .
(P6.2.2.5)
For E > U0, the numbers k1 and k2 are real, the coefﬁcients R and D are nonzero, and R + D = 1. We note
that, in classical physics, there is no reﬂection of particles for E > U0; that is, R = 0. In quantum physics, R
is not only nonzero, but for E – U0 ≪U0, we obtain k2 ≪k1, and hence D →0 and R →1. Even more
amazing purely quantum effect is obtained for U0 < 0 (formally, (P6.2.2.5) remains valid, but k2 > k1): in the
limit E ≪|U0|, we obtain k1 ≪k2, and hence R →1 (!).
For E < U0 (U0 > 0), the solution remains formally true if we set k2 = iκ, where κ = √2m(U0 – E)/ℏ. In
this case, R = 1, and the solution for x > 0 is the real exponential |ψ|2 = |C|2 exp(–2κx); the depth of penetration
of particles into the classically forbidden region is equal to 1/2κ.
Example 5. Tunnel effect.
In the case of incidence on a potential barrier of the de Broglie wave
corresponding to a free particle with energy less than the barrier height, there is a nonzero probability of ﬁnding
the particle on the other side of the barrier. The barrier transparency is the ratio the intensity (the density of
the probability ﬂux) of the transmitted wave to that of the incident wave. The potential barrier transparency
(Fig. P6.5) is given by the formula

The particle can be found under the barrier in the region forbidden for motion in classical mechanics.

P6.2.3. Operator Approach in Quantum Mechanics
◮Operators of physical quantities. Any observable physical quantity in quantum me-
chanics is associated with a Hermitian (self-adjoint) operator acting on the wave function. A
physical quantity G has a deﬁnite value λG only in the states corresponding to eigenfunctions
of the operator bG:
bGψ = λGψ,
and the measurable values of the physical quantity in any of these states coincide with the
eigenvalues λG of the operator bG. The system of eigenfunctions of Hermitian operator is
complete; that is, any function can be represented as a linear superposition of these functions.
If a state is a superposition of eigenfunctions corresponding to different λ, ψ = P
i Ciψi,
then the probability of obtaining the value λi in measurements is equal to |Ci|2, and the
average value of G in this state is equal to
〈G〉=

(P6.2.3.1)
The coordinate operator has the form bxψ = xψ, the momentum projection operator has the
form bpx = –iℏ∂
∂x , and the energy operator (Hamiltonian) is determined by the expression:
bH = bp2
2m + U = – ℏ2
2m ∆+ U.
(P6.2.3.2)
The Schr¨odinger equations (P6.2.2.1) and (P6.2.2.3) become
iℏ∂ψ
∂t = bHψ
and
bHψ = Eψ;
(P6.2.3.3)
that is, the stationary states are the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, and the energy of
these states are the corresponding eigenvalues.
◮Commensurability of physical quantities. Two physical quantities, A and B, are
said to be commensurable (can simultaneously have deﬁnite values) if they commute:
bAbB – bB bA = 0. For the coordinate and momentum projections, we have
bxbpx – bpxbx = iℏ.
(P6.2.3.4)
Example 1. Uncertainty principle. Operator approach. In the language of quantum operators, the
uncertainty principle becomes an exact mathematical statement. The uncertainty of a physical quantity in the
state ψ is ∆G =
q
〈(bG – 〈bG〉)2〉(in the eigenstate of the operator bG, the uncertainty is zero). The degree of
commensurability of two physical quantities bA and bB is determined by their commutator bC = bAbB – bB bA, which
is expressed by the inequality
∆A∆B ≥1
2 |〈bC〉|.

expressed by using the dual equation).
Example 2. Quantum oscillator. Operator approach.
The commutation relations permit obtaining
important results by pure algebraic methods. Let us ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian
describing the quantum oscillator:
bH = bp2
x
2m + mω2bx2
2
,
starting only from the commutation relation (P6.2.3.4) between the coordinate and momentum. Further, we
introduce dimensionless operators bq, bp, and bh using the formulas
bx =
r
ℏ
mω bq,
bpx =
√
ℏmω bp,
bH = ℏω
2
bh,
and bp = –i d
dq . Then, the dimensionless Hamiltonian acquires the form
bh = bp2 + bq2,
and the dimensionless coordinate and momentum operators satisfy the relation
bqbp – bpbq = i.
We introduce the “raising” and “lowering” operators:
ba+ = bq – ibp,
ba– = bq + ibp,
which satisfy the identities
ba+ba– = bh – 1,
ba–ba+ = bh + 1,
[ba+ba–] = –2.
The eigenvalues λ and eigenfunctions ψλ of the operator bA = ba+ba– have the following properties:
1) The eigenvalues are nonnegative (λ ≥0). An eigenvalue is zero if and only if ba–ψ0 = 0.
2) If ψλ is a normed eigenfunction with λ > 0, then
1
√
λ ba–ψλ is a normed eigenfunction with λ′ = λ – 2,
and
1
√
λ+2 ba+ψλ is a normed eigenfunction with λ′ = λ + 2.
This implies that the eigenvalues of the operator bA are even integers, the eigenvalues of the operator bh are
odd integers, and the eigenvalues of the energy operator are En = ℏω(n + 1
2 ). The ground state (n = 0) satisﬁes
the equation ba–ψ0 = 0 or dψ0
dq = –qψ0. We obtain ψ0(q) =
p

obtained by successive application of the raising operator: ψ1 =

3 (q – d/dq)ψ1, etc.
◮Three-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation. Now we consider the three-dimensional
Schr¨odinger equation. This equation is much more complicated than the one-dimensional
equation, but in several cases, it can be reduced to three one-dimensional equations by
the method of separation of variables. We illustrate this method with an example of the
three-dimensional oscillator.

The oscillator potential energy is unique: it is spherically symmetric and simultaneously the sum of three terms
each of which depends only on one coordinate and coincides with the potential energy of the one-dimensional
oscillator (Ux = mω2x2/2 etc.). This permits seeking the solution in the form
ψ(r) = ψ1(x)ψ2(y)ψ3(z).

Since only the ﬁrst term depends on x, it must be a constant that we denote by 2mE1/ℏ2. The obtained equation
coincides with the equation for the one-dimensional oscillator, and hence E1 can take only the values ℏω(n1+ 1
2 ).
The same concerns the other two terms. Since E = E1 + E2 + E3, for the energy of the three-dimensional
oscillator we obtain
En1,n2,n3 = ℏω(n + 3
2 ),
where n = n1 + n2 + n3, and n1, n2, n3 take the values 0, 1, 2, . . . . One can see that the ground state (n = 0)
is nondegenerate, the level with n = 1 is triply degenerate, the level with n = 2 is sixfold degenerate, the level
with n = 3 is tenfold degenerate, etc.
The operator representation permits writing the method of separation of variable more compactly. The
Schr¨odinger equation (P6.2.3.5) takes the form
( bH1 + bH2 + bH3)ψ1ψ2ψ3 = Eψ1ψ2ψ3.

P6.2.4. Motion in a Central Field. Hydrogen Atom
The general approach to solving the Schr¨odinger equation in a spherically symmetric ﬁeld
relies on using the conservation law for the moment of momentum (angular momentum).
Such an approach permits separating the variables (in spherical coordinates) for any spher-
ically symmetric potential.
◮Operatorof angular momentum. Theoperator of orbital angular momentum (moment
of momentum) of an electron bL with respect to point O is determined by the relations
bLx = bybpz – bzbpy,
bLy = bzbpx – bxbpz,
bLz = bxbpy – bybpx,
(P6.2.4.1)
and the operator of squared angular momentum is determined by the relation bL2 = bL2
x +
bL2
y + bL2
z. The angular momentum projections do not commute with each other:
[bLxbLy] = iℏbLz,
[bLybLz] = iℏbLx,
[bLzbLx] = iℏbLy,
(P6.2.4.2)
which means that they cannot simultaneously take deﬁnite values. But each of the pro-
jections commutes with the squared angular momentum, and hence we can speak about
common eigenfunctions of the operators bLz and bL2.
The triple of operators satisfying relations (P6.2.4.2) is called the vector of angular
momentum even if it is impossible to write (P6.2.4.1) for them. The general notion of
angular momentum in quantum mechanics is wider than the notion of classical orbital
angular momentum of a particle, it also includes the notion of intrinsic angular momentum
(spin) of subatomic particles (see Subsection P6.2.5).
The eigenvalues can be found purely algebraically from the commutation relations
(P6.2.4.2). The common eigenfunctions of the operators bL2 and bLz can correspond only to
the following eigenvalues:
bL2ψl,m = l(l + 1)ℏ2ψl,m,
bLzψl,m = mℏψl,m,
where l is an integer or half-integer nonnegative number, and for a given l, the number m
can take 2l + 1 values: m = –l, –l + 1, . . . , l – 1, l.

We pass to dimensionless operators: bLx = ℏblx, bLy = ℏbly, bLz = ℏblz, satisfying the commutation relations
[blxbly] = iblz etc. We introduce the “raising” and “lowering” operators:
bl+ = blx + ibly,
bl– = blx – ibly,
satisfying the relations
[blzbl+] = bl+,
[blzbl–] = –bl–,
bl+bl– = bl2 –bl2
z +blz,
bl–bl+ = bl2 –bl2
z –blz.
If ψ is an eigenfunction of the operatorsbl2 andblz with the eigenvalues λ and µ, thenbl+ψ is an eigenfunction of
these operators with the eigenvalues λ, µ + 1, andbl–ψ is an eigenfunction with the eigenvalues λ, µ – 1. The
minimum value µ1 and maximum value µ2 satisfy the equations:
λ – µ2
1 + µ1 = 0,
λ – µ2
2 – µ2 = 0,
which implies that µ1 = –µ2, and µ2 – µ1 = 2µ2 = l is an integer. For the eigenvalue of the operator bl2, we
obtain λ = l(l + 1).
Figure P6.6. Representation of the angular momentum in the vector model.
One can see that the maximum value of the projection of the angular momentum ℏl is
less than its magnitude ℏ√l(l + 1). In the vector model, the angular momentum is depicted
as a vector making a ﬁxed angle with the axis z and rotating about this axis. In this case, the
projections Lx and Ly do not have ﬁxed values, which shows that Lz is not commensurable
with Lx and Ly. In Fig. P6.6, we present the case l = 1.
◮Eigenfunctions of the orbital angular momentum operator. To ﬁnd the eigenvalues
of the orbital angular momentum determined by formulas (P6.2.4.1), it is convenient to
pass to spherical coordinates. The orbital angular momentum is a function of only angular
variables, and the commuting operators bLz and bL2 take the form
bLz = –iℏ∂

has the solution Φm = A exp(imϕ), which is a unique function of the angle ϕ only for
integer values of m. Hence, in the case of orbital angular momentum, only integer values
of the numbers l and m are realized. The number l is called the orbital quantum number
and the number m is called the magnetic quantum number (denoted by ml). Half-integer
values are realized in the case of intrinsic angular momentum—spin; the corresponding
spin quantum numbers are denoted by s and ms.
The equation for the eigenfunctions of the operator bΛ has solution in the form of
spherical functions Ylm(θ, ϕ) = Φm(ϕ)Θml(θ) with eigenvalues –l(l + 1), which are well
known in mathematical physics. (The functions Θ(θ) are expressed in terms of associated
Legendre functions; see Subsection M13.10.1). For example,

spherical functions form a complete system of functions of angular variables; that is, any
function of the variables θ and ϕ can be expanded in spherical functions.
◮Addition of angular momenta. The operator of the sum of two angular momenta
bL = bL1 + bL2, whose values are characterized by quantum numbers l1 and l2 (i.e., bL2
1
and bL2
2 have the eigenvalues ℏ√l1(l1 + 1) and ℏ√l2(l2 + 1) ), is characterized by the quantum
number l, which can take the following values: |l1 – l2| ≤l ≤l1 + l2.
The maximum
value corresponds to the parallel orientation of the angular momenta, the minimum value
corresponds to their antiparallel orientation. The operator bL2 does not commute with the
operators L1z and L2z, and hence the eigenfunctions of the operators bL2 and bLz are not
eigenfunctions of L1z and L2z (but are eigenfunctions of bL2
1 and bL2
2).
◮Motion in a central ﬁeld. In this case, the potential energy U(r) depends only on the
modulus of r. Since the orbital angular momentum operators bLz and bL2 commute with br2
and bp2, they also commute with the Hamiltonian. Hence, just as in classical mechanics,
the value of the angular momentum and its projection onto the z-axis are preserved in
the motion of a particle in a central ﬁeld. The wave function of any state ψ(r, θ, ϕ) can
be expanded in the common eigenfunctions ψE,l,ml of the three commuting operators bH,
bLz and bL2 corresponding to the three simultaneously measurable physical quantities: the
energy, the orbital angular momentum projection, and its value. We use the separation of
variables; that is, we seek the eigenfunctions in the form: ψE,l,ml = RE,l(r)Φml(ϕ)Θl,ml(θ).
Writing the Hamiltonian in spherical coordinates and taking (P6.2.4.3) and (P6.2.4.4) into

Just as in classical mechanics (see Subsection P1.6.2), the potential energy is supplemented
with the centrifugal energy ℏ2l(l + 1)/2mr2.
One can see that the magnetic quantum
number is not contained in the equation for allowed values of the energy. To each energy
level there correspond two quantum numbers: the orbital number l and the radial number
nr = 0, 1, 2, . . . numbering the allowed discrete values of the energy. The level Enr,l is
(2l + 1)-fold degenerate with respect to the values of the magnetic quantum number ml.

◮Magnetic moment. In classical physics, a charged particle moving in a closed trajectory
has a magnetic moment. The value and direction of the magnetic moment completely
determine both the magnetic ﬁeld of the moving charge and its interaction with the external
magnetic ﬁeld (see Section P3.8). For orbital motion of an electron, the ratio of its magnetic
moment to its mechanical angular momentum is equal to –e/2m. Hence, the projection of
the orbital magnetic moment on the axis z takes the values µz = –(e/2m)ℏml = –µBml,
and the value of the orbital magnetic moment is equal to µB
√l(l + 1), where µB = eℏ/2m ≈
9.274× 10–24 J/T is called the Bohr magneton. In the general case, the relation between the
magnetic moment and mechanical angular momentum can be written as: µz = g(e/2m)Lz
(or (µz/µB) = g(Lz/ℏ)). The dimensional multiplier g is called the gyromagnetic ratio; it
is equal to 1 for orbital angular momentum (and denoted gl) and 2 for spin (denoted gs).
For an atom in a magnetic ﬁeld with induction B directed along the axis z, the electron
acquires additional energy of interaction between the magnetic moment and the magnetic
ﬁeld: ∆E = –µzB = µBmlB. One can see that in the magnetic ﬁeld, the degeneration
in the magnetic quantum number ml must be removed; that is, instead of one level there
arise 2l + 1 equidistant levels the distance between which is proportional to the magnetic
ﬁeld. In this case, each spectral line must split into three equidistant lines (taking the rules
of selection discussed below into account, we see that the variation in ml in transitions
between the levels can only be ∆ml = 0, ±1). This effect is called the simple (normal)
Zeeman effect. The fact that the electron has an intrinsic (spin) magnetic moment strongly
complicates the pattern of the line splitting in the magnetic ﬁeld.
◮Hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics. With the potential energy U(r) = –ke2/r,
equation (P6.2.4.6) has the following solutions:
1) The possible values of the energy are determined by the formula
Enr,l = –
R
(nr + l + 1)2 ,
where R is the Rydberg constant (see (P6.1.2.5)). The quantity n = nr + l + 1 is called
the principal quantum number. One can see that the electron energy is determined only
by the principal quantum number. To one and the same principal quantum number n there
correspond states with distinct values of l: l = 0, 1, . . . , n – 1. The total degeneracy of each
energy level equals Pn–1
l=0 (2l + 1) = n2. The additional degeneracy is a special property
of the Coulomb potential. We note that the energy levels coincide with those obtained
in the semiclassical Bohr theory (Subsection P6.1.2), but there are profound important
distinctions: in Bohr’s theory, the orbital angular momentum in the ground state (n = 1) is
L = ℏ, and in quantum theory, the angular momentum of the ground state is zero.
2) The radial functions have the form Rn,l = rle–r/na0Pnr(r), where Pnr(r) is a poly-
nomial of degree nr = n – l – 1, and a0 = ℏ2/(mke2) is the radius of the ﬁrst electron orbit
in Bohr’s theory (the Bohr radius). For example,
R1,0 =

The radial functions are normed by unity:

R2r2 dr = 1. The probability of ﬁnding
the electron at a distance from the nucleus lying in the interval (r, r + dr) is equal to
dP =
R
(r,r+dr) |ψ|2 dV = R2(r)r2 dr. In the ground state, the most probable distance from
the electron to the nucleus is equal to the Bohr radius a0.
The electron state is denoted by the Latin letter indicating the value of the orbital
quantum number (s, p, d, and f correspond to l = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively, and further in
alphabetical order), before which the value of the principal quantum number is indicated.
For example, 3d corresponds to the electron with n = 3 and l = 2.

QUANTUM MECHANICS. ATOMIC PHYSICS
◮The spectra of alkali metals. In the case of alkali metals (Li, Na, . . . ), the atomic
state is determined by the electron state on the outer shell. This electron is in the centrally
symmetric ﬁeld of the nucleus and Z – 1 electrons on the inner shells. The outer shell
radius is signiﬁcantly larger than the inner shell radii (rn ∼n2), and hence, in the main
region of electron existence, the electric ﬁeld coincides with that of the charge +e. The
ﬁeld distortion by inner shell electrons exerts larger inﬂuence on a state with lesser orbital
number l, because ψ(r) ∼rl for small r. For the energy levels En,l, where n = nr + l + 1 is
the principal quantum number, one usually employs the expression
En,l = –
R
(n + αl)2 ,
where αl < 0 is the Rydberg correction. For example, for Li, α0 = –0.41 and α1 = –0.04,
and for Na, α1 = –0.88.
The difference between the ﬁeld where an electron moves from the Coulomb ﬁeld can be taken into account
in the ﬁrst approximation by adding the term A/r2 to the potential energy. This additional term takes account
of two effects at once: ﬁrst, the screening ﬁeld of the electron “core,” and second, the polarization of the core
by the outer shell electron, which results in that the core acquires a small electric dipole moment directed at
each time moment towards this electron. The term A/r2 can be added to the centrifugal energy (see formula
(P6.2.4.6)), and both terms can be written together as the centrifugal energy with redeﬁned l′ = l + αl.
To construct the spectrum, one must take account of the fact that the principal quantum
number n of the lowest state of the outer shell electron is equal to the shell number in
which this electron is located (for lithium, n = 2, for potassium, n = 3, etc.). Moreover, it
is necessary to take account of the rule of selection of the orbital number l: ∆l = ±1. In
Fig. P6.7, we present the diagram of spectral lines of Li atom and give the names of the ﬁrst
principal series.

P6.2.5. Electron Spin and Fine Structure of the Spectrum
◮Spin of electrons. Several experimental facts show that to describe the state of electrons
in an atom, it is insufﬁcient to have three quantum numbers related to its spatial motion.
These facts are:
1) The multiplet (ﬁne) structure of spectral lines of alkali metals. For example, the
most intensive line in the principal series; that is, the resonance line corresponding to the
transition to the ground s-state from the ﬁrst excited p-state, has the form of a pronounced
doublet.
2) The complicated (anomalous) Zeeman effect. Splitting of atomic lines in a magnetic
ﬁeld cannot be described as the simple Zeeman effect related to the magnetic moment of
the orbital motion.
3) The results of the Stern–Gerlach experiments on measuring magnetic moments of
silver atoms (1921). A beam of silver atoms was directed into the region of a strongly
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, where the atoms were acted upon by the force µz(dB/dz).
Since a silver atom has a single electron in the outermost shell, the atomic angular momen-
tum and magnetic moment are equal to those of this electron. The orbital magnetic moment
projection µz = mlµB can have 2l + 1 distinct values. Atoms with electrons in the s-state
do not deﬂect in magnetic ﬁeld; if there is a fraction of atoms with electrons in the p-state,
then they must split into three beams. It was discovered that a beam of atoms splits into
two beams deﬂected by the magnetic ﬁeld to opposite sides by the same distances.
The conclusion is that the electron has an intrinsic angular momentum (called spin) that
is not related to the electron orbital motion. The spin projection on the axis z can take
two values, which implies that the spin quantum number s must be equal to 1/2 (because
2s + 1 = 2). The value of the spin angular momentum is equal to ℏ
q
1
2 ( 1
2 + 1) =
√
3
2 ℏ. The
spin angular momentum projection on the axis z is equal to ℏms, where ms = ± 1
2 is the
magnetic spin quantum number (also known as the secondary spin quantum number). We
recall that half-integer values of the angular momentum quantum number do not contradict
the commutation relations.
Since the spin projection can take two values, it follows that to the set of quantum
numbers n and l, there correspond 2(2l + 1) distinct states and to the quantum number n,
there correspond 2n2 states.
A variation in the value of deviation of atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld permits ﬁnding the
value of the intrinsic magnetic moment. It turned out that the intrinsic magnetic moment
of an electron has anomalous gyromagnetic ratio gs = 2: the ratio of the spin magnetic
moment to the spin angular momentum is equal not to e/2m but to e/m. The magnetic
moment projection on the axis z takes the values (e/m)ℏms = ±µB. The anomalous values
of the gyromagnetic ratio are conﬁrmed by the results of the Einstein–de Haas experiments
(1914), in which magnetomechanical effects were studied (formation of a mechanical
angular momentum in magnetization of an iron sample).
All subatomic particles have an intrinsic angular momentum associated—the spin. The
spin quantum number of proton, neutron, and µ-mesons is equal to 1/2, that of photon is
equal to 1, and that of π-mesons is 0.
◮Fine structure of spectral lines. The ﬁne structure of lines of hydrogen-like atoms
and alkali metals can be explained by interaction between the spin magnetic moment and
the orbital angular momentum. The easiest way to understand the appearance of such an
interaction is to use the reference frame associated with the electron. In this reference
frame, the moving nucleus creates a magnetic ﬁeld with which the spin magnetic moment
interacts. With the spin-orbit interaction (also known as spin-orbit coupling) taken into
account, the following operators are preserved (commute with the Hamiltonian): the total

angular momentum bJ2, its projection bJz, and the value of the orbital angular momentum
bL2. The position of the levels En,l,j is determined by three quantum numbers, n, l, and j.
(In many-electron atoms, the quantum numbers of the angular momentum are denoted by
the capital letters L, S, and J. In spectroscopy, the orbital angular momentum is denoted
by the letters S, P, D, F, . . . In alkali metals, the atomic state is determined by a single
electron, and one can use both capital and small letters.) The degeneration of each level is
given by 2j + 1 states with distinct values of the projection of the total angular momentum.
For a given l, the total angular momentum number can take two values: j = (l ± 1
2 ), for
l = 0, there is only one value j = 1
2 . Hence the s-levels do not split (singlet levels), and the
levels with l > 0 split into two near levels (doublet levels). When constructing the spectra,
one must take the rules of selection into account: ∆l = ±1, ∆j = 0, ±1. For example, in
transition from the doublet p-state to the lower singlet s-state, there arise two lines (doublet
of the principal series), and the distance between them decreases with increasing n; and in
transition from singlet s-levels to the lowest p-level, there arise doublets of the sharp series,
which have the same splitting. In transition from the double d-state into the lower doublet
p-state, there arise three lines (multiple doublets of diffusion series). The splitting values
decreases with increase in both the orbital and principal quantum numbers, but it increases
fast in transitions to atoms with larger serial numbers.
In the hydrogen atom and hydrogen-like ions, the spin-orbit interaction is partially
compensated by relativistic corrections, and the ﬁnal answer for the energy levels does not
contain any dependence on the orbital quantum number:

where α = ke2/ℏc ≈1/137 is called the ﬁne structure constant. Additional degeneration in

P6.3.1. Pauli Exclusion Principle. Structure of Complex Atoms
◮Self-consistent ﬁeld. For many-electron atoms, the problem of describing the atomic
states becomes signiﬁcantly more complicated.
In the general case, it is necessary to
consider the wave function depending on the coordinates and spin variables of all electrons
and to take into account the interaction of electrons not only with the nucleus but also with
one another. But a good description is given by the self-consistent ﬁeld approximation,
in which each electron moves in the average ﬁeld of the nucleus and the other electrons.
The self-consistent ﬁeld potential ϕ(r) is described by the Thomas–Fermi equation, which
permits obtaining the energetically most proﬁtable distribution of electrons in the space
surrounding the atom.
Solving the Schr¨odinger equation for an electron in a self-consistent ﬁeld one can obtain
stationary states whose energy En,l depends on the principal quantum number and the orbital
quantum number. First, it is necessary to ﬁnd the structure of the ground state (with the
least energy) of the atom. What one-electron states are occupied by electrons in the ground
state? At the ﬁrst glance, it seems that it is most proﬁtable to place all the electrons in
the lowest state 1s. But such a distribution of electrons is impossible because of the Pauli
exclusion principle related to the identity property of particles.
◮Particle identity. Pauli principle. The particle identity principle in quantum mechanics
has a stronger meaning than that in classical mechanics. In classical physics, particles are

P6.3. STRUCTURE AND SPECTRA OF COMPLEX ATOMS
587
identical but distinguishable from one another; for example, a permutation of two electrons
results in a state that must be taken into account as a new state independent of the initial
state. Unlike this, in quantum mechanics, particles are identical and indistinguishable, so
that the state arising from permutation of particles absolutely identically coincides with the
initial state. This means that |ψ(1, 2)|2 = |ψ(2, 1)|2. There are two possibilities: either the
wave function is symmetric with respect to particle states, so that ψ(1, 2) = ψ(2, 1), or it is
antisymmetric, so that ψ(1, 2) = –ψ(2, 1). The particles of the ﬁrst type are called bosons, the
particles of the second type are called fermions. In particle physics, it is proved that bosons
are particles with integer spin and the fermions are particles with half-integer spin. If the
wave function is constructed of one-particle wave functions, then it must be symmetrized
in the case of bosons and antisymmetrized in the case of fermions. For example, in the
case of two bosons with one-particle states ψ1 and ψ2, the wave function has the form
ψ(r1, r2) =
1
√
2 [ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2) + ψ2(r1)ψ1(r2)], and in the case of two fermions, it has the
form ψ(r1, r2) =
1
√
2 [ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2) – ψ2(r1)ψ1(r2)].
Electrons are fermions, and hence a system of several electrons is described by an
antisymmetric (in particle states) wave function. In such a system (just as in a system of any
identical fermions), the Pauli exclusion principle acts: two electrons cannot be in absolutely
equal quantum states; indeed, the wave function of such a state must be identically zero.
◮Periodic table (Mendeleev’s table). To describe the electronic structure of the ground
state of an atom with atomic number Z, one must place Z electrons in different quantum
states with least possible energy. To calculate electronic states, one can choose any set of
independent quantum numbers of a single electron; for example, just as in the case of alkali
metals, these can be n, l, j, and mj. But it is more convenient to neglect the spin-orbit
interaction and use the numbers n, l, ml, and ms for an electron in a centrally symmetric
self-consistent ﬁeld. (To completely description the terms of the ground and excited states,
one must choose a set of quantum numbers that describe the state of the entire atom and
correspond to quantities that are conserved.)
All the electrons with the same principal quantum number n correspond to one electron
shell. The maximum number of electrons in the nth shell is equal to 2n2. The shell with
n = 1 is called the K-shell, the shell with n = 2 is called the L-shell, and further, by the
alphabet. All electrons in a given shell with a ﬁxed number l form an electron subshell
with 2(2l + 1) electrons; l = 0, . . . , n – 1. The electrons of a given shell with a larger
value of l have a larger energy due to increasing contribution of the centrifugal energy.
The electron state is denoted by the number of the principal quantum number followed by
the letter corresponding to its orbital number. If an atom contains several electrons in the
same subshell, then the superscript on the right is the number of electrons. We present the
electron conﬁgurations for several atoms:
K-shell:
1H: 1s,
2He: 1s2;
L-shell:
3Li: 1s2 2s,

17Cl: [Ne]3s2 3p5,
18Ar: [Ne]3s2 3p6;

s-subshell in the N-shell:
19K: [Ne]3s2 3p6 4s,
20Ca: [Ne]3s2 3p6 4s2;
d-subshell in the M-shell:
21Sc: [Ne]3s2 3p6 3d 4s2,
22Ti: [Ne]3s2 3p6 3d2 4s2,
23V: [Ne]3s2 3p6 3d3 4s2,
24Cr: [Ne]3s2 3p6 3d5 4s;
and so on. The notation [Ne] stands for the electron conﬁguration of 10Ne (1s2 2s2 2p6).
One can see that, starting from number 19, the sequential ﬁlling of shells is violated:
the energy of s-electrons in the N-shell is less than that of d-electrons in the M-shell
and the 4s-subshell is ﬁlled before the 3d-subshell (see also Chapter S7). The chemical
properties of elements are determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell,
and this results in the periodicity of chemical properties. For example, the noble gases—
helium 2He, neon 10Ne, argon 18Ar, krypton 36Kr, xenon 54Xe, and radon 86Rn—differ
in that their p-subshells are complete, and hence these elements have a large energy of
ionization and tend to be chemically inert.
The atoms with further numbers (lithium,
sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium) have complete p-subshells and one
electron in the outermost s-subshell. These atoms form the group of alkali metals; they
have a small energy of ionization and are all highly reactive.
We note that the total angular momentum and the total magnetic moment of any com-
pletely ﬁlled shell are zero.
P6.3.2. Spectra of Complex Atoms
◮Addition of orbital and spin angular momenta. In light and medium atoms, the spin-
orbit interaction is weak for separate electrons, and the addition of angular momenta occurs
by the following scheme. The orbital angular momenta of electrons are added together
to form the total orbital angular momentum bL, which is characterized by the quantum
number L, and the electron spins are added up to make the total spin angular momentum
bS (quantum number S). In turn, the orbital and spin angular momenta add up to form the
atom total angular momentum bJ. Such a scheme is called the normal LS-coupling or the
Russell–Saunders coupling. The number L is always integer, and the number S is integer if
the shell contains an even number of electrons and is half-integer if the number of electrons
is odd. We note that one must add up only the angular momenta of electrons in an unﬁlled
shell.
In heavy atoms, the angular momenta are added together according to the scheme called the jj-coupling.
First, one adds up the orbital and spin angular momenta of each individual electron (ji = li + si) and then the
electron angular momenta are added up to form the total angular momentum of the atom (J = P
i ji).
◮Classiﬁcation of terms of complex atoms. In the case of normal coupling, the total
angular momentum is preserved (the value and the projection) and the values of the orbital
and spin angular momenta. Each term is characterized by the quantum numbers L, S
and J and, in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, it is (2J + 1)-fold degenerate (the states that
differ only in the value of the total angular momentum projection have the same energy).
For given L and S, the quantum number J can take 2S + 1 values from L – S to L + S,
and hence the number 2S + 1 is called the term mutliplicity. The difference between the
energies of terms in the same multiplet is determined by a comparatively weak spin-orbit
interaction. The spectral notation of terms is: the orbital quantum number of an atom is

P6.3. STRUCTURE AND SPECTRA OF COMPLEX ATOMS
589
denoted by the capital letter S, P, D, F, G, and further in alphabetical order (to distinguish
from one-electron states, where the lowercase letters are used). The subscript on the right
shows the number J, which distinguished this term in the multiplet, and the superscript
on the left indicates the term multiplicity 2S + 1. (It should be noted that, for L < S, the
actual multiplicity of a term is equal to 2L + 1, but it is conventional to show 2S + 1.) For
example, the term 2P3/2 corresponds to the quantum numbers L = 1, S = 1/2, and J = 3/2.
In addition, in the scheme of spectral transitions, where the excited states must be shown,
the principal quantum number of the excited electron is given (the least number is equal to
the number of the shell to which the unﬁlled subshell belongs).
◮The Hund rule. In the addition of spin and orbital angular momenta of electrons, one
can obtain distinct quantum numbers. To understand what quantum numbers correspond
to the ground state of the atom, one can use the empirical Hund rules. The ﬁrst rule says
that the term with the least energy has the maximum S and, for this S, the value of L is a
maximum. (First, one determines the maximum possible mS and mL and they are used to
determine S and L.) The second rule: J = |L – S| if less than half the subshell is ﬁlled, and
J = L + S otherwise. The meaning of the ﬁrst Hund rule is that if electrons have the same
spin states, then they have different spatial states, which corresponds to the lesser energy of
interaction between the electrons. For example, for carbon with subshell 2p2, the total spin
is equal to S = 1, and the orbital number cannot take the maximum value L = 2, because,
in this case, the two electrons would have the same quantum numbers ml = 1; hence L = 1,
and since two electrons occupy less than half the p-subshell, where there are 6 places, it
follows that J = |L – S| = 0. The principal term of the carbon atom is 3P0. Verify that the
principal term of the nitrogen atom is 4S3/2.
◮Selection rules. When constructing the scheme of spectral lines of an atom and deter-
mining the multiplicity of a radiation line, it is necessary to use both the term multiplicity
and the selection rules for transitions between the terms. The selection rules for radiation
transitions can be obtained by calculating the probability of transitions between the states.
But the meaning of the selection rules can be understood using the momentum conservation
law and taking into account the fact that the spin of an emitted photon is equal to 1.
The selection rule for the number J is: ∆J = 0, ±1, but the transition between two
states with J = 0 is forbidden. The selection rule for the number mJ is: ∆mJ = 0, ±1. The
selection rule for the quantum number S is: ∆S = 0. The selection rule for the quantum
number L is: ∆L = 0, ±1, but the transition between two states with L = 0 is forbidden.
In atoms with a single electron in an unﬁlled subshell, the transitions with ∆L = 0 are
forbidden.
The selection rule for the spin number is related to the fact that the magnetic ﬁeld of
an electromagnetic wave weakly interacts with the magnetic moment of the electron (the
action on the orbital angular momentum is determined by electric forces). For example, in
atoms with two electrons, one can observe independent series for states with S = 0 (singlet
terms) and for states with S = 1 (triplet terms). In the case of helium, the data are described
using the historical concept about two types of helium: parahelium (S = 0) and orthohelium
(S = 1).
◮Characteristic X-ray spectra. In the bombardment of the anode of an electron tube
by energetic electrons (with energies ∼102–104 eV), one can observe the X-ray radiation
of two types. The slowing-down radiation is related to radiation of X-ray quanta directly
by electrons. A typical characteristic of this radiation is a short-wavelength boundary of
the spectrum (see Subsection P5.3.2) and a smooth distribution of the radiation intensity
over the spectrum. Against this background, there are several intensive narrow lines of the
characteristic radiation. Such a radiation appears in the case of liberation of an electron
belonging to one of the inner electron subshells, after which the free place is occupied by an

590
QUANTUM MECHANICS. ATOMIC PHYSICS
electron from a higher subshell and an X-ray quant is radiated. If one of the two electrons
in the K-shell is liberated, then the following notation is used for the X-ray lines: Kα for
the electron transition from the L-shell, Kβ for the electron transition from the M-shell,
etc. If an electron is liberated from the L-shell, then the spectral lines are denoted by Lα,
Lβ, etc.
For electrons in the inner subshells, the ﬁeld of the nucleus is nearly unscreened.
Therefore, in contrast to electrons in the outer subshells, the energy of inner subshell
electrons must strongly depend on the serial number of the nucleus. One can expect that the
energy of these electron levels must be described by the formula for hydrogen-like atoms
with the screening correction: En = R(Z – δ)2/n2. But such an approach does not give any
good description of experimental facts and the empirical screening correction is introduced
directly in the formula for spectral lines. For example, for the line Kα, we have
1
λ = 3
4 Rλ(Z – σ)2,
where the screening correction σ for light atoms is approximately equal to 1. This law was
discovered in 1913 by Moseley, who formulated it as the law of linear dependence of √ν
for the characteristic line frequency on the serial number Z. The Moseley law allowed one
to specify the serial numbers of many elements in the periodic table.
Since the X-ray spectrum is determined by the atomic inner subshell, it is independent
of whether the atom is isolated or is contained in a molecule or a crystal. Therefore, the
matter composition can be analyzed by using the characteristic X-ray spectra with a high
universality.
Similarly to the optical spectra, the X-ray spectra have a ﬁne structure because of the
splitting of the levels of inner subshell electrons. But, in this case, one deals not with the
normal LS-coupling but with the jj-coupling. For example, an electron in the L-shell can
have l = 0 and then j = 1/2 or l = 1 and then the following two versions are possible: j = 1/2
or j = 3/2. Hence, the L-shell splits into three lines, and the difference in their energies is
determined by the spin-orbit interaction. The K-shell contains only one level, the M-shell
contains ﬁve levels, etc. In the analysis of spectra, one must follow the selection rules
∆l = ±1 and ∆j = 0, ±1. For example, the Kα line splits into two lines: Kα1 and Kα2, and
there is no transition from the level with l = 0.
The study of absorption of the X-ray radiation directly allows one to see the position
of energy levels of electrons in inner subshells. As the frequency increases, the absorption
coefﬁcients decreases smoothly, but for frequency equal to ωi = Ei/ℏ, where Ei is the
energy of ionization of the electron from one of the inner levels, one observes a sharp
increase in this coefﬁcient, which is related to the fact that an addition absorption channel
opens. According to the above, one can observe a single peak on the energy of the K-shell,
three peaks on the energy of the L-shell, ﬁve peaks on the energy of the M-shell, etc.
◮Atom in an external magnetic ﬁeld. In sufﬁciently weak magnetic ﬁelds (B < 1 Tesla),
the energy of the electron interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld is small compared with the spin-
orbit interaction, and the magnetic splitting of terms is small compared with the distance
between the terms of the multiplet. In this case, one observes a complicated (anomalous)
Zeeman effect; that is, the energy level splits into 2J + 1 sublevels with distinct quantum
numbers mJ, and the distance between the sublevels is proportional to the value of the
magnetic ﬁeld and depends on the quantum numbers L, S and J. The value of the sublevel
displacement is given by the formula ∆E = gJmJµBB, where µB is the Bohr magneton,
and
gJ = 1 + J(J + 1) + S(S + 1) – L(L + 1)
2J(J + 1)
is called the Land´e splitting factor.

P6.4. ELEMENTS OF PHYSICS OF MOLECULES
591
The complicated character of the Zeeman effect in weak ﬁelds can be explained by an anomalous value
of the spin magnetic moment for which the gyromagnetic ratio is equal to 2. As a result, the total magnetic
moment bµ = – e
2m (bL + 2bS) is not proportional to the total angular momentum bJ. In the vector model, the
magnetic moment can be represented as rapidly rotating about the preserved vector of total angular momentum,
and, after averaging, only the magnetic moment projection onto the total angular momentum must remain:
µJ = J (µJ)
J2
= – e
2m J (L + 2S)(L + S)
J2
.
We express (LS) = 1
2 (J2 – L2 – S2), replace J2 by J(J + 1), L2 by L(L + 1), and S2 by S(S + 1) and obtain
µJ = – e
2m gJJ, where gJ is the Land´e splitting factor, whose expression was given above.
We note that even for nonzero S, L, and J, the Land´e splitting factor can be zero
(S = 3/2, L = 2, J = 1/2) and even be negative (S = 5/2, L = 3, J = 1/2). These effects
are purely quantum and do not have classical analogs.
To obtain the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic ﬁeld, one must take the selection
rule into account. For example, the level 2P3/2 splits into 4 levels with the Land´e splitting
factor 4
3 , and the singlet level 2S1/2 splits into two levels with the Land´e splitting factor 2
(Fig. P6.8), but one observes not 8 lines but 6, because the transitions from mJ = 3/2
to mJ = –1/2 and from mJ = –3/2 to mJ = 1/2 are forbidden by the selection rule
∆mJ = 0, ±1.
Figure P6.8. Anomalous Zeeman effect.
The simple Zeeman effect (splitting of one line into three) is observed in transition
between the levels for which g1 = g2 = g. In this case, ∆ω = g∆mJB/ℏ, where ∆mJ = 0, ±1.
Such a situation appears not only in transitions between two singlet levels (S = 0, g = 1)
but also in some other cases.
If an atom is placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld (if the magnetic splitting of terms is much
larger than the distance between the multiplet terms), then the ﬁne structure of levels can
be neglected—that is, the spin-orbit interaction can be neglected. The level with quantum
numbers mL, mS is displaced in the magnetic ﬁeld by ∆E = µBB(mL + 2mS). The
variation in the frequency of radiation is equal to ℏ∆ω = µBB(∆mL + ∆mS). With the
selection rule ∆mS = 0, ∆mL = 0, ±1 taken into account, we see that the each line splits
into three—two displaced lines and one undisplaced; hence, the Zeeman effect becomes
simple in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. This phenomenon is called the Paschen–Buck effect.
P6.4. Elements of Physics of Molecules
A molecule is a bound state of an electroneutral system consisting of nuclei of several atoms
and of electrons surrounding them. The molecules of two atoms are said to be diatomic,
the molecules of three and more atoms are said to be polyatomic.
The molecule with
insufﬁcient or excessive number of electrons is called a molecular ion.
We consider only the simplest diatomic systems such as the hydrogen molecule H2 and
the hydrogen molecular ion H+
2.

QUANTUM MECHANICS. ATOMIC PHYSICS
P6.4.1. Classiﬁcation of Levels of a Molecule
◮Energy hierarchy. Like an atom, a molecule is a microscopic system and has discrete
energy levels corresponding to its ground and bound excited states. But, in contrast with
an atom, in addition to the electron energy corresponding to possible states of electrons in
the ﬁeld of stationary nuclei, there also are two types of motion in a molecule: oscillatory
motion related to variations in the distance between the nuclei, and rotation of the molecule
as a whole about an axis. The molecule energy (counted from the ground state) can be
assumed to be equal to the sum of energies corresponding to the above-listed motions:
E = Eel + Evib + Erot.
(P6.4.1.1)
There exists a pronounced hierarchy of these energies: Eel ≫Evib ≫Erot. For outermost
shell electrons, Eel is of the order of several eV, Evib is of the order of 10–2 eV, and Erot is of
the order of 10–4 eV. Just as Erot/Evib, the ratio Evib/Eel is equal, in the order of magnitude,
to
p
m/M, where m is the mass of electron, and M is the mass of the nucleus; that is, for
heavy molecules, the energy hierarchy increases.
In the ﬁrst approximation, all three energies are quantized independently, and to each of
them there corresponds its own system of discrete levels. The energy spectrum of a molecule
is the set of distant electron levels, more closely located vibrational levels, and even more
closely located rotational levels. The system of levels is schematically shown in Fig. P6.9
for two neighboring electron levels, where the letters v and J denote the vibrational and
rotational quantum numbers.

Figure P6.10. Dependence of electron energy of a
molecule on the distance between the atoms.
◮The wave function of a molecule. The wave function of a molecule can be represented
as the product of wave functions of motions of three types. Each of these functions, just
as the corresponding values of energies, can be obtained by solving the corresponding
Schr¨odinger equation. First, one solves the Schr¨odinger equation for electrons for a given
distance R between the nuclei; this energy depends on R as on a parameter. The energy of
interaction between the nuclei is equal to the sum of the electron energy and the energy of
the Coulomb repulsion of the nuclei. For some electron levels, this energy has the form of
a potential well (curve a in Fig. P6.10), for the other levels (curve b), it has the form of a
monotone dependence.

P6.4. ELEMENTS OF PHYSICS OF MOLECULES
593
In the ﬁrst case, there exists a bound state, in the second case, there is no bound state.
For the electron ground state, the interaction energy has the form of a potential well, and the
depth of this well has the meaning of the molecule dissipation energy. (More precisely, the
dissipation energy D is less than the well depth by the energy of the zero-point vibrational
level counted from the well depth equal to ℏω/2.)
After the dependence of the energy of interaction between the nuclei on the distance R
is calculated, one solves the problem about oscillations near the bottom of the obtained
potential well and about rotations of a molecule with the distance between the nuclei equal
to the average equilibrium distance R0.
P6.4.2. Electron Energy. Theory of Chemical Bond
◮One electron in the ﬁeld of two nuclei. We begin with a molecular ion H+
2. In this case,
the potential of two protons for the motion of a single electron has a cylindrical symmetry
with respect to the molecule axis but does not have the spherical symmetry intrinsic to
the hydrogen atom. Moreover, the angular momentum projection on the molecule axis is
preserved, but the angular momentum magnitude is not. The energy levels are characterized
by the magnitude of the magnetic quantum number ml, which is denoted by the letter λ:
λ = |ml| = 0, 1, . . . . The electron states with λ = 0, 1, 2, . . . are denoted by the letters
σ, π, δ, . . . and are called molecular orbitals. With spin taken into account, the σ-state is
twice degenerate, and the states with λ > 0 are fourfold degenerate. In the σ-state, the
electron density is concentrated in the region between the nuclei, the nuclei are attracted
to the electron cloud, and thus the attraction between the nuclei described by the potential
well a in Fig. P6.10 is realized (for small R, repulsion between the nuclei predominates).
The dissipation energy H+
2 is equal to 2.65 eV. For π-electrons, the electron density has
the form of two clouds located between the nuclei symmetrically with respect to a plane
passing through the molecule axis, and the electron density in the plane itself is zero.
◮Hydrogen molecule. In the hydrogen molecule, the chemical bond is realized not by
one but by two electrons that are attracted to the nuclei, but repulse from one another.
Just as in the case of any fermions, the wave function of two electrons must change the
sign in their permutation. If the spin wave function is symmetric with respect to a particle
permutation (the spins are parallel, and hence S = 1), then the coordinate wave function is
antisymmetric and conversely. The state with antiparallel spins (S = 0) and a symmetric
coordinate wave function has a lesser energy. In this state, the probability for an electron to
stay in the space between the nuclei is sufﬁciently large and the nuclei are attracted to the
electron cloud located between them.
Thus, the chemical bond is realized by two electrons with antiparallel spins.
The
dependence of the potential electrostatic energy on the distance between the nuclei has
the form of curve a in Fig. P6.10. The hydrogen molecule dissociation energy is equal to
4.5 eV; this is less than the doubled energy of dissociation of the molecular ion H+
2 because
of the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons. For electrons with parallel spins, the
dependence of the energy on the distance between the nuclei has the form of curve b in
Fig. P6.10; that is, no bound state is formed.
This mechanism is called the covalent (homeopolar) chemical bond. It is realized not
only in the hydrogen molecule but by any pair of outermost shell electrons in complex
atoms combined in a molecule. For diatomic molecules consisting of different atoms, there
exists another mechanism, called the ionic (heteropolar) chemical bond, in which one of the
atoms gives part of the outermost shell electrons to another atom that has vacancies in the
outermost subshell. As a result, two ions are formed that, at large distances, are attracted
by the Coulomb law and, at small distances, begin to repulse. Intermediate cases between
the covalent and ionic bonds are possible.

594
QUANTUM MECHANICS. ATOMIC PHYSICS
◮Exchange energy. The difference in the energies of the symmetric and antisymmetric
states has the general character and is a consequence of the so-called exchange interaction,
which is a pure quantum phenomenon. The meaning of this phenomenon is reduced to the
following. We construct a coordinate wave function of two electrons in the ﬁeld of two
nuclei from the one-electron wave functions ψα(r1) and ψβ(r2). This function can be either
symmetric or antisymmetric (depending on the form of the spin function):
ϕ(r1, r2) =
1
√
2
 ψα(r1)ψβ(r2) ± ψα(r2)ψβ(r1)

.
The average potential energy in these states is equal to
〈U〉=

Z
ψα(r1)ψ∗
β(r1)bUψβ(r2)ψ∗
α(r2)d3r1d3r2,
where bU is the potential energy of interaction of the electrons between each other and with
the nuclei. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the usual classical interaction of electron clouds
and the nuclei. The second term is called the exchange energy, it is different from zero only
in the case where the electron wave functions overlap. In the case of hydrogen molecule,
the exchange energy is negative, and therefore, the state with a symmetric coordinate wave
function has a lesser energy.
The exchange energy manifests itself in many quantum systems, in particular, it is
responsible for the difference between the energies of the singlet and triplet states of
electrons in the helium atom.
The chemical bond is usually approximately calculated by one of the two methods. In
the method of electron pairs, for the initial one-particle wave functions ψ(r1) and ψ(r2) one
takes the atomic wave functions of electrons localized near the ﬁrst and second nuclei. As
the nuclei approach each other, the wave functions begin to overlap, the exchange energy
increase and a bound state is formed. In the method of molecular orbitals, the electrons
successively ﬁll the free σ, π, δ molecular states with different spins and thus form closed
electron shells.
P6.4.3. Vibrational and Rotational Spectra
◮Vibrational levels. The energy of interaction between the nuclei, shown in Fig. P6.10,
has the minimum for R = R0. Near this point, the energy can be expanded in a series and
represented as
U(R) = U(R0) + 1
2 k(R – R0)2 + · · · ,
where k = d2U/dR2
R=R0 is a quasi-elastic constant.
The cyclic frequency of small
oscillations of a molecule near the equilibrium is equal to ωvib =
p
k/µ, where µ =
m1m2/(m1 + m2) is the reduced mass of a diatomic molecule (see Subsection P1.6.4). For
permitted values of the oscillator energy, quantum mechanics gives values
E – U(R0) = ℏωvib(v + 1
2 ),
v = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
For large v, the terms neglected in U(R) become essential. If these are taken into account,
the distance between the levels begins to decrease.
◮Rotational levels. The rotational energy levels of a molecule are obtained as eigenvalues
of the operator
bH =
bL2
2I ,
(P6.4.3.1)

P6.4. ELEMENTS OF PHYSICS OF MOLECULES
595
where bL is the operator of angular momentum and I is the moment of inertia of the molecule
with respect to the center of mass. A rotating system with a constant moment of inertia,
which is described by the Hamiltonian (P6.4.3.1), is called a rotator. The permitted values
of the rotator energy are
E = ℏ2
2I J(J + 1),
J = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
The frequency of radiation or absorption is obtained from the relation
ℏω = ∆Eel + ∆Erot + ∆Evib,
(P6.4.3.2)
where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the transition between distinct electron levels, the second
term corresponds to the variation in the vibrational state, and the third term corresponds to
the variation in the state of rotation.
If the electron state does not vary in the transition (∆Eel = 0), then one observes either
the pure rotational spectrum (if ∆Evib = 0) or the vibrational-rotational spectrum. For the
pure rotational and vibrational-rotational transitions, one has the selection rule δv = ±1 and
∆J = ±1.
For the pure rotational transitions (∆Eel =0 and ∆Evib =0), the variation in the rotational
energy is equal to
∆Erot = E(J + 1) – E(J) = ℏ2
I (J + 1).
One can see that the rotational transitions form a system of close equidistant spectral lines
ωrot, 2ωrot, . . . , where ωrot = ℏ2/I (Fig. P6.11). The rotational lines can be resolved only by
devices with a very high resolving power, but usually they are perceived as lines of ﬁnite
width. The pure rotational transitions correspond to absorption in the far infrared region
(hundreds and thousands of µm).
The vibrational transitions (for ∆Eel = 0) are observed in absorption in the near infrared
region (of several µm).
Since, in this case, one usually has ∆Erot ≠0, one observes
a vibrational-rotational band of ﬁnite width rather than an inﬁnitely thin line. With the
selection rules taken into account, we obtain
∆Evib + ∆Erot = ℏ(ωvib ± nωrot),
(n = 1, 2, . . . ).
Hence, the distance between neighboring lines at the center of the band is equal to 2ωrot
(Fig. P6.12).
The character of the vibrational-rotational spectra becomes signiﬁcantly more complicated if the fact
that the oscillations are anharmonic is taken into account. As R – R0 increases, the potential energy curve
(Fig. P6.10) becomes nonsymmetric. First of all, this results in displacement of vibrational levels; that is, as v
increases, the vibrational levels approach one another. Moreover, in the state with larger v, the average distance
between the atoms increases, and hence the moment of inertia increases with increasing v, while ωvib decreases.
This results in that the lines in the vibrational-rotational band cease to be equidistant.
But if ∆Eel ≠0, then one observes the electron spectra of emission and absorption in the
visible and ultraviolet regions. To each electron transition, there corresponds a system of
vibrational-rotational bands. In contrast to the vibrational-rotational transitions, in the case
of transitions with variation in the electron state, the selection rules ∆v = ±1 is not satisﬁed;
that is, the transitions between levels with any values of vibrational quantum numbers are
possible. Therefore, one can observe not a single vibrational-rotational band, but a series
of bands separated from one another by ωvib.
We note that diatomic molecules with zero dipole moment (for example, N2 and O2) do
not have vibrational-rotational spectra. Just for this reason, such molecules do not absorb
in the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum, and the absorption by air of the IR radiation
occurs because the air contains the molecules H2O and CO2.

Quantum Theory of Crystals
Although the laws of quantum mechanics act on an atomic scale, they also affect the macro-
scopic properties of gases, liquids, and rigid bodies. Quantum mechanics and quantum
statistics—that is, statistics of indistinguishable particles—allowed one to obtain correct
and consistent descriptions of thermal, magnetic, and many other properties of large en-
sembles of particles. Here a special place is occupied by quantum theory of crystals, which
allowed one to remove several unsolvable contradictions of classical theory, to obtain quan-
titative description of electromagnetic properties of some classes of matter, to explain the
superconductivity and superﬂuidity, etc.
P7.1. Quantum Statistical Distributions and Their
Application
P7.1.1. Elements of Quantum Statistics
Quantum statistics studies the statistical properties of large ensembles of identical indis-
tinguishable particles, fermions and bosons. Statistics of classical (i.e., distinguishable)
particles is called the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (see Subsection P2.5.4). Statistics of
fermions—that is, indistinguishable particles that cannot share identical states—is called
the Fermi–Dirac statistics. Statistics of bosons—that is, indistinguishable particles that
can share identical states—is called the Bose–Einstein statistics.
◮Statistical distributions. Statistics of each type is characterized by its own statistical
distribution of particles over states. A statistical distribution tells the average number of
particles in a given state under the condition that the system is in thermal equilibrium. The
most important property of all distributions is that they are functions of a single parameter,
the particle energy:* 〈N〉= f(ε).
In quantum mechanics, the notion of a state of a single particle is assumed to be quite
deﬁnite, but only under certain conditions. For the energy levels of a particle system to be
discrete, the system must be localized in a ﬁnite region of space. Usually, it is assumed
that the system is closed in a box of a sufﬁciently large volume V . Moreover, the notion of
a one-particle state with a certain energy assumes that there is no interparticle interaction.
This last difﬁculty can be overcome by introducing a self-consistent external ﬁeld, which
includes the averaged ﬁeld of the other particles.
For an ensemble of classical particles, one introduces the notion of an elementary cell
of phase space. The phase space is the space of three coordinates and three momenta.
In classical physics, to each state there corresponds one point of the phase space. In this
case, the elementary cell corresponding to a single state is introduced for convenience in
statistical description, and it can have an arbitrary (sufﬁciently small) volume. In quantum
mechanics, a state of a particle cannot be represented by a point in the phase space, because
* In what follows, the energy of an individual particle is denoted by ε and the energy of the system, by E.

QUANTUM THEORY OF CRYSTALS
there are uncertainties in its position and momentum, which are related by the Heisenberg
relations ∆x∆px ∼ℏ, etc. One can see that the volume ∆x∆y∆z∆px∆py∆pz ∼ℏ3 must
correspond to each individual state. A more precise analysis shows that the volume of an
elementary cell is equal to (2πℏ)3. To understand how many states there are contained in
a ﬁnite region of the phase space, it is necessary to divide its volume by the volume of the
elementary cell. Such an approach in which the elementary volume of a single state for a
classical particle is chosen from quantum considerations is said to be semiclassical.
◮Microscopic and macroscopicstates. Statistical weight. Tointroduce the microscopic
state (microstate) of a system means to deﬁne the state of all its particles at a given time
instant. In classical physics, it is required to determine the coordinates and momenta of
all particles—that is, the positions of all particles in the phase space. In the semiclassical
approach, one ﬁnds the distribution of particles over elementary cells of volume (2πℏ)3 each.
In quantum mechanics, one determines the distribution of particles over states with a certain
energy (for the motion in a self-consistent ﬁeld). For convenience of our presentation, we
combine the last two cases and also call the states of particles with a certain energy cells.
Due to interparticle interaction and external forces, the microstate of the system varies
all the time and one can observe only the average characteristics in terms of which the
macrostate can be determined.
To describe the macrostate quantitatively, let us divide the entire set of cells into boxes.
Each box contains a large amount of cells with very close energy values lying within a
narrow energy interval (ε, ε+∆ε). Denote the number of particles in the ith box by Ni. We
assume that the macrostate is determined by a set of numbers Ni, and hence all microstates
with identical sets of these numbers belong to the same macrostate.
Without loss of generality, we consider a system of particles contained in a box with
rigid thermally insulated walls, so that its total energy remains unchanged.
Why does this assumption not restrict the generality of consideration? First of all, we are interested in the
properties of the equilibrium macrostate, and in this case, the energy of a large ensemble of particles can be
determined with a very high accuracy under any external conditions. For example, for a system of N particles
in a thermostat, the relative deviation from the average energy is 1/
√
N. Let us explain this with an example
of an ideal gas. If the average energy of a single particle is equal to 〈ε〉and the root mean square deviation from
the average energy is δε =
p
〈(ε – 〈ε〉)2〉, then the average energy of the system is equal to 〈E〉= N〈ε〉, and the
root mean square deviation is

we have taken into account the fact that the deviations of the energies of distinct particles from the average
value are mutually independent.
◮The principal postulate of statistical physics for a system with a ﬁxed energy states
that all the microstates admissible for it (that is, those with a given value of total energy)
are realized with equal probability. This postulate is closely related to the so-called ergodic
hypothesis stating that, in the process of time evolution, the system passes through all
admissible microstates.
The main conclusion from the principal postulate is the following: the greatest part of
time the system is in the macrostates to which there corresponds the greatest number of
microstates. The number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate is called its
statistical weight and is denoted by W. The macrostate with maximum W is called the
equilibrium macrostate. According to the Boltzmann postulate (see Subsection P2.4.4), the
system entropy in a given macrostate is related to its statistical weight as follows:
S = k ln W.

P7.1. QUANTUM STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION
599
The deviations from the equilibrium state are called ﬂuctuations. We note that, because of
an enormous number of particles, a large deviation in the system has an extremely small
probability; that is, only small ﬂuctuations are practically observable. If the system was
initially in a highly non-equilibrium state, then, as the system evolves, it must move from
macrostates with lesser statistical weights (lesser entropy) to a macrostate with a larger
entropy approaching the equilibrium (the second law of thermodynamics).
◮Equilibrium macrostates. In order to ﬁnd out which particle distribution over boxes,
{N1, N2, . . . }, corresponds to equilibrium, one must calculate W(N1, N2, . . . ) or S/k =
ln W and take the maximum of this expression (taking into account the conditions that
P
i εiNi = E and P
i Ni = N). The expressions for the statistical weight and entropy are
signiﬁcantly different for particles with different types of statistical behavior. Below are
the expressions of the statistical weight for three different statistical models:
for the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics,
W =
Y
i
gNi
i
N!
N1! N2! . . . ,
for the Bose–Einstein statistics,
W =
Y
i
(Ni + gi – 1)!
Ni! (gi – 1)! ,
and for in the Fermi–Dirac statistics,
W =
Y
i
gi!
Ni! (gi – Ni)! ,
where gi stands for the number of cells in the ith box.
The equilibrium state {Ni} corresponding to the maximum statistical weight under the
condition that E and N are ﬁxed can be found using the method of Lagrange multipliers.
(It is necessary to ﬁnd the maximum of the expression (S/k) – α P
i Ni – β P
i εiNi under
the assumption that all Ni are independent. Then the Lagrange multipliers α and β are
determined from the equations P
i Ni = N and P
i εiNi = E.) We obtain the following
expressions:
for the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics,
Ni = gie–αe–βεi;
for the Bose–Einstein statistics,
Ni =
gi
eαeβεi – 1
and for the Fermi–Dirac statistics,
Ni =
gi
eαeβεi + 1 .
The average number of particles per cell is obtained by dividing these expressions by gi.
The physical meaning of the multipliers α and β can be clariﬁed from thermodynamical
considerations. We write the maximum condition for the expression (S/k) – αN – βE

600
QUANTUM THEORY OF CRYSTALS
in the form T dS/kT – β dE – α dN = 0 and compare with the thermodynamical identity
T dS – dU – µ dN = 0, which holds for variations in the state under constant volume. We
obtain β = 1/kT and α = µ/kT, where µ is the chemical potential.
Finally, the quantum distributions take the form:
Bose–Einstein distribution:
〈N〉= fB(ε) =
1
e(ε–µ)/kT – 1 .
(P7.1.1.1)
Fermi–Dirac distribution:
〈N〉= fF(ε) =
1
e(ε–µ)/kT + 1 .
(P7.1.1.2)
The chemical potential µ for a system with a ﬁxed number of particles, N, is calculated
as
N =
X
i
gif(εi),
where f(εi) is the corresponding distribution (Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac). But if the
number of particles in the system is not ﬁxed, then the chemical potential must be set to
zero.
For ε – µ ≫kT, both quantum distributions become the classical Maxwell–Boltzmann
distribution:
〈N〉= Ae–ε/kT .
(1)
This is related to the fact that the average number of particles in a cell is small, and the
exclusion rules and the particle identity become insigniﬁcant.
Usually, the least possible value of energy (energy of the lowest level) is set to be zero.
◮Properties of the Bose–Einstein distribution.
1) Bosons are particles with integer value of the intrinsic angular momentum (spin).
Examples of bosons are π-mesons, photons, and phonons.
2) The chemical potential of bosons cannot be positive: µ ≤0.
3) As T →0, the chemical potential tends to zero and vanishes at T = 0.
4) At T = 0, all particles are in the lowest energy state with ε = 0.
At ﬁnite but
sufﬁciently low temperatures, a ﬁnite fraction of all particles is in the lowest energy state.
This phenomenon is called Bose–Einstein condensation, and the ensemble of particles
in the lowest state is called a Bose–Einstein condensate. Condensation of bosons begins at
a certain critical temperature (the condensation temperature). This phenomenon plays an
important role in the explanation of phenomena such as superﬂuidity and superconductivity.
5) An example of the Bose–Einstein distribution is the Planck formula for the pho-
ton distribution over energies (Subsection P5.4.1). The number of photons is not ﬁxed;
therefore, µ = 0.
◮Properties of the Fermi–Dirac distribution.
1) Fermions are particles with half-integer spin. Examples of fermions are electrons,
protons, neutrons, and µ-mesons.
2) The chemical potential of the Fermi gas can be either positive or negative. At low
temperatures, the chemical potential is positive. The chemical potential of fermion gas for
T = 0 is called the Fermi energy and is denoted by εF.
3) At T = 0, the energy-dependence of the average number of particles in a cell 〈N〉
has the form of a sharp step: for ε < εF, the cells are ﬁlled with particles (〈N〉= fF(ε) = 1),
and for ε > εF, the cells are free (fF(ε) = 0).

P7.1. QUANTUM STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATION
601
4) At low temperatures (kT ≪εF), the dependence fF(ε) has the form of a smoothed
step (Fig. P7.1). The spreading width is equal to kT in the order of magnitude. For ε = µ,
the average number of particles is equal to 1/2. For kT ≪εF, the particle distribution over
energies radically differs from the classical distribution; in this case, the gas is said to be
degenerate. For kT ≫εF, the fermion gas does not differ noticeably from the classical gas.

◮Energy density of states. The more speciﬁc properties of an ensemble of bosons or
fermions depend on the physical properties of the system under study, mainly, of the form
of the function G(ε) characterizing the number of states ∆g that correspond to a narrow
energy interval ∆ε calculated per unit volume:
∆g
V
= G(ε)∆ε.
(P7.1.1.4)
This function is called the energy density of states or simply the density of states (cf.
Subsection P5.4.1). For example, the number of particles per unit volume is expressed in
terms of the density of states:
n = N
V =
Z ∞

(P7.1.1.6)
P7.1.2. Electron Gas in Metal
The classical electron theory of metal conductivity originates from the idea that the electrons
in metal can be considered as the classical ideal gas (Subsection P3.7.3). One of the main
difﬁculties encountered by this theory was that the electron contribution to the heat capacity
predicted by this theory was equal to the heat capacity of a monatomic ideal gas Cel = 3
2 kN,
where N is the number of free electrons. It is precisely this value that must be the difference
between the heat capacities of a metal and a dielectric with similar crystal lattices. But
experiment showed that the electron heat capacity at room temperatures is much less than
kN (approximately, by a factor of 100) and varies proportionally to the temperature. These
and some other facts can naturally be explained by the Sommerfeld theory, where the
electrons in metal are considered as a quantum gas of fermions.

602
QUANTUM THEORY OF CRYSTALS
◮Density of states of electron gas. We assume that, inside the metal, the electrons are
free and the work required for an electron to leave the metal is inﬁnitely large; that is, we
treat them as particles in a potential well with inﬁnitely high walls. The boundary conditions
for the wave functions ψx = A sin kxx have the form kxLx = πn, where Lx is the potential
well dimension (that is, the metal sample dimension) along the axis x, kx is the projection
of the wave vector related to the electron momentum as k = p/ℏ, and n is a positive integer
(see Subsection P6.2.2). The boundary conditions for the wave vector identically coincide
with those arising in the case of consideration of electromagnetic oscillations in a closed
cavity (Subsection P5.4.1). Therefore, the density of states in this case has the same form:
dg
V = γ k2 dk
2π2 ,
where V is the vessel volume and γ is a multiplier taking the intrinsic degrees of freedom
into account. In the case of electrons, γ = 2 takes account of the two possible projections
of spin. To pass to the electron momentum, we must replace k2 dk by p2 dp/ℏ3:
dg
V = p2 dp
π2ℏ3 .
We rewrite this formula as
dg = γ V 4πp2 dp
(2πℏ)3
.
One can see that to determine the number of states, it is necessary to divide the phase space volume by the
elementary cell volume (2πℏ)3.
To pass to the energy ε = p2/2m, it is necessary to make the change p =

p dp = m dε:

◮Fermi energy of electrons. At T = 0, all the energy levels from zero to ε = εF are
ﬁlled. To relate the Fermi energy to the electron concentration n, it is necessary to express
the total number of electrons per unit volume and equate with the concentration
Z εF
0
G(ε) dε =
(2m)3/2ε3/2
F

= n.
This implied the Fermi energy:
εF = ℏ2(3π2n)2/3

.
(P7.1.2.1)
The momentum of an electron with Fermi energy is determined by the relation εF = p2
F/2m
and is equal to
pF = ℏ(3π2n)1/3.
(P7.1.2.2)
The surface in momentum space formed by states with ε = εF is called the Fermi surface.
In the case of free electrons, the Fermi surface is a sphere of radius pF.
The density of levels on the Fermi surface is equal to
G(εF) = dn

For T > 0, the chemical potential µ is determined by the equation
n =
Z ∞
0
fF(ε)G(ε) dε.
As the temperature increases, µ gradually decreases, but for kT ≪εF, its difference from εF
is very small: |µ – εF|/εF ≈(π2/12)(kT/εF)2. At a certain temperature T0 (kT0 ≈εF), the
chemical potential is zero, and for higher temperatures, µ < 0 (the chemical potential is
determined from the graph in Fig. P7.1; for ε = µ, we have fF(ε) = 0.5).
To simplify the process of determining the temperature region where the electron gas is
degenerate, one introduces the Fermi temperature by the relation kTF = εF. For T ≪TF,
the electron gas is degenerate. For the majority of metals, TF is equal to several tens of
thousands of degrees, which means that the electron gas in metals is strongly degenerate at
room temperatures.
◮Electron heat capacity of metals. In the case of highly degenerate gas, only those
electrons will participate in thermal motion whose energy differs from the Fermi energy by
a value of the order of kT. Only such electrons can make transitions to a free state with
energy greater than εF. The fraction of such electrons is ∼kT/εF = T/TF and the variation
in their energy is ∼kT. Therefore, as the temperature increases from zero to T, the energy
of degenerate electron gas increases by ∼kNT 2/TF, and the contribution of electrons
to the heat capacity Cel ∼kN(T/TF) varies proportionally to the temperature. (Precise
calculations give the expression Cel = (π2/2)kN(T/TF).) The number of free electrons per
one mole of metal depends on the valency; for example, in the case of an univalent metal,
N ∼NA.
◮Electrical and thermal conduction of metals. The transport theory gives the following
expressions for the electrical and thermal conductivities of electrons (see also Subsections
P3.7.3 and P2.9.2):
σ = ne2λ
m 〈v〉,
κ = 1
3 Cel 〈v〉λ.
Here λ is mean free path and Cel is the heat capacity of electrons per unit volume of metal.
Participating in collisions with ions will be only those electrons that are located near the
Fermi surface; therefore, 〈v〉≈vF = pF/m, which means that the average speed is almost
independent of the temperature. Nevertheless, the Wiedemann–Franz law remains true: the
ratio κ/σ ∼〈v〉2 Cel/n for metals is a linear function of the temperature. But in contrast
with the classical electron gas, where Cel/n is independent of the temperature and 〈v〉2 ∼T,
the linear dependence on the temperature in the Sommerfeld theory is determined by the
electron heat capacity.
The Sommerfeld theory cannot explain the dependence of the electrical conduction of
pure metals on the temperature, because, in this theory, just as in the Drude theory of the
classical electron gas, the mean free path is a pure empirical parameter. The dependence
of the mean free path on the temperature is explained in the theory, where the periodicity
of the crystal lattice ﬁeld and the interaction of electrons with the lattice thermal vibrations
(with phonons) are taken into account.

604
QUANTUM THEORY OF CRYSTALS
◮Richardson–Dashman formula. The Sommerfeld theory permits explaining the tem-
perature dependence for the current of thermoelectron emission from the metal surface. The
metal surface can be left only by the electrons for which p2
z/2m > εF + A, where A is work
of liberation of electron from metal (the axis z is perpendicular to the surface). Omitting
the calculations, we present the answer
j = CT 2 exp(–A/kT),
where the constant C = mek2
2π2ℏ3 = 120 A/(m2 K2) is the same for all metals.
P7.1.3. Heat Capacity of Crystal Lattice. Phonons
◮Dulong–Petit law. The classical statistical physics predicts that the contribution of the
lattice vibrations to the molar heat capacity must be equal to 3R. Indeed, each atom of the
lattice exhibits three independent vibrations near the equilibrium and to each vibrational
degree of freedom there corresponds the average energy kT. The energy of vibrations of
all atoms is equal to 3NkT = 3νRT, and the molar heat capacity of the lattice need not
depend on the temperature and be equal to 3R. Indeed, at room temperature, the molar
heat capacity of many dielectrics is close to 3R (Dulong–Petit law). But as the temperature
decreases, in all cases, one observes a signiﬁcant decrease in the heat capacity, and at low
temperatures, it tends to zero as T 3. Such a behavior of the lattice heat capacity is explained
by quantum theory.
◮Einstein theory. Einstein modeled vibrations of atoms at the nodes of the crystal lattice
using 3N mutually independent equal quantum harmonic oscillators. The average energy
of each such oscillator is equal to (see Subsection P5.4.1)
〈ε〉= ℏω
2 +
ℏω
eℏω/kT – 1 .
(P7.1.3.1)
For kT ≫ℏω, the molar heat capacity of a system of quantum oscillators is equal to 3R,
and as T →0 it exponentially tends to zero. The Einstein theory explained that the heat
capacity decreases with decreasing temperature, but not by the law T 3.
◮Elastic waves. The difﬁculties in the Einstein theory originate from the fact that the
elastic vibrations of noninteracting oscillators of the same frequency were considered as
elementary excitations (of normal oscillatory modes). In fact, due to interaction between
neighboring atoms, elastic waves of different frequencies and wavelength propagate in
crystal. The elementary excitations are waves with deﬁnite values of frequency ω and the
wave vector k. The average energy per unit wave with frequency ω is given by the formula
(P7.1.3.1). To calculate the number of distinct waves in the interval dω, it is necessary to
solve the following two problems:
1) To ﬁnd the number of independent oscillations per unit volume element d3k in the
space of wave vectors. This problem can be solved starting from the boundary conditions.
The total number of independent oscillations must be equal to the number of degrees of
freedom 3N. For traveling waves, we use periodic boundary conditions: ξ(Lx) = ξ(0),
with similar relations for y and z. This leads to
kxLx = 2πm,

∆kx = 2π

Finally, for the density of states in the k-space, we have
dg = γ

∆kx∆ky∆kz

2π2 V .
(P7.1.3.2)
So we get the same formula as for standing waves (see Subsection P5.4.1). The multiplier γ
is equal to three in the case of sound waves; it takes account of the two longitudinal waves
and one transverse wave.
2) To ﬁnd the law of dispersion, that is, the dependence ω(k). To solve this problem,
it is necessary to write the equation of motion of separate atoms taking account of their
interaction with neighboring atoms. The theoretical calculations are possible only for rather
simple models, but in the general case, it is possible to ﬁnd several important features.
For the wavelength larger than the interatomic distances (ka ≪1), good results are
given by the continuum approximation in which the medium is assumed to be continuous.
In this case, the equations of motion of particles are reduced to the wave equation and the
law of dispersion of sound waves has the form:
ω = vk,
(P7.1.3.3)
where v is the velocity of the sound wave propagation (for simplicity, we neglect the differ-
ence between the longitudinal and transverse waves). The main contribution to the energy is
given by the waves with ℏω ∼kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant (the probability of
formation a wave with ℏω ≫kBT is exponentially small); hence the contribution of sound
waves (for which ka ≪1 or ω ≪v/a) is the main contribution under the condition that
kBT ≪ℏv/a, that is, at sufﬁciently low temperatures. Conversely, at high temperatures,
the contribution to the energy from each of the elementary waves is equal to kBT, and the
energy is determined only by the common number of degrees of freedom.
◮Debye theory. To obtain the correct value of the heat capacity at both high and low
temperatures in the framework of a simple model, Debye assumed that the density of states
(P7.1.3.2) and the dispersion law (P7.1.3.3) hold for all k up to some maximum value kD
and a corresponding frequency ωD above which the density of states is zero. The Debye
frequency ωD is chosen so that the total number of state is equal to 3N, which ensures that
the Dulong–Petit law holds at high temperatures.
The density of the number of states in the Debye model is expressed as
G(ω) dω =

becomes equal to π4/15. We see that the energy of the lattice vibrations is proportional

◮One-dimensional chain. Dispersion law. To understand what consequences the dis-
creteness in the mass distribution may lead to, we consider an inﬁnitely long chain of
atoms. We assume that the atomic mass is m, the distance between the neighboring atoms
in equilibrium is a, and an elastic force with rigidity κ acts between the neighboring atoms.

◮The ﬁrst Brillouin zone. We ﬁnd what values of k correspond to physically distinct
states. If we consider the values of the wave vector that differ by 2πn/a: k′ = k + 2πn/a,
then we obtain not only equal values of ω but also the identical functions: ξs(k′) = ξs(k) ⋅
exp(2πins) = ξs(k). Hence all the physically distinct states are described by wave vectors
lying in the interval (–π/a < k ≤π/a). This interval is called the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
Onthe zone boundary, the travelingwave becomes a standing wave: A exp[i( π
a as–ωt)]=
A exp(–iωt)(–1)s. The neighboring atoms oscillate in antiphase, the wave nodes lie between
the atoms. We note that on the zone boundary, the wave group velocity is zero:

◮The density of states in the Brillouin zone. The ﬁrst Brillouin zone contains exactly N
distinct values of k (see example 2 above; N is the number of atoms in the chain), which
means that all degrees of freedom are exhausted within the framework of the ﬁrst Brillouin
zone (we consider only the longitudinal traveling waves). In the one-dimensional Debye
model, the density of states G(ω) is constant. However, from the dispersion law (P7.1.3.7)

QUANTUM THEORY OF CRYSTALS
◮Diatomic chain. Optical branches. If an elementary chain contains several distinct
atoms, then in addition to sound branches, for which ω ∼k as k →0, there arise optical
branches, on which ω remains ﬁnite for all k in the Brillouin zone.
For example, for
longitudinal oscillations in a chain of alternating atoms with masses m1 and m2, there are
two branches shown in Fig. P7.3. For small k (near the zone center), the sound branch
corresponds to deviations of distinct atoms in the same direction, and the optical branch
corresponds to deviations in opposite directions. In the general case, where the cell contains
p distinct atoms, there are three sound branches and 3p – 3 optical branches.
Figure P7.3. Sound and optical branches for a chain of distinct atoms.
◮Phonons. Just as in the case where oscillations of an electromagnetic ﬁeld and elec-
tromagnetic waves are associated with quantum particles, photons, the lattice elementary
vibrations in the form of traveling waves are associated with particles whose momentum
and energy are related to the wave vector and frequency by the relations p = ℏk and ε = ℏω.
These particles are called phonons. Since the phonon energy is a periodic function of their
momentum, which is not typical of usual particles, they are called quasiparticles, and their
momentum is called the quasi-momentum. The phonons obey the Bose–Einstein statistics
with µ = 0, because the number of phonons in a system is not ﬁxed. The phonons can
scatter at impurities and crystal defects and interact with other particles, for example, with
electrons and photons. A phonon can also split into two phonons (because of nonlinear
effects, which must be taken into account only for sufﬁciently energetic phonons).
In all these processes, the energy and momentum conservation laws are fulﬁlled. A
nontrivial characteristic of phonons is that, in the ﬁnal state, the momentum conservation
law cancontaina phononthat isnot inthe ﬁrst Brillouin zone. If we pass tothe corresponding
phonon from the ﬁrst zone, then an additional momentum ℏG, which describes the shift
of this Brillouin zone with respect to the ﬁrst, appears in the momentum conservation law.
This momentum corresponds to the motion of the crystal as a whole (which cannot be
discovered experimentally, because the mass of the crystal is very large). For example, in
the one-dimensional case, G = 2πn/a, which corresponds to the case of equal displacement
of all nodes of the lattice.
The processes of phonons scattering determine their mean free path in terms of which
the phonon thermal conduction is expressed:

P7.2. Electrons in a Periodic Field. Energy Bands
Within the framework of the Sommerfeld theory, where electrons in metal are considered as
a free fermion gas, it is possible to explain several facts, mainly, the behavior of the electron

heat capacity. But many phenomena cannot be explained in this theory. First, this is the
problem of origination of metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics and the description of
their properties. To clarify these problems, it is necessary to take account of the interaction
of electrons with the crystal lattice, which forms a periodic external ﬁeld for the electrons.
The interaction of electrons with the lattice periodic ﬁeld results in the appearance in their
spectrum of allowed energy bands separated by forbidden energy bands; that is, by the
energy intervals that do not contain electron levels. The existence of crystals of different
types corresponds to the different character of ﬁlling the energy bands by electrons.
P7.2.1. Qualitative Theory of Energy Bands
◮Origination of bands from atomic levels. Let us track the behavior of electron energy
levels in the case of gradual formation of a crystal from isolated atoms. First, we assume
that N atoms are at a distance from one another such that the wave functions of electrons do
not overlap. In this case, we can assume that each nondegenerate level of a separate atom
in the system of N atoms is N-fold degenerate, but if an atomic level is p-fold degenerate,
then its degree of degeneration in a system of N atoms is equal to pN. We begin to bring
the atoms together to the distance corresponding to the crystal in equilibrium. As a result
of interaction between the overlapping electron clouds related to separate atoms, one level
yields N very closely located levels contained in a band of width ∆E (Fig. P7.4). The band
width is determined by the energy of interaction between the corresponding electrons of
neighboring atoms, and it is independent of the number of atoms. For the outer shells, the
interaction is strong (the wave functions overlap signiﬁcantly) and the band width is large,
for inner shells, the band width is small. The number of levels in each band is large, so
that the spectrum can be assumed to be continuous. Such energy bands are called allowed
bands, and the energy intervals between the bands, where there are no electron levels, are
called forbidden bands.

◮Classiﬁcation of crystals.
The type of the crystal conductivity is deﬁned by the
character of ﬁlling by electrons (at T = 0) of the upper allowed band (above which all the
allowed bands are empty). The bands below the upper allowed band are completely ﬁlled
with electrons. The electrons in these bands at T = 0 cannot participate in conductivity,
because there are no vacancies where they could move as the external ﬁeld is switched on.
The upper band originating from the atomic outer shell can be ﬁlled with electrons either
partially or completely.
Metals. If this band is ﬁlled partially, then the crystal is a metal (or a semimetal if the
number of electrons in this band is very small). This band is called the conductivity band.
The Fermi energy of a metal lies in the interior of the conductivity band, the electrons

located in this band form a set of free carriers participating in conductivity at any arbitrarily
low temperature. The properties of these electrons have much in common with the electron
gas in the Sommerfeld model (if the energy is counted from the lower boundary of the
band), but there are important distinctions, which we discuss below.
The outer s-shell of atoms of alkali metals contain two electron states (corresponding to
different projections of spin), and only one of them is occupied by the electron. Therefore,
the conductivity band contains 2N free places, and only half of them is ﬁlled (see Fig. P7.4
for lithium). For rare-earth metals, both s-states of the outer shell are occupied by electrons,
but there is another mechanism of ﬁlling the empty band: the energy band originating from
the s-shell and containing 2N places is overlapped with the band originating from the
p-shell containing 6N places. The allowed band thus formed contains 8N place only the
2N of which are ﬁlled with electrons (see Fig. P7.5 for beryllium).

Dielectrics and semiconductors. If the upper band at T = 0 is completely ﬁlled with
electrons, then at T = 0, the crystal is a dielectric. For T > 0, the conductivity of such
a crystal is determined by the width ∆E of the forbidden band lying between the ﬁlled
band (it is called the valence band) and the nearest free band (which in this case is called
the conductivity band). Because of the thermal motion, the electrons can move from the
valence band into the conductivity band. For kBT ≪∆E, the electron concentration in the
conductivity band is exponentially small (∼exp(–∆E/kBT)). For kBT ∼∆E, the elec-
tron concentration in the conductivity band becomes noticeable and rapidly increases with
temperature (the conductivity becomes noticeable already for kBT ∼0.1∆E). In this tem-
perature region, the crystal behaves as a pure semiconductor. Usually, the semiconductors
are crystals whose conductivity becomes noticeable at room temperature.
In a pure semiconductor, simultaneously with the appearance of negative charge car-
rier—electrons—in the conductivity band, the same number of positive charge carriers—
vacant places—arise in the valence band; these positive charge carriers are called holes.
The conductivity of pure semiconductors related to the appearance of the equal quantities
of electrons and holes is said to be intrinsic.
Extrinsic semiconductors. Addition of an impurity results in violation of the symmetry
between positive and negative charges. If an impurity whose atom valency is greater than
the crystal atom valency is added, there arise excessive electrons that are weakly related to
the impurity atoms and become free at the temperatures at which the transitions between
the bands are still absent.
To these excessive electrons there correspond donor energy
levels located in the forbidden band near the lower boundary of the conductivity band.
The electrons from these levels move into the conductivity band, and since there is still
no vacancy in the valence band, the conductivity in this temperature region is realized
mainly by electrons. Such extrinsic semiconductors are called semiconductors of n-type.

P7.2. ELECTRONS IN A PERIODIC FIELD. ENERGY BANDS
611
In semiconductors of p-type, the valency of impurity is less that the valency of crystal
atoms, which results in the appearance of vacant places to which the electrons begin to
move at sufﬁciently low temperatures. To these vacancies there correspond empty energy
levels (acceptor levels) located near the upper boundary of the valence band. The transition
to these levels of electrons from the valence band leads to the formation of holes without
appearance of electrons in the conductivity band.
P7.2.2. Quantum Mechanical Description of Energy Regions
Although it is appropriate to use quantum numbers of individual atoms to label energy bands,
the state of an electron within an allowed band is described using a completely different
quantum number associated with the so-called the quasi-momentum of the electron. The
quasi-momentum varies quasi-continuously and reﬂects the translational properties of the
Schr¨odinger equation and the wave function.
◮Bloch waves. Quasi-momentum of electron. The wave function of a stationary state
of an electron in an inﬁnite periodic potential can be written as
ψ(r) = eik⋅rϕ(r),
(P7.2.2.1)
where ϕ(r) is a periodic function of coordinates (with the same periodic properties as the
potential energy of an electron). This statement is called the Bloch theorem, and the vector
ℏk is called the quasi-momentum of an electron. The vectors k and p for an electron in a
crystal are in a sense similar to the wave vector and momentum of the free electron in the
Sommerfeld model. Let us clarify the Bloch theorem and the meaning of these notions in
the one-dimensional case.
Let the period of one-dimensional lattice be equal to a, and let the potential energy of
electron have the same periodicity: U(x + a) = U(x). It is easy to see that if ψ(x) is a
solution of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, then ψ(x + a) is also a solution of
this equation. Hence ψ(x+na) = T(na)ψ(x), and the discrete function T(x) (determined for
x = na) has the following properties: |T(na)| = 1, T(na) = [T(a)]n. We obtain T(x) = eikx,
and the function ϕ(x) = e–ikxψ(x) is a periodic function of x: ϕ(x + a) = ϕ(x).
For each given value k, from the Schr¨odinger equation for ψ(x) we obtain a second-
order ordinary differential equation for ϕ(x) with the boundary condition ϕ(a) = ϕ(0). This
equation has solution only for discrete values En(k). If we pass from k to k′ = k + 2π/a,
then we obtain the same equation for ϕ(x) and the same values of the energy Ek′ as for the
number k. We conclude that the energy is a periodic function of k with period G = 2π/a
and the wave functions for the values of k that differ by G are identical. Hence we can
reduce all the electron states to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. At the well boundaries, there are
extrema (minima and maxima) of E(k), which ensure the continuity and smoothness of this
function in transitions from one Brillouin zone to another (Fig. P7.6). At the center of the
zone (for k = 0), E(k) usually also has an extremum.
The above-discussed separation of crystals into metals and dielectrics (at T = 0) can be
well explained by the dependence E(k) in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Fig. P7.6). Figure P7.6a
corresponds to a dielectric, Fig. P7.6b to a metal (or semimetal) in the case of overlapping
bands, and Fig. P7.6c to a metal in the case of partially ﬁlled band.
◮The number of states in the Brillouin zone. As k varies in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, the
energy of the nth level En(k) varies within the nth allowed energy band. If we take into
account that the crystal is ﬁnite (by using, for example, periodic boundary conditions), then
in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, k takes N values: 0, ±2π/L, ±4π/L, . . . , π/a, where L = Na.
Hence the nth band contains N levels En(ki). With the spin taken into account, we obtain
2N electron states.

P7.2.3. Dynamics of Electron in Crystal
◮Equation of motion of an electron in crystal. The energy spectrum of electrons in
the upper bands (the valence band and the conductivity band) bears information about
interaction of electrons with the crystal lattice. If this spectrum is used to calculate the
group velocity of an electron
vg = dω
dk = 1
ℏ

(P7.2.3.1)
then we can write the equations of motion in the form taking account of the action on
electrons of only external forces. This equation has the form of usual Newton law
dp
dt = F,
(P7.2.3.2)
where F is an external force (that does not take account of the interaction with the lattice)
and p is the quasi-momentum of electron.
For clarity, we present the expression for the rate of variation in the electron energy
dε
dt = dε

which must be equal to the power of the external force Fvg.
As an example of the use of equations of motion (P7.2.3.1) and (P7.2.3.2), we consider
the behavior of an electron in the empty energy band (where no other electrons are contained)
under the action of a constant force. We assume that this electron does not collide with other
electrons, phonons, and lattice defects and that, at the initial time, the electron is at rest. In
the Sommerfeld model, the free electron would move with constant acceleration away from
the point of the beginning of motion. In the band theory, the electron is ﬁrst at the center of
the band (for p = 0), then its momentum linearly increases, but the velocity varies differently
in this case. It ﬁrst increases, then decreases approaching the Brillouin zone boundary, and
is zero at zone boundary. At this instant, the electron is “transferred” to the left boundary of
the zone (if we want to stay in the framework of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone), and the electron
velocity changes the sign. At the time when the electron momentum is again at the center
of the zone, its velocity again is zero, and the electron is transferred to the previous place.
The electron motion has an oscillatory character. To avoid misunderstanding, we note that
the electrons in metal cannot move in such a cycle, because they do not have time between
the collisions to go far enough from the Fermi surface and approach the zone boundary.

(P7.2.3.3)
and the quantity m∗thus deﬁned is called the effective mass of electron. For the electron
velocity we obtain the usual relation
vg =

m∗.
We note that the electron effective mass deﬁned by equation (P7.2.3.3) is positive near the
energy band bottom and is negative near the band upper boundary. As we saw, near the
band upper boundary, under the action of an external force, the electron velocity does not
increase but decreases.

point, we can write

or

(P7.2.3.4)
The effective mass is an important dynamical characteristic of an electron in a crystal.
The effective mass of an electron can either be greater than or less than its true mass
(sometimes, by several dozens of times). The effective mass stands in the place of the usual
mass in the expression for the electrical conduction: σ = e2nτ/m∗, and in many other
physical formulas. The effective mass is especially convenient to describe the properties
of semiconductors, where the electron concentration in the conductivity band (and of holes
in the valence band) is not large. In anisotropic crystals, the effective mass depends on the
direction of motion of the electron.
Although an individual electron near the upper boundary of the band must be assigned
a negative effective mass, the absence of such an electron in the completely ﬁlled valence
band is equivalent to the presence of a single particle with positive mass and positive charge.
As was already noted, such charge carriers are called holes.
◮Fermi surface for electrons in metals.
In the band theory, the Fermi surface of
electrons is not a simple sphere of radius pF, as it is the case for a free electron. Metals
can have quite intricate Fermi surfaces. The determination of electronic Fermi surfaces is
one of the most important problems in metal physics. Recall that at room temperatures, the
electrons in metals are in a strongly degenerate state (kBT ≪εF), and a special role is played
by electrons near the Fermi surface. Fermi surfaces are usually depicted within the ﬁrst

Brillouin zone; however, it is more graphic to display a periodic connected surface covering
several Brillouin zones. Figure P7.7 depicts the Fermi surface and the boundaries of the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone for copper; the Fermi surfaces for silver, gold, and other metals of this group
look quite similar. In Fig. P7.7, one can clearly see the transitions into neighboring Brillouin
zones. (The three-dimensional presentations of the Fermi surfaces for most elements of the
periodic table can be found at the Website http://www.phys.ufl.edu/fermisurface.)
Figure P7.7. Fermi surface and boundaries of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone for copper.
P7.2.4. Band Theory of Semiconductors
The difference between dielectrics and intrinsic semiconductors is determined by the width
of theforbiddenband ∆between the ﬁlled (at T =0) valence bandandthe emptyconductivity
band. To semiconductors one usually refers the crystals for which ∆< 3 eV; for example,
for germanium, ∆= 0.67 eV, and for silicon, ∆= 1.11 eV. The current carrier concentration
is many orders of magnitude less for semiconductors than for metals and it varies quite
strongly if impurities, even in negligible concentrations, are added.
◮Fermi energy and conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor. The position of the
Fermi energy in intrinsic semiconductors is determined by the condition that the electron
concentration in the conductivity band and the hole concentration in the valence band
coincide. For kBT ≪∆, the Fermi energy is very close to the center of the forbidden band.
(A deviation from the center of the band appears because the effective mass of electrons
near the conductivity band bottom differs from the effective mass of holes near the top
of the valence band). The concentration of charge carriers is calculated from the Fermi
distribution, the dependence of the concentration on the temperature is mainly determined
by the multiplier exp(–∆/2kBT), where ∆/2 is the distance from the Fermi level to the
band boundary.
The electron concentration in the conductivity band is calculated by the formula

where ε0 is energy of the conductivity band bottom, ε′ = ε – ε0 is the energy counted from
the band bottom (it is taken into account that kBT ≪ε0 – εF).
The intrinsic conductivity of semiconductors depends on the temperature similarly:
σ = σ0e–∆/2kBT .

P7.2. ELECTRONS IN A PERIODIC FIELD. ENERGY BANDS
615
◮Extrinsic semiconductors. In the case of extrinsic semiconductors, the Fermi energy
is displaced to the boundary of the band, where the main charge carriers are located. In
the case of semiconductors of n-type with donor conductivity, the Fermi level is located
near the conductivity band bottom, in the case of semiconductors of p-type with acceptor
conductivity, near the upper boundary of the valence band (Fig. P7.8). At lower tempera-
tures, the number of impurity carriers in the band strongly depends on the temperature, and
the conductivity rapidly increases with increasing temperature. Then the impurity levels
become “impoverished”; that is, no electrons remain at donor levels (or no free places at
acceptor levels), and the conductivity slowly decreases. (Just as in the case of metals, the
mean free path decreases because the number of phonons in the system increases.) At
higher temperatures, the number of charge carriers begins to increase again, because the
mechanism of intrinsic conductivity begins to act. The Fermi energy in this case approaches
the center of the forbidden band.

◮Contact phenomena. p-n transition. If a semiconductor of n-type comes in contact
with a semiconductor of p-type, then a p-n transition arises. As a result of diffusion of the
majority carriers in the neighboring semiconductor in the transition region, there arises a
contact difference of potentials, and the potential of the semiconductor of n-type turns out
to be higher. The contact difference of potentials prevents the charge carriers from motion.
The potential difference between the semiconductors may attain such a value (Fig. P7.9)
that the Fermi energy of the semiconductors becomes equal (the condition that the chemical
potentials be equal). In equilibrium, the diffusion current of the majority carrier through
the potential barrier is equal to the drift current of minority carriers, to which the contact
difference of potentials is no obstacle.

If the external ﬁeld is applied in the forward direction (the positive pole) to the semicon-

the barrier decreases by eU (U is the applied voltage). If the ﬁeld is applied in the backward
direction, then the forward carrier current decreases (the barrier increases). The applied

Elements of Nuclear Physics
The idea that practically the entire mass of an atom is concentrated in its positively charged
nucleus of inﬁnitesimally small dimensions is due to Rutherford’s experiments (see Chap-
ter P6). Since the dimensions of nuclei turned out to be by ﬁve orders less than those of
atoms, it can be assumed, in the framework of atomic physics, that the nucleus is a point
Coulomb center. Actually, the nucleus is a complex structure formed by strongly interacting
particles (several ones or hundreds) obeying the laws of quantum mechanics and quantum
statistics. The nuclei can undergo radioactive transformations, participate in nuclear reac-
tions, disintegrate, and merge with other nuclei. The characteristic energies in that nuclear
world are measured in millions of electron-volts, which explains why nuclei appear as stable
objects in atomic processes with energies up to several hundred electron-volts.
P8.1. Basic Properties of Nuclei
P8.1.1. Characteristics of Nuclei
◮Nuclear Composition. The atomic nucleus consists of protons and neutrons—particles
collectively named nucleons.
The proton is a subatomic particle with positive charge e and mass mp = 1836.15 me,
where me is the electron mass. The neutron is an electrically neutral particle whose mass
is slightly greater than that of the proton: mn = 1838.68 me. In its free state, the neutron
is unstable in the sense that within 15.5 minutes, on the average, it turns into a proton
after emitting an electron and an antineutrino: n →p + e + eν. The spin* of both the
proton and neutron is equal to 1/2, which means that they belong to the class of fermions.
Both the proton and the neutron possess nonzero magnetic moments: µp = 2.793 µN and
µn = –1.91 µN, where µN = eℏ/2mp is the so-called nuclear magneton (µN = µB/1836.15).
The nonzero magnetic moment of the neutron suggests that nucleons must have an internal
structure involving more elementary charged particles.
The nuclear composition is described by two integers: the atomic number Z, equal
to the number of protons in the nucleus (and so identical to the charge number of the
nucleus), and the mass number A, equal to the total number of nucleons in the nucleus. The
number of neutrons (the neutron number) is N = A – Z. The charge number of an element
coincides with its ordinal number in Mendeleev’s table (see Chapter S7) and determines
its physical-chemical properties, since these depend on the charge of the nucleus and are
almost independent of its mass. The charge and the mass numbers of an element X are
speciﬁed as indices to the left of its symbol: A
ZX; for example, 3
2He, 13
6C. Since the element
symbol uniquely determines its number in the periodic table, which coincides with the
charge number Z, the left lower index is sometimes dropped (3He, 13C).
Particular atoms with A nucleons in their nucleus and Z protons, together with their
electronic shell containing Z electrons, are called nuclides. All nuclides with the same Z
* Here and henceforth, we often use the word “spin” for short to mean the “spin quantum number.”

ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
are called isotopes of a given element. The isotopes of hydrogen 1H, 2H, and 3H, whose
nuclei are essentially distinct, are respectively called the common hydrogen (sometimes
the term protium is used), deuterium (D), and tritium (T), and the nuclei of deuterium and
tritium are called deuteron (d) and triton (t).
There are stable and radioactive isotopes. Radioactive isotopes are characterized by their
type of radioactivity (α-decay or β-decay) and their lifetime. (In more detail, radioactive
transformations are considered below.)
There are many radioactive isotopes occurring
in nature, provided that their lifetime is very long (235U, 232Th, and others) or they are
constantly produced as a result of decay of such long-lived nuclei (for example, 223Fr).
There are no stable isotopes for Z = 43 (technetium), Z = 61 (promethium) and for all
elements with Z > 83 (starting from polonium). The other elements possess from 1 to 9
(tin Sn) stable isotopes, and on the average, the number of these is equal to 3. Different
stable (or long-lived) isotopes have different occurrence, the observed atomic weight is an
average over several isotopes. For instance, the atomic weight of natural chlorine is equal
to 35.5, and it contains 76% of 35Cl and 24% of 37Cl.
Nuclides with the same mass number A are called isobars (for instance, 40
18Ar is 40
20Ca).
In the presence of β-decay, isobars can transform into one another. Note that for a stable
nuclide, its closest isobars are β-active.
Among stable and long-lived nuclei, the most frequent are even-even ones (even number
of protons and even number of neutrons) and the rarest are odd-odd ones (only four stable
ones: 2
1H, 6
3Li, 10
5B and 14
7N).

Figure P8.1. Number of neutrons in a nucleus versus its consecutive number.
Figure P8.1 shows the dependence of N on Z for stable nuclides. It can be seen that
for the ﬁrst 15 to 20 elements, the number of protons is approximately the same as that of
neutrons (Z ∼A/2). With the increase of the consecutive number, there is a clear tendency
to the number of neutrons being greater than that of protons (thus, the only stable isotope
of bismuth is 209
83Bi).

P8.1. BASIC PROPERTIES OF NUCLEI
619
◮Nuclear spin and magnetic moments. Nuclear spin I is deﬁned as the total angular
momentum of the nucleus, which is the composition of spins and orbital angular momenta
of separate nucleons. Nuclei with evenly many nucleons have integer spin, while the spin
of nuclei with an odd number of nucleons is half-integer. For nuclei with an even number
of both protons and neutrons, the spin of the ground state is equal to zero. This means that
angular momenta of separate nucleons compensate one another. It should be mentioned,
however, that I = 1 for the ground state of deuteron.
As a rule, nuclei with nonzero spin have also a nonzero magnetic moment. Nuclear
magnetic moments are usually very small (of the order of nuclear magneton), but their
interaction with orbital motion of electrons gives rise to a hyperﬁne structure of electronic
levels, which can be observed.
◮Nuclear dimensions and shape. Nucleon distribution over the nuclear volume has
been established in many experiments with scattering of fast electrons and nucleons. (The
de Broglie wavelength of scattered particles should be small compared with nuclear di-
mensions.) In electronic scattering experiments aimed at testing only the electromagnetic
interaction one ﬁnds spatial distribution of the nuclear charge (i.e., proton distribution), and
in neutron scattering experiments one ﬁnds spatial distribution of all nucleons. It turns out
that these distributions differ but slightly, and in what follows we speak only of the nucleon
distribution.
As it happens, the shape of most nuclei is nearly spherical. For nuclei with a fairly
large number of nucleons (A > 12), one can identify an interior region in which nucleon
concentration is constant, and there is a small transition layer over which the concentration
drops to zero. If the nuclear radius is deﬁned as the distance from the center where the
concentration drops by a factor of two, one arrives at the following dependence on the mass
number:
R ∼R0A1/3 fm,
(P8.1.1.1)
where R0 = 1.2–1.4 fm and fm (fermi) is a non-SI unit of distance (1 fm = 10–15 m =
1 femtometre), common in nuclear physics.
It can be seen that nucleon concentration
within the nucleus is nearly the same for all nuclei.
Example. Estimate the average nucleon concentration in the nucleus and the average nuclear substance
density.
Solution. The average nucleon concentration is equal to n = A/( 4
3 πR3) ∼1.0–1.5 × 1044 m–3. This
concentration corresponds to the density ρ = Mn ∼2 × 1017 kg/m3, where M is the nucleon mass.
Note that for many nuclei, one observes a considerable deviation of particle distribution
from spherical symmetry (this deviation is especially pronounced in excited states, but
also happens in the ground state). Thus, for the simplest compound nucleus, the deuteron,
charge distribution in the ground state is nonspherical. (This fact is indicative of a noncentral
character of nuclear forces.)
◮Nuclear binding energy. Nuclear masses measured with a fair degree of accuracy
happen to be smaller than the sum of the nucleon masses involved.
The nonadditive
character of mass in this situation is a direct consequence of the Einstein formula relating
mass and energy at rest (see Subsection P1.10.3). Between nucleons, there exist attraction
forces by which they are kept within the nucleus in spite of the strong (due to the small
distances) Coulomb repulsion, and positive work is required in order to split the nucleus
into nucleons. The amount of that work is called nuclear binding energy:
Eb = (Zmp + Nmn – mnuc)c2,
(P8.1.1.2)
where N = A – Z is the number of neutrons in the nucleus.
The huge magnitude of
nuclear interactions (compared with, say, atomic or chemical interactions that have a purely
electromagnetic nature) made it possible to measure directly the said mass decrease.

ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
Let us make a few remarks with regard to formula (P8.1.1.2).
1. In nuclear physics, nuclear mass and particle mass are expressed either in energy
units or in atomic mass units. In the ﬁrst case, one gives the value of the rest energy mc2
expressed in electronvolts. Thus, the masses of electron, proton, and neutron in these units
are respectively equal to me = 0.511 MeV, mp = 938.28 MeV, mn = 939.55 MeV. When
energy units are used, many formulas become shorter. Thus, formula (P8.1.1.2) becomes
Eb = Zmp + Nmn – mnuc.
(P8.1.1.3)
Note that 1 kg = 5.61 × 1029 MeV, 1 MeV = 1.78 × 10–30 kg.
By deﬁnition, the atomic mass unit (AMU) is 1/12 of the mass of carbon nuclide
(not nucleus) 12C. Reference tables usually give nuclide passes in AMUs. For example,
me = 5.486 × 10–4 AMU, mp = 1.007276 AMU, mn = 1.00898 AMU. Note that 1 AMU =
931.50 MeV = 1.660 × 10–27 kg.
2. Since reference tables usually list masses of nuclides rather than nuclear masses, it
is convenient to rewrite formula (P8.1.1.3) as follows:
Eb = ZMH + Nmn – Ma,
(P8.1.1.4)
where MH is the mass of the hydrogen atom and Ma is the mass of the atom (nuclide)
corresponding to the said nucleus.
The ﬁrst term of this formula differs from that of
(P8.1.1.3) by Zme; and the nuclide mass Ma differs from the nuclear mass mn by the same
amount, if one neglects the energy of electric interaction between electrons and the nucleus.
3. Instead of nuclide mass, tables often list the so-called mass defect ∆a = Ma – A
(where Ma is expressed in AMUs). Thus, the mass defect of the nuclide 12C is equal to
zero, the mass defect of the hydrogen atom is equal to 0.007825 AMU, the mass defect of
the nuclide 3He is equal to 0.016030 AMU. Binding energy can be expressed in terms of
mass defects as follows:
Eb = Z∆H + N∆n – ∆a.
(P8.1.1.5)
◮Dependence of binding energy on nuclear composition. It turns out that in the ﬁrst
roughapproximation, bindingenergy grows in direct proportion to the number of nucleons in
the nucleus, i.e., its mass number A. For qualitative and numerical analysis, it is convenient
to use speciﬁc binding energy deﬁned as ε = Eb/A. Figure P8.2 shows an approximate
dependence of ε on the mass number A. Being approximately equal to 8 MeV/nucleon,
speciﬁc energy ﬁrst (for A<16) undergoes a sharp increase, then continues to grow smoothly
and for A ∼60 (in the region of iron) attains its maximum, 8.8 MeV/nucleon, after which
it smoothly decreases to 7.6 MeV/nucleon for the last natural nuclide 238U. Note that due
to the growth of ε for small A, fusion of light nuclei is energetically efﬁcient, and due to
the decrease of ε for large A, ﬁssion of heavy nuclei is energetically efﬁcient. The energy
released by ﬁssion of heavy nuclei is called atomic, and that released by fusion of light
nuclei is called thermonuclear. Thermonuclear energy per nucleon is several times greater
than atomic energy.
Nuclear forces and nuclear models are considered in the next section, but here we make
a few brief remarks.
1. The fact that speciﬁc binding energy, for most nuclei, is approximately constant and
equal to its average value indicates that nuclear forces have a short-range character and have
the property of saturation (each nucleon interacts only with its several closest neighbors).
2. The decrease of ε for small A is explained by an increase of surface effects that
depend on the relative fraction of surface particles.
3. The decrease of speciﬁc binding energy for large A is explained by an increased
relative contribution of Coulomb energy.

Figure P8.2. Speciﬁc binding energy versus mass number.
4. For light elements, the maximum binding energy for nuclides with ﬁxed A (isobars)
corresponds to Z ∼A/2. (For this reason, such nuclides are usually called β-stable.)
This phenomenon is referred to as the symmetry effect. The shift to a larger percentage
of neutrons observed with the growth of A is explained by an increased role of Coulomb
repulsion of protons.
5. Speciﬁc binding energy of even-even nuclei is, on the average, greater than that
of even-odd nuclei, and speciﬁc binding energy of even-odd nuclei is greater than that of
odd-odd nuclei. This is explained by pairing of identical nucleons in nuclei. The union of
two identical nucleons that form a zero-spin pair results in a gain approximately equal to
1 MeV.
6. Most stable (i.e., having the largest ε) among all even-even nuclei are the so-called
magic nuclei whose number of protons or that of neutrons are equal to one of the magic
numbers: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126. Especially stable are double-magic nuclei; i.e., those
with the magic number of both protons and neutrons (e.g., 4He, 16O, 40Ca, 208Pb, etc.). The
existence of magic nuclei indicates that nuclei have a shell structure similar to that of atoms.
P8.1.2. Nuclear Forces
◮Properties of nuclear forces. Between the nucleons in a nucleus there exist nuclear
attraction forces which are hundreds of times greater than electromagnetic repulsion forces
between protons. These attraction forces ensure nuclear stability. Let us mention some
(most important) features of nuclear forces.
1. Nuclear forces have a short-range character with the effective range r0 ∼2.0–2.5 fm.
As the distance between nucleons becomes greater than the effective range, nuclear interac-
tion rapidly decays. If that distance becomes several times smaller than the effective range,
attraction is replaced by strong repulsion.
Example. Knowing the deuteron mass, one can calculate binding energy of the simplest nucleus, deuteron.
This energy is equal to 2.22 MeV. On the basis of this binding energy, estimate the potential well depth
corresponding to nuclear interaction between two nucleons.
Solution. First of all, let us replace the system of two interacting particles of mass M by a single particle
with reduced mass m = M/2. For simplicity, we assume that potential energy is represented by a well of radius
R = 2.3 fm and depth U0. The quantity U0 can be found from the condition that the ground-state energy in this
potential well should be equal to E1 = –2.2 MeV. For the spherically symmetric wave function of the ground
state, the Schr¨odinger equation has the form

+ 2m
ℏ2 (E – U)ψ = 0,

622
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
where U = –U0 for r < R and U = 0 for r > R. Setting Ψ(r) = rψ(r), we come to the equation
d2Ψ
dr2 + M
ℏ2 (E – U)Ψ = 0,
whose solution was obtained in Subsection P6.2.2. Omitting further calculations, we just state the answer: to
get the correct ground-state energy, one should have the depth of the potential well about 29 MeV. (For a well
of radius 2 fm, the value obtained for the depth is about 35 MeV.)
Note that this attraction value corresponds only to the state of a two-nucleon system in
which their total spin is equal to 1. In the state with zero spin, attraction is nearly twice
weaker and there is no bound state. This is why there is no stable formation consisting
either of two neutrons or two protons (according to Pauli’s principle, two identical particles
cannot have parallel spins).
There is no ﬁnal answer with regard to the dependence of nuclear forces on the distance
between nucleons.
With equal success, different models of that dependence are used
for processing experimental data. The best theoretical justiﬁcation has been given to the
Yukawa formula
U(r) = A e–r/r0
r
.
(P8.1.2.1)
2. The short-range nature of nuclear forces is closely connected with their saturation
property. Every nucleon inside the nuclear substance is interacting with a certain number
of its closest neighbors. (The nucleons near the surface of a nucleus have a smaller number
of neighbors.) For this reason, nuclear binding energy grows in proportion to the number
of nucleons, while the average nuclear density remains constant. If nuclear forces were
long-range (as, for instance, the Coulomb force), then every nucleon would interact with
all the others and the binding energy would grow faster. For example, electric energy of a
ball with charge Ze and radius R is proportional to Z2/R (see Subsection P3.6.1).
3. Nuclear forces have the property of charge independence: they do not depend on the
type of interacting nucleons (p-p, p-n, or n-n).
4. Nuclear forces are non-central. This is conﬁrmed, in particular, by the non-spherical
charge distribution in the deuteron ground state. If the interaction was exactly central, the
orbital angular momentum would be conserved and would be strictly equal to zero in the
ground state, which corresponds to a spherically symmetric wave function.
5. Nuclear forces depend on spin orientations.
(See above with regard to nucleon
interaction in the deuteron.)
◮Nature of nuclear forces. In modern physics, any fundamental interaction is regarded
as a result of particle exchange (particles are agents of interaction). Nuclear interaction
between nucleons is implemented through the exchange of π-mesons (pions), which are
particles with zero spin and mass mπ about 200 times greater than that of the electron.
Around a single nucleon, the so-called virtual pions constantly are born and die. The
term “virtual” is used here, because these particles exist for such a short time that due to the
time-energy uncertainty relation (∆t ∆E ∼ℏ), it is possible for the energy of the system
to change by ∼mπc2. For virtual particles, the common relation between energy and
momentum does not hold. These particles have different impulses (of different directions)
with the average value mπc and in their lifetime travel the average distance c∆t ∼ℏ/(mπc)
equal to the Compton wavelength of a π-meson. Sometimes in this situation one speaks
of a single nucleon surrounded by a coat of π-mesons whose radius, r0, is equal to their
Compton length. As two nucleons approach one another by the distance r0, their meson
coats begin to overlap and some virtual pions born of one nucleon are absorbed by the
other. In 1935, Yukawa showed that upon averaging over the momenta of virtual pions,
there arises attraction with potential energy described by (P8.1.2.1) with r0 = ℏ/(mπc). At
that time, π-mesons were still unknown. Yukawa predicted their existence and estimated

P8.1. BASIC PROPERTIES OF NUCLEI
623
their mass in terms of the nuclear interaction radius. (It was not until 1947 that π-mesons
were discovered in cosmic rays.)
Let it be mentioned here that the carriers of electromagnetic interaction are virtual photons. Photons
have zero mass, and therefore, electromagnetic interaction has long-range character (r0 = ∞, and the Yukawa
formula (P8.1.2.1) results in the Coulomb interaction). Weak interaction is implemented through the exchange
of very massive W -bosons, and therefore, its radius is much smaller than that of nuclear interaction. Note also
that the contemporary theory assumes that the basic carriers of strong interaction are gluons implementing the
interaction between quarks, of which all strongly interacting particles are built (see Subsection P8.4.1).
P8.1.3. Nuclear Models
◮Nuclear models. It should be observed from the start that there is still no universal
model of the nucleus that could provide a uniﬁed theoretical approach to the calculation
of various nuclear characteristics. Each of the existing models is capable of successfully
explaining some properties of nuclei, while the other properties remain unaccounted for
or their explanation is too complex or questionable. Among these models, a special place
is occupied by the microscopic nuclear model proposed by A. B. Migdal, who called it
the theory of ﬁnite Fermi systems. This model is based on the theory of quantum Fermi
ﬂuid which applies the methods of the quantum ﬁeld theory to a statistical ensemble of
interacting fermions. The major achievements of the microscopic model are that it provides
a comparison and a uniﬁed justiﬁcation of outwardly distinct theoretical models (sometimes,
it is called a “model of nuclear models”).
The other models can be provisionally divided into two groups: collective models and
single-particle models. The ﬁrst group covers, in particular, the theory of inﬁnite nuclear
matter and the liquid-drop nuclear model. The second group contains the theories dealing
with the motion of separate nucleons either in a plane potential well of ﬁnite depth (nuclear
Fermi gas) or in some effective potential (shell models). Some sophisticated shell models
take into account pairing of identical nucleons.
There are some new models that combine certain features of the said two groups. The
interior part of the nucleus corresponding to completely ﬁlled up shells is regarded as a drop
of nuclear ﬂuid in whose ﬁeld external nucleons are moving.
◮Liquid-drop (hydrodynamic) nuclear model treats the nucleus as a charged drop of
nuclear liquid with surface tension. This model describes basic properties of the dependence
of binding energy on A and Z and characterizes surface vibrations of nuclei and some
properties of ﬁssion of heavy nuclei.
◮The nuclear Fermi gas model is used for the explanation of the symmetry effect (Z is
approximately equal to N in light nuclei) and its violation in heavy nuclei, and this model
allows one to calculate the depth of the effective potential well.
In this model, both protons and neutrons are regarded as two subsystems of identical
fermions moving freely in a potential well. On each level, two identical particles with
different spins can exist. The more nucleons of a given type are present in the nucleus, the
more their Fermi energy. If there is a considerable divergence between the Fermi energies
of neutrons and protons, then one nucleon will transform into another with total energy
decrease (either n →p + e– + eν or p →n + e+ + ν). Therefore, in a stable nucleus, the
Fermi energies should be approximately the same. With the Coulomb interaction neglected,
the total (common) energy minimum corresponds to approximately the same number of
neutrons and protons.
This situation corresponds to light nuclei.
In heavy nuclei, the
Coulomb interaction between protons is increasingly signiﬁcant and leveling of the Fermi
energies occurs when the number of neutrons exceeds that of protons.
Example. Using the mean concentration of nucleons in the nucleus calculated in the example of Subsection
P8.1.1, estimate the depth of the potential well occupied by these nucleons.

624
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
Solution. To obtain such an estimate, we neglect the Coulomb interaction. The mean kinetic energy of
nucleons of one type is equal to (see Subsection P7.1.2)
Kmean = 3
5 EF = 3
5
ℏ2(3π2n1)2/3
2M
∼20 MeV/nucleon,
where n1 ∼0.6 × 1044 m–3 is the concentration of nucleons of one type equal to one half of the nucleon
concentration. The mean speciﬁc binding energy is about 8 MeV/nucleon. This energy can be calculated as
the difference between the well depth and the mean kinetic energy. We ﬁnd that the well depth should be about
30 MeV. As will be shown below, the estimate just obtained is well below the actual value.
◮Empirical formula for binding energy. On the basis of the liquid-drop and the gas
models, one can write a fairly simple empirical formula (Weizs¨acker’s formula) for nuclear
binding energy (1935):
Eb = εA = α1A – α2A2/3 – α3
Z2
A1/3 – α4
(A – 2Z)2
A
– α5
δ(Z, N)
A3/4
,
(P8.1.3.1)
where δ(Z, N) is equal to –1 for even-even nuclei, 0 for even-odd nuclei, and 1 for odd-odd
nuclei. The coefﬁcients αi are chosen from experimental data and at present the following
values are adopted: α1 = 15.75 MeV, α2 = 17.8 MeV, α3 = 0.71 MeV, α4 = 23.7 MeV, and
α5 = 34 MeV.
The ﬁrst three terms correspond to the concepts of the liquid-drop model. The ﬁrst
term reﬂects approximate proportionality of binding energy to the number of nucleons; the
coefﬁcient α1 can be understood as binding energy associated with a single nucleon in an
imaginary nuclear substance (matter) with electric interaction “turned off.” The second term
describes “surface tension” of a nuclear drop (the nucleons on the surface of the nucleus
are in special conditions), and the third term describes its electrostatic energy.
The fourth term is due to the symmetry effect explained in the framework of the nuclear
Fermi gas. This term attains its minimum for N = Z, since the divergence from total
symmetry observed with an increase of A is connected with the Coulomb energy, and this
has been accounted for in the third term. The ﬁfth term reﬂects stepwise change of binding
energy at the transition from a given nucleus to nuclei with adjacent values of A or Z.
It is of interest to note a considerable divergence of the coefﬁcient α1 from the mean
value of speciﬁc binding energy ε ∼8 MeV. The point is that ε already contains the
Coulomb and the surface energies. If ε is replaced by α1 in example (when estimating the
well depth), then the binding energy acquires the value ∼40 MeV.
Onthe basis of Weizs¨acker’s formula one can perform fairly precise (∼10–4) calculations
of binding energy for many nuclides, especially heavy ones, α-decay energy, ﬁssion and
fusion energies, and many other characteristics. However, to explain the existence of magic
nuclei, to calculate spins and magnetic moments, one cannot do without the shell model.
◮Shell model of the nucleus (Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen, 1949). This model assumes
that each nucleon is moving in a self-consistent ﬁeld produced by other nucleons. The
potential energy of this ﬁeld is chosen so as to give the best agreement with experimental
data for a wide range of nuclei.
In contrast with electrons in an atom, spin-orbit interaction plays a much greater role
for nucleons and and can reach 10–15%.
Furthermore, the Russel–Saunders coupling
common for electrons (i.e., LS-coupling, in which the spins and orbital angular momenta
of all particles are ﬁrst summed up separately and then the total spin is added to the total
orbital angular momentum) is suitable for the lightest nuclei only, whereas for most other
nuclei the jj-coupling is more appropriate, in which the spin of each individual nucleon
is added to its orbital angular momentum. The nucleon energy levels are characterized by
the quantum numbers l (denoted by the letters s, p, d, f, g, . . . ), j (equal to l – 1
2 or l + 1
2

P8.2. NUCLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
625
and speciﬁed as the right subscript), and mj, and also the number n that enumerates the
levels with a given l and can take the values 1, 2, 3, . . . . To each level, there correspond
2j + 1 states. The nucleon energy levels are grouped into shells; the distances between
these groups are signiﬁcantly greater than the interlevel distances within a shell. The magic
numbers correspond to shells being completely ﬁlled up:
I: 1s1/2 (2 nucleons);
II: 2p3/2, 2p1/2 (6 nucleons, altogether 8);
III: 1d5/2, 2s1/2, 1d3/2 (12 nucleons, altogether 20);
IV: 1f7/2 (8 nucleons, altogether 28);
V: 2p3/2, 1f5/2, 2p1/2, 1g9/2 (22 nucleons, altogether 50);
VI: 1g7/2, 2d5/2, 2d3/2, 3s1/2, 1h11/2 (32 nucleons, altogether 82);
VII: 1h9/2, 2f7/2, 2f5/2, 3p3/2, 3p1/2, 1i13/2 (44 nucleons, altogether 126).
Nucleon states are ﬁlled up in the order indicated in the above scheme. Using this, one can
obtain correct values for the spins of almost all nuclei.
P8.2. Nuclear Transformations
P8.2.1. Radioactivity
Radioactivity is a spontaneous emission of one or several particles from a nucleus accom-
panied by its transformation into another nucleus (or its transition to another state). The
original radioactive nucleus (nuclide) is called parent nucleus, and product nuclei are called
daughter nuclei.
Basic types of radioactivity are the following: α-decay, β-decay, and γ-decay. In spite
of different physical processes associated with these types of decay, their time evolution is
described by one and the same law.
◮Radioactive decay law. Since radioactive decay has a random nature, it can be assumed
that on a small time-interval dt the fraction of split nuclei is proportional to dt. Denoting
by N(t) the number of intact nuclei by the time instant t, we come to the equation
dN
N
= –λ dt.
(P8.2.1.1)
The coefﬁcient λ is called the decay constant. The solution of equation (P8.2.1.1) has the
form
N = N0e–λt,
(P8.2.1.2)
where N0 is the number of nuclei for t = 0. This relation is called the radioactive decay
law.
The number of nuclei decaying per unit time is called radioactive sample activity:
A =
 dN
dt
 = λN = A0e–λt,
(P8.2.1.3)
where A0 is the initial activity of the a sample. Activity per unit mass is called speciﬁc
activity. Activity is measured in becquerels (1 Bq corresponds to one decay per second) or
curies (1 Ci = 3.7 × 1010 Bq).
Apart from the constant λ, decay is characterized by the half-life period T1/2 (often
called half-life) equal to the time in which half of the nuclei undergo decay (N = N0/2).
From (P8.2.1.2), we ﬁnd that
T1/2 = ln 2
λ
= 0.693
λ
.
(P8.2.1.4)

626
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
It is natural to introduce the mean lifetime of a nucleus, τ. The probability of the event that
the nucleus decays on the time interval (t, t+dt) is equal to |dN|/N0 = λNdt/N0 = λe–λtdt,
and therefore,
τ =
Z ∞
0
tλe–λtdt = 1
λ =
T1/2
ln 2 = 1.44T1/2.
(P8.2.1.5)
Example. Calculating sample activity. The half-life of the isotope 90
38Sr is about 28 years. What is the
activity of its m = 1 g sample?
Solution. The activity is equal to the product of the decay constant λ = ln 2/T1/2 and the number of nuclei
N = NA(m/µ), where µ = 90 g/mol. We obtain A = 5.2 × 1012 c–1 = 140 curie.
◮Alpha decay. The alpha decay (or α-decay) of a nucleus X with atomic number Z and
mass number A results in the nucleus 4He (known as the alpha particle or α-particle) and a
daughter nucleus Y with atomic number Z – 2 and mass number A – 4:
A
ZX →A–4
Z–2Y + 4
2He.
(P8.2.1.6)
Alpha decay is observed only for heavy nuclei (mostly with A > 209).
The energy released during the α-decay is equal to
Q = mX – mα – mY,
(P8.2.1.7)
where the nuclear masses are expressed in energy units. Note that instead of nuclear masses
one can substitute masses of nuclides (electron masses are mutually canceled) or their mass
defects.
The fact that one observes decay with the emission of the nucleus 4He, and not other
light nuclei or single nucleons, is explained by the abnormally large binding energy of the
nucleus 4He. For example, the α-decay of the nucleus 232U is accompanied by the emission
of 5.4 MeV energy, and for the emission of a proton by this nucleus it should be supplied
with 6.1 MeV energy.
Due to the momentum conservation law, the nucleus experiences recoil and carries
away part of the energy. For this reason, the registered energy of α-particles is less than
the reaction energy Q. Assuming that the parent nucleus were at rest, let us write the
momentum conservation law (for) pα = pY in terms of kinetic energies of the daughter
nucleus and the α-particle:
mαKα = mYKY
Expressing KY from the above formula and inserting it into the energy conservation law
Kα + KY = Q,
we obtain
Kα =
mY
mY + mα
Q = A – 4
A
Q,
where A is the mass number of the parent nucleus. As a rule, we have A > 210, and
therefore, the kinetic energy of the α-particle is greater than 98% of the decay energy.
Since the average lifetime of most α-active nuclei is great, they are subject to decay
from the ground state. Moreover, due to a very “sharp” (strong) dependence of the decay
constant on the energy of the outgoing particles, one observes the most intensive transition
to the ground state of the parent nucleus. Therefore, in most cases, all α-particles of a
given decay have the same energy. In some cases, one observes α-particles that correspond
to low (rotational) levels, and this leads to a slight blurring of the α-spectrum. Moreover,
for some extremely short-lived nuclei, decay is possible from excited states of the parent
nucleus and one observes α-particles with energies considerably larger than the principal
value (for example, polonium isotopes 212
84Po and 214
84Po emit not only “common” α-particles
but those with energies up to 10.5 MeV).

P8.2. NUCLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
627
◮Theory of alpha decay. For a long time, some properties of α-decay looked quite
mysterious.
In the ﬁrst place, it is an unusually strong dependence of the half-life on
the energy of α-particles.
In the principal region of α-activity (A ≥210), α-particles
with energies signiﬁcantly smaller than 4 MeV are never observed (their half-lives are too
great), for 204
82Pb, Kα ≈4 MeV and T1/2 = 1.4 × 1017 years, and for 212
84Po, Kα ≈9 MeV
and T1/2 = 3 × 10–7 s. Moreover, one could not understand how it was possible for an
α-particle to leave the nucleus at all. Outside the nucleus, its Coulomb potential energy
Ucol = 2(Z – 2)e2
4πε0r
attains its maximum on the boundary of the nucleus for r = R = r0A1/3 (see (P8.1.1.1)), and
inside the nucleus it enters a negative potential well of nuclear forces. Hence, the α-particle
is locked by a potential barrier (Fig. P8.3) whose height U0 ∼25–30 MeV is considerably
greater than the energy of α-particles 4–9 MeV.
The alpha particle can penetrate this
barrier only through quantum tunneling (see Subsection P6.2.2). The theory of α-decay as
a tunneling transition was developed in 1928 by Gamow, Condon, and Gurney and explained
all its major properties.
Figure P8.3. Potential energy of an α-particle in the nucleus has the shape of a potential barrier.
In order to calculate the decay constant λ, the probability p of the production of an
α-particle inside the nucleus (it is assumed that p ∼1) should be multiplied by the number
of its collisions with the barrier ν ∼v/2R (v is speed of the α-particle) and the transmission

D ∼exp

This transmission coefﬁcient is responsible for the sharp (exponential) dependence of the
decay constant (and the half-life) on the energy of the outgoing particle Kα.
◮Beta decay. Beta decay (or β-decay) is the term applied to radioactive nuclear transfor-
mations in which a proton turns into a neutron (or vice versa) and involving electrons (or
positrons) and neutrinos (or antineutrinos). Basic types of β-decay are the following:
a) Electron β–-decay (beta-minus):
A
ZX →
A
Z+1Y + e– + eν
(P8.2.1.8)
(for example, decay of tritium 3
1H →3
2He + e– + eν).

628
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
b) Positron β+-decay (beta-plus):
A
ZX →
A
Z–1Y + e+ + ν
(P8.2.1.9)
(for example, decay of the artiﬁcial radioactive isotope of nitrogen 13
7N →13
6C + e+ + ν).
c) Electron capture:
e– + A
ZX →
A
Z–1Y + ν
(P8.2.1.10)
(for example, the reaction e– + 7
4B →7
3Li + ν). In electron capture, the nucleus absorbs
an electron from an atomic shell, usually from the K-shell, and therefore, this process is
called K-capture (one also observes L-capture). Electron capture is accompanied by the
characteristic X-ray radiation.
An important distinction of β-decays from other types of radioactivity is that the former
are intranucleon (pertaining a nucleon) processes rather than intranuclear (pertaining to
the entire nucleus) ones. This means that an elementary act of such a process consists in
the transformation of one nucleon into another. The schemes of the transformations listed
above are the following:
a) n →p + e– + eν;
b) p →n + e+ + ν;
c) e– + p →n + ν.
Such transformations (and therefore, nuclear β-decay) are possible only because of weak
interaction. In free space, only the ﬁrst process (neutron decay) can happen spontaneously.
However, within the nucleus the new nucleon turns out surrounded by other nucleons, in
the process of its birth the entire nucleus changes its structure, and the energy condition
required for the decay is determined by masses of the nuclei (the original and the produced)
rather than the nucleon masses.
Spontaneous decay is energetically allowed, if the sum of the masses of the original
particles is greater than the sum of the masses of the produced particles. For β-decay, this
condition has the form:
mX > mY + me (β– and β+-decay);
mX + me > mY (electron capture).
It is convenient to rewrite these formulas in terms of nuclide masses. Thus, for β–-decay,
one should take mX = MX – Zme, mY = MY – (Z + 1)me and the decay condition becomes
MX > MY (β–-decay).
For the other types of decay, we have:
MX > MY + 2me (β+-decay);
MX > MY (electron capture).
Note that the last two types of decay result in identical daughter nuclei, i.e., are competitive;
however, electronic capture is more energetically advantageous.
Weizs¨acker’s formula (P8.1.3.1) can be utilized to ﬁnd the parameters (Z, A) for the
nuclei most stable with respect to the above types of β-decay. Since the mass number A is
unchanged in these types of decay, one should compare the masses (binding energies) of all
isobars. Consider, for instance, an odd A (even-odd nuclei, ∆(A, Z) = 0). Minimizing the
nuclear energy E = Zmp + (A – Z)mn – Eb with respect to Z, we ﬁnd Zβ corresponding to
the maximum β-stability (Fig. P8.4a). The isobars with Z < Zβ should be examined with
regard to β–-decay, and those with Z > Zβ should be examined with regard to β+-decay and
electron capture. For even A, we obtain two branches of E(Z) (Fig. P8.4b): the upper one

for odd-odd nuclei and the lower one for even-even nuclei. The nuclei on the upper branch
are usually unstable with respect to transitions to the lower branch, but there are 4 β-stable
nuclei corresponding to the situation represented in Fig. P8.4c.
The number of β-active nuclides is much larger than that of α-active nuclides (each
element has a β-active isotope). The half-life depends on energy (the greater the energy
gain, the smaller T1/2), but this dependence is not as strong as in the case of α-decay.
Moreover, the greater the divergence between the structures of the ﬁnal and the original
nuclei (for instance, the difference of their spins), the slower the decay. Sometimes, the
transition to the ground state of the daughter nucleus has small probability (is a rare event),
and as a result of β-decay a nucleus in an excited state is produced.
The neutrino (more precisely, electron-type neutrino, which is one of its three modiﬁca-
tions) is a very light (possibly, massless) neutral particle with spin 1/2, which participates
only in weak interactions. For this reason, its interaction with matter is extremely weak
and its detection is very difﬁcult. Thus, for a neutrino with energy 100 MeV the mean free
path in water is of the order 1019 m (about 100 light years). A direct experimental proof of
the existence of neutrino was not obtained until 1956, when it became possible to utilize
a powerful ﬂux of neutrino resulting from uranium ﬁssion in nuclear reactor. (Reactions
of antineutrino capture eν + p →n + e+ were registered.) The existence of neutrino was
hypothesized by W. Pauli in 1930, in a rather dramatic situation due to its “invisibility.”
Figure P8.5. Distribution of β-electrons with respect to energies.
It was considered a proven fact that β–-decay results only in two particles: the daughter nucleus and the
electron. In that case, as in the case of any two-particle decay (say, α-decay) of a ﬁxed nucleus, the decay
products should have certain energies. With the kinetic energy of the daughter nucleus neglected, the electron
energy should be equal to ∆= mX – mY – me = MX – MY. However, in 1914, J. Chadwick established the
continuity of β-spectra. It turned out that the distribution of electrons with respect to energies is like that in
Fig. P8.5, and the electron energy averaged with respect to that distribution is as small as ∆/3. The situation
looked so paradoxical that in 1924 N. Bohr guessed that the energy conservation law could be violated in
micro-processes! As noticed in 1929, the angular momentum conservation law is violated for some types of
β-decay. Thus, for 210
83 Bi →210
84 Po + e–, the spins of the nuclei are equal to 1 and 0 and the electron carries
away a half-integer spin. This deadlock was broken by Pauli’s hypothesis about the existence of neutrino. On
the basis of this hypothesis, in 1934, E. Fermi developed the theory of weak interactions and calculated the

630
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
activities of β-decays and the spectra of outgoing electrons. In 1936, N. Bohr accepted the Fermi theory and
rejected the idea of non-conservation of energy.
◮Radioactive families. Most natural radioactive elements belong to four radioactive
families. All elements of these families are obtained by consecutive decay from a single
parent nuclide and end with some stable element. The decay family of thorium has mass
numbers 4n, starts with 232
90Th and ends with 208
82Pb.
The decay family of neptunium
(A = 4n+1) starts with 237
93Ne and ends with 209
83Bi. The decay family of uranium (A = 4n+2)
starts with 238
92U and ends with 206
82Pb. Finally, the actinium family (A = 4n + 3) starts with
235
92U and ends with 207
82Pb. (The ﬁrst three terms of the last family were discovered later.)
As an example, let us give the sequence of elements of the thorium family:

The element 212
83Bi can decay by way of α- and β-radiation, and therefore, on this element
the decay sequence branches.
◮Gamma decay. Gamma radiation is observed in transitions of an excited nucleus to
lower energy levels, with unchanged A and Z and emitted γ-quanta. After emitting one
or several photons, the nucleus comes to the ground state. Since nuclear energy values
are discrete, the spectrum of γ-radiation is also discrete. Excited nuclei are produced in
β-decay, if the decay to the ground state is forbidden. For example, β–-decay of 24
11Na with
spin I = 4 leads neither to the ground state 24
12Mg with spin I = 0, nor to the ﬁrst excited
level (I = 2), but leads to the second level with I = 4, upon which the nucleus consecutively
emits two γ-quanta with energies 2.7 MeV and 1.4 MeV and comes to the ground state.
A free nucleon cannot emit γ-quanta, since this would contradict the energy and the
momentum conservation laws. However, inside the nucleus, the momentum is redistributed
between all nucleons and radiation becomes possible. Thus, in contrast to β-decay, the
emission of γ-quanta is an intranuclear rather than intranucleon process.
The Coulomb barrier does not obstruct γ-radiation, and therefore, the lifetime of γ-active
nuclei is usually small, (10–7–10–15 s). However, in the cases when the transition to the
ground state is strongly hindered, one observes long-lived excited states called isomers. The
lifetime of isomers may reach several hours and even more. Some properties of isomers (in
particular, probabilities of β-decay) may be observably different from those of the ground
states.
A competitor of γ-decay is a process called internal conversion, in which an excited
nucleus transmits the energy surplus to one of the electrons of the atomic shell.
The
spectrum of the outgoing electrons, in contrast to that of β-electrons, is discrete. Moreover,
internal conversion is accompanied by the characteristic X-ray radiation.
◮M¨ossbauer effect. If the energy of an incident photon coincides with the energy of
the transition of a system from the ground state to an excited state, then the probability of
such a photon being absorbed drastically increases. This phenomenon is called resonant
absorption. The dependence of the absorption probability on energy has the shape of a
sharp peak whose width is equal to that of the excited level ∆E (∆E ∼ℏ/∆t, where ∆t
is the lifetime of the excited state). The natural scheme of resonant absorption utilizes
identical atoms as the emitter and the absorber. Such a scheme is used in optics, where the
emission and the absorption are determined by electron transitions. However, observation
of resonant absorption of nuclear γ-quanta encounters serious obstacles. The point is that
when emitting a γ-quantum the atom experiences a much greater recoil and carries away

P8.2. NUCLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
631
more energy than in the case of emitting an optical photon. This leads to a more signiﬁcant
decrease of the frequency of the emitted photon and its absorption becomes a rare event
(has small probability) (moreover, during absorption part of the photon energy is lost on
the kinetic energy of the atomic recoil and the energy of the absorbed photon must be not
smaller but greater than the energy of the excited level).
The momentum of nuclear recoil is equal to that of the photon: p = ℏω/c, and the nuclear energy is equal
to
Enuc =
p2
2mnuc =
(ℏω)2
2mnucc2 .
(P8.2.1.11)
For resonance absorption, the photon energy shift (coinciding with nuclear energy Enuc) should not exceed the
level width ∆E. However, we have ℏω > 104 eV, and mnucc2 < 2 × 1011 eV; therefore, Enuc > 10–3 eV. At the
same time, the common value of the excited level width is ∆E ∼10–8–10–7 eV. We see that nuclear recoil
causes a decrease of the γ-quantum energy by a quantity that exceeds the width of excited nuclear levels by
many orders.
In 1958, M¨ossbauer discovered that at low temperatures resonant absorption is observed
on the isotope 191
77Ir. The essence of the phenomenon known as the M¨ossbauer effect is
the following.
During both emission and absorption of γ-quanta by atoms forming a
crystal lattice, the recoil momentum can be imparted to the entire crystal as a whole (more
precisely, to a group of N ∼108 atoms).
This means that the recoil energy becomes
negligibly small (mnuc in (P8.2.1.11) should be replaced by the crystal mass) and the
conditions of resonance absorption hold. There appears the possibility to ﬁx changes of
energy of γ-quanta of the level width order, i.e., ∆E ∼10–8 eV. The important quantity
here is not ∆E itself (for electron levels it is of the same order) but its ratio to the energy of
photons (this ratio characterizes relative measurement errors). Since the energy of nuclear
γ-quanta is 104–108 eV, the precision of measurements based on the M¨ossbauer effect
reaches 10–12–10–16.
One of the ﬁrst applications of the M¨ossbauer effect was the measurement of the
gravitational red shift in the Earth’s ﬁeld of gravity (Pound and Rebka, 1960). The essence
of the phenomenon is that as a photon moves in the gravitational ﬁeld, its energy should
change. The relative variation of the frequency and the energy should be equal to
∆E
E
= (E/c2)∆ϕ
E
= ∆ϕ
c2 ,
where ∆ϕ is the gravitational potential. If the M¨ossbauer emitter and receiver are placed
on the same vertical line with the distance h between them, then ∆ϕ = gh. For h = 30 m,
the relative frequency variation ∆ω/ω = ∆E/E = 3 × 10–15 is within the precision range
of the method.
The change of the frequency shift is measured on the basis of the Doppler effect.
The emitter and the receiver being ﬁxed, resonance absorption is absent because of the
gravitational shift. Moving the receiver in the vertical direction, one ﬁnds the speed v at
which there again appears resonant absorption. Then ∆ω/ω = v/c.
◮Radiation dose measurement. The absorbed dose of ionizing radiation is deﬁned as
the energy absorbed by a medium per unit mass and expressed in greys (Gy) (1 Gy = 1 J/kg).
The ionizing effect of X-rays and gamma rays on dry air is characterized by the exposure
dose, deﬁned as the net charge of all ions of like sign produced in one kilogram of irradiated
air and measured in roentgens (R); 1 R = 2.58 × 10–4 C/kg. Alternatively, 1 R is deﬁned
as the amount of radiation required to generate 2.08 × 109 ion pairs in 1 cm3 of dry air at
standard temperature and pressure.
To evaluate the biological effect of radiation on living organisms, one uses the so-called
radiation quality factor Q (also known as the radiation weighting factor), which indicates

632
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
how many times a particular type of radiation is more dangerous than X-rays or gamma
rays for the same dose absorbed. For beta radiation, Q = 1; for protons with energies
less than 10 MeV, Q = 10; for thermal neutrons with energies less than 20 keV, Q = 3;
for neutrons with energies 0.5–10 MeV, Q = 10; for alpha radiation with energy less than
10 MeV, Q = 20; for heavy nuclei, Q = 20. The equivalent radiation dose is the product
of the absorbed dose and the quality factor. The equivalent dose is measured in sieverts
(1 Sv is equal to 1 Gy for Q = 1). The unit rem is also used (roentgen equivalent in man or
mammal, a biological equivalent of roentgen): 1 rem = 0.01 Sv.
P8.2.2. Nuclear Reactions
Nuclear reaction is a process of the type
a + A
ZX →A′
Z′Y + b,
(P8.2.2.1)
where a is the original (incident) particle, A
ZX is the original nucleus (target nucleus), A′
Z′Y
is the ﬁnal nucleus, b is the ﬁnal (outgoing) particle. One often uses the following symbolic
notation:
AX(a, b)A′Y ,
(P8.2.2.2)
and the type of the process is brieﬂy denoted by (a, b).
For b = a (and X = Y ), the
corresponding process is called scattering. If, in addition, the ﬁnal nucleus Y is in the same
state as the original X, then one speaks of elastic scattering.
For the reaction (P8.2.2.1) to be possible, it is necessary that conservation laws hold
for the electric charge and some other charges (lepton, baryon, etc.), which is discussed in
Subsection P8.4.2. Moreover, the states of the resulting particles and the original ones are
related by the conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum.
Nuclear reactions are accompanied by changes in the nuclear structure, more precisely,
these reactions are possible only if the distances between the reacting particles become
smaller than the nuclear interaction radius r0 ∼10–15 m.
◮Yield and cross-section of nuclear reaction. Consider a ﬂux of incident particles (a)
of given energy hitting a ﬁxed nuclear target X. We start with a thin target of width ∆x and
the number of nuclei per unit area being N0 = n0∆x (n0 is volume concentration of target
nuclei). By deﬁnition, the yield of nuclear reaction is the fraction of incident particles (a)
taking part in a given reaction (that is, the probability of the reaction):
w = ∆N
N .
(P8.2.2.3)
Clearly, the reaction yield w is proportional to N0. The proportionality coefﬁcient has
dimensionality of area and is called the cross-section the nuclear reaction:
w = σN0
σ = ∆N
NN0
.
(P8.2.2.4)
Let us make a few remarks about the deﬁnition of the cross-section.
1. In Subsection P2.9.1, when discussing transfer phenomena, we introduced the effec-
tive cross-section of molecular scattering, whose meaning is similar to that of the nuclear
reaction cross-section. Besides, the notion of the differential cross-section of elastic scat-
tering was required in our analysis of Rutherford’s experiments (see Subsection P6.1.1).

P8.2. NUCLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
633
2. In (P8.2.2.4), the quantity N can be replaced by the particle ﬂux (number of particles
per unit time) or by the ﬂux density J (ﬂux per unit area), and the structure of the formula
remains the same, since it involves the relative number of particles.
3. In the case of a thin target, it can be assumed that each incident particle interacts with
only one target nucleus, and therefore, one can consider interaction of incident particles
with a single nucleus. Since the number of particles hitting the target is equal to N = JSt
(J is ﬂux density, S is target area) and N0S is the total number of target nuclei, we ﬁnd
that the cross-section can be deﬁned as the ratio of the number of particles reacting with a
single nucleus per unit time to the particle ﬂux density.
4. The yield and the cross-section are introduced for any selected interaction result. For
a given input channel (a + X) there are usually several output channels (Y + b). Thus, the
result of proton bombardment of nuclei 7
3Li can be 7
3Li + p (elastic and inelastic scattering),
α + α, 8
4Be + γ, etc. Some channels are closed for low energies. It should be kept in mind
that one of the general statements of quantum mechanics is that any process which is not
forbidden by any of the conservation laws is always realized (even if with small probability).
In particular, among possible channels, there is always elastic scattering.
5. In order to describe the dependence of the ﬁnal result of scattering on continuous
parameters (such as the exit angle or energy of a particle), one introduces various types of
differential cross-section. These are deﬁned as the ratio of the number of reactions resulting
in the said parameter (say, the angle θ) belonging to a certain narrow interval (say, between
θ and θ + dθ) to the number of incident particles N multiplied by the number of target
particles per unit area N0 and the interval width:
dσ
dθ =
dN
NN0 dθ
or
dσ
dΩ=
dN
NN0 dΩ,
where Ωis solid angle, with dΩ= sin θ dθ dϕ. Integrating the differential cross-section over
all possible values of the parameter (parameters), one obtains the total cross-section of the
reaction.
6. To have a more clear idea of the cross-section, one can imagine that the particles are
classical and their interaction has such a short range that they can be replaced by balls of
radii R1 and R2, and the reaction occurs as soon as the particles come into contact. Then,
σ = π(R1 + R2)2 (such a model is used in the theory of transfer phenomena). This model
has some bearing to reality in the cases of high energy of incident particles, if the de Broglie
wavelength λ is small compared with the radius R of the nucleus (and there is no Coulomb
interaction). In this situation,
σ ∼πR2 ∼10–30–10–28 m2.
(P8.2.2.5)
For slow particles (λ ≫R), the cross-section drastically increases, since it is determined
not by the nuclear radius but by the de Broglie wavelength:
σ ∼πλ2.
However, this estimate pertains only to neutrons, since a slow charged particle cannot
overcome Coulomb repulsion and approach the nucleus.
The estimate (P8.2.2.5) shows why nuclear cross-sections are expressed in barns (b)
(1 b = 10–28 m2).

634
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
7. If the target is not thin, then the beam intensity decreases inside the target and the
cross-section of the reaction is expressed through its yield by a more complex formula than
(P8.2.2.4). This can be done, if one knows the total cross-section of the processes leading
to beam attenuation. The simplest situation is that of the reaction under consideration being
the only possible one. Then, for each layer one can write
dN
N
= –σn dx,
(P8.2.2.6)
where N is the number of beam particles that have reached the layer with the coordinate x,
ndx is the number of target atoms in a layer of thickness dx (per unit area), n is volume
concentration of atoms, the symbol (–) indicates that reacted particles abandon the beam.
The solution of equation (P8.2.2.6) has the form
N = N0e–σnx,
(P8.2.2.7)
where N0 is the original number of beam particles. The quantity α = σn is called the
absorption coefﬁcient. It is easy to check that the mean free path is equal to
l = 1
σn
(P8.2.2.8)
(see Subsection P2.9.1).
Example.
It is required to calculate the free path of neutrino in iron if the neutrino interaction cross-section
is σν ≈10–19 b = 10–47 m2.
Solution. The iron atomic concentration is equal to n = ρNA/µ, where NA is Avogadro’s number,
ρ = 7.8 × 103 kg/m3 is iron density, and µ = 58 × 10–3 kg/mol is molar (atomic) mass of iron. We obtain
l = 1/(nσ) = 1.2 × 1018 m, which is about 130 light years.
◮Reaction energy. The energy conservation law for an arbitrary nuclear reaction can be
written in the form
X
i
mi +
X
i
Ki =
X
i
m′
i +
X
i
K′
i
(P8.2.2.9)
(the masses are expressed in energy units). The reaction energy Q is deﬁned as the kinetic
energy increment (or mass decrease):
Q =

Ki =

m′
i =

(P8.2.2.10)
where ∆is the mass defect (see Subsection P8.1.1). Note also that reaction energy can be
expressed through nuclear binding energy (Q = P
i E′
bi – P
i Ebi), but only if the number
of protons is preserved (if charges are carried only by nuclear protons). Reactions with
energy release (Q > 0) are called exothermic, and those with Q < 0 are called endothermic.
Sometimes, reaction energy is indicated in its notation, for example, n + 10B →7Li + 4He +
2.79 MeV or 4
2He + 14
7N →17
8O + 1
1H – 1.2 MeV.
Since the last expression in (P8.2.2.10) does not depend on the reference frame, the
reaction energy is equal to the kinetic energy increment in any reference frame, in particular,
that of the center of mass
Q =
X
i
eK′

(P8.2.2.11)

P8.2. NUCLEAR TRANSFORMATIONS
635
If the reaction involves an incident (non-relativistic) particle of mass ma and a stationary
target particle of mass MX, then the kinetic energy of the system in its center-of-mass frame
can be linked to the kinetic energy of the incident particle K:
eK =
MX
ma + MX
K.
(P8.2.2.12)
The kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame is expressed via the reduced mass µ = maMX/(ma +MX)
and the relative particle velocity vrel = v1 – v2:
eK = µv2
rel

MX
ma + MX

(see Subsection P1.6.4). It has been taken into account that the relative velocity does not depend on the reference
frame and the target particle is at rest in the laboratory reference frame.
◮Threshold of nuclear reaction. Endothermic reaction can proceed only if the kinetic
energy of the incident particle is greater than some minimum value called threshold of
reaction.
The threshold of reaction Kthr does not coincide with |Q|, since due to the
momentum conservation law the ﬁnal kinetic energy in the laboratory reference frame
differs from zero and Kthr = |Q| + K′ (see (P8.2.2.10)). However, in the center-of-mass
frame, on the reaction threshold the particles in the ﬁnal state are at rest ( eK′ = 0) and the
initial kinetic energy is equal to |Q| (see (P8.2.2.11)). From (P8.2.2.12), we get
Kthr = ma + MX
MX
eK = ma + MX
MX
|Q|.
(P8.2.2.13)
In the situation when the incident particle and decay products cannot be assumed non-relativistic, the
threshold of endothermic reaction ma + MX →m1 + m2 + · · · can be expressed through its energy |Q| =
(m1+m2 +· · ·)c2 –(ma +MX)c2 as follows. The quantity E2–p2c2 (here, E is the energy of the system and p is
its momentum) is preserved during the reaction and is also unchanged, if one passes to another reference frame.
Let us equate the initial value of this quantity in the laboratory reference system to its ﬁnal value calculated in
the center-of-mass frame (where p = 0):
[Kthr + (ma + MX)c2]2 – p2c2 = (m1 + m2 + · · ·)2c4.
Taking into account that the momentum of the target MX is zero, for particle ma we can write
p2c2 = (Kthr + mac2)2 – m2
ac4 = Kthr(Kthr + 2mac2).
After suitable rearrangements, we get
(ma + MX)2c2 + 2MXKb = (m1 + m2 + · · ·)2c2,
and therefore,
Kthr = (m1 + m2 + · · ·)2 – (ma + MX)2

one should take ma = 0. The photon threshold energy is equal to

Example. Calculate the threshold energy of γ-quantum for the production of an electron-positron pair on
a proton and an electron at rest.
Solution. Note that the production of an electron-positron pair by a photon is impossible in empty space
(see above), but it is possible in the ﬁeld of a third particle (e.g., a proton). In this example, we are dealing with
the reaction γ + p →e– + e+ + p. Setting ma = 0, MX = mp, and m1 + m2 + · · · = 2me + mp in (P8.2.2.14),
we obtain

ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
◮Mechanisms of nuclear reactions. Just as there is still no universal theory accounting
for all properties of nuclei, there is no uniﬁed theory of nuclear reactions. The features of
different types of reactions in different energy intervals are described in terms of different
models (or mechanisms, as they are also called) of nuclear reactions. Let us brieﬂy dwell
on some of those.
The mechanism of direct reactions (S. Butler, 1953) is aimed at explaining some
features of reactions occurring at high energies, for instance, high anisotropy (maximum
probability of forward emission), almost complete energy transfer to the outgoing fragment,
etc.
Such processes include, in particular, the stripping reaction (d, p), (d, n) and the
pickup reaction (p, d), (n, d).
In direct reaction, the incident particle reacts not with
the entire nucleus but with its fragment — a nucleon or a small group of nucleons —
transmitting energy to that fragment in a short (nuclear) time 10–22–10–21 s. (This time is
typical of reactions determined exclusively by nuclear forces. Nuclear time is estimated as
τnucl = 2R/v ∼10–23–10–21 s, where v ∼107–108 m/s is the nucleon speed.)
The mechanism of compound nucleus (N. Bohr, 1936) accounts for many features
of reactions occurring at low energies.
In the ﬁrst place, it is the long duration (on a
nuclear scale) of many reactions (τ ∼10–16–10–12 s, which is by many orders greater than
nuclear time τnucl ∼10–22 s). Secondly, it is the symmetry (in the center-of-mass frame) of
forward-backward particle emission (sometimes, even complete isotropy). Thirdly, it is the
resonance character of reactions: their cross-sections have sharp maxima for some energy
values. The essence of the mechanism of compound nucleus consists in that the reaction
occurs in two stages:
a + X →C∗→Y + b.
(P8.2.2.16)
On the ﬁrst stage, the parent nucleus X captures the incident particle and a compound
nucleus C (in an excited state, which is indicated by the superscript ∗) is formed. The
excitation energy is calculated as the sum of the binding energy of the particle a in the
nucleus C (equal to EaC = mX + ma – mC) and the initial kinetic energy eK (in center-of-
mass frame):
Eexc = EaC + eK.
(P8.2.2.17)
The process of particle capture and distribution of surplus energy between nucleons of
the compound nucleus goes on for a short time ∼τnucl. Then, the compound nucleus
disintegrates in one of the possible ways (with different probabilities): either the surplus
energy is randomly concentrated on a single particle (nucleon or a group of nucleons)
and it abandons the nucleus, or a γ-quantum is emitted, or there is nuclear ﬁssion. All
these processes are much slower than nuclear ones, which accounts for the slowness of the
reactions occurring with compound nucleus formation.
The symmetry of emission of decay products is explained by the fact that the compound
nucleus is capable of “forgetting” the direction of the incident particle. The resonance
character of the reaction cross-section is connected with the fact that the probability of
particle capture (and therefore, the cross-section of the entire process) increases sharply,
if Eexc in (P8.2.2.17) coincides with one of the discrete energy levels of the compound
nucleus. These values correspond to discrete values of kinetic energy eK, through which
the energy of the incident particle is expressed (as shown above).
The mechanism of compound nucleus gives an acceptable explanation of the fact that
reactions with different initial particles may have similar ﬁnal results. Thus, the reactions

occur with the formation of one and the same compound nucleus 14
7N∗, and if their excitation
energies turn out to be equal, then they will have identical output channels.

◮Statistical model. For large excitation energies, the spectrum of the compound nucleus
becomes practically continuous, and the statistical model of decay, or the nuclear evapo-
ration model, becomes applicable. In this model, the compound nucleus is regarded as a
drop of hot liquid with temperature T = Eexc/k (k is the Boltzmann constant) and particle
emission as evaporation from its surface. In the framework of this model, it is clear why
within this energy range the angular distribution of emitted particles becomes isotropic (in
the center-of-mass frame).
P8.3. Nuclear Power Engineering
Since maximum speciﬁc binding energy is characteristic of medium nuclei (with A ∼
50–60), it is natural to expect that ﬁssion of heavy nuclei, as well as fusion (synthesis) of
light nuclei is accompanied by energy release. The energy released in ﬁssion is called atomic
and that released in fusion thermonuclear. The construction in the middle of the twentieth
century of atomic and thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs, in which the said reactions occur
uncontrollably, put the very existence of humankind at risk. At the same time, controllable
generation of energy at nuclear power plants is of great importance for power industry
of many countries (in spite of the many ecological problems involved). The solution of
the problem of controlled thermonuclear fusion would give a practically inexhaustible,
ecologically safe source of energy. Moreover, reactions of fusion are the main source of
energy of the sun and other stars.
P8.3.1. Nuclear Fission
◮Spontaneous ﬁssion. In order to have a qualitative picture of ﬁssion phenomena and
obtain some quantitative estimates, one can use the liquid-drop nuclear model and the
corresponding Weizs¨acker’s formula (P8.1.3.1). For qualitative understanding, one can
consider ﬁssion resulting in two identical fragments. Fissure leads to Coulomb energy
drop and an increase of surface energy. The ratio of the corresponding terms in (P8.1.3.1)
depends on the parameter κ = Z2/A, and ﬁssion probability also depends on this parameter.
It is not difﬁcult to check that ﬁssion becomes energetically efﬁcient for
Z2
A > κ1 ≈18.
(P8.3.1.1)
The substitution of actual values of Z and A shows that ﬁssion starts to be efﬁcient for
nuclei in the niobium–palladium range, i.e., starting from A ∼100. However, spontaneous
ﬁssion is observed only for very heavy nuclei (with A ∼250).
This is due to the fact that although the two-fragment state has a smaller energy, the
transition to that state requires overcoming a substantial potential barrier. Subject to gradual
deformation, the nucleus passes through intermediate states whose energy is greater than
that of the initial state. Figure P8.6 schematically represents the dependence of the energy
of the deformed nucleus on a conditional parameter γ describing the degree of deformation.
The barrier height equal to the difference between the maximum intermediate energy and the
initial energy of the nucleus is called activation energy Eact. If excitation energy received by
the nucleus exceeds Eact, it quickly splits into two fragments. Activation energy decreases
with the growth of Z2/A and vanishes for
Z2
A > κ2 ≈50.
(P8.3.1.2)

638
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
In the absence of a barrier, the nucleus instantly splits into two fragments without receiving
any additional energy. Due to quantum tunneling, spontaneous ﬁssion from the ground
state is also possible for Z2/A < κ2, but the barrier should be not too high; otherwise,
ﬁssion probability would be very small. Thus, for 238
92U, we have Z2/A = 35.5, which is
considerably less than κ2, and the and half-life of 238
92U with respect to spontaneous ﬁssion
is T1/2 ∼1016 years, which is by 6 orders greater than T1/2 of this element with respect to
α-ﬁssion. On the other hand, for the artiﬁcial nucleus with Z = 107 and A = 261, we have
Z2/A = 43.9, and its half-life with respect to spontaneous ﬁssion is T1/2 ∼10–3, which is
comparable with T1/2 with respect to α-ﬁssion.

Figure P8.6. Energy of intermediate states of a nucleus in the process if its ﬁssion.
Speciﬁc binding energy of nuclei with A ∼240 is by 0.9 MeV less than that of ﬁssion
fragments. This means that in every instance of ﬁssion, about 200 MeV energy is released.
More than 80% of that energy is carried away as kinetic energy of the fragments. The
remaining energy goes for the emission of neutrons and γ- and β-particles by the fragments.
As a rule, ﬁssion results in fragments with different masses. Light fragments are grouped
around Kr, and heavy ones around Xe. This is explained by the fact that the numbers of
neutrons in these nuclei are close to magic numbers 50 and 82.
Since the fraction of neutrons in heavy nuclei is considerably greater than in light nuclei,
daughter nuclei have an excess number of neutrons. Immediately after ﬁssion, daughter
nuclei emit 2 or 3 neutrons with kinetic energy ∼2 MeV, after which there occur several
β-decays that bring the fragments to a stable state. Neutron emission by ﬁssion products
plays the key role in ensuring the chain reaction of ﬁssion.
Of great importance for the controlled chain reaction are the so-called delayed neutrons.
These are produced in the case when a sufﬁciently slow β-decay of a ﬁssion product results
in excited nuclear state with small energy of separation of a neutron, upon which the neutron
is instantly emitted. The delay is determined by the β-decay time and may reach tens of
seconds.
◮Fission of excited nuclei. When a nucleus receives a sufﬁcient amount of excitation
energy (several MeV), it starts to oscillate with its shape periodically changing from oblate
to prolate. Even if the excitation energy is less than the activation energy, the probability of
ﬁssion of an excited nucleus is substantially higher than in the ground state. A competitive
process is that of emission of excitation energy in the form of γ-quanta.
An excited nucleus with a considerable ﬁssion probability can be obtained by exposing
it to different types of particle radiation. The most effective is exposure to neutrons; there

P8.3. NUCLEAR POWER ENGINEERING
639
is no Coulomb barrier for neutrons and they can approach the nucleus even if their kinetic
energy is very small (of the order of 1 keV).
◮Neutron capture. The principal mechanism of ﬁssion of natural uranium isotopes,
235U and 238U, is neutron capture with the formation of compound nuclei 236U and 239U in
excited state. It is important that 235U is broken down by any, in particular, thermal neutrons
(with energies less than 0.5 keV), while 238U only by fast neutrons (with energies of the
order of 2 MeV). The point is that the compound nucleus 236U is of the even-even type and
for the same amount of neutron energy, its excitation energy turns out greater than that of
the even-odd nucleus 239U.
Excitation energy of a compound nucleus can be found from the equation
mn + Kn + MA = MA+1 + Eexc,
where Kn is the kinetic energy of the neutron (the kinetic energy of the compound nucleus is neglected). We
get
Eexc = (mn + MA – MA+1) + Kn = εA+1 + Kn,
where εA+1 is the neutron binding energy in the compound nucleus. A compact nucleus undergoes ﬁssion, if
Eexc becomes greater than activation energy. For 239U, we have Eact = 7.1 MeV, and εA+1 = 5.5 MeV; therefore,
when exposed to neutron radiation, the nucleus 238U requires for ﬁssion Kn not less than 1.6 MeV. For 236U, we
have εA+1 = 6.8 MeV, which is greater than Eact = 6.5 MeV, and thus the nucleus 235U will disintegrate when
exposed to any neutrons.
The cross-section of capture of slow neutrons is determined by their de Broglie wave-
length, which can be much larger than the nuclear radius. The cross-section of capture of
thermal neutrons with energy 0.025 keV is hundreds of times greater than the cross-section
of capture of fast neutrons with energy 1 MeV, whence the great importance of ﬁssion
caused by thermal neutrons.
◮Chain reaction. The possibility of self-sustained reaction of ﬁssion (chain reaction) is
due to the fact that upon nuclear ﬁssion by a single neutron, ﬁssion fragments emit two or
three neutrons, which, in turn, can cause ﬁssion of other nuclei. The problem is that some of
the produced neutrons drop out of the reaction: are either absorbed without causing ﬁssion
or just leave the system through its boundary.
One deﬁnes the neutron multiplication coefﬁcient as the ratio of the number of neutrons
in the next generation to that in the preceding one:
k = Ni+1/Ni.
For the chain reaction to start, it is necessary that k be greater than unity. In order to keep
the reactor steady, k should be maintained equal to unity.
With the increase of the system’s dimensions, the fraction of neutrons abandoning the
system through its boundary tends to zero. Therefore, whereas k∞> 1 for an inﬁnite nuclear
medium, the condition k > 1 for a ﬁnite system of a certain shape will hold, if the mass
of that system exceeds some critical value called critical mass. The critical mass can be
decreased if the active object is surrounded by a shell that reﬂects neutrons. Thus, for the
pure element 235U the critical mass is 47 kg (ball of radius 17 cm), but if 235U is layered by
polyethylene ﬁlms and coated by a beryllium shell, the critical mass reduces to 250 g (ball
of radius 3 cm). Next we consider the chain reaction in inﬁnite nuclear medium.
Any nuclear fuel with reasonable production cost contains a high percentage of 238U.
Thus, natural uranium contains 99.3% 238U and only 0.7% 235U. Although 238U is also
capable of neutron ﬁssion, its probability is too small (and for neutrons with energies less
than 1.6 MeV this probability is equal to zero), and the rest of the neutrons are absorbed
by 238U without ﬁssion and with emission of γ-quanta (radiation capture (n, γ)). At the

640
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
same time, the probability of nuclear ﬁssion of 235U (and also 233U and 239
94Pu) is fairly high,
85–90%, and these elements can be split by both fast and slow neutrons.
High enrichment of uranium (i.e., a substantial increase of 235U concentration) is a
very costly process and is used only for the production of nuclear bomb charges (where
economical factors are inessential) and the construction of breeders—fast neutron reactors
(discussed below).
Chain reactions are mainly obtained with the use of slow (thermal) neutrons. Fission
neutrons have mean energy ∼2 MeV. For this energy, the cross-sections of neutron capture
by nuclei of 235U and 238U are of the same order. However, for thermal neutrons the situation
is quite different. For 238U, the capture cross-section remains small (≈2.8 b), and for 235U, it
sharply increases and is ≈650 b (which is much greater than the geometrical cross-section);
moreover, the greater part (84%) of absorbed neutrons causes ﬁssion (ﬁssion cross-section
is 550 b).
It is easy to calculate that for thermal neutrons the cross-section of ﬁssion of a “medium”
nucleus of natural uranium is 550 × 0.007 = 3.9 b, and the cross-section of radiation capture
is 2.8 + 100 × 0.007 = 3.5 b. We see that the store of neutrons is not very large (2.5 neutrons
are born, on the average, in each ﬁssion event, but half of these are lost); therefore, for
the realization of chain reaction it is important to decrease the loss of neutrons in the
process of their moderation. The best moderator, from the mechanical standpoint, should
be hydrogen (contained in common water molecules), since in elastic collision the greatest
energy transfer occurs in the case of equal masses of the colliding particles (see Subsection
P1.5.3). However, hydrogen atoms easily absorb neutrons (1H+n →2H+γ), and therefore,
deuterium (contained in heavy water), carbon, or beryllium are used. In order to reduce
the absorption of moderated neutrons by nuclei of 238U, the nuclear fuel, instead of being
mixed with the moderator to form a homogeneous structure, is set in layers that alternate
with layers of the moderator to form a heterogeneous structure. Getting into a moderator
layer, the neutron slows down without the risk of being absorbed, and then goes back to the
region of reaction.
Had the chain reaction been due to merely ﬁssion neutrons, such a reaction could hardly be controlled.
Indeed, the lifetime of a single generation of ﬁssion neutrons is ∼10–3 s. If the multiplication coefﬁcient
randomly increases, say, to k = 1.005, then in 1 s the number of neutrons increases 150 times, which means that
the reaction turns into explosion. The stability of controlled reactions is achieved by way of delayed neutrons
mentioned above. Even though their fraction is not great (∼0.75%), the average lifetime of their generation is
∼0.1 s, and in the above example the number of neutrons would increase only 1.5 times instead of 150.
◮Transuranic elements. The only natural ﬁssile element is 235U, but its resources are
not too great. Though reactors on fast neutrons require a substantial enrichment of uranium
(up to 15%) and are not very powerful, they can be used for a special purpose—to produce
a new type of nuclear fuel (this is why they are called breeders). Thus, radiation capture
of neutrons by 238U, which is so harmful for chain reactions, leads to the production of the
artiﬁcial transuranic element 239
94Pu:

T1/2 = 2.3 days.
Plutonium is practically stable (its half-life is 24,000 years) and is easily ﬁssionable by
neutrons with any energy. Plutonium can be more easily separated from 238U, since their
chemical properties are different.

P8.3. NUCLEAR POWER ENGINEERING
641
P8.3.2. Fusion Reactions
As mentioned above, for light nuclei, the binding energy ε increases with the growth of A
(see Fig. P8.2). Thus, reactions of fusion of two light nuclei with the formation of a heavier
nucleus (reactions of synthesis) should occur with energy release. Since the growth of ε(A)
for small A is steeper than its drop for large A, much more energy (per one nucleon) is
released in fusion than in ﬁssion.
◮Conditions of fusion.
Fusion of two nuclei is possible only if they approach one
another by a distance at which nuclear forces start to be active, which is hindered by
Coulomb repulsion. To overcome the Coulomb barrier the nuclei must have large kinetic
energies.
If the substance is heated up to a high temperature, then conditions of self-
sustained reaction may arise, and energy release will compensate its loss (for instance, by
radiation). For this reason, reactions of fusion are called thermonuclear reactions. Such
reactions are the main source of energy of the sun and other stars.
Note that the temperatures at which fusion is possible are so high that the substance
acquires the state of fully ionized plasma.
Example. Estimate the temperature at which fusion of two protons to deuteron can occur.
Solution. For this reaction to take place, the protons must approach one another by the distance equal to
two effective radii of nuclear forces r0 ∼2 × 10–15 m (see Subsection P8.1.1). From the energy conservation
law
2Ekin =
1
4πε0
e2
2r0
we ﬁnd the kinetic energy Ekin ∼0.1 MeV, and then, using the classical formula Ekin = 3
2 kBT, estimate the
temperature, T ∼109 K.
◮Thermonuclear energy of the sun and the stars. The temperature in the center of
the sun is by two orders less than the threshold value obtained above. This means that
the mean nuclear energy is insufﬁcient for fusion to take place. Still, the reaction occurs,
and the energy released by the sun is huge: ∼4 × 1026 W. The point is that, according to
the Maxwellian distribution, a ceratin (very small) part of particles possesses energy much
larger than the mean value. Moreover, due to quantum tunneling, nuclei with energies less
than the Coulomb barrier can participate in the reaction. All this means that there is only a
trace amount of colliding nuclei that react. For this reason the speciﬁc energy released by
the sun per unit time is so small, ∼10–4 W/kg, but owing to its huge mass, the total energy
release is so great.
Thermonuclear energy of the sun is released in two cycles of thermonuclear reactions:
the carbon cycle and the hydrogen cycle. Both these cycles result in the transformation of
four protons into a helium nucleus (with the emission of positrons, photons, and neutrino),
with the total energy release ∼25 MeV. The carbon cycle requires the presence of carbon
nuclei, which play the role of a catalyst, since they are restored as a result of the cycle. The
reactions of this cycle are the following:
1
1H + 12
6C →13

The second cycle contains three different reactions: the ﬁrst and the second take place twice
(altogether ﬁve reactions):

1H + 2
1H →3
2He + γ;

1H.
At temperatures up to 1.5× 107 K, the hydrogen cycle makes a larger contribution to energy
release; at higher temperatures, a larger contribution is due to the carbon cycle. For the sun,
both cycles are equally important. In less bright stars, the hydrogen cycle dominates and
in brighter stars, the carbon cycle does. For giant stars, other cycles are crucial (e.g., the
helium and neon cycles).
◮Controlled fusion.
Fusion control would give mankind a practically inexhaustible
energy source. In contrast to reactions occurring inside stars, energy should be obtained
here from a fairly small amount of nuclear fuel with maximum efﬁciency. To that end, the
substance should be heated up to a temperature at which the probability of nuclear fusion
at collisions is sufﬁciently large. Moreover, one has to ﬁnd a way to conﬁne incandescent
plasma for a sufﬁciently long time and extract the released energy, transforming it, say, to
electricity.
The major technological problem is plasma conﬁnement. In this connection, the most
promising method is to place plasma in magnetic ﬁeld of a certain structure (magnetic
trap). In a tokamak, plasma is conﬁned by magnetic ﬁeld produced by the current in the
plasma itself (the same current is ﬁrst used for heating plasma). A fairly long-time plasma
conﬁnement is hindered by various types of instabilities that arise and quickly develop in
hot plasma placed in magnetic ﬁeld.
For each reaction, there is a characteristic temperature T0 to which plasma should be
heated in order to ensure the most efﬁcient extraction of energy. The second characteristic
parameter is the minimum time τ of plasma conﬁnement necessary for energy gain (more
precisely, the product of time and plasma concentration, nτ).
Proton–proton fusion reaction fuels the sun and could be most advantageous as regards
energy release; furthermore, protons are abundant on Earth (hydrogen is contained in water).
Unfortunately, the cross-section of this reaction is so small that it cannot be considered as
a basis for controlled fusion. Equally attractive seem deuterium–deuterium reactions

1H →3
2He + n + 3.25 MeV,
2

since deuterium constitutes 0.015% of all hydrogen resources. This reaction is characterized
by the parameters T0 ≈109 K and nτ > 1022 s/m3. However, the next most promising
candidate is the deuterium–tritium reaction
2
1H + 3
1H →4
2He + n + 17.6 MeV,
which has a considerably greater power efﬁciency and better critical parameters: T0 ≈
2 × 108 K and nτ > 1020 s/m3, which compensates for the difﬁculties connected with the
production of tritium.
P8.4. Subatomic Particles
In this section, we give some brief reference information with regard to classiﬁcation of
subatomic particles, quantum numbers, conservation laws, and quark structure of hadrons.

P8.4. SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
643
P8.4.1. Classes of Subatomic Particles
In modern particle physics, two main types of subatomic particles are distinguished: ele-
mentary particles, which are not known consist of other particles, and composite particles.
Elementary particles include quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, photons, and gluons. Com-
posite subatomic particles consist of two or more elementary particles and include baryons
(e.g., protons and neutrons) and mesons.
Remark. For historical reasons, all subatomic particles are very often called elementary particles and the
structureless particles are called truly elementary particles or truly fundamental particles.
◮Fundamental interactions.
Transformations and decay of subatomic particles are
governed by the following fundamental interactions: strong, electromagnetic, and weak
(gravitational interaction is inessential here). The weaker the interaction, the slower the
associated processes. Strong interaction has the range 10–15 m and the characteristic time
of the associated processes is 10–23 s. Strong interaction binds nucleons in atomic nuclei.
Electromagnetic interaction is long-range (it has an inﬁnite range), the characteristic time
of the associated processes is not less than 10–20 s. A testing ground of this most well-
known type interaction is the control of atomic electrons, i.e., of all diversity of substances
and chemical reactions. Weak interaction has the range 10–18 m, the characteristic time of
the associated processes (involving neutrino, as a rule) is not less than 10–10 s. It is weak
interaction that controls fusion of two protons, which is crucial for energy processes in the
sun, and it also controls various types of β-decay. Weak interaction is the most universal
of the three; it is always present, but its determining character is manifested only in the
absence of the other two.
Fundamental interactions are realized by the exchange of special particles that belong to
the class of fundamental vector bosons (all these particles have unit spin). The interaction
carriers are produced by one of the interacting particles and are absorbed by the other. The
produced particles are virtual, they do not obey the relation E2 – p2c2 = m2c4, which is
allowed by the uncertainty principle ∆E∆t ∼ℏ, provided that their lifetime is small. If the
mass of the carriers differs from zero, then the interaction radius is equal to their Compton
wave-length ℏ/mc (for details, see Subsection P8.1.2). The electromagnetic interaction
carrier is a massless particle called a photon, the well-known quantum of electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Weak interaction carriers are heavy intermediate bosons W +, W – and Z, whose
masses are almost equal to 100 GeV. Strong interaction carriers are called gluons—the
quanta of the eight gluon ﬁelds that realize interaction between quarks. (In the early π-
meson theory of nuclear forces described in Subsection P8.1.2, π-mesons were regarded
as strong interaction carriers). The gluon mass is equal to zero, but in contrast to photons,
gluons interact with one another and with quarks and cannot go away farther than 10–15 m.
◮General properties of particles. We are goingtodescribe different classes of subatomic
particles. First, we list some general properties.
1. Particles can be stable (electron, proton, neutrino) or unstable. In the last case, one
indicates the particle lifetime (or width of the energy interval ∆E = ℏ/∆t), as well as decay
channels. Particles with lifetime ∼10–23 s are called resonance particles. Particles whose
lifetime is much greater than the said value are called quasi-stable.
2. Particles can be either composite (consisting of other particles; e.g., nucleons consist
of quarks) or, for presentlyaccessible energy levels, structureless (photon, electron, neutrino,
quarks).
3. A particle can be either a boson (integer spin) or fermion (half-integer spin).
4. Almost any particle has its counterpart — an antiparticle whose charges (all its
charges, not only the electric one) have opposite signs.
Thus, electron corresponds to
positron, proton to antiproton, neutron to antineutron. A particle that coincides with its
antiparticle is called truly neutral (for example, photon or π0-meson).

644
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
5. All particles are divided into strongly interacting hadrons (baryons and baryon reso-
nances, mesons and meson resonances), leptons (fermions not involved in strong interaction)
and fundamental bosons (interaction carriers).
◮Hadrons and quarks.
The term hadron refers to all particles involved in strong
interaction. Hadrons are divided into two large classes: baryons (hadrons with half-integer
spin, i.e., fermions) and mesons (hadrons with integer spin, i.e., bosons). The class of
baryons contains, in particular, nucleons, and that of mesons contains π-mesons.
Hadrons are quite numerous (more than 400 hadrons have been discovered). A sys-
tematic classiﬁcation of hadrons and understanding of many of their properties were not
possible until the appearance (in the 1960s) of the hypothesis of quark structure of hadrons,
according to which all hadrons consist of elementary particles called quarks. All quarks
have spin 1/2, and therefore, are fermions. There are six varieties of quarks (called quark
ﬂavors): u, d, s, c, b, and t (from up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top). The masses
of the quarks are: mu ≈5 MeV, md ≈7 MeV, ms ≈150 MeV, mc ≈1.3 GeV, mb ≈4.3 GeV,
and mt ≈175 GeV. The most extraordinary property of quarks is that they possess fractional
electric charges. The quarks u, c, and t are called upper quarks and their charge is equal to
+2/3; the quarks d, s, and b are called lower quarks and their charge is equal to –1/3 (in
elementary charge units).
All baryons consist of three quarks, and all mesons consist of a quark and an antiquark.
Nucleons consist of light quarks u and d: proton contains two u-quarks and one d-quark
(p = uud), neutron contains two d-quarks and one u-quark (n = ddu). These quarks also
form π-mesons: π+ = ued and π– = deu (a tilde over a quark symbol denotes the corresponding
antiquark); π0 is a quantum superposition of two states: π0 = (ueu+ded)/
√
2. We see that π+
and π– are mutual antiparticles, and π0 coincides with its antiparticle. Particles containing
an s-quark are called strange and those with a c-quark are called charmed particles.
It should be immediately observed that, at ﬁrst sight, the masses of hadrons are much
greater than the sum of the masses of their quarks. But the mass of any bound system
should be smaller than the sum of the masses of its constituents by the quantity equal to
the binding energy. The point is that the quarks in the hadrons are surrounded by a cloud
of virtual gluons, sometimes called the “gluon coat.” The masses of “coated” quarks are
about 350 MeV greater than the masses of “naked” quarks.
Baryons that contain more heavy quarks than u and d are called “hyperons.” From
quarks u, d, and s, six hyperons with spin 1/2 can be composed: Λ0 (uds, m ≈1120 MeV),
Σ+, Σ0, Σ– (uus, uds, dds, m ≈1200 MeV), Ξ0, Ξ– (uss, dss, m ≈1320 MeV). Decay of all
these hyperons is determined by weak interaction, and therefore, their lifetime is τ ∼10–10 s
(except for the Σ0-hyperon whose decay is determined by electromagnetic interaction, its
lifetime is τ ∼10–20 s). Together with proton and neutron, these hyperons form an octet of
baryons with spin 1/2. (The difference between Λ0 and Σ0 is explained below.)
Next, we have the decuplet of baryons with spin 3/2, among which there are baryons
consisting of three identical quarks, for example, ∆–, ∆0, ∆+, ∆++ (ddd, udd, uud, uuu,
m ≈1230 MeV). The heaviest in the decuplet is the Ω–-hyperon (sss, m ≈1670 MeV).
Note that subatomic particles consisting of the same quarks and differing only in spin (or
other quantum numbers) often bear different names (e.g., neutron and ∆0-hyperon).
Further, we brieﬂy describe mesons. In addition to the three π-mesons, there are six
mesons having zero spin and orbital momentum and containing an s-quark: the four K+,
K0, eK0, K– (ues, des, sed, seu, m ≈500 MeV) and two truly neutral mesons η and η′ (different
quantum superpositions of the states ueu, ded and ses). Next, we have nine mesons with spin
S = 1, among which there are three ρ, four K∗, ω0, and ϕ0. All these mesons (as well as
η′) are of resonance type τ ∼10–23 s).

An important event of 1974 was the discovery of the ﬁrst charmed particle, J/ψ-meson
(m = 3.1 GeV); this particle represents one of the states of charmonium cec (charmonium
has “hidden charm”). Thereafter, other charmed mesons were found (for example, D+ = ced,
D0 = ceu, and D+
s = ces) and charmed baryons (for example, Λ+
c = udc), and also more heavy
“beauty” hadrons containing a b-quark.
◮Quark color and gluons. The existence of baryons consisting of three identical quarks
is in contradiction with the Pauli principle, since two of them must have the same spin
direction. Moreover, the Ω–-hyperon has spin 3/2; i.e., all its three s-quarks can be in the
same state (when the hyperon spin projection is maximum). How can this be explained? It
turned out that there are three quarks with the same ﬂavor and not just a single such quark.
The distinction between these is described by an additional quantum number that can take
three values. It was proposed to use the term color for that number (or color charge) and
ascribe to it three values: R (red), G (green), and B (blue). Accordingly, the colors of
antiquarks are denoted by eR, eG, eB (anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue). Thus, there are
altogether 18 quarks and 18 antiquarks. The mixture of the three colors is regarded as
colorless (white). A quark–antiquark pair possesses a “hidden” color.
The color charges of quarks are sources of gluon ﬁelds (just as the electric charge
is the source of electromagnetic ﬁeld). The quanta of these ﬁelds, called gluons (from
“glue”), realize strong interaction. (Electromagnetic interaction is realized by the exchange
of photons, i.e., quanta of electromagnetic ﬁeld.) Both gluons and photons are massless
particles with spin 1 and negative parity (see below). Photons, however, are electrically
neutral, while gluons are “colored”; i.e., take part in strong interactions. Each gluon carries
two color charges: one color and one anti-color. There are eight different gluons: six with
explicit color, (gRe
G, gRe
B, gGeR, gGe
B, gBeR, gBe
G) and two with hidden color.
According to the color charge conservation law, a quark must change its color, when
emitting or absorbing a gluon. Thus, when a red R-quark emits a gluon ReG, it becomes a
G-quark, but its ﬂavor does not change:
uR →uG + gRe
G.
(Quark ﬂavor can change only in weak interactions; i.e., when W- or Z-bosons are emitted.)
Since gluons possess color charges, they can emit and absorb gluons and be involved in
mutual strong interaction. Strong interaction, regarded as a result of emission and absorption
of gluons by quarks and gluons, is studied by quantum chromodynamics (by analogy with
quantum electrodynamics, which studies electromagnetic interaction as a result exchange
of photons). One of the basic statements of quantum chromodynamics is the nonexistence
of free colored objects. Free existence is allowed only for such color charge combinations
that carry no color charge as a whole. For example, free hadrons can only exist in the
“white” state, its three quarks being of different colors at each time instant. (Still, each
quark continuously changes its color, emitting or absorbing virtual gluons that have been
either emitted by another quark or produced in its “gluon coat”—cloud of virtual gluons.
But the total color charge of the hadron remains white.) The same principle applies to
mesons. For example, π+-meson is a quantum superposition of three color states: uRedeR,
uGedeG, uBede
B. Each of these states has a hidden color, but their superposition is “white.”
◮Conﬁnement. Why is it impossible to divide a white object into two colored ones (for
instance, to remove one quark from a meson or hadron)? First of all, the exchange of colored
gluons leads to an interaction whose potential grows with the distance not slower than the
linear function (the interaction force does not decrease). A possible explanation is that the
gluon ﬁeld is not scattered in all directions (this would correspond to the Coulomb potential),

646
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
but is concentrated in a narrow “pipe” (string) joining the quarks. Therefore, inﬁnite energy
would be required to split the quarks. In fact, as the quarks are separated from one another
by a distance greater than 10–15 m, the gluon string is “broken,” a pair quark–antiquark
is produced, and the removed quark turns into a white meson. Attempting to obtain two
colored objects, we again obtain two white objects. (Note that for large energies of scattered
quarks, each of these transforms not into a single meson but into several hadrons, and the
so-called “hadron jet” is produced. Observation of hadron jets was an important evidence
supporting the existence of quarks.) In this way, quantum chromodynamics explains the
failure of all attempts to detect free quarks or knock them out of hadrons, in spite of the fact
that the existence of quarks within hadrons was conﬁrmed by experiments with scattering of
high energy electrons on hadrons. This behavior of quarks is referred to as “conﬁnement.”
◮Leptons. Leptons are fermions that do not participate in strong interactions. There are
three pairs of leptons: electron e– and electron-type neutrino νe, muon µ– and muon-type
neutrino νµ, tau-lepton τ – and tau-neutrino ντ. The spin of all leptons is equal to 1/2. Each
charged lepton has its antiparticle: e+, µ+ and τ +. There is no ﬁnal answer to the question
whether neutrinos are truly neutral particles or have antiparticles—antineutrinos, eνe, eνµ
and eντ. Leptons are fundamental particles—no structure has been detected in them. As
shown by experiments, each charged lepton takes part in weak interactions coupled to its
neutrino, for example:
n →pe–eνe,
π+ →µ+νµ,
τ + →eντe+νe.
The masses of muon and tau-lepton are respectively equal to 106 MeV and 1784 MeV.
These particles are unstable: muon decays along the channel µ– →e–eνeνµ, its lifetime is
2 × 10–6 s; the heavier tau-lepton decays along many channels, its lifetime is 5 × 10–13 s.
For the neutrino masses, upper bounds can be given: mνe < 30 eV, mνµ < 0.5 MeV, and
mντ < 150 MeV.
◮Fundamental fermions. Six leptons and six quarks form the class of fundamental
fermions of which all other subatomic particles are “made.” A special role is played by
the “ﬁrst generation” of fundamental fermions u, d, νe, e–, which compose nucleons and
atoms and determine almost all processes observed in nature. The “second generation” of
fundamental fermions (c, s, νµ, µ–) and their “third generation” (t, d, ντ, τ –) are artiﬁcially
obtained in powerful accelerators.
However, only the investigation of all fundamental
particles in their entirety may lead to the understanding of the structure and the evolution
of our universe.
All processes in the world of subatomic particles amount to interactions between funda-
mental fermions realized by their exchanging several fundamental vector bosons (photons,
gluons, three intermediate bosons). All these processes are governed by conservation laws.
Recall that the electromagnetic interaction carrier—photon—canbe emitted or absorbed
only by charged particles, and in this process neither the charge, nor the color, nor the ﬂavor
of the particle can change. The carriers of strong interaction—gluons—can be emitted or
absorbed by quarks or gluons, and in this process the quark may change its color, but its
charge and its ﬂavor remain the same.
Weak interactions are realized in terms of emission and absorption of intermediate vector
bosons W +, W –, and Z0. As a charged boson is emitted or absorbed by a charged lepton,
the latter transforms into the corresponding neutrino (and vice versa, a neutrino transforms
into the corresponding charged lepton). The universal character of weak interactions is
manifested in that vector bosons are emitted and absorbed not only by leptons, but also by
quarks. (Note that in contrast to gluons, intermediate bosons have no color, i.e., take no
part in strong interactions.) After emitting or absorbing a charged boson, the upper quark

P8.4. SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
647
turns into the lower one and vice versa. It is essential that any upper quark (u, c, t) can
transform into any lower quark (d, s, b).
For example, neutron decay n →pe–eνe amounts to d-quark decay d →ue–eνe, which is
described as the transformation of the d-quark into an u-quark with emission of a W +-boson,
which then turns into the pair e–eνe.
An important event in particle physics was the discovery in 1974 of intermediate bosons, whose existence
and properties had been predicted by the so-called “standard theory of electroweak interaction” of Glashow,
Weinberg, and Salam. The discovery was made in specially constructed proton–antiproton colliders (colliding
beam accelerators). Upon collision, one quark and one antiquark turned into an intermediate boson, and the
remaining two quarks of each particle turned into powerful hadron jets. In time ∼10–25 s, the produced boson
either decayed to quark + antiquark or to two leptons (e.g., electron + antineutrino). It was possible to detect
the electrons produced in the W –-boson decay (only those processes were chosen in which the momentum
conservation law was violated by the value of the momentum carried away by neutrino, which is equal to the
electron momentum). To give an idea of the complexity of the events, it can be mentioned that in the ﬁrst series
of experiments, six reliable events were chosen out of one billion.
P8.4.2. Characteristics of Particles
◮Particle characteristics and conservation laws. All particle characteristics can be
divided into two groups: geometrical characteristics connected with space-time properties
(mass, spin, spatial parity) and internal quantum numbers reﬂecting the symmetry of fun-
damental interactions (charge, baryon charge, lepton charge, isospin, strangeness, charm,
and some others).
Each of these characteristics is associated with some conservation law and it makes
sense to discuss them jointly. Some conservation laws are regarded as absolutely precise,
others are approximate, i.e., valid for a certain class of reactions.
Some approximate
conservation laws are violated only by weak interactions (in processes determined by
weak interactions), others are violated by both weak and electromagnetic interactions.
Conservation laws allow us to predict the possibility or the impossibility of decay processes
and reactions, understand the corresponding time lengths, predict the existence of new
particles and describe the conditions of their birth. Recall the principle adopted in quantum
theory, “what is not forbidden is possible,” which makes the application of conservation
laws especially effective.
◮Particle mass and law of conservation of energy-momentum. Particle mass m is its
most important characteristic. All subatomic particles have different masses. The Einstein
formula relates the mass of a particle to its energy at rest.
The laws of conservation of mass and linear momentum follow from the homogeneity
of time and space. These laws are crucial in the examination of reactions. The law of
conservation of energy implies, in particular, that decay of an unstable particle can proceed
only along such channels in which the sum of the masses of the produced particles is less
than the mass of the original particle. Another example: the momentum conservation law
forbids annihilation of an electron–positron pair with the emission of one γ-quantum (in
center-of-mass frame the pair momentum is zero). The laws of conservation of energy and
momentum can be used to calculate the threshold of any reaction (not forbidden by other
conservation laws). Such calculations were carried out in Subsection P8.2.2; see formulas
(P8.2.2.13)–(P8.2.2.15).
◮Particle spin I and angular momentum conservation law. The spin of a particle
determines whether the particle is subject to the Fermi–Dirac statistics (half-integer spin)
or the Bose–Einstein statistics (integer spin). The spin of a hadron adds up from spins and
orbital angular momenta of its constituent quarks. The spin of a particle determines the
unique selected direction in a reference frame in which it is at rest.

648
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
The law of conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of the isotropy of space.
The application of this law to the analysis of reactions is hindered by the fact that spins
are added up by the rule of addition of angular momenta. For example, the total angular
momentum of a system of two particles with spin 1 may be zero. However, it is easy to
ﬁnd out whether the total spin is integer or half-integer. This result often sufﬁces for estab-
lishing the impossibility of some reaction. Thus, neutrinoless decay of a neutron into two
particles—proton and electron—is forbidden by the angular momentum conservation law.
◮Parity. Parity P of a particle (more precisely, its spatial parity) is a purely quantum
notion. It indicates the behavior of the particle wave function under spatial inversion, i.e.,
the transformation of coordinates x →–x, y →–y, and z →–z. There are two alternatives:
the wave function does not change (positive parity, P = +1); the wave function changes its
sign (negative parity, P = –1). Parity is an internal characteristic of a particle (just as spin,
charge, etc.) Electron, proton, and neutron have parity P = 1, while photon and π-mesons
have parity P = –1. Parity of any quark is equal to +1, and that of antiquark is –1. Parity
of a compound particle (in the state with zero orbital angular momentum) is equal to the
product of parities of its constituent particles.
For a long time, it was assumed that spatial parity is preserved in all reactions. The
point is that the parity conservation law is a consequence of the statement that claims
the invariance of processes with respect to spatial inversion or, equivalently, with respect
to mirror reﬂection, since inversion reduces to a reﬂection and a rotation (for instance,
reﬂection with respect to the plane XY and rotation by the angle 180◦with respect to the
axis Z). It was considered evident that all processes in the common and the “mirror” world
should obey the same physical laws. However, later it was found that this statement is
incorrect for processes determined by weak interactions. Violation of parity was predicted
by Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang in 1956, and shortly conﬁrmed experimentally
by Chien-Shiung Wu. As shown by these experiments, the electrons emitted in β-decay
mostly move in the direction opposite to that of nuclear spin. Since nuclear spin changes its
direction under reﬂection, electrons are emitted mostly in the direction of spin in the mirror
world.
In the same experiment, one observed violation of another symmetry, the so-called
charge symmetry or C-symmetry, when all particles are replaced by the corresponding
antiparticles. It turned out that in the “antiworld,” positrons would be emitted mostly in the
direction of spin. However, under both transformations (i.e., spatial reﬂection together with
the replacement of particles by their antiparticles), the process again transforms into itself.
For some time it was assumed that this “combined” CP-symmetry is absolutely precise.
But later weak processes were discovered for which the CP-symmetry is violated. At
present, only one symmetry is accepted as absolutely precise—the CPT-symmetry, where
the above two transformations are supplemented with time reﬂection. This symmetry is
sufﬁcient for proving that a particle and its antiparticle have equal masses and lifetimes.
◮Lepton charges Le, Lµ, and Lτ. Experiments show that in any processes the differ-
ence between the number of leptons and that of antileptons of a given type is preserved.
Accordingly, three types of lepton charges have been introduced: Le, Lµ, and Lτ. For e
and νe, it is assumed that Le = 1, for their antiparticles, Le = –1, and for all other particles,
Le = 0. In the same way, the other charges are treated.
Lepton charges are preserved in all processes (for energies accessible at present).
The remaining conservation laws pertain to the world of hadrons.
These laws are
introduced empirically and can be naturally accounted for in the framework of the quark
model.
◮Baryon charge B. As shown by experiments, the difference between the number of
baryons and that of antibaryons is preserved in all processes (for energies accessible at

P8.4. SUBATOMIC PARTICLES
649
present). Accordingly, each baryon is ascribed baryon charge B = 1; for any antibaryon,
B = –1, and for any meson B = 0.
If all quarks are ascribed charge B = 1/3 (and one takes B = –1/3 for antiquarks), then
the baryon charge conservation law reduces to the preservation of the number of quarks
(more precisely, the difference between the number of quarks and that of antiquarks).
◮Strangeness. When ﬁrst hyperons were discovered, some strange properties of their
behavior were noticed. First, it was found that although hyperon emission occurred in high
energy nucleon collisions (i.e., with strong interactions involved), their decay time was
∼10–10 s, which corresponds to weak interactions. The second strange property was that
a hyperon could never be born alone. Thus, in proton collision, a Λ0-hyperon is born only
together with a K+-meson or Σ+-hyperon, but never with K–-meson or Σ–-hyperon.
In order to explain these features, particles were ascribed a new quantum number,
strangeness S, which is preserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions and may
change by ±1 in weak interactions. To account for experimental data, the particles Λ0,
Σ0, Σ– and K– were ascribed strangeness S = –1, Ξ-hyperons strangeness S = –2, and
Ω–-hyperon strangeness S = –3.
In the quark model of hadrons, the adopted carrier of strangeness is the ﬂavor quark s
(for this one takes S = –1, and for all other quarks, S = 0). The slow rate of decay processes
connected with variation of strangeness is explained by that quark ﬂavor change s →u may
occur only in weak interactions with emission of a W –-boson or absorption of a W +-boson.
◮Charm C, beauty b, and truth t. In exactly the same way, one introduces the quantum
numbers of charm C (the c-quark is ascribed C = 1) and beauty b (the b-quark is ascribed
b = 1). The last and the heaviest quark, the t-quark, corresponds to the quantum number t,
truth. Just as in the case of strangeness, the quantum numbers C, b, and t are preserved in
strong reactions, but may change in weak reactions.
◮Isotopic spin T. Isotopic spin was introduced in nuclear physics and played an important
role in the classiﬁcation of the ground and the excited nuclear states. The introduction of
this unusual quantum number, which has no analogue in the classical physics, reﬂects the
assumption of charge independence of nuclear forces, i.e., the identical coincidence of these
forces in the pairs n-n, n-p, p-p in the same spatial and spin states. To describe charge
independence, one introduces the isotopic spin vector T: its magnitude for both nucleons is
equal to T = 1/2, and its projections are Tz = 1/2 for proton and Tz = –1/2 for neutron. Thus,
the two nucleons form an isotopic doublet. Nuclear interaction is assumed independent
of the “direction” of the vector T, i.e., in the absence of electromagnetic interaction, the
isotopic spin space is isotropic (properties of the system do not change under rotations of
the vector T).
Summation of isotopic spins in a system of several nucleons is carried out by the same
rules as that of angular momenta. Nuclei with the same number of nucleons (isobars) and
the same values of T form a nuclear multiplet of 2T + 1 nuclei (with different Tz, i.e.,
different charges), whose members have close properties. For example, the nuclei 10
6C, 10
5B
(in excited state), and 10
4Be form an isotopic triplet with T = 1, and 4
2He is an isotopic singlet
(T = 0). A nucleus in its ground state has the minimum possible value of T for a given
projection Tz (calculated from its composition); for example, the ground state of 10
5B has
T = 0.
Isotopic spin plays an important role in the world of subatomic particles, in particular,
for the classiﬁcation of hadrons. Baryons and mesons are split into multiplets with close
properties, and the number of particles in a multiplet is 2T + 1. Thus, three π-mesons form
a triplet with T = 1; K0- and K+-mesons form a doublet with T = 1/2; three Σ-hyperons
form a triplet with T = 1; four ∆-hyperons have T = 3/2; the Λ0-hyperon constitutes a
singlet with T = 0. The members of a multiplet differ by their isotopic spin projections Tz.

650
ELEMENTS OF NUCLEAR PHYSICS
In the quark model, the presence of multiplets is explained by the fact that the u- and d-
quarks have close masses and differ only by their charges. These quarks are ascribed the
value T = 1/2; for the u-quark, one takes Tz = 1/2, and for the d-quark Tz = –1/2. For
the other quarks, one takes T = 0. Isotopic spin of hadrons is calculated by the summation
rule for angular momenta.
Thus, the doublet of K-mesons has quark composition ues
and des.
Summation of two isotopic spins 1/2 can result in either T = 0 (Tz = 0) or
T = 1 (Tz = –1, Tz = 0, or Tz = 1). The ﬁrst state corresponds to a hyperon, Λ0 = uds
(isotopic singlet), and an isotopic triplet is formed by the hyperons Σ– = dds, Σ0 = uds,
and Σ+ = uus.
In reactions determined by strong interactions, one observes the isotopic spin conser-
vation law: the quantities T and Tz are preserved. Electromagnetic and weak interactions
violate the conservation law for T, but Tz is preserved in electromagnetic interactions and
may change only in weak interactions. The point is that Tz can change only if a u-or a
d-quark transform into another quark, which is possible only in weak interactions (when a
charged W-boson is absorbed or emitted).
P8.4.3. Interaction Uniﬁcation
◮Electroweak interaction.
In the standard theory of electroweak interaction, both
interactions, the weak and the electromagnetic, together with their vector bosons, ap-
pear in the framework of a uniﬁed approach. As the original particles (also called seed
particles) supposed to realize the uniﬁed electroweak interaction one adopts four vec-
tor massless particles, two neutral particles, and two charged ones.
In the real world,
the symmetry between these particles becomes spontaneously broken and three of them
acquire mass (intermediate bosons), and one particle remains massless (photon). Many
conclusions of the theory (in particular, mass values obtained for intermediate bosons)
have had experimental support. The value of the constant of weak interaction happens
to be greater than that of electromagnetic interaction, and the slow rate of weak pro-
cesses (compared with electromagnetic processes) is due to the large mass of W- and
Z-bosons (∼100 GeV). For energies much larger than these masses, the symmetry is
restored (masses can be neglected), and the uniﬁed symmetric electroweak interaction
becomes active.
◮Grand uniﬁcation.
The brilliant success of the theory of electroweak interactions
opened the way to the creation of new theories that allow for the uniﬁcation of the three
fundamental interactions—strong, weak, and electromagnetic. These theories were called
the “Grand Uniﬁcation.” The boundary energy for this uniﬁcation is unimaginable, E ∼
1015 GeV. At this energy, the constants of the three interactions become equal. For larger
energies, the three interactions come forth together as a universal symmetric interaction.
The carriers of this interaction are 24 vector bosons: eight gluons, three intermediate bosons,
photon, and superheavy X- and Y -bosons with masses ∼1015 GeV. These bosons carry
both an electric charge (4/3 for X and 1/3 for Y ) and a color charge (taking into account
three colors and antiparticles, we have 12 particles). Upon emission or absorption of an X-
or a Y -boson, a quark may turn into a lepton and vice versa. Therefore, participation of
these bosons in interactions leads to a violation of the laws of conservation of baryon and
lepton charges (the electric charge conservation law remains unquestionable). As a result,
there is a very small probability (because of the great masses of X and Y ) of proton decay
into a positron and several π-mesons. The proton lifetime predicted by the theory lies in
the interval τ ∼1030–1035 years. Current attempts to detect proton decay (in great masses
of water placed in deep mines for the exclusion of background noise) give the estimate
τ > 1032 years.

Dimensions and Similarity
E1.1. Dimensions
E1.1.1. Basic and Derived Units of Measurement. Systems of Units
of Measurement
◮Basic and derived units of measurement. Mechanical, physical, and physicochemical
quantities are characterized by numbers that are determined by direct or indirect comparison
with the accepted units of measurement. The units of measurement are divided into the
basic and derived units of measurement. The basic units of measurement are deﬁned as
artiﬁcial and/or natural standards that are chosen from convenience considerations (i.e.,
rather arbitrarily). The derived units of measurement can be obtained from the basic units
in the following two ways:
(i) starting from the deﬁnition of the corresponding physical quantity, which prompts the
method for its (direct or mental) measurement, or
(ii) by a direct use of formulas relating different quantities by some quantitative relations.
Example 1. The velocity (in uniform motion), by deﬁnition, is the ratio of the distance passed in a certain
time interval to the value of this time interval. Therefore, in this case, for the unit of velocity it is convenient
to take the ratio of the length unit to the time unit.
◮Systems of units of measurement and classes of systems of units of measurement.
A system of units of measurement is a set of basic units of measurement that are sufﬁcient
to measure numerical characteristics of the class of phenomena under study.
To describe mechanical quantities, it sufﬁces to introduce three independent basic units
of measurement, namely, units of mass, length, and time.
Example 2. Nowadays, the most widely used system is the system of units of measurement named the
International System of Units (SI), where the unit of mass is 1 kilogram (kg), i.e., the mass of some specially
manufactured and thoroughly preserved standard, the unit of length is 1 meter (m), i.e., the length of another
standard, and the unit of time is 1 second (s), i.e., the 1/86400 fraction of the mean solar day. (There is also a
more precise deﬁnition of the second.)
A class of systems of units of measurement is a set of systems of units of measurement
that differ from one another only in the value of the basic units of measurement.
Example 3. The SI system mentioned in Example 2 belongs to the class of systems of units of measurement
denoted by MLT (mass — length — time). The MLT class contains the sometimes used CGS system, where
the unit of mass is 1 gram (g) = 0.001 kg (one thousandth of the kilogram), the unit of length is 1 centimeter
(cm) = 0.01 m (one hundredth of the metre), and the unit of time is 1 s.
E1.1.2. Dimensional and Dimensionless Quantities. Dimensional
Formula
◮Dimensional and dimensionless quantities. In any practical calculations and in the
processing of experimental data whose results are represented as sets of numbers character-
izing the properties of phenomena and processes, two types of quantities are encountered.
655

656
DIMENSIONS AND SIMILARITY
The quantities whose numerical value depends on the system of units of measurement used
within a given class of systems of units of measurement are called dimensional. The quan-
tities whose numerical values are independent of the system of units of measurement used
within a given class are called dimensionless.
◮Dimensional formula. Dimensions of mechanical quantities. The dimension of a
physical quantity (in other words, the dimensional formula) is a function determining by
how many times the numerical value of this quantity varies when passing from the original
system of units of measurement to another system contained in the given class.
In a
dimensional formula, the symbol of unit length is used to be denoted by L, of unit mass,
by M, and of unit time, by T; the dimension of any derived quantity A is denoted by the
symbol [A]. The dimension of a dimensionless quantity is equal to 1.
Example. If the length unit is decreased by a factor of L and the time unit is decreased by a factor of T,
then the numerical value of any measured acceleration changes by a factor of LT –2. Thus, for the dimension
of acceleration in the class of MLT systems, we have
[a] = LT–2.
Similarly, the dimension of force in the MLT class is determined by the formula: [F] = MLT–2. (This formula
can also be obtained from Newton’s second law ma = F.)
Table E1.1 presents the dimensions of basic mechanical quantities in the class of MLT
systems.
One can see that for all mechanical quantities given in Table E1.1, the dimension is a
power monomial of the form
[A] = LαMβTγ,
(E1.1.2.1)
where α, β, and γ are some constants.
One can prove the following more general statement: the dimension is always a power
monomial. Such a simple structure of a dimensional formula is necessarily determined by
the following physical condition: the ratio of two numerical values of any derived quantity
must be independent of the choice of scales for the basic units of measurement.
◮Properties of dimensions.
1. The dimension of a physical quantity does not vary if it is multiplied by a dimensionless
quantity.
2. The dimension of the product of physical quantities is equal to the product of dimensions
of these quantities:
[A1A2 . . . Am] = [A1][A2] . . . [Am].
3. The exponent can be brought outside the symbol of dimension:
[Ap] = [A]p.
4. The physical quantities can be added (subtracted) only if they have equal dimensions.
5. The exponents contained in the right-hand sides of dimension formulas like (E1.1.2.1)
are rational numbers (i.e., they can be represented as the fractions p/q, where p and q
are integers).
E1.2. The π-Theorem and Its Practical Use
E1.2.1. The π-Theorem
◮Passing from dimensional quantities to dimensionless quantities. The π-theorem.
Assume that there is a functional dependence between dimensional physical quantities,
f(A1, . . . , Ak, Ak+1, . . . , An) = 0.

(In the process under study, some of these quantities can be variable, and the other, constant;
moreover, here we do not distinguish between dependent and independent variables.) Let
A1, . . . , Ak (k ≤n–1) be dimensional quantities of independent dimensions (these quantities
are called constitutive parameters), and suppose that the dimensions of the other quantities

658
DIMENSIONS AND SIMILARITY
can be expressed via the dimensions of the constitutive parameters:
[Ak+1] = [A1]m1 k+1[A2]m2 k+1 . . . [Ak]mk k+1,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,
[An] = [A1]m1 n[A2]m2 n . . . [Ak]mk n,
(E1.2.1.2)
where the mi j are constants. Set

. . . ,
Πn–k =

. . . Amk n

.
(E1.2.1.3)
It follows from relations (E1.2.1.2) that the quantities Π1, Π2, . . . , Πn–k are dimension-
less. Each of the dimensionless quantities Πi has the form of a power monomial consisting
of ≤k + 1 dimensional quantities. (The inequality takes into account the fact that some of
the exponents mi j can be zero.)
THE π-THEOREM.
The original relation (E1.2.1.1) among n dimensional physical
quantities can be represented as a relation among n–k dimensionless quantities (E1.2.1.3),
F(Π1, Π2, . . . , Πn–k) = 0.
(E1.2.1.4)
It follows from the above that every physical relation between dimensional quantities
can be reformulated as a relation between fewer dimensionless quantities. This important
fact is a source of useful applications of the π-theorem for the analysis of various phenomena
and processes. In particular, for k = n – 1, the same n dimensional parameters can form
only a single dimensionless combination, and hence, by the π-theorem, the initial functional
dependence can be represented in the following simple form:
Am1
1 Am2
2
. . . Amn
n
= const.
(E1.2.1.5)
Here the exponents m1, m2, · · · , mn can readily be determined by dimensional formulas,
where it is taken into account that the left-hand side of (E1.2.1.5) is a dimensionless complex
and the unknown dimensionless constant on the right-hand side in (E1.2.1.5) can be found
either experimentally or theoretically by solving the corresponding mathematical problem
(see examples in Section E1.2.2 below).
Remark 1. Without loss of generality, one can assume that one of the exponents mi in (E1.2.1.5) is equal
to 1 (in particular, if m1 ≠0, then one can set m1 = 1).
Remark 2. If Π1, Π2, . . . , Πs are dimensionless quantities, then the complex Π = Πβ1
1 Πβ2
2 . . . Πβs
s , where
β1, β2, . . . , βs are arbitrary constants, is also a dimensionless quantity. This allows one to compose new n – k
functionally independent dimensionless quantities from the dimensionless quantities (E1.2.1.3) and write out
a relation of the form (E1.2.1.4) for them. A successful choice of the form of the dimensionless parameters
permits reducing the number of experiments and simplifying their analysis.
◮Experimental data must be processed in dimensionless variables. The π-theorem
leads to a very important conclusion that experimental data must be processed in dimen-
sionless variables, thus reducing the number of measured and varied quantities.
In practical experiments, it is usually assumed that establishing the dependence of a
quantity on some constitutive parameter (argument) means measuring this quantity for at
least 10 values of the given argument (of course, the number 10 is here taken at random).
Thus, to experimentally determine the quantity A as a function of n constitutive parameters
A1, . . . , An , one must perform 10n experiments. But, using the π-theorem, one can reduce
the problem to determining a function of n – k dimensionless arguments Π1, . . . , Πn–k;
to this end, one must perform 10n–k experiments, i.e., 10k times fewer. In other words,
the labouriousness of determining the desired function is reduced by as many orders of
magnitude as the number of quantities of independent dimensions contained in the set of
constitutive parameters.

E1.2. THE π-THEOREM AND ITS PRACTICAL USE
659
E1.2.2. Simplest Examples of the Use of the π-Theorem
In what follows, all dimensions of constitutive parameters are written in the class of MLT
systems of units of measurement.
◮The Pythagorean theorem.
Let us describe an amusing version of proving the
Pythagorean theorem by analyzing the dimensions.
The area S of a rectangular triangle is determined by the length c of the hypotenuse and,
for example, the smaller of the acute angles, β. Using the three quantities S, c, and β whose
dimensions have the form [S] = L2, [c] = L, and [β] = 1 (the angle β is a dimensionless
quantity), one can compose two dimensionless combinations:
Π1 = S/c2,
Π2 = β.
(E1.2.2.1)
We set n = 3 and k = 1 in formula (E1.2.1.4) and take the explicit form of the dimensionless
complexes (E1.2.2.1) into account. We have F(S/c2, β) = 0. Resolving the dependence
thus obtained for the ﬁrst argument, we obtain
S = c2Φ(β),
where Φ(β) is a function. (The explicit form of this function is not required in the following.)
a
b
с
β
β
Figure E1.1. A right triangle.
The height perpendicular to the hypotenuse (see Fig. E1.1) divides the main triangle
into two right triangles similar to it whose hypotenuses are the corresponding legs a and b
of the original triangle. The areas of the new triangles are Sa = a2Φ(β) and Sb = b2Φ(β),
respectively, where Φ(β) is the same function as above. Since the sum of Sa and Sb is the
area of the original triangle, S = Sa +Sb, we have c2Φ(β) = a2Φ(β)+b2Φ(β). By canceling
Φ(β), we obtain
c2 = a2 + b2,
as desired.
◮Shock wave front propagation in nuclear explosion. In nuclear explosion, consider-
able energy E0 is released very rapidly (we assume that it is released instantaneously) in a
rather small area (which is approximately assumed to be a point). A powerful shock wave
propagates from the explosion center, and the pressure behind it initially equals hundreds of
thousands of atmospheres. This pressure is much larger than the initial air pressure, whose
inﬂuence can be neglected at the ﬁrst stage of the explosion. Thus, after the time interval t,
the shock wave front radius rf depends on E0, t, and the initial air density ρ0.
This problem contains four dimensional quantities rf, E0, t, and ρ0, which have the
following dimensions:
[rf] = L,
[E0] = ML2T–2,
[t] = T,
[ρ0] = ML–3.
(E1.2.2.2)
In the set of these four quantities, one can choose three quantities with independent dimen-
sions, which corresponds to k = 3 and n = 4 in the statement of the π-theorem. Therefore,

660
DIMENSIONS AND SIMILARITY
we have k +1 = n and can form a single dimensionless complex of the quantities (E1.2.2.2),
and the desired functional dependence can be represented by analogy with (E1.2.1.5) as
rfEm2
0 tm3ρm4
0
= C = const,
(E1.2.2.3)
where, without loss of generality, the ﬁrst exponent m1 was set equal to 1. The exponents
m2, m3, and m4 are determined by the condition that the dimension of the left-hand side of
(E1.2.2.3) should be equal to 1 (because the right-hand side is a dimensionless constant).
Therefore, we obtain the chain of relations
[rfEm2
0 tm3ρm4
0 ] = [rf][E0]m2[t]m3[ρ0]m4 = L[ML2T –2]m2T m3[ML–3]m4
= Mm2+m4L2m2–3m4+1T –2m2+m3 = 1.
For the last relation to be satisﬁed, it is necessary that all exponents be zero:
m2 + m4 = 0,
2m2 – 3m4 + 1 = 0,
–2m2 + m3 = 0.
The solution of this linear system of algebraic equations has the form
m2 = – 1
5 ,
m3 = – 2
5 ,
m4 = 1
5 .
(E1.2.2.4)
Substituting the exponents (E1.2.2.4) into (E1.2.2.3) and solving the resulting relation for rf ,
we obtain the shock wave propagation law
rf = C
 E0t2
ρ0
1/5
.
(E1.2.2.5)
If the quantities E0 and ρ0 are known, then to ﬁnd the constant C in formula (E1.2.2.5)
it sufﬁces to know the shock wave front radius rf for a single value t = t1 of the time
interval. A more detailed study (beyond the framework of the theory of dimensions) shows
that C ≈1.
From formula (E1.2.2.5), one can obtain the time dependence of the shock wave front
radius:
rf = rf1
 t/t1
2/5,
where rf1 = rf|t=t1.
◮Pendulum oscillations in the ﬁeld of gravity forces. We consider a mathematical
pendulum, which is a heavy material point of mass m suspended on a weightless unstretch-
able string of length l; it is assumed that the other end of the string is rigidly ﬁxed. We
are interested in the oscillation period Tp of the pendulum that makes an angle ϕ0 with
the vertical axis at the initial time instant. (The weight velocity is zero at the initial time
instant.)
This problem is characterized by the ﬁve quantities m, l, Tp, ϕ0, and g (g is the
acceleration due to gravity), which have the dimensions
[m] = M,
[l] = L,
[Tp] = T,
[ϕ0] = 1,
[g] = LT–2;
(E1.2.2.6)
three of these quantities have independent dimensions. Thus, in this case we have n = 5 and
k = 3, and one can compose two dimensionless complexes of these quantities (E1.2.2.6):
Π1 = ϕ0,
Π2 = Tp
q
g/l.
(E1.2.2.7)

E1.2. THE π-THEOREM AND ITS PRACTICAL USE
661
Therefore, by the π-theorem, we have the dependence F(ϕ0, Tp
p
g/l ) = 0. By solving it
for the oscillation period Tp, we obtain
Tp = f1(ϕ0)
q
l/g .
(E1.2.2.8)
where f1(ϕ0) is a function.
It is important to note that the dimensionless parameters (E1.2.2.7) are independent
of the load mass m. Therefore, the oscillation period (E1.2.2.8) is independent of the
pendulum mass.
The function f1(ϕ) can be determined both theoretically and experimentally.
Assuming that the function f1(ϕ) can be expanded in a Taylor series for small ϕ, we
have
f1(ϕ0) = a + bϕ0 + cϕ2
0 + · · · .
Assume that a ≠0. Then, for small pendulum oscillations, by retaining only the leading
term of the expansion in (E1.2.2.8), we obtain the simple formula
Tp = a
q
l/g,
(E1.2.2.9)
where a is a constant.
Thus, for small pendulum oscillations, we can use the theory of dimensions to obtain
formula (E1.2.2.9) for the oscillation period up to a constant factor. A theoretical analysis
(independent of the theory of dimensions) permits ﬁnding the unknown constant a = 2π.
◮Interphase transport. When describing the interphase transport in gas–liquid systems,
the Higbie–Danckwerts surface renewal model has been widely used. According to this
model, turbulent pulsations with frequency ω = 1/tω in the liquid phase constantly renew
the interphase surface. The contact time tω is determined experimentally. The diffusion
ﬂow J through an element of the renewed surface is assumed to be purely molecular. It
depends on the molecular diffusion coefﬁcient D of the gas dissolved in the liquid. The
mass transfer coefﬁcient is deﬁned as follows:
k =
J
S(Cs – C∞) ,
where S is the interphase surface area, C∞is the concentration of the transferred component
in the depth of the liquid, and Cs is the concentration on the interphase surface.
Experiments show that the mass transfer coefﬁcient k mainly depends only on the
contact time tω and the diffusion coefﬁcient D. The dimensions of the three above-listed
quantities have the form
[k] = L
T ,
[D] = L2
T ,
[tω] = T.
There relations contain only two independent dimensions L and T.
Therefore, by the
π-theorem, one can construct only one dimensionless complex of the form (E1.2.1.5) from
the quantities k, D, and tω, which results in the dependence
k = C
q
D/tω,
where C is a constant.
According to the theoretical results obtained by Higbie and Danckwerts, C = 2/√π. In
the Danckwerts model, it is proposed to determine the value of tω by the spectrum of the
time of residence of liquid elements on the interphase surface. The exponential form of
this spectrum is accepted starting from the concept of statistical independence of turbulent
vortices arising in the depth of the liquid and reaching the interphase surface.

662
DIMENSIONS AND SIMILARITY
◮Equation of state of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is understood as a gas whose static state
is completely determined by the values of pressure P, density ρ, absolute temperature Ta,
and the heat capacity cv.
The dimensions of these quantities have the form
[P] = M
LT2 ,
[ρ] = M
L3 ,
[Ta] = K,
[cv] =
L2
T2K .
(E1.2.2.10)
We take into account the fact that the dimension K of temperature (in degrees Kelvin)
is a derived unit of measurement, which can be written in terms of dimensions of the
basic units of measurement as follows:
K = ML2/T2. Therefore, relations (E1.2.2.10)
for four quantities contain three independent dimensions. Hence, by the π-theorem, the
desired functional dependence for P, ρ, Ta, and cv can be represented in a simple form like
(E1.2.1.5). In the case under study, this leads to the Clapeyron—Mendeleev equation
P
cvρTa
= const,
which has the more usual form P = ρRTa, where R is the gas constant.
◮Flow of a viscous ﬂuid about a solid particle. Consider a homogenous ﬂow of a
viscous incompressible ﬂuid about a solid spherical particle of diameter d. The particle
drag force F caused by viscosity depends on the four parameters d, Ui, ν, and ρ, where Ui
is the unperturbed ﬂow velocity far from the particle and ν and ρ are the kinematic viscosity
and the ﬂuid density, respectively.
The dimensions of all ﬁve above-listed quantities (including the force) have the form
[F] = ML
T2 , [d] = L, [Ui] = L
T , [ν] = L2
T , [ρ] = M
L3 .
Out of these quantities, one can choose three with independent dimensions and compose
two dimensionless complexes
Π1 =
F
d2ρU2i
,
Π2 = dUi
ν ,
(E1.2.2.11)
which, by the π-theorem, satisfy the functional relation F(Π1, Π2) = 0. By solving this
relation for Π1, we ﬁnd the general structure of the dependence of the drag force on the
other parameters:
F
d2ρU2i
= Φ
 dUi
ν

.
(E1.2.2.12)
Thus, dimension analysis permits signiﬁcantly simplifying experimental studies by
decreasing the number of varied variables in the problem from ﬁve to two. The complex
Re = dUi/ν on the right-hand side of the expression (E1.2.2.12) is called the Reynolds
number. (One often takes the particle radius, a = d/2, to be the characteristic length when
determining the Reynolds number.)
Experiments show that Φ →A as Re →∞, where A is a constant. This situation in
which the drag force is independent of viscosity and quadratically depends on velocity is
called the Newton ﬂow mode.
As Re →0, we have Φ →B/Re. (This result can be obtained theoretically.) In this
case, the drag force linearly depends on both the viscosity and the velocity. Such a ﬂow is
called a Stokes (or creeping) ﬂow.

E1.2. THE π-THEOREM AND ITS PRACTICAL USE
663
Remark. In the case of a homogeneous translational ﬂow of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid about a body of
nonspherical shape with typical linear dimension d (for example, for d one can take the diameter of a spherical
body with equivalent volume), the dependence (E1.2.2.12) also holds, where the function Φ(z) depends on the
shape of the body.
◮Stirring a liquid. The power N required to stir a liquid with density ρ and kinematic
viscosity ν depends on the mixer diameter d, the angular velocity of stirring ω, and the
acceleration due to gravity g. The problem complexity does not allow one to calculate the
power by solving the hydrodynamic equations analytically. Therefore, we use dimensional
analysis.
We write out the dimensions of the main quantities:
[N] = ML2
T3 , [ρ] = M
L3 , [ν] = L2
T , [d] = L, [ω] = 1
T , [g] = L
T2 .
We use the π-theorem to determine the number of dimensionless complexes of the problem:
3 = 6(the number of parameters of the problem) – 3(the number of primary dimensions).
Under the assumption that the quantities d, ρ, and ω can enter any dimensionless combina-
tion, we have
N
ρd5ω3 = Φ
 d2ω
ν , dω2
g

.
The structure of the obtained functional dependence allows us to simplify the experi-
mental study signiﬁcantly by decreasing the number of varied variables in the problem from
six to three. Experiments show that for d2ω/ν ≤10–2, when the inﬂuence of the viscosity is
large, the mixer power consumption ceases to depend on the dimensionless complex d2ω/ν.
◮Turbulent ﬂow in a tube. Consider a steady turbulent ﬂow in a circular smooth tube
of radius a. Assume that r is the radial coordinate counted off from the tube axis; τw is the
friction stress* on the tube wall; V is the average component of the ﬂuid velocity; V max is
the maximum velocity on the tube axis; and ν and ρ are the liquid kinematic viscosity and
density, respectively.
It is easily seen that the average velocities V and V max of the ﬂuid motion are determined
by the following set of parameters:
a, ρ, ν, τw, r = a – y.
All the dimensionless quantities depend on the two dimensionless complexes
Re∗= aU∗
ν ,
r
a = 1 – y
a ,
where U∗=

τw/ρ is the velocity of the tangential friction stress on the tube wall.

(E1.2.2.13)

where F1(z) = F(∞, z).
The expression (E1.2.2.14) is called the universal law of velocity distribution for the
velocity defect. Experiments show that the law (E1.2.2.14) holds in the entire ﬂow region
inside smooth and rough tubes except for a narrow near-wall region.
In this case, the
function F1(z) on the right-hand side in formula (E1.2.2.14) is well approximated by the
Prandtl expression F1(z) = 2,5 ln z.
E1.3. Similarity and Simulation. General Remarks
E1.3.1. Similarity and Simulation
◮Physical similarity and simulation. Prior to manufacturing a large and expensive
structure (such as ship, aircraft, cooler, chemical reactor, etc.), one often turns to simulation,
i.e., model testing, so as to obtain the best characteristics of the structure under its expected
operation conditions. In simulation, it is necessary to know how to recalculate the results
obtained in experiments with models to the case of actual conditions: if this is unknown,
then simulation is useless. This also applies to complicated phenomena and processes. The
theory of simulation is based on the notion of similar phenomena.
Consider a class of qualitatively similar physical phenomena or processes that differ
only in the numerical values of the constitutive parameters that are used to compose s
dimensionless complexes Π1, Π2, . . . , Πs. (Here s = n – k; see the π-theorem.) Two
phenomena or processes from a given class are said to be physically similar if they are
described by the same dimensionless complexes:
Π′
1 = Π′′

Π′

Example. Suppose a streamlined ship moves on the surface of a liquid. The main contribution to the drag
of the rapidly moving ship is due to the surface waves created by it. We consider an ideal situation in which
the contribution of the streamlined ship viscous drag can be neglected as the ﬁrst approximation. The ship drag
force F is determined by its characteristic length l, its velocity U, the liquid density ρ, and the acceleration due
to gravity g. (The last parameter is essential, because the force of gravity has a determining effect on waves.)
The quantities under study have the following dimensions:
[F] = MLT–2,
[l] = L,
[U] = LT–1,
[ρ] = ML–3,
[g] = LT–2.
Here n = 5 and k = 3, and therefore, one can compose two dimensionless complexes
Π1 =
U
√lg ,
Π2 =
F
ρ(lU)2 .
(E1.3.1.4)
The dynamic similarity parameter Π1 is called the Froude number, which is denoted by the special symbol Fr.
Thus, for the model and in the case of actual conditions, the quantity U 2/l must be the same (with g remaining
unchanged), which results in the following rule for recalculating the model velocities to the case of actual
conditions:
U ′ = U ′′
r

l′′ .
(E1.3.1.5)
Using the second similarity parameter in (E1.3.1.4) and assuming that the liquid is the same for the model and
the actual conditions (more precisely, ρ′ = ρ′′), we obtain the following rule for recalculating the drag force:

i.e., the drag force is proportional to the cubed linear scale of simulation. Formula (E1.3.1.6) was derived using
relation (E1.3.1.5).
E1.3.2. General Concluding Remarks
The use of dimensionless parameters simpliﬁes analysis and interpretation of experimental
data to a large extent and, in numerous cases, allows successful simulation of phenomena
and processes that cannot be studied under laboratory conditions. Combining the theory of
dimensions and the similarity theory with the conclusions obtained experimentally or by
mathematical analysis of the corresponding equations, one can often obtain rather signiﬁcant
and nontrivial results.
Although undoubtedly useful, the theory of dimensions and similarity is in fact a re-
stricted theory, because it does not permit obtaining the explicit form of the functional
relations between dimensionless quantities (it only reveals the structure of these dependen-
cies and the number of dimensionless parameters). The desired functional dependencies
describing the phenomenon or process under study can be determined both experimentally
and theoretically by using the existing investigation methods. For the problems that are
stated mathematically as appropriate equations and boundary conditions, the role of meth-
ods of the theory of dimensions and similarity is mostly of auxiliary character. (After the
problem has been stated mathematically in dimensional variables, it is often reasonable to
reformulate it in terms of dimensionless variables.)

Chapter E2
Mechanics of Point Particles
and Rigid Bodies
E2.1. Kinematics
Kinematics is the ﬁeld of mechanics where the geometric properties of motion of a point or
a rigid body are studied independently of their mass and causes of their motion.
E2.1.1. Kinematics of a Point
To specify the motion of a point M is to introduce a rule determining the point position with
respect to a reference frame Oxyz at each time instant. The most routine and convenient
methods for specifying the motion of a point are the vector, coordinate, and natural methods.
◮The vector method for specifying the motion of a point. In this method, the position
of point M is speciﬁed by the position vector r(t) drawn to this point from a stationary center
(pole, point). For the pole one can take any point, for example, the origin O of a coordinate
system (Fig. E2.1). The position vector is a vector function of a scalar argument—time t—
and in the course of time the endpoint of the vector r traces a curve in space, which is called
the trajectory (or path) of the point.
Figure E2.1. Specifying the motion of point M in a Cartesian coordinate system. The trajectory of motion of
the point, its velocity, and acceleration.
Along with the position vector, the kinematic state of point M is characterized by the
velocity vector v(t) and the acceleration vector a(t).
The velocity v = dr
dt = ˙r, which is the derivative of the position vector with respect to
time,* characterizes the rate and direction of variation in the position of the point in space.
The velocity vector is directed along the tangent to the trajectory at point M.
* In this chapter, the time derivatives are usually denoted by a dot (which is traditional notation in classical
mechanics).

MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
The acceleration a = ˙v = ¨r is the ﬁrst time derivative of the velocity vector, or the second
derivative of the position vector. It is convenient to represent the acceleration as the sum of
two vectors aτ and an lying in the plane spanned by the vectors v and a (see Fig. E2.1):
a = aτ + an.
The vector aτ is parallel or antiparallel to v and is called the tangential acceleration, and
the vector an is perpendicular to aτ, points to the center of curvature of the trajectory, and
is called the normal acceleration.
The projection compv a of the vector a on the direction of the vector v, the tangential
acceleration magnitude aτ, and the normal acceleration magnitude an can be found by the
formulas
compv a = a ⋅v
v
= ˙v,
aτ = |˙v|,
an =
p
a2 – (aτ)2,
where a ⋅v is the scalar product of the vectors a and v.
The sign of compv a determines the character of motion of the point at the time instant
under study: if this quantity is positive, then the velocity magnitude v increases, and the
motion is said to be accelerated; otherwise, the velocity magnitude decreases, and the
motion is said to be decelerated.
◮The coordinate method for specifying the motion of a point. The position of point M
in space is speciﬁed by three functions of time,
x = x(t),
y = y(t),
z = z(t),
(E2.1.1.1)
where x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates of M. This method is another representation of
the vector method, because the position vector r issuing from the origin can be represented
as the sum
r = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k,
where i, j, k are the unit vectors (basis vectors) directed along the coordinate x-, y-, and
z-axes (Fig. E2.1).
The projections of the velocity on the coordinate vx-, vy-, and vz-axes can be found by
differentiation with respect to time of the corresponding functions (E2.1.1.1):
vx = ˙x,
vy = ˙y,
vz = ˙z.
(E2.1.1.2)
The velocity vector can be found as the vector sum of three vectors,
v = vxi + vyj + vzk,
and the velocity magnitude is given by the formula
v =
q
v2x + v2y + v2z.
(E2.1.1.3)
The projections ax, ay, and az of the acceleration onto the coordinate axes, the acceler-
ation a, and its magnitude a can be found by the formulas
ax = ˙vx = ¨x,
ay = ˙vy = ¨y,
az = ˙vz = ¨z,
a = axi + ayj + azk,
a =
q
a2x + a2y + a2z.
(E2.1.1.4)

The tangential acceleration is calculated by the formulas
compv a = ˙v =
˙x¨x + ˙y¨y + ˙z¨z
p
˙x2 + ˙y2 + ˙z2 ;
aτ = |˙v|.
(E2.1.1.5)
◮The natural method for specifying the motion of a point. In this case, the position
of point M in space is speciﬁed by specifying
(a) The trajectory of the point.
(b) The origin (point O on the trajectory from which the angular position s is counted).
(c) The positive sense of the arc coordinate.
(d) The law of motion s = s(t) of the point, i.e., the time dependence of the arc
coordinate.
The arc coordinate s is the length of the trajectory arc counted from point O to point M.
If the length is counted in the positive sense, then the arc coordinate is positive; otherwise,
it is negative.
The natural coordinate axes are constructed at point M. For a given trajectory of the
point, the position vector r connecting the ﬁxed pole with point M becomes a function of
the arc coordinate, r = r(s). Its derivative τ = rs′ with respect to the arc coordinate is the
unit vector tangent to the trajectory at point M in the sense of increasing arc coordinate.
The second derivative r′′
ss = τ ′
s = n/ρ gives the second unit vector n of the principal
normal, which is perpendicular to τ and points to the center of curvature of the trajectory.
The geometric meaning of the factor 1/ρ will be explained later.
The last, third unit vector b of the binormal is the cross product of the ﬁrst two unit
vectors, b = τ × n.
The right trihedron of unit vectors thus constructed bears the name of the natural
coordinate axes. The planes passing through them are called as follows: (nb) is the normal
plane, (bτ) is the rectifying plane, and (τn) is the osculating plane.
If on the trajectory near the point M we choose a point M′ whose arc coordinate s + ∆s
differs by a small value ∆s, them, up to terms of higher order of magnitude, the distances
from M′ to the above-listed planes are as follows: ∆s to the normal plane, (∆s)2/(2ρ) to
the rectifying plane, and β(∆s)3 to the osculating plane, where β is a quantity of the order
of unity. This means that the part of the trajectory in a small neighborhood of point M
“practically” lies in the osculating plane.
Let us construct a family of circles tangent to the trajectory at point M so that their
centers are located on the principal normal n. These circles lie in the osculating plane. The
circle that is tangent to the trajectory most closely is called the osculating circle. The center
of this circle, its radius ρ, and the quantity k = 1/ρ are called the center of curvature, the
radius of curvature, and the curvature of the trajectory at point M (Fig. E2.2). On ﬂat parts
of the trajectory, the values of ρ are larger and the values of k are less than on the curved
parts.
Figure E2.2. Osculating circle, the center of curvature, and the radius of curvature.

MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Using the natural coordinate axes, one can write the velocity and acceleration vectors
of point M as
v = ˙sτ,
a = aτ + an = ¨sτ + (v2/ρ)n.
(E2.1.1.6)
In the last expressions, one must take into account the following:
First, the vector v is directed along the tangent to the trajectory and v = |˙s|; the point
velocity v is directed in the sense of increasing s if ˙s > 0 and decreasing s if ˙s < 0.
Second, the vector a lies in the osculating plane and points in the direction of the
trajectory concavity; ¨s = compv a;
|¨s| = aτ; the tangential acceleration vector aτ is
directed in the sense of increasing s if ¨s > 0 and decreasing s if ¨s < 0.
Third, if ˙s¨s > 0, then, at the time instant under study, the velocity magnitude v increases
and the motion is accelerated; for ˙s¨s < 0, the velocity magnitude v decreases and the motion
is decelerated.
The normal accelerationis zeroif the point moves alonga rectilinear part of the trajectory,
where k = 1/ρ = 0. The tangential acceleration of the point is zero if the velocity magnitude
remains constant.
A uniformly varying motion of a point is a motion where ¨s = a0 = const. In this case,
the values of the velocity and the arc coordinate can be found by the formulas
˙s = ˙s0 + a0(t – t0),
s = s0 + ˙s0(t – t0) + 1
2 a0(t – t0)2.
(E2.1.1.7)
Here ˙s0 and s0 are the values of the velocity and the arc coordinate corresponding to the
time instant t0.
A uniform motion is a motion of a point in which ¨s = a0 = 0.
In the case of an arbitrary motion, the arc coordinate s and the path L passed over by
the point can be found by the formulas
s =
Z t
t0
˙s dt,
L =
Z t
t0
v dt.
This clearly illustrates the difference between the arc coordinate and the path passed
over by the point.
Example. An ellipsograph rod AB of length 2l = 2 m (Fig. E2.3) moves so that the angle ϕ (in radians)
varies according to the law ϕ = – 1

line, and point A moves along the vertical line. Find the trajectory of point K lying at the middle of the rod,
its velocity, acceleration, and the radius of curvature of the trajectory for t = 1 s.

Solution. The method used here to specify the motion of the point differs from the three above-mentioned
ones. Therefore, we pass to the coordinate method and use the corresponding formulas. We introduce the
coordinate axes as is shown in the ﬁgure and then ﬁnd the coordinates of point K: x = l sin ϕ, y = l cos ϕ (for
convenience, the subscript is omitted). Squaring the right and left sides of the equations of motion and adding
them termwise, we obtain the trajectory equation
x2 + y2 = l2,
which implies that point K moves in a circle of radius l. Then, by using formulas (E2.1.1.2)—(E2.1.1.6) and
by taking into account the fact that the quantities ϕ = π/6, ˙ϕ = 1 s–1, and ¨ϕ = –1 s–2 correspond to time t = 1 s,
we obtain
vx = ˙x = l cos ϕ ˙ϕ;
vx(1) = 0.87 m/s,
vy = ˙y = –l sin ϕ ˙ϕ;
vy(1) = –0.5 m/s,
v =
q
v2x + v2y;
v(1) = 1 m/s,
ax = ˙vx = l(– sin ϕ ˙ϕ2 + cos ϕ ¨ϕ);
ax(1) = –1.37 m/s2,
ay = ˙vy = l(– cos ϕ ˙ϕ2 – sin ϕ ¨ϕ);
ay(1) = –0.37 m/s2,
a =
q
a2x + a2y;
a(1) = 1.41 m/s2,
˙v = vxax + vyay
v
;
˙v(1) = –1.0 m/s2,
aτ(1) = 1.0 m/s2,
an =
p
a2 – (aτ)2;
an(1) = 1.0 m/s2,
ρ = v2
an ;
ρ(1) = 1.0 m,
(E2.1.1.8)
and the sign of ˙v means that, for t = 1s, the motion of the point is decelerated; this result is obvious in advance,
as follows from the equation of the trajectory.
E2.1.2. Kinematics of a Rigid Body
◮Some notions, deﬁnitions, and theorems. An absolutely rigid body (or arigid body,
or a body) is a set of points moving in space so that the distance between any two of them
remains constant. (In other words, the mutual position of points of a rigid body does not
vary in time.)
The problem of kinematics of a rigid body is to obtain formulas for determining the
velocity vector v and the acceleration vector a for any point of the rigid body.
THEOREM 1. If a vector b belongs to a moving rigid body (connects two of its points),
then the vector ˙b (the time derivative) is either zero or orthogonal to b.
Indeed, by differentiating the relation b ⋅b = const with respect to time, we obtain
b ⋅˙b = 0, which proves the above statement.
THEOREM 2. The projections of the velocities of any two points of a rigid body onto
the straight line connecting them are equal, comp−−→
AB
VA = comp−−→
AB
VB (Fig. E2.4).
This theorem remains valid for an arbitrary motion of the body and states that the
projections must be equal in both magnitude and direction.
THEOREM 3. If the time derivatives ˙b1 and ˙b2 of two noncollinear vectors b1 and b2
belonging to a rigid body are known, then, for any vector b belonging to this rigid body, its
time derivative can be found as the cross product ˙b = ω × b, where
ω = 0 if ˙b1 = ˙b2 = 0;
ω = η ⋅b2, where η = (˙b1 ⋅˙b1)/(˙b1 ⋅(b2 × b1)) if ˙b1 ≠0; ˙b2 = 0;
ω = (˙b1 × ˙b2)/(˙b1 ⋅b2) if ˙b1 ≠0; ˙b2 ≠0
(Markuzon’s formula).
(E2.1.2.1)

MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Figure E2.4. Projections of the velocities of two points of a rigid body onto the straight line passing through
them.
The vector ω is called the vector of angular velocity of the rigid body; it characterizes
the kinematic state of the body at the time instant under study.
Although formulas (E2.1.2.1) make sense for any values of the vectors b1, b2, ˙b1, and
˙b2, one has to bear in mind that these vectors in problems of kinematics cannot be introduced
arbitrarily; they must satisfy the conditions of the above-mentioned theorems of kinematics
of a rigid body.
The vector ε = ˙ω is called the vector of angular acceleration of the rigid body.
We assume that the body moves relative to a ﬁxed reference frame Oξηζ, and at the
time instant under study we know the position of point P of the body, its velocity vP and
acceleration aP , and the vectors of the body angular velocity ω and angular acceleration ε.
In this case, the velocity and acceleration of any point M of the body can be found by
differentiating the vector equation −−→
OM = −−→
OP + r with respect to time (Fig. E2.5 a).
After the ﬁrst differentiation, we obtain
˙
−−→
OM =
˙
−−→
OP + ˙r, or
vM = vP + ω × r;
(E2.1.2.2)
after the repeated differentiation, we obtain ˙vM = ˙vP + ˙ω × r + ω × ˙r, or
aM = aP + ε × r + ω × (ω × r).
(E2.1.2.3)
Formulas (E2.1.2.2) and (E2.1.2.3) in general form solve the problem of kinematics
of a rigid body, but they can hardly be used to solve problems frequently encountered in
practice. In what follows, we consider special cases of motion of a rigid body.
◮Translational motion. A motion of a rigid body is said to be translational if, in the
course of motion, any straight line drawn in the body remains parallel to the initial direction
of itself. In this case, ω = 0 and ε = 0, which implies the properties of translational motion:
being superimposed on each other, the trajectories of all points of a rigid body coincide (are
congruent), and the velocities and accelerations of all points of the body are the same at
each time instant:
vA = vB = v,
aA = aB = a,
where A and B are any points of the body.
Thus, the kinematics of translational motion of a body is reduced to the kinematics of
one of its points.
◮Rotation about a ﬁxed axis. In rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed axis, which is
called the axis of rotation, the points lying on the axis remain ﬁxed. The other points move
in circles lying in the planes orthogonal to the rotation axis.
We introduce two reference frames, the ﬁxed reference frame Oξηζ whose axis Oζ
coincides with the rotation axis of the body and the moving frame Oxyz rigidly ﬁxed to

E2.1. KINEMATICS

the body with axis Oz also directed along the rotation axis. The origin O of both frames is
placed at the point of intersection of the rotation axis with the plane containing the point M
whose velocity and acceleration are the desired variables.
The unit vectors ξ◦, η◦, ζ◦of the ﬁxed reference frame and i◦, j◦, k◦of the moving
frame are shown in Fig. E2.6.
Figure E2.6. Rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis.
The dihedral angle ϕ between the moving plane i◦k◦and the ﬁxed plane ξ◦ζ◦is called
the angle of rotation of the rigid body; it is measured in radians. The rotation angle is
assumed to be positive if it is counted off from the ﬁxed plane towards the moving plane

674
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
anticlockwise if we look in the positive sense of the axis of rotation. To know the position of
the body (and of any of its points) at any time instant, it is necessary to know the dependence
of the angle ϕ on time t,
ϕ = ϕ(t).
This equation expresses the law of rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed axis.
Along with the function ϕ(t), its ﬁrst and second time derivatives characterize the
kinematic state of the rigid body at the time instant under study:
ω = ˙ϕ,
ε = ˙ω = ¨ϕ,
where ω is the angular velocity of the body and ε is its angular acceleration.
The unit vectors of the moving frame are written as functions of the rotation angle ϕ as
follows: i◦= ξ◦cos ϕ+η◦sin ϕ, j◦= –ξ◦sin ϕ+η◦cos ϕ, k◦= ζ◦= −−−→
const. By differentiating
these formulas with respect to time, we obtain ˙i◦= j◦˙ϕ, ˙j
◦= –i◦˙ϕ, after which the angular
velocity vector can be found: ω = (˙i◦× ˙j
◦)/(˙i◦⋅j◦) = –(j◦× i◦) ˙ϕ/(j◦⋅j◦) = ζ◦˙ϕ.
After the differentiation of the last relation, we obtain ε = ˙ω = ζ◦¨ϕ.
Thus, the vectors of angular velocity and angular acceleration of a body rotating about
a ﬁxed axis are directed along this axis. In this case, if we look in the direction opposite
to the vector ω, then it seems that the rotation is anticlockwise (the right-hand screw rule).
In these cases, the vector ε is parallel to the vector ω if the signs of ˙ϕ and ¨ϕ coincide.
Otherwise, ω and ε are antiparallel.
To determine the velocity vM and the acceleration aM of an arbitrary point M of the
body, one can use the vector formulas (E2.1.2.2) and (E2.1.2.3), but here we perform this
in a different, more illustrative way.
In the case of rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis, the trajectory of its arbitrary point M
is a circle whose radius R is called the radius of rotation of a point. In Fig. E2.7, this circle
is shown from the side of positive sense of the rotation axis. The sign of ω indicates the
direction of rotation: if it is positive, then the rotation is anticlockwise. It is convenient
to represent the angular velocity and the angular acceleration by using curved arrows with
their sign taken into account (in Fig. E2.7, ω < 0 and ε > 0). If ω and ε have the same signs,
then one says that the rotation is accelerated, and if the signs are opposite, then the rotation
is decelerated.
In the case of rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis, the magnitude of the velocity of
point M can be found by the formula
v = |ω|R;
(E2.1.2.4)
in this case the velocity is directed along the tangent to the circle, and so is perpendicular to
the radius, and its sense is consistent with the sense of the curved arrow ω (Fig. E2.7). The
tangential, normal, and total acceleration can be found by the following formulas, which
are a special case of formulas (E2.1.2.3):
aτ = |ε|R,
an = ω2R,
a = R
p
ε2 + ω4.
(E2.1.2.5)
The tangential acceleration vector aτ is directed along the tangent to the circle, and
its sense is consistent with that of the curved arrow ε; the vector an is directed along the
radius R towards the center of the circle. The acute angle µ between a and R can be found
by the formula
tan µ = aτ
an = |ε|
ω2 ;

675
Figure E2.7. The trajectory of an arbitrary point M of a body rotating about a ﬁxed axis; R is the radius of
rotation of the point. The curved arrows denote the angular velocity and the angular acceleration.
in this case, the sense of the nearest rotation from a to R is consistent with the sense of the
curved arrow ε.
It follows from the last two formulas that the vectors v and a of different points of
the body that lie on the same radius are parallel to each other and linearly depend on the
distance from the axis of rotation (Fig. E2.7):
ω = vB
BP = vC
CP = vD
DP ,
ε = aB
BP = aC
CP = aD
DP .
(E2.1.2.6)
A rotation of a rigid body is said to be uniformly varying if ε = ε0 = const. In this
case, the time dependencies of the rotation angle and the angular velocity are given by the
formulas
ω = ω0 + ε0(t – t0),
ϕ = ϕ0 + ω0(t – t0) + 1
2 ε0(t – t0)2,
which are similar to the formulas for the uniformly varying motion of a point (E2.1.1.7).
The uniform rotation of a rigid body is a special case of uniformly varying rotation,
namely, the case in which ε0 = const = 0.
E2.1.3. Plane-Parallel (Plane) Motion of a Rigid Body
◮Basic notions. A plane-parallel (plane) motion is a motion of a body in which the
distance from any of its points to some ﬁxed plane remains unchanged. (Each point of the
body moves in a plane, but the planes for different points of the body can be different.) The
rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis is a special case of plane motion.
Studying a plane-parallel motion can be reduced to studying the motion of a plane ﬁgure
in its plane. The rotation angle ϕ(t) of a plane ﬁgure is counted off from a ﬁxed straight
line to a straight line rigidly ﬁxed to the ﬁgure.
The position of a plane ﬁgure is completely determined if the coordinates of some of its
points (pole, center) P and the rotation angle are known. The relations
xP = x(t),
yP = y(t),
ϕ = ϕ(t)

676
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
determining three functional dependencies on time are called the equations of motion of a
plane ﬁgure.
The angular velocity vector ω and the angular acceleration vector ε are introduced by
analogy with the case of rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis; they are orthogonal to the
base plane. One has ω = ˙ϕ and ε = ˙ω = ¨ϕ.
Just as in the case of rotation about a ﬁxed axis, when solving practical problems it is
convenient to represent the angular velocity and acceleration by curved arrows.
◮Theorem on velocities of points of a plane ﬁgure. Instantaneous center of velocities.
THEOREM (ON VELOCITIES OF POINTS OF A PLANE FIGURE). The velocity of any point B
of a plane ﬁgure is equal to the vector sum of the velocity vP of the pole and the velocity vBP
that point B would have in the imaginary rotation of the ﬁgure about the ﬁxed pole P at the
angular velocity ω (Fig. E2.8):
vB = vP + vBP .
(E2.1.3.1)
The velocity vBP is perpendicular to segment BP, its magnitude is calculated by the
formula vBP = |ω|BP, and the sense is consistent with the sense of the curved arrow ω.
Figure E2.8. Determining the velocity of an arbitrary point of a plane ﬁgure (to the theorem on velocities of
points of a plane ﬁgure).
The point Pv of a plane ﬁgure whose velocity at the time instant under study is zero
is called the instantaneous center of velocities. If this point is taken for the pole, then the
velocity of an arbitrary point B of the plane ﬁgure is determined by the formula vB = vBPv.
The direction of vB is consistent with the direction of the curved arrow of the angular
velocity, and its magnitude can be found by the formula vB = |ω|BPv. The velocities of
points of the plane ﬁgure at the time instant under study are distributed by analogy with the
case of rotation of the ﬁgure about a ﬁxed axis passing through the instantaneous center of
velocities. Therefore, one can use formula (E2.1.2.6) for rotational motion:
ω =
vB

(E2.1.3.2)
In Fig. E2.9a,b,c, we show several versions of location of the instantaneous center of
velocities:
(a) In rolling motion without slip on a ﬁxed surface, the instantaneous center of veloc-
ities lies at the point of tangency (Fig. E2.9a).
(b) If vB ∥vC and vB ⊥BC, then the position of Pv is determined by the construction
shown in Fig. E2.9b.
(c) If vB ∥vC and the segment BC is not perpendicular to vB, then there is no
instantaneous center of velocities, ω = 0, and the velocities of all points of the body are the
same at a given time instant (Fig. E2.9c).

Example. At time t = 1 s, ﬁnd the velocities of points A, B, and K of the ellipsograph rod whose motion
is described in the example in Subsection E2.1.1.
Solution. The rod AB is in plane-parallel motion. Drawing perpendiculars to the directions of velocities
of points A and B, we ﬁnd the position of the instantaneous center Pv of velocities (Fig. E2.10). We represent
the angular velocity ω = ˙ϕ = 1 s–1 by a curved arrow with sign taken into account. We direct the velocities
of points A, B, and K perpendicular to the straight lines connecting them with Pv so that their senses are
consistent with the curved arrow of the angular velocity. The values of the velocities can be found from the
relation
ω =

which implies vA = vK = 1.0 m/s and vB =

any point B of a plane ﬁgure is equal to the vector sum of the acceleration of the pole aP

BP = ω2BP; aτ

BP and is
consistent with the sense of the curved arrow ε, aτ
BP = |ε|BP (Fig. E2.11).
If the vector relation(E2.1.3.3) is projectedontotwodirections, the parallel direction BP
and the perpendicular direction BP, then we obtain the system of two scalar equations
aB cos δ = –aP cos β + ω2BP,
aB sin δ = –aP sin β + |ε|BP
containing seven variables aB, aP , δ, β, BP, ω, and ε. If ﬁve of them are known, then the
remaining two can be found by solving the system.
The instantaneous center of accelerations of a plane ﬁgure is a point Pa of this ﬁgure
whose acceleration at the time instant under study is zero. The distribution of accelerations
of points of the plane ﬁgure is the same as in the case of its rotation about a ﬁxed axis
passing through the point Pa.
Let us indicate the positions of the instantaneous center of velocities and the instanta-
neous center of accelerations of a disk that uniformly rolls without slip on a horizontal ﬁxed
straight line.
Since the rolling motion is without slip, it follows that the velocities of points of tangency
of the disk and of the straight line are the same. And since the straight line is ﬁxed, we
conclude that the instantaneous center of velocities of the disk lies at the point of tangency.
The center of the disk moves uniformly, and hence its tangential acceleration is zero.
Further, the trajectoryof the center of the disk is rectilinear, andhenceits normal acceleration
is zero. Therefore, the total acceleration of the center, which is equal to the vector sum
of the tangential and normal accelerations, is also zero; i.e., the instantaneous center of
accelerations of the disk lies at the center of the disk.
The above example shows that the instantaneous center of velocities and the instanta-
neous center of accelerations are in general different points of a plane ﬁgure. But in special
cases they can coincide; for example, in the case of rotation of a body about a ﬁxed axis,
both Pv and Pa always lie on the axis of rotation.
E2.1.4. Arbitrary Motion of a Rigid Body
The velocity vM and the acceleration aM of any point of a rigid body in an arbitrary
motion can be found if, at the time instant under study, we know the velocity vP and the
accelerationaP of a point P of the bodyandthe vectorsω of angular velocityand ε of angular

E2.1. KINEMATICS
679
acceleration of the body. The corresponding formulas have the form (see Eqs. (E2.1.2.2)
and (E2.1.2.3))
vM = vP + ω × r,
aM = aP + ε × r + ω × (ω × r).
(E2.1.4.1)
In the special case vP = 0, aP = 0, which takes place in spherical motion, formulas
(E2.1.4.1) become
vM = ω × r
(Euler formula),
aM = ε × r + ω × (ω × r) = ε × r + ω × vM.
In this case, the distribution of velocities of points of the body is the same as in the case
of rotation about the ﬁxed axis passing through P parallel to the vector ω; therefore, it is
called the instantaneous axis of rotation. The velocities of all points of the body that lie on
this axis at the time instant under study are zero, and a small displacement of the body can
be treated as a rotation by a small angle about the instantaneous axis of rotation.
To ﬁnd the speciﬁc features of the spatial orientation of the vectors contained in rela-
tions (E2.1.4.1), we rewrite them as
vM = vP + vω,
aM = aP + aτ
ε + an
ω,
(E2.1.4.2)
where we introduce the notation vω = ω × r, aτ
ε = ε × r, and an
ω = ω × (ω × r).
These vectors can be interpreted physically as follows (see Fig. E2.5b,c):
The vector vω is the velocity of point M of the body in the case of imaginary rotation
about the ﬁxed axis directed along the vector ω and passing through point P. In this
imaginary motion, the point moves in a circle of radius Rω lying in the plane orthogonal to
the vector ω. The velocity is directed along the tangent to this circle, and its value can be
calculated by formula vω = ωRω.
an
ω is the vector of normal acceleration of point M in the same imaginary motion of
the body. The vector is directed along the radius of the circle towards its center, and its
magnitude can be calculated by the formula an
ω = ω2Rω.
aτ
ε is the vector of tangential acceleration of point M in the case of another imaginary
rotation about the ﬁxed axis directed along the vector ε and passing through point P. In this
imaginary motion, the point moves in a circle of radius Rε lying in the plane orthogonal
to the vector ε. The vector of tangential acceleration is directed along the tangent to this
circle, and its magnitude can be calculated by the formula aτ
ε = εRε.
It follows from the above that any small displacement of a rigid body at the time instant
under study can be represented as composed of three simultaneous imaginary small motions:
(1) The translational motion with velocity vP and acceleration aP and with zero mag-
nitudes of ω and ε.
(2) The rotation about a ﬁxed axis directed along the vector ω and passing through
point P, with zero magnitudes of vP , aP , and ε.
(3) The rotation about a ﬁxed axis directed along the vector ε and passing through
point P, with zero magnitudes of vP , aP , ω, and t.
We take the scalar products of both sides of Eq. (E2.1.4.1) by the unit vector ω/ω and
obtain the equation
compω vP = compω vM.
This means that the projection of the velocity of any point of the body onto the direction of
the angular velocity vector is independent of the choice of the point.

680
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Now we ﬁnd the body points that have the minimum velocity. Without loss of generality,
we direct the vector ω along the axis Pz of the reference frame Pxyz, place the velocity
vector v of point P in the plane xPz, and expand it into two orthogonal components, v∥ω
parallel to the axis Pz and v⊥ω parallel to the axis Px. On the axis Py, we choose a point S
so that PS = v⊥ω/ω. A straightforward veriﬁcation shows that vS ∥ω and vS = vmin = v∥ω.
All the points lying on the axis SZ have the same property.
A system of vectors ω, v located on the same straight line is called a screw or a wrench.
The scalar quantity p = v/ω is called the parameter of the screw.
The constant values accompanying some phenomenon or process are usually called
invariants.
Therefore, one can say that, in kinematics of a rigid body, there are two
invariants with respect to the choice of the pole P, namely, the vector of angular velocity
of a rigid body and the projection of the velocity of a point of the body on the direction of
the angular velocity vector.
Thus, in an arbitrary motion of a rigid body, the distribution of velocities of its points at
the time instant under study can be one of the following: (1) instantaneous rest, (2) instanta-
neous translational motion, (3) rotation about the instantaneous axis, and (4) instantaneous
screw motion.
Example. A right circular cone with angle 2α at the vertex performs a spherical motion and rolls without
slip on the surface of a ﬁxed right circular cone with angle 2β at the vertex (Fig. E2.12). At the time instant
under study, the axis of the moving cone, rotating about the vertical axis, has the angular velocity ω1 and the
angular acceleration ε1.
Find the angular velocity ω and the angular acceleration ε of the moving cone at the time instant under
study.
x

z
Figure E2.12. Rolling of a circular cone on the surface of another circular cone.
Solution. We introduce ﬁxed Cartesian coordinate axes with origin at the vertex of the cone: the z-axis is
directed along the axis of the ﬁxed cone, the x-axis is perpendicular to the z-axis in the plane formed by the
cone axes at the initial time instant t = 0, and the y-axis is orthogonal to the plane xz, so that the axes thus
constructed form a right reference frame.
On the axis of the moving cone, we choose an arbitrary point M and denote the position vector connecting
this point with the origin O by r.
The moving cone is in spherical motion. The angular velocity vector ω is directed along the common
generator of the cones, because it is an instantaneous axis of rotation. The plane ωr rotates about the ﬁxed
z-axis, and the vectors ω1 and ε1 are directed along it.
The velocity vM can be found if we ﬁrst refer it to the cone and then to the plane ωr:
ω × r = ω1 × r
or
(ω – ω1) × r = 0,
which implies that (ω – ω1) ∥r = 0. This means that the straight line connecting the endpoints of the vectors
ω and ω1 is parallel to the vector r.
Considering the obtained triangle, we obtain ω = ω1 sin(α + β)/sin β from the law of sines.

E2.1. KINEMATICS
681
To ﬁnd the vector ε, we represent the vector ω = ω(t) as the sum of three components parallel to the
coordinate axes:
ω = ω1 sin(α + β) sin α

where ϕ1 = (ω1t + ε1t2/2) is the rotation angle of the plane ωr in time t. The angular acceleration can be
obtained by differentiating the resulting angular velocity vector ε = ˙ω with respect to time.
Now if the vectors ω and ε are known, then one can ﬁnd the velocity and the acceleration of any point of
the moving cone.
The expression for the angular acceleration can be obtained in a simpler way by using the theorems
presented below.
E2.1.5. Compound Motion of a Point
◮Basic notions. Very often, two observers trace one and the same point M, one of them
is in the laboratory reference frame Oξηζ, which is assumed to be ﬁxed, and the other is
in a moving reference frame Pxyz, which moves relative to the ﬁxed frame according to a
given law (Fig. E2.13). In this case, if the law of motion of a point in the moving reference
frame is given, then the point position in the ﬁxed reference frame can also be determined at
any time instant. The motion of a point deﬁned in this way is called the compound motion
of a point.
Figure E2.13. Compound motion of a point; the ﬁxed reference frame Oξηζ and the moving reference frame
Pxyz.
This method for specifying the motion of a point differs from those studied above.
The velocity of a point and its acceleration can be determined as follows: use appropriate
transformations to pass to one of the above-studied methods for determining the motion of
a point and then proceed accordingly. But the same problem can be solved differently by
using the notions and theorems on the velocities and accelerations in the compound motion
of a point, which will be given below.
The absolute motion of point M is its motion relative to the ﬁxed (absolute) reference
frame. The trajectory of the point, its velocity, and acceleration are called the absolute
trajectory, absolute velocity va and absolute acceleration aa, respectively.
The relative motion of point M is its motion relative to the moving reference frame.
The trajectory of the point, its velocity, and acceleration relative to the moving reference
frame are called the relative trajectory, relative velocity vr, and relative acceleration ar,
respectively.
The frame motion is the motion of the moving reference frame relative to the ﬁxed
reference frame. In this motion, the moving frame “transfers” the set of points rigidly ﬁxed
to it.
The frame velocity ve and the frame acceleration ae of point M are the velocity and
acceleration of the point B that is permanently attached to the moving frame and coincides
with the moving point M at the given time instant.

682
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
If the velocity vP and the acceleration aP of a point P belonging to the moving frame,
as well as the angular velocity ωe and the angular acceleration εe of the moving frame, are
known, then ve and ae can be found by the formulas
ve = vB = vP + ωe × r,
ae = aB = aP + εe × r + ωe × (ωe × r),
where r is the position vector −−→
PB of point B of the moving frame at which the point M
occurs at the time instant under study.
◮Main theorems.
THEOREM ON VELOCITIES IN COMPOUND MOTION OF A POINT. The absolute velocity
vector is equal to the vector sum of the relative and frame velocity vectors,
va = vr + ve.
(E2.1.5.1)
THEOREM ON ACCELERATIONS IN COMPOUND MOTION OF A POINT. The absolute accel-
eration vector is equal to the vector sum of the relative, frame, and Coriolis acceleration
vectors,
aa = ar + ae + aC.
(E2.1.5.2)
The Coriolis acceleration vector is determined by the formula
aC = 2(ωe × vr)
(E2.1.5.3)
and is consistent with the rules for calculating the cross product.
To ﬁnd the vectors ar and ae, one has to bear in mind that each of them can be the vector
sum of several components, for example, of the tangential and normal accelerations.
Example. Point M moves according to the law AM = 0.5 t2 – 2t + 2.5 along the ellipsograph rod whose
motion was described in the Example in Subsection E2.1.1. Find its velocity and acceleration at time t = 1 s.
Solution. We ﬁnd the velocity and acceleration by applying the theorems on compound motion of a point.
Let us introduce a moving reference frame attached to the rod AB. Under such a choice, the relative motion
of point M can be introduced in a natural way. For t = 1 s, this point is at the middle of the segment.
We use formulas (E2.1.1.6) to obtain the relative velocity and acceleration
vr = ˙L = t – 2;
vr(1) = –1 m/s,
aτ
r = ¨L;
aτ
r (1) = 1 m/s2,
an
r = v2
r /ρr = 0
(because 1/ρr = 0),
where the notation L = AM is used.
In Fig. E2.14, we present the relative velocity and acceleration with signs taken into account.
Figure E2.14. Relative and frame velocities and accelerations of point M of the ellipsograph.

E2.1. KINEMATICS
683
The frame velocity and acceleration of point M are equal to the velocity and acceleration of the point on
the ellipsograph rod where the point M occurs at time t = 1 s. This point is the rod point K whose velocity and
acceleration were obtained by solving the example in Subsection E2.1.1 (see formulas (E2.1.1.8)); we show
them in the ﬁgure.
Now let us ﬁnd the Coriolis acceleration. The angular velocity vector of the moving reference frame is
directed towards the observer perpendicular to the ﬁgure plane, and the relative velocity vector lies in the ﬁgure
plane. Therefore, the vector aC lies in the ﬁgure plane and is perpendicular to vr, so that if we look towards aC,
then the nearest rotation from ω to vr seems to be anticlockwise (Fig. E2.14). The magnitude of aC is equal to
aC = 2ωvr sin 90◦= 2 m/s2.
Let us ﬁnd the absolute velocity of point M:
va = vr + ve.
We project both sides of the vector equation onto the x- and y-axes:
vax = vrx + vex = –1 sin 30◦+ 1 cos 30◦= 0.37 m/s,
vay = vry + vey = 1 cos 30◦– 1 sin 30◦= 0.37 m/s,
which implies that va =
p
v2ax + v2ay = 0.52 m/s.
Let us ﬁnd the absolute acceleration of point M:
aa = ar + ae + aC.
We project both sides of the last vector relation onto the x- and y-axes:
aax = 1 sin 30◦– 1.37 – 2 cos 30◦= –2.60 m/s2,
aay = –1 cos 30◦– 0.37 – 2 sin 30◦= –2.24 m/s2,
which implies that aa =
p
a2ax + a2ay = 3.43 m/s2.
When solving problems of kinematics by using theorems on the compound motion of
a point, the kinematic characteristics of the relative and frame motions can be found only
after the moving reference frame is chosen. This choice is not unique, because it depends
on the researcher alone. Therefore, the problem on the direction of the Coriolis acceleration
makes no sense until the ﬁxed frame, the moving frame, and the law of motion of the latter
are chosen.
The theorem on the velocities of a point in compound motion of a point can be stated
differently. Indeed, for the point M, the theorem on velocities can be written as (Fig. E2.13)
va = vr + ve
or
d−−→
OM
dt
= vr + d−−→
OP
dt
+ ω × r
or
dr
dt = vr + ω × r.
Taking into account the fact that vr is the velocity of point M relative to the moving
reference frame, we call it the local (relative) derivative of the vector r and denote by edr
dt ;
the quantity dr
dt will be called the absolute derivative. As a result, the last relation implies
that
dr
dt =
edr
dt + ω × r.
This formula is sometimes called the theorem on the relation between the absolute and
local (relative) derivatives of a vector.

Figure E2.15. Compound motion of a body determined by three reference frames.
E2.1.6. Compound Motion of a Body
◮Absolute, relative, and frame motion. One often encounters situations in which the
position of points of a rigid body is determined by three reference frames: the frame Pxyz
rigidly ﬁxed to the body, the moving frame oξηζ in which the motion of the body is given,
and the absolute (conventionally, ﬁxed) frame OXY Z relative to which the motion of the
moving reference frame is given (Fig. E2.15).
The motion of a body in a moving frame is said to be relative, in the ﬁxed frame, to
be absolute, and the motion of the moving frame relative to the ﬁxed frame is called the
frame motion. The rigid body motion itself, when given as described above, is said to be
compound.
◮Addition of translational motions. Assume that, in a moving frame, a body is in
instantaneous translational motion with velocity vr, while the moving frame itself is in
instantaneous translational motion with velocity ve. Using the theorem on the addition of
velocities in the compound motion of a point, we obtain the velocity of an arbitrary point M
of the body,
vM = va = vr + ve.
The point M in no way participates in the ﬁnal result, and this means that the velocity
vectors of all points of the body are the same at the time instant under study; that is, in the
case of two instantaneous translational motions, the body is in instantaneous translational
motion with velocity equal to the vector sum of the velocities of these two instantaneous
translational motions.
This result can be generalized to the case of a larger number of translational motions: the
resulting motion is an instantaneous translational motion with velocity equal to the vector
sum of the velocities of the original instantaneous translational motions.
◮Addition of rotations about intersecting axes. Assume that in the moving frame
the body is in instantaneous rotation about an axis with angular velocity ω1, while the
moving frame itself is in instantaneous rotation about another axis with angular velocity ω2;
moreover, the axes intersect at point P (Fig. E2.16).
Using the theorem on the addition of velocities in compound motion of a point, we
obtain the velocity of an arbitrary point M of the body:
vM = va = vr + ve = ω1 × r + ω2 × r = (ω1 + ω2) × r = Ω× r,
where
Ω= ω1 + ω2.
In other words, if the instantaneous angular velocities intersect, then the resulting motion
of the body is an instantaneous rotation, with angular velocity equal to their vector sum,

E2.1. KINEMATICS

about an axis passing through the point of intersection. This statement holds for any number
of instantaneous rotations about axes intersecting at one point.
◮Couple of rotations. Assume that a body in the moving reference frame is in instan-
taneous rotation about an axis with angular velocity ω′, while the moving frame itself is
in instantaneous rotation about an axis with angular velocity ω′′. Moreover, the axes are
parallel, and the angular velocities are equal and opposite, ω′ = ω′′ = ω and ω′ = – ω′′
(Fig. E2.17).
Figure E2.17. Addition of rotations about parallel axes (couple of rotations).
Using the theorem on the addition of velocities in compound motion of a point, we
obtain the velocity of an arbitrary point M of the body:
vM = va = vr +ve = ω′ ×r′ +ω′′ ×r′′ = ω′ ×(r′ –r′′) = ω′ × −−−→
O′′O′ = ω′′ × −−−→
O′O′′ = momω′,ω′′,
where the symbol momω′,ω′′ denotes the vector of moment of the couple of rotations.
The arbitrary chosen point M of the body does not occur anywhere in the ﬁnal result,
and this means that the velocity vectors of all points of the body are the same at the time
instant under study; i.e., in the case of a couple of rotations, the body is in instantaneous
translational motion with velocity equal to the moment of the couple of rotations.
The result thus obtained can be generalized to the case of several couples of rotations:
the resulting motion of the body is an instantaneous translational motion with velocity equal
to the vector sum of the moments of couples of rotations.
One can show that
1. A couple of instantaneous rotations can be replaced by another equivalent couple. In
this change, it is necessary that the vector of the moment of the new couple of rotations be
equal to the vector of the moment of the initial couple.
2. Two couples of rotations are equivalent to one couple whose moment is equal to the
vector sum of moments of the initial couples.
It follows from the above that any instantaneous motion of a rigid body can be described
by using a system of sliding angular velocity vectors.

686
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
◮Theorems on sliding vectors. In the theory of sliding vectors, the following theorems
hold:
THEOREM 1. An arbitrary system of sliding vectors can be reduced to an equivalent
system consisting of a sliding vector applied at an arbitrary chosen point P and a couple
of vectors; here the vector is equal to the vector sum of vectors of the system (the resultant
vector of the system), and the vector of the couple moment is equal to the vector sum of
moments of all vectors of the system about the point P (the resultant moment of the system
about the point P).
THEOREM 2. Two systems of sliding vectors are equivalent if, after being referred to
the same point P, their resultant vectors and their resultant moments coincide.
THEOREM 3. If a system of sliding vectors is ﬁrst referred to point P ′ and then to
point P ′′, then the resultant vectors Ω′ and Ω′′ and the moments M′ and M′′ of the resultant
couples are related as
Ω′′ = Ω′ = Ω,
M′′ = M′ + −−−→
P ′′P ′ × Ω′.
THEOREM 4. It follows from Theorem 3 that the following quantities are independent
of the choice of the reference point P:
Ω′′ = Ω′ = Ω,
Ω′ ⋅M′ = Ω′′ ⋅M′′.
Therefore, the resultant vector of the system and the scalar product of the resultant vector
by the resultant moment are called invariants of the system of sliding vectors about the
reference center.
The second invariant with the ﬁrst taken into account can be written in another form:
compΩM′ = compΩM′′;
i.e., the projection of the resultant moment onto the direction of the resultant vector is
independent of the choice of the center of reference.
THEOREM 5. The locus of points of reference with coordinates x, y, z at which the
vectors Ωand M are parallel is the straight line
MOx – (yΩz – zΩy)
Ωx
= MOy – (zΩx – xΩz)
Ωy
= MOz – (xΩy – yΩx)
Ωz
,
(E2.1.6.1)
where Ωx, Ωy, Ωz and MOx, MOy, MOz are the projections onto the Cartesian coordinate
axes Oxyz of the resultant vector Ωand the resultant moment MO about the origin O.
The straight line (E2.1.6.1) is called the screw axis or the central axis, and the pair
consisting of the resultant vector and the parallel vector of the resultant couple is called the
screw.
Thus, just as in Subsection E2.1.4, we conclude that for Ω⋅M ≠0 the motion of the
body can be reduced to instantaneous screw motion.
In special cases (Ω⋅M = 0), there may be states of instantaneous rest (Ω= 0 and M = 0),
of instantaneous translational motion (Ω= 0 and M ≠0), and of rotation about instantaneous
axis (Ω≠0 and M = 0 or M ⊥Ω).

E2.2. Basic Notions and Laws of Mechanics
E2.2.1. Basic Notions of Mechanics
◮Mechanical systems. Forces. A mechanical system is deﬁned to be a set of point
particles in which the position, velocity, and acceleration of any point depend on the
positions, velocities, and accelerations of the other points.
A constrained mechanical system is a system of points with constraints imposed on
their positions and velocities. The material bodies realizing these constraints are called
the mechanical constraints imposed on the mechanical system. The relations between the
coordinates and velocities of points of the system and time are called constraint equations.
A material system is said to be free if there are no mechanical constraints in the system.
The kinematic state of interacting points (bodies) of a mechanical system is changed.
A measure of such interaction is the force, depicted in the ﬁgures as a directed rectilinear
segment. The line of action of the force is the straight line on which this segment lies.
A set of forces distinguished according to some property is called a system of forces and
is denoted by {Fi}.
A system of forces is said to be balanced if, being applied to a free rigid body at rest, it
does not take the body out of this state.
Systems of forces {Fi} and {Gj} are said to be equivalent if, being separately applied
to a free rigid body, they cause the same changes in its kinematic state.
If there exists a force equivalent to a system of forces applied to a rigid body, then it is
called the resultant of the system of forces.
The forces of mechanical constraints acting on points of a system are called constraint
reaction forces. The forces that act on points of a system and are not reaction forces are
called active forces.
◮Moment of force. The moment of a force F about a center (point) P is the vector
MP(F) equal to the cross product of the position vector r drawn from the center to the force
application point by the vector of force, MP (F) = r × F (Fig. E2.18).
Figure E2.18. Moment of the force F about the center (point) P.
The magnitude of the moment of force is equal to the product of the magnitude of force
by its moment arm about the center. The moment arm of a force F about a center P is
the segment of the perpendicular PK drawn from the center to the force action line. The

688
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
vector MP (F) is perpendicular to the plane where the force and the center are located and
is directed so that if we look in the direction opposite to this vector, then it seems that
rotation of the force about the center is anticlockwise (the right-hand screw rule). If the
force is translated along the line of its action, then its moment about the same center does
not change.
If two arbitrary centers P and S are chosen on an axis (for example, on the z-axis), then
compz MS(F) = compz(−→
SP + r) × F = compz MP(F);
i.e., the projection of the moment of a force about a center lying on an axis onto this axis
is independent of the choice of the center. This scalar quantity is called the moment of the
force F about the z-axis and is denoted by Mz(F).
To calculate the moment of force about a given axis, one should
(1) Draw any plane π perpendicular to this axis and mark the point P ′ of their intersec-
tion (Fig. E2.18).
(2) Find the projection F′ of the force onto this plane.
(3) Find the magnitude of the moment of the vector F′ about the center P ′, which is
equal to the product F ′h′.
(4) Supply the obtained quantity with a sign observing the rotation of F′ about P ′ from
the side of positive sense of the axis, so that the positive sign corresponds to anticlockwise
rotation.
The moment of a force about an axis does not vary if the force is transferred along its
line of action. It is zero if the force and the axis are in the same plane; in this case, the line
of action of the force is either parallel to the axis or intersects it.
The moment of a force F about the origin O of a reference frame and the moments of
the force about the coordinate axes are calculated by the formulas
MO(F) = r × F =

i
j
k
x
y
z
Fx Fy
Fz
 = Mx(F) i + My(F) j + Mz(F) k;
Mx(F) = yFz – zFy,
My(F) = zFx – xFz,
Mz(F) = xFy – yFx,
where Fx, Fy, and Fz are projections of the force onto the coordinate axes and x, y, and z
are the coordinates of the force application point.
The resultant vector of a system of forces {Fk} is the vector R equal to the vector sum
of all forces in the system:
R =
n
X
k=1
Fk.
The resultant moment of a system of forces about a center P is the vector MP equal to
the vector sum of the vectors of moments of all forces in the system about the center P:
MP =
n
X
k=1
MP (Fk) =
n
X
k=1
rk × Fk.
Here rk is the position vector drawn from the center P to the point of application of the
force Fk.
◮Couple of forces and its properties. A couple of forces is a system of two forces F′
and F′′ applied to the same rigid body so that they are equal in magnitude, parallel, and
have opposite senses: F′ = –F′′ (Fig. E2.19).

E2.2. BASIC NOTIONS AND LAWS OF MECHANICS
689
Figure E2.19. Couple of forces.
The shortest distance h between the lines of action of the forces in a couple is called
the arm of the couple, and the plane where the forces lie is called the plane of action of the
couple.
Properties of a couple of forces:
1. The resultant vector of a couple of forces is zero.
2. The resultant moment M(F′, F′′) = M of a couple of forces is independent of the
choice of the center and is called the torque of the couple of forces. It is equal to the moment
of one of the forces in the couple about the point of application of the other force. The
torque of a couple of forces is the measure of its mechanical action on a rigid body. Under
the action of a couple of forces, a free rigid body being originally at rest begins to rotate
about the axis parallel to the torque of the couple.
E2.2.2. Basic Laws of Mechanics
◮1. Law of inertia (Newton’s ﬁrst law): if no forces act on a free point particle, then it
preserves the rest state or a uniform rectilinear motion.
◮2. Law of proportionality between force and acceleration (Newton’s second law)
can be written as the vector equation
ma = F,
according to which a force acting on a free point particle causes point acceleration whose
vector is parallel to the force and proportional to its magnitude.
The point mass m enters the second law as a scalar coefﬁcient of proportionality. In
mechanics, the mass is assumed to be constant; it is a measure of inertia and gravitational
properties of a point particle.
The reference frames in which Newton’s ﬁrst and second laws are satisﬁed are called
inertial reference frames. If these laws are not satisﬁed in a reference frame, then it is said
to be noninterial.
◮3. Law of equality of action and reaction (Newton’s third law): to each action, there
corresponds an equal and oppositely directed reaction.
The force actions of some material bodies on other bodies cannot be one-sided; they are
always reciprocal. The forces do not arise by themselves but are the results of contact or
spatial interaction of bodies. The appearance of a force acting on a body assumes that there
is another body, which, in turn, is under the action of a force acting from the ﬁrst body. The
law states that these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and the lines
of their action coincide.
◮4. A system of forces applied to a point has the resultant R∗equal to their vector sum.
A consequence of this law is the following theorem.

690
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
THEOREM (VARIGNON) ON THE MOMENT OF THE RESULTANT OF A SYSTEM OF CON-
VERGING FORCES. The moment of the resultant of a system of converging forces about an
arbitrary center is equal to the vector sum of the moments of forces of the system about the
same center.
◮5. The kinematic state of a constrained mechanical system does not vary if the mechan-
ical constraints imposed on the system are replaced by the constraint reaction forces.
E2.3. Statics
E2.3.1. Basic Laws and Theorems of Statics
◮The problems of statics include
(1) Transforming systems of forces into equivalent systems of forces.
(2) Determining equilibrium conditions for systems of forces acting on a rigid body.
◮Axioms of statics. The general laws of mechanics are supplemented in statics with the
following axioms.
1. Axiom about the balance of two forces applied to a rigid body: two forces applied
to a rigid body are mutually balanced only if the forces have opposite directions along the
common line of action and their magnitudes are equal to each other.
2. Axiom on inclusion and exclusion of balanced systems of forces: the action of a
system of forces on a rigid body does not vary if a balanced system of forces is added to or
removed from the system.
It follows from the last two axioms that a force applied to a rigid body can be transferred
along its line of action, whereby the action of the force on the body remains the same.
3. Axiom on preservation of equilibrium of a mechanical system under the action of
additionally imposed mechanical constraints: if a mechanical system is in equilibrium,
then the equilibrium remains preserved if an additional mechanical constraint is imposed
on the system. In particular, this implies that the equilibrium of a deformed body under the
action of a system of forces is preserved in hardening, because the body hardening process
is equivalent to imposing additional mechanical constraints on the system of point particles
forming the deformed body.
◮Basic theorems of statics. Several formulas. The axioms of statics deﬁne systems of
forces applied to a rigid body as systems of sliding vectors, and therefore, all results of the
theory of sliding vectors remain true for systems of forces.
THEOREM ON EQUIVALENCE OF COUPLES OF FORCES. Two couples of forces are equiv-
alent if their torques coincide.
This means that, without changing the action of a couple on a rigid body, it can be
transferred to any place in the plane of its action; the couple can be turned and the force
magnitudes and the arm can be varied so that the rotation direction and the magnitude of
the couple torque remain constant. A couple can be transferred into another plane parallel
to the initial plane of the couple action. Thus, the main characteristic of a couple is the
vector of its torque, and hence it is more convenient to represent the couple by this vector
rather than by two antiparallel forces.
THEOREM ON THE RESULTANT COUPLE OF FORCES. A system of couples of forces ap-
plied to a rigid body is equivalent to a single couple of forces whose torque is equal to the
vector sum of torques of the original couples.

E2.3. STATICS
691
THEOREM ON THE PARALLEL TRANSFER OF A FORCE. One can transfer a force to any
point of a rigid body without changing its action on the body provided that one simultane-
ously adds a couple of forces (an associated couple) whose torque is equal to the moment
of the force to be transferred about the point where the force is to be transferred.
THEOREM ON REDUCING A SYSTEM OF FORCES TO A CENTER. An arbitrary system of
forces applied to a rigid body is equivalent to a single force applied at an a priori chosen
center P and a single couple of forces. The force is equal to the resultant vector R of the
system of forces, and the torque of the couple is equal to the resultant moment MP of the
system of forces about the chosen center.
THEOREM ON EQUIVALENCE OF SYSTEMS OF FORCES APPLIED TO A RIGID BODY. For
two systems of forces to be equivalent, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that they have equal
resultant vectors and resultant moments about the same center.
If a system of forces is reduced ﬁrst to a point P ′ and then to a point P ′′, then the
resultant vectors R′ and R′′ and the resultant moments M′ and M′′ satisfy the relations
R′′ = R′ = R,
M′′ = M′ + −−−→
P ′′P ′ × R′.
The invariants of a system of forces are the resultant vector and the scalar product of the
resultant vector by the resultant moment of the system; they are independent of the choice
of the reduction center:
R′′ = R′ = R,
R′ ⋅M′ = R′′ ⋅M′′.
The second invariant, with the ﬁrst invariant taken into account, can be represented as
compR M′ = compR M′′.
For R⋅M ≠0, the system of forces can be reduced to a screw (wrench), and the equation
of the screw axis has the form
MOx – (yRz – zRy)
Rx
= MOy – (zRx – xRz)
Ry
= MOz – (xRy – yRx)
Rz
,
where Rx, Ry, Rz and MOx, MOy, MOz are the projections on the Cartesian coordinate
axes Oxyz of the resultant vector R and of the vector MO of the resultant moment about
the origin O.
Thus, just as in Subsection E2.1.4, we conclude that for R ⋅M ≠0 the system of forces
can be reduced to a wrench. The special cases where R ⋅M = 0 include the case of a
balanced system of forces (R = 0 and M = 0), the case of reduction to the resultant couple
of forces (R = 0 and M ≠0), and the case of nonzero resultant force R ≠0.
THEOREM (VARIGNON) ON THE MOMENT OF THE RESULTANT. If a system of forces has a
resultant R∗, then its moment about any center P is equal to the vector sum of the moments
of all forces of the system about the same center:
MP (R∗) =
n
X
k=1
MP(Fk).
Corollary: the moment of the resultant about an arbitrary axis is equal to the algebraic
sum of moments of all forces of the system about the same axis.

E2.3.2. Balance Conditions for a System of Forces Applied to
a Rigid Body
◮Equations of equilibrium of a rigid body. For a system of forces applied to a rigid
body to be balanced, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that its resultant vector and resultant
moment about a center, for example, about the origin O, be zero:
R =
X
k
Fk = 0;
MO =
X
k
MO(Fk) = 0.
(E2.3.2.1)
In coordinate form, the balance conditions for a system of forces applied to a rigid body
are obtained from the vector equations and have the form of the system of six equations

Fkx = 0,

My(Fk) = 0,

Mz(Fk) = 0.
(E2.3.2.2)
This system is called the primary system of equations of equilibrium of a rigid body under
the action of an arbitrary system of forces.
The upper three equations are called the equations of projections of forces onto the
coordinate axes; they reﬂect the fact that if a rigid body is in equilibrium, then the algebraic
sum of projections of all forces applied to the body onto each of the coordinate axes must
be zero. The lower three equations are called the equations of moments of forces about the
coordinate axes. These equations show that if a body is in equilibrium, then the algebraic
sum of moments of all forces acting on the body about each of the coordinate axes must be
zero.
There are other forms of the system of equilibrium equations, different from the primary
system, each of which consists of six equations.
When using them, one should verify
conditions constraining the choice of axes about which the sums of moments of the forces
are calculated.
In each problem on the equilibrium of a rigid body or a structure consisting of several
bodies, in addition to some given quantities, there are quantities that must be determined
when solving the problem. An equilibrium problem is said to be statically determinate if it
can be solved completely by methods of statics. In this case, it is necessary that the number
of unknowns does not exceed the number of equilibrium equations. A problem is said to
be statically indeterminate it if cannot be solved by using the equations of statics alone.
Thus, any equilibrium problem with seven or more unknowns for a single body is a priori
statically indeterminable.
◮Special cases of equilibrium equations for a rigid body. In special cases of arrange-
ment of forces, one or several equations in the primary system can become identities. For
example, (i) if all the forces are perpendicular to the coordinate z-axis, then the equation
for the projections onto the z-axis becomes an identity; (ii) if the lines of action of all forces
intersect the y-axis, then the equation for the moments about the y-axis becomes an identity.
(In these cases, the number of equilibrium equations decreases to ﬁve.)
In what follows, we consider systems of forces whose equilibrium is described by three
equilibrium equations.
A system of forces is said to be converging if the lines of action of the forces intersect
at a single point. We choose the origin at this point. The equations of moments of the main
system become identities, and the remaining three equations

Fkx = 0,

form the system of equilibrium equations.
A system of forces is said to be plane if all the forces lie in the same plane. We direct
the coordinate axes so that all the forces lie in the plane xOy; in this case, the third, fourth,
and ﬁfth equations of the main system become identities, and the remaining three equations

Fkx = 0,
X

Fky = 0,

form a system of equilibrium equations of a plane system of forces. Here the equation of
moments about the z-axis is written in a different equivalent form: the moment vectors
are perpendicular to the plane of action of the forces if the center lies in the same plane.
Therefore, the moment of a force about the center can be viewed as a scalar quantity. In
a right reference frame, the moment is assumed to be positive if the force tends to rotate
anticlockwise about the center.
In the case of a plane system of forces, one can use other forms of equilibrium equations.
One of them is
X
k
Fkx = 0,
X
k
MP (Fk) = 0,
X
k
MS(Fk) = 0,
where P and S are any points of the plane for which the segment PS is not perpendicular
to the x-axis.

MP(Fk) = 0,
X
k
MS(Fk) = 0,
X
k
ME(Fk) = 0,
where P, S, and E are any points on the plane that do not lie on the same straight line.
A system of forces is called a system of parallel forces if the lines of action of the forces
are parallel. Let the z-axis be parallel to the lines of action. The ﬁrst, second, and sixth
equations of the main system become identities, and the remaining equations

E2.3.3. Solution of the Problems of Statics
◮The general scheme of solution of the equilibrium problem for a body (or for
structures consisting of several bodies) includes several stages. One should
1. Choose a body (or a structure) the study of whose equilibrium allows one to determine
the desired quantities. Draw an assumption diagram, i.e., a simpliﬁed ﬁgure that contains
only linear dimensions and angles necessary to solve the problem but does not contain
insigniﬁcant details.
2. In the diagram, draw the active forces given in the assumptions of the problem.
3. In the case of a constrained body, omit the mechanical constraints imposed on it and
replace their action by constraint reactions. After such a change, the body becomes free.
4. Verify whether the necessary condition for the problem to be statically determinate
is satisﬁed: the number of unknowns in the assumption diagram should not exceed the
number of equilibrium equations for the system of forces under study.
5. If this condition is satisﬁed, write out the system of equilibrium equations, solve it,
and study the results.
When solving the problem, it is desirable to follow the above scheme strictly.

694
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Experience shows that errors most frequently creep in when replacing the constraints
by their reaction forces. Consider this issue in more detail.
◮Rules for the alignment of mechanical constraint reaction forces. Every mechanical
constraint is either a body or a mechanical device that imposes some constraints on the
body displacements in space. Depending on the type of the constraint, some displacements
are prohibited and some displacements are allowed.
This permits one to predict some
qualitative characteristics even before calculating the numerical values of the constraint
forces. The rule that one should stick to when replacing the constraints by reaction forces
is the following: the constraint reaction can generally consist of two force factors, namely,
a force applied at the point where the constraint is imposed and a couple of forces.
If a constraint prohibits a translational displacement of the body, then there appears
a reaction force whose direction is opposite to that of the prohibited displacement. If a
constraint prohibits a rotation of the body, then there appears a couple of constraint reaction
forces whose torque is directed along the axis of the prohibited rotation.
◮Some types of mechanical constraints.
1. Perfectly ﬂexible unstretchable massless string. In Fig. E2.20, a string attached to
a rigid body at point B is shown. The constraint in question is imposed at point B, and
since this is a perfectly ﬂexible string, the body is allowed to rotate about any axis passing
through this point. This means that no couple of reaction forces appears in this case.
For this type of constraints, small translational displacements of a body are allowed
in which point B moves on the surface of a sphere of radius BK centered at point K.
Therefore, no reaction force can arise in the direction of allowed displacements.
The
translational displacement of the body in direction KB is prohibited, because the string
is unstretchable. This means that there arises a reaction force NB applied to the body at
point B in the direction of the straight line BK.
2. One aligns reaction forces in a similar way if the constraint is realized either by free
support of two bodies such that the surface of one of them is absolutely smooth (Fig. E2.21)
or by a moving hinge B (Fig. E2.22).
Figure E2.20. Perfectly ﬂexible unstretchable massless string.
3. A ﬁxed hinge A (Fig. E2.22) does not prevent beam AB from rotation about point A;
therefore, no couple of reaction forces appears at point A. The device under study prohibits
any translational displacement; therefore, neither the magnitude nor the direction of the
reaction force RA is known in advance. In this case, RA is usually represented by two
components xA and yA parallel to the coordinate axes.

E2.3. STATICS
695
Figure E2.21. Free support of two bodies.
4. Rigid clamping. The constraint prohibits any translational displacement of the body;
therefore, there arises a constraint reaction force RB whose direction is unknown. It is
usually represented by three components xB, yB, zB parallel to the coordinate axes. Rigid
clamping prohibits rotation about any axis passing through point B; therefore, there arises
a couple of reaction forces whose torque MB is known in advance neither in magnitude nor
in direction. The unknown couple is usually represented by an equivalent system of three
couples whose torques MBx, MBy, MBz are directed along the coordinate axes (Fig. E2.23).
Figure E2.22. Fixed hinge.
Figure E2.23. Rigid clamping.
If several constraints are imposed on a body, then each of them can be investigated
independently of the other constraints and the forces applied to the body.
The unknowns in problems of statics can be not only the constraint reactions but also
angles, linear dimensions of structures, and other parameters.
Example 1. Find the reaction of the rigid clamping B of a bent massless beam BDE (Fig. E2.24a)
subjected to a force F = 20 kN and a couple of forces with torque M = 2 kN m assuming that α = 30◦,
BD = 2 m, and DE = 1 m.
Solution. We follow the general scheme for solving body equilibrium problems.

696
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Figure E2.24. Bent beam with rigidly clamped left end is subjected to a force F and a couple of forces with
torque M: (a) active forces; (b) constraint reaction forces.
1. The reaction of the rigid clamping B can be found by studying the beam equilibrium; therefore, for the
rigid body we take the beam BDE. We separately draw the assumption diagram (Fig. E2.24b).
2. On the diagram, we align the active force factors acting on the beam, i.e., the force F and the couple
of forces M, which we present as a curved arrow in the direction of rotation of the couple. (In our case, the
rotation is clockwise.)
3. The beam is not free, because a constraint is imposed on it; i.e., it is rigidly clamped at point B. We
make the beam free by replacing the constraint with constraint reaction forces. The clamping reaction consists
of a force RB and a couple of forces with torque MB, for both of which neither the magnitude nor the direction
is known.
We introduce the reference frame xy shown in the ﬁgure. Since the direction of the force RB is unknown,
we represent it by two components XB and YB. The unknown couple MB of reaction forces is represented by
the curved arrow. Note that we need not guess the true directions of the components and the curved arrow of
the torque of the couple, because all this will be clear after the problem is solved. (In the assumption diagram,
XB is shown as if it were directed to the left only because this way it is more noticeable in the ﬁgure.)
We replace F by an equivalent system of forces consisting of two components F′ and F′′ parallel to the
coordinate axes,
F = F′ + F′′,
F ′ = F cos α,
F ′′ = F sin α.
4. Now the assumption diagram represents a free beam subjected to forces lying in the same plane. The
system of equilibrium equations consists of three equations. The number of unknowns XB, YB, MB is also
equal to three. This means that the number of unknowns and the number of equations coincide and the necessary
conditions for the problem to be statically determinate are satisﬁed.
5. We use the basic form of equilibrium equations for a plane system of forces, taking the center B as the
moment point.
The mishap most frequently encountered when writing out the equilibrium equations is to forget some
force or couple of forces; therefore, it is recommended to arrange all forces and all couples of forces applied to
the body in a row and then write out the equilibrium equations beneath it:

By substituting the original data, we obtain the solution of the problem:
XB = –17.1 kN,
YB = 10 kN,
MB = 4.9 kN m.
The signs in the answers show that the direction of the component XB is opposite to that shown in the
assumption diagram, while the directions of the component YB and of the curved arrow MB correspond to
those in the diagram.
It is not recommended to redraw XB in the diagram (Fig. E2.24b) with the sign of the answer taken into
account, because should this be done, it would be impossible to verify whether the equations of equilibrium are
composed correctly and interpret the results.
The clamping reaction force RB is the vector sum of the orthogonal components XB and YB; therefore,
its magnitude can be obtained by the formula
RB =

Example 2. A structure consisting of two massless rods BD and DE is shown in Fig. E2.25. The rods
are of the same length 4 m and are hinged to each other and to the base so that BE = BD = 2a. The left
rod BD is loaded by the horizontal force F = 20 kN at the midpoint, and the right rod DE is loaded by the
couple of forces M = 10 kN m. Find the support reactions and the pressure in the intermediate hinge D.
Figure E2.25. Structure consisting of two rods hinged to each other and to the base.
Figure E2.26. Assumption diagram for the two-rod problem.
Solution. We consider the equilibrium of each rod separately, for which we divide the structure into two
parts, namely, the rods BD and DE, and align the active forces and the constraint reactions.
After this, the assumption diagram of the problem acquires the form shown in Fig. E2.26, where the
reference frame is the same for both rods. The force RD acting on the rod BD from the rod ED is represented
by two components XD and YD, and the force R′
D acting from the rod DB on the rod ED is represented
by two components X′
D and Y′
D. Since the action force RD and the reaction force R′
D must satisfy the
action–reaction axiom, it follows that their components also satisfy the relations XD = –X′
D and YD = –Y′
D;
i.e., the components are equal and oppositely directed, and this is already taken into account in the diagram.
The magnitudes of the components satisfy the relations
XD = X′
D,
YD = Y ′
D.
(E2.3.3.1)
All in all, there are eight unknowns XB, YB, XD, YD, X′
D, Y ′
D, XE, and YE. The equilibrium of each
rod is described by three equilibrium equations; together with the last two equations, they form a system of
eight equations with eight unknowns. (The necessary conditions for the problem to be statically determinate
are satisﬁed.)
The equilibrium equations read
for rod BD

k Fkx = XB + XD + F = 0,
P
k Fky = YB + YD = 0,
P
k MB(Fk) = –Fa sin 60◦

By solving this system with (E2.3.3.1) taken into account, we obtain XB = –16.44 kN, YB = –11.16 kN,
XD = X′
D = –3.56 kN, YD = Y ′
D = 11.16 kN, XE = –3.56 kN, and YE = 11.16 kN.

E2.3.4. Center of Parallel Forces. Center of Gravity of a Rigid Body
◮Center of parallel forces. Assume that a rigid body is under the action of a system {Fk}
of parallel forces. The forces can rotate about the points of their application remaining
parallel. Since R⋅MP = 0, it follows that the system has a resultant R∗provided that R ≠0.
One can prove that the line of action of R∗always passes through the same point C of the
body regardless of the force direction. This point is called the center of parallel forces, and
its position in space is determined by the position vector rC,

forces that represent elementary forces of gravity of the material particles comprising the
body. If the body is on Earth’s surface and its dimensions are small compared to Earth’s
radius, then one can assume that the lines of action of the forces of gravity are parallel and
their magnitudes depend only on the body volume V , the material density ρ, and the free
fall acceleration g.
The formulas for ﬁnding the center of gravity read

where γ = γ(x, y, z) = gρ is the speciﬁc weight and G =

V γ dV is the weight of the body.
Similar formulas hold for the center of gravity of a body that has the shape of a surface
or a line.
◮Methods for ﬁnding the center of gravity.
Symmetric bodies. If a body has a plane (axis, center) of material symmetry, then its
center of gravity lies in this plane (on the axis, at the center).
Methodof partition. Assume that a bodyconsists, for example, of three parts (Fig. E2.27)
for each of which we know the weight G1, G2, G3 and the position r1, r2, r3 of the center
of gravity. The position vector r123 of the center of gravity of the body consisting of three
parts and its coordinates are determined by the formulas
r123 = G1r1 + G2r2 + G3r3
G1 + G2 + G3
,
x123 = G1x1 + G2x2 + G3x3
G1 + G2 + G3
,
y123 = G1y1 + G2y2 + G3y3
G1 + G2 + G3
,
z123 = G1z1 + G2z2 + G3z3
G1 + G2 + G3
.
(E2.3.4.3)
Method of negative masses. Now assume that we need to ﬁnd the position of the center
of gravity of a new body consisting of parts 1 and 2 (see Fig. E2.27).

Figure E2.27. Determining the center of gravity of a body consisting of three parts.
The solution can be obtained either by the above formulas if one sets G3 = 0 or by the
formulas that, under certain conditions, can be more convenient:
r12 = Gr123 – G3r3
G – G3
,
x12 = Gx123 – G3x3
G – G3
,
y12 = Gy123 – G3y3
G – G3
,
z12 = Gz123 – G3z3
G – G3
,
where G = G123 = G1 + G2 + G3 is the weight of the body consisting of three parts. The
weight G3 of the cutaway part enters the formulas with negative sign, and just this fact
underlies the name of the method.
In Table E4.1 (Section E4.1), we present formulas for the coordinates of the center of
gravity for homogeneous bodies of simplest shapes.
E2.3.5. Distributed Forces
In practice, one often encounters the cases in which the body is subjected not to lumped
forces but to a load distributed over a volume, surface, or line. The special case of bulk
distribution of the force of gravity was considered in the preceding section. The vector
quantity q characterizing the load is called the load intensity and is measured in N/m3,
N/m2, or N/m.
When solving problems of statics, a distributed load is usually replaced by a simpler
statically equivalent force (or a system of forces).
1. A uniformly distributed load of intensity q (Fig. E2.28) in a plane problem of statics
has the resultant Q = q BD whose line of action passes through the midpoint of the interval
where the load is applied, BE = ED.

E2.3.6. Friction Laws (Coulomb Laws)
◮Law of sliding friction. Consider a body of weight G at rest on a rough horizontal plane
(Fig. E2.30). An attempt to move the body by applying a horizontal force F to it remains
unsuccessful until the force attains a certain magnitude F∗. The resultant of the support
reaction forces can be represented as the sum of two components, the normal pressure
force N and the static friction force Ffr. The equation for the projections of the forces onto
the horizontal axis gives Ffr = F.
Figure E2.30. Friction force arising in an attempt to move a ﬁxed body on a horizontal plane.
Experiments show that F ∗and N satisfy the relation (Coulomb’s dry friction law)
F ∗= f0N,
(E2.3.6.1)
where f0 is the coefﬁcient of static friction, which depends on the materials of the contacting
bodies and the state of their surfaces.
Until F ≤F ∗, the body is at rest. But if a force larger than F ∗is applied to it, the body
begins to move. In motion, the resistance force can be found by the formula
Ffr = fN,
(E2.3.6.2)
where f is the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction and Ffr is the force of kinetic friction.
Note that the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction is always less than the coefﬁcient of static
friction, f < f0.
◮Laws of rolling friction. Consider a disk of radius R at rest on a nonsmooth horizontal
plane (Fig. E2.31). An attempt to roll the disk by applying a horizontal force F to its center
remains unsuccessful if the force magnitude is less than a certain limit value F ∗∗.
Figure E2.31. Friction force arising in an attempt to roll a circular disk.
According to the theorem on the reduction of a system of forces to a center, the support
reaction forces distributed over a small surface near the contact point P can be replaced by
an equivalent system, namely, by the normal pressure force N, the static friction force Ffr
applied at the contact point P, and a couple of friction forces with torque Mfr.
If the disk is in equilibrium, then the equations of moments about the center P imply
FR = Mfr. Experiments show that F ∗∗and N are related by F ∗∗= kN/R and
M∗∗= kN.
(E2.3.6.3)

E2.4. DYNAMICS OF A POINT PARTICLE
701
The dimensional coefﬁcient k [m] is called the coefﬁcient of rolling friction.
A rolling surface is said to be absolutely rough if f ≠0 and k = 0.
Experiments show that, other conditions being equal, F ∗is much larger than F ∗∗
(usually by two or three orders of magnitude), and hence, in technology, if it is necessary
to decrease the friction losses, then one tries to replace sliding by rolling.
E2.4. Dynamics of a Point Particle

Newton’s second law:
ma =

X
k=1
Rk,
(E2.4.1.1)
where m is the mass of the point, a is its acceleration, and the right-hand side of this equation
is the vector sum of all forces applied to the point. The causes of all these forces may be
different. Here we distinguish between active forces Fj and constraint reaction forces Rk.
The active forces can depend on time t and on the position and velocity of the point. The
active forces include the forces of gravity, elasticity, viscous friction, aerohydrodynamic
drag, etc.
The constraint reaction forces act on a nonfree point particle whose motion is subjected
to some mechanical constraints. These forces can only be determined in the course of
solution of the problem of dynamics.
We take the Cartesian axes of an inertial reference frame x, y, z, project the vector
equality (E2.4.1.1) onto these axes, and obtain

E2.4.2. First and Second Problems of Dynamics
In the equations of motion (see Subsection E2.4.1), unknowns can occur on both left- and
right-hand sides. Depending on this, the problems of dynamics are divided into two types,
which we consider below.
◮The ﬁrst problem of dynamics. The law of motion and the active forces are given, and
one needs to ﬁnd the constraint reaction forces.
Example 1. A load of weight G to which a certain initial velocity was imparted at time t0 = 0 ascends
an inclined rough plane (Fig. E2.32). Find the friction force Ffr and the normal pressure force N acting on
the body under the assumption that the coefﬁcient f of friction of the plane and the angle α of inclination are
known.
Figure E2.32. Motion of a load on an inclined rough plane.
Solution. We introduce Cartesian coordinate axes and place the origin O at the load position at time t = 0.
Let us draw the load in an arbitrary position and the forces acting on it. Under the assumption that the load is a
point particle, we write out Newton’s second law
ma = G + N + Ffr.
By projecting both sides of this vector equation onto the y-axis, we obtain 0 = –G cos α + N (because the load
acceleration is parallel to the x-axis), whence we ﬁnd N = G cos α. Further, using the Coulomb law, we obtain
the friction force Ffr = fN = fG cos α.
◮The second problem of dynamics. The active forces, the mechanical constraint equa-
tions, the initial position of the point, and its initial velocity are given, and one needs to ﬁnd
the law of motion of the point and the constraint reaction.
It is recommended to solve the second problem of dynamics successively in several
stages listed below.
1. The supposed trajectory of motion is drawn with the point particle shown on it.
2. The forces applied to the point are drawn.
3. Newton’s second law is written in vector form.
4. A convenient reference frame is chosen.
5. The equations of motion of the point are written in projections on either the axes of
the Cartesian coordinate system or the axes of the natural trihedron. In the ﬁrst case, it is
necessary to express all active forces in terms of t, x, y, z, ˙x, ˙y, and ˙z; in the second case,
in terms of t, s, ˙s.
6. The obtained differential equations are supplemented with the initial conditions, i.e.,
the values of the coordinates and projections of the velocity of the point at the initial time
instant. (They are taken from the conditions of the problem with the introduced reference
frame taken into account.)
7. The problem thus posed is solved numerically or analytically.
It is recommended to perform these stages of solution without changing their order.
Example 2. In addition to the conditions of the problem in Example 1, it is assumed that the velocity of
the load at time t∗is equal to half the initial velocity. Find the initial velocity v0 of the load and the path L
traveled in time t∗.

E2.5. GENERAL THEOREMS OF DYNAMICS OF A MECHANICAL SYSTEM
703
Solution. Continuing the process of solving the problem in Example 1, we project both sides of the vector
equation onto the x-axis. Using the formulas G = mg and Ffr = fG cos α, we obtain
¨x = – g (sin α + f cos α).
The general solution of the obtained differential equation and the expression for the velocity of the load
are given by the formulas
x = – 1
2 g (sin α + f cos α)t2 + C1t + C2,
˙x = – g (sin α + f cos α)t + C1.
(The details of their derivation are omitted, and their correctness can be veriﬁed by differentiation.)
The last two relations must hold at any time instant t and hence at the initial time t0 = 0 and at time t∗;
i.e., the relations are satisﬁed if, instead of t, x, and ˙x, we ﬁrst substitute the values 0, 0, v0 and then the values
t∗, L, v0/2. After the substitutions, we obtain the system of four equations
0 = C2,
v0 = C1,
L = – 1
2 g (sin α + f cos α)(t∗)2 + C1t∗+ C2,
1
2 v0 = – g (sin α + f cos α)t∗+ C1
with four unknowns C1, C2, v0, L. By solving this system, we obtain the desired quantities
v0 = 2g (sin α + f cos α)t∗,
L = 3
2 g (sin α + f cos α)(t∗)2.
E2.5. General Theorems of Dynamics of a Mechanical
System
It is often possible to ﬁnd important characteristics of motion of a mechanical system
without integrating the system of differential equations of motion. This can be done by
using general theorems of dynamics.
E2.5.1. Basic Notions and Deﬁnitions
◮Internal and external forces. Any force acting on a point of a mechanical system is
necessarily either an active force or a constraint reaction. The entire set of forces acting
on the points of the system can also be divided into two classes in a different way: one
distinguishes between the external forces Fe and the internal forces Fi. The external forces
are the forces acting on the points of the system from points and bodies that are not contained
in the system under study. The internal forces are the forces of interaction between the
points and bodies contained in the system under study.
This distinctiondepends on what point particles andbodies are includedbythe researcher
into the mechanical system under study. If the system is extended by including additional
points and bodies, then some forces that were external for the original system can become
internal for the extended system.
◮Properties of internal forces. Since these forces are forces of interaction between parts
of the system, they are contained in the total system of internal forces in “pairs” formed
according to the action–reaction axiom. For each of such “pairs” of forces, the resultant
vector and the resultant moment about an arbitrary point are zero. Since the complete
system of internal forces consists only of “pairs,” it follows that
1. The resultant of the system of internal forces is zero.
2. The resultant moment of the system of internal forces about an arbitrary point is zero.

704
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
The mass m of the system is the arithmetic sum of masses mk of all points and bodies
that form the system,
m =
X
k
mk.
◮The center of mass (center of inertia) of a mechanical system is the geometric point C
whose position vector rC and whose coordinates xC, yC, zC are determined by the following
formulas similar to the formulas for the center of parallel forces (see Subsection E2.3.4):
rC =
P
k mkrk
m
,
xC =
P
k mkxk
m
,
yC =
P
k mkyk
m
,
zC =
P
k mkzk
m
,
where rk, xk, yk, zk are the position vectors and the coordinates of the points comprising
the system.
For a rigid body in a homogeneous ﬁeld of gravity, the positions of the center of mass
and the center of gravity coincide; in other cases, these are different geometric points.
Along with an inertial reference frame, one often considers a noninertial reference frame
moving translationally. Its coordinate axes Cx∗y∗z∗(the K¨onig axes) are chosen so that
the origin C constantly coincides with the center of mass of the mechanical system. By
deﬁnition, the center of mass is stationary in the K¨onig axes and is located at the origin.
◮Moments of inertia. In the space, we choose a plane Π, an axis l, and a point O. The
distances from a point of mass mk to Π, l, and O are denoted by the symbols δk, ∆k, and rk,
respectively. Consider the positive expressions
IΠ =
X
k
mkδ2
k,
Ill =
X
k
mk∆2
k,
IO =
X
k
mkr2
k,
where the sum is taken over all the points of the system. These expressions are called
the moments of inertia about the plane Π, the axis l, and the point O. In the Cartesian
coordinate axes x, y, z with origin at point O, the moments of inertia satisfy the relations
Ixx = IyOx + IxOz,
Iyy = IzOy + IyOx,
Izz = IxOz + IzOy,
IO = IxOy + IyOz + IzOx = 1
2 (Ixx + Iyy + Izz).
Consider a ray l passing through the origin O with direction cosines α, β, γ (Fig. E2.33).
The squared distance ∆k from the point of mass mk with coordinates xk, yk, zk to the ray
is equal to
∆2 = (x2 + y2 + z2)(α2 + β2 + γ2) – (xα + yβ + zγ)2.
(To be concise, we omit the subscript k.)
The moment of inertia Ill of a material system about the ray is equal to
Ill =
X
m∆2 = Ixxα2 + Iyyβ2 + Izzγ2 – 2Iyzβγ – 2Izxγα – 2Ixyαβ.

Figure E2.33. Moments of inertia of a point particle with mass mk about the ray l.
are called the centrifugal moments of inertia; they can take both positive and negative
values.
On the ray l at a distance 1/√Ill from the origin, we mark a point with coordinates
X = α/√Ill, Y = β/√Ill, and Z = γ/√Ill. The equation of the geometric locus of such
points with (E2.5.1.1) taken into account has the form
IxxX2 + IyyY 2 + IzzZ2 – 2IyzY Z – 2IzxZX – 2IxyXY = 1.
Since the points of the system occupy a bounded domain in space, it follows that the last
relation is the equation of an ellipsoid. It is called the ellipsoid of inertia of the system with
respect to the point O. The principal axes of this ellipsoid are called the principal axes of
inertia with respect to point O. In these axes, the centrifugal moments of inertia are zero.
If the principal axes of inertia are taken for the coordinate axes, then the expression for
the moment of inertia acquires the form
Ill = Aα2 + Bβ2 + Cγ2,
where A = Ixx, B = Iyy, and C = Izz.
The principal axes of inertia passing through the center of mass of the system are called
the principal central axes of inertia.
If a mechanical system is a rigid body, then the summation in the above formulas should
be replaced by the integration over the volume V occupied by the body. For example,
IxOy =
ZZZ
V
ρz2 dx dy dz,
where ρ = ρ(x, y, z) is the body density.
Table E2.1 presents formulas for calculating the moments of inertia of several ﬁgures.
THEOREM (HUYGENS). The moments of inertia about parallel axes one of which passes
through the center of mass C are related by
Izz = ICz + md2,
where Izz and ICz are moments of inertia about parallel axes z and Cz, the axis Cz passes
through the center of mass, d is the distance between the axes, and m is the mass of the
system.
It follows from the Huygens theorem that ICz ≤Izz.

E2.5.2. Theorem on the Motion of the Center of Mass
◮Statement of the theorem and some comments.
THEOREM. The center of mass of a mechanical system moves as a point particle with
mass m equal to the mass of the system would move under the action of external forces
applied to the system:
mac =
X
k
Fe
k,
(E2.5.2.1)
where m is the mass of the system and ac is the acceleration of the center of mass.
The mathematical statement of the theorem is similar to that of Newton’s second law.
Let us explain the statement of the theorem in more detail. In motion of the system, its
center of mass moves along a certain trajectory. We assume, for example, that at time t0
the system is in position B and has a velocity vc0. Now if a point of mass m is placed
in position B at time t0, the velocity vc0 is imparted to it, and forces equal to the external
forces acting on the system are applied to this point, then the point will move together with
the center of mass of the system along the same trajectory with the same velocity and the
same acceleration.
The vector equation implies the differential equations of motion of the center of mass
in projections onto the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system:
m¨xc =
X
k
F e
kx,
m¨yc =
X
k
F e
ky,
m¨zc =
X
k
F e
kz.
◮Law of conservation of the velocity of the center of mass of a mechanical system:
if the resultant vector of external forces acting on a system is zero, then the center of mass
of the system moves at a constant velocity; i.e., if P
k Fe
k = 0, then vc = const.
Note that in this case the velocity vector itself (rather than its magnitude) is constant,
and hence the center of mass will move uniformly and rectilinearly.
If the projection of the resultant vector of external forces of the system onto an axis is
zero, then the projection of the velocity of the center of mass of the system onto this axis
remains constant. For example, if P
k Fkx = 0, then vcx = const.
Example. Under the action of the force of gravity, a homogeneous disk of mass m2 rolls down the lateral
face of a prism of mass m1 located on a smooth horizontal plane (Fig. E2.34). The angle between the lateral
face and the prism base is α. At the initial time, the velocities of the prism and the disk are zero. Find the
distance s1 traveled by the prism as the disk center travels the distance s2 along the face.
Figure E2.34. Rolling of a disk on the lateral face of a prism.
Solution. Consider the mechanical system consisting of the prism and the disk and draw the external
forces, i.e., the active forces of gravity G1 and G2 and the reaction force N1 of the smooth plane. A typical
characteristic of the system of external forces is that all of them are perpendicular to the horizontal axis, and
hence the sum of their projections onto this axis is zero.

708
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
We direct the x-axis horizontally from left to right and place its origin at the point O. In Fig. E2.34, we
draw the system in two positions, the initial position I and position II (drawn by dashed lines) of the system at
the time by which the disk has traveled the distance s2 along the prism face. Since the direction and magnitude
of the prism displacement are unknown in advance, we put position II on the right of the initial position I
without hesitation.
Since P
k F e
kx = 0, it follows from the conservation law for the projection of the velocity of the system
center of mass onto the x-axis that vcx = const. Since all velocities are zero in position I, we have vcx = 0. It
follows that xc = const, or xI
c = xII
c . We use the formulas for the coordinates of the center of mass to rewrite the
last relation as
m1xI
1 + m2xI
2
m1 + m2
= m1xII
1 + m2xII
2
m1 + m2
.
Here xI
1 and xI
2 are the coordinates of the centers of mass of the prism and the disk in position I, and xII
1 and xII
2
are the respective quantities in position II.
It follows from Fig. E2.34 that xII
1 = xI
1 + s1 and xII
2 = xI
2 + s1 + s2 cos α. By substituting these relations
into the formula and by performing algebraic manipulations, we obtain s1 = – m2s2 cos α
m1 + m2 .
The sign of the answer shows that the prism displacement is opposite to that shown in the ﬁgure.
E2.5.3. Theorem on the Momentum
◮Momentum. The momentum of a point of mass m moving at a velocity v is the vector
Q = mv.
The momentum of a mechanical system is the resultant of momenta of all points of the
system,
Q =
X
k
Qk.
One can prove that the momentum of a system is equal to the momentum of a ﬁctitious
point particle with mass equal to the mass of the system and velocity equal to the velocity
of the center of mass, Q = mvc.
◮Impulse of force. Suppose that a force F is applied to a moving point particle. (Along
with this force, any other forces can act on the particle, but for now we consider only one
of them.)
The elementary impulse of force F in an elementary time interval dt is the vector
d S = F dt.
The impulse of force F in a ﬁnite time interval from t0 to t is the vector
S =
Z t
t0
d S =
Z t

F dt.
The projections of the impulse of force onto the coordinate axes can be calculated by
the formulas

Example. On a smooth horizontal plane, a rectangular parallelepiped of mass m1 moves at a velocity v0,
and on the upper face of this parallelepiped, there are two propulsion devices with masses m2 and m3
(Fig. E2.35). At some time instant, the devices begin to move towards each other, and the laws of their motion
with respect to the parallelepiped are determined by the functions s2 = h2t3 and s3 = h3t3. Find how the velocity
of the parallelepiped depends on time.

MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
Solution. Consider the system consisting of the three bodies (the parallelepiped and the propulsion de-
vices). Let us draw the external forces, namely, the active forces of gravity G1, G2, and G3 and the plane
reaction N. All of them are vertical, and hence we can apply the law of conservation of the system momentum
projection onto the x-axis; i.e., we write out Qx0 at time t0 and Qx at an arbitrary time t and equate the obtained
quantities with each other:
Qx0 = m1v0 + m2v0 + m3v0,
Qx = m1v1 + m2(v1 + ˙s2) + m3(v1 – ˙s3).
In the last expression, the velocities of the propulsion devices were calculated according to the theorem on
the velocities in the compound motion of a point. By equating the right-hand sides of these equations and by
performing algebraic manipulations, we obtain
v1 = v0 – 3t2(m2h2 – m3h3)
m1 + m2 + m3
.
E2.5.4. Theorem on the Angular Momentum
◮Moment of momentum and the angular momentum. The moment of momentum of
a point particle about a ﬁxed center P is the vector KP equal to the cross product of the
position vector connecting the center with the point by the momentum of the point:
KP = MP (Q) = r × mv.
The angular momentum (the net moment of momentum) of a mechanical system about
the center P is the vector sum of moments of momenta of all points of the system about the
center:
KP =
X
j
KP j.
The moment of momentum of a point about the x-axis is the quantity Kx equal to the
projection onto this axis of the moment of momentum of the point about any center P
belonging to the axis,
Kx = Mx(Q).
The angular momentum of a system about the x-axis is the projection onto this axis of
the angular momentum of the system about any center P belonging to the axis:
Kx =
X
j
Kjx.
The analytic expression for the angular momentum of a system about the coordinate
x-axis has the form
Kx =
X
j
mj(yj ˙zj – ˙yjzj).
The formulas for Ky and Kz are similar.
One can show that the angular momentum of a system about a ﬁxed center P is equal
to the sum of the moment of momentum of the center of mass about the center P and the
angular momentum of the system about the center of mass C in its relative motion in the
K¨onig system,
KP = KP + K∗
C.
Here KP = MP (mvC) and K∗
C is the angular momentum of the system in its motion with
respect to the K¨onig reference frame.
The angular momentum Kz of a rigid body rotating about the ﬁxed z-axis with angular
velocity ω is calculated by the formula
Kz = Izzω,
where Izz is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the z-axis.
The angular momentum of a rigid body is discussed in more detail in Section E2.8.

E2.5. GENERAL THEOREMS OF DYNAMICS OF A MECHANICAL SYSTEM

◮Theorem on angular momentum of a mechanical system.
THEOREM. The time derivative of the angular momentum about any ﬁxed center P is
equal to the resultant moment of external forces of the system about the same center,
dKP
dt
=
X
j
MP (Fe
j).
(E2.5.4.1)
Projecting the vector expression onto the coordinate axes (e.g., on the x-axis), we obtain
the theorem on the angular momentum of the system about a ﬁxed axis:
dKx
dt
=
X
j
Mx(Fe
j).
If this theorem is used to study the motion of a rigid body rotating about a ﬁxed axis z,
then we obtain the differential equation of rotational motion of a rigid body about a ﬁxed
axis:
Izz ¨ϕ =
X
j
Mz(Fe
j),
where ϕ is the rotation angle.
◮Law of conservation of angular momentum. The law is stated as follows: if the
resultant moment of external forces acting on a system about a center P is zero, then the
net moment of momentum about this center is constant. For example,
if
P
j MP (Fe
j) = 0,
then
KP = const.
The right-hand side of this relation contains a vector constant; i.e., neither the magnitude
nor the direction of the vector depends on time.
If the sum of moments of external forces acting on the system about some ﬁxed axis
is zero, then the angular momentum of the system about this axis remains constant. For
example,
if
P
j Mx(Fe
j) = 0,
then
Kx = −−−→
const.
Example 1. A point particle moves under the action of a system of forces {Fk} so that the line of action
of the resultant R∗passes through a ﬁxed center O. (We take it for the origin of the reference frame.) Let us
ﬁnd several characteristics of motion of the point.
Since P
k MO(Fk) = MO(R∗) = 0, it follows that KO = −−→
const, or r × mv = −−→
const.
Taking the scalar products of both sides of the last relation by r, we obtain r⋅−−→
const =0, or C1x+C2y+C3z =0,
where x, y, z are the coordinates of the moving point and C1, C2, C3 are the coordinates of the vector constant.
The last expression is the equation of a plane passing through the center O, and this means that the trajectory
of the point lies in that plane.
Example 2. A massless string with a load of weight G2 at the end is wound on a homogeneous drum of
weight G1 and radius R (Fig. E2.36). Find the acceleration of the load neglecting the friction forces in the
rotation of the drum and assuming that the string unwinds from the drum without slip.
Solution. Let the system consist of the drum, the load, and the string. We draw the external forces, namely,
the active forces of gravity G1 and G2 and the reaction force NO passing through the rotation axis O. The
direction of the force NO is unknown in advance, therefore we draw it arbitrarily. There is no couple of friction
forces on the axis, which follows from the assumptions of the problem.
We apply the theorem on the variations in the angular momentum of a system about the drum rotation axis:

E2.5.5. Theorem on the Kinetic Energy
◮Elementary work. Consider a point B moving under the action of a system of forces.
A small displacement of the point along the trajectory is characterized by the vector dr
(Fig. E2.37). We distinguish one force F in the system.
Figure E2.37. Elementary work of the force F on the displacement dr.
The elementary work of the force F on the displacement dr is the scalar quantity d′A
equal to the scalar product of the vectors F and dr:
d′A = F ⋅dr = F dr cos α.
In coordinate form, the elementary work is calculated by the formula
d′A = Fx dx + Fy dy + Fz dz,
where Fx, Fy, Fz and dx, dy, dz are the coordinates of the vectors F and dr, respectively,
in the Cartesian coordinate system.
Note that the elementary work d′A need not be the total differential of a function
depending on the coordinates. (This fact is also reﬂected in the above representation.)
The sign of the elementary work is determined by the cosine of the angle α: it is positive
for 0 ≤α < π/2, negative for π/2 < α ≤π, and zero for α = π/2.

E2.5. GENERAL THEOREMS OF DYNAMICS OF A MECHANICAL SYSTEM
713
◮Calculation of elementary work in special cases.
1. The elementary work of a force applied to a rigid body rotating about a ﬁxed axis z
is calculated by the formula
d′A = ±Mz(F) dϕ.
2. The sum of elementary works of a couple of forces applied to a body in arbitrary
motion is calculated by the formula d′A = (M ⋅ω) dt, and in the cases of rotation about a
ﬁxed axis and of plane motion, it can be calculated as follows:
d′A = ±M dϕ.
Here M is the torque of a couple of forces, and dϕ is the angle of rotation of the body. The
plus sign is taken if the sense of the curved arrows of the couple torque coincides with the
sense of rotation, and the minus sign is taken if they are opposite. (It is assumed that the
plane in which the couple acts is parallel to the base plane.)
3. When calculating the elementary work of friction forces applied to a body rolling
without slip, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the following forces act at the
point of tangency P (Fig. E2.31): the normal pressure force N, the friction force Ffr, and
the couple of rolling friction forces with torque Mfr = Nk. Since there is no slip, so that
the point of tangency is the instantaneous center of velocities and its velocity vP is zero, it
follows that dr = vP dt = 0, which implies that
d′AN = dAfr = 0,
d′AM = –Mfr dϕ = –Nk dϕ.
In rolling on an ideally rough surface, d′AM = 0, because Mfr = 0.
4. One can prove that the sum of elementary works of forces applied to a rigid body
is equal to the sum of elementary works of a statically equivalent system of forces. By
the theorem on reducing a system of forces to a given center, an arbitrary system of forces
can be replaced by an equivalent system consisting of a force R applied at an a priori
chosen point P and a couple of forces with torque MP . Therefore, instead of cumbersome
calculations of the sum of elementary works of many forces applied to a body, one usually
calculates the sum of elementary works of a single force and a single couple.
Example 1. A system of elementary forces of gravity acting on a rigid body always has the resultant equal
to the body weight G applied at the center of gravity C. Therefore, the sum of elementary works of the forces
of gravity is equal to the elementary work of the force of weight on the displacement of the center of gravity of
the body.
Example 2. The sum of elementary works of internal forces applied to points of a rigid body is zero,
because the resultant vector and the resultant moment of the system of internal forces are zero.
◮Work of a force. Potential force. The work of a force F on a ﬁnite displacement of a
point along a trajectory DE (Fig. E2.37) is given by the curvilinear integral
A =

A force ﬁeld is a part of space where a point particle is under the action of a force F
depending on the position of the point and the time, F = F(r, t), where r is the position
vector of the point. A force ﬁeld is said to be nonstationary (transient) if the force explicitly
depends on time and stationary if the force is independent of time.
In what follows, we deal only with stationary force ﬁelds, where F = F(r). In this case,
the projections of the force on the coordinate axes are functions of the coordinates of the
point, Fx = Fx(x, y, z), Fy = Fy(x, y, z), and Fz = Fz(x, y, z).

714
MECHANICS OF POINT PARTICLES AND RIGID BODIES
In the general case, the work of a force depends on the shape of the trajectory along
which the point moves. But there are force ﬁelds in which the work depends only on the
endpoints of the trajectory. One can show that in these cases the elementary work is the
total differential of a function, d′A = dU(x, y, z), and
Fx = ∂U
∂x ,
Fy = ∂U
∂y ,
Fz = ∂U
∂z .
Such a force ﬁeld is said to be potential, and the function U is called the force function or
the potential of the ﬁeld.
Examples of potential forces are as follows:
1. The force of gravity G; the expression for its work is given by the formula A = G ∆H,
where G is the weight of a point particle and ∆H is the height difference between the initial
and ﬁnal points of the trajectory.
2. The expression for the sum of works of forces applied to the ends of a weightless
linearly elastic spring of rigidity γ is given by the formula A = – γ(λ2
e –λ2
s)/2, where L is the
spring current length, l is its length in the unstrained state, λ = L – l is the length variation,
λe corresponds to the terminal state of the spring, and λs corresponds to the initial state.
The function Π(x, y, z) = – U + const is called the potential energy of the ﬁeld, and the
function E = T + Π is called the total mechanical energy. The potential energy of a point
particle is equal to the work of forces of the potential ﬁeld in the transition from the current
state of the point into the zero state. For the zero state we can take any state because of the
constant contained in the deﬁnition.
◮Kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a point of mass m moving at a velocity v is the
scalar quantity T determined by the formula
T = mv2

.
The kinetic energy of a mechanical system is the sum of the kinetic energies of all its
points:
T =

Tk =

One can prove that the kinetic energy of a system is equal to the sum of the kinetic

◮Various statements of the theorem on the kinetic energy.

(E2.5.5.2)
THEOREM ON THE KINETIC ENERGY IN INTEGRAL FORM. The variation in the kinetic
energy of a mechanical system on a certain displacement is equal to the sum of works of all

Aj.
Remark. In contrast to the three above-considered theorems on the dynamics of a system, the last theorem
is characterized by the following speciﬁc features:
(1) The theorem on the variation in the kinetic energy relates scalar quantities rather than vector quantities.
(2) Both statements of the theorem contain works of all forces, not only external but also internal. (It is
also possible to divide the sum of works into the sum of works of active forces and constraint reaction forces.)
(3) The sum of works of internal forces applied to the points of a rigid body is zero.
Example 3. A homogeneous disk under the action of the force of weight G rolls down without slip on an
ideally rough plane inclined at an angle α to the horizon (Fig. E2.38). Find the acceleration of the disk center,
the friction force magnitude, and the minimum value f ∗of the coefﬁcient of friction at which a rolling motion
without slip is possible.
Figure E2.38. Rolling of a disk down an inclined plane under the action of the force of weight.

Here we have taken into account the fact that ICC = 1

Let us write out the statement of the theorem on the motion of the center of mass of a system as applied to
the problem under study:
maC = G + N + Ffr.
We project the obtained vector equation onto two perpendicular axes the ﬁrst of which is parallel to the
normal reaction force N:
0 = –G cos α + N,
maC = G sin α – Ffr.

A mechanical system whose points are only subjected to potential forces is said to be
conservative.
The law of conservation of the total mechanical energy states that the total mechanical
energy of a conservative system remains constant, E = T + Π = T0 + Π0 = const.
E2.6. Elements of Analytical Mechanics
E2.6.1. D’Alembert’s Principle
◮Forces of inertia. Assume that a point of a material system moves under the action of
some system of forces (these forces can be divided either into external and internal forces or
into active forces and constraint reaction forces). The resultant of this system of converging
forces will be denoted by F.
The force of inertia of a point is the vector Φ equal and opposite to the product of the
mass of the point by its acceleration,
Φ = –ma.
The force Φ is ﬁctitious; it is not an actual force acting on the point.
D’Alembert’s principle: in the motion of a mechanical system (point), any of its states
can be considered as an equilibrium if the real forces acting on each point of the system are
supplemented with the ﬁctitious forces of inertia.
According to this principle, if each point of the system is supplemented with the force
Φj = –mjaj, then the system of forces consisting of the real forces Fj and the ﬁctitious
forces Φj satisﬁes all the equations of statics; i.e., the resultant vector of the system of
forces and its resultant moment about an arbitrary center P are zero:
X
Fj +

Φj = 0,
X
MP (Fj) +

MP (Φj) = 0.

Mz(Φj) = 0.
D’Alembert’s principle allows one to transfer the methods for solving problems of
statics to problems of dynamics.
Example 1. A load of weight G is in an elevator cabin ascending in decelerated motion with acceleration a
(Fig. E2.39). Find the pressure exerted by the elevator cabin ﬂoor on the load.
Solution. We assume that the load is a point particle and draw the real forces acting on it: the active force
of weight G and the force N of ﬂoor pressure on the load. We supplement these forces with the ﬁctitious force
of inertia Φ = –ma. (Note that the force Φ in the ﬁgure is opposite not to the elevator displacement but to the
acceleration vector.)
The obtained system of three forces G, N, and Φ is in equilibrium according to d’Alembert’s principle.
The lines of action of all the forces are directed along a single straight line, and hence the equilibrium of the
system of forces is described by the single equation
–G + N + Φ = 0.

E2.6. ELEMENTS OF ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
717
Figure E2.39. Ascent of an elevator with a load.
We substitute the magnitude ma = G
g a of the force of inertia (where g is the free fall acceleration) for Φ and
obtain N = G(g – a). One can see that the ﬂoor pressure force is less than the weight of the load.
The system of forces of inertia can be very cumbersome in the case of numerous point
particles or distributed masses. Using the theorem of statics on reducing a system of forces
to a center, one can replace the system of forces Φj of inertia by an equivalent system
consisting of a single force Φ applied at a center P given in advance (it is equal to the
resultant vector of forces of inertia, Φ = P Φj, and is independent of the choice of the
center) and by a single couple of forces whose torque MΦ
P is equal to the net moment of
forces of inertia about the center, MΦ
P = P MP (Φj).
One can show that Φ is calculated by the formula
Φ = –maC,
where m is the mass of the system and aC is the acceleration of the center of mass.
◮Formulas for the moment of forces of inertia of a body. Some useful formulas for
the net moment of forces of inertia of a rigid body and its projections onto the coordinate
axes are given below:
1. MΦ
C = 0 in translational motion.
2. MΦ
z = –Izzε in rotation about the ﬁxed z-axis.
3. MΦ
C = –ICCε in plane-parallel motion.
Here ε is the angular acceleration of the body, and Izz and ICC are the moments of inertia of
the body about the z-axis and the axis passing through the center of mass and perpendicular
to the base plane. (The minus signs in the formula mean that the senses of the angular
acceleration and the torque of the couple of forces of inertia are opposite.)
Example 2. A homogeneous disk of radius r rolls without slip up a circular arc of radius R (Fig. E2.40).
The coefﬁcient of rolling friction is k. Find the acceleration of the disk center and the force of disk pressure on
the support at the time instant when the velocity of the disk center is v0 and the angle between the vertical line
and the straight line connecting the centers of the disk and of the arc is α.
Solution. The acceleration of the disk center consists of two components aτ
C and an
C, where the direction
of aτ
C is unknown in advance and an
C = v2
0/(R – r). In the no-slip case, we have aτ
C = εr, where ε is the angular
acceleration of the disk.
We reduce the forces of inertia of the disk to the center of mass and decompose the force of inertia into
two components, Φ = Φτ + Φn, where Φτ = –maτ
C and Φn = –man
C. The torque of the couple of forces of
inertia has the magnitude M Φ
C = Iccε = mraτ
C/2, and the corresponding curved arrow is opposite to the curved
arrow of the assumed angular acceleration.
The system of forces in Fig. E2.40 is in equilibrium because of d’Alembert’s principle. Let us write out
the equations of equilibrium for a plane system of forces:
Ffr + Φτ – G sin α = 0,

E2.6.2. Classiﬁcation of Mechanical Constraints.
Generalized Coordinates
◮Classiﬁcation of mechanical constraints. Mechanical constraints are devices (bodies)
imposing restrictions on the positions and velocities of points of a mechanical system. These
restrictions are always satisﬁed regardless of the given forces and are written as relations
called the constraint equations.
Stationary constraints are constraints independent of time; constraints depending on
time are said to be nonstationary.
Constraints whose equations contain the coordinates of points and time are said to be
geometric; constraints are said to be kinematic (differential) if the constraint equations
contain not only the coordinates and time, but also the velocities of points.
If a kinematic constraint can be represented as an equivalent geometric constraint, then it
is said to be kinematic integrable. Otherwise, if a constraint equation cannot be represented
as a geometric constraint in principle, then it is called a nonintegrable constraint.
Geometric and kinematic integrable constraints are said to be holonomic, and kinematic
nonintegrable constraints are said to be nonholonomic. A mechanical system is said to be
holonomic if only holonomic constraints are imposed on it and nonholonomic if there is at
least one nonholonomic constraint.
Constraints are said to be bilateral if the restrictions imposed by them on the positions
of points, their velocity, and time, can be written as equalities. Unilateral constraints are
written as inequalities.

E2.6. ELEMENTS OF ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
719
◮Virtual displacement of a point. A virtual displacement of a point of a mechanical
system is any displacement δr admitted by the imposed constraints from the position
occupied by the point at a given time instant. (When constructing such displacements, one
should “freeze” the time, so that the nonstationary constraints become ﬁxed, i.e., stationary.)
The point does not actually perform virtual displacements but could do so without violating
the constraints at a given time instant.
A virtual displacement of a system is an arbitrary set of virtual displacements δrj of the
points of the system admitted by all constraints imposed on it. By way of example, consider
a point subjected to a nonstationary constraint given by a plane translationally moving at a
velocity v (Fig. E2.41). According to the theorem on the compound motion of a point, its
actual displacement dr is equal to the vector sum of the relative displacement δr and the
translational displacement v dt. The ﬁgure illustrates the difference between the actual and
virtual displacements of a point.
Figure E2.41. Virtual displacement of a point on a moving plane.
For stationary constraints, the actual displacements of points are contained in the set of
virtual displacements.
A mechanical system can have quite a few various virtual displacements.
But for
systems consisting of material rigid bodies and ﬁnitely many point particles there exist
several mutually independent virtual displacements in terms of which one can express any
other virtual displacement. The number of independent displacements is called the number
of degrees of freedom of the mechanical system.
◮Generalized coordinates. Generalized coordinates are independent parameters that
uniquely determine the position of each point of a mechanical system. There are as many
degrees of freedom in a holonomic system as there are generalized coordinates, but this is
not true for nonholonomic systems, which have fewer degrees of freedom than generalized
coordinates.
Consider several speciﬁc examples.
1. A free point particle in space is a system with three degrees of freedom.
2. A free rigid body has six degrees of freedom. Indeed, the position of any point of
the body in space can be determined if the positions of three points B1, B2, B3 of the body
that do not lie on a single straight line are known. The position of each of these points can
be determined by three parameters, for example, the coordinates xj, yj, zj (j = 1, 2, 3).
All in all, there are nine coordinates, but they cannot be speciﬁed arbitrarily, because there
are three equations saying that the distances s12, s23, s31 between the points must remain
constant. (The body is rigid.) If, say, the six coordinates x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, x3 are known,
then the remaining three coordinates z2, y3, z3 can be found from the constraint equations.
3. A body rotating about a ﬁxed axis has a single degree of freedom, and for the
generalized coordinate one can take the rotation angle ϕ.

6. A system consisting of a prism lying on a plane and a disk rolling without slip on the
lateral face of the prism has two degrees of freedom (Fig. E2.42).

7. A system consisting of two free points has six degrees of freedom.
8. A sewing machine mechanism consisting of numerous rigid bodies has a single
degree of freedom.
9. A thin rectilinear rod moving on a plane in such a way that the velocity of the rod
center must be parallel to the rod axis has two degrees of freedom.
Of the above examples of mechanical systems, only one system (the last) is nonholo-
nomic, while the others are holonomic.
We again return to the notion of generalized coordinates, which we illustrate by the
system in Example 6 (Fig. E2.42). The position of each point of the disk and the prism is
known as soon as we specify the values for one of the following pairs of variables: either
(x1, x2), or (x1, s2), or (x2, ψ2), or (x1, ψ2), or q1 = 1
3 (x1 + x2), or q2 = 1
2 x1 – x2, etc.
Let us summarize. For the system under study, there are inﬁnitely many choices of
generalized coordinates, but each set of these always contains two independent variables.
Since the system is holonomic, it follows that the number of generalized coordinates is 2
(i.e., coincides with the number of degrees of freedom). The coordinates are referred to as
generalized because they may fail to have a clear geometric meaning. (For example, this is
the case for the coordinates (q1, q2).)
◮Ideal constraints. Constraints are said to be ideal if the sum of works of their reac-
tions Rj is zero on any virtual displacement of the system:
X
δAR
j = 0.
An example of a system with ideal constraints is a free rigid body. Any complicated
mechanism consisting of several rigid bodies can be treated as a mechanical system with
ideal constraints if some bodies are connected absolutely rigidly and the other bodies are
connected by ideal hinges (without friction) and also by weightless unstretchable perfectly
ﬂexible strings. Moreover, the contact surfaces must be either absolutely smooth or perfectly
rough when one of the bodies rolls on another without slip so that the moment of rolling
friction forces at the point of their tangency is zero and the static friction force is nonzero.
E2.6.3. Principle of Virtual Displacements
Principle of virtual displacements is stated as follows: for a mechanical system with ideal
constraints to be in equilibrium, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that the sum of elementary
works of active forces Fi on any virtual displacement of the system be zero.

The mathematical representation of the principle of virtual displacements is
X
δAF
i = 0.
(E2.6.3.1)
If a system has n degrees of freedom and its position is determined by generalized
coordinates qj(j = 1, 2, . . . , n), then the last expression can be rewritten as
X
δAF
i =

Fi ⋅δri =
n
X
j=1
Qj δqj = 0,
where the δqj are variations of the generalized coordinates.
The coefﬁcients Qj are called generalized forces. Since the variations of generalized
coordinates are independent, we see that for the equation to be satisﬁed it is necessary that
each of the factors multiplying δqj be zero. Thus, if a system with ideal constraints is in
equilibrium, then all generalized forces are zero.
Example. Find the angle ϕ of deviation from the vertical axis of a heavy homogeneous rod of weight G
with a horizontal force F applied to the lower end B (Fig. E2.43).
Figure E2.43. Deviation from the vertical axis of a heavy rod under the action of a horizontal force.
Solution. In the mechanical system we include a rod, which is a rigid body. Neglecting the friction in the
hinge, we conclude that the constraints imposed on the system are ideal, and its equilibrium can be studied by
the principle of virtual displacements.
In the equilibrium characterized by the angle ϕ, consider a virtual displacement of the system; i.e., we
deﬂect the rod by a small angle δϕ about the hinge H, calculate the sum of elementary works of active forces
G and F, and equate it with zero:
–GL sin ϕ δϕ + F2L cos ϕ δϕ = 0
(the rod length is 2L), or, after transformations,
δϕ (–GL sin ϕ + F2L cos ϕ) = 0.
Since the virtual displacement δϕ is arbitrary, it follows that, for the product to be zero, it is necessary to
equate the expression in parentheses with zero:
–GL sin ϕ + F2L cos ϕ = 0.
This implies the desired angle ϕ = arctan(2F/G).

E2.6.4. General Equation of Dynamics (d’Alembert–Lagrange
Principle)
Statement of the general equation of dynamics: A mechanical system with imposed ideal
constraints moves in such a way that, at each time instant, the sum of elementary works of
all active forces Fj and forces of inertia Φj on any virtual displacement of the system is
zero. The mathematical statement of the d’Alembert–Lagrange principle is

(E2.6.4.1)
Remark. Problems of system dynamics can generally be solved by various methods. The general equation
of dynamics has the unquestionable advantage that once it is used, the solution process does not involve the
unknown constraint reaction forces, which signiﬁcantly decreases the order of the system of equations of
motion.
Example. A rectangular parallelepiped of mass m1 moves on a smooth horizontal surface, a homogeneous
disk of mass m2 and radius r2 rolls on the upper ideally rough surface of the parallelepiped, and a constant
horizontal force F2 is applied to the center of the disk (Fig. E2.44a).
Find the accelerations a1 of the
parallelepiped and a2 of the disk center.
Solution. Consider the system consisting of the parallelepiped and the disk. The constraints imposed on
the system are ideal, and we can use the general equation of dynamics to study the motion of the system. For
the coordinates determining the system position we take the absolute coordinate x1 of the parallelepiped and
the coordinate x2 characterizing the disk position with respect to the parallelepiped.
The acceleration vectors a1 of the parallelepiped and a2 of the disk center are horizontal, their magnitudes
are a1 = ¨x1 and a2 = ¨x1 + ¨x2, and the disk angular acceleration is ε2 = ¨x2/r2. The expected directions of
the vectors a1 and a2 and the corresponding direction of the curved arrow ε2 are shown in Fig. E2.44b. We
supplement the active forces F2, G1, G2 (where G1 and G2 are the forces of weight of the parallelepiped and of
the disk) with the forces of inertia Φ1 = – m1a1, Φ2 = – m2a2 and the couple of forces of inertia with torque
M Φ
2 = –I2cε2 (see Fig. E2.44b).
Figure E2.44. Disk rolling on the surface of a moving parallelepiped: (a) coordinates determining the system
position and the active forces; (b) vectors of accelerations and forces of inertia.
Consider a virtual displacement of the system increasing the coordinates x1, x2 by some values δx1, δx2.
Then the disk rotates by the angle δϕ2 = δx2/r2.
Now we calculate the sum of elementary works of active forces and forces of inertia on the virtual
displacement and equate it with zero:
F2(δx1 + δx2) – m1a1 δx1 – m2a2(δx1 + δx2) – I2cε2 δϕ2 = 0.
On rearranging, we obtain
δx1

F2 – m1 ¨x1 – m2(¨x1 + ¨x2)] + δx2[F2 – m2(¨x1 + ¨x2) – 1
2 m2 ¨x2

= 0.
Here the virtual displacements δx1 and δx2 can take arbitrary mutually independent values.
For the
equation to be always satisﬁed, it is necessary that both factors in square brackets multiplying δx1 and δx2 be
zero. Thus, the last relation becomes a system of two equations with two unknowns,
F2 – m1 ¨x1 – m2(¨x1 + ¨x2) = 0,
F2 – m2(¨x1 + ¨x2) – 1
2 m2 ¨x2 = 0.

E2.6. ELEMENTS OF ANALYTICAL MECHANICS

By solving the system, we obtain
a1 = ¨x1 =
F2
3m1 + m2 ,
a2 = ¨x1 + ¨x2 = F2(2m1 + m2)
m2(3m1 + m2) .
E2.6.5. Lagrange Equations of the Second Kind
To describe the motion of a holonomic mechanical system with n degrees of freedom with
imposed ideal constraints, one often uses the Lagrange equations of the second kind
d
dt
 ∂T
∂˙qj

– ∂T
∂qj
= Qj,
j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(E2.6.5.1)
Here the qj are generalized coordinates the number of which is equal to the number n of
degrees of freedom, the ˙qj are the generalized velocities equal to the time derivatives of the
generalized coordinates, T is the kinetic energy of the system, and the Qj are generalized
forces.
The quantities T and Qj must be represented as functions of generalized velocities,
generalized coordinates, and time:
T = T(˙q1, . . . , ˙qn, q1, . . . , qn, t),
Qj = Qj(˙q1, . . . , ˙qn, q1, . . . , qn, t).
The generalized forces are found from the expression for the sum of elementary works of
active forces Fi on a virtual displacement of the system transformed to the form
X
δAF
i =
X
Fi ⋅δri =
n
X
j=1
Qj δqj.
The number of generalized forces is equal to the number of degrees of freedom.
The physical dimension of the generalized force Qj depends on the dimension of the
corresponding generalized coordinate qj, because the dimension of their product Qj δqj
must coincide with the dimension of work of force. Therefore, Qj may have no clear
physical meaning, and just this fact underlies the name “generalized force.”
After the functions T and Qj are substituted, the Lagrange equations acquire the form
of a system of second-order ordinary differential equations, which should be integrated with
the initial conditions taken into account.
Example. To visualize the advantages of the above method, we construct the differential equations of
motion of the mechanical system considered in the example in the preceding section in the form of Lagrange
equations of the second kind.
Solution. Consider a system consisting of a parallelepiped and a disk (Fig. E2.44). The imposed constraints
are holonomic and ideal, and hence the Lagrange equations of the second kind can be used. The system has two
degrees of freedom; for the generalized coordinates determining the system position we choose the absolute
coordinates q1 = x1 of the parallelepiped and q2 = x1 + x2 of the disk center (see Fig. E2.44a).
We write out the expression for the kinetic energy of the system and reduce it to the form of a function of
˙q1, ˙q2, q1, q2, and t:
T = T1 + T2 = m1v2

.
In these transformations, we have used the formula for the kinetic energy of the body in plane motion and
the kinematic relation ω2 = (˙q2 – ˙q1)/r2.
Because of the simple kinematics and the fortunate choice of generalized coordinates, the expression for
the kinetic energy (explicitly) contains neither the generalized coordinates nor time.

724
D’ALEMBERT’S PRINCIPLE. ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
Let us calculate the generalized forces. To this end, we calculate the sum of elementary works of active
forces G1, G2, F2 on a virtual displacement of the system determined by variations δq1, δq2 directed so that the
coordinates q1 and q2 increase:
X
δAF
i = F2(δx1 + δx2) = F2 δq2 = 0 δq1 + F2 δq2.
The coefﬁcients multiplying the variations of generalized coordinates are the desired expressions for
generalized forces, whence
Q1 = 0,
Q2 = F2.
It remains to write out the system of equations of motion:
d

– ∂T
∂q1 = Q1,
d
dt
 ∂T
∂˙q2

∂q2 = Q2.
In view of the obtained expressions for T, Q1, and Q2, after appropriate transformations the equations of
motion acquire the form
m1¨q1 – 1
2 m2(¨q2 – ¨q1) = 0,
m2¨q2 + 1
2 m2(¨q2 – ¨q1) = F2.
The solution thus obtained coincides with the solution of this problem obtained earlier by a different
method in the preceding section.
In contrast to the Lagrange equations of the second kind, the general equation of
dynamics can also be used to study nonholonomic systems and thus has a wider scope. At
the same time, the Lagrange equations of the secondkindare more convenient whenstudying
holonomic systems, because they require fewer manipulations, and these manipulations are
simpler.
E2.7. Small Oscillations of Mechanical Systems
E2.7.1. Preliminaries
In what follows, we consider a holonomic conservative mechanical system with n degrees
of freedom whose position is determined by generalized coordinates q1, q2, . . . , qn. Without
loss of generality, we assume that the coordinate values q1 = q2 = . . . = qn = 0 correspond
to an equilibrium of the system. In this case, all generalized forces are zero, Q1 = Q2 =
. . . = Qn = 0.
The equilibrium qj = 0, ˙qj = 0; j = 1, 2, . . . , n of the system is said to be stable if, for
each ε > 0, there exists a δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that if the initial deviations for t = 0 are in the
δ-neighborhood |q0
j| < δ, |˙q0
j| < δ, then, for the entire time of motion, the system does not
leave the ε-neighborhood of the equilibrium; i.e., |qj| < ε and |˙qj| < ε for t > 0.
Example. A physical pendulum moving in the vertical plane (Fig. E2.45) has two equilibria corresponding
to the angles ϕ = 0 and ϕ = π. It is intuitively clear that the ﬁrst equilibrium is stable and the second equilibrium
is unstable.
The character of equilibrium can be determined by studying the exact solution of
the equations of motion of the system. But there exist stability criteria for the system
equilibrium, which permit solving this problem more rationally.
One such criterion is given by the following theorem.
THEOREM (LAGRANGE). If, in a certain position of a conservative system, the potential
energy has a strict minimum, then this position is a stable equilibrium of the system.

E2.7.2. Small Oscillations of a Conservative System
The kinetic and potential energy of a conservative system with n degrees of freedom can be
expressed via the generalized coordinates qj and generalized velocities ˙qj (i = 1, . . . , n):
T = 1
2
n
X
i,j=1
aij(q1, . . . , qn)˙qi˙qj,
Π = Π(q1, . . . , qn).
We assume that:
(1) The state of stable equilibrium of the system corresponds to the coordinates q1 =
· · · = qn = 0. By the Lagrange theorem, the potential energy of the system has a strict
minimum at this point; i.e., ∂Π
∂qj (0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
(2) Π(0, 0, . . . , 0) = 0, which can always be assumed because of the arbitrary constant
contained in the deﬁnition of the potential energy (see Subsection E2.5.5).
(3) In the motion of the system, the values of the coordinates qj and velocities ˙qj are
small.
We expand the functions T and Π in a neighborhood of q1 = · · · = qn = 0 and ˙q1 = · · · =
˙qn = 0 into series in powers of the coordinates and velocities preserving the terms of the
second order of magnitude in qj and ˙qj:

where the constants aij and cij satisfy the conditions aij = aji and cij = cji =

qk=0.
As a result, both functions become quadratic forms whose positive deﬁniteness follows
from the physical meaning of the kinetic energy T ≥0 and the fact that the potential energy
Π at a point of stable equilibrium has a strict minimum, Π ≥0.
The Lagrange equations with the above expressions for T and Π taken into account
acquire the form of a system of n second-order ordinary linear equations
n

(aij ¨qj + cijqj) = 0
(i = 1, . . . , n).
The above-described process is called the linearization of equations of motion. The
problem of closeness of the solutions of the linearized system to those of the original
nonlinear problem is important, but we do not discuss it here.

D’ALEMBERT’S PRINCIPLE. ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
We seek a particular solution of the above system in the form qj = uj sin(ωt + α) with
j = 1, . . . , n. By substituting this expression into the equations of motion and by cancelling
sin(ωt + α), we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the amplitudes uj. Since
some of the amplitudes must be nonzero, it follows that the determinant of the system of
homogeneous equations must be zero:
det |cij – λaij| = 0,
λ = ω2.
The obtained equation is called the secular equation or the frequency equation. By
expanding the determinant, we obtain a polynomial of degree n in λ.
One can prove that in the case under study the secular equation has only real positive
roots λj associated with real positive frequencies ωj =
p
λj. In this case, the n obtained
particular solutions of the system are linearly independent (including the case of multiple
roots of the secular equation); they are called the normal oscillations of the system.
Since the system of differential equations is linear, we see that any linear combination
of normal oscillations with constant coefﬁcients is also a solution of the system.
Example. A double mathematical pendulum consists of two weightless rods of equal length l with heavy
point particles of equal mass m ﬁxed at the ends of the rods. The construction moves in the plane of the ﬁgure,
the upper rod can rotate about the ﬁxed hinge O1 adjusted to the base, and the second pendulum can rotate
about the moving hinge O2 connecting the rods (Fig. E2.46a). Study the small motions of the system near the
stable equilibrium.
Figure E2.46. Oscillations of the double mathematical pendulum: (a) sketch of the device; (b) the angles made
by the rods with the vertical axis for C1 = 0; (c) the angles made by the rods with the vertical axis for C2 = 0.
Solution. For the generalized coordinates we take ϕ1 and ϕ2, i.e., the rod rotation angles about the vertical.
The expressions for the kinetic and potential energy of the system have the form
T = ml2 ˙ϕ2
1 + 2ml2 cos(ϕ2 – ϕ1) ˙ϕ1 ˙ϕ2 + ml2 ˙ϕ2
2,
Π = –2mgl cos ϕ1 – mgl cos ϕ2.
It follows from the expression for the potential energy that the stable equilibrium of the system corresponds
to the coordinate values ϕ1 = ϕ2 = 0. Assuming that the oscillations are small, we rewrite the expressions for
T and Π omitting the terms of the third and higher orders of magnitude:
T = ml2 ˙ϕ2
1 + 2ml2 ˙ϕ1 ˙ϕ2 + ml2 ˙ϕ2
2,
Π = mglϕ2
1 + 1
2 mglϕ2

We write out the equations of motion of the system as
2l ¨ϕ1 + l ¨ϕ2 + 2gϕ1 = 0,
l ¨ϕ1 + l ¨ϕ2 + gϕ2 = 0.

E2.7. SMALL OSCILLATIONS OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS
727
We seek a particular solution of this system in the form
ϕ1 = u1 sin(ωt + α),
ϕ2 = u2 sin(ωt + α).
The secular equation is reduced to the form

whose roots are the two angular natural oscillation frequencies

2 for the frequency ω2. Therefore, the general solution of the linearized system of
differential equations describing the motion of the double mathematical pendulum has the form

ϕ2 =
√
2 C1 sin(ω1t + α1) –

The angles ϕ1 and ϕ2 made by the rods with the vertical axis for C1 = 0, C2 ≠0 and C2 = 0, C1 ≠0 are
shown in Fig. E2.46, b and c.
E2.7.3. Normal Coordinates
Obviously, the difﬁculties encountered when seeking the natural oscillation frequencies of
a mechanical system increase with the number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, ﬁnding
the general characteristics of the system behavior is also difﬁcult, because the characteristic
equation is cumbersome. The existence of normal or principal coordinates in a system
permits one to make the analysis of the system less laborious.
THEOREM. Two quadratic forms at least one of which is positive deﬁnite can be si-
multaneously reduced to “sums of squares” by a nonsingular linear transformation of the
variables.
In the case of oscillations of a conservative system, there are two positive deﬁnite
quadratic forms: the kinetic energy, which is a quadratic form of the generalized velocities
˙qi, and the potential energy, which is a quadratic form of the generalized coordinates qi.
Since the generalized coordinates and generalized velocities behave in the same way under
a linear transformation,

The Lagrange equations in normal coordinates θj have the form

Each of these equations contains only one unknown function. The general solutions of
these equations determine the harmonic oscillations
θj = Cj sin(ωjt + αj),
ωj =
p
λj,
j = 1, . . . , n,
where the Cj and αj are arbitrary constants.

Thus, we have shown that all the roots of the secular equation for a conservative
mechanical system are real and positive. In addition, to n frequencies ωj =
p
λj there
correspond n linearly independent amplitude vectors, and the general solution of the system
does not contain secular terms of the form θj = (C0 + C1t + C2t2 + · · ·) sin(ωjt + αj) in the
case of multiple frequencies.
E2.7.4. Inﬂuence of Small Dissipative Forces on System Oscillations
Assume that each point of the system is subjected not only to potential forces but also to
resistance forces depending on the velocity. Such forces are said to be dissipative. In this
case, the total mechanical energy of the system does not remain constant but decays with
time.
Let us estimate the inﬂuence of dissipative forces on system oscillations under the
assumption that these forces are small and linearly depend on the velocities of points of
the system. In addition, we assume that the conservative system has distinct oscillation
frequencies. The expressions for the generalized forces acquire the form
Qi = –

In the case under study, the system is deﬁnitely dissipative, and the equilibrium of the
system is asymptotically stable; i.e., qi(t) →0 as t →∞.
In normal coordinates, the equations of motion of the system acquire the form
¨θi + βi˙θi + ω2

j≠i
βij ˙θj = 0
(i, j = 1, . . . , n).
Using the fact that the dissipative forces are small—i.e., the coefﬁcients βi and βij are
small—in the ﬁrst approximation, one can obtain a system of linearly independent particular
solutions (“normal oscillations”) in the form (Gantmakher, 1975)

where i = 1, . . . , n. This implies that:
(1) The system frequencies are close to those of the corresponding conservative system
in the absence of dissipative forces.
(2) The system oscillations are damped as t →∞.
(3) In the ith normal oscillation, all coordinates θj (j ≠i) are small compared with the
ith coordinate θi and differ from it in phase by a quarter period.

E2.7. SMALL OSCILLATIONS OF MECHANICAL SYSTEMS

E2.7.5. Forced Oscillations
Assume that the system considered in the preceding section is also subjected to perturbing
forces Qi. The equations of motion of such a system acquire the form
n
X
j=1
(aij ¨qj + bij ˙qj + cijqj) = Qi(t),
i = 1, . . . , n.
The general solution qi(t) of this inhomogeneous system of linear equations is the sum
of the general solution q◦
i (t) of the corresponding homogeneous system and a particular
solution eqi(t) of the inhomogeneous system,
qi(t) = q◦
i (t) + eqi(t).
Since q◦
i (t) →0 as t →∞, it follows that the system behavior for large values t is
determined by the particular solution, qi(t) →eqi(t) as t →∞.
The system under study is linear, and, because of the linear superposition of particular
solutions, the general case of ﬁnding the forced oscillations is reduced to studying the
solution of the system for the case in which only one of the perturbing forces is nonzero,
say, Q1 ≠0.
We restrict ourselves to the case of a harmonic driving force Q1(t) = AeiΩt, Qj = 0
(j = 2, . . . , n), where i is the imaginary unit (i2 = –1). We seek the forced oscillations in
the form qk = BkeiΩt (k = 1, . . . , n). By substituting these expressions into the equations
of motion, we obtain a system of algebraic equations for Bk:


Bj = 0,
k = 2, . . . , n.
By solving this system, we obtain Bk = W1k(iΩ)A, where W1k(iΩ) = ∆1k(iΩ)/∆(iΩ)
is a proper rational function of iΩwith real coefﬁcients. The hodograph of this function in
the complex plane is called the frequency or amplitude-phase characteristic.
By setting W1k(iΩ) = R1k(Ω)eiΨ1k(Ω), we rewrite the solution as
qk = R1k(Ω)Aei[Ωt+Ψ1k(Ω)],
k = 1, . . . , n,
where R1k(Ω) is the amplitude characteristic and Ψ1k(Ω) is the phase characteristic.
In the case of the sinusoidal perturbing force
Q1 = sin(Ωt) = A
2i (eiΩt – e–iΩt),
the solution becomes
qk = R1k(Ω)A sin[Ωt + Ψ1k(Ω)]
(k = 1, . . . , n);
i.e., a sinusoidal driving force causes a sinusoidal response, where the forces are multiplied
by the amplitude characteristic R1k(Ω) and the phase shift is determined by the phase
characteristic Ψ1k(Ω).
By adjusting the system characteristics, one can suppress oscillations at some “use-
less” frequencies and increase the amplitudes of these oscillations at the other “required”
frequencies. This idea underlies the design of frequency ﬁlters.

E2.8. Dynamics of an Absolutely Rigid Body
E2.8.1. Rotation of a Rigid Body about a Fixed Axis
Assume that a body of mass m rotates about the vertical z-axis under the action of a system
of active forces {Fk}. At points O1 and O2 of the axis, cylindrical hinges are located and a
thrust bearing* is placed at the point O1 (Fig. E2.47).
Figure E2.47. Rotation of a rigid body about a vertical axis under the action of active forces.
Theorems on the momentum and angular momentum with respect to the center O1 imply

Here xC and yC are the coordinates of the center of mass C of the body, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Z1
are the projections of the constraint reaction forces onto the coordinate axes, and L = O1O2.
* A thrust bearing is a device preventing the body from vertical displacements.

E2.8. DYNAMICS OF AN ABSOLUTELY RIGID BODY
731
The last equation does not contain reactions; it is called the equation of motion of a rigid
body about a ﬁxed axis. By integrating this equation, one can ﬁnd the angular velocity and
the angle of rotation as a function of time: ω = ω(t, ω0), ϕ = ϕ(t, ω0, ϕ0).
If the body is at rest ω = ˙ω = 0, then the constraint reactions are said to be static. In
the case of body rotation, the reactions are said to be dynamic; they depend on the angular
velocity and the angular acceleration of the body.
The conditions under which the dynamic reactions are equal to static reactions have the
form
xC = yC = 0,
Iyz = Izx = 0.
This implies that, as a rigid body rotates about a ﬁxed axis, the dynamic constraint reactions
are equal to static ones if the rotation axis is one of the principal central axes of inertia.
E2.8.2. Plane-Parallel (Plane) Motion of a Rigid Body
Each motion of a body can be viewed as a motion of the center of mass and the motions of
the body with respect to the center of mass.
In the case of plane motion, the body points, including the center of mass, move in
planes parallel to a ﬁxed (base) plane. The motion about the center of mass is the rotation
about an axis perpendicular to the base plane and passing through the center of mass.
We draw a plane parallel to the base plane through the center of mass C and introduce
ﬁxed axes Oξη in this plane (Fig. E2.48). In addition, we introduce two moving reference
frames whose common origin is the center of mass C. One of them, Cx∗y∗(the K¨onig
axes), moves translationally: its axes are parallel to the axes of the ﬁxed system Oξη; the
second system, Cxy, is rigidly ﬁxed to the body and rotates about C.
Figure E2.48. Plane-parallel motion of a rigid body.
The body position is determined by the following three parameters: the coordinates
xC, yC of the center of mass in the ﬁxed system Oξη and the rotation angle ϕ between the
axes Cx∗and Cx.
The theorem on the motion of the center of mass of the body in the ﬁxed system Oξη
and the theorem on the angular momentum about the axis perpendicular to the base plane
and passing through the center of mass give the following three equations of plane motion
of a rigid body:

on the right-hand side of the relations contain the projections and moments of the external
forces acting on the body.
By integrating the obtained system of equations with the initial conditions taken into
account, one can determine xC, yC, and ϕ as functions of time t.
E2.8.3. Motion of a Rigid Body about a Fixed Point
◮Preliminary remarks and deﬁnitions.
An arbitrary motion of a rigid body is the combination of two simultaneous motions: the
translational motion together with an arbitrary point of the body and the spherical motion
about this point treated as a ﬁxed point.
In several problems of motion of a rigid body, the differential equations of motion
determining the translational motion are independent of the equations of motion about the
chosen point. Therefore, both systems of equations can be integrated independently of
each other. As a rule, the difﬁculties of analytical integration arise in the second system.
Therefore, the problem of motion of a body about a ﬁxed point is most important in
mechanics.
Any body with a single ﬁxed point has three degrees of freedom, and its position can be
determined by introducing three independent generalized coordinates.
We introduce two reference frames whose origins coincide with the ﬁxed point O of
the rigid body. The system Oξηζ is ﬁxed, and the system Oxyz is a moving system rigidly
ﬁxed to the body. The position of the moving system (i.e., the position of the rigid body)
with respect to the ﬁxed system is determined by the Euler angles ϕ, ψ, and θ.
Figure E2.49. Motion of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point: the ﬁxed and moving reference frames Oξηζ and
Oxyz, and the Euler angles ϕ, ψ, and θ.
The straight line OK of intersection of the planes Oξη and Oxy is called the nodal
line. Its positive direction is chosen so that the nearest rotation from Oζ to Oz seems to be
anticlockwise if it is observed from the side of the point K.
The angle ϕ of proper rotation is the angle between OK and Ox; it is assumed to be
positive if, being observed from the positive sense of the axis, the rotation from OK to Ox
seems to be anticlockwise. The axis Oz is called the axis of proper rotation. If only the
angle ϕ varies, then the body rotates about the ﬁxed axis Oz with the angular velocity
˙ϕ = ˙ϕz◦of proper rotation directed along the axis Oz, where z◦is the unit vector of the
axis Oz. (We do not show all unit vectors of coordinate axes in Fig. E2.49 so as not to
overload it.)
The precession angle ψ is the angle between Oξ and OK; it is assumed to be positive if,
being observed from the positive sense of the axis Oζ, the rotation from Oξ to OK seems

E2.8. DYNAMICS OF AN ABSOLUTELY RIGID BODY
733
to be anticlockwise. The axis Oζ is called the axis of precession. If only the angle ψ varies,
then the body rotates about the ﬁxed axis Oζ with the angular precession velocity ˙ψ = ˙ψζ◦
directed along the axis Oζ, where ζ◦is the unit vector of the axis Oζ.
The nutation angle θ is the angle between Oζ and Oz. The nodal line OK is called the
axis of nutation. If only the angle θ varies, then the body rotates about the ﬁxed axis OK
with the angular nutation velocity ˙θ = ˙θ −−→
OK◦directed along the axis OK, where −−→
OK◦is
the unit vector of the axis OK.
The superposition of the system Oξηζ with the system Oxyz can be realized by three
rotations: ﬁrst, by the angle ψ about the axis Oζ, then by the angle θ about OK, and ﬁnally,
by the angle ϕ about the axis Oz.
◮Kinematic Euler equations. If all three angles vary as the body moves, then the angular
velocity of the body ω according to the theorems on the compound motion of a rigid body is
equal to the vector sum of the vectors of angular velocities of the proper rotation, precession,
and nutation:
ω = ˙ϕ + ˙ψ + ˙θ.
We denote the projections of the angular velocity ω on the axes of the moving reference
frame Oxyz by p, q, r. The expressions of these quantities via the Euler angles ϕ, ψ, θ and
their derivatives ˙ϕ, ˙ψ, ˙θ have the form
p = ˙ψ sin θ sin ϕ + ˙θ cos ϕ,
q = ˙ψ sin θ cos ϕ – ˙θ sin ϕ,
r = ˙ψ cos θ + ˙ϕ.
(E2.8.3.1)
For p′, q′, r′, i.e., the projections of the angular velocity ω on the axes of the ﬁxed system
Oξηζ, the expressions via the Euler angles and their derivatives have the form
p′ = ˙ϕ sin θ sin ψ + ˙θ cos ψ,
q′ = – ˙ϕ sin θ cos ψ + ˙θ sin ψ,
r′ = ˙ϕ cos θ + ˙ψ.
(E2.8.3.2)
The last two groups of equations are called the kinematic Euler equations.
◮Formulas for the angular momentum. Dynamic Euler equations. The expressions
for the angular momentum KO of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point O and its projections

or, in coordinate form,
2T = ω ⋅K = Ixxp2 + Iyyq2 + Izzr2 – 2Iyzqr – 2Izxrp – 2Ixypq.
The dynamic Euler equations of motion of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point are obtained
from the theorem on the angular momentum about a ﬁxed point O:
dKO

=
X
MOFe
j
(in the ﬁxed reference frame)
or
edKO

+ ω × KO = MOFe

(in the moving reference frame).
It is inconvenient to project the vector relations on the axes of a ﬁxed reference frame,
because the coefﬁcients Iξξ, Iηη, Iζζ, . . . , Iξη contained in the expression for KO depend
on time, and the equations thus obtained are rather cumbersome. The equations of motion
become concise if
1. The projections onto the axes of the moving reference frame are taken.
2. For the moving axes one takes the principal axes of inertia of the body for the point O,
so that
KOx = Ixxp = Ap,
KOy = Iyyq = Bq,
KOz = Izzr = Cr.
(Here the traditional notation A = Ixx, B = Iyy, C = Izz is used.)
As a result, the dynamic Euler equations acquire the form
A dp
dt + (C – B)qr = Mx,
B dq
dt + (A – C)rp = My,
A dr
dt + (B – A)pq = Mz.
(E2.8.3.4)
Along with the kinematic Euler equations (E2.8.3.1), they form a system of six ﬁrst-order
ordinary nonlinear equations for the six unknown functions p, q, r, ϕ, ψ, θ of time. The
general integrals of the system must contain six arbitrary constants, which are determined
by the initial conditions p0, q0, r0, ϕ0, ψ0, θ0 for t = t0.
By eliminating p, q, r, one can pass from the system of six equations to a system of three
second-order ordinary differential equations for the Euler angles.
The difﬁculties of analytic integration of the system of nonlinear equations of motion
are obvious, because, in the general case, Mx, My, and Mz are functions of t, p, q, r, ϕ, ψ,
and θ.
◮Statement of the problem on the motion of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point. Consider
the motion of a heavy rigid body about a ﬁxed point under the action of a single active force
of weight G. We neglect the Earth’s rotation, assuming that the Earth is ﬁxed. The axis Oζ
of the stationary system Oξηζ ﬁxed to the Earth is directed vertically upwards and opposite
to the force of gravity. The position vector −−→
OC of the center of gravity of a body is denoted
by rc(xc, yc, zc). The expressions for the direction cosines of the angles made by the axis
Oζ with the axes of the moving reference frame become
cos(d
ζ, x) = γ1 = sin θ sin ϕ,
cos(d
ζ, y) = γ2 = sin θ cos ϕ,
cos( c
ζ, z) = γ3 = cos θ.

E2.8. DYNAMICS OF AN ABSOLUTELY RIGID BODY
735
Here γ1, γ2, γ3 are the projections of the unit vector ζ◦on the moving axes; i.e., ζ◦=
γ1i + γ2j + γ3k, where i, j, k are the unit vectors of the moving axes. Since the direction of
the force of gravity does not vary, it follows that
dζ◦
dt ≡
edζ◦
dt + ω × ζ◦= 0,
which implies the Poisson equations:
dγ1
dt = rγ2 – qγ3,
dγ2
dt = pγ3 – rγ1,
dγ3
dt = qγ1 – pγ2.
In the case under study, with the relations G = –Gζ◦and M0 = r × G taken into account,
the dynamic Euler equations acquire the form
A dp
dt + (C – B)qr = G(γ2zc – γ3yc),
B dq
dt + (A – C)rp = G(γ3xc – γ1zc),
A dr
dt + (B – A)pq = G(γ1yc – γ2xc).
Here the quantities A, B, C, xc, yc, zc are constants.
The last equations, together with the Poisson equations, form a closed system of six
equations with six unknown functions of time γ1, γ2, γ3, p, q, r. If they are obtained, then
to determine the Euler angles ϕ, ψ, θ as functions of time it is necessary to ﬁnd ψ(t) by
a single quadrature of any of the kinematic Euler equations, because θ(t) and ϕ(t) can be
found from the expressions for the direction cosines of the angles made by the axis Oζ with
the axes of the moving system.
One can show that the solution of the problem on the motion of a body is reduced to
ﬁnding only a single integral.
If the system of equations of motion is represented in the canonical form
dp
P = dq
Q = dr
R = γ1
Γ1
= γ2
Γ2
= γ3
Γ3

where
P = G(γ2zc – γ3yc) – (C – B)qr,
Γ1 = rγ2 – qγ3,
Q = G(γ3xc – γ1zc) – (A – C)rp,
Γ2 = pγ3 – rγ1,
R = G(γ1yc – γ2xc) – (B – A)pq,
Γ3 = qγ1 – pγ2,
then one can see that
(1) It is possible to integrate the system of the ﬁrst ﬁve equations

alone, because they do not contain the time t explicitly.

736

(2) The structure of this system of ﬁve equations is such that, according to the theory
of the last Jacobi multiplier for the canonical system of differential equations (the details
of this theory are beyond the scope of this book), to reduce the problem to quadratures it
sufﬁces to know four rather than ﬁve integrals of the system.
(3) One of the integrals, γ2
1 + γ2
2 + γ2
3 = 1, is obvious from geometric considerations.
(4) The theorem on the angular momentum of the system about the axis Oζ,
dKζ
dt
=
Mζ = 0, leads to the integral
Apγ1 + Bqγ2 + Crγ3 = const.
(5) The theorem on the kinetic energy dT = –Gdζc gives one more integral,
1
2 (Ap2 + Bq2 + Cr2) = –G(xcγ1 + ycγ2 + zcγ3) + const.
Thus, it remains to ﬁnd one last integral.
This problem can be solved only in the
following three special cases:
(i) The Euler–Poinsot case: motion by inertia, when the moment of external forces
about the ﬁxed point is zero: MO = 0.
(ii) The Lagrange–Poisson case: the ellipsoid of inertia of a body about the ﬁxed point
is an ellipsoid of rotation, A = B, and the center of gravity of the body lies on the axis of
rotation of the ellipsoid of inertia.
(iii) The Kowalewski case determined by the following two conditions: (a) A = B = 2C
and (b) the center of gravity lies in the equatorial plane of the ellipsoid of inertia.
The studies showed that it is only in these three cases that there exists an algebraic
integral that holds for any initial conditions, and this reduces the problem to quadratures.
The cases of integration described in the literature and differing from the above cases hold
only under certain speciﬁcally chosen initial conditions.
Example. Under the conditions A = B (the ellipsoid of inertia is an ellipsoid of rotation) and MO = 0, the
solution of the problem on the motion of a body can be solved completely in elementary functions.
The dynamic Euler equations become
A dp
dt + (C – A)qr = 0,
B dq
dt + (A – C)rp = 0,
A dr
dt = 0.
The solution of this system gives the three integrals
A(p2 + q2) + Cr2 = h,
A2(p2 + q2) + C2r2 = K2
O,
r = r0 = const.
The ﬁrst of them is the energy integral, the second follows from the law of conservation of the angular
momentum KO, and the third follows directly from the last equation.
To solve the problem completely, it is necessary to express the Euler angles as functions of time. To
simplify the solution, we direct the axis Oζ along the vector KO, which remains constant in magnitude and
direction. The projections of KO onto the axes Ox, Oy, and Oz are
Kx = Ap = G sin θ sin ϕ,
Ky = Aq = G sin θ cos ϕ,
Kz = Cr = G cos ϕ.
It follows from the last equation that θ = const = θ0, because cos θ = Cr/G = Cr0/G = const.
After the corresponding substitutions into the kinematic Euler equations, we integrate them and ﬁnally
obtain the expressions for the Euler angles:
ϕ =

r0 – KO
A cos θ0

t + ϕ0,
ψ = KO
A t + ψ0,
θ = θ0.
The motion determined by these equations is called the regular precession.

E2.8. DYNAMICS OF AN ABSOLUTELY RIGID BODY
737
E2.8.4. Elementary Theory of Gyroscope
A gyroscope is a homogeneous body of rotation rapidly rotating about its symmetry axis;
the gyro axis can change its direction in space. Usually, the gyro is made as a massive
symmetry body ﬁxed so that one of the points of its axis remains immovable. This, for
example, can be done by using the gimbal suspension (Fig. E2.50).
Figure E2.50. Gyroscope.
The exact analytical study of the gyro motion is a very complicated problem. The
solution is signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed if the angular velocity of the gyro rotation is sufﬁciently
large.
If MO = 0 for a gyro rotating about the symmetry axis, then the theorem on the angular
momentum dKO/dt = MO implies that KO = Iω1 = const. This means that the gyro
axis preserves its original direction with respect to inertial reference frame, and the angular
velocity ω1 is constant.
If MO ≠0, then, in addition to proper rotation, the gyro performs precession and
nutation motions. Exact studies show that, for a rapidly rotating gyro, the variations in the
axis direction due to the nutation oscillations, ∆θ = (θmax – θmin), remain in a very small
range, and the angular nutation velocity ˙θ is also very small. Therefore, in the approximate
theory of gyros, it is assumed that θ = θ0 = const.
The angular precession velocity ω2 is also small, but it is necessary to take this velocity
into account, because it has a constant sign and the gyro axis changes its direction rather
noticeably with time.
With the above assumptions taken into account, we have ω = ω1 + ω2 ≈ω1, because
ω2 ≪ω1. In what follows, we assume that, at any time instant, the angular velocity and
angular momentum vectors are directed along the gyro axis, KO = Iω1 (Fig. E2.51).
Now the theorem on the angular momentum dKO/dt = MO can be represented as
d(Iω1)/dt = MO. The left-hand side of the equation contains the velocity of the endpoint
of the vector Iω1 rotating about the vertical axis at the angular velocity ω2. Using the Euler
formula, we write out the ﬁnal result:
I(ω2 × ω1) = MO.

738
D’ALEMBERT’S PRINCIPLE. ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
Figure E2.51. Directions of the angular velocity of the gyro proper rotation ω1 (along the gyro axis) and the
angular precession velocity ω2.
Since the intrinsic angular momentum Iω1 is known, the last expression allows one to
solve the following two problems:
(1) If MO is known, ﬁnd ω2, i.e., the angular precession velocity.
(2) Conversely, if ω2 is known, ﬁnd MO, i.e., the moment of forces responsible for the
precession.
E2.9. Elementary Theory of Impact
As a rule, in the motion of a mechanical system, in each successive small time interval τ,
the variations in the velocities of points of the system are also small and have the same order
of magnitude. But in several cases, one can observe the phenomenon of impact in which
the velocities of several points can vary by a constant value in the time interval from t0 to
t0 + τ. This occurs either in the case of instantaneous imposition of a mechanical constraint
(for example, when a body falls on a massive plate) or in the case of instantaneous removal
of a constraint (for example, when a ﬂying missile bursts).
For such a point, we write the theorem on the momentum in the form d Q = P
k d Sk or
d (mV) = P
k Fk dt, perform integration, and obtain
Z V1
V0
d(mV) =
Z t0+τ
t0
X
k
Fk dt
or
m(V1 – V0) =
X
k
eFkτ.
Here V0 and V1 are the velocities of the point before and after the impact, and eFk are the
average forces acting on the point on impact.
Since the left-hand side of the last equation is a ﬁnite quantity, it follows that at least
one of the quantities eFk must be of the order of 1/τ on impact; i.e., since τ is small, it must
be much larger than the “ordinary” forces acting on the point. In what follows, such forces
are called impact forces.
Since the impact processes are very cumbersome, the law of variation of the impact
force is, as a rule, unknown. It follows from general considerations that the graph of the
impact force magnitude has the shape shown in Fig. E2.52, where the average impact force
magnitude is given.
Example 1. Approximate estimates of the impact force in the case of fall of a stone of weight 1 kg on a
plate from the height of 10 m give a quantity of the of order of 1.5 tons under the assumptions that the stone

after fall does not bounce and τ = 0.001 s. Judging from the ﬁgure, the maximum magnitude of the impact
force in the time of impact is at least twice larger, i.e., attains the value of the order of 3 tons and exceeds the
magnitude of the “ordinary” force of weight approximately by a factor of 3000.
With the above explanations taken into account, the theorem on the momentum of a
point can be stated as
Q1 – Q0 =
X
Sk;
i.e., the variation of the momentum of a point in the time of impact is equal to the sum of
impact momenta.
The impact momentum is the vector Sk =
R t0+τ
t0
Fk dt. The statement of the theorem
contains only the momenta of impact forces, because the momenta of “ordinary” forces can
be neglected as being of small order of magnitude.
At the time of impact, the velocity of the point varies according to the relation
m˙r – mV0 =
X
Sk,
where r is the position vector of the point with respect to a ﬁxed center O.
Separating the variables and integrating over the time of impact, we obtain

τ,
where r◦, r, eSk are the position vectors of the point at the beginning and at the end of the
impact and the average value of the impact momentum. The right-hand side of the equation
is a small value of the order of τ, which implies that r = r◦; i.e., the displacement of the
point in the time of impact can be neglected.
The last fact allows us to obtain the following theorem.
THEOREM ON THE VARIATION IN THE MOMENT OF MOMENTUM OF A POINT ON IMPACT. In
the time of impact, the variation in the moment of momentum of a point about any ﬁxed
center is equal to the sum of moments of impact momenta about the same center:

In collision of two bodies, at the point of contact, there arise impact forces applied
to each body (Fig. E2.53). These forces (and hence the impact momenta) are equal and
opposite, S1 = –S2.
Figure E2.53. Collision of two bodies.
We assume that the forces of friction are negligibly small; in this case, the impact
momenta are directed along the common normal to the surfaces of colliding bodies.
As observations show, the hypothesis on the absolute rigidity of bodies under the
conditions in question is not satisﬁed, and therefore, it is necessary to take into account
some additional properties.
The impact process can be divided into two phases, the initial and the ﬁnal. In the initial
phase, some constraints are imposed instantaneously, and the deformable bodies approach
each other along the line of the common normal. In the ﬁnal phase of the impact, the
constraints are removed instantaneously, the bodies remove from each other and completely
or partially restore their original shape.
The complete investigation of the phenomenon under study is far beyond the framework
of theoretical mechanics. But here it is also possible to obtain results that are in good
agreement with practice if the Newton’s hypothesis is accepted.
We assume that, in the time of impact, the site of contact of bodies is small and can be
assumed to be a point. We measure the relative velocity of approach of the points of contact
of the bodies directly before impact and calculate the absolute value of its projection V ′
on the common normal to the surfaces of the colliding bodies. We perform similar actions
when the points of contact separate immediately after impact, and obtain the values of V ′′.
According to Newton’s hypothesis, the quantity ε = V ′′/V ′ characterizes the properties
of colliding bodies and is independent of their masses and relative velocity.
This hypothesis can be stated in a different way: the ratio of the magnitudes of momenta
in the ﬁrst and second phases of impact is a constant value for colliding bodies and is a
quantity independent of masses and velocities of the bodies.
The physical constant ε is called the coefﬁcient of elasticity. It follows from physical
considerations that 0 ≤ε ≤1. For ε = 1, the impact is said to be absolutely elastic, for ε = 0,
absolutely inelastic.

E2.9. ELEMENTARY THEORY OF IMPACT
741
Example 2. The values of the coefﬁcient of elasticity can be obtained experimentally. A heavy ball raised
to a height h0 over a massive horizontal plate is lowered without initial velocity, and the maximal height h1 of
its raising after rebound is measured (Fig. E2.54).
Figure E2.54. Experimental determination of the coefﬁcient of elasticity by measuring the height of the ball
rebound from the surface.
Neglecting the air resistance, we determine the velocity of fall on the plate V0 and the rebound velocity
V1 from the relations V0 = √2gh0 and V1 = √2gh1. As a result, the formula for the coefﬁcient of elasticity
acquires the form
ε = V1
V0 =
r
h1
h2 .
Example 3 (Direct central impact of two bodies). The impact of two bodies in which the vectors of
internal impact momenta and the velocities of the centers of mass are directed along the straight line connecting
the centers of mass is called a direct central impact (Fig. E2.55). We assume that the velocities of the centers of
mass of the bodies before impact and the coefﬁcient of elasticity are known. It is required to ﬁnd the velocities
of centers of mass of the bodies after impact and the impact momenta.
Figure E2.55. Direct central impact of two moving bodies (of different masses).
Solution. We denote the velocities of the centers of mass of the bodies before impact by V1 and V2 and
after impact by V ′
1 and V ′
2 . Since the ﬁrst body overtakes the second body, we have V1 > V2, V ′
1 ≤V ′
2 before
impact and
V ′
2 –V ′
1
V1–V2 = ε after impact.
Since the acting impact momenta are internal, the law of conservation of momentum on impact holds,
which, in projections onto the direction of the x-axis, gives the ﬁrst equation
m1V1 + m2V2 = m1V ′
1 + m2V ′
2 .
In addition, for a known coefﬁcient of elasticity, there is a second equation relating the unknowns V ′
1 and V ′
2 :
ε(V1 – V2) = V ′
2 – V ′
1 .
By solving the resulting system of two equations, we obtain
V ′
1 = V1 + m2(1 + ε)(V2 – V1)
m1 + m2
,
V ′
2 = V2 + m1(1 + ε)(V1 – V2)
m2 + m1
.
Now we ﬁnd the impact momentum S1 applied to the ﬁrst body:
S1 = m1(V ′
1 – V1) = – m1m2(1 + ε)(V1 – V2)
m1 + m2
.
The impact momentum S2 applied to the second body is related to S1 as S2 = –S1.

D’ALEMBERT’S PRINCIPLE. ANALYTICAL MECHANICS
Example 4 (Action of the impact on a body rotating about a ﬁxed axis). To a body rotating with angular
velocity ω about the vertical ﬁxed axis AB, the impact momentum S is applied at point M (Fig. E2.56). In
cylindrical hinges A, B and the thrust bearing, there arise impact momenta SAx, SAy, SAz, SBx, SBy, which
must be found under given dynamic characteristics of the body.
Figure E2.56. Impact on a body rotating about a ﬁxed axis.
Solution. To make the further calculations more convenient, we place the coordinate axes so that the axis
Oz coincides with the axis of rotation (xA = yA = xB = yB = 0; ωx = ωy = 0) and the center of mass of the
body C lie in the plane yAz (yC = 0); in addition, we choose the origin, i.e., point O, so that the point of
application of the impact momentum M lies in the plane xOy (zM = 0).
The theorem on the variation in the momentum of the body and the theorem on the variation in its angular
momentum about the center O acquire the form
m(V′
C – VC) = S + SA + SB,
K′
O – KO = rM × S + rA × SA + rB × SB,
where SA and SB are the momenta of the constraint reaction forces, rM is the position vector of point M, and
VC, K and V′
C, K′
A are the velocity of the center of mass and the angular momentum of the body before and
after the impact.
To two vector equations, there corresponds a system of six scalar equations
Sx + SAx + SBx = myC(ω – ω′),
Sy + SAy + SBy = 0,
Sz + SAz = 0,
–Ixz(ω′ – ω) = yMSz – zASAy – zBSBy,
–Iyz(ω′ – ω) = –xMSz + zASAx + zBSBx,
Izz(ω′ – ω) = xMSy – yMSx,
with six unknowns ω′, SAx, SAy, SAz, SBx, SBy.
From the sixth equation, we obtain the body angular velocity after the impact:
ω′ = ω +
1
Izz (xMSy – yMSx),
and then ﬁnd the impact momenta of the constraint reactions.
Now we obtain the conditions under which there are no impact momenta of the constraint reactions. In
this case, the point of application of the impact momentum is called the center of impact.
If there are no impact momenta of the supports SAx = SAy = SAz = SBx = SBy = 0, then the system of
the above-obtained equations becomes
Sx = myÑ(ω′ – ω),
Sy = 0,
Sz = 0,
–Ixz(ω′ – ω) = yMSz,
–Iyz(ω′ – ω) = –xMSz,
Izz(ω′ – ω) = xMSy – yMSx.

BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR CHAPTER E2
743
This implies that the supports do not experience impact loads if
1. The external impact momentum is perpendicular to the plane passing through the center of mass and
the axis of rotation of the body, because it follows from the second and third equations that Sy = 0 and Sz = 0.
2. The axis of the body rotation is a principal axis of inertia for the point O at which it intersects the
orthogonal plane containing the point of application of the impact momentum, because it follows from the
fourth and ﬁfth equations that Ixz = Iyz = 0.
3. The position of the impact center is determined by the formula yM = –Izz.myC, which follows from
the ﬁrst and sixth equations.
The theorem on the variation in the kinetic energy of a material system on impact (the
Carnot theorem) is formulated for two cases: instantaneous imposition of constraints and
instantaneous removal of constraints.
THEOREM (CARNOT).
(i) The kinetic energy lost by the system in instantaneous imposition of absolutely
inelastic constraints on it is equal to the kinetic energy that the system would have if its
points moved with the lost velocities:
T – T ′ =
X
ν
1
2 mν(vν – v′
ν)2;
this is the case in which the impact has only the ﬁrst phase.
(ii) The kinetic energy acquired by the system in instantaneous removal of constraints
is equal to the kinetic energy that the system would have if its points moved with acquired
velocities:
T ′ – T =
X
ν

2 mν(v′

this is the case where the impact has only the second phase.

Chapter E3
Elements of Strength of Materials
E3.1. Basic Notions
E3.1.1. Introduction. External and Internal Forces
◮Deformation, strength, and rigidity. The strength of materials is the ﬁeld of mechanics
where design and analysis of structural members for strength, rigidity, and stability are
considered.
The strength of materials is based on the knowledge accumulated in theoretical mechan-
ics. The difference is that the object in theoretical mechanics is an absolutely rigid body,
but the strength of materials deals with deformable rigid bodies.
In practice, the actual members of machines and structures experience the action of
different forces. Under the action of these forces, the bodies are deformed; i.e., the mutual
position of the material particles is changed. If the forces are sufﬁciently large, then the
body fracture may occur.
The ability of a body to take loads without fracture and large deformations is called the
strength and rigidity, respectively.
Several equilibria of bodiesandstructures areunstable; i.e., inthese states, anynegligible
actions of random character, as a rule, may lead to signiﬁcant deviations from these states.
But if the deviations are also small, then such equilibria are said to be stable.
◮External forces. The external forces acting on a structure comprise the active forces
(loads) and the reactions of external constraints. Several types of loads are distinguished.
Lumped force applied at a point. They are introduced instead of actual forces acting on
a small site of the surface of a structural member whose dimensions can be neglected.
Distributed forces. For example, the forces of ﬂuid pressure on the vessel bottom are
loads distributed over the surface and are measured in N/m2, and the weight forces are loads
distributed over the volume and measured in N/m3. In several cases, a load distributed over
a line is introduced; the intensity of such a load is measured in N/m.
One version of the load is the lumped torque (couple of forces).
◮Internal forces in a rod. The rod is the most widespread structural member; therefore,
the main attention in the strength of materials is paid to the rod.
The longitudinal axis and the transverse cross-section are the basic geometric elements
of the rod. It is assumed that the rod transverse cross-sections are perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis, and the longitudinal axis passes through the centers of gravity of the
transverse cross-sections.
The internal forces of a rod are the forces of interaction between its separate parts arising
under the action of external forces (it is assumed that, in the absence of external forces, the
internal forces are zero).
We consider a rod in equilibrium under the action of a system of external forces
(Fig. E3.1a).
We mentally draw an arbitrary transverse cross-section dividing the rod
into two parts L and R. The right part R is subjected to a system of forces exerted the
left part L and distributed over the surface of the transverse cross-section, i.e., a system of
internal forces with respect to the entire rod. This system can be reduced to the resultant
745

vector R and the resultant moment M if the center of gravity of the cross-section, i.e.,
point O, is taken to be the center of reduction.

Figure E3.1. Internal forces in a rod: (a) (imaginary) cross-section of the rod, (b) internal forces and moments
at the cross-section.
◮Internal force factors. We choose the coordinate system so that the axes x, y lie in the
transverse cross-section and the axis z is perpendicular to it and decompose R and M into
components in these axes: Qx, Qy, N and Mx, My, Mz (Fig. E3.1b).
These six quantities are called internal force factors of the rod (or internal forces)
in the cross-section under study. Each of these forces has its own name corresponding
to its direction or the speciﬁc form of the rod deformation caused by these forces. The
forces Qx and Qy are called the transverse (cross-axis) forces, and N is called the normal
(longitudinal) force. The moments Mx and My are called the bending moments, and Mz is
called the twisting moment.
◮Method of sections. Since the cut-off part of the rod R is in equilibrium, it is possible
to compose six static equations for the forces acting on this part, which determine all six
internal force factors:
X
Fx = 0,
X
mx(F) = 0,
X
Fy = 0,
X
my(F) = 0,
X
Fz = 0,
X
mz(F) = 0.
This method for determining the internal forces is called the method of sections.
On the basis of the law of action and reaction, the right-hand part of the rod acts on the
left-hand part with equal but opposite forces; therefore, they can also be determined starting
from the fact that the rod part L is in equilibrium.
E3.1.2. Stresses and Strains at a Point
◮Stresses. The stress vector p is the intensity of internal forces distributed over the cross-
section, at a point of the cross-section (Fig. E3.2). Its components lying in the plane of the
cross-section are called tangential (shear) stresses τx, τy, and the component perpendicular
to the cross-section is called the normal stress σ. The stresses are measured in N/m2 (Pa)
and depend not only on the choice of the point but also on the orientation of the cross-section
(or of the site dA, Fig. E3.2) passing through this point. The complete set of stresses at a
given point for different sites is called the stress state at this point.
If the stresses in the rod cross-section are known, then its internal force factors can be
found by the formulas

where the integrals are taken over the entire cross-section area A.
◮Strains. Consider an arbitrary point K of the body in the initial unstrained state and
draw two inﬁnitely small segments of lengths dx and dy through this point in the direction
of the axes x and y (Fig. E3.3).
Under the action of the load, the body is strained, the point K moves to the point K′,
the segments dx and dy change their lengths by ∆x and ∆y, and the angle π/2 between
them varies by γxy.
The ratios
εx = ∆x
dx ,
εy = ∆y
dy
are called the linear strains at point K in the direction of the axes x and y, respectively, and
the quantity γxy is called the angular strain (shear angle) at point K between the axes x
and y. The complete set of linear and angular strains in different directions passing through
the point under study is called the strain state at this point.
E3.1.3. Basic Notions and Hypotheses
◮Elasticity is the property of a body that is expressed as a unique dependence between
the forces acting on the body and the body strains. In particular, an elastic body returns to
the initial state after the loads are removed.
In several cases, after the loads are removed, only part of the total strain disappears, and
this part is said to be elastic. The remaining part, the so-called residual (plastic) strain, is
related to the body property called plasticity.
◮Basic hypotheses accepted in the strength of materials:
1. The bodies are assumed to be solid (without hollows) and homogeneous; i.e., the
properties of the body material are the same at different points.
2. The body material is isotropic; i.e., its properties are the same in all directions. (In
several cases, it is necessary to abandon this assumption for anisotropic bodies, whose
material properties are different in different directions. For example, the properties of wood
in the directions along the ﬁbers and across them are different.)
3. The body strains at each point are directly proportional to the stresses at this point.
This property is called the linear elasticity law or Hooke’s law.
4. It is assumed that the strains in the body, as well as the displacements of its particles,
are small compared with the geometric dimensions of the body itself.
5. The principle of independence of forces (principle of superposition) holds, according
to which any quantity a depending on the action of several forces is equal to the sum of

748
ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
quantities ai determined for each separate force. This principle follows from hypotheses 3
and 4.
E3.2. Stress–Strain State at a Point
E3.2.1. Types of Stress State
◮Principal stresses and principal directions. An analysis of the stress state at a point K
of the body becomes more convenient if we mentally separate an elementary parallelepiped
around this point and consider the stresses acting on its faces. Since the parallelepiped is
small, we can assume that the stress state is the same at all of its points (is homogeneous)
and coincides with the stress state at point K under study.
Varying the orientation of
this parallelepiped, we can make all its faces free of shear stresses. The corresponding
normal stresses are called the principal stresses, and their directions are called the principal
directions at point K.
The linear, plane, volumetric (uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial) stress states at a point
are distinguished depending on whether the parallelepiped oriented in the principal direc-
tions experiences extension (or compression) respectively in one, two, or three mutually
perpendicular directions.
◮Plane stress state. Reciprocity law. In what follows, because of its special importance,
we consider only the case of plane stress state in which there are no stresses on two
opposite faces of an elementary parallelepiped. The other faces, in the general case of their
orientation, are under the action of the shear and normal stresses (Fig. E3.4). Since the
parallelepiped stress state is homogenous, it follows that the similar stresses on opposite
faces are numerically equal. Obviously, the normal forces are mutually balanced on the
parallelepiped faces. The tangential forces on the same faces form two couples of forces
with moments (τy dy dx) dz and (τz dz dx) dy of opposite direction, where dx, dy, dz—are
the parallelepiped dimensions. These moments must be balanced, which implies τz = τy.

Figure E3.4. Plane stress state at a point.
The last equality expresses the reciprocity law for shear stresses: on any mutually
perpendicular sites, the shear stresses are equal in value and directed so that they tend to
rotate the element in opposite directions (Fig. E3.4). The aforesaid allows one to introduce
the unique notation: τ = τz = τy.
E3.2.2. Uniaxial Tension and Compression
◮Modulus of elasticity of the ﬁrst kind. We consider an elementary parallelepiped in
the state of uniaxial tension or compression with only normal stresses acting on its two
opposite faces (Fig. E3.5).

Figure E3.5. (a) Uniaxial tension and (b) uniaxial compression.
Rule of signs: the tensile stresses are assumed to be positive, and the compressing
stresses are assumed to be negative. According to Hooke’s law, the stress and the linear
strain in the direction of the axis z are directly proportional:
σ = Eεz.
(E3.2.2.1)
The proportionality coefﬁcient E is called the modulus of elasticity of the ﬁrst kind and
has the dimension of stress, because εz is a dimensionless variable. For σ > 0 (tension), εz is
also greater than zero, which corresponds to the parallelepiped elongation in the direction of
the axis z. For σ < 0 (compression), we have εz < 0, which corresponds to the parallelepiped
shortening.
◮Poisson coefﬁcient. Because of symmetry, the linear strains in the directions of the
axes x and y are equal to each other and also proportional to the stress, or, with (E3.2.2.1)
taken into account, to the strain εz:
εx = εy = –νεz = – νσ
E .
(E3.2.2.2)
The constant dimensionless proportionality coefﬁcient ν is called the Poisson ratio,
and the minus sign takes into account the opposite signs of the longitudinal strain εz and
transverse strains εx and εy. In particular, for σ > 0 and εz > 0, the quantities εx and εy are
less than zero, and hence the parallelepiped transverse dimensions decrease.
The constant quantities E and ν characterize the elastic properties of a speciﬁc material;
for example, for steel we have E = 210 GPa, 0.25 ≤ν ≤0.30.
E3.2.3. Simple Shear
◮Simple shear. Consider a speciﬁc form of plane stress state in which the lateral faces of
an elementary parallelepiped are only under the action of shear stresses τ (Fig. E3.6a). By
the reciprocity law, the stresses on neighboring faces are the same. Such a form of stress
state is called the simple shear.

The character of the parallelepiped strain is shown in Fig. E3.6b. Initially, the right
angles between the lateral faces vary by the quantity γ, which is called the shear angle, and
the linear strains εx, εy, εz are zero.
◮Shear modulus. In this case, Hooke’s law has the form
τ = Gγ.
(E3.2.3.1)

750
ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
The proportionality coefﬁcient G is called the shear modulus or the modulus of elasticity
of the second kind. The modulus dimension coincides with the dimension of stresses.
It is easy to see that, for dy = dz, the diagonal segment AB in the parallelepiped becomes
shorter and the segment CD elongates by the same value ∆= γ dy sin 45◦(Fig. E3.6b);
therefore, the other elementary parallelepiped, distinguished in a neighborhood of the same
point and rotated by the angle 45◦with respect to the ﬁrst parallelepiped, must be under the
action of the corresponding normal stresses σ (Fig. E3.6c). In this case, there are already no
shear stresses, and hence the normal stresses σ are the principal stresses, and their directions
are the principal directions for a given stress state.
◮Relation between G, E, and ν. Consider the element formed by the diagonal cut of
the parallelepiped (see Fig. E3.7). Its faces are under the action of forces whose values are
equal to τ dx dy, τ dx dz, and σ dx dz/cos 45◦.

(E3.2.3.2)
With (E3.2.3.1) and (E3.2.3.2) taken into account, the strain of segment CD (Fig. E3.6b)
is equal to εCD = ∆/CD = 1
2 γ = 1
2 τ/G = 1

On the other hand, treating the state in Fig. E3.6c as a combination of two uniaxial stress

2(1 + ν) .
Thus, the shear modulus G is determined via the already introduced constants E and ν.
E3.3. Central Tension and Compression
E3.3.1. Longitudinal Force
The central tension (compression) is a type of a rod deformation such that only a longitudinal
force N arises in the rod transverse cross-sections and all the other internal forces are zero.
Rule of signs: the tensile longitudinal forces are assumed to be positive, and the
compressing longitudinal forces are assumed to be negative.
Example. In Fig. E3.8a we show a rod loaded by two forces F1 and F2 lying on its axis. The longitudinal
force will be determined by the method of sections (see Subsection E3.1.1). We draw an arbitrary cross-section I
on segment “a” of the rod and consider the equilibrium of the free cut-off part (Fig. E3.8b). We replace the
action of the cut-off part by an unknown force N1 assuming that it is positive. The equilibrium equation for
this cut-off part, stating that the sum of projections of all forces on the axis z is zero, i.e., N1 – F1 = 0, implies

that N1 = F1 = 20 kN. Similarly, for the cross-section II on segment “b” of the rod, we obtain (Fig. E3.8c)
N2 + F2 – F1 = 0, which implies N2 = F1 – F2 = –40 kN.
Thus, the longitudinal force on segments “a” and “b” of the rod is different. Segment “a” of the rod
experiences tension (N > 0), and segment “b” is under compression (N < 0). In transition from segment “a”
to segment “b,” the force N experiences a jump by the value of the force F2.
To illustrate the character of variation in the longitudinal force along the rod, one usually
constructs the graph of the function N(z), which is called the axial force diagram. This
graph presents numerical values of the longitudinal (axial) force in typical cross-sections
and their signs. For the example under study, the diagram of N(z) is shown in Fig. E3.8d.
E3.3.2. Stresses and Strains under Tension or Compression
◮Flat cross-section hypothesis.
The stresses under tension or compression will be
determined by using the ﬂat cross-section hypothesis: after strain, the rod transverse cross-
sections remain plane and perpendicular to the rod axis.
Experiments show that this
hypothesis is violated only in the regions of the so-called local stresses, immediately near
the points of application of external forces or sites of sharp variation in the area of the
transverse cross-section, where the so-called stress concentration occurs. Taking them into
account is a special problem, and we do not consider it here.
◮Formulas for stresses and strains. Consider a rod under the action of two tensile forces
(Fig. E3.9a). According to the ﬂat cross-section hypothesis and the fact that the longitudinal
force is constant along the rod (N = F), the stress–strain state of the rod points outside
a neighborhood of the endpoints is homogeneous, and the normal stresses are uniformly
distributed over the transverse cross-section (Fig. E3.9b).

ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
It follows from formula (E3.1.2.1) that N =
R
A σ dA = σA, which implies
σ = N
A .
(E3.3.2.1)
Formula (E3.3.2.1) permits calculating the normal stresses in the rod transverse cross-
sections in the case of central tension or compression from the known longitudinal force N
and the known area A of the transverse cross-section.
The elementary parallelepiped separated in the rod is with the conditions of uniaxial
tension (Fig. E3.5a). Its strains are determined by Hooke’s law (see Subsection E3.2.2). In
particular, the longitudinal strain is
εz = σ
E = N
EA .
Summing the elongations of small elements over the entire length of the rod, we obtain
its absolute elongation
∆l =
Z l
0
εz dz = εzl = Nl
EA ,
where l is the rod length.
The quantity EA is called the rigidity of the rod cross-section under tension and
compression.
E3.3.3. Strength Analysis under Tension and Compression
◮Admissible stress. To ensure the strength of a rod under tension or compression, it
is necessary to bound the maximum stresses of this rod by a value called the admissible
stress [σ]. Its value is chosen on the basis of the unsafe stress value, which is introduced
in advance for a given material, with the safety margin taken into account. For materials
that differently resist tension and compression, the two different admissible stresses [σt]
and [σc] are introduced.
◮Problems for strength analysis. Thus, the strength condition in this case has the form
σmax = |N|
A ≤[σ].
Using this condition, one can solve the following problems:
1. From given loads, cross-section dimensions, and the value of admissible stress, verify
the rod strength.
2. From given loads and a known value of admissible stress, ﬁnd the dimensions of the
transverse cross-section:
A ≥|N|
[σ] .
3. From given cross-section dimensions and a known value of admissible stress, ﬁnd
the value of admissible longitudinal force:
N ≤[σ]A.
Example. For a cast-iron rod (Fig. E3.8a) with cross-section area A = 5 cm2, it is necessary to verify the
strength conditions for [σt] = 30 MPa, [σc] = 100 MPa.
Solution. On segment “a,” the rod is under the action of the tensile force N1 = 20 kN (see Fig. E3.8d);
therefore, the normal stress in the cross-sections on this segment is σ1 = N1/A = 40 MPa.
On segment “b,” the rod is under compression, N2 = –40 kN. The corresponding stress is σ2 = |N2|/A =
80 MPa.
Since the admissible stresses under tension and compression for cast iron are different, it is necessary to
verify two conditions, σ1 ≤[σt] and σ2 ≤[σc]. The ﬁrst condition is not satisﬁed, and hence the strength
condition is not satisﬁed in the whole.

E3.4. TORSION
753
E3.4. Torsion
E3.4.1. Twisting Moment
The torsion is a type of rod deformation such that only the twisting moment Mz arises in
the rod transverse cross-sections and all the other internal force factors are zero.
Rule of signs: if observed on the side of the external normal to the cross-section, the
twisting moment seems to be anticlockwise, then it is assumed to be positive.
Example. Consider a rod loaded by two moments m1 and m2 such that the planes of their action are
perpendicular to the rod axis (Fig. E3.10a). According to the method of sections, we draw an arbitrary transverse
cross-section I on segment “a” and consider the free cut-off part of the rod in equilibrium (Fig. E3.10b). We
replace the action of the cut-off part by an unknown twisting moment Mz1 assuming that its direction is positive.
The equilibrium equation for the cut-off part, stating that the sum of moments of all forces about the axis z is
zero, i.e., Mz1 –m1 = 0, implies that Mz1 = m1 = 30 kN m. Similarly, for cross-section II we have (Fig. E3.10c)
Mz2 + m2 – m1 = 0, which implies Mz2 = m1 – m2 = –10 kN m.

In Fig. E3.10d, we present the twisting moment diagram, which illustrates the character of variation in Mz
along the rod axis. On the boundary between segments “a” and “b” of the rod, the twisting moment experiences
a jump by the value of the moment m2.
E3.4.2. Stresses and Strains in Torsion
◮Stress state in torsion. We consider only rods whose transverse cross-sections are of a
disk or annulus shape.
To ﬁnd the law of stress distribution over the cross-section, we assume, which is
conﬁrmed experimentally, that the result of deformation is that the rod transverse cross-
sections in torsion rotate about the longitudinal axis as rigid disks (annuli). The applicability
conditions for this assumption are similar to the applicability conditions of the ﬂat cross-
section hypothesis under tension or compression (see Subsection E3.3.2).
Consider a rod experiencing torsion under the action of two moments applied at its ends
(Fig. E3.11a). We divide it into coaxial tubes (Fig. E3.11b) and distinguish one of them
with the internal radius ρ and inﬁnitely small thickness dρ (Fig. E3.11c).
By the above assumption about the rod strain character, we assume that an inﬁnitely
small element ACBD of the tube (Fig. E3.11c) experiences a strain corresponding to simple
shear (see Subsection E3.2.3). This implies that only the shear stresses τ act on the lateral
faces of the element (see Fig. E3.6a).
◮Polar moment of inertia. The shear angle of an element is γ = BB′/dz = ρ dϕ/dz
(Fig. E3.11c), where dϕ/dz is the running angle of torsion of the tube or the angle of torsion

τ = Gγ = Gρ dϕ
dz .
(E3.4.2.1)
The value of the running angle of torsion dϕ/dz is the same for all coaxial tubes
comprising the rod. Therefore, it follows from formula (E3.4.2.1) that the shear stresses in
the rod cross-sections are directly proportional to the distance ρ to its axis (Fig. E3.12).

For a disk of diameter D, we have Ip = π
32 D4.
For an annulus, we have Ip =

diameters, respectively.

The angle of torsion of the entire rod in Fig. E3.11a—i.e., the angle of mutual rotation
of its end cross-sections—can be found if we know the running angle of torsion (E3.4.2.3)
and take into account the fact that the value of Mz is constant along the rod axis (Mz = m):
∆ϕ =

where l is the rod length.
The quantity GIp is called the cross-section rigidity in torsion or torsional rigidity.
E3.4.3. Strength Analysis in Torsion
The value of the maximum shear stress in torsion is found from formula (E3.4.2.4) for
ρ = ρmax:
τmax = |Mz|ρmax
Ip
= |Mz|
Wp
.
(E3.4.3.1)
The quantity Wp = Ip/ρmax is called the polar moment of resistance of the cross-section.
For a disk, we have Wp = π
16 D3.
For an annulus, we have Wp = π
16 D3(1 – d4/D4).
The strength condition is reduced to the inequality τmax = |Mz|/Wp ≤[τ], where [τ] is
the admissible stress in torsion.
Just as in case of strength calculated under tension and compression, the following three
types of problems are possible, which differ in the form of the strength condition.
1. Checking calculation: |Mz|/Wp ≤[τ].
2. Choosing the cross-section: Wp ≥|Mz|/[τ].
3. Determining the admissible load: |Mz| ≤[τ]Wp.
Example. For a steel rod of circular cross-section (Fig. E3.10a), choose the diameter from the strength
condition for [τ] = 100 MPa.
Solution. Since the cross-section is constant along the rod, the cross-sections are unsafe on segment “a,”
where the maximum twisting moment Mz = 30 kN m arises (see Fig. E3.10d).
From the strength condition
τmax = Mz
Wp = 16 Mz
πD3
≤[τ]
we obtain D ≥

16Mz/(π[τ]) = 0.119 m.
Rounding up, we ﬁnally obtain D = 12 cm.
E3.5. Symmetrical Bending
E3.5.1. Bending Moment and Transverse Force
◮Deﬁnitions. The bending is a type of rod deformation such that the bending moments
Mx and My and, perhaps, the transverse forces Qx and Qy arise in the rod cross-sections
and the other internal force factors (N and Mz) are zero.
If the transverse forces are zero, the bending is said to be pure, and if there are transverse
forces, then we have the so-called lateral bending.
Consider the rods whose cross-sections have the axis of symmetry y. If such a rod
is subjected to a system of external forces lying in the plane yz and perpendicular to the
rod longitudinal axis (Fig. E3.13), then only two internal force factors—i.e., the bending

moment Mx and the transverse force Qy—arise in its cross-section. Such a bending is said
to be symmetric (for the oblique bending, see Subsection E3.6.1).
Rule of signs: the bending moment is assumed to be positive if it results in extension
of the lower ﬁbers and compression of the upper ﬁbers; the transverse force is positive if
it is directed downwards acting on the cross-section from the right and is directed upwards
acting on the cross-section from the left.
As was already noted, the rod internal force factors depend on the longitudinal coordinate
of the cross-section under study; hence, they are functions of the variable z.
◮Differential equations of equilibrium of a rod. Consider a rod under the action of
a load q distributed along its axis (Fig. E3.14a). We distinguish a small element by two
cross-sections (Fig. E3.14b) and replace the action of the cut-off parts of the rod by the
corresponding internal forces with positive directions.

Calculating the sum of projections of all forces on the axis y and the sum of moments
of forces about the point O, we obtain the corresponding equations of equilibrium of the
element:
q dz + Qy – (Qy + dQy) = 0,
–Mx + (Mx + dMx) – Qy dz = 0.
These equations imply the relations

tion (E3.5.1.1), which must be satisﬁed by the functions Qy(z) and Mx(z), is often used to
construct diagrams of bending moments and transverse forces, and to verify this construc-
tion.
The rods that mainly work under bending are usually called beams.
◮Examples of diagram construction. Consider examples of constructing diagrams of
Qy(z) and Mx(z) for several beams by using the method of sections.

Figure E3.15. Cantilever beam (with clamped end): (a) loaded with a point force, (b) loaded with an evenly
distributed force, (c) loaded with a moment.
In Fig. E3.15a, we show a cantilever beam (i.e., a beam with a ﬁxed end) loaded by a lumped force.
According to the method of sections, we draw an arbitrary cross-section K at a distance z from the free end
of the beam and consider the free cut-off part in equilibrium. We replace the action of the cut-off part by the
unknown forces Qy and Mx assuming that their directions are positive. Calculating the sum of projections of
all forces on the axis y and the sum of moments of forces about the point K, we compose the corresponding
equations of equilibrium,
Qy – F = 0,
–Mx – Fz = 0,
and whence obtain Qy = F, Mx = –Fz. Thus, the transverse force is constant and the bending moment varies
directly proportionally to the distance z taking the values 0 and –Fl at the free (z = 0) and ﬁxed (z = l) ends of
the beam, respectively. In Fig. E3.15a, we present the corresponding diagrams of Qy and Mx.
The same procedure for a beam uniformly loaded by a distributed load (Fig. E3.15b) gives
–qz – Qy = 0,
1
2 qz2 + Mx = 0,
which implies Qy = –qz and Mx = – 1
2 qz2. In this case, the transverse force is a linear function of z, and the
bending moment depends on z according to the quadratic parabola law, which agrees with the diagrams of Qy
and Mx in Fig. E3.15b.
Similarly, for a cantilever beam loaded by a moment (Fig. E3.15c), we obtain Qy = 0, Mx = m.
For two-support beams (Fig. E3.16) that do not have free ends, it is necessary ﬁrst to ﬁnd the support
reactions from the equilibrium conditions for the beam as a whole. After this, one can determine the internal
forces by analogy with the above procedure.

Figure E3.16. A beam hinged at both ends: (a) loaded with a point force, (b) loaded with an evenly distributed

For an arbitrary cross-section on segment AB of a beam loaded at the center (AB = BC = l/2) by a lumped
force F (Fig. E3.16a), we obtain Qy = R1 = F/2, Mx = R1z = Fz/2, where z is the distance from the left
end A. For a cross-section on segment BC, we ﬁnd Qy = R1 –F = –F/2, Mx = R1z –F(z –l/2) = F(l –z)/2.
The corresponding diagrams are given at the bottom of Fig. E3.16a.

758
ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
For the beam in Fig. E3.16b: Qy = R1 – qz = q(l/2 – z), Mx = R1z – qz2/2 = qz(l – z)/2. At the middle
of the beam, we have Mx = ql2/8.
For segment AB of the beam in Fig. E3.16c, we have Qy = R1 = m/l, Mx = R1z = mz/l, and for
segment BC, we have Qy = R1 = m/l, Mx = R1z – m = m(z/l – 1).
◮Speciﬁc characteristics of diagrams of Mx and Qy. We brieﬂy formulate the diagram
qualitative characteristics, which follows from relations (E3.5.1.1).
1. On the beam part free from any load (q = 0), Qy is constant, and Mx is a linear
function of z.
2. On the segment of uniformly distributed load (q = const), Qy is a linear function,
and Mx is a quadratic function (see Figs. E3.15b and E3.16b).
3. At the points of application of the lumped force, Qy experiences a jump by the value
of this force, and the diagram of Mx has a break point (Fig. E3.16a).
4. At the points of application of the lumped moment, Mx experiences a jump by the
value of this moment (Fig. E3.16c).
At the extrema points of the function Mx, Qy = 0 (Fig. E3.16b).
The knowledge of qualitative characteristics of diagrams allows one to construct dia-
grams without ﬁnding the functional dependencies Qy(z) and Mx(z) but calculating the
values of Qy and Mx only on the boundaries of typical segments. The extremum values
of Mx are determined after ﬁnding the extrema points from the conditions Qy = 0.
E3.5.2. Stresses and Strains under Symmetric Pure Bending
◮Pure bending hypotheses. Consider a beam in the state of pure bending (Fig. E3.17).
In its cross-sections, there arises a single nonzero force factor, i.e., the constant bending
moment Mx = m.

Figure E3.17. Simple pure bending of a beam: (a) deformation in bending, (b) deformation of a small element.
We use the ﬂat cross-section hypothesis*: after the strain, the beam cross-sections plane
before the strain remain plane and perpendicular to the strained longitudinal axis.
According to this hypothesis, two close cross-sections rotate about each other by an
angle dϕ (Fig. E3.17b).
As a result of such strain, there arises a neutral layer whose
longitudinal ﬁbers O – O do not change their length. In the lower part of the cross-section,
the longitudinal ﬁbers elongate (in the upper part, become shorter) by the value ∆= –y dϕ.
The longitudinal strain of a ﬁber is equal to ε = ∆/dz = –y dϕ/(ρ dϕ) = –y/ρ, where ρ is
the radius of curvature of the neutral layer.
* A similar hypothesis was used in Subsection E3.3.2.

E3.5. SYMMETRICAL BENDING
759
In addition to the ﬂat cross-section hypothesis, we assume that the beam longitudinal
ﬁbers do not exert their weight upon one another. This means that they are in the state of
uniaxial tension or compression (see Fig. E3.5).
◮Axis curvature. Formula for normal stresses. According to Hooke’s law, we have
σ = Eε = – Ey
ρ .
(E3.5.2.1)
This implies that the normal stresses σ in the beam cross-section vary directly proportionally
to the distance y from the neutral layer (Fig. E3.18).

product EIx is called the cross-section rigidity in bending or ﬂexural rigidity.

are extended (y < 0, σ > 0); for Mx < 0, the signs of stresses in the upper and lower parts
of the cross-section are changed to the opposite.

ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
E3.5.3. Stresses and Strains in Symmetric Lateral Bending
◮Shear stresses. Zhuravskii formula. In the case of symmetric lateral bending, in the
rod cross-sections there arises not only a bending moment Mx but also a transverse force Qy
related to the shear stresses in the cross-section by the formula
Qy =

A
τy dA.
Although there are shear stresses, formulas (E3.5.2.2) and (E3.5.2.3) obtained for the
pure bending can also be used in this case.
Todetermine the shear stresses, consider the beam in Fig. E3.20a. We cut a small element
from it by two neighboring cross-sections and one longitudinal cross-section (Fig. E3.20b).
The normal stresses calculated by formula (E3.5.2.3) act on its lateral faces. Since the bend-
ing moment on the right is greater than the bending moment on the left by the value dMx,
the normal stress on the right is also greater by dσ = dMxy/Ix.

E3.5.4. Strength Analysis in the Case of Symmetric Bending
◮Maximal stresses. It follows from formula (E3.5.2.3) that the maximum (in magnitude)

Wx = bh2

and
σmax = 6|Mx|

(E3.5.4.2)

ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
We compare the quantities σmax and τmax for a beam of rectangular cross-section. In
the order of magnitude, Qy ∼F and Mx ∼Fl, where F is the characteristic force acting
on the beam and l is the beam length. Then it follows from (E3.5.3.2) and (E3.5.4.2) that
τmax
σmax
∼h
l ≪1.
Thus, the shear stresses are small compared with the normal stresses. This conclusion also
holds for rods with cross-sections of different shapes (an exception is thin-walled rods, in
which the appearance of large shear stresses is possible).
◮Beam strength conditions. As a rule, the strength analysis for beams is performed for
the normal stresses using the strength condition in the form
σmax = |Mx|
Wx

But if the rod material (for example, wood) badly resists the shear strains (cut off), then
the calculations for the shear stresses are also necessary:
τmax = |Qy|

In the cases where the rod material has different admissible stresses under tension [σt]

where yt

Just as in the case of tension and compression or torsion, in the strength analysis for
rods under bending, one solves the following three problems:
1) checking calculation,
2) choosing the cross-section,
3) determining the admissible load.
All geometric characteristics required in strength analysis of rolled cross-sections (dou-
ble tee, channel bar, etc.) are given in special tables called the range of rolled steel products.
Example. For a steel double tee beam (No. 55) of length l = 3.2 m (see Fig. E3.16b), determine the
admissible load [q] for [σ] = 160 MPa from the strength condition.
Solution. For the beam under study, the unsafe cross-section is that in the middle of the beam span, where
the maximum bending moment Mx = ql2/8 arises.
In the range of rolled steel products, we ﬁnd the resistance moment Wx = 2000 cm3 for the double tee.
It follows from the strength condition
σmax = Mx
Wx =
ql2
8Wx ≤[σ]
that q ≤8Wx[σ]/l2 = 250 N/m. Thus, [q] = 250 kN/m.

force factors arise simultaneously in the rod cross-sections. An exception is the symmetric
lateral bending, which is considered as a simple type of strain, although there are two
force factors in this case, the bending moment and the transverse force, because in the
overwhelming majority of cases, the strength and rigidity analysis are performed without
taking into account the transverse forces, i.e., for a single force factor, which is the bending
moment.
E3.6.1. Oblique Bending
◮Deﬁnition. When studying the symmetric lateral bending, we assume that the cross-
section is symmetric with respect to the axis y. It turns out that all the results of Section E3.5
also hold for cross-sections of arbitrary shape if the axes x and y are the principal central
axes of inertia; i.e., they are mutually perpendicular axes passing through the cross-section
center of gravity and the axial moments of inertia about these axes take extremum values.
In what follows, for the axes x and y we take the principal central axes.
The oblique bending is the general case of the rod bending (see Subsection E3.5.1) in
which two bending moments Mx and My and perhaps the transverse forces Qx and Qy
appear in the rod cross-section.
Using the force superposition principle, we can determine the normal stresses at any
point of the cross-section with coordinates x, y by the formula
σ = – Mxy
Ix
– Myx
Iy
,
(E3.6.1.1)
which follows from formula (E3.5.2.3).
◮Neutral axis in the case of oblique bending. Just as in the case of symmetric bending,
in the cross-section there exists a neutral axis at whose points the stresses are zero. It is
determined by the equation
Mxy
Ix
+ Myx
Iy
= 0.
(E3.6.1.2)
Listed below are several properties of the neutral axis in oblique bending.

ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
2. The neutral axis divides the cross-section into two parts: in one of them, σ > 0, in
the other, σ < 0.
3. The normal stresses in the cross-section vary directly proportionally to the distance
from the neutral axis attaining the maximum values (in magnitude) at the cross-section
points most remote from the neutral axis.
The shear stresses in the cross-section (Fig. E3.22) can be determined by formula
(E3.5.3.1):
τy = QyScut

τx =

Just as in the case of symmetric lateral bending, the shear stresses, as a rule, play
a secondary role, and hence the strength conditions impose constraints on the maximum
normal stresses.
Example. Calculate the maximum normal stresses in the unsafe cross-section of the beam (Fig. E3.23)
under oblique bending. The cross-section is of rectangular shape, b = 6 cm, h = 12 cm.

Solution. In Fig. E3.23b and d, we show the beam loading diagram in the vertical and horizontal planes,
and in Fig. E3.23c and e, the corresponding diagrams of the bending moments Mx, My. Judging from these
diagrams, the unsafe cross-section is the ﬁxation cross-section, where Mx = –20 kN m, My = 5 kN m.
For the rectangular cross-section, Ix = bh3/12, Iy = hb3/12, and the neutral axis equation (E3.6.1.2) for
the unsafe cross-section takes the form –y + x = 0.
It follows from the position of the neutral line (Fig. E3.24) that the most unsafe points of the cross-
section are points B and C; i.e., the points most remote from the neutral axis. Substituting their coordinates
into (E3.6.1.1), we calculate the stresses at these points
σB = – MxyB
Ix
– MyxB
Iy
= 208 MPa,
σC = – MxyC
Ix

In Fig. E3.24, we show the diagram for σ, which characterized the variations in the normal stresses in the
direction perpendicular to the neutral axis.

E3.6.2. Eccentric Extension or Compression
◮The eccentric extension or compression is a type of a rod deformation such that the
longitudinal force N and bending moments Mx, My (and perhaps the transverse forces
Qx, Qy) arise in the rod cross-section.
The longitudinal force and the bending moments can be treated as the result of action
of an eccentrically applied force F = N on the rod (Fig. E3.25). Therefore, such a type of
combined stresses is called eccentric extension or compression.

Figure E3.25. Eccentric extension of a rod.
The bending moments are related to the coordinates of the point of application of
the force F by the relations Mx = –FyF , My = –FxF .
Therefore, from (E3.6.1.1),
formulas (E3.3.2.1), and the force superposition principle for normal stresses at an arbitrary
point of any cross-section with coordinates x, y, we obtain

(E3.6.2.2)
It is easy to see that the neutral axis does not pass through the center of gravity of
the cross-section. The other properties are the same as in the case of oblique bending. In
addition, we mention one more property of the neutral axis in the case of eccentric extension
or compression: the neutral axis does not intersect the quarter of the cross-section where
the force F is applied.
◮Core of a cross-section. The neutral axis position, as follows from Eq. (E3.6.2.2),
depends on the coordinates of the point of application of the force F. If the point of
application of the force F is sufﬁciently close to the center of gravity of the cross-section,
namely, is in the region which is called the core of the cross-section, then the neutral axis
passes beyond the cross-section; i.e., all the points of the cross-section experience normal
stresses of the same sign. In Fig. E3.26, we show the cores for a rectangular and circular
cross-sections. The strength conditions in the case of eccentric extension or compression
have the form of constraints on the maximum normal stresses.

Example. Calculate the maximum normal stresses in the cross-section of an eccentrically compressed rod
of rectangular cross-section for b = 6 cm, h = 12 cm (Fig. E3.27). The point K of application of the force
F = 144 kN has the coordinates xF = –1 cm, yF = 6 cm (Fig. E3.27b).
Solution. We calculate the geometric characteristics of the cross-section:
A = bh = 72 cm2,
Ix = bh3/12 = 864 cm4,
Iy = hb3/12 = 216 cm4.
The neutral axis equation (E3.6.2.2) becomes 1 + y/2 – x/3 = 0. Its position (Fig. E3.27b) shows that B
and C are the most stressed points of the cross-section. Substituting their coordinates into (E3.6.2.1), we ﬁnd
the stresses at these points (the force F must be taken with “minus” sign, because its direction is opposite to
that shown in Fig. E3.25):

direction perpendicular to the neutral axis.
E3.6.3. Bending with Torsion
◮The bending with torsion is a type of rod deformation such that the twisting mo-
ment Mz, the bending moments Mx and My, and, perhaps, the transverse forces Qx and Qy
arise in its cross-sections.

E3.6. COMBINED STRESS
767
We consider rods of a circular cross-section. Because it is symmetric, any two mutually
perpendicular central axes of the cross-section are principal axes.
Therefore, they can
always be chosen so that, in the cross-section under study, the total bending moment has
only a single component, for example, Mx. The maximum (in magnitude) normal stresses
in the cross-section are determined by formula (E3.5.4.1) for the symmetric bending
σmax = |Mx|
Wx
(E3.6.3.1)
and are attained at points B and C that are most remote from the neutral axis x (Fig. E3.28).
By formula (E3.4.3.1), we obtain the maximum shear stresses in torsion:
τmax = |Mz|
Wp
.
They appear at the points of the cross-section boundary, including points B and C.
Thus, points B and C are the most unsafe points. In their neighborhood, the plane stress
state is realized, which is a combination of uniaxial extension (or compression) and simple
shear.
◮The Saint-Venant and von Mises strength conditions. In contrast to all the strain
types considered above, in this case, both σ and τ may be signiﬁcant, and therefore, the
problem of the strength condition arises for such a stress state. There exist different theories
of strength answering this question.
Most often, one applies the Saint-Venant strength
condition
p
σ2 + 4τ 2 ≤[σ]
or the von Mises strength condition
p
σ2 + 3τ 2 ≤[σ].
Using the relation between the resistance moments Wp = 2Wx and taking into account
the fact that, in the case of arbitrary orientation of the axes x and y, the quantity Mx in
formula (E3.6.3.1) must be replaced by the total bending moment Mb =
q
M2x + M2y, we
reduce the strength conditions to the ﬁnal form:
q
M2x + M2y + M2z
Wx
≤[σ]
(Saint-Venant),
q
M2x + M2y + 0.75M2z
Wx
≤[σ]
(von Mises),
where Wx = πD3/32 is the axial moment of resistance for a disk of diameter D.
Example. Using the von Mises strength condition, ﬁnd the diameter of a steel shaft under bending with
torsion (Fig. E3.29). The admissible stress is [σ] = 150 MPa.
Solution. The diagram of the shaft loading in the vertical plane and the corresponding diagram of the
bending moment Mx are given in Fig. E3.29b and c.
The diagram of the shaft loading by the external moment and the diagram of the arising twisting mo-
ments Mz are given in Fig. E3.29d and e.
The most unsafe cross-section is the ﬁxation cross-section, where the maximum bending Mx = 13 kN m
and twisting Mz = 6 kN m moments arise.
From the strength condition

E3.7. Stability of Compressed Rods
E3.7.1. Critical Force
In Subsection E3.1.1, it was already noted that some equilibria of bodies or systems turn
out to be unstable, i.e., such that any negligible mechanical actions may lead to signiﬁcant
deviations from these states. Each of these equilibria is characterized by a certain value of
the load which separates the regions of stable and unstable equilibria.

Figure E3.30. A compressed rod: (a) stable state, (b) unstable state.
In the case of a compressed rod (Fig. E3.30), it turns out that if the compressing force F
does not exceed a certain value called the critical force Fcr, then the rectilinear form of the
rod equilibrium is stable. But if F > Fcr, then the rectilinear form of the rod equilibrium
is unstable, and the rod tends to take another stable form of equilibrium with a curvilinear
axis.
The compressing stresses σcr = Fcr/A corresponding to the critical force are called
critical stresses.
E3.7.2. Euler Formula
Thus, for F > Fcr, the solution of the problem of the rod equilibrium is not unique. An
analysis of the conditions of this ambiguity permits obtaining the formula for the value
of Fcr.
Consider a hinged centrally compressed rod in a slightly deﬂected state (Fig. E3.31).
The bending moment in the rod cross-section is equal to M = –Fv, where the deﬂection v(z)

determines the rod curvilinear axis. For small deﬂections of the rod, the curvature k of the
deﬂected axis (v/l ≪1, v′ ≪1) is equal to
k = 1
ρ =
v′′
(1 + v′2)3/2 ≈d2v
dz2 .
An analysis of the bending strain leads to formula (E3.7.2.3) in Section E3.5 relating
the curvature and the bending moment,
k = 1
ρ = M
EI ,
where the rules of signs agree well for the curvature k = 1/ρ and the moment M.
Thus, we obtain the differential equation for the rod deﬂected axis:
v′′ = –a2v,
(E3.7.2.1)
where a2 = F/(EI).
The boundary conditions take into account the fact that the rod ends are ﬁxed:
v(0) = v(l) = 0.
(E3.7.2.2)
Equation (E3.7.2.1) with boundary conditions (E3.7.2.2) has the obvious trivial solution
v = 0 corresponding to the rectilinear form of equilibrium. We are interested in nonzero
solutions.
The general integral of Eq. (E3.7.2.1) has the form
v = C1 sin(az) + C2 cos(az).
It follows from the ﬁrst boundary condition that C2 = 0, and from the second, that
C1 sin(al) = 0. Eliminating C1 ≠0, we obtain the relation
sin(al) = 0,
which is satisﬁed if al = πn or
F = π2n2EI
l2
(n = 1, 2, . . . ).
(E3.7.2.3)
Thus, it was found that if the compression force F takes discrete values determined by
formula (E3.7.2.3), then, along with the rectilinear equilibrium, the rod curved equilibria of
the sine curve form are possible;
v = C1 sin

.
From (E3.7.2.3) with n = 1, we obtain the Euler formula for the critical force
Fcr = π2EI

.
(E3.7.2.4)
A more exact theory shows that the ambiguity of the equilibrium forms occurs for all
forces F exceeding the Euler force (E3.7.2.4).

E3.7.3. Inﬂuence of Methods for Fixation of the Rod Ends on the
Value of the Critical Force
Similar problems for other cases of rod ends ﬁxation (Fig. E3.32) can also be considered.
Their solution shows that the critical force can be determined by the formula similar
to (E3.7.2.4):
Fcr = π2EI
(µl)2 ,
(E3.7.3.1)
introducing the notions of reduced length µl and of reduced length coefﬁcient µ.
The quantity µl can be treated as the rod length part on which the half-wave of the sine
curve corresponding to the rod curved axis can be placed. The values of the coefﬁcient µ
in several cases of the rod ﬁxation are given in Fig. E3.32.

Example. Find the critical force for a steel rod of length l = 4 m (Fig. E3.32) one of whose ends is rigidly
ﬁxed. The rod cross-section is the double tee No. 22.
Solution. In the range of rolled steel products, we ﬁnd the moments of inertia Ix = 2550 cm4, Iy = 157 cm4
for this double tee. Obviously, the rod becomes unstable in plane of minimum rigidity, and therefore, we must
take the minimum moment of inertia Imin = Iy = 157 cm4.
For the given ﬁxation coefﬁcient µ = 2, the modulus of elasticity for steel is E = 210 GPa. By the Euler
formula (E3.7.3.1), we obtain Fcr = π2EImin
(µl)2
= 50.8 kN.
E3.7.4. Scope of the Euler Formula
The critical stresses corresponding to the critical force (E3.7.3.1) are equal to
σcr = Fcr
A =
π2E
(µl/i)2 ,
where i =
p
I/A is the radius of inertia of the cross-section.
We introduce the notation λ = µl/i. Then the preceding formula takes the form
σcr = π2E
λ2 .
(E3.7.4.1)
The quantity λ is called the rod ﬂexibility.
It follows from (E3.7.4.1) that as the ﬂexibility decreases, the value of σcr increases
unboundedly. It is clear that formula (E3.7.4.1) cannot be used for stresses that are too
large, because the rod material under these conditions does not obey Hooke’s law.

The value of the maximum stress at which Hooke’s law is still satisﬁed is called the
proportionality limit σprop.
Thus, the range of applicability for the Euler formula is determined by the inequality
σcr < σprop or π2E/λ2 < σprop.
As a result, we obtain λ > λ0 = π
p
E/σprop.
The
dependence of σcr on λ for λ < λ0 is usually determined experimentally. In Fig. E3.33, the
solid line schematically shows the complete graph of the dependence σcr(λ). For very small
ﬂexibilities, the rod loses strength under compression, and therefore, the critical stresses
are practically equal to the corresponding strength loss stresses.
E3.7.5. Stability Analysis of Compressed Rods
In practice, it is necessary to ensure the stable operation of compressed rods, and therefore,
the stresses in the rod cannot exceed the critical stresses with a certain margin:
σ = F
A ≤σcr
n ,
(E3.7.5.1)
where n is the safety factor.
For convenience, the coefﬁcient of longitudinal bending ϕ = σcr/(n[σ]) is introduced.
Then condition (E3.7.5.1) takes the form
F
A ≤[σ]ϕ.
(E3.7.5.2)
The dependencies ϕ(λ) for different materials are given in reference books in the form
of tables.
Using condition (E3.7.5.2), one can solve the same problems as those in the strength
analysis (see Subsection E3.3.3).

Hydrodynamics∗
E4.1. Hydrostatics
E4.1.1. Properties of Incompressible Fluid at Rest. Basic Law of
Hydrostatics
◮Preliminaries. Fluids differ from solids in the absence of shape and in light mobility
of small volumes. The ability of ﬂuids to take any shape without separation into fractions
under the action of small forces is called ﬂuidity.
In their mechanical properties, the ﬂuids are separated into the two classes, liquids and
gases.
Liquids are ﬂuids that can form a free surface, namely, a surface of contact (interface)
betweenthe liquidandthe surrounding gas (another liquid). Fluids have low compressibility.
This class of liquids comprises water, gasoline, oil, petroleum, mercury, etc.
Gases are ﬂuids occupying the entire possible volume. Gases are easily compressed and
expanded under the action of applied forces.
◮Properties of an incompressible liquids at rest.
1. Pascal’s law: pressure applied to a liquid is transferred to any point of the liquid equally
in all directions (the hydrostatic pressure on a small plane site is independent of its
orientation in space).
Corollary: for a vessel of an arbitrary shape and any dimensions, the liquid pressure is
the same at the same depth.
Remark. Pascal’s law also holds for gases.
2. The interface between two immiscible liquids (or a liquid and a gas) is a horizontal
plane.
3. The law of communicating vessels: the level of a homogeneous liquid in communicating
vessels is the same.
Example 1. A hydraulic press consists of two cylindrical communicating vessels of different diameters
equipped with pistons whose areas are S1 and S2. The cylinders are ﬁlled with liquid oil. The unloaded pistons
are at the same level. A force F1 acting on the piston with area S1 creates the additional pressure p = F1/S1 in
the liquid. According to Pascal’s law, this pressure is transferred by the liquid in all directions without change.
Therefore, the pressure force F2 = pS2 = F1S2/S1 acts on the second piston. From this relation, we obtain
F2
F1 = S2
S1 .
(E4.1.1.1)
Hence the forces acting on the hydraulic press pistons are proportional to the areas of these pistons. Therefore,
using a hydraulic press, one can win much in the force by choosing S2 ≫S1.
* In this chapter, we consider several problems of hydrodynamics which are often encountered in chemical
technology.

HYDRODYNAMICS
Remark. Deriving formula (E4.1.1.1), we neglected the term ρgh determining the pressure in the liquid
due to the gravity force (see below).
◮Basic law of hydrostatics. Consider the equilibrium of an incompressible homoge-
neous liquid in the ﬁeld of gravity force. We introduce a rectangular Cartesian coordinate
system whose Z-axis is directed vertically upwards (the gravity force is directed vertically
downwards). Basic law of hydrostatics: the pressure distribution in a given volume of liquid
is determined by the formula
p = p0 – ρg(z – z0),
(E4.1.1.2)
where p0 is the pressure for z = z0, ρ is the liquid density, and g is the free fall acceleration.
Example 2. Assume that the coordinate z0 corresponds to the free surface of the liquid. Then for the
liquid pressure at the depth h = z0 – z, we have p = p0 + ρgh, where p0 is the atmospheric pressure (the gas
pressure) on the free surface.
◮Rotation of a liquid in a cylindrical vessel. Consider a liquid in a cylindrical vessel
rotating about the vertical axis at a constant angular velocity ω. We introduce a rectangular
Cartesian coordinate system whose Z-axis is directed along the axis of rotation.
The pressure distribution in the liquid is determined by the formula
p = p0 + 1
2 ρω2r2 – ρg(z – z0),
(E4.1.1.3)
where r =
p
x2 + y2 is the radial distance to the cylinder axis. For ω = 0, formula (E4.1.1.3)
becomes (E4.1.1.2).
Assume that the coordinate z0 corresponds to the free surface of the liquid on the axis
of rotation. The surface of the liquid becomes a paraboloid of rotation and is described by
the equation
1
2 ω2r2 = g(z – z0),
(E4.1.1.4)
which is obtained by substituting the pressure p = p0 into (E4.1.1.3). In (E4.1.1.4), we set
r = R, where R is the radius of the rotating vessel, and obtain the paraboloid height
H = ω2R2
2g
,
where H = zR – z0.
E4.1.2. Force of Pressure on a Plane and on a Curved Wall
◮Force of pressure on a plane wall. Consider the wetted part of a plane wall of area S
immersed in a quiescent liquid at an angle α with the horizon. The resultant pressure
force P exerted by the liquid on this wall is directed along the normal to its surface and is
numerically equal to
P = pcS.
(E4.1.2.1)
Here pc is the excess pressure at the center of gravity of the wetted part of the wall, which
is calculated by the formula
pc = p0 – pa + ρgh◦
c,
(E4.1.2.2)
where p0 is the pressure on the free surface of the liquid, pa is the external pressure (for
example, the atmospheric pressure) on the outer dry side of the wall, and h◦
c is depth of
immersion of the wall center of gravity with respect to the free surface.

Formula (E4.1.2.2) is often written as pc = ρg(H + h◦
c), where H = p0 – pa
ρg
is the
piezometric head. The surface z = H is called the piezometric plane. The sign of the
difference (p0 – pa) determines the sign of H.
The vertical coordinate of the point of pressure force application to the wetted part of
the plane wall of area S is determined by the formula
hp = hc + Ic
hcS sin2 α,
(E4.1.2.3)
where hp and hc are the vertical distances from the center of pressure and the center of
gravity to the piezometric plane, α is the angle of inclination of the wall to the horizon, and
Ic is the moment of inertia of the wall area about the horizontal axis passing through the
wall center of gravity. In the case of a horizontal wall (for α = 0), the center of gravity and
center of pressure of the wall coincide.
Table E4.1 presents formulas for calculation of the moment of inertia of several plane
ﬁgures about the axis passing through the center of gravity.
For hc > 0, the piezometric plane lies above the center of gravity of the wetted surface,
and the center of pressure lies below the center of gravity. For hc < 0, the piezometric plane
lies below the center of gravity of the wetted surface, and the center of pressure may be
above the center of gravity (if hp < 0). For hc = 0, the piezometric plane passes through the
center of gravity of the wetted surface, and the pressure forces are reduced to a couple of
forces.
◮Force of pressure on a curved wall. In the general case of an arbitrary curvilinear
surface, the distributed load of the liquid pressure normal at each point of the surface can
be reduced to the resultant vector and the principal moment.

776
HYDRODYNAMICS
For curvilinear walls symmetric with respect to the vertical plane (the most common
situation in applications), the sum of elementary pressure forces can be reduced to a single
resultant force lying in the plane of symmetry or to a couple of forces lying in the same plane.
The value and the direction of the resultant force P are determined by two components,
usually, horizontal and vertical.
The horizontal component of the pressure force on the curvilinear wall is equal to the
pressure force on the projection of this wall onto the vertical plane of symmetry and is
determined by the formula
P1 = ρghcS1,
(E4.1.2.4)
where hc is the depth of immersion of the center of gravity of the above-mentioned wall
projection counted from the piezometric plane and S1 is the area of the wall projection onto
the vertical plane. The line of action of the force horizontal component P1 passes through
the center of pressure of the wall projection onto the vertical plane, lies in the plane of
symmetry, and is displaced (downwards if hc > 0 or upwards if hc < 0) with respect to the
center of gravity of this projection of the wall by the distance
∆h =
Ic
hcS1
,
where Ic is the moment of inertia of the above-mentioned projection area of the wall about
the horizontal axis passing through the center of gravity of this projection.
The vertical component of the force of pressure on the curvilinear wall is equal to the
weight of liquid in the volume V bounded by the wall, the piezometric plane, and the
vertical projected surface constructed on the wall contour; it is determined by the formula
P2 = ρgV .
(E4.1.2.5)
The vertical component of the pressure force passes through the center of gravity of the
volume V (this volume is often called the volume of the body of pressure).
In formulas (E4.1.2.4) and (E4.1.2.5), it is assumed that the liquid is on one side of the
wall and the pressure is constant (for example, equal to the atmospheric pressure) on the
other (dry) side of the wall. The total pressure force on the wall is the geometric sum of the
forces P1 and P2, and its absolute value is equal to
P =
q
P 2
1 + P 2
2 .
The line of action of the total pressure force P passes through the point of intersection of
the lines of action of the force components P1 and P2. The angle ϕ of inclination of the
resultant force to the horizon is determined by the formula
tan ϕ = P2
P1
.
In the case of walls of constant curvature (cylindrical and spherical walls), the total
pressure force passes trough the wall center of curvature.
In the case of liquid excess pressures on the side of the wetted side of the wall, all
components and the total force are directed from the liquid to the wall (outside from the
inside).
In the case of two-sided action of liquids on the wall, one ﬁrst determines the horizontal
and vertical components on each side of the wall under the assumption of one-sided action

E4.1. HYDROSTATICS
777
of the liquid, and then the total horizontal and vertical components of action of both liquids
are determined.
If the curvilinear surface under study is intersected by the vertical axis at more than
one point, it is necessary to divide this surface into simple parts (a simple part of a surface
is its part intersected by the vertical axis only at a single point) and calculate the vertical
component for each of the parts.
Then the obtained vertical components are summed
algebraically. The same process is used if the surface under study is intersected by the
horizontal axis at more than one point.
E4.1.3. Archimedes Principle. Stability of Floating Bodies
◮Archimedes principle. The body (completely or partly) immersed in a liquid is under
the action of the buoyancy force FA numerically equal to the weight of the liquid in the
volume displaced by the body (Archimedes principle). Thus, we have
FA = ρgVb,
where Vb is the volume of the liquid displaced by the body. The force FA passes through
the center of gravity of the volume displaced by the body, which is called the center of
buoyancy.
◮Stability of ﬂoating bodies. If a ﬂoating body is in equilibrium, then its center of
gravity and the center of buoyancy lie on the common vertical line called the axis of
buoyancy (for a body symmetric with respect to a plane, the axis of buoyancy lies in this
plane). For a ﬂoating body completely immersed in a liquid (underwater ﬂoating) to be
in stable equilibrium, it is necessary that the body center of gravity be below the center of
buoyancy.
If a body is ﬂoating on the surface of a liquid (surface ﬂoating), then stable equilibrium is
possible in several cases where the body center of gravity lies above the center of buoyancy.
For a body to be in stable equilibrium in the case of surface ﬂoating, it is necessary that,
when heeled (the body axis of buoyancy is inclined by an angle θ, see Fig. E4.1), the body
metacenter M (i.e., the point of intersection of the line of the Archimedes force action with
the axis of buoyancy) lie above the center of gravity C. In Fig. E4.1, point B′ is the center
of buoyancy when the body is heeled, and point B corresponds to the original position of
the center of buoyancy on the axis of buoyancy in equilibrium.
Figure E4.1. Stability of ﬂoating bodies. The center of gravity C lies above the center of buoyancy B.

778
HYDRODYNAMICS
The distance H between points M and C is called the metacentric height. For small
angles of heeling, the metacentric height is determined by the formula
H = I
V – d
(θ ≪1),
where I is the moment of inertia of the ﬂoating section AD about the axis of suspension
OO′ (see Fig. E4.1), V is the body volume immersed in the liquid, and d is the excess of
the center of gravity over the center of buoyancy in equilibrium. For a ﬂoating body to be
in stable equilibrium, it is necessary that the following condition be satisﬁed:
H = I
V – d > 0.
(E4.1.3.1)
The stability of a ﬂoating body must be veriﬁed for the axis about which the moment of
inertia of the ﬂoatation section is minimal.
Example. A wooden bar of square cross-section a × a and height h and of density ρb is ﬂoating in a liquid
of density ρl (ρl > ρb). Find the maximum value of the bar height hmax for which the ﬂoating is still stable.
To solve this problem, we use formula (E4.1.3.1) and substitute the minimum value of the metacentric
height into this formula:
I
V – d = 0.
(E4.1.3.2)
The bar immersion depth x is determined by the Archimedes principle: the body weight must be equal to the
weight of the liquid displaced by the body, ρbga2h = ρfga2x. We have
x = ρb
ρf h.
Now we calculate the quantities occurring on the left-hand side of (E4.1.3.2):
I = 1

V = a2x = ρb
ρf a2h,
d = h

.
(To ﬁnd the moment of inertia I, we used the data for the rectangle given in Table E4.1 for a = b.) Substituting
the values thus obtained into formula (E4.1.3.2), we have

E4.2. Hydrodynamic Equations and Boundary

In this section, we present equations and boundary conditions used in solving hydrodynamic
problems.
Their detailed derivation, as well as an analysis of scope, various physical
statements and solutions of related problems, and applied issues can be found, e.g., in the
books presented in the literature at the end of this chapter. We consider incompressible
ﬂuids with constant density ρ and dynamic viscosity µ.

E4.2.1. Laminar Flows. Navier–Stokes Equations. Euler Equations
◮Preliminaries. Experiments show that two qualitatively different forms of ﬂuid motion
are possible. In particular, at small velocities of the ﬂow in a circular tube, the ﬂuid moves
in straight lines parallel to one another and to the tube axis. Such a “smooth" ﬂow without
mixing is said to be laminar. In the general case of laminar steady-state ﬂow, the ﬂuid
elements move along stream lines (a stream line is a line such that the tangent at each of
its points coincides with the direction of the ﬂuid particle velocity at this point). For large
velocities of motion, an intensive mixing of the ﬂuid is observed in the tube, and this mixing
is characterized by unsteady chaotic motion of the ﬂuid elements in the transverse direction
(there appear velocity components perpendicular to the tube axis). Such a ﬂow regime is
said to be turbulent.
In Subsection E4.2.1, equations for laminar ﬂows of ﬂuids are considered, and in
Subsection E4.2.3, equations for turbulent ﬂows.
For brevity, in what follows, we often refer to “laminar ﬂows” simply as “ﬂows.”

Equations (E4.2.1.1) and (E4.2.1.2) are written in an orthogonal Cartesian system X, Y , Z

density components; ν = µ/ρ is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid. The three components

HYDRODYNAMICS
The continuity and Navier–Stokes equations in the cylindrical and spherical coordi-

Section S3.2.
◮Dimensionless form of equations. To analyze the hydrodynamic equations (E4.2.1.3)
and (E4.2.1.4), it is convenient to introduce dimensionless variables and unknown functions
as follows:
τ = Ut

x = X

In Eq. (E4.2.1.6), the following basic dimensionless state-geometric parameters of the ﬂow
are used:
Re = aU
ν
is the Reynolds number,
Fr = U2
ga is the Froude number.
Small values of Reynolds numbers correspond to slow (“creeping”) ﬂows and high
Reynolds numbers, to rapid ﬂows. Since these limit cases contain a small or large di-
mensionless parameter, one can efﬁciently use various modiﬁcations of the perturbation
method.
◮Euler equations for an ideal incompressible ﬂuid. In the special case VX = VY = VZ =
0, the Navier–Stokes equations (E4.2.1.2) become the equilibrium equations of a quiescent
incompressible ﬂuid, which are independent of the ﬂuid viscosity. From the equilibrium
equations of a quiescent incompressible ﬂuid, one can derive the laws of hydrostatics
described in Section E4.1.

which, together with the continuity equation (E4.2.1.1), describe the ﬂows of ideal (inviscid)
incompressible ﬂuid.
We assume that the ﬂow is stationary and of the mass forces only the gravity force is
acting, which is characterized by the values gX = gY = 0, gZ = –g (the coordinate Z is
counted off from the Earth’s surface, and g is the free fall acceleration). In this case, the
Euler equations admit the Bernoulli integral; namely, the following conservation law is
satisﬁed on any stream line:
V 2
2 + P
ρ + gZ = const,
(E4.2.1.8)
where V =

V 2
X + V 2
Y + V 2
Z is the modulus of the ﬂuid velocity. In the general case, the
Bernoulli integral constant on the right-hand side in (E4.2.1.8) is different for different
stream lines.

E4.2. HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
781
Example. Assume that there is a small hole in the wall of a wide vessel at a depth h. Find the velocity of
the liquid ﬂow through the hole.
Consider the stream line issuing from the liquid free surface in the vessel and passing through the hole.
For this stream line, we write the Bernoulli integral (E4.2.1.8) in the form
V 2
1
2 + P1
ρ + g1Z = V 2
2
2 + P2
ρ + gZ2,
(E4.2.1.9)
where subscript 1 denotes the quantities on the liquid surface and the subscript 2 denotes the quantities on the
hole output. The coordinate Z is counted off from the hole. Substituting the values V1 ≈0, P1 = P2 = Pa,
Z1 = h, Z2 = 0 into (E4.2.1.9), we obtain the velocity of the liquid ﬂow from the hole:
V0 =
p
2gh.
This formula is called the Torricelli formula.
The motion of an ideal ﬂuid is said to be potential if the ﬂuid velocity vector admits the
representation
V = grad ϕ,
(E4.2.1.10)
where the function ϕ is called the potential. Because of the continuity equation (E4.2.1.1),
the potential satisﬁes the Laplace equation
∆ϕ = 0,
and the pressure is determined by the Cauchy–Lagrange integral
∂ϕ
∂t + V 2
2 + P
ρ + gZ = f(t).
(E4.2.1.11)
where f(t) is an arbitrary function. When writing this integral, it was assumed that of the
mass forces only the gravity force is acting. Relation (E4.2.1.11) is satisﬁed at all points of
the region of potential ﬂow of an ideal ﬂuid; to ﬁnd the function f(t), it sufﬁces to know
the left-hand side of the integral as a function of time at any point of the ﬂow.
In the special case of a steady-state potential motion of a ﬂuid, the Cauchy–Lagrange
integral (E4.2.1.11) coincides with the Bernoulli integral (E4.2.1.8), where the constant on
the right-hand side is the same for all stream lines.
Note that the Euler equations (E4.2.1.7) have a very restricted domain of application
(especially in problems of chemical technology).
E4.2.2. Initial Conditions and the Simplest Boundary Conditions
For the solution of system (E4.2.1.1), (E4.2.1.2) to determine the velocity and pressure
ﬁelds uniquely, we must impose initial and boundary conditions.
◮Initial conditions. In nonstationary problems, where the terms with partial derivatives
with respect to time are retained in the equations of motion, the initial velocity ﬁeld must
be given in the entire ﬂow region and satisfy the continuity equation (E4.2.1.1) there. The
initial pressure ﬁeld need not be given, since the equations do not contain the derivative of
pressure with respect to time.
◮Boundary conditions on the surface of a solid body. As a rule, the region occupied
by a moving ﬂuid is not the entire space but only part of it bounded by some surfaces.
According to whether the point at inﬁnity belongs to the ﬂow region or not, the problem of
ﬁnding the unknown functions is called the exterior or interior problem of hydrodynamics,
respectively.

782
HYDRODYNAMICS
On the surface S of a solid body moving in a ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid, the no-slip condition
is imposed. This condition says that the vector V|S of the ﬂuid velocity on the surface of
the solid is equal to the vector V0 of the solid velocity. If the solid is at rest, then V|S = 0.
In the projections on the normal n and the tangent τ to the surface S, this condition reads
Vn

S = 0,
Vτ

S = 0.
More complicated boundary conditions are posed on an interface between two ﬂuids
(for example, see boundary conditions (E4.7.1.1)–(E4.7.1.4)).
◮Boundary condition far from the body for the translational ﬂow.
To solve the
exterior hydrodynamic problem, one must impose a condition at inﬁnity (that is, far from
the body, the drop, or the bubble).
For uniform translational ﬂow with velocity Ui around a ﬁnite body, the boundary
condition far from the body has the form
V →Ui
as
R →∞,
(E4.2.2.1)
where R =
√
X2 + Y 2 + Z2.
◮Shear ﬂows. An arbitrary stationary velocity ﬁeld V(R) in an incompressible medium
can be approximated near the point R = 0 by two terms of the Taylor series:
Vk(R) = Vk(0) + GkmXm,
Gkm ≡(∂Vk/∂Xm)R=0,
G11 + G22 + G33 = 0.
(E4.2.2.2)
Here Vk and Gkm are the ﬂuid velocity and the shear tensor components in the Cartesian
coordinates X1, X2, X3. The sum is taken over the repeated index m; since the ﬂuid is
incompressible, it follows that the sum of the diagonal entries Gmm is zero.
For viscous ﬂows around particles whose size is much less than the characteristic size of
ﬂow inhomogeneities, the velocity distribution (1.1.15) can be viewed as the velocity ﬁeld
far from the particle. The special case Gkm = 0 corresponds to a uniform translational ﬂow.
For Vk(0) = 0, Eq. (E4.2.2.2) describes the velocity ﬁeld in an arbitrary linear shear ﬂow.
Example (Simple shear ﬂow).
For the simple shear (Couette) ﬂow, we have
VX = GY ,
VY = 0,
VZ = 0.
(E4.2.2.3)
In this case, G is called the gradient of the ﬂow rate or the shear rate. The Couette ﬂow occurs between two
planes one of which is immovable and the other moves at a constant velocity parallel to the ﬁrst plane.
The expressions (E4.2.2.3) give the exact solution of the Navier–Stokes equations (E4.2.1.1)–(E4.2.1.2) in
the case of potential mass forces.
E4.2.3. Turbulent Flows. Reynolds Equations
◮Reynolds equations. Formally, stationary solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations are
possible for any Reynolds numbers. But practically, only stable ﬂows with respect to small
perturbations, always present in the ﬂow, can exist. For sufﬁciently high Reynolds numbers,
the stationary solutions become unstable; i.e., the amplitude of small perturbations increases
with time. For this reason, stationary solutions can only describe real ﬂows at not too high
Reynolds numbers.
The ﬂow in the boundary layer on a ﬂat plate is laminar up to ReX = UiX/ν ≈3.5× 105
(Ui is the unperturbed ﬂuid velocity far from the plate, and the coordinate X is counted
along the plate from the front edge), and that in a circular smooth tube is laminar for
Re = a〈V 〉/ν < 1500 (a is the radius of a tube, and 〈V 〉is the mean ﬂow rate velocity).

E4.2. HYDRODYNAMIC EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
783
For higher Reynolds numbers, the laminar ﬂow loses its stability and a transient regime of
development of unstable modes takes place. For ReX >107 andRe>2500, a fullydeveloped
regime of turbulent ﬂow is established, which is characterized by chaotic variations in the
basic macroscopic ﬂow parameters in time and space.
When mathematically describing a fully developed turbulent motion of ﬂuid, it is com-
mon to represent the velocity components and pressure in the form
Vi = Vi + V ′
i ,
P = P + P ′,
(E4.2.3.1)
where the bar and prime denote the time-average and ﬂuctuating components, respectively.
The averages of the ﬂuctuations are zero, V ′
i = P ′ = 0.
The representation (E4.2.3.1) of the hydrodynamic parameters of turbulent ﬂow as
the sum of the average and ﬂuctuating components followed by the averaging process
made it possible, on the basis of the continuity equation (E4.2.1.3) and the Navier–Stokes
equations (E4.2.1.4), to obtain (under some assumptions) the Reynolds equations
∇⋅V = 0,
∂V
∂t + (V ⋅∇)V = – 1
ρ ∇P + ν∆V + g + 1
ρ ∇⋅σt
(E4.2.3.2)
for the averaged pressure and velocity ﬁelds. These equation contain the Reynolds turbulent
shear stress tensor σt, whose components are deﬁned as
σt
ij = –ρV ′
i V ′
j .
(E4.2.3.3)
The variable ρV ′
i V ′
j is the average rate at which the turbulent ﬂuctuations transfer the jth
momentum component along the ith axis.
◮The closure problem. Turbulent viscosity. Unlike the Navier–Stokes equations com-
pleted by the continuity equation, the Reynolds equations form an unclosed system of
equations, since these contain the a priori unknown turbulent stress tensor σt with compo-
nents (E4.2.3.3). Additional hypotheses must be invoked in order to close system (E4.2.3.2).
So far the closure problem for the system of Reynolds equations has not been solved
theoretically in a conclusive way. In engineering calculations, various assumptions that the
Reynolds stresses depend on the average turbulent ﬂow parameters are often adopted as
closure conditions. These conditions are usually formulated on the basis of experimental
data, dimensional considerations, analogies with molecular rheological models, etc.
One traditional approach to the closure of the Reynolds equations is outlined below.
This approach is based on Boussinesq’s model of turbulent viscosity completed by Prandtl’s
hypothesis. For simplicity, we conﬁne our consideration to the case of simple shear ﬂow,
where the transverse coordinate Y = X2 is measured from the wall (the results are also
applicable to turbulent boundary layers).
According to Boussinesq’s model, the only
nonzero component of the Reynolds turbulent shear stress tensor and the divergence of this
tensor are deﬁned as

Formulas (E4.2.3.4)
contain the turbulent (eddy) viscosity νt, which is not a physical constant but is a function

of geometric and kinematic ﬂow parameters. It is necessary to specify this function to close
the Reynolds equations.
Following Prandtl, we have

(E4.2.3.5)
where κ = 0.4 is the von K´arm´an empirical constant (in the literature, this constant is
most frequently taken to be κ = 0.40 or 0.41, although other values can sometimes be
encountered).
There are a number of other methods for closing the Reynolds equations, also based on
the notion of turbulent viscosity. These methods, as well as other models and methods of
turbulence theory, can be found in the literature listed at the end of this chapter.
E4.3. Hydrodynamics of Thin Films
E4.3.1. Preliminary Remarks. Different Regimes of Film Type Flow
Film type ﬂows are widely used in chemical technology (in contact devices of absorption,
chemosorption, and rectiﬁcation columns as well as evaporators, dryers, heat exchangers,
ﬁlm chemical reactors, extractors, and condensers).
As a rule, the liquid and the gas phase are simultaneously fed into an apparatus where
the ﬂuids undergo physical and chemical treatment. Therefore, generally speaking, there is
a dynamic interaction between the phases until the ﬂooding mode sets in the countercurrent
ﬂows of gas and liquid. However, for small values of gas ﬂow rate one can neglect the
dynamic interaction and assume that the liquid ﬂow in a ﬁlm is due to the gravity force
alone.
The value of the Reynolds number Re = Q/ν, where Q is the volume ﬂow rate per
unit ﬁlm width, determines whether the ﬂow in the gravitational ﬁlm is laminar, wave,
or turbulent.
It is well known that laminar ﬂow becomes unstable at the critical value
Re∗= 2 to 6. However, the point starting from which the waves actually occur is noticeably
shifted downstream. Even in the range 6 ≤Re ≤400, corresponding to wave ﬂows, a
considerable part of the ﬁlm remains wave-free. Since this part is much larger than the
initial part where the velocity proﬁle and the ﬁlm width reach their steady-state values, we
see that for ﬁlms in which viscous and gravity forces are in balance, the hydrodynamic
laws of steady-state laminar ﬂow virtually determine the rate of mass exchange in various
apparatuses, like packed absorbing and fractionating columns, widely used in chemical and
petroleum industry. In these columns, the ﬁlms ﬂow over the packing surface whose linear
dimensions do not exceed a few centimeters (Raschig rings, Palle rings, Birle seats, etc.).
Paradoxically, the range of ﬂow rates (or Reynolds numbers) for which the assumption
of laminar ﬂow can be used in practice is bounded below (rather than above). Indeed, there
is a threshold value Qmin of the volume ﬂow rate per unit ﬁlm width such that for Q < Qmin
the ﬂow in separate jets is energetically favorable. It was theoretically established that
Qmin = 2.15

where σgw and σfw are the speciﬁc excess surface energies for the gas–wall and liquid–wall
interfaces.
Recently, the criterion of nonbreaking ﬁlm ﬂow was thermodynamically substantiated
with the aid of Prigogine’s principle of minimum entropy production, including the case of
a double ﬁlm ﬂow.
In practice, Qmin can be reduced by wall hydrophilization—that is, by treating the
surface with alcohol, which decreases the wetting angle.
E4.3.2. Films on an Inclined Plane and on a Cylindrical Surface
◮Film ﬂowing by gravity on an inclined plane. Consider a thin liquid ﬁlm ﬂowing by
gravity on a solid plane surface (Figure E4.3). Let α be the angle of inclination. We assume
that the motion is sufﬁciently slow, so that we can neglect inertial forces (that is, convective
terms) compared with the viscous friction and the gravity force. Let the ﬁlm thickness h
(which is assumed to be constant) be much less than the ﬁlm length. In this case, in the
ﬁrst approximation, the normal component of the liquid velocity is small compared with the
longitudinal component, and we can neglect the derivatives along the ﬁlm surface compared
with the normal derivatives.
Figure E4.3. Steady waveless laminar ﬂow in thin ﬁlm on an inclined plane.
These assumptions result in the one-dimensional velocity and pressure proﬁles V =V (Y )
and P = P(Y ), where Y is the coordinate measured along the normal to the ﬁlm surface.
The corresponding hydrodynamic equations of thin ﬁlms expressing the balance of viscous

E4.4.1. Laminar Flows in Tubes of Various Cross-Sections
Laminar steady-state ﬂuid ﬂows in tubes are often encountered in practice (water-, gas- and
oil pipelines, heat exchangers, etc.). It is worth noting that in these cases the corresponding
hydrodynamic equations admit an exact closed-form solution. In what follows, we describe
the most important results in that direction.

E4.4. FLUID FLOWS IN TUBES
787
◮Statement of the problem. Consider a laminar steady-state ﬂuid ﬂow in a rectilinear
tube of constant cross-section. The ﬂuid streamlines in such systems are strictly parallel
(we neglect the inﬂuence of the tube endpoints on the ﬂow). We shall use the Cartesian
coordinates X, Y , Z with the Z-axis directed along the ﬂow. Let us take into account the fact
that the transverse velocity components of the ﬂuid are zero and the longitudinal component
depends only on the transverse coordinates. In this case, the continuity equation (E4.2.1.1)
and the ﬁrst two Navier–Stokes equations in (E4.2.1.2) are satisﬁed automatically, and it
follows from the third equation in (E4.2.1.2) that

Equation (E4.4.1.1) must be supplemented by the no-slip condition

(E4.4.1.2)
The pressure gradient dP/dZ in the steady state is constant along the tube and can be
represented in the form
dP
dZ = – ∆P

(E4.4.1.3)
where ∆P > 0 is the total pressure drop along a tube part of length L.

(E4.4.1.4)
and the mean ﬂow rate velocity
〈V 〉= Q

(E4.4.1.5)
where S∗is the area of the tube cross-section.
◮Plane channel.
First, consider the ﬂow between two inﬁnite parallel planes at a
distance 2h from each other. The coordinate X is measured from one of the planes along
the normal. Since the ﬂuid velocity is independent of the coordinate Y , we can rewrite
(E4.4.1.1) in the form
d2V
dX2 = – ∆P

The solution of this equation under the no-slip boundary conditions on the planes (V = 0
for X = 0 and X = 2h) has the form
V = ∆P

(E4.4.1.6)
Formula (E4.4.1.6) describes the parabolic velocityﬁeldin a plane Poiseuille ﬂow symmetric
with respect to the midplane X = h of the channel.
The volume ﬂow rate per unit width of the channel can be found by integrating (E4.4.1.6)
over the cross-section:

an annular channel between two coaxial circular cylinders of radii a1 and a2 (a1 < a2). In

◮Tube of rectangular cross-section. Now consider a tube of rectangular cross-section
with sides a and b. We assume that the ﬂow region is described by the inequalities 0 ≤X ≤a

It is useful to rewrite the last expression as
Q
Q0

where Q0 is the volume ﬂow rate for a circular tube with the same cross-section area. The
volume ﬂow rate for a square tube is smaller, because the cross-section has corners near
which the velocity of a viscous ﬂuid decreases noticeably.
◮Tube of triangular cross-section. Now suppose that the cross-section of the tube is an
equilateral triangle with side b. We place the origin at the center of the cross-section and
measure the coordinate X along one of the sides of the triangle. In this case, the solution
of Eq. (E4.4.1.1) under the boundary condition (E4.4.1.2) has the form

It is useful to compare Q with the volume ﬂow rate for a circular tube of the same cross-
section area:
Q
Q0
= 0.726.
This expression shows that the volume ﬂow rate for a tube whose cross-section is an
equilateral triangle is substantially lower than for tubes of square or circular cross-section
of the same area.
◮Rectilinear tube of arbitrary cross-section. By using dimensional considerations, one
can obtain the following formulas for the volume ﬂow rate and the maximum velocity in a
rectilinear tube of constant cross-section of arbitrary shape:
Q = K S2
∗∆P
µL
,
Umax = Kv
S∗∆P
µL
,
(E4.4.1.24)
where S∗is the tube cross-section area and K and Kv are dimensionless coefﬁcients
depending on the shape of the cross-section. The coefﬁcients K and Kv can be obtained
either experimentally or theoretically.
The most important dimensionless geometric parameter characterizing the cross-section
shape is the ratio √S∗/P, where P is the cross-section perimeter. In calculations, it is
convenient to use the shape parameter
ξ = 2√π
√S∗
P ,
(E4.4.1.25)
which always lies in the range 0 ≤ξ ≤1. The value ξ = 1 corresponds to a circular tube. This
condition is ensured by choosing the proportionality factor 2√π in formula (E4.4.1.25).

E4.4. FLUID FLOWS IN TUBES
791
For tubes of convex cross-section that is nearly circular or at least does not deviate very
much from the circular shape, it is natural to assume that the coefﬁcients K and Kv in
(E4.4.1.24) depend only on ξ:
K = K(ξ),
Kv = Kv(ξ).
(E4.4.1.26)
Then in many cases the function K = K(ξ) (which determines the volume ﬂow rate Q in
(E4.4.1.24)) is well approximated by the linear function
K = K0ξ,
K0 = 1
8π ≈0.0398.
(E4.4.1.27)
For ξ =1, the approximate formula (E4.4.1.27) gives the exact value of K0 corresponding
to a circular tube. For example, formula (E4.4.1.27) can be used for tubes whose cross-
section is a regular N-gon (N = 4, 5, . . . ). In particular, for a tube of square cross-section,
Eq. (E4.4.1.25) gives ξ = 1
2
√π ≈0.886.
Substituting this into (E4.4.1.27), we obtain
K = 0.0353. This differs from the exact value K = 0.0351 only by 0.6% (see (E4.4.1.23a)).
For a tube of elliptic cross-section with axial ratio a/b = 1.5, the error in (E4.4.1.27) is
about 5%.
◮Hydrodynamic drag coefﬁcient. Consider the hydrodynamic drag for the laminar ﬂow
of a ﬂuid in tubes of various shape. The drag coefﬁcient λ relating the pressure drop and
the characteristic pressure head is introduced by the relation
λ =
de
1
2 ρ〈V 〉2
∆P
L ,
(E4.4.1.28)
where de is equivalent (or “hydraulic”) diameter and 〈V 〉is the mean ﬂow rate velocity.
Let us introduce the equivalent (or “hydraulic”) diameter de by the formula
de = 4S∗
P ,
where S∗is the area of the tube cross-section and P is the cross-section perimeter. For
tubes of circular cross-section, de coincides with the diameter, and for a plane channel, de
is twice the height of the channel.
Table E4.2 presents the values of the drag coefﬁcients for tubes with various shapes of
the cross-section. The Reynolds number Red = de〈V 〉/ν can be calculated from the mean
ﬂow rate velocity and the equivalent diameter.
For a tube whose cross-section is a regular N-gon, the value λ Red is given by the
approximate formula
λ Red = 64 N – 82
N – 0.95 .
(E4.4.1.29)
The comparison with Table E4.2 shows that the maximum error in (E4.4.1.29) is less
than 0.6% at N = 3, 4, 6, ∞.
E4.4.2. Turbulent Flows in Tubes
◮Tangential stress. Turbulent viscosity. A ﬂow of a ﬂuid through a smooth tube of
circular cross-section remains laminar while Re = a〈V 〉/ν < 1500, where a is the tube
radius and 〈V 〉the mean ﬂow rate velocity of the ﬂuid. For higher Reynolds numbers, the
loss of stability of the laminar ﬂow is observed and an intermediate regime occurs. For

Re > 2500, a fully developed regime of turbulent ﬂow is established, which is characterized
by a chaotic variation of the velocity and pressure in time and space.
In a turbulent ﬂow in a tube, there are two signiﬁcantly different ﬂow regions. In the
ﬁrst, entry region, the average velocity proﬁle V changes dramatically with the distance
from the entry cross-section. In the second, stabilized ﬂow region, the average velocity
proﬁle is the same at each cross-section.
The length of the entry (stabilization) region
depends on the Reynolds number and the roughness of the walls and occupies a few dozen
diameters (from 25 to 100). For rough estimates, this length is frequently taken to be 50 tube
diameters.
In the stabilized ﬂow region, the average ﬂuid velocity V is directed along the tube axis
and depends only on the distance Y from the tube wall. The integration of the Reynolds
equations (E4.2.3.2) yields the following expression for the shear stress:
τ = τs(1 – Y/a),
(E4.4.2.1)
where τs is the friction stress at the wall. Near the tube axis, as Y/a →1, it follows
from (E4.4.2.1) that τ/τs →0. Near the wall, as Y/a →0, we have τ/τs →1.
The friction stress at the wall for a circular tube is calculated by the formula τs =
1
2 a(∆P/L), where ∆P > 0 is the total pressure drop along a tube part of length L.
In accordance with Boussinesq’s model (E4.2.3.4), the shear stress can be represented
as
τ = ρ(ν + νt) ∂V
∂Y ,
(E4.4.2.2)
where ν is the kinematic viscosity and νt is the turbulent viscosity.

E4.4. FLUID FLOWS IN TUBES
793
Formulas (E4.4.2.1) and (E4.4.2.2) have formed the basis of most theoretical studies of
the average ﬂuid velocity and the drag coefﬁcient in the stabilized region of turbulent ﬂow
in a circular tube (and a plane channel of width 2a). The corresponding results obtained on
the basis of Prandtl’s relation (E4.2.3.4) and von K´arm´an’s relation for turbulent viscosity
can be found in the literature given at the end of this chapter. In what follows, major
attention will be paid to empirical and semi-empirical formulas that approximate numerous
experimental data quite well.
◮Structure of the ﬂow. Velocity proﬁle in a circular tube. Experiments show that in
the stabilized ﬂow region, two characteristic subregions can be singled out, namely,
0 ≤Y/a ≤σ
(wall region),
σ ≤Y/a ≤1
(core of turbulent ﬂow),
where Y is the transverse coordinate measured from the wall and σ = 0.1 to 0.2.
To describe the turbulent ﬂow in the wall region, one introduces the so-called friction
velocity U∗and the dimensionless internal coordinate y+ according to the formulas
U∗=
q
τs/ρ,
y+ = Y U∗/ν,
(E4.4.2.3)
where τs is the shear stress at the wall and ρ is the ﬂuid density. According to von K´arm´an,
it is convenient to single out three subdomains in the wall region:
wall region =
( viscous sublayer (νt ≪ν),
buffer layer (νt ∼ν),
logarithmic layer (νt ≫ν).
In the viscous sublayer, the turbulent viscosity tends to zero near the wall (νt is proportional
to Y 3). In the logarithmic layer, the turbulent viscosity depends on the transverse coordinate
linearly, νt = 0.4U∗Y .
The approximate ranges of the above subdomains in terms of y+ are as follows:
viscous sublayer
0 ≤y+ ≤5,
buffer layer
5 ≤y+ ≤30,
logarithmic layer
30 ≤y+.
In the viscous sublayer, the average velocity distribution is linear,
V (Y )
U∗
= y+
for
0 ≤y+ ≤5.
(E4.4.2.4)
Note that turbulent ﬂuctuations can penetrate into the viscous sublayer, although the turbu-
lent friction is small there.
The average velocity proﬁle in the thickest, logarithmic layer can be described by the
formula
V (Y )
U∗
= 2.5 ln y+ + 5
for
30 ≤y+
(E4.4.2.5)
quite well. This relation is referred to as Prandtl’s law of the wall. It is worth noting
that the factor 2.5 occurring in Eq. (E4.4.2.5) comes from 1/κ, where κ = 0.4 is the von
K´arm´an constant. The value 5 of the constant term was obtained on the basis of numerous
experimental data.

794
HYDRODYNAMICS
It should be pointed out that formulas (E4.4.2.4) and (E4.4.2.5) are not only supported
by experimental data quite well but also have certain theoretical justiﬁcation.
For the velocity distribution in the buffer layer, one can use the simple interpolation
formula
V (Y )
U∗
= y+ cos3.24 ξ + (2.5 ln y+ + 5) sin2.24 ξ,
ξ = π
2
y+
18 + y+ .
(E4.4.2.6)
This formula well agrees with the existing experimental data and deﬁnes a continuous and
smooth proﬁle of the average velocity over the entire wall domain (including the viscous
sublayer, the buffer layer, and the logarithmic layer).
Numerous experimental data provide evidence that the average velocity V in the core
of turbulent ﬂow can be approximated as
Umax – V (Y )
U∗
= 2.5 ln a
Y ,
(E4.4.2.7)
where Umax is the velocity at the ﬂow axis. Equation (E4.4.2.7) is universal and is referred
to as von K´arm´an’s velocity defect law;* it is applicable for smooth and rough tubes and any
Reynolds numbers corresponding to turbulent ﬂows. Formula (E4.4.2.7) can be somewhat
reﬁned by adding the term 0.6 (1 – Y/a)2 to the right-hand side, thus extending the formula
to the range 0.01 ≤Y/a < 1.

with experimental data within the range 3 × 103 ≤Red ≤105, where Red = d〈V 〉/ν is the
Reynolds number for a tube of diameter d = 2a.

The former is obtained from the latter by a slight change in numerical coefﬁcients, which
provides a better agreement with the experimental data in the logarithmic layer, with the
same accuracy in the other domains.
* It is remarkable that Eq. (E4.4.2.7) was ﬁrst suggested for the logarithmic layer, but it turned out that it
can well be extrapolated to almost the entire domain of turbulent core.

These formulas are also accurate within 2%. The ﬁrst line in Eq. (E4.4.2.13) follows from

◮Turbulent ﬂow in a plane channel. Qualitatively, the picture of stabilized turbulent
ﬂow in a plane channel is similar to that in a circular tube. Indeed, in the viscous sublayer

described by the expression

The drag coefﬁcient λ for turbulent

experimental data for tubes of rectangular and triangular cross-section.
More detailed information about the structure of turbulent ﬂows in a circular (or non-

E4.5. Hydrodynamic Boundary Layers on a Flat Plate
E4.5.1. Laminar Boundary Layer
◮Preliminary remarks. Flow for large Reynolds numbers. In practice, one often deals
with outside ﬂows around stationary extended equipment elements such as plates, guiding
elements, or tubes. In this case, the action of external mass forces can often be neglected,
and the hydrodynamic laws are determined by the relation between pressure, viscous, and
inertial forces. Then the system of dimensionless steady-state hydrodynamic equations
becomes
∇⋅v = 0,
(v ⋅∇)v = –∇p + 1
Re ∆v.
(E4.5.1.1)
The system contains a single parameter, the Reynolds number. The solution in the
general case is very complicated (the system is nonlinear), but it can be simpliﬁed if we
consider the passage to the limit as Re →0 or Re→∞. In this section, we solve the problem
on a longitudinal ﬂat-plate ﬂow assuming that Re →∞, that is, for a liquid with “vanishing
viscosity.” The solution is not straightforward: one cannot just disregard the term Re–1∆v,
thus obtaining the equation of an ideal ﬂuid. The mathematical difﬁculty is that the small
parameter Re–1 occurs in the term with higher derivatives. By neglecting this term, we
change the order and the type of the equation, and the solution of the original system need
not converge as Re–1 →0 to the solution of the limit system with Re–1 = 0. Here we deal
with a singular perturbation. Moreover, it is clear from physical considerations that an
ideal ﬂuid ﬂow past a body cannot satisfy the no-slip condition on the surface. Actually,
the tangential velocity varies from zero on the surface of the body to the velocity of the
undisturbed ﬂow remote from the body.
For ﬂuids with low viscosity, this change of velocity occurs in a thin ﬂuid layer adjacent
to the surface of the body. Prandtl termed this layer a boundary layer. The magnitude
of ∆v is very large in this layer. Thus, although Re–1 is a small parameter, one cannot
disregard the term Re–1∆v in the boundary layer. Nevertheless, since the longitudinal and
the transverse coordinates play different roles in the boundary layer, we can simplify the
equations. The corresponding formal estimate of terms in the second equation in (E4.5.1.1)
can be found in the books listed at the end of this chapter.

E4.5. HYDRODYNAMIC BOUNDARY LAYERS ON A FLAT PLATE
797
◮Statement of the Blasius problem. Consider the steady-state problem on the longi-
tudinal zero-pressure-gradient ﬂow (∇P ≡0) past a half-inﬁnite ﬂat plate (0 ≤X < ∞).
We assume that the coordinates X and Y are directed along the plate and transverse to the
plate, respectively, and the origin is placed at the front edge of the plate. The velocity of
the incoming ﬂow is Ui.
Let us write out the ﬁnal system of boundary layer equations for an incompressible ﬂuid

∂X + VY
∂VX
∂Y

∂Y 2 ,
∂VX

The natural boundary conditions have the form
Y = 0,
VX = VY = 0
(no-slip condition),
Y →∞,
VX →Ui
(condition far from the plate).
(E4.5.1.3)
◮Blasius solution. Friction coefﬁcient. We express the ﬂuid velocity components via
the stream function Ψ by the formulas
VX = ∂Ψ
∂Y ,
VY = – ∂Ψ
∂X
(E4.5.1.4)
and substitute them into (E4.5.1.2).
Then we seek the stream function in the form
Ψ(X, Y ) =
p
νXUi f(η),
η = Y
r
Ui
νX ,
(E4.5.1.5)
where η is a self-similar variable.
We obtain the following boundary value problem for the function f(η):
2f ′′′ + ff ′′ = 0;
η = 0,
η →∞,
f = f ′ = 0;
f ′ →1.
(E4.5.1.6)
Detailed tables containing the numerical solution of this problem can be found, for example,
in Schlichting’s book (1981).
By using (E4.5.1.4), we can calculate the ﬂuid velocity components as follows:

Formula (E4.5.1.9) is known as the Blasius law for the drag in longitudinal ﬂat-plate
ﬂow. This formula can be used in laminar ﬂow, that is, for ReL < 3.5 × 105.
Although the boundary layer in this statement of the problem is asymptotic—that is,
extends inﬁnitely along the Y -coordinate—one can approximately estimate its thickness
if we adopt the convention that the velocity on the boundary of the layer differs from the
undisturbed ﬂow velocity at most by 1%. Then the boundary layer thickness is
δ(X) ≈5
q
νX/Ui.
The Blasius solution shows that the longitudinal velocity proﬁles are afﬁnely similar to
each other for all cross-sections of the boundary layer.
◮Reversed statement of the Blasius problem. In applications, one often deals with
the “reversed” statement of the Blasius problem, in which a half-inﬁnite plate moves in its
plane at a velocity Ui. In this case, the stream function is also sought in the form (E4.5.1.5),
but the boundary value problem (E4.5.1.6) for the function f = f(η) is replaced by
2f ′′′ + ff ′′ = 0;
η = 0,
η →∞,
f = 0,

E4.5.2. Turbulent Boundary Layer
◮Structure of the ﬂow. Velocity proﬁle. The ﬂow in the boundary layer on a ﬂat plate
is laminar until ReX = UiX/ν ≈3 × 105. On a longer plate, the boundary layer becomes
turbulent; that is, its thickness increases sharply and the longitudinal velocity proﬁle alters.
In accordance with Boussinesq’s model the turbulence boundary layer on a ﬂat plate is
described by the equations

where νt is the turbulent viscosity.
These equations have formed the basis of most theoretical investigations on the deter-
mination of the average ﬂuid velocity and the drag coefﬁcient in the stabilized region of
turbulent ﬂow on a ﬂat plate. In what follows, major attention will be paid to empirical and
semiempirical formulas that approximate numerous experimental data quite well.

E4.5. HYDRODYNAMIC BOUNDARY LAYERS ON A FLAT PLATE
799
Experiments show that the turbulent boundary layer on a ﬂat plate includes two qualita-
tively different regions, namely, the wall region (adjacent to the plate surface) and the outer
region (bordering the unperturbed stream). By analogy with the ﬂow through a circular
tube, it is common to subdivide the thin wall region into three subdomains (von K´arm´an’s
scheme):
wall region
=
viscous sublayer
+
buffer layer
+
logarithmic layer
The friction velocity U∗and the dimensionless internal coordinate y+ deﬁned by rela-
tions (E4.4.2.3) are introduced to describe the turbulent ﬂow of the ﬂuid in the wall region.
The transverse coordinate Y in Eq. (E4.4.2.3) is measured from the plate surface.
The velocity proﬁle in the viscous sublayer is linear, V X(Y )/U∗= y+.
In the logarithmic layer and the outer region, the average velocity proﬁle is quite well
described by the relations (Monin & Yaglom, 1992)
Ui – V X(Y )
U∗
=
 –2.5 ln(Y/δ) + 2.2
for Y/δ ≤0.15,
9.6 [1 – (Y/δ)]2
for 0.15 ≤Y/δ ≤1,
where δ = δ(X) is the boundary layer thickness.
Note the Spalding implicit interpolation formula

where y+ = Y U∗/ν and V + = 0.4 V (Y )/U∗. This formula quite well describes the average
velocity proﬁle within the entire wall region 0 ≤Y/δ ≤0.15.

The comparison of Eq. (E4.5.2.4) with Eq. (E4.5.1.10) reveals that the resistance of a ﬂat
plate to turbulent ﬂow is much greater than to laminar ﬂow and decreases with increasing
Reynolds number considerably slower.

E4.6. Spherical Particles and Circular Cylinders in
Translational Flow
◮Preliminary remarks. Solving the problem on the interaction of a solid particle, drop,
or bubble with the surrounding continuous phase underlies the design and analysis of many
technological processes. The industrial applications of such interaction include classiﬁ-
cation of suspensions in hydrocyclones, sedimentation of colloids, pneumatic conveyers,
ﬂuidization, heterogeneous catalysis in suspension, dissolving solid particles, extraction
from drops, absorption, and evaporation into bubbles.
The description of a large variety of meteorological phenomena is also based on the
analysis of motion of a collection of drops in air. The recent increase in atmosphere pollution
is a serious problem, which requires understanding the transfer of mechanical, chemical,
and radioactive particles in the atmosphere.
In rareﬁed systems of particles, drops, or bubbles, the particle–particle interaction can
be neglected in the ﬁrst approximation; then one deals with the behavior of a single particle
moving in ﬂuid. In this case, the streamline pattern depends on the particle shape, the ﬂow
type (translational or shear), and a number of other geometric factors.
E4.6.1. Stokes Equations and Their Solution for the Axisymmetric
Case
◮Stokes equations. One of the main approaches to the analysis and simpliﬁcation of
the Navier–Stokes equations is as follows. One assumes that the nonlinear inertia term
 V ⋅∇

V is small compared with the linear viscous term ν∆V and hence can be neglected
altogether or taken into account in some special way. This method is well-founded for
Re = LU/ν ≪1 and is widely used for studying the motion of particles, drops, and bubbles
in ﬂuids. Low Reynolds numbers are typical of the following three cases: slow (creeping)
ﬂows, highly viscous ﬂuids, and small dimensions of particles.
For steady-state ﬂows of viscous incompressible ﬂuid, by neglecting the inertia terms
in (E4.2.1.4) and by including all conservative mass forces in the pressure P, we arrive at
the Stokes equations
∇⋅V = 0,
µ∆V = ∇P.
(E4.6.1.1)
The Stokes equations (E4.6.1.1) are linear and hence much simpler than the nonlinear
Navier–Stokes equations. For any two solutions {V1, P1} and {V2, P2} of (E4.6.1.1), the
sum {αV1 + βV2, αP1 + βP2} satisﬁes the same equations for any constants α and β.

E4.6. SPHERICAL PARTICLES AND CIRCULAR CYLINDERS IN TRANSLATIONAL FLOW
801
In axisymmetric problems, all the variables in the spherical coordinates R, θ, ϕ are
independent of ϕ, and the third component of the ﬂuid velocity is zero, Vϕ = 0. The ﬂuid
velocity components VR and Vθ can be expressed via the stream function Ψ as follows:
VR =

Vθ = –

Then the ﬁrst equation in (E4.6.1.1) (the continuity equation) is satisﬁed automatically. On
eliminating the terms containing the pressure from the second vector equation (E4.6.1.1)
and replacing the velocity components by the right-hand side of (E4.6.1.2), we obtain the
following equation for the stream function:

E4.6.2. Spherical Particles in Translational Stokes Flow (at Re →0)
◮Flow past a spherical particle. Consider a solid spherical particle of radius a in a
translational Stokes ﬂow with velocity Ui and dynamic viscosity µ (Figure E4.4).
We
assume that the ﬂuid has dynamic viscosity µ. We use the spherical coordinate system
R, θ, ϕ with origin at the center of the particle and with angle θ measured from the direction
of the incoming ﬂow (that is, from the rear stagnation point on the particle surface). In view
of the axial symmetry, only two components of the ﬂuid velocity, namely, VR and Vθ, are
nonzero, and all the unknowns are independent of the third coordinate ϕ.
The ﬂuid velocity distribution is given by the Stokes equations (E4.6.1.1) with the
no-slip boundary conditions on the surface of the solid sphere,
VR = Vθ = 0
at
R = a,
(E4.6.2.1)
and the boundary conditions at inﬁnity of the form

Vθ →–Ui sin θ
as
R →∞,
(E4.6.2.2)
which correspond to condition (E4.2.2.1) of translational unperturbed ﬂow far from the
particle.
By passing from the ﬂuid velocity components VR, Vθ to the stream function Ψ according
to formulas (E4.6.1.2), we arrive at Eq. (E4.6.1.3). It follows from the remote boundary
conditions (E4.6.2.2) that in the general solution (E4.6.1.4) it sufﬁces to retain only the
ﬁrst term (corresponding to the case n = 2). The no-slip conditions (E4.6.2.1) allow us to

The viscous drag acting on the spherical particle is given by the Stokes formula

◮Steady-state motion of spherical particles in a ﬂuid. In chemical technology, one
often meets the problem of a steady-state motion of a spherical particle with velocity Ui in
a quiescent ﬂuid. Since the Stokes equations are linear, the solution of this problem can be
obtained from formulas (E4.6.2.4) by adding the terms ¯V R = –Ui cos θ and ¯V θ = Ui sin θ,
which describe a translational ﬂow with velocity Ui in the direction opposite to the incoming
ﬂow.

where Re = ρUia/µ and ρ is the density of the ﬂuid. The Stokes law is conﬁrmed by

By equating the drag force F of the sphere with the difference 4

E4.6.3. Spherical Particles in Translational Flow in a Wide Range

◮Flow past spherical particles in a wide range of Re. Neglecting the inertia term for the
ﬂow past a sphere is adequate to experiments only in the limit case Re →0. For Re = 0.05,
the error in estimating the drag by formula (E4.6.2.6) is 1.5 to 2%, and for Re = 0.5 the
error becomes 10.5 to 11%. Therefore, one can use the estimate cf = 12/Re for the drag
coefﬁcient only for Re < 0.2 (in this case, the maximum error does not exceed 5%).
More exact than the Stokes law (E4.6.2.6) is the two-term Oseen’s expansion of the drag

For Re>0.5, asymptotic solutions no longer give an adequate description of translational
ﬂow of a viscous ﬂuid past a spherical particle.
Numerous available numerical solutions for the Navier–Stokes equations, as well as
experimental data, provide a detailed analysis of the ﬂow pattern for increasing Reynolds
numbers. For 0.5 < Re < 10, there is no ﬂow separation, although the fore-and-aft symmetry
typical of inertia-free Stokes ﬂow past a sphere is more and more distorted. Finally, at
Re ≈10, ﬂow separation occurs at the rear of the particle.
The range 10 < Re < 65 is characterized by the existence of a closed stable area at
the rear, in which there is an axisymmetric recirculating wake. As Re increases, the wake

lengthens, and the separation ring θs moves forward from the rear point (θs = 0◦at Re = 10)

(E4.6.3.2)
Here, as well as in (E4.6.3.3), θs is measured in degrees.
At Re> 65, the vorticity region in the rear area ceases to be stable and becomes unsteady.
At 65 < Re < 200, a long oscillating wake is formed behind the particle, which gradually
becomes turbulent for 200 < Re < 1.5 × 105. Simultaneously, the separation point moves
upstream according to the law
θs = 102 – 213 Re–0.37
for
200 < Re < 1.5 × 105.
(E4.6.3.3)
◮Formulas for the drag coefﬁcient in a wide range of Re.
We give two simple
approximate formulas for the drag coefﬁcient of a spherical particle

200 ≤Re ≤2500,
(E4.6.3.4)
where the Reynolds number is determined with respect to the radius. In formulas (E4.6.3.4),
the maximum error does not exceed 5% in the given ranges.
In a wide range of Reynolds numbers, one can use the following more complicated
approximation to the drag coefﬁcient:
cf = 12
Re
 1 + 0.241 Re0.687
+ 0.42
 1 + 1.902 × 104 Re–1.16–1,
whose maximum error does not exceed 6% for Re < 1.5 × 105.
At Re ≈1.5×105, one can observe the “drag crisis” characterized by a sharp decrease in
the drag coefﬁcient; the boundary layer becomes more and more turbulent; the separation
point shifts abruptly to the aft area.
For Re ≥1.7 × 105, the drag coefﬁcient can be calculated by the formulas
cf =

E4.6.4. Translational Flow Past a Cylinder (the Plane Problem)
Inchemical technologyand power engineering, equipment containingheat exchanging pipes
and various cylindrical links immersed in a moving ﬂuid is often used. The estimation of
the hydrodynamic action on these elements is based on the solution of the plane problem
on the ﬂow past a cylinder.
◮Flow past a cylinder at low Reynolds numbers. Consider the translational ﬂow of a
viscous incompressible ﬂuid with velocity Ui about a circular cylinder of radius a. The drag

where F is the force per unit length of the cylinder and ρ is the density of the ﬂuid.
Comparison with experimental data shows that formula (E4.6.4.1) can be used for
0 < Re < 0.4.
◮Flow past a cylinder at moderate Reynolds numbers. According to experimental
data, a nonseparating ﬂow past a circular cylinder is realized at Re ≤2.5. At such Reynolds
numbers, one can use the following approximate formula for calculating the drag coefﬁcient:
cf = 5.65 Re–0.78 1 + 0.26 Re0.82
for
0.05 ≤Re ≤2.5;
this formula was obtained from experimental and numerical results.
If the Reynolds number becomes larger than the critical value Re ≈2.5, then the vortex
counterﬂow with closed streamlines arises near the rear point, that is, separation occurs. As
the Reynolds number increases, the separation point gradually moves from the axis upward
along the cylinder surface. The drag coefﬁcient for a separated ﬂow past a cylinder at
moderate Reynolds numbers can be calculated by the empirical formulas
cf = 5.65 × 10–0.78 1 + 0.333 Re0.55
cf = 5.65 × 10–0.78 1 + 0.148 Re0.82
for
2.5 < Re ≤20,
for
20 < Re ≤200.
◮Flow past a cylinder at high Reynolds numbers. With further increase of Re, the
rear vortices become longer and then alternative vortex separation occurs (the K´arm´an
vortex street is formed). Simultaneously, the separation point moves closer to the equatorial
section. The frequency νf of vortex shedding from the rear area is an important characteristic
of the ﬂow past a cylinder. It can be determined from the empirical formula
St = 0.13
cf

1 – exp(–2.38 cf)

,
where St = aνf/Ui is the Strouhal number.
We also present another useful formula for the vortex separation frequency:
νf =
0.08 Ui/b, where b is the half-width of the wake at the point of destruction.
Starting from Re ≈0.5 × 103, one can speak of a developed hydrodynamic boundary
layer. The ﬂow remains laminar in a considerable part of this layer. If the Reynolds number
varies in the range 0.5×103 < Re < 0.5×105, the separation point θs of the laminar boundary
layer gradually moves from 71.2◦to 95◦.
For Re > 2000, the wake becomes totally turbulent at large distances from the body.
The curve cf(Re) contains two straight-line segments (self-similarity areas), where the
drag coefﬁcient is practically constant,
cf = 1.0
cf = 1.1
for
3 × 102 < Re < 3 × 103,
for
4 × 103 < Re < 105.
In the intermediate region between these segments, the drag coefﬁcient monotonically
increases with Reynolds number.

within the boundary layer takes place at higher Reynolds numbers Re ≈105 and is accompa-

constant value

E4.7. Spherical Drops and Bubbles in Translational Flow
E4.7.1. Spherical Drops and Bubbles in Translational Stokes Flow
(at Re →0)
◮Flow past a spherical drop or bubble. Now consider a spherical drop of radius a in a
translational Stokes ﬂow of another ﬂuid with velocity Ui (Figure E4.5). We assume that
the dynamic viscosities of the outer and inner ﬂuids are equal to µ1 and µ2, respectively.
The unknown variables outside and inside the drop are indicated by the superscripts (1)
and (2), respectively.
To obtain the velocity and pressure proﬁles for the ﬂuid in each phase, we shall use the
Stokes equations (E4.6.1.1). As previously, the condition that the ﬂow is uniform far from
the drop has the form (E4.6.2.2).
Let us write out four conditions that must be satisﬁed on the boundary of a spherical
drop.
There is no ﬂow across the interface:

As β = µ2/µ1 →∞, Eq. (E4.7.1.10) becomes the Stokes formula (E4.6.2.5) for a solid
particle. The passage to the limit as β →0 corresponds to a gas bubble.
◮Steady-state motion of drops and bubbles in a ﬂuid. Consider the problem of a
steady-state motion of a spherical drop or bubble with velocity Ui in a quiescent ﬂuid.
Since the Stokes equations are linear, the solution of this problem can be obtained from
formulas (E4.7.1.7) and (E4.7.1.8) by adding the terms ¯V R = –Ui cos θ and ¯V θ = Ui sin θ,

Relations (E4.7.1.11) and (E4.7.1.12) cover the entire range 0 ≤β ≤∞of the phase
viscosity ratio. In the limit case β →∞, formulas (E4.7.1.11) and (E4.7.1.12) become
formulas (E4.6.2.6) and (E4.6.2.7) for a solid spherical particle. In the other limit case β = 0

(E4.7.1.13)
These formulas hold only for extremely pure liquids without any surfactants.
It is known that even very small quantities of surfactants are adsorbed on the bubble
surface and lead to its “solidiﬁcation.” This results in eliminating internal circulation, and
hence the bubble rises according to the Stokes law (E4.7.1.11) for solid particles.
E4.7.2. Spherical Drops and Bubbles in Translational Flow at

limit cases Re →0 and Re →∞, formula (E4.7.2.1) gives correct asymptotic results; its
maximum error for intermediate Reynolds numbers is less than 4.5%. The drag coefﬁcient
of a spherical bubble monotonically decreases as the Reynolds number increases.
◮Drop in a translational liquid ﬂow. For the drag coefﬁcient of a spherical drop in a

E4.8. FLOW PAST NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES

The spherical form of a drop or a bubble in a Stokes ﬂow follows from the fact that the
ﬂow is inertia-free. However, even for the case in which the inertia forces dominate viscous
forces and the Reynolds number cannot be considered small, the drop remains undeformed
if the inertia forces are small compared with the capillary forces. The ratio of inertial to
capillary forces is measured by the Weber number We = ρ1U2
i a/σ, where σ is the surface
tension at the drop boundary. For small We, a deformable drop will preserve the spherical
form.
At the end of Subsection E4.7.1, it was already noted that even a small amount of
surfactants in any of the adjacent phases may lead to the “solidiﬁcation” of the interface, so
that the laws of ﬂow around a drop become close to those for a solid particle. This effect
often occurs in practice.
The drag coefﬁcient of a spherical drop can be determined by the formula
cf(β, Re) =
1
β + 1 cf(0, Re) +
β
β + 1 cf(∞, Re).
(E4.7.2.3)
Here cf(0, Re) is the drag coefﬁcient of the spherical bubble, which can be calculated by
the formula (E4.7.2.1), and cf(∞, Re) is the drag coefﬁcient of a solid spherical particle,
which can be calculated by (E4.6.3.4). The approximate expression (E4.7.2.3) gives three
correct terms of the expansion for small Reynolds numbers; for 0 ≤Re ≤50, the maximum
error is less than 5%.
E4.8. Flow Past Nonspherical Particles
E4.8.1. Translational Stokes Flow Past Ellipsoidal Particles
The axisymmetric problem about a translational Stokes ﬂow past an ellipsoidal particle
admits an exact closed-form solution. In what follows, we present a brief summary of the
corresponding results (see Happel & Brenner, 1965).
◮Oblate ellipsoid of revolution. Consider an oblate ellipsoid of revolution with semiaxes
a and b (a > b) in a translational Stokes ﬂow with velocity Ui. We assume that the ﬂuid
viscosity is equal to µ.
We pass from the Cartesian coordinates X, Y , Z to the reference frame σ, τ, ϕ ﬁxed to
the oblate ellipsoid of revolution by using the transformations
X2 = m2(1 + σ2)(1 – τ 2) cos2 ϕ,
Y 2 = m2(1 + σ2)(1 – τ 2) sin2 ϕ,
Z = mστ,
where
m =
p
a2 – b2
(σ ≥0, –1 ≤τ ≤1).
As a result, the ellipsoid surface is given by a constant value of the coordinate σ:
σ = σ0,
where
σ0 =

(a/b)2 – 1
–1/2.
Since the problem is axisymmetric, we introduce the stream function as
Vσ =

∂Ψ
∂τ ,
Vτ = –
1
m2p
(1 – τ 2)(σ2 + τ 2)

Then the Stokes equations (E4.6.1.1) are reduced to one equation for Ψ, which can be
solved by the separation of variables. By satisfying the boundary condition for a uniform
ﬂow remote from the particle and the no-slip conditions at the particle boundary, we obtain

The force exerted on the ellipsoid by the ﬂuid is

As σ0 →0, an oblate ellipsoid degenerates into an inﬁnite thin disk of radius a. By
passing to the limit in (E4.8.1.1), we can obtain the following expression for the stream
function:
Ψ = – 1
π a2Ui(1 – τ 2)

The disk moving in the direction perpendicular to its plane with velocity Ui in a quiescent
ﬂuid experiences the drag force
F = 16µaUi,
(E4.8.1.2)
which is less than the force acting on a sphere of the same radius (for the sphere, we have
F = 6πµaUi). Formula (E4.8.1.2) is conﬁrmed by experimental data.
◮Prolate ellipsoid of revolution. Tosolve the correspondingproblem about an ellipsoidal
particle in a translational Stokes ﬂow, we use the reference frame σ, τ, ϕ ﬁxed to the prolate
ellipsoid of revolution. The transformation to the coordinates (σ, τ, ϕ) is determined by the
formulas
X2 = m2(σ2 – 1)(1 – τ 2) cos2 ϕ,
Y 2 = m2(σ2 – 1)(1 – τ 2) sin2 ϕ,
Z = mστ,
where
m =

Here, as previously, the larger semiaxis is denoted by a. In this case, the ellipsoid surface
is given by the equation

where
σ0 =

ln(a/b) + 0.193 .
E4.8.2. Translational Stokes Flow Past Bodies of Revolution
Consider bodies of revolution of any shape with arbitrary orientation in a translational ﬂow
at low Reynolds numbers. We assume that the axis of the body of revolution forms an
angle ω with the direction of the ﬂuid velocity at inﬁnity (Figure E4.6). The unit vector i
directed along the ﬂow can be represented as the sum i = τ cos ω + n sin ω, where τ is the
unit vector directed along the body axis and n the unit vector in the plane of rotation of the
body. In the Stokes approximation, the drag force is given by the following expression in
the general case:
F = τF∥cos ω + nF⊥sin ω,
(E4.8.2.1)
where F∥and F⊥are the drag forces of the body of revolution for its parallel (ω = 0) and
perpendicular (ω = π/2) positions in the translational ﬂow.
The projection of the drag force onto the incoming ﬂow direction is equal to the inner
product
(F ⋅i ) = F∥cos2 ω + F⊥sin2 ω.
(E4.8.2.2)
It follows from (E4.8.2.1) and (E4.8.2.2) that to calculate the drag force of a body of
revolution of any shape with arbitrary orientation in a Stokes ﬂow, it sufﬁces to know the
value of this force only for two special positions of the body in space. The “axial” (F∥)
and “transversal” (F⊥) drags can be obtained both theoretically and experimentally. In
what follows, we present the expressions for F∥and F⊥for some bodies of revolution of
nonspherical shape.
For a thin circular disk of radius a, one has
F∥= 16µaUi,
F⊥= 32
3 µaUi.

812
HYDRODYNAMICS
For a dumbbell-like particle consisting of two adjacent spheres of equal radius a, one
has
F∥= 12πµaUiλ∥,
F⊥= 12πµaUiλ⊥,
λ∥≈0.645,
λ⊥≈0.716.
In these formulas, the product 12πµaUi is equal to the sum of drag forces for two isolated
spheres of radius a.
For oblate ellipsoids of revolution with semiaxes a and b, one has
F∥= 3.77 (4a + b),
F⊥= 3.77 (3a + 2b),
(E4.8.2.3)
where a is the equatorial radius (a > b).
For prolate ellipsoids of revolution with semiaxes a and b, one has
F∥= 3.77 (a + 4b),
F⊥= 3.77 (2a + 3b),
(E4.8.2.4)
where b is the equatorial radius (b > a).
Formulas (E4.8.2.3) and (E4.8.2.4) are approximate.
They work well for slightly
deformed ellipsoids of revolution. In (E4.8.2.3), the maximum error is less than 6% for any
ratio of the semiaxes.
E4.8.3. Translational Stokes Flow Past Particles of Arbitrary Shape
◮Hydrodynamic force and angular momentum acting on a particle. A particle of
arbitrary shape moving in an inﬁnite ﬂuid that is at rest at inﬁnity is subject to the action of
the hydrodynamic force and angular momentum due to its translational motion and rotation,
respectively:
F = µ(K U + S ω),
(E4.8.3.1)
M = µ(S U + Ωω),
(E4.8.3.2)
where K, S, and Ωare tensors of rank two depending on the particle geometry.
The symmetric tensor K = [Kij] is called translational. It characterizes the drag of a
body under translational motion and depends only on the size and shape of the body. In the
principal axes, the translation tensor is reduced to the diagonal form
K =
" K1
0
0
0
K2
0
0
0
K3
#
,
(E4.8.3.3)
where K1, K2, and K3 are the principal drags acting on the body as it moves along the major
axes. For orthotropic bodies (with three symmetry planes orthogonal to each other), the
principal axes of the translational tensor are perpendicular to the corresponding symmetry
planes.
For axisymmetric bodies,, one of the axes (say, the ﬁrst) is a major axis, and
K2 = K3. For a sphere of radius a, any three pairwise perpendicular axes are major, and
K1 = K2 = K3 = 6πa.
A symmetric tensor Ωis called a rotational tensor. It depends both on the shape and size
of the particle and on the choice of the origin. The rotational tensor characterizes the drag
under rotation of the body and has diagonal form with entries Ω1, Ω2, Ω3 in the principal
axes (the positions of the principal axes of the rotational and translational tensors in space
are different). For axisymmetric bodies, one of the major axes (for instance, the ﬁrst) is

E4.8. FLOW PAST NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES
813
parallel to the symmetry axis, and in this case Ω2 = Ω3. For a spherical particle, we have
Ω1 = Ω2 = Ω3.
The tensor S is symmetric only at a point O unique for each body; this point is
called the center of hydrodynamic reaction.
This tensor is called the conjugate tensor
and characterizes the combined reaction of the body under translational and rotational
motion (the drag moment in the translational motion and the drag force in the rotational
motion). For bodies with orthotropic, axial, or spherical symmetry, the conjugate tensor is
zero. However, it is necessary to take this tensor into account for bodies with helicoidal
symmetry (propeller-like bodies).
In problems of gravity settling of particles, the translational tensor is most important.
◮Principal drags of some nonspherical bodies.
For a thin circular disk of radius a, we have
K1 = 16a,
K2 = 32
3 a,
K3 = 32
3 a.
(E4.8.3.4)
For needle-like ellipsoids of length l and radius a, one has
K1 =
4πl
2 ln(l/a) – 1 ,
K2 =
4πl
ln(l/a) + 0.5 ,
K3 =
4πl
ln(l/a) + 0.5 .
(E4.8.3.5)
For thin circular cylinders of length l and radius a, one has
K1 =
4πl
ln(l/a) – 0.72 ,
K2 =
4πl
ln(l/a) + 0.5 ,
K3 =
4πl
ln(l/a) + 0.5 .
(E4.8.3.6)
For a dumbbell-like particle consisting of two adjacent spheres of equal radius a, one
has
K1 = 24.3 a,
K2 = 27.0 a,
K3 = 27.0 a.
(E4.8.3.7)
◮Axisymmetric bodies of arbitrary shape. For axisymmetric bodies of arbitrary shape,
we introduce the notion of perimeter-equivalent sphere. To this end, we project all points
of the surface of the body on a plane perpendicular to its axis. The projection is a circle of
radius a⊥. The perimeter-equivalent sphere has the same radius.
We let ¯c∥denote the relative coefﬁcient of the axial drag equal to the ratio of the axial
drag of an axisymmetric body to the drag of a sphere with equivalent perimeter.
The
relative coefﬁcients of transversal drag ¯c⊥equal to the ratio of the transversal drag of
an axisymmetric body to the drag of a sphere with equivalent perimeter are introduced
similarly.
Experimental data and numerical results for principal values of the translational tensor
for some axisymmetric and orthotropic bodies (cylinders, doubled cones, parallelepipeds)
are well approximated by the following dependence for the relative coefﬁcient of the axial
drag:
¯c∥= 0.244 + 1.035 Σ – 0.712 Σ2 + 0.441 Σ3
(0.4 ≤Σ ≤1.2).
The values of the perimeter-equivalent factor Σ are equal to the ratio of the surface area of
the particle to the surface area of the perimeter-equivalent sphere.
To determine the relative coefﬁcients of transversal drag, one can use the formula
¯c⊥= 0.392 + 0.621 Σ – 0.04 Σ2,
which is well consistent with experimental data for 0.5 ≤Σ ≤4.5.

HYDRODYNAMICS
E4.8.4. Sedimentation of Isotropic and Nonisotropic Particles
◮Sedimentation of isotropic particles.
The steady-state rate Ui of particle settling
in mass force ﬁelds, primarily, in the gravitational ﬁeld, is an important hydrodynamic
characteristic of processes in chemical technology such as settling and sedimentation. Any
spherically isotropic body homogeneous with respect to density experiences the same drag
under translational motion regardless of its orientation. Such a body is also isotropic with
respect to any pair of forces that arise when it rotates around an arbitrary axis passing
though its center. If at the initial time such a body has some orientation in ﬂuid and can fall
without initial rotation, then this body falls vertically without rotation, preserving its initial
orientation.
It is convenient to describe the free fall of nonspherical isotropic particles by using the
sphericity parameter
ψ = Se
S∗
,
where S∗is the surface area of the particle and Se is the surface area of the volume-equivalent
sphere. If the motion is slow, one can calculate the settling rate by the empirical formula
Ui = 2
9
Q∆ρa2
e
µ
g,
where ae is the radius of the volume-equivalent sphere and
Q = 0.843 ln
ψ
0.065 .
We present some values of the sphericity factor ψ for some particles: sphere, 1.000;
octahedron, 0.846; cube, 0.806; tetrahedron, 0.670.
◮Sedimentation of nonisotropic particles. If thevelocityof a spherical particle in Stokes
settling is always codirected with the gravity force, even for homogeneous axisymmetric
particles the velocity is directed vertically if and only if the vertical coincides with one of
the principal axes of the translational tensor K. If the angle between the symmetry axis and
the vertical is ϕ, then the velocity direction is given by the angle
θ = π + arctan
 K2
K1
tan ϕ

,
where K1 and K2 are the axial and transversal principal drags to the translational motion.
The velocity is given by
Ui = V ∆ρg
µ
(K2
1 cos2 θ + K2
2 sin2 θ)–1/2,
where V is the particle volume.
If the settling direction is not vertical, this means that a falling particle is subject to
the action of a transverse force, which leads to its horizontal displacement. An additional
complication is that the center of hydrodynamic reaction (including the buoyancy force)
does not coincide with the particle center of mass. In this case, in addition to the translational
motion, the particle is subject to rotation under the action of the arising moment of forces
(e.g., the “somersault” of a bullet with displaced center of mass ).
For axisymmetric
particles, this rotation stops when the system “the mass center + the reaction center”

E4.8. FLOW PAST NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES
815
becomes stable, that is, the mass center is ahead of the reaction center. In this case, the
settling trajectory becomes stable and rectilinear.
However, in the more general case of an asymmetric particle, the combined action of the
lateral and rotational forces may lead to motion along a 3D (for instance, spiral, trajectory).
At the same time, a steady-state settling trajectory with helicoidal (propeller-like) symmetry
remains rectilinear, notwithstanding the body rotation.
Two theorems are useful for estimating the steady-state rate of settling of Stokes non-
spherical particles. One theorem, proved by Hill & Power (1956), states that the Stokes
drag of an arbitrary body moving in a viscous ﬂuid is larger than the Stokes drag of any
inscribed body. Thus, to determine the upper and lower bounds for the Stokes drag of a
body of an exotic shape, one can suggest a reasonable set of inscribed and circumscribed
bodies with known drags. The other theorem, proved by Weinberger (1972), states that of
all particles of different shape but equal volume, the spherical particle has the maximum
Stokes settling rate.
◮Mean velocity of nonisotropic particles falling in a ﬂuid. The mean ﬂow rate velocity
〈U〉of a particle, which is obtained in a large number of experiments when an arbitrarily
oriented particle falls in a ﬂuid, is determined for the Stokes ﬂow by the formula:
〈U〉= V ∆ρ
µK
g,
(E4.8.4.1)
where V is the particle volume, ∆ρ is the difference between the densities of the particle
and the ﬂuid, g is the free fall acceleration, and K is the average drag expressed via the
principal drags as
1
K
= 1

 1

K2

K3

.
(E4.8.4.2)
The average drag force acting on an arbitrarily oriented particle falling in ﬂuid is given
by
〈F〉= –µK〈U〉.
(E4.8.4.3)
Formulas (E4.8.4.1)–(E4.8.4.3) are important in view of some problems of Brownian
motion.
In the special case of a spherical particle, one must set V = 4
3 πa3 and K = 6πa in
(E4.8.4.1).
Let us calculate the average drag for a thin disk of radius a. To this end, we substitute
the principal drags (E4.8.3.4) into (E4.8.4.2). As a result, we obtain
K = 12a.
Substituting the coefﬁcients K1, K2, and K3 from (E4.8.3.5)–(E4.8.3.7) into (E4.8.4.2)
and using (E4.8.4.1), one obtains the average settling rate for the above-mentioned non-
spherical bodies.
E4.8.5. Flow Past Nonspherical Particles at Various Reynolds
Numbers
The Stokes ﬂow around particles of any shape is separation-free—that is, the stream lines
come from inﬁnity—bend round the body everywhere closely attaining the body surface,
and return to inﬁnity. However, for higher Reynolds numbers, separation occurs, which
leads to wake formation behind the body. As the Reynolds number increases, the size of the

816
HYDRODYNAMICS
wake region (the wake length) grows differently for different bodies. With further increase
in the Reynolds number, the wake becomes unsteady and completely turbulent and goes to
inﬁnity. The force action of the ﬂow on the body is closely related to the wake size and state.
The limit asymptotic cases of this action are the Stokes (as Re →0) and the Newtonian (as
Re →∞) regimes of ﬂow. We have already considered the characteristics of the Stokes
ﬂow. The Newtonian regime of ﬂow is characterized by the fact that the drag coefﬁcient cf
of the body is constant.
In axial ﬂow past disks, which are the limit cases of axisymmetric bodies of small length,
the drag coefﬁcients for the entire range of Reynolds numbers calculated with respect to
the radius can be determined by approximate formulas, which agree well with numerical
results and experimental data:
cf = 10.2 Re–1(1 + 0.318 Re)
cf = 10.2 Re–1(1 + 10s)
cf = 10.2 Re–1(1 + 0.239 Re0.792)
cf = 1.17
for
Re ≤0.005,
for
0.005 < Re ≤0.75,
for
0.75 < Re ≤66.5,
for
Re > 66.5,
where s = –0.61 + 0.906 log10 Re – 0.025 (log10 Re)2.
The steady-state settling rate of a particle of an arbitrary shape (for Newtonian regime
of a ﬂow at high Reynolds numbers) can be obtained by the formula
U = 0.69 γ1/36[gae(γ – 1)(1.08 – ψ)]1/2
for
1.1 < γ < 8.6,
where γ is the particle-ﬂuid density ratio, ae is the radius of the volume-equivalent sphere,
and ψ is the ratio of the area of the volume-equivalent sphere to the particle surface area.
E4.9. Motion of Several Particles. Effective Viscosity of
Suspensions
The motion of a particle in inﬁnite ﬂuid creates some velocity and pressure ﬁelds. Neigh-
boring particles move in already perturbed hydrodynamic ﬁelds. Simultaneously, the ﬁrst
particle itself experiences hydrodynamic interaction with the neighboring particles and
neighboring moving or ﬁxed surfaces. Since in a majority of actual disperse systems, the
existence of an ensemble of particles and the apparatus walls is inevitable, the consideration
of the hydrodynamic interaction between these objects is very important. One method for
obtaining the required information about the interaction is based on the construction of ex-
act closed-form solutions. However, even within the framework of Stokes hydrodynamics,
to describe the motion of an ensemble of particles is a very complicated problem, which
admits an exact closed-form solution only in exceptional cases.
E4.9.1. Motion of Two Spheres. Gravitational Sedimentation of
Several Spheres
◮Motion of two spheres along a line passing through their centers. Consider the
axisymmetric problem about the motion of two spheres at the same velocity U. In the
Stokes approximation, the force acting on each of the spheres is described by the formula
F = 6πµaUλ,
(E4.9.1.1)

the distance l between the centers of the spheres. In the case of spheres of equal radii, the

For numerical calculations, it is convenient to use the approximate formula
λ = 0.88 a + l
2.5 a + l ,
(E4.9.1.3)
whose maximal error is less than 1.3% for any a and l.
Since λ ≤1, it follows from (E4.9.1.1) that the velocity of the steady-state motion of
each of the spheres in the ensemble is greater than the velocity of a single sphere.
◮Gravitational sedimentation of several spheres. Some relations between the drag
force F and the sedimentation velocity U averaged with respect to various orientations
of particles of equal radius in space were obtained by Happel & Brenner (1965). It was
assumed that the maximum distance l between the sphere centers is much larger than their
radius a. In all considered cases, the drag force is described by formula (E4.9.1.1), where
λ is the correction coefﬁcient depending on the conﬁguration of the system of particles.
In what follows, we write out the correction coefﬁcient for some typical conﬁgurations of
particles.
For a system of two spheres, one has
λ =

For a system of three spheres arranged in a line,
λ =

For a system of eight spheres arranged in vertices of a cube,

HYDRODYNAMICS
E4.9.2. Rate of Suspension Precipitation. Effective Viscosity of
Suspensions
◮Cellular model. Rate of suspension precipitation. The two-phase media with large
number of particles are described by a widely used approximate model, namely, the cell
model. To each particle of the disperse phase, this model assigns the corresponding volume
of the free liquid. Thus, the entire suspension (or emulsion) is divided into a collection of
spherical cells of radius b whose centers coincide with the centers of particles of radius a.
The geometric parameters of these cells are related to the volume concentration φ of the
disperse phase as follows:
b = aφ–1/3.
The deﬁnition of a particle velocity U determines the axial symmetry of the problem,
which is convenient to consider in spherical coordinates. In the Stokes approximation, the
general solution of such a problem is determined by formula (E4.6.1.4), where arbitrary
constants must be determined from the conditions that the solution is bounded at inﬁnity
and the velocity is known on the particle surface and from some other conditions on the cell
boundary (for R = b). The condition that the normal velocity on this boundary is zero—that
is, there is no ﬂow across the cell—is undoubtedly obvious. The second condition, which
is necessary for the complete identiﬁcation of the solution, leads to different opinions.
Cunningham postulated that the tangential velocity is zero, thus considering a cell as a
container with rigid boundary. Happel proposed to use the condition that the tangential
stress is zero, thus postulating that the cell is an isolated force unit (is in equilibrium under
the action of forces). Kuwabara proposed to use the condition that the vortex intensity is
zero on the cell boundary. Finally, Slobodov and Chepura assumed that the vortex intensity
ﬂux vanishes on the cell boundary.
The choice of the boundary condition essentially determines the model of force inter-
action between the particle at the center of the cell and the other particles. The steady-state
velocities of the gravitational sedimentation in suspensions obtained with the help of cell
models were compared with numerous experimental data and it was shown that the most
precise results can be obtained by using the Slobodov–Chepura model. This model, under
the assumption that the particle at the cell center is a drop of a liquid with different viscos-
ity, leads to formula (E4.9.1.1) for the drag forces, where the correction coefﬁcient can be
calculated as
λ =
β + 2
3
1 – 3
5 φ1/3 – 2
5 φ2 + β(1 – 9
10 φ1/3 + 1
2 φ + 2
5 φ2)
,
β = µ2
µ1
.
As φ →0 and β →∞, we have λ →1, which corresponds to the Stokes drag law.
◮Effective viscosity of suspensions. Suspensions of particles in ﬂuid are widely used in
various processes of chemical technology. If the dimensions of particles in the suspension
are essentially smaller than those of the apparatus, then one can consider the suspension as
some continuous medium with properties other than properties of the disperse phase.
Very often, this medium remains Newtonian from the viewpoint of its rheological
properties, but the viscosity of this medium is somewhat larger than that of the continuous
phase. This viscosity µef is called the effective viscosity. In practice, it is convenient to
relate the effective viscosity to the viscosity µ of the continuous phase and consider the
dimensionless effective viscosity ¯µ = µef/µ.
The value ¯µ depends primarily on the volume concentration of the disperse phase φ.
The well-known Einstein formula
¯µ = 1 + 2.5 φ,
(E4.9.2.1)

holds for strongly rareﬁed suspensions of solid spherical particles.
For 0 ≤φ ≤0.4, the results of experimental and numerical calculations are well approx-
imated by the formula
¯µ = 1 + 2.5 φ + 12.5 φ2,
which becomes the Einstein formula (E4.9.2.1) as φ →0.
The dimensionless effective viscosity of a rareﬁed emulsion of spherical drops and
bubbles moving in a ﬂuid can be determined by the formula
¯µ = 1 + 5β + 2
2β + 2 φ,
(E4.9.2.2)
where β is the ratio of the drop viscosity to the ﬂuid viscosity. By passing to the limit
as β →∞in (E4.9.2.2), one obtains the Einstein formula (E4.9.2.1). The value β = 0
corresponds to gas bubbles.

Mass and Heat Transfer
E5.1. Convective Mass and Heat Transfer. Equations and
Boundary Conditions
E5.1.1. Mass and Heat Transfer in Laminar Flows
◮Mass concentration. So far, we have considered the motion of ﬂuids of homogeneous
physical and chemical composition. In practice, one often meets more complicated situa-
tions in which the ﬂuid contains dissolved substances (contaminants or reactants) and is a
solution or a mixture.
Water solutions of common salt or sugar and water-alcohol mixtures are the simplest
examples of such systems.
The composition of solutions and mixtures is usually characterized by the mass density
of the substance (the mass of dissolved substance per unit volume) or the dimensionless
mass concentration C (the ratio of the mass density of a substance to the total density of the
mixture). The latter is normally used in this chapter; for brevity, we refer to it simply as the
concentration.
◮Convective mass transfer equation. Let us write out the main equations and boundary
conditions used in the mathematical statement of mass transfer and chemical hydrodynamic
problems.
We assume that the medium density and viscosity are independent of the
concentration and that the concentration distribution does not affect the ﬂow ﬁeld. This
allows one to analyze the hydrodynamic problem about the ﬂuid motion and the diffusion
problem of ﬁnding the concentration ﬁeld independently. It is assumed that the information
about the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld necessary for the solution of the diffusion problem is known.
We also assume that the diffusion coefﬁcient is independent of the concentration.
For
simplicity, we restrict our considerations to the case of two-component solutions.
In Cartesian coordinates X, Y , Z, the solute transfer in absence of homogeneous trans-
formations is described by the equation
∂C
∂t + VX
∂C
∂X + VY
∂C
∂Y + VZ
∂C
∂Z = D
 ∂2C
∂X2 + ∂2C
∂Y 2 + ∂2C
∂Z2

,
(E5.1.1.1)
where C is the concentration, D is the diffusion coefﬁcient, and VX, VY , and VZ are the
ﬂuid velocity components, which are assumed to be given.
Equation (E5.1.1.1) reﬂects the fact that the transfer of a substance in a moving medium
is due to two distinct physical mechanisms.
First, there is molecular diffusion due to
concentration difference in a liquid or gas, which tends to equalize the concentrations.
Second, the solute is carried along by the moving medium. The combination of these two
processes is usually called convective diffusion.
◮Initial condition and the simplest boundary conditions. To complete the statement
of the problem, it is necessary to supplement equation (E5.1.1.1) with initial and boundary
conditions. As the initial condition, one usually takes the concentration proﬁle in the ﬂow
821

822
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
at time t = 0. The boundary conditions are, as a rule, given on some surface and far from it,
in the bulk of the solution. The latter condition corresponds to prescribing the unperturbed
concentration Ci at inﬁnity:
ξ∗→∞,
C →Ci,
(E5.1.1.2)
where ξ∗is the distance measured along the normal to the surface.
In solid dissolution problems, it is usually assumed in the boundary conditions that the
concentration is zero in the bulk of the ﬂuid, Ci = 0, and constant on the crystal surface,
ξ∗= 0,
C = Cs,
(E5.1.1.3)
where Cs is given. The boundary conditions (E5.1.1.2) (with Ci = 0) and (E5.1.1.3) are
also used in liquid drop evaporation problems.
The boundary conditions on a surface where a chemical reaction occurs depend on the
speciﬁc physical statement of the problem. In the special case of an “inﬁnitely rapid”
heterogeneous chemical reaction, the corresponding boundary condition has the form
ξ∗= 0,
C = 0
(E5.1.1.4)
and means that the reagent is completely taken up in the reaction on the interface. Such
a situation is often called the diffusion regime of reaction. Condition (E5.1.1.4) has the
following meaning: the chemical reaction on the interface proceeds vigorously, so that all
the substance that approaches the interface takes part in the reaction. Note that condition
(E5.1.1.4) is a special case of (E5.1.1.3) for Cs = 0.
◮Dimensionless mass transfer equation and boundary conditions. Let us introduce
a characteristic length a (for example, the particle or tube radius) and a characteristic
velocity U (for example, the unperturbed ﬂow velocity far from a particle or the ﬂuid
velocity on the tube axis). First, consider the boundary conditions (E5.1.1.2) and (E5.1.1.3).
Then it is convenient to rewrite equation (E5.1.1.1) for the convective mass transfer in the
following dimensionless form. We introduce dimensionless variables by setting
τ = Dt

x = X

y = Y

and substitute them into (E5.1.1.1). As a result, we obtain

(E5.1.1.6)
Here the Peclet number Pe = aU/D is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the ratio
of convective transfer to diffusion transfer and a is a characteristic length (tube radius, ﬁlm
thickness, etc.).
In the new variables (E5.1.1.5), the boundary condition far from the surface (E5.1.1.2)
has the form
ξ →∞,
c →0.
(E5.1.1.7)
In a similar way, taking into account (E5.1.1.3) and (E5.1.1.5), we obtain the boundary
condition
ξ = 0,
c = 1.
(E5.1.1.8)

E5.1. CONVECTIVE MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER. EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

For brevity, we rewrite the convective diffusion equation (E5.1.1.6) in the following
frequently used form:

 v ⋅∇

c = ∆c,
(E5.1.1.9)
where∇is theHamiltonoperator and ∆is the Laplace operator; the explicit form of these op-
erators in the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z follows by comparing (E5.1.1.6) and (E5.1.1.9).
◮Heat transfer equation. Boundary conditions. We assume that the medium density
and viscosity and the thermal conductivity coefﬁcient are independent of temperature and
that the temperature distribution does not affect the ﬂow ﬁeld. This allows one to analyze
the hydrodynamic problem about the ﬂuid motion and the heat problem of ﬁnding the
temperature ﬁeld independently. It is assumed that the information about the ﬂuid velocity
ﬁeld necessary for the solution of the heat problem is known.
The equation of heat transfer in a moving medium is similar to the convective diffusion
equation (E5.1.1.1) and has the form
∂T∗
∂t + VX
∂T∗
∂X + VY
∂T∗


,
(E5.1.1.10)
where T∗is temperature and χ is the thermal diffusivity. The dissipative heating of ﬂuid is
neglected in Eq. (E5.1.1.10).
For nonstationary problems, the temperature distribution in the ﬂow at the initial instant
of time must be given.
Far from the surface, one usually has the condition that temperature is constant in the
ﬂow region:
ξ∗→∞,
T∗→Ti.
(E5.1.1.11)
For body–medium heat exchange problems, if constant temperature is maintained on
the body surface, the second boundary condition is
ξ∗= 0,
T∗= Ts.
(E5.1.1.12)
By using the new dimensionless variables
¯τ = χt

(E5.1.1.13)
one can rewrite Eq. (E5.1.1.10) and the boundary conditions (E5.1.1.11) and (E5.1.1.12) in
the form
∂T

T = ∆T;
(E5.1.1.14)
ξ →∞,

(E5.1.1.15)
Obviously, from the mathematical viewpoint, the problem for equation (E5.1.1.14) with
conditions (E5.1.1.15) describing the body–medium heat exchange is identical to problem
(E5.1.1.6)–(E5.1.1.8) describing the ﬂow–particle mass exchange in the case of a diffusion
regime of reaction on the particle surface. By virtue of this analogy, in what follows we
usually consider only mass transfer problems.

824
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
E5.1.2. Basic Dimensionless Parameters. Diffusion Fluxes and the
Sherwood Number
◮Basic dimensionless parameters. The diffusion and thermal Peclet numbers in the
convective mass and heat transfer equations (E5.1.1.6) and (E5.1.1.14) are related to the
Reynolds number Re = aU/ν (where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid) on the
right-hand side in the Navier–Stokes equations (1.1.12) by the formulas
Pe = Re Sc,
PeT = Re Pr.
(E5.1.2.1)
Here the Schmidt number Sc = ν/D and the Prandtl number Pr = ν/χ are dimensionless
values depending only on the physical properties of the continuous phase.
For ordinary gases, the diffusion coefﬁcient and the kinematic viscosity are of the same
order of magnitude, which corresponds to Schmidt numbers of the order of one (Sc ∼1).
For ordinary liquids like water, the kinematic viscosity is several orders of magnitude
larger than the diffusion coefﬁcient (Sc ∼103). In extremely viscous liquids like glycerin,
the Schmidt number is of the order of 106.
The range of the Prandtl number is narrower than that of the Schmidt number. In gases
such as air, Pr ∼1, and in liquids like water, Pr ∼10. In extremely viscous liquids like
glycerin, the Prandtl number is of the order of 103. Liquid metals (sodium, lithium, mercury,
etc.) are characterized by low Prandtl numbers: 5 × 10–3 ≤Pr ≤5 × 10–2.
The Reynolds number Re = aU/ν is not a physical constant of a medium and depends
on geometric and kinematic factors. Therefore, the range of variation of this number may
be arbitrary.
It follows from the considered examples and relation (E5.1.2.1) that the Peclet numbers
in problems of physicochemical hydrodynamics can vary in a wide range.
Since diffusion processes in ﬂuids are characterized by very large Schmidt numbers, we
point out that the Peclet number in convective mass transfer problems in ﬂuid media is also
large even for low Reynolds numbers at which the Stokes ﬂow law applies (for a creeping
ﬂow).
◮Local and total diffusion ﬂuxes and the Sherwood number. A local (or differential)
diffusion ﬂux of a solute to the surface is determined by
j∗= Dρ
 ∂C
∂ξ∗

ξ∗=0
(E5.1.2.2)
and in general varies along the surface.
The total (or integral) diffusion ﬂux can be obtained by integrating (E5.1.2.2) over the
entire surface S,
I∗=
ZZ
S
j∗dS.
(E5.1.2.3)
The total diffusion ﬂux I∗is the amount of substance that reacts on the entire surface
per unit time.
In mass transfer problems with the boundary conditions (E5.1.1.2) and (E5.1.1.3), one
often replaces (E5.1.2.2) and (E5.1.2.3) by the dimensionless diffusion ﬂuxes
j =

I =
I∗
aDρ (Ci – Cs) .
(E5.1.2.4)
For the diffusion regime of reaction, which corresponds to the boundary conditions

E5.1. CONVECTIVE MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER. EQUATIONS AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
825
the case of the boundary conditions (E5.1.1.2) and (E5.1.1.5), one should set Cs = 0 in
(E5.1.2.4).
The main quantity of practical interest is the mean Sherwood number
Sh = I
S ,
(E5.1.2.5)
where S = S∗/a2 is the dimensionless surface area and S∗is the corresponding dimensional
area.
The calculation of the diffusion ﬂuxes and the mean Sherwood number is usually carried
out in three steps. First, the convective mass transfer problem is solved and the concentration
ﬁeld is determined. Second, the normal derivative
 ∂C/∂ξ∗

ξ∗=0 on the surface is evaluated.
Finally, one applies formulas (E5.1.2.2)–(E5.1.2.5).
For brevity, throughout the book (where it cannot lead to a misunderstanding) we use
the terms “concentration” and “diffusion ﬂux” instead of “dimensionless concentration”
and “dimensionless diffusion ﬂux.”
E5.1.3. Mass and Heat Transfer in Turbulent Flows
◮Equation of mass and heat transfer. When mathematically describing the transfer of
a passive admixture in a turbulent ﬂow, the admixture concentration and the ﬂuid velocity
components are represented as
C = C + C′,
Vi = V i + V ′
i ,
(E5.1.3.1)
where the bar and prime denote the time-average and ﬂuctuating components, respectively.
The averages of the ﬂuctuations are zero, C′ = V ′
i = 0.
The introduction of the average and ﬂuctuating components by relations (E5.1.3.1)
followed by the application of the averaging operation made it possible, under some as-
sumptions, to obtain the following equation for the average concentration of the admixture
from Eq. (E5.1.1.1):
∂C
∂t + (V ⋅∇)C = D∆C + ∇⋅(–C′V′).
(E5.1.3.2)
Here –C′V′ is the turbulent (eddy) ﬂux of the admixture. This vector can be determined
using some closure hypothesis, based, as a rule, on empirical information.
By analogy with Boussinesq’s ideas about transfer of momentum, it is often assumed
for transfer of a substance that
–C′V′ = Dt ⋅∇C,
(E5.1.3.3)
where Dt is the turbulent diffusion tensor.
◮Turbulent Prandtl number. In a number of problems, it is important to know, as a rule,
only one component of turbulent transfer, namely, the component normal to the wall. In this
case, the turbulent diffusion strength is characterized by a single scalar quantity Dt, just as
the intensityof turbulent transfer of momentum is characterizedby a single scalar quantityνt.
The ratio of the turbulent viscosity coefﬁcient to the turbulent diffusion coefﬁcient,
Pr t = νt
Dt
,
(E5.1.3.4)
is referred to as the turbulent Prandtl (Schmidt) number.

826
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
The simplest way to close equation (E5.1.3.2) is to use the hypothesis that the turbu-
lent Prandtl number for the process examined is constant. Then it readily follows from
formula (E5.1.3.4) that the turbulent diffusion coefﬁcient is proportional to the turbulent
viscosity, Dt = νt/Prt. By using the expression for νt borrowed from the corresponding
hydrodynamic model, one can obtain the desired value of Dt. In particular, following
Prandtl’s or von K´arm´an’s model, one can use formula (1.1.21) or (1.1.22) for νt.
For a long time, it was assumed without sufﬁcient justiﬁcation that Prt = 1. With this
value of Prt, the mechanism of turbulent transfer of momentum turns out to be identical to
that of any passive scalar substance (the Reynolds analogy). According to up-to-date knowl-
edge, the Reynolds analogy can be used in some cases for rough estimation of parameters of
real ﬂows, but the scope of the predicted results is highly restricted. The turbulent Prandtl
number, as well as νt and Dt, depends on physical, geometric, and kinematic properties of
the turbulent ﬂow. For wall ﬂows, numerous experimental measurements available give the
value
Pr t ≈0.85.
(E5.1.3.5)
For jet ﬂows and mixing layers, there are various estimates for Prt ranging from 0.5 to 0.75.
These estimates are helpful for approximate calculations of turbulent heat and mass transfer
and can be used for closing equation (E5.1.3.2).
E5.2. Mass Transfer in Liquid Films
E5.2.1. Mass Exchange Between Gases and Liquid Films
◮Statement of the problem.
Dissolution of gases in ﬂowing liquid ﬁlms is one of
the most important methods for dissolving gases, which is widely used in technology.
Film absorbers with irrigated walls are used for obtaining water solutions of gases (e.g.,
absorption of HCl vapor by water), for separating gas mixtures (e.g., absorption of benzene
in the cake and by-product process), for purifying gases from detrimental efﬂuents (e.g.,
puriﬁcation of coke-oven from H2S), etc.
Let us consider the absorption of weakly soluble gases on the free surface of a liquid
ﬁlm in a laminar ﬂow on an inclined plane. It follows from the results of Section E4.3
that for moderate velocities of motion, the steady-state distribution of the velocity inside
the ﬁlm has the form of a semiparabola with maximum velocity Umax on the free surface,
which is one and a half the mean ﬂow velocity 〈V 〉:
Umax = 3
2 〈V 〉= gh2
2ν sin α.
Here g is the gravitational acceleration, α the angle between the plane and the horizon, and
h the ﬁlm thickness, given by the expression
h =
 3ν2
g
Re
1/3
,
where Re = Q/ν is the Reynolds number and Q is the irrigation density (that is, the volume
rate ﬂow of the liquid per unit width of the ﬁlm).
The liquid velocity inside the ﬁlm has a parabolic proﬁle and is given by the formula
V = Umax(1 – y2),
y = Y/h,
where the Y -axis is normal to the ﬁlm surface (Figure E4.3).

E5.2. MASS TRANSFER IN LIQUID FILMS
827
Assume that in the cross-section X = 0 the ﬂuid ﬂow contacts with a gas, so that a
constant concentration C = Cs of the absorbed component is attained on the free boundary
(Y = 0), while no solute is contained in the irrigating liquid. Furthermore, we assume that
there is no ﬂow across the wall. We restrict ourselves to the case of high Peclet numbers,
so that one can ignore the molecular diffusion along the ﬁlm.
It follows from these assumptions that the concentration distribution inside the ﬁlm is
described by the equation and the boundary conditions
(1 – y2) ∂c
∂x = 1
Pe
∂2c
∂y2 ;
(E5.2.1.1)

(E5.2.1.5)
Note that for small x ≤O(Pe–1/2), near the input section one should consider the
complete mass transfer equation with the term ∂2c/∂y2 replaced by ∆c.
◮Diffusion boundary layer approximation. For x = O(1), the concentration mostly
varies on the initial interval in a thin diffusion boundary layer near the free boundary of the
ﬁlm. In this region, we expand the transverse coordinate according to the rule
y = ζ/
√
Pe.
(E5.2.1.6)
By substituting (E5.2.1.6) into (E5.2.1.1) and by passing to the limit as Pe →∞(it is
assumed that the variables x and ζ and the corresponding derivatives are of the order of 1),
we obtain the equation
∂c
∂x = ∂2c
∂ζ2 .
(E5.2.1.7)
In view of (E5.2.1.6), the distance to the wall determined by the coordinate y = 1
corresponds to ζ =
√
Pe. Therefore, as Pe →∞, the value y = 1 in the boundary condition
(E5.2.1.4) corresponds to ζ →∞. This implies that we can rewrite the boundary conditions
(E5.2.1.2)–(E5.2.1.4) as follows:
x = 0,
c = 0;
ζ = 0,
c = 1;
ζ →∞,
∂c/∂ζ →0.

E5.2.2. Dissolution of a Plate by a Laminar Liquid Film
◮Statement of the problem. Now consider mass transfer from a solid wall to a liquid ﬁlm
at high Peclet numbers. Such a problem is of serious interest in dissolution, crystallization,
corrosion, anodic dissolution of metals in some electrochemical processes, etc. In many
practical cases, dissolution processes are rather rapid compared with diffusion. Therefore,
we assume that the concentration on the plate surface is equal to the constant Cs and the
incoming liquid is pure. As before, we introduce dimensionless variables according to
formulas (E5.2.1.5). In this case, the convective mass transfer in the liquid ﬁlm is described
by Eq. (E5.2.1.1), the boundary condition (E5.2.1.2) imposed on the longitudinal variable x,
and the following boundary conditions with respect to the transverse coordinate:
y = 0,
∂c
∂y = 0
(x > 0);
(E5.2.2.1)
y = 1,
c = 1
(x > 0).
(E5.2.2.2)
Althoughthis problem differs from the previously studied problem (E5.2.1.1)–(E5.2.1.4)
only by a rearrangement of the boundary conditions (E5.2.1.3) and (E5.2.1.4), there is a
substantial difference in the solutions of these problems.
◮Diffusion boundary layer approximation. The concentration mostly varies on the
initial interval x = O(1), that is, in the diffusion boundary layer near the ﬁlm surface. In this
region, the asymptotic solution can be obtained by substituting the expanded coordinate
ξ = (1 – y) Pe1/3
(E5.2.2.3)
intoEq. (E5.2.1.1) andbytakingthe leading term of the concentration expansion asPe →∞.
As a result, we arrive at the diffusion boundary layer equation
2ξ ∂c
∂x = ∂2c
∂ξ2 .
(E5.2.2.4)
By analogy with the already considered problem about gas absorption on the ﬁlm
surface, using (E5.2.1.2), (E5.2.2.1), and (E5.2.2.2), we obtain the boundary conditions
for Eq. (E5.2.2.4), which coincide with (E5.2.1.8) up to the replacement ξ →ζ. The
corresponding problem has the solution

j dx = 1.02 Pe1/3x2/3.
(E5.2.2.7)
By comparing formulas (E5.2.1.9)–(E5.2.1.11) with (E5.2.2.5)–(E5.2.2.7), we see that
for x ∼1 the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer near the free surface of the ﬁlm,
δ0 ∼Pe–1/2, is considerably less than that of the boundary layer near the solid surface,
δsol ∼Pe–1/3. Accordingly, the diffusion ﬂux to the free surface is larger than that to the
solid surface. Moreover, the diffusion ﬂux decreases more rapidly on the free surface than
on the solid boundary with the increase of the distance from the input cross-section. These
effects are due to the fact that the ﬂuid moves much more rapidly near the free surface than
near the solid boundary, where the no-slip condition is satisﬁed.
All facts established for a ﬂuid ﬁlm remain valid for a majority of problems on the dif-
fusion boundary layer. Namely, near a gas–ﬂuid or ﬂuid–ﬂuid interface, the dimensionless
thickness of the layer is proportional to Pe–1/2 (for the diffusion ﬂux we have j ∼Pe1/2),
and near the ﬂuid–solid interface the thickness of the boundary layer is proportional to
Pe–1/3 (the diffusion ﬂux is j ∼Pe1/3).
◮Exact solution. The exact solution of the problem for equation (E5.2.1.1) with condi-
tions (E5.2.1.2), (E5.2.2.1), and (E5.2.2.2) in the entire region 0 ≤x < ∞can be represented

where the eigenfunctions Hm(y) are given in (E5.2.2.8). To compute the coefﬁcients Am,

where the λm are given in (E5.2.2.10). The maximum error of (E5.2.2.11) is less than 0.1%.
The total diffusion ﬂux on the ﬁlm surface is given by (E5.2.1.15) with (dHm/dy)y=0

E5.3. Heat Transfer to a Flat Plate
E5.3.1. Heat Transfer in Laminar Flow
◮Statement of the problem. Thermal boundary layer. Consider heat transfer to a ﬂat
plate in a longitudinal translational ﬂow of a viscous incompressible ﬂuid with velocity Ui at
high Reynolds numbers. We assume that the temperature on the plate surface and far from
it is equal to the constants Ts and Ti, respectively. The origin of the rectangular coordinates
X, Y is at the front edge of the plate, the X-axis is tangent to the plate, and the Y -axis is
normal to it.
Numerous experiments and numerical calculations show that the laminar hydrodynamic
boundary layer occurs for 5× 102 ≤ReX ≤5× 105 to 106. In this region, the thermal Peclet
number PeX = Pr ReX is large for gases and common liquids. For liquid metals, there is
a range of Reynolds numbers, 104 ≤ReX ≤106, where the Peclet numbers are also large.
Taking into account the previous discussion, we restrict ourselves to the case of high
Peclet numbers, for which the longitudinal molecular heat transfer may be neglected. The
corresponding thermal boundary layer equations and the boundary conditions have the form
vx
∂T
∂x + vy

∂y = 1

x = 0,
T = 0;
y = 0,
T = 1;
y →∞,
T →0.
(E5.3.1.1)
Here the dimensionless variables are introduced by formulas (E5.1.1.13) with characteristic
length a = ν/Ui and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the ﬂuid.
The ﬂuid velocity in (E5.3.1.1) is given by the Blasius solution
vx = f ′(η),
vy = ηf ′ – f
2√x ,
where
η =
y
√x .
(E5.3.1.2)
The function f = f(η) was previously described in Section E4.5.1, and the prime stands for
the derivative with respect to η.
◮Temperature ﬁeld. The solution of problem (E5.3.1.1) in conjunction with relations
(E5.3.1.2) will be sought in the self-similar form T = T(η). As a result, we obtain the
ordinary differential equation

dη = 0;
η = 0,
T = 1;
η →∞,
T →0.
(E5.3.1.3)
By taking into account the relation f = –f ′′′/f ′′, which follows from the equation for f,
we can write out the solution of problem (E5.3.1.3) as follows:
T =

(E5.3.1.4)
For Pr = 1, this formula implies the simple relation T(η) = 1 – f ′(η) = 1 – vx between
temperature and the longitudinal velocity.

832
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
◮Heat ﬂux and the Nusselt number. By differentiating (E5.3.1.4) and by using the
numerical value f ′′(0) = 0.332, we obtain the dimensionless local heat ﬂux to the plate
surface:

where
ϕ(Pr) =

(E5.3.1.5)
It is convenient to seek the asymptotics of the function ϕ(Pr) at low and high Prandtl
numbers starting from Eq. (E5.3.1.3) with the extended variable η = ζ/Pr. As a result, we
obtain the equation T ′′
ζζ + f(ζ/Pr)T ′
ζ = 0. As Pr →0, the argument of the function f(ζ/Pr)
tends to inﬁnity, which corresponds to a constant velocity inside the thermal boundary layer
and f(η) ≈η. In the other limit case as Pr →∞, the argument of the function f(ζ/Pr)
tends to zero, which corresponds to the linear approximation of the velocity inside the
boundary layer and f(η) ≈0.166 η2. By substituting the above-mentioned leading terms
of the asymptotic expansion of f into Eq. (E5.3.1.3) and by solving the corresponding
problems, we obtain the following expressions for the heat ﬂux (E5.3.1.5):
ϕ(Pr) →
 Pr/π
1/2
ϕ(Pr) →0.339 Pr1/3
(Pr →0),
(Pr →∞).
(E5.3.1.6)
Both considered limit situations occur in numerous problems of convective heat transfer.
In the case Pr →0, which approximately takes place for liquid metals (e.g., mercury), one
can neglect the dynamic boundary layer in the calculation of the temperature boundary
layer and replace the velocity proﬁle v(x, y) by the velocity v∞(x) of the inviscid outer
ﬂow. As Pr →∞, which corresponds to the case of strongly viscous ﬂuids (e.g., glycerin),
the temperature boundary layer is very thin and lies inside the dynamic boundary layer,
where the velocity increases linearly with distance from the plate surface.
In the entire range of the Prandtl number, the function ϕ(Pr) in formula (E5.3.1.5) is
well approximated by the expression
ϕ(Pr) = 0.0817

(1 + 72 Pr)2/3 – 1

whose maximum error is about 0.5%.

E5.3.2. Heat Transfer in Turbulent Flow
◮Temperature proﬁle. Let us discuss qualitative speciﬁc features of convective heat
and mass transfer in turbulent ﬂow past a ﬂat plate. Experimental evidence indicates that
several characteristic regions with different temperature proﬁles can be distinguished in the
thermal boundary layer on a ﬂat plate. At moderate Prandtl numbers (0.5 ≤Pr ≤2.0), it
can be assumed for rough estimates that the characteristic sizes of these regions are of the
same order of magnitude as those of the wall layer and the core of the turbulent stream, see
Section E4.5.2.

E5.3. HEAT TRANSFER TO A FLAT PLATE
833
For the description of heat and mass transfer in the wall layer, it is common to introduce
the friction velocity U∗, friction temperature Θ∗, and dimensionless internal coordinate y+
by the relations
U∗=
r τs
ρ ,
Θ∗=
qs
ρcpU∗
,
y+ = Y U∗
ν
,
(E5.3.1.9)
where τs is the shear stress at the wall, ρ the ﬂuid density, qs the heat ﬂux at the wall, cp the
speciﬁc heat of the ﬂuid, ν the kinematic viscosity, and Y the distance to the plate surface.
In the molecular thermal conduction layer, adjacent to the plate surface, the deviation of
the average temperature T from the wall temperature Ts depends linearly on the transverse
coordinate:
Ts – T(Y )
Θ∗
= Pr y+.
(E5.3.1.10)
For Pr > 1, the linear law (E5.3.1.10) is satisﬁed for 0 ≤y+ ≤9 Pr–1/3.
In the logarithmic layer, the average temperature can be determined with the use of the
relations*
Ts – T(Y )
Θ∗
= 2.12 ln y+ + β(Pr),
β(Pr) = (3.85 Pr1/3 – 1.3)2 + 2.12 ln Pr.
(E5.3.1.11)
These formulas are valid within a wide range of Prandtl numbers, 6 × 10–3 ≤Pr ≤104, for
y+ ≥y+
log. The lower bound of the logarithmic layer, y+
log, depends on the Prandtl number
as follows:
y+
log ≃



12 Pr–1/3
if Pr ≫1
(for liquids),
30
if Pr ∼1
(for gases),
2/Pr
if Pr ≪1
(for liquid metals).
In the stream core and a major part of the logarithmic layer, the average temperature
proﬁle can be described by the single formula
T(Y ) – T m
Θ∗
= –2.12 ln η + 1.5 (1 – η),
(E5.3.1.12)
where T m is the average temperature at the stream axis, η = Y/δT the dimensionless distance
to the plate surface, and δT the thermal boundary layer thickness. The results predicted by
Eq. (E5.3.1.12) fairly well agree with experimental data provided by various authors for
turbulent ﬂows of air, water, and transformer oil for 10–2 < Y/δT < 1.
The thermal boundary layer thickness can be estimated from the relation
δT (X) = 0.45 X
q
1
2 cf,
(E5.3.1.13)
where cf is the local friction coefﬁcient determined by formula (E4.5.2.2) or (E4.5.2.3). The
empirical coefﬁcient 0.45 was obtained by processing experimental data for 0.7 ≤Pr ≤64.
It is greater than the similar coefﬁcient in relation (E4.5.2.1) for the hydrodynamic turbulent
boundary layer thickness. (Qualitatively, this is accounted for by the fact that the turbulent
Prandtl number is less than unity; that is, the hydrodynamic boundary layer lies within the
thermal boundary layer.)
* The universal constant 2.12 multiplying the logarithm is deﬁned as Prt/κ, where Prt = 0.85 is the turbulent
Prandtl number for wall ﬂows and κ = 0.4 the von K´arm´an constant.

834

◮Nusselt number. For determining the local Nusselt number, it is recommended to use
the Kader–Yaglom formula

2.12 ln( 1
2 cf Pr ReX) + (3.85 Pr1/3 – 1.3)2 + 1.5

(E5.3.1.14)
which quite well agrees with numerous experimental data within a wide range of Prandtl
numbers (0.5 ≤Pr ≤100).
For rough estimates, the simpler formula
NuX = 0.0288 Pr0.4Re0.8
X
can be used, which is valid for 0.5 ≤Pr ≤50.
More detailed information about heat and mass transfer in turbulent ﬂows past a ﬂat
plate, as well as various relations for determining the temperature proﬁle and Nusselt
(Sherwood) numbers, and a lot of other useful information can be found in the references

E5.4. Convective Heat and Mass Transfer in Tubes and
Channels
Many convective mass and heat transfer processes in chemical industry, petroleum chem-
istry, gas, nuclear, and other branches of industry occur in pipes (water, gas, and oil pipelines,
heat exchangers, etc.).
Starting from the classical works by Graetz (1883) and Nusselt (1910), many authors
considered the problem about the temperature distribution in a ﬂuid moving in a tube under
various assumptions on the type of ﬂow, the tube shape, the form of boundary conditions,
the value of the Peclet number, and some other simpliﬁcations. In this section, we outline
the most important results obtained in this ﬁeld.
E5.4.1. Heat and Mass Transfer in a Circular Tube with Constant
Temperature of the Wall for Laminar Flows
◮Statement of the problem. Consider a laminar steady-state ﬂuid ﬂow in a circular tube
of radius a with Poiseuille velocity proﬁle (see Section E4.4.1). We introduce cylindrical
coordinates R, Z with the Z-axis in the ﬂow direction. We assume that for Z > 0 the
temperature on the wall is equal to the constant T2. In the entry area Z < 0, the temperature
on the wall is also constant but takes another value T1.
The convective heat transfer in a tube is described by the equation
PeT (1 – ̺2) ∂T
∂z = ∂2T
∂̺2 + 1

∂̺ + ∂2T

The following dimensionless variables have been used:
̺ = R

T = T∗– T1

PeT = aUmax
χ
,
where T∗is the ﬂuid temperature, χ the thermal diffusivity, Umax = a2∆P/(4µL) the
maximum velocity at the center of the tube, ∆P the pressure increment along the distance L,
and µ the dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid.
◮High Peclet numbers (initial region). As PeT →∞, the ﬂuid temperature in the
region z < 0 is constant and equal to the temperature T ≈0 on the wall. In the region z > 0
at z = O(1), a thin boundary layer is being formed near the wall of the tube. In this region,
on the left-hand side of Eq. (E5.4.1.1) one may retain only the leading term of the velocity
expansion as ̺ →1 and write v = 1 – ̺2 ≈2ξ, where ξ = 1 – ̺. Moreover, in contrast
with the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side in (E5.4.1.1), one can neglect the last two terms;
that is, ∆T ≈∂2T/∂ξ2. Thus, we arrive at an equation that coincides with (E5.2.2.4) up to
notation. Taking into account the boundary conditions (E5.4.1.2), we obtain the temperature
distribution in the boundary layer,

The scope of formulas (E5.4.1.4)–(E5.4.1.6) is bounded by the condition z ≪PeT . This
restrictionpracticallyalways holds in the similar problem about the diffusion boundarylayer.
◮Arbitrary Peclet numbers.
In the general case 0 ≤PeT < ∞, we seek the ﬂuid
temperature distribution separately on both sides of the inlet cross-section of the tube in the
form of series:

into Eq. (E5.4.1.1) and the boundary conditions (E5.4.1.2) and (E5.4.1.3).
The temperature T = T(̺, z) and its derivative must be continuous across the section

The consistency conditions (E5.4.1.9) allow one to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients Am and Bk in the
series (E5.4.1.7) and (E5.4.1.8).
In what follows, we give the results of the analysis of this problem only for the region
z > 0.
The eigenfunctions fm(ρ) are expressed via the degenerate hypergeometric function

with the function f(ρ) = f(ρ; λ) determined by relations (E5.4.1.10) where the indices m

Consider the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues λm and coefﬁcients Am in some
limit cases.
As PeT →0, we have

Am = –

(E5.4.1.13)
where J0 = J0(ξ) and J1 = J1(ξ) are the Bessel functions and the γm are the roots of J0,
J0(γm) = 0.
It is convenient to calculate approximate values of γm by using the approximate expres-
sion
γm = 2.4 + 3.13 m
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ),
(E5.4.1.14)
whose maximum error is less than 0.2%.
As Pe →∞, the asymptotics of the eigenvalues λm for large m has the form
λm = 4m + 8
3 .
(E5.4.1.15)
This formula constructed under the assumption that m ≫1 can be used for all m. The
maximum error in (E5.4.1.15) is attained at m = 0 and is equal to 1.4%.
Instead of (E5.4.1.15), it is convenient to use the more precise formula
λm = 4m + 2.7
(m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ),
(E5.4.1.16)
whose maximum error is 0.3%.
The coefﬁcients Am of the series (E5.4.1.7) can be calculated by the formula
Am = 2.85 (–1)mλ–2/3

,
(E5.4.1.17)
whose maximum error is 0.5%.
For large but ﬁnite Peclet numbers, the expressions (E5.4.1.16) and (E5.4.1.17) can be
used only for a bounded set of eigenvalues such that λm ≪PeT .
The dependence of the ground eigenvalue λ0 on the Peclet number is nicely approxi-
mated by the formula
λ0 = 2.7

(E5.4.1.20)
Here 1 – 〈T〉is the temperature head equal to the difference between the wall temperature
and the mean ﬂow rate temperature.
It follows from (E5.4.1.18)–(E5.4.1.20) that at large distances from the inlet cross-

by the formula
Nu∞= 4.16 + 1.15 PeT
1 + 0.315 PeT
,
(E5.4.1.28)
whose maximum error is about 0.6%.
Calculations according to (E5.4.1.20) show that for high Peclet numbers one can con-
ventionally divide the entire length of a heated (cooled) tube into two parts. On the ﬁrst
part, a temperature proﬁle is formed with radial temperature distribution varying from the
initial value (at z = 0) to some limit value f0(̺). In this region, the number Nu decreases
near the inlet cross-section as a power-law function Nu ≈2jT , where jT is described by
(E5.4.1.5). On the second part of the tube, the radial distribution of the excess temperature
δT = 1–T does not vary along the tube (though the absolute values of temperature do vary),
and the number Nu preserves the constant value 3.66. The ﬁrst part of the tube is called the
thermal initial region, and the second one, the region of steady-state heat exchange.
It is conventional to deﬁne the length of the thermal initial region as the distance from
the inlet cross-section to the point at which the Nusselt number differs from its limit value
(E5.4.1.23) by 1%. Calculations show that the dimensional length of the thermal initial
region is l = 0.11a PeT .
E5.4.2. Heat and Mass Transfer in a Circular Tube with Constant
Heat Flux at the Wall for Laminar Flows
◮Statement of the problem. Now let us study the case in which a constant heat ﬂux
q = κ(∂T/∂R)R=a = const, where κ is the thermal conductivity coefﬁcient of the ﬂuid, is
given on the surface of a circular tube for Z > 0. The entry part is modeled by the region
Z < 0, where there is no heat ﬂux across the tube surface and the temperature tends to the
constant value T1 as Z →–∞.
In this case, it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless temperature as
eT = κ(T – T1)
aq
,
(E5.4.2.1)
and the other dimensionless variables are determined in the same way as in problem
(E5.4.1.1)–(E5.4.1.3).
The considered heat transfer process is described by Eq. (E5.4.1.1) with T replaced by

Obviously, Nu∞is independent of the Peclet number.
◮Temperature ﬁeld in the initial region of the tube. For z < 0, we seek the solution of
the complete problem (E5.4.1.1), (E5.4.2.2), (E5.4.2.3) in the form of the series (E5.4.1.8)
(with T replaced by eT). For z > 0, the temperature ﬁeld is constructed on the basis of the

By substituting these series into (E5.4.1.1), (E5.4.2.2), and (E5.4.2.3) and by separating the
variables, we obtain spectral problems for the eigenfunctions fm and gk and the eigenvalues
λm and ηk.
The solution of the problem for fm is given by (E5.4.1.10), where the numbers λm
satisfy the transcendental equation
Φ(am, 1; λm) = 2amΦ(am + 1, 2; λm).
The coefﬁcients of the expansions Am and Bm are determined by the condition that the
temperature and its derivative are continuous across the section z = 0 (E5.4.1.9).
If we determine the length l of the thermal initial region on the basis of the formula
Nu = 1.01 Nu∞, then we obtain l = 0.14 Pea.

exchange in a laminar ﬂuid ﬂow with parabolic velocity proﬁle in a plane channel of
width 2h. Let us introduce rectangular coordinates X, Y with the X-axis codirected with
the ﬂow and lying at equal distances from the channel walls. We assume that the temperature
on the walls (at Y = ±h) is constant and is equal to T1 for X < 0 and to T2 for X > 0. Since
the problem is symmetric with respect to the X-axis, it sufﬁces to consider half of the ﬂow
region, 0 ≤Y ≤h.
The temperature distribution T∗is described by the following equation and boundary
conditions:

By analogy with the case of a circular tube, we seek the solution of problem (E5.4.3.1)–

The coefﬁcients Am are calculated by the formula (E5.4.1.12) with ̺ replaced by y,

into formulas (E5.2.2.8) and (E5.2.2.9), respectively).

E5.4. CONVECTIVE HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER IN TUBES AND CHANNELS

Let us substitute formulas (E5.4.3.4), (E5.4.3.9), and (E5.4.1.19) into (E5.4.1.20), and
let x tend to inﬁnity. As a result, we obtain the limit Nusselt number

(E5.4.3.10)
The eigenfunction f0(y) = cos(πy/2) follows from (E5.4.3.8) for low Peclet numbers.
By applying (E5.4.3.10), we obtain
Nu∞= π4

(as PeT →0).
(E5.4.3.11)
For high Peclet numbers, the limit Nusselt number is
Nu∞= 4

(as PeT →∞).
(E5.4.3.12)
Over the entire range of Peclet numbers, Nu∞is nicely approximated by the formula
Nu∞= 4.06 + 3.66 PeT
1 + 0.97 PeT
,
(E5.4.3.13)
whose maximum error is about 0.5%.
◮Plane channel with constant heat ﬂux at the wall. Now consider the case in which
a constant heat ﬂux q is given on the walls of a plane channel for X > 0. We assume that
for X < 0 the walls are thermally insulated and the temperature tends to a constant T1 as
X →–∞.
For a ≡h, we introduce the dimensionless temperature eT according to (E5.4.2.1). The
heat exchange in a plane channel is described by Eq. (E5.4.3.1) (as T →eT) and the boundary
conditions (E5.4.2.2), (E5.4.2.3), where z and ̺ are replaced by x and y, respectively.

From the temperature distribution (E5.4.3.14) far from the input cross-section, one can
ﬁnd the limit Nusselt number
Nu∞= 4.12.
E5.4.4. Turbulent Heat Transfer in Circular Tube and Plane Channel
◮Temperature proﬁle. Let us discuss qualitative speciﬁc features of convective heat
and mass transfer in a turbulent ﬂow through a circular tube and plane channel in the
stabilized ﬂow region. Experimental evidence indicates that several characteristic regions
with different temperature proﬁles can be distinguished.
At moderate Prandtl numbers
(0.5 ≤Pr ≤2.0), the structure and sizes of these regions are similar to those of the wall layer
and the core of the turbulent stream considered in Section E4.4.2.
In the molecular thermal conduction layer, adjacent to the tube wall, the deviation
of the average temperature T from the wall temperature Ts satisﬁes the linear depen-
dence (E5.3.1.10). In the logarithmic layer, the average temperature can be estimated using

842
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
relations (E5.3.1.11), which are valid for liquids, gases, and liquid metals within a wide
range of Prandtl numbers, 6 × 10–3 ≤Pr ≤104.
In the stream core and a major part of the logarithmic layer, the average temperature
proﬁle can be described by the single formula
T(Y ) – T m
Θ∗
= –2.12 ln η + 0.3 (1 – η2),
(E5.4.4.1)
where T m is the average temperature at the stream axis, η = Y/a the dimensionless distance
to the tube wall, and a the tube radius. The results predicted by Eq. (E5.4.4.1) fairly well
agree with experimental data provided by various authors for turbulent ﬂows of water, air,
and liquid metals through circular tubes and plane channels for 3 × 10–2 < Y/a < 1.
◮Nusselt number for the thermal stabilized region. In the thermal stabilization region
of a turbulent ﬂow through a smooth tube, for computing the limiting Nusselt number one
can use the formula
Nu∞=
Pr Redξ
2.12 ln(Pr Redξ) + (3.85 Pr1/3 – 1.3)2 – 4.3 + 6.7 ξ
.

where α is the heat transfer coefﬁcient, d = 2a the tube diameter, cp the speciﬁc heat at
constant pressure, ρ the ﬂuid density, χ the thermal diffusivity, qs the heat ﬂux at the wall,
ν the kinematic viscosity, and 〈V 〉the mean ﬂow rate velocity. The drag coefﬁcient λ can
be found from Eq. (E4.4.2.12) or (E4.4.2.13). Formula (E5.4.4.2) uniﬁes the results of
more than ﬁfty experimental studies and applies to liquids and gases within wide ranges of
Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, 5 × 103 ≤Red ≤2 × 106 and 0.6 ≤Pr ≤4 × 104. In the case
of mass exchange, the Nusselt number must be replaced by the Sherwood number and the
thermal Prandtl number, by the diffusion one.
In engineering calculations, the Nusselt number is often determined from simple two-
term (or one-term) formulas like
Nu∞= A + BPrnRem
d
(E5.4.4.3)
valid in a limited range of Prandtl and Reynolds numbers. For liquid metals, in the case of
104 < Red < 106 and constant temperature or heat ﬂux at the wall, in Eq. (E5.4.4.3) one
should set
A = 5,
B = 0.025,
n = m = 0.8
(if Ts = const),
A = 6.8,
B = 0.044,
n = m = 0.75
(if qs = const).
(E5.4.4.4)
◮Intermediate domain and the entry region of the tube. In the intermediate domain
(2200 ≤Red ≤4000) at moderate Prandtl numbers, the Nusselt number can be estimated
using the formula
Nu = 3 × 10–4Pr0.35Re1.5
d
(for 0.5 ≤Pr ≤5).

E5.4. CONVECTIVE HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER IN TUBES AND CHANNELS
843
For the entryregionof the tube inthe case of simultaneous development of hydrodynamic
and thermal boundary layers, the local Nusselt number Nu = Nu(X) at constant temperature

where Ui is the inlet velocity and α = α(X) the local heat transfer coefﬁcient (based on

region, whose length xL is estimated as xL = 1.3 Re0.25.
More detailed information about heat and mass transfer in turbulent ﬂows through a
circular tube or plane channel, as well as various relations for determining the temperature
proﬁle and Nusselt (Sherwood) numbers, and other useful information can be found in the
references given at the end of this chapter.
E5.4.5. Limit Nusselt Numbers for Tubes of Various Cross-Sections
◮Laminar ﬂows. Below we give some results for the limit Nusselt numbers correspond-
ing to the heat stabilization region for fully developed laminar ﬂow of ﬂuids in tubes of
various cross-sections in the case of high Peclet numbers.
Let us introduce the equivalent (or “hydraulic”) diameter de by the formula
de = 4S∗
P ,
(E5.4.5.1)
where S∗is the tube cross-section area and P is the cross-section perimeter. For tubes of
circular cross-section, de coincides with the diameter, and for a plane channel, de is twice
the height of the channel.
Consider a tube of arbitrary shape and denote the contour of the cross-section by Γ.
Generally speaking, the Nusselt number varies along the contour Γ. We deﬁne the perimeter-
average Nusselt number Nu as follows:
Nu =
qs
Ts – 〈T∗〉m
de
κ .
(E5.4.5.2)
Here Ts is the temperature on the wall of the tube, 〈T∗〉m is the mean ﬂow rate temperature

Table E5.2 presents the perimeter-average Nusselt numbers for tubes with various cross-
section shapes.
At constant temperature on the wall of a tube of rectangular cross-section with sides a
and b, the value Nu∞for a ≥b is nicely approximated by the formula
Nu∞= 7.5 – 17.5 ǫ + 23 ǫ2 – 10 ǫ3,
ǫ = b/a,
(E5.4.5.5)
whose maximum error is 3%.
At constant temperature on the wall of a tube whose cross-section is a regular N-gon,
the limit Nusselt number is given by the approximate formula
Nu∞= 3.65 – 0.18 N –1 – 10 N –2.
(E5.4.5.6)
The comparison with Table E5.2 shows that the maximum error in (E5.4.5.6) is less
than 0.5% at N = 3, 4, 6, ∞.
◮Turbulent ﬂows. The strength of heat transfer in turbulent ﬂows of ﬂuids through
tubes of noncircular cross-section can be estimated using relations (E5.4.4.2)–(E5.4.4.4)
suggested for circular tubes. In this case, the characteristic length on which the Nusselt
numbers Nu∞are based is taken to be the equivalent diameter, de, deﬁned by Eq. (E5.4.5.1).

E5.5. INTERIOR HEAT PROBLEMS FOR SOLID BODIES OF VARIOUS SHAPES
845
The quantity P in this formula is the wettable perimeter, regardless of what part of the
perimeter exchanges heat with the ﬂuid.
Detailed information about heat transfer in turbulent ﬂows in tubes and channels, as
well as various relations for determining the mean ﬂow rate temperature and the Nusselt
number, can be found in the references given at the end of this chapter.
E5.5. Interior Heat Problems for Solid Bodies of Various
Shapes
E5.5.1. Statement of the Problem
Consider a class of problems concerning transient heat exchange between convex solid
bodies (or a cavity ﬁlled with a quiescent ﬂuid) of various shapes and the environment. At
the initial time t = 0, the temperature is the same throughout the body and is equal to Ti,
and for t > 0, the temperature on the surface Γ of the body is maintained constant and is
equal to Ts. The temperature distribution inside the body is described by the heat equation
∂T
∂¯τ = ∆T,
(E5.5.1.1)
the initial condition
T = 0
at
¯τ = 0,
(E5.5.1.2)
and the boundary condition

on Γ.
(E5.5.1.3)
The dimensionless variables are introduced according to formulas (E5.1.1.13), where the
characteristic length can be taken arbitrarily.
The problem of transient diffusion into a cavity ﬁlled with a quiescent medium can be
stated in a similar manner.

E5.5.2. Bulk Temperature for Bodies of Various Shapes
◮Bulk temperature for a sphere, a parallelepiped, and a cylinder of ﬁnite length.
First, consider the simplest one-dimensional (with respect to spatial coordinates) heat

Note that to compute the roots of this transcendental equation one can use the approximate
formula
ϑk = 2.4 + 3.13 (k – 1)
(k = 1, 2, . . . )
with a maximum error of 0.2%.
◮Bulk temperature for a bounded body of arbitrary shape. For a bounded body of
arbitrary shape, the solution of problem (E5.5.1.1)–(E5.5.1.3) tends as ¯τ →∞to the limit
value (equal to 1) determined by the boundary condition on the surface of the body. By
setting T = 1 in (E5.5.1.4), we ﬁnd the asymptotics of bulk temperature for large ¯τ:
〈T〉→1

¯τ →∞.

One can show that the bulk temperature of a bounded body of arbitrary shape has the

Formula (E5.5.2.6) gives the correct asymptotics (E5.5.2.4) and (E5.5.2.5) for small
and large times and is exact for a spherical particle. (Formula (E5.5.2.6) for S∗= 4πa and
V∗= 4
3 πa3 coincides with (E5.5.2.1).)

E5.6. MASS AND HEAT EXCHANGE BETWEEN PARTICLES AND QUIESCENT MEDIUM
847
The approximation (E5.5.2.6) is compared with the exact bulk temperature (E5.5.2.2)
for the parallelepiped in view of the relations S∗= 2(L1L2+L1L3+L2L3) and V∗= L1L2L3.
The maximum error of formula (E5.5.2.6) is about 5% for 0.25≤L3/L1 ≤4.0 and L2/L1 = 1.
The exact value (E5.5.2.3) is compared with the approximation (E5.5.2.6), where S∗=
2πa(a + L) and V∗= πa2L, for various ratios of the cylinder dimensions. The maximum
error in formula (E5.5.2.6) is about 3.5% for 0.25 ≤2a/L ≤4.0.
For practical calculations, it is expedient to replace the inﬁnite series (E5.5.2.6) by the
simpler formula

E5.6. Mass and Heat Exchange Between Particles
of Various Shapes and a Quiescent Medium
E5.6.1. Stationary Mass and Heat Exchange
◮Statement of the problem. Consider stationary diffusion to a particle of ﬁnite size in a
quiescent medium, which corresponds to the case Pe = 0. We assume that the concentration
on the surface of the particle and far from it is constant and equal to Cs and Ci, respectively.
The concentration ﬁeld outside the particle is described by the Laplace equation
∆c = 0
(E5.6.1.1)
and the boundary conditions
c = 1
on the surface Γ of the particle,
(E5.6.1.2)
c = 0
remote from the particle,
(E5.6.1.3)
where c = Ci – C
Ci – Cs
is the dimensionless concentration.
The unknown quantity of most practical interest in these problems is the mean Sherwood
number, which is determined by (E5.1.2.5) and is related to the mass transfer coefﬁcient αc
by
Sh = aαc
D ,
(E5.6.1.4)
where a is the characteristic length.
From the mathematical viewpoint, the diffusion problem (E5.6.1.1)–(E5.6.1.3) is equiv-
alent to the problem on the electric ﬁeld of a charged conductive body in a homogeneous
charge-free dielectric medium. Therefore, the mean Sherwood number in a quiescent ﬂuid
coincides with the dimensionless electrostatic capacitance of the body and can be calculated
or measured by methods of electrostatics.
◮Shape factor. In what follows, it is convenient to introduce a shape factor Π, which has
the dimension of length, as follows:
Π = αcS∗
D
= Sh S∗
a ,
(E5.6.1.5)
where S∗is the dimensional surface area of the particle. Note that sometimes Π is referred
to as “conductance.”

Table E5.3 shows the values of Π for particles of various shape.
It follows from
(E5.6.1.5) that the mean Sherwood number can be obtained from the data in this table by
dividing the shape factor by the surface area of the particle and then by multiplying by the
characteristic length.
One can interpret the table data as follows. Let us project a body of revolution onto a
plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The projection is a disk of radius ap. The sphere
of radius ap is called a perimeter-equivalent sphere. We introduce the perimeter-equivalent
factor
Σ =
S∗
4πa2p

surface area of particle
surface area of perimeter-equivalent sphere
(E5.6.1.6)
and consider the corresponding shape factor ratio
eΠ =
Π
4πap
=

shape factor of the perimeter-equivalent sphere .
(E5.6.1.7)
The dimensionless variables (E5.6.1.6) and (E5.6.1.7) are invariant with respect to the
choice of the characteristic length. The dependence of eΠ on Σ for particles of various
geometric shapes is fairly well approximated by the formula
eΠ = 0.637 + 0.327 (2Σ – 1)0.76
(0.5 ≤Σ ≤8.5).
(E5.6.1.8)

E5.6. MASS AND HEAT EXCHANGE BETWEEN PARTICLES AND QUIESCENT MEDIUM
849
It is expedient to use this approximate formula for the analysis of mass exchange
between particles of complicated shape and a quiescent medium if the solution of problem
(E5.6.1.1)–(E5.6.1.3) is unknown.
To calculate the particle shape factor, it is also convenient to use the simple approximate
formula
Π = 5.25 S1/4
∗
V 1/6
∗
,
(E5.6.1.9)
where S∗is the surface area and V∗the volume of the particle.
For spheres and cubes, the error in formula (E5.6.1.9) is at most 0.13%. For circular
cylinders of radius a and length L = a, L = 2a, or L = 3a, the error in formula (E5.6.1.9) is
respectively 1.1%, 0.6%, and 2.1%.
It is useful to rewrite formula (E5.6.1.9) as follows:
Π =
p
S∗f(ξ),
f(ξ) = As
p
ξ,
As = 2√π ≈3.545,
where ξ is a dimensionless geometric parameter,
ξ = λ V 1/3
∗
S1/3
∗
,
λ = (36π)1/6 ≈2.199.
The parameter ξ characterizes the particle shape and ranges in the interval 0 ≤ξ ≤1.
The value ξ = 1 corresponds to a spherical particle. Formula (E5.6.1.9) gives good results
for weakly and moderately deformed convex particles with 0.88 ≤ξ ≤1.0. (For example,
this condition is satisﬁed for cubic particles, regular polyhedra, and circular cylinders of
radius a and length L with a ≤L ≤3a.)
Let us write out some lower and upper bounds for the shape factor. The lower bound for
an arbitrary particle is determined by the shape factor of the sphere of the same volume V∗:
Π ≥(48π2V∗)1/3.
(E5.6.1.10)
Another lower bound has the form
Π ≥8(Smax/π)1/2,
where Smax is the maximum projected area of the particle. The last formula becomes an
equality for a disk. An upper bound is given by the shape factor of any surface (say, a
sphere or an ellipsoid of revolution) surrounding the particle.
E5.6.2. Transient Mass and Heat Exchange
Suppose that at the initial time t = 0 the concentration in the continuous medium is constant
and is equal to Ci and that a constant surface concentration Cs is maintained for t > 0. The
transient mass exchange between a particle and a quiescent medium is described by the
equation
∂c
∂τ = ∆c
(E5.6.2.1)
with the boundary conditions (E5.6.1.2) and (E5.6.1.3) and the initial condition
τ = 0,
c = 0,
(E5.6.2.2)
where τ = tD/a2 is dimensionless time.

MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
For a spherical particle, the solution of problem (E5.6.2.1), (E5.6.2.2), (E5.6.1.2),

The mean Sherwood number for a sphere is

For nonspherical particles, the mean Sherwood number can be approximated by the
expression

(E5.6.2.5)
where Shst is the Sherwood number corresponding to the solution of the stationary prob-
lem (E5.6.1.1)–(E5.6.1.3). In (E5.6.2.5), Sh, Shst, and τ are assumed to be reduced to
dimensionless form by using the same characteristic length.
For nonspherical particles, one can obtain Shst by using Table E5.3 and the expres-
sion (E5.6.1.8).

E5.7.2. Mass Transfer at Low Reynolds Numbers and Various Peclet
Numbers
For a solid spherical particle in a translational Stokes ﬂow (low Reynolds numbers, Re →0)
the ﬂuid velocity components VR and Vθ in Eq. (E5.7.1.4) are determined by formulas
(E4.6.2.4).
◮Low Peclet numbers. For Pe = 0, which corresponds to a particle in a quiescent ﬂuid,
the exact solution of the problem (E5.7.1.1)–(E5.7.1.3) has the form
c = 1
r .
(E5.7.2.1)
The corresponding mean Sherwood number is equal to unity,
Sh = 1
(Pe = 0).
(E5.7.2.2)
The three-term expansion of the mean Sherwood number as Pe →0 has the form
Sh = 1 + 1
2 Pe + 1
2 Pe2 ln Pe,
(E5.7.2.3)
whose error is of the order of Pe2. The asymptotic formula (E5.7.2.3) with the last term
omitted gives a good approximation to the Sherwood number for Pe < 0.4.
◮High Peclet numbers (the diffusion boundary layer). For high Peclet numbers, a
thin diffusion boundary layer is formed near the surface of the sphere. The ratio of the
thickness of this layer to the particle radius is of the order of Pe–1/3. In this region, the
radial component of molecular diffusion to the particle surface is essential, and tangential
diffusion may be neglected. Convective mass transfer due to the motion of the ﬂuid should
also be taken into account.
The concentration distribution in the diffusion boundary layer can be expressed as
follows via the incomplete gamma function:

where the angle θ is counted off as shown in Figure E4.4.
By differentiating equation (E5.7.2.4), we obtain the dimensionless local diffusion ﬂux
to the surface of the sphere in the form

(E5.7.2.5)
One can see that the local diffusion ﬂux attains its maximum at the front stagnation
point on the surface of the sphere (at θ = π) and monotonically decreases with the angular
coordinate to the minimum value, which is zero and is attained at θ = 0.
The corresponding mean Sherwood number is determined by Levich’s formula
Sh = 0.625 Pe1/3
(Pe →∞).
(E5.7.2.6)
Let us also present the two-term expansion for the mean Sherwood number,
Sh = 0.625 Pe1/3 + 0.461
(Pe →∞).
(E5.7.2.7)
which reﬁnes formula (E5.7.2.6). Formula (E5.7.2.7) can be used for practical calculations
if Pe ≥10.

852
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
◮Arbitrary Peclet numbers. The mean Sherwood number for a solid spherical particle
in a translational Stokes ﬂow in the entire range of Peclet numbers can be computed with
the use of the Clift–Grace–Weber approximate formula
Sh = 0.5 + (0.125 + 0.243 Pe)1/3.
(E5.7.2.8)
The interpolation formula (E5.7.2.8) gives exact asymptotic results both as Pe →0
(E5.7.2.2) and as Pe →∞(E5.7.2.6). The maximum error of formula (E5.7.2.8) in the
entire range of Peclet numbers is about 2%. (Comparison was made with available results
of ﬁnite-difference numerical solutions of problem (E5.7.1.1)–(E5.7.1.3).)
E5.7.3. Mass Transfer at Moderate and High Reynolds Numbers
◮Spherical particle at various Reynolds numbers. In the case of a spherical particle
in a translational ﬂow at 0.5 ≤Re ≤200 and 0.125 ≤Sc ≤50, a number of numerical
results concerning the mean Sherwood number can be described by the Clift–Grace–Weber
approximate formula
Sh = 0.5 + 0.527 Re0.077(1 + 2 Re Sc)1/3,
(E5.7.3.1)
whose error is about 3%.
The analysis of available experimental data on heat and mass transfer to a solid sphere
in a translational ﬂow results in the following Clift–Grace–Weber correlations.
Heat exchange with air at Pr = 0.7:
Nu = 0.5 + 0.47 Re0.47
Nu = 0.5 + 0.2 Re0.58
for
50 ≤Re ≤2 × 103,
for
2 × 103 ≤Re ≤5 × 104.
Mass transfer with a liquid for large Schmidt numbers (Sc > 100):
Sh = 0.5 + 0.5 Re0.48 Sc1/3
Sh = 0.5 + 0.31 Re0.55 Sc1/3
for
50 ≤Re ≤103,
for
103 ≤Re ≤5 × 104.
The experimental data for 0.5 < Re < 50 are well described by the expression (E5.7.3.1).
◮General correlation for the Sherwood number.
For the calculation of the mean
Sherwood number in laminar ﬂows of various types without closed streamlines past a solid
spherical particle, one can use the approximate formula
Sh = 0.5 + (0.125 + Sh3
∞)1/3,
(E5.7.3.2)
where the auxiliary value Sh∞must be chosen equal to the leading term of the asymptotic
expansion of the Sherwood number as Pe →∞(for given Re = const). Formula (E5.7.3.2)
after the substitution of the value of Sh∞can be used for the calculation of the Sherwood
number for various ﬂows (one can consider, say, shear ﬂows) in the entire range of Peclet
numbers. For a solid spherical particle in a translational Stokes ﬂow (as Re →0), formula
(E5.7.3.2) becomes (E5.7.2.8).

E5.8. MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER TO SPHERICAL DROPS AND BUBBLES IN TRANSLATIONAL FLOW
853
E5.8. Mass and Heat Transfer to Spherical Drops and
Bubbles in Translational Flow
E5.8.1. Statement of the Problem. Some Remarks
In this section, attention is mainly paid to formulas for the calculation of the mean Sherwood
number for spherical drops and bubbles of radius a in a translational ﬂow with velocity Ui at
various Reynolds and Peclet numbers. Consider the exterior problem with limiting diffusion
resistance of the continuous phase. We assume that the concentration on the drop or bubble
surface and far from it is constant and equal to Cs and Ci, respectively.
The mathematical statement of the problem on a steady-state mass transfer process in
a continuous medium outside a drop is described by equation (E5.7.1.1) and the bound-
ary conditions (E5.7.1.2)–(E5.7.1.3), where the ﬂuid velocity components VR and Vθ in
Eq. (E5.7.1.4) are determined from the corresponding hydrodynamic problem. The mean
Sherwood number, as in the case of a solid spherical particle, is computed by formula
(E5.7.1.5).
The process of convective diffusion to the liquid–liquid (liquid–gas) interface substan-
tially differs from the process of convective diffusion to the ﬂuid–solid interface, which
was considered in Section E5.7. This is due to the difference between the hydrodynamic
conditions on the interfaces. The ﬂuid velocity on the surface of a solid is always zero by
virtue of the no-slip condition. On the contrary, the interface between two ﬂuids can move,
and the tangential velocity on the interface differs from zero.
Convective transfer of a substance by a moving ﬂuid to the ﬂuid–solid interface takes
place under the condition that the ﬂow is somewhat retarded, so that the transfer rate close
to the surface is considerably lower than that in the bulk of the solution. On the contrary,
diffusion to a liquid–liquid (liquid–gas) interface takes place under the more favorable
conditions of nonretarded ﬂow.
That is why convective diffusion of a substance to a
liquid–liquid interface is much more intensive than that to a ﬂuid–solid interface.
We denote the mean Sherwood number for a gas bubble by Shb and for a solid sphere
by Shp.
E5.8.2. Mass Transfer at Low Reynolds Numbers and Various Peclet
Numbers
For spherical drops and bubbles in a translational Stokes ﬂow (low Reynolds numbers,
Re →0) the ﬂuid velocity components VR and Vθ in Eq. (E5.7.1.4) are determined by
formulas (E4.7.1.7), where β = µ2/µ1 is the drop–ambient medium dynamic viscosity
ratio. (The value β = 0 corresponds to a gas bubble.)
◮Drops and bubbles at low Peclet numbers. For Pe = 0, which corresponds to a drop
(bubble) in a quiescent ﬂuid, the exact solution of problem (E5.7.1.1)–(E5.7.1.3), as in the
case of a solid particle, has the form (E5.7.2.1), and the corresponding mean Sherwood
number is unity; see Eq. (E5.7.2.2).
The three-term expansion of the mean Sherwood number as Pe →0 has the form
Sh = 1 + 1
2 Pe + 2 + 3β
6(1 + β) Pe2 ln Pe + O(Pe2).
(E5.8.2.1)
For β →∞, formula (E5.8.2.1) passes into formula (E5.7.2.3) for a solid particle.
◮Drops and bubbles at high Peclet numbers (the diffusion boundary layer). For high
Peclet numbers, a thin diffusion boundary layer is formed near the drop (bubble) surface.

854
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
The ratio of the thickness of this layer to the drop radius is of the order of Pe–1/2. In this
region, the radial component of molecular diffusion to the drop surface is essential, and
tangential diffusion may be neglected. Convective mass transfer due to the motion of the
ﬂuid should also be taken into account.
For 0 ≤β ≪Pe1/3, the concentration distribution in the diffusion boundary layer can
be expressed via the complementary error function as follows:

One can see that the local diffusion ﬂux attains its maximum at the front stagnation point
on the drop surface (at θ = π) and monotonically decreases with the angular coordinate to
the minimum value, which is zero and is attained at θ = 0.

0.82 Pe1/3 – 1. The value β = 0 in (E5.8.2.4) and (E5.8.2.5) corresponds to a gas bubble.
◮Spherical bubbles at any Peclet numbers. The results of the numerical solution of the
problem of mass transfer to a spherical bubble in a translational ﬂow is well approximated
by the following expression for the mean Sherwood number:
Sh = 0.6 + (0.16 + 0.213 Pe)1/2
(β = 0),
(E5.8.2.6)
whose maximum error is about 3% in the entire range of Peclet numbers.
◮Spherical drops at any Peclet numbers. In the range 0 ≤Pe ≤200, the results of

Sherwood numbers for a bubble and for a solid particle, which can be calculated by
formulas (E5.8.2.6) and (E5.7.2.8), respectively.
It is important to note that the expression (E5.8.2.7) gives three valid terms of the
asymptotic expansion of Sh as Pe →0 for any β, see formula (E5.8.2.1).
In the interval 200 ≤Pe < ∞, for any values of the phase viscosities, the mean Sherwood

◮Spherical drop at high Peclet numbers for Re ≥35.

E5.8.4. General Correlations for the Sherwood Number
◮Bubbles. For the calculation of the mean Sherwood number in laminar ﬂows of various
types past a spherical bubble, one can use the approximate formula
Sh = 0.6 + (0.16 + Sh2

(E5.8.4.1)
where Sh∞is the asymptotic value of the mean Sherwood number as Pe →∞, which can
be calculated by solving the diffusion boundary layer equation in a given ﬂow ﬁeld. (It is
assumed that there are no closed streamlines in the continuous phase.)

856
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
Formula (E5.8.4.1) after the substitution of the value of Sh∞can be used for the
calculation of the Sherwood number in the entire range of Peclet numbers. For a spherical
bubble in a translational Stokes ﬂow (as Re →0), formula (E5.8.4.1) passes into (E5.8.2.6).
The general formula (E5.8.4.1) can also be used in the case of linear shear ﬂows.
◮Drops in the entire range of phase viscosities. For low and moderate Peclet numbers
in an arbitrary laminar ﬂow past a spherical drop under limiting resistance of the continuous
phase, it is expedient to calculate the mean Sherwood number by using formula (E5.8.2.7),
where Shb and Shp are the Sherwood numbers for the limit cases of a bubble and a solid
particle. These quantities can be calculated by formulas (E5.8.4.1) and (E5.7.3.2). For high
Peclet numbers, in the entire range of phase viscosities, the mean Sherwood number can be
found by solving the cubic equation
Sh3 – Sh2
βSh – Sh3
p = 0,
(E5.8.4.2)
where Shβ is the asymptotic value of the mean Sherwood number obtained in the diffusion
boundary layer approximation for a drop of moderate viscosity β = O(1) as Pe →∞, and
Shp is the corresponding asymptotic value for a solid particle (β = ∞) as Pe →∞. For
the special case of a translational Stokes ﬂow past a spherical drop, Eq. (E5.8.4.2) passes
into (E5.8.2.8).
For Stokes ﬂows (Re →0) at high Peclet numbers, one can use the approximate formula
Shβ =
Sh0
p
β + 1
,
(E5.8.4.3)
where Sh0 is the asymptotic value of the Sherwood number for a gas bubble (β = 0) as
Pe →∞. For a translational or arbitrary linear straining Stokes ﬂow past a spherical drop,
formula (E5.8.4.3) is exact.
E5.9. Mass Transfer to Nonspherical Particles in
Translational Flow
E5.9.1. Mass and Heat Transfer to a Particle of Arbitrary Shape at
Low Peclet Numbers
◮Asymptotic formulas for the Sherwood number and diffusion ﬂux. For low Peclet
numbers, the problem of mass exchange between a particle of arbitrary shape and a uniform
translational ﬂow were studied by Brenner (1963). The following expression was obtained
for the mean Sherwood number up to ﬁrst-order inﬁnitesimals with respect to Pe:
Sh
Sh0
= 1 + 1
8π PeM,
PeM = ΠUi
D ,
(E5.9.1.1)
where Sh0 is the Sherwood number corresponding to a quiescent medium. The inﬂuence of
the ﬂuid motion is characterized by the modiﬁed Peclet number, in which the shape factor Π
of the particle plays the role of the characteristic length.
Formula (E5.9.1.1) is quite general and holds for solid particles, drops, and bubbles of
arbitrary shape in a uniform translational ﬂow at any Re as Pe →0.
It gives a good approximation to the Sherwood number ratio for PeM < 5.
In the
special case of a spherical particle of radius a, in (E5.9.1.1) one should set Π = 4πa. For
nonspherical particles, in (E5.9.1.1) one must use the values of Π from Table E5.3.

E5.9. MASS TRANSFER TO NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES IN TRANSLATIONAL FLOW
857
For a particle of arbitrary shape in a translational Stokes ﬂow, the ﬁrst three terms of the
asymptotic expansion of the dimensionless total diffusion ﬂux as Pe →0 have the form
I = I0 + 1
8π Pe I2
0 + 1
8π Pe2 ln PeI2
0(f ⋅e ) + O(Pe2).
(E5.9.1.2)
Here I0 = Π/a is the total ﬂux to the particle in a quiescent ﬂuid, f is the dimensionless
vector equal to the ratio of the drag of the particle to the Stokes drag of a solid sphere of
radius a (a is the characteristic length that appears in the deﬁnitions of the dimensionless
variables Pe, I, and I0), and e is the unit vector codirected with the ﬂuid velocity at inﬁnity.
The Sherwood number is given by Sh = I/S, where S is the dimensionless surface area of
the particle.
To calculate I0 = Π/a, one can use the results of Section E5.6.
◮Some special cases. For an ellipsoid of revolution with semiaxes a and b (a is the
equatorial radius) whose symmetry axis is directed along the ﬂow, the Stokes drag is given
by the formula
(f ⋅e ) =




(χ2 + 1) ln χ + 1
χ – 1 – 2χ
i–1
for a ≤b,
where χ =
(a/b)2 – 1
–1/2.
For a body of revolution whose axis is inclined at an angle ω to the incoming ﬂow
direction (see Figure E4.6), the following formula holds in the Stokes approximation (as
Re →0):
(f ⋅e ) = f∥cos2 ω + f⊥sin2 ω,
(E5.9.1.3)
where f∥and f⊥are the values of the dimensionless drag of the body for the cases in which
its axis is parallel (ω = 0) and perpendicular (ω = π/2), respectively, to the ﬂow direction.
In particular, for a thin circular disk, one should set f∥= 8/(3π) and f⊥= 16/(9π) in
(E5.9.1.3); for a dumbbell-like particle consisting of two adjacent spheres of equal radius,
f∥≈0.645 and f⊥≈0.716.
The logarithmic term sharply restricts the practical value of the expansion (E5.9.1.2).
The two-term expression (E5.9.1.1) holds in a wider range of the Peclet number (although
this expression is less accurate for very small Pe).
E5.9.2. Mass Transfer to a Ellipsoidal Particle in Translational Flow
◮High Peclet numbers (the diffusion boundary layer approximations).
Consider
diffusion to the surface of a solid ellipsoidal particle in a homogeneous translational Stokes
ﬂow (Re →0). The particle is an ellipsoid of revolution with semiaxes a and b oriented
along and across the ﬂow, respectively. (Here b is the equatorial radius.) We introduce the
following notation:
χ = b/a,
ae = aχ2/3,
Pee = aeUi/D,
(E5.9.2.1)
where ae is the radius of the volume-equivalent sphere serving as the characteristic length.
The dimensionless total diffusion ﬂux to the surface of an ellipsoidal particle at high
Peclet numbers is determined by the formula

For 0.2 ≤χ ≤5.0, the maximum error of formula (E5.9.2.6) for an ellipsoidal particle
does not exceed 10%.
(The comparison used the results of the numerical solution of
the corresponding axisymmetric mass and heat transfer problem by the ﬁnite-difference
method.)
Formulas (E5.9.2.2) and (E5.9.2.4) cannot be used in the case of a strongly oblate
(χ ≫1) or a strongly prolate (χ ≪1) ellipsoid of revolution.
E5.9.3. Mass Transfer to Particles of Arbitrary Shape
◮Bodies of revolution. Consider a bounded body of revolution whose axis is inclined
at an angle ω to the translation ﬂow velocity at inﬁnity (see Figure E4.6). In this case, the
mean Sherwood number can be computed by the approximate formula
Sh = Sh∥cos2 ω + Sh⊥sin2 ω,
(E5.9.3.1)

E5.9. MASS TRANSFER TO NONSPHERICAL PARTICLES IN TRANSLATIONAL FLOW
859
where Sh∥and Sh⊥are the mean Sherwood numbers corresponding to the cases of parallel
(ω = 0) and perpendicular (ω = π/2) positions of the body in the ﬂow, respectively.
At low Peclet numbers, for the translational Stokes ﬂow past an arbitrarily shaped body
of revolution, formula (E5.9.3.1) coincides with the exact asymptotic expression in the ﬁrst
three terms of the expansion. Since (E5.9.3.1) holds identically for a spherical particle at
all Peclet numbers, one can expect that for particles whose shape is nearly spherical, the
approximate formula (E5.9.3.1) will give good results for low as well as moderate or high
Peclet numbers.
◮Particles of arbitrary shape. For a steady-state viscous ﬂow (without closed stream-
lines) past arbitrarily shaped smooth particles, one can calculate the mean Sherwood number
by the approximate formula
Sh = 0.5 Sh0 + (0.125 Sh3
0 + Sh3
∞)1/3.
(E5.9.3.2)
Here the auxiliary variables Sh0 and Sh∞in (E5.9.3.2) are the leading terms of the
asymptotic expansions of the mean Sherwood number at small and large Peclet numbers,
respectively.
(In (E5.9.3.2), Sh, Sh0, and Sh∞are deﬁned on the basis of the same
characteristic length.)
For spherical particles, we have Sh0 = 1 (the radius is taken as the characteristic length),
and (E5.9.3.2) turns into (E5.7.3.2).
The substitution of the values of Sh0 and Sh∞
corresponding to ellipsoidal particles in a translational Stokes ﬂow into (E5.9.3.2) results
in (E5.9.2.6).
For a translational Stokes ﬂow past a convex body of revolution of sufﬁciently smooth
shape with symmetry axis parallel to the ﬂow, the error E (in percent) in formula (E5.9.3.2)
for the mean Sherwood number can be approximately estimated as follows:
E < 2
 a
b + b
a

,
where a and b are the maximum longitudinal and transverse dimensions of the particle.
This estimate agrees well with the results previously described for an ellipsoidal particle.
For a particle of a given shape, the auxiliary quantities Sh0 and Sh∞occurring in
(E5.9.3.2) can be determined either theoretically or experimentally. In the last case, the
parameter Sh0 must be found from experiments on diffusion to the particle in a quiescent
ﬂuid. (Recall that the value Sh0 corresponds to the dimensionless capacity of the body; the
electrostatic method for measuring this capacity is widely used in electrical engineering.)
For a solid particle, the asymptotics of the mean Sherwood number as Pe →∞has the form
Sh∞= B Pe1/3, where B is a constant. Therefore, to ﬁnd the parameter B and hence Sh∞,
it sufﬁces to carry out a single experiment at high Peclet numbers. (High Peclet numbers
at low Reynolds numbers, Re < 0.5, can easily be achieved in water solutions of glycerin.)
Thus, to ﬁnd Sh0 and Sh∞, it sufﬁces to carry out two fairly simple experiments.
E5.9.4. Mass and Heat Transfer to a Circular Cylinder in
Translational Flow
Consider diffusion to the surface of a circular cylinder of radius a in a ﬂow with velocity Ui
directed along the normal to the cylinder axis. This is a model problem used in chemical
engineering for calculating mass transfer to prolate particles; it is used even more widely in
mechanics of aerosols for analyzing diffusion sedimentation of aerosols on ﬁbrous ﬁlters.

860
MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
At low Reynolds numbers Re = aUi/ν, the analytical solution of this problem results
in the following two-term expansion of the mean Sherwood number (based on the radius of
the cylinder) with respect to the high Peclet number Pe = aUi/D:
Sh =
0.580
(2.00 – ln 2 Re)1/3 Pe1/3 + 0.0993.
If Sc > 0.5, then the mean Sherwood number for cylinders of various cross-sections
perpendicular to the ﬂow direction in a wide range of Reynolds numbers can be determined
by using the following formula, derived from experimental data (Kutateladze, 1990):
Sh = A Sc0.37Rem,
where the coefﬁcients A and m are given below:

E5.10. Transient Mass Transfer to Particles, Drops, and
Bubbles in Steady-State Flows
E5.10.1. Statement of the Problem
We consider a laminar steady-state translational ﬂow past a solid spherical particle (drop or
bubble) of radius a and study transient mass transfer to the particle surface. At the initial
time t = 0, the concentration in the continuous phase is constant and equal to Ci, whereas
for t > 0 a constant concentration Cs is maintained on the particle surface.
In the particle-centered spherical coordinate system (R, θ, ϕ), the nonstationary problem
for the concentration C in dimensionless variables comprises the convective diffusion
equation

where c = (Ci –C)/(Ci –Cs), τ = Dt/a2, r = R/a, Pe = aU/D, and U is the characteristic
ﬂow velocity (for the translational ﬂow U = Ui, where Ui is the ﬂuid velocity at inﬁnity).
The steady-state ﬂow ﬁeld v is given.

E5.10.2. General Correlations for the Sherwood Number
◮Spherical particles and drops at high Peclet numbers. In what follows we restrict
ourselves to the case of high Peclet numbers and assume that there are no closed streamlines
in the ﬂow.
The diffusion boundary layer in problem (E5.10.1.1), (E5.10.1.2) is ﬁrst adjacent to
the particle surface and then rapidly spreads over the ﬂow region with the subsequent
exponential relaxation to a steady state. The characteristic relaxation time τr is of the order
of Pe–2/3 for a solid particle and of the order of Pe–1 for bubbles and drops of moderate
viscosity.
The time dependence of the mean Sherwood number for an arbitrary steady-state ﬂow
past spherical particles, drops, and bubbles can be determined by the approximate formula
Sh
Shst

coth(π Sh2

(E5.10.2.1)
where Shst = lim
τ→∞Sh is the Sherwood number for the steady-state diffusion mode; Shst
depends onthe Peclet number andcan be determined by solving the corresponding stationary
problem. (For the translational ﬂow, the stationary problem is determined by the equation
and the boundary conditions (E5.7.1.1)–(E5.7.1.3).)
Equation (E5.10.2.1) gives a valid asymptotic result for any ﬂow ﬁeld in both limit cases
τ →0 and τ →∞.
Table E5.4 presents Shst for the translational ﬂow past spherical particles, drops, and
bubbles of radius a. The parameter β is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity of the drop to
that of the ambient ﬂuid and varies in the range 0 ≤β ≤2 (the value β = 0 corresponds to a
gas bubble).
For example, in the case of nonstationary mass transfer in a steady-state translational
Stokes ﬂow past a spherical drop with limiting resistance of the continuous phase, the
steady-state value Shst is presented in the third row of Table E5.4. By substituting this
value into (E5.10.2.1), we obtain

MASS AND HEAT TRANSFER
Formula (E5.10.2.1) gives good results for the mean Sherwood number for linear shear
ﬂows past spherical particles, drops, and bubbles at high Peclet numbers. (In the diffusion
boundary layer approximation, the maximum error of Eq. (E5.10.2.1) for all τ does not
exceed 1.8% in any case.)
◮Spherical particles and drops at arbitrary Peclet numbers. To calculate the mean
Sherwood number for an arbitrary laminar ﬂow past spherical particles, drops, and bubbles
in the entire range of Peclet numbers, one can use the interpolation formula

Consider the behavior of this function in various limit cases. Since Shst →1 as Pe →0,
we see that Eq. (E5.10.2.3) yields the exact result (E5.6.2.4) for a quiescent medium. As
Pe →∞, we have Shst →∞, and the expression (E5.10.2.3) passes into (E5.10.2.1).
For small τ, Eq. (E5.10.2.3) yields the exact result Sh ≈(πτ)–1/2. As τ →∞, we have
Sh →Shst, which follows from (E5.10.2.3).

Electrical Engineering
E6.1. Generalities
E6.1.1. Introduction. Basic Notions, Deﬁnitions, and Notation
◮Preliminary remarks. Electrical engineering is a technical science studying physical
phenomena related to directed motion of charged particles in conducting media at the
level of macroprocesses and the problems of practical use of such phenomena. Electrical
engineering is traditionally divided into the following ﬁelds: foundations of circuit theory,
foundations of magnetic circuits, electric devices and transformers, electric machines, and
foundations of electronics.
The basic notions of electrical engineering coincide with similar notions in the course
of physics. Electrical engineering employs the following physical quantities in the sense
explained below.
◮Notions, deﬁnitions, and notation. The potential is the work done by electric forces to
transfer the unit charge from a given point in space, in particular, a given point of the circuit
to the point at inﬁnity (the zero potential point). The potential is denoted by the symbol ϕ
and is measured in volts (V). The potential can be determined for a given point in space
(circuit) with respect to the zero potential.
The voltage (potential difference) is the work done by electric forces to transfer the unit
charge from a point in space (circuit) to another point. The voltage is also measured in
volts (V) and denoted by the symbol U. The voltage can be determined only between two
points in space (circuit).
The current strength (current) is the electric charge passing through the conductor
transverse cross-section per unit time. The current strength is measured in amperes (A) and
is denoted by I. The current strength can be determined for a given element of the electric
circuit.
The electromotive force (EMF) is the work done by forces of nonelectrostatical nature
(extraneous forces) to transfer the unit charge from a point in space (circuit) to another point.
The EMF is also measured in volts (V) and denoted by E. The EMF can be determined
only for two points in space (circuit).
The resistance (electric resistance) is a physical quantity characterizing the property of
bodies or media with current ﬂowing in them to transform the electric energy into the heat
energy of particles of these bodies or media. The resistance is measured in ohms (Ω) and is
denoted by R. The reciprocal of resistance is called the conductance and is denoted by g.
The SI unit of conductance is the siemens (S), 1 S = 1/Ω.
The capacitance is the physical quantity characterizing the property of bodies to accu-
mulate electric ﬁeld energy. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F).
The inductance is the physical quantity characterizing the property of bodies with current
ﬂowing in them to accumulate the magnetic ﬁeld energy. The SI unit of inductance is the
henry (H).
The power is the work done in electric circuits by force of electrical and nonelectrical
nature per unit time. The SI unit of power is the watt (W).

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
E6.1.2. Perfect Elements. Active and Passive Elements
◮Perfect elements. Notation conventions for perfect elements. Electrical engineering
operates with ideal or perfect elements. The idealization consists in that each of the perfect
elements has only one of the properties inherent in actual elements. Any perfect element
is an abstraction, i.e., a convenient model that with certain accuracy reﬂects the processes
and phenomena occurring in actual elements.
In electrical engineering, the following perfect elements are studied.
A conductor is a perfect element in which the electric energy is neither transformed
nor dissipated nor accumulated. The conductor has neither resistance nor inductance. The
voltage at the ends of a perfect conductor is always zero. The connection of two points of
a perfect conductor is called the short circuit.
A disconnection is a perfect element in which the electric energy is neither transformed
nor dissipated nor accumulated. The disconnection has no capacitance, and the disconnec-
tion resistance and inductance can be assumed to be inﬁnitely large. The current through a
disconnection is always zero. The disconnection between two points of an electric circuit
is called the open circuit.
A switch is a perfect element having two stable states in one of which it is a perfect
conductor and in the other it is a disconnection. The transition from one state into another
occurs in an inﬁnitely small time interval.
A resistor is a perfect element that has only a ﬁnite value of resistance. The inductance
of a perfect resistor is zero.
In the resistor, the electric energy is dissipated; i.e., it is
irreversibly transformed into the heat energy.
A capacitor is a perfect element that has only a ﬁnite value of capacitance. The resistance
of a perfect capacitor is inﬁnitely large, and its inductance is zero. In the capacitor, the
electric ﬁeld energy is accumulated.
A coil (induction coil) is a perfect element that has only a ﬁnite value of inductance. The
resistance of ideal induction coil is zero. In the induction coil, the magnetic ﬁeld energy is
accumulated.
An ideal EMF source is an active element such that the voltage at its terminals is equal
to the value of its electromotive force. This quantity is, in particular, independent of the
current ﬂowing through the EMF source. The short circuit problem for an ideal EMF source
is ill posed.
The ideal source of current is an active element such that the strength of the current
ﬂowing through it is always equal to the current of the source. The current of the source is,
in particular, independent of its voltage. The open circuit problem for the current source is
ill posed.
By default, all the elements are assumed to be perfect. Any perfect element in electrical
circuits (networks) is indicated by the symbol of its typical parameter. If it is necessary to
distinguish several elements, then the parameters are equipped with corresponding indices.
The notation conventions for perfect elements are shown in Fig. E6.1.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, it is assumed that the geometric dimensions of perfect
elements are zero.
The direction from minus to plus at the ideal EMF source shows the direction of
extraneous forces or the direction of increase in the potential. The voltage on such a source
is equal to E.
A perfect element is said to be linear if its characteristic elements are independent of the
current ﬂowing in the element and of its voltage. By default, it is assumed that the elements
are linear.
The mathematical model of an actual element can be constructed from perfect elements
with any desired accuracy of details.

◮Active and passive elements. The perfect elements are divided into active and passive
elements according to the character of the energy transformation in them.
In passive elements, only the energy accumulation (inductance and capacitance) or its
dissipation (irreversible transformation of electric energy into heat in resistors) may occur.
In several passive elements, energy is neither accumulated nor transformed at all (conductor,
disconnection, switch).
In active elements, energy is transformed from one type into another. An EMF source
and a current source are active elements. The energy transformation in active elements is
always reversible.
E6.1.3. Electric Circuits and Networks. Classiﬁcation of Electric
Circuits and Their Operation Modes
◮Electric circuits and networks. An electric circuit is an electrical engineering device
that exists or may exist in reality. An electric circuit consists of actual elements.
A network (electrical network) is a certain graphical representation of an actual device,
which is constructed only of perfect elements.
An equivalent circuit of an electric circuit consists of a set of different idealized elements
chosen so that it were possible to describe the processes in the circuit with a prescribed or
desired accuracy.
◮Classiﬁcation of electric circuits and their operation modes. The electric circuits
are classiﬁed according to the characteristics of the elements composing them as follows:

868
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
linear and nonlinear circuits, circuits with lumped parameters, and circuits with distributed
parameters. For a circuit to be referred to as nonlinear, it sufﬁces to contain at least one
nonlinear element. For a circuit to be referred to as a circuit with distributed parameters,
it sufﬁces that the linear dimensions of at least one element are commensurable with the
wavelength of the electromagnetic ﬁeld arising in this circuit.
The operation modes of electric circuits are classiﬁed according to the character of
variations in the input and output signals (currents and voltages) in time. The operation
modes are divided into stationary, quasistationary (periodic), and nonstationary (transient).
E6.1.4. Structure Elements of Network. Notion of the Graph of a
Network
◮Structure elements of network. In any electrical network, the following structural
elements can be distinguished: branch, node, loop.
An branch is a series connection of several perfect elements. A branch can consist of a
single element if it is not a conductor or a disconnection. A series connection is a connection
of perfect elements in which the “output” of one element is the “input” of one and only one
subsequent element. The branch origin is the “input” of the ﬁrst of the elements, and the
branch end is the “output” of the last of the perfect elements. The origin and the end of
a branch are, as a rule, conditional notions. It is convenient to denote all perfect elements
belonging to the same branch by the same indices. It follows from the charge conservation
law that the current strength is the same for all elements of the branch.
A node is a point common for three or more branches.
For each of the branches
belonging to (incident on) a given node, the node can be only the origin or the end of the
branch. It follows from the deﬁnition of electric potential that the potentials of all points
forming a given node are the same.
An loop is any closed path in an electric circuit network such that none of the branches
and none of the nodes are encountered twice when going around this path. A loop may be
dependent and independent.
◮Graph of a network. The graph of a network is a graph such that the set of its vertices
coincides with the set of the network nodes and the set of its edges coincides with the
network branches. The set of independent loops in a network is the set of fundamental
cycles in the graph of the network. The elements of a graph are branches, vertices, nodes,
and loops. A branch is the current path between two vertices, and the current strength in
all transverse cross-sections of the branch at a given time moment is constant. A node is
a vertex at which three or more branches meet. A loop is a closed path beginning and
terminating at the same vertex. The number of loops in a network may be rather large, but
still, there is a number N of linearly independent loops, which can be determined by the
formula
N = B – K + 1,
where B is the number of branches and K is the number of nodes.
E6.1.5. Physical Laws for Structure Elements
For the basic structure elements of any electrical network, there exists its own physical law:
Ohm’s law
(for branches),
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law
(for nodes),
Kirchhoff’s second law
(for closed loops).

E6.1. GENERALITIES
869
◮Ohm’s law. Ohm’s law is formulated as follows: the current strength on a part of the
circuit is directly proportional to the voltage applied to this part and is inversely proportional
to the resistance of this part.
Ohm’s law can be interpreted for a part of the circuit containing an EMF source E (the
generalized Ohm law) as follows: the current of a part of the circuit is equal to the algebraic
sum of its voltage and EMF divided by the resistance of the part. The EMF and the voltage
are taken with positive sign if their directions coincide with the current direction and are
taken with negative sign if their directions are opposite to the current direction. The four
situations shown in Fig. E6.2 are possible.

◮Kirchhoff’s laws. Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law is formulated as follows:
n

k=1
Ik = 0
(the algebraic sum of currents at a node is zero).
Here it is assumed that the currents ﬂowing into a node are taken with the sign “+”, and the
currents ﬂowing out of a node, with the sign “–”.

where Pn
k=1 Ek is the algebraic sum of EMF Ek in a closed loop, and a term in this sum
is taken with sign “+” if the directions of the source EMF and of an arbitrary chosen path
tracing coincide with each other, otherwise, the sign “–” is taken; Pm
l=1 RlIl is the algebraic
sum of voltages in the same loop, and a term of this sum is taken with sign “+” if the
directions of current voltage and of an arbitrary chosen path tracing coincide with each
other; otherwise, the sign “–” is taken.
E6.1.6. Problems of Analysis and Synthesis of a Network. An
Analysis of a Network by Physical Laws. Potential Diagram
◮Problems of analysis and synthesis of a network.
In electrical engineering, the
problems of network analysis and synthesis are distinguished. The analysis problem is a

870
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
problem of calculating currents in branches of a network, of voltages between nodes, of
powers, etc. from the well-known structure of the circuit and the parameters of its elements.
The analysis problem is generally solved by constructing an equivalent circuit that, with
a desired accuracy, reﬂects the circuit element properties important in the problem under
study and the circuit structure. Further, the problem is solved by one of the methods for
analyzing the circuits, which are considered below. The choice of any method is based on
the following factors: the dimension of the obtained system of equations, the simplicity of
algorithmization, and the restricted possibilities of using the method.
The circuit synthesis problem involves the construction of a network ensuring the
prescribed values of one or several parameters for one or several elements under certain
restrictions.
◮An analysis of a network by Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws.
An analysis of any
correctly described electric circuit can be performed by using only the three physical laws
listed in Subsection E6.1.5. In general, to solve the problem, it is necessary to write out the
equations of Kirchhoff’s second law for all independent loops and of Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law
for all nodes except one arbitrary node. If necessary, the generalized Ohm law is written
for separate branches. The system of linear equations thus obtained can be solved by any
method.
The order of calculations may be as follows:
1. The positive directions of currents in all branches are chosen and indicated by arrows.
2. The positive directions of path tracing are chosen.
3. The system of equations according to Kirchhoff’s laws is constructed: (i) by the ﬁrst
law, we obtain N1 = K – 1 equations, (ii) by the second law, we have N2 = B – K + 1
equations, where B is the number of branches and K is the number of nodes (in the
whole, we obtain N1 + N2 = B equations).
Example. As an example, consider the electrical network shown in Fig. E6.3. We choose the directions
of the currents and the directions of the path tracing as is shown in Fig. E6.3. Then we obtain the system of
equations:
I1 – I2 + I3 = 0,
E1 + E2 = I1R1 + I2R2,
E2 + E3 = I2R2 + I3R3.
The unknowns in this system of equations may be any three quantities, and the others must be prescribed.
Usually, the unknowns are the currents in the circuit branches. If it is necessary to introduce the voltage UAB
into the system of equations, then it is also required to write out the generalized Ohm law for any of the three
branches.

Using Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, one can calculate the operation mode of any electric
circuit. But the order of the system of equations can be large. The system can be simpliﬁed
by different methods, and all of them are based on Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s laws. A method

parameters.

the EMF E1 and E2, respectively.
We illustrate the diagram construction with an example of a simple unbranched circuit
shown in Fig. E6.4. Assume that the direction of the path tracing coincides with the direction
of the current. To construct the potential diagram, we assume that one (any) of the potentials
of the closed loop is zero. If the EMF E1 exceeds the EMF E2, then, in this case, we have
I =
E1 – E2
R1 + R01 + R2 + R02
.
Let ϕa = 0; then
ϕb = ϕa – R1I,
ϕc = ϕb + E1 – R01I,
ϕd = ϕc – R2I,
ϕa = ϕd – E2 – R01I = 0.
In these expressions, the value of the EMF source voltage E is taken with sign “+” if the
sense of the path coincides with the direction of E; otherwise, the sign “–” is taken. The
value of the resistor voltage is taken with the sign “+” if the sense of the path is opposite to
that of the current; otherwise, the sign “–” is taken.
E6.2. Linear Circuits of Direct Current
E6.2.1. Power of Direct Current
To estimate the energy conditions, it is important to know how fast the work is done; i.e, it
is important to determine the power: P = UI.
For resistive elements, this expression can be transformed using Ohm’s law as follows:
PR = UI = I2R = U2/R.
For the EMF source whose direction coincides with the direction of the current, the
power of extraneous forces is determined as PE = EI.
But if the current and EMF
directions are opposite (for example, in the case of battery charging), then the power of
extraneous forces is: PE = –EI. In this case, the EMF source obtains energy from the
external circuit.

872
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The power of extraneous forces of the current source is equal to PJ = UabI = UabJ. If
Uab < 0, then the source gains energy from the external circuit.
In any electric circuit, the energy balance—i.e., the power balance—must be satisﬁed,
which means that the algebraic sum of powers of all energy sources must be equal to the
algebraic sum of powers of all energy receivers:

PE =

The representation of actual electric energy sources in the form of two equivalent circuits
is an equivalent representation with respect to the exterior part of the circuit (receiver); i.e.,
in both cases, the voltages between the source terminals are the same (Uab). But the energy
relations in the two equivalent circuits are not the same. There is no equality between the
power of the EMF sources and the current source EI ≠UabI and the loss power I2R0 ≠I2

◮External characteristic and operation modes of an EMF source.
According to
Ohm’s law, the EMF source terminal voltage takes the form
Uab = E – IR0.
The dependence betweenthe voltage U andthe current I ﬂowingthroughthe EMF source
is called the external characteristic of the EMF source or the volt-ampere characteristic
(VACh). The external characteristic of the source U(I) completely determines the properties
of this source and, for a majority of actual sources, this characteristic, can be represented
as a straight line (see Fig. E6.7).

Figure E6.7. External characteristic of the EMF source.
Of all possible operation modes of an EMF source, we note the following four most
important modes:
point 1: open circuit mode,
point 2: nominal (typical) operation mode,
point 3: consistent operation mode,
point 4: short circuit mode.
The open circuit mode (point 1) is an operation mode in which the receiver resistance is
inﬁnitely large (R = ∞). In practice, this corresponds to disconnection of an electric circuit,
hence the open-circuit current is zero (I∗= 0), and hence U∗= E. In the open circuit tests,
the EMF E can be determined from the readings of a voltmeter connected directly to the
open-circuit terminals of the EMF source E.
The nominal mode (point 2) of a source is characterized by the fact that its voltage,
current, and power correspond to the values calculated by the manufacturing departments.
In this case, the best operation conditions are guaranteed for the EMF source (efﬁciency,
operating life, etc.). The quantities determining the nominal mode are usually indicated
in the certiﬁcate, in the catalog, or on the device panel.
In the nominal mode, UN =
E – R0IN.
In practice, the nominal mode is attained if UN lies in the limits 0.90E ≤UN ≤0.95E.
The consistent mode (point 3) is an operation mode in which the source transfers the
maximal power Pmax to the receiver (to the external circuit). To achieve this operation
mode, it is necessary to choose a value of the receiver resistance R equal to the internal
resistance of the source R0, i.e., R = R0.
The short circuit mode (point 4) is characterized by the fact that the receiver resistance
becomes zero R = 0. As a rule, in practice, this is related to closing the electric energy
receiver by a conductor of a very small resistance, the so-called industrial short circuit, often
caused by a lot of abuse of electrical engineering devices (electric motors, transformers,
home equipment, etc.).

874
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
For R = 0, we have U′ = RI′ = 0, and then the short circuit current is equal to I′ = E/R0.
Because of a small internal resistance of the EMF source E, the short circuit current (I′) can
attain very large values signiﬁcantly exceeding the value of nominal currents (I′ ≫IN).
Therefore, the short circuit mode, as a rule, is very dangerous and undesirable for both the
source and the receiver. But in several cases, the short circuit mode is nominal for electrical
engineering devices such as the welding transformers and generators, current transformers,
etc.
The parameters of the EMF source E can be determined graphically by using its external
characteristic.
E6.2.3. Problem of Maximal Power Transfer. The Source Efﬁciency
Factor
For the receiver to deliver the maximal power Pmax, it is necessary that the receiver operate
with the EMF source E in the consistent operation mode. To achieve the consistent mode, it
is necessary to choose the receiver resistance R so that it is equal to the internal resistance R0
of the EMF source E.
Indeed, the power delivered by the receiver is equal to P = RI2, where I =
E
R + R0
.
Therefore,
P =
RE2
(R + R0)2 .
Let us analyze this formula. If R = 0, then P = 0; if R = ∞, then P = 0. Therefore, the
function P = P(R) has an extremum. One can show that this function attains its maximum
for R = R0. The corresponding power delivered by the receiver is calculated as
Pmax = RI2
C =
R0E2
(R0 + R0)2 = E2
4R0
,
and the power delivered by the source is equal to
PE = EIC = E
E
R0 + R0
= E2
2R0
.
The source efﬁciency factor in this operation mode is equal to
η = Pmax
PE
= 0.5;
i.e., 50% of energy the source is transferred to the receiver, and the other 50% are lost in
the source itself (due to its internal resistance).
The consistent mode is admissible and desirable in systems of telemechanics, automat-
ics, telephony, etc., where it is necessary to distinguish the maximal possible power Pmax in
the receiver; the 50% losses in the source can be neglected, because the power consumption
in such systems is small of the order of several watts.
In power-supply systems, such an operation mode is impossible, because the powers of
the energy sources is of the order of megawatts (MW) and the 50% losses in the sources are
extremely large.

E6.2.4. Theorem on Active Impedor (Two-Terminal Network) and Its
Application
◮Theorem on active impedor. The electric circuit (Fig. E6.8) can be divided into two
parts: the ﬁrst contains a branch (e.g., resistance R) in which it is required to ﬁnd the
current I, the second—i.e., the other part of the circuit—contains an active impedor.
The theorem on an active impedor can be formulated as follows: if the active circuit
with a branch connected to it is replaced by a source with EMF E equal to the voltage at
the terminals of the opened branch and with the resistance equal to the input resistance of
active circuit, then the current in this branch does not change.
An active impedor with respect to the resistance R can be treated as an equivalent
generator with EMF E and the internal resistance R0, which permits determining the
current ﬂowing through the resistance R as follows: I = E/(R + R0).
Sometimes, the theorem on active impedor is also called the equivalent generator method
or the open-circuit and short-circuit method, the latter name explains the essence of this
method.
The unknown values of EMF E and the internal resistance R0 of an equivalent generator
can easily be determined by open circuit and short circuit tests. From the open circuit test
we determined U∗and the equivalent generator EMF E = U∗.
The impedor internal resistance can be determined in the following two ways. First,
one can calculate the resistance of the entire electrical circuit without the resistor R with
respect to the terminals of the active impedor for the bridged EMF sources E with their
internal resistances taken into account and for the open current sources. Second, one can
ﬁrst ﬁnd the short circuit current by setting that the resistance R is zero and then determine
the internal resistance by the formula R0 = E/I′.
◮Example of applying the theorem on active impedor. We illustrate the use of the
theorem on active impedor by an example for the network shown in Fig. E6.8a. In this
network, we choose the positive direction of the desired current I1. Then we consider the
network part connected to the ﬁrst branch under study (enclosed in the dashed line) as an
active impedor with EMF E∗and internal resistance R0 (see Fig. E6.8b). In the network,
the direction of EMF E∗to point A is chosen arbitrarily; then UAB = E∗. The full-scale
network in open circuit mode is shown in Fig. E6.8c.
In the impedor internal branches, the current is calculated by the formula
I∗=
E2
R2 + R3 + R02
.
The open-circuit voltage determines the EMF of the active impedor as follows:
UAB = E∗= R3I∗.
To calculate the impedor internal resistance, we transform the network replacing the
source E2 by a short-circuited part (see Fig. E6.8d). The network input resistance is the
internal resistance of the active impedor:
R0 = (R2 + R02)R3
R2 + R3 + R02
.
Returning to the original network, we determine the desired current by Ohm’s law:
I1 =
E∗+ E1
R1 + R01 + R0
.

principle) says that the network part ab with voltage Uab can be replaced by an equivalent
EMF source E = Uab whose direction is opposite to the positive direction of the voltage
Uab (see Fig. E6.9). In this case, the current distribution in the network does not change.

877
The current compensation theorem (current compensation principle) says that the net-
work part ab with current Iab can be replaced by an equivalent current source J = Iab whose
direction coincides with the positive direction of the current Iab.
◮Linearity theorem and reciprocity theorem.
Linearity theorem: if, in any linear
electric circuit, there are variations in the EMF E or in the resistance, then any two
quantities (currents or voltages) for any two branches of this circuit are related by the linear
expression y = a + bx, where x is the current or voltage in one branch, and y, in the other
branch. If, in the network, the EMF or the resistance vary simultaneously in two branches,
then any three quantities in the network (currents or voltages) are related by the linear
expression: y = a + bx + cz.
The coefﬁcients a, b, and c can be determined experimentally or can be calculated.
So, for example, as the EMF Em varies in any mth branch, the currents Ik and Ip in any
kth and any pth branches are related by the linear expression Ik = ak+bkIp. According to the
compensation theorem, any branch can be replaced by an appropriately chosen EMF; hence
the variation in the resistance in the mth branch also results in variations in the currents
and voltages in the branches, and there exists linear relations between these currents. The
coefﬁcients ak and bk can be determined if the values of the voltages and currents are known
in the branches under study for two operation modes in the circuit.
Reciprocity theorem: in any electric circuit, the current Ik in the kth branch caused by
the EMF Em located in the mth branch is equal to the current Im in the mth branch caused
by the EMF Ek located in the kth branch if Em = Ek.
E6.2.6. Equivalent Transformations in Electrical Networks
◮Preliminary remarks.
The analysis of a complicated electric circuit can often be
simpliﬁed by replacing a group of resistive elements in its equivalent circuit with an equiv-
alent group where the resistive elements are connected in a different way. An expedient
transformation of electrical networks leads to a decrease in the number of its branches or
nodes and hence in the number of equations determining its electric state. In all cases of
replacement of electrical networks by equivalent networks of different form, it is necessary
to ensure that the currents and voltages remain unchanged in the network parts that remain
untransformed.
◮Series and parallel connection of resistors. The series connection of resistors is a
connection such that the current ﬂowing through the resistors is one and the same. For
one and the same current to ﬂow through the receivers connected in series, it is necessary
that there be no electrical nodes at the points of their connection. Then the equivalent
resistance R for N resistors connected in series is determined as
R = R1 + R2 + · · · + RN.
(E6.2.6.1)
The parallel connection of resistors is a connection such that the voltage at the resistor
terminals (points of connection) is one and the same. For one and the same voltage to be at
the terminals of the resistors, it is necessary that they have a single common input (node)
and a single common output (node).
For N resistors connected in parallel, we have

R1 + R2
(two parallel resistors),
R =
R1R2R3
R1R2 + R1R3 + R2R3
(three parallel resistors).

sum of resistances of all branches in the ∆-network.

g1 + g2 + g3

g23 =

g1 + g2 + g3
,
g23 =

Thus, the conductance of each branch in the equivalent ∆-network is equal to the product
of conductances of the Y-network rays adjacent to the same terminals divided by the sum
of conductances of all rays.
E6.2.7. Application of Equivalent Transformations in Network
Analysis. Convolution Method
It is convenient to use the method of equivalent transformations mainly for networks with
a single energy source, provided that the energy source voltage does not change after the
transformation. The convolution method is reduced to the transformation of the electric
circuit into the simplest network with a single source and a single equivalent receiver; then
the backward calculations are performed.

E6.2. LINEAR CIRCUITS OF DIRECT CURRENT
879
We illustrate the convolution method by an example of the network given in Fig. E6.11.
First, we arbitrarily choose the direction of unknown currents I1, I2, I34. The resistors with
resistances R3 andR4 connectedinseries are replacedby a resistor with equivalent resistance
R34 by the formula R34 = R3 + R4. We transform the original network (Fig. E6.11a) into
an equivalent network (Fig. E6.11b). The resistors with resistances R2 and R34 connected
in parallel are replaced by a resistor with equivalent resistance R234 by the formula
R234 =
R2R34
R2 + R34
.
We replace the transformed network (Fig. E6.11b) by an equivalent network (Fig. E6.11c).
It follows from Fig. E6.11c that the resistors with resistances R1 and R234 are connected in
series. Therefore, the resistance equivalent to them is calculated by the formula
R′ = R1 + R234.
Thus, after the above transformations, the original network (Fig. E6.11a) is transformed
into an equivalent network (Fig. E6.11d).

E6.2.8. Superposition Principle. The Notion of Input and Transfer
Conductances (Admittances)
◮Superposition principle. Input and transfer conductances. The following superpo-
sition principle holds for linear electric circuits: the current in any branch is equal to the
algebraic sum of currents in this branch (partial currents) under the separate action of each
source if the other sources are replaced by resistors with resistances equal to the internal
resistances of the corresponding sources. An analog of such a principle can be found in
mechanics, where the motion of a body under the action of several forces can be considered
as a result of addition of actions caused by each separate force.
In the equivalent circuit with m branches, the current in each nth branch is equal to
the algebraic sum of partial currents caused by each of the EMF and each of the current
sources.
For a network without any current source, one can write an equation for the current in
any nth branch of the linear electric circuit in the form
In = E1g1n + E2G2n + · · · + Emgmn
(n ≤m).
In this equation, the factors multipying the EMF have the dimension of conductances.
Therefore, each of the factors with two equal indices gnn can be called the input conductance
of branch n, and any of the factors with two distinct indices gmn can be called the transfer
conductance of the branches n and m.
The numerical values of the input and transfer conductances of branches can be calcu-
lated as follows. We equate all the EMF Em with zero except for En.
Then In = Engnn, whence gnn = In/En. Therefore, the input conductance of any
branch is determined by the current to EMF ratio in this branch provided that the EMF are
zero in the other branches. The value of the current in branch m can be determined if we
equate all the EMF with zero except for En. Then Im = Emngmn, whence gmn = Im/En.
Therefore, the transfer conductance of any two branches is determined by the ratio of the
current in one branch to the EMF in the other branch provided that the EMF in the other
branches are zero.
The input conductance of a branch has a positive value, because it was assumed that we
choose the same direction for the current and for the source EMF. The transfer conductance
of two branches can take positive and negative values, and moreover, gmn = gnm, which
means that the reciprocity principle is satisﬁed.
◮Electrical networks illustrating the superposition principle. As an example, consider
the network in Fig. E6.12a.
The currents in branches are equal to the sum of partial currents in the networks; see

where R = √R1R2 + R1R3 + R2R3.
In the equivalent circuits with current sources, the partial currents of branches are
determined from each of them by eliminating the other current sources by disconnecting
the branches containing them.
E6.2.9. Concise Methods for Analyzing Electric Circuits
◮Mesh-current method. The mesh-current method is based on Kirchhoff’s laws and is
most convenient for analyzing electric circuits where the number of independent loops is
less than the number of electrical nodes.
When solving the problems, it is assumed that, in the independent loops of the electric
circuit, there are their own currents, which are denoted for the ﬁrst, second, etc. loops,
respectively.
Then the linear equations for the chosen unknown loop (ﬁctitious) currents can be com-
posed according to Kirchhoff’s second law. The number of the composed independent linear
equations must correspond to the number of unknown loop currents. When constructing the
equations, ﬁrst, one must compose the simplest independent equations, and second, each
subsequent equation must contain at least one branch that does not enter the loops already
used. Solving the obtained system of equations for the unknown loop currents, one can
determine the unknown (actual) currents.
In the general case, for a network with n independent loops, the system of equations of
the mesh-current method can be written as
R11I11 + R12I12 + · · · + R1nInn = E11,
R21I11 + R22I12 + · · · + R2nInn = E22,
· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ,
Rn1I11 + Rn2I12 + · · · + RnnInn = Enn.
(E6.2.9.1)
The solution of this system for loop currents can, for example, be found by the Cramer
method (see Section M5.3).
Example. We illustrate the use of the mesh-current method by the example of the electrical network shown
in Fig. E6.13.
We have the system of equations
(R1 + R4)I11 – R4I22 = E1,
–R4I11 + (R3 + R4 + R5)I22 – R3I33 = E3 + E5,
–R3I22 + (R2 + R3)I33 = –E2 – E3.
(E6.2.9.2)
We denote
R11 = R1 + R4,
R22 = R3 + R4 + R5,
R33 = R2 + R3,
R12 = R21 = –R4,
R32 = R23 = –R3,
E11 = E1,
E22 = E3 + E5,
E33 = –E2 – E3.

882
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
As a result, system (E6.2.9.2) takes the standard form (E6.2.9.1):
R11I11 + R12I22 = E11,
R21I11 + R22I22 + R23I33 = E22,
R32I22 + R33I33 = E33.
Determining the loop currents from this system, we can readily ﬁnd the actual currents in the circuit by the
formulas
I1 = I11,
I2 = –I33,
I3 = I22 – I33,
I4 = I22 – I11,
I5 = I22.

◮Node-potential method. The operation mode of any circuit is completely characterized
by the equations constructed on the basis of Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst and second laws, and to
determine the currents in all branches, it is necessary to compose and solve a system with
the same number of unknowns (unknown node potentials). But the number of equations to
be solved can be decreased by using the node-potential method based on the application of
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law and the generalized Ohm law.
To explain the essence of the method, consider the electrical network shown in
Fig. E6.14.
Assume that the potential of one of the nodes, for example, of the third,
is zero, ϕ3 = 0. Then for nodes 1 and 2 we compose the following equations according to
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law:
I5 – I4 – I1 + I6 = 0,
–I5 – I6 – I2 + I3 = 0.
(E6.2.9.3)
The currents in the branches can be determined by using Ohm’s law:
I6 = (ϕ1 – ϕ2)g6,
I1 = (–ϕ1 + E1)g1,
I4 = (–ϕ1)g4,
I5 = (ϕ1 – ϕ2 + E5)g5,
I2 = (–ϕ2 + E2)g2,
I3 = (ϕ2 + E3)g3,
(E6.2.9.4)
where ϕ1 and ϕ2 are the potentials of the ﬁrst and second nodes. Substituting the expressions
(E6.2.9.4) for the currents into (E6.2.9.3), we obtain
ϕ1(g1 + g4 + g5 + g6) – ϕ2(g5 + g6) = E1g1 – E5g5,
–ϕ1(g5 + g6) + ϕ2(g2 + g3 + g5 + g6) = E1g1 – E3g3 + E5g5,
or
ϕ1g11 – ϕ2g12 = E1g1 – E5g5,
–ϕ1g21 + ϕ2g22 = E1g1 – E3g3 + E5g5.

Figure E6.14. Electrical network illustrating the node-potential method.
Here g11 = g1 + g4 + g5 + g6 and g22 = g2 + g3 + g5 + g6 are the sums of conductances of the
branches adjacent to the ﬁrst and second nodes, respectively, and g12 = g21 = g5 + g6 is the
sum of conductances of the branches connecting these nodes.
The right-hand side of the last equation is an algebraic sum of products of the EMF E of
sources by the conductances of the branches connected to the node of interest. This product
is taken with the plus sign if the EMF E is directed towards the node and with the minus
sign if the EMF E is directed from the node. (The positive direction of an EMF source is
from minus to plus.)
It is remarkable that the current directions in the branches need not be taken into account
when composing the equations.
◮Nodal-pair method. The nodal-pair method is based on the generalized Ohm law and
Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law and is used to calculate the electric circuits with two nodes (i.e., electric
circuits with branches connected in parallel). When solving the problems by this method,
one ﬁrst determines the voltage between the two nodes by the formula:
U12 =
P giEi + P Jk
P gj
where gi are the electric conductances of the corresponding branches, Jk are the values
of currents from the current sources, and giEi is the product of electric conductance of a
branch by the EMF E of the same branch, which is taken with sign “+” if the EMF E is
directed towards node 1; otherwise, the sign “–” is taken.
After the voltage drop between two nodes is determined, one calculates the unknown
currents by the generalized Ohm law.
Example. We illustrate the use of the nodal-pair method by anthe example of the electrical network shown
in Fig. E6.15.
The voltage between two nodes is equal to
U12 = E1g1 – E2g4 + J
g1 + g2 + g4
,
where g1 = 1/R1, g2 = 1/(R2 + R3), and g3 = 1/R4.
◮Proportional parts method. Sometimes, the currents in a circuit containing only one
source can be found in a relatively simple way by using the proportional parts method.
The essence of this method is that in one of the branches, usually in the most remote

from the energy source, an arbitrary value of the current strength is assumed, usually equal
to 1 A. Then, starting from this current, one calculates the currents and voltages in the other
branches, as a rule, by using Ohm’s law; these calculations are performed until the energy
source voltage corresponding to the accepted values of currents in branches is found. After
this, the coefﬁcient of proportionality between the actual voltage UF and the calculated
source voltage U′ is derived: k = UF /U′. To determine the true values of currents in all
the branches, one must multiply the current values obtained earlier by the proportionality
coefﬁcient k: Im = kI′

E6.3. Nonlinear Electric Circuits of Direct Current
E6.3.1. Notion of a Nonlinear Element. Several Typical
Characteristics of Nonlinear Elements
◮Nonlinear elements and their characteristics. The electric circuits used in automatics,
telemechanics, measurement and computation technology often contain separate passive
elements whose electric resistance depends on the value and direction of the ﬂowing current
or the applied voltage. Such elements and the electric circuits containing them are said to
be nonlinear and are used to determine certain functional dependencies between different
electric quantities.
The nonlinear elements can be uncontrolled or controlled. The ﬁrst ones, impedors, are
intended to operate without any actions on them from a controlled factor; the second ones,
multiterminal devices, are used under the action of controlled factor on them (transistors,
thyristors, etc.).
The electric properties of nonlinear elements are represented by their volt-ampere char-
acteristics (VACh) I = f(U). In the uncontrolled nonlinear elements, the VACh is shown by
a single curve, and in the controlled, by a family of curves whose parameter is the control
factor. The VACh of nonlinear elements have different shapes and, according to this, can
be divided into symmetric and nonsymmetric. The electric resistance of linear elements is
constant and the VACh is a straight line passing through the origin (Fig. E6.16.).
In symmetric nonlinear elements, a change in the direction of the applied voltage U
does not change the value of the current I, but changes its direction, and hence the relation
f(U) = –f(–U) holds for their VACh (Fig. E6.17a).
In nonsymmetric nonlinear elements, for the same magnitude of the voltage U applied
in the opposite directions, the currents I1 and I2 are different in values and the inequality
f(U) ≠–f(–U) holds for VACh (Fig. E6.17b).
◮Static and differential resistances of a nonlinear element. For eachnonlinear element,
the static resistance RC corresponding to a given VACh point can be distinguished.
It follows from Fig. E6.18 that the value of this resistance for point A is proportional to
the tangent of the angle β between the straight line connecting point A with the origin and

where mU, mI, and mR are the voltage, current, and resistance scales, respectively.
The limit of the ratio of the voltage increment on the circuit part to the current increment
on it, or the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current, determines the differential
resistance. The value of this resistance is proportional to the tangent of the angle α between
the tangent to VACh at the same point A and the axis of currents, i.e.,

deviations from the steady state.
Consider a closed circuit consisting of a nonlinear element and an active impedor with

E6.3.2. Equivalent Transformations of Characteristics of Nonlinear
Elements
If the VACh of a nonlinear element on the operation segment is practically linear, then,
in calculation, the nonlinear element can replaced by an equivalent network consisting of
a voltage source and a linear resistance RD. So, for example, the VACh of a nonlinear
element shown in Fig. E6.20 on small parts near the operation point A can be replaced by
the straight line whose equation has the form
U1 = E1 + mR tan α1 I
or
U1 = E1 + RD1I.

an element are shown in Figs. E6.21b and c. In this case, the EMF E1 is opposite to the
current I, because only in the case of this EMF direction the potential of point 1 exceeds

axis of currents by the continuation of the tangent.
If a nonlinear element has the VACh shown in Fig. E6.22, then Eq. (E6.3.2.1) has the
form
U2 = –E2 + mR tan α2 I
or
U2 = –E2 + RD2I.
If the current and voltage of a nonlinear element have the same positive directions
(Fig. E6.21a), then the directions of the EMF and of the current in the current source are
changed to the opposite in the equivalent networks.

E6.3.3. Graphical Method for Analyzing Circuits with Nonlinear
Elements
◮Preliminary remarks. Nonlinear electric circuits are often analyzed by the graphical
method based on Kirchhoff’s laws and the VACh of some elements contained in the electric
circuit. The initial data for calculations (VACh) are given in the form of graphs and tables.
Remark. In the case of nonlinear circuits, one cannot use the theorems and methods based on the
assumption that all the elements contained in these circuits are linear. So the superposition principle cannot be
used in nonlinear circuits. The linearity theorem, the reciprocity theorem, and the proportional parts method
also cannot be used.
We consider several problems with different versions of connection of nonlinear ele-
ments in nonlinear circuits whose networks are shown in Fig. E6.23.

◮Series connection of nonlinear elements. Figure E6.23a shows the series connection
of two nonlinear elements R1(I1) and R2(I2) whose VACh are given in Fig. E6.24. It is
required to determine the current I and the voltages U1 and U2 of elements for a given
voltage U at the circuit terminals.

To calculate the current I and the voltages U1 and U2, one must construct an auxiliary
characteristic, namely, the dependence of the current on the total voltage U1 + U2. Since,
just as in an unbranched circuit, the current is the same in both nonlinear elements, it follows
that, to construct the characteristic I(U1 + U2), it is necessary to sum the voltages U1 and
U2 for equal values of the current I.

We put the voltage U on the abscissa axis and, from point A, draw the straight line AB

line BC parallel to the ordinate axis. As a result, we obtain segments CD and CF equal in
scale to U1 and U2, respectively. Similarly, we can solve the problem of analyzing a circuit
consisting of three or more elements with nonlinear characteristics connected in series.
The graphical constructions for analyzing a series circuit can be performed differently.
We assume that, in Fig. E6.23a, the ends of a circuit part are connected by the EMF source
E = U. The voltage U2 at the terminals of a nonlinear element R2(I2) is determined, on
one hand, by the VACh of this element, and, on the other hand, by the difference between
the EMF E = U and the voltage U1 at the terminals of the nonlinear element R1(I1).
Figure E6.25 presents the characteristic and the curves I2(U2) and I1(U – U2) at whose
point of intersection the currents in the elements coincide.

and, by the formula I1 + I2 = I, the current in the unbranched part of the circuit.

If a current I is given, then, to determine the voltage U and the currents I1 and I2 in
nonlinear elements, one must construct the auxiliary quantity (I1+I2)U, i.e., the dependence
of the total current on the voltage U. Since, in parallel connection, U1 = U2 = U, it follows
that, to construct this quantity, it is necessary to sum the ordinates of the curves I1(U1) and
I2(U2) for the same values of the voltage. Then, on the ordinate axis, we put the interval
OC equal in scale to the current I and, from point C, draw the straight line CB parallel

to the abscissa axis till the intersection with the characteristic (I1 + I2)U. The segment
CB = OA thus obtained is equal in scale to the voltage U. Finally, the segments AD and
AF are equal in scale to the currents I1 and I2.
◮Mixed connection of nonlinear elements. In Figs. E6.23c and d, we show the mixed
connection of nonlinear elements (c) and of nonlinear and linear elements (d). To determine
the desired currents and voltages, one can also use the graphical method by analogy with
calculations of series and parallel circuits.
E6.4. Magnetic Circuits
A set of devices containing ferromagnetic bodies and forming a closed circuit in which
a magnetic ﬂux is formed in the presence of a magnetizing force and along which the
magnetic ﬂux lines close up, is called a magnetic circuit. The magnetic circuits, just as the
electric circuits, can be branched and unbranched.
E6.4.1. Magnetic Field and Its Parameters
◮Magnetic induction vector. The magnetic ﬁeld arising when a direct current ﬂows
through a conducting medium is graphically shown by magnetic lines of force and is
characterized at each point by the magnetic induction vector B directed along the tangent
to the ﬁeld lines (Fig. E6.27).
I
A
H
B
Figure E6.27. Magnetic ﬁeld of a rectilinear conductor and an induction coil.
The direction of this vector is determined by the right-hand screw rule (corkscrew rule),
which means that if the translational motion of such a screw is aligned in direction with
the electric current I, then the direction of its rotational motion coincides with that of the
magnetic induction vector B.
If the magnetic induction B has the same value and direction at all points of the ﬁeld,
then such a ﬁeld is said to be uniform or homogeneous.
In the international system of units, or the SI system, the magnetic induction (ﬂux
density) B is measured in teslas (T) or webers per square meter (Wb/m2).

E6.4. MAGNETIC CIRCUITS
891
◮Magnetic ﬂux. The second important quantity characterizing the magnetic ﬁeld is the
magnetic ﬂux Φ, i.e., the ﬂux of the magnetic induction vector B through a surface S
(Fig. E6.28a):
Φ =

B ⋅dS =

If a magnetic ﬁeld is uniform (homogeneous), then, for all points of space, the magnetic
induction vector is constant, B = const, and the magnetic ﬂux is determined by the formula
(Fig. E6.28b):
Φ = BS cos α.
(E6.4.1.1)
In SI, the magnetic ﬂux is measured in webers (Wb).
◮Magnetic ﬁeld strength vector. Absolute and relative magnetic permeability. When
studying magnetic ﬁelds and analyzing magnetic devices, one uses the magnetic ﬁeld
strength (intensity) vector H, which coincides in direction with the magnetic induction
vector B:
B = µaH = µµ0H,
where µa is the absolute magnetic permeability of the medium, µ0 = 4π ⋅10–7 H/m
(henry/meter) is the magnetic constant (permeability of vacuum), and µ is the (relative)
magnetic permeability.
For nonferromagnetic materials and media (wood, paper, copper, aluminum, air), µa
does not practically differ from µ0 (µ = 1).
For ferromagnetic materials (steel, cast iron, etc.), µa is many times larger than µ0 and
depends on the value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength H.
In SI system, the magnetic ﬁeld strength H is measured in amperes per meter (A/m).
E6.4.2. Amp`ere’s Circuital Law
The calculations of magnetic circuits are based on Amp`ere’s circuital law, which was
obtained on the basis of numerous experiments. This law states that the linear integral of
the magnetic ﬁeld strength vector along any loop is equal to the total current surrounded by
this loop (algebraic sum of currents related to the loop):
I
H ⋅dl =
I
H cos α dl =

Ik,
where H is the magnetic ﬁeld strength at a given point in space, H = |H|, dl is a length
element of the closed loop, and cos α is the angle between the directions of the vectors H
and dl.

892
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The currents are assumed to be positive if their direction corresponds to the corkscrew
rule (is clockwise).
In particular, according to Amp`ere’s circuital law, for the loop in Fig. E6.29, we have

The quantity P Ik is called the magnetomotive force (MMF); in the SI system, the main
unit of MMF is ampere (A). The main unit of the magnetic ﬁeld strength in SI system is
ampere per meter (A/m) and does not have any special name. One often uses the “ampere
per centimeter” unit, 1 A/cm = 100 A/m.
E6.4.3. Ohm’s Law for Magnetic Circuit
To obtain the dependence between the magnetic ﬂux and the MMF, we consider an example
of unbranched circuit shown in Fig. E6.30.
We assume that the parts l1 and l2 of the magnetic circuit are made of the same
ferromagnetic material but have different transverse cross-sections S1 and S2.

H dl = H1l1 + H2l2 = Iw,
(E6.4.3.2)
where w is the number of turns of the current loop. In this equation, by analogy with the
EMF of an electric circuit, F = Iw is called the magnetomotive force or MMF.

The quantity l/(µaS) = Rm is usually called the magnetic resistance of a magnetic
circuit (by analogy with the electric resistance R = l/γS).
The magnetic resistance of air (gaps) is linear, because µa = µ0 = const. The magnetic
resistance of the core is nonlinear, because µa depends on B.
The product of the magnetic ﬂux Φ by the magnetic resistance RM is called, by analogy
with electric circuit, the magnetic voltage:
UMab = ΦRM1,
whence we obtain the magnetic ﬂux
Φ =

This equation is usually called Ohm’s law for a magnetic circuit. It should be noted that
this analogy is purely formal, and the physical essence of processes in electric and magnetic
circuits is different.
E6.4.4. Ferromagnetic Materials and Their Properties
◮Ferromagnetic materials. Hysteresis loop. It is known that the magnetic permeability
of ferromagnetic materials is a variable quantity and depends on B, and hence the magnetic
resistance RM is also nonconstant, which signiﬁcantly complicates the calculations of
magnetic circuits. Therefore, to calculate the magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic parts, it
is necessary to know the magnetization curves, which present the dependence B = f(H).
These dependencies are obtained experimentally by testing closed magnetic circuits with
distributed winding.

Figure E6.31. Dependence B = B(H) and the hysteresis loop.
The primary magnetization of a specimen is described by the curve µ, which is called
the curve of primary magnetization (Fig. E6.31).
If a specimen is cyclically magnetized with the magnetic ﬁeld strength varying in the
limits from Hx to –Hx, then the graph is a closed curve, which is known as the hysteresis
loop.
If the process of cyclic magnetization is repeated for gradually increasing values of the
magnetic ﬁeld strength, then one can obtain a family of hysteresis loops and the so-called
limit hysteresis loop.
To the limit loop there corresponds a variation in the magnetic ﬁeld strength in the limits
from Hmax to –Hmax. Any increase in H beyond Hmax does not increase the hysteresis
loop area. Such a hysteresis loop determines the value of the residual magnetic induction.
The curve connecting the vertices of a hysteresis loops is called the normal magnetization
curve. These curves are given in reference books and are used to analyze magnetic circuits.
◮Soft magnetic and hard magnetic materials. The process of cyclic magnetization
reversal requires some energy, which is proportional to the hysteresis loop area.
In this connection, for the magnetic circuits in electrical engineering devices operating
under conditions of uninterrupted magnetization reversal (for example, transformers) it is
expedient to use ferromagnetic materials with a narrow hysteresis loop (see curves α in
Fig. E6.32). Such ferromagnetic materials are said to be soft magnetic (electrical grade
sheet and several special alloys, for example, permalloy consisting of nickel, iron, and other
components).
In production of permanent magnets, it is recommended to use ferromagnetic materials
with a wide hysteresis loop (curves δ), which have a large residual induction.
Such
ferromagnetic materials are said to be hard magnetic (several alloys of iron with wolfram,
chrome, and aluminum).
E6.4.5. Kirchhoff’s Laws for Magnetic Circuits
◮Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law for magnetic circuits. The magnetic ﬂux Φ completely closed
by a magnetic circuit is called the main ﬂux, and the magnetic ﬂux closed partially by parts
of a magnetic circuit and partially by the environment is called the leakage ﬂux.
It is well known that the lines of the magnetic induction vector are closed. Therefore,
the magnetic ﬂux through any closed surface is always zero. Hence, the following equation
holds for nodes of magnetic circuits:
X
Φk = 0.

In this equation, the positive signs are taken for the ﬂuxes with the positive direction
away from the node, and negative signs are taken for the ﬂuxes with direction towards the
node of the magnetic circuit (or vice versa), just by analogy with Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law for
direct current circuits.
Equation (E6.4.5.1) expresses Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law for magnetic circuits: the algebraic
sum of magnetic ﬂuxes at a node of a magnetic circuit is zero.
◮Kirchhoff’s second law for magnetic circuits. Using Amp`ere’s circuital law, one
can obtain an equation by analogy with Kirchhoff’s second law for electric circuits. In
Fig. E6.33, we show a branched magnetic circuit. This circuit consists of six unbranched
parts and has the same number of distinct magnetic ﬂuxes. Each part of the magnetic circuit
is made of the same material with constant transverse cross-section on its entire length. But
different parts of this circuit can be produced of different ferromagnetic materials and can
have different transverse cross-sections. Neglecting the leakage ﬂuxes and assuming that
the lengths of the parts signiﬁcantly exceed their transverse dimensions, we can determine
the magnetic inductions.

The magnetic ﬁeld strengths on these parts of the magnetic circuit can be found from
the magnetization curves under the obtained values of the magnetic induction. We apply

i.e., the algebraic sum of MMF in a loop of a magnetic circuit is equal to the algebraic sum
of magnetic voltages in the same loop.
Here it should be specially noted that the resistance of any part of the magnetic circuit
cannot usually be considered as a constant variable because of the dependence of the
magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials on the induction. Therefore, the analysis
of magnetic circuits is similar to the analysis of electric circuits with nonlinear VACh.
E6.4.6. Analysis of an Unbranched Magnetic Circuit
When analyzing an unbranched magnetic circuits, we encounter problems of two types.
In some problems, it is necessary to determine the magnetizing current from a given
magnetic ﬂux, in other problems, the ﬂux from a given current or a given MMF. In both
cases, as a rule, the geometric dimensions of all parts of magnetic circuits, the material
of which they are produced, the normal magnetization curves or hysteresis loops, and
the number of turns of the induction coil are given. In magnetic circuits composed of
soft magnetic materials, hysteresis can usually be neglected; i.e., one can assume that the
dependence of the induction on the magnetic ﬁeld strength is unique and determined by the
normal magnetization curve.
◮First problem for unbranched magnetic circuits. Consider the unbranched magnetic
circuit shown in Fig. E6.34, which consists of a π-shaped electromagnetic core and a steel
plate closing its terminals. There is an air gap between the electromagnetic core terminals
and the plate. It is required to determine the magnetizing current at which the magnetic ﬂux
in the air gap has a prescribed value. The electromagnet cross-section is S1, and the plate
cross-section is S2.

E6.4. MAGNETIC CIRCUITS

Under these conditions, we represent an entire magnetic circuit as three parts connected
in series: the electromagnetic core, two air gaps, and the steel plate with the same ﬂux Φ.
To calculate the magnetic circuit, we determine the lengths of separate parts of the magnetic
circuit: l1, l2, 2l3. For small dimensions of the core transverse cross-sections compared
with their length, small inaccuracies in determining the center lengths of the circuit parts
do not lead to signiﬁcant calculational errors. The exact calculations of the magnetic ﬂux
distribution in the air gap is a difﬁcult problem, but if the gap length is small and the plane
of the ferromagnetic bodies surrounding the gap are parallel, then one can assume that
the magnetic ﬁeld in the gap is homogeneous and its cross-section S3 is equal to the core
cross-section S1.
We represent the unbranched magnetic circuit as an equivalent network consisting of
three series connected resistances RM1, RM2, RM3, and MMF F = Iw (Fig. E6.35a). In
this scheme, the resistances RM1 and RM2 depend on the magnetic ﬂux, and the resistance
RM3 is a constant quantity. According to Kirchhoff’s second law for magnetic circuit, we
have
F = Iw = H1l1 + H2l2 + 2H3l3.
The magnetic inductions B1, B2, B3 are determined by a given value of the magnetic
ﬂux by formula (E6.4.1.1)

From the obtained values B1 and B2 of the magnetic induction and the normal magneti-
zation curves for the corresponding materials, we determine the magnetic ﬁeld strengths H1
and H2. For the air gap, we have H3 = B3/µ0. The magnetizing current is calculated as
I = Iw
w = H1l1 + H2l2 + 2H2l3
w
.
◮Second problem for unbranched magnetic circuits.
Now we consider the same
magnetic circuit for which it is required to determine the magnetic ﬂux from a given value
of MMF. In contrast to the preceding problem, this problem does not have a “direct” solution
because of the nonlinear relation between the ﬂux and the magnetizing current.
Such a solution can be obtained, for example, by the following method.
First, we
prescribe a value of the magnetic ﬂux, for example, Φ′. Then, just as in the preceding
problem, we ﬁnd the MMF F ′ = I′w = P(Hklk)′. If the obtained value of MMF coincides
with the given F = Iw, then the problem is solved. But such a coincidence is usually not
obtained after the ﬁrst attempt. Therefore, we must prescribe other values of the magnetic
ﬂux Φ′′, Φ′′′, etc. and then ﬁnd the corresponding values F ′′, F ′′′, etc. and construct the
auxiliary characteristic Φ = Φ(P Hklk) shown in Fig. E6.35b.
Then we put the value of the given MMF F = Iw (point a) on the abscissa axis and
draw a straight line from this point parallel to the ordinate axis till the intersection with the

898
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
curve Φ(P Hklk) at point b. As a result, we obtain segment ab determining the desired
value of the magnetic ﬂux.
It is necessary to point out that, in practical calculations, it does not make any sense to
construct the entire curve Φ(P Hklk) starting from the zero value of the magnetic ﬂux. To
obtain the ﬁrst point of the curve, we must equate the given MMF with the magnetic voltage
on the site with maximal magnetic resistance RMΦ′ = Iw and, using the magnetization
curve, determine the maximal ﬂux Φ′ from this equation.
If there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit, then most often the gap is the site with
maximal magnetic resistance. For the air gap, in the case of the circuit in Fig. E6.34, the
last equation can be written as
2l3
µ0S3
Φ′ = Iw
or
Φ′ = µ0S3Iw
2l3
.
Since the other parts of the same unbranched magnetic circuit, just as the part with maximal
magnetic resistance, bound the magnetic ﬂux, its subsequent values necessary to construct
the curve Φ(P Hklk) must be taken less than Φ′.
Since the magnetic ﬂux is the same in all parts of the unbranched magnetic circuit, the
quantity Φ(P Hklk) can be constructed by analogy with the unbranched electric circuit by
graphical summation of the abscissas of the straight line Φ(2H3l3) and the curves Φ(H1l1)
and Φ(H2l2) for the same values of the magnetic ﬂux. The quantity Φ(2H3l3) is described by
the straight line passing through the origin. Its construction becomes easier if the magnetic
ﬁeld strength H3 is found for each value of Φ, H3 = Φ/(µ0S3).
The quantities Φ(H1l1) and Φ(H2l2) are constructed by using the normal magnetization
curves for the materials of the ﬁrst and second parts of the magnetizing circuit. For this, it
is necessary to multiply the ordinates of the magnetization curves by the respective cross-
sections of the ﬁrst and second parts (Φ = BS) and to multiply the abscissas by their lengths
(Hl).
E6.4.7. Analysis of a Branched Magnetic Circuit
Analysis of branched magnetic circuits is based on the use of Kirchhoff’s laws for magnetic
circuits.
Because of a nonlinear relation between the induction and the magnetic ﬁeld
strength for ferromagnetic materials, the analysis of such circuits is often performed by
graphic-analytical methods by analogy with methods used to analyze nonlinear electric
circuits.
When analyzing a magnetic circuit, just as in the case of an electric circuit, it is necessary
to prescribe the positive direction of MMF and of magnetic ﬂuxes (if they are not already
given).
In Fig. E6.36, we present an example of a branched magnetic circuit with a single MMF
and its equivalent network.

For such a magnetic circuit, “direct” computations are possible if the center rod has the
same cross-section along the entire length and is produced of the same material as the other
rods. The magnetic ﬂux Φ3 in the air gap must also be given.
From the already known magnetic ﬂux Φ3, we calculate the induction B1 = Φ/S′
1; from
the magnetization curve, we ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld strength H3 and the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in the air gap. The magnetic voltage in the third branch, i.e., between the nodes a
and b, is determined as
UMab =
X
Hklk = H3(l′
3 + l′′
3) + H4l4.
Since the secondandthirdbranches are connected inparallel, it follows that UMab =H2l2.
After H2 is computed, we ﬁnd B2 from the magnetization curve. The ﬂuxes are calculated
as follows: Φ2 = B2S2, Φ1 = Φ2 + Φ3. We determine the ﬂux Φ1, calculate the magnetic
induction B1, and then ﬁnd the magnetic ﬁeld strength H1 from the magnetization curve.
According to Kirchhoff’s second law, we have
F = Iw = H1l1 + UMab.
A more general problem of calculating all ﬂuxes for a given MMF can be solved by a
graphical method by analogy with the calculations of direct current circuits with nonlinear
elements. With the magnetic leakage ﬂuxes taken into account, such a problem can be
solved by the successive approximation method.
E6.4.8. Analysis of a Branched Homogeneous Magnetic Circuit with
Permanent Magnet
The analysis of such a circuit cam be reduced to determining the value of magnetic induction
in air gap ( Fig. E6.37), which depends on the shape of the magnetization curve B = f(HM)
and the relation between the air gap length la and the magnetic circuit ferromagnetic part
length lM, i.e., on the value N = la/lM, which is the demagnetization factor if the air gap
cross-section coincides with the ferromagnetic part cross-section.

Applying Amp`ere’s circuital law along the center magnetic line of a permanent magnet

where HM and Ha are the magnetic ﬁeld strengths in a ferromagnetic material and in the
air gap, respectively; and lM and δ are the respective lengths of the center magnetic line on
the same parts.
It follows from the above that

(E6.4.8.1)
where B is the value of the magnetic induction in the air gap and in the magnet body,
provided that the air gap cross-section is equal in area to magnet cross-section and there is
no magnetic leakage ﬂux.
Since the quantities HM and B are related to each other by the magnetization curve
B = f(HM) and Eq. (E6.4.8.1) of the straight line OM, it follows that the ordinate of
point A, which is the point of intersection of these lines, determines the value of the desired
magnetic induction B. To construct the straight line OM, it sufﬁces to connect the origin
with point M whose ordinate is BR, which is the residual magnetic induction, and whose
abscissa is HR.
The same calculations can be performed for a small length of the air gap. Otherwise,
the pattern of the magnetic ﬁeld distribution becomes more complicated, and it is necessary
to pass from analytical calculations to experimental studies.
E6.5. Single-Phase Harmonic Current Circuits
E6.5.1. Effective and Average Values of Sinusoidal Quantities
◮Effective values of sinusoidal quantities. The electromotive force e varying in time by
a sinusoidal law (see Fig. E6.38) can be obtained by rotating an open rectangular wire loop
in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld with constant angular velocity about an axis perpendicular
to the ﬁeld lines.
The equation of sinusoidal EMF has the form
e = Em sin(ωt),
where Em is its maximal value or the amplitude.
Under the action of a sinusoidal EMF, in an electric circuit, there arises a sinusoidal or
harmonic current whose instantaneous value is determined by the formula
i = Im sin(ωt + ψ).
The sinusoidal current is a special case of alternating current whose value and direction
vary periodically by the sinusoidal law.
The sinusoidal current has signiﬁcant advantages over the alternating current of any
other shape. The derivative and the integral of a sinusoidal function are again sinusoidal
functions. Therefore, in the process of transformation of electric energy transferred over a
distance, the shape of the curve of sinusoidal current remains the same. The power losses
in sinusoidal current circuits are minimal, and the theoretical analysis of sinusoidal current
electric circuits are simpler.
A sinusoid is characterized by the following three parameters:
1. The maximal value or amplitude Em.
2. The period T, which is the time of one full wave. The number of waves per second is
called the frequency. The frequency is the inverse of the period, it is denoted by letter f and
is measured in hertzs (Hz). Since the rotation of the wire loop by the angle 2π corresponds to

the time equal to one period T, it follows that the angular velocity or the angular frequency
is ω = 2πf. The angular frequency is measured in rad/s or s–1.
3. The phase, ωt + ψ, is the sine argument.
The phase characterizes the state of
oscillations at a given time moment t. The angle ψ is equal to the phase at the initial time
moment (t = 0) and hence is called the initial phase. The phase displacement between two
sinusoidal quantities with equal frequencies is the difference between their initial phases
(in other words, the phase shifting, phase shift, phase difference).
◮Average values of sinusoidal quantities. The average value of a sinusoidally varying
quantity is its value averaged over a half-period. For example, the average value of current
is determined as
〈I〉= 2
T
Z T/2
0
Im sin(ωt) dt = 2
π Tm ≈0.638 Im.
The notion of effective value of a sinusoidally varying quantity is used very widely.
Electric energy transformed into heat energy is proportional to the squared current (the
Joule(–Lenz) law). To evaluate the effects of alternating currents, EMF, and voltages, the
notion of the quadratic mean over a period, called the active or effective value, is introduced.
For example, the effective value of current is
I =

(E6.5.1.1)
As a rule, the electrical measuring instruments of direct estimation show the effective
values of the measured quantities.
The effective value of alternating current is numerically equal to the direct current for
which, in the time interval equal to one period, the same quantity of heat is released in the
resistance R as for the alternating current.
E6.5.2. Representation of Sinusoidal Quantities by Vectors on
Complex Plane
◮Sum of two sinusoidal quantities. The vector diagram. In alternating current circuits,
Kirchhoff’s laws hold for instantaneous values. Their direct application to sinusoidal current
circuits leads to addition and transformation of trigonometric functions, and it is convenient
to perform these operations by using complex numbers.
The instantaneous values of any sinusoidal quantities, for example, of the currents
i1 = Im1 sin(ωt + ψ1) and i2 = Im2 sin(ωt + ψ2), can be represented at each time instant t
by the projections of the amplitude vectors Im1 and Im2 onto the vertical axis as is shown

in Fig. E6.39. In this case, the vectors rotate in the plane with constant angular velocity ω
about the point 0 anticlockwise. It should be noted that the vectors Im1 and Im2 rotate
about the origin with the same angular velocity ω, and their mutual disposition remains
unchanged. Therefore, they are usually represented at time t = 0.
The sum of instantaneous values of two sinusoidal currents i1 and i2 of the same
frequency f can be determined as the projection of the amplitude vector Im equal to the
geometric sum of the summand vectorsIm1 andIm2 andis presentedin Fig. E6.40. Theentire
set of rotating vectors, constructed with preservation of the mutual orientation, is called the
vector diagram, permits ﬁnding the sum or difference of several harmonic quantities, and
reﬂects the processes in a sinusoidal current electric circuit.
◮Vector of current on complex plane. Complex effective value. A complex number
can be represented as a vector on plane with two mutually perpendicular reference axes
for quantities: the real axis (denoted by +1) and the imaginary axis (denoted by +j, where
j2 = –1). The length of a vector in a chosen scale characterizes the absolute value (or
modulus) of the complex number, and the angle of rotation of the vector about the real axis
is the argument of the complex number. The positive angle is counted counterclockwise,
the negative angle is counted clockwise.
Remark. In electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by the symbol j, which differs from its
common notation i in mathematics (see Chapter M9). This is due to the fact that the symbol i in electrical
engineering usually denotes the current.
A complex number can be written in algebraic, exponential, or trigonometric form. For
example, to the current im = Im sin(ωt + ψ) represented in Fig. E6.41 by a rotating vector
there corresponds the complex number
a + jb = Imej(ωt+ψ) = Im cos(ωt + ψ) + jIm sin(ωt + ψ),
written by using the Euler formula ejα = cos α + j sin α. The imaginary part b of this
complex number is equal to the current im.
The amplitude is determined by the formula Im =
√
a2 + b2, and the phase angle can be
found from the projections of the vector onto the axes:
sin(ωt + ψ) =
b
√
a2 + b2 ,
cos(ωt + ψ) =

a2 + b2 .

Example 1. Let us determine the resultant current i in Fig. E6.40. To this end, we represent each of the
given currents in terms of complex amplitudes
I1 = Im1ejψ1,
I2 = Im2ejψ2.
The geometric sum of vectors I1 and I2 gives the complex amplitude of the total current, I = Imejψ. The
amplitude of the current Im is determined by the length of the sum vector, and the initial phase ψ is determined
by the angle made by this vector with the axis +1.
This example can also be solved analytically by summing the corresponding complex numbers represented
in algebraic form:
I = I1 + I2 = a1 + jb1 + a2 + jb2 = (a1 + a2) + j(b1 + b2).
The amplitude and the phase angle are determined by the formulas
Im =
p
(a1 + a2)2 + (b1 + b2)2,
tan ψ = b1 + b2
a1 + a2 .
One can see that, in summation and subtraction of complex numbers, it is convenient to use their algebraic
representation, and in multiplication (division), it is more convenient to use the exponential representation.
In the analysis of electric circuits, it is often necessary to pass from the algebraic
representation of a complex number to the exponential representation or vice versa. In
addition to the complex amplitude, the complex effective value is also used, which is
introduced as follows:
I = Im

Comparing the expressions for the instantaneous values of voltage and current, one
can see that there is no phase shift between voltage and current (Fig. E6.42a), which is
determined by the angle equal to the difference of the voltage and current initial phases, i.e.,
ϕ = ψU – ψI = 0.
Thus, the current and the voltage have the same initial phase (coincide in phase).
◮Instantaneous and average value of power. Ohm’s law in complex form.
The
instantaneous value of the power of this circuit is equal to the product of instantaneous
values of its voltage and current:
p = ui = UmIm sin2(ωt + ψU) = UI[1 – cos(2ωt + 2ψU)],
where I = Im/

instantaneous power is measured by doubled angular frequency 2ω and is all the time
positive in the limits from zero to the amplitude value.

Thus, the average value of power in this circuit is determined by the product of the effective
values of voltage and current, is called the active power, and is measured in watts (W).

Figure E6.43. (a) A sinusoidal current circuit with inductance and (b) the vector diagram for such a circuit.
The EMF of self-induction induced in the inductor is calculated as
eL = –L di
dt = –ωLIm sin(ωt) = ELm sin(ωt).
Here ELm = –ωLIm is the amplitude.
According to Kirchhoff’s second law, we have
eL + u = 0,
which implies the instantaneous value of voltage applied to the inductor terminals
uL = –eL = ωLIm sin(ωt) = ULm sin(ωt).
The effective voltage U and effective current I are related according to Ohm’s law as
follows:
I = U
ωL = U
XL
,
where the quantity XL = ωL = 2πfL is called the inductive reactance. The inductive
reactance is directly proportional to the coil inductance and the frequency of the current
ﬂowing through it.
The angle of phase shift between voltage and current is determined by the difference of
their initial phases:
ϕ = ψU – ψI = 0 – (–π/2) = π/2.
It is clear that the inductor voltage phase vector is π/2 ahead of the current vector.
◮Instantaneous value of power. Ohm’s law for a circuit with inductance. The instan-
taneous power in a circuit with inductance can be found as follows:
pL = ui = – 1
2 UmIm sin(2ωt) = –UI sin(2ωt).
In the ﬁrst quarter of the period, where the current i and the voltage u are positive (of
the same sign), the power is also positive. The energy is transferred from source to circuit
and is consumed to create a magnetic ﬁeld. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter of the period, the
ﬁeld energy is maximal. In the second quarter of the period, the current i remains positive

but decreases, and the voltage u is negative; then the power pL is negative. The magnetic
ﬁeld energy is transferred back into the circuit. The average value of power in such a circuit
is zero:
PL = 1
T
Z T
0
pL dt = 0.
Thus, in a circuit with inductance, the permanent energy oscillation (exchange) between
the circuit and the magnetic ﬁeld occurs without the source energy consumption.
The amplitude power in an inductive circuit is determined by the formula
QL = UI = I2ωL = 2πfLI2,
is called the reactive inductive power, is determined by the product of the effective voltage
and effective current, and is measured in reactive volt-amperes (RVA).

The phase shift angle between voltage and current is determined by the difference of
their initial phases:
ϕ = ψU – ψI = 0 – π/2 = –π/2.
It is clear that the capacitor voltage phase vector is π/2 behind the current vector.

◮Instantaneous value of power. Ohm’s law for a circuit with capacitance.
The
instantaneous power in a circuit with capacitance:
pC = ui = UI sin(2ωt).
In the ﬁrst quarter of the period, where the voltage u and the current i have the same
sign, the capacitor consumes energy from the feeding source, which created the electric
ﬁeld of the capacitor. In the second quarter of the period, the current i is negative, and the
capacitor voltage u, still remaining positive, decreases from its maximum to zero, and the
energy stored in the electric ﬁeld is transferred back to the source, i.e., the instantaneous
power is negative. Then the processes repeat. Thus, the period-average in a sinusoidal
current circuit with capacitance is zero:
PC = 1

pC dt = 0.
The power amplitude in a capacitive circuit is determined by the product of the effective
voltage and effective current
QC = UI = U2ωC = 2πfCU2
and is called the reactive capacitive power; QC is measured in reactive volt-amperes (RVA).
Ohm’s law in complex form for a circuit with capacitance has the form:
UC = –jXCI.

the elements in an unbranched electric circuit do not affect one another, then the circuit can

In the analysis of such circuits, just as in the case of direct current circuits, it is necessary
to introduce arbitrary positive directions of voltages and currents.
The instantaneous values of voltages in unbranched circuits always satisfy Kirchhoff’s
second law equation:
u = uR + uC + uL.
Kirchhoff’s second law equation can be written in complex form:
U = UR + UC + UL.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The voltages on separate elements are calculated by the formulas
UR = RI,
UC = –jXCI,
UL = jXLI.
(E6.5.6.2)
Substituting expressions (E6.5.6.2) into (E6.5.6.1), we obtain the complex voltage at the
terminals of a sinusoidal current circuit:
U = RI – jXCI + jXLI.
This formula can be represented as
U = (R + jX)I,
where X = XL – XC is the reactance of the circuit (reactive resistance), which can be both
positive and negative.
The quantity Z = R + jX is called the circuit impedance (total complex resistance); it
can be represented in exponential form:
Z = zejϕ,
where z =
√
R2 + X2 is the modulus of the complex number Z and ϕ is the argument of the
complex number Z, which is equal to the phase shift angle in the circuit between voltage
and current (tan ϕ = X/R).
In Fig. E6.46, we present the vector diagrams of an unbranched sinusoidal current circuit,
which are constructed according to Kirchhoff’s second law equation, and in Fig. E6.46a,
we consider the case of reactance X > 0; i.e., the inductive load predominates in the circuit
and the current is by a positive angle ϕ behind the voltage; in Fig. E6.46b, we consider the
case of reactance X < 0; i.e., the capacitive load predominates in the circuit and the current
is by a negative angle ϕ ahead of the applied voltage.

◮Instantaneous value of power, active power, total power, and reactive power. As-
sume that the voltage initial phase ψU is zero and the instantaneous values of voltage and
current are respectively described by the formulas
u = Um sin(ωt),
i = Im sin(ωt – ϕ).
We obtain the following expression for the instantaneous value of power
p = iu = UmIm sin(ωt) sin(ωt – ϕ) = 1

S ,
where the quantity S = UI is called the total power; it is measured in volt-amperes (VA)
and is the power for given effective values of voltage and current, when the circuit power
factor is equal to one, cos ϕ = 1.
In the analysis of electric circuits, the notion of reactive power is also used:
Q = UI sin ϕ,
which can be both positive (for ϕ > 0) and negative (for ϕ < 0), and its absolute value is
determined by the formula
|Q| =

E6.5.7. Branched Electric Circuit
◮Complex values of currents. The circuit susceptance and the complex admittance.
In the case of parallel connection of elements with parameters L, C, R attached to a source
of sinusoidal voltage (Fig. E6.48), the following equation following from Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst
law holds:
I = IR + IC + IL;
i.e., the complex value of the current in the unbranched part of the circuit is equal to the
algebraic sum of complex values of currents in separate branches.
Since the current in the branch with active resistance R coincides in phase with the
applied voltage, the current in the branch with inductance L is π/2 behind the voltage, and
the current in the branch with capacitance C is π/2 ahead of the voltage, we obtain:
IR = U

E6.5.8. Topographic Diagram
In direct current circuits, one constructs graphs of distribution of the potential, which
graphically interprets Kirchhoff’s second law. In the case of a sinusoidal current circuit,
one constructs the topographic vector diagram, which is a set of points on the complex plane
representing the complex potentials of the electric network points of the same name with
respect to a single point whose potential is conditionally zero. Thus, the order of location

912

of the voltage drop vectors on the diagram strictly corresponds to the order of location of
elements in the network.

Figure E6.51. Unbranched electric circuit (a) and the topographic diagram (b).
The construction of a topographic diagram starts from calculating the current vector. It
is convenient to direct the current along the real axis ψi = 0. Then one arbitrarily chooses a
point whose potential is zero, for example, ϕa = 0. Thus, point a is at the origin.b
The directions of the voltage vectors on the topographic diagram are shown with arbi-
trarily chosen direction of the current vector I. The network is traced towards the positive
direction of the current I. As we pass to point b, the potential increases by the value of the
voltage drop on the resistor R1 and is equal to
ϕb = ϕa + R3I = Uba.
The vector of this voltage drop coincides in phase with the current vector I.
The potential of point c is equal to
ϕc = ϕb + (–jXC)I.
The voltage Ucb = (–jXC)I is by an angle π/2 behind the current. Similarly, the voltage
vectors are constructed for other parts of the circuit. The vector of resultant voltage lies
between points a and f.
From the topographic vector diagram, one can readily determine the vector of voltage
difference between two arbitrary points of the circuit. For example, to determine the vector
of voltage difference between points d and f of the network, it sufﬁces to draw the voltage
vector between these points, because
Ufd = ϕf – ϕd.
This corresponds to the well-known rule of vector subtraction.
E6.5.9. Resonance Phenomena
◮Preliminary remarks. The operation mode of an electric circuit containing induction
coils and capacitors in which the equivalent (input) reactance or the equivalent (input)
susceptance is zero is called the resonance operation mode.
This operation mode is
characterized by the relations
Xe = 0,
Be = 0.

The electric circuit in resonance behaves as the pure active resistance with respect to the
external circuit; i.e., the voltage and the current at the circuit input are in phase (coincide in
phase).
The following two types of resonance are distinguished: the voltage resonance and the
current resonance.
◮Voltage resonance. The resonance arising in a circuit (Fig. E6.52), where the real
induction coil and capacitor connected in series, is called the voltage resonance.

The voltage resonance can be obtained by changing either the frequency of the power
supply voltage or the value of the inductance or capacitance. The ﬁrst case is called a
frequency resonance, and the other two are called parametric resonances.
The inductive (or capacitive) susceptance at the instant of the frequency resonance is
called the characteristic impedance, is denoted by letter ρ, and is determined as

If the induction coil is assumed to be ideal (i.e., Ric = 0), then the coil and capacitor
voltages are equal to each other:
XicIr = XCIr,
Uic = UC.
The ideal voltage resonance is equivalent to the case of shorted input terminals of the
circuit (since Ir = U/Rr = U/0 = ∞).
The ratios of the induction coil (or capacitor) voltage to the input voltage in resonance
are called the circuit quality factor (Q factor):

The quality factor q shows to what extent the induction coil (or capacitor) voltage exceeds
the input voltage; it depends on the coil and capacitor parameters.
We write Kirchhoff’s second law for this circuit (Fig. E6.52) in complex form:
U = Uic + UC = URic + UXic + UC = RicI + jXicI – jXCI.
We construct the vector diagrams (Fig. E6.53) on the basis of Kirchhoff’s second law on
the complex plane in the three cases: (a) before resonance (Uic < UC), (b) at the resonance
instant (Uic ∼= UC), and (c) after resonance (Uic > UC).

As follows from the vector voltage diagram in the voltage resonance mode, the input
current vector Ir coincides in phase with the input voltage vector U; i.e., the phase difference
between these vectors is zero:
ϕe = ϕU – ϕI = 0.
Here ψU is the initial phase of the input voltage, and ψI is the initial phase of the input
current. In resonance, the equivalent reactive power of the entire circuit is zero:
Qe = Qic – QC = XicI2

The ideal current resonance is equivalent to the circuit break (open-circuit operation

I = Iic + IC = YicU + YCU = (Gic – jBic)U + jBCU

where IRic = GicU is the active component of the coil current and IXic = –jBicU is the

We write Kirchhoff’s ﬁrst law on the complex plane in three cases: (a) before resonance
(Iic > IC), (b) at the resonance instant (Iic ∼= IC), and (c) after resonance (Iic < IC); i.e.,
construct the vector diagrams of currents (Fig. E6.55).
As follows from the current diagram (Fig. E6.55), in the current resonance operation
mode, the vector of the input voltage coincides in phase with the vector of the input current;
i.e., there is no phase shift between these vectors
ϕe = ψU – ψI = 0.

The current resonance, incontrast tothe voltage resonance (which causes the overvoltage
in electrical devices) is safe for electrical plants and, in particular, can be used to compensate
for the reactive power in them. In current resonance, large currents arise in circuits only if
the circuit branches have large susceptance; i.e., the circuits contain large capacitor batteries
or powerful induction coil.
E6.5.10. Improvement of the Power Factor
The power factor (cos ϕ) is one of the fundamental energy characteristics of electrical
engineering devices.

918
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
An increase in cos ϕ decreases the losses in the electric energy transfer from source to
receivers and increases the efﬁciency factor of devices.
As is known, the power factor can be determined from the power triangle by the formula
cos ϕ = P
S =
P
p
P 2 + Q2 =
P
p
P 2 + (QL – QC)2 ,
where ϕ is the phase shift between the voltage U and current I vectors, S is the total power
of the circuit, P is the active power of the circuit, QL is the inductive power, QC is the
capacitive power, Q = QL – QC = UI sin ϕ = UIX is the reactive power of the circuit, and
IX = I sin ϕ is the reactive component of the actual current I (this current is called the
reactive current).
As follows from the last formula, to increase cos ϕ, it is necessary to decrease the
reactive power Q, but in alternating current motors (asynchronous motors), the torque is
obtained by using the stator and conductors rotating ﬁeld interaction with the rotor current.
Hence such machines need an alternating magnetizing reactive current IX (i.e., the reactive
power Q = UIX) to create the torque moment of the ﬁeld, and this worsens the power factor
cos ϕ in industrial plant devices. A low value of the power factor results in an incomplete
use of power in generators, power transmission lines, and transformers. They are uselessly
loaded by the reactive current IX. The reactive current IX increases the losses ∆Plin in
wires as the electric energy is transferred. These losses consist of the losses arising due to
the transfer of the active current IR and the useless losses due to the transfer of the reactive
current IX. The latter are caused by the energy transmission from magnetic ﬁelds of motors
to electrical stations and generators and by the reverse transmissions.
The use of the current resonance permits unloading the energy source and the transmit-
ting devices from these useless oscillations of electric energy and hence from the reactive
current IX by closing the electric energy oscillations in the resonance circuit formed by
capacitors of capacitance C and a induction coil of inductance L. Practically, this unloading
is realized by parallel connection of motors with parameters (Rp, Xp) equivalent to those
of a battery of capacitors of capacitance C (Fig. E6.56a).
To compensate for the phase shift completely, the reactive (capacitive) power QC of the
batteries must be equal to the reactive (inductive) power of motors QL = UIp sin ϕ.
In a majority of cases, the phase shift is compensated for incompletely, because the
presence of a small reactive current IX is of no importance for cos ϕ ≥0.95, because
I =
p
I2
R + I2
X, and the complete compensation requires additional installation of devices
with signiﬁcant conductance (additional batteries of capacitors), which is often economi-
cally unproﬁtable.
Usually, the value of cos ϕ that the electrical engineering device must have after com-
pensation is prescribed; if the initial value of the current receiver Ip and its cos ϕp are known
(as a rule, these values are given in the certiﬁcates of electrical engineering devices), then
the required value of the capacitance C of the battery of capacitors is determined as follows.
To decrease the phase shift ϕp to the value ϕ, it is necessary, as the vector diagram
shows (Fig. E6.56b), to decrease the resultant reactive current of the device by the quantity
IXp –IX; here IXp is the device reactive current before compensation, and IX is the reactive
current after compensation.
The active current IR is related to the reactive current IX simply as IX = IR tan ϕ;
moreover, the active current can be expressed in terms of the active power P and the
voltage U of the device (receiver) as
IR = P
U = UI cos ϕ
U
= I cos ϕ.

The active current does not vary in the course of compensation, IRp = IR = const. After
the required substitutions, one can express the desired difference of reactive currents as
follows:
IXp – IX = IR(tan ϕp – tan ϕ) = P
U (tan ϕp – tan ϕ).
The capacitive current IC, necessary to perform the compensation must be numerically
equal to this difference:
IC = IXp – IX = P
U (tan ϕp – tan ϕ).
(E6.5.10.1)
By Ohm’s law, the capacitive current is related to the capacitance as
IC = U
XC
=
U
1/ωC = ωCU.
(E6.5.10.2)
From (E6.5.10.1) and (E6.5.10.2) we obtain the capacitance necessary to perform the
compensation:
C =
P
ωU2 (tan ϕp – tan ϕ).
The improvement of the power factor (cos ϕ) by including capacitors (batteries of
capacitors) is called the artiﬁcial improvement of the power factor in contrast to the natural
improvement of the power factor, which is attained by complete use of the power of motors
and by installing motors that do not consume reactive current (synchronous motors).

and Criteria for Their Applicability
E7.1. Empirical, Engineering and Interpolation Formulas.
Least-Squares Method
E7.1.1. Empirical and Engineering Formulas
◮Preliminaries. Requirements to empirical formulas.
In science and engineering
applications, functional dependences are often studied experimentally. The measurement
results form a ﬁnite set of points, which is usually written as in the form of a table
x1
x2
x3
. . .
xn
y1
y2
y3
. . .
yn
(E7.1.1.1)
Here x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn are the values of the argument, and y1, y2, y3, . . . , yn are the
corresponding values of the function.
If the analytic dependence of y on x is unknown (or is known but very cumbersome),
then the following practically important problem arises: ﬁnd an empirical formula
y = f(x)
(E7.1.1.2)
such that for all xi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) the values provided by this formula only slightly differ
from the experimental data yi,
|yi – f(xi)| < ε
(i = 1, 2, . . . , n).
The empirical formula must satisfy the following two fundamental requirements:
(i) It must be sufﬁciently accurate.
(ii) It must be sufﬁciently simple. (Of two formulas with the same accuracy, the simpler
one is preferable.)
If there is no information about intermediate data, then it is usually assumed that the
empirical function is continuous, smooth, and monotone on any interval [xi, xi+1] (unless
yi = yi+1).
Remark. Any experimental data are approximate, because measurements always have certain errors.
Therefore, the accuracy of any empirical formula can never be better than that of the experimental data used to
construct it.
◮Choice of the form of an empirical formula. The general form of the desired functional
dependence (E7.1.1.2) is usually taken a priori from various considerations. At the initial
stage, the basic functional dependence must contain a set of free parameters (indeterminate
coefﬁcients) whose values are further determined from the condition that the empirical
921

EMPIRICAL AND ENGINEERING FORMULAS. CRITERIA FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY
formula is consistent with the experimental data. Linear, rational-fractional rational, power-
law, exponential, and (in the case of periodic processes) trigonometric functions are used
most frequently. In what follows, we consider the most widely used types of empirical
formulas in Sections E7.1.2 and E7.2.
In many cases, if the argument ranges in a bounded interval, one can use a polynomial
y =
m
X
i=0
aixi
to construct an empirical formula. The degree m of the polynomial and the indeterminate
coefﬁcients ai can be found from various considerations, which can take into account a
priori known boundary or initial conditions.
THEOREM (WEIERSTRASS). Let f(x) be a continuous function on a ﬁnite interval [a, b].
Then, for any ε > 0, there exists a polynomial P(x) such that the inequality |f(x)–P(x)| < ε
holds at every point of [a, b].
Assume that there is a class of qualitatively similar problems or phenomena that differ
from each other by geometric characteristics (for example, by the shape of the region under
study, the ﬂow structure, etc.) and by the numerical values of physical-chemical parameters.
If the dependence (E7.1.1.2) of the desired quantity y on the argument x is known for some
speciﬁc (for example, the simplest) problem (this dependence may be approximate and
may be obtained theoretically or experimentally), then the empirical formula describing a
similar quantity for another problem of the same class can be sought in the form
y = a1f(a2x + a3) + a4,
(E7.1.1.3)
where the numerical values of the parameters ai are determined, for example, by the least-
squares method (see Section E7.1.2). Formula (E7.1.1.3) is obtained from (E7.1.1.2) by
combining the translation and scaling operations in both variables x and y. In several cases,
it sufﬁces to use two-parameter dependences (E7.1.1.3) in which either a2 = 1 and a3 = 0
or a3 = a4 = 0.
Incertaincases, the form of theempirical formulacanbe chosenon the basis of additional
theoretical considerations concerning the character of the dependence under study. (Such
formulas are often said to be semiempirical.)
◮Engineering formulas. The notion of engineering formula is wider than that of em-
pirical formula. Engineering formulas are approximate formulas used in applications and
obtained by either theoretical (approximate, analytic, or numerical) or experimental meth-
ods. Various combinations of theoretical and experimental methods can be used as well.
Ideally, the engineering formula must be sufﬁciently accurate and sufﬁciently simple
and have a wide scope of applicability.
E7.1.2. Least-Squares Method
◮General case. The least-squares method allows approximately determining a function
presented in table form (E7.1.1.1) by measurement results.
Consider a functional dependence of the form
y = F(x, a1, a2, . . . , am),
(E7.1.2.1)
where a1, a2, . . . , am are the desired parameters.

E7.1. EMPIRICAL, ENGINEERING AND INTERPOLATION FORMULAS. LEAST-SQUARES METHOD

Let us write the sum
S =

2
(E7.1.2.2)
of squared deviations, where xi and yi are the experimental data presented in the table of
Eq. (E7.1.1.1).
The numerical values of the parameters ai are determined by minimizing the sum
(E7.1.2.2). Necessary conditions for the minimum of the expression (E7.1.2.2) lead to the
following system of m algebraic (or transcendental) equations for the parameters ai:
∂S
∂a1
= 0,
∂S
∂a2
= 0,
. . . ,
∂S
∂am
= 0.
(E7.1.2.3)
These equations may be nonlinear in general.
If system (E7.1.2.3) has a unique solution, then this is the desired solution. If there are
several solutions, then one should compare the corresponding values of the sum (E7.1.2.2)
and choose the parameter values that provide the minimum of S.
Example 1. For the desired empirical dependence we take the linear function
y = ax + b.
To calculate the indeterminate coefﬁcients a and b, one minimizes the sum
S =
n
X
i=1
(yi – axi – b)2.
By using the necessary conditions for the minimum of the function S = S(a, b) (i.e., by equating the partial
derivatives of S with respect to the parameters a and b with zero), we obtain the system of two linear equations

for a and b. Here the values x1, x2, . . . , xn and y1, y2, . . . , yn are assumed to be taken from table (E7.1.1.1).
Example 2. If for the desired dependence we take the quadratic function
y = ax2 + bx + c,
then we obtain the system of three linear equations

◮Special case (a generalization of Examples 1 and 2). System (E7.1.2.3) is simpliﬁed
dramatically if the empirical function (E7.1.2.1) is taken to be linear in the parameters ai,
y = ϕ0(x) + a1ϕ1(x) + · · · + amϕm(x).
(E7.1.2.4)

Then system (E7.1.2.3) is the linear algebraic system that can be written as
a1(ϕ1, ϕ1) + a2(ϕ1, ϕ2) + · · · + am(ϕ1, ϕm) = (ϕ1, Y ),

E7.1.3. Reﬁnement of Empirical Formulas
◮Statement of the problem. Assume that the empirical formula (E7.1.1.2) does not
agree well with the experimental data (E7.1.1.1). It is required to modify this formula so as
to satisfy the experimental data.
◮The simplest method for reﬁning empirical formulas. Here we describe the simplest
method for reﬁning an empirical formula if it the sum of squared deviations provided by
this formula is larger than desired.
Consider the auxiliary function
y = f(x) + a,
(E7.1.3.1)
where a is an unknown constant. We determine a from the condition that the sum
S =
n
X
i=1
[yi – f(xi) – a]2
(E7.1.3.2)
of squared deviations be minimal. A necessary condition for the minimum of the sum
(E7.1.3.2) can be found from the condition S′
a = 0 and gives
a = 1
n
n
X
i=1
εi,
εi = yi – f(xi),
(E7.1.3.3)
which ensures the minimum of the sum under study.
Here εi is the deviation of the
experimental data from the results provided by the empirical formula (E7.1.1.2) at the
point xi.
Thus, if a ≠0, then the addition of the constant a determined by formula (E7.1.3.3)
to the right-hand side of the empirical formula (E7.1.1.2) results in a reﬁnement of this
formula in the sense that the sum of squared deviations decreases. If a = 0 or a ≈0, then
this method does not give the desired effect. In this case, one can use the more general
method described below.
◮A more general method for reﬁning empirical formulas. Instead of (E7.1.3.1), we
take a more general auxiliary function
y = f(x) + aϕ(x),
(E7.1.3.4)
where ϕ(x) is a given function and a is an unknown constant.

Consider the sum
S =

(E7.1.3.5)
A necessary condition for the minimum of this function implies the equation

(E7.1.3.6)
Remark 1. Instead of formula (E7.1.3.4), one can reﬁne the empirical formula (E7.1.1.2) by using the
more complicated two-parameter dependence
y = f(x) + a1ϕ1(x) + a2ϕ2(x).
Remark 2. To reﬁne the empirical formula (E7.1.1.2), one can use the four-parameter dependence
(E7.1.1.3).
E7.1.4. Interpolation Formulas
◮Linear interpolation. Lagrange interpolation polynomial. Interpolation formulas
are formulas that give the exact values ym of a function on a given discrete set of values xm
the argument.
Linear interpolation formulas
y =
n
X
i=1
aiϕi(x),
(E7.1.4.1)
where ϕ1(x), . . . , ϕn(x) is a given system of functions, are used most frequently. The
coefﬁcients ai are determined from the condition that the function y coincides with the
given values ym at the respective points xm,
ym =
n
X
i=1

m = 1, 2, . . . , n.

(E7.1.4.2)
which is called the Lagrange interpolation polynomial. The (n – 1)st-order polynomial
(E7.1.4.2) exactly satisﬁed the data of table (E7.1.1.1).

926
EMPIRICAL AND ENGINEERING FORMULAS. CRITERIA FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY
Let a function f(x) have an nth-order derivative on a ﬁnite interval [a, b]. Then the
error in replacing f(x) with the Lagrange polynomial Ln–1(x) such that f(xm) = Ln–1(xm)
(m = 1, . . . , n) is estimated as
|f(x) – Ln–1(x)| ≤1

◮Two-point linear interpolation. In applications, the linear interpolation formula with
two points xk and xk+1 is used most frequently. This formula reads
y = yk+1 – yk
xk+1 – xk
(x – xk) + yk
(xk ≤x ≤xk+1)
(E7.1.4.3)
and corresponds to the case of n = 2 in formula (E7.1.4.2) with x1 and x2 redenoted by xk
and xk+1, respectively. Formula (E7.1.4.3) describes the straight line segment passing with
endpoints (xk, yk) and (xk+1, yk+1) on the (x, y)-plane.
Remark. The interpolation formulas (E7.1.4.2) with n > 2 are rather cumbersome and are not used
practically to construct empirical formulas on the basis of experimental data (because it does not make any
sense to take a function exactly coinciding with the measurement results, which always contain certain errors).
E7.2. Criteria for Applicability of Empirical Formulas
E7.2.1. Direct Method for Verifying Two-Parameter Formulas
◮Method of complete elimination of free parameters. For simplicity and clarity, we
illustrate the method of complete elimination of free parameters by an example of two-
parameter functions explicitly deﬁned as
y = F(x, a, b).
(E7.2.1.1)
It is required to examine whether formula (E7.2.1.1) can be used to approximate given
experimental data by an appropriate choice of the constants a and b.
By specifying the values of the function at three arbitrary (but distinct) points xi, xj,
and xk, we obtain the three relations
yi = F(xi, a, b),
yj = F(xj, a, b),
yk = F(xk, a, b).
(E7.2.1.2)
From now on, we use the short notation yi = y(xi), yj = y(xj), and yk = y(xk).
By
eliminating the free parameters a and b from (E7.2.1.2), we obtain the criterion relation. It
is convenient to write it out as
Θ = 1,
(E7.2.1.3)
where the left-hand side contains a function
Θ = Θ(xi, xj, xk, yi, yj, yk).
(E7.2.1.4)
It is necessary to satisfy relation (E7.2.1.3) for any values of i, j, k (1 ≤i < j < k ≤n,
where n is the total number of experimental points) for the dependence (E7.2.1.1) to hold.
For the applicability of formula (E7.2.1.1) as an empirical formula, it is necessary to satisfy
relation (E7.2.1.3) with prescribed accuracy.

E7.2. CRITERIA FOR APPLICABILITY OF EMPIRICAL FORMULAS
927
In practice, it is convenient to use the special case of formula (E7.2.1.4) with i = j – 1
and k = j+1. In this case, it is useful to represent the results of experimental data processing
obtained by calculating the function (E7.2.1.4) by points (xj, Θj) on the (x, Θ)-plane and
estimate their deviations from the straight line Θ = 1 (see the criterion (E7.2.1.3)), which is
parallel to the abscissa axis.
We use the above-described method in the case of two-parameter empirical dependences
of special form
y = af(x) + b,
(E7.2.1.5)
where f(x) is a given function and a and b are free parameters. We take three distinct points
xi, xj, and xk to which there correspond three values yi, yj, and yk of the desired quantity.
Under the assumption that the functional dependence (E7.2.1.5) takes place, we have
yi = af(xi) + b,
yj = af(xj) + b,
yk = af(xk) + b.
(E7.2.1.6)
By eliminating the parameters a and b from these relations, we obtain
yk – yi
yj – yi
= f(xk) – f(xi)
f(xj) – f(xi) .
(E7.2.1.7)
By introducing the new auxiliary variable
Θ = yk – yi
yj – yi
f(xj) – f(xi)
f(xk) – f(xi) ,
(E7.2.1.8)
we can verify the applicability of the two-parameter approximations of the form (E7.2.1.5),
because condition (E7.2.1.3) must be satisﬁed for them, which follows from relation
(E7.2.1.7).
Formula (E7.2.1.8) readily admits computer implementation, and by choosing the func-
tion f(x) in (E7.2.1.5) in various ways, one can compare the corresponding approximation
errors and then take the dependence with the least error.
Example 1. For the logarithmic dependence
y = a ln x + b ≡a ln(cx),
c = exp(b/a),
(E7.2.1.9)
formula (E7.2.1.8) becomes
Θ = yk – yi
yj – yi
ln xj – ln xi
ln xk – ln xi .
(E7.2.1.10)
For the applicability of two-parameter approximations of the form (E7.2.1.9), relation (E7.2.1.3) must be
satisﬁed under condition (E7.2.1.10).
Example 2. Consider the two-parameter power-law dependence
y = axm
(x ≥0, y ≥0).
(E7.2.1.11)
Taking the logarithms of both sides of this formula, we obtain a dependence of the form (E7.2.1.5) with
f(x) = ln x, b = ln a, and a = m and with y replaced by ln y on the left-hand side. By substituting f(x) = ln x
into (E7.2.1.8) and by replacing y by ln y, we obtain
Θ = ln yk – ln yi
ln yj – ln yi
ln xj – ln xi
ln xk – ln xi .

Formula (E7.2.1.12) permits verifying the applicability of power-law functions of the form (E7.2.1.11).

Remark 1. For a majority of two-parameter functions (E7.2.1.1), it is impossible to eliminate free param-
eters from relations (E7.2.1.2); i.e., it is impossible to obtain the criterion relation (E7.2.1.3) explicitly. This
fact does not permit using this method efﬁciently for more general multi-parameter dependences.
Remark 2. The direct method of elimination of free parameters can be used in the case of multi-parameter
dependences of the special form
y = h(x)F
 PN

PM

,
(E7.2.1.13)
where fi(x), gj(x), h(x), and F(z) are given functions and ai and bj are free parameters. To this end, we ﬁrst

where F –1 is the inverse function of F. Further, taking the required number of points xk (k =1, 2, . . . , N+M+1)
and the values yk corresponding to them, one can eliminate the parameters ai and bj from the resulting system
of linear algebraic equations.
◮Method of partial elimination of free parameters. We describe the method of partial
elimination of free parameters for two-parameter functions y = F(x, a, b). Prescribing the
values of the function at two arbitrary points, we obtain two relations, yi = F(xi, a, b) and

E7.2. CRITERIA FOR APPLICABILITY OF EMPIRICAL FORMULAS
929
yj = F(xj, a, b). By eliminating one of the parameters from them and then by solving
the obtained relation for the other parameter, we obtain a criterion relation of the form
ϕ(xi, xj, yi, yj) = a or ψ(xi, xj, yi, yj) = b.
Let us apply this method to the two-parameter family of functions (E7.2.1.5).
By
eliminating the parameter b from the ﬁrst two relations in (E7.2.1.6), we obtain the relation
yj – yi
f(xj) – f(xi) = a,
(E7.2.1.14)
which can also be used to verify the applicability of functions of the form (E7.2.1.5). If any
two points xi and xj and the values yi and yj corresponding to them are substituted into
the left-hand side of (E7.2.1.14), then one and the same constant a must be obtained. (If
Eq. (E7.2.1.14) is satisﬁed approximately with satisfactory accuracy, then the constant a can
readily be veriﬁed by the least-squares method.) Another criterion relation for the family
of functions (E7.2.1.6) can be derived in a similar way by eliminating the parameter a:
yif(xj) – yjf(xi)
f(xj) – f(xi)
= b.
(E7.2.1.15)
Inthe special caseof the logarithmic law (E7.2.1.9), the ﬁrst criterionrelation (E7.2.1.14)
acquires the form
yj – yi
ln xj – ln xi
= a,
(E7.2.1.16)
and the second criterion relation (E7.2.1.15) becomes
yi ln xj – yj ln xi
ln xj – ln xi
= b.
(E7.2.1.17)
Now we consider the two-parameter power-law dependence (E7.2.1.11).
We take
logarithms of both sides of this formula and then apply the resulting equation to two points
xi and xj. After the elimination of the parameter a, we obtain the ﬁrst criterion relation
ln yj – ln yi
ln xj – ln xi
= m.
(E7.2.1.18)
For the power-law dependence (E7.2.1.11), we can also obtain the second criterion relation
ln xi ln yj – ln xj ln yi
ln xi – ln xj
= ln a
(E7.2.1.19)
by eliminating the parameter m.
In Table E7.2, we present the direct criteria (necessary conditions) for the applicability
of two-parameter monotone dependences of the simplest form obtained by the method of
partial elimination of free parameters (usually, one sets j = i + 1).
The method of partial elimination of free parameters leads to simpler criteria than the
method of complete elimination of free parameters; in addition, it permits obtaining one of
the parameters readily (cf. Table E7.1 and Table E7.2).

◮Several generalizations. The method of partial elimination of free parameters can be
used in the case of multi-parameter dependences of special form (E7.2.1.13). For example,
for three-parameter dependence in the form of a quadratic polynomial
y = ax2 + bx + c,
we obtain the criterion
(xk – xi)(yj – yi) – (xj – xi)(yk – yi)
(xk – xi)(x2
j – x2

k – x2
i) = a.
For a more general three-parameter dependence
y = af(x) + bg(x) + ch(x),
where f(x), g(x), and h(x) are given functions, we have the criterion
(yjhi – yihj)(gkhi – gihk) – (ykhi – yihk)(gjhi – gihj)
(fjhi – fihj)(gkhi – gihk) – (fkhi – fihk)(gjhi – gihj) = a.

Here we use the shorthand notation fp = f(xp), gp = g(xp), and hp = h(xp), where p = i, j, k.
The other two criteria can be obtained by cyclic permutations of the constants a, b, and c
and the functions f, g, and h.
Remark. Instead of the explicit dependence (E7.2.1.1), one can consider a more general dependence
F(x, y, a, b) = 0 and, in particular, an implicit dependence of the special form
g(x, y) = af(x, y) + b,
which generalizes formula (E7.2.1.5). In this case, instead of (E7.2.1.14) we have the criterion
g(xj, yj) – g(xi, yi)
f(xj, yj) – f(xi, yi) = a.
E7.2.2. Three-Parameter Empirical Formulas
◮Three-parameter formula of power-law form. Consider the power-law dependence
y = axm + b
(E7.2.2.1)
containing three parameters a, b, and m. We compose the geometric mean for the two
extreme points: xgm = √x1xn. Let xk ≤xgm ≤xk+1. We use the linear interpolation
formula (E7.1.4.3) to obtain the approximate value ygm. Assuming that the points (x1, y1),
(xgm, ygm), (xn, yn) lie on the curve (E7.2.2.1), we obtain three equations
y1 = axm
1 + b,
ygm = axm
gm + b,
yn = axm
n + b.
By raising xgm = √x1xn to the power m and by multiplying by a, we obtain
axm
gm =
q
axm
1 axm
n
=⇒
ygm – b =
p
(y1 – b)(yn – b).
By squaring the last relation, we obtain the constant b,
b =
y1yn – y2
gm
y1 + yn – 2ygm
.
(E7.2.2.2)
Since the coefﬁcient b is now known, the change Y = y – b takes formula (E7.2.2.1) to
a formula of the form (E7.2.1.11) with two parameters. To verify its applicability, we can
use the criterion relation (E7.2.1.12) or (E7.2.1.18), where ys must be replaced by ys – b,
s = i, j, k.
◮Three-parameter formula of exponential form. Consider the exponential dependence
y = aeλx + b
(E7.2.2.3)
containing three parameters a, b, and λ. We compose the arithmetic mean for the two
extreme points, xam = 1
2 (x1 + xn). Let xk ≤xam ≤xk+1. We use the linear interpolation
formula (E7.1.4.3) to ﬁnd the approximate value yam.
Assuming that the three points
(x1, y1), (xam, yam), (xn, yn) lie on the curve (E7.2.2.3), we obtain
y1 = aeλx1 + b,
yam = ae
1
2 λ(x1+xn) + b,
yn = aeλxn + b.
This implies that y1 – b = aeλx1 and yn – b = aeλxn, and hence (y1 – b)(yn – b) = (yam – b)2.
Now we determine the constant b:
b =
y1yn – y2
am
y1 + yn – 2yam
.
(E7.2.2.4)
Since the coefﬁcient b is now known, the change Y = y – b takes formula (E7.2.2.3)
to the formula Y = aeλx with two parameters. To verify its applicability, we can use the
criterion dependence given in Tables E7.1 and E7.2 (the 6th row in both cases), where ys
must be replaced by ys – b, s = i, j, k.

Remark 2. In Subsection E7.2.1, we presented criteria for verifying the applicability of a quadratic

three-parameter formulas.
E7.2.3. Combined Method for Verifying Empirical Formulas
◮Description of the method.
Three-parameter dependences of power-law form.
In the cases where there are sufﬁciently many experimental points, empirical formulas
can be veriﬁed by a combined method. This method is based on the differentiation of
the dependence under study, after which, using the original dependence and its derivative
calculated at several points, the required number of free parameters is eliminated.
We illustrate the above by an example of the three-parameter power-law dependence
y = a(x + b)m.
(E7.2.3.1)
By successively setting x = xi, x = xj, x = xk in (E7.2.3.1), we cannot eliminate the free
parameters from the obtained relations; i.e., the direct method cannot be used.
Therefore, we proceed as follows. First, we differentiate (E7.2.3.1) with respect to x,
y′ = am(x + b)m–1,
(E7.2.3.2)
and then eliminate the parameter a from (E7.2.3.1) and (E7.2.3.2). We have
y
y′ = x + b
m .
(E7.2.3.3)
Relation (E7.2.3.3) contains two parameters m and b and already admits the application of
the direct method. By setting x = xi and x = xj in (E7.2.3.3) and then by eliminating one
of the free parameters, we obtain two criterion relations containing the ﬁrst derivatives:
(xi – xj)y′
iy′
j
yiy′
j – yjy′
i
= m,
(E7.2.3.4)
xiyjy′
i – xjyiy′

(E7.2.3.5)
In a similar way, consider the three-parameter dependence
y = axm + b,
(E7.2.3.6)
for which it is also impossible to derive criterion relations by the direct method.
By
differentiating (E7.2.3.6), we obtain
y′ = amxm–1.
(E7.2.3.7)
By eliminating the parameter a from (E7.2.3.6) and (E7.2.3.7), we obtain
y – b
y′
= x
m .
(E7.2.3.8)
By setting x = xi and x = xj in (E7.2.3.8) and then by eliminating the parameter b, we
obtain the criterion relation

yi – yj

(E7.2.3.9)
containing the ﬁrst derivatives.

◮Dependences of exponential and logarithmic type. We present several other simple
useful criteria for widely used three-parameter functions.
For the exponential dependence
y = aeλx + b,
we have the criterion
y′
i – y′
j
yi – yj
= λ.
(E7.2.3.10)
For the logarithmic dependence
y = a ln(bx + c) ≡a ln(x + D) + E
(D = c/b, E = a ln b),
we have the criterion
yj – yi
ln(y′
i/y′
j) = a.
(E7.2.3.11)
◮Formula for calculation of the derivatives. Criteria (E7.2.3.4), (E7.2.3.5), (E7.2.3.9),
(E7.2.3.10), and (E7.2.3.11) contain derivatives, which can be calculated approximately by
using appropriate approximation formulas.
In what follows, we present three difference schemes most widely used in numerical
mathematics to calculate the derivatives at the point xk:
y′
k = yk+1 – yk–1
xk+1 – xk–1
(central difference),
y′
k = yk+1 – yk
xk+1 – xk
(right difference),
y′
k = yk – yk–1
xk – xk–1
(left difference).
Numerical experiments show that the ﬁrst scheme based on the central difference pro-
vides the most accurate results. It is expedient to use just this scheme for computations.
E7.3. Construction of Engineering Formulas by the
Method of Asymptotic Analogies
E7.3.1. Description of the Method of Asymptotic Analogies
◮Preliminary remarks. The most important stage in the study of speciﬁc physical and
engineering problems is to ﬁnd general quantitative laws valid for a class of qualitatively
similar problems. In many cases, general results of this type can be obtained by the method
of asymptotic analogies. The method is based on the passage from the usual dimensionless
variables to special asymptotic coordinates and can be used for constructing wide-scope
approximate formulas. (For example, in problems of mass and heat transfer one and the
same formula can be used for describing a variety of qualitatively similar problems that
differ in surface shape and ﬂow structure.)
Suppose that there is a class of problems that differ in geometric characteristics and
depend on a dimensionless parameter x (0 ≤x < ∞). We assume that the dependence of the
basic desired variable w on the parameter x is known for some speciﬁc (say, the simplest)
geometry:
y = f(x),
(E7.3.1.1)
where f(x) is a monotone function.
In problems of mass and heat transfer, y is usually the Sherwood (Nusselt) number or the
volume-average concentration; the parameter x is dimensionless time, the Peclet number,
or the dimensionless rate constant of a chemical reaction.

934
EMPIRICAL AND ENGINEERING FORMULAS. CRITERIA FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY
◮Transition to asymptotic coordinates. Let us transform (E7.3.1.1) as follows. Let the
leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of y for small and large x have the form
y →y0
(as x →0),
y →y∞
(as x →∞),
(E7.3.1.2)
where y0 and y∞depend in certain way on x,
y0 = ϕ(x),
y∞= ψ(x),
(E7.3.1.3)
and are determined from the analysis of formula (E7.3.1.1).
We also assume that the
condition ϕ/ψ ≠const is satisﬁed.
Note that the original dependence (E7.3.1.1), as well as the asymptotics (E7.3.1.2) and
(E7.3.1.3), can be determined either theoretically or experimentally.
Using (E7.3.1.1)–(E7.3.1.3), we write the following two relations:
y
y0
= f(x)
ϕ(x) ,
y∞
y0
= ψ(x)
ϕ(x) .
(E7.3.1.4)
By expressing x from second relation and by substituting it in the ﬁrst equation (E7.3.1.4),
we ﬁnd the explicit form of y in terms of the asymptotics y0 and y∞. As follows from
(E7.3.1.4), the structure of this relation is generally written as
y
y0
= F
 y∞
y0

.
(E7.3.1.5)
The function f contained in the original formula (E7.3.1.4) and the function F contained
in formula (E7.3.1.5) are related as
f(x) ≡ϕ(x)F
 ψ(x)
ϕ(x)

.
It is seen that, in contrast to formula (E7.3.1.1), formula (E7.3.1.5) remains invariant
with respect to the choice of the method for determining the dimensionless value y. We
suggest that the range of each of the ratios y/y0 and y∞/y0 be identical for all problems
of the class under consideration.
The variables y/y0 and y∞/y0 are called asymptotic
coordinates.
Example. In applications, one usually encounters power-law asymptotics,
y0 = Axk

(E7.3.1.6)
where A, B, k, and m are some constants and k ≠m (for the entire class of considered problems, we assume
that the constants k and m remain the same but the parameters A and B can vary).
In the case of power-law asymptotics (E7.3.1.6), formula (E7.3.1.5) can be expressed explicitly via the
function f:

problems.
characteristics for a wider class of problems describing qualitatively similar phenomena or
processes. Speciﬁcally, after the relation (E7.3.1.5) has been constructed with the help of
(E7.3.1.1) for some speciﬁc (say, the simplest) case, we can evaluate y for other problems
of this class by ﬁnding the asymptotics y0 (as x →0) and y∞(as x →∞) and then by
substituting these asymptotics into (E7.3.1.5). The approximate formulas thus obtained are
asymptotically sharp in both limit cases x →0 and x →∞.
Figure E7.1 presents a principle scheme of applying the method of asymptotic analogies.
In the books by Polyanin and Dilman (1994) and Polyanin et al. (2002), the formulas
obtained by the method of asymptotic analogies were compared with the already known
formulas obtained by exact, numerical, and approximate methods for a large number of
speciﬁc cases. These investigations conﬁrmed the high accuracy and wide capabilities of
the method of asymptotic analogies. In other words, the ﬁnal functional relation (E7.3.1.5)
between y and its asymptotics remains the same (or varies slightly) in a wide class of
problems of the same type, and the speciﬁc features of geometric distinctions between these

936
EMPIRICAL AND ENGINEERING FORMULAS. CRITERIA FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY
problems (like the surface shape and the ﬂow structure) are sufﬁciently well taken into
account by the corresponding asymptotic parameters y0 and y∞.
As a result, the scope of the ﬁnal formula (E7.3.1.5) (or formulas (E7.3.1.7) and
(E7.3.1.8)) is substantially wider than that of the original formula (E7.3.1.1).
In this
sense, one can say that formulas of the type of (E7.3.1.6) are more informative than the
original formula (E7.3.1.1).
Remark. The original dependence (E7.3.1.1), as well as the asymptotics (E7.3.1.3) can be determined
either theoretically or experimentally.
E7.3.2. Illustrating Examples: Interior Heat Exchange Problems for
Bodies of Various Shape
◮Statement of the problem. Consider a class of problems concerning transient heat
exchange between convex bodies of various shape and the ambient medium. At the initial
time t = 0, the temperature is the same throughout the body and is equal to Ti, and for t > 0,
the temperature on the surface Γ of the body is maintained constant and is equal to Ts. The
general mathematical statement of the problem about the temperature distribution inside
the body is given in Section E5.5.1 (see formulas (E5.5.1.1)–(E5.5.1.3)).
In this section, attention is paid to the study of the bulk body temperature
〈T〉= 1
V
Z
v
T dv,
(E7.3.2.1)
where T is the dimensionless temperature and V =
R
v dv is the dimensionless volume of
the body.
◮General formulas for the bulk temperature of the body. To approximate the de-
pendence of the bulk temperature on time, we use the method of asymptotic analogies.
The simplest original problem is taken to be the one-dimensional (with respect to spatial
coordinates) heat exchange problem for a sphere of radius a. The exact solution of this
problem is well known and results in the following expression for the bulk temperature:
〈T〉= 1 – 6

(E7.3.2.2)
where χ is the thermal diffusivity.
The asymptotic expressions (for small and large ¯τ) of (E7.3.2.2) have the form
〈T〉0 = 6π–1/2√
¯τ
(¯τ →0);
〈T〉∞= 1
(¯τ →∞)
(E7.3.2.3)
and are a special case of (E7.3.1.6) for y0 = 〈T〉0 and y∞= 〈T〉∞, where A = 6π–1/2, B = 1,
k = 1
2 , and m = 0. By substituting these values into (E7.3.1.7) with f = 〈T〉, we can rewrite
(E7.3.2.2) as follows:

(E7.3.2.4)
Following the method of asymptotic analogies, we shall use formula (E7.3.2.4) for the
calculation of bulk temperature for nonspherical bodies. To this end, for a body of a given

E7.3. CONSTRUCTION OF ENGINEERING FORMULAS BY THE METHOD OF ASYMPTOTIC ANALOGIES
937
shape, we must ﬁrst calculate the asymptotics of bulk temperature for small and large ¯τ and
then substitute these asymptotics into (E7.3.2.4).
For a bounded body of arbitrary shape, the solution of problem (E5.5.1.1)–(E5.5.1.3)
tends as ¯τ →∞to the limit value (equal to 1) determined by the boundary condition on
the surface of the body. By setting T = 1 in (E7.3.2.1), we ﬁnd the asymptotics of the bulk
temperature for large ¯τ:
〈T〉∞= 1.
(E7.3.2.5)
Now let us consider the initial stage of the process, corresponding to small values
of dimensionless time. Let us integrate Eq. (E5.5.1.1) over the volume v occupied by the
body. Taking into account the identity ∆T = div (grad T) and applying the Gauss divergence
theorem, we replace the volume integral on the right-hand side by a surface integral. As a
result, we obtain

(E7.3.2.6)
where ξ is the coordinate along the inward normal on Γ.
For small ¯τ, the temperature mainly varies in a thin region adjacent to the surface. In
this region, the derivatives along the surface can be neglected compared with the normal
derivatives. Therefore, the temperature distribution as ¯τ →0 is described by the equation
∂T
∂¯τ = ∂2T

(E7.3.2.7)
with the initial and boundary conditions,
¯τ = 0, T = 0;
ξ = 0, T = 1,
where the value ξ = 0 corresponds to the surface of the body.

◮Bulk temperature for bodies of various shape. Let us compare the approximate de-
pendence (E7.3.2.12) with some well-known exact results on heat exchange for nonspherical
bodies.
First, consider a parallelepiped with sides L1, L2, and L3. The solution of the corre-
sponding three-dimensional problem (E5.5.1.1)–(E5.5.1.3) can be constructed by separation
of variables and results in the following formula for bulk temperature:

Now consider heat exchange for a cylinder of ﬁnite length. Let a be the radius and L the

(The ﬁrst sixty roots ϑk are tabulated in the book by Janke et al. (1960).)

In Table E7.3, the exact value of the bulk temperature given by (E7.3.2.17) is compared
with the approximation (E7.3.2.12) for various ratios of the cylinder dimensions.
The
maximum error in formula (E7.3.2.12) is about 3.5% for 0.25 ≤2a/L ≤4.0.
E7.3.3. Illustrating Examples: Mass Exchange Between
Bubbles/Particles and Flow
◮Mass transfer to a spherical bubble at low Reynolds numbers. The problem of mass
transfer to a spherical bubble in a translational ﬂow as Re →0 was studied in the entire
range of Peclet numbers by ﬁnite-difference methods. The results for the mean Sherwood
number are well approximated by the expression (E5.8.2.6)
Sh = 0.6 + (0.16 + 0.213 Pe)1/2,
(E7.3.3.1)
where the bubble radius is taken as the characteristic scale.
The maximum deviation of (E7.3.3.1) in the entire range of Peclet numbers is about 3%.
We use formula (E7.3.3.1) as a basis for obtaining a more general dependence, which
can be used for nonspherical bubbles and more complicated ﬂows. To this end, we use the
method of asymptotic analogies, by setting x = Pe and y = Sh.

EMPIRICAL AND ENGINEERING FORMULAS. CRITERIA FOR THEIR APPLICABILITY
From formula (E7.3.3.1) we ﬁnd its asymptotics:
Sh0 = 1
(Pe →0),
Sh∞= (0.213 Pe)1/2
(Pe →∞),
(E7.3.3.2)
which corresponds to the values of the exponents k = 0 and m = 1/2 in formulas (E7.3.1.6)–
(E7.3.1.8).
Passing from the original variables Pe and Sh to the asymptotic coordinates Sh/Sh0
and Sh/Sh∞in (E7.3.3.1), we obtain the dependence

,
(E7.3.3.3)
where Sh∞is the asymptotic value of the mean Sherwood number as Pe →∞, which
can be calculated by solving the diffusion boundary layer equation in a given ﬂow ﬁeld or
determined experimentally.
Now we consider an axisymmetric shear ﬂow, where the dimensional ﬂuid velocity
components remote from the bubble have the following form in the Cartesian coordinates
X1, X2, X3:
V = (V1, V2, V3) = (–GX1, –GX2, 2GX3) ,
(E7.3.3.4)
where G is the shear coefﬁcient.
For a spherical bubble in a shear Stokes ﬂow (E7.3.3.4), the asymptotics of the mean
Sherwood number has the form (Polyanin et al., 2002)
Sh0 = 1
(Pe →0),
Sh∞=

(Pe →∞),
(E7.3.3.5)
where Pe = a2|G|/D. By substituting the asymptotics (E7.3.3.5) into formula (E7.3.3.3),
we obtain the formula
Sh = 0.6 + (0.16 + 0.955 Pe)1/2,
whose error in the entire range of the Peclet numbers does not exceed 3%.
◮Mass transfer to a solid particle at low Reynolds numbers. The problem of mass
transfer to a solid spherical particle in a translational Stokes ﬂow (Re →0) was studied in
the entire range of Peclet numbers by ﬁnite-difference methods. To ﬁnd the mean Sherwood
number for a spherical particle, it is convenient to use the following approximate formula
(E5.7.2.8):
Sh = 0.5 + (0.125 + 0.243 Pe)1/3,
(E7.3.3.6)
where the particle radius is taken as the characteristic scale.
The maximum deviation of (E7.3.3.6) in the entire range of Peclet numbers is about 2%.
From formula (E7.3.3.6), we ﬁnd its asymptotics:

which is equivalent to formula (E5.9.3.2). The approximate formula (E7.3.3.8) can be
used to calculate the mean Sherwood number for a steady-state viscous ﬂow (without
closed streamlines) past smooth particles of nonspherical shape (for example, ellipsoidal
particles).
The auxiliary value Sh∞must be chosen equal to the leading term of the
asymptotic expansion of the Sherwood number as Pe →∞.
For a particle of a given shape, the auxiliary quantities Sh0 and Sh∞occurring in
(E7.3.3.8) can be determined either theoretically or experimentally (see Section E5.9.3).
Remark. For a solid spherical particle in an axisymmetric shear ﬂow (E7.3.3.4), the maximum error of
formula (E7.3.3.8) in the entire region of Peclet numbers is about 3%.
◮Transient mass transfer in steady-state ﬂows. We consider a laminar steady-state
ﬂow past a solid spherical particle (drop or bubble) of radius a and study transient mass
transfer to the particle surface. At the initial time t = 0, the concentration in the contin-
uous phase is constant and equal to Ci, whereas for t > 0 a constant concentration Cs is
maintained on the particle surface. The mathematical statement of the problem about the
concentration distribution in the ﬂow is given in Section E5.10.1 (see formulas (E5.10.1.1)
and (E5.10.1.2)).
In what follows, we restrict ourselves to the case of high Peclet numbers, in which there
are no closed streamlines in the ﬂow.
For an axisymmetric shear ﬂow past a bubble (the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld far from the bubble
is determined by formula (E7.3.3.4)), the mean Sherwood number can be calculated by the
formula
Sh =
r
3 Pe
π
coth (3 Pe τ),
(E7.3.3.9)
which was obtained in the diffusion boundary layer approximation. In formula (E7.3.3.9),
we use the notation τ = Dt/a2 and Pe = a2G/D.
From formula (E7.3.3.9), we can ﬁnd the asymptotics
Sh0 = (πτ)–1/2
(τ →0),
Sh∞= (3 Pe/π)1/2
(τ →∞).
(E7.3.3.10)
By passing to asymptotic coordinates in (E7.3.3.9) with the use of (E7.3.3.10), we obtain
Sh
Sh∞
=

.
(E7.3.3.11)
For an arbitrary steady-state ﬂow past spherical particles, drops, and bubbles, we have
Sh0 = (πτ)–1/2, and formula (E7.3.3.11) becomes
Sh
Sh∞
=
q
coth(πSh2
∞τ),
(E7.3.3.12)
where Sh∞= lim
τ→∞Sh is the Sherwood number for the steady-state diffusion mode and
τ = Dt/a2.
Equation (E7.3.3.12) gives a valid asymptotic result for any steady-state ﬂow ﬁeld in
both limit cases τ →0 and τ →∞.
Table E7.4 presents a comparison of the mean Sherwood numbers calculated according
to Eq. (E7.3.3.12) with available data for various ﬂows past spherical drops, bubbles, and
solid particles at high Peclet numbers (in this table, we use the abbreviation DBLA for
“diffusion boundary layer approximation”). The parameter β is the ratio of the dynamic
viscosity of the drop to that of the ambient ﬂuid and varies in the range 0 ≤β ≤2. (The
value β = 0 corresponds to a gas bubble.)
Remark. One can ﬁnd other examples of using the method of asymptotic analogies in the books by
Polyanin and Dilman (1994) and Polyanin et al. (2002).

Orthogonal Curvilinear
Systems of Coordinates
S3.1. Arbitrary Curvilinear Coordinate Systems
S3.1.1. General Nonorthogonal Curvilinear Coordinates
◮Metric tensor. Arc length and volume elements in curvilinear coordinates. The
curvilinear coordinates x1, x2, x3 are deﬁned as functions of the rectangular Cartesian
coordinates x, y, z:
x1 = x1(x, y, z),
x2 = x2(x, y, z),
x3 = x3(x, y, z).
Using these formulas, one can express x, y, z in terms of the curvilinear coordinates
x1, x2, x3 as follows:
x = x(x1, x2, x3),
y = y(x1, x2, x3),
z = z(x1, x2, x3).
The metric tensor components gij are determined by the formulas
gij(x1, x2, x3) = ∂x
∂xi

gij(x1, x2, x3) = gji(x1, x2, x3);
i, j = 1, 2, 3.
The arc length dl between close points (x, y, z) ≡(x1, x2, x3) and (x + dx, y + dy, z + dz) ≡
(x1 + dx1, x2 + dx2, x3 + dx3) is expressed as

The volume of the elementary parallelepiped with vertices at the eight points (x1, x2, x3),
(x1 +dx1, x2, x3), (x1, x2 +dx2, x3), (x1, x2, x3+dx3), (x1 +dx1, x2 +dx2, x3), (x1 +dx1,
x2, x3 + dx3), (x1, x2 + dx2, x3 + dx3), (x1 + dx1, x2 + dx2, x3 + dx3) is given by
dV =
∂(x, y, z)
∂(x1, x2, x3) dx1 dx2 dx3 = ±
p
det |gij| dx1 dx2 dx3.
Here the plus sign corresponds to the standard situation where the tangent vectors to the
coordinate lines x1, x2, x3, pointing in the direction of growth of the respective coordinate,
form a right-handed triple, just as unit vectors i, j, k of a right-handed rectangular Cartesian
coordinate system.

In this case the third invariant of the metric tensor is given by

(α)k = α(α + 1) . . . (α + k – 1),
which, a fortiori, is convergent for |x| < 1.
For γ > β > 0, this solution can be expressed in terms of a deﬁnite integral:
F(α, β, γ; x) =

0 tβ–1(1 – t)γ–β–1(1 – tx)–α dt,
where Γ(β) is the gamma function.
If γ is not an integer, the general solution of the hypergeometric equation has the form:
y = C1F(α, β, γ; x) + C2x1–γF(α – γ + 1, β – γ + 1, 2 – γ; x).
In the degenerate cases γ =0, –1, –2, –3, . . . , a particular solution of the hypergeometric
equation corresponds to C1 = 0 and C2 = 1. If γ is a positive integer, another particular
solution corresponds to C1 = 1 and C2 = 0. In both these cases, the general solution can be
constructed by means of the last formula given in the preliminary remarks at the beginning
of Section S4.2.
Table S4.2 gives the general solutions of the hypergeometric equation for some values
of the determining parameters.

If y1(x) is the solution of the Mathieu equation satisfying the initial conditions y1(0) = 1
and y′
1(0) = 0, the characteristic index can be determined from the relation
cosh(2πµ) = y1(π).
The solution y1(x), and hence µ, can be determined with any degree of accuracy by means
of numerical or approximate methods.
The general solution differs depending on the value of y1(π) and can be expressed in
terms of two auxiliary periodical functions ϕ1(x) and ϕ2(x) (see Table S4.3).

exist for certain values of the parameters a and q (those values of a are referred to as

Selecting a sufﬁciently large m and omitting the term with the maximum number in the
recurrence relations (indicated in Table S4.4), we can obtain approximate relations for the
eigenvalues an (or bn) with respect to parameter q. Then, equating the determinant of
the corresponding homogeneous linear system of equations for coefﬁcients An
m (or Bn
m) to
zero, we obtain an algebraic equation for ﬁnding an(q) (or bn(q)).

S6.3.2. Leptons
Leptons are fermions, i.e., spin-1/2 elementary particles. They all have baryon number 0
and form three generations: electronic, comprising electrons (e–) and electron neutri-
nos (νe), muonic, comprising muons (µ–) and muon neutrinos (νµ), and tauonic, comprising
tauons (τ –) and tauon neutrinos (ντ). Every lepton has a corresponding antilepton. The
main properties of leptons are listed below.

S6.3.3. Quarks
Quarks combine to form composite particles—hadrons (baryons and mesons). All quarks
are fermions and have spin 1/2 and baryon number 1/3; they have six ﬂavors and form three
generations: up and down (ﬁrst), charm and strange (second), and top and bottom (third).
Every quark ﬂavor has a corresponding antiquark.

S6.3.4. Elementary Bosons
Elementary bosons are bosonic (integer-spin) elementary particles that act as carriers of the
fundamental forces: electromagnetic (photons), weak (Z and W bosons), strong (gluons),
and gravitational (gravitons, currently hypothetical). Also the existence of the Higgs boson
is theoretically predicted, which is thought to be the mediator of mass.

S6.3.5. Some Baryons
Baryons are the family of composite particles made of three quarks. Baryons have half-
integer spins and, hence, are fermions. They have lepton number 0 and baryon number 1.
Each baryon has a corresponding antibaryon, where each quark is replaced by the corre-
sponding antiquark.

Periodic Table
The periodic table of the chemical elements (also known as Mendeleev’s table) illustrates
recurring (“periodic”) trends in the properties of the elements. Currently (as of May 2010),
the standard table contains 118 elements; see next page.
The elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons in
the atomic nucleus). Each element has a name and a symbol and is listed together with its
standard atomic weight—the relative atomic mass, or the ratio of the average mass per atom
of the element to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of 12C, calculated for all naturally occurring
isotopes of the element. If an element has no stable isotopes, its standard atomic weight is
taken to be the atomic mass number (the total number of protons and neutrons in the atomic
nucleus) of the longest-lived isotope.
The elements are arranged in 18 groups (vertical columns) and 7 periods (horizontal
rows). In most groups, the elements have very similar properties that exhibit a clear trend.
Many groups are given unsystematic names such as the alkali metals (group 1, except
hydrogen), alkaline earth metals (group 2), transition metals (groups 3–11), pnictogens
(group 15), chalcogens (group 16), halogens (group 17), and noble gases (group 18).
Some regions of the periodic table show horizontal trends in properties, which is true for
the transition metals and especially for the lanthanides (group 3, period 6) and actinides
(group 3, period 7).
The chemical properties of an element are primarily determined by its electron conﬁg-
uration—the distribution of electrons in atomic orbitals (allowed quantum states). The set
of orbitals corresponding to the same principal quantum number, n, is called an electron
shell. The shells corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, . . . are denoted by K, L, M, . . . (K is
the innermost shell). Each shell is divided into subshells corresponding to the azimuthal
quantum number, l (l = 0, . . . , n – 1), and the subshells are labeled s, p, d, f, g, h, etc.
Each subshell can accommodate up to a maximum of 2(2l + 1) electrons and the maximum
number of electrons in the nth shell is 2n2. The electrons in an atom occupy orbitals starting
from the lowest-energy orbital.
The number of electrons in an atom determines its electron conﬁguration. For example,
sodium Na has 11 electrons and its electron conﬁguration is written as 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s,
which means that there are 2 electrons in the K-shell, 8 electrons in the L-shell with 2 in
the s-subshell and 6 in the p-subshell, and 1 electron in the s-subshell of the M-shell. The
electron conﬁguration of Na can be written as [Ne] 3s for short, where [Ne] stands for that
of Ne (1s2 2s2 2p6).
The order in which orbitals are ﬁlled by the electrons is given by Madelung’s rule (also
known as the n + l rule): (i) orbitals are ﬁlled in order of increasing n + l, (ii) if two
orbitals have the same value of n + l, they are ﬁlled in order of increasing n. This rule is
graphically illustrated in Fig. S7.1. According to the rule, the orbitals are ﬁlled in the order
1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s 4d 5p 6s 4f 5d 6p 7s 5f 6d 7p for the 118 elements of the periodic
table. Madelung’s rule was established experimentally, it applies only to neutral atoms in
their ground state, and it works very well for most of the elements. However, there are a
few exceptions; for example, Cr should have four electrons in the 3d orbital but has ﬁve,

Figure S7.1. Approximate order in which atomic orbitals are ﬁlled by electrons (Madelung’s rule).
with the electronic conﬁguration [Ar] 3d54s1 rather than [Ar] 3d44s2 (the former turns out
to have a lower energy than the latter). Similarly, Cu takes the conﬁguration [Ar] 3d104s1
instead of [Ar] 3d94s2. There are 18 more known exceptions in periods 5, 6, and 7.
The chemical properties of an element are chieﬂy determined by the outmost (valence)
electrons in the electronic conﬁguration. These electrons have the highest energies and
travel farthest from the nucleus and usually belong to the outmost (valence) shell, which is
especially true for light atoms. Atoms with complete valence shells (all noble gases) are
the most chemically inert, while those with only one electron in their valence shells (alkali
metals) or just missing one electron from having a complete shell (halogens) are the most
reactive. However, for heavier atoms, electrons in inner subshells can have higher energy
than those in the outer subshell; for example, the 3d electrons have more energy than the
4s electrons and are, therefore, most important in chemical reactions.
The number of valence shell electrons determines the group to which the element
belongs. The type of orbital in which the atom’s outermost electrons reside determines the
block to which it belongs. The s-block comprises groups 1 and 2 (plus helium), the p-block
comprises the last six groups (13 through 18), the d-block contains all transition metals
(groups 3 to 12). The lanthanides (elements 57–71) and actinides (elements 89–103) form
the f-block. Elements within each block exhibit some similarity in their properties.
For more details about the periodic table, its applications, and the element properties,
