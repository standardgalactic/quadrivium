About the Authors
Natalie J. Sayer began studying and applying Lean before it was formally
known as Lean. Over her 20-year career in the automotive industry in the
United States and Mexico, Natalie honed her skills applying Lean and
Organizational Development methods across functional areas of Fortune 130
companies. In 1996, Natalie was an instrumental team member in the Lean
transformation of a GM facility in Matamoros, Mexico. The team was awarded
the 1996 GM President’s Council Honors for the project. While working with
General Motors, she had multiple opportunities to visit and learn from New
United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Natalie has trained, coached,
mentored, and rolled up her sleeves to implement Lean practices, whether
working in a company or volunteering at a food bank.
She received a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from the University of
Dayton in 1988 and a Master of Manufacturing Systems Engineering from the
University of Michigan in 1992. She is a graduate of Coach University and
Corporate Coach University. Natalie is also a Six Sigma Black Belt and a
Global Leadership Executive Coach.
In 2003, Natalie founded I-Emerge, an Arizona-based global consultancy dedi-
cated to the facilitation of people and processes experiencing significant
change. The I-Emerge toolbox includes executive and personal coaching,
group facilitation, Lean methods, public speaking, and Organizational
Development tools and assessments. She is a passionate people person, who
lives her life with the convictions that “there is always a better way” and
“change won’t happen without the people.”
Beyond I-Emerge, Natalie can be found on stage acting in musical theater,
teaching graduate school, traveling to exotic places, learning something new,
working on causes advancing people and literacy, or spending time with
friends and family.
Bruce Williams strives for perfection and added value as a scientist, educa-
tor, consultant, and entrepreneur. Leveraging the Lean principle of standard-
ized work, this is his third For Dummies book in three years, having
previously coauthored the best-selling Six Sigma For Dummies in 2005 and the
Six Sigma Workbook For Dummies in 2006.
Undergraduate degrees in physics and astrophysics from the University of
Colorado testify to his early pursuit of understanding the ultimate nature of
root cause.

He was a sculler in the value stream of aerospace systems, where he shot the
rapids in the tumultuous whitewater of the Hubble Space Telescope program.
With graduate degrees in technical management and computer science from
Johns Hopkins University and the University of Colorado, Bruce elevated his
value-stream role to that of tugboat captain, leading and managing technical
teams and projects.
A decade of personal Kaizen has inspired his continuous journey through
technology, software, business development, and management. A Kaikaku
moment unleashed his entrepreneurial self in 1999. He is now sea captain of
Savvi International, charting the deeper value-stream waters of solutions for
business performance improvement using Six Sigma, Lean, and Business
Process Management.
He lives with his standard family in the rural desert foothills of North
Scottsdale, Arizona, flowing just-in-time value in response to their continuous
demand pull. He regularly suffers the muri of 5S’ing the house on weekends.
His hobbies include mucking the muda of the family horses.

Dedication
Natalie J. Sayer: To Frank Cooney, Al Billis, and Pam Oakes, my first Lean
teachers; to Jim, Patt, and Eric Sayer, my family who support all my endeav-
ors; and to Anne Ramsey, Derek O’Neal, Lori Kobriger, and the rest of my
inner circle. Thank you all.
Bruce Williams: To the Lean person within all of us. Recognize and nurture
your Lean self. Every waste you eliminate today sets the stage for a better
world tomorrow.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
The authors acknowledge Craig Gygi for his expertise, dedication, and
encouragement. You established the standard for us to follow; we hope we’ve
done you proud.
We especially thank Frank Cooney for his mentoring, advice, and technical
review. Lean can be a hard thing to pin down. Thanks, Frank, for bringing
your tremendous body of practical experience to bear.
We’d also like to acknowledge our good friends and colleagues Janet Young,
Vern Young, Dr. Deborah Peck, Eleanor Clements, Scott Kurish, and Dr. Kiran
Garimella for your counsel, ideas, review, and support. Additionally, we’d like
to acknowledge everyone at the Phoenix Think Tank, a place where great
minds, ideas, and support meet to create “an exquisite shifting in thought.”
Thanks to Ken Carraher of iGrafx and Debbie Rosen of webMethods for their
unflinching support in providing whatever we needed. We could easily have
filled the book with value-stream maps, process models, and dashboards.
We’ll just have to save them all for the Lean Workbook For Dummies!
As authors and researchers, we humbly bow to the miracle that is Google.
All people interested in Lean owe their ongoing gratitude to Mark Graban and
his associates, who through their blog site translate Lean to the world
around us.
As consumers, and on behalf of consumers everywhere, we acknowledge the
uniquely groundbreaking contributions of brilliant pioneers W. Edwards
Deming, Taiichi Ohno, and Shigeo Shingo, as well as U.S. Lean leaders Norm
Bodek and Jim Womack. Through their achievements, we are all better off.
But most of all, we acknowledge the many thousands of Lean practitioners
around the world, who regularly confront established structures, functional
silos, arcane accounting practices, and entrenched procedures to cut the
waste and find the real customer value. You make Lean thrive. You are our
heroes.

Introduction
T
he principles and practices of Lean organizations are recognized the
world over as the most powerful and effective way to build and sustain
continuously improving businesses and institutions. Following a Lean path,
any business in any industry of any size or type can improve itself continu-
ously over the long term. Led by advancements first pioneered at the Toyota
Motor Corporation over 50 years ago, Lean is now established as the most
consistently successful approach to organizing and operating any enterprise.
If you’re in certain manufacturing industries, or public institutions like the
U.S. military, you’ve probably heard about Lean. You may even have been
through a Kaizen event or been part of implementing a pull system. If so,
you’ve already experienced some of the power of Lean tools.
But if you’re like most people, the term Lean itself may be unfamiliar to you,
let alone its principles and practices. Even within those businesses and
organizations that have adopted Lean methods, most people don’t really
understand the bigger picture of Lean. Organizations often implement Lean
piecemeal, leaving some of the most important elements behind — and with
much less than optimal results.
For decades, the whole system of Lean principles and practices was known
only to specialized manufacturers, certain academic researchers, and quality
gurus. The Toyota Production System (TPS) was the incubator where the
methods, techniques, and tools of Lean were pioneered and refined. Its full
potential has been a mystery to most organizations and professionals.
All that began to change in the late 1980s, as the term Lean was coined to
describe the fundamentals of business systems like TPS to the rest of the
world. As the understanding of Lean has spread across continents, industries,
and organizations, it has become less of a mystery and much easier to under-
stand and implement.
Simply stated, Lean is a philosophy and a proven long-term approach that
aligns everything in the business to deliver increasing customer value. It’s
about orienting people and systems to deliver a continuous stream of value
to the customer, and eliminate waste and deficiencies in the process. Lean is
an everyday practice at all levels to perform consistently, as well as to consis-
tently improve performance.

About This Book
This book makes Lean accessible to you. We wrote it because Lean is applica-
ble everywhere — it’s applicable in large and complex corporations, but also
in small businesses and industries, as well as public-sector institutions — at
all levels.
We wrote this book for you, the individual. You may be a small-business
owner, an ambitious career person, or a manager who wants to know what
Lean is and how to apply it. You may be a college student or job applicant
who wants to have an edge in upcoming job interviews. No matter who you
are, if you want to know more about Lean, this is the book for you.
Lean For Dummies is not just an overview or survey of Lean. It’s a compre-
hensive description of the philosophies and principles of Lean, as well as
the methods and tools to put Lean into practice.
This book is
 A reference book that’s organized into parts, chapters, and sections, so
that you can flip right to what you need, when you need it
 A comprehensive text that addresses both the common tools of Lean
and the improvement principles and practices
 A guide for leading a Lean initiative, helping you identify and manage
Lean projects, and using Lean tools and procedures
 Step-by-step instructions for Value Stream Mapping and the methodology
of Lean projects
 Instructions on where you can go for additional help, because the field
of Lean is much too large to fit in just a few hundred pages
Lean is different, and it contains Japanese terms and ideas that may be foreign
to you. But we’ve taken this difficult subject and made it understandable
through examples, simple explanations, and visual aids.
Conventions Used in This Book
When a specialized word first appears in our book, we italicize it, and provide
a definition. We also italicize any foreign-language words, including the many
Japanese terms that make up the lingo of Lean.
For terms and phrases that industry practitioners use as acronyms, we define
the term first and then use it in its abbreviated form going forward.

Foolish Assumptions
We assume you’ve heard something about Lean and are intrigued and com-
pelled to find out more, for one or more of the following reasons:
 You’re contemplating using Lean in your business or organization, and
you need to understand what you might be in for.
 Your business or organization is implementing Lean, and you need to get
up to speed. Perhaps you’ve even been tapped to participate in a Kaizen
event or a Value Stream Mapping exercise.
 You believe Lean is the pathway to better performance in your job and
can help you advance your career.
 You’re considering a job or career change, and your new opportunities
require you to understand Lean practices.
 You’re a student in business, international business, operations, or
industrial engineering and you realize that Lean is part of your future.
We assume that you realize Lean demands a rigorous approach to analyzing
the value stream of business processes. We also assume that you accept that
Lean practice calls for capturing data and applying analytical tools to discover
the true nature of value creation and the causes of waste in your environment.
In addition, we assume that you might be from any industry, including manu-
facturing, service, transactional, healthcare, or even government. For these
reasons, we have devoted several chapters of this book to describing and
defining the Lean toolset.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
We break this book into five separate parts. Each chapter is written as an
independent standalone section, which means you can move around the
book and delve into a given topic without necessarily having to read all the
preceding material first. Anywhere we expound upon or extend other mater-
ial, we cross-reference the chapter or part of origin, so you can tie it together.
Part I: Lean Basics
Part I is an overview of Lean, including the pedigree, tenets, and language of
Lean. In this part, we address the key tenets underlying the foundation of
Lean practice. Chapter 1 is a comprehensive overview of Lean. Chapter 2
addresses the key tenets as well as the language and lexicon of Lean.
Part II: Understanding Flow
and the Value Stream
Part II gets into the essence of Lean: understanding the way value is created
and flowed to the customer. In four chapters, we thoroughly describe the flow
of value. Chapter 3 defines value precisely, in terms of the customer and the
end consumer. Chapter 4 introduces and explains the process of Value Stream
Mapping, one of the key tools of Lean. Chapter 5 explains how to use a Value
Stream Map to define where you want to go and how you’ll approach getting
there. Chapter 6 explains the principles and practices of Kaizen — the basis
for continuous improvement.
Part III: The Lean Toolbox
In this part, we present a comprehensive listing and overview of the many
customer, value stream, flow, pull, perfection, and management tools of Lean
in four chapters. Collectively, these tools form the Lean toolkit.
Chapter 7 describes the many tools used to understand the value stream
and customer needs and wants. Chapter 8 describes the flow and pull tools.
Chapter 9 covers the perfection tools used within Lean to create standard-
ized work, improve with Kaizen, visualization, and everyday improvements.
Chapter 10 addresses the management tools of hoshin, gemba, and the grow-
ing suite of software applications that support Lean practice.

Lean For Dummies 

Part IV: The Lean Enterprise
Part IV contains five chapters and describes how Lean becomes part of the
enterprise. In this part, we explain the issues and challenges with implement-
ing Lean in an organization. Chapter 11 addresses organizational issues
specifically. Chapter 12 focuses on the people elements of Lean — often the
most overlooked (and risky) part. Chapter 13 addresses the life cycle of a
Lean implementation, from strategy to startup and, finally, evolution. Chapter
14 explains how Lean works in the different functions and organization of a
business. Chapter 15 addresses Lean in different industries.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part, in the For Dummies tradition, is a compilation of key points of refer-
ence. Chapter 16 discusses ten practices for success. Chapter 17 addresses
ten pitfalls to avoid. And in Chapter 18, we tell you about ten additional
places you can go for help.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll see small symbols called icons in the margins,
and these highlight special types of information. We use these to help you
better understand and apply the material. When you see any of the following
icons, this is what they mean:

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
The beauty of a For Dummies book is that you don’t have to start at the
beginning and slowly work your way through. Instead, each chapter is self-
contained, which means you can start with whichever chapters interest you
the most. You can use Lean For Dummies as a reference book, which means
you can jump in and out of certain parts, chapters, and sections as you wish.
Here are some suggestions on where to start:
 If you’re brand new to Lean, start at the beginning, with Chapter 1.
 Want to know about the basics of Value Stream Mapping? Check out
Chapter 4.
 If you want to know all the tools of Lean, jump in at Chapter 7.
 Interested in the organizational and people elements of Lean? Go to
Chapters 11 and 12.
 If you want to understand all the Lean lingo and terminology, flip to the
glossary.
Lean is a journey. Like any journey, it is exciting and exhilarating, stretching
and life altering, challenging and unexpected. But it is worth it. We wish you
well on this journey. With this book by your side, you have what it takes to
live Lean and thrive!

Like a diet and exercise regime for your body, Lean 
is a way to get your business fit for life, through a focus 
on your customer, the implementation of new business
practices, and the ongoing commitment to continuous
improvement. In this part, we fill you in on the founda-
tions, philosophy, and basics of Lean.

W
hen you first hear the word lean, it conjures up an image. Most likely,
you’re seeing a mental picture of thin people — like long-distance run-
ners, or those aerobics junkies who somehow don’t seem to have an ounce of
extra fat on them. Or maybe you’re thinking about lean food — the foods that
are lower in fat and, of course, much better for you. Lean also implies light-
weight, in the sense of speed and agility, with a sort of edge or underlying
aggressiveness that recalls the rhyme “lean and mean.”
That’s because the word lean suggests not only a physical condition, but also
a certain discipline — a mental toughness. The notion of Lean carries with it a
commitment to a set of principles and practices that not only get you fit, but
keep you fit. People who are lean seem to be that way not just temporarily, but
continuously. Lean people are committed to being lean; they act a certain way
in their habits and routines. Lean isn’t a fad or diet — it’s a way of life.
Now take this concept and apply it to a business or organization. What do
you see? What does lean mean, business-wise? Back in 1988, a group of
researchers working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), led
by Dr. James P. Womack, were examining the international automotive indus-
try, and observed unique behaviors at the Toyota Motor Company (TMC).
Researcher John Krafcik and the others struggled with a term to describe
what they were seeing. They looked at all the performance attributes of a
Toyota-style system, compared to traditional mass production. What they
saw was a company that:
 Needed less effort to design, make, and service their products
 Required less investment to achieve a given level of production capacity
 Produced products with fewer defects

 Used fewer suppliers
 Performed its key processes — including concept-to-launch, order-to-
delivery, and problem-to-repair — in less time and with less effort
 Needed less inventory at every step
 Had fewer employee injuries
They concluded that a company like this, a company that uses less of every-
thing, is a “lean” company.
And just like that, the term lean became associated with a certain business
capability — the ability to accomplish more with less. Lean organizations use
less human effort to perform their work, less material to create their prod-
ucts and services, less time to develop them, and less energy and space to
produce them. They’re oriented toward customer demand, and develop high-
quality products and services in the most effective and economical manner
possible. (See Table 1-1 for a comparison of mass production and Lean.)
The practice of Lean — from here on capitalized because, in this context, it’s
a proper noun — is, therefore, a commitment to the set of tenets and behav-
iors that not only gets your organization fit, but keeps it that way.

Part I: Lean Basics 

Lean has become a worldwide movement. Lean concepts aren’t new; the
techniques, in various forms, have been practiced in companies large and
small around the globe for decades. But the term Lean has crystallized a par-
ticular set of ideas and concepts:
 Maintaining an unrelenting focus on providing customer value
 Adopting a philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement
 Providing exactly what’s needed at the right time, based on customer
demand
 Keeping things moving — in a value-added, effective manner
 Using techniques for reducing variation and eliminating waste
 Respecting people
 Taking the long-term view
Lean has been adopted across a broad range of industries, most notably auto-
motive, but also aerospace, banking, construction, energy, healthcare, and
government. Dozens of consulting firms, hundreds of training courses, and
thousands of books and articles all chronicle the many aspects of Lean prac-
tice. Consulting firms have developed Lean implementation programs for
every business function, including management, manufacturing, administra-
tion, supply chains, product design, and even software development. Lean has
become a recognized methodology. It even has an award: The Shingo Prize,
called “the Nobel Prize of Manufacturing” by Business Week, was developed
to promote Lean practices, and has been awarded in North America each
year since 1988. Honoring the renowned engineering genius Shigeo Shingo,
its purpose is to “promote awareness of Lean manufacturing concepts.”
This is all interesting enough, but what really matters is that the customers
are the better for it — much better, in fact. It’s been invisible to most people,
but Lean has brought to everyone vastly improved products and services —
and it’s brought them faster, cheaper, and more reliably. Its successes have
saved billions of dollars. Its competitiveness has forced previously bloated,
self-absorbed organizations to retool themselves and focus on customer value.
And it has equipped struggling companies and industries with methods and
techniques to improve their performance.
The many dimensions of Lean — its tenets and philosophies, the method-
ology and techniques, the tools and applications, and the management 
frameworks — have evolved considerably since that day in 1988. Lean is now
a science and a practice.
11
Chapter 1: Defining Lean

In this book, we fill you in on the origins and applications of Lean practice.
But although Lean has a toolset, it is much more than a set of tools. Lean is a
philosophy, an approach to your life and work. Lean is a journey, with no pre-
defined path or end state. It’s a way forward that guarantees continuous
improvement. Lean isn’t a diet or a fad, it’s a way of life.
What Is Lean?
Lean is a broad catchphrase that describes a holistic and sustainable approach
that uses less of everything to give you more. Lean is a business strategy based
on satisfying the customer by delivering quality products and services that are
just what the customer needs, when the customer needs them, in the amount
required, at the right price, while using the minimum of materials, equipment,
space, labor, and time. Lean practices enable an organization to reduce its
development cycles, produce higher-quality products and services at lower
costs, and use resources more efficiently.
Although the term Lean has been most directly associated with manufactur-
ing and production processes, Lean practices cover the total enterprise,
embracing all aspects of operations, including internal functions, supplier
networks, and customer value chains.
Lean is a continuous, evolutionary process of change and adaptation, not a
singular, idealized vision or technology-driven goal state. A central organizing
principle is the long-term renewable enterprise, where the organization builds
sustaining relationships with all its stakeholders, including employees, man-
agers, owners, suppliers, distributors, and customers, as well as community,
society, and the environment.
Lean means less of many things — less waste, shorter cycle times, fewer
suppliers, less bureaucracy. But Lean also means more — more employee
knowledge and empowerment, more organizational agility and capability,
more productivity, more satisfied customers, and more long-term success.
Waste not, want not
What’s the least possible amount of material, time, space, facilities, capital,
energy, effort, or whatever else you need to develop and deliver a given prod-
uct or service to your customer? You wouldn’t want to use any more than
you really need to get the customer what they require. Anything more than
the absolute minimum is essentially waste.
12
Part I: Lean Basics 

The sources of waste are everywhere:
 Using more raw material than necessary: Not only are you buying, trans-
porting, and storing the extra raw material in the first place, but you then
have to pay to transport and dispose of damaged or obsolete goods.
 Spending more time to develop and produce your products and ser-
vices: You’re not just making the customer wait — you’re also consum-
ing energy, wasting people’s time and using facilities to store and move
around materials and work. And there’s the opportunity cost of delayed
payment.
 Making mistakes: Not only are mistakes frustrating to you, your cowork-
ers, and your management, as well as the customer, but you have to
spend more time and use more materials doing it over.
 Overproducing and carrying excess inventory: Excess inventory
directly wastes space. Plus, it has to be handled and maintained. And
what’s the sense in making more than you’re selling?
 Using more space than necessary: Space is facility and capital cost, as
well as the energy and labor to maintain it.
 Spending more money than necessary: It doesn’t take an accountant to
know that spending more money than you should to get something done
is wasteful!
 Using more equipment and tools than necessary: Not only are those
extra tools and equipment expensive, but they also have to be stored,
repaired, and maintained.
 Involving more people than necessary: People are extremely valuable
and expensive, and they should be engaged in doing only what’s most
important.
 Having incorrect or incomplete information or instructions: It results
in mistakes, rework, scrap, lost time, and missed deadlines — plus, it
can be hazardous.
 Having people work improperly: This is the most wasteful of all. Not
only is it a direct waste of time and effort, but it’s damaging to the psyche
and to morale. It’s also potentially physically harmful and dangerous.
The logic of Lean
In Lean, you pursue understanding the source and rooting out the causes of
waste. The practice of Lean as the root-cause eliminator of wastefulness is
based on a core set of fundamental assumptions. Follow this logic:
13
Chapter 1: Defining Lean

 You’re in business to sell products and services to customers. The
customer has the need and defines the purpose. Everything begins
and ends with what the customer requires. Everything else is fluff.
 The customer is the only true arbiter of value. The customer is willing
to give you their money for your product or service only when they
believe it’s a fair exchange of value. It has to be the right combination of
quality products and services, in the right place, at the right time and at
the right price.
 Value-creation is a process. A combination of steps — such as market-
ing, design, production, processing, delivery and support — rightly
performed, will result in the creation of products and services that the
customer will properly value.
 Waste diminishes the process of value creation. Things that naturally
creep in and prevent the steps in a process from flowing quickly and
effectively will inhibit the creation of customer value.
 A perfect process has no waste. If every step in the process is fully
capable, acts only when necessary, flows perfectly, and adapts to per-
form exactly as needed, the process will develop and deliver products
and services without waste.
 Perfect processes maximize customer value. The closer to perfection a
process becomes, the more effective the creation of value, the more sat-
isfied the customers, and the more successful the endeavor.
No one has ever experienced the perfect process, but Lean continually strives
for perfection. Lean is the strategy and approach, and it provides the methods
and tools for pursuing the perfect process.
Where is Lean?
Lean is found wherever there is waste, and anywhere there is opportunity for
improvement. In other words, Lean is found everywhere. It’s not confined to
any particular part of the organization or function of the enterprise. Although
formal Lean practices began in manufacturing, they apply across the board.
It’s in the enterprise
Lean is a business-improvement initiative, best applied enterprise-wide.
A common misconception holds Lean as a sort of manufacturing quality
program. Not so. The philosophy, principles, and practices of Lean are
14
Part I: Lean Basics 

applicable anywhere, and they’re most effective when applied across the
entire organization. You may have heard jargon that implies certain groups or
functions practice Lean, such as the following:
 Lean Production or Lean Manufacturing: Early in the formalization of
Lean techniques, the practices were modeled after manufacturing and
production approaches in companies like Toyota. Enormous successes
ensued in other manufacturing companies as Lean practitioners applied
the techniques in other manufacturing environments. As a result, these
labels took hold.
 Lean Office and Lean Administration: These references note that the
practices have been applied with great success in office environments,
where the value streams are policy-based, information-oriented decision
making and involve the effective management of transactions and data.
 Lean Management: This term is most often associated with the role
of managers in the Lean enterprise. This covers the management of a
Lean initiative, as well as the personal Lean practices of the managers
themselves.
 Lean Thinking: Because Lean is more than just tools and techniques,
people within an effective Lean organization apply Lean practices as a
way of thinking — a way of approaching issues and challenges. After
you’ve truly adopted the ways of Lean, you’ll be a Lean thinker.
Lean Thinking is also the name of a book by James Womack and Daniel
Jones, first published in 1996, which stands as a milestone in Lean. It was
in this landmark work that everyone began to associate Lean with more
than just Toyota and automotive and began thinking of Lean as a move-
ment of its own.
Each of these monikers represents an element of Lean in its own right, but
only as a single facet or subset of the greater Lean enterprise. In fact, Lean is
all of these and more.
Think of Lean in the enterprise not as a group of functional or departmental
practices, but as a set of multidisciplinary practices that cross functional
lines. Lean focuses on the processes that create customer value, which by
their nature are cross-functional. Examples include the supplier-assembler
process, the assembler-distributor-customer process, the marketing-design-
development process, the company-shareholder process, and the company-
government-regulatory process. In each of these cases, work is not aligned by
classic Western-style functional departments. Instead, the process is facili-
tated by multidisciplinary teams — and in a Lean enterprise, the individuals
on these teams are cross-trained as well.
15
Chapter 1: Defining Lean

It’s in the people
Lean practice calls for a set of facilitating tools and techniques (covered in
Part III) that focus the organization on eliminating waste and maximizing cus-
tomer value. Although the tools are important, Lean is just as much about the
people as the tools. This is a critical point — companies that have failed to
recognize this have done so with disastrous consequences.
A successful Lean journey puts as much emphasis on the people in the orga-
nization as it does on the methods, tools, and techniques of Lean practice.
The journey must engage everyone, continually educate and train them, chal-
lenge and empower them. Employees must be safe and feel secure in their
work environment and job situations. They must be stimulated and incen-
tivized, celebrated and compensated.
People are highly valued in the Lean organization. They are more important
than tools and fixtures, equipment, material, or capital. Some Lean organiza-
tions have promised work for life, in return for an individual’s commitment
and dedication to pursuing perfection.
It’s in the culture
In a Lean organization, the tenets and philosophy of Lean are fundamentally
part of its fiber; Lean is very much embedded in the organization’s culture.
Everyone practices Lean techniques habitually. When you observe an organi-
zation practicing Lean, you will see that:
 People always look at activities as processes, and consider them in terms
of customer value and eliminating the wasteful non-value-added steps.
 People naturally call for Kaizen events to brainstorm the elimination of
waste, and implement Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) or other projects to
effect improvements.
 People regularly communicate through Value-Stream Maps, team meet-
ings in the work area, process flow diagrams, communication centers,
graphical analyses, control charts, and other explicit instruments.
 Everyone makes improvement suggestions — continually.
 Visual signs and cues are everywhere. People are in deliberate and deci-
sive motion, performing standardized work. Meetings are short and crisp.
 People regularly take on new roles and tasks in order to be more com-
plete team contributors. They embrace learning, share knowledge, and
are open to changes and new ways of doing things.
 The business builds long-lasting relationships with employees, suppliers,
providers, and customers.
16
Part I: Lean Basics 

What it’s not
Lean is a lot of things — it’s a philosophy; a set of principles; a language (com-
plete with its own jargon and acronyms); a management strategy; a methodol-
ogy; a set of techniques, behaviors, tools, and even specialty software — all of
which support this notion of reducing waste and delivering long-term customer
value. Lean is often associated with other process improvement programs and
initiatives, and in particular it is frequently paired with Six Sigma (more on this
later in this chapter). And Lean, as a way of thinking and behaving, can be part
of many initiatives.
So Lean is a lot of things. But there are a number of things that it isn’t:
 Lean isn’t consulting foo-foo dust. It’s not just a bunch of manager-speak,
arcane mapping sessions, or feel-good teaming exercises sprinkled with
hoity-sounding Japanese terms. Lean is a well-grounded, mature, and very
real framework for developing and sustaining performance excellence.
 Lean isn’t onerous. Unlike most other process improvement initiatives,
Lean does not require large investments in training or expensive software;
nor does it call for a prescriptive, one-size-fits-all formulaic rollout. It
requires top-down senior-management support, but Lean can begin in a
small group and expand naturally as it grows and as the business needs it.
This ease-of-adoption is why Lean has been so successful in small and
medium-sized companies, and in operating units of large companies.
 Lean isn’t overly analytical and statistical. Certain difficult challenges
will always require deep analysis to characterize, understand, and solve.
But the vast majority of Lean improvements are brought about by very
simple and straightforward exercises, observation, and activities that
anyone can understand and apply.
 Lean isn’t a flash in the pan. It emerged from longstanding practices,
characterized and understood by researchers who were observing what
makes certain businesses work better. Although some Lean concepts
might sound counterintuitive at first — and are very much counter to
how many organizations are run — the tools and techniques of Lean
have been around for decades and are fully complementary to long-
standing proven methods.
 Lean isn’t a Western-style system. Take note of this key point: Lean
may be very much different from what you’re used to. Unlike most
Western-style tools and techniques, Lean is not a quick-hit, big-bang,
upside-the head, technology-enabled, silver-bullet solution to fix yester-
day’s problems right now, today. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Lean is a
continuous, long-term, everyday approach to building the flexibility and
adaptability that enables you to address tomorrow’s challenges as they
happen. Kaizen events and Lean projects often reap significant near-term
benefits, but don’t look to Lean as an overnight sensation. Lean is very
much a long-term deal.
17
Chapter 1: Defining Lean

What makes Lean so special?
Organizations worldwide have a plethora of choices when considering
approaches to both their tactical and strategic pressures and challenges.
Lean is one of many, many options. Why is it so popular?
Companies, organizations, and government entities all know that they must
do something — they can’t just sit still. Gone are the days of doing things the
same old way and being successful regardless — or of just being smart and
hoping for the best. Aggressive, unrelenting global pressures are forcing
everyone to embrace some type of approach and strategy for performance
management and improvement. It’s now a given that you’re going to do
something to improve — so what’s it going to be?
The Lean approach is increasingly popular, because it offers organizations a
sensible, proven, and accessible path to long-term success. Unlike so many of
the alternatives, Lean is something that everyone can understand, everyone
can do, and everyone can benefit from:
 Lean is proven. The principles and techniques of Lean have been prac-
ticed successfully by thousands of organizations of every type and size
in every industry worldwide, spearheaded by nearly 50 years of continu-
ous improvement by one of the world’s most successful corporations.
 Lean makes sense. In an era of mind-boggling complexity, Lean is a solid
foundation for addressing all kinds of challenges — simply. Lean is
broadly applicable in any situation, combining old-world logic and
reason with new-world tools and constraints.
 Lean is accessible. Make no mistake: The performance improvement
industry is big business. All those pundits, purveyors, and progenitors
out there aren’t motivated by strictly altruistic intentions. Most of the
performance improvement alternatives in the marketplace are big-ticket
items, tailor-made for big wallets — and the big egos that carry them.
Not Lean. Lean is accessible to anyone, with any budget. Lean is a seri-
ous commitment but isn’t particularly expensive, exclusive, or difficult.
 Lean is inclusive. The Lean framework is purposely open and embraces
tools and techniques known to solve problems. Lean is fully complemen-
tary with the tools of TQM, TPM, Six Sigma, and BPM, for example, so
it’s not an either/or decision (see “Lean and Its Continuous Process
Improvement Cousins,” later in this chapter, for more on these tools).
Using Lean as a foundation, all the quality, performance, and technology
tools still apply.
18
Part I: Lean Basics 

 Lean is for everyone. Many performance improvement solutions are
strictly tailored for specialty disciplines, requiring advanced skills and
knowledge. Not Lean. Lean is so powerful in part because it is so easily
learned and applied by everyone. No one is excluded.
The Lean Pedigree
While the specific assembly of principles and practices known as Lean date
from the late 1980s, the origins of Lean are much older. Lean has a deep pedi-
gree. Historians cite King Henry III of France in 1574 watching the Venice
Arsenal build complete galley ships in less than an hour using continuous-
flow processes. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin established principles
regarding waste and excess inventory and Eli Whitney developed interchange-
able parts. In the late 19th century, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth pioneered the
modern-day understanding of motion efficiency as it related to work. In the
early 20th century, Frederic Winslow Taylor, the father of scientific manage-
ment, introduced the concepts of standardized work and best-practices. (The
legendary Shigeo Shingo cites Taylor’s 1911 seminal work Principles of
Scientific Management as his inspiration.)
However, it was in Henry Ford’s revolutionary mass-production assembly
plants where many practices first emerged. In 1915, Charles Buxton Going, in
the preface to Arnold and Faurote’s Ford Methods and the Ford Shops, observed:
Ford’s success has startled the country, almost the world, financially,
industrially, mechanically. It exhibits in higher degree than most persons
would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements
of true efficiency, which are: constant increase of quality, great increase
of pay to the workers, repeated reduction in cost to the consumer. And
with these appears, as at once cause and effect, an absolutely incredible
enlargement of output reaching something like one hundred fold in less
than ten years, and an enormous profit to the manufacturer.
Ford also explicitly understood many of the forms of waste and the concepts
of value-added time and effort.
New practices were later developed during the industrial buildups that pre-
ceded and then supported World War II, both in the United States and Japan.
In the United States, quality leaders like W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran
refined management and statistical concepts in support of war production. The
Training within Industry (TWI) Service formalized practices in management,

training, and production, while emphasizing methods and relationships. In
postwar Japan, Deming and Juran worked with Japanese industrial leaders to
apply these practices to reconstruction.
Toyoda and Ohno
The Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was founded by Sakichi Toyoda in 1926,
where he pioneered the practice of jidoka (see Chapter 2). Ten years later, the
company changed its name to Toyota and Toyoda’s son, Kiichiro, and engineer
nephew, Eiji, began producing automobiles with parts from General Motors.
Japan’s entry into World War II in 1941 diverted its efforts to truck production;
during postwar reconstruction, the company nearly went bankrupt.
Meanwhile, Ford regularly invited managers and engineers from around the
world to visit Ford plants and observe his mass-production systems. In the
spring of 1950, Eiji Toyoda participated in an extended three-month visit to
Ford’s famed Rouge plant in Dearborn, Michigan. At that time, the Rouge
plant was largest and most complex manufacturing facility in the world.
Toyota was producing about 2,500 cars a year; Ford was producing nearly
8,000 a day.
Eiji returned to Japan, and with Toyota’s production manager, Taiichi Ohno,
concluded that Ford’s system of mass production would not work for them in
Japan. The domestic Japanese automotive market was too small and too
diversified — ranging from compact cars to luxury executive vehicles and a
variety of trucks. In addition, the postwar native Japanese workforce was not
willing to work under the same substandard conditions as the immigrant
force in the United States. And the capital outlay for facilities and equipment
was too high. Toyoda and Ohno set out to develop an entirely new means of
production, including engineering, manufacture, supply, assembly, and work-
force management.
The Toyota Production System
The Toyota Production System is so famous that it’s referred to simply by its
abbreviation: TPS. TPS is perhaps the most studied system of production and
operations management in the world. Countless companies have visited
Toyota and observed TPS in action. Dozens of books have chronicled its suc-
cesses and hailed its methods.
20
Part I: Lean Basics 

TPS is the birthplace of Lean. Lean Manufacturing, in particular, is essentially
a repackaging of the Toyota Production System. Most of the philosophy and
tenets, as well as the methods, techniques, and tools of Lean are all found
within TPS. What those MIT researchers examined in 1988 and called Lean
was, basically, TPS. The terms Lean Manufacturing and the Toyota Production
System are effectively synonymous.
TPS was principally architected by cousins Eiji and Kiichiro Toyoda and
Taiichi Ohno. History credits Ohno as the Father of TPS. He led its develop-
ment, extension to the supply base, and integration with global partners from
the early 1950s through the 1980s. By the time Lean was introduced to U.S.
manufacturing, Toyota had been evolving and applying TPS successfully for
over 40 years.
Toyota built the first model House of TPS (see Figure 1-1), depicting graphi-
cally that Toyota’s quality sets on the combination of just-in-time, built-in
quality, and highly motivated people. All of this stands on a foundation of
operational stability and Kaizen, bolstered by visual management and stan-
dardized work.

Chapter 1: Defining Lean

Most of the concepts presented in this book — and any book on Lean — are
based on TPS implicitly. You won’t necessarily know when some Lean princi-
ple or practice is based on TPS, but it’s all there. As examples, the just-in-time
concepts were developed at Toyota; jidoka was invented by Sakichi Toyoda;
the seven forms of waste is a Toyota creation. So is Value-Stream Mapping.
So, if you assume that everything in a Lean treatise is basically TPS, you’ll be
mostly right.
Lean and Its Continuous Process
Improvement Cousins
We’ve been awash in business and process improvement programs for
decades. It’s been an alphabet soup of initiatives. Remember TQM, BPR,
MBOs, and QITs? Well, now we also have the likes of TPM, TOC, GMP, QRM,
ISO, Six Sigma, and BPM. They’re all part of continuous process improvement
(CPI). It’s all very confusing — somewhat on purpose!
Because all these initiatives, methodologies, and “systems” focus on the
same basic issues, they have a lot in common. They share some of the same
tools and techniques. They claim similar results. But they also have significant
differences — critical differences — in focus, scope, application, investment,
and return.
Total Quality Management (TQM)
Total Quality Management (TQM) is an umbrella strategy for a quality-driven
organization. TQM calls for quality to act as the driving force behind an orga-
nization’s entire leadership, design, planning, and improvement efforts.
Developed in the 1970s as an amalgam of the different quality movements
and approaches in the United States, Europe, and Japan, interest in TQM
peaked in the early 1990s.
Total Quality Management focuses on culture and organization. The cultural
element demands a quality perspective in all aspects of the company’s
operations. Like other initiatives, TQM emphasizes a customer orientation,
commitment from top management, continuous improvement, fact-based
decision making, fast response, and employee participation. All the quality
and statistical-analysis tools are applicable under TQM.
22
Part I: Lean Basics 

TQM has been applied in manufacturing, education, government, and service
industries, with mixed success. As a broad culture-oriented initiative, it is
challenged by the lack of a focused implementation methodology and direct
measurable results.
Lean, like TQM, can act as the umbrella strategy for a corporation. Lean
incorporates TQM principles and practices.
Six Sigma
Six Sigma emerged in the mid-1990s, self-proclaimed as “the world’s greatest
problem-solving methodology.” With a well-defined implementation, training,
and management framework, Six Sigma gave form and focus to the applica-
tion of quality tools and techniques — and has delivered staggering bottom-
line results.
Six Sigma was first developed as an internal quality initiative at Motorola,
which won the inaugural U.S. Malcolm Baldridge National Quality Award in
1988 as a result. Six Sigma hit the national stage following its successful adop-
tion by General Electric in 1996. Ten years later, over two-thirds of the global
Fortune 500 companies practice Six Sigma in some form, and the estimated
combined savings now well exceeds $100 billion!
Six Sigma is a way to identify and control variation in the processes that most
affect performance and profits. Following a prescriptive methodology, trained
practitioners known as Black Belts analyze root cause and implement correc-
tive action. (Many of the tools of Six Sigma are common to Lean.) Black Belt
projects typically take four to six months and can return hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in value — and more. Six Sigma techniques, and its famous
Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) problem-solving methodol-
ogy, are applicable within a Lean framework as a subordinate toolset for elim-
inating waste from defects and reducing process variance. (Read Six Sigma
For Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo, and Bruce Williams, and the Six
Sigma Workbook For Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Bruce Williams, and Terry
Gustafson [both published by Wiley], to find out everything you need to
know about Six Sigma.)
You may have heard of the terms Lean Six Sigma or sometimes Lean Sigma.
Be careful here. These purport to be a natural combination of the two meth-
ods, to bring you the best of both worlds. What many of the Six Sigma consul-
tants have done, in fact, is to cherry-pick a few Lean tools — particularly pull
techniques and waste-reduction tools — and subordinate them into the Six
23
Chapter 1: Defining Lean

Sigma deployment framework. Although this certainly extends the power and
capabilities of Six Sigma, it’s not Lean. In particular, these other methods tend
to neglect the people and cultural elements, the accessibility and inclusive-
ness, and the everyday Kaizen.
Theory of Constraints (TOC)
Theory of Constraints (TOC) is based on the premise that productivity (or the
rate of revenue generation) is always limited at the point of at least one con-
straining process — a bottleneck. Only by increasing throughput at the bottle-
neck process can overall throughput be increased. TOC is sometimes referred
to as constraint management.
TOC focuses on removing the constraints that limit an organization’s perfor-
mance from achieving its full potential. TOC, with its emphasis on process
flow and waste reduction, is an effective toolset for Lean practitioners in
examining bottlenecks in the value stream. TOC is particularly useful with its
focus on throughput.
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM)
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a value-added maintenance concept.
TPM has been implemented as a standalone process in manufacturing environ-
ments, as a foundational strategy of TPS, or as the maintenance component of
a TQM program. TPM focuses on maintenance as an integral part of the busi-
ness. The goal is to minimize emergency and unscheduled maintenance by con-
verting to planned maintenance activities. TPM evolved from TQM and is
proven as an effective foundational methodology within a Lean framework.
ISO-9000
ISO 9000 is a family of standards for quality management systems. ISO 9000
was developed from the British Standards Institution’s BS 5750 and is now
maintained by the International Standards Organization (ISO) and adminis-
tered by accreditation and certification bodies. Interest in ISO 9000 peaked in
the late 1990s.
ISO 9000 does not guarantee the quality of end products and services; rather,
it certifies that consistent business processes are being applied. Standardized
work defined in Lean organizations becomes the basis upon which ISO 9000
procedures are defined.
24
Part I: Lean Basics 

Business Process Management (BPM)
The term Business Process Management (BPM) refers to activities performed
by businesses to optimize and adapt their formal processes — particularly
those processes controlled by automated systems. BPM is often most
directly associated with technology and software systems that implement
extensive integration and management of process data and information. BPM
includes process modeling, data integration, workflow, and business activity
monitoring (known as BAM). BPM is a significant enabler for Lean, and
directly facilitates Lean goals and practices. BPM practices include:
 Modeling tools help define and categorize standardized work.
 Data-integration capabilities capture critical supplier, inventory,
cycle time, status, delivery, and other value-stream characterization
parameters.
 Activity-monitoring tools regularly check the performance of processes
against control limits, alerting people or other processes if key indica-
tors trend improperly.
BPM is the systems counterpart to Lean, facilitating Lean solutions in
technology.

I
f you’ve ever sojourned to a foreign place, you’ve experienced culture
shock first hand. At first the new land seems strange — the food, the cus-
toms and the language, even if they speak your native tongue. Delicacies in
one land may not be so delectable in another. Greetings can be confusing: Do
you bow, kiss, or shake hands?
If you ask for directions, the natives may look at you as though you’re crazy
or give you seemingly nonsensical information. Part of the issue is that you
have no context for the foundations and language of the culture. With time,
and information, you assimilate into the new place. You start to learn some
basic greetings and phrases, practice daily customs, and, eventually, with
persistence and diligence, become more like a native.
When you undertake a Lean journey, at first it may feel this foreign. The
terms are new. The business practices may seem strange or counterintuitive.
But with time, education, application, and understanding, you’ll become a
Lean native.
In this chapter, we fill you in on the basic principles of Lean, and tell you
all about the seven forms of waste. This chapter provides a high-level view
of Lean — like the travel guide you may read on the way to that exotic
destination.

Understanding Lean Basics
Chapter 1 explains how Lean has evolved over time, and how closely aligned
it is with the Toyota Production System (TPS). The various experts and differ-
ent practitioners of Lean don’t necessarily agree on a fixed set of standard
principles or tenets. But there is a generally accepted framework for Lean
practice and the related TPS elements, as well as the underlying foundational
wisdom. Collectively, they form a broad framework that includes everything
from principles to methods and tools, leadership models, and even Lean
thinking.
Creating the foundation
Commonly held tenets of Lean include Customer Value; Value-Stream
Analysis; and Improvement, Flow, Pull, and Perfection. Lean always starts and
ends with the customer. The customer is the one who defines and determines
value of the product and service. The Value Stream is used in Lean to
describe all of the activities that are performed and information required, in
order to produce and deliver a given product or service. To create value in
the most effective way for the customer, you must focus on improving flow,
applying pull, and striving for perfection.
Understanding customer value
The fundamental premise for all Lean organizations, and the first step of any
Lean undertaking, is to identify the customer and what the customer values.
What does the customer really want? What does the customer want today?
What will the customer want tomorrow?
Customers are always changing — today’s wants become tomorrow’s needs.
Technology, markets, and demographics all change customer behavior. Can
you imagine living without your mobile phone, the Internet, or e-mail? Little
more than a decade ago, these things didn’t even exist (at least not in a form
that was usable by your average consumer) — now they’ve become a neces-
sity. All you have to do is take a trip on an airplane and listen for the chorus
of phones being turned on the instant the plane touches the ground, and
you’ll know how true this is.
When you provide a product or service, you need to be tightly in step with
(and even slightly ahead of) what your customer wants. Tools like Quality
Function Deployment (QFD) help capture customer wants and translate them
into standards that you can implement in the stream of activity that creates
customer value — the value stream.
28
Part I: Lean Basics 

In Lean, the customer defines what behaviors in the value stream are value-
added. To be deemed value added, any process or activity acting on the prod-
uct or service in any way must meet three key criteria:
 The customer must be willing to pay for it. Payment is generally
thought of in monetary terms, but it could include time or other
resources.
 The activity must transform the product or service in some way.
 The activity must be done correctly the first time.
You can find more about customers, consumers, and value in Chapter 3.
Analyzing the value stream
When you pop into your local supermarket to buy groceries, have you ever
stopped to think about all the activities that had to occur, in just the right
sequence, in order for you to readily buy what’s on your list? Consider pro-
duce. You can now find just about all fruits and vegetables year-round. Look
in the produce section and you’ll find products from around the globe. The
apples may have more frequent-flier miles that you do! From the fields,
through transport, to your store, and ultimately to your table, hundreds of
events must occur precisely the right way and at precisely the right time in
order for the product to be available to you at a price and a freshness level
that you’ll buy.
Value is delivered to customers through the value stream. In an ideal world,
the value stream would consist only of value-added activities and the associ-
ated flow of support information. That is the ideal to aim for, but in reality,
waste exists in some form in every process. (We introduce you to the various
types of waste in the “Muda, muda, muda” section, later in this chapter.)
After you understand what the customer values, the next step in Lean is to
identify and analyze the stream of activities that creates that customer value.
In this analysis, you identify all the activities and events that occur to get the
product or service to your customer. You also identify the information flow
that supports the value-stream activities. These activities and events may
occur at your facility, or they may be upstream in supplier facilities or down-
stream in distribution or delivery. Generally, a business begins its improve-
ment efforts with what it controls directly, and later expands beyond its
organizational boundaries.
In Lean, you use a tool called the Value-Stream Map to capture and specify the
activities, information, timing, and events in the value stream. (Value-Stream
Mapping is an important activity, and we cover it extensively in Chapters 4
and 5.) First, you identify the value stream in its current state: How does it all
29
Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

work today? Then you identify the ideal state: How would the value stream
look if you could do it all perfectly? This ideal-state Value-Stream Map enables
you to visualize what the value stream might look like with no waste — only
value-added activities.
After the current and ideal-state Value-Stream Maps are defined, a Lean team
works to close the gap between the two states. The team conducts Kaizen
(continuous improvement) activities that bring the two states closer
together. Everyone in the organization is involved in Kaizen, both as individu-
als and as part of teams. In a Lean organization, Kaizen is performed as part
of regular business practice. (Chapter 6 addresses Kaizen in detail.)
In order to design, develop, or deliver any product or service, there is an
associated supporting flow of information. This information is captured in
the Value-Stream Map. When you buy something, for example, inventory is
decreased. In order to replenish the inventory, information must flow from
the retail outlet to all the suppliers. Some retailers, like Wal-Mart and Ahold,
have implemented Business Process Management (BPM) systems so that
from the minute you check out, the information is sent upstream and triggers
reorders.
Maintaining flow
When you turn on your tap, you expect to have a clean, consistent flow of
water. As the customer, you’re assuming that the water is disease-free, safe to
drink, and fully available when you want it, at a reasonable price. If a pump
breaks or a controller fails somewhere in the delivery system, that’s someone
else’s problem. You, the customer, expect flowing water on demand. The
water supplier must maintain its equipment, verify the water quality, and
ensure that the delivery system is safe and reliable. The supplier has little or
no room for mistakes. This is an example of a system of flow.
In the Lean world, this concept of flow is applied to everything, including,
and especially, discrete products and services. Ideally, from the time the first
action is taken in the value stream, products and services never stop until
they reach the customer. From the moment the customer asks for it, products
and services make their journey through a set of only value-added activities
until they reach their destination.
Think about that: What it would it take for a product or service to never
stop — ever — in the process of moving from creation to consumption? In
a product manufacturing environment, this would require that products be
processed one at a time, with no excess inventory, no defects or rework, and
no equipment breakdowns. The only hope of coming anywhere close to this
ideal is to apply standard methods for production with minimal variation. All
30
Part I: Lean Basics 

the equipment must be readily available in the same area, instead of being
organized by functionality in separate departments. Manufacturing processes
must be synchronized precisely to the customer’s rate of consumption. In
Lean, this pace of value-stream production is known as the takt time (a calcu-
lated rate that marries the value of the customer demand with available work
hours).
Flow is not the natural way humans think. We tend to organize things in
batches — not flow. And it’s the way most people have been trained. Take
a simple activity like bulk mailing, for example. What type of process would
you use? Figure 2-1 shows a flow chart for a batch process. Now look at
Figure 2-2, which shows that same process in as a single-piece flow. In single-
piece flow, the documents are handled less, use less space, and are finished
and able to be sent more quickly. Yet most people think it’s faster to process
in batch.

Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Flow is one of those counterintuitive principles of Lean. You actually take less
time, use fewer resources, and tie up less money in inventory producing your
products when you operate from a flow perspective.
Lean requires you to think differently. Throw out any preconceived notions
about job boundaries, departmental organizations, or any other blocks that
could prevent the implementation of Lean.
For flow to work, you must to eliminate defects, equipment breakdowns,
backflows, and outages of any type. These are the impediments to flow, and
they exist whether you’re running a manufacturing, service, medical, or sup-
port operation. The key to your success is identifying these barriers in the
context of your world.
When you look at things from the perspective of the value stream, you don’t
organize things functionally. Instead of grouping things by similar functional
activities, you group them as families of value creation. In a manufacturing
world, you look at common operations that parts would pass through, and
organize modules of common equipment to produce a given family. In a lab
environment, you may form testing modules according to common batteries
of test types. How might you reorganize your environment?
Pulling through the system
Products and services can be pulled through a system as a result of action by
the customer, or they can be pushed through by virtue of an upstream
process. In a Lean enterprise, you use a pull system.
The classic candy-factory scene from I Love Lucy is a perfect example of an
unbalanced push system. At first, the chocolates arrive at the workstation at
a slow enough rate that Lucy can place them in the packages. But then the
belt speeds up, going faster and faster. The inventory has no place to go.
Lucy, a worker who wants to do her best, tries to stay on top of it. But when it
gets to be too much, she begins stuffing the candy down her shirt, in her
mouth, wherever she can, all in an effort to not let them pass her station.
Why the belt sped up, the audience never knows. Did the demand from the

customer increase? Or was it the whim of the scheduling department? Was it
a test for the workers? Who knows? What we do know is that this was not a
Lean process!
Lean utilizes level scheduling practices to keep the system operating at a steady
and achievable pace. Scheduling occurs with the process closest to the cus-
tomer. As the customer consumes a product or service, the rest of the system
is triggered to replenish what the customer has used.
One of the most common examples of a pull system is the local supermarket
(in fact, the supermarket was the source of inspiration for the pull system). A
shelf space is labeled with a tag that contains information for a given prod-
uct. A specified amount of the product will fit into the allocated space. When
the product level runs low, the empty space acts as a signal for the stockper-
son to replenish the product. The tag contains the information about the
product that belongs in the space.
This same idea governs Lean manufacturing. Instead of building up an excess
of what’s called Work-In-Process (WIP) inventory, the customer’s demand for
the product or service pulls finished goods through the system. The key notion
is that work is performed only after the part is required downstream — after
the space is created. Think of it as “take one, make one.” A pull signal or
kanban is used to trigger replenishment. Kanbans can come in various forms —
a card, container, or empty space. Regardless of the form, the kanban signal
contains the product information and quantities required for the replenish-
ment of inventory. Figure 2-3 shows an example of a kanban system.

Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Lean thrives on simplicity, because complex systems tend to be expensive,
unwieldy, and error-prone. Manual solutions are often preferred over automa-
tion, because they’re simpler. The goal is to identify the level of technology
and complexity that is appropriate for the need — that which will only add
value to the information flow or the value stream. Lean companies have
“unplugged” parts of their large MRP systems in favor of manual pull signals.
This causes the need for what’s known as back flushing in order to relieve
inventories. More recent technological advancements better support Lean
practices. For example, kanban cards are now printed at supplier locations
as inventory is relieved through point-of-sale systems.
A general rule for equipment availability in a pull system is that the equip-
ment should be available for production 90 percent of the time and down for
changeovers and maintenance 10 percent of the time.
When successfully implemented in conjunction with flow and perfection, pull
systems result in higher inventory turns, reduced floor space, faster cus-
tomer response, and improved cash flow.
Traditional sales and marketing practices need to be in step with the steady-
state flow of the Lean enterprise. Sales incentives and seasonal campaigns,
like inventory clearance sales or President’s Day sales, drive up demand and
cause products to be sold at lower prices. This artificially bull-whips the
supply chain. The concepts of level selling and steady-state pricing support a
more effective enterprise.
Striving for perfection
Lean is a never-ending journey. Although this may sound onerous, especially
in a goal-driven society, the reality is that there is and always will be some-
thing to improve. As you uncover waste, you’ll discover wastes that you
didn’t know existed, because they were masked by bigger wastes. It’s like
draining ponds or swamps: You never really know what’s lurking beneath the
surface until you’re brave enough to look — and then you have to do some-
thing about it.
Constant incremental improvements are achieved through Kaizen. (We cover
Kaizen in depth in Chapter 6.) In its simplest form, Kaizen means that you
improve something every day. It is both a philosophy and a methodology.
Kaizen improvements are generally not intended to be radical, earth-shattering
improvements — instead, they’re regular incremental improvements that
eliminate waste, here, there, and everywhere, bit by bit.
Companies just beginning a Lean journey often use what are known as Kaizen
events. Kaizen events most often begin with workshops that offer a significant
opportunity for the organization. This opportunity could be a visual impact
34
Part I: Lean Basics 

through the use of what’s known as the 5S methodology (see Chapter 8), or it
could be a customer-related opportunity like a significant reduction in a spe-
cific quality defect. A Kaizen event could also take on an “it can’t be done”
challenge to break through a barrier, like a reduction in equipment
changeover time from hours to minutes.
When improvement is on a radical scale it is known as Kaikaku. When you
think Kaikaku, think “Throw out all the rules.” It may come in the form 
of multiple, simultaneous Kaizen events (also known as a Kaizen blitz).
Alternatively, the term Kaikaku may imply a complete change in technology
or process methodology.
Whether it’s through Kaizen or Kaikaku, the aim is the same: Strive for per-
fection through improvement. Eliminate waste in all that you do. Create a sus-
tainable, thriving business for the long haul. Continually seek ways to better
serve the customer.
Learning from TPS
Because Lean evolved from the study of the Toyota Production System (TPS),
you might expect that the principles of Lean and TPS are similar. They are
similar, but they’re organized in a different way. Because of the close interre-
lationship, you need to understand a little about TPS.
Keep in mind that Lean and TPS are absolutely applicable across many indus-
tries, well beyond the automotive manufacturing environments that form
their heritage. (This is the subject of Chapters 14 and 15.)
Highly motivated people
More traditional organizations operate to a “shut up and do your job” mental-
ity. This is not the case in the TPS environment. People are expected to engage
fully, not only in their daily job functions, but also in the daily improvement
activities. People are strongly encouraged to use their creativity, and provide
important and useful suggestions to eliminate problems and improve the
value stream. It is through the people — workers and managers alike — that
improvement happens. The people use the tools, the people devise solutions,
and the people implement improvements — it’s all about the people!
People work in their individual job assignments and as part of broader teams.
The teams may be natural workgroups or may be formed for special projects.
As part of natural workgroups, team members are routinely cross-trained in
order to expertly perform multiple job tasks across the team’s span of respon-
sibility. Whether acting as individuals or as part of a team, people are expected
to regularly and routinely eliminate waste as part of their normal work.

Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

The approach of man-and-machine interfaces is philosophically different in
the TPS than in traditional western-style environments. In TPS, machines are
always subordinated to man. This means that processes are designed so that
man doesn’t wait on machines — machines wait on man. Western approaches
might value the resource costs of people versus equipment and conclude that
the equipment might be more valuable than the person, but this is never so in
TPS. People are always most important.
Operational stability
The foundation of the TPS is operational stability. Operational stability means
that variation within all aspects of the operations is under control. In order to
have unobstructed flow, orders must be timely and accurate, schedules must
be stable and leveled, equipment must run as planned, qualified staff must be
in place, and standardized work must be documented and implemented.
Does this mean that you can’t do Lean without these things? No, but it does
mean that your level of success will be reduced. One of the common mistakes
that companies adopting TPS make is to not understand how TPS is a com-
plete system, and how important holistic practices are to overall success.
They think that implementing kanban is the answer — but without level and
stable schedules, kanban doesn’t work very well. The other common mistake
is not paying enough attention to the people side of implementation.
Visual management
Visual management enables people to see exactly what’s going on and
respond to issues very rapidly. One method of visual management is known
as andon (a signal to alert people of problems at a specific place in a
process). The organization responds according to the signal shown; the
response follows the documented standardized work practice.
Other aspects of visual management include cross-training boards, produc-
tion tracking, customer information stations, communication displays, and
tool boards. (We cover the tools of Lean in depth in Part III.)
Just-in-time
Just-in-time (JIT) is probably the most well known pillar of the TPS house. JIT
means making only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount
needed — no more, no less.
In order for JIT to function, several techniques and practices uphold and
strengthen the system. These practices include
 Producing to takt: Takt connects the rate of production to customer
demand.
 Quick changeover: Quick changeover provides the flexibility to produce
a broader range of products over a short timeframe, such as a single day
or a single shift.
36
Part I: Lean Basics 

 Continuous flow: Continuous flow creates a steady stream of products
or services to the customer.
 Pull: Pull triggers the replenishment activities within the system. Pull
systems and continuous flow in TPS map directly to the concepts of
pull and flow in the Lean framework.
 Integrated logistics: Integrated logistics is the process of not only view-
ing all aspects of the supply chain as a system, but also managing them
as a whole. Pull signals are used throughout the entire chain to trigger
replenishment. Delivery schedules, milk runs (a method of consolidating
material shipments that includes the routing of trucks to collect materi-
als from various suppliers based on kanban signals, fixed routes, and
fixed times) for material, and container strategies are all coordinated to
provide the most effective solution for the JIT system.
Jidoka
Jidoka means that quality must be built in at the source. Quality cannot be
“inspected in” — after the work has left its station, it’s too late. When practic-
ing jidoka, defects never pass to the next step in the process.
The broader definition of jidoka includes root cause analysis techniques like
the 5 Whys and problem-prevention techniques like poka-yoke, where
process mistakes are prevented physically. An example of poka-yoke can be
found at filling stations that sell both diesel and unleaded fuels. The size of
the nozzle for the diesel fuel is larger and will not fit into a vehicle that uses
unleaded gasoline. Visual management techniques like andon boards are also
part of a jidoka practice.
The philosophy of jidoka says the person producing work, within a given step,
has the responsibility for the quality of job they are performing. If a problem
exists, the person is responsible for resolving it. If the person can’t resolve the
issue, then he is responsible for stopping the process in order to get it fixed.
Foundational wisdom
Woven throughout Lean are a set of axioms. This wisdom is the foundational
essence of Lean. These axioms are invariant and inviolate, and they give rise
to all the methods, toolsets, and techniques. When you truly get this wisdom,
you get Lean.
It’s all about the customer
The underlying reason for being in any business endeavor is to serve a cus-
tomer. Your customers are your focus: Without the customers, your business
effectively doesn’t exist. Your customers define what they value and what
they don’t. The customers set the expectations, and they respond to your
offerings with their wallets and their feet.
37
Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Everything you do in a Lean organization is ultimately focused on serving the
customer in the best possible way. The organizations that comprise the value
stream must understand what the customers want, translate that into a prod-
uct or service that the customers will buy, and provide it at a price they are
willing to pay. Tools like Kano modeling and QFD help organizations better
understand customer wants and needs and translate them into the language
of the value stream. (Chapter 3 explores the customer-consumer value relation-
ships and related tools.)
Eliminate waste — in everything you do
Sounds simple, doesn’t it? It’s like taking out the garbage. The tricky thing
about this piece of wisdom is that waste is everywhere and it’s never-ending.
It is like the “Whack-a-Mole” carnival game, just when you think you’ve got
’em all, a gopher pops up someplace else.
Your ability to effectively provide value to your customer is directly related
to your ability to eliminate waste and keep it away, permanently. But if waste
is never-ending, how can you eliminate it permanently? This may sound con-
tradictory, but it’s not. Lean divides the broad category of waste into seven
categories and three classifications (we cover these in the “Getting into
Shape” section, later in this chapter). Within each category are millions of
things that cause every form of waste. And, though the sources of waste are
never-ending, you can get closer to an ideal world by permanently resolving
waste one cause at a time.
Respect for people
Inherent in Lean is a respect for people that does not exist in more traditional
systems. Lean organizations are learning organizations. They reward improve-
ments to the system. They support their members through safe work environ-
ments, effective communication, extensive training, and, in some cases,
employment guarantees. Employee cross-training develops the employees,
while at the same time adding depth to the organization. Having teams of
people who are knowledgeable about multiple aspects of the value stream
enables the organization to minimize variation due to absenteeism and
turnover.
In a Lean environment, employees are expected to use their brains for the
betterment of the customer, the value stream, and the organization as a
whole. They are expected to engage in the environment, learn from their
mistakes, and expand their knowledge base.
People are seen as having more value than machines. In traditional manufac-
turing environments, it isn’t uncommon to see a person standing at a machine,
watching while the machine cycles. Lean views this as a waste of the precious
38
Part I: Lean Basics 

resource — a human being. The Lean view is to implement appropriate tech-
nology, so that people can do more valuable work. This is part of the practice
of autonomation (automation with a human touch). It isn’t the belief that
people can be replaced with machines. Rather it’s the practice to add intelli-
gence to machines to detect defects, prevent issues from being passed along
the value stream and automatically unload, so people don’t have to waste
their time and brain power watching a machine function.
Make it visual
Transparency eliminates waste. When you can quickly see what’s going on,
you don’t waste time, energy, or effort trying to figure it out. If there is a place
for everything, you can quickly see when everything is not in its place. The
old adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” cannot be truer in Lean.
Through a picture, a graph, a trouble light, or other visual techniques, you
can quickly and easily understand information in order to act on it. (We cover
more about visual management in Part III.)
Another aspect of visual management (or management by eye, as it’s also
called) is the ability to see and respond to trends in data. The New York City
Police Department uses maps with pushpins to identify where crimes are
being committed. They have maps for robbery, murder, and other types of
crime. By tracking where the problems happen, they can assign the right
amount of officers to the right area. They can focus resources on solving all
sorts of crimes — and since the 1990s, the city’s crime statistics have
reflected the results of their efforts.
After an article about the murder maps appeared in the New York Times, one
automotive supplier applied this concept to product quality in its facility. It
had a layout posted on the wall near a communication station. Every time a
customer complaint or return was received, they placed a pin on the worksta-
tion that produced the defect. If one area or station proved to be the source
of many complaints, then the company was able to focus its resources to
investigate and resolve the problem, whether it stemmed from equipment
failure, operator training, product design, or the need for poka-yoke (the
practice of mistake-proofing). They found that the quality performance
improved for two reasons:
 The maps brought awareness to the broader organization.
 The concentrated efforts to specific areas eliminated the causes of the
problems.
Annually, countless thousands of trees give their lives to become large
reports that few people read — but not in Lean. Thick reports are instantly
seen as waste. On a single page (also called A3 reporting, in a reference to the
39
Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

international paper size), a description of the issue, actions, data, and resolu-
tion are documented. The purpose of reporting is to provide information for
people to actually use. In one A3 format, the truly critical and necessary
information is presented, so the reader can invest more time into action,
rather than digestion of data.
Long-term journey
Lean does, in fact, produce instant results; you see immediate improvement.
But to sustain that improvement, you must be in the game for the long haul.
Lean is not a fad diet for your business. Instead, it is a lifestyle change that
requires vigilance. If Lean were a race, it would be more like the tortoise, not
the hare. Steady incremental improvements win over the long term. This is
not to say that you don’t experience a burst of speed along some stretches;
this will happen when you conduct multiple improvement workshops simul-
taneously (known as the Kaizen blitz). Anyone with some data, analysis tools,
and control charts can always improve something in the short term; the key
to Lean is the sustainability and incorporation of the changes into the normal
daily business routine for the long term.
Simple is better: The KISS principle
Life has become so complex that you practically need an advanced degree to
change the oil in your vehicle or program the TV remote. Does all this com-
plexity actually add value? When everything is working well, it seems to —
but when it isn’t, well, that’s a different story. Because everything is so com-
plex, it doesn’t always work so well.
The easier something is, the easier it is to learn and the easier it is to deal
with when problems occur — whether that something is a product, a service,
or the process that creates it. Simplicity is one of the beauties of Lean. It
doesn’t mean that you don’t solve complex issues, but it does mean that you
strive to find simple solutions to them. Lean improvements don’t have to cost
a lot of money. If you can error-proof something equally well with a block of
wood and duct tape versus a computer-controlled apparatus, Lean would tell
you to go with the wood and duct-tape solution. The solution is quicker,
faster and cheaper, both in the short term and the long term.
Keep it moving
Takt time sets the pace for movement. Working to takt time, everyone keeps
the system moving at just the right speed to deliver the right amount at the
right time to the customer. This notion of smooth, continuous flow is one of
Lean’s central axioms.
40
Part I: Lean Basics 

The customers want a finished product or service. They don’t want a bunch
of in-process, partially finished anythings. They don’t care about what’s in
process! The ideal state of the value stream in Lean is single-piece flow, with
no stoppages, in every process. Multitasking, inventory stoppages, broken
equipment, and batching are all inhibitors to flow.
Quality at the source
You can’t inspect quality into a product — ever. Many companies use inspec-
tors to try to catch defects before they’re released to the market, but the act
of inspection doesn’t change the quality of the product. Also popular is the
process of containment, which is the excuse to inspect after the fact, while
you keep producing suspect product. In Lean, you create a quality product at
each step of the value stream. If defects occur, they don’t leave the current
process step, either because the person doing the job caught the error, the
operation was error-proofed or there was autonomation that detected the
issue. Key characteristics of a product may be checked by the next operator
in the process. If they find an issue, they send the product back to the previ-
ous operation. The person who performed the transformational step owns
the responsibility for the quality of his work. Now everyone is an “inspector,”
and quality at the source becomes more realistic.
If you’ve ever filled out an online form with required fields, you’ve experienced
a form of quality at the source. If information is missing, the system will not let
you proceed. Some forms are even intelligent enough to recognize incorrect
data, like credit-card numbers and expiration dates. These forms contain poka-
yoke or error-proofing “devices” (in this case, the device is computer language)
to prevent errors from passing to the next step in the process.
Not all inspection is necessarily bad, but all inspection is, by definition, non-
value added. Inspection does nothing to transform the product or service.
Inspection is deemed necessary when the risk of the product or service
advancing beyond that stage of the value stream will put the customer at risk
or have a great financial impact; it could be a point of no return for repairs,
for example. When separate inspection stations are required, they follow a
standardized work process.
At the New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) factory in California —
a joint venture between Toyota and General Motors — inspection stations are
built into the line. The inspector is highly trained and has a set work flow and
order to inspect the specific items — even the position on the floor is marked
where the inspector should be standing to see parts of the vehicle. This
inspection routine is built into the flow or takt of the line.

Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Measurement systems reinforcing Lean behaviors
People respond to how they’re measured. If the measurement system sup-
ports a change in behavior, the change happens. One of the main challenges
in Lean implementations is that the existing measurement systems do not
support Lean practices.
One common example of a measurement system that does not support Lean is
a traditional cost accounting system. Traditional accounting for equipment,
inventory, and direct labor actually encourages waste. Under such systems,
equipment absorbs overhead, so supervisors run equipment to make their
numbers look better, whether they need to produce or not. This leads to the
waste of overproduction, which we discuss in the “Muda, muda, muda” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Additionally, the impact of direct labor in a cost-accounting environment is
actually overemphasized. When cost-accounting systems were originally estab-
lished, labor made up the majority of actual costs; now direct labor can be as
little as 20 percent of the cost. Companies have purchased automated equip-
ment to eliminate direct labor, only to find that they have the same number of
bodies supporting the equipment as they used to have performing the work!
The difference is that those bodies are now indirect labor, usually more skilled
and, therefore, working at a higher pay rate. However, the accounting system
still sees this as a benefit because of the measurement system.
In addition to changing business practices, successful Lean organizations
know that they need the right measurement systems to reinforce Lean behav-
iors. One tool that these organizations use is a Balanced Scorecard (see
Chapter 10). The Balanced Scorecard tracks aspects of the business beyond
the traditional financial measures. Areas like safety, people, quality, delivery,
and cost are measured to show the overall health of the business and identify
where the opportunities for improvement exist.
No perfect organization exists. Even Toyota, the pinnacle of Lean success,
has had its issues from time to time. Although Toyoda and Ohno are gone,
they left behind for all of us a legacy of reflection, learning, and unrelenting
quest for improvement. The new leaders have the charge to continue that
legacy by learning from issues and addressing inconsistencies and challenges
with the TPS foundations.
Learning lasts a lifetime
Learning happens thousands of times a day in a Lean organization. Learn-
ing and improving through observations, experiments, and mistakes are
42
Part I: Lean Basics 

fundamental to Kaizen. In Lean, after a lesson is learned, the knowledge
is institutionalized via updated work standards. And then the cycle repeats:
Observe, improve, institutionalize. Individuals learn; teams learn; collectively,
the knowledge of the organization increases. Every instant of every day is the
right time to learn and grow.
Getting into Shape
As an individual, if you’ve ever tried to get in shape, you know that you have
to change the way you diet, exercise, hydrate, and rest in order to have long-
term success. In your diet, you have to take out the empty calories and highly
processed food that do not add nutritional value. When you start paying
attention to what you put in your mouth, you realize how much garbage has
been unconsciously passing your lips.
When you start on a Lean journey, one of the key ways to improve the health
of the value stream is to eliminate waste. Like the empty calories of junk food,
you’ll find that a lot of non-value-added activities have crept into your value
stream. Waste in Lean is described by the three Ms of muda (waste), mura
(unevenness), and muri (overburden). Muda is divided into seven forms of
waste, which we cover in the following section.
Muda, muda, muda
Waste is all around you, every day and everywhere. You waste your time
waiting in line, waiting in traffic, or waiting because of poor service. In your
home, you may have experienced walking into a room looking for something
that wasn’t where it was supposed to be — wasted time and effort. In your
kitchen, you may have had to throw out science experiments from your
refrigerator — again, waste.
By now, you may be wondering what exactly is and isn’t waste. Taiichi Ohno
identified seven forms of waste. These seven forms are: transport, waiting,
overproduction, defects, inventory, motion, and excess processing. In his
book, The Power of Process: Unleashing the Source of Competitive Advantage,
Dr. Kiran Garimella of webMethods created an easy mnemonic for remember-
ing the seven forms: TWO DIME. Table 2-1 provides a summary of the seven
forms of waste, according to the TWO DIME mnemonic as well as their more
traditional names.
43
Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Table 2-1
The Seven Forms of Waste
Form of Waste
Also Known As
Explanation
Transport
Conveyance
Movement of product or materials
between transformational operations is
waste. The more you move, the more
opportunity you have for damage or
injury. Poor layouts and disorganization
are also common causes of transport
wastes. Conveyors in a Lean environment
are not used unless there is a safety
reason; even then, they’re non-value-
added. They take up floor space, cause
inventory accumulation, disconnect oper-
ators from other parts of the value
stream, and interrupt process flow.
Waiting
Waiting or delay
Waiting in all forms is waste. In a produc-
tion environment, any time an operator’s
hands are idle is a waste of that
resource, whether the operator is idle
due to shortages, unbalanced work
loads, need for instructions, or by design
(when operators watch machines cycle).
Overproduction
Overproduction
Producing more than the customer
requires is waste. It causes other wastes
like inventory costs, manpower and con-
veyance to deal with excess product,
consumption of raw materials, installa-
tion of excess capacity, and so on.
Defect
Correction, repair,
Any process, product, or service that fails
rejects
to meet specifications is waste. Any pro-
cessing that does not transform the prod-
uct is considered non-value-added. It
does not meet the criteria of done right
the first time.
Inventory
Inventory
Inventory anywhere in the value stream is
non-value-added. Inventory may be
needed, but it is still non-value-added. It
ties up financial resources. It is at risk to
damage, obsolescence, spoilage, and
quality issues. It takes up floor space and
other resources to manage and track it. In
addition, large inventories can cover up
other sins in the process like imbalances,
equipment issues, or poor work practices.
44
Part I: Lean Basics 

Form of Waste
Also Known As
Explanation
Motion
Motion or 
Any movement of people’s bodies that 
movement
does not add value to the process is
waste. This includes walking, bending,
lifting, twisting, and reaching. It also
includes any adjustments or alignments
made before the product can be 
transformed.
Extra processing
Processing or 
Any processing that does not add value 
overprocessing
to the product or is the result of inade-
quate technology, sensitive materials, or
quality prevention is waste. Examples
include in-process protective packaging,
alignment processing like basting in gar-
ment manufacturing or the removal of
sprues in castings and molded parts. 
Beyond the seven forms of waste, muda is further divided into two
classifications:
 Type-1 muda include actions that are non-value-added, but are for
some other reason deemed necessary for the company. These forms
of waste usually cannot be eliminated immediately.
 Type-2 muda are those activities that are non-value-added and are
also not necessary for the company. These are the first targets for
elimination.
All in the family
Beyond the general forms of muda are two other cousins of the waste family:
mura and muri. As with the forms of muda, the goal is to eliminate this type of
waste, too.
Mura (Unevenness)
Mura is variation in an operation — when activities don’t go smoothly or con-
sistently. This is waste caused by variation in quality, cost, or delivery. Mura
consists of all the resources that are wasted when quality cannot be pre-
dicted. This is the cost of testing, inspection, containment, rework, returns,
overtime, and unscheduled travel to the customer.
45
Chapter 2: The Foundation and Language of Lean

Muri (Overdoing)
Muri is the unnecessary or unreasonable overburdening of people, equip-
ment, or systems by demands that exceed capacity. Muri is the Japanese
word for unreasonable, impossible, or overdoing. From a Lean perspective,
muri applies to how work and tasks are designed. One of the core tenets of
Lean is respect for people. If a company is asking its people to repeatedly do
movements that are harmful, wasteful, or unnecessary, then the company is
not respecting the people and, therefore, is not respecting the foundation of
Lean. You perform ergonomic evaluations of operations to identify move-
ments that are either harmful or unnecessary.
46
Part I: Lean Basics 
Lean lingo
Because the foundations of Lean originated
from the Toyota Production System, the lan-
guage of Lean contains quite a few Japanese
words. These words have come to represent
Lean systems and concepts. In addition, Lean
has unique English terms. The glossary at the
end of this book contains a thorough list of
terms that are critical to your understanding of
Lean. Think of these terms in Lean as you would
please, thank you, and hello when learning a
foreign language. Pretty soon, you’ll be speak-
ing Lean like a native.
Also, you may hear the word efficient used in
conjunction with the improvements in an organi-
zation’s operations. However, the aim of a Lean
organization is to provide value in the most effec-
tive way possible. The word effective is used
rather than efficient, to avoid the traditional def-
initions of efficiency associated with batch and
queue and other forms of mass production, such
as labor efficiency. When you’re operating effec-
tively, you’re providing the right thing, at the right
time, through an engaged and motivated work-
force producing the highest quality level, short-
est lead times, and lowest cost.

Understanding
Flow and the 
Value Stream

In this part . . .
N
ow that you know the basics, it’s time to get started.
At the heart of Lean is a focus on the customer and
a spirit of continuous improvement. In this part, you figure
out how the customer defines value. You discover how to
analyze your business today and create a vision of the
future. You also find out how to eliminate waste through
continuous improvement or Kaizen.

Chapter 3
Seeing Value through the Eyes
of the Customer
In This Chapter
 Understanding the concept of value
 Discerning customers and consumers
 Envisioning the value stream
You may think the concept of value is pretty standard, but the reality is
that each person has his own perception of what constitutes value.
What people value and how they value it changes with circumstance and
time. As mutable as the criteria for defining value may be, in Lean you have
to understand what your customers and consumers value, and then provide
that value in the most effective way. When you define what your customers
value, you also define the very nature of your activities and actions: what
you should be doing, how you should be doing it, and even if you should be
doing it.
The definition of value is important, because it forms the foundation upon
which Lean processes are built, and it guides you in assembling activities in a
continuous stream of value creation. In this chapter, we provide the basic def-
inition of value, and show you the Lean standard definition of value. You dis-
cover how value can be perceived by the immediate customer as well as the
end consumer. Finally, you get acquainted with the concept of flow and the
value stream.
What Is Value?
Simply stated, value is the worth placed upon something. That something can
be goods, services, or both. The worth can be expressed in terms of money,
an exchange, a utility, a merit, or even a principle or standard.

Who determines the value? Customers do. Globally, there are about six bil-
lion of them, and numerous more in various combinations (businesses, social
groups, and other organizations).
Although the definition of value is straightforward, what is more difficult to
understand is how value is created, applied, measured, and translated. What
are the actions and activities that actually create value? How does a person
or organization come to value a particular product or service? What deter-
mines how much a person is willing to “pay” for it — with their time, money,
or other resources? And how is the value exchanged?
Value isn’t absolute — it doesn’t occur in isolation. Value is relative to such
factors as location, place, time, timing, form, fit, function, integration, interac-
tions, resources, markets, demand, and economies. But in all cases, value is
defined by the customer.
The process of value creation — developing the worth that someone is willing
to place upon something — is usually lengthy and complicated.
Consider the complexity involved in the process of creating value in some-
thing that many people regularly take for granted: autonomous, personal
mobility in the form of the automobile. In this case, value creation involves
not just the design and assembly of the thousands of parts in a car, but also
the highway system, the petroleum refining and distribution system, the
maintenance and repair industry, the insurance industry, and the knowledge
and conventions enforced in the millions of other drivers out there that you
have to interact with in order to move about with some degree of certainty.
Every driver antes up, in the form of sticker prices and insurance payments,
gasoline and maintenance fees, highway and other taxes, greenhouse gases
and environmental damage, and, of course, lots and lots of time. Autonomous,
personal mobility is an extremely high-value item, and each of the above
elements contributes a critical piece to that total value.
Now consider something seemingly much simpler: the pre-made salad you
buy at the grocery store. A few vegetables in a plastic carton — seems pretty
straightforward, right? But consider for a moment what goes into that salad:
all the different ingredients, sourced from places not just across the country
but around the world, picked and transported quickly, sliced and diced just
the right way, handled carefully so as not to bruise or damage, combined in
just the right amounts, in the right order, and placed carefully in a container
made of the proper materials that retain freshness, labeled properly for both
the grocer and the consumer, and then transported and positioned in a
cooler at just the right time so that it’s sitting there waiting for you, fresh and
wholesome, at a price you’re willing to pay, when you’re grabbing a quick
dinner on the way home from work. Whew! Not so simple. Now consider that
you’re the salad-maker, and you have to do that thousands of times a day for
different customers and tastes, at a competitive price. Every step in your
process must add real value for you and your customer, because there’s no
room for waste.
50
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

In any endeavor — large or small — the many activities, actions, and steps in
the process must lead to an end result that has value for the buyer. This
value must be easily perceived, readily quantified, and willingly exchanged
for the product or service offered. And the provider of the product or service
must not only deliver on the customer’s expectation, but also receive a fair
exchange of value for it.
To Add Value or Not to Add Value,
That Is the Question
Every activity in your organization either adds value or it doesn’t. In Lean,
you analyze each activity in every process for its contribution to value, as
defined by your customer. In the ideal state, every activity directly meets
your customer’s criteria for value — and if it doesn’t, you don’t do it.
Makes you think, doesn’t it? Everyone and everything in the process doing
only what creates customer value? Well, that’s what Lean is all about!
Think about this principle in the context of what you do for your customers —
whoever or whatever they may be. How much of all the time, people, resources,
capital, space, and energy being consumed around you and by you is directly
creating value for your customers? Now put on the other hat, and think about
it from the customers’ point of view. When you’re paying for the product or
service — with your valuable time, money, effort, or otherwise — how much
are you spending to get what you really want — and only what you really want?
In this section, we fill you in on the strict definition used in Lean for value-
added and non-value-added. You will understand non-value-added according
to the three Ms — muda, mura, and muri. Some activities in your process do
not add value according to the customer’s definition, but they are unfortu-
nately necessary for your processes to function. We will tell you what to do in
those cases, too.
Defining value-added
In Lean, value is always defined from the customer’s viewpoint. The customer
is the one — and only one — who defines the value of the output of a
process. In order for an activity to be considered value-added, three precise
criteria must be met:
 The customer must be willing to pay for the activity.
 The activity must transform the product or service in some way.
 The activity must be done correctly the first time.

This strict definition applies to everything. To add value in a process, all
actions, activities, processes, persons, organizations, systems, pieces of
equipment, and any other resources committed to the process must meet
these three criteria.
You can easily spot value-added activity:
 At the carwash, it’s when someone actually washes the car.
 At the hospital, it is when the patient receives treatment.
 On the assembly floor, it’s when someone is actually putting parts
together.
In each of these cases, it’s clearly what the customer is paying for; it’s trans-
forming the product; and as long as it’s being done correctly, it’s contributing
directly to customer value (that is, it’s value-added).
Defining non-value-added
In Lean, if an activity does not meet just one of the value added criteria (see
the preceding section) then it is deemed non-value-added. Either the customer
isn’t willing to pay for it, or the activity hasn’t transformed the product or ser-
vice in any measurable way, or the activity wasn’t done correctly the first
time. In other words, from the customer’s perspective it could be considered
wasted time or effort. In Lean, you strive to eliminate waste in everything
you do.
At the carwash, it’s the order-taker, the car-mover, the cashier, the queuing
time, the excess water, and the customer waiting lounge. At the hospital, it’s
the check-in time, the wait time, filling out forms, inconclusive tests, and hos-
pital food. On the assembly floor, it’s the parts bins, the travel time, the setup
time, the inspections and testing, the conveyors, the supervisors, the bad-
parts reject basket.
In each of these cases, the item or person wasn’t something the customer
wanted to pay for, or the activity didn’t directly transform the product or
service, or something wasn’t done correctly.
Wait a minute, you say! Some of those things are important, even necessary.
Customers have to pay for what they’re buying. Employees don’t know what
to do without a supervisor instructing them. Forms convey important infor-
mation. Customer lounges keep people happy — you can’t just make them
wait outside. And bad components have to be removed — after all, it’s a good
thing when you catch a failure and don’t ship a bad product to the customer,
right?
52
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Sorry to burst your bubble, but if the activity in question doesn’t meet all
three criteria, it’s just not adding customer value. The customer lounge is
nice, but it doesn’t transform the product. Filling out forms may get you
admitted to the hospital, but it doesn’t directly contribute to your treatment.
The reject basket means you caught the failures, but they’re a living example
of something that wasn’t done correctly the first time. None of this means
that you might not want or even need to do these things based on your exist-
ing process model, but it does mean that those activities are not adding value
for the customer.
In Lean, non-value-added activities are further described by the three Ms —
muda, mura, and muri:
 Muda (waste): Muda is an activity that consumes resources without cre-
ating value for the customer. (We define the seven standard forms of
waste in detail in Chapter 2.) There are two types of muda:
• Type-1 muda includes actions that are non-value-added, but that
are for some other reason deemed necessary for the organization.
• Type-2 muda are those activities that are non-value-added and
unnecessary for the company.
 Mura (unevenness): Mura is waste caused by variation in quality, cost,
or delivery. When activities don’t go smoothly or consistently, mura is
the result. Mura consists of all the resources that are wasted when qual-
ity cannot be predicted, such as the cost of testing, inspection, contain-
ment, rework, returns, overtime, and unscheduled travel to the
customer. You apply variation reduction techniques to eliminate mura.
 Muri (overdoing): Muri is the unnecessary or unreasonable overburden-
ing of people, equipment, or systems by demands that exceed capacity.
From a Lean perspective, muri applies to how work and tasks are
designed. Muri is caused by movements that are harmful, wasteful,
or unnecessary. You perform ergonomic evaluations and detailed job
analysis of operations to identify movements that are either harmful
or unnecessary.
Lean strives to eliminate all non-value-added activities.
When non-value-added seems 
like value-added
By their very nature, processes are full of waste that masquerades as value
creation. Many activities initially seem as though they’re necessary or value-
added, but upon closer examination, through the eyes of the customer — and
according to the three criteria listed in the “Defining value-added” section
earlier in this chapter — they’re not.
53
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

Muda, particularly type-1 muda (see the preceding section), is usually created
because of current facility or technology limitations, government regulations,
or unchallenged company business practices. Oftentimes, muda is so insidi-
ous that the organization is blind to it. Identifying muda is particularly diffi-
cult when muda is programmed into computer systems.
Seeking out and eliminating muda takes effort — it requires someone to chal-
lenge the status quo. Sometimes people don’t think they have the time or
energy to do that level of work. Sometimes they don’t feel like they have the
tools or authority to change the current state. Sometimes they don’t know
where to begin. And sometimes, they just don’t want to change. Yet the fact
of the matter is that, when you put in the effort to identify the muda, you will
find a gold mine of opportunity.
Common examples of type 1-muda include the following:
 Overhead activities, such as administration, accounting, and legal
 Bureaucracy, such as forms, reports, and approvals
 Product support, such as product testing, critical inspection, and trans-
portation
Type-1 muda includes all the things around or supporting the value-added
functions, but these things don’t actually do any direct transformation
themselves.
You may insist, “These activities are necessary for the business!” And you
may even be right — maybe they are necessary. But whether they’re neces-
sary or not, it doesn’t change the fact that they are non-value-added. Here are
some examples:
 The trimming of printed paper to a perfect size and edge contour in
the printing industry: That paper trimming surely seems like a value-
added activity. The trimming transforms the product by creating a
clean edge. The customer is willing to pay for the book, but how much
do they care if the pages are perfectly trimmed? In any case, if the
printing process had a better way to align the pages during binding,
no trimming would be necessary. No paper would be wasted and the
extra resources would not be required.
 The in-line inspection station in the automobile manufacturing indus-
try: You need to ensure operations are done correctly. You must protect
your customer. While this is may be true, you cannot transform a prod-
uct through inspection, you can only mitigate risk. The most well chore-
ographed inspection station, while seemingly necessary, is always
non-value-added.
54
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Staying late and pushing extra hard to get a job done and meet a
deadline: The job has to get done, and people will rise to the occasion,
right? Yes, but consider the cost. Not only do people tend to make more
mistakes when they drive too hard without a rest, but burned-out people
will leave the company and take critical knowledge and experience with
them. On occasion, working in this manner may seem necessary, but no
matter how you look at it, it’s a waste.
Understanding How the Customer
Defines Value
Who’s the customer? If you’re like most people, you’re thinking it’s the
person at the retail end of the line; the one who buys the product or service;
the one who walks into a store, gets out his wallet, pays for something, and
leaves with it. Actually, that person is a special form of customer known as
the consumer; we cover the consumer in the “Understanding How the
Consumer Defines Value” section, later in this chapter.
The customer, as far as Lean is concerned, is the person or entity who is the
recipient of the product or service you produce. For many, the customer is
another business. For other, the customer is someone inside their own busi-
ness. Sometimes the customer is a specific individual; other times, the cus-
tomer is a group or team. But in any case, the customer is the one who places
the value on your output.
Uncovering the elusive customer
The world has grown so complicated that sometimes it’s difficult to deter-
mine just who anybody’s customer really is. So many functions, supply
chains, outsourced providers, contract distributors, and channels are part of
the mix. But in the Lean world, this question — “Who is your customer?” — is
fundamental, because the customer is the one who matters. The customer is
the only one who truly defines the value in what you produce.
Your customer is likely not the consumer — the end user of the product or
service you provide. You’re probably part of a supply chain or network for
some set of designs, materials, products, or services that are combined in a
complex series of processes to provide that end-item solution to a consumer
somewhere. Your customer is therefore most likely an individual (or set of
individuals) within a group who pays for the products and services you 
generate.
55
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

In Figure 3-1, we show you a SIPOC diagram. The SIPOC is a standard tool in
process management that helps identify and characterize the key driving
influences on a process. A SIPOC diagram lists the suppliers and inputs to a
process on the one hand, and the outputs and customers on the other.
Considering the process itself as a black box for the moment, focus on what
outputs are produced and who receives them. This recipient is the elusive
customer you’re looking for.
Every process — no matter how large-scale and all-encompassing, or small
and focused — has a customer. Large-scale processes, such as order entry or
production, have a broad spectrum of many types of customers. In small
processes, such as RazRPhone Model V3 keypad assembly or the daily setup
of a jewelry department in retail, the customer is much more narrowly and
specifically defined. But in every case and at every level in any organization
or endeavor, processes have customers.
As you consider who is the recipient of such process outputs in your own
organization, consider these tips:
 When you’re looking at the improvement of a small portion of the
overall process, recognize its role in the larger process. Across an
organization, there are many subprocesses — and, therefore, there are
many customers — involved in the larger process of creating the total
product or facilitating a complete service.
 Your process may produce outputs for multiple customers. If so, differ-
ent customers will have different characteristics, and you’ll need to
regularly adjust the process according to the distribution of customer
requirements, attributes, and situations.
 Recognize how your process output serves the end consumer. If your
process does not directly supply the consumer, then your customer is a
middleman. Your direct customer may be adding, filtering, interpreting,
or changing how the consumer defines value. Your direct customer has
different motivations and needs from the consumer. Make sure that you
are meeting your direct customer’s needs, but don’t lose sight of the
consumer’s expectations and how they define value.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Don’t become distracted by stakeholders. A stakeholder is someone with
a vested interest in a company; stakeholders may include managers,
board members, stockholders, employees, suppliers, family members of
employees, retirees, government, or the community. Although these enti-
ties are important, in Lean they aren’t the customer. Stakeholders have an
interest in company performance or results. But in Lean, the principle
focus is the value-creation process and the elimination of waste in that
process. When a business is distracted by the stakeholders, it may lose
the focus on the process and take short-term actions that will actually
increase mura (variation — see “Defining non-value-added,” earlier in this
chapter).
Sometimes the customer causes type-1 muda (see “Defining non-value-
added,” earlier in this chapter). Type-1 muda can come in the form of cus-
tomer demands on you to accommodate their systems or processes. In the
case of pre-made food, one grocery chain at one location may require double
labels for a product to make their scanning easier, yet they are not be willing
to pay for the extra label. So by definition, it’s non-value-added, because the
customer would not willing to pay for the added materials and resources for
the label. In adding the label, the company producing the food will have to
eat the cost as a goodwill measure. This is a case of the customer creating
type-1 muda.
Considering customer value
The customer is the purchaser of your goods and services, and they are the
recipient of the outputs from your process. The customer has many options,
but the customer has chosen to buy these outputs from your process. Why?
What goes into a customer’s purchase decision? Why is the customer buying
these specific outputs from your particular process? How does the customer
determine what they’re going to pay?
The answers to all of these questions come down to value. The customer
chooses your option because it believes your option represents the best
overall value for them. The customer places a worth on the process outputs
and believes these outputs and this process best fulfill their requirements.
The customer’s requirements and decision criteria are many, and the cus-
tomer’s methods of assigning value may be formal or informal, but at the end
of the day, you are the supplier the customer has chosen.
Understanding customer satisfaction
The customer assigns value based on the degree to which the process out-
puts fulfill their requirements. The greater the fulfillment of requirements, the
higher the customer’s satisfaction, and therefore the greater the customer’s
attributed value.
57
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

All customer requirements are not created equal. Some requirements are
extremely important must-haves, other requirements are nice-to-haves, and
still other requirements fall somewhere in the middle. How the fulfillment of
these different requirements translates to customer satisfaction is not always
obvious. Don’t worry — in this section, we spell it all out.
In the 1980s, Japanese professor Noriaki Kano developed a visual way to
understand customer requirements (see Figure 3-2). This model is a graphical
plot of fulfillment versus satisfaction. What Kano recognized is that customer
requirements naturally come in three flavors:
 Needs: Needs are fundamental — they’re absolute requirements. You
must fulfill the needs of your customer. If your customer has unfulfilled
needs, that very quickly translates to complete dissatisfaction. However,
at best, fulfilling your customer’s needs results in neutral satisfaction. In
other words, meeting your customer’s needs is a thankless job, but fail-
ing to meet your customer’s needs is disastrous.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Wants: Wants are expectations. If you don’t fulfill your customer’s wants,
the customer will be dissatisfied; if you do fulfill your customer’s
wants, the customer will be satisfied. The relationship is linear: No
lack of fulfillment of wants will ever create the dissatisfaction that
unmet needs will, and likewise no degree of fulfillment of wants will
ever have the satisfaction potential of the third type of requirement —
the delighters.
 Delighters: Delighters are pure upside. No one really expects them, so
there’s no penalty if they’re missing. But the level of customer satisfac-
tion increases exponentially if the process fulfills these most whimsical
of requirements.
The extent to which a process fulfills each type of requirement affects the
level of customer satisfaction and perceived value.
One of the great applications of the Kano model is the wildly successful U.S.
air carrier Southwest Airlines. When Southwest designed its business model,
it fully understood the difference between these three types of requirements.
Southwest began by recognizing that there is really only one fundamental
customer need: Get me there safely. It realized that unfulfilled wants, like
food, music, and first-class accommodations, wouldn’t cost Southwest much
customer satisfaction, as long as it offset those unfulfilled wants with fulfilled
wants like the on-time consistency and cost savings from the single-aircraft
fleet. But then Southwest threw in the big delighter: super-friendly flight
attendants. By creating a near-party atmosphere, it exponentially increased
customer satisfaction. Voilà! A huge winner — so much so that Southwest is
now a new industry benchmark, imitated globally.
Take a moment to ponder the application of the Kano model to your business
or organization. Of the many requirements you chase and manage, which fall
into each of the three categories? How well do you fulfill them? How satisfied
are your customers?
Breaking down customer requirements
Fulfilling the customer’s wants, needs, and delighters is the path to customer
satisfaction (see the preceding section). Kano modeling and Quality Function
Deployment (QFD), covered in Chapter 7, are two tools that you can use to
capture and understand customer requirements.
To really understand your customer’s requirements, ask them! Talk to
your customer extensively. Involve your customer in your planning and
development.
59
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

After you identify your customer’s requirements, you can analyze how effec-
tively you’re satisfying those requirements. And only then can you optimize
value creation, ensuring the processes perform their transformations on the
product or service properly and correctly the first time.
To create a solution and fulfill your customer’s requirements, they are first
translated into product or service specifications. Typically, these specifications
are documented first at the highest level, known as the top level, the system
level, or the A level. Then, the specifications are successively expanded into
subsystems or subprocesses, each of which fulfills a specific role in achieving
the overall objective defined by the top level specification. Within each of
these levels, the specifications are categorized into the following types:
 Functionality: What are all the things that the product or service must
do? How must it do them? How uniquely? The specifications are usually
described through a set of action verbs, but they may also describe
aesthetics and other physical or operational attributes.
 Form and fit: What are the shapes and sizes, the constraints and the
tolerances of the way the product or service (or components thereof)
must be designed, must align, or must interact?
 Price: What is the price that the customer will pay for the product or
service? Is the price dynamic (will it or should it change over time)?
 Purchase: What are the various purchasing models and terms by which
the customer will buy? What should the purchasing experience be?
 Performance: How quickly, how often, or for how long must the product
or service perform its functions?
 Reliability: With what levels of reliability and dependability must the
product or service perform its functions? What is the pedigree and what
experience do you bring to ensure that reliability?
 Maintainability: What are the support and maintenance requirements?
Is the customer or consumer required or able to maintain it, or portions
of it, themselves? How will it be supported?
 Scalability: If the customer wants more, how readily should they be able
to have more? Do any of the other requirements elements change with
scalability?
 Safety: Are there safety aspects to the product or service — as related
to the suppliers, consumers, maintenance groups, or even the general
public?
 Security: Security concerns are a separate requirements element. Could
the product or service pose a security risk in any way, either directly or
indirectly?
60
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Perception: How are you perceived in the market? What is your brand
identity? What has been the customer’s past experience with your
organization? Have you had any bad press that may affect a purchasing
decision?
These categories of requirements apply during any phase of the product or
service life cycle; they apply to the core processes of design, development,
delivery, and service, as well as support processes, including sales, finance,
legal, marketing, human resources, information technology, and facilities.
Every process must attend to these elements to ensure the product or ser-
vice the process provides will fulfill the customer’s needs, wants, and desires.
These categories apply not just to the end consumer, but also to your imme-
diate customer and each successive customer in the chain. No matter where
your process sits in the big picture, these categories of requirements apply
to you!
From a Lean perspective, all processes can be improved and waste can be
eliminated. Businesses often focus their Lean efforts only on the manufactur-
ing or operational processes, sometimes losing sight of critically important
places where their customer interfaces with them the most. Customer rela-
tionships are formed in the support processes like sales, accounts payable,
and materials management. Oftentimes, companies neglect to eliminate waste
in these processes, and the processes are often plagued with type-1 muda.
When you’re focusing on your customers, understanding what is important
to them, and then eliminating the wastes that prevent you from delivering
what they want, how they want it, and when they want it, you put your com-
pany in a better position to compete.
Remember that what your customer values is not static. Customer interests
and satisfaction change over time. The Kano model has a downward migration:
Today’s wants become tomorrow’s needs. Having processes that connect you
with your customers will help you stay agile and change with their changing
demands.
Understanding How the Consumer
Defines Value
The ultimate customer is the consumer. The consumer is defined as “one who
obtains goods and services for his own use,” rather than for resale or use in
manufacturing. Consumers are the catalyst in the value chain; their buying
action triggers the flow of activities on the part of the many product and ser-
vice providers whose contributions ultimately fulfill the consumers’ require-
ments and values.
61
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

As such, the consumer holds a uniquely important customer position, and
it’s incumbent on you — regardless of your position in the value chain — to
be aware of consumer motivation and behavior. In most cases, you work
directly for your immediate customer, because they specify your require-
ments and receive your outputs. However, consumer actions will ripple
through the chain to affect you, so you must also understand how the con-
sumer defines value.
Recognize, too, that although the entire stream of activity is ultimately oriented
toward satisfying the consumer, the consumer’s requirements and values do
not necessarily align with the processes and agendas of all the many upstream
players providing those goods and services. Your direct customer will likely
represent the consumer’s needs to you differently than the consumer would,
so you must be in a position to understand and balance your direct customer’s
requirements with those of the end consumer.
Because Lean processes are customer focused, they respond to the require-
ments of the customer and refine their processes accordingly. Although each
successive process may have a unique set of customer requirements, the
starting point is with the consumer, because the consumer is the first point
of requirements definition. The consumer is the first to assign value and first
to vote with their wallet. The consumer kicks off the whole process.
Many organizations or businesses are agenda-centric, believing that they can
foist their agenda on their consumer market. These organizations are not cus-
tomer focused and do not practice the Lean art of customer-driven process
definition. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for such com-
panies to thrive. Customer-centric businesses fare far better.
Responding to the consumer
The Lean world begins with the consumer — the first customer to levy
output requirements on a process. The consumer is where needs begin. All
processes that support the consumer directly or indirectly are called into
action. Theoretically, it is with the consumer’s contemplation to buy that 
the entire value chain springs into action.
Organizations and businesses of all types strive to understand and anticipate
the consumer. The better a business can predict consumer behavior, the
more effectively it can fulfill the consumer’s needs, wants, and delighters (see
“Understanding customer satisfaction,” earlier in this chapter). In some
cases, you need to understand broad consumer behavior and then produce
products in volume for the general consumer market. In other cases, you
have to maintain the capacity to produce a product or deliver a service on
demand. In most cases, it’s a mix.
62
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Most companies aren’t fluid or flexible enough to wait for a customer-
demand event to act across their entire supply chain, but many such demand
build-to-order models exist at the direct consumer end of the market. Can
you imagine a world where all companies operated that way? Can you think
of a few who currently do? Here are a few:
 Many computer manufacturers no longer build systems and wait for cus-
tomers to buy them. Their computers are built to the configurations and
specifications ordered by the consumer — and shipped within days.
 Most fast-food restaurants now build your meal to order. They have the
basic ingredients on hand (based on past consumer behavior), and
when you order, they prepare your meal to your specifications and
deliver it to you in a matter of minutes.
 Eyeglasses used to take days or weeks to arrive, but now some compa-
nies have moved the lab into the retail location. Your glasses are now
ready in an hour.
 Business consultants wait for the call and then configure their consult-
ing solutions based on the requirements. Consultants are extremely
adept at forging new solutions in near real-time, based on the applica-
tion of their latest knowledge, and quickly preparing a new solution for
the client.
In these types of applications, the value stream is closely connected to the
needs of the consumer. For example, the disk-drive manufacturer who sup-
plies hard drives to the computer assembler follows the consumer demand
market very closely. The food suppliers to restaurants know what the diner is
ordering. (Remember how quickly menus changed when the low-carb diets
were in vogue?)
Consumers further influence the market through a unique spin they have on
requirements. In addition to the Kano profiles and formalized requirements
flow, consumers exhibit specific behaviors and styles. These styles set the
stage for how the entire value stream — and all the intermediate processes
and customers — will act. Consumers largely fall into one of eight behavior
style types, as defined by Sproles and Kendall’s Consumer Style Inventory:
 Perfectionism; high-quality conscious
 Brand conscious
 Novelty-fashion conscious
 Recreational, hedonistic shopping conscious
 Price and “value-for-the-money” shopping conscious
 Impulsiveness
 Confusion over choice of brands, stores, and consumer information
 Habitual, brand-loyal orientation toward consumption
63
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

Consider an eyewear shop that makes the promise to deliver your glasses in
an hour. What must that store do to live up to its promise? It must have all
the materials, processes, and services on site to fulfill your needs. This
includes having a sufficient variety of styles on hand to appeal to the variety
of consumer interests — they need the designer section, the hip-and-trendy
section, and the value section. They must also maintain the right level of
inventory of frames and the lens blanks to go with them. Their equipment
must be locally maintained. They must have trained technicians on site. And
they must be conveniently located for consumer access (in shopping malls).
All these elements come together to provide the consumer with glasses in
an hour.
Not all consumers purchase the same way. Technology is changing the
options for purchasing, but not everyone will adapt to the changes at the
same rate.
Online purchasing has changed consumer behavior. Consumers see value in
going online, both to check out and to check you out. They relish having the
tools at their fingertips to research and make more educated purchases.
More than ever, they know what they want, they’re empowered by knowing
how to get it, and they’ll search until they find it. The convenience factor has
become dominant, causing companies to become increasingly innovative in
how they reach their existing markets, as well as penetrate new ones. Some
consumers will do the research online, but still want to talk to a human or
buy from a store — they’re security minded and want to know that they can
trust the person they’re buying from. Other consumers are content to do
everything online — from researching to buying.
Traditionally, Lean applications have neglected to focus sufficiently on many
of the processes that the consumer touches directly. These processes
include customer service, technical support, warranty, and more. Business
reach can be improved dramatically by improving the processes that support
these services. When a consumer is delighted by a product or experience,
that consumer will be your biggest advocate. Conversely, when a customer is
dissatisfied, he can be your biggest detractor!
Understanding what consumers value
Consumers are customers with a twist. In addition to the behaviors that busi-
ness customers exhibit across the value chain (the so-called business-to-
business, or B2B, group), the consumers have unique requirements and
demands. The business-to-consumer relationship (B2C) must interpret 
these demands and properly manage them — directly or indirectly — 
back upstream to all the suppliers.
64
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Understanding the distribution of styles in your market is a key step to
understanding what your consumers value. Depending on the industry, the
type of product or service, the magnitude of the purchase, and other factors,
the relationship with the consumers through the pre- and post-buying phases
ultimately determines the degree of success.
In simple terms, consumers want what they want, when they want it, at the
price they’re willing to pay for it, and if something goes wrong, they want
accurate and friendly assistance or the ability to return it easily. These
demands place tremendous pressure and constraints on each provider
of the goods and services that combine to provide that end item to the
consumer.
Companies are just now beginning to include the interface between the com-
pany and consumer as part of their Lean efforts. Processes from the point the
consumer purchases through customer service and technical support are new
frontiers for Lean implementation. These processes can make or break your
relationship with consumers (not to mention their friends and families!), and
are a new spring of improvement possibilities. Eliminating waste and creating
a positive, value-added customer experience will increase your competitive
edge.
The consumer is the ultimate customer. What the consumer values is ulti-
mately what counts. Although you may have intermediary customers who
have their own set of values, it is important to not lose sight of the consumer’s
wants and needs.
Introducing the Value Stream
After you understand value as it relates to your customers and consumers,
you’re ready to look closely at your processes to see how effectively you’re
satisfying their requirements (value creation). In Lean, you provide goods
and services to the market through what is called the value stream.
If you’ve ever stood alongside a stream and watched the water flow, you
probably noticed how the water runs and how the current changes. When
there are no obstructions, and the volume is just right, the water moves
freely and easily. But most streams have disturbances. Sticks, rocks, and
fallen trees dam and disturb the flow. If there has been a storm, all sorts
of debris drifts downstream. Where there are rocks, white water appears.
Too much or too little water for the size of the riverbed, and there’s more
whitewater.
65
Chapter 3: Seeing Value through the Eyes of the Customer

If you liken the stream to an operational process, the ideal condition is when
the process flows unobstructed, like smooth, even water. The sticks and stones
in a process are things like inventories, quality defects, and other forms of
muda — non-value-added activities that block the flow of the product to the
customer. In Lean, you strive to remove the debris and smooth out the flow.
Visualizing the value stream
The term value stream is used in Lean to describe how all the activities line
up and work together to produce a given product or service. The activities
combine to form a process of value creation. The process flow consists of
activities that are both value-added and non-value-added.
The stream is always viewed from the customer’s perspective, ideally from
the ultimate customer’s (the consumer) perspective. In viewing the value
stream, you start where the stream ends with the consumer’s view, and you
track it all the way upstream to the smallest tributary — the sources of raw
materials and labor, as depicted in Figure 3-3.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

For any product or service, many activities and different types of materials and
people contribute to make it happen. The materials are brought together —
sometimes from all over the world — to make many products. Likewise, many
services are provided globally. As consumers, we experience the end product
or the last mile, because we’re at the mouth of the stream, but a lot is happen-
ing upriver.
Think for a moment about all the things that have to happen for UPS or FedEx
to deliver a parcel overnight. Consider all the events that must be coordi-
nated perfectly and have to occur at precisely the right time in the value
stream to deliver that parcel to the right address and in perfect condition.
Sorting and handling, trucks, airplanes, tracking information — a staggering
degree of logistical sophistication.
Now, visualize the value stream that is required to deliver a new automobile
to the showroom. Literally tens of thousands of parts must arrive on the man-
ufacturing line, in the right color, in the right order, at the right quality level,
with the right orientation, for assembly to the right vehicle.
Consider again that ready-made salad at the grocery store. What does the
value stream look like to make it available to you in a variety you desire, at
a price you are willing to pay and a freshness level that you would expect?
Figure 3-4 shows a high-level view of all of the activities that must occur in
the value stream for you to have that salad available for your dinner. While
the salad value stream might not be as complex as global package delivery
or automobile manufacturing, it makes you stop to think about what it really
takes to bring a product to market.
Looking at the flow of information
The creation of a product or service involves more than the direct flow of
labor and materials — it also involves a flow of information. This information
flow is exactly what it sounds like: It’s all the information needed by all the
processes and customers along the way to enable products and services to
move through the value stream. The complete analysis of process and infor-
mation flow within the value stream is what sets Lean apart from simple
process analysis.
During the design and development phase, information flow includes require-
ments and design specifications, drawings, equipment specifications, manu-
facturing specifications, governmental filings. During the production phase,
the information flow includes product orders, material releases, schedules,
inventory, and quality data. During the post production phase, the informa-
tion flow includes billing, collections, and banking functions.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

For complex products like an automobile, millions of bits of information are
created all along the value stream. Each of literally tens of thousands of parts
have related design, production, and post-production information. Timely,
complete and accurate information is required by many processes to ensure
a smooth flow through to product delivery and support. If any kind of inter-
ruption or inaccuracies in the information flow occurs, not only may the
consumer not receive his vehicle in a timely manner, but it could also be
very costly to the manufacturing process — particularly if the interruption
causes a safety or quality issue in the field.
Muda abounds in information processes, which is one reason that tracking
the information flow is so important. If you can produce a product in min-
utes, but it takes hours or days to process the order, how lean is your
process? And how well are you serving your customer?
In the ready-made salad example, the production information flow includes
 The grocery store sending an order to the salad company telling them
what they need for the next day, based on sales
 A production schedule being prepared for each morning
 The salad company verifying the ingredients and container inventories
for freshness and availability, based on the production schedule
 The company placing an order to its distributors for next morning
delivery
 The distributors sending orders to their warehouse and shipping opera-
tions to meet the terms of the order
 The order cycles repeating all the way to the growers of the produce,
wherever they’re located in the world
Any issue with transmission or availability at any step in the process puts the
company at risk of supplying the grocery with the product they need for the
next day. And all this information is type-1 muda: It’s required by the
processes, but none of it is value-added from the consumer’s perspective.
When introducing technology to the information flow, you have an opportu-
nity to improve the business process and eliminate waste. An old Lean adage
is “Simplify, eliminate, automate, then integrate.” It applies to all areas of the
business.

 Setting the stage for analyzing and improving your processes
A
ll businesses and organizations are ultimately defined by what they pro-
duce. Not only do the most successful organizations produce goods and
services that are highly valued by customers or consumers, but they also
produce them in a manner that sustains the organization’s viability over the
long term. In the Lean enterprise, these capabilities are not an accident.
They’re the result of a very conscious awareness that every activity is really
a process that adds some amount of measurable value. But how much value is
a process adding? How productively? Within any given process, where are
time, resources and efforts being wasted? And how do you make it better?
Think of a process as a place — a desk, a deli counter, a repair shop, a fac-
tory, or a hospital emergency room. Now think of the things that pass
through those places — paperwork, sandwich materials, repair parts, raw
materials, or patients. For everything that passes through those places, a
transformation occurs: The paperwork is completed, the deli materials
become a sandwich, the widget gets fixed, a consumer product is built, or 
the patient is treated. That transformation is the value-added result of the
process. It all happens in a certain amount of time — at a certain rate — and
it consumes various resources, such as space, energy, tools, and materials. It
also takes a certain amount of applied effort and expertise to accomplish.
Now think of those things that pass through these places as a flow of materi-
als and information. And consider precisely how and when the process
added — or didn’t add — value. How long did the paperwork just sit there

before it was processed? How much scrap cheese or lettuce was thrown
away in the making of the sandwich? How big of a mess was made on the
workbench? How long did the customer have to wait? (We don’t even dare
ask about the emergency room!)
This flow of materials and information through a process to deliver a product
or service to a customer is known as the value stream. A Value Stream Map is
a graphical representation of the value stream. The Value Stream Map has an
enterprise focus, instead of a functional one, because it covers all the activi-
ties required to bring the product or service to fruition. It depicts all the
steps and highlights any ineffectiveness in the value stream.
As Lean has evolved out of the former incarnations of continuous-improvement
initiatives, the Value Stream Map has moved to center stage. The Value Stream
Map, combined with Kaizen, forms the heart of the continuous-improvement
part of Lean.
In this chapter, we show you how to look at your value stream from a macro
level; what the elements of a Value Stream Map (VSM) are; how to construct
and read a Current-State VSM; how to validate the VSM that you’ve created;
and how to measure and summarize the current state with a box score.
The Who, What, and Why 
of Value Stream Maps
A Value Stream Map is a graphical representation of how all the steps in any
process line up to produce a product or service, as well as the flow of informa-
tion that triggers the process into action. In the product world, the process
may be about something physical, like making a car, creating a design, or
authoring a report. In the service world, the process may be calling a help
desk, buying pre-prepared food for dinner, or obtaining a driver’s license.
A Value Stream Map plots the course from the input of raw materials through
to the delivery of the finished goods or services to the customer. The cus-
tomer identified at the end of a Value Stream Map is not necessarily the end
customer or consumer who buys or consumes the final product or service;
the customer may be another business or even someone or some other func-
tion within your own organization.
The first Value Stream Map that you construct shows the current state — the
way things are now. Next, you identify the ideal Value Stream Map — the 
idealized notion of the process in a perfect world, where all steps are only
value-added steps. As you conduct improvement activities, which refine the
72
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

current state, you update the Value Stream Map to reflect the changes to the
process. The goal is to be continually improving the process — constantly
moving it in the direction of the ideal state.
A Value Stream Map flows from left to right with time — raw materials come
in on the left, the process steps line up in order of occurrence, and the fin-
ished products or services exit to the right. The main flow is like the river
channel, and the ancillary processes are like tributaries that feed the main
process. In addition, the process steps are timed and then further catego-
rized as value-added or non-value-added. A full Value Stream Map includes
not just the flow of materials, but also the flow of the supporting information.
Figure 4-1 is a typical Value Stream Map, drawn with standard conventions.
Don’t worry — in this chapter, we explain everything you see in this figure, so
if it looks like Greek to you now, just keep reading.
Value Stream Maps are often hand-drawn. However, software tools that
enable the drawing, archiving, and e-mailing of VSMs are now available.
These programs are useful, but you don’t have to have computer software to
create a fully functional VSM. You can draw one anywhere, on just about any-
thing, including a dry-erase board, a pad of paper, or even the proverbial
napkin. Anything will work, as long as it communicates!

Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

The purpose of a Value Stream Map
Why is a Value Stream Map so useful? What does a VSM provide that other
process diagrams or activity descriptions don’t? Here’s the rundown:
 The VSM always has the customer’s perspective and is focused on deliv-
ering to the customer’s expectations, wants, and needs.
 The VSM, in a single view, provides a complete, fact-based, time-series
representation of the stream of activities — from beginning to end —
required to deliver a product or service to the customer.
 The VSM provides a common language and common view to analyze the
value stream.
 The VSM shows how the information flows to trigger and support those
activities.
 The VSM shows you where your activities add value and where they
don’t, enabling you to see what ultimate impedes your ability to supply
and satisfy your customer.
After you construct the Value Stream Map, not only do you see the process
from the customer’s point of view, but you also see what is required and how
long it takes to deliver the product or service to the customer. The VSM
shows you the primary activities, as well as the ancillary processes. And the
VSM is not limited to the traditional functional perspective — it shows all the
contributing activities and processes.
The people who use a Value Stream Map
Who uses a VSM? The users are many, because it helps everyone involved.
Here are some examples of how people in your organization may use the VSM:
 Process owners: These are the people who own the cost of the process
and the value it creates. In a VSM, process owners can quickly identify
the opportunities for improvement throughout the whole value stream.
 Process designers: These are the people who design and help imple-
ment changes to improve processes. They use a VSM to focus on inter-
nal process steps and minimize non-value-added activities within and
among those process steps.
 Process workers: These are the people who work within processes and
must understand the context of the process and process changes. They
see in a VSM where their own process activities are located, and they
can quickly identify ways to improve their process.
74
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Supply-chain managers: Supply-chain managers must optimize the inter-
faces with suppliers. They use a VSM to look for opportunities to estab-
lish delivery windows, consolidated delivery routes (known in Lean as
milk runs), and level schedules, as well as other opportunities to
improve the logistics of the value stream.
 Procurement managers: These are the people who must negotiate rela-
tionships with suppliers. In a VSM, procurement managers find opportu-
nities to work with suppliers to receive incoming products and services
in a manner that supports the Lean initiatives in the facility. This some-
times includes bringing Lean principles into the supplier community.
 Information technology (IT): These are the people who have to manage
the supporting information flow. They see in a VSM where they need to
develop systems to support Lean efforts and properly link upstream and
downstream systems of the value stream.
The elements of a Value Stream Map
The VSM is a snapshot of the value stream at a specific point in its evolution.
It’s a graphical representation of all the steps occurring in a process. In addi-
tion, a VSM contains essential, descriptive process information. Generally, a
VSM contains the following:
 Process Steps: The VSM depicts each of the process steps in the value
stream, including both value-added (VA) and non-value-added (NVA).
The VSM reveals process statistics like cycle time, NVA time, changeover
time, number of operators, number of pieces, amount of inventory, and
percent defective.
 Inventory: The VSM highlights storage, as well as the amount and move-
ment of inventory within the process.
 Information flow: All supporting information required by the process is
depicted on the VSM. This can include orders, schedules, specifications,
kanban signals (a kanban is a signal to replenish inventory in a pull
system), shipping information, and more.
 Box score: A VSM includes a summary of the key operational metrics of
the process. At a minimum, this includes a summary of the total lead
time of a process with the value-added and non-value-added times iden-
tified. The summary may also include such information as distance trav-
eled, parts per shift, scrap, pieces produced per labor hour, changeover
time, inventory turns, uptime, downtime, and more — it’s whatever mat-
ters to your business.
75
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

 Lead time: Along the bottom of the VSM is the current lead time perfor-
mance of the value stream. Lead time is the amount of time that one
piece takes to flow completely through the process. The time is divided
into value-added and non-value-added portions. At a glance, you can see
where the major portions of non-value-added time occurs.
 Takt time: A box in the upper-right-hand corner of the VSM shows the
customer demand rate or takt time. This rate is determined by the cus-
tomer demand and production time available. Ideally, all steps in the
value stream should then produce to this rate. The takt time is like a
metronome setting the pace for music.
Teams often find it unwieldy to try to map the whole value stream at a
detailed level all at one time. Start with your immediate customer and map
the stream back to the point where you receive inputs from a supplier. Just
don’t lose sight of where in the overall value stream your process fits.
Pick one product family (a series of products or services that pass through
the same processing steps) to map. If the product family is processed at more
than one location, for instance a eastern service center and a western service
center, then focus on one location, but include representatives from the other
location on the improvement team.
Row, Row, Row Your Boat: 
Getting Started
A Value Stream Map isn’t difficult to make. In the following sections, we guide
you through the process of creating your very own VSM.
Identifying the natural owner
Every value stream has a natural owner, who acts as the hub to make it easier
to manage the improvement activities. The natural owner is like the captain of
the ship — someone who by her very position or role in the organization man-
ages the value stream. The natural owner is normally not a functional boss.
If you can’t readily identify the natural owner, find someone who can be
assigned the ownership role to drive the Lean improvement initiative.
76
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Gathering the crew
Begin constructing a Value Stream Map by gathering the cross-functional
team that represents all the disciplines involved in the process. Bring them
together into a workshop setting. Having all these areas represented in the
Value Stream Map improves the quality of the VSM and facilitates conversa-
tion between the team members about the “real” process. The workshop set-
ting creates a focused environment where people are away from the
distractions of their day-to-day jobs.
Outside Lean experts are also a vital part of the initial crew. They help ensure
that the efforts are launched effectively. Lean experts train the organization
in Lean tools and techniques, guide the development of initial Value Stream
Mapping and facilitate the initial improvement efforts. They also help mentor
people in how to think and act in a Lean way.
The ideal core team size has five to seven members. Larger teams are unwieldy,
and smaller ones are too narrowly focused. You can bring in support experts
when you’re analyzing specific value-stream tributaries. Eventually, you’ll
expand the team to include customers and suppliers as you expand your Lean
implementation.
Have someone who is not part of the team act as a facilitator to record the
value stream. This helps the team to focus on the content, while the facilita-
tor focuses on capturing the value stream.
Using mapping tools
Mapping the value stream can be as simple or as complex as you choose to
make it. Whatever method or combination of methods you choose to use, it’s
important, in a group setting, that all participants can clearly see the Value
Stream Map being created. Your options for mapping include the following:
 No tech: Paper stuck to the wall, and markers
 Low tech: Templates or preprinted formats
 High tech: Software programs like those available from EVSM
(www.evsm.com) or iGrafx (www.igrafx.com).
When you draw a Value Stream Map, be sure to follow the conventions for
drawing each icon that represents an activity, element, or event. VSM soft-
ware tools supply these icons automatically. The basic, standard icons used
in a VSM are shown in Table 4-1. The book Learning to See, by Mike Rother
and John Shook, is a good VSM reference manual, including instructions and
a complete listing of VSM icons.

Gathering supporting information
Capture information about all the process steps at a detailed level. The more
detail that is available, the easier it is to uncover the waste — the muda (see
Chapters 2 and 3). Each team member brings with them supporting informa-
tion to enable the Value Stream Mapping process. The more information you
have readily available during the construction of the VSM, the better the
resulting Value Stream Map.
Supporting information needed to build a VSM may include the following:
 The end consumer’s requirements and expectations
 A macro-level view of the entire value stream from the consumer all the
way back through to raw materials and information
 Customer schedules and demand information
 Process-time studies, including
• Cycle time (C/T)
• Lead times
• Number of operators
• Changeover time (C/O)
• Working time, less breaks
• Photos and video of the operations in their current state
 Standard work instructions
 Quality information
 Equipment uptime and availability
 Product and process variations
 Inventory and work-in-process (WIP)
79
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

 Batch sizes
 Pack quantities and other shipping information
 Cost data
 Any other information that will help you characterize the process
The best way to understand a process is to go to it and watch it yourself for a
significant length of time. If you can, videotape the operations. The video will
give you an objective perspective — you’ll notice things you don’t normally
see when you concentrate on a specific part of the process over many cycles.
People can watch themselves to see what they really do, instead of what they
think they do.
A VSM example: Pre-made gourmet salads
Imagine that you’re on your lunch break or heading home after working out
at the gym. You’re hungry and you want something quick to eat. You don’t
feel like cooking and you don’t have time for a restaurant. So you pop in to
your local grocery and grab a pre-made, gourmet salad from the deli case.
You expect the salad to be fresh and flavorful. Because you’re paying a pre-
mium, you expect a gourmet offering of high-quality ingredients, uniquely
combined and pleasingly presented. You want a variety to choose from. And
you may be delighted if you tried a salad that then became your new favorite.
Have you ever stopped to think about all the things that have to happen in
order to bring that fresh, flavorful salad to you? It seems simple enough —
not much more than lettuce, toppings, and a bowl. That doesn’t sound too
difficult, right? But when you look at it closely, there’s much more to it than
what you see on the surface.
What’s happening behind the scenes? What are all the pieces, who are all 
the people, and how is it all coming together just right? How much of all the
effort, activity, time, materials, and cost involved actually adds value to you,
the customer? How consistent is it? Businesses who take the time to map 
and improve their processes can execute a process like this consistently and
effectively thousands of times a day to satisfy discerning customers like you.
The first look at the value stream is always from the consumer’s point of
view. In this example, the consumer is the hungry person. Her requirements
are indicated in Figure 4-2 via a Kano model.
80
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

After the consumer’s requirements and expectations are understood, the
next step is to map out the high-level flow of all the process steps that must
occur across the entire value stream in order to meet those requirements and
expectations. This high-level view is called the macro-level value stream, and
it’s used to set the context within which the provider understands how it
must operate.
Macro-level value stream diagrams begin with the consumer and flow upstream
through all the various processes that must support the consumer’s demands.
Unlike a process-flow diagram, a macro-level value-stream diagram moves from
right to left, emphasizing the pivotal role of the customer at each step.
The macro-level value stream for the salad production process is shown in
Chapter 3. It starts with the consumer and flows all the way upstream to
where nature produces wild salmon. This simple chart encompasses a global
supply stream — so global that, when taken from its first tributary, raw mate-
rials, all the way through to the consumer, it takes years to complete. All for a
salad!
Contained within each box in Figure 3-4 are multiple individual processes and
different companies that support the overall value stream. By first depicting
the value stream at this high level, you can see where the salad company fits
into the picture.
Understanding how your part fits into the overall value stream and how you
contribute to the consumer’s demands is important. Start by creating a
macro-level value-stream diagram that shows your contribution to the overall
value stream.

Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

Going forward, you aren’t going to construct a detailed VSM for the entire
value stream. Such an exercise could take years. A full Value Stream Map
would nearly evolve into a map of the planet’s ecosystem. You don’t need to
map everything! Start at the level of your contribution, and refine the detail
or expand the scope as you dive into the value stream. The waste-devil is in
those details — that’s where you’ll uncover muda.
We refer back to this salad company example though the following sections, as
we show you how to develop and validate the Current-State Value Stream Map.
Sorting Through the Tributaries: Creating
the Current-State Value Stream Map
After you’ve identified the captain, assembled the crew, and gathered the crit-
ical data about your processes, you’re ready to chart the course and create
your Current-State Value Stream Map. Begin by capturing how your process
works now — before any improvement efforts have started. From this initial
VSM, you’ll begin to understand where the waste is in the process. Before
you start to construct the VSM, it’s a good idea to go to gemba (go to where
the action is, and review the process in situ). This will give everyone a
common starting point of reference.
Start at the end closest to the customer and record the process from the end,
working your way upstream to the beginning. You’ll see what your value
stream is doing the farther away from the customer you travel.
Identifying the activities
Begin by titling the Current-State VSM, dating it and identifying the major
process steps.
Most teams start with the part of the value stream that they own. After you’ve
identified the major process steps, you can use your supporting information
to more precisely characterize each step.
In the salad example (see “A VSM example: Pre-made gourmet salads,” earlier
in this chapter), the salad company owns the part of the value stream where
the salads are made and delivered to the grocer. With the participation of the
cross-functional team, this process can be further divided into its major
82
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

process activities. This team includes the owner, the lead chef, the sous chef,
the driver, the kitchen hand, and an outside observer. The activities are rep-
resented in the Value Stream Map.
The salad company recognizes that it conducts five major process activities.
For each salad, these activities are
 Preparing ingredients
 Assembling the salad
 Labeling the container
 Packing the container
 Shipping to the grocer
On the right-hand side of the map is the customer. You may choose to show
the immediate customer as well as the consumer. For any outside player —
including the consumer, customer, supplier, or any other source — use the
outside source icon.
Along the bottom, from left to right, in sequential order, are the steps in the
process of your part of the value stream. The first step on the left side is the
first process. The last step on the right side is the final step before the prod-
uct or service is given to the customer. In the case of the salad company,
Figure 4-3 shows that the operation on the left-hand side of its value stream is
“Prep Ingredients” and the final process, on the right-hand side, is “Shipping.”
After you lay out the process steps, connect them with the appropriate con-
nector. Dashed arrows indicate material pushed through the system. Open
arrows are for material movement to or from external sources. Indicate
where inventory is stored in the process — beginning, work in process, or
end. Unique icons exist for regular inventory, buffer stock, supermarkets,
safety stock, and queues. Clearly identify what type of inventory is in
process, in addition to the amount of inventory at each location.
Take your first pass through the VSM at a relatively high level. After you char-
acterize the value stream at this level, you can choose an area of focus, and
map that at a greater level of detail. The process for creating any map, though,
is the same.
Beware of the dangers of mapping paralysis. Don’t get caught up in making
the VSM so complete and perfect that you don’t proceed to the improvement
stage. Make your initial best cut and move on. You’ll have plenty of opportu-
nities to come back and improve your VSM later.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Qualifying and quantifying
After you’ve captured the Current-State VSM, it’s time to quantify the process
and qualify the value-added (VA) and non-value-added (NVA) activities. Cycle
time, changeover time, inventory levels, and the number of operators are all
types of information you’ll use to understand and analyze the process.
Characterizing the process time
When considering process time, there are a number of angles. For each step in
the value stream, evaluate the step by asking the following types of questions:
 What is the actual time required to perform the task identified in the
process step?
 What is the waiting time before each step?
 If inventory is involved, how long does it take to deplete it?
 What is the transport or conveyance time?
 What is the inventory between the last operation and the consumer?
 How many operators are active at each process step?
 How long does it take to change over a process when changing product
types?
The VSM is a snapshot in time. Use the best data you have available to get
the job done. If you have to estimate some of the times, go ahead. You’ll be
able to validate the estimates later with actual data.
After your team has answered these questions, you can assign a time value for
each process step. From these observations, determine the value-added time.
(In the next section, we help you decide what is VA and NVA and record a por-
tion of NVA time on the map.) After the entire process has been characterized,
sum the individual times to arrive at an overall process time for the Value
Stream Map. If you’re using a software package, the overall calculation will be
done for you based on the information you enter about each process step.
Deciding what is value-added and what is non-value-added
Now it’s time to decide which process steps are value-added (VA) and which
ones are the dreaded non-value-added (NVA) steps in the process.
To be value-added, an activity must meet the three VA criteria:
 The customer must be willing to pay for it.
 It must transform the product or service in some way.
 It must be done correctly the first time.
85
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

Anything that doesn’t meet these three criteria is NVA and is, therefore, a
waste of some type.
Identify each process step and activity as either VA or NVA. At this early
stage, you’re not trying to weed out non-value-added activity. The process
statistics will show the VA and NVA data for later examination. As you
develop the map to a finer level of detail going forward, you’ll see exactly
which steps add value and which don’t.
Don’t get hung up on dissecting VA versus NVA classification at this stage. Pick
one, assign it, and move on. In the end, you’ll improve the entire process. The
designation of VA and NVA are guidelines for when you start the improvement
activities.
In the salad example, only those steps that directly contribute to the finished
salad are value-added. For example, cutting the lettuce, baking the chicken,
slicing the chicken, putting the ingredients in the container — these are all
VA. These steps, however, are buried in the macro process steps “Prep
Ingredients” and “Assemble Salads.”
There are two types of non-value-added steps (defined in Chapter 3):
 Type-1 muda: Non-value-added but necessary.
 Type-2 muda: Non-value-added and not necessary.
In the salad company example, placing labels on the top and bottom of the
container is considered type-1 muda. The labels do not directly contribute to
the customer receiving her salad, but they are required for the scanning and
payment processes at the grocery store. Another example of type-1 muda is
the weighing of the ingredients during the assembly process. The weight
adds nothing to the transformation of the salad, but it does ensure the qual-
ity and consistency of the product. Examples of type-2 muda are trips back
and forth to the cooler for forgotten items or disposing ingredients that are
still good.
Review the process and designate each step as VA or NVA. For the NVA, note
the type: T1 or T2. This information will be handy when you start to identify
improvement opportunities.
When the process owner maps the process along with an outside observer,
her perception of the process is typically idealized. But when an outside
observer goes to gemba herself to observe the process, the findings are often
eye opening for all involved. (“Holy cow! Do we really do that?”)
86
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Quantifying overall lead time
Lead time is the amount of time it takes one piece to flow though the process
from start to finish, including process time, inventory time, waiting time, and
so on. In the case of the salad example, it’s the time from when the shipment
of produce arrives until it’s transformed into a shipped salad. In the case of a
service, obtaining a duplicate driver’s license for example, it’s the time from
when you walk in the door of the DMV until you have your new license in
hand. Within the lead time are value-added and non-value-added activities. A
detailed time-study analysis will help you to identify these activities — so
bring your stopwatch to gemba.
On the VSM, you draw a line along the bottom of the map to represent the
overall lead time for the product or service. The line is segmented according
to the lead time of each major step in the process. Where value-added work is
being done, you can record it below the overall lead time line, to visually see
the difference between the lead time and value-added time. (See Figure 4-3 for
an example.) You may be shocked at what you find — lots of NVA and little
bitty amounts of VA. If you use a software package, like iGrafx, it automati-
cally generates the line for you based on the data you provide.
Determining the information flow
Every process transforms a product or service for a customer. In addition to
the material (product or service) being transformed, the process requires
certain other information — information about the transformation. This infor-
mation flow might include any instructions, orders, or messages that occur
through the course of the process. Information flow may also include sched-
ules, orders, shipping transmittals, approvals, and more — whatever is
needed to support the process.
One unique feature of the Value Stream Map is the representation of informa-
tion flow as well as the direct flow of materials and services. What is the
information flow, and why is it so important? Information flow is critical to
the timely and effective execution of the process, so it’s represented directly
on the Value Stream Map.
Initially, consider the location, quantity, and frequency of the information
flow, using penetrating questions like these:
 What information is being transmitted?
 When is information being sent?
 Who receives the information and are they the right people to receive
the information?
87
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

 Where in the value stream does the information transmittal occur?
 How is the information being sent — manually or electronically?
Start with the information that is vital for the value stream to function. You
can always add additional information flows to the VSM later. Place the vital
information flow on the VSM at the proper location. Indicate information flow
using the rectangular information box. Remember that there are two informa-
tion arrows. Manual transmissions use a straight arrow, and electronic trans-
missions use a jagged arrow that resembles a lightning bolt. (See Figure 4-3
for an example.)
In the salad example, information flow includes such items as the daily cus-
tomer order, the production schedule, the order to the suppliers, and the
order list for each customer location. Other examples of information flow
along the entire value stream include:
 The grocery sends orders to the salad company.
 Production sheets schedule the kitchen assembly process.
 The salad company sends orders to distributors for the ingredients
needed and delivery times required.
 The salad company sends orders to container suppliers.
 Distributors send orders to the growers.
 Customs brokers file papers to import produce from other countries.
 Suppliers send delivery receipts with produce orders.
 The grocery fills out product return sheets and sends these sheets back
to the salad company with products that did not sell before the expira-
tion date.
Summing Up the Process
After you develop the initial Current-State Value Stream Map, you summarize
the key descriptive process statistics and place them in a summary chart
directly on the map.
The graphic for this is called a box score. Think of a box score in sports, like
baseball — it contains important statistics on players, the score, hits, errors,
runs, and so on. The concept of the box score in Lean is similar.
88
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

The box score
The box score is a summary of the critical statistics of a process. At the very
least, the box score usually includes the total lead time and the value-added
and non-value-added time. If the process includes the physical movement of
an object, then travel distance is also normally included. Physical movement
refers to any object that is transformed as it literally moves through the
process. Typically, transformation is thought of as a manufacturing process;
however, transformation also happens in transactional processes. An exam-
ple of a transformation in an office setting includes the completion of paper-
work through several departments of a process.
Box-score contents
The box score contains the summary chart of the key process metrics. You
often want to contrast the measured scores against an ideal state, where all
process steps are only value-added. (More about the ideal state in Chapter 5.)
In the salad company example, its initial box score includes its portion of the
value stream — from receipt of ingredients to shipment of the finished
salads. The box score is shown in Table 4-2.

In the future, the salad company may need to track other metrics to address
other types of waste in its value stream. Some of these metrics may include
inventory turns, the value of lost ingredients due to waste or expiration, the
number of unsold salads versus shipped salads, or salads as shipped versus
salad as priced. As the company dives deeper into the value stream, it will
select the measurements that will best gauge improvement efforts.
89
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

Additional metrics for a box score
The following are some of the other common metrics that companies may
include in their box score:
 Parts per shift: Parts produced during a standard work shift
 Scrap: The percentage of defective parts produced
 Pieces per labor hour: The total number of piece produced divided by
the amount of labor hours expended
 Changeover time: The amount of time required to convert a manufactur-
ing line from the last good part of the previous product to the first good
part of the new product
 Inventory turns: The number of times a company’s inventory cycles in a
year (Inventory Turns = Average Annual Cost of Goods Sold ÷ Average
Annual Inventory)
 Uptime: The amount of time the equipment is actually producing versus
the planned production time
 Cost breakdown: An evaluation of the cost components at each step of
the process
Takt time
Takt is the German word for beat. In Lean, it is the pace of production tied to
customer consumption. The takt time may be shown in the box score or in a
note on the VSM. The formula is Takt Time = Available Production Time ÷
Customer Demand.
The salad company uses its kitchen to support other value streams. For the
premade salads distributed to local groceries, the available production time
is 3 hours (or 10,800 seconds [3 × 60 × 60]), and the customer demand is 200
salads per day (on average). So the takt time is 10,800 ÷ 200, or 54 seconds
per salad.
Check the Chart: Validating 
the Value Stream Map
Have you ever driven the same route to work or home but not really seen
what you were driving past? Then, one day, you notice a restaurant or busi-
ness that has been there for years. You’ve passed it hundreds of times, but
for whatever reason, on that day you noticed it for the first time.
90
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

The same thing can happen to members of a team with respect to the value
stream where they work. You can walk by a process or an office but not really
“see” what’s happening. When the team is capturing the first VSM, it’s impor-
tant that there be a common starting point — that all the members “see” the
same thing.
Although perfection is not a requirement, you do want the baseline starting
point to be as accurate as possible. Real improvements happen from a
common leaping point. Maybe the team thinks that standardized work is in
place, when it’s really not. Or maybe the team assumes one step is in a differ-
ent place than it really occurs. Information that one team member believes is
important to be distributed may not be getting to the “right” people, or it
may not be so important after all. In any case, you have to validate your VSM
before you proceed to the improvement phase of the game.
Although the team members might think they know what’s going on in the
value stream, the only way to truly know is to go to gemba (go to where the
action is happening). It’s one thing to walk by the process — it’s a totally 
different thing to observe with intention. When you stand and observe the
process over a repeated number of cycles, your eyes are opened to what is
really occurring.
One powerful tool is videotaping the process, and then reviewing the video
with the team. The video will create a common foundation from which the
improvements can occur.
The key things that you’re validating are
 Whether the process depicted on the Value Stream Map is, in fact, the
process
 Whether the process time is correct (particularly if you use estimates)
 Whether the inventory amounts are accurate
 Whether the number of operators is correct
 Whether the process is being performed according to a standard
instruction
 Whether the key process statistics are correct
 Whether all operators are performing the activities in the same manner
 The number of process changeovers that are performed and how long
they take
 The accuracy of the quality data, and the identification of where the
defects are occurring in the process
91
Chapter 4: A Resource Runs through It: Value Stream Mapping

Sometimes not every person involved in the process is involved in construct-
ing the Current-State VSM. Involving experts to assist you with a portion of
the VSM can be a great idea. Not every person is going to know every nuance
of every process. Seek out experts who truly know what’s going on.
After you’ve identified the discrepancies, the team can update and correct
the Current-State VSM. The team may also decide that it needs to further
refine an activity and map it.
Detail is very important. You may start with a higher-level view of the value
stream. As the improvement efforts progress, you may take one of those
steps and create a more detailed Value Stream Map. The more detail that is
available, the easier it is to uncover the waste (the muda).

 Analyzing the Current-State Value Stream Map
 Creating a vision of the future
 Planning your Lean implementation within the organization
T
o make a change, you need a catalyst. In Lean, the catalyst for change is
the recognition that the current state is not where you want to be. Lean is
applicable whether you need to fix something that’s broken or prepare for
new opportunities to come. This perspective comes from the Current-State
Value Stream Map (VSM), combined with supporting information like quality
data, customer complaints, or financial reports. So like that “fat picture” that
sends you to the gym and juice bar to get healthy, the Current-State VSM and
supporting information provides that objective reflection that nudges an
organization to modify its processes and practices and make the business
healthy and vital.
When you decide to make a change, not only do you plan where you’re going
to go, but you also consider where you could go. You ask what’s possible. For
example, when you decide to get healthy, does healthy just mean weighing
less? It may also mean better cardio performance, improved flexibility, lower
cholesterol, or a smaller clothing size. In a perfect world, what would a per-
fectly healthy you look like? The thought process is the same when you
decide to make changes in your business. In Lean, the Ideal VSM is used to
define that perfect world — what your business would look like if anything
were possible. You then use the Future-State VSM to paint the picture of where
you want to go next.
In this chapter, we show you how to analyze your Current-State VSM to get a
real picture of the process. You discover how to develop the Ideal-State and
Future-State Value Stream Maps. Along the way, we answer common questions
and respond to common objections about Value Stream Mapping. Finally, you
determine how your future plans fit with other organizational initiatives.

Investigating the Value Stream for Clues
In Chapter 4, we show you how to create a Value Stream Map (VSM) for the
current state of the business. After this initial Current-State VSM is complete,
your next mission is to dive into it and understand where the waste is occur-
ring. You first start looking for waste when you qualify the value of the steps
in the stream (see Chapter 4). At this point in the process, you look for where
the flow is less than ideal.
If the process is in a state of ideal flow, you make one as the consumer takes
one (no matter what that “one” product or service is). The process is in per-
fect balance. All steps take the same amount of time. There is no inventory in
process. The process contains only value-added activities. All process steps
produce perfectly. You have the exact capacity needed for the consumption
rate, with the exactly correct staff.
The Current-State VSM, combined with the use of the supporting data, pro-
vide the clues telling you where to start looking for improvement opportuni-
ties. In Lean, you strive for the entire value stream flowing unencumbered at
a rate equal to the customer’s demand in the most effective manner (that is,
with the highest quality, the shortest lead time, and the lowest cost). You can
quantify this customer demand by looking at the demand rate, or takt time.
By using this metric, you can start to analyze the current state to evaluate
where blockages to the flow are occurring. The blockages can be traced
directly to muda. You improve performance by resolving and removing the
root cause of these blockages.
The Lean process is one of seeking understanding. You seek to understand
the customer and the consumer. You seek to understand the nature of your
processes and the origins of waste and loss. The most fundamental Lean tool
you use in your search is the question. You ask questions — many questions —
to discover truth and understanding. Because this process of investigation is
one of asking questions, the analysis is framed by questions.
Rounding up the usual suspects
As you begin your analysis of the Current-State VSM, start by considering the
most common causes. What does your customer say about you? The answer
to this question will provide immediate insight. Even if the customer voices
issues that aren’t at the root of the problem, the customer may give you clues
as to what the issue truly is. If you aren’t getting any indications from the cus-
tomer, start looking for evidence of the three Ms: muda, mura, and muri.
94
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

While conducting the analysis of the current state, mark up a copy of the
Current-State VSM. If you’re using the low-tech, pencil-and-paper method, use
a different color to indicate where in the value stream the opportunities for
improvement exist.
Putting your ear to the street
When analyzing the Current-State VSM, start with the customer — always
start with the customer. What are your customers saying about you? Listen
closely and carefully — and objectively — to what your customers say. As
you hear the feedback, examine the issues and identify where they occur in
the value stream. For example, are your customers complaining about not
getting your product when they want it? Look at the critical path to delivery.
Are they complaining about not getting the right mix of product? Examine the
material flow and information flow. Are they concerned about the quality of
your product? Study the design and manufacturing processes. If you’re lucky
and your customers are all singing your praises, you may need to make room
for new business.
An effective tool for analyzing potential causes of customer issues is the
Ishikawa Diagram, also know as the Cause-and-Effect or Fishbone Diagram.
With this tool, you can identify where in the value stream the issues origi-
nate. Figure 5-1 shows an example of an Ishikawa Diagram illustrating a case
in which the customers complain that the product is late.
Examine the many possible causes for the delays. Use your supporting infor-
mation to help you identify the most likely root causes of the delays, and to
quantify how late “late” really is. Is the complaint a recent development or
has there been a chronic problem? Look in the value stream to find the opera-
tions that are sources for the major issues. Ask these types of questions to
identify issues in the value stream that are directly affecting the customers:
 Are the operations running slower than takt time?
 Are there deviations to the work standards?
 Is the product not available for shipment?
 Have there been material supply issues?
 Are the drivers leaving late from the facility?
 Have there been any personnel changes?
Focus on fixing the process, not assigning blame to people. Lean is all about
respecting people. Most of the time, you will find a process problem (like a
lack of defined standards) preventing people from performing at their best.
95
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

If you answer “yes” to these types of questions, you have the opportunity to
use what’s called the 5 Whys. The aim of the 5 Whys is to find the root cause
of a problem. When using 5-Why questioning, you ask “Why?” until you’ve
exhausted answers and found the root cause of the problem. Practicing 5
Whys is like becoming a curious three-year-old again, when the question
“But why?” was the first thing out of your mouth. Here’s what this technique
looks like in action:
Are the drivers leaving late from the facility?
Yes. But why?
Because the product isn’t ready. Why?
Because the production line was behind. Why?
Because the supplier was behind. Why?
Because the order was issued late. Why?
You get the idea. In this example, these whys would lead you to look at the
ordering process.
Start your Current-State VSM analysis by finding the sources of your cus-
tomers’ irritations. After you’ve identified those sources, the next step is to
look for muda (see the following section).

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Searching for muda
You’ve seen your business through the eyes of your customer and examined
the direct causes of customer dissatisfaction. Now you must look within, and
find causes of waste occurring inside your business. During the first pass
through the Current-State VSM, you initially designate process steps as value-
added (VA) or non-value-added (NVA). Now it’s time to examine these desig-
nations more closely.
Refer to Chapter 2 for the precise definitions of value-added and waste.
Lean strives to eliminate all wasteful forms. To find waste, ask the following
types of questions:
 Is excess inventory or work in process accumulating along the value
stream?
 Does the step create value? If not, why does the step exist in the process
and can it be eliminated?
 Does the step create scrap or rejects? If so, it’s a candidate for improve-
ment and, at the very least, further study.
 Is the step capable? If not, the step should be improved using statistical
tools, like those found in the Six Sigma methodology. (For more informa-
tion on Six Sigma, see Six Sigma For Dummies, by Craig Gygi, Neil DeCarlo,
and Bruce Williams [published by Wiley])
 Does the step perform as designed?
 Is the equipment needed to perform the step functioning?
 Are the materials required available, at the right quality level, and in the
right quantity?
 What is the capacity of the process step? How does it compare to the
takt time?
 Is the step flexible?
 When changing from one product or service to the next, how long is the
process step not producing? (This question is aimed at understanding
changeover time.)
 Does the process step flow or is the step a bottleneck in the process?
 How does the process time of the step compare to the customer
demand?
After designating each process step, the team can calculate the value-added
portion of the process and compare it to the non-value-added portion.
97
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

Anytime you use re– in front of a word, it is a candidate for waste elimination,
because, by its very definition, it means you aren’t doing it right the first time.
Get a physical layout of the work areas, and create a two-dimensional flow
diagram that reflects the physical movement of material or people through
the process. This technique is especially useful in manufacturing processes,
lab processes, restaurant kitchens, and other places where physical material
moves through processes and places. These layouts are commonly known as
Spaghetti Diagrams (see Chapter 7), because after all the movements are
drawn out, it tends to look like a plate of spaghetti!
Analyzing from different perspectives
Different players in the value stream bring a different set of eyes and informa-
tion to the evaluation of the Current-State VSM. Whether you’re improving an
unhealthy business practice or enabling the pursuit of a new opportunity,
take the time to examine the value stream through different perspectives. As
you strive to find the muda, these different views can be invaluable sources
of insight.
The VSM team will involve people working in the process who have a daily
operational perspective. This will include process owners, including the
value-stream owner, and perhaps even the business owner. In addition to
these participants, others have a keenly valuable perspective.
Lean principles: The Lean sensei’s view
The Lean sensei is the master and teacher of the Lean principles and knowl-
edge. (For more information about the Lean sensei see Chapter 12.) The Lean
sensei guides and teaches the organization to learn, implement, and embody the
Lean philosophy. The lens through which the sensei evaluates the Current-
State VSM highlights the short-term and long-term opportunities to institution-
alize Lean in the organization. The Lean view poses these types of questions:
 How closely is the process producing to takt time?
 How can the process be more visual?
 How can workers be more empowered to stop the line when quality
issues arise?
 How is the material flowing through the process?
 Where best can continuous flow be implemented?
 Where do supermarkets need to be implemented?
98
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

 Are standardized work instructions available, being followed, and visible?
 How can the workload be leveled?
 Where can operations be combined to improve flow?
 What exists in the value stream preventing the implementation of Lean
at this time? How can it be addressed?
Quality
The quality practitioners — whether they’re from a formal quality function,
or, trained Six Sigma experts — examine value-added from the perspective of
correctness: Does the transformation happen correctly? Is it done right the
first time? Is the process capable of producing defect-free results regularly?
Think of debris dumped into a river and what it does to the flow of the cur-
rent. When quality losses occur in the value stream, it is like debris dumped
into stream — impeding its flow. The quality practitioners evaluate the
process to identify where it isn’t capable of creating good product or service,
and where suppliers or downstream contributors create poor quality for the
consumer. Analyzing the value stream from a quality perspective will lead
you to ask the following types of questions:
 Where is poor quality reaching the customer? What are the defects?
 How are quality issues reported from the customer, transmitted into the
organization, and resolved?
 What is the fall-off rate at each step?
 Where are the losses the greatest?
 What is the most common cause of scrap?
 What is the root cause of the scrap (design, equipment, training, 
and so on)?
 How are suspect items handled?
 How are reworked items returned to the normal flow?
 How can the process, design, or equipment be designed to prevent
errors?
 What is the capability of each step?
 Which suppliers are the providers of the poorest quality?
 How frequently have quality spills occurred and in what location?
 What steps have been taken to quarantine defective product?

Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

Supply
Most processes have inventory — either by accident or by design. Inventory
can collect at the beginning, somewhere in middle, or at the end of the process.
Inventory acts like a dam to the flow of the value stream. Where there is inven-
tory, there is no flow. Likewise, where there are outages, there is no flow.
Balance comes in orchestrating the flow of material supply and processing
precisely to customer demand — in other words, matching the cycle time to
the takt time.
Strategically design the location of the inventory, the size of the inventory,
and the information flow throughout the value stream. Examine the Current-
State VSM for how well it consumes supply and moves material through the
process. You can do so by asking the following questions:
 What is the inventory turn level?
 What is the size of the storage?
 Where is the storage? In a warehouse? In process?
 How low can it go? Can you maintain an inventory of one?
 How is the inventory managed?
 Do you practice first in first out (FIFO)?
 What signals the withdrawals from the inventory?
 What are the reorder signals in the process?
 Where is material pushed through the system?
 Where is the material pulled through the system? Where else can pull
signals be used in the process?
 How are the raw material quantities balanced with the shipping 
quantities?
 How far does material travel in the value stream?
 How are the incoming material shipments coordinated?
 How is first in first out managed?
 When a quality issue arises, how is the inventory handled/quarantined?
 What is the dollar value of the inventory?
 What is the cost of floor space to handle the inventory?
Engineering
Evaluate the Current-State Value Stream from the perspective of the engi-
neering disciplines: design, production, and maintenance. The engineering
100
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

perspective will also help you examine the interfaces of the people, equip-
ment, and processes.
Think about the Army Corps of Engineers. They engineer the flow of the U.S.
waterways. They examine the current state and look for where modifications
need to be made. They dredge to create movement. They dam to manage
downstream flows. They design how and if flow happens. In a Lean organiza-
tion, the designers engineer how flow happens inside the value stream.
At this juncture, you’re evaluating the current state of production processes
and practices. Be aware that the designers are meanwhile developing future
designs of new products and services. Because the majority of cost is estab-
lished during the design phase, you want to involve the design engineers
during the Current-State VSM analysis. You also want to include the produc-
tion engineers to ensure continuity.
Analyzing the value stream from a production-manufacturing engineering per-
spective, will lead you to ask the following types of questions:
 Is the process designed for flow?
 Can processes be combined? Can alternative processes be used?
 How can operations be laid out to maximize the effectiveness of operators?
 How far away is the material or inventory being stored? How far does it
travel between operations?
 How is material presented into the process?
 How are the raw material quantities balanced with the shipping quantities?
 How can changeovers occur more quickly? How can concepts like the
“Indy pit crew” be applied during changeovers?
 What modifications can be done to equipment to prevent errors, facili-
tate the operation, eliminate workload from operators, combine opera-
tions, or facilitate flow?
 Is standardized work being followed? How can it be modified to improve
quality and eliminate unnecessary processing or movement?
 How can cycle times be balanced with takt time?
Analyzing the value stream from a design engineering perspective, will lead
you to ask the following types of questions:
 What type of product defects occur during the process? Where do they
occur?
 How can features be built into the design so it cannot be made incorrectly?
101
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

 What issues in the current design might be in the future designs?
 Can the design be simplified to facilitate production without compromis-
ing customer requirements?
 Are certain design specifications unnecessary for the customer require-
ments? Where can specifications be eliminated or changed without
impacting customer requirements?
 Are the design tolerances properly specified to ensure the product can
be made right the first time, every time?
Analyzing the value stream from a maintenance/equipment engineering per-
spective, will lead you to ask the following types of questions:
 What is the uptime of the equipment?
 What is the current maintenance schedule? Is it reactive or planned? If
planned, is it preventive or predictive?
 What modifications can be made to the equipment to prevent defects
from being produced?
 What pieces of equipment have the greatest maintenance issues?
 Are there different brands of equipment performing the same
function/operation? Is there a difference in performance level?
 What modifications can be made to the equipment, tooling, and process
to facilitate quick changeovers? (See Chapter 8.)
 What is the process to notify maintenance? How can it be improved?
 When there is an issue, what is the response time for maintenance to
respond? What is the time to resolve the issue?
 What simple maintenance activities can be transferred to the operators
to perform?
 What modifications, features, or controls can be added to the equipment
to enable operators to run multiple pieces of equipment?
 What controls can be added to the equipment to automatically stop
when defects are produced or equipment problems arise?
Although the questions in this section relate to the production of a product,
they also apply to a service environment. In a transactional environment, like
the hospital admissions process, the quality perspective is customer service
and data integrity related. The material perspective is patient flow and data
related. The process engineering perspective may be from a software engi-
neering perspective. The wording of the questions may be slightly altered,
but the nature of the questions or analysis is similar to the example ques-
tions in this section.
102
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Information
The VSM depicts the flow of information that supports the product and material
flow. Your analysis of the current state should include a focused examination of
the information component. The purpose of this analysis is to find opportuni-
ties to eliminate waste or make improvements based on information.
Answering the following questions will help you when determining where
waste, or muda, exists in the information flow:
 Does the information flow to the customer, without delays?
 Does the information flow from the customer, without delays?
 Does the information flow through the organization smoothly?
 Is the information flow accurate? Is the right information going to the
right people in the right place? Complete? Contradictory?
 Does the information arrive at the right time? Is it too early or late? Is
there too much or too little?
 Are the right people in the information flow and receiving the right 
information?
 Is the information being transmitted in the most efficient way?
 Is the information being acted upon?
 Are prompt and proper approval chains in place?
Evaluating the evidence: 
An analyzed example
A salad company supplies local, high-end grocery stores with gourmet salads
on a daily basis. It operates on one shift: The morning is assembly, and the
afternoon is ingredient preparation for the next day. The drivers are sched-
uled to leave the facility by 9 a.m. so that their deliveries will be complete by
11 a.m., in time for the lunch crowd. They conscientiously adhere to health
and safety standards for food preparation.
The salad company’s direct customers (the grocery retailers) have one major
complaint: The deliveries tend to run late. When the salad company reviews its
shipping data, it realizes that its drivers are leaving late from its commissary —
about 45 minutes late, almost every day.
After reviewing the video from production one morning, the team realizes that
several things were causing the product to be late in the morning. However,
103
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

the main place they need to start is with the salad assembly process. In order
to better understand where the waste is occurring, the team makes a detailed
assessment of that process. The full analysis would be much longer, but an
excerpt is shown in Table 5-1.

The team observes that the following issues directly contribute to lateness:
 In general, the process was disorganized.
 The work standards were not well defined.
 Considerable time was lost wandering around looking for things.
 The ingredient preparation work was not completed the afternoon before.
 Ingredients had not been ordered on time, causing them to send one of
the workers to purchase them at a premium from a retail store.
 Untrained workers were called in to help get the product out the door.
 The finished product was stacked at the end farthest from the door,
causing the drivers to have to “swim upstream” to get the finished prod-
uct, as well as have to carry it farther. Drivers are working in and among
the people assembling the final product.
105
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

In addition, they notice other wastes occurring in the process:
 There was an unnecessary loss of ingredients as a result of the current
process. Good product was thrown away. Containers were overfilled,
causing ingredients to fall to the work surface.
 Ingredients were not being measured, which could affect the quality and
consistency of the product, not to mention contribute to inventory
losses.
 The workload was unbalanced. Some operators appeared overloaded
and others were waiting on product to process. Drivers were waiting on
product to label.
 The number of labels did not match the production sheet causing them
to question which was correct.
 The order of production caused extra dishes to be dirtied unnecessarily.
This Current-State Value Stream analysis not only identifies numerous con-
tributors to the lateness problem, but also many other sources of waste. The
foundation has now been set for considering improvement options. The first
step is to ponder the ideal state — what would be possible if all constraints
could be cast aside. Then define the future state and set the plan to achieve
the first increment of improvement.
Painting a Picture of the Future
The Current-State VSM is a snapshot in time — it’s where you are now. That’s
an important view, but it’s only part of the story. After you’ve characterized
the current state, it’s important to set your sights on the view of where you’re
going. In this section, you take the opportunities for improvement that you’ve
identified in your Current-State Value Stream analysis and turn them into a
design of the future.
In Lean, you consider two future views.
 The view of the utopian or ideal state: In a perfect world, with only value-
added steps, how could you best meet the customer’s requirements?
 The more-grounded future state that you can implement relatively
quickly with a focused plan: In the future state, you make incremental
improvements to the current state, eliminating waste and reducing the
non-value-added steps.
106
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Creating the Ideal-State Value Stream
Map: Where all is perfect in the world
If your process is in a state of ideal flow, you make one as the consumer takes
one. The process is in perfect balance. All activities are value-added. All
process steps take the same amount of time. There is no inventory in
process. All process steps produce perfectly, without defects. You have the
exact capacity needed for the consumption rate, with the precisely correct
number of staff, trained perfectly for the tasks.
Ponder this for a moment: the process where everything is exactly right.
Don’t ruin the thought with the realities of imperfection — that’s for the next
section. For now, picture utopia. See it all working perfectly.
Why define an Ideal-State VSM? Why spend legitimate business time and
effort considering something that you probably can’t have? The reason is
simple: Because you can have it. When you allow people to imagine cutting
the ties of the past and letting go of the constraints of the current environ-
ment, you raise the collective consciousness and enable teams to engage in
radical thinking that often identifies breakthrough opportunities. You simply
can’t soar when your feet are nailed to the floor.
Frequently, the Ideal-State Value Stream Mapping exercise results in dramatic
gains. The power of imagination is unbounded. When unbridled, ideas flow
freely and great things emerge. The Ideal-State VSM produces the options for
the next step: the future state.
Stepping closer to perfection: The 
Future-State Value Stream Map
Now it’s time to take all the mapping efforts, the analyses, and the ideal-state
visions and marry them to define the future state. The improvements that you
select now become the foundation for your planning activities. The Future-State
Value Stream Map is your next increment of performance improvement.
Pacemakers, supermarkets, and heijunka, oh my!
Before you can envision the Future-State VSM, you need to understand several
Lean principles and concepts. Chapter 2 addresses the principles of Lean.
Chapter 3 addresses the concepts of value added, non-value added, flow, and
107
Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

the 3M’s (muda, mura and muri). Here is where you put those principles and
concepts into action, as well as some of the following new ones:
 Pacemaker operation: The pacemaker operation sets the pace for the
rest of the value stream. It’s the one and only operation that receives the
production schedule. The pacemaker produces to the takt time and sets
the pace for the upstream operations to produce only enough to replen-
ish what the pacemaker operation has consumed. Downstream of the
pacemaker operation, the process must produce in a continuous flow
(unless a storage area, known as a supermarket — see later in this 
chapter — is required for finished goods). Multiples of pacemaker pro-
duction fit the quantity shipped to the customer. For example, if the
shipping quantity to the customer is 60 per container, then you may
release 20 at a time to the pacemaker operation.
 Bottleneck process: The bottleneck process is the process with the
longest cycle time.
 Work modules: Work modules are aggregated operations fit into a compact
area, in order to facilitate continuous flow, and single-piece production.
Work modules are capable of performing all, or most, of the operations
required for the value stream to deliver its product or service. This is
wholly different from a traditional departmental organization.
 Supermarkets: Supermarkets are stores of in-process inventory used
where the process cannot produce a continuous flow. Examples of
supermarkets include when one operation services many value streams,
when suppliers are too far away, or when processes are unstable, have
long lead times, or have out-of-balance cycle times. The supplying opera-
tion controls the supermarket and its inventory. Supermarket inventory
is tightly controlled.
 Standardized work: Standardized work is the description of the work
being performed, and it includes the takt time, specific sequence or
activities and defined work-in-process inventory. It’s the standard to
which the actual process is compared, and it represents the foundation
on which to improve.
 Kanban: Kanban are the signals to move and produce. In a pull system,
where material or work is “pulled through” a process by demand, kanban
is instruction that declares that a withdrawal has been made, so you can
produce more. The signal can come in many forms: an empty container,
a card, a ball — it takes whatever form best tells the supplying operation
to produce. Kanban identifies a standard production quantity.
 Heijunka: Heijunka, also known as workload leveling or production smooth-
ing, is the practice of smoothing out the volume and mix of the schedule
for what’s to be produced. The goal of heijunka is to level work schedules
108
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

to the point where there is little variation on a daily basis. Heijunka makes
continuous flow, pull signals, and inventory minimization possible.
 Pitch: Pitch is the amount of time required to make a standard container
of finished product. If the standard container is 60 pieces and the takt
time is 45 seconds, the pitch is 45 minutes.
Marking up the Current-State VSM
The Future-State VSM begins as a markup of the Current-State VSM. Don’t
start with a clean sheet of paper; make changes directly on the Current-State
Map. Identify where and what type of improvements you intend to make.
Based on the team’s evaluations and observations, indicate what changes will
address the issues. The markup technique is to indicate the changes in a sun-
burst icon called a Kaizen burst.
Marking all of the areas you want to change doesn’t imply that you’ll neces-
sarily make all the changes at the same time, but it defines an endpoint to
this particular improvement phase. With this picture, you can predict the
type and extent of improvement you anticipate from the implementation. By
identifying such things as how much NVA time will be reduced, and how much
key process times are reduced, you can quantify the improvement goals.
In the salad company example, the team marks up their Current-State VSM
with numerous ideas for improvement as a result of their observations and
ideal-state brainstorming. Figure 5-2 shows the areas where the team would
like to improve. They start with a 5S activity to clean up and organize the
work area. In particular, they identify standard containers and scoops for the
ingredients, and improved visual controls in the area. Because they observed
that not all team members understood the work standard for the salad line,
they review the process and establish formal, written standards. Because the
salad-preparation work was not complete, they evaluate ways to eliminate
NVA time and implement pull signals between assembly and preparation.
Eventually, the team also wants to improve the inventory management in the
value stream. In addition, they want to involve their suppliers in identifying
ways to receive more-frequent deliveries and better stock rotation.
Gazing into the crystal ball: Seeing the 
Future-State Value Stream Map
As soon as you’ve identified the candidate changes, create a new picture:
your Future-State VSM draft — the picture of what the value stream will look
like after implementing the improvements. Begin with the Current-State VSM
and implement the proposed changes. Leave the Kaizen bursts in place for
reference.

Also ask yourself a set of qualifying questions. (See the “Pacemakers, super-
markets, and heijunka, oh my!” section, earlier in this chapter to clarify any of
these questions.) Indicate the answers on the future-state VSM draft, either
directly or through the selection of the correct icons for kanban.
 What is the takt time (confirming it hasn’t changed from the current state)?
 Where is the bottleneck operation?
 Where can continuous flow happen?
 Where can work cells be implemented?
 Which is the pacemaker operation?
 What process will be scheduled ?
 Where will you use kanban signals ?
 Where do supermarkets need to be located?
 What is the right lot size between processes?
 What is the standard shipping quantity for the customer?
 What is the pitch?
 What are the current setup times?
 How can schedules be smoothed at the pacemaker operation?
 How much time, of the available hours, is being used for production and
how much is left over for changeovers?
After you’ve answered these questions and indicated the changes on the
Future-State VSM draft, you can analyze the map and predict what the future-
state process should look like. If you’re using a software program, the lead
time along the bottom will update as you change the information for the step
in the value stream.
Figure 5-3 shows the Future-State VSM draft for the salad company. Note the
changes. The company will first establish standards and improve the sched-
uling for the preparation operations by implementing a supermarket and
preparing for replenishment. By establishing standards and eliminating the
push inventory, the company sees significant reductions in lead time. They
move the labeling operation into the assembly process. They use universal
UPC codes to eliminate the label by store sorting.
As with the Current-State VSM analysis, don’t get stuck analyzing the poten-
tial changes for your Future-State VSM. Lean is an iterative process. Identify
what you want to improve, then improve it, and repeat the cycle. The Future-
State VSM is a snapshot of where you want to go. Make the picture and move
to Kaizen (Chapter 6).

Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps
Answering real questions about 
Value Stream Maps
Value Stream Mapping is uniquely related to
Lean. You typically don’t encounter VSMs out-
side of Lean practice. If you’re new to Lean,
you’ll naturally have questions. In the following
list, we answer some frequently asked questions:
 What makes a VSM so useful, as opposed
to standard process-flow diagrams? A
process-flow diagram is a valuable tool for
identifying resources and interfaces, but
that’s only part of the picture. A Value
Stream Map is a more complete process
flow — and it’s customer-centric. The Value
Stream Map, in one place, shows not only
how material flows through the value stream,
but also the information flow, takt time, bot-
tleneck operations, operator location, size
and type of inventories, modes of trans-
portation, as well as the relationship of cus-
tomers and suppliers along the whole value
stream. The value stream is much more com-
prehensive than a process flow diagram.
 Why create an Ideal-State Value Stream
Map? Creating an Ideal-State VSM encour-
ages you to think outside the box, looking at
the value stream with an objective view-
point to identify breakthrough ideas. It
opens up your mind to the possibility of dra-
matic innovation, sometimes referred to 
as Kaikaku. Although the main focus of
Lean is in making regular, small, incremen-
tal improvements, if you never take the time
to contemplate or dream of a radically dif-
ferent state, you’ll be missing an opportu-
nity for truly innovative improvement.
 Where is the best place to start with Value
Stream Mapping? As always, start with
your customer. If your customer is not 
the end consumer, you still start with your
customer — but keep in mind how your
processes are affected by the consumer.
After you’ve identified the customer’s
requirements, work your way upstream.
 What is the “right” level of detail? There is
no single “right” level of detail — it depends
on your context and condition. The right
level of detail is a balance between defin-
ing enough detail to find and eliminate
meaningful amounts of waste and not
having so much detail that you bog down
and never move to the improvement phase.
Value Stream Mapping is an iterative proc-
ess, so with each pass through, you can
add more detail as necessary.
 What is the difference between the macro
(or high-level) view of the value stream and
the Value Stream Map? The macro-level
view is a diagram that shows you where
your process fits in the overall value stream
relative to the consumer and the first sup-
plier of the rawest of raw materials. If you
were to try to construct a VSM on a detailed
level of the entire VSM, it would be
unwieldy and you would never get to the
improvement phase. With the simple macro
diagram, you gain perspective.
 Which is better: creating a manual VSM or
using a software package to create the
VSM? Some experts would say that manual
drawings are preferred, because they’re
simple, quick, and more visual for a team of
people constructing the map. The tech-
savvy people point to the transportability,
versioning, attributing, and consistency of a
software package. Although it takes some
time to learn the software tools, they’re
easy to use and far better in the long run.

Creating the Mosaic of Continuous
Improvement: Setting the 
Stage for Kaizen
Value Stream Mapping is part of a cycle and philosophy of continuous improve-
ment. It may sound like it’s a big effort — creating a Current-State Map, then an
Ideal-State Map, then a Future-State Map draft, and finally a Future-State Map
that you can actually implement. You may feel like you need to command sig-
nificant resources to bring a team together, analyze all the data, brainstorm all
the ideas, and involve all the different perspectives. You may be thinking you’re
developing a new career in cartography with all these maps! But the role and
purpose of Value Stream Mapping is not about conducting huge efforts, big pro-
jects, and long implementation programs. Value Stream Mapping is a concise
effort, performed in a short time-span of just a few days.
Looking toward the annual horizon
Take the improvements that you identified on the future-state VSM, and
establish implementation priorities and a plan. The plan should be concise —
just a few pages, no frills — a brief look at the year ahead. Scope individual
improvement activities to days, weeks, or months, depending on the com-
plexity of the activity. The plan should be a list of the projects that you will
complete, with timing and responsibilities clearly defined.

Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 
Warning: Creating a Value Stream Map
from behind the computer does carry with
it one risk: You tend to map from the office
and miss the opportunity to get out and walk
the flow, observe the work first-hand, and
interface with the people involved in the
value stream. The most important thing is
not the tool you use to create the map, it’s
the map! The only way to make an accurate
map is to walk the streets.
 How do I VSM the same product made in
different places? Start at one location and
carry the knowledge to other facilities. As
you form the team, include members from
the other locations. When you go to gemba
(where work physically is done.), include
the other facilities to observe what variation
exists in the process. Both of these steps
will prevent the “not invented here” syn-
drome when you spread the knowledge
across the organization. You’re also more
likely to create a blend of best-practice
ideas to implement.
(continued)

To maintain the proper scope and focus of your future-state plans:
 Address a minimum number of key metrics for improvement. Don’t try
to solve all the problems at once.
 Prioritize changes that are most meaningful to the customer.
 Make the project just large enough to be meaningful and measurable.
 Remember that you’re going to be doing it again!
How often should you revisit the Future-State Value Stream Map? Revisit your
Future-State Value Stream Map at least every six months, and revisit your
Ideal-State Value Stream Map annually. You don’t have to go through the entire
Current-State–Ideal-State–Future-State Map exercise each time you make a
change to the current state. The emphasis is on the improvement, not the
mapping exercise. If you have completed all your planned improvements
before six months, then create a new future state VSM.
Some organizations have multiple continuous-improvement initiatives, such
as Lean and Six Sigma, occurring at the same time. Include your Lean activi-
ties in your annual plan under a continuous-improvement banner.
Future-State implementations
After you have the maps and the plan, you’re ready to implement. In Chapter 6,
we show you how to implement Lean projects. At this juncture, you may be
wondering, “What happens to the maps as I make improvements?”
 Update the Current-State VSM to reflect the new state as you make
improvements. Not everyone does this, but it’s good configuration-
management practice. It’s like updating the current state to a new stan-
dard. It also gives you a record of where you are on the way to your 
goal. Keep a copy of your first Current-State VSM. Two or three years
from now, you won’t believe how much change you’ve made. The old
maps are also good to have on hand so you can remind people just how
far you’ve come.
 Compare the new current state to the predictions on the Future-State
VSM. If you aren’t on track, you may need to adjust your plan.
 After all the ideas have been exhausted or you’re at the end of a plan-
ning period, start the mapping process again. Use the latest Current-
State VSM, and move through the exercise of creating a new Ideal-State
VSM and building the Future-State VSM.

Chapter 5: Charting the Course: Using Value Stream Maps

As you execute the improvement plan, align the right tools with the improve-
ments you intend to make. The Lean toolbox has many tools (see Part III).
However, some of your improvements may be better suited using Six Sigma
or other methodologies. Pick the right tool for the job.

R
ecognize that a Value Stream Map (VSM) is just that: a map. A VSM of
the current state reveals what needs to be improved; a VSM of the ideal
state shows you what paradise looks like. But a VSM does not tell you how to
improve. If you were to take a trip, you would pack your map, but the map
alone won’t get you out of your driveway. You need to know the hows of the
journey: modes of transportation, routes, timing, number of travelers, avail-
able resources, and so on. Kaizen is the how. Kaizen is the way you improve
the value stream; it’s practiced through a continuing series of workshops and
projects.
Have you ever traveled so much that you’re just as comfortable on the road
as you are being at home? Experienced travelers reach a point where taking a
trip is no big deal. They don’t have to think about what they’re going to pack,
which bag they’re going to take, how to make travel arrangements, or any
other details. Traveling becomes second nature to them. As you travel down
the road of Lean, a similar thing happens: The change is no longer a special
event, but rather the very way you conduct yourself and your business. You
begin to address problems continuously and to act in a Lean manner. You
begin to behave in a Lean way. Kaizen is this way of life.
In this chapter, we tell you what Kaizen is, how to practice Kaizen in your
own organization, and how to conduct Kaizen workshops and projects.

Kaizen: A Way of Life
Kaizen comes from two Japanese characters: kai, meaning “change,” and zen,
meaning “to see, or to gain wisdom from doing.” Combined, these two charac-
ters mean “change for the better or continuous improvement.”
The goal of Kaizen is to eliminate waste in the value stream. You accomplish
that through performing just-in-time delivery, leveling production, achieving
standardized work, pacing (takt time) of moving lines, right-sizing of equip-
ment, reducing inventory and work-in-process, and more. The reason you do
Kaizen is to improve quality and safety and to reduce cost.
Although Kaizen has typically been practiced in the West more simply as 
an improvement workshop or event, true Kaizen is a way of life. It governs
everyday thinking and business. Kaizen is a regular, daily activity that consid-
ers the process as well as the results. It examines the big picture and takes in
the whole of the environment, as well as the immediate issue at hand.
Kaizen respects people first. Equipment, facilities, processes, and technology
are tools — and they’re subordinate to people. Kaizen focuses on humanizing
the workplace and eliminating hard — both mental and physical — work. It
never blames or judges people for the mistakes of the past, because blaming
is wasteful.
Kaizen involves everyone, at all levels, and is not relegated to an isolated
function or specialty. Although the framework for Kaizen is usually struc-
tured at the individual or group level, everyone — from the CEO to the last
office worker or factory worker — practices Kaizen.
Kaizen: The philosophy
Kaizen is a philosophy of improvement that encourages continuous, incre-
mental changes in life across all aspects — personal, social, work, home,
play. Kaizen means not letting a day pass without some form of improvement.
Western philosophy might be summarized as “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” By
contrast, Kaizen says that even if it isn’t broken, it can — and must be —
improved. Do it better and make it better. The alternative is stagnation and
decline.
As a work philosophy, Kaizen is continual, incremental change in all areas —
large and small, internal and external — that improves the whole organiza-
tion. Business Kaizen considers the entire system of the business; improve-
ment activities at all levels are conducted with a systems view. The business
philosophy of Kaizen also calls for an unending effort for improvement that
involves everyone in the organization — managers and workers alike.
118
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

The philosophy of Kaizen in business concentrates on the processes that
influence the outcomes — cause and effect. The Kaizen philosophy also sees
the business through two lenses: setting new standards and maintaining
existing standards. More specifically:
 Kaizen maintenance establishes the policies and rules that help main-
tain the performance levels set by the present managerial and operating
standards.
 Kaizen improvement focuses efforts on the continuous improvement of
existing standards and processes or the innovation of new ones.
Kaizen has been attributed as the basis for the many successes of the
Japanese in global automotive, electronics, and other business and consumer
markets. In Japan, Kaizen is the overarching strategy for business. Everyone
is encouraged to make regular suggestions for improvements. In companies
like Toyota and Canon, 100 suggestions per employee per year are defined,
written, shared, and implemented. That’s two per person per week! And these
suggestions aren’t limited to anyone’s specific work area. Kaizen is based on
making changes anywhere that they might lead to business improvement.
Kaizen in action
Kaizen requires involvement of everyone — from the CEO to the last office or
factory worker. But everyone’s role is not the same. At each level of manage-
ment, the roles and responsibilities of Kaizen are different:
 Senior management is responsible for defining the Kaizen organiza-
tion, setting goals, and creating the culture in which Kaizen can thrive.
Wherever Kaizen requires investment and innovation, senior manage-
ment’s role is to provide the resources required for implementation.
 Middle management is required to ensure that the employees have
the skills, materials, and tools to perform Kaizen. They ensure that
Kaizen is occurring across functions in the organization and achieving
the goals. They also implement Kaizen.
 Supervisors make sure that Kaizen is occurring on both an individual
and a workgroup level. Supervisors also ensure that the standard operat-
ing procedures and practices are being followed. Supervisors train
employees and foster morale. They provide their own Kaizen suggestions.
In addition, all members of management must practice Kaizen themselves.
They show leadership by doing.
In the following sections, we present the Lean definition of waste, introduce
the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle used in Kaizen, and review the foundations of
Kaizen implementation.
119
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

Eliminating waste
Kaizen focuses you on eliminating waste in the value stream. When you
examine the value stream in small increments, you see waste that you may
not have seen before. Through the lens of Kaizen glasses, you suddenly see
the extra movement, the work that can be done more efficiently, or the effort
that doesn’t truly transform the product or service.
This waste may be the result of people and systems that are not performing to
the established standards and practices, or you may need to define improved
standards and practices. In either case, when you eliminate this waste, you
improve not only the value stream, but also the conditions for the people who
work in it.
Examine your value stream for waste, or muda, created in these seven areas:
 Transportation: Is there unnecessary (non-value-added) movement of
parts, materials, or information between processes?
 Waiting: Are people, parts, systems, or facilities idly waiting for a work
cycle to be completed?
 Overproduction: Are you producing sooner, faster, or in greater quanti-
ties than the customer is demanding?
 Defects: Does the process result in anything that the customer would
deem unacceptable?
 Inventory: Do you have any raw materials, Work-In-Process (WIP), or fin-
ished goods that are not having value added to them?
 Movement: How much do you move materials, people, equipment, and
goods within a processing step?
 Extra Processing: How much extra work is performed beyond the stan-
dard required by the customer?
In addition to these seven “classic” areas of waste, Lean Master Shigeo
Shingo defined an eighth form of waste: the underutilization of people. While
waiting is part of the underutilization, the eighth waste is more about not
allowing your people to contribute fully their talents, ideas and energy to
their work environment. When you don’t capitalize on your human capital,
you are missing out on a lot of opportunities for improvement. How can you
better engage your people in continuous improvement?
Examine each of these forms of muda from the basis of existing operating
standards and practices. Are the standards defined? Are they followed? If 
not, Kaizen compels you to implement training and support in order to per-
form to established standards. If waste is occurring in these areas, despite
performance to standards, Kaizen requires you to define and implement
improvements.
120
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Using the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle
The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is the Lean operating framework — the
methodology for implementing Kaizen.
The PDCA cycle was first developed in the 1930s by Walter Shewhart, the Bell
Telephone physicist often call the father of statistical quality control. PDCA
was brought to Japan in the 1950s by W. Edwards Deming; in Japan, it’s known
as the Deming cycle. Alternatively, it is referred to as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
Here’s what the four parts of the PDCA (or PDSA) acronym mean:
 Plan: Create a plan for change, identifying specifically what you want to
change. Define the steps you need to make the change, and predict the
results of the change.
 Do: Carry out the plan in a trial or test environment, on a small scale,
under controlled conditions.
 Check or study: Examine the results of your trial. Verify that you’ve
improved the process. If you have, consider implementing it on a
broader scale; if you haven’t, go back and try again.
 Act: Implement the changes you’ve verified on a broader scale. Update
the standard operating procedures.
Standardizing work
Kaizen requires you to have standards — standard specifications, standard
processes, standard systems, standard procedures, standard work instruc-
tions, and so on. All work should be measured and performed to standards.
After you implement any improvement, you must standardize to perform con-
sistently to this improved state.
But what if you don’t have standards in place to begin with? Because Kaizen
requires standards, where do you start? The answer is Standardize-Do-Check-
Act (SDCA). A variation on the PDCA cycle (see the preceding section) is
SDCA, where the S stands for standardize.
Use the SDCA cycle whenever you need to establish initial standards and sta-
bility within a process. After you’ve reached the first threshold of standard-
ization, you can apply the PDCA cycle. Standardization occurs in all aspects
of the process — man, machine, methods, systems, materials, measurement,
and environment.
Innovating with Kaikaku
Kaizen is generally considered to be steady, incremental change. But what if
there is a need for fundamental change, dramatic improvements, or a new
121
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

system? When more radical change or innovation is required, Kaizen takes a
different form, called Kaikaku, or “radical change.” (Kaikaku is also some-
times known as breakthrough Kaizen, flow Kaizen, or system Kaizen).
Kaikaku innovation still uses the PDCA/SDCA methodology, but to solve
bigger problems. Other, more sophisticated or new methods are also appro-
priate. Seek inspiration from other applications, environments, or industries,
and use new technologies or apply the results of new discoveries.
Here’s an example: Milk runs for inbound product pickup are commonplace
today; the materials are picked up on a regular schedule and routed from
multiple suppliers by a single truck. When milk runs were first introduced,
though, they were a radical departure from the commonplace method of
receiving product shipments. The inspiration for milk runs came from the
food industry; the innovation was developed by the manufacturing industry.
The change was not implemented overnight; small-scale implementations
were expanded to form a new business standard.
Improving the Value Stream with Kaizen
Kaizen improves the value stream by applying the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)
cycle in the form of Lean projects. You’ll find improvement opportunities
across the entire value stream, but you prioritize and select projects based
on their impact to customer value. The goal is to make regular, steady, incre-
mental improvements, as opposed to large, breakthrough changes.
A common problem in Kaizen is oversized projects. Either you’ve selected
too large a project, or you’ve allowed the project scope to creep up to an
unmanageable size. To avoid oversized projects, focus on eliminating a single
form of waste at a time, rather than multiple forms or all seven forms (see
“Eliminating waste,” earlier in this chapter) at the same time. Don’t try to fix
the entire value stream in a few projects.
Selecting projects
Kaizen projects can be performed at three different levels: the individual
level, the team level, and the management level. You can perform a Lean pro-
ject as part of routine daily business, as part of an improvement initiative, or
as part of a formal workshop. The overall scope of the project depends on
the size and type of waste you’re targeting for reduction.
Select your projects based on a combination of several factors. Begin by ana-
lyzing the VSM and selecting the biggest contributing problem areas. Then,
employ both qualitative and quantitative measures to seek out the data that
highlights the key issues, particularly through direct customer feedback.
122
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Finally, use your experience to target the waste areas for improvement. Initial
projects should be ones that will be highly visible to the customer and will
make a significant impact on the business; these characteristics will create
momentum for a Lean transformation.
Many Lean companies also have a suggestion program for identifying pro-
jects. In Japanese companies, these can be prolific sources of project ideas.
The ideas can come from anywhere, but usually they begin from within local
areas or workgroups.
Lean projects are mostly focused on eliminating one or more of the seven
forms of waste (TWO DIME), or muda, mura, and muri (see “Eliminating
waste,” earlier in this chapter).
Take before and after photos of the physical aspects of the problem you’re
addressing. These photos will give you an objective visual record of the
improvement and help you to realize how far you’ve come.
Project methodology
Lean projects follow the simple but specific framework of the PDCA cycle.
The level of depth, as well as measurements, analyses, and controls may
vary, but the foundational methodology is the same. After you’ve defined the
project scope, begin the project cycle.
Within the Kaizen methodology, one critical rule is that you must go to 
gemba — the Japanese word that means “where all activities are taking place.”
According to Kaizen Master Masaaki Imai, gemba is where customer value is
added in the value stream. Gemba is the most important place for manage-
ment. Imai urges all managers to go to gemba.
The Plan Phase
During the Plan Phase, you objectively describe the change you want to make
in order to address the problem identified by the selection process. Include
the following:
 An identification of what processes you intend to change
 The steps needed to make the change in both the prototype/test and
production operation environments
 A prediction of the results of the change
Use the same quality data and analysis tools to support the plan development.
What to expect: The project individual or group evaluate the situation using
the data, as well as personal — and sometimes, physical — evaluations. They
determine the changes that they intend to make, the steps needed to make
123
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

those changes, and the measurements they’ll take to confirm the proper
effects of the change. They predict performance targets and create an action
plan that includes the definition of who makes the change, what is to be
done, and when it will occur. They identify the required resources. Normally,
the individual or project group will make the changes themselves, but some-
times outside resources are required. If a physical layout or a work area will
be changed, then before and after layouts are constructed during the Plan
Phase.
The Do Phase
The Do Phase is simply an implementation of the plan in a trial or prototype
environment — on a small scale and under controlled conditions.
What to expect: Select a proper test or prototype environment. It should be
small enough that you can conduct the test quickly, but large enough that the
outcomes are statistically significant and representative. Be sure to identify
the differences between the test and target environments so that you can
properly extrapolate the results.
The Check or Study Phase
In this phase, you’re examining the results of your trial or prototype. Quantify
the degree to which the changes you made improved the trial process, and
predict the extrapolation of these results to the greater process.
What to expect: The project individual or group reviews the trial data and
determines whether the change is a valid improvement — using statistical
methods if possible. If the trial objectives were met, then the project proceeds
to the Act Phase. However, if the improvement was not sufficient, you may
determine that the trial must be rerun, or may need to return to the Plan
Phase. Because Kaizen calls for small, incremental improvements, you often
decide to proceed, and afterwards enter the cycle again. If the trial failed out-
right, the project returns to the beginning for failure analysis and new planning.
The Act Phase
In this last phase, you implement the changes on the full scale of the process.
Update the standards and specifications, and verify performance. Report the
results.
What to expect: The project individual or group implements changes to all
affected process people, systems, and technologies. They update all standard
documents and procedures, including work instructions and visual controls,
to reflect the change. Monitor the changes to ensure that the expected out-
come is real and as expected. Finally, conclude with a final report or presen-
tation to affected stakeholders and management.
124
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Individual projects
Kaizen philosophy empowers every employee to improve her work area, 
as well as suggest improvements in any other work area. With such grand
empowerment comes the rightful expectation that every employee will also
participate in the improvement of those work areas. In a Kaizen environment,
employees implement the ideas.
Kaizen calls for small, incremental improvements to the value stream. Kaizen
at the individual level is often related to improvements in an individual’s
work area, or in how the individual performs her work. These changes are
normally very low-investment ones that the individual implements herself on
a regular basis.
Think MacGyver. He was that character on a U.S. TV program by the same
name in the 1980s. With a piece of dental floss, a chunk of wood and a wad of
gum, he could always create something to escape from the tight spot he man-
aged to find himself in on every episode. At the individual level, Kaizen is
done the same way.
Even at the individual level, the project follows the same PDCA cycle, using
the same measurement and analysis tools. Individual projects are usually
focused on the direct work area and responsibilities of the individual. The
duration of individual projects is shorter than the duration of group projects;
individual projects are often completed in a matter of days. If the job being
studied does not occur on a daily basis or is highly complex, then the dura-
tion may be longer.
Although Lean is a disciplined system, it’s also a creative system. Kaizen sets
the stage for creativity to shine through. Kaizen enhancements can be as
simple as creating a fixture from a piece of wood to perform an operation,
outlining the shape of your tools on a tool board so you can see that all of the
tools are present, or adding a guide to more quickly align and staple a stack
of papers.
Group projects
Kaizen projects performed at the self-directed group level are also known by
the Japanese term jishuken. They follow the PDCA cycle, but the scope is typ-
ically much larger than the scope of projects performed at the individual
level. Group projects may last weeks or even months. Observing the process,
collecting the data, identifying the form of waste, defining and implementing
the improvements, measuring the results, and standardizing the new work —
it all takes time.
125
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

Management projects
Management projects usually address strategic issues, administrative
processes, cross-functional problems, or support systems. They tend to 
be technical and complex in nature. Their aims are to:
 Reduce bureaucracy within the organization and its systems.
 Ensure that the measurement and business systems support a Lean
enterprise.
 Ensure that requisite facility improvements are in place.
Management projects are commonly conducted by task forces and cross-
functional teams. They usually require a higher technical or engineering
expertise. These projects follow the PDCA cycle but may use more advanced
statistical methods and simulations.
Work team projects
A work team that dedicates part of its normal working time to Kaizen can
tackle a Lean project. A work team project involves and affects the whole
team, not just an individual. Work team projects are usually self-directed,
with the manager or supervisor advising team, instead of leading the project.
Work-team project meetings follow the principle of standardized work:
 They have a timed agenda.
 The team uses tracking documents.
 Before and after pictures and charts track the team’s progress.
 The team meets in an assigned area near the work space, not in a confer-
ence room!
 In the assigned meeting area, the team displays key data that it uses for
its problem-solving and improvement efforts.
Although the work-team projects are usually larger and more involved, they
still follow the small, incremental, low-investment model that the individual
projects follow.
One of the challenges to work-team projects is that they can lose momentum
and the team can become demotivated over time. The supervisor’s job is to
set goals for improvement, keep the team on track, and celebrate the wins.
Management’s role is to keep the supervisors on track.
126
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

Kaizen: The Workshop
One of the ways to quickly improve the value stream is through the use of the
Kaizen workshop. Also known as a Kaizen event or a Kaizen blitz, the Kaizen
workshop is a fast and furious run through the PDCA cycle, typically in five
days or less. During the Kaizen workshop, the project team directly targets a
specific area to find the muda, and remove the waste from the value stream.
The source may be anything — quality, communications, changeover time,
organization, and so on — but the workshop process you follow and your end
goals are the same.
In order to focus properly on the workshop, the project team halts its 
normal work completely and does not produce its normal product or service.
Advanced planning is required to ensure that your customers, as well as
other areas of the business, are not adversely affected while the improve-
ments are being discovered and implemented. Kaizen-workshop solutions are
famous for requiring minimal investment and yielding great benefits to the
value stream.
Most people think of a production or manufacturing area when they think of a
Kaizen workshop, but remember that Kaizen is for everyone in every area of
the business. The Wiremold Company, which has long been held as a pinna-
cle of Lean success, understood that every area benefits from Kaizen. They
even held a Kaizen event on the trunks of their salespeople’s cars!
Planning the Kaizen workshop
A successful Kaizen workshop requires the right project scope, with the right
team, working full-time together for three to five days. To pull this off requires
planning. In this section we will tell you how to scope a Kaizen project, select
the right team and follow the workshop agenda.
Kaizen workshops interrupt operations for a few days. With proper planning
this doesn’t have to be a problem. Depending on the current situation, inven-
tory may exist to cover the days that the area will not be producing. If the
inventory does not exist, coordination within the organization must occur to
protect the customer deliveries.
Workshop scope
In most cases the team starts with the Current-State VSM already completed.
The successful workshop has a clear focus and baseline metrics established
127
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

before it begins. These, along with customer satisfaction, quality, and opera-
tional data, help decide where to focus the Kaizen efforts. If the area has
never experienced a Kaizen workshop, focus first on 5S (see Chapter 8).
The initial Kaizen workshops ought to be conducted where the work occurs
and be scoped to have a significant impact. The best Kaizen workshops are
those that solve a nagging issue (especially one directly related to the cus-
tomer) or otherwise accomplish something believed to be impossible (such
as reducing machine setup time from days to minutes).
Make sure you take several before photos of the area being improved, even
office areas. Those photos are a great way to show how far the Kaizen jour-
ney takes you — like vacation photos!
Workshop project team
The Kaizen-workshop project team is cross-functional, consisting of members
of senior management, the value-stream owner, people who work in the area,
representatives from support functions, and usually even a few people from
elsewhere in the company who are unrelated to the area.
You may wonder why a Kaizen workgroup contains people from unrelated
areas. Isn’t it a waste of their time? The answer is a resounding “no!” The role
of the unrelated team member is to ask the innocent and objective questions
that make the team think in new ways. The outsider provides valuable experi-
ence and perspective to those who might wonder what’s happening else-
where in the business.
Companies that have been very successful implementing Lean have had mem-
bers of the leadership team, if not the CEOs themselves, conduct the initial
Kaizen workshops. Leadership must take a very active role in the Kaizen
process, demonstrating the support and commitment for the transformation,
as well as creating relationships with employees whom they might not other-
wise meet. At the same time, it’s critical for leadership to “authorize” change —
not dictate change. Leadership does not have all the answers; their role is to
“lead.” The people who make the product or provide the service are those clos-
est to knowing what has to be done to eliminate waste. Leadership’s job is to
empower the employees and support change.
Including people on the Kaizen-workshop team from unrelated support func-
tions will give the team a set of fresh eyes. It also gives the team a greater
understanding of the business and how their contribution affects other areas.
The Kaizen workshop usually lasts from three to five days, depending on the
experience level of the team and the number of hours per day that the work-
shop lasts. If there are multiple shifts, the Kaizen should not only include rep-
resentation from all shifts, but also occur during part of each shift. Although
128
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

standards are in place, depending on how disciplined the organization is, you
usually find that different shifts do different things.

The agenda for the Kaizen workshop is prescriptive and deliberate. Table 6-1

Conducting the Kaizen workshop
After you have your plan in place, it’s time to rock and roll. The team mem-
bers work hard during the workshop, doing work that is not normally in their
job descriptions and making a lot of improvements to the value stream in a
short amount of time. In this section we tell you what to activities to expect
and remind you to celebrate your successes.
Workshop activities
Have you ever watched one of those home-improvement makeover shows,
where the homeowners, with the help of a design team, remodel a room in a
house over a weekend? Or an organization show, where they take a few junk-
laden rooms in a house and make the owners get rid of 90 percent of the con-
tents? Whether they realize it or not, these shows are doing Kaizen events in
these people’s homes. They’re implementing 5S (sort, straighten, scrub, sys-
tematize, and standardize). They work long hours in a short time and, at the
end of the show, there is a complete and amazing transformation.
Usually, the designer or show host asks the homeowner, “What is not working
with this space?” Then they create a plan to address these issues. In this
case, the homeowner is the customer. In the case of a work scenario, you
130
Part II: Understanding Flow and the Value Stream 

have customer data that answers the “What’s not working in this space?”
question. It could be related to poor performance or, better yet, it could be
related to new business. No matter what the focus, you as a team member
will roll up your sleeves, get your hands dirty, work long hours, and do work
that is dramatically different from your daily activities!
If the aim of the workshop is to free up floor space, then you’ll be cleaning
out the unnecessary items, like inventory, tools, boxes, and things that just
don’t have a real home in the area. The team creates a new process flow and
rearranges the equipment as needed. Then the floor space is cordoned off to
protect it.
Oftentimes multiple Kaizen workshops will create pockets of space, but not
necessarily usable space. You need an overall plan for the facility to coordi-
nate floor-space-clearing Kaizen workshops.
An automotive facility received new work into an already full plant. Through
the implementation of multiple, coordinated workshops, it was able to create
usable space. Over a six-week period, the customer was not impacted at all,
yet 39 work areas were transformed over six weeks to create 60,000 square
feet of usable space. All the teams participating in the Kaizen knew that free
space needed to be created and why it needed to occur. The coordination
among the teams working toward a common goal was the key to the success.
If the workshop is related to equipment downtime, then the team will usually
clean the equipment. If it’s appropriate, the team may paint the equipment 
a light color. If, for example, the team is working on a stamping press; the 
new paint provides a clean surface for all to see leaks or other issues. They
use maintenance data and history to investigate the issues. They may exam-
ine spare parts availability and inventory. They establish a new preventive-
maintenance standard. By the end of the workshop, a transformation will
occur.
Celebrate the win!
By the end of the workshop, the area will be transformed and the team will be
highly motivated. During the span of a few days, many changes will be incor-
porated, although there are usually a few items that remain open. The follow-
up plan will enable the team to ensure that all the items are closed. All open
items should be closed within 30 days of the workshop.
If the Kaizen is part of a coordinated effort, like in the automotive example,
then not only celebrate the success of each step taken, but also celebrate
with everyone when the collective goal has been achieved.
131
Chapter 6: Flowing in the Right Direction: Lean Projects and Kaizen

Sustaining the Kaizen-workshop gains
After the workshop is complete, one of the most important steps must occur:
changing the standards to include the changes. Frequently, teams omit this
vital step, causing the gains to be short lived and many of the benefits to be
lost. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the standards are being
followed. The employee is responsible for executing to the new standards.
This concept of shared responsibility should be built during the workshop.
If the workshop was aimed at clearing out floor space, then one technique to
consider is constructing a barrier around the new space. Put a sign in the
area communicating why the space was cleared out. Monitor the area to
make sure that “mysterious” items don’t suddenly appear to fill the space
again. If you aren’t diligent, the space will fill up again.
Establish weekly and monthly (7-day, 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day) verification
points to ensure that the changes are functioning in a regular daily environ-
ment as designed. Schedule reviews with management, particularly if you need
them to provide resources. When all of the items are complete, conduct a final
review session of what was accomplished and what results were achieved. Did
you achieve the goals and objectives laid out at the start of the Kaizen? This
communication is vital to securing management support for sustaining the
improvements, and garnering their commitment to do more Kaizen workshops.

Part III
The Lean Toolbox

In this part . . .
You develop the Lean lifestyle for your business with
tools that facilitate customer understanding, value,
flow, pull, perfection, and leadership. In this part, we tell
you about the tools in the Lean toolbox and how best to
apply them on your Lean journey.

Chapter 7
Customer and Value-Stream Tools
In This Chapter
 Looking at customer focused tools
 Using value-stream tools
 Working with basic process tools
N
o matter where you work or play, having the right tools for the job is
important. Imagine trying to play a round of golf with only a driver, or
scaling a mountain in flip-flops. You wouldn’t. To maximize your performance
and results, you would get the right “tools” for the job, whether that job is a
round of golf, a mountain trek, or a Lean transformation.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the tools that you can use to capture the
customer’s wants and needs, to evaluate the value stream, and to work with
basic data. Along with the flow and pull tools described in Chapter 8, the per-
fection tools in Chapter 9, and the management tools in Chapter 10, these
tools make up the overall Lean toolbox. You need all these tools to support
Lean practices.
Communing with the Customer
In any business, really understanding who your customer is and what your
customer is all about is vital — but this is particularly true for anyone
embarking on a Lean journey. The tools in this section help you capture the
voice of the customer, understand the customer’s wants versus needs, and
evaluate the competitive marketplace.
Capturing the voice of the customer
Not only do you need to know what the customer wants, but you have to
translate that information into language that the various parts of the organi-
zation can understand — and use. The house of quality, also commonly
referred to as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), is a key tool to make the
translation. This tool is a sophisticated product-planning matrix.

The house of quality is really more like a neighborhood of quality by the time
you’re finished with it! Each matrix defines the relationship between what
you’re trying to accomplish and how you’ll accomplish it. Figure 7-1 shows
the interrelationship of the houses of quality, outlined here:
 The first house translates the voice of the customer (VOC) into func-
tional requirements.
 The second house translates the functional requirements into product-
design requirements.
 The third house translates product-design requirements into process-
design requirements.
 The fourth house translates the process-design requirements into
process-control requirements.

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

You gather the VOC through various means, including customer surveys,
focus groups, personal interviews, product clinics, warranty data, or third-
party industry reports. Multifunctional teams work together to construct the
various houses. Having marketing involved in the fourth house is just as
important as having manufacturing involved in the first house — they keep
each other honest. It’s marketing’s job to make sure the customer’s voice
doesn’t get incorrectly translated into tech-speak, but it’s everyone’s job to
understand the customer and how everyone impacts customer satisfaction.
Inside the interior of the house are a series of matrices. Figure 7-2 shows the
interior floor plan of the house of quality. You construct from left to right.
The filled circle indicates the strongest relationship; the open circle, a moder-
ate relationship; and the triangle, a weak relationship.
Understanding customer satisfaction
Kano modeling is a way to differentiate the customer’s needs, wants, and
delighters. When you’re capturing the VOC, the customer may not explicitly
state all of their requirements. Kano modeling provides you with another way
of understanding your customer (see Chapter 3 for much more on Kano mod-
eling). Table 7-1 shows you an example of data for a Kano model.

Sizing up the competition
Benchmarking is the process you use to compare your products, processes,
or services usually against your direct competition. You can also compare
against the best in the world in a given segment or activity. You may not be a
retail store, but you can compare your customer service against the highly
touted Nordstrom department store — and you should!
Benchmarking steps
The first step in benchmarking is to identify what you’re evaluating (that is,
the key characteristics of the activity, product, or service). Then you make
your comparisons against your direct competition and the best in the world
for that particular characteristic. Based on those comparisons, you evaluate
how you perform, identify the gap, and then brainstorm ways to close that
gap. You might try to directly copy and incorporate your findings into your
process. You could create new ways to adapt their ideas to your system. Or
your team could innovate to try to surpass the market standard.
Benchmarking is not a one-time process. The market is always changing and
the competition is always on a quest to unseat the market leader.
Benchmarking in action
Nowhere is benchmarking more apparent than in the World Cup. Once every
four years, the world stops to watch the top countries vie for the title of best
of the best. Traditionally, Brazil has always been the one to beat; this soccer
behemoth has dominated the game for decades. Although they may not
always win, Brazil is always at the top of the list of the ones to watch.
In the two years prior to the finals, qualifying matches are played to narrow
the field. During that time, all the coaches — from small Caribbean islands to
the traditional powerhouses of Brazil, England, Germany, and Italy — are
138
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

benchmarking their play and adjusting their strategies in hopes of qualifying
their country’s team for the finals. Table 7-2 shows average key metrics, 
from a sampling of five matches that they use to evaluate their team’s 
performance.

The benchmarking process does not end here. The coach and his staff must do
something with the data to create change, improve skills, and modify strategy.
These are the general steps they would follow and repeat continuously:
139
Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

1. Establish target performance goals for their team.
2. Study the competition (match films, player positioning, or training
regimes).
3. Brainstorm ideas for improvement.
4. Create and implement a game plan.
5. Evaluate performance over a set period of time.
Their overall strategy would address the fundamentals of running and kick-
ing, how and where the bodies are positioned on the field, the array of play-
ers used, and which players occupy which positions. Their detailed game
plan might include drills to improve free kicks, training sessions at higher
altitudes or humidity levels to build up resistance for real game conditions,
or experimenting with different players in different roles. The benchmarking
process provides a foundation and direction for improvement.
When benchmarking the competition, you evaluate not only overall perfor-
mance, but also the performance of the parts. The automotive industry for
years has used teardown rooms. Within the room are a collection of the manu-
facturers’ vehicles alongside vehicles from the competition. Typically, an
entire vehicle is parked in front of tables full of disassembled components of
the same model. Representatives from various functional areas spend hours
evaluating the parts and the parts in context of the overall vehicle, in order
to plan their next iteration of product or gain ideas to solve ongoing product
issues. Teardown rooms are an effective strategy if your company is product
based.
Working with the Value Stream
The customer-related tools help you understand what your customer wants.
The value stream is how you provide goods and services to meet those
needs. Chapters 4 and 5 cover the key tool for analyzing the value stream —
Value Stream Mapping. The tools presented here are supplementary to the
Value Stream Map.
Quantifying the value stream
When you’re quantifying the value stream, three tools are beneficial. We
cover each in the following sections.
140
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Takt time
Takt time sets the pace for the value stream based on the customer demand.
Takt time is the total net daily operating time divided by the total daily cus-
tomer demand. (You can find out more about takt time in Chapter 4.)
Box scores
Lean box scores — like the box scores of professional baseball — summarize
and track performance to key metrics. Table 7-3 is an example of a box score.
(We discuss box scores in greater detail in Chapter 4.)

Lead time
Lead time is the elapsed time for one item to make it through the system from
the initial step to customer shipment (in manufacturing, from receipt of an
order to the shipment of the product). Understanding the lead time and per-
centage of value-added time of a process is critical in Lean. Although this
information is displayed on the Value Stream Map, teams have used a more
simplistic tool to consider just the lead time.
The lead-time reduction chart is a simple ladder diagram. The chart is con-
structed top to bottom on a sheet of paper. The beginning of the process
starts at the top of the page. The steps are listed in sequence, with non-value-
added activities on the left-hand side and value-added activities on the right-
hand side. The boxes are drawn in proportion to time, visually depicting the
percentage of value-added and non-value-added time. Figure 7-3 shows an
example lead-time reduction chart.
141
Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

After you make the lead-time reduction chart, you work to eliminate the 
non-value-added activities and minimize the time required for the value-
added ones.

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Making Woodward and Bernstein 
proud: Investigating your value 
stream like a reporter
Journalists learn early on the importance of asking the right questions. You
start by covering all the basics, and then dive deeper to uncover the truth.
When you analyze your value stream, be the ace reporter. In the following
sections, we show you how.
The 5 Ws and 1 H
What, when, why, where, who, and how. Sounds simple enough. Yet time after
time, teams don’t have the patience to dig up the true answers to these ques-
tions when analyzing the value stream. Half of the equation is asking these
key questions; the other half is really listening to the answer. After you’ve lis-
tened, ask clarifying questions to ensure that you truly understand what’s
happening in the value stream.
This tool is useful in many scenarios within Lean, whether you’re proactively
improving a situation or reactively solving issues.
Lean is a people-focused methodology. “Who?” is one of the questions, but it
is not the first question asked nor is it the only question asked. Point and
blame is not the name of the Lean game.
Spaghetti diagrams
Spaghetti Diagrams, also known as layout diagrams, are really helpful when
you’re analyzing the flow of traffic or movement. Think about the last time
you misplaced something in your house. If you created a Spaghetti Diagram
of that mad search to find that important paper or set of keys, it would look
something like Figure 7-4.
This example may seem far-fetched, but most Spaghetti Diagrams look worse.
People don’t realize how much travel or movement is waste. Every day,
people look for tools, information, and parts — particularly at the beginning
of Lean, before standards are implemented and enforced. In the beginning,
just mapping the movement is enough to show you where to start. As you
progress, you can add more details, like the distance traveled.
143
Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

Spaghetti Diagrams are simple to make and very eye-opening. Here’s how to
make and use one:
1. Get a layout or blueprint of the area.
2. Pick the subject to follow.
This subject can be materials or people.
3. Record every movement of the target until it’s finished.
4. When the diagram is finished, brainstorm ways to eliminate the exces-
sive travel.
5. Improve the process or job design to eliminate the excess movement.
You may want to do this in a Kaizen event.
Using color can give your Spaghetti Diagram additional flavor. If you’re track-
ing components and assemblies, you can use certain colors for components
and others for assemblies. If you’re mapping a work team, you can use one
color for each team member or job function. You can see things like where
how parts can end up in the wrong place or where people are crashing into
or tripping over each other. This additional information will enable you to
create better solutions.

Using Qualitative Tools
The Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) was influential in
defining a set of basic tools that could be used for improving processes.
These came to be known as the seven tools of quality control (see Chapter 9).
After establishing the seven tools of quality control, which were formal, sta-
tistical tools, JUSE established the new seven tools — a set of qualitative
tools. The new seven tools are just as important as the original seven tools.
The new seven tools are
 Relations Diagram
 Affinity Diagram
 Tree Diagram
 Matrix Diagram
 Matrix Data Analysis Chart
 Process Decision Program Chart
 Activity Network (Arrow Diagram)
These tools are especially good for qualitative data analysis. Although the
names may sound complicated, most of these tools are easy to use. We cover
them all in the following sections. If you want to know more about these
tools, refer to Chapter 18. In particular, to see more examples, go to www.
syque.com/quality_tools/toolbook/toolbook.htm.
Relations Diagrams: Relating 
to each other
You use a relations diagram when the interrelationships of a situation are
complex. Through a network of boxes and arrows, you can analyze the com-
plexities and interactions to arrive at solutions. Figure 7-5 shows the struc-
ture of a relationship diagram.
Like most tools in Lean, relations diagrams are best developed with multi-
functional teams. In a group setting, sticky notes or index cards are great
materials to use to construct the diagram. Here are the steps to creating a
relations diagram:
145
Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

1. Describe the central issue.
2. Identify all the causes (one per box).
3. Group similar causes together.
4. Arrange according to cause-and-effect relationships.
5. Refine the causes (add, delete, reword, modify).
6. Indicate with arrows all the interrelationships.
7. Highlight the ones with strong or principal causal relationships.
One type of relations diagrams is a mind map. Mind maps use minimal words
and images to capture key information about a subject. Because of their
visual impact, they’re a highly effective method for depicting complex situa-
tions. The human brain records pictures and can more easily retain the 
information.

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Affinity Diagrams: Like meets like
Affinity Diagrams are used to synthesize large amounts of verbal information,
particularly in conjunction with brainstorming sessions. Using Affinity
Diagrams, teams grasp the overall situation, classify the assumptions behind
it, and better understand the unique perspectives of the team members.
After identifying a central theme for a problem, the individual ideas are writ-
ten on cards or sticky notes, one idea per card. Place the cards on a wall and
organize them into themes. Write an affinity card — a title or label for the
theme. Then arrange the ideas within a theme into similar subcategories.
Create an affinity card for each subcategory. After all the ideas have been
assimilated into a theme or discarded, the diagram is finished. Figure 7-6
shows the structure of an Affinity Diagram.
Tree Diagrams: From trunk to leaves
A tree diagram, also known as a work breakdown structure, is a tool used to
break down something into progressively smaller parts, making it easier to
understand and act upon. Whether you’re designing software, constructing a
house, or planning a gala, this tool will help you eat the elephant one bite at 
a time.

Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

At the top of the diagram, you place the overall issue — such as “build the
house.” In the next level down, you identify the major components that make
up the overall issue — excavation, foundation, framing, drywall, electrical,
plumbing, and so on. Then, under each of these, you identify the key compo-
nents over and over again until you’ve identified the lowest-level activity or
element.
In Chapter 3, the high-level view of the premade salad value stream shown in
Figure 3-4 is one example of a tree diagram.
Matrix Diagrams: Where 
information meets
The matrix diagram allows you to take two lists of information and depict the
relationships of each individual element. The most commonly used form of a
matrix diagram is the L shape. One list is displayed in a column on the left; in
a row across the top, the other list is displayed. At the intersection of the
column and row, the corresponding information is displayed. Two common
examples of how a matrix diagram looks are multiplication tables or city-to-
city distances on a map. In Lean, the central part of the interior house of
quality (shown in Figure 7-2) is a matrix diagram showing the connection
between whats and hows.
Matrix Data Analysis Charts: Comparing
multiple characteristics
The Matrix Data Analysis Chart (MDAC) is used to compare multiple items to
multiple characteristics. It’s one of the most difficult of the seven new tools to
use and it’s frequently replaced with a prioritization matrix. Examples where
MDAC could be beneficial are increased sales and increased customer satis-
faction for a store or improved material performance while reducing costs.
Evaluate multiple items against the two chosen factors, like customer satis-
faction and cost. Then plot each item on an x–y chart. When the plot is fin-
ished, you’ll see clusters of items in each quadrant. Focus on the items in the
quadrant corresponding to performance you desire (in this case, higher satis-
faction and lower cost).
148
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Process Decision Program Charts:
Understanding and mitigating risk
The Process Decision Program Chart (PDPC) is used to understand risk and
mitigate it through the implementation of countermeasures for any situation.
The structure of the PDPC is a tree diagram on its side, flowing from left to
right. So for each activity of the tree diagram, you identify possible risks and
for each risk you identify one or more countermeasures. Ideally, these coun-
termeasures prevent the problem from happening.
The PDPC is a great tool for new situations like new products, facilities, or
lines of business. In one chart, you can see your entire risk picture. It’s useful
for the development of Failure Mode Effects Analysis, a perfection tool (see
Chapter 9).
Activity Networks or Arrow Diagrams:
Networking activities
Activity networks, also known as arrow diagrams or PERT charts, are used 
to map a series of activities, including timing, critical path, and dependency
information. You can very clearly see the critical operations that need to be
monitored within the operation.
Most people who are building a house expect the contractors to take months.
The different skilled trades need to be scheduled in a particular order to
complete their tasks, and each task has a specific duration. This process is
full of waiting and waste. Now it may happen through the magic of television,
but one television show (ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition) has man-
aged to take a process normally lasting months — demolition and construc-
tion of a house — and accomplish it in one week. You can only imagine the
activity network required to manage all the volunteers and tradespeople
needed to build a house in a week!
Working with Software Tools
Lean practitioners regularly debate the best way to gather data and create
initial charts in a team environment — manual versus computer-generated.
Most teams find it easier to maintain their data and analysis with software
149
Chapter 7: Customer and Value-Stream Tools

tools. Several programs exist to aid in the creation of Value Stream Maps,
houses of quality, and data analysis charts.
Lean practitioners use both specialized and general-use programs. Programs
like Visio enable you to quickly create Spaghetti, Arrow, and Affinity diagrams.
Programs like iGrafx and Lean View have Value Stream Mapping capability.
QFD/Capture is one of the better known house-of-quality construction pack-
ages. On the Internet, you can also find templates that function in Excel for
everything from house of quality to Spaghetti diagrams. (See Chapter 18 for
other places to go for assistance.)

Chapter 8
Flow and Pull Tools
In This Chapter
 Preventing interruptions to flow
 Organizing the process for flow
 Orchestrating the material flow
I
n Lean, the concepts of flow in the value stream, and pull from each cus-
tomer through the value stream, are fundamental. Specific Lean tools help
you implement the flow and pull techniques. These two toolsets are the sub-
ject of this chapter; use these tools to set the pace of your system and elimi-
nate blockages to flow. Start with the flow tools. Applying the flow tools first
clears out the obstructions and gives you a solid foundation upon which to
create a kanban-based pull system using the pull tools.
Along with the customer and value-stream tools in Chapter 7, the perfection
tools in Chapter 9, and the management tools in Chapter 10, these tools make
up the overall Lean toolbox. You need all these tools to support Lean prac-
tices. To maintain balance in your overall system, you must use the full com-
plement of tools in the Lean toolbox.
Attempts to implement Lean can fail because the organization tries to imple-
ment a tool in isolation and at the wrong time. This has been particularly 
true with pull signal tools. You can’t use only one Lean tool like kanban and
expect to be wildly successful. You have to look at your system as a whole.
For example, a system plagued with defects or equipment outages will never
be able to produce to a pull signal at a given takt. For this reason, success
requires you to use all the tools, follow the principles, and apply the philoso-
phies of Lean. No cherry-picking!

Flow
You can see the power of flow all around you. Traffic flows, unless it is rush
hour, where the demand is exceeds the capacity of the road system, or some-
one has made a mistake and caused an accident. Music flows, as the musi-
cians play together to a defined tempo; if one musician were to get out ahead
or fall behind, the flow would be disrupted, and that disruption is the differ-
ence between beauty and cacophony. Skateboarders in a skate park flow for
an awesome ride, as long as they stay in balance and there are no obstruc-
tions or defects in their path. In our bodies, blood flows as a life force,
although we know that obstructions can be debilitating or even fatal.
In each of these examples, you can see how perfect flow achieves the goal,
but also what happens when flow is interrupted. In Lean, eliminating waste is
eliminating obstructions to flow — of people, products, services, information,
or materials. In the examples in the preceding paragraph, you can see that
flow is dependent upon all the elements of a system working in concert. When
one part of the system is not functioning properly, you won’t have flow. When
all parts are working together, flow happens.
Establishing order through 5S
To establish orderly flow, start with the 5S technique — eliminating waste by
organizing the workplace. 5S is simple and practical, and is implemented in
two phases. Phase 1: Get rid of all the junk! Stop working around it. Phase 2:
Create a system so there is a place for everything and everything stays in its
place.
Unless you have a very small facility, don’t try to address the entire facility at
once. You’ll overwhelm everyone, and you risk not really eliminating items,
but just shuffling them around. Before you start the 5S process, determine
the bounds of the area you’re addressing.
The five steps of the 5S process are:
1. Sort.
Divide all the items in the workplace into three R categories:
• Retain: Retain items that are essential to the functioning of the
work area. These items fall into two main groups: regular use and
occasional use.
• Return: Return any items that belong to another department, loca-
tion, supplier, or customer.
152
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

• Rid: Rid the area of all other items. Physically move them straight
to the recycle bin or dumpster for disposal, or a staging area for
immediate disposition. Note that any item located in the staging
area must be tagged with clear information about its disposition.
Isolate the rid items from the others. Red tags are particularly
useful for items that the team wants to throw out, but that need
some type of authorization for disposal. The tag should include the
date it was moved to the area, the contact person and her contact
information, the desired disposition, and the functions that need to
sign off on the disposal. As a general rule, no item marked for dis-
posal should remain in the staging area more than 48 hours.
2. Straighten.
Find a place for everything and put everything in its place. Move the
items that are always needed to where they’re needed. Establish and
delineate the standard location for every item. Label everything. Make it
visual. Better yet, make it sensory. Move those items that are not needed
on a frequent basis to a standard place, near the area — but not a place
that could disrupt flow.
3. Scrub.
Clean the entire area. Whether you’re in an office, a kitchen, or a factory,
this means deep-clean everything! If the area or equipment needs a fresh
coat of paint, get out the brushes and the rollers. Cleaning is everyone’s
job — not just the janitor’s or painter’s. This step is important for sev-
eral reasons:
• People working in a clean area tend to have a more positive atti-
tude and be more productive.
• Clean equipment helps you to more quickly detect leaks and prob-
lems with equipment.
• Clean and clear areas make safer work environments.
4. Systematize.
Now that you’ve gone to the work of cleaning the area once, establish
the schedules and systems to maintain the area regularly, just the way it
is on the first day after you’ve cleaned it.
5. Standardize.
Turn a one-time event into the way you conduct business. This step is
the most difficult one, because you’re creating new habits and levels of
performance expectations. Forming new habits requires constant rein-
forcement and time, before the new habits become the standard.
153
Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

Note: Some people have added a sixth S — Safety. Whether you call it out as a
separate S or not, creating a safe work environment is basic to respecting
people.
Housekeeping tours are a good way for management to accomplish several
goals:
 Stress the importance of the orderly environment.
 Practice a form of standardized work.
 Connect with the organization.
Management tours should cover the entire facility, inside and out. Tours
should not be ad hoc — they should follow a set process, with an established
checklist of items to review, including an agenda and facility route, restroom
visits, and safety equipment. Non-conformances should be recorded and
addressed. On the next tour, these items should be followed up on. Refer to
Chapter 12 for more information on gemba walks.
You’ll encounter resistance to the long-term maintenance of the 5S results.
Engineers who need to work with parts or highly creative types who need a
little chaos to feed their creativity are some of the biggest resisters. You have
to establish the standards for your organization. Some organizations require
that desks are cleaned off every night; others have deemed this cleaning up
at the end of the day as non-value-added. Both sides have merit. Determine
what’s right for your organization.
Take one, make one
The ideal state of Lean is continuous flow production, calibrated perfectly to
the customer demand. When you can organize your work area and perfectly
balance the operational times so that your document or widget is always in a
state of value-added transformation, you’ve reached Lean nirvana. You may
never actually get to this point, but you should never stop trying to get there.
To do so, you have to think constantly about how you organize the value
stream. The tools in the following sections will help you to move closer to the
zenith of continuous flow.
Don’t get hung up on the language of continuous-flow production or single-
piece flow. The terms may have originated in a manufacturing environment,
but they apply whether you’re making products or providing services. You
“flow people and information through a service process” just as you “flow
material and information through a manufacturing process.” In both cases,
the goal is to things moving effectively — no stops for queues or inventory
and no unnecessary movement or transport.
154
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Finding common ground through group technology
Group technology is the process of identifying commonality in process through
the analysis of all the products. Your aim is to identify product families. This
information is used to reorganize how you do business.
The term product is used here generically, to refer to physical products as
well as nonphysical items like software, transactions, and service processes
(such as hospitality and healthcare). Refer to Chapter 15 for more on how
services are like products.
To perform a group technology (GT) analysis, review all your products and
the operational steps they require. A product family contains the same or
highly similar operational steps. Table 8-1 shows a group technology analysis
example. The shaded parts represent a product family because they pass
through the majority of the same types of operations.

After you’ve identified all your product families, you can start to organize the
areas that produce them by family rather than by operation function.
Organizations that have a low-volume, high-mix custom environment often
struggle to see how group technology applies to them. Even if your product
details are unique every time, recognize that at a macro level, your products
pass through similar processing steps. You can use a sampling of past prod-
ucts to identify generic product families. Then when you spec out a new
product, you can slate its production for a specific area.
155
Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

Creating work modules or work cells
Traditional organizations are set-up by functional department, whether in 
the office or on a manufacturing facility. When you use in the results of your
group technology analysis and reorganize your facility accordingly, you natu-
rally reduce inventory, improve quality and communication, and save space.
Similar benefits apply when moving office workers into modules. Each work
module (or work cell) should contain all the functions required to make the
product or complete the service.
Managing the monuments
A Lean work module contains all the operations that can be moved together
into a continuous-flow arrangement. Sometimes you have fixed monuments
(equipment or processes that cannot be moved or large-capacity equipment
that services multiple product families). When this undesirable situation
occurs, the flow is stopped.
Some options for managing the monuments include the following:
 Arrange affected work modules around the monument.
 Establish supermarkets (an in-process, controlled storage area) to
create controlled storage and flow to the monument operation.
 Create continuous-flow work modules before and after the monument.
 Consider purchasing smaller, more flexible technology to achieve the
same function, and then incorporate it into work modules.
Challenge your belief that there is nothing you can do about a monument.
Ask yourself, “How can we do this operation differently?” For instance, one
company thought its paint facility was a monument. After persistent ques-
tioning, it found a way to incorporate a lower-technology miniature paint
booth into its work module. Through persistence and a new perspective, it
lowered inventory, eliminated a paint line that required lots of maintenance
and frequently broke, and improved quality defects related to inventory and
in-facility transit.
Balancing the operations
The capacity of the cell is based on the collective demand of the customer
for the product family as well as the capability of the team members. From
the example of Figure 8-1, assume that the takt time is 60 seconds. Figure 8-1
shows a graph of operation times compared to takt time for this product
family. In this case, independent of the part being made, operation times fall
below takt time of 60 seconds. If operations exceeded takt time, you would
consider additional capacity for the cell.
156
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Take the part number with the longest operation time and evaluate it for line
balancing. You can then seek to combine operations 1 with 3 and 6 with 7, and
still meet the takt time. Figure 8-2 shows the results. As you can see, the combi-
nation of operations 6 and 7 cause the cycle time to exceed the takt time.
Figure 8-3 shows the final line balance. The work cell requires four operators 
to run five operations. Going forward, the team would then seek to reduce the
time required to complete operations 6 and 7, by at least 3 seconds — the time
to balance to the takt time — and enable the cell to run with three operators.

Identifying bottleneck operations
Within every cell, you’ll have a bottleneck operation — the one that limits
throughput and runs closest to the takt time. This operation becomes the
critical operation to flow because there is no slack time or no option to add
more people, if there is a machine issue. To identify the bottleneck, create a
graph like the one in Figure 8-2 for all the operations in the value stream.
Storing at the point of use
Point of use storage (POUS) means you store what you need, in the quantity
you need it, at or near where you use it. This storage should be incorporated
into the 5S standards. You have to identify the bill of materials, quantity used,
and size of each component in order to establish where you’ll store each
item, what type of container you’ll use for storage, and where best to locate
the items.
When establishing POUS storage and work module arrangement, remember
to evaluate the ergonomic impact of the operators. Considerations like shelf
heights, reach distances, standup versus seated operations, and maximum
heights are among some of the critical characteristics to evaluate. Investigate
current industry standards and governmental regulations for more informa-
tion. (See Chapter 18 for resources.)
Understand bottlenecks, output, work balance, staffing, and storage require-
ments before you arrange the furniture. This information can be quickly gath-
ered, analyzed, and understood. Failure to understand these foundational
elements of your work cell will lead to ineffective modules — full of muda!
Arranging the work module
The recommended shape for a work module is a U shape, flowing counterclock-
wise. U shapes don’t work in every application, but they’re a good place to start.
(The reasons for counterclockwise flow are numerous, but fundamentally, the

right hemisphere of our brains process spatial relationships, so humans flow
better to the left.) Specifically, the U shape provides a safer environment where
maintenance and material replenishment occurs on the outside of the U. The
people making the products are the only ones inside the U.
Create a layout before you start moving, to ensure everything fits in the
space allotted. Depending on how difficult it is to move the equipment, you
can use a layout tool like Visio or AutoCAD, scaled “paper-doll” cutouts of the
equipment, or even full-size mockups of the module to establish the plan. If
you’ve never created a work cell or work module before, and you have large
pieces of equipment, like presses or molding machines, you’ll want to use
full-scale, three-dimensional replicas. This enables the team to ensure that
the plan will work.
When you understand the foundational requirements of your work module,
you’re ready to set up the module. Figure 8-4 is an example of a work module
layout.
If this is your first module, start with a pilot or test module. This will help you
learn, work out the bugs, and introduce the organization to the concept before
you physically tear up the entire facility.

Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

The use of autonomation (automation with a human mind), or jidoka, in a
workstation has two benefits:
 Automatically unloading equipment enables an operator to do other
tasks, instead of having to stand around until the machine has finished.
 Automation that stops equipment when defects or nonstandard condi-
tions are detected prevents bad product from progressing through the
value stream.
People in the process
Work modules are run by teams, sometimes referred to as employee involve-
ment teams. These teams are usually autonomous, self-directed work teams.
Often a team leader emerges or is named based on experience. The team
leader is responsible for the execution and performance of the cell:
 Production output, quality, delivery, and controllable cost performance
 Line balancing
 Cross training and team behavior
 Performing Kaizen (regular improvements)
 Maintaining the work area (cleaning and daily equipment maintenance)
 Problem solving
Supervisors take on an advisory role and have more work teams reporting to
them. The daily task load is shifted to the team.
When moving to a Lean work cell environment, the teams and the supervi-
sors will need training in new skills — particularly the interpersonal skills of
conflict resolution, teaming, coaching, and communication.
Orchestrating the operations
When evaluating each work station or work area within a work module, apply
industrial engineering techniques like left-hand/right-hand analysis or Therblig
analysis. Evaluating and standardizing the movements at a micro level will
increase flow, eliminate waste, and improve the effectiveness of the operations.
Improvement at a micro level will enable the team to shave off the four seconds
needed to eliminate that fourth operator in the earlier example (see the
“Balancing the operations” section).
160
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Preventing blockages to flow
After you’ve created your work modules, you have to make sure that they
continually run as designed. In other words, you have to eliminate any and 
all causes that prevent flow from happening — flow of quality, material, or
equipment.
Ensuring quality at the source
In addition to the use of autonomation, you can establish quality at the
source by using source inspection, progressive inspection, and poka-yoke
(error-proofing).
Source inspection
Source inspection means you review your work before you pass it on to the
next station. What you review, how you review it, and how much time it
should take to review the work is identified as part of the standardized work
for the operation. The benefit to source inspection is to identify, correct, and
contain a problem before it enters into the value stream via the next process-
ing operation.
Progressive inspection
Progressive inspection means that the operator reviews key characteristics of
the product from the previous step before beginning a new transformational
step. Once again, these inspection steps should be designed into the stan-
dardized work plan. Investing in critical inspection before any further work is
performed protects the customer and minimizes the risk to the value chain.
Poka-yoke
Because inspection is a form of muda, a more certain and proactive type of
quality at the source is error-proofing, known as poka-yoke or mistake-proofing.
A poka-yoke is something in a product, process, or procedure that physically or
procedurally prevents you from doing something incorrectly.
Examples of poka-yoke are everywhere. Whenever you fill up your car at a gas
pump with both diesel and regular gas, you’re using a poka-yoke device. The
size of the diesel spout is larger than the gasoline spout, so the diesel spout
can’t fit in the regular gas tank opening — which prevents you from doing
serious damage to your engine! Other examples include: electronic devices
that only allow you to plug in a specific way; CDs that have writing on one
side to visually cue you how to load them in the machine; and online surveys
that have logic to check that you’ve answered all the questions before you
can proceed to the next page.
161
Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

In performing poka-yoke, begin by evaluating each operational step for
common quality problems. Identify guides, gauges, or fixtures that will ensure
the operation is done correctly every time. Follow the Plan-Do-Check-Act
(PDCA) methodology to evaluate their effectiveness. Installing things on equip-
ment or incorporating checklists into standardized work will help the situation,
but the best way to error-proof is through the design of features in the product.
Design for Assembly and Manufacturability (DFA/DFM) is a methodology to
identify ways to design in error-proofing and improve the ease of assembly.
Performing Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) on the design and process
(DFMEA/PFMEA) will help you to identify the risk and frequency of potential
failures. With this information, you can prioritize your error-proofing efforts
to mitigate risk.
Part of the foundation of Lean is respect for people. Don’t use the term idiot-
proofing! The proper terms are poka-yoke, mistake-proofing, or error-proofing.
Although error-proofing may seem like detailed, picky analysis, it could mean
the difference between life and death. Consider, for example, two medica-
tions: They have similar names, and they’re placed in almost identical pack-
aging. If the manufacturer changed the container shape, size, or color so that
the two medications were obviously different, the people in the hospital
would be less likely to make fatal mistakes, by giving the wrong medicine to
the wrong patient.
Figure 8-5 shows an error-proofing worksheet.
Devising flexible and reliable equipment
When you no longer can hide behind inventory and waste, the role of your
equipment becomes more important. It must be ready and functioning prop-
erly when you need it. You’ll also change how you design and purchase
equipment for modular manufacturing: You want to find the smallest, sim-
plest, most flexible equipment you can for the job. In order to make the full
compliment of product mix every day, your equipment has to be able to be
changed over very quickly.
Maintaining the equipment
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is divided into three areas:
 Autonomous maintenance: Autonomous maintenance means that the
operations within the work module perform their own routine mainte-
nance tasks. This frees up the more skilled maintenance trades to focus
on the more specialized planned and predictive maintenance activities.
Standardized work descriptions for the maintenance tasks including fre-
quency are used by the operators to perform regular maintenance.
162
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

 Planned maintenance: Planned maintenance is vital in a Lean environ-
ment. You proactively schedule equipment to be taken out of service 
in order to replace major, high-risk, or high-wear components. As com-
ponents are replaced, data is collected to develop predictive failure 
scenarios. You can use the data tools in Chapter 9 to understand the
performance of the components from a statistical perspective. You then
can use this information to create predictive maintenance routines.
 Predictive maintenance: When the maintenance organization arrives at
a place where it can anticipate failures, it can better control costs and
perform its maintenance activities at the right time, not just the sched-
uled time. Additionally, it can identify which parts and what quantity to
keep in inventory for routine maintenance, planned maintenance, and
emergency response.

The aim of TPM is to maximize the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) and
minimize production losses due to equipment failure or malfunction. OEE is a
performance metric tracked on the Balanced Scorecard, especially for manu-
facturing organizations. It is calculated like this:
OEE% = Availability × Performance Rate × Quality
Even with the best TPM plan in the world, unexpected downtime will still
happen. Create emergency response teams who respond at the flash of an
andon light. These teams should have standardized work descriptions and
diagnostic checklists to follow.
Mastering the quick change
What does an actor between entrances, a NASCAR team in the pits, and a
stamping press in a factory have in common? All of them must use quick-
change techniques to be successful. In Lean, quick changeover is known as
SMED, which is short for single-minute exchange of die. In this case, the die
refers to a machine that cuts or forms material in some type of press or a
forging device. The die has to be reconfigured in order to make a new prod-
uct, and the goal is to complete the changeover in 1 minute. From this origi-
nal use, the term SMED has come to mean any quick setup process or other
reduction of setup time. The aim is to minimize downtime or lost time
between the end of one activity and the beginning of the next.
Here’s how to organize a quick change:
1. List all the steps, required tools, and materials to change from one
thing to the next.
2. Identify which activities can be done before or after the change
(offline, or external, activities) and which have to be done in the
moment (online, or internal, activities).
3. Create standardized work for offline activities. Organize tools and
material offline to support the online ones.
4. Refine and standardize the online activities to minimize lost time.
5. Constantly evaluate the performance of the overall changeover
process to improve the performance time and eliminate waste.
For the NASCAR pit crew, fractions of seconds in the pit can mean the differ-
ence between victory and defeat. For the theater actor, fractions of seconds
can be the difference between a missed entry and a stellar performance. For
the factory, implementing quick setup enables production of the full comple-
ment of products every day — ultimately the difference between a satisfied
and dissatisfied customer.
164
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Pull
We tell you about flow tools and pull tools in the same chapter because they
work in harmony with one other to keep the entire value stream moving
toward the customer at the rate the customer consumes. You can’t have flow
linked to customer demand without pull and vice versa. All the tools in this
section make the system work better, with minimal waste.
Smoothing out the bumps
In order to provide the customer with what they want, when they want it, while
keeping the value stream flowing at a steady pace, you need to smooth out the
production schedules. This concept is known as heijunka, which means “pro-
duction smoothing, leveling, or level scheduling.” The concept is this: Instead
of making large batches of one product, and then storing them in a warehouse
until you hope the customer orders them, you make a certain amount of all the
products, every day.
The faster the changeover times (SMED — see “Mastering the quick change,”
earlier in this chapter), the easier it will be to smooth out production.
Figure 8-6 contrasts traditional lot production with level production. Notice
that, throughout the sequence, the various products are interspersed.
The calculation of the optimal sequence is a complex algorithm. It is based
on cycle times, available work hours, setup times, and demand. You can pur-
chase software programs to help you determine your optimal mix.

Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

Production smoothing protects the suppliers in the value stream from the
bull-whip effect, where the effects of small fluctuations on the customer end
translate into radical volume swings upstream.
Signaling replenishment
In a Lean environment, you don’t use forecasted demand schedules — these
represent pushing production, and they usually don’t correlate well with real
customer demand. In Lean, the value stream is signaled to action through a
demand indicator known as a kanban.
Creating kanban
A kanban signal can come in many forms — a card, an empty container, num-
bered ping-pong balls, or an empty space that needs filling. You determine
the most effective kanban for the specific application. In a work module that
is relatively balanced, the empty space may be the best solution. With the
supply base, the electronic kanban card may be the most effective method.
Whatever method you use, the kanban must signal how much, and of what
part, needs to be delivered to what location.
Using the philosophy of “take one, make one,” as inventory is consumed, the
signal (kanban) is sent upstream to call for replenishment activities. One
common way to think about kanban is the two-bin system: It’s like batters in
baseball — one at the plate and one on deck.
The number of kanbans you need is a function of the average demand per
unit of time — usually daily — total time and container capacity. The calcula-
tion is as follows:
Number of Kanbans = ([Average Demand(Time)] × [OC + PT + TT] × [1 +
BT]) ÷ CC
where:
 OC = Order Cycle
 PT = Processing Time
 TT = Transit Time
 BT = Buffer Time (not over 10 percent)
 CC = Container Capacity (not more than 10 percent of Average Demand)
 Average Demand is a function of Time (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,
and so on)
166
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

A heijunka box is designed to house the kanban cards related to the produc-
tion sequence. Slots that represent a specific part number and increment of
time during the day contain the kanban for the parts to be made during that
time.
Controlling inventory with supermarkets
Sometimes, because of monuments or other process constraints, you cannot
have a continuous-flow system. When this happens, you create what’s called
a supermarket. A supermarket is like your corner grocery, in that every item
has a designated location and amount. The inventory is tightly controlled
and kanban signals are used when a “customer” makes a “purchase” from the
store. The supplying operation is the owner of the supermarket. The kanban
signals the replenishment upstream.
Supermarkets should be located to minimize the “Transportation” waste of
excess travel. It’s better if you don’t have to use them, but sometimes you
can’t avoid it. If you implement supermarkets, you must control them; if not,
you may find you’ve given away the store!
Planning for every part
Plan for Every Part (PFEP) is a master planning document (usually in the form
of a database or spreadsheet) used to plan where raw material, supplies, parts,
and/or product are to be stored within the facility. The planning information
includes the stock number, part name, inventory levels (minimum and maxi-
mum), and the storage locations (supermarket, central warehouse, point of
use, and so on).
Connecting MRP and kanban
Kanban and MRP/ERP planning systems both have their appropriate func-
tions. When you use kanban internally, you don’t need the demand forecast
portion of the system. However, you’ll want to maintain accurate business
records. One technique to relieve inventory is called backflushing. Not all
experts agree that backflushing is the best way to maintain the inventory
records. You have to decide the best method of data management for your
organization. Whatever method you use, approach it with the mindset of
eliminating waste to find the most effective solution for the organization.
Moving to pull scheduling will require changes to your current scheduling
processes — remember that you’re working to eliminate waste, and some 
of what you have historically viewed as value added scheduling was really 
type-1 muda (see Chapter 3).

Chapter 8: Flow and Pull Tools

Changing logistics
When you’re operating in a Lean system, you have to rethink the way you
approach logistics. Traditionally, a supplier would send a truckload of stuff
“whenever.” Instead, set up your organization for success by implementing
creative logistical solutions, aimed at supplying you with what you need,
when you need it, in the quantity you need it.
Collecting from multiple suppliers: The milk run
Sending a truck on a fixed route at fixed times to collect product from a sev-
eral suppliers is known as a milk run. Instead of having to deal with many par-
tially loaded trucks at your facility, you can attend to fewer shipments, which
contain a predictable load and arrival time.
Shipping Less than Truckload (LTL)
LTL shipments, if done correctly, can be cheaper than waiting to cube out full
trucks. (Cube out is the process of maximizing shipping density of a load in a
semi-trailer.) LTL shipments are used when the suppliers are not located in a
place that you can feasibly construct milk runs.
Delivery windows
Delivery windows enhance the both the predictability and stability of your
incoming materials. To establish a delivery window, you schedule suppliers to
deliver a specified amount of product, to a specified location or dock, within a
specific window of time. In many industries, failure to comply with the deliv-
ery windows may result in hefty fines to the supplier or loss of business.
Delivery routes
Delivery routes are schedules that dictate the timing, location and amount of
material moved within the value stream. Delivery routes help to regulate the
pace of the material flow. Think of a city bus route — it’s like a delivery route.
People are moved through a city by a bus that picks up and drops off passen-
gers at set locations according to an established time schedule as signaled by
passengers at the bus stop (a kanban). In a product manufacturing environ-
ment, material is moved by a specific type of equipment, according to a set
schedule, to established locations as signaled by kanban.
Using the Plan for Every Part (PFEP) tool and a facility layout will help you to
establish your delivery routes.

 Understanding the power of standardized work
 Creating a visual environment
 Identifying defects and variation
I
n a Lean environment, you compare everything to a standard, and then
work to improve it. You don’t change anything indiscriminately — twiddle,
or hack, or “just do it” to improve performance. You use information, data
analysis and visual tools to help you deliberately identify where waste and
defects are cropping up. Along with the customer and value-stream tools in
Chapter 7, flow and pull tools described in Chapter 8, and the management
tools in Chapter 10, the perfection tools in this chapter make up the overall
Lean toolbox. You need all of these tools to support Lean practices.
In this chapter, you discover how to create standardized work — the founda-
tion upon which activities and processes are built, and the basis upon which
improvements are made. We show you how to organize Kaizen events for
continuous improvement. By using visual-management tools, you’ll under-
stand how to create a world where it’s possible to “manage by eye.” Finally,
you find out about the everyday statistical tools that help monitor and ana-
lyze the performance of the system. This is the part of the toolkit that
enables you to strive for perfection.
Beginning with Standardized Work
Your pursuit of perfection begins with standards. Standardization is essential
to effective work. The standardization of your activities, processes, and pro-
cedures directly enables the Lean goals of higher quality, lower costs, greater
efficiency, effective communications, and the highest respect for people.

Standardized work, sometimes referred to as standard work or standard opera-
tions, applies at all levels and in all areas of your business:
 Specification standards include descriptions and quality, methods and
tools, communications and terminology.
 Subject standards include company rules and policies, business manage-
ment, regulatory and compliance.
 Technical standards include materials, components, products, and 
services.
Begin with the routine work tasks that most directly affect your ability to
deliver to customer demand. Characterize this work in such a way that you
can measure both the variability and waste in its operation, as well as apply
methods and tools to continually improve performance over time. Repeat
this process until you have standardized work for all activities.
Standardized work sets the foundation for improvement. To apply analysis
and improvement tools, you must first characterize what you’re doing now —
the current processes. You have to standardize processes to have a basis for
measurement. You must establish a culture and mindset around standardized
work.
Failing to define and perform to standardized work is a slippery slope.
Without standardized work, you have no firm basis for truly understanding
today’s problems and challenges. You also can’t accurately value planned
improvements. Plus, you have no way of implementing new processes and
procedures and working to them with any regularity. You also have no accu-
rate basis of measuring and understanding what you’ve changed. But worst
of all, you breed an ad hoc, free-for-all work culture.
Guiding rules for standardized work
Five rules govern your approach to implementing standardized work. Follow
these rules as you develop your standardized work practices:
 Adjust to human ease and effectiveness, not machine efficiency. The
goal of standardized work is to help people be more safe and effective 
at what they do. Define work processes and procedures to optimize
people — not machines. Machines are tools that assist people, not the
other way around. Machine capabilities and limitations should not con-
trol your implementation of standardized work.
170
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

 Standardize all repetitive work. Standardize any and all work that’s per-
formed repeatedly. Certain work may be easier to standardize, and you
may be tempted to just do the easy stuff. Don’t avoid standardizing the
more difficult processes as well, because you’ll receive the benefits from
standardizing all processes.
The more you can repeat a process, the better you can standardize it
and reap the benefits. Strive to look for elements of what you do that are
repetitive so that you can standardize them.
 Keep the equipment and systems in condition. Materials, computers,
machines, and other systems support your work processes. Keep these
in the standard conditions necessary to ensure you’re producing both a
high quality of output and an even flow of work. Breakdowns and lack of
quality materials will disrupt your flow and impact product and service
quality. Substandard systems should be repaired or upgraded indepen-
dent of the work being performed.
 Make standardized worksheets visible and accessible. People can
easily stray from performing to work standards. Everyone needs con-
stant references and reminders. In addition, capturing key metrics —
particularly deviations — isn’t always easy. Keep standardized work-
sheets visible and readily accessible. Be certain that you’re making it
easy to know when variations occur.
 Revise regularly. Update and improve standardized work whenever you
can. Jump on every chance to reduce variation, minimize inventory,
improve workflow, and keep individual cycle times balanced with the
overall takt time. Change the standard as often as necessary.
People will routinely find better ways than the standard. Don’t treat
standardized work as an end in itself. Standardized work is the routine,
but when you have an improvement to standard, make the adjustments
regularly through Kaizen.
Implementing standardized work
Standardized work — in the form of tasks, activities, processes, and 
procedures — is work that’s conducted in a standard manner: it’s specific,
documented, measurable, and repeatable. Standardized work can apply to a
person working by himself, or a group of people working collaboratively. It
can include equipment and systems as well as human-to-machine interfaces.
This standardization of work occurs not only in production or operations
areas, but across the enterprise — in all functions and throughout all value
streams.
171
Chapter 9: Perfection Tools

To implement standardized work, follow this six-step process:
Step 1: Check equipment
Analyze all facilities, systems, and equipment to ensure that they’re in proper
and sufficient condition to meet the needs of the process activities. Adjust
and tune systems to maximize ease of use and effectiveness.
Step 2: Check time
Determine the initial cycle time for the work — how long it takes you or your
team to complete a unit of work. Then, compare that cycle time to the takt
time requirement — how long you should be taking, as pulled by customer
demand.
When you have these two values, determine the difference. Are you high or
low? Chances are that the work time is longer than the takt time. You must
make adjustments to equalize them. Usually, this means adjusting the time
that it takes to complete a unit of work, rather than attempting to adjust the
takt time. To reconcile work time–takt time discrepancies, perform the follow-
ing analysis and improvement efforts:
 Analyze the workflow, sequencing, and organization of your internal
process, and identify where speed and efficiencies can be gained.
 Restructure your internal process as necessary so that your cycle time
is in concert with the takt time.
 Institutionalize the new production times as part of the standardized
work instructions.
Step 3: Check Work-In-Process (WIP)
Your next step is to minimize Work-In-Process (inventory muda). Examine
your work module or area for ways to reduce the amount of inventory or
Work-In-Process required. You want to define standardized work for all
processes in such a way as to require minimal amounts of WIP. Be sure to
establish the acceptable range for inventory levels.
Step 4: Post it
Now that you’ve initially verified your support systems, balanced your pro-
ductivity rate with the takt time, and established the inventory range, it’s
time to baseline your process and issue standard instructions. Standardized
work instructions can take nearly any form — as long as they’re precise,
understandable, and measurable — and as long as they can be followed by
the individuals performing the work.
172
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Standard instructions can be printed on paper, read on a computer screen,
printed on signs, or transmitted by any manner of communication — as long
as it works. Examples of standard instructions include the following:
 Instruction sheets: These describe the procedure, including the organi-
zation, flow, and timing of the activities; the WIP range to maintain; and
supporting equipment and environmental conditions, where applicable.
Instruction sheets should be brief, easy to read, visible, and referenced.
 Operating manuals: These describe equipment, facilities, software pro-
grams, and other systems in terms of how they’re used in the process
activity. Operating manuals should be developed as training and refer-
ence documents that are kept handy in the workplace.
Poka-yoke (error-proof) your work instructions. Wherever possible, imple-
ment methods that help ensure not only that people will follow the instruc-
tions properly, but also that they will be prevented from not following them.
Step 5: Monitor, measure, and manage
Congratulations — you’ve crossed the starting line! You have implemented 
a unit of standardized work and can begin to observe it in action. Now you
must actively monitor the activities and continuously measure performance
of the work module. Regularly compare performance to standards, and strive
to maintain performance to standard:
 For any variances you observe, where the work activity is not conforming
to the standard instructions, identify the cause and intervene to correct
the deviations — and restore the activity to comply with the standard.
 Seek to identify waste, and identify the cause of the nonconformance.
When you observe deviations from the standard, don’t try to modify and
update the standard on the fly. Everyone’s goal is to work to the standard. If
you measure consistent deviations from the standard, the analysis will serve
to support a formal adjustment. However, until the standard is changed, the
old standard still applies — and everyone should always be working to the
standard!
Step 6: Adjust and update
Going forward, you’ll apply numerous mapping, measurement, and analysis
tools to characterize and evaluate the effectiveness of your standardized
work processes. You’ll support the team with management tools, and you’ll
conduct Kaizen events to determine improvements. (These many Lean tools
are the subject of the latter part of this chapter and the other chapters in
Part III.) As a result of using these many tools, you’ll regularly determine that
the standards should be updated.
173
Chapter 9: Perfection Tools

When a change is warranted, make it — and make it quickly. Making rapid
and detailed revisions to standard should be a normal, routine process; make
sure you can implement formal changes swiftly and easily, and introduce
them into your environment smoothly. The rapid adjustment process is criti-
cal to continuous improvement. Your team should be conditioned to absorb
regular updates.
Because you want everyone working to standard, the standards must always
be right and proper — and this means the update process must be routine
and smooth. If your standards are out of date, everyone will quickly conclude
that it’s no longer necessary to work to standard, and you’ve lost the battle.
Updating standardized work is an integral part of Kaizen! If you’re doing
Kaizen, you’d better be updating standards.
Standardizing operations is one of the most important tools of a Lean enter-
prise. Standardizing work processes helps you to achieve a consistently high
quality of product and services, performed by proud and productive workers,
received by satisfied customers, within a safe environment and strong cost
performance. Reducing variation in work processes leads to remarkable pro-
ductivity improvements.
Improving with Kaizen
Kaizen is the act and art of continuous, incremental change and improve-
ment. Kaizen tells you that even if something isn’t broken, it can and must be
improved: Do it better and make it better. The continual, incremental changes
of Kaizen occur in all areas and at all levels — large and small, internal and
external — in ways that improve the whole organization. Lean Kaizen main-
tains the focus on customer value and the reduction of waste in the value
stream. (Refer to Chapter 6 for an in-depth discussion and explanation of
Kaizen.)
Kaizen sees the enterprise through two lenses — setting new standards and
maintaining existing standards. Kaizen maintenance is the act of establishing
the policies and rules that help maintain the performance levels set by the
present managerial and operating work standards. Kaizen improvement then
focuses on the continuous improvement of existing standards and processes,
as well as the innovation of new ones.
In all cases, the Kaizen requires the application of the needed training, mate-
rials, tools, and supervision to improve and maintain standards on a contin-
ual basis.
174
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

The Kaizen event — also known as a Kaizen workshop or Kaizen blitz — is a
powerful and effective tool for engaging everyone within a work module or
process area in a focused improvement activity. A Kaizen event is a complete
run-through of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, typically lasting five
days. During the Kaizen event, the project team focuses on a specific area to
find waste or other hindrances to value creation, and remove them from the
value stream. The stimuli may be from issues in quality, changeover time,
communications, organization — almost anything. Kaizen events are famous
for requiring minimal investment and yielding great benefits.
The Kaizen project team will halt its normal work completely and will not
produce its regular product or perform its services while it’s participating in
the Kaizen event. Advance planning is required to ensure that the customers,
as well as other areas of the business, are not impacted inappropriately while
the improvements are discovered and implemented.
Because the Kaizen event is conducted within a week’s time, you will need to
perform follow-up work to complete the change process. Track the comple-
tion of change items, and don’t hesitate to perform additional changes and
updates as required. Follow-up items should be completed within 30 days of
the event. (For more about Kaizen events, see Chapter 6.)
Seeing Is Knowing: Visual-Management
Tools
If a picture is worth a thousand words, an area with lots of visual-management
tools in action must be worth a thousand minutes, a thousand dollars, and
a thousand steps! When you use visual management, you don’t waste time,
energy, or effort looking for things, people, or defects. You can easily see
what’s happening, whether things are running according to plan or not.
Keep the visual-management tools simple. Institute visual-management stan-
dards. Make them sensory — color, lights, sound, visual cues, or space. The
more senses you appeal to, the more quickly you can gain status information.
Use cartoon drawings. Whether creating visual aides, writing up an issue, or
conveying safety information, simple cartoon drawings bridge any language
or literacy gap. Lean companies frequently use simple cartoon drawings
throughout documents, meetings, facilities, and operations.
175
Chapter 9: Perfection Tools

Andon
In ancient Japan, an andon was a paper lantern (a handy vertically collapsible
paper lampshade with an open top and a candle placed at the central section
of the closed bottom). To the ancient Japanese, the andon functioned as a
flashlight, a signaling device in the distance, or even a commercial sign.
Nowadays, an andon is an electronic information or signaling device that may
include graphics, colored text, and maybe even audio. Andons are used
throughout public and private environments to communicate important
status and failure messages to employees and customers. Andon is focused in
particular on informing when a process or product is in jeopardy of failure, or
has failed.
In manufacturing environments, an andon can be as simple as a three-color
signal board that indicates in-spec, near-limits, and out-of-limits conditions
for a running process. In service environments, andon displays can indicate
queues and customer wait times. Transaction andons can be computer pro-
grams that warn operators of imminent failure conditions in data processing
systems or at interface points.
Consumer andons have been increasing in popularity. Displays in airports
indicate departure and boarding status. Freeway signs indicate accidents and
backups. And what about that little light that comes on your dashboard
warning you that you’re low on gas? That’s an andon.
Display boards
Display boards communicate vital information about the customer, process
performance, standardized work, kaizen improvements, or team status.
Display boards serve as effective and useful communication centers.
Display boards are operational nerve centers for the the organization,
located where the action is. Often, they’re handmade and include data charts,
photos of customer contacts or team members, and process data before and
after Kaizen improvements. Figure 9-1 shows an example display board.
Standardize the format of your display boards throughout the organization.
By creating this commonality, no matter where you are you’ll quickly be able
to absorb the key information for the particular area.

Cross-training charts
Ideally, everyone is trained to do every job according to the standardized work
design. Cross-training charts track the team’s progress to this objective and
identify people and their skills. In a cross-training chart like the one shown in
Figure 9-2, all operations within a work module are listed across the top and
each of the team members is listed by name along the left side.
When a team member is trained in a standard operation, a circle is placed at
the intersection of his name and the operation. When he can competently
perform the function according to the standardized work, the circle is filled
in. Figure 9-2 is an example of a two-crew operation. On each team, at least
one person can perform all the operations to the standard.

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Cross-training charts are a powerful visual tool. At a glance you know:
 Who can fill in when others are absent, without risking performance.
 Who is the most expert member of the team.
 When untrained employees are performing operations.
 Where the team is weak.
Additionally, cross-training charts provide valuable information when creat-
ing training and development plans.
Pictograms
Pictograms (or pictographs) provide a quick way to see where defects are
occurring — in a place, on a part, or in the system. Police use “murder maps”
to track where the murders or other crimes happen. Armed with this informa-
tion, they can properly staff neighborhoods, create relationships with the
neighbors and work to solve and prevent crime. This same idea can be used
in any situation to visually identify defect patterns so that corrective and pre-
ventative actions can be taken.
To create a pictogram, make a visual representation of what you want to
study — a city map, a factory layout, a drawing of a part, or any graphical
representation you choose. Visually indicate where the defect happens, with
pushpins, markings, or colored dots. Detect the patterns and use Kaizen to
improve the situation. It’s amazingly powerful!
Everyday Improvement Tools
The beauty of the Lean everyday improvement tools is in how simple they
are to use. They’re visual; they show you what you need to see. They don’t
require advanced math or statistics to use and understand. They can be done
by hand, on a calculator, or a computer. These tools can be used by everyone
within the philosophy of Kaizen for regular, continuous improvement. They
support opinion with facts and data.

Chapter 9: Perfection Tools

The 5 Whys
To seek out the cause of an issue or problem, you ask why it happened. But
probing just one layer gets you to just the first cause of the problem. The
root cause is usually much deeper. You have to keep probing. Noriaki Kano,
creator of the Kano model, likens this to drilling down, “going an inch wide
and a mile deep” to gain real understanding, rather than the superficial
understanding gained from the converse — a mile wide and an inch deep.
The 5 Whys is a simple probing tool that helps you get to the root cause of a
problem. At each level of explanation, keep asking “Why?” until you get to the
true underlying reasons. Ask at least five times.
Why five times? The number five is arbitrary. The point is not the number —
it’s the probing. You may get to the bottom in 2, or it may take 10 or 20 or 
50 times, depending on the complexity of your situation.
Never take the first answer as the true reason. Keep asking “Why?” until
you’re satisfied that you’ve found the real root cause.
Consider this humorous example: The marble surface of the Washington
Monument was disintegrating. That’s terrible! Let’s ask why:
 Why is the surface of the monument disintegrating?
Answer: Extensive use of harsh cleaning chemicals have eroded the
marble veneer.
 Why are we using such harsh chemicals?
Answer: An inordinate number of pigeons collect around the monument,
and they deposit high levels of pigeon poop on the marble surface.
 Why are there so many pigeons?
Answer: Pigeons eat spiders, and there are an unusually high numbers of
spiders on the monument.
 Why are there so many spiders on the monument?
Answer: Spiders eat gnats, and there’s a high gnat population at the 
monument.
 Why are there so many gnats?
Answer: Gnats are most active at dusk and are attracted by bright 
lights. The National Park Service illuminates the monument at dusk,
attracting the gnats, which increases the spider and, therefore, the
pigeon population.
180
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

The solution? Adjust the timing and characteristics of the lighting.
At each level of this example, you could have stopped asking and begun treat-
ing the symptoms, never reaching the bottom and discovering the true cause.
This example also illustrates that the fix to the real problem is often simpler
and more straightforward than attacking the symptoms!
Probe deeply, but carefully. You’ll likely need to go to the next “Who?” in
order to find someone with the expertise to answer the next “Why?” Also,
examine the problem from different angles, because you may get different
answers, depending on whom you ask.
The seven basic tools of quality
The quality toolbox contains many, many tools for analyzing and improving
the quality of products and processes. Some of the more involved tools,
such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and process capability analysis, are
powerful and important. However, you don’t use those advanced tools
every day.
The basic everyday quality toolset consist of seven simple tools that anyone
can use. These are long-standing tools that have been used in quality circles
for decades. If you apply these basic tools regularly, you’ll conquer the major-
ity of your quality challenges.
In keeping with the philosophy of visual management, these tools are primar-
ily graphical in nature. Graphical representations communicate more infor-
mation than raw data and present the data in a form that often enables the
problem to be obvious.
Cause and effect: Fishbone Diagrams
As you probe the nature of a problem and ask the 5 Whys, you’ll begin
to paint a mental picture of which causes are affecting what outcomes.
You represent this graphically in what’s known as a Cause-and-Effect (C&E)
Diagram.
This diagram is also known as an Ishikawa Diagram, named after Kaoru
Ishikawa, who first applied them in the shipyards of Kobe, Japan, in the
1940s. A C&E Diagram is also sometimes called a Fishbone Diagram, after its
graphical appearance.
181
Chapter 9: Perfection Tools

The C&E Diagram enables you to represent the influences and connections on
a particular outcome. Figure 9-3 is a generalized C&E Diagram that exemplifies
the categories and subcategories that can make up the chain of causation.
A C&E Diagram is simple to create and apply. You can draw one on a white-
board or the back of a napkin. You simply identify the major categories of
influence on an outcome. Within those categories, you indicate the causes
and how they connect. The C&E Diagram immediately presents a picture of
all the causes and contributions to an outcome, and suggests the next level of
probing and analysis.
The C&E Diagram aids the 5 Whys and affinity exercises, because it helps
probe cause and also categorizes and aligns the influences.
Pareto Charts: Finding the significant few
A Pareto Chart is a special type of bar chart where the values are arranged in
descending order, with the largest contribution first. It is named after the
Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who discovered the “80-20 rule” now also
known as the Pareto Principle (the principle that 20 percent of the causes are
responsible for 80 percent of the outcomes). The Pareto Chart is a fast and
effective way to identify the significant influences — and separate them from
the insignificant ones.

To make a Pareto Chart, you simply stack up observations with the greatest
values on the left, and observations with decreasing values onward to the
right. Figure 9-4 is an example that shows categories of cost in an expenditure
profile. From this chart, you can easily see the significance of each cost ele-
ment to the total — and that salaries are the largest contributor, with equip-
ment second, and everything else minor by comparison.
As shown in Figure 9-4, a Pareto Chart shows both the absolute number as
well as the percentage of contribution. The right vertical axis indicates per-
centage, and a line is plotted that depicts the cumulative percentage total, up
to 100 percent with the last rightmost item. From the figure, you can quickly

Check Sheets: Capture and see
A Check Sheet is basically any standard way you can gather data and view an
activity as it’s happening. The name comes from the historical use of a piece
of paper or chart on which someone would indicate activity and check it as it
was occurring. Figure 9-5 shows an example of a Check Sheet.
You can set up Check Sheets for a variety of uses:
 Tallying: Simply count up the occurrences of an event, such as runners
crossing the finish line.
 Defective items: Mark the occurrence of defects by category.
 Process distribution: Indicate the occurrence of an event by value. This
will build a Histogram.
 Location plot: Mark the location of an event on a graphical depiction.
 Defective location plot: Mark the location of a defect.
 Causation: Indicate the likely cause of events as they occur.
 Work sampling: Indicate how time is spent by category.

Scatter Plots: Relationships at a glance
A Scatter Plot is the simplest of all plots — and yet, it’s also sometimes the
most revealing. It graphical depicts the relationship between two items or
variables (see Figure 9-6).
Making a Scatter Plot is easy. You simply draw and label a couple of axes and
plot the data. Then sit back and look at it. What do you see? Is there a trend
(known as correlation), or is it just random? Based on what you’re seeing, you
can draw conclusions about what’s likely to occur next.
The Scatter Plot shows at a glance whether a relationship exists between the
two variables, and what the nature of that relationship might be. The number
of dots on the plot indicates how much data you’ve collected — the more
data, the more valid the observations.
In this example, there’s an obvious correlation between year and local index.
Further analyses would indicate the nature of that correlation.

Bar Charts: How things stack up
The Bar Chart is a great way to see the differences between items in a small
set of related data. Bar Charts are enormously popular, easy to make, and
easy to read. Figure 9-7 shows an example of a Bar Chart.
Each entry is a count of the data for that category, and is displayed in a verti-
cal column as a rectangular solid bar that is proportional to its value. A
common variation on the Bar Chart is called a Stacked Bar Chart, where two
or more items that make up the value are displayed independently. Figure 9-8
contains a Stacked Bar Chart.
In a Bar Chart, you look at the tallest and shortest, to understand the range,
and get a sense for the mean and the deviations. You look at the bars relative
to one another, to get a sense of trends, correlations, or other relationships.
From the Bar Chart, you’ll have a sense of what to examine or look for next. It
turns out that that new surfing movie was released last Friday!
Histograms: Frequency of occurrence
A Histogram is a type of Bar Chart that is organized to show counts of how
frequently something occurs. In a Histogram, each bar is of equal width and
represents a fixed range of measurement. Over a period of time, you can
easily see how the data is distributed (see Figure 9-9).

Control Charts: “Make it so”
The Control Chart (see Figure 9-10) is considered the single most important
tool of statistical quality control. The Control Chart was developed by Dr.
Walter Shewhart of Bell Labs in the 1920s as a statistical means for under-
standing manufacturing processes and improving their effectiveness. It
serves as the basis for determining whether a process is in or out of statisti-
cal control.
The Control Chart is a graphical display of the value of some process or qual-
ity characteristic over time. It displays the running value of the item, and usu-
ally includes the centerline target value as well as the upper and lower
control limits.
Typically, as long as the sample values fall between the upper and lower con-
trol limits, the process is “in control.” However, if the distribution of values is
systematic and non-random, this is an indication of a special cause of varia-
tion, indicating that the process is not in statistical control and should be
examined further.
Figure 9-10:
A Control
Chart.
188
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

A collection of the sample values in the Control Chart over time will form a
Histogram, as well as permit statistical analysis of the variation in the perfor-
mance of the quality characteristic.
Computer Tools
Numerous software tools for data analysis have been developed in recent
years. Other tools can capture and display information. These tools are
increasingly sophisticated and capable. You can use these tools with confi-
dence in supporting your work.
See Chapter 10 for a more detailed discussion of computer tools that support
Lean implementation.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the big picture
 Managing everyday Lean
 Integrating technology tools
L
ean is a strategic initiative. You undertake Lean because it makes good
business and financial sense as a long-term direction for your organiza-
tion. Yet, Lean requires not just a strategic vision, but a daily commitment to
improvement. You need to have the right measurement system. You need to
closely watch the short-term and long-term metrics. You need to learn from
your experiences — both the successes and the failures. And you need for
everyone to be actively involved on a daily basis.
Without the attention of management and the leadership of executives, the
changes developed in a Lean implementation are not sustainable. In this
chapter, we introduce you to tools that support the development and track-
ing of the business strategy, tactical initiatives, and the overall performance
of the business.
Like other aspects of Lean, managerial tools are visual. Along with the cus-
tomer and value-stream tools in Chapter 7, the flow and pull tools described
in Chapter 8, and the perfection tools in Chapter 9, these tools make up the
overall Lean toolbox. You need all these tools to support Lean practices.
The chapter concludes with a general discussion of software tools that sup-
port Lean implementation. Although Lean is about simplicity and the elimina-
tion of waste, it is also about the appropriate implementation of technology.
Follow a philosophy of: simplify and/or eliminate, then automate and inte-
grate. This will help guide the management team to the appropriate level of
technology implementation.

Managing Strategy
A successful management team manages both the long-term strategy of the
organization and the tactical, day-to-day activities of the business. It’s the same
in a successful Lean organization. Creating the master plan and measuring
everyday progress to that plan is essential. In keeping with Lean fundamentals,
the process of strategy development, deployment, and measurement should be
simple and visual.
Strategy and measurement tools are plentiful in the marketplace, and the
ones included in this section align with the tenets of Lean. The Plan-Do-
Check-Act (PDCA) cycle central to Kaizen also provides a great foundation
for strategy development and implementation. Collectively, these tools help
the management team effectively lead their organization through the Lean
transformation.
In all that you do, your mantra should be “Simplify, eliminate, automate, then
integrate.” Lean is all about simplifying, eliminating waste, applying technol-
ogy appropriately, and identifying ways to integrate functions or processes.
Management teams often fall prey to consultants or IT vendors offering the
latest and greatest whiz-bang solutions to all their problems. Automating bad
business practices will not fix your problems. Magic wands do not exist.
Whether developing strategy, performing Kaizen activities, or evaluating
technology, don’t stray from the essence of Lean: eliminate waste in every-
thing you do.
Hoshin: Balanced planning
The term hoshin kanri means “direction setting.” The Lean planning system
built around it is known as hoshin planning or policy deployment. In hoshin,
the organization makes plans and then conducts a regular standardized self-
analysis. The results provide inputs for updating the plan.
Hoshin planning is a two-pronged approach of a) strategic planning and align-
ment, and b) everyday operations fundamentals. The goal of hoshin planning
is to ensure that the organization is developing its longer-term (two- to five-
year) objectives and strategies, as well as managing short-term everyday
business execution. It is also fundamentally based on the principle that you
achieve the best results when everyone in the organization fully understands
the goals and is involved in the planning processes to achieve them.
Using the new seven tools of quality control (see Chapter 7) helps you to
process background information as you create your hoshin plans.
192
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Hoshin planning, to be truly effective, must also be cross-functional, promot-
ing cooperation along the value stream, within and between business func-
tions. The different departments of an organization must support each other
in order to achieve the remarkable results only possible through synergy and
cooperation.
Understanding the hoshin planning process
Hoshin planning systematizes strategic planning. The format of the plans is
unified via standards and measured through tables. This standardization pro-
vides a structured approach for developing and producing the organization’s
strategic plan. The structure and standards also enable an efficient way to
link the strategic plan through the organization. This ultimately leads to an
organization-wide understanding of not just the plan but also the planning
process.
Hoshin planning is a seven-step process, in which you perform the following
management tasks:
1. Identify the key business issues facing the organization.
2. Establish measurable business objectives that address these issues.
3. Define the overall vision and goals.
4. Develop supporting strategies for pursuing the goals.
In the Lean organization, this strategy includes the use of Lean methods
and techniques.
5. Determine the tactics and objectives that facilitate each strategy.
6. Implement performance measures for every business process.
7. Measure business fundamentals.
Be sure you identify the critical business issues confronting the organization
and select an objective and goal that will overcome the issues. To develop a
complete plan and to guide the organization, you must identify supporting
strategies with measures and owners.
Setting the hoshin tables
Plans don’t collect dust on a shelf somewhere; you check them regularly
against actual performance. The hoshin process employs a standardized set
of reports, known as tables, in the review process. These reports are used by
managers and work teams to assess performance. Each table includes
 A header, showing the author and scope of the plan
 The situation, to give meaning to the planned items
193
Chapter 10: Management Tools

 The objective (what is to be achieved)
 Milestones that will show when the objective is achieved
 Strategies for how the objectives are achieved
 Measures to check that the strategies are being achieved
The different hoshin tables are
 Hoshin review table: During reviews, plans are presented in the form of
standardized hoshin review tables, each of which shows a single objec-
tive and its supporting strategies. A group or individual responsible for
several objectives generates several review tables in order to cover all
objectives.
 Strategy implementation table: Implementation plans are used to iden-
tify the tactics or action plans needed to accomplish each strategy.
Implementation plans usually present the following information:
• The tactics needed to implement the strategy
• The people involved in each tactic and their exact responsibilities
• The timeline of each tactic, usually presented as a Gantt Chart (a
time-phased graphical representation of project activities and
tasks).
• Performance measures
• How and when the implementation plans will be reviewed
 Business fundamentals table (BFT): Business fundamentals, or the basic
elements that define the success of a key business process, are moni-
tored through its corresponding metrics. Examples of business funda-
mentals are safety, people, quality, responsiveness, or cost. BFT figures
must be in control before the long-term strategies are attended to.
 Annual planning table (APT): Record the organization’s objectives and
strategies in the annual planning table. The APT is then passed down to
the next organizational structure. This pass-down process flows through-
out the entire organization. Each level develops its plan to support the
overall top level organizational plan.
The real change occurs when you’re clear about the assignment of responsi-
bility for every item in the implementation plans.
Making the annual plan
Senior leadership is ultimately responsible for establishing the strategies,
goals and process performance measures to address the organization’s
issues for the coming year. Some organizations have been successful at using
issue teams or management quality teams. These teams consist of the func-
tional managers and senior leaders most involved with a particular issue.
194
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Together, they formulate objectives and strategies to best address the critical
business issues at hand.
The organization’s leadership should be convinced that successfully imple-
menting the selected strategies will make it possible to achieve objectives
and resolve issues.
Record the organization’s objective and strategies in the annual planning
table. The APT is then passed down to the next organizational structure. 
As the plans cascade through the organization, the strategies of one level
become the objectives of the next level down in the organization. This pro-
vides direction and hierarchical linkage to the plan’s highest level. At each
succeeding level, strategies are owned, expanded, and turned into implemen-
tation plans that contribute to reaching the objective and the overall goal.
As each succeeding level accepts its portion of the plan, it has been involved
in the plan’s development by adding detail where it can best contribute and
add value. This is also how the organization buys into the plan; it now has
some ownership of the plan itself. The hoshin methodology is a strategic
planning process with the built-in ability to empower the organization.
Implementing hoshin
The implementation do process includes the execution of the hoshin activi-
ties, along with the timelines and checkpoints for specific events. Use the
implementation plan as an ongoing decision-making tool. Plot or note the
actual performance to plan along the planned events and checkpoints.
Include how and when the plan will be reviewed.
The implementation plan usually requires coordination both within and
between departments and process owners. Implementation plans are not just
the responsibility of an individual completing the lowest-level annual plan.
Each level in the organization carries detailed responsibilities to ensure sup-
port for and successful completion of the organization’s plans. This is how
the do step of PDCA happens.
The annual hoshin review
Because hoshin is a cyclic process, the review of the previous year’s perfor-
mance is the basis for the next year’s plan.
 For those objectives that were completed successfully, perform an
analysis to determine what went right and to determine if the supporting
strategies and performance measures initially established were truly
appropriate. Also, note any exceptional results and how they were
obtained. This step is critical to capturing knowledge of how to exceed
goals, and then transferring that knowledge to the organization.
195
Chapter 10: Management Tools

 For each objective that was not attained, determine the reasons for the
deviation. Typically, the analysis consists of the detailed supporting
data of all strategies associated with the objective. The strategy owners
also should identify what their teams would have changed to have been
more successful in the year just completed as well as for the future. This
process of both looking back at the past and ahead to the future is the
key to improving organizational learning. It can greatly benefit the orga-
nization in identifying future opportunities.
These reviews are conducted at all levels of the organization. Starting at the
lowest level that has plan ownership, the review is completed and the infor-
mation passed up the organizational structure (management levels). Each
level then uses the review tables from previous structures (management
levels) to complete its own review. Discussions between the different struc-
tures of the organization are very important and should result in consensus
on the review table results.
In addition to listing objectives from the previous year’s plan, the review
table can call attention to important issues for the coming year. When the
review reaches the senior management team, the hoshin review tables high-
light the areas in which the organization made significant progress and
attained the identified goal, and where changes should be made or more
work is needed.
The review is completed using information from:
 Hoshin review tables
 Corporate objectives
 Business plans
 Economic projections
 Customer inputs
 A quality assessment (if conducted)
The senior management team can determine whether last year’s critical busi-
ness issues and business objectives (which were selected to address the
issues) are still appropriate for the coming year. This also is the time to make
sure the organization is providing value to its customers as described by the
purpose. Finally, consider whether the vision for the organization is still
appropriate for business conditions.
Reviewing progress periodically
Although the planning cycle is annual, you don’t just make the plan then
forget about it until next year. Review business fundamental metrics monthly
to ensure that performance is trending in the right direction. Review the
annual plan quarterly to ensure that the plan is still the right plan.
196
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

If the metrics aren’t trending in the right direction, identify countermeasures
to get the plan back on track. The actions may comprise as many as three
phases:
 Alleviating the immediate problem with an emergency countermeasure.
 Preventing the problem from recurring with a short-term fix.
 Determining and removing the problem’s root cause. This is the perma-
nent solution that will prevent the problem from recurring.
The final annual review is essentially a compilation and summary of the
hoshin review tables accumulated during the year. This final review returns
you to the study step described earlier. The study step plays a crucial role in
improving organizational learning ability. When actual performance and
results are compared and a deviation-from-plan analysis is completed, those
closest to the strategy make visible to the organization’s leaders a great deal
of information.
Reflection — analyzing what went right or what went wrong in each strategy —
is an important aspect of management reviews. Determining objectively which
strategies and actions worked and which strategies and actions need improve-
ment because they failed to hit their targets is required in the organization’s
learning process. This is not a blame session. Focus on the strategies and
actions, before you point fingers.
The Balanced Scorecard
Organizations are traditionally measured on their financial performance.
Corporations report revenues, costs, and earnings; nonprofits measure
fundraising; government organizations track budgets. And though the num-
bers are very important, everyone knows that numbers are only one of sev-
eral indicators of the true health and status of the organization. In order to
create a more balanced picture, Harvard researcher Dr. Robert Kaplan and
his colleague Dr. David Norton developed a concept in the early 1990s called
the Balanced Scorecard.
Kaplan and Norton recognized that a retrospective on financial performance
alone is a wholly inadequate way to measure and guide organizations in the
emerging postindustrial information age. It is both impractical and inappropri-
ate to use financials as the sole basis for evaluating and managing the broad
spectrum of customers, employees, suppliers, and distributors, as well as the
processes and technologies that enable a modern enterprise. Something more
holistic is needed.
As Kaplan and Norton formalized it, the Balanced Scorecard is a framework
for both evaluating and managing an organization along the lines of four dis-
tinct perspectives: financial (of course), but also customer, process, and
197
Chapter 10: Management Tools

learning. Figure 10-1 shows the conceptual framework. In the Balanced
Scorecard approach, the organization creates measurable indicators in each
of the four areas, which are used both to track progress as well as manage
achievement toward its vision. Simple and easy to understand, the Balanced
Scorecard has been applied in some form as a standardized system of mea-
surement in over half of the world’s companies.
Balanced Scorecard basics
The underlying framework for the Balanced Scorecard methodology is built
on many of the same principles as Lean, including the following:
 Focus on the customer and, in particular, on the fact that the customer
defines quality
 Structured application of measurements and controls
 Quality at the source
 Continuous improvement, through measurement and controlled feedback.
 Engagement, empowerment, and development of employees

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Consistent with hoshin, the Balanced Scorecard incorporates the outputs from
internal business processes as well as from vision and strategy planning. It
requires the organization to develop metrics based on strategic planning pri-
orities, as well as the operational business fundamentals. This enables every-
one to observe the outcomes of the measured processes and strategies and
track the results to guide the organization and provide feedback.
Scorecard sections
The standard Balanced Scorecard contains four cards — one each for cus-
tomer, financials, processes, and learning. They are purposely interdepen-
dent, forming a holistic view of the enterprise:
 Customer: The customer card focuses on the measures that demon-
strate the ability of the organization to provide quality goods and ser-
vices, effective delivery, and overall customer satisfaction. This includes
both internal and external customers.
 Financial: The financials card mirrors that of most top-level financial
reports, consistent with the nature of the enterprise (public, private,
nonprofit, governmental).
 Process: The internal process card reports on the status and perfor-
mance of the key business processes that constitute the core business
functions (that is, what generates value for the customer).
 Learning: The final card is a report on the learning, development, and
growth elements of the people, systems, and culture of the organization.
This includes skills, communications, motivation, and agility.
You can easily see how the standard Balanced Scorecard would reflect the
status and performance of a Lean organization. For this reason, the Balanced
Scorecard is an acceptable tool of measure and works synergistically in a
Lean enterprise.
Create your scorecard to fit your organization. Although the standard Balanced
Scorecard is prescriptive, you may find it more beneficial to track categories
like safety, people, quality, responsiveness, and cost. Find the right fundamen-
tal business metrics for your organization and review them on a frequent 
basis — at least monthly (see Chapter 9).
BAM! BAM! Management dashboards
The concept of the executive dashboard was first introduced in the mid
1980s. Known at that time as executive information systems (EIS), they were
intended to provide a rollup of operating information for regular examination
by company executives. Instead of having to wait for end-of-the-month
199
Chapter 10: Management Tools

reports, executives could see the information as it was happening, right there
in full-color charts and tables on their PCs. Due to high costs and technology
limitations, EISs were cumbersome and saw limited success at the time. But
they were a great idea! They marked the first attempt at providing near-real
time feedback from the far reaches of the shop floor to the lofty halls of
mahogany row.
These have evolved now into the more ubiquitous and useful tool known as
the management dashboard, also called BAM, short for business activity
monitoring. Refer to Figure 10-2. These dashboards are now far-reaching tools
that allow anyone in the organization to monitor key processes and track per-
formance at nearly any level as it is occurring. Management dashboards are
flexible and easily customized to provide anyone the view of what matters
most to them — as well as what matters most to everyone else.
Courtesy of webMethods
A management dashboard can be as simple or as complex as necessary.
Dashboards can display everything from pie charts, maps, and histograms to
run charts and control charts with upper and lower spec limits.
In keeping with Lean, your dashboard should be simple to read and visual in
presentation.
Dashboards help people in organizations quickly access information and
apply analytics. Once strictly captive to the domain of IT specialists, business
users can now quickly define, monitor, and analyze key performance indica-
tors (KPIs) on their own. This enables an organization to not only monitor
the fundamental business processes in real time, but also understand the
context of local operations within the realm of larger strategic objectives.
Many organizations are now deploying management dashboards in more
sophisticated and intricate application contexts, such as with a customized
analytic application or even as an extranet that reaches beyond the corpo-
rate boundaries and provides views into the contributions of suppliers or
deliverers to the value stream. This transcends standard analytical applica-
tions, which historically provided little more than modestly structured “buck-
ets of reports.”

Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Dashboards are useful in other ways as well:
 Operational fulfillment: Management dashboards can focus the entire
organization on a core set of objectives and process indicators. Everyone
can track indicators that exist beyond their function or work module,
observing their local effects on broad-scale performance.
 User needs: Regardless of function — from senior-most management to
shop-floor workers — everyone can easily absorb the highly visual pre-
sentation of a management dashboard. It is instantaneous broadband
communication of everything from andon-like operational alerts to spe-
cialized analyses.
 Supportable: The IT function within enterprises can now more easily
than ever provide the infrastructure and support needed to deliver this
information. Dashboards are fast to construct and flexible for rapid mod-
ification. Middleware technology and the emergence of service-oriented
architectures (SOA) enable connectivity and delivery that doesn’t
require extensive custom programming.
With the broad deployment of management dashboards and related 
performance-management tools, organizations are finding that their objec-
tives and metrics are easier than ever to monitor, manage, and improve. 
This, in turn, enables Kaizen and permits organizations to strive toward even
higher performance goals. Business performance becomes an upward spiral
that enables an enterprise to strive for ever-higher performance goals.
Creepy, crawly spider charts
Spider charts, also know as radar charts, are radial plots of several perfor-
mance measures in a single display. Spider charts are effective at showing the
performance of several performance characteristics in a single graph (see
Figure 10-3 for an example).
Spider charts are popular in Lean because they’re graphical, they’re visual,
and they communicate information rapidly. With a spider chart, you can do
things like:
 Graphically observe the performance of business metrics to a set goal.
 Observe the relative value of different suppliers.
 Make logical comparisons between competing strategies or approaches.
 Instantly see the strengths and weaknesses between alternatives.
201
Chapter 10: Management Tools

Even if you’ve never used a spider chart before, don’t worry — it’s easy.
Follow this quick process:
1. Identify the information you want to compare.
2. Generate a list of approximately five to ten evaluation criteria.
3. Score the alternatives for each of the criteria.
4. Draw the chart, and identify as many axis arms (spokes) as there are
criteria.
5. Label the spoke arms of the chart — one arm for each criterion, and
put hash marks on each spoke that represent counts.
6. Score a given alternative on each axis arm — and connect the dots
with a straight line.
7. Repeat for each alternative. When you finish, it looks like a spider web.

When using a spider chart to track progress to a goal, fill in the space repre-
senting the actual performance. This will help you to visualize how far you
have to go.
Now observe the results and analyze the chart. What do you see? Look at the
balance, the extremes, and the total area within each score. Spider charts are
a powerful and revealing graphical tool.
When using a spider chart to compare alternatives, limit the number of items
you’re comparing on any individual chart. It’s easy to see a few, but when you
get much past five or six, you’ll get lost. Refer to Figure 10-4 for an example of a
more complex spider chart. You don’t want them any more complex than this.

Chapter 10: Management Tools

Go and See
Lean managers know that they can’t effectively lead their organizations from
their office. They need to be where the action is — to build relationships, to
understand the real issues, and to set performance expectations. You can
create the most eloquent annual plan, but without the day-to-day activities
and involvement, those plans will be mere pipe dreams.
However, leaving the office isn’t enough. The tools of this section create a
framework for these managerial activities. Gemba walks, for example, aren’t
random strolls through an area — they’re focused on Lean implementation,
safety, quality, or some other perspective. Whether conducted by an individ-
ual or team of people, the intention of a gemba review is clear.
Communication centers display vital information to the people working in 
the area as well as any visitors. Customer, performance, and company infor-
mation are displayed in a visual manner and kept current by the team (see
Chapter 9).
At any level, the best way to know what is going on in the business is to “go
and see.”
Genchi genbutsu
One of the fundamentals of the Toyota way is called genchi genbutsu. In short,
this means “go to the actual scene (genchi) and confirm the actual happen-
ings or things (genbutsu).”
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell returned from the ruins of the Asian
tsunami of 2005. He said he had never seen such devastation and immedi-
ately pledged further assistance. After the visit, the pledge of aid increased
more than tenfold from the initial U.S. White House statement released imme-
diately after the disaster on December 26, 2005. Things look a lot different
from ground zero.
The power of genchi genbutsu is in the firsthand knowledge that you gain. It’s
one thing to look at a report, see a bunch of numbers, and draw conclusions.
It’s a totally different experience to go to an area and see what the numbers
mean. A purchasing manager may believe she’s cut a sweetheart of a deal
with a supplier, but not understand what that supplier’s product does to the
quality and reliability of the production process. Gaining the firsthand knowl-
edge of the process will help that manager make better deals for the com-
pany, not just her department.
204
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

Gemba walks
Gemba is where you go when you “go and see.” Gemba is where the action is —
where value is created for the customer. It is the kitchen in a restaurant, the
operating room in a hospital, or a retail floor in a store. Gemba is where the real
business occurs. If you don’t go to gemba, you’ll never truly understand the
business or its issues.
One management tool is the gemba walk or observation tour. This is not a
“run through that area, wave hello, and get back to your office” tour. The key
is to be observant and to ask questions about things you notice. During a
gemba walk, you may focus on a single item, like safety, housekeeping, perfor-
mance, or Lean implementation. For example, if quick changeovers are a pri-
ority to your organization, find out when setups will happen and go watch
them. Can you suggest additional improvements?
Though gemba walks aren’t scripted, you must set a main intention for the
walk. If the theme of the day is safety, you’ll observe everything about safety,
from employee actions to metric performance to the condition and location
of safety equipment.
You may be wondering, “What do I do on a gemba walk?” Here’s a list:
 Build relationships with the organization and break down barriers to
change.
 Learn to observe your organization with “Lean” eyes. Initially, go on
gemba walks with your Lean sensei (see Chapter 12) to learn what and
how to observe.
 Train others to observe by conducting regular and frequent walks — as
a staff and with individual staff members. Have individual staff members
shadow you — it’s a powerful way of educating them.
 Review performance metrics as tied to the hoshin plan.
 Review A3s, team performance charts, andon status, housekeeping, and
display boards (see Chapter 9) at communication centers.
An A3 is a one-page report of an issue and resolution plan. It’s named
after the international paper A3 paper size. On one page, all the salient
information is recorded in sketches or words: the issue, before condi-
tion, after condition, action plan, cost, responsible parties, and results.
 Talk to people. Seek to understand what they do and what their issues
are. Ask about what you’re seeing. — they’re the experts at their job
function. Most people love to talk about what they do.
 When possible, connect the global issues and strategy of the company
with the issues of gemba. Help people make the connection.
205
Chapter 10: Management Tools

You can build a rapport with your organization while you’re on a gemba walk.
Listen to their issues and take action to help them out. Over time, you’ll earn
their respect and build trust. Eventually, they’ll look for you during the walks
to recommend improvements and give you feedback.
Housekeeping tours are a good way for management to accomplish several
goals:
 Stress the importance of the orderly environment.
 Practice a form of standardized work.
 Connect with the organization.
Management tours should cover the entire facility, inside and out. They
should also follow a set process, including an established checklist of items
to review, an agenda, and facility route (including restrooms and safety equip-
ment). Nonconformances should be recorded and addressed. These items
should be followed up on the next tour.
Software and Information Management
More and more software tools are available to facilitate all manner of business-
process improvement, analysis, management, and whatnot. These tools are
increasingly broad ranging and capable. Software poses a bit of a conundrum
to the Lean practitioner, however, because software is complex, and complex-
ity is an anathema to Lean. Furthermore, you risk becoming captive to the tool,
which is also a Lean no-no. However, a well-designed software program can
enable your staff to perform both tactical and strategic tasks faster and more
accurately, thereby reducing several forms of waste.
Per Lean doctrine, keep your computer and software application usage as
streamlined and simple as possible. That may sound like an oxymoron, but
you can contain the size, scope, and proliferation of your computer applica-
tions. Use them where they’re needed.
Lean facilitation software
You can apply software to the practice of Value Stream Mapping and related
Lean activities. Leading tools include iGrafx Flowcharter (www.igrafx.com),
eVSM (www.evsm.com), and LeanView (www.osgi.com). These tools also
206
Part III: The Lean Toolbox 

offer additional features, including process mapping, simulation, and some
analytical capabilities.
These tools are “desktop” tools that run only on personal computers running
the Microsoft Windows operating system. Some of these tools have networked
versions with centralized repositories for shared file use and configuration
management.
Statistics and graphical analysis
The seven basic tools of quality addressed in Chapter 9, as well as the larger
universe of statistical and analytical tools, are aptly facilitated by well-
established providers. If you look in the Start menu of your PC, you’ll likely
find one of them: Microsoft Excel which (http://office.microsoft.com/
excel) performs most all of the basic statistical analysis functions for you.
Excel can be programmed to do more, and add-on products like SigmaXL
(www.sigmaxl.com) will provide nearly all of what mere mortals will ever
need.
For more high-powered statistics and analysis, there’s Minitab (www.minitab.
com), the king of desktop data analysis and statistics software. If you need
more than basic statistics, such as regression analysis, analysis of variance
(ANOVA), statistical process control (SPC), measurement systems analysis
(MSA), design of experiments (DoE), reliability analysis, multivariate analysis,
and non-parametrics, Minitab is the tool for you! Minitab also comes with a
Quality Companion tool that performs process mapping, Fishbone Diagrams,
FMEA, Value Stream Map comparisons, and more. It has extensive online
guidance, coaching, and tutorials.
As great as these tools are, SigmaXL and Minitab run only on the Windows
operating system. Excel is available for the Macintosh. An excellent alterna-
tive for Mac and Linux users, as well as multiplatform environments, is JMP
software (www.jmp.com) from the SAS Institute.
Business Process Management
One of the most powerful forces to emerge in the enterprise-level software
world since 2000 is a suite known as BPM — Business Process Management.
BPM enables you to define processes that cross functional lines, integrating
numerous back-end systems like ERP, MRP, CRM, and others, and track them
as they perform.
207
Chapter 10: Management Tools

BPM systems support process modeling, data capture, data analysis, and
process control functions. They perform andon, facilitate the development
and real-time display of management dashboards (BAM), and even build
Balanced Scorecards. In short, BPM will enhance the Lean enterprise.
BPM is at present an enterprise-class application and is not yet available for
independent small businesses. The genre is new enough that it’s crowded
with startups, and the large well-known enterprise vendors have yet to estab-
lish a clear and present direction. Until the industry matures and consoli-
dates, there are no obvious leaders. But make no mistake, BPM is a key
enabler of the Lean enterprise of the future!

Enterprise

In this part . . .
T
he successful Lean transition is not only about the
things you do, but also about how you overcome chal-
lenges. Some people will be resistant to change — as a
group or as individuals. In this part, you discover how to
address change, see how to implement Lean in different
parts of the business, and understand how Lean organiza-
tions look across different industries.

Chapter 11
Lean in the Organization:
Principles, Behaviors, 
and Change
In This Chapter
 Probing the current cultural climate
 Aligning behaviors to Lean principles
 Understanding the phases of organizational change
You are part of one or more organizations. An organization is a group of
people arranged and structured to achieve a purpose. It could be a busi-
ness purpose (for example, to develop or provide goods and services to cus-
tomers for a profit). It could be another purpose (such as education, govern-
ment, or personal or nonprofit contributions to humanity); for example, a
family is a type of organization.
No matter what the purpose of the organization, the people within that orga-
nization and their conduct collectively define the organization’s principles and
guide the individuals’ behaviors. The people give the organization its culture.
An organization’s culture and the principles that drive people’s behaviors ulti-
mately determine the degrees of an organization’s performance, quality, and
success. Think about famous organizational cultures — like J. M Smucker,
Hewlett-Packard, Nordstrom, EDS (Electronic Data Systems), the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA), or Enron — and how they’ve performed.
In each of these cases — as in the case of every organization — people’s
behaviors have both steered and been steered directly by the principles and
belief systems fostered from within and spread across the organizational
landscape . . . for better or for worse.

Organizational cultures are deeply ingrained. The principles guiding the behav-
iors of the people within an organization are purposefully long-lived and slow
to change. Organizational culture has mass: The larger it is and the faster it’s
going, the more momentum it builds. This trait is a good thing when that
momentum is carrying you in the right direction, but not so good when you
wander off-course.
Few organizations are born and raised as Lean organizations, so if you’re now
embarking upon a Lean journey, you’re likely in the process of changing
course. This means that in addition to applying the methods and techniques
described in the rest of this book, you will also be changing the organiza-
tional culture by changing principles and behaviors. In order to determine
just how much change is needed, first you have to understand how your
organization’s current principles and behaviors align with Lean principles
and behaviors. The extent of the gap between the two will help you under-
stand what changes are required and how to make them. As with any change,
the methods, the frequency, and the messenger will influence the organiza-
tion’s response.
In this chapter, we tell you all about the organizational principles and behav-
iors that reflect a Lean organization. We show you how to assess an organiza-
tion’s true principles and behaviors versus its stated principles. You will
understand how to compare your current organization’s principles to Lean
principles, and get a feel for a basic organizational change model. Finally, you
will identify a road map to close the gaps.
Many analysts and pundits use the term values in defining and describing
organizational culture and principles. In the Lean world, the term value is
more directly associated with the concept of what the customer values and
adding value within a process or work activity. To avoid confusion in this
chapter, when we want to refer to organizational culture and principles, we
use the word principles.
Assessing Organizational Culture
Before you can change your organizational culture, you have to understand
the culture in reality. In this section, we tell you how to assess the current
organizational climate, compare it to Lean principles, and identify the gap
that exists between the two.
Will the real principles please stand up?
Most organizations have both a stated set of principles and an implied set of
principles. Collectively, these form the foundation of virtues and beliefs that
212
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

reinforce the integrity and character upon which everyone — including
employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, analysts, and consumers —
depends.
The stated principles are often a flowery list of words, hung on a wall or occu-
pying a page on the employee Web site. Most organizations address such
hallmarks as customer service, trust, teamwork, diversity, honesty, and
respect for people in their cadre of principles. No doubt an expensive team of
high-level people spent the better part of a retreat session precisely chiseling
those idealistic words into a lofty statement of principles — only to find that,
in reality, they’re mostly unknown or ignored within the organization.
The implied principles are often not quite so formalized. They’re typically not
the ones printed and framed — instead, they’re implied by the behaviors,
attitudes, and words of the individuals who drive the organization’s culture.
New hires are infected with the implied principles and belief systems before
they even finish the orientation class. The implied principles are the basis for
the real belief system in an organization.
The implied principles are often at odds with the stated ones. This discrepancy
causes tension and conflict across the organization. If “respect for people” is
a stated principle, but people are poorly treated or fired indiscriminately,
your principles are at odds. If “trust” is a stated principle, but people are con-
stantly second-guessed and overruled, you have trouble. “Integrity” was one
of Enron’s stated principles, but it’s pretty obvious that the real set of princi-
ples resulted in behavior of a different sort.
Getting the culture to the starting line
If you’re beginning the Lean journey, you have to know where your organiza-
tion stands as the journey begins. Identify the current principles and beliefs,
and assess what needs to change before you embark. You have organizational
baggage accompanying you on your journey. The culture fairy is not going to
wave a magic wand and instantly change the entire climate and culture of the
organization — you’ll have to work at it.
Most organizations have undertaken many initiatives before trying Lean. An
organization’s normal reaction is to resist change, hoping that “this too shall
pass” — you’ll hear people grouse about needing to do their “real job.” Keep
in mind that these attitudes are part of your current state. Your past track
record will influence your organization’s acceptance of another new initiative.
Begin by assessing the current state of the organization. Then you can iden-
tify the gaps that could thwart your Lean efforts.
213
Chapter 11: Lean in the Organization: Principles, Behaviors, and Change

Identifying the current state of the organization
Taking stock of organizational culture is a squishy task: By its very nature, it’s
imprecise. Even though organizational culture is difficult to define, as Supreme
Court Justice Potter Stewart once said, “You’ll know it when you see it.” Seeing
the condition of an organization’s culture and its readiness for change isn’t
difficult when you know what to look for.
Begin your assessment of the current situation by asking questions. You can use
several mechanisms to gather data; organizational questionnaires, observation
studies, electronic surveys, and employing outside observers or interviewers
are all options to gather information on the current organizational climate.
Here are some questions to start your assessment:
 What are the officially stated principles and beliefs of the organization?
 What organizational behaviors support those stated principles?
 What behaviors suggest a different set of beliefs?
 What implied principles can you identify?
 Where are the stated and implied principles at odds? Where are they
consistent?
 How would you describe the relationship between management and
non-management employees? Identify behaviors that typify the 
management/non-management relationship.
 Has the organization undergone mergers and acquisitions? If so, how
many cultures currently coexist in the current organization?
 How has the organization handled change initiatives in the past?
 When is the last time a significant improvement undertaking occurred?
How long did it last?
 Are any formal change initiatives currently active?
 How effective have these change initiatives been?
 How many members of the current organization have been involved in
the undertaking?
You cannot observe and measure any of this from your office. As with Value
Stream Mapping and Kaizen, you must go where the action is to see the true
picture. You’re trying to identify misalignments and incongruities before you
introduce a set of Lean principles. For example, if one of your stated values 
is “quality first,” but you observe defective product being shipped to meet a
delivery deadline, this is inconsistent. If “continuous improvement” is another
stated value, but every year the organization is fighting the exact same fires,
what does this tell you?
214
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

The organization’s stated principles may be close to Lean, yet the implied
principles may be across a chasm as wide as the Grand Canyon. Knowing
your gaps in your credibility will help you formulate a change strategy to sup-
port the shift from traditional operations to Lean.
Defining Lean principles in an organization
The overarching Lean principle is continuous incremental change. This is sup-
ported by to two additional categories:
 Customer satisfaction
 Respect for people
Many Lean programs and practitioners focus on the customer satisfaction
and forget that respect for people is just as important — and just as funda-
mental to the Lean enterprise. Each area contains subordinate principles, as
shown in Table 11-1.

Measuring the gap
To understand your organization’s current culture and define what Lean prin-
ciples mean to you, try creating a table comparing the current stated values
and behaviors in the organization to Lean principles and behaviors. Also
include the implied values and behaviors and how they line up to Lean princi-
ples. Table 11-2 is a reference.

A commonly used graphical tool in Lean for showing progress to a defined
goal is the spider chart. In a spider chart, the outside circle represents full
compliance or 100 percent attainment, while the center of the circle repre-
sents no compliance or 0 percent attainment. The objective is to fill in the
circle as performance increases. The spider chart in Figure 11-1 shows
progress for cultural transformation. In this example, the organization has
rated personal safety at 90 percent and value-added at 20 percent.
After you’ve assessed the organization’s culture, you’ll know where you’re
strong and where your challenges lie. The nature of the organizational
strengths and weaknesses will determine your change initiative. Going for-
ward, remember to continually assess the culture.
Changing the Organization
It’s one thing to measure organizational culture. It’s another thing to assess
organizational culture relative to Lean principles and behaviors. And it’s a
whole different animal when you begin to initiate the cultural changes to
bridge the gaps. That’s when the fun begins!
Rarely are organizations naturally prepared to begin a Lean journey. Most
often, organizations experience growing pains — organizational cultures

Chapter 11: Lean in the Organization: Principles, Behaviors, and Change

twist, contort, and usually writhe in outright pain as they grow and mature
into Lean practices. These contortions are recognizable and typically occur
in five discrete phases with each turn through the cycle of improvement. As
the Lean journey progresses, the organization generally moves through these
phases more quickly.
Everyone in the organization progresses at his own pace. Some people are
“change embracers,” some are “wait and seers,” and some are “resisters to
the end.” In the process of change, each of these factions must be treated
accordingly.
The organizational-change aspect of the Lean transformation is often ignored.
The soft side of change is too murky and political for most people. But if you
don’t pay attention to it, your Lean efforts are in danger of failure.
Going through the five phases of change
Independent of the nature of the change, an organization that’s undergoing a
transformation will move through five phases — most likely not in strict serial
order. The organization is a collection of individuals, each of whom accepts
change in his own time. So as change happens, the organization may some-
times have to go backward to go forward. As you take your next steps in the
Lean journey, you’ll go back through these phases again. The trick for man-
agement is to monitor the pulse of the organization to know in what direction
it’s morphing and evolving. When backsliding occurs, management needs to
correct the course.
When embarking upon a Lean journey, the organization has to change — 
continuously. It can’t expect to harbor its old ways and at the same time truly
implement Lean. How quickly and how readily the organization adapts to Lean
depends upon the past, the present, and how far away the organization is
from its desired future.
Phase 1: Recognition and acceptance
Recognition is the beginning of change, and acceptance completes this first
phase. Just like in your own life, an organization must recognize and accept
that today’s conditions are no longer workable.
Not until the pain of the present is greater that the pain of the uncertain future
will an organization embark upon a change of any type. Opportunity alone will
motivate only 5 percent of the population. The other 95 percent are motivated
by a fear of loss or some other significant emotional event. The critical first
step in the process is to clearly identify and communicate the need for change
until the organization recognizes and accepts the premise.
218
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Recognition usually requires letting go — letting go of a stale dream, an obso-
lete vision, or a nostalgia for the past. People are reluctant to let go — many
people cling to memories of the good old days long after they’re gone and
irrelevant. And the bigger the organization, the more difficult letting go is.
Think about a family that has outgrown its current home. The lone bathroom
is overcrowded in the morning, the kids are tripping over one another in the
bedrooms, and there’s no place to relax or do homework. But the mortgage is
affordable, the neighborhood is comfortable, and there are all the memories.
At what point does the family recognize and accept the need to make a change?
Only they can decide when the timing is right.
Phase 2: Direction and planning
After a critical mass of the organization recognizes and accepts the need for
change, the next step is to determine the new vision and set the direction for
the future. Only then can you define the action plan to move the organization
into that future.
Sometimes, the very act of painting the future vision helps cement the accep-
tance for change. When that vision relieves enough current pain and suffer-
ing, organizational buy-in improves. In the process, forward momentum
begins to build, which attracts support and ideas for the action plan.
Consider the family in the cramped house (see the preceding section). After
they accept the idea of change, the next step is to paint the vision of their
future — a vision where they have enough space and sufficient facilities to
meet their needs and better enjoy their lives together. The parents decide
that the time has come for radical change — a move to a new house. As they
discuss the move within the family, they receive input and considerations
from all family members. They create a vision of their new home and set the
direction — a target for what and where to buy. After the direction has been
set, the detailed planning phase starts. The plans include the full range of
activities required when you move into the new residence — from packing
and changing schools to utility transfers and meeting new neighbors.
Overall, the family recognizes and accepts the change, and they define the
vision and the plan. Yet each member of the family will deal with the changes
in his own way. If Trevor has to leave his baseball team in the middle of the
season, or Sara worries she’ll have trouble making new friends at a new
school, they may quietly hope that it won’t happen. Even if the planning
accounts for it, in reality, each family member will adapt in his own time.
Organizational acceptance of change is very similar to what the family experi-
ences. The direction comes from the top, but those in lower positions may feel
like they’re being forced to change. They may see the potential for long-term ben-
efits, but in the short term, they’ll be uncomfortable — if not downright unhappy.
219
Chapter 11: Lean in the Organization: Principles, Behaviors, and Change

Phase 3: Charging forward
After organizational leaders set the direction make the plans, it’s time to
charge forward and begin to execute on the plan. If you’re helping to lead the
change, you’ll look over your shoulder to see if anyone is following you. Some
will be, but others will be staying put, waiting to see what happens.
When you start to implement Lean, a range of personalities will be present —
hiders, naysayers, adapters, wait-and-seers, opportunists, and a host of other
characters. They may cause your best-laid plans to be retooled. Facilitating
organizational change requires
 Proper communications: The best way through the change is two-way
communication — not only listening but being heard (see “Propagating
the principles” later in this chapter)
 Proper behavior: Actions must match the new direction — this is vitally
important. Actions must support the vision, adhere to the principles,
and reinforce the plan. Just like in the family in the too-small house (see
“Phase 1: Recognition and acceptance,” earlier in this chapter), each
member may need something different to adapt to the new situation. But
by virtue of the move, the parents have said, “There is no going back.”
Think about the family on moving day. There are boxes everywhere. The
moving van is loaded up. Matt and Michele are hiding in hopes that mom and
dad won’t notice. Trevor is convinced that there won’t be a good baseball
team at his new school. Sara is anxious to meet new friends in the new neigh-
borhood. The dog is waiting to see what happens. Meanwhile, the parents
just want to get it over with!
Phase 4: Turmoil
The initial Lean implementation is underway. The first work area has finished
its inaugural Kaizen. Despite its successes, the rumor mill starts to churn, full
of dire predictions of job loss, doom, and gloom. The lunchroom conversation
is colored with dark clouds and reasons why “it won’t work” or “if everyone
just waits five minutes, management will be on to something else.” The first
crisis hits middle management, and they’re tempted to go back to their old
ways. Turmoil is underway. Nothing is settled. Many still doubt management’s
resolve to the Lean undertaking. No one is comfortable.
This phase is like the family starting to sort everything out in their new house.
Things invariably don’t go exactly as planned. Belongings are misplaced
because they don’t have a place in the new house. Boxes are mixed up. Maybe
the kids are waiting to see if the parents crack and decide they can go back to
their old life. The kids will be closely watching how the parents handle the
situation. The parents’ actions will either enlist or alienate the kids in the
whole moving process.
220
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Similarly, in the organization, how management addresses the rumor mill,
conducts themselves, and responds in the face of a crisis will either fuel the
negative fire or extinguish it to a pile of simmering coals. It is during this
tumultuous phase that the tone is set for the rest of the Lean journey.
Phase 5: Integration
Eventually, with commitment and consistency, proper communications and
behavior, the organization absorbs the changes and integrates the new direc-
tion into its psyche. People climb onboard and buy in to the vision of a Lean
organization. Management will have to handle — maybe even dismiss — the
small percentage of the organization that refuses to join in.
Particularly because Lean is a journey and not a destination, integration
includes an environment of continuous improvement and change. Full buy-in
across the entire organization may take years.
Like with the family settling in the new location, unpacking the boxes is really
the easy part. Everyone will find a place for their things. How each of the kids
adjusts to his new situation will be as individual as the kids are. But with per-
sistence, patience, and communication, eventually they’ll all get settled into a
new routine — until the next change.
Hurdling roadblocks to success
As with any new undertaking, organizational roadblocks develop along the
way. Some of them are cultural, some historical, and some situational. All are
rooted in the individuals of the organization and their corresponding percep-
tions, attitudes, emotions, and actions. In the following sections, we discuss
some of the common roadblocks to successful Lean implementation and cor-
responding organizational change.
Roadblock #1: Rules are made to be broken
Lean is based on the implementation of standards and performance to those
standards. It is based on processes being repeatable. Improvements can only
be made if there is a measurable baseline for comparison. The attitude that
“rules are made to be broken” is misaligned with the Lean thought process. If
the organization embraces a countercultural attitude, you’ll have challenges
on your Lean journey.
Reframe this old adage to a new one: “Standards are made to be followed and
then improved.” Adopting this new adage will go a long way toward mitigat-
ing those challenges. You must be vigilant to ensure that the standards are
being followed. When someone violates a standard, you must understand
why. If his reason is legitimate, formally adjust the standards. If his reason
221
Chapter 11: Lean in the Organization: Principles, Behaviors, and Change

isn’t legitimate, you must take appropriate action to reinforce the importance
of the standards and prescribe the consequences for violation.
Roadblock #2: Cowboy individualism
No man is an island in a Lean organization. Everyone in the value stream is
connected in some way. Cowboy individualists who buck the system, for
whatever reason, will inhibit everyone’s Lean journey. There is room for cre-
ativity and individualism if it is directed toward the elimination of waste and
improvement of the standards. There is no room for those who, on principle,
refuse to operate to the methods of standardized work.
Roadblock #3: Fear of the unknown and job loss
If management has not made guarantees that employees won’t lose their jobs
as a result of productivity improvements, the Lean journey will be a very
bumpy ride. People fear the unknown. You’re asking them to have faith that,
by actively participating in Lean, they won’t be rewarded with a pink slip. It’s
one thing to get them to trust that the concepts will work — it’s another thing
to get them to trust that it won’t negatively impact their quality of life.
Roadblock #4: Resistance to change — what’s in it for me?
In general, people resist change that isn’t their idea. They may be fearful
when it’s their idea, but if they still feel in control, they’ll make the decision
to change. But when change is foisted upon them, they feel like they have
little or no control, and they may be uncertain about the outcome. Their col-
lective resistance rises up like a tidal wave ready to crash down on the orga-
nization, stopping all forward progress. When they do not see a personal
benefit or incentive to change, they won’t.
Some of the employees will fight through; you don’t need to worry about
them — they’ll be your trailblazers. It’s the ones who can’t overcome their
resistance or fears that you’ll need to either move forward or move out.
Roadblock #5: Been there, done that
A portion of your organization will be waiting for you to fail, especially if your
organization has a track record of failed initiatives or flavor-of-the-month pro-
grams. One of the best ways to mitigate this reaction is to enlist some of the
biggest naysayers early on in the initiative. By winning them over early, you
create influential endorsers of the Lean process.
Forecasting the Future
Organizations are like supertankers: You can’t make a left turn with a super-
tanker, or it’ll roll over and sink. Turning an organization requires you to get
222
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

out the tugboats and nudge, nudge, nudge. But when the new course is set
and the engines are cranked up, you can go a long way.
The changes you make to develop a Lean organization must be constantly
nudged, carefully pointed, and supported from within. The culture will resist
at first, but with vigilance and guiding principles, the behaviors will change
and the new cultural course will be set. To ensure success, you must main-
tain the watch.
The journey that never ends
The single most powerful attribute of a Lean organization is adaptability. The
Lean journey is continuous; Kaizen is continuous; change is continuous. By
embracing the principles of Lean, the organizational culture develops the
inherent ability to constantly adapt and respond to events — both internal
and external. Independent of all the specific tools and techniques of Lean,
this agility makes the Lean organization as competitive as any type of organi-
zation anywhere.
There are no measures by which the Lean organization can declare itself fin-
ished. There is no “Lean Land,” where all problems have been addressed,
everyone’s knowledge is complete and all processes are optimized. There is
always something else to improve — something better to strive for.
Certain organizational cultures are destination-focused. For them, initiatives
are like projects — they have beginnings and ends. The idea that you never
finish may be frustrating and difficult for such organizations to grasp. These
organizations need to shift their perspective and alter their principles when
they commence their Lean journey. They must adopt the cultural predisposi-
tion of Kaizen.
Propagating the principles
The most effective lever to change an organization is communication. Change
requires descriptions, definitions, explanations, education and training, and
questions and answers. Everyone in the organization has a mouth, eyes, ears,
and a pen or keyboard. In this section we cover ways to propagate Lean prin-
ciples through communication and action.
Everyone speaks — and hears
The team element of Lean requires everyone to participate in the process.
Communication is multidirectional. Everyone in the organization has the
responsibility to communicate and to listen. No one has either the monopoly
on communication or the option to opt out of communication.
223
Chapter 11: Lean in the Organization: Principles, Behaviors, and Change

Management-speak . . . and action
Managers at all levels in a Lean initiative are responsible for ensuring that
communications are flowing in all directions. For managers to create the
vision — setting directions, defining plans, enabling events, measuring out-
comes, and analyzing results — they must ensure that communications are
flowing among all levels and across all functions of the organization. Without
these communications, they can’t ensure that the plans will be implemented
and that new behaviors will emerge that support the overall Lean journey.
The first step is to send a clear message. If the organization has been
involved in other continuous-improvement initiatives or major changes, man-
agement must clearly and continually communicate the new Lean principles
to the organization and explain how Lean fits relative to these previous
events. Next, managers must reach out to the staff with the what’s-in-it-for-
you message, to engage the early adapters. Additional messages must be
crafted as the journey continues.
The organization will be waiting for management to put its money where its
mouth is. It will be examining the behaviors of managers, looking for proof
that management is committed to the principles and will walk the walk. Have
their behaviors really changed? When a crisis occurs, are they reacting with
the new principles? Is this initiative for real or is it a “flavor of the month?”
Management must set the tone and lead by example.
Methods of communication
Everyone responds differently to different methods and modes of communi-
cation. Therefore, the messages must be broadcast on all frequencies (mean-
ing: all the tools and techniques of communications must be invoked to move
the organizational culture). A Lean transformation will impact the people
working in the organization at a very personal level. Face-to-face, personal
communication is recommended from the beginning. Communication includes
ways to get the message out, as well as ways to listen and collect feedback
from the organization — remember communication must be multi-directional.
As the journey unfolds, communications technologies as traditional as pre-
sentations and newsletters; as new-wave as Webcasts, podcasts, personalized
e-mails, tip lines, newsletters, e-zines, and blogs; and as personal as hallway
conversations and off-site seminars — all are appropriate. Methods of com-
munication include anything and everything — whatever it takes to reach
every corner of the organization, and vice-versa.
Mergers and acquisitions
When organizations unite as a result of a merger or acquisition, a blending 
of the cultures must take place for Lean to succeed. For example, Wiremold,
224
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

which in the 1990s was on a Lean journey and grew through acquisitions,
found success when it introduced the new company to Lean on day one of
the merger. Initial Kaizen events occurred in the first week of the acquired
company’s union with Wiremold. In most, if not all cases, CEO Art Byrne led
the initial events, which sent a clear message to the organization that Lean
was not an option and that Wiremold would teach them how to start their
journey.
Several instances of Lean derailment or outright failure have occurred when
the dominant culture of a merger or acquisition was a traditional culture with
no interest or understanding of Lean. The purchase was made to increase
market share or because market conditions changed. Successful results from
Lean implementations made the acquired companies attractive to purchase.
However, under traditionally minded management, progress that took eight
to ten years was undone in a matter of months.
Differentiating the parts from the whole
Human beings have their own unique reactions to change. They color facts
with emotional responses. Getting this concept is critical if you want to
understand, measure, and manage the cultural issues and culture change.
You must address the human element of change, both individually and collec-
tively. Something happens in the alchemy when individuals become the 
organization — you have to address both.
This process requires hard work. You won’t find a magic bullet or pixie dust that
will miraculously change the culture overnight. To transform an organization’s
principles, behaviors, and attitudes requires diligence, discipline, patience,
communication, and a commitment to the long-term vision. Implementation of
tools and techniques is the easy part when compared with changing the core
of an organization. And if you lose momentum, it’s very difficult to regain it.
The organization will not move as fast as you want it to. The whole moves
slower than the individuals who make up the organization.

 Exploring the human side of change
 Teaming in Lean
 Introducing the Lean sensei
O
ne of the oldest clichés in business — you’ve heard it a zillion times —
is “People are our most important resource.” From the Lean perspec-
tive, these words are both critically true and utterly false. On face value, it’s
true that an organization is powered by people more than anything else.
Without the people, there is no organizational performance. People are more
important than facilities, equipment, capital, or other resources.
But in the Lean world, you don’t think of people as a “resource.” You don’t
categorize, value, measure, and manage people the same way you would
manage financial, capital, or intellectual resources. In Lean, people are not
the most important resource in an organization; people are the organization.
A Lean practice trusts and respects people to control resources in order to
add value to the customer.
Lean will not happen without the people. Lean affects every single person in
the organization — and each has his own unique response. Often, when embark-
ing upon a Lean journey, managers and practitioners focus on the tools and
techniques of Lean. They spend all their time advocating Lean, and not enough
time inquiring — checking in with the people, getting their ideas and reactions,
and bringing them along. Investing time and energy in the human side of change
is not only a critical component of success; it also pays long-term dividends
when the organization is fully engaged in continuous improvement.
In this chapter, we show you the human side of change, and let you know
how it’s manifested in a Lean implementation. You discover how managers
act and support change at various levels of the organization. You find out
about Lean teams. This chapter includes an in-depth examination of the indi-
vidual’s role in the transformation. You also discover the role of the Lean
sensei and what it means to be a student of Lean.

The Human Side of Change
“Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under
you, chances are it will burn very briefly.”
—Stephen R. Covey
People love to change when change is their own idea — they have a sense of
control, the feeling that they’re in the driver’s seat. Even if the control is lim-
ited, the feeling is there. Whether it’s a big change (like taking a different job
or moving into a new home) or a small change (like buying a new pair of
shoes or upgrading to the latest mobile phone), when it’s your idea, you’re
motivated. You determine the effort, the risk, and the rewards. You balance
the equation — and you’re willing to go for it!
Now alter one critical element of the scenario: the change is no longer your
idea. Immediately, you don’t feel the same sense of participation. You don’t
feel in control. You’re not sure where it will all lead. Fear, doubt, uncertainty,
and perhaps even anger are among the flood of emotions you feel. Do you
still trust the opportunity?
Fight, flight, freeze, fake, fall in line, or fade away — the choice is yours. 
Each individual, facing the same situation, will have her own unique
response. In the context of a Lean journey, people experience the total range
of emotions — from excitement to resistance and everything in between.
They experience stress. They need support. They need to be heard. They
need to be educated.
Whether you’re a practitioner, manager, or participant of Lean in your organi-
zation, you have to work through your own reaction to change. You have to
adjust your actions and attitudes and evaluate your emotional responses.
There is no magical incantation. It takes real work — and it’s work people
usually don’t like to do. Ultimately everyone has the ability to become a Lean
student, actively engaged in continuous improvement and lifelong learning.
First, you have to get over the hurdles of resistance that appear as you move
down the road of Lean.
Change and the individual
As an individual in an organization moving toward Lean, you have choices. It
doesn’t matter where in the organization you fit, what your title is, or what
job you perform — you will experience change. The attitude you choose to
adopt is up to you and no one else. You may choose to jump onboard imme-
diately, becoming a change agent. You may wait and see. You may choose to
leave rather than go through this. You may play the victim or you may play
the trailblazer — or something in between. It’s all up to you, but understand-
ing the dynamics and science behind change helps you in the process.
228
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

The basics: Change 101
Independent of the circumstances of change, people experience change in
their bodies and minds. In this section, we explore the basics of change and
stress.
Perceptions are reality
Have you ever gone to a high school reunion and noticed that some of your
classmates just can’t seem to get over high school? It’s as if their lives stopped
at age 17. They long for the “good old days.” They relive every moment of the
big game. They wish they could go back. Other classmates never even think
of coming back to a reunion because they’re so over it — they’ve moved on
and embraced the future like there is no tomorrow.
Perceptions create reality. Perceptions completely overlay a situation, caus-
ing a person to act, think, and feel in a certain way. What people can control
is their attitudes, actions, and emotions. If a person believes her life was best
in high school, this perception will have her stuck in high school — and it will
be reflected in her attitudes, actions, and emotions.
When implementing Lean, you need to recognize that people are judging the
situation with their own unique biases or perceptions. Part of the organiza-
tion will want to hold on to the “glory days,” and others will be so committed
to the change that they run forward without a mere glance back to the old
way of doing things. A whole range of people will fall somewhere in between.
But eventually, they all need to get on the Lean path.
How people perceive the change colors their responses. During the initial
communication, many people check out and don’t hear most of the change
message. Almost immediately they start thinking, “How is this going to affect
me? Am I going to lose my job? Will I have to change? Are they really serious
this time?” How each person perceives the change dictates how quickly that
person overcomes her natural resistance.
The reality of resistance
If you want to create a truly Lean organization, you have to overcome individ-
ual resistance to change. Certain attitudes appear — these attitudes are
symptoms of resistance. You may recognize some of them:
 “Been there, done that”: If someone feels like this resembles something
that failed in the past, she’ll resist. She won’t willingly jump on the train
to Lean Land. Lingering trust issues, lack of faith, and sarcasm are just a
few of the blocks that you have to remove. How? Through two-way com-
munication, demonstrated commitment, and early results.
 “A rose by any name”: This attitude manifests in several ways. If the
most draconian of supervisors is now anointed a coach or mentor, no
one is likely to believe it possible or sustainable. If you’ve had previous
failed attempts at Lean or other continuous-improvement initiatives, you
229
Chapter 12: Power to the People

have to show how this time is different. Both of these situations require
two-way communication, ongoing monitoring, and continual training and
development. That supervisor will have to prove that he did more than
attend “charm school” to win over the people who work for him.
 “Not invented here” or “Doesn’t apply here”: These attitudes have
contributed to the failure of Lean in many companies. In the worst mani-
festation of these attitudes, people may understand how the tools and
methods of Lean apply in an automotive manufacturing company, but
they don’t see how Lean applies in their company. Overcoming these
attitudes can be very difficult. Constantly demonstrating how to find and
eliminate waste in your processes takes creative leadership. You may
need to adjust the language or demonstrate a concept to show people
how Lean applies in your organization.
 “Fear of failure”: This attitude prevents individuals from actively partic-
ipating. Being a perfectionist is different from striving for perfection.
Perfectionists will be stuck, stopped, or scared if you don’t show them
how important it is to try — independent of the outcome. In a Lean cul-
ture, when you try something new, it won’t always be perfect the first
time out. Remember the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle (see Chapter 6).
The Do phase of that cycle is all about trying — trying is built into the
process.
It’s okay to fail as long as you learn a lesson.
Stress: The natural response to change
Stress is a naturally human response to change. It’s unavoidable. Stress hap-
pens on a continuum, from positive and motivating to negative and debilitat-
ing. In the Lean transformation, the stress you need to watch out for is the
negative stuff.
When stress starts to go to the negative side, you may feel
 Tense
 Anxious
 Angry
 Depressed
 Distracted
 Frustrated
 Short tempered
 Apathetic
 Unusually tired
You may also find yourself eating or drinking more than you normally do. And
you may not show up where you’re supposed to.
230
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

You can manage stress in many ways. Personally, you can monitor your own
behavior and choose to deal with your stress in healthy ways — through diet,
exercise, laughter, and rest. You may also find a friend to confide in and to
give support — talking helps you work through stressful situations.
Reactions beyond reason
In extreme cases of stress or change, your body can actually have a physio-
logical response — fight or flight. Deep inside your brain is a tiny, almond-
shaped cluster of neurons called the amygdala. The amygdala receives a fear
or danger signal from the thalamus, which causes it to secrete chemicals in
the body, even while the rest of the brain is trying to process the information
for the appropriate response. As Daniel Goldman describes it in Emotional
Intelligence, the amygdala can actually hijack your brain, preventing rational
responses.
So what does this have to do with you and a Lean transformation? If you find
yourself reacting irrationally to situations during the Lean transformation,
you may be a victim of that emotional hijacking. One of the best responses is
to walk away and cool down — it can take as long as a few hours — until your
body can actually clear the chemicals and enable you to rationally think
through the situation.
When undergoing any change, it’s natural to experience strong, impulsive reac-
tions from time to time. You can learn and grow beyond the knee-jerk reaction.
With each change you experience and accept, you train yourself that the situa-
tion is okay and the amygdala doesn’t need to charge in to save you.
Embracing change the Lean way
In the previous sections we covered the fundamentals of individual change.
In the next sections, we show you what the individual can do to embrace the
change to Lean.
Know yourself
Assess where you are personally with the change; this will help you move
through the Lean transition. How are you feeling? Where can you contribute?
What attitudes, emotions, or actions may be getting in the way of participat-
ing fully as an individual or a team member? How does working closely
around people affect you? How ready are you to learn and stretch?
You’re the only one who can change you.
Most people are uncomfortable with the unknown. In the absence of informa-
tion, they anticipate the worst. This “pessimistic” approach is a form of self-
protection. The solution is to learn how to be comfortable with ambiguity
and find the courage within to try something new. Every individual has to go
through a phase of letting go — the trick is for you to find your own way to
let go of the old and move on to grab the new.
231
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Some Lean practices — like taking before and after photos of an area — actu-
ally help people let go. Creating ceremonies or events to symbolize letting go
can also help. The movement of a monument, burying an old manual, or
throwing a party in new floor space — these are all examples of ceremonial
letting go. Conducting ceremonies may sound hokey, but it works.
Think about other changes you have experienced in your life that were suc-
cessful. Identify how you adjusted your attitudes, emotions, and actions to
make those situations positive. Build on that track record to propel you for-
ward into the Lean transformation.
When you start to see progress, you’ll have an easier time adapting to the
changed environment. The concept of Lean will become more concrete for
you. This shift in perception usually happens after you’ve participated in
Kaizen activities — it doesn’t happen overnight. Small, continuous improve-
ments in your perceptions will drive you to change your thoughts, attitudes,
and, ultimately, your actions.
When you truly start thinking in a Lean manner, you look at life differently.
You tend to see ways to improve any situation. You look at waste in a totally
different way. You want to make things better — and you know you can!
Whether you’re standing in line at the money bank or volunteering at the
food bank, you have ideas to improve customer wait times or more effec-
tively pack food boxes. Ultimately your actions, attitudes, and emotions are
colored by the Lean filter.
Personal principles: Alignment with Lean
When an organization shifts to Lean, its principles shift. For an individual to
get behind the change, she needs to understand what the impact is on her
and her principles. People whose principles are closer to Lean principles will
have an easier time making the adjustment then those whose aren’t.
How do you align principles? You start by knowing your own principles. Then
you identify and understand the organization’s Lean principles — stated and
manifested. When you compare your principles with the Lean ones, you’ll see
where there is misalignment and how severe it is. Then you can choose how
to close the gap.
While the majority of people enjoy working in a Lean environment, some
people may decide that they would rather work elsewhere and choose to
leave the organization. That is okay; the people who stay are the ones who
want to live Lean.
Speak up, step up: The individual’s role
So often, when people are told that there will be a change, they give their
power away. They don’t ask questions — through their actions, they abdicate
232
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

their responsibility. What can you do as an individual in a company that’s
embarking upon a Lean journey?
 Ask questions.
 Clarify expectations and new roles.
 Stay positive — don’t fuel the rumor mill.
 Actively learn about the tools and concepts.
 Identify what will change in your world.
 Request training.
 Volunteer to participate in early activities.
 Hold yourself accountable to your own thoughts, emotions, and actions.
 Identify and improve at least one thing in your area daily.
 Ask yourself questions about your perceptions, reactions, and behaviors
in the workplace.
 Get comfortable with ambiguity. Realize that you can’t control the situa-
tion or know exactly what is happening all the time.
Management can help by providing forums where people can ask questions
and voice their concerns. To make these sessions beneficial, keep them real
and keep them positive. People will need to feel that management will hear
them, will act and will convey feedback or status of these concerns.
Acting Lean
In traditional organizations of all types, people are taught to do one task, as
fast as they can, with or without a connection other parts of the organization
or to what the end customer requires. Stockpiling, working in isolation,
hiding mistakes, working at an erratic pace, and only bearing good news are
all behaviors that have no place in a Lean environment.
In order to eliminate waste or wasteful behaviors, you first must admit that
they exist. Have you ever been in a meeting where presenter after presenter
discusses dire current business conditions, yet their future trend predicts a
miraculous recovery? When you venture into Lean, you have to deal with
reality — it’s the only way that you can improve.
Many people (including managers) have learned to create crisis situations so
they can become heroes who fly in like Superman to save the day. Management
rewards this type of behavior to the point that if the company is not in crisis,
no one knows how to act. In a Lean organization, you learn how to thrive
without daily disasters. Managers learn how to reward problem avoidance,
root-cause resolution, and continuous improvement.
233
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Many organizations are full of individuals who stopped trying to learn after
they left school. They don’t take classes. They don’t analyze mistakes or fail-
ures. After school, they checked the “education box” and checked out. Lean
organizations reward and thrive on learning. Like the Kaizen philosophy of
improving something everyday, Lean also promotes learning something
everyday — learning from mistakes, learning to solve root-cause issues,
learning new ways to eliminate waste, learning more about your customer.
Looking at different learning styles
Not everyone learns the same way — individuals have different learning
styles. Most people have a dominant style, but may also exhibit other styles
at times. The four commonly held styles are
 Visual: They remember what they see.
 Verbal: They remember what they hear and what they say.
 Logical: They conceptualize information.
 Kinesthetic: They learn by doing and explaining what they’ve done.
Because so many new concepts and changes affect the way you do business
in a Lean environment, you have understand your style. The people, who are
leading the charge and developing training materials, need to appeal to each
individual learner. In order for management’s messages and communication
to be effective, you also need to appeal to each style.
Kaizen events may be a dream for kinesthetic learners, but a nightmare for
logical learners. The verbal learners will want to talk about what’s happening
to grasp the change, and the visual learners may want to hang back and
watch the first time, so they get it. When you have a Kaizen activity, try to
identify each of the team member’s learning styles. You may even hear them
using language that reflects their styles.
Learning happens formally and informally along the Lean journey. Formally,
you will hold classes, workshops, Kaizen events, or training sessions. Topics
range from team building to quick changeover (known as SMED) and every-
thing in between. Informally, you will learn from actions, mistakes, and inter-
personal interactions.
Change and the team
Lean relies heavily on teams of people working together to improve the busi-
ness. What is a team? A team is a collection of individuals working toward a
common purpose. If you don’t have that common purpose, you just have a
group.
234
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

In a Lean environment, several types of teams exist. There are natural work
teams, cross-functional teams, teams that come together for Kaizen events,
teams that include members from upstream or downstream of the organiza-
tion. The type of team formed and length of time the team stays together is
dependent upon the reasons for the team’s existence and expected perfor-
mance objectives The team environment takes advantage of the synergies of
the individual members to identify better solutions, accomplish an objective
faster, and make bigger strides.
Characteristics of a winning team
Winning teams exhibit certain characteristics. Not only do they look a certain
way, but they behave a certain way. High-performing teams have the follow-
ing characteristics:
 They’re willing to share. Sports teams are iconic when it comes to
demonstrating this behavior. Teams with superstar ball hogs tend not to
be as successful as those with players who pass the ball and set up
teammates for the score. During the 2006 World Cup, winner Italy
worked together as a team through match after match, while teams with
celebrity players, like England and Brazil, fell in defeat.
 They’re constantly engaged. Team members constantly look for oppor-
tunities to the overall success of the team. In the World Cup, even play-
ers who were sitting on the bench played a vital role for the team — as
motivators, observers, and providers of moral support.
 They capitalize on individual strengths. Among all the team members
is a breadth of knowledge and talent unique to each individual. Knowing
how to bring out and use those talents will contribute to the overall suc-
cess of the team. Not every soccer player can play every position. The
coaches put the best goal tender in the net and their fastest players
where they can take advantage of breakaway opportunities.
 They’re aligned to a common goal. A group of individuals aligned to a
common goal makes a team. You can believe that every team in the
World Cup was aligned to the goal to win the cup!
 They’re able to learn together. As teams face new situations, they have
to adjust and grow in order to achieve their ultimate goal. As the differ-
ent teams played each other during the World Cup, they had to adjust
their playing styles and strategies each time they met new opponents.
You can be sure that learning and adjustments were made when teams
found themselves down at the half.
In addition to displaying the preceding characteristics, effective teams are
usually made up of five to seven people. Each team member is a unique indi-
vidual, who has something special to offer the team. Ideally, during the forma-
tion process, these unique traits are identified.
235
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Many assessment tools — such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI),
the DiSC Classic Profile, the Kolbe A index, the Cultural Orientations Indicator
(COI), or the StrengthsFinder found in Now, Discover Your Strengths, by Marcus
Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton — can help a team understand who is play-
ing. You want to find a qualified person to administer the assessment and help
the team interpret the results. The best teams are ones that consist of very
different types of individuals. You may find it difficult to work with people who
are very different from your style. The assessment can help you understand
how to improve working relationships, facilitate communications, and capital-
ize on strengths. Assessments provide the team with a common language, con-
text, and understanding.
Teams must have a variety of perspectives, talents, and types in order for
innovation and creativity to materialize.
Team formation
Dr. Bruce Tuckman, noted psychologist and organizational behavior expert,
identified the now famous five phases of teaming:
1. Forming: People join forces to achieve a common goal. Members get to
know one another, identify commonality, and begin to develop ground
rules.
2. Storming: Members are trying to figure out where they fit. Hostilities
and emotions may run high as people jockey for position, figure out who
they can trust, and claim a role. Leaders emerge.
3. Norming: Members learn how to work together. Leadership and roles
are understood. Principles and standards of behavior are established,
but not necessarily the same as the overall organization’s. Team identity
is formed — formally or informally.
4. Performing: Members work together to get the job done.
5. Adjourning: Work is complete and the team will either disband or
address a new scope of work.
Changes to the makeup or direction of the team can cause regression into ear-
lier phases. As your team forms to eliminate waste and improve processes,
remember that it will have to develop as an entity. The team will experience
these phases. If the team is struggling to get to the performing stage, manage-
ment may need to provide an intervention — such as facilitation, guidance,
change of membership, or clarification of expectations.
Team leadership is determined during the formation process. Although there
may be an official leader, a different leader may emerge as the team matures.
Facilitators can help a team get off the ground. A facilitator is someone who
236
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

guides the process of the team and ensures that all members are participat-
ing and being heard; ideally, the facilitator is not a team member and is not
expected to contribute content to the team.
Collaboration
When people are used to working in a traditional environment, the idea of
collaboration may seem a bit foreign. The result of a true collaborative envi-
ronment is the win-win solution. It requires that team members contribute
ideas, analyze the situation objectively, and negotiate a solution. It requires
that the individuals be able to let go of an idea or position if better, alterna-
tive solutions are offered. It requires that an individual see a situation not
only from his point of view, but from the points of view of others involved.
In a Lean environment, teams work to eliminate waste. But sometimes what
one person views as waste may be vital to another — this is why type-1 muda
exists. When collaborative skills are developed in an organization, individuals
are able to see both sides of the situation and, with a Lean mindset, propose
alternatives that can minimize, if not eliminate, non-value-added activities.
Ideally, when you collaborate, you gain new perspectives about a situation,
which then adjusts your perceptions and influences your attitudes, actions,
and emotions.
Multifunctional workers
Lean advocates the development of multifunctional workers, especially in
natural work teams. Each member of the area is trained in the activities of the
others. Training is tracked and each employee must develop a level of com-
petency before performing the task unsupervised. This is easy to envision in
a manufacturing environment, but the same philosophy can be applied in
non-manufacturing environments like accountancies, industrial kitchens,
retail outlets, or title companies. By having a well-trained workforce, you’re
insulated against the effects of absenteeism and vacations.
Post a tracking chart showing job qualifications by person (see Chapter 9).
Change and the managers
Managers directly influence the change to Lean by their behaviors, decisions,
and communication. They have the challenging position, as the face of Lean
leadership, to lead the organization to success in spite of their own personal
reaction to the change. In this section we discuss what managers can do to
make the unknown more known and move the organization along the road 
to Lean.
237
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Creating the vision
Declaring that the organization will be Lean is easy; actually making the change
is the greater challenge. Managers start by creating a clear vision for the
organization — not some lofty visionary statement, but a straightforward
image of what it means to the company to implement Lean practices. This
vision includes performance expectations, timing, expected outcomes, 
interrelationships to other company initiatives, and commitments to the
organization.
If you don’t want your Lean efforts to look like a Dilbert cartoon, you have to
pay attention to the human element of change. Management must lead by
example and with a constancy of purpose. Eighty percent of change initia-
tives fail due to human factors, according to studies by noted organizational
researchers John Kotter and Daryl Conner.
Creating a sustainable Lean transformation requires that you move people
from compliance (implementing because you tell them to) to commitment
(implementing because they want to). You have to address each individual at
some point in time.
Engage people early in the process after you make the decision to implement
Lean. By involving them in the planning of how to implement Lean, you enroll
them in the process.
Communications
People need two things to deal with change: They need to be informed and
they need to be heard. The communication should be clear, consistent, multi-
dimensional, and frequent. One-time declarations don’t make a Lean transfor-
mation. Develop a communication strategy to support the implementation
plan. The communication plan needs to be a two-way effort. One part is what
you want to say; the other part is what your employees want you to hear.
You’re dealing with a collection of individuals, with different needs, learning
styles, and perceptions.
Remember the basics of communication:
 Who: Who is the audience? Is it an internal or external audience?
 What: What is going to happen? What does the audience need to know?
What do you expect them to do as a result of the communication? What
does the audience fear? What could prevent them from embracing the
change? What are they saying?
 When: When will the communication happen? How frequently will it
occur?
 Where: Where will it happen?
 How: What method of communication will be used? How can the company
make use of technology to get the message out? How will the message
238
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

permeate all levels of the organization? How can you prevent the mes-
sage from being changed as it’s relayed? How can you engage the audi-
ence? How can you solicit input from the audience?
 Why: Why are you making this change at this time? What are the busi-
ness conditions that are precipitating the change? Why this method at
this time?
Feedback loops are vital to an organization undergoing change. You need to
know how filtered by perceptions and misinterpretation your original mes-
sage is. Based on the feedback of the response, you can adjust your message
and delivery method in the next round of communication. Figure 12-1 shows
a model of a feedback loop.
In the beginning, you cannot over-communicate with people. People need to
know what they’re in for. The formal communication plan needs to be supple-
mented with informal communications. Nothing can derail a change move-
ment faster than misinformation and coffee-pot rumors. In the absence of
information, people fill the abyss with speculation and fear.
Frequently, managers excited about a new initiative fall into the advocacy
trap. They’re so focused on telling people why they should be excited and the
benefits of the change that they forget to listen and ask for input from the
people. Practicing inquiry is vitally important to your long-term success.
Developing the ability to listen to and truly hear your employees is a critical
skill for every manager. People need to be heard. Some may need to vent
before they can move onto the new ways of doing business. Providing differ-
ent forums for communication, including the following, will address the vari-
ous needs of the individuals within the organization:
 One on one: Invest 15 minutes with your employees to hear what their
thoughts, ideas, and concerns are around the change. Use this informa-
tion to understand where blocks in the organization are happening, 
to monitor trends in the organization, and to craft follow-up group 
communication.

Chapter 12: Power to the People

 Small group: Conduct regular small-group sessions to address issues
and gather ideas. These groups can be diagonal slices across the organi-
zation, functional groups, project teams, or natural workgroups. Provide
a mechanism for people to input questions before the sessions.
 Large group: Conduct regular large-group briefings. Recognize accom-
plishments, show the state of the business, progress to long-term visions,
and recognize individual and group efforts. Provide a mechanism for
people to input questions and concerns prior to the meeting.
Create a communications council with volunteers from various parts of the
organization. This group becomes your eyes and ears into the organization.
They can help with rumor control, act as an editorial board for your commu-
niqués, keep the pulse of the organization, promote Lean within the organiza-
tion, and become a sounding board for ideas.
Communications in action
Assume you’re a manager who has just received news that your company has
won a new contract, but you don’t currently have the floor space available in
your facility to accommodate the new work. After working with your staff on
the right vision and strategy for the new contract launch, you start the com-
munication process. Initially, you gather your organization together, tell them
about the new business, and tell them that you need to free up 10,000 square
feet of floor space in the northeast corner of the facility in two weeks. You tell
them that they’ll be involved in Kaizen activities to make this happen and
that you expect there to be no negative impact on the customer during these
Kaizen activities. It will require teamwork, commitment, and cooperation.
You announce that Pat will be responsible to organize and oversee the activi-
ties. You tell them that you will be following their progress closely and that
you expect the next gathering will be in two weeks in the newly-freed-up area.
Later that day, you go to the northeast corner of the facility and hang a sign
saying “Future Home of Dizzo Production.” You talk to employees as you walk
through the plant, asking them what they think about the new contract and
what they think it will take to free up the space. The next day, you and Pat
walk the floor again, informally communicating with the employees. You both
decide to add a sign showing progress to the 10,000 square feet. You may
decide to personally lead or participate in the first Kaizen activity. After each
Kaizen activity, you meet with the teams, recognize them, and thank them for
their efforts. You may use a company blog to communicate the progress and
recognize efforts. You may create a podcast, which can be accessed by
employees 24/7, with updates on the new business.
Every day you walk the floor to review the progress. At the one-week mark,
you gather all your staff and the supervisors in the area to review the status
and subsequently make any adjustments to the plan. You record an update
that is played in the cafeteria. Finally, at the two-week mark, you gather every-
one into the area, recognize their efforts, and announce the next challenge.
240
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Whatever you communicate, be prepared to back up the message with actions.
If you say that you’re going to do something by a certain date, do it, or explain
why it didn’t happen. Part of your population is expecting failure — don’t let
them win.
The changing role of management
Management has a unique role in the Lean transformation. Not only do man-
agers have to lead the charge, but they have to deal with their own reactions
to what’s happening and adjust to redefined roles and expectations. Not all
managers successfully make this change. Because they are members of man-
agement, they will undergo greater scrutiny by the members of the organi-
zation and be held to higher standards. People who don’t want to change,
managers and non-managers alike, will be looking for cracks in the resolve, 
so they can go back to their old ways.
When moving from a traditional manufacturing or business system, tradi-
tional Theory X management styles have to change. Managers have to shift
from dictatorial stances to ones of collaboration. This doesn’t mean that they
abdicate their decision-making responsibilities — it does mean that they have
to incorporate the synergies and ideas of the organization.
They have to develop new managerial skill sets. In the area of people manage-
ment, this means the ability to listen, the ability to teach and guide, and the
ability to learn and consider alternative viewpoints. It means developing the
attitude that you don’t always have to be right or have all the answers. These
skill sets aren’t usually taught at business schools, medical schools, engineer-
ing schools, and the like. Not having the skills can stop the Lean process.
Living Lean on the front line
First-line supervisors who have grown up in traditional organizations will
have the greatest adjustments to make in the organization. Generally, they’re
used to giving orders, fighting fires, and making things happen. As self-directed
work teams form, their role is very different. Now the team makes decisions,
plans work, and does some of the tasks normally performed by supervisors.
The supervisors in a Lean organization are expected to coach, mentor, and
advise the teams. Oftentimes, they feel as though they have the responsibility
for performance without the authority they once held. Supervisors need train-
ing in new skill sets, particularly in the area of interpersonal communication,
coaching, and Lean techniques. They need time to develop these new skills
and mentoring as they change their behaviors.
Supervisors, too, have standardized work to perform. They’re responsible for
5S implementation and the continuous improvement of their areas. They must
create visual work areas and be more open with information than in the past.
They may have to host more people in their areas as people start making pil-
grimages to gemba.
241
Chapter 12: Power to the People

As soon as more self-directed teams are working in the organization, an
opportunity exists to flatten the organization. Not as many layers are needed.
Supervisors are also freed up because tasks they previously had done are
shifted to the teams. This enables them to support more teams. Remember,
though, that as you change the organizational structure, you have to do it in
a way that is consistent with Lean principles. If the management team has
declared that there will be no job loss due to Lean improvements, the same
applies to managers, too. How human resources and the management team
handles the attrition must be consistent with the new values of the organization.
The organization will use this situation as a gauge of management’s commit-
ment to the new Lean principles. It underscores trust, integrity, and credibility.
Living Lean in Cubicleland
Managers who are off the front line but not yet in the boardroom also have to
change the way they work. They, too, have standardized work. They must
drive the focus on the customer and unrelenting pursuit to eliminate waste in
all areas of the company.
These managers develop a strong understanding of how their part fits into
the value stream. They learn to look across the value stream and not solely in
their areas of responsibility. They must become teachers and mentors to
their organization.
Creating management-by-eye reporting areas (see Chapter 9) and implement-
ing practical 5S in their area is also a new role for these managers. No longer
is it sufficient to manage from behind a desk. Gemba walks are now part of
their regular activities. Decisions are made with data and in context of the
customer. Their job is to energize and motivate the organization to improve
daily, as well as to actively participate in and support Kaizen.
These managers can be the glue that holds the Lean organization together or
the barrier to forward progress. They can be a huge filter in the communica-
tion process from the senior levels of the organization. Addressing the needs
of this group and ensuring that they’re onboard is one of senior-management’s
primary responsibilities.
Living Lean on Mahogany Row
It used to be that executive alley was for the fat cats. Heady stuff like analysis
and process improvement was for the working stiffs. An executive had “earned”
the right to think on his feet, shoot from the hip, and react with his gut. And
you know what? As long as corporate performance stayed high, and the execu-
tives’ bosses — the board of directors, shareholders, distributors, key suppli-
ers, employees, and customers — were all happy, nothing more was required.
That was then. That was before margin erosion, outsourcing, globalization,
startups, brain drain, the Internet, and countless other new-era pressures
242
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

welled up and required an evolved form of leadership from the top. Gone are
the days of delegation — relegation, really — of programs to improve perfor-
mance and the bottom line. The executives are in the mix, leading the charge.
You may not think that the same techniques that work on a factory floor
apply in the boardroom, but they do. They just don’t look quite the same. For
instance, standardized work for an executive may consist of standard infor-
mation reviews utilizing standard templates and timed agendas. Or it could
be a set gemba walk within the organization. Maybe only 20 percent of an
executive’s job can be standardized, but that 20 percent should be standard-
ized in the most effective way possible.
Lean, like any other strategic initiatives worth doing, must be led from the
top. That’s no surprise. (The role of senior management supporting the Lean
journey is the subject of the last section in this chapter.) But the senior man-
ager’s personal behaviors are both individually meaningful and symbolically
significant to everyone in the enterprise. They must “walk the talk.” The fol-
lowing are a few ways that a Lean executive demonstrates she is living Lean
principles and incorporating Lean tools.
 Unrelenting focus on the customer: Whether in personal discussions,
questions, measures, reports, presentations, or briefings, the executive
is focused on the customer.
 Maximizing value added in all you do: The executive ensures that per-
sonal activities, in meetings and briefings, travels, communications —
and especially perks — all focus on the value added by both his own
behavior and the collective effort of those directly involved.
 Requiring visual management: Performance reviews in the areas, regu-
lar gemba walks, safety tours, and simple measurement systems are all
part of the Lean culture change. Senior management sets the tone and
requirements for the organization to follow.
 Living 5S: Like none other, top executives should exhibit 5S in their per-
sonal conduct. (See Chapter 8 for more on 5S.)
 Elimination of waste (muda): The crusade for waste reduction carries
enhanced meaning when it’s reflected in the top executive’s personal
behavior. This may mean letting go of perks like reserved parking spaces
and executive dining rooms.
 Consistency (reduction of mura): People need to know their leadership
is dependable and consistent. Variability in performance and action
(mura) on a personal level should be eliminated.
 Respect for people and systems (eradication of muri): Leaders must
show that they respect themselves and others, as well as the systems
and equipment of the organization.
243
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Can you think of other ways that senior leaders can personally exhibit behav-
iors consistent with Lean principles? How about cycle time reduction? Or the
seven wastes? What would standard work for executives look like?
Read the latest business headlines and you’ll find stories of executives abus-
ing power and misappropriating resources, tales of egomaniacs making
unreasonable demands for their own personal gain. These behaviors will not
support a Lean transformation. Executives need to be able to park their egos
long enough to truly listen to their organization and foster communication
through all levels of management.
Bringing people along
“Motivation is the art of getting people to do what you want them to do
because they want to do it.”
—President Dwight D. Eisenhower
You have to bring individuals along by addressing their needs. Every organi-
zation, team, or department is still made up of individuals who all have their
own needs, filters, perceptions, and timelines. In order to move the entire
organization down the path of Lean, you still have to meet the individual
where she is. Table 12-1 shows some of the differences that you’ll have to
consider in your communications activities, strategy development, and
implementation steps.
Table 12-1
Organizational Development and Strategy 
Considerations to Evoke Change
Aspect of Change
Impact on Change
Cultural/organizational
People’s perceptions are influenced by all the groups that
they’ve belonged to — from family units to other business
organizations. All of this will color their individual beliefs
about the “right way” to do things and influence their
willingness to change.
Generational
At least four generations are currently in the workplace,
all with different values and guiding principles. Getting
them to work together and communicate effectively
within a Lean environment is vital. There may be a ten-
dency to resist change as people progress in their
careers and in position. Fear of loss becomes greater.
Educational
Your organization may have a broad range of people —
from those who cannot read to those with PhDs. In this
global world, you may not share the same first language
as your coworkers.
244
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Aspect of Change
Impact on Change
Learning styles
When introducing any new concept or change — and
Lean is full of them — you need to present it in a multi-
faceted way.
Personality styles
Understanding personality styles will help you evaluate
how best to respond to the needs of the organization and
how to get them to respond to the change.
Change motivators
Not everyone is motivated by money. Matching the moti-
vators, like time off, money, or public recognition, to the
individual will go far to bring people along.
Many organizations use economic incentives to motivate or buy change in
the organization. Understanding what motivates each individual to change
will enable you to employ a broader range of incentives to move a larger part
of the organization forward.
One of the biggest fears employees have is that they’ll lose their jobs. One strat-
egy that has been successful in companies who have started to implement
Lean is the guarantee that no one will lose his job as a direct result of perfor-
mance gains made by implementing Lean improvements. This guarantee goes
a long way to allay fears. The policy is clear that it’s only in effect for Lean
improvement. If the policy exists, then management must live up to their
promise. They have to be very clear in their communications and open with
information. If they aren’t, they’ll cause a credibility and trust problem —
another impediment to change.
You may think that you shouldn’t have to baby people or go to all this effort.
Yet, if you want to succeed you need to address the needs of the individuals.
What is the price of success? Is it worth investing time in your people for the
long-term payoff?

Chapter 12: Power to the People
The sensei of legends
Many of the earlier, well-known senseis, like
Yoshiki Iwata, were trained at Toyota and were
students of Taiichi Ohno. They have been known
to play hard to get — not agreeing to work with
a company unless the company was extremely
persistent. When they agree, they have a 
reputation for being demanding, relentless, and
unexpected. When things are not moving fast
enough they have been known to move equip-
ment themselves. Although their methods may
be a bit unconventional, those under the tute-
lage of these senseis swear by the results.

The Master and the Students
One of the most famous sensei-student relationships was in the 1984 movie
The Karate Kid. Daniel, the new kid in town, is getting his butt kicked by the
local karate bullies. Mr. Miyagi, a handyman and karate master, steps in and
saves Daniel by fighting off the lot of the bullies. Later and after much pester-
ing by Daniel, Mr. Miyagi agrees to become his sensei, or teacher. When the
lessons begin, Daniel does not understand Mr. Miyagi’s unconventional meth-
ods. His lessons include washing Mr. Miyagi’s car (“wax on, wax off”), paint-
ing his fence (“brush up, brush down”), and sanding his deck. After Daniel
blows up in frustration because he feels like he’s not learning anything, Mr.
Miyagi points out to Daniel that he has been learning karate while doing
these tasks. As a sensei, Mr. Miyagi has knowledge, experience, and his own
unique way of passing on the knowledge. Mr. Miyagi demands that Daniel
complete tasks in a precise way. He also has the understanding that karate is
not just the external techniques and moves, but also the internal belief in the
heart and mind.
Successful Lean organizations find a sensei or a master, not unlike Mr. Miyagi.
The Lean sensei teaches and guides the organization on their path to Lean
implementation. The organization may not always understand the sensei’s
methods at first, but eventually, with the right sensei, everyone in the organi-
zation finds themselves living Lean. In this section we will tell you not only
about the Lean sensei, but also about Lean students.
The Lean sensei
The Lean journey does not mandate a Lean sensei, but if you want to be suc-
cessful, having a sensei is highly recommended. Many companies have found
it beneficial to bring in an external Lean sensei when starting the Lean journey.
A Lean sensei has knowledge of Lean principles, methods, and implementation.
They’re there to guide and teach. Like Mr. Miyagi’s methods, their methods
may be unconventional by traditional business standards. They also have a
broad understanding that Lean is more than just the external techniques —
to truly get it, you must change your attitudes, perceptions, and actions.
Identifying the role of a sensei
The role of a sensei is to guide the Lean journey and teach the principles. The
sensei does this where the action is in the organization. One of the main ways
the sensei guides and teaches is through gemba walks with individuals and
small groups of management. By pointing out what is un-Lean in the process
and telling them how to fix it, the sensei teaches. Senseis may lead Kaizen
246
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

events, and don’t be surprised if you find them rolling up their sleeves and
getting dirty. They oversee the short- and long-term vision. Think of the
sensei as the wise master, who will do just about anything to teach a point.
What are the benefits of having a Lean sensei? A sensei can
 Jumpstart the initial Lean implementation
 Serve as an independent party, ensuring the Lean efforts stay the course.
 Customize input based on the company’s particular situation.
 Offer a broad view of the organization to ensure constancy of purpose.
 Provide tactical direction to support a long-term vision.
 Produce faster results.
 Set high expectations, allowing your organization to achieve more than
it thought possible
Hiring a sensei
No unique credential for a Lean sensei is currently on the market. So how do
you find a sensei? You can find candidates by contacting consulting compa-
nies (Shingijutsu Co., one of the best known sources of senseis in Japan, also
operates globally), hiring a former employee from a Lean company like
Toyota, asking other Lean companies for references, searching the Internet,
and so on. You will find an abundance of potential sensei candidates whose
talents range from hack to expert. To find the one who is right for your orga-
nization, you need to be clear about what you are looking for and how much
you can afford to pay.
Before hiring a sensei, your company will want to understand what their
expectations are and what the background of the prospective sensei is. Here
are some questions to ask of yourself and the sensei:
 Where did the sensei receive his training?
 What experience does he have?
 What expectations does the company have of the sensei?
 How long does the company expect to rely on an outside resource?
 What is the company willing to spend on a sensei?
 Does the company intend to develop an internal sensei?
How many senseis do you need? It depends on the size of your company or
operating units. You’re better off starting with one sensei and at one location.
As your efforts increase, under the sensei’s guidance you may want to bring
247
Chapter 12: Power to the People

on more senseis as needed. No matter how many senseis you end up with, you
need to make sure that they’re all working in alignment with each other.
There’s nothing worse than too many cooks in the kitchen — or too many
senseis in the company!
Organizations truly committed to Lean understand that they must continu-
ously learn, stretch, and grow. To ensure that happens, you will need a
teacher and guide to show you the next step in the journey. Over time, is that
teacher the same person or always an external resource? Probably not. You
may find that your organization responds better to a different sensei as the
journey progresses — not unlike your school experience where your kinder-
garten teacher was different from your high school teacher.
The performance expectations of the sensei should be agreed upon as part of
the original contract (for an external resource) or part of the performance
appraisal (for an internal resource). At the end of the day, you’re looking for
performance improvement in your operations. Connect the sensei’s activities
with the organizational performance metrics.
Senseis in the organization
Following the philosophy that you can’t be a prophet in your own land, a
sensei is usually external to the organization — especially during the initial
phases of implementation. In some cases, the sensei is a member of the man-
agement team who has a broad and deep knowledge of Lean. The sensei may
have experience from other companies and may have been under the tute-
lage of an external sensei before.
If the company goes the internal route, then that sensei needs to have the
authority and backing of the rest of the management team. You don’t want to
deem a functional manager as sensei. The sensei needs to be focused solely
on Lean and should report directly to the highest levels of the organization.
Lean students
Every member of the Lean organization is a student of Lean. In an unending
quest to improve, everyone must learn — constantly. You won’t spend hours
in a classroom. In fact, the majority of learning happens where the action is.
Every place becomes a classroom, every situation a class.
All levels of the organization learn new skills as the Lean journey progresses.
You learn from classes, workshops, books, interactions with a sensei, on the job,
from trial and error, from mistakes, from online blogs or other resources —
the sources are countless.
248
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

In order to stay fresh and to be able to make daily improvements, an individ-
ual must continue to seek out knowledge. Particularly when you have worked
in the same job or in the same area or with the same people for an extended
period of time, you need fresh perspective. But you can easily get comfortable
and stagnate. As a student, your responsibility is to seek knowledge daily.
You may learn a new job, apply a new technique, learn about a different part
of the value stream — learning is all around you!
You’ll know when you’re an advanced student of Lean. You not only start apply-
ing Lean concepts beyond the workplace, but also look for Lean in everyday
life. When you’ve taught your kids how to 5S their room and conduct gemba
walks around your house, you’ll know that you’ve changed your thinking.
The ongoing Lean curriculum
The curriculum of a Lean student is not fixed. Sure, you learn the basics —
like Value Stream Mapping, Kaizen, forms of waste, 5S, visual management,
poka-yoke, kanban, and all the other tools found in Part III of this book. But 
if you stop there, it’s like dropping out of grade school.
To become a Lean student, you must have knowledge and competency in at
least four skill areas:
 Technical skills including Kaizen to kanban and everything in between.
 Interpersonal skills including collaboration, conflict resolution, negotia-
tions, teaming, and self awareness.
 Strategy and planning skills including project planning and manage-
ment, goal setting, and problem solving.
 Real world experience (practical application skills) including demon-
strated competency in the real world — where theory and practical
application meet.
As time passes, more pieces may be added to the puzzle. Remember: Your
responsibility is to become a lifelong learner.
Lean certification
Lean certification is a relatively new development in the field. Although sev-
eral certifications are available, a common standard of certification does not
exist for knowledge and demonstrated capability required. One of the most
recognized Lean certifications is sponsored by the Society of Manufacturing
Engineers, the Association for Manufacturing Excellence, and the Shingo
Prize (see Chapter 18).
249
Chapter 12: Power to the People

Lean certification is a mildly controversial topic. Not all Lean practitioners
agree to the value of certification. A certificate alone does not make you a
Lean expert. Only you can determine the value of having a certificate. You
may belong to an organization that esteems certificates and credentials; in
that case, certification may be of value. At the end of the day, you’ll deter-
mine the value of certification for you personally and professionally within
the context of your organization.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
—Lao-tzu
A
s you know by now, Lean is a journey. It is not a prescription, where you
follow steps 1, 2, and 3 and — voila! — you’re there. It is not a one-size-
fits-all continuous-improvement methodology. Lean is like the quest for per-
fect health: Your pursuit is multifaceted — nutrition, exercise, rest, genetics,
beliefs. It requires discipline. It’s a way of life.
You have to assess your present state and determine the right Lean strategy
for your organization, based on your own specific needs, objectives, experi-
ence, and the state of the organization.
In forming your strategy, don’t just copy someone like Toyota. Although
Toyota’s history is a good reference, it’s not an exact blueprint for anyone
else. You have to follow your own path, make your own adjustments, and find
your own way.
In this chapter, we offer strategies and tips to help you begin your journey.
You figure out how to prevent the “program-of-the-month” trap. And you see
how to evolve from your starting point to a place of living Lean.

Preparing to Go Lean
Lean implementation does not follow a prescriptive step-by-step scenario,
like you might see in other continuous-improvement methodologies. It’s rig-
orous, to be sure, but it’s more of an evolution than a revolution. Lean focuses
on the means just as much as it does on achieving end results. It’s not strictly
measured just by quarterly profit performance, although, over time, you will
experience improved performance in your financial measures.
To be successful, Lean needs to be owned and encouraged from the top of
the organization, and expanded to all levels and corners of the enterprise.
Lean is a very action-oriented methodology, with all the projects, Kaizen
events (see Chapter 6), and continuous learning. The planning process for a
Lean initiative doesn’t require an elaborate production, but it must be devel-
oped to the point where everyone in the organization receives a clear mes-
sage about where they’re going.
On the one hand, Lean is easier than other approaches, because you don’t
have to follow a prescribed rollout, where if you don’t do things in a specific
order, it won’t work. You have a lot of latitude and leeway in your approach.
On the other hand, Lean is more difficult than other approaches, because you
don’t have a firm prescription to follow and a precise road map to fall back
on. You need to chart your own course and find your own way. The good
news is that, with Lean, finding your way tends to happen naturally.
Starting from the top
Lean succeeds if and only if the management team is dedicated to the cause.
You may start Lean in any part of the organization, but if you want sustain-
able results beyond a small portion of the company — and who doesn’t? —
the senior managers must endorse and actively participate in the effort.
People respond to the cues they get from leadership — such as behaviors,
recognition, and performance standards.
Senior managers must understand both the tools of Lean and the philosophy
of Kaizen. They must practice Lean themselves in the course of their regular
work routines. They must set a vision and communicate the messages of
Lean. And they must follow up by performing Lean management actions 
(see Chapter 10).
Applying standardized work from the top down
Everyone in a Lean organization has standardized work. For people like 
the factory-floor assembler, most of their work is standardized. Senior 
managers spend much of their time responding to interruptions, crises, and
exceptions — and the rest of their time they spend brainstorming how to
252
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

have fewer interruptions, crises, and exceptions! But senior managers have
standardized work, too — not as much as the front-line worker, but they have
it nonetheless.
Examples of where standardized work applies in senior management include
gemba walks (see Chapter 10), routine meetings, briefings, reviews, and
reports. This kind of work may amount to less than half the senior manager’s
time, but when standardized, it enables the managers to work more effec-
tively, freeing up time and resources for more value-added activities. In the
Lean world, the senior managers apply standardized work.
Focusing on the message and vision
The staff, directors, shareholders, analysts, suppliers, customers . . . all these
constituents must know that you’re embarking on this Lean journey. You
can’t take this journey and not tell anyone — they’ll all wonder where you’ve
gone, long before the new results kick in. You must set the vision for your
new path and articulate the mission. Take the time to craft these messages,
and convey them to the audiences as the journey begins.
The beauty of Lean for executives is that it provides the senior managers a
toolkit that gives method and technique to back-up management’s classic
platitudes, for example:
 We’re customer-centric! Management’s been touting this for years, but
how could they really make it happen? Lean gives the executive the
techniques to examine value-added from the customer’s point of view.
 People are our most important resource! That’s the one you’re used to
hearing right before the next round of layoffs. Lean teaches executives
about true respect for employees and provides the toolkit for safety,
security, engagement, celebration, and growth.
 Think win-win. Unfortunately, without a method, this one’s been only
half-true: management’s win for themselves. Lean techniques enable
managers to create a win for all parties.
 Do it right the first time. (Also known as Quality is Job #1; or, as they say
in the software industry, Quality is Job 1.1 — the bugs will be fixed in the
next release!) But, how do you actually do it right the first time? You can’t
test and rework products into submission. Lean, in conjunction with sta-
tistical methods and tools, provides the basis for making this real.
Leading by example
In addition to performing standardized work, the senior managers must also
lead by setting the example. Managers translate the foreign and abstract con-
cepts of Lean into practical behaviors that everyone can observe and emu-
late. They must change the way they think and react, especially in times of
crisis. The people will be watching to see if the managers are legitimate or if
they’re just giving lip service.
253
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

Managers must use visual controls. Charts, graphs, trends, and reports
should be highly visible and apparent to everyone. Take down some of those
fancy framed photographs of faraway tropical islands and lofty mountain
peaks, and replace them with images of the paradise of performance and pin-
nacles of success in your organization.
Managers must exemplify discipline and accountability. They must perform
to the expectations they set for others. They must hold themselves account-
able, just as they expect everyone else to hold one another accountable. The
personal and professional discipline demonstrated by managers will be
copied by everyone.
One of the most powerful showcases for Lean behavior is in meeting manage-
ment. Managers should prepare for meetings and have a firm well-defined
agenda, with the outcomes articulated explicitly. They must always arrive on
time and finish on time — standardized work!
Managers must also conduct the same Lean practices that they expect of
everyone else, including the development and analysis of Value Stream Maps,
participation in Kaizen events and Kaizen improvement projects, partaking in
continuous training and learning, and overtly demonstrating regular, continu-
ous improvements.
Creating the Lean infrastructure
Although there’s no standard recipe for a Lean deployment, you’ll need to put
in place a framework of support elements before you begin the trip. You must
acquire certain specific Lean expertise and disseminate the knowledge
across the organization in a controlled manner. You must also bring in coop-
erative human resource practices, set up certain financial and accounting
practices, and put in place some specific IT infrastructure. This support
framework is critical to a successful rollout.
Bringing in a master of Lean: The Lean sensei
The first step in creating the Lean infrastructure is acquiring Lean expertise
in the organization. Lots of great references and books on Lean are out there
(you’re reading the best one, of course!), but you can’t gain the necessary
experience from a book. You must bring in a Lean Master or sensei, who
guides your Lean journey by:
 Creating the itinerary
 Teaching your organization Lean skills
254
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Leading your teams through the process of discovery and understand-
ing in the ways of Lean and Kaizen
 Guiding you toward your destination
 Knowing the best way to get the results you want
Companies rarely have this expertise in-house. The most common approach
is to hire a Lean sensei, usually as an outside consultant. But if you do have a
prophet in your own land, then the onus is on the managers to set up the
internal expert for success. Wherever the Lean sensei comes from, the expert
will need resources and authority at his disposal to launch the initiative.
Be very careful and highly selective about retaining a Lean Master. This
person will have a large role in the Lean initiative and an even larger influ-
ence on the nature of the organization’s adaptation. Bringing on the wrong
Lean Master is a disaster. Make sure the Lean sensei has the credentials and
fits the profile that your change requires (see Chapter 12).
Adjusting the people policies
When moving into Lean from a traditional environment, numerous personnel
policies and practices have to change in order to be aligned with the people-
centered principles of Lean. For example:
 Incentive systems that are traditionally focused on the individual require
realignment in order to include a team perspective.
 Policies must support the realignment and reassignment of employees
who are displaced due to productivity improvements.
 Organizational structures and labor agreements, if applicable, will have
to be adjusted to support a Lean environment. Frequently, this includes
a reduction in the number of organizational levels, the consolidation of
job categories and flexible work rules.
 Recognition and reward programs will have to expand to include individ-
uals and teams.
 Promotions will have to be based on performance, knowledge, and capa-
bility. The company may establish standard path progressions for multi-
functional workers.
Acquiring training materials
Lean courseware includes formal training on the practices of Kaizen and the
Lean toolkit (see Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10). Additional courses are available on
Lean people and organizational change management. These courses are
offered by numerous practitioners and training and consulting firms (see
Chapter 18 for recommendations).
255
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

Training firms typically prefer to perform the training for you, rather than
license you the training materials. If you’re embracing Lean fully and organi-
cally, you will want the materials and adapt them to your organization to use
in a variety of settings and formats. But if you’re just sticking your toe in the
water, you can either send people to training or bring the trainers to you.
Putting the people in place
To initiate the Lean effort, you have to put in place the logistical support
pieces. People at all levels of the organization will need training. In addition,
Kaizen events must be scheduled and tracked. Outside resources like train-
ers, consultants, materials, and software tools will also need coordination. 
A core group of people will assemble to perform this work.
Putting the support tools in place
The Lean practitioner uses software application tools as part of his optimiza-
tion work. These tools include process mapping, Value Stream Mapping
(VSM), statistical analysis, and mapping and charting tools (see Chapter 10).
Some of these are individual desktop-computer tools, while others are shared
by workgroups. The IT organization must include these in its cadre of appli-
cations support. Other software tools include programs for facility layouts
and graphics packages for visual aides.
In addition to software tools, the Lean practitioner uses more traditional
tools:
 Markers and flip charts to record idea generation and team sessions.
 Video cameras record the processes, enabling the team to analyze the
film for improvement.
 Still cameras record before and after shots of the areas, particularly in
conjunction with Kaizen events.
 Stopwatches establish and verify performance standards; this data is
then used for line balancing and takt time (see Chapter 4) comparison.
 A toolbox full of screwdrivers, wrenches, and hammers may come in
handy for creating display boards, hanging visual aides or other
improvement activities.
Beginning the Journey: The Lean Rollout
You can start Lean anywhere, in any place, and at any time. There’s no spe-
cial magic place to begin. Often, people just start the process by performing a
5S (see Chapter 8) or a Kaizen Event (see Chapter 6) in an area of need or
256
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

interest. This action begins the journey; then you ensure it’s progressing by
executing to a plan or a framework. Don’t make the rollout a big deal or
burden it with bureaucratic management — keep it straightforward and
simple. It is Lean, after all.
Minding the big picture
True Lean is a process of small, incremental improvements. Sounds simple
enough, except that these improvements are happening all over the enter-
prise involving the entire organization, across multiple value streams, simul-
taneously. If you aren’t careful, things can get out of control. In this section,
we share strategies to keep your Lean efforts on track.
Understanding the enterprise value streams
Within the context of the high-level value stream of the enterprise, most com-
panies have many, many internal value streams. They also may have single
areas, or monuments, that services multiple value streams, such as a large
piece of equipment or a hospital lab. When the organization understands the
many different value streams it has, and how those different value streams
interrelate, the organization is better able to coordinate the improvement
efforts and avoid sub-optimizing (improving one part of the enterprise at the
peril of another).
Avoiding the Kaizen blitzkrieg
Especially in the beginning of the Lean journey, people are motivated to get
something done — and now! Many organizations respond to this urgency by
hosting as many Kaizen events as they possibly can. They may instill a metric
for the number of Kaizen activities performed. In response, everyone runs
right out and checks off the “I did a Kaizen!” box — without coordination,
without a larger scale vision, without connection.
When all these blitzes are happening at once, the results are minimized. One
area may free up floor space, but it may be too small or in the wrong location
to be useful or to amount to a true savings. In another scenario, one area may
move the muda (see Chapter 3) to another part of the facility or value stream,
without truly eliminating anything.
Don’t turn your Kaizen blitz into a Kaizen blitzkrieg — where instead of
improvement, you leave only devastation behind. Build into your process ways
to coordinate the Kaizen activities, so that you yield overall improvements.
Kaizen events are a great way to start, but they need a proper scope, vision
and tie to the performance objectives of the organization.
257
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

Connecting the pieces
The Lean toolbox has an array of different tools (refer to Part III: Chapters 7
through 10). The organization must understand how, when, and why the dif-
ferent tools are used. If you’re trying to level schedules and implement
kanban (see Chapter 8), yet your changeover times are still counted in days,
you’re implementing the wrong tool at the wrong time. By understanding
each tool in the toolkit, you’ll better match the implementation of the tech-
niques to your particular situation.
Most organizations have other initiatives occurring in the organization. These
initiatives may be continuous-improvement initiatives or large-scale projects
like an ERP implementation or an acquisition. The organization must define
how all these things fit together.
Neglecting to connect the dots for the organization will cause confusion and
fuel the rumor mill. Some people in the organization will be waiting for Lean
to fail and will jump to the conclusion that Lean is just another “program of
the month.” Showing the organization how it all fits together will help mini-
mize the impact of these naysayers.
Keeping your finger on the pulse of the organization
As we discuss in Chapters 11 and 12, communication is the lifeblood of the
Lean transformation. You need to take the pulse of the organization, continu-
ally. If the organization starts either reverting backward to un-Lean behaviors
and tendencies or moving off course, you need to know this and correct it.
Enlist volunteers from various parts of the organization to act as a communica-
tion council. This strategy will help you keep the message real, keep the move-
ment consistent, and keep you connected to the pulse of the organization.
Picking the starting point
As an actor studies a role to bring art to life, he asks the question, “What’s
my motivation?” When you’re bringing Lean to life in your organization, you,
too, should ask yourself this question: What’s your motivation? Identify
where you have the greatest pain points or the greatest opportunities, which
will impact the organization in a strategic manner. Find your greatest motiva-
tion and you’ve found your starting point.
Impact on the customer
The first place to look is where you have the greatest impact on the cus-
tomer. Evaluate where your relationships are strained with customers and
identify the potential sources of the issues. Brainstorm all the potential
causes. Then apply the right combination of improvements and monitor the
progress. Build the relationship through action and communication.
258
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

The enterprise 5S blitz?
An easy way to start is to 5S (see Chapter 8) all the departments in a given
facility. If you choose this path, you really need to understand your motiva-
tion. The 5S tool is a great one (your facility will be neat and clean!), but you
must ask yourself if this is the best way to start your Lean journey. The
answer is “not usually.” The 5S tool is more powerful when used in combina-
tion with other tools or in conjunction with a greater vision.
Quick visual improvement
If your motivation is to build momentum, you want to find a starting point
that has impact and is quick, visual, and relevant, like:
 Removing an inventory warehouse or storage
 Reducing setup times from hours to minutes
 Reducing repair time for vehicles needed to support soldiers in the field
Wide-open spaces
If your motivation is to create space in your facility to accommodate new
business, eliminate lease payments, or bring workgroups together, you’ll
want to create wide-open spaces. You’ll need to free up large concentrated
spaces in your facility. Start by conducting a series of coordinated Kaizen and
5S activities to create the right space in the right location.
Creating awareness
In the beginning of your Lean journey, you want to create a buzz, get people
excited, and engage them in your Lean efforts. As you progress, you want to
keep the organization motivated and involved in the Lean transformation.
Ultimately, you want your organization to live and breathe Lean. None of this
will happen if your people don’t know what is going on. In this section, we tell
you ways to create the buzz, improve communication, and engage people for
the long haul.
Communicating the rollout plan
Communicating the plan to the organization will help create a buzz in the
organization. Giving people information about upcoming changes will help
them to overcome any anxieties they may have about the change in the envi-
ronment to Lean. Again, communicate in a manner that appeals to a variety of
learning styles (see Chapters 11 and 12).
259
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

Leading by listening
Listening is one of the most powerful communication skills a person can
develop. Whether you’re on an intentional gemba walk or hanging out at the
water cooler, listening will enable you to gauge the pulse of the people. Figure
13-1 depicts an effective listening model.
Highlighting progress
As you start to make progress, communicate! Let the organization know what
has happened, why it’s important to them, what is slated to happen next, and
how that is relevant for them. Highlighting progress is your opportunity to
celebrate wins — large and small.
Reinforcing the long-term view
Constantly keeping the motivation and long-term vision in front of people will
make Lean real for them, even if their area hasn’t yet started implementation.
The message to the organization is that this is not about a Kaizen here and
there — Lean is about the long-term sustainability and viability of the organi-
zation as a whole.
Lean by doing
The best way to create awareness and understanding of Lean is to get
involved. Get on a Kaizen team, 5S your workspace, learn a new technique
and find a pertinent application for it. There is no better way to grasp the
concepts of Lean than by actively participating and implementing improve-
ments every day.

Avoiding program-of-the-month syndrome
Since the beginning of continuous-improvement time, battling program-of-the-
month syndrome has been an organizational challenge. As long as there are
consultants, new methodologies will be introduced into the market. Or when
movements lose steam in an organization, clever consultants or opportunis-
tic leaders repackage tools and techniques with a twist. Companies that are
truly committed to the Lean journey will find ways to keep the journey invigo-
rated and determine how best to fit in new methodologies. In the following
sections, we give you tips how to avoid the program-of-the-month syndrome.
Talking the talk
Communication is really, really important along your entire Lean journey.
People need to know what’s happening, how it affects them, and that you’re
truly committed to the trip. If you do not, people will make things up, start
rumors or do nothing in hopes that “this too shall pass.” (See Chapter 12 for
more about the importance of a communication strategy to help people
change.)
Walking the walk
If yesterday, you hailed the TLA (Three-Letter Acronym) Improvement
Program, today you cheerlead the Charge for Lean, and tomorrow you’re
touting a new program called Ten Thetas, you’ll feed organizational frenzy.
You’ll doom your improvement journey to a certain death at the hands of the
cynics and naysayers. Your behaviors must reflect that you’re a serious prac-
titioner and leader of a Lean process initiative. If you’re inconsistent and non-
committal, Lean will be just another bygone program of the month.
Separating the wheat from the chaff: Handling new initiatives
As new initiatives rise to the surface, you will need to have a process to
triage their impact and determine what to do about them. Whether it’s a new
whiz-bang IT solution or the latest incarnation of continuous improvement
with a consultant’s twist, you need to know how that initiative will affect your
Lean journey. Ask yourself the following questions:
 Does this initiative have relevance to the organization? If so, where in
the organization does it fit?
 What activities are currently underway in these areas?
 Is there overlap between this initiative and Lean?
 How does the Lean initiative facilitate the activity?
 How and when should the organization incorporate this initiative?
 How does it all fit together, and what does the organization need to know?
261
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

Great expectations
By setting the expectations with the staff, customers, stakeholders, and
others, you support the Lean principles and establish the behaviors and tone
for the organization. When you’re clear about the performance and behaviors
you expect, and when you hold all the people in the organization account-
able, they know that Lean is here for the long term and isn’t just a passing
fancy. When you connect the dots for them in terms of Lean, you reinforce
that Lean is the foundation and that any other activity or initiative has to be
interpreted in the context of Lean.
Measurable outcomes
When you continually show measurable progress, you build momentum in
the organization. As the momentum builds, you increase your progress.
Staying the course with Lean — and keeping the momentum going — will
show the organization that Lean is not just here for the short term.
Put the outcomes in terms that any individual can see and understand.
Translate the impact to a personal level. The outcomes are not necessarily
direct financial measures; they could be freed-up floor space, decreased time
to serve a customer, a reduced approval chain, or anything that the individ-
ual can observe and use to verify the longer-term performance.
Measurements: The enterprise at a glance
When you’re rolling out Lean, you need to determine what the relevant mea-
surements are for your organization. Table 13-1 shows an example of a Lean
measurement matrix. Performance charts like this one are then displayed for
people to see how the business is doing.

The closer you can tie your Lean implementation metrics to overall company
performance metrics, the more meaningful the Lean implementation metrics
are from a business standpoint. A double digit savings in floor space is great,
but if you don’t have work to put in it, then the freed-up floor space doesn’t
mean much to the business.
Localized within a value steam, you may want to add other measures — both
process and outcome metric — relevant to Lean implementation. Example
metrics could include:
 Percent of team cross-trained
 Performance to takt
 Actual setup reduction versus target
 Percent of Kaizen events complete versus planned
 Number of work orders completed to plan
Reading data in a graphical form is easier than reading it in a text form. Post
graphs of these metrics in communication stations in your facility and on
your intranet.
Living Lean
After your Lean initiative gets its legs and begins to run, your organization is
changed forever. The positive effects of Lean are contagious, and the mindset
of Kaizen has a certain dogged determination and undeniability about it. As a
result, over time, your enterprise Lean initiative will evolve into an ongoing,
sustaining phase. This is when you know you’re living Lean.
263
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

The Lean evolution
The evolution of a Lean initiative begins with the rollout phase and moves
into its sustaining phase sometime after everyone has been trained, Kaizen
events have been performed across the enterprise, and the positive results
have occurred widely enough and consistently enough that everyone begins
to believe in its power.
After Lean has been validated through repeated successes over a wide range
of applications, the cultural adoption will set in. Through everyone’s com-
bined behaviors, the Lean principles will be absorbed and the organization
will begin to think of itself as a Lean enterprise.
What happens then? Are you “done”? Have you “become Lean”? Can you now
put the Lean techniques and methods and tools aside — thank you very 
much — and move on with your business? The answer to these questions is
“absolutely not!” You don’t put anything aside.
The minute you declare your organization “Lean” is the minute you’ve lost
your way!
Inwardly Lean
The first Lean activities begin with training and Kaizen events (see Chapters
6 and 8 for more on Kaizen), usually in a selected program area or work-
group. Successful events give rise to improvement projects. These projects
address a specific challenge area in a particular value stream, and involve
time and effort on the part of a project team and the Lean sensei, who
together apply the Lean toolkit. After a few projects have been successful and
the positive results become visible, the participants all begin to truly inter-
nalize the value, and they understand the power of the approach. Others
begin to notice. People start initiating small projects in their work areas and
as part of their workgroups.
The next step in the Lean evolution is the development of an enterprise pro-
ject-oriented mindset, where challenges are addressed with Lean projects on
a broader scale — both within their value streams and in concert with other
value streams. At first, this may be a look over the wall at some closely
related function or department in the organization (see Chapter 14 for an
exploration of the relationship between two such groups: the development
and production teams). Integrated enterprise value-stream activities will
begin between organizations like marketing and IT or between design and
customer service.
This is the point where everyone is “doing” Lean stuff. It’s a very exciting
time: The organization is growing and learning, people are improving their
work processes and environments, and the results are showing — in
264
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

improved business productivity and performance. Figure 13-2 shows how
Lean organizations evolve over time.
In a large organization, it takes years to reach a level of ubiquitous enterprise-
wide Lean practice.
At some point, someone in the organization climbs the next rung on the evo-
lution ladder. Instead of creating a project team to approach a challenge, he
just goes off and Leans-up a value stream on his own. No fanfare, no project
team or official results — he makes the Nike marketing team proud and “just
does it.” At this stage, the mechanical formalities begin to drop away and the
mindsets begin to change. People begin to see the world through different
eyes. They’re acting on instinct. They’re thinking Lean.
Outwardly Lean
After people within their own work areas become comfortable with internal
projects, they begin examining the cause-and-effect conditions that give rise
to the waste in their segment of the value stream. Very quickly, this leads to
an expansion of view: They begin to look outside their own world.
Groups begin to look up and down their value stream. They begin to suggest
projects with suppliers, and other projects with customers. Eventually, this
may lead to integrated value-stream projects involving suppliers, customers,
and even the customers’ customers. Meanwhile, groups within the enterprise
have begun to explore the relationships between them more fully.

All these are examples of outward Lean behavior. Outwardly, Lean is impor-
tant, because it represents the emergence of a systems view, the more holis-
tic view of the organization and its life in the value chain. The external view
provides the objectivity needed to adjust how the enterprise fits into the
world. It promotes adaptivity — the ability to adapt and survive in the eco-
nomic gene pool.
This adaptivity leads to a decrease in what’s known as functional sub-
optimization (a phenomenon where a lot of time and effort are spent fixing
problems in a function or area that don’t matter in the bigger picture).
Functional sub-optimization is a symptom of inward focus, where you think
your world and your problems are the only ones that matter. Don’t be mis-
taken: Improving any area and removing waste from any value stream are the
right things to do, but diverting enterprise resources to further strengthening
a strong link in the chain when there are weak links all around isn’t a smart
move.
Eliminating waste is just that. It’s not moving waste. Using logistics tools like
postponement, third-party kitting, distribution centers, and topping up to
move your waste to someone else is nothing more than sweeping dirt under
the rug. Sure, your room looks clean, but the dirt is still there. Don’t move
muda; eliminate it.
Building the learning organization
Maturing Lean organizations have a passion and zest for learning. Part of the
culture of openness that accompanies the Lean mindset is a desire to contin-
uously learn. It’s part of the journey — the recognition that you’re never
done.
The learning organization is continuously curious. People recognize that
what they knew yesterday may be outdated, and that new knowledge 
today will make them better tomorrow. They never feel like they know 
everything — there’s a world of evolving knowledge out there and much
more to learn.
In the learning organization, everyone has the mutual trust and comfort to
examine mistakes and truly learn from them. Post-mortem examinations
aren’t finger-pointing sessions — they’re improvement sessions. They seek to
find cause, not assign blame. The learning organization has a continuous
sharing of knowledge and a sense of need for shared or “tribal” knowledge.
Hallmarks of the learning organization are obvious and everywhere:
266
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Education and training is a priority. It’s the last thing to fall victim to
budget pressures.
 Everyone participates in cross-training programs. When workloads
shift, people are quickly cross-trained and develop the proficiency to
pick up the slack.
 Contributions to increased knowledge and proficiency are supported
and rewarded.
 People conduct early-morning education sessions and brown-bag
lunch-and-learn sessions, and there is a full slate of well-attended
evening classes.
 When necessary, people stop what they’re doing to train and educate
someone who needs additional knowledge for everyone to move for-
ward at the proper takt.
 The organization has a formal mentorship program.
 Libraries and online reference materials are readily available, contin-
uously updated, and used extensively.
 Everyone occasionally attends a book-review discussion, a confer-
ence, or a symposium, and they actively seek to present at these
events.
 People in the organization write papers, publish articles, and author
books.
 People actively monitor and participate in online chat forums and
subject-specific blogs.
The curiosity of the learning organization is naturally contagious, but the
framework and support mechanisms must be deliberately and proactively
supported. Senior management, middle management, and supervisors must
all foster the learning culture by budgeting the time and expense to facilitate
the learning organization. Also, in the spirit of leading by doing, managers
must actively participate.
Creating the continuous-improvement
mindset
Although learning is an important enabler, the other side of the coin is appli-
cation. Knowledge is one thing; putting it into action is another. The Lean
organization’s thirst for knowledge is complemented by an equally strong
continuous hunger for improvement. It’s all about progress.
267
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

The continuous-improvement mindset is driven by the notion that no matter
where we are or what we’ve achieved, we can always accomplish something
better:
 We can find and remove more waste.
 We can balance the cycle time to the takt time.
 We can remove more defects, reduce variation, and improve the quality.
 We can delight our customers even more.
 We can make our value chain more effective.
 We can improve our use of technology.
 We can better apply ourselves, working smarter.
 We can make a difference and make it better.
Continuous improvement isn’t a death march. It’s not tireless drudgery. This
isn’t an assault on Mount Everest. The maturing Lean organization doesn’t
feed off Herculean victories; it thrives on constant progress. The Lean mind-
set, therefore, never has the need to rest on its laurels, because it never 
tires out.
The Lean organization is like a long-distance runner, rather than a sprinter.
Lean is a sustainable aerobic movement, leveraged through fitness, disci-
plined through training, maintained by momentum, fueled by balanced nutri-
tion, and spiced by endorphins.
Facilitating with finance
The finance and accounting functions directly support the Lean journey by
providing financial measures of the benefits and effectiveness of processes
and operations as they’re transformed.
There’s nothing like financial incentives to move the mountain. When Lean
processes make money, everyone notices. The finance and accounting func-
tion is responsible for working with the Lean practitioners across the enter-
prise to define the key metrics that demonstrate the financial benefits that
accrue from Lean process improvements.
Standard accounting practices and systems don’t capture, manage, analyze,
or report financial information according to Lean practices. You need to
develop specialized applications first, and then tune the financial systems
over time, in order to implement financial practices that align with your Lean
initiative.
268
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Because Lean operations cut across traditional functional boundaries and
generate new types of metrics, traditional accounting systems and measures
don’t facilitate the Lean organization. Not having the right metrics can be a
real problem. Remember the part about how the finance organizations are
slow to change? When you ask them to change how the beans are counted,
you may encounter some resistance.
Getting support from IT
The IT organization must provide the Lean enterprise with information-
management resources and activities that support Lean processes. These
include specific tools as well as certain integration and reporting capabilities.
Oh, and then there’s enterprise resource planning (ERP).
Lean and enterprise applications
Increasingly, specialized enterprise application environments support Lean
information and management needs. Business activity monitoring (BAM)
tools and business process management (BPM) tools are large-scale enter-
prise-class application software solutions that provide sweeping capabilities
in the areas of data collection, analysis, reporting, monitoring (dashboards),
and control. In some cases, these have evolved to real-time control systems
that directly control such critical operational elements as inventory, supply,
distribution, and more.
Lean and ERP
The promise of the truly integrated Lean enterprise is now causing organiza-
tions of all types and sizes to examine and reassess how they use their tradi-
tional enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Although ERP systems 
were pivotal in creating large-scale efficiencies and implementing cost-effective
processes in a variety of industries, IT organizations are beginning to realize
that the Lean enterprises require a different approach.
Some organizations are delaying or shelving elements of ERP implementa-
tions in order to institute Lean practices first. This way, they don’t lock in
software-driven operational frameworks that are counter to Lean techniques.
Now I am the master
As the initiative matures, Lean principles and behaviors are carried forth in an
organization more by momentum and cultural predisposition than by impulse.
It’s not a matter of who carries the torch, because everyone is carrying his
269
Chapter 13: Go Lean: Implementation Strategy, Startup, and Evolution

own torch. Lean behaviors become ingrained, and, because organizations are
slow to change, those behaviors don’t disappear. Continuous learning and
improvement become cultural mainstays.
Still, management must maintain leadership and continue the Lean direction.
They must continue to exhibit Lean behaviors and ensure the organization
stays on course.
An enterprise doesn’t need to maintain a significant organizational entity to
support the long-term Lean initiative. However, a core group is required:
 To maintain and channel the organization’s Lean practices.
 To integrate Lean practices into other organizations — such as new sup-
pliers, merger or acquisition partners, and new distributors.
 To stay abreast of Lean developments and trends in other industries.

Chapter 14
Lean within the Enterprise
In This Chapter
 Recognizing that Lean applies everywhere — not just in manufacturing
 Identifying how Lean is practiced within different business activities and functions
M
ost people equate Lean with Lean Manufacturing, because Lean prac-
tices were first developed for improving production processes in the
automotive industry. During the 1990s, most businesses did concentrate their
Lean efforts on manufacturing functions like fabrication and assembly.
However, with such great successes on the shop floor, Lean practitioners
have more recently applied their methods and techniques in other areas of
the enterprise. Nowadays, you’re just as likely to see Kaizen events, Value
Stream Mapping, and cycle time reduction efforts in many other areas of an
organization, including engineering, administration, and customer care. Lean
isn’t just for shop-floor processes anymore.
This spread of Lean practices across organizations is vitally important for
several reasons.
 Because Lean principles apply to processes in general, nearly any
process can be improved using Lean methods and techniques. Is there
any process that wouldn’t be improved by reducing waste?
 By applying Lean across the enterprise, the multidisciplinary views and
experiences contribute to the practice, and benefit the science of Lean.
 Practicing Lean everywhere benefits the practice of Lean anywhere. As
we stress throughout this book, Lean is not a sideshow — it’s not just
something done by the worker bees off in a corner of the organization.
Lean is a philosophy, and the more widely it’s practiced in the organiza-
tion, the greater the understanding, acceptance, and support it will
receive in each area of implementation.
In this chapter, you see how Lean can be applied from top to bottom and from
wall to wall in an organization. From the executive suite to the engineering lab,
and from the procurement office to the customer-service center, Lean prac-
tices reduce waste, time, and mistakes, and improve overall performance.

Lean Enterprise Management
In the Lean enterprise, people consider the whole business system. They con-
duct improvement activities at all levels with a complete view — seeing not
just their own value stream and their own customers, but everyone’s cus-
tomers, the organization’s customers, and the end consumers. Everyone
examines the processes that influence outcomes — causes and effects — and
sees the organization through two lenses:
 Kaizen maintenance: Following the policies and rules that maintain the
performance levels set by the present operating standards
 Kaizen improvement: Efforts to continuously improve existing stan-
dards and processes or innovate new ones
Across the enterprise, all training, materials, tools, support, and supervision
contribute to both the improvement and the maintenance of standards on a
continual basis. This business philosophy calls for never-ending efforts that
involve everyone — managers and workers alike.
It’s a Lean, Lean, Lean, Lean world
Lean has grown up and moved beyond its roots in the production and assem-
bly bays of industrial manufacturing. Now you can practice Lean anywhere.
Don’t look now, but most of what happens in many organizations isn’t in
hard-core physical manufacturing at all. While Lean was growing up in places
like the automotive assembly arena, many organizations were evolving.
Nowadays, most — if not all — of many enterprises conduct their business
above and beyond what’s known as the “shop floor.”
Transactional Lean
You can practice Lean in the transaction processes — business processes
whose primary role is to transact information or data. This includes
processes within finance and accounting, contracts, procurement, legal,
human resources and information technology. Just because you’re not
making something physical doesn’t mean your processes are free of waste.
Transaction processes typically don’t waste much direct material, but they
can waste things that can be worth a lot more, including
 Time: Poor transaction management wastes huge amounts of time. The
Lean practice of cycle-time reduction is a strong focus in these areas.
 Facilities: Transaction processes use facilities just like physical
processes do — office buildings and data centers, mostly. Poor transac-
tion management consumes excess square footage.
272
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Energy: When you’re wasting space, chances are, you’re wasting energy,
too. Offices are big energy consumers, and data centers are even bigger
energy consumers. Overtime, excess travel, rework — these all consume
energy needlessly.
 People: Worst of all, by not properly utilizing people, organizations fall
well short of their potential.
Waste is harder to see in transactional areas. You can easily see waste in the
physical areas: parts, inventory, material, people who aren’t working, and so
on. But waste is harder to recognize in transactions. Is that person sitting in
front of his computer adding value? Is the computer program he’s running
adding value? Is the process that’s consuming the results of that program
adding value? You have to really look.
The value-stream manager
Lean organizations have a role called the value-stream manager. This person
is responsible for the end-to-end Lean improvements and maintenance of one
or more value streams. The role of value-stream manager is multifunctional
role — it integrates multiple disciplines and functional areas to optimize a
given value stream. The value-stream manager role might be played by a
product-line manager, who owns the profit and loss (P&L) for a family of
products or services, and who would oversee the many value streams for
those products or services. The value-stream manager role could also be
played by a project or program manager, with a focus on a single program or
project. The value-stream manager might also be an assigned role within an
operational area.
Leaning up the support functions
Lean practices within an organization’s support functions have a huge posi-
tive outcome. Long dubbed the overhead groups, these are the departments
that, in general, add little or no value directly to the customer. In a high-level
Value Stream Map (VSM), there’s no value-added in a contract, an accounting
procedure, or business travel. It’s all muda.
How ironic that these business functions don’t receive a lot of process-
improvement attention! They get all kinds of budget pressure, and the IT ven-
dors have a bandoleer of silver bullets for them, but efficiencies alone are the
wrong answer. These functions generally don’t receive much help in focusing
on change, because enterprises tend to save their improvement energy for
their core processes. As a result, these functions tend to grow out of date and
become self-serving and replete with waste. Across the enterprise, Lean prac-
tices tend to have big impacts in these areas.
273
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

It’s important for these functions and departments to be Lean. However, in an
overhead organization, it’s not just about Value Stream Mapping to reduce
inefficiencies and lower costs. You have to conduct Lean efforts within a
framework that aligns these organizations with the organization’s strategic
objectives and customer needs. Never lose sight of what creates value for the
customer!
Lean finance and administration
Most people think those penny-pinchers do things about as Lean as you can
imagine. But the financial and administrative departments in organizations
are naturally conservative and slow to change, so over time they tend to
build up and carry forward arcane procedures and excess baggage. This
buildup results in slower throughput, higher labor costs, and increased diffi-
culty satisfying their customers.
The results returned from initiating Lean practices in finance and administra-
tive functions are often swift and significantly positive. Because these func-
tions consist of many independent processes, beginning focused incremental
improvements within them is less daunting than it is to ponder large-scale
overhauls, top-down reengineering, or big technology initiatives. These
departments have been told for years that they need to be more customer-
focused; the Lean toolkit enables them to deliver on that mantra.
The scope of Lean practice facilitates improvements in all the finance and
administrative functions, including:
 Accounting: Traditional accounting conventions and practices can be
rethought from the viewpoint of what truly adds value to the customer,
as well as reducing waste and cycle time. Eliminate unnecessary
accounting and control transactions. Create business measures in terms
of customer value.
 Contracts: The business contracting function has suffered in recent
years from an onslaught of legal “protections.” All customers, partners,
contractors, and suppliers suffer under the principle that the extra effort
is worth it if it prevents one failed lawsuit. Without unduly sacrificing
protection, considerable waste can be culled from the contracting arena.
Think customer value and cycle-time reduction.
 Legal: Corporate legal services believe their customer is the corporation
and they work to protect the corporation from onslaught and exposure.
However, corporate attorneys spend their days working with people
whose needs are immediate and direct. Cycle time is money.
 Travel: Travel is mostly a non-value added activity, although Lean prac-
tice calls for genchi genbutsu (the practice of going out and seeing it for
yourself). Standardize work for travel arrangements and Lean up the
travel function. From the Lean viewpoint, which is the better option:
having everyone waste their time making their own arrangements, or
274
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

wasting a central office or agent’s time making the arrangements for
them?
 Copy center: Paper is waste. Documents are pure muda. Creating paper,
printing and binding documents, shipping them, carrying them, storing
them — these are all traditions that have less and less relevance in the
modern world.
 Mail room: The iconic first rung on the corporate ladder, the mail room,
is a showcase for Lean. Standardized work, waste-reduction, and cycle
time are hallmarks of Lean and all apply perfectly to the mail room.
You can introduce Lean in these areas by facilitating Kaizen events, coupled
with a modest amount of training, supported by the following management
behaviors:
 Use performance measures that motivate Lean actions, reward Lean
behaviors, and incentivize the elimination of unnecessary overhead.
 Define and measure standardized work processes.
 Build VSMs that show how the processes generate direct internal 
customer value.
 Facilitate understanding of its role in the organization as a whole and
how it delivers value to its customers.
 Cross-train, enabling the shifting of work for rotations and peak load
management.
 Define internal business measures in terms of customer value.
Lean in human resources
Human resources (HR) departments have experienced enormous staff and
expense growth in recent years, due to increased personnel support needs.
Lean HR helps better align the HR function to the core needs of the business,
reduce expenses, and shorten the time to support the organization’s HR
needs. The HR function also has a critical role in supporting Lean initiatives
across the enterprise.
Lean HR improves the performance of its internal processes through value-
added, customer (staff) satisfaction, process cycle-time reduction, and a mea-
surable high quality of results. Lean areas of focus in HR include
 New-hire cycle time: The time lag between a business area identifying
the need for additional personnel and the time that an individual is
onboard can run from weeks to months. Requisitions, postings, résumé
reviews, interviews, background checks, follow-ups — all these routine
activities have built up in the effort to ensure a quality hire. How can
this process be streamlined for greater effectiveness?
275
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

 Recruiting: What’s the Value Stream Map for the recruiting process? The
recruiting process is a form of marketing; how do your future employee
“customers” see it?
 Benefits administration: How are benefit programs structured? How are
benefit packages defined? How are the options communicated? How are
changes communicated? How do employees select and manage their
programs? All of these are part of the benefits “product” offering to the
employee “consumer.”
 Training and development: By closely aligning with the lines of busi-
ness, understanding strategic directions, and supporting the staff, HR
plays a key role in organizational readiness and performance through its
training and development function. The goal is knowledge. How effective
is HR in getting knowledge into the heads of the staff?
 Satisfaction and retention: Although the rest of the organization often
exploits the talents and energies of the staff, HR is the watchdog for the
staff’s ongoing satisfaction and for ensuring long-term retention.
Think about other HR processes that can benefit from Lean practice. How can
Lean help in managing workplace diversity? How about outsourcing?
Compensation plans? Change management?
Lean in information technology
The words Lean and information technology (IT) haven’t been spoken
together often in the past. IT has been anything but Lean in nearly every
sense — non-value-added work, considerable nonstandard work, batch pro-
cessing, redundant processing, push flow, over-capacity, disconnection from
customers and consumers — you name it. IT has been the un-Lean. And the
vendors haven’t helped, having provided expensive and brittle systems.
The IT function can help contribute to the Lean enterprise in several areas:
 Customer focus: Customer focus is a broken record in enterprise IT. For
over 25 years, the users have been too disjointed and disconnected from
IT. Of all the classic gulfs that have divided the enterprise, this rift ranks
near the top. But Lean provides methods and tools for bridging this gap.
And it’s not just about the immediate internal customer; it’s also about
knowing the organization’s customers and the role of the organization in
the value chain to the end consumer.
 Reducing non-value-added activity: Streamline all IT processes, and
eliminate outdated processes, paper reports, multiple handling of infor-
mation (both internally in IT and externally in the business), redundant
processing, and other processes.
276
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Single-piece flow: Because IT shops traditionally work as project shops,
the concept of single-piece flow is pretty-well understood already.
Applications, integrations and database programs are conceived,
designed, developed, tested, and integrated as single units and delivered
as they’re built. This is an important basis to build on!
 Customer pull: In times gone by, applications and systems were simply
too big and too chunky to support customized individual needs. As a
result, they got even bigger and chunkier in an attempt to be all things
to all users. IT now has the tools to support customer needs on an indi-
vidualized basis. Moreover, these tools can support individual needs by
end customers and consumers. Information can now be processed and
delivered at the rate of customer demand.
 The end of batching: Batch runs have been a trademark process of IT
for decades. Even with the advent of modern systems that can support
more real-time integrated and continuous-flow data processing, how-
ever, batch processing is still commonplace. But it’s on its way out.
Vendor-led improvements in technology and software architectures, coupled
with significantly lower price points, and advances in systems engineering,
development processes, and IT practices, have combined to change the IT
equation. And that’s critical, because a key leverage point in Lean comes
from IT’s role in the integration between core business processes, the inter-
nal supply chain, and the larger external supply-chain environment.
The IT organization can improve its effectiveness by embracing Lean prac-
tices and the philosophy of Kaizen within its operations.
Many organizations attempt to fix broken business processes with IT.
However, no matter how Lean your IT solution is, it will not fix a broken
process. Simplify and/or eliminate processes before you automate and inte-
grate them. Eliminating waste before you automate a business process will
save you time and money in the long run.
Lean Product Development
More than ever, businesses of all types and sizes are pressured to develop
and bring innovative, high-quality products and services to market rapidly.
New product development efforts are now characterized by ever-shortening
product-development cycles, lower budgeted development costs, and
increases in levels of product quality. More demanding customer require-
ments are pushing the envelopes of features, customization, energy effi-
ciency, environmental compatibility, reliability, maintainability, and life-cycle
cost of ownership.
277
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Lean product development processes enable the enterprise to produce prod-
ucts and services faster, with fewer resources, and at higher levels of quality,
while using less capital and making happier customers. Lean product devel-
opment practices help designers address a myriad of challenges that con-
spire against them, such as:
 Lack of a detailed understanding of customer requirements
 Haphazard work standards, with low process standardization
 Inability to effectively reuse previous designs
 Time and cost to produce expensive prototypes
 Unnecessary product and process complexity
 Use of uncommon or nonstandard parts and practices
 Last-minute design changes
 Large-scale validation testing
 Designs driven by tradition, politics, or perception
What happens during the development process affects what happens in the
manufacturing and production processes. Product development is the head-
waters of the company’s performance. Well-integrated designs lead to greater
efficiencies, reduced variation, and higher quality outcomes on the produc-
tion end.

279
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Product development: The 
systems approach
The first rule of Lean development is to bring a complete, holistic view to the
development process. The three major components of the development
world — people, processes, and technology — must be fully integrated and
mutually supportive. Furthermore, they must be in alignment, not only with
one another, but with the goals and strategies of the organization as a whole.
When these three fundamental system components are made coherent by
design, they create a type of synergistic systems effect, each balancing with
and playing off the other.
Hearing the voice of the customer
Every developer should hear that little birdie on his shoulder . . . chirp-chirp!
That’s the voice of the customer, singing in your ear, as you contemplate your
next move. Are you listening? Can you hear the customer talking? What do
you hear the customer saying?
The Lean development process should be closely bonded with the customer.
The Lean process hears the customer’s voice first, foremost, and louder than
any other voice. The customer voice not only tells the developers what to
design, but the customer’s notion of value reveals much about the design
process — and thereby helps the developers eliminate non-value-added steps
and activities.
Refer to Chapter 3 for information on how the customer defines value, and
refer to Chapter 7 for the tools used in the design/development process. The
Lean system enables the developer to understand the customer require-
ments and systematically translate those requirements into functional prod-
ucts and services.
Lean development comes from an intimate understanding of customer-
defined value. The system components — people, process, and technology —
must be tuned to understand customer-defined value from the start. Product
development must deliver a product design that accomplishes two goals —
meeting the customer needs and manufacturing efficiently — if you expect to
actually deliver this value to the customer.
280
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Front-loading the engineering process
Most of the cost of any final product or service is locked in long before the
product is formally launched. Overly complex designs cannot be “Leaned
out” in the manufacturing process. Slow design efforts delay market readi-
ness, negatively impacting market share and profitability. And you can’t
market and sell your way past products designed without the voice of the
customer.
Poor design and development planning undermines Lean Manufacturing.
However, designs arriving late to production, with poor yields, major manu-
facturing deficiencies, and lingering engineering problems have been more
common than not. This is because sufficient time and energy were not allot-
ted to the design and development phase. This short-changing of the engi-
neering cycle is counterproductive, because rushing to production creates
more problems than it solves.
Applying Lean tools and practices during the product-development process
will certainly reduce the development time. But by taking the broader view of
development, the design and development efforts can also reduce manufac-
turing lead times, maximize product performance (from the customer’s view-
point), and maintain the target cost. The earlier in the process these efforts
are applied, the more leverage is gained.
Concurrent engineering
Designing products has always been part of mass production. Early on, the
work was divided between the designer, who created the design, and the
manufacturer, who made the actual product. Over time, this division
widened, until the product designer worked more or less in ignorance of the
manufacturer — and his constraints.
A design thrown over the proverbial wall is often difficult and costly to pro-
duce, resulting in higher production costs, poor quality, and lost time to
market. And yet, this is more the norm than the exception. In fact, the design
function is not the only organization living in a functional silo; many organiza-
tions along the product life cycle often operate with minimal communications
between them, including marketing, development, manufacturing, distribu-
tion, sales, and service. Traditionally, most products go to market in a serial
fashion.
281
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Concurrent engineering (also sometimes called concurrent product develop-
ment or simultaneous execution) is the rational practice of having the design
organization and other enterprise functions become more aware of the activi-
ties occurring beyond the borders of their own department. Concurrent engi-
neering (illustrated in the bottom part of Figure 14-1) replaces a traditional
product development process where functional tasks are performed serially.
In concurrent engineering (CE), everyone collaborates on each aspect of a
product’s development process. This facilitates faster and more thorough
reactions to changing conditions.
Concurrent engineering isn’t unique to Lean, but Lean product development
naturally performs these functions in a concurrent and integrated way. Lean
practice requires early and continuing consideration for every aspect of a
product or service as it is developed and brought to market. Compared to
serial or “stove-piped” processes, it requires more collaboration and involved
leadership, management, and direction. It may also require some organiza-
tional restructuring — involving finance and accounting, HR, and IT for inte-
grated data management.

Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Often different parts of your organization are not co-located in the same facil-
ity. Operations may span the globe. Location is not an excuse for not partici-
pating in the concurrent design process. Use the latest technology tools to
bring the different organizations together virtually.
Genchi genbutsu: Go and see
In the modern, technology-enabled work environment, people seldom feel
compelled to wander beyond the space between the conference room, break
room, and their cubicles (or, for the telecommuter, it’s the space between the
kitchen, back porch, and home office!). Everything is learned via e-mail, con-
ference calls, meetings, and presentations. The world seems large, but in fact
it’s very small.
Kelly Johnson, the famous head of Lockheed’s legendary Skunk Works once
said, “An engineer should never be more than a stone’s throw away from the
physical product.” That’s genchi genbutsu. Other examples of genchi genbutsu
include:
 Visiting the manufacturing facility prior to beginning design work
 Seeing the showroom floor before developing the marketing materials
 Experiencing the product in action before designing the next generation
 Spending time with customer service to better understand warranty
 Visiting your suppliers — and their suppliers — to understand capabili-
ties and constraints
Next time, before drawing premature conclusions based on hearsay, opinion,
or even all that hard data, consider genchi genbutsu — go and see for 
yourself.
Rigorous standardization — 
for maximum flexibility
A constant knock on rigorous methodologies like Lean is that they’re suppos-
edly too rigid. Especially in the quirky, inventive culture of the design world,
isn’t it true that standards and processes do nothing more than take the art
out of the practice? After all, where’s the creativity, if all you’re doing is fol-
lowing someone else’s best practice, right? Nothing could be more wrong.
283
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Lean is not about becoming a robot, programming yourself to perform repeti-
tive tasks with machine-like precision. Lean work standards, best practices,
and waste-reduction initiatives in no way imply you’re limiting creativity and
flexibility. In fact, just the opposite is true.
The development processes in Lean organizations are far more predictable,
effective, and value-added than is otherwise possible. This is because the
development teams are supported by tools and resources (refer to Table
14-1). They eliminate the noise factor of unnecessary randomness and chaos
in the support frameworks, enabling teams to focus more time and energy on
the creative elements. Redeveloping infrastructure on every project or at
every step is wasteful and distractive — it saps creative energy. Such ele-
ments as work protocols, reference designs, and standard processes enable
designers and developers to spend their creative time and energies on the
value-added tasks. Such standards are also crucial to downstream Lean
Manufacturing capabilities.
People fear that these support resources are somehow confining or limiting.
They’re not — they’re enabling and supportive. Without these resources,
developing anything would take more time and effort — and time and effort
are exactly what’s in short supply. Sure, you could have turned loose an infi-
nite number of monkeys and they would have worked up the iPod. But who
has an infinite number of monkeys?
Designing for manufacture
The practice of Design for Manufacturability (DFM) — or Design for Assembly
(DFA) — isn’t unique to Lean. DFM is part of concurrent engineering — it’s
recognizing that it doesn’t matter how beautiful and elegant a design is if you
can’t actually build it. DFM is a collaboration between the design and manu-
facturing functions of an enterprise that ensure the product as-designed can
be developed within reasonable manufacturing limitations.
Designing for Manufacturability greatly improves product quality and
reduces fabrication costs. It’s a matter of involving the manufacturing folks
early in the design process. After completion of preliminary designs, meet
with the manufacturing team (including Lean experts) and review the prod-
uct requirements and design intent. Then, determine the manufacturing
process requirements. The manufacturing staff should determine the process
capabilities that are implied by the design in order to meet product quality,
cost, and availability targets.
284
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

One of the most harrowing problem areas is tolerancing (the practice of defin-
ing tolerance limits for components, parts, and assemblies). Historically,
designers define tolerance limits too casually — and in the process inadver-
tently dictate the capital and process needs of production. The designers
should be careful to avoid unnecessarily tight tolerances that are beyond the
natural capability of the manufacturing processes. In addition, the manufac-
turing team should identify to the designers any manufacturing tolerance
challenges and suggest design or requirements revisions. When new produc-
tion process capabilities are needed, identify these needs early. Figure 14-2
shows how a company ensures DFM through a formal “production prepara-
tion process.”
Simplify design and assembly so that components can only be assembled in
one way; they cannot be reversed.

Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Built-in learning
In Lean, learning and continuous improvement are fundamental parts of
every job. Although certain work skills require special outside training, Lean
process and improvement skills can be acquired and refined as a regular and
routine part of everyday work. Build in learning into your organization by
including such practices as:
 During projects, real-time reviews and learning events encourage every-
one to learn and update their work standards and practices.
 At project milestones and completion, so-called post-mortem reviews
provide additional opportunities for learning.
 Learning and continuous improvement are also part of the problem-
solving process. Multiple potential solutions focus on root cause, and
solutions are designed to stop future reoccurrence.
A few words about software development
Lean practices apply to the process of software development, just as they do
to the development of physical goods and services. Developing so-called vir-
tual products, like software, has its idiosyncrasies, but remember that Kaizen
is an all-encompassing philosophy, and that Lean improves all processes.
Strictly speaking, Lean has nothing specifically to do with hardware or 
software.
All the behaviors, practices, characteristics, and techniques of Lean that
enable the continuous improvement of hardware apply to the way software is
developed as well. These include the focus on the elimination of waste, cus-
tomer value-added, reduced cycle time, and quality.
The most important Lean technique for software development is to simplify
before you code — in other words, fix in design first.
Some of the other important Lean software development techniques include
 Avoid bloatware. Pareto’s Law applies to software utility: 80 percent of
the value in most software is provided by 20 percent of the features.
Don’t waste time and energy designing and developing features no one’s
going to find useful.
 Feel the need for speed. How quickly can you respond to a customer’s
need for new features or functionality? How much non-value-added
activity churns while the clock is ticking? Software should be modular,
flexible, and extendible; teams should be small, fast, and focused.
286
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Maintain “agilability”. Software development teams should be agile —
able to work on any layer, feature, or capability. The goal is just-in-time
software; information available on demand by any customer.
 Simplify the interfaces. The key to modularity and extensibility is to
keep the interfaces clean and simple. Examples include: interfaces
between code modules; functional interfaces between applications and
systems; usage interfaces between departments.
 Hear the customer, hear their customer! Particularly in corporate soft-
ware environments, it’s critical to understand the customer. And under-
stand what your customer is doing for their customer. Capabilities,
timeframes, cost — understand your customer’s issues and what’s
important.
 Work continuously, incrementally. Add capabilities and new features
that your customers need regularly. Lean software continuously devel-
ops and deploys software in small feature sets.
 Maintain standards and standard practices. Software shops really
struggle with internal discipline, and yet it’s an environment where disci-
pline and control is as important as anywhere. Everything from file-
names to coding standards, documentation practices, configuration
management, change control, backups, upgrades and release manage-
ment, and 5S in the workplace.
 Provide visual feedback. The visual status, reporting, metrics, and con-
trols are fully applicable in software environments. Use them liberally!
Lean practices are not in conflict with programming methodologies like
spiral, iterative, agile, and extreme. Lean practices harmonize well with soft-
ware quality approaches like the Capability Maturity Model. Lean software
development acts as a foundation upon which other methods and standards
apply.
Lean Supplier Management
The Lean journey within the enterprise is just that: It’s within the enterprise.
However, supplier performance significantly and materially affects the perfor-
mance of the enterprise. The goal of Lean supplier management is to make
the Value Stream Map organization-independent. Lean supplier management is
a pursuit of seamless integration across a complex interface — the interface
between organizations.
287
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Lean supplier management requires involvement from multiple functions and
departments within the organization. Sometimes, it requires a redefinition of
the entire architecture of the supply process. The goals of Lean supplier man-
agement are
 Value-added: Products and services provided effectively, without waste,
defects, or undue cost.
 Rapid information flow: A smooth, complete, bidirectional flow of both
developmental and operational information
 Effective administration: Easy contractual arrangements, effective
change management
 Uninterrupted material flow: Goods and services connected and deliv-
ered without interruption as scheduled to support your facility
 Inventory management: A strategic balance of inventory across the
supply chain
Behaving like one entity: 
The architecture of supply
Supply chains tend to tier. The automotive industry, for example, has a first
tier of suppliers that provide major components and assemblies to the vehi-
cle brands. In turn, those suppliers have a second tier, that provide sub-
assemblies and smaller components. A third tier provides piece-parts. The
computer industry is similarly tiered, as are most industries.
The number of tiers in an industry, and the number of providers in each tier,
is based on the complexity of the product and the volume of product in the
market. Consequently, there are many players in each tier of industries like
automotive, fewer in the computer industry, and very few in an industry like
running shoes.
Supply architectures naturally balance according to a variety of pressures
and constraints, including
 Drive for simplicity: Towards the fewest number of suppliers to
manage; fewest number of parts to design, assemble, and support
 Strategic competencies: What you choose to make versus what you
bring in from outside experts
 Pricing: What you can make it for versus what the supplier can provide
it for
 Availability: What commodity or near-commodity parts and supplies
are readily available in the marketplace
288
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Binding the links
Supplier relationships should be bound with the longest possible contractual
instruments. Short, re-competed contracts were in vogue in the 1990s, 
but supply chains are most effective when everyone is part of a stable 
consortium.
This collaborative approach enables the supply players to lower their fixed
costs and focus on continuously lowering variable costs. That, in turn,
enables performance measures based on quality and delivery. Longer-term
contracts and trusted relationships also facilitate improved demand manage-
ment and production smoothing.
Let it flow
Flowing information freely with suppliers is a core principle of Lean and is
required to build and optimize your Value Stream Map. Both development
information and demand information are part of the customer-supplier rela-
tionship. The more free-flowing the information, the more effective these 
relationships can be.
Development information involves the sharing of design data, manufacturing
information, expertise, consumer data, and other background information
that assists the players in the supply chain in developing effective products
and services. Often, this information is proprietary, and sharing requires
trust — trust that you won’t share it with one another’s competitor or use it
maliciously. However, sharing of information is one of the key leverage points
of Lean supplier management.
Demand information is critical to the ordering and delivery of materials and
services. For many years, electronic data interchange (EDI) facilitated the
flow of demand information. More recently, online exchanges and other elec-
tronic systems have facilitated the nearly real-time flow of demand data. This
includes long-term forecasting and replenishment data, as well as order and
delivery data.
Logistics
Logistics management in the Lean world means managing the flow of supplies
to minimize stocking, inventory, or cycle time — anything that would waste
your resources. Lean logistics include the following:
289
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

 Top-up systems: Have commodity items delivered and managed at the
customer’s site — right at the point of use. Have the customer manage
stock-outs.
 Third-party kitting: Subcontract the kitting process, usually to one of
the commodity suppliers. This requires effective traceability manage-
ment. Third-party kitting is popular in the aerospace and automotive
industries.
 Milk runs: Instead of having multiple supplier deliveries to your facility,
you send one truck to collect from several suppliers according to a set
schedule and route. You control the flow of materials to your facility.
 Distribution centers: Have suppliers deliver to a central facility where
the redistribution can occur in a way that best suits the customer. This
provides a type of buffering against shortages, but it also enables assem-
blers to kit more effectively.
Positioning stock strategically in the chain
One of the concerns about Lean is that, when it’s taken to its extreme, there’s
no stock; therefore, if there’s a hiccup anywhere in the system, the entire
supply chain falls apart. You head off this doomsday scenario by positioning
stock strategically along the supply chain.
In Lean, you prefer to hold stock toward the customer end of the chain — so
that it’s available immediately on demand. But keep in mind that this limits
your flexibility, because the stock tends to be committed to that customer.
However, if you hold it early in the supply chain to increase flexibility, it has
less added value.
Through techniques like lead-time analysis and commodity trees, and strate-
gies like postponement and mass customization, you can satisfy nearly any
combination of stock management according to almost any given industry
details.
Lean Production Processes
The Lean movement began in the production arena, on the shop floor, in
Japanese automotive manufacturing and assembly plants. This is where the
Lean philosophy, Lean behaviors, and Lean techniques were first developed
and later honed. There’s a reason why so much of the language of Lean
sounds like you’re making a new Toyota!
290
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Although the rest of this chapter addresses how you can apply Lean to the
many different functional areas of an enterprise, this section is about produc-
tion processes — that infamous shop floor. This is the historical core of Lean.
Lean in the production area has always been about doing more with less —
improving quality and effectiveness while at the same time consuming less
time, fewer resources, less energy, time, inventory, people, and capital. The
classic title “Lean Manufacturing” has been applied to the greater movement
that eliminates waste (muda), streamlines processes, and speeds up overall
production, while enabling and respecting the people.
In a Lean Manufacturing environment, production workers use the broad set
of tools and techniques described in detail in Chapters 7 through 10. Lean
techniques a) lower production costs, b) improve product/service quality, c)
shorten time to delivery, and d) improve employee morale — all while
delighting the customer! Lean Production techniques are different from those
used for 20th-century industrial mass manufacturing.
The key tenets of Lean Production are
 The customer defines value, and all production people, systems, and
processes are focused on adding to that value.
 Reduce and eliminate waste — wasted time, energy, space, people, and
capital.
 Instead of focusing just on outcomes, focus on the processes across the
entire value chain that produce those outcomes. Use Value Stream
Mapping, Kaizen, and standardized work as key enabling tools.
 Practice continuous flow — even if you have to rearrange facilities and
systems and put in new control and measurement systems. Produce to a
cadence, as measured by takt time.
 Through shortened equipment setup times, move to producing small
lots, “every product every day”, and to single-piece flow.
 Reduce and eliminate inventory and storage. Move to a demand pull
system that’s initiated by customer action.
 Practice Kaizen, develop a Lean way of thinking, and continuously
improve processes.
Production is that place in the value stream where the product or service is
created for the customer. It’s where the action is — and where it’s easiest to
see the process in action. Lean practice applies the visual tools for quickly
seeing status and reference.
The production arena is where most companies start their Lean efforts.
Unfortunately, it’s also where many stop them. Don’t let this happen to you!
291
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Lean Customer Management
Lean principles lead to changes in organizational behavior in many ways. At
the epicenter of this change is the customer. In Lean, the customer is the pri-
mary focus — it’s not that the customer is right, it’s that the customer is
everything. The customer defines value; the customer stimulates the demand
for a product or service; the customer defines the requirements; the cus-
tomer evaluates the results. All processes and activities within the enterprise
are oriented toward the customer and optimized for customer value.
Within this philosophy, the Lean toolkit facilitates the flow of information
from the customer to provide the products and services throughout 
the enterprise. Design information, demand information, operational 
information — it all flows to and from the customer.
But what about the direct relationship with the customer. How is that man-
aged in a Lean environment? Who touches the customer? What’s different
about Lean customer management?
In short, Lean customer management is conducted to the same rules and pro-
tocol, and the same Kaizen, as other enterprise activities. Take the waste out
of customer relationship activities; optimize the value stream of customer-
facing functions; shorten the cycle time of customer response; take a holistic
systems view of the customer; and understand the customer’s customer.
Optimize the customer-facing functions just as you would each of the other
functions across the enterprise.
Most organizations suffer from similar customer management challenges,
including
 Too many front-end processes and systems interacting with the 
customer
 Too many contacts, too many interfaces, and too many handoffs and
delays in managing customer relationships
 Errors in selection, configurations, pricing, quoting, and fulfillment of
customer orders
 Transactional customer relationships without intimacy or longevity.
Lean customer management woos customers for life. The customer relation-
ship is where their expectations meet your abilities, where their goals and
desires are addressed by the outcomes of your enterprise and the capacity of
your systems of development and production. Lean solutions deliver high
levels of satisfaction for both the customer and the enterprise. The direct
relationships are facilitated through the primary processes of marketing,
sales, and service.
292
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Selling the customer
Customers need to quickly evaluate options in order to make selections and
buy. Their ability to select and configure a solution quickly and easily is not
simply a matter of efficiency; it’s the enabler to a buying decision. Think
about the experience of shopping for anything from shoes to computers. You
need to find what you want quickly and easily, or you’ll just become exasper-
ated and go elsewhere. Lean sales ensures the customer a fast, accurate, and
focused path through the maze.
In the online world, tools like product configurators and guided selling tools
enable the customer to move quickly and easily through this process. These
tools match supply and production capacity with customer buying prefer-
ences. Computer companies exemplify this process. If production of 60GB
laptop hard drives is temporarily halted due to a typhoon in Malaysia, the
Dell online configurator tool will quickly entice buyers to select the 80GB
drive through special pricing and incentives. The customers are getting a
deal, while Dell turns a production problem into a marketing opportunity.
Lean selection management also reflects a company’s strategic balance
between standard packaged offerings and mass customization.
Companies struggle with quoting and pricing their products and services.
Pricing sheets, price lists, complex bills of material, pricing changes based on
options and configurations — these issues confuse both the customer and
the sales team. Management approvals, end-of-the-quarter deals to make
quota, and lot reduction pricing all complicate matters, as do the overlaid
enterprise effects like cost of inventory and cost of delivery. Lean sales is the
practice of removing waste and cycle time from the quoting and pricing
processes.
Servicing the customer
Service after the sale is the make-or-break function of the long-term customer
relationship. It’s likely the longest period of direct customer interaction —
longer than the spikes of marketing or sales activity. It brings the customer
back for more — or it drives the customer away, never to return. Because
poor service kills the customer relationship, the customer service function
must be optimized. Design your customer service process to best serve your
direct customer. Once again, Lean practices and techniques apply.
The customer service function is markedly different in business-to-business
(B2B) environments than it is in direct business-to-consumer (B2C) relation-
ships. Design your customer service process to best serve the needs of your
direct customer.
293
Chapter 14: Lean within the Enterprise

Lean and the Quality Organization
The Lean enterprise sees the quality organization in an entirely different
light. The quality function has often been relegated an afterthought role —
reactively inspecting products for defects. Quality in the design arena
involved inspections of designs and drawings.
In the Lean enterprise, the quality function shifts from reactive to preventive,
and looks to develop quality at the source. The quality group analyzes cause
and effect, works to predict failure modes, and prevents them from happen-
ing. This is a key role shift — from one of reaction to one of prevention. The
focus shifts to be active in poka-yoke (mistake-proofing) as well. As a result,
the quality organization will move from inspection of product to a
process/product auditing focus.

Chapter 15
Lean across Industry
In This Chapter
 Seeing how Lean applies in any industry, not just manufacturing
 Recognizing that Lean works especially well in service businesses
 Identifying how powerful Lean is in government
L
ean is now practiced in every industry — from hard-core manufacturing
like automotive and aerospace, to construction, logistics, pharmaceuti-
cals, healthcare, banking, retail, high-tech, education, and even government,
especially government (more on this later in the chapter). But what industry
wouldn’t benefit from focusing on the customer and eliminating waste?
In this chapter, you discover more about Lean in manufacturing and other
industries, including, possibly, your own industry. But there are no revela-
tions here. Lean is Lean — meaning that Lean is so fundamental that it’s basi-
cally the same for services or in government as it is for manufacturing. The
same philosophy and principles apply; the same methods and techniques
apply; all the same tools apply. The language is sometimes adjusted to 
reflect the language of the industry, but at the core, Lean is the same in 
every industry.
Starting with What’s Common
Every business in every industry has issues — for-profit or nonprofit, public
or private. All ventures have customers, in some form. They all have
processes — whether formally documented or not. All employers have
employees who generally want to do a good job, use their knowledge and
skills, improve their quality of life, and feel good about what they do. All ven-
tures have a place where they conduct their business — an office, a factory, a
car, a computer, or even a table at Starbucks.

The commonalities are important, because they help you to translate Lean
from its manufacturing roots to “Wow! This all applies to me!” Follow this
starter framework to translate and begin your path to Lean implementation,
regardless of your industry:
 Understand the current issues. What are the mistakes? What’s going
wrong? What are the challenges? What are the priorities?
 Understand your customers. What do they want and need? What’s their
rate of demand? What constitutes their satisfaction?
 Map your value streams. Even if you’re a custom provider, you have cer-
tain activities that are routine. What are they?
 Calculate takt time. This may seem foreign, but if you have a customer,
that customer demands what you provide at some interval of time.
That’s your takt time and you need to know what it is.
 Be clear about your goals and objectives. Be specific about what you’re
trying to accomplish.
 Identify wastes — and reduce them.
 Implement Kaizen.
 5S your work environment. Have the intention of permanently eliminat-
ing waste.
 Evaluate the Lean toolbox. Use a broad interpretation. Pick the right
tool for what you’re trying to improve.
Think of the Lean toolbox as a golf bag with a full complement of clubs. If
you’re a beginning golfer, you may only use a few clubs out of your bag. As
your game improves and the courses you play become more difficult, you’ll
develop the ability to pull those more refined and specialized clubs out of
your bag. The starting framework for Lean is like your driver, 5-iron, and
putter — good clubs for starters.
Lean Manufacturing
Manufacturing is Lean’s heritage, its bread and butter. TPS is the automotive
manufacturing incubator where all the principles and practices of Lean were
hatched and have matured over the past 50 years. If you’re in manufacturing,
it doesn’t matter what your product is, how many you make, or how sophisti-
cated your processes are (high tech, low tech, or even no tech): Lean is a
highly effective manufacturing operations strategy.
Everything we cover in this book directly applies to the manufacturing envi-
ronment. The following sections highlight some key aspects of how Lean
applies specifically within manufacturing.
296
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

From batch to flow
The traditional methods of production work with batches, usually large in size,
and usually organized by functional operations. This method of production is
wrought with the seven wastes. Lean is not traditional. Lean is based on flow —
single-piece flow, ideally. To achieve single-piece flow, you must organize how
you do business differently, and you must remove all obstacles to flow.
Creating work modules
In Lean, you organize manufacturing by product groups or families. The rec-
ommended layout is a work module that flows counterclockwise. Inside work
modules are all the pieces of equipment and fixtures required to manufacture
a part or family of parts. The equipment is as small and as flexible as possible.
In the best module designs, all material replenishment and equipment repairs
can occur without support personnel entering the main production area —
usually from the backside of the equipment. This approach improves safety
and productivity, because no one but the trained production team is in the
direct production area. The operating pace is based on takt time.
Quality at the source
Instead of having large inspection stations at the end of the process, quality
is everyone’s job. Within each operation, you find standardized work, includ-
ing steps to verify your own work and the work of the previous operation.
Error-proofing “gadgets” are installed on equipment to prevent operations
from being performed incorrectly and poor quality from being passed to the
next station.
An error-proofing gadget, or poka-yoke, can come in many forms. It can be a
physical guide that helps material positioning. It can be software code that
monitors key characteristics and stops the equipment if they’re out of spec.
Or it can be a high-tech solution like infrared cameras, or whatever you can
dream up! If it prevents errors in any form, it’s poka-yoke.
Working in teams
Lean operators work as a team, based on standardized work methods. The
team is responsible for customer satisfaction and quality. They’re responsi-
ble for production and routine maintenance of their equipment and tools.
The team runs the show!
Changing from batch to flow affects not only the physical layout of a facility,
but also the organizational support structure. Lean organizations tend to use
fewer layers of management, fewer supervisors, and fewer support people.
With the hands-on team responsible for some of the tasks traditionally asso-
ciated with first-line supervision or maintenance, the roles of the individuals
297
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

in those areas change. Supervisors act as coaches, mentors, and roadblock
removers. Maintenance workers focus on preventive maintenance, equip-
ment improvements to support Kaizen, and error-proofing mechanisms.
Safety: “The sixth S”
The core Lean philosophy of “respect for people” has a special meaning in
the manufacturing world with regard to worker safety. Lean and safety go
hand in hand. Many manufacturing processes involve the use of dangerous
equipment and machinery or otherwise expose workers to hazardous materi-
als and conditions. Obviously, a safe worker is ultimately a more productive
worker. But it’s more than that: Lean workers contribute to improvements in
worker safety, within the context of waste reduction and customer value. The
net result: quality improvements, productivity gains, better safety awareness,
and a safer workplace.
Any injury or loss of productive effort is waste. When an injury occurs, pro-
duction halts. Time is lost on administrative tasks, such as locating replace-
ment workers, paperwork, and insurance. Other workers are distracted and
perform less efficiently.
Everyone is responsible for taking the initiative and becoming part of the
process. Managers and workers alike must be familiar with Lean philosophies
and articulate the value of safety interventions in terms of productivity.
Better safety means less waste.
Incorporate ergonomic analyses into your operational processes to reduce
muri. Conduct cause-and-effect analyses on the sources of loss to see where
accidents are happening. Then analyze the production process from an
ergonomics perspective and find the root causes of injuries. Finally, apply
ergonomic design principles to reduce or eliminate the sources of injury.
An outdoor power equipment manufacturer discovered through ergonomic
analyses that excessive reaching by production workers on an assembly line
was causing shoulder injuries. One line alone suffered over $300,000 in wages
and insurance payments from injuries. They conducted a Kaizen event and
implemented simple adjustments, eliminating the injuries.
Reducing inventory
Flow manufacturing causes you to change how you treat inventory. Inventory
is waste. It ties up cash and it’s at risk for obsolescence. Every time inventory
is touched, it can be damaged or destroyed. Inventory stops the flow of 
production.
298
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

For instance, when you transition from traditional department-oriented man-
ufacturing to cells, you no longer need the work in process (WIP) inventory
that waited until it could be transported to the next transformational step.
The machines are next to each other, not far away. Pull systems also lower
the levels of inventories required in a process. “Point of use” becomes the
design philosophy for in-process material storage. What is the absolute mini-
mum amount — based on takt usage — that can be stored where you use it?
Sometimes process constraints prevent perfect cell designs and you need in-
process inventory stores (type-1 muda — see Chapter 3). In that case, you
install controlled inventory stores or supermarkets. The goal is always to
reduce inventory, but until you can figure out a different way to remove the
constraint, the solution is well-controlled, planned, standardized, minimized
in-process stores, located as close to the point of use as possible.
To handle inventory, you need material handling equipment. But instead of
fork trucks to move large gondolas weighing tons or conveyor systems con-
necting buildings housing different functional areas, go smaller: Consider
using bins, hand trucks, and push carts. Safety improves — no more speeding
lift trucks ready to run you over or take out a building column! Costs go 
down — no building repairs and fewer high-tech pieces of equipment to main-
tain. And quality improves — less risk of transit damage.
Kanban, just-in-time, and the pull system
The Lean system of consumption-driven replenishment has proven itself in
manufacturing, across tiers of supplier and distribution networks. It is fast
becoming a compelling alternative to traditional material requirements plan-
ning (MRP) for multiple reasons. Chief among them are
 Push-style systems rely on forecasts to determine what and how much
to replenish. Forecasts can be useful indicators of overall demand in
general, but they’re poor predictors of precisely which products will be
needed and when. Also, in multi-tiered supply chains, push-systems dis-
tance manufacturers farther and farther from their customers and, as a
result, forecasts are pushed farther from reality. In addition, information
is diluted by each layer in the system. As a result, excessive inventory
builds and costly last-minute change orders ripple through the supply
chain.
 Manufacturers often incur large inventory-carrying costs with push-
style systems. And yet they still run out of parts. Stock-outs wreak havoc
in production, delaying customer shipments, increasing premium freight
charges, and disrupting plant operations by forcing unnecessary and
expensive changeovers. In the MRP environment, you often have no
299
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

clear record of how many times stock-outs occur or which parts repeat-
edly stock-out. Stock-outs often lead to an over-buying of parts, creating
excess inventory, which can be carried for months after a stock-out.
Errors in MRP also cause people to work outside the system to expedite
materials and to conduct repeated physical inventories. It becomes a
vicious cycle.
Lean pull-type systems are not like MRP forecast-driven replenishment sys-
tems. A kanban system reorders parts and components based on actual con-
sumption at the point of use. Consider two Lean methods:
 The “two-bin” method: An operator has two bins of material: One is
being consumed and the other is full. When the first bin empties, the
operator keeps working, using the second bin. The empty bin is sent out
for replenishment. A full one returns before the operator runs out.
 The kanban-card method: A kanban card travels with the inventory,
containing information such as the description of the item or part
number, and its location. Each card triggers replenishment when the
inventory is consumed.
Pull-based manufacturing synchronizes production with consumption in real
time, increasing on-time delivery performance, and reducing stock-outs and
costly last-minute changes. As orders arrive, material is pulled from the end
of final assembly, which instantly sends an order to the final assembly pro-
duction module to produce more.
Volume and variety
Lean applies in manufacturing whether you make one a month, a hundred a
day, or thousands every hour. In all manufacturing cases, certain steps
repeat. A custom cabinet facility may look different from a commercial wood
bookcase manufacturer, but both use wood, cut to a specific dimension,
sand, and finish — and they both do it over and over again. The starting
place for implementation is the same: Map the flow, 5S, identify value, and
standardize work. Beyond the basics, the manufacturers may choose a differ-
ent tool to apply first, but it all applies.
High volume, low customization
The bookstores are full of tomes about the traditional application of high-
volume production of Lean. Implementing work modules, pull systems, or
error proofing is easier when you make the same thing every day the same
way. This is not to say that the organization doesn’t struggle with the change,
because it does. But Lean was developed and perfected in high-volume, stan-
dardized environments. Therefore, you can easily translate Lean from high-
volume gadgets to your high-volume widget.
300
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Low volume, high customization
In contrast to the high-volume production environments of Toyota, Motorola,
or Dell, thousands of companies specialize in low-volume custom activities.
Whether your company is a machine shop, sign maker, cabinet maker, or
salad maker, the concepts of Lean apply to your business. It’s not a question
of how few you make, or the differences from one item of design or produc-
tion to the next. The details may include different ingredients or different
dimensions, but you’re still performing similar processing steps each time.
Look for elements of commonality and repetition in what you do — there are
more than you may think. Standardize all that is common, and compartmen-
talize the unique. If you focus only on how different you are, and how new
everything is, you’ll make it difficult to see how standardized work can help
your situation. The more you can define standardized work, the more bene-
fits you can begin to accrue from Lean practices.
Lean Services
Nearly 80 percent of the U.S. economy is now based in services, rather than
product manufacturing. Lean provides some of the greatest opportunities
and most powerful results in service businesses. Although service organiza-
tions have different processes, key metrics, and root causes of problems and
challenges as compared to manufacturing businesses, Lean methods are just
as effective.
In the past three decades, due largely to initiatives like TQM, Lean, and Six
Sigma, productivity among U.S. manufacturing firms has nearly tripled.
However, U.S. service company productivity is up only about 40 percent 
(see Figure 15-1).
Problems with products and with product development are not the fault of
the products — the root cause is in one or more of the processes that
designed and developed them. Lean addresses these problems as a process
improvement system. What are service businesses? The service industries
are pure process businesses. Lean principles and techniques are, therefore,
directly applicable to service businesses. Lean practices improve service
business performance, by
 Reducing the time spent performing business activities
 Reducing the total cost of doing business by eliminating wasted time
and effort
 Increasing customer satisfaction by improving the timeliness and quality
of deliverables
 Improving employee morale and increasing enthusiasm by engaging staff
in the development and implementation of improvements
301
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

By applying concepts that until recently had been alien to most service 
businesses — attacking speed and quality, simplifying complexity, scaling dif-
ferentiation, and empowering employees — service organizations can share
in some of the productivity gains already enjoyed by the makers of autos,
planes, trains, appliances, and other products. Savings will vary significantly
by company and industry, but it is realistic to expect reductions of 25 percent
in costs and 50 percent or more in response times and in-process errors by
implementing Lean practices in service businesses. In addition, revenue gains
of 5 percent annually are not uncommon.
Commercial services versus 
internal services
Commercial services are those businesses that offer their services to other
businesses and the general public. The services they offer represent their
core competence and form the basis for their profit and loss (P&L). By con-
trast, internal service providers are company overhead departments and
functions that provide support to other profit-generating departments. 
(We address the internal group in Chapter 14.)

Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Examples of commercial service businesses include everything from airlines,
communications (voice, cellular, data) companies, cable and satellite TV
providers, computer services, and mail and shipping services, finance and
mortgage companies, education and training services, repair and mainte-
nance services, and much more. Some of these services are labor and 
equipment based, while others are transaction based. In addition, most gov-
ernment agencies are in the service business, but they’re a special case and
we address them later in this chapter, in the “Lean Government” section.
In all service businesses, Lean is an attitude and approach that anyone can
understand and everyone can apply. The Lean techniques don’t require
extensive employee training or complex technical support. In a service con-
text, going Lean means getting back to the reason why everyone got into the
business in the first place: to help people.
Embedding Lean practices within a service organization is not a quick fix or
rapid overhaul. It requires the same diligent and holistic approach to trans-
formation as in manufacturing or any other industry. Lean in services means:
 Improving service processes to focus on the customer and deliver more
customer value
 Decreasing waste in the service value stream
 Reducing batch processes and moving increasingly toward a flow of
activities to deliver the service
 Striving for the perfect service
Because service businesses are often even more labor intensive and depen-
dent than manufacturing businesses, the respect for people in the service
value chain is of utmost importance.
A service is a product, too!
Services are like products in many ways. They begin with a customer need or
want, and they end when it’s delivered to them in a satisfactory manner — at
the right time, in the right way, and at the right price. The service is the
result of a process or series of processes acting in a coordinated fashion to
produce the desired results. There’s a value stream of activities and support
information. The service is a result of design, development, and delivery. And
the service is prone to defects and rework — just like products.
303
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

However, services are often not as tangible and indelible as products —
they’re more flexible. After all, retuning your engine is a lot easier than
remaking your car. Rebilling you for your mobile phone service is simple, but
rebuilding your mobile phone isn’t so easy. There’s a natural tendency to
confuse this flexibility with less focus and discipline. But if services are your
business, this tendency can be fatal. Indeed, you would be very much mis-
taken if you thought that service rework was any less problematic for a ser-
vice provider than product rework was for a manufacturer.
You must think of a service as a product, because
 Services have specifications — for quality, performance, timeliness, and
price.
 Services are architected and designed to meet customer requirements
and to fit the “manufacturability” of a production and delivery system.
 Services have a value chain comprised of components on both the
supply side and delivery end.
The seven forms of service waste
Service process waste is waste, just like product or material process waste is
waste. Service-business waste may look a little different, but it happens the
same way:
 Transportation: Service transportation waste is the unnecessary and
non-value-added movement of people, goods, and information in order
to fulfill the service obligation to a customer.
 Waiting: If people, systems, materials, or information are waiting, that’s
waste.
 Overproduction: Are your services producing sooner, faster, or in
greater quantities than the customer is demanding or requiring?
 Defects: Defective services are those that do not deliver the correct
requirements to the customer.
 Inventory: Are certain services half-finished?
 Movement: Are activities, paperwork, and other efforts unnecessarily
juggled?
 Extra processing: How much extra effort do people go to in order to
deliver the service? Could any of these steps be eliminated?
304
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Improving services the Lean way
Services naturally can benefit from one of Lean’s fundamental tools: a pull
system. In most cases, the delivery of a service to a customer is based on the
action of the customer requesting the service, which stimulates the value
chain to assemble and deliver it. A key to a Lean service is the development
of common services — the building blocks that permit flexible assembly in
real time as the customer requests it. All other Lean fundamentals also apply.
5S in services
The 5S of the workplace applies to service businesses:
 Sort: Workplace organization is universal. Sorting office materials, main-
tenance materials, or other tools is fundamental to the delivery of qual-
ity and timely services.
These days, many service businesses are computer-based or computer-
facilitated. Sorting your computer environment — your e-mails, your
files — is a Lean activity. Keep your computer desktop and file system
Lean and clean.
 Straighten: The tools of services should be arranged in standard loca-
tions for consistent and easy access. This includes desk items, data-
bases, repositories, references, operating procedures, or process
definitions. Information, including file and system names, should be 
consistent.
 Scrub: Maintain service tools in a neat and clean condition. This
includes any work areas, whether in the office or in the field.
 Systematize: As always, don’t wait for it to build up. As part of your reg-
ular routine, go through your work environment and maintain it. Define a
certain time or regular event as the basis. This includes both private and
common areas.
 Standardize: Exercise discipline in maintaining your workplace, and
institute processes that ensure that this regular maintenance occurs, in
a standard manner to standardized levels. Don’t overdo it — just do it.
In the American “cowboy” culture, the 5S workplace could easily be consid-
ered too conformist, too conservative — even anally retentive. Subliminal
cultural messages bombard most westerners with themes of independence
and defiance to such schemes. “Being yourself” and “just letting it all hang
out” are not 5S behaviors. However, the 5S workplace doesn’t have to be at
odds with individual expression. Although conformity is a part of Lean, it’s
more a culture of personal consistency and personal discipline.
305
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

Speed and quality
As in all Lean businesses, the goal is to increase both speed and quality at all
times. The balance between them is just as important in a service business as
any other business. But too much or too little of either is detrimental.
The Lean service organization is always moving to deliver customer value
ever more quickly. By consistently increasing the speed of operations, ser-
vice businesses are more flexible and can respond with greater agility to
changing customer demands and market conditions. Faster services are
delivered by fewer hands, and by streamlining and eliminating unnecessary
steps. In processing more quickly, the organization reduces opportunity
costs. And, of course, the customers are more satisfied to receive services
faster.
By focusing equally on quality, service businesses can significantly reduce
the time spent on reworking deliverables. Establish specification limits and
collect metrics on quality, applying tools to reduce variance, prevent failures,
and attack root cause.
Both strategies lead to sharply lower cost structures. Just as important,
improved products cement customer loyalty, which increases revenue 
potential.
Checking variety and reducing complexity
In service businesses, variety increases complexity and should be vigilantly
examined and reduced whenever possible. Service complexity can develop
from providing a well-meaning effort, to offering highly-tailored, intimate cus-
tomer service. However, any increases in complexity directly increase the
risk of both slower and defective services, and indirectly increase support
and maintenance costs, in the form of overtaxed back-office processing pro-
cedures, too many customer-service systems, and too much staff training.
Analyze service processes for variety and complexity. Sort the routine, com-
modity services from the specialized services and treat them differently.
Standardize the routine services, and manage the lower-volume, higher-
complexity services as specialty items. Where necessary, assemble these 
services in a value chain.
Credit-card issuer Capital One is an example of a service organization that sep-
arates common services from unique services, and it gains value from each.
Through analysis, the company divides consumers into micro-segments. It
offers customized lending rates to a person’s credit history by leveraging a
single cost-effective platform. In this way, Capital One offers a wide array of
rates and lending limits — an alluring feature for customers, through a Lean
set of processing systems, back-office infrastructure, and call centers.
306
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

Frontline power
To enable services to deliver on the promise of both quality and speed, the
decision-making must shift closer to the customer. The segmentation and
production of highly structured service components enable frontline staff to
engage customers more independently — with less management oversight.
Empower frontline staff to operate, instead of having to seek approval for
decisions. This setup also frees staff from focusing solely on basic transac-
tions and allows them to give more personal attention to customers and have
a more direct impact on increasing revenue.
Nothing better exemplifies frontline empowerment than the Ritz-Carlton
Hotel Company chain, where every member of the staff has a discretionary
budget for settling disputes. Each staff member has the personal authority to
provide such perks as room upgrades, complimentary food, and other ameni-
ties on a case-by-case basis. When a guest has an issue, staff is both enabled
and required to break away from regular duties and immediately address the
customer concern.
Lean Transactions
Transactions are a specific form of service business, where the product is
purely data and information, and it’s processed according to specific proce-
dures. Transactions are often performed as an outsourced back-office inter-
nal service function — the supplier and customer are the same entity.
Examples include certain banking functions, accounting, payroll, and insur-
ance claims. Success in transaction processing businesses is based on speed
and accuracy. How can Lean help?
Once again, the fundamentals of Lean apply: focusing on the customer,
improving the value stream, focusing on flow, striving for perfection, and
maintaining a high respect for people.
Transaction businesses are typically professional office environments, with a
highly educated workforce, using computers and data processing capabilities
to perform the tasks. Lean transaction businesses do the following:
 Explicitly map the value stream to understand precisely what is
required to complete the process task for the customer. Use this map
as the basis for continually eliminating wasteful practices.
 Move beyond the misconception that “information transactions are
not like products.” Design, develop, source, assemble, and deliver 
transactions.
307
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

 Regularly employ Kaizen to examine and optimize your transaction
processing processes. Keep the changes small, local, continuous, and
practical. Ensure that management responds and implements changes
quickly, and rewards the employees quickly.
 Perform paperwork processing in an assembly line, with people in
sequence along tables. Visual signs hanging over the tables identify that
these are work areas for accounts receivable, travel, and so on, rather
than individuals working at desks. Team leaders set goals; the process is
designed to flow.
Cubicles are based on a philosophy of work that is command and control
rather than empowering. Cubicles deny collaboration, optimize around indi-
vidual processes rather than around customer-centered workflow, and seek
to bury problems rather than make them visible and fix them. Factories don’t
have walls — why should offices? Remove cubicle walls so that the staff han-
dling the transactions works side by side and can see each other. Flow the
process step by step down the line. To push the envelope, try arranging the
office layout in work modules (see Chapter 8).
Lean Government
Of all industrial sectors outside of manufacturing, Lean practices are taking
hold in government as strongly as any other. At first, this might seem a para-
dox. After all, most governmental entities seem to be the opposite of Lean!
But in this section, we give you a closer look.
308
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 
Leaning the military
Not traditionally known for doing more with less,
the U.S. military has found great success with
the application of Lean, particularly in the areas
of maintenance. Especially during wartime, oper-
ating resources are at a premium. The faster a
vehicle, aircraft, or system can be repaired to the
proper working level, the faster it can be out in
the field protecting and supporting the soldiers
who need it.
The customer of the units responsible for repair
is the soldier in the field. Their product is a top
performing, well-maintained vehicle. The risk of
not doing a timely quality job could be loss of life.
In one such facility, a horn sounds every 23 min-
utes (takt time) to signal the vehicle should move
to the next station. Lesser skilled workers sup-
port the more highly trained mechanics by bring-
ing tools and parts to them, so the mechanics
can stay with the vehicle. They have also started
to work with their suppliers. Implementing Lean
practices in this nontraditional environment has
yielded a tenfold increase in vehicle repair rate in
less than two years, while cutting the repair cost
per vehicle by half! These and other successes
have prompted the U.S. military to specify Lean
as a practice and roll out Lean initiatives in each
of the branches.

Like any institution, governmental agencies face constant budget restrictions.
At the same time, they’re being asked to fulfill greater needs on the part of
their constituents. Sounds a lot like doing more with less, doesn’t it?
The choices are limited. Doing less with less isn’t an option that sells well to
voters. And it’s not a matter of simply working harder. The challenges also
are not solved by any singular approach like defect reduction, constraint
management, or measurement and reporting, although those are all useful
tools that have a role. More important, any solutions must be a workable cul-
tural fit into the nature of the government environment.
And this is where Lean is the perfect fit. Governmental entities — like the
Japanese corporations that developed TPS and Lean practices — have the
long-term view. Unlike Western corporations that are driven by short-term
performance measures, governmental agencies are in it for the long haul.
They can afford to implement continuous, incremental change. They can
readily embrace the approach when the methods and techniques are proven.
Perhaps most important of all is Lean’s accessible nature, enabling anyone to
participate, embracing everyone equally, and empowering all participants
through Kaizen events, cross-training, improvement suggestions, and respect
for people. In the longer-view world of government, Lean is ideal.
In the public sector, Lean practices help organizations:
 Shorten cycle times to completing and delivering services
 Improve service quality
 Increase productivity
 Dramatically increase customer (constituency) satisfaction
 Reduce waste in all forms, including bureaucracy
The largest barrier to implementing Lean in government exists only in terms
of providing the appropriate skills, capabilities, and experiences to those
responsible for carrying out the processes.
Lean in Healthcare
The healthcare field is one of the most exciting frontiers of Lean. In an envi-
ronment where patient care needs are climbing, and the availability of skilled
resources and reimbursement for services are shrinking, Lean practices are
helping. Lean healthcare focuses on the needs of the patient (the customer)
and strives to improve turnaround time, contain costs, reduce space,
increase speed of delivery, and improve the quality of care.
309
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

Improving healthcare through Lean
Lean healthcare is not about cutting people or eliminating assets. Lean
healthcare is improving activities and processes within the system. This is
accomplished by identifying and removing wasteful activities and focusing on
patient value-based activities.
Health industries applying Lean principles across their organization are 
experiencing increases in benefits and performance, such as:
 Reduced incidents of mistakes
 Improved patient education
 Reduced wait times for patients
 Improved clinical outcomes
 Increased staff productivity
 Reduced clinic and management costs
 Improved employee satisfaction for nurses and staff
Defining waste in healthcare
Open any paper in just about any country and you’ll find an article about
healthcare. Public or private, they all have issues. If you’ve ever encountered
a healthcare establishment, you know some of these issues firsthand.
Here are some ways that the classic seven forms of waste translate into a
healthcare environment:
 Transportation: Samples and specimens needing analysis travel exces-
sively to reach the labs and within the labs. Patients are moved exces-
sively for testing and treatment.
 Waiting: Patients wait for diagnosis, treatment, discharge, beds, or test-
ing. Physicians wait for patient lab results. Teams wait for specialists.
 Overproduction: Excess testing is performed for the convenience (liabil-
ity protection?) of the healthcare organization, not based on customer
demand.
 Inventories: Inventories include medicines, testing mediums, patients
needing bed assignments, lab samples and specimens for analysis, lab
results awaiting distribution, and dictation ready for transcription.
 Movement: Staff spends time looking for patient’s charts, medicines,
missing meds, missing charts, variation in procedures, sharing of equip-
ment, and so on.
310
Part IV: The Lean Enterprise 

 Defects: Mistakes are widespread, including wrong patient, wrong proce-
dure or medicine, misdiagnosis, unsuccessful treatments, re-sticks,
redraws.
 Excess processing: Staff makes multiple bed moves, retest, complete
excessive paperwork.
Lean Everywhere
The future of Lean across all industries is limitless. The principles, methods,
tools, and techniques apply in any situation. Looking at a business, organiza-
tion, or industry through Lean eyes will open up new pathways for improve-
ment opportunities. In the following sections, we offer a couple more examples.
Nonprofit organizations
Nonprofit organizations are a growth area for Lean practice. They have busi-
ness processes just like any other business or industry. Nonprofits provide ser-
vices to the community. Whether the organization is packing boxes of food,
making lunches for homeless shelters, or delivering clothing bundles to new
mothers, they can use takt to balance the line, standardized work to quickly
train volunteers, and customer demand data to request the right supplies from
donors. Applying Lean principles to fundraising events and silent auctions can
generate more money for the cause by improving logistics, minimizing costs to
yield more funds, and obtaining more items targeted to their bidders’ tastes.
Retail
Retail is a strong emerging application area for Lean. The retail environment
is where the rubber meets the road between products and consumers. The
retail chains are the direct connection with the ultimate customer — the con-
sumer. Retailers know customer demand firsthand. They’re also the main
point of customer interface for issues with the product or service. Through
their ordering practices, sales campaigns, and customer service, they feed
the value stream.
Lean is powerful in the retail industry as a method of optimizing the supply
chain. Lean practices also improve customer service, by decreasing wait
times and ensuring that the right products are on the right shelves at the
right time. Some retailers are using point-of-sale data to stimulate supply and
delivery based on real-time customer purchases. Lean helps them with flow
to the store shelves and minimizing inventory levels.
311
Chapter 15: Lean across Industry

The next time you go to a retail store, look for evidence of Lean practices, and
you’ll be likely to find it. Figure 15-2 shows an example of a visual standardized
work instruction for something as simple as cleaning the restroom. See what
other Lean techniques you notice, from customer service to products on the
shelves.
Whether you’re watching a television show where they build a house in a
week, you’re in a retail store, or you’re eating in a restaurant where you order
before you’re seated, you’ll find evidence of Lean. After reading this book,
you’ll see opportunities for improvement all around you. The potential for
Lean is limitless.

Ten Best Practices of Lean
In This Chapter
 Satisfying customers and delivering value is at the heart of successful Lean practice
 Looking at Lean as a journey, not a destination
 Keeping things simple, people-focused, and visual
M
ost every best-practice list begins with something about leadership.
Leadership — in the form of unwavering guidance and support from
top management, as well as the everyday inner leadership of individuals — is
so fundamental to the success of any initiative that it precedes a place on a
best-practices list. Leadership is the “zeroth” law of success. Bring it on or
stay home — it’s that simple.
The previous chapters chronicle a collection of principles, methods, tools,
and techniques that comprise a Lean system. If you recognize the ten best
practices in this chapter, in addition to following what we outline throughout
this book, you’ll keep your bearings over the long haul of the Lean journey.
Feel the Force (of the Customer), Luke
The Lean sensei, Obi-Wan Kenobi, is calling out to you: Feel the force. Do you
hear him? Do you feel it? That force is the will of the customer — calling out
to you, pulling on you, stimulating you, aligning your action. Your mission is
to align all your brainpower, your energy, and your might to answer this call.
Successful Lean practice has the customer at its core and the center of 
your universe — the customer’s wants, needs, and idea of value. Feel the 
customer’s force like the force of gravity. It is constant, undeniable, and 
unrelenting, but it is also your grounding and your base.

Step by Step, Inch by Inch
Success is not a big bang. You can have big wins along the way, but no single
breakthrough event or project victory will sustain achievements over the
long term.
Lean is a journey, not a destination. You live Lean every day, through suc-
cesses and setbacks alike. Lean is the force of a million little things, all the
time. Lean is trying, doing, learning, and trying again — and again.
Lean is the tortoise and The Little Engine That Could. Lean is “small ball” —
scoring again and again by hitting singles, bunting, and stealing bases. Lean is
the Lexus tagline: The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection.
Follow the Value Stream
Value “flows” downstream, toward the customer. You can easily find yourself
in an eddy current or a side pool, swirling ’round and ’round, spending energy
but going nowhere. All the Lean techniques — for reducing waste, organizing
into cells and teams, performing standardized work, and applying quality and
control tools — are intended to align your efforts to the center of the value
stream.
Use the tools of communication, leadership, and visual management to help
people see alignment to customer value. Design your environments, your
tools, your practices, and your habits to keep the value stream flowing and to
recognize when it’s not. Support people and processes in centering them-
selves, using tools like tugboats to nudge them back into place.
Eat Your Vegetables
The wide array of Lean tools and techniques may seem like a smorgasbord,
enticing you to pick and choose whatever looks inviting and tastes yummy.
You could be tempted to select too many sweets, and not enough fruits and
vegetables; however Lean requires a balanced diet and complete nutrition.
You’re healthy only when you’re whole. Don’t neglect any of the parts.
You must not just follow lofty principles of Lean — you must also use the
tools. But you can’t just apply technical tools — you must apply the people
tools as well. Short-term projects are effective, but only within the context of
316
Part V: The Part of Tens 

the long-term view. Lean applies to the whole body of the organization — and
not just your organization, but all of the organizations in the value stream.
Turn Over a Rock
Manufacturing or line work is where companies like to direct the focus of
quality-control tools and rigorous analyses, because people can easily see the
results there. Confining an initiative like Lean to manufacturing or line work
may be tempting, but don’t do it!
Turn over any rock, in any part of the organization, and you’ll find opportu-
nity. Actually, most companies find greater waste when they start flipping
those rocks — in places that they’ve ignored or thought that Lean doesn’t
really apply. For example, Lean practices often provide the most significant
returns in areas like new product development and back-office functions.
Lean is everywhere — everywhere you turn. Neglect nothing.
People First!
Commerce, organization, enterprise, service — they’re all about people.
They’re led by people, they’re staffed by people, and they serve people.
People are constantly tempted by the leverage and economies offered by
technology and tools, but don’t forget what tools are for: Tools are to aid 
and assist people!
People come first. They always come first. No matter where you are on your
journey, you’ll only sustain Lean if your people are onboard and supportive.
Your people are motivated and rewarded by success, not their tools. Tools
don’t “win”; people do. People change their thinking and behaviors and use
tools accordingly. You need them both, but the people are what make or
break you.
Genchi Gambutsu
This poetic expression says it perfectly: Go and see. Or, more bluntly, get up
off your butt, get out there in the world, and see for yourself! E-mails, reports,
conference calls, hearsay, even video — they can’t tell the whole story. You
317
Chapter 16: Ten Best Practices of Lean

must see it with your own eyes. And not just your eyes — you must experi-
ence it with all your senses.
The world is subtle and full of nuance. Nothing’s black and white. And these
subtleties are often not just important, but the critical difference. Reports
and data only tell one part of the overall picture. There’s nothing like being
there to get the whole picture.
Some people may label these efforts as boondoggles — or worse, outright
muda. But you’re adding value when your firsthand observations and experi-
ence enable faster and more effective processes and procedures.
The Art of Simplicity
It’s a famous cliché: “Keep it simple, stupid” — but this is one of the best
practices of Lean. Indeed, keep it simple. When in doubt, simplify and elimi-
nate. When confronted with a decision, ask yourself “Which option is sim-
pler?” And unless you’re compelled to do otherwise, choose the simplest
option.
Lean guides you to take on challenges in small bites. To make continuous
improvement continuous, you don’t implement complex and convoluted
solutions. Increased complexity increases the risk of failure and lowers relia-
bility. Kaizen is surely simpler.
At a Glance
Lean environments are high-sensory environments. Design your environment
to convey critical information with a glimpse of an eye or a turn of an ear. Use
simple techniques like andon boards (see Chapter 9) to show where trouble is
brewing or has boiled over; have horns honk to signal takt time (see Chapter
4), or tool boards to illustrate when something is out of place or missing. Use
customer information centers, cross-training boards, and performance trend
charts for key metrics to present information about the business in a way
that you can respond to nonstandard situations.
A Lean environment should enable everyone — even an outsider — to under-
stand the status and state of affairs. Are you running to standard? Is there an
issue? How are you doing? All at-a-glance.
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Standardize Something — 
Standardize Everything!
Standardize your work: Define a segment of work, standardize it, work to that
standard, and measure its effectiveness. Say you’ve just completed a PDCA
cycle (see Chapter 6). Find areas of improvement, eliminate waste, and rede-
fine the standard. Now work to that new standard, and measure its effective-
ness. And on and on and on — across the entire organization. That’s Kaizen.
Standardized work provides the basis upon which Lean operations are built.
After standardized work is in place, you can depend on it, build on it, train to
it, delegate it, or even outsource it. You don’t have to reinvent it each time
you do it, or suffer performance variances because it’s, well, nonstandard.
Standardized work becomes a building block that enables to you move for-
ward and accomplish more.
You’ll find that certain practices are custom by definition — they don’t seem
to fit a standard. Standardize the parts that can be standardized. Allow the
custom parts to be defined as “custom” until you can see a way to standard-
ize them. In an ideal Lean world, everything you do follows a standardized
work scheme.

ecause Lean is different from traditional western-style thinking, organi-
zation, and management, keeping your bearings can be difficult. The
rewards don’t come without risk. Many people — some well-meaning, and
some not so well-meaning — can quietly conspire, either accidentally or pur-
posefully, to knock you off course and kill the initiative. Many large and well-
meaning companies have fallen prey to one or more of these traps, and
suffered mightily for it.
In this chapter, we fill you in on the most common causes of problems with
Lean initiatives, and tell you how to avoid them. These issues are real — and
they can be real trouble if you’re not careful. Pay attention to these pitfalls,
and stay alert for signs of disaffection or discontent. Doing so can save your
initiative and, ultimately, your organization.
Yawn
Complacency is the number one killer of Lean initiatives. If things are going
even moderately well, there’s just not a lot of organizational willingness to
change course, take on a new initiative, or expand an existing one. Proactively
stimulating change is very difficult. If there is no crisis demanding action,
people often can’t see the reasons. Tellingly, over two-thirds of companies
now practicing Lean are doing so because they felt compelled to act.
Even if you’ve started a Lean initiative in the face of trouble, it still will be 
difficult for the areas not directly affected by the problems to see why they
should adopt Lean practices. After all, if it’s somebody else’s problem, why
should they change?

In addition, because Lean is a continuous, incremental-change process, it
may be difficult for certain people or business areas to perceive the signifi-
cance of small changes occurring from the adoption of Lean practices in
other organizations or work areas. And if they can’t see it, and if it doesn’t
appear significant enough, they’re going to wonder why they should do it.
Resistance to change is natural to any change initiative, and it’s no different
in Lean. But Lean almost intensifies this resistance through its incremental,
baby-steps approach.
How do you get people to adopt Lean practices if they can’t readily see the
results? You fight complacency with several weapons:
 Communications: Have a strong communicator who’s unrelenting and
convincing in the purpose and goals of the Lean initiative, as well as its
proven, time-tested methods and tools.
 Information updates: Be sure to communicate the results and benefits
from Lean improvement activities as they occur — both in your com-
pany and elsewhere.
 Competition: People need to know what your competitors are doing,
what industry practices are, and what it takes to keep pace.
 Lean measurements: Create performance measures that reinforce Lean
behaviors.
 Punitive measures: Sometimes, you have to use the stick. In every
group, there are some who will not board the train.
Same-Old Same-Old Senior Management
If the senior managers aren’t fully embracing Lean, you have a very, very diffi-
cult road ahead. Many in the industry would tell you that your chances of a
successful Lean initiative are nil without senior management’s full support.
Why? Because the initiative is so all-encompassing and life-changing, that
without management support, it simply won’t happen.
Senior managers can’t go on living the old ways and expect a new initiative to
take hold. Not only must they be supportive, but they have specific roles to
play and regular actions to take. The management functions can’t be dele-
gated or handed off; they must be practiced and performed by the managers
themselves. Senior managers have to participate in Kaizen events; they must
take the gemba walks. No free tickets.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Furthermore, senior managers must regularly communicate the nature of the
initiative and reinforce its purpose. The senior managers must be visible and
available to talk to people at all levels inside and outside the organization.
The revolving door of senior managers, particularly through merger and
acquisition, has also been the source of Lean initiative failures. Replacing
enlightened Lean leaders with traditionally minded ones has caused the
demise of some very noteworthy companies in record time. You cannot have
a successful Lean journey unless all the leaders understand and are commit-
ted to its success.
Quick Fix!
Do not sell yourself or your organization on Lean as a quick fix. You can real-
ize short-term benefits and gain momentum through a special Lean project or
a Kaizen blitz event. However, the true success of Lean does not come through
short-term special events. The true power of Lean is through continuous,
incremental improvements over the long term.
If your organization is so severely damaged that you must take immediate
action and slamma-jamma a miracle overhaul in order to dramatically
improve results in the upcoming quarter, Lean is not the right method. If
that’s your situation, best of luck to you, but shop elsewhere.
Use Lean as a long-term solution. Use Lean to more patiently, orderly, and
consistently change people’s thinking and behaviors, change the culture, and
improve continuously and incrementally forever. You don’t create that kind of
change overnight.
Cherry-Picking
One of the most common faux pas of Lean implementations is the piecemeal
application of individual tools. Companies who believe that a couple of tools
will solve their world-hunger problems are grossly mistaken.
The piecemeal efforts always backfire. Because Lean is a complete system,
picking up a few tools and hacking away is a recipe for disaster. Without the
holistic understanding, adoption, and support of the principles and methods
of Lean, the tools are out of context. Of course, you never implement all the
elements of Lean at the same time, but not losing sight of the interrelation-
ships of the elements in the overall system is critical.
323
Chapter 17: Ten Pitfalls to Avoid

The most flagrant abuses have lacked the respect for people, attempting to
implement Lean tools within traditional management, accounting, and opera-
tions frameworks. It just doesn’t work.
With Lean, do it, or don’t do it. But don’t think you can do it halfway.
Beans Are Beans
Do not expect traditional accounting methods and systems to reflect the
improvements accomplished through Lean practices. Eventually, results will
hit the bottom line, but even these results don’t properly account for the
whole picture. Of all the nemeses to befall Lean initiatives, this is perhaps the
most insidious: believing that the old ways of accounting for the business are
the only ways to account for it.
A Lean implementation will redefine boundaries, breaking down traditional
functional walls and changing the nature of how cost and value are defined in
the organization. They will further change how people’s contributions are
measured, incentivized, and rewarded. Floor space will be reduced and cycle
time will improve. You cannot make all those changes operationally and con-
tinue to perform accounting the old way — all the numbers don’t overtly
show up with traditional cost accounting.
The accounting managers may tell you how difficult it is for them to change,
or even wave the risk flags (think Sarbanes-Oxley). Help them understand
how they can be part of the solution, instead of the problem. Show them the
results and challenge them how best to account for the improvements you
make. Bring them onboard, and they can make a key difference!
Playing the Shell Game
Let’s say that a nugget of waste is sitting there on the table, under the shell of
your organization. Your operations manager — fully trained in Lean practices —
deftly pulls out two additional shells: one for a supplier, and one for a distrib-
utor. He starts moving shells around and, suddenly — presto! — the nugget of
muda is no longer under your shell. It’s now under one of the others. He’s
eliminated waste from your organization, and aren’t you the better for it?
You’ve just committed a Lean infraction: You’ve moved the muda. Moving the
muda doesn’t count in Lean, because improving yourself at the expense of
someone else isn’t really improvement. You’re all interconnected through the
value stream. Ultimately, the aim of Lean is to improve the entire stream. You
have to eliminate the waste — period.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

The Grease Monkeys
Many people around you will happily pick up a tool and use it — Lean tools
included. A new technique, a new form of analysis, a new software program —
they’re all good. People love tools. They seem like toys. When you get a new
toy, you get to play with something different that you haven’t had before. You
look for opportunities to show off your new toy, er, tool. But you need to
remember to pick the right tool for the job.
A carpenter cannot build a bookcase with just a hammer, and you cannot
build a Lean organization with just a kanban card. One tool does not a trans-
formation make. You need to figure out how to use the full compliment of
tools in your toolbox and pick the right tool for the job.
Busy Bees
Activity ≠Progress. Everyone knows that people can be busy — very busy —
without being at all productive. Bureaucracies are replete with useless activ-
ity, wasting people, time, and effort without producing anything of value. Make
sure that the Lean improvement activities you undertake really add value.
When you have Kaizen events, make sure that they’re well organized, with
defined objective and teams creating lasting results. Be certain that managers
are participating in them, to ensure the results are understood and sup-
ported by the people with authority and accountability. For example, if the
objective is to free up floor space, then make sure it is freed up in usable, col-
lective areas, not isolated pockets that don’t create value for anything.
Busy bees should be busy making honey. Make sure your bees are making
honey, too.
Stuck in the Middle Again
Traditional middle managers really are in the middle: They get it from both
ends. The senior managers are forever beating on them to increase produc-
tivity and performance, and to “lower overhead” (that is, reduce headcount).
Meanwhile, their subordinates are often like a herd of cats, who won’t always
do what they’re asked to do and, furthermore, don’t necessarily like being
“railroaded” into yet another new initiative that they didn’t ask for. They
think of their immediate managers more as roadblocks than enablers.
325
Chapter 17: Ten Pitfalls to Avoid

Welcome to classic middle management — a lot of pressure, often in a thank-
less position, struggling to satisfy two disparate constituencies, and trying to
make do with inadequate tools and insufficient support.
The roles of middle managers and supervisors are very different in Lean 
from traditional hierarchical, order-giving organizations and systems. In Lean
enterprises, the supervisors become coaches and mentors. They relinquish
considerable authority and decision-making to the employee teams, who 
find their own solutions to problems and challenges. The middle managers
become listeners and enablers. Their job is to break down walls that inhibit
team success.
These roles of middle management and supervisors are different from tradi-
tional western-style systems. Managers and supervisors must be properly
trained, equipped, and supported in order to perform within a Lean system.
It’s not an easy transition for people. Some of them just don’t make it.
Lean Six Sigma
The final pitfall to avoid is the distraction by the latest continuous-improvement
fad. The consulting industry will continue to re-brand, re-badge, or repackage
tools and techniques into the latest and greatest whiz-bang solution. Like the
millions of fad diet and exercise programs, these new methods can give false
hope and distract you from the Lean lifestyle changes proven to create
healthy organizations over the long term.
After you’ve chosen your Lean path, take the time to understand how best 
to include new or existing methodologies to complement your Lean journey.
Take Six Sigma for example: The statistical tools of Six Sigma can be very
useful in the reduction of variation (mura) and eliminate particularly nagging
defects. However, the short-term, big-project mentality and highly structured
infrastructure of Six Sigma is incongruent with a true Lean organization.
As a fundamental method, Lean cannot be easily subjugated into other
methodologies or frameworks. Lean tools can be borrowed by another frame-
work, but that’s all it is or will be: borrowed. Lean has a successful track
record as a whole system in organizations that don’t get sidetracked by
bright, shiny objects.

Consultants, Facilitators, and Trainers
If you’re embarking on a Lean initiative, or you have an initiative underway,
you may need assistance — in the form of expert advice, training, and experi-
enced facilitation of Kaizen, Kaikaku, or other events. Worry not! The Lean
community has experts available to help you in all of these areas.
You can find and apply expertise in several forms:
 Methods and tools: Most training and consulting organizations special-
ize in the methods and tools of Lean — everything from Value Stream
Mapping and Kano modeling to performing statistical analysis and con-
ducting Kaizen events.
 Change management: Leading an organization through the change
process to understand and practice the philosophy of Kaizen is very dif-
ferent from learning and applying the tools. Look for a different kind of
expertise to help you through the change process.
 Rent-A-Sensei: Sometimes, you just need an expert who can facilitate
your team through a project or phase of an initiative. Certain consultan-
cies have such experts, in the form of experienced leaders, or senseis,
who can assist you.
To find people to help you, just enter “Lean consultants” into your favorite
search engine.
Interview consulting organizations carefully, to ensure that they have applied
experience in the areas of your greatest needs and interests.
In addition to private consultancies, an increasing number of academic insti-
tutions are teaching and training Lean practices. An organization known as
the Lean Education Academic Network (LEAN) is group of university educa-
tors who are pursuing Lean education in U.S. higher academia, as well as con-
tinuous improvement of Lean education in the classroom through sharing of
knowledge and teaching materials, collaboration, and networking among col-
leagues. You can find out more at www.teachinglean.org.
Lean Periodicals
Subscribing to Lean periodicals will bring you regular joy and knowledge, 
via your mailbox! The following established periodicals are manufacturing-
oriented:

Software Providers
Technology vendors are building increasing knowledge in the methods and
tools of Lean. In addition to their products — which have considerable online
help and tutorials — they provide education and support services.
Practitioners
Chances are, you know someone who has been involved in Lean, perhaps
even a specialist of some type. If you’re working in a Lean company, you’re
surrounded by experienced professionals. They have the expertise and refer-
ence material available for you.
Even if you don’t know of anyone personally, you may be surprised by just
how few degrees of separation lie between your interest and a Lean expert.
Ask your friends and associates, ask the people at your church or synagogue,
or the other parents at the ballgame. Try shouting “Lean” in a crowded the-
ater! You know people who know Lean — you just have to ask around.

Glossary
5S: The principle of waste elimination through workplace organization.
Derived from the Japanese words seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and shitsuke,
which have been translated into English as sort, straighten, scrub, systematize,
and standardize.
5 Whys: A method of root-cause analysis that entails the progressive asking
of “Why?” at least five times or until the root cause is established.
5 Ws and 1 H: A tool of inquiry in which you ask, “Who?”, “What?”, “When?”,
“Where?”, “Why?”, and “How?”
Affinity Diagram: An organization of individual pieces of information into
groups or broader categories.
andon: A signal to alert people of problems at a specific place in a process; a
form of visual management.
A3: A one-page reporting format, named for the international paper size. It
contains, on one page, critical information about an issue, such as descrip-
tion, cost, timing, data, planned solution, and planned resolution.
autonomation: Automation with a human touch. Autonomation is related to
jidoka. Intelligence is added to equipment to prevent the production of defec-
tive products, eliminate overproduction, and automatically stop the process
when abnormalities are detected. This type of automation frees people to
perform more valuable activities. See also jidoka.
backflow: The return of a “product” to an earlier step, usually to the source
of the issue, for reprocessing or repair.
Balanced Scorecard: A framework for identifying business metrics beyond
the basic financial measures normally used. The framework includes cus-
tomer, internal, people, and financial measures, and ties together strategic
goals with operational metrics.
Bar Chart: A graphical method of depicting data, grouped by category. The
values are depicted in vertical or horizontal bars.
batch and queue: A method of processing where material is accumulated
into a lot (batch) and pushed through the process independent of demand 
or requirements. This is also known as mass production or traditional 
manufacturing.

bottleneck: A process that constricts or limits the flow of the overall process.
buffer stock: An amount of inventory accumulated between processes to pro-
tect a process from starving due to uneven capacities. Buffers are a form of
inventory, one of the seven forms of waste. See also inventory; seven forms of
waste.
bull-whip effect: The progressive magnification of demand upstream from
the customer in the value stream.
Cause-and-Effect Diagram: A pictorial diagram that shows the variable causes
that can affect a given process or output. Also known as a C&E Diagram.
cell: See work module.
Check Sheet: Any standard way you can gather data and view an activity as it
happens, normally on a piece of paper or chart on which someone indicates
an activity and checks it as it occurs.
changeover: Elapsed time between one activity or product and a new one. In
a production environment, changeover is the time between the production of
the last part of one type to the production of the first good part of the next
type. Another example is a racing pit crew: The time between the moment the
car rolls into the pit for tires and fuel to its entrance back into the racecourse
is changeover.
consumer: The person or entity who obtains goods and services for his or its
own use. In Starbucks, the person drinking the Venti half-caf, nonfat White
Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino with extra whipped cream is the consumer.
See also customer.
continuous flow: The ideal state where products move through a manufac-
turing process — or people move through a service process — one at a time,
without stopping or waiting.
Control Chart: The most powerful tool of statistical process control, the con-
trol chart is a time-series run chart, with statistically determined upper and
lower control limits and a centerline.
Current-State Map: A Value Stream Map that depicts things as they currently
exist within the value stream. See also Value Stream Map.
customer: The person or entity who is the recipient of what you produce,
either within your organization or outside your organization. For Starbucks
suppliers, the customer is the retail store that receives the espresso beans,
milk, syrup, and blender, in order to make that Venti half-caf, nonfat White
Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino for the consumer. See also consumer.

cycle time: The total amount of elapsed time from the time a task, process, or
service is started until it is completed.
defects: The output of a process that fails to meet the required specification
or performance standard. One of the seven forms of waste. See also seven
forms of waste.
demand amplification: See bull-whip effect.
Deming Cycle: See Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) or Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
downtime: The stoppage of a process due to planned or unplanned causes,
such as equipment maintenance or failure, material or quality issues, training
or staffing constraints, and so on.
effectiveness: The utilization of the minimum number of resources, with the
least amount of waste, to create a defined value for the customer.
efficiency: The optimization of a process that results in minimum resource
use. Efficiency is not necessarily tied to customer value. A process can be
efficient but not effective.
error-proofing: See poka-yoke.
excess processing: work being performed beyond what is required to satisfy
the customer standards or requirements. See seven forms of waste.
Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA): The method used to identify, assess,
and mitigate risks associated with potential failure modes in a product, process,
or system.
FIFO: See first in first out (FIFO).
finished goods: An inventory of products in a completed state awaiting ship-
ment or sale.
first in first out (FIFO): A process to manage orders or inventory so that the
oldest is processed first. The goal of FIFO is to prevent earlier orders from
being delayed unfairly in favor of new orders.
Fishbone Diagram: See Cause-and-Effect Diagram.
flow: The movement of a product or service along the value stream, from its
inception to the customer.

inventory: The raw materials, purchased parts, work-in-process components,
and finished goods that are not yet sold to a customer. Inventory is one of the
seven forms of waste, when the amounts exceed the minimum level to main-
tain the pull system. See also seven forms of waste.
inventory turns: Financial measure of the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in a
given period (annually) divided by the Average Inventory for the same period.
Ishikawa Diagram: See Cause-and-Effect Diagram.
jidoka: Transference of human intelligence to machines via automation. The
automation enables the equipment to detect defects and stop until someone
comes to fix the problem. This supports quality at the source and the preven-
tion of defects from progressing along the value stream. Additionally, the
person in charge of the step in the value stream is responsible to resolve the
issue or stop the flow to get outside assistance.
just-in-time: Providing what is needed, when it is needed, in the quantity
needed, and the quality level needed.

tion of a product or service; its rate of production should be equal to or close
to takt time. See also takt time.
Pareto Chart: A bar chart where the categories are presented in descending
order of frequency. The Pareto principle states that 80 percent of the data will
fall in 20 percent of the categories.

PDSA: See Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) or Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA).
pitch: The amount of time required to make one container of product. The
formula is Pitch = Takt Time × Container Quantity.
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) or Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA): A short-cycle itera-
tive improvement scheme at the core of the Kaizen process. This four-step
process includes (1) defining the objectives, issues, and potential solution;
(2) carrying out the plan in a trial mode; (3) verifying and studying trial
results; (4) fully implementing and standardizing the solution. It is also 
called the Shewhart cycle or Deming cycle.
