Dedication

family. Nah, maybe not so much! Much love, Damon.
Andy Cowitt: For Michael, as always.

with Mary Kelly. In loving memory of Jennifer’s father, Joseph Kelly, the best
teacher of all. Also to our perfect children, Kelly, Alex, Grant, Elizabeth, and
Edward.

Authors’ Acknowledgments
Damon Dean: Every book requires the hard work of a large number of folks,
the vast majority of which we never see. Revisions are even more challenging
because as an author, you’re constantly trying to remember what it was you
wrote back in the first version of a product and whether it’s still relevant.
There is, however, a team of folks that are there to keep you on the ball, and
for that I’m always grateful. Steve Hayes, our acquisition editor, continues to
ask me and Andy to do these books, so a big thank you there! On this revi-
sion, Susan Christophersen was a tremendous shepherd of the book and my
general lazy tendencies. Without her cheerful e-mails, we’d be late, or later, if
you prefer! And a fine thank you to Ron Rockwell for all his vigilance in keep-
ing us accurate. And to all the other production folks, thank you for making
us all look good.
Andy Cowitt: Thanks to the Cowitts, Wertzes, and Saraccos, with special
nods to Michael and to Damon. Also, props to Mike and all my other col-
leagues past and present at the California HealthCare Foundation.
Jennifer and Christopher Smith: Thanks to all our friends and colleagues at
Adobe Systems for their support, encouragement, and faith in all our work,
especially surrounding the Creative Suite 3 launch: Jane, Joe, Ron, Dave,
Donna, Ali, Noha, Lynn, Adam, Jeffrey, Lori, Richard, and the many product
team members who responded to our questions throughout the writing
process.
A special thank you also to Fred Gerantabee, the master of all things Flash.
Thanks for your significant contributions to this book.
Thank you also to Yvette Grimes for assistance in updating information.
To the highly professional instructional staff at Aquent Graphics Institute
(AGI), we appreciate your great insight into the best ways to help others
learn creative software applications.
Thanks to all at Wiley Publishing. This book involves a lot of detail and infor-
mation, and it was up to Melody Lane, acquisitions editor for our three mini-
books in this book, and her “tough love” to make sure that it got to the state
it is now. Thanks to Kelly Ewing and technical editor Cathy Auclair for the
great insight.
Grant, Elizabeth, and Edward — thanks for putting up with our long hours in
front of the keyboard night after night.
Thanks to all of Kelly’s friends for permission to use their photos.

Introduction
W
hen creative juggernaut Adobe announced that it had acquired
Macromedia in 2006, long-time Macromedia users wondered what it
would mean for their preferred suite of Web development tools, Studio.
Would Photoshop’s superior power and depth spell the end of Fireworks,
despite the fact that Fireworks has more user-friendly image-optimizing
and -exporting capabilities? Would FreeHand survive? Would ColdFusion get
lost in the shuffle? For those of us who always used Photoshop and Acrobat as
well as the applications in the Studio suite, the question was, How long do we
have to wait for better integration of Adobe’s software with Dreamweaver,
Flash, and Fireworks? With Adobe Creative Suite 3 Web Premium, we have
our answers, and the future looks bright for Web developers!
About This Book
Adobe Creative Suite 3 Web Premium All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies
(we know, it’s a mouthful) is designed to be a hands-on, easy-to-understand
guide to the main features in all the CS3 Web development products. The no-
nonsense approach will help you begin to build Web sites by covering the
basics in a clear and concise fashion. The way we see it, you’ve got things to
do, and reading a book, even a clever one, takes up valuable time. The faster
we can help you do something or answer a question, the better.
How to Use This Book
You can use this book in a few different ways:
✦As a reference: If you already have a Web site and use Creative Suite 3,
this book can be a handy refresher for that thing you couldn’t quite
remember how to do. Whether it’s finding out how to export graphics to
Flash from Illustrator, or how to add a behavior to a button graphic in
Fireworks, you can use this book to fill in those gaps that we all have . . .
especially as we get older.
✦To guide you through building a Web site: Several authors contributed
to the creation of this book. All of us have a wealth of experience in the
process of building Web sites. In this book, we’ve tried to impart as
much of our collective knowledge about the processes and pitfalls of
building Web sites using these tools as we can.

Three Presumptuous Assumptions
2
✦To find out more about the tools: In this All-in-One Desk Reference, each
minibook has a limited number of pages to cover a product or topic,
which means that we get right to the point and make the topics covered
easy to understand. We believe that this approach makes figuring out
these products easier.
Three Presumptuous Assumptions
Before you dive into the book, we thought we should give you some advance
warning of our expectations. We know, you’re the audience, so we shouldn’t
assume anything! But, just so you know where we’re coming from, here are
our three basic assumptions about you, the reader:
✦You’re in a hurry. Frankly, if you wanted a more in-depth book, you’d
have picked up a regular For Dummies book on one or all of these prod-
ucts. Hence the no-nonsense, get-it-done, and keep-on-moving approach
that you find inside this book.
✦You know something about Web development. This isn’t a book in which
we spend a lot of time talking about HTML and how it works. So you
won’t find a chapter anywhere in this book titled, “What the Internet Is
and How It Works.”
✦You’ll experiment on your own. The approach here is to give you quick,
useful examples of how things work across all these products. In some
cases, the examples can be fairly sophisticated. In most cases, though,
the book presents the basics. Our hope is that you’ll take those basic
examples and build your own, more complex ones on top of that,
according to the complexity of your site.
Macintosh versus Windows
Adobe Creative Suite 3 is both a Windows and a Macintosh product. In this
book, you see us use the Windows commands, and most of the figures show
Windows XP.
In general, you can convert between Windows (PC) and Macintosh key com-
mands by using the following equivalencies:
✦The Ctrl key on a PC is equivalent to the Command (Ô) key on a Mac.
✦The Alt key on a PC is equivalent to the Option key on a Mac.
✦The Enter key on a PC is equivalent to the Return key on a Mac.
When the Mac key command equivalents don’t follow the rules just
described, we note the exceptions where they occur throughout the text.

How This Book Is Organized
3
The Mac operating system uses several of the F keys to operate various 
elements such as hiding windows, opening the Dock, closing or opening 
windows and applications, and so on. To override the Mac OS defaults and
enable an application’s default key commands, open System Preferences
(in the Dock) and then open Keyboard & Mouse. Select Keyboard Shortcuts
from the three menu choices and scroll through the various shortcuts. If you
wish to change F12 from opening or closing the Dashboard, for example,
select it and click the plus sign button at the bottom of the window. Doing so
brings up a new window headed by an Application menu. Select the applica-
tion in which you wish to use F12, give it a name in the Menu Title box, and
click the F12 in the Keyboard Shortcut window. Then, pressing F12 will do
whatever the selected application wants to do instead of opening the
Dashboard. Other applications will continue to use F12 as defaulted by the
operating system, but you can change them just as easily.
How This Book Is Organized
As with all the All-in-One Desk References For Dummies, this book’s chapters
are organized into minibooks. Most of the minibooks revolve around prod-
ucts, but one is geared toward the Web development process. The following
sections describe each minibook in more detail.
Book I: Dreamweaver CS3
Dreamweaver CS3 is the crux of any Web development effort with Creative
Suite 3, so naturally, this is a good place to start. In this minibook, you get a
hands-on look at how you can use Dreamweaver to create and manage your
Web sites.
Book II: Photoshop CS3
Long the premier software for 2-D bitmap image creation and manipulation,
Photoshop is the gold standard of Web design tools. This minibook aims to
help you achieve good imagery, starting with basics that even advanced
users may have missed along the way. We show you how to color correct
images like a pro and use tools to keep images at the right resolution and
size, no matter whether the image is intended for print or for the Web.
Book III: Fireworks CS3
Thanks to Photoshop’s inclusion in CS3, Fireworks can concentrate on what
it does best: act as a conduit between Photoshop/Illustrator in the design
phase and Flash/Dreamweaver in the implementation phase of Web develop-
ment. This minibook shows you how to work with bitmap and vector images,
and how to optimize and export those images for the Web.

Conventions Used in This Book
4
Book IV: Illustrator CS3
Book IV starts with the fundamentals of Adobe Illustrator CS3 to put you on
your way to creating useful and interesting illustrations. Check out this mini-
book to discover how to take advantage of features that have been around
for many versions of Illustrator, such as the Pen tool, as well as new and
exciting advances, such as the Live Trace feature. See how to take advantage
of the Appearance palette and save time by creating graphics styles, tem-
plates, and symbols. Pick up hard-to-find keyboard shortcuts that can help
reduce the time spent mousing around for menu items and tools.
Book V: Flash CS3
Adobe Flash CS3 delivers animation, sound, video, and interactivity to the
Web as no other product ever has. If you’ve ever wanted to find out how
to use this tool to add some new zip to your Web site, this is the minibook
for you!
Book VI: Contribute CS3
Designed as a collaborative tool that turns your hard development work into
an easy interface for nontechies to update and publish content to the Web,
Contribute puts the power of maintaining Web sites in the hands of the
people you work with. In this minibook, you find everything you need to
know to get you and your collaborators up and running with Contribute in
no time flat.
Book VII: Acrobat CS3
Adobe Acrobat CS3 is a powerful viewing and editing application that allows
you to share documents with colleagues, clients, and production personnel
such as printers and Web page designers. Book VII shows you how you can
save time and money previously spent on couriers and overnight shipping
by taking advantage of annotation capabilities. Discover features that even
advanced users may have missed along the way, and see how you can feel
comfortable about using PDF as a file format of choice.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use some conventions throughout this book that merit a little explana-
tion. When you see a phrase such as “choose File➪Save,” it means to click
through the sequence of menu commands. In this example, those commands
are File followed by Save.

Icons Used in This Book
5
Whenever we tell you to click something (most likely it’s a button or an icon),
you use the left mouse button and click just once. On those rare occasions
when clicking twice is required to get the job done, we tell you to double-
click, or, if you need to use the right mouse button, we tell you to right-click.
To select an item, you either highlight it or click in a check box or radio
button, depending on the item. Text that we tell you to enter (that is, type)
into the program, such as in a text box, appears in boldface type. Web site
addresses and on-screen messages show up in monofont type. And finally,
to avoid confusion, we use title-style capitalization for option names and
links, even when the program doesn’t.
Icons Used in This Book
Along the way, when there’s something of interest to point out, we toss in
one of the icons you see in the left margin. When you see one, slow down for
a moment to check it out to see what’s up!
If there’s a way to make something easier, or a more commonly accepted
way of doing something, we tell you about it. This is the icon to look for!
When we really want to reinforce something, we throw in a Remember icon.
Pitfall ahead! That’s what this icon is all about. If something could cause
trouble, we let you know.
Because we love technology, you have to forgive us for geeking out every
now and then. When we do, though, we let you know with this icon.
This icon highlights new features in the products that make up the Adobe
Creative Suite 3 Web Premium package.
You can use the Adobe Creative Suite 3 programs together in many different
and helpful ways to make your workflow more efficient. In the Photoshop,
Illustrator, and Acrobat minibooks, we use this icon when we explain how you
can implement integration wherever it’s pertinent to the discussion at hand.

Where to Go from Here
If you’ve read this far, then you may actually be a candidate for reading this
book from cover to cover! From here, we suggest you dive right in to whatever
section you’re most interested in. Remember, all these minibooks are self-
contained and don’t require you to read the others. So have at it. It’s buffet
time, and your plate needs fillin’ up!

f you’re looking for a Web design tool that’s both easy enough for beginners
and sophisticated enough for Web design gurus, you’ve come to the right
place. Dreamweaver CS3 from Adobe is a powerful program that enables you
to create almost any type of Web page. This chapter covers the Dreamweaver
basics and introduces you to some of the program’s essential tools.
Dreamweaver is the industry standard for Web site design and production.
Whether you’re interested in creating a site for fun, such as an online photo
album or a site devoted to one of your hobbies, or for business, such as an
online store, Dreamweaver’s flexible interface provides simultaneous graphi-
cal and HTML editing. In other words, using Dreamweaver, you can not only
lay out pages like an artist but also fine-tune the associated code as a pro-
grammer would. Additionally, Dreamweaver’s built-in FTP features enable
you to upload your site to the Web in a snap so that you can share your
masterpieces with the world.
Activating Dreamweaver CS3
When you launch Dreamweaver for the first time, the Adobe Dreamweaver
CS3 Grace Period window appears. Product activation is required, but if
you’re in a hurry to get to work on your site right away, you can select the
Activate Later option and click the Next button. You have a 30-day grace
period during which you can continue to select the Activate Later option
every time you launch Dreamweaver. When the 30 days are up, though, you
won’t be able to use the application until you activate it.

Exploring the Dreamweaver CS3 Interface
10
Exploring the Dreamweaver CS3 Interface
With Dreamweaver CS3, Adobe continues the tradition of allowing you to
choose from two versions of the Dreamweaver workspace — Designer style
and Coder style — that debuted with Dreamweaver MX 2004. This selection
allows you, the developer, to work in an environment that is best suited to
your personal development taste: one geared toward WYSIWYG (What You
See Is What You Get) development and one that is more code oriented.
Selecting a workspace
Dreamweaver offers two workspace options:
✦Designer: The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface,
which shows the page you are working on much like it would be in a
Web browser. This style is more appropriate for Web design novices
working on basic HTML pages.
✦Coder: The style that shows the page you are working on as an editable
text document, which is appropriate for experienced coders and for
pages on which you’re editing CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), XML, or
dynamic code such as CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language) or ASP
(Active Server Pages).
You can switch between the two styles, or even combine them, at the click of
a button. See the “Introducing the Document Window” section, later in this
chapter, for details. You might even consider switching back and forth
between modes as you’re learning HTML because doing so is a good way to
see the underlying HTML as it’s being generated.
Introducing the Start page
After you’ve selected a workspace, when you launch Dreamweaver by
double-clicking its icon on the desktop or by selecting it from the Windows
Start menu, you’ll see a Start page, as shown in Figure 1-1. The Start page
allows you to perform the following tasks with a single click of your mouse:
✦Open pages you’ve recently edited: Simply click the filename of the
page you want to open.
✦Create a new page in one of eight formats: Simply click the type of
page you want to create, from basic HTML to ColdFusion (CFML) to CSS
(Cascading Style Sheets). You can also click More to view additional 
formats.

✦Create a new Dreamweaver Site: Click the Dreamweaver Site icon (in
the Create New column) to open the Site Definition Wizard, which guides
you through the process of setting up the directory location, FTP infor-
mation, server technology (if applicable), and more for your Web site. A
“site” in Dreamweaver is a collection of Web pages, images, and tools
that allow you to more easily manage your Web sites. See Book I,
Chapter 3 for more in-depth details on Dreamweaver Sites.
✦Create a new page based on Dreamweaver’s built-in samples: Click an
option in the Create from Samples column to open the New Document
dialog box and choose from the preset formatting options for that type
of page.
The Start page also gives you fast access to a quick tour and set of tutorials
for Dreamweaver, and to Adobe’s Dreamweaver Exchange page, where you
can find lots of nifty objects that extend Dreamweaver’s capabilities.
If you find the Start page incompatible with your working methods, you can
prevent it from appearing in the future by selecting the Don’t Show Again
check box at the lower-left corner of the page.

page gives
you one-

Introducing the Document Window
12
Introducing the Document Window
Your primary workspace in Dreamweaver is the Document window, which
appears automatically when you open a page in Dreamweaver. In the
Document window, you construct your individual Web pages using panels
and dialog boxes to format your work. The three primary views in
Dreamweaver are as follows:
✦Design view: The graphical view of your document, as shown in
Figure 1-2. You can select this view by choosing View➪Design or simply
clicking the Design button near the top left of the Document window.
✦Code view: This view shows the underlying code of your document.
You can select this view by choosing View➪Code or clicking the Code
button.
✦Split view: As you may expect, this is a split-screen view that includes
both the Code and Design windows. You can select this view by choos-
ing View➪Code and Design or clicking the Split button.

Choosing among Standard, Expanded Table, and Layout Modes
13
You can toggle between these views easily at any time by clicking their cor-
responding buttons at the top left of the Document window.
When you have several documents open in a site, you can select which doc-
ument you want to work on by clicking the document’s name at the top of
the Dreamweaver Document window. You can also click the Site tab in the
Files panel to work on an entire site.
The Insert bar sits directly underneath Dreamweaver’s main menu. It gives
you quick access to seven tabs you can use to insert everything from tables
to Flash movies to form elements in your page. To select one of the seven
categories, click the Insert bar’s name (Common, Layout, and so on) and
choose a new category from the drop-down list.
Choosing among Standard, Expanded 
Table, and Layout Modes
When viewing your document in either Split or Design view, you can view
content using the Standard mode, the Expanded Table mode, or the Layout
mode. The Standard mode is the default. (Figure 1-2, in the previous section,
shows a page in Standard mode in the Design view, with the Insert bar set to
Common.) The Expanded Table mode makes it easier for you to select tables
and cells (though if you want to resize the table or row or column, you need
to do so in Standard mode). The Expanded Table mode is most useful for
editing existing tables. The Layout mode provides a simpler interface for
drawing and editing tables and table cells.
Two special tools are available only when working in Layout mode: the Draw
Layout Cell button and the Draw Layout Table button. A table created with
the Draw Layout Table tool is shown in Figure 1-3. Both of these tools can
help you generate tables or table cells quickly and easily in Dreamweaver,
and are described in more detail in Book I, Chapter 2.
To change to the Layout mode, select the Layout Insert bar at the top left of
the Document window and click the Layout Mode button, or choose View➪
Table Mode➪Layout Mode, or press Alt+F6. When you’re in Layout mode,
press Alt+F6 (Opt+F6 on a Mac) to return to Standard mode.
To change to Expanded Table mode, select the Layout Insert bar at the top
left of the Document window and click the Expanded Table Mode button at
the top of the Document window, or choose View➪Table Mode➪Expanded
Table Mode, or press F6. When you’re in Expanded Table mode, press F6 or
click the Expanded Table Mode button to return to Standard mode. Note:
None of the table modes is available in Code view.

Examining Your Web Site with the Files Panel
14
Examining Your Web Site with the Files Panel
Dreamweaver offers Web developers the opportunity to work on individual
files that make up a Web site, as well as to manage their entire Web site, all
through the Dreamweaver interface. This concept is called, not surprisingly,
a Site; to avoid confusion, we call them Dreamweaver Sites. Dreamweaver
Sites can include the following elements:
✦HTML, CFM, ASP, and other files that make up the code of the site
✦Graphics, such as GIF and JPEG files
✦Documents, such as PDF and DOC files
✦Directories (folders that might contain any of the above)
Dreamweaver Sites are initially viewable within the Files panel (which is open
by default; if the Files panel is not open, you can open it by pressing F8).
To expand the Files panel so that it fills your screen, or to collapse the panel
back to panel size, click the Expand/Collapse button (the icon of the two-
row, two-column box with an arrow in the middle, at the right of the panel).

Exploring Toolbar Buttons
15
The Web site management tools for Dreamweaver Sites are designed to give
you total control over the way in which your Web site is built and main-
tained from your local computer. The key features of the Dreamweaver Site
tools include
✦Asset management tools that help you manage all the files that make up
your site. For example, these tools keep track of all your files and the
links between files. Anytime you move a file, the tools will change the
related links in other files.
✦Basic source control to ensure that files don’t get overwritten. These tools
lock files so that when you’re working on a particular file, others on your
team can’t edit that same file.
✦Publishing tools that allow you to use FTP to upload the content from
your site locally to the remote server where the site is housed.
✦Utilities that create site maps, check links, check the HTML code, and
run reports on who’s been working on what.
Dreamweaver Sites are covered in more detail in Book I, Chapter 3.
Exploring Toolbar Buttons
Dreamweaver provides you with a number of useful view buttons (shown in
Figure 1-4 and Figure 1-5) that you can use to see different views of your site
or to perform various functions. You can easily switch among views to exam-
ine your site in different ways. Each Dreamweaver view offers specialized
menus and tools to help you perform your work in that view. Certain views
are available for an individual document or page, whereas other views are
available for the entire site. At any time while you work, you can choose to
preview your site in target Web browsers, which enables you to see your site
from the user’s perspective.
Figure 1-4 shows the following Site-related buttons from the Files panel:
✦Connect to Remote Host button: Connects your local computer and your
Web host, allowing you to transfer files between the two computers.
✦Refresh button: Refreshes the panel’s view of files in the Site if you’ve
made a change to filenames or file structures outside of Dreamweaver
while the program was open.
✦Get File(s) button: Downloads (retrieves) documents and files from
the host.

Exploring Toolbar Buttons
16
✦Put File(s) button: Uploads (sends) documents and files to the host.
✦Check Out File(s) button: Locks files for editing by a single individual.
✦Check In button: Replaces files on the server and makes them available
for editing by unlocking them.
✦Synchronize button: Upload or download files to synch the assets on
your local site with those on your remote site.
✦Expand/Collapse button: Enlarges the Site tab to full screen, with remote
and local files side by side (or, conversely, collapses the full-screen view).
Figure 1-5 shows the following document-related buttons from the top of the
Document window:
✦Code: Enables you to view the HTML page code full-screen.
✦Split: Allows you to view the HTML page code and the graphical view of
your document at the same time.
✦Design: Enables you to view the WYSIWIG graphical representation of
your page full-screen.

and what you have selected in a document or panel.
Using Panels and Inspectors
You can use Dreamweaver panels and inspectors to enter details about all
aspects of your Web site. These interfaces offer areas where you can add
and format page features, set up navigation and behaviors, and manage the
workflow of building your site.

Using Panels and Inspectors
18
Understanding the role of panels
A panel typically provides information about all instances of a particular fea-
ture on a page. For example, the Layers panel lists information about all the
layers on the current page.
The Tag Inspector panel gives you easy access to various properties and
behaviors specific to a selected object. The Tag Inspector panel updates
continually, depending on what you have selected on your page. (If you have
nothing selected on the page, the panel displays properties and behaviors of
the whole page itself, as shown in Figure 1-6.) Note that the Tag Inspector
panel’s name reflects the HTML or CFML tag being inspected.
To switch among tabs in a panel, just click the tab names.
Working with the Properties panel
The Properties panel changes, as does the Tag Inspector panel, based on the
individual document object you have selected on your page, and it contains
details on attributes of the object. For example, selecting text on a page
opens the Text Property inspector in the Properties panel, where you can
format the size, font, color, link, and other attributes of the text. (Figure 1-3
shows the Properties panel with a Layout Table selected.) To make certain
that the Properties panel is shown below the Document window, choose
Window➪Properties or press Shift+F3.
The Properties panel has a small down arrow in the lower-right corner,
called an Expander button. Click the button to enlarge the Properties panel
to view additional formatting options. In an expanded Properties panel, click
the small up arrow in the lower-right corner to collapse the panel.

Getting Help
Dreamweaver offers a variety of tools to help you find the answer to virtually
any question you have about the program. The Help tools provide basic
information for beginners, as well as advanced references detailing HTML
and JavaScript code.
You can get help by clicking the Help button — the small question mark —
in the top-right corner of some panels. Similarly, you can open the Options
menu in the top-right corner of any panel and select Help from the list.
You can also access help by using the Help menu located on the main menu.
Just choose Help and then you can select from a host of options. Some of the
more popular ones include
✦Dreamweaver Help: Provides definitions and itemized steps in perform-
ing routine Dreamweaver tasks. It contains Help Contents, Index, and
Search categories.
✦Spry Framework Help: Launches a Web browser and loads a page from
the Adobe Web site, where you can find information about the Spry
framework. See Book I, Chapter 7 for step-by-step instructions on using
Dreamweaver to place smart Spry widgets on a page.
✦Using ColdFusion: Provides information about coding dynamic sites
using ColdFusion technology.
✦Reference: Opens the Reference tab of the Results panel, offering a 
dictionary-style reference on CSS, HTML, Accessibility requirements,
Sitespring tags, and JavaScript. You can also access the Reference tab
of the Results panel by clicking the Reference button in the Document
window.
✦Extensions: Provides assistance in performing more advanced
Dreamweaver tasks, especially tasks involving the integration of adjunct
programs, such as Adobe Flash, with Dreamweaver. This help option
contains nitty-gritty information about application programming inter-
faces (APIs) — specific software interfaces that allow you to integrate
Dreamweaver with databases, the C and Java programming languages,
and much more.
✦Dreamweaver Support Center: Connects you to the Web, where you
can find constantly updated information on working with Dreamweaver,
answers to frequently asked questions, and program extensions. You can
also join a developer’s forum, where you can chat with other Dreamweaver
users to get (and give) help.

T
he most significant (and, fortunately, the easiest) process in building a
Web site is creating the individual pages that convey the site’s content.
Even if you plan on creating an ultrahip site chock full of animation and
interactive forms, you spend the vast majority of your site-building effort
constructing basic Web pages comprised of words and images. This chapter
shows you how to set up, add color to, and name individual Web pages. You
also discover how to add basic elements such as text, graphics, and tables,
to your pages.
Setting Ruler and Grid Options 
in the Document Window
Dreamweaver offers you complete control over how you work in the Document
window by providing two guide tools — rulers and a grid — to help you lay
out your work accurately. You can customize a variety of guide tool attributes,
such as ruler increments and grid snapping, to suit your personal prefer-
ences and speed Web page development.

Setting Ruler and Grid Options in the Document Window
22
Here’s a brief look at all your options with rulers and grids:
✦Turning rulers on and off: Using rulers — both horizontal and vertical —
in the Document window can help you measure and position page 
elements. Toggle the rulers on and off by choosing View➪Rulers➪
Show or by pressing Ctrl+Alt+R (Ô+Opt+R on a Mac).
✦Moving and resetting the origin: By default, the origin, or (0,0) coordinate,
of a Dreamweaver ruler is set to the upper-left corner of the Document
window. You can reposition it to any coordinate in the Document window
by clicking the origin cross hairs and dragging them to new coordinates,
which can be useful if you want to use the rulers to position elements
of a table whose upper-left corner doesn’t sit at (0,0) in the Document
window. Reset the origin to its default position by choosing View➪
Rulers➪Reset Origin.
✦Changing ruler measurement units: You can change the ruler’s measur-
ing increment by choosing View➪Rulers and then choosing Pixels,
Inches, or Centimeters.
✦Viewing the grid: Dreamweaver provides a Document window grid that
can assist you in visually positioning and aligning page elements. You can
toggle the grid on and off by choosing View➪Grid➪Show Grid or press-
ing Ctrl+Alt+G (Ô+Opt+G on a Mac). The grid is shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1:
The grid
is on.

Book I
Chapter 2
Creating Basic 
Web Pages
Establishing Page Properties
23
✦Activating and deactivating grid snapping: The Document window grid
offers a snapping feature that causes a div or Layout table or cell to
automatically align precisely with the snap-to points you define, which
can be useful when you draw, resize, or move a div (see Book I, Chapter 5
for the skinny on divs). You can toggle grid snapping on and off by
choosing View➪Grid➪Snap to Grid.
You can adjust how the grid appears in the Document window in the Grid
Settings dialog box. To do so, open the Grid Settings dialog box by choosing
View➪Grid➪Grid Settings and change any (or all) of the attributes that
appear. When you finish, click the Apply button to view the effect of your
changes. Click OK to accept the changes and close the dialog box.
Creating and Opening Pages
You have several ways to create a new page in Dreamweaver:
✦On the Start page, scan through the Create New column and click the
type of page you want to create from scratch.
✦On the Start page, click one of the options in the Create from Samples
column to open the New Document dialog box and make a new page
with many common settings precoded.
✦Choose File➪New or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N to open the New
Document dialog box, from which you can create pages from scratch or
from templates.
To open an existing page, do any of the following:
✦On the Start page, click the name of the page in the Open Recent column.
✦Double-click the page’s filename in the Files tab of the Files panel.
✦Choose File➪Open or press Ctrl+O to summon the Open dialog box,
which you can use to browse to the page you want to open.
Establishing Page Properties
The Page Properties dialog box provides you with control over how several
key page properties appear, including the title of the page, page background
color, link colors, and page margins. Selections apply only to the current
page, not to the entire site. Open a Page Properties dialog box similar to the
one shown in Figure 2-2 by choosing Modify➪Page Properties or pressing
Ctrl+J. Then make changes to any of the following in each of the five cate-
gories (Appearance, Links, Headings, Title/Encoding, and Tracing Image):

Establishing Page Properties
24
✦Page Font, Size, Text Color, Background Color, Background Image:
Choose a font or set of fonts from the Page Font drop-down list; add a
style (bold or italic) if desired. Click the Color box next to each property
and pick a color from the Web-safe color palette that appears, or enter a
hexadecimal color code directly in any Color Code text field. You can also
customize your own colors by selecting the color wheel and entering
either RGB values or Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity values. For more
information about using colors for the Web, see Book III, Chapter 2.
Book III, Chapter 3 includes information on how to use the color picker
to select colors in both Dreamweaver and Fireworks. For Background
Image, click the Browse button to locate the image file that you want to
appear as the Document window background. If the image is smaller
than the available background area, the image is tiled (repeated in a
checkerboard fashion, like floor tiles) to fill the background.
Even if you choose to use a background image, select a complementary
background color; the color shows while the background image is 
downloading.
✦Left Margin, Right Margin, Top Margin, and Bottom Margin: Enter
numbers (in pixels) in these text fields to set up margins that affect how
your page appears in modern browsers. Enter a whole number for the
number of pixels of buffer space you want between the left, right, top,
and bottom edges of your document and the content of the document.
✦Link Font and Size, Color for Links, Rollover Links, Visited Links, and
Active Links: Choose a font or set of fonts from the drop-down list; add
a style (bold or italic) if desired. Click the Color box next to each property
and pick a color from the Web-safe color palette that appears, or enter a
Figure 2-2:

hexadecimal color code directly in any Color Code text field. You can
also customize your own colors (see the first bullet on Text Color).
✦Underline Style: Select an option from the drop-down list.
✦Heading Font, Sizes, and Colors: Choose a font or set of fonts from the
drop-down list; add a style (bold or italic) if desired. For as many of the
six standard HTML heading levels as necessary, select a font size. If you
choose a numeric value, the unit-of-measurement drop-down list to the
right becomes active so that you can select an option. Click the Color
box next to each heading and pick a color from the Web-safe color
palette that appears, or enter a hexadecimal color code directly in any
Color Code text field. You can also customize your own colors (see the
first bullet point on Text Color).
✦Title/Encoding: Enter a page title in the text field. This title appears in
the title bar area of the window both during construction in Dreamweaver
and when the page is viewed in a Web browser. Select an Encoding format
if your site requires the use of non-Western fonts (Japanese or Cyrillic,
for example). If your site is in English, you can leave the setting at the
default, Western European.
✦Tracing Image: Click the Browse button to locate the image file you
want to use as a guide for laying out your Web page in the Document
window. This feature is handy for developers who prefer to mock up a
portion of their Web page design in a graphics program and then re-create
that design in their Web pages. Tracing images appear in Dreamweaver
only as a pattern to help guide you in creating an actual Web page; the
tracing image never appears on the finished Web page.
✦Image Transparency: Drag the slider to adjust the visibility level of the
tracing image. At 0 percent, the tracing image is invisible; at 100 percent,
the image is completely opaque.
Click the Apply button to view the effect of any property you change. Click
OK to accept your changes and close the Page Properties dialog box.
Working with Text
As we mention in Book I, Chapter 1, Dreamweaver has three different design
views: Design, Code, and Split (Code and Design). The following sections apply
when you’re working in Design view or Split view of Dreamweaver. In these
views, you can enter and manipulate text on a Web page in Dreamweaver by
using similar procedures to those you use when working with a word pro-
cessing document.

Working with Text
26
Adding, editing, and deleting text
To enter text on a page, click in the Document window and begin typing.
Your mouse pointer appears as a blinking cursor that moves along with the
text you enter. When you reach the end of a line, the text automatically
wraps to the next line. Dreamweaver automatically adds the associated code
for your new text in the HTML for the page.
To delete text from a page, in the Document window, select the chunk that
you want to delete and press Backspace or Del on your keyboard.
You can also modify how text appears on a page by editing its font, size, color,
alignment, and other attributes. To modify text in the Document window,
click and drag to select the text you want to modify. The Properties panel
loads the Text Property inspector, as shown in Figure 2-3 (the Tag Inspector
panel also reflects the selection). If the Text Property inspector is not open,
choose Window➪Properties or press Ctrl+F3 to open it. In the Text Property
inspector, modify any of the following properties:
✦Format: From the Format drop-down list, select a default text style.
Heading 1 is the largest style and Heading 6 is the smallest, but none of
the headings correlates with a specific pixel size unless you set it to do so.
Select Paragraph for the basic body text of your pages. Select Preformatted
if you want spaces, tabs, and new lines in a paragraph to show up in a
browser. (Ordinarily, when you add multiple spaces in a row or tabs to
your HTML — this is particularly obvious in the Dreamweaver docu-
ment’s Code view — they appear as single spaces in a browser.)
✦Font: Select a font face from the Font drop-down list. Browsers show
your text formatted as the first font in your selection that resides on the
user’s computer. Choosing Edit Font List allows you to add more fonts that
you may have installed on your computer to the Font drop-down list.
Most computers will have standard fonts such as Arial and Helvetica
and won’t have less common fonts such as, say, Univers or Futura. If you
use a nonstandard font and it’s not on the user’s machine, the layout
could look very different from what you planned.

✦Style: Dreamweaver has been updated to work better with CSS styles.
Styles defined within the document or in a linked stylesheet will be avail-
able from the Style drop-down list. You can also use the drop-down list
to attach a stylesheet and create and edit styles.
✦Size: Select a font size from the Size drop-down list. The options include
None (choosing this option displays text in the default size), specific
numbers, generic sizes XX-small to XX-large, and relative sizes Smaller
and Larger. If you select a number, the unit-of-measurement drop-down
list becomes available so that you can specify what the font size number
refers to (pixels, ems, and so on).
✦Color: Click the color box and select a text color from the Web-safe color
palette that appears. Alternatively, you may enter a hexadecimal color
code directly in any color code text field. (To set the default text color
for a page, check out the “Establishing Page Properties” section, earlier
in this chapter.)
✦Bold or Italic: Click the Bold button to make your selected text appear
in bold. Click the Italic button to italicize your selected text. You can
click either button, or both.
✦Alignment: Click an alignment button to align your text. Choices are Left,
Center, Right, and Justify.
✦Link: Type a URL in this field to transform selected text into a hypertext
link. You can also use the Point to File tool to link to a file. To link to a
file using this tool, just follow these steps:
1. Open the Files panel by choosing Window➪Files or by pressing F8.
2. Open Explorer to the folder location that includes the file you
want to link to by selecting the collapsing menu squares.
Alternatively, skip to Step 3 and hover your cursor over the folder
that contains the file; the folder will expand so that you can select
the file within.
3. Click and hold the Point to File button in the Text Property inspec-
tor and drag the pointer to the file you want to link to. Release the
mouse button when the pointer is over the file.
The Point to File button looks like a compass without the needle or a
clock face without hands or numbers. It’s located to the right of the
Links field.
When you’re dragging the button, a line appears from the origin
point to your cursor, as shown in Figure 2-4.
After you let go of the mouse button, the link to the file appears in
the Link text field. If you select the Link drop-down list, it shows you
your recent links as well.

Working with Text
28
✦Target: If you are linking the selected text, you can specify how the
linked page will open when the user clicks the link; you do so by select-
ing one of the following options from the drop-down list:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the window that is cur-
rently open. If the window with the link in it is not in a frame, the
linked page opens in the same window as the link. If the link is in a
frame, the linked window will open in the parent frame or in the
parent window of the frame with the link. See Book I, Chapter 4 for
more information about frames.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default target.
• _top: Opens the link in the top-level window, replacing any existing
frames.
✦List: Click the Unordered List button next to the Target field to transform
text into an unordered (bulleted) list; click the Ordered List button to
transform text into an ordered (numbered) list.
Figure 2-4:

29
✦Placement: Click the Text Outdent button, which you find next to the
Ordered List button, to outdent (decrease the indent) the selected text;
click the Text Indent button to indent the selected text. If you outdent an
item in a bulleted or numbered list, the item will no longer be a list item.
Inserting a line break
When you want to start a new line in a word-processing program, you 
press the Enter key. If you press Enter in Dreamweaver, you create a para-
graph break, which starts a new paragraph and creates a blank space
between paragraphs. If you want to start a new line directly under another
line of text and without the big space between lines, you need to insert 
a line break. In Dreamweaver, you create a line break by choosing
Insert➪HTML➪Special Characters➪Line Break or by pressing Shift+Enter.
Alternatively, you may click the Insert Line Break button from the HTML 
category of the Insert bar. Dreamweaver places the cursor at the start 
of the next line and inserts the line-break HTML code.
Working with Images
Aside from entering text, manipulating images on a Web page is probably
the most common Dreamweaver function you perform. You can add or
delete an image and modify its properties to create an aesthetically
pleasing layout that effectively conveys the information you want to deliver
to the user.
To see how to place an image on the background of your page, check out the
“Establishing Page Properties” section, earlier in this chapter.
Inserting an image
To insert an image on a page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Image.
Alternatively, you can click the Insert Image button in the Common cate-
gory of the Insert bar.
2. In the Select Image Source dialog box that appears (shown in Figure 2-5),
click the image you want to insert.
If the image is outside the folder that holds your HTML document, use
the Look In drop-down list to browse to the file you want. The Image Tag
Accessibility Attributes window appears.

Working with Images
30
3. If desired, enter Alternate text in the Alternate Text field of the Image
Tag Accessibility Attributes window.
Specifying alternate text ensures that when viewers’ browsers don’t —
or can’t — display the image, some meaningful text appears instead; it
also serves as an alternative for sight-impaired visitors to your page.
Alternate text should be limited to a few words. You can also add more
details about the image in the Long description field.
4. Click OK to insert the image.
Note: Every image you want to include on a Web page should reside
within the root folder of the current site. (Typically, you should have
your HTML files in the site root folder — the master folder that holds
everything on your site — and all your images in an images folder that’s
also in the site’s root folder.) If you attempt to insert an image from
another location, Dreamweaver asks whether you want to copy the
image to the current site root folder. Click Yes. In the Copy File As dialog
box, you can enter a new name for the image in the File Name text field,
or you can accept the current name and click the Save button.
Always be sure that you have saved your HTML file at least once before you
insert an image into it. If your file isn’t saved, Dreamweaver won’t know
where to place the image in relation to the file. After you’ve saved the file in
a particular folder, the location is known and Dreamweaver can include the
correct relative location of the image.

Select the Preview Images check box at the bottom of the Select Image
Source dialog box to view a thumbnail of the image before you select it for
insertion. The preview area also tells you the size of the image and the
expected download time.
Deleting or moving an image
To delete an image from a page, click the image in the Document window and
press the Delete key on your keyboard.
If you want to move the image from one place on the page to another, you
can click the image in the Document window, press Ctrl+X to cut the image,
click the spot on the page where you want to move the image, and press
Ctrl+V to paste the image. You can also move an image by clicking and drag-
ging it to a new location.
Modifying an image
You can modify how an image appears on a page by editing its size and align-
ment, adding a border, and changing other attributes.
To modify an image, click the image in the Document window to select it. If
the Image Property inspector does not appear, choose Window➪Properties
to open it.
To see all the options the Image Property inspector offers, click the down
arrow in the bottom-right corner of the Image Property inspector. (Clicking
the up arrow displays fewer options.)
You can do any of the following things to modify the way an image appears:
✦Resize the image: Click and drag a sizing handle to change the dimen-
sions of the image. To resize the image maintaining the same propor-
tions, hold down the Shift key as you drag a sizing handle. You can also
resize the image by typing new pixel dimensions in the W and H text
fields in the Image Property inspector. Click the Resample button to con-
form the resized image to the new dimensions. (Otherwise, resizing in
Dreamweaver changes the dimensions in which the browser draws the
image but leaves the image file itself untouched — and image quality suf-
fers when the browser resizes the image.)
If you want the resized image to look its best, you may be better off
resizing the image in Fireworks, because Fireworks gives you more con-
trol over the resizing process. To edit the image in Fireworks, select the
image and click the Edit button (the pencil icon) in the Edit section of
the Properties panel.

Working with Images
32
✦Align the image: In the Image Property inspector, click an alignment
button to position the image on the page (or within a cell if the image is
located in a table cell). Alignment button choices are Left, Center, and
Right. To align an image with special word wrapping, select one of the
alignment options, which are detailed in Table 2-1, from the Align 
drop-down list that appears when you position your image near a
bunch of text.
✦Add a border to the image: In the Image Property inspector, enter a
number in the Border text field to add a border of that thickness to the
image. Border thickness is measured in pixels.
✦Pad an image with spaces: In the Image Property inspector, enter a
number in pixels in the V Space (V for vertical) text field for the space
you want to appear between the top and bottom of the image and other
page elements; then, enter a number in pixels in the H Space (H for hori-
zontal) text field for the space you want to appear between the image
and page elements on either side of the image.
✦Make the image a link: In the Image Property inspector, enter a URL in
the Link text field.
✦Specify alternate text for the image: In the Image Property inspector,
enter alternative text in the Alt field. (Specifying alternate text ensures
that when viewers’ browsers don’t — or can’t — display the image,
some meaningful text appears instead, and also serves as an alternative
for sight-impaired visitors to your page.)
✦Name the image: In the Image Property inspector, enter a name in the
text field next to the thumbnail image. (Naming an image is important if
you want to refer to that image using a behavior or scripting language,
such as JavaScript, but is otherwise unnecessary.)
✦Edit the image: In the Image Property inspector, click the Edit button.
Dreamweaver allows you to optimize, crop, resample, adjust brightness
and contrast of, and sharpen an image by using the buttons in the Edit
section of the Image Property inspector. If you want the most control
over the process of editing the image, click the Edit button to open the
image in Fireworks or Photoshop. You’ll have the choice of working
directly with the image or opening the source file the image came from.
In most cases, you maintain the highest image quality by manipulating
the pre-optimized source version of the image and then exporting it as a
new GIF or JPEG.

✦Change the image file: In the Image Property inspector, enter a different
filename in the Src (source) text field (or click the File Folder button to
browse for image files).
✦Add an image map: In Dreamweaver, you can add multiple hyperlinked
hotspots to images to create an image map. In the bottom left of the
Image Property inspector, you see an arrow pointer and some image
tools (a rectangle, circle, and free-form hotspot creator). With these
tools, you can create hotspots on your images, and you can specify the
following for each hotspot:
• The link location for the hotspot
• The target window for the link
• The alternate text for the hotspot

Working with Links
Linking your page to other Web pages enables you to direct visitors to
related content on the Web. To insert a link, you must specify an image or
some text to serve as the link; you must also specify the link location to
which you want to send your visitors. The link can go to a page within your
site or to a page elsewhere on the Web.

Working with Links
34
Inserting a link
To insert a link on a page, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or image you want to make into a link.
Doing so opens the Property inspector for your text or image. If the
Property inspector does not appear, choose Window➪Properties to
open it.
2. In the Link area of the Property inspector, enter the destination URL
of the link (text or image) that you created in Step 1.
The URL you specify can be any valid URL; for example, it can be a
Web page within your own site (somePage.html), a page on the Web
(http://www.someSite.com/somePage.html), or even an e-mail address
(mailto:somebody@somewhere.com).
Alternatively, you may click the File Folder button that you see in the
Property inspector to display the Select File dialog box. After you
browse your computer using the Select File dialog box and select a file,
click OK to make that file the target of a link.
To create an e-mail link quickly, click anywhere in your document and
choose Insert➪Email Link. Specifying the same value for the Text and
E-mail fields that appear allows folks who haven’t configured their Web
browsers to handle e-mail automatically to see the e-mail address on the
page. Then, they can copy and paste the e-mail address information into
their e-mail program of choice.
Deleting a link
To delete a link from text or an image without deleting the text or image
itself, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or image you want to remove the link from.
The Property inspector for your text or image opens. If the Property
inspector doesn’t appear, choose Window➪Properties to open it.
2. In the Property inspector, delete the URL from the Link text field.
Note that if you delete a linked image or linked text from a page, the link gets
deleted along with the text or image.

Using named anchors
When you want to create a navigational link that connects users not only to
a page but also to a specific location on the page, you need to create a named
anchor. Named anchors are frequently used for jumping to exact positions
within a large block of text so that users don’t have to scroll through para-
graph after paragraph to find the information they need. Named anchors are
especially useful when creating links from a directory or a table of contents
to the content it presents.
Inserting a named anchor
Place an anchor anywhere on your Web page as follows:
1. In the Document window, click at the position you want to insert the
named anchor.
2. Click the Named Anchor button on the Common category of the Insert
bar or choose Insert➪Named Anchor.
The Named Anchor dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-6. If the
Insert bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category name
and select Common from the drop-down list.
3. Type a name in the Anchor Name text field.
4. Click OK.
It’s a good idea to insert the named anchor tag slightly above the actual posi-
tion where you want the link to target. Doing so gives your targeted content
a little padding on top. Otherwise, the top of your image or your first line of
text appears flush with the top of the browser window.

Linking to a named anchor
To link to a named anchor, follow the procedure outlined in the “Inserting
a link” section, earlier in this chapter, with the following modifications:
✦Linking to a named anchor on the current page: In the Link text 
field of the Property inspector, type a pound sign (#) followed by the
anchor name.
✦Linking to a named anchor on a different page: In the Link text field of
the Property inspector, type the page’s URL followed by a pound sign
and then the anchor name.
Be sure not to include any spaces in the names of anchors. These may not
be read by the various Web browsers.
Working with Tables
You can position objects (such as text blocks, images, or animations) rela-
tive to each other on a page in two basic ways:
✦Using tables: A time-honored Web tradition for page layout, tables are
grids of cells defined by columns and rows. Cells can have set sizes and
alignments and may contain anything you can put on a Web page, includ-
ing other tables.
✦Using divs: Divs can be positioned precisely, and in Dreamweaver, divs
are in some ways easier to use than tables. For instructions on how to
lay out your Web page with divs, see Book I, Chapter 5.
Adding a table to a Web page can help you lay out page elements more easily
in the Document window. Tables consist of as many holding areas, or cells,
as you want, and you can place virtually any Web element, such as text or an
image, into a cell. Cells are organized horizontally into rows and vertically
into columns. Dreamweaver provides you with complete control over the
size, position, color, and other attributes of your table. You can edit these
attributes at any time via the Table Property inspector.
Inserting a table
To insert a table into a Web page, just follow these steps:
1. Click within the document at the point where you want to place the
table.
2. Choose Insert➪Table, press Ctrl+Alt+T (Ô+Opt+T on a Mac), or click
the Table button in the Common category of the Insert bar.

Book I
Chapter 2

37
The Insert Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-7. If the Insert
bar is set to a different category, click and hold the category name and
select Common from the drop-down list.
3. Enter the number of rows and columns you want the table to have in
the corresponding Rows and Columns fields.
You can always add or remove rows or columns later.
4. Use the Table Width field to set a width for the table.
The width can be either a set number of pixels or a percentage of the
area that bounds the table (the page itself, or, if the table is nested in a
cell, that cell).
5. In the Border Thickness field, enter a number for how many pixels
thick you want the border of your table to be.
If you don’t want the table border to show (which you probably don’t 
if you’re using the table for page layout purposes), enter 0 (zero).
6. In the Cell Padding field, enter a whole number for the amount of
pixels you want between the border of the cell and the text or object
inside the cell.
The cell padding applies to the top, bottom, left, and right of the inside
of each and every cell.
7. In the Cell Spacing field, enter a number for the amount of pixels you
want between the cells.
The cell spacing applies to the whole table; you can’t have different cell
spacing for individual rows or columns.
Figure 2-7:
Fill out the
Insert Table
dialog box
to create
a table.

Working with Tables
38
8. If your table has a header row or header column (or both), click the
button (None, Left, Top, or Both) that represents the header structure
of your table.
The text in a header row has special formatting that you can define in a
stylesheet. If you’re creating a table for layout purposes, you won’t want
a header row or column, so make sure that None is selected.
9. In the Accessibility section of the Insert Table dialog box, enter a cap-
tion and summary for the table if you need to describe the table for a
sight-impaired audience.
If you’re making the table for page layout purposes, leave these blank.
10. Click OK.
The Insert Table dialog box disappears and the empty table appears in
your document.
An empty table is shown in Figure 2-8. To enter data into the table, just click
an individual cell and enter the content you want in that cell. You can modify
any of the table’s attributes by selecting the table and changing the attrib-
utes in the Property inspector or the Tag Inspector panel.

Deleting a table
To delete a table from a page, click the border of the table to select it and
then press the Backspace or Del key. Dreamweaver removes the table from
your page and deletes the associated code in the HTML for the page.
Naturally, everything that was in the table is also deleted from the page.
Using layout tables
The use of tables is central to the traditional way of building great Web
pages. (For information on laying out pages with divs, see Book I, Chapter 5.)
What happens, though, when you want to put an image right smack in the
middle of a page, or when you want to have one column of information along
the right side of the page and a square text block at the bottom of the page?
You can nest tables, which involves building new tables inside cells of other
tables, but creating nested tables is complicated, especially with complex
pages.
Thankfully, Dreamweaver offers an easy way to work with complex tables
called layout tables. With a layout table, you tell Dreamweaver where you
want to put something on the screen, and the program generates all the
required tablework to make it happen.
To create a layout table, just follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Table Mode➪Layout Mode or press Alt+F6.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click the Layout tab.
The first time you press Alt+F6 (Opt+F6 on a Mac), a Table Help dialog
box appears.
2. Click the Draw Layout Table button (just to the left of the Draw Layout
Cell button).
3. Click and drag the cross hair to create the layout table of your choice.
A light-green table appears, as shown in Figure 2-9, with the dimensions
you gave it.
4. To create individual cells within that table, click the Draw Layout Cell
button to the right of the Draw Layout Table button and draw a cell
anywhere within the table.
If you create a layout cell outside a layout table, Dreamweaver will
create both the cell and the table to support it. Note that you cannot
draw a new cell that overlaps an existing cell in the table.

Working with Tables
40
If you create a layout cell, you can immediately edit the cell you created.
However, if you create a layout table, you either have to switch back to
Standard view to edit the single cell of that table or create a layout cell
within the table before you can edit the table.
Storing information in table cells
After you insert a table into a page, you can add or delete elements such as
text and images in the table cells:
✦Adding an image to a cell: To add an image to a table cell, click in a
table cell and choose Insert➪Image or press Ctr+Alt+I (Ô+Opt+I on
a Mac). Browse and select an image you want to add to the cell and
then click OK. (For more information on inserting images, flip to the
“Inserting an image” section, earlier in this chapter.)
✦Adding text to a cell: To add text to a table cell, click to position the
cursor in a table cell and type the text you want placed inside the cell.

✦Deleting an image from a cell: To delete an image from a table cell,
select the image and press Backspace or Del.
✦Deleting text from a cell: To delete text from a table cell, select the text
and press Backspace or Del.
Previewing Your Work
Whether you’re working in Code view or Design view, at some point you’ll
want to see the page as visitors to your site will see it: in a browser such as
Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. If you have two or more browsers
on your computer, you can preview your page in any of the browsers —
without leaving Dreamweaver — by using the Preview in Browser feature.
To preview your page in your primary browser, choose File➪
Preview in Browser➪Browser Name, or press F12. The keyboard 
shortcut for previewing in your secondary browser is Shift+F12.
Checking Browser Compatibility
One of the most frustrating things about creating Web sites is that the same
HTML and CSS code may display differently in different browsers. In fact, it’s
possible that one part of a page that displays in one browser won’t display
at all in another.
Dreamweaver can find problems in the code that may lead to display issues
in different browsers. To use the Browser Compatibility Check, just follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪Check Page➪Browser Compatibility.
The Results panel appears at the bottom of the workspace, open to the
Browser Compatibility Check tab.
2. Click the green right-facing arrow at the top left of the panel and
choose Check Browser Compatibility from the menu that appears.
Dreamweaver searches your code for problems. Any issues it finds are
listed in the panel, ordered by the line in the code where each problem
appears.

Chapter 3: Creating and Using
Dreamweaver Sites
In This Chapter
 Defining a Site in Dreamweaver CS3
 Whipping up your first site
 Establishing a remote connection
 Using advanced site options
 Publishing and maintaining your site
 Using source control
You can use Dreamweaver CS3 to create many different kinds of Web
pages. During the course of building a Web site, you’ll add pages,
graphics, links, and all sorts of related information at a single location to
be posted eventually to a Web server on the Internet. After your site is 
complete, you’ll probably want to make updates and fixes. Heck, you may
even be making more than one site at the same time!
To help facilitate management of your Web site (or sites), Dreamweaver
offers a suite of site management tools. These tools are collectively called a
Dreamweaver Site. This chapter explores how you can use these tools to
manage your Web site more easily.
Defining a Site in Dreamweaver CS3
Figure 3-1 shows a typical relationship between where you build your Web
site (on your desktop) and where the site actually lives on the Internet (on a
Web server). Dreamweaver Sites facilitate getting all the correct information
from your desktop to the Web server and generally make the Web page cre-
ation process easier. Specifically, a Dreamweaver Site enables you to do the
following:
✦Move files seamlessly back and forth between your local machine and
your Web server.
✦Keep all your Site files in a single location.

Creating Your First Site
44
✦Generate pages for your Site based on templates that you create.
✦Run reports on the pages in your Site to check links, page load, and
other key functions.
✦Use source- and version-control to manage who works on what files and
when they do it, which can prevent team members from accidentally
overwriting each other’s work when building or maintaining a Site 
collaboratively.
Creating Your First Site
If you’re working with a set of files regularly in Dreamweaver, or if you’re
managing several sites, you’re likely to find using Dreamweaver Sites —
which are different from a traditional Web site — an efficient way of working.
You can create a Site in Dreamweaver manually or by using a wizard.
This section shows you how to create a Dreamweaver Site manually. The fol-
lowing steps walk you through inputting the minimum amount of information
that you need to enter to create your Site. However, you can choose from a
number of other options, and they are covered in the “Using Advanced Site
Options” section, later in this chapter.
To create a basic site manually, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪New Site.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, opened to the Advanced tab
by default. The Local Info options, shown in Figure 3-2, appear by
default.

2. Set the options for your site by filling out each of the following pieces
of information:
• Site Name: Choose a name that you can remember easily and that
applies to the function of the Site.
• Local Root Folder: This is the location on your hard drive where you
want to store the files that make up your site. Again, you should title
the folder something intuitive and easy to remember. If you want to
browse for a folder, just click the folder icon to the right of the text
field.
• Default Images Folder: This is the standard directory for images
used on your site. Dreamweaver adds images here when you copy
image files into your Site. A good practice is to name this folder
images (if your site will be hosted on a UNIX-based server, you need
to be consistent about using upper- and lowercase letters in file-
names and links to those files from your site). If you want to browse
for the directory, just click the folder icon next to the text field.
• Links Relative To: Select Document if you want links to include a path
from the current document to the linked item (for example, ../../
images/spacer.gif for a link to an image in [site root]/images/
Figure 3-2:
Defining
your site.

Setting Up a Remote Connection
46
from an HTML page in [site root]/aboutus/). Select Site Root if
you want all links relative only to the site’s main directory (for exam-
ple, a link to an image would be /images/spacer.gif, no matter
where the current document resides; the initial slash represents
[site root]).
• HTTP Address: This is the URL of your Web site. Dreamweaver uses
this to verify that links in your site are working properly.
• Case-sensitive Links: Select this check box if you want Dreamweaver
to distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters in links.
• Enable Cache: Selecting this check box speeds up Dreamweaver’s site
management tools and is required for the Assets panel to work. See
your documentation for information about using the Assets panel.
3. Click OK to create the site.
Dreamweaver creates a folder for your Site if it doesn’t exist on your hard
drive, but it doesn’t create the images directory within that folder. Thus, it’s
always a good idea to create your folders on the hard drive first and then
create your Site.
Setting Up a Remote Connection
After you create your Site, it’s a good idea to get connected to the place
where the remote version of your Site (the one users will access via the
World Wide Web) will live. Dreamweaver can connect to a remote server in a
variety of ways. The route you choose depends largely on how you plan to
build and maintain your Site. You have essentially three different scenarios:
✦Creating and testing your Site solely on your own computer: For exam-
ple, this may be the case if you’re building your Site for someone 
else — say, a client. Here the remote server is your computer — not
all that remote!
✦Creating your Site on your computer, but testing it somewhere else:
This is the most common situation. Dreamweaver has three different
delivery options for this scenario: FTP, Remote Development Services
(RDS), and local network connection.
✦Creating and testing your Site on a remote machine: In this case, the
options are the same as in the previous bullet. The only difference is that
when you’re editing, you’re editing files directly on the remote location,
leaving nothing on your local machine.

Book I
Chapter 3
Creating and Using
Dreamweaver Sites
Setting Up a Remote Connection
47
In most cases, your remote location is at an externally hosted Internet serv-
ice provider (ISP). If you have an account set up with an ISP, make sure to get
the following information, which is required for Dreamweaver to set up a
connection to your remote Web server:
✦An IP address or a URL to be used when posting your files (FTP host)
✦A folder on the remote server where you are supposed to keep your site
files (host directory)
✦A username for your account
✦A password for your account
To set up a remote connection, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites to bring up the Manage Sites dialog box,
shown in Figure 3-3.
2. Select your site from the list on the left and then click the Edit button.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, opened to the Advanced tab.
3. From the Category list on the left, select Remote Info.
Along the right side of the dialog box, the Local Info options are replaced
with the Remote Info options. If you haven’t set up a connection previ-
ously, all you see is the Access drop-down list.
4. Select an option from the Access drop-down list.
You can choose from several Access options in this list, including
• FTP: The industry standard, file transfer protocol.
• Local/Network: A location on your local (meaning office, home
office, or your own computer) network.
Figure 3-3:
The

• WebDAV: Stands for Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning.
It’s a standard for version control and is used with Web servers such
as Apache Web Server and Microsoft IIS.
• RDS: ColdFusion’s Remote Development Services allows secure
remote access to files within a ColdFusion application server.
• Microsoft Visual SourceSafe Database: SourceSafe is Microsoft’s 
version control application, which helps prevent the accidental over-
writing of files when you’re collaborating with others to build the
site. With Dreamweaver, you can integrate SourceSafe and use it for
your version control.
5. Fill out the appropriate information for the connection type you
selected.
Leave the source control settings (described in the “Using Source Control”
section, later in this chapter) alone for the moment. The following list
describes the information needed for each connection type:
• FTP: In addition to the four items we note at the beginning of this
section (FTP host, host directory, login (username), and password),
you also need to select the Passive FTP check box if you plan to use
Passive FTP (required for some servers). Select the Use IPv6 transfer
mode box if your remote server is enabled to use the latest version
of IP (Internet Protocol). If there’s a firewall you need to work through,
you can enter the Firewall host and port, as shown in Figure 3-4. Click
OK to save your Preferences and return to the Site Definition window.
Select the Use Secure FTP (SFTP) check box if you want to use
encrypted secure logins. After you’ve added the necessary settings,
you’re able to connect to your ISP.
Leave Maintain Synchronization Information selected to allow
Dreamweaver to track differences between the local and remote
servers.

If you select Automatically Upload Files to Server on Save,
Dreamweaver will automatically make a connection to the remote
server and upload your file each time you save it.
Select the Enable File Check In and Check Out option if you’re work-
ing in a collaborative environment and you want to ensure that other
team members can’t work on a file at the same time that you’re work-
ing on it. If you select this option, you need to add information that
will identify you to your collaborators.
• Local/Network: Here you only need to specify the location of the
remote folder on the network or a local drive, which you can enter
manually or by clicking the folder icon to browse the network for the
folder location. See the bottom three items in the preceding FTP
bullet for information on other Local/Network settings.
• RDS: If you select RDS from the drop-down list, you need to click
the Settings button next to the list to configure the RDS connection,
as shown in Figure 3-5. To configure RDS, you need a host name
(IP address or URL), port number (the default is 80), the directory of
the site on the host, a username, and a password. If you don’t want
the password saved, then deselect the Save check box.
• Microsoft Visual SourceSafe: As with RDS, with SourceSafe you have
to click the Settings button next to the drop-down list. Then you
specify the location of the SourceSafe Database Path (a path to an
.ini file, usually on a network volume), the name of the project, a
username, and a password. If you don’t want the password saved,
deselect the Save check box.
• WebDAV: You need the URL of the connection, a username, a pass-
word, and a checkout name and e-mail address. If you don’t want the
password saved, deselect the Save check box. You also have three
options, one of which is selected by default. See your documentation
for details.
6. Click OK to put the changes into effect.

Using Advanced Site Options
You can configure a number of advanced settings with Dreamweaver.
You’re not likely to need most of them, but just in case, we describe them in
the following sections. You can access all these options by selecting the
name of the item in the Category list of the Site Definition dialog box (refer
to Figure 3-2).
Testing your server
Select Testing Server from the Category list on the Advanced tab of the Site
Definition dialog box to access the options for setting up your testing server.
If you’re building a dynamic site, you need to have a Web server running that
can process the pages and render them as HTML. To specify a Web serving
technology, do the following:
1. Select a Web server from the Server Model drop-down list, as shown
in Figure 3-6.
You have several options here; if you’re working within the old
Macromedia model, your selection is probably going to be ColdFusion.

2. Select an Access type.
You can choose FTP or Local/Network. If you chose RDS on the Remote
Info screen, you see an RDS option here as well. Choosing any of them
provides additional fields for you to fill out, as specified for each Access
type in the “Setting Up a Remote Connection” section, earlier in this
chapter. Choose None if you don’t want to use a testing server.
3. Click OK to save your settings.
Cloaking
Cloaking is a handy and appropriately named feature in Dreamweaver Sites.
When enabled, cloaking allows you to hide different file types or folders from
Dreamweaver’s site tools. This feature can be especially helpful if you keep your
raw asset files (your source Fireworks PNGs, Flash FLAs, and so on) in the same
directory as the site itself, but you don’t want the files uploaded or downloaded,
included in reports, or otherwise touched by various Dreamweaver operations.
To engage this feature, click the Advanced tab of the Site Definition dialog box
and select Cloaking from the Category list on the left. Then select the Enable
Cloaking and Cloak Files Ending With check boxes and add the file extensions
for the file types you want to mask. See the online Help files for more details.
Using Design Notes
Design Notes aren’t really necessary unless you’re collaborating on a site
with other people. In that case, Design Notes can be especially helpful. For
example, you can use Design Notes to let others know the status of a given
file. To engage Design Notes, click the Advanced tab of the Site Definition
dialog box, select Design Notes from the Category list on the left, and then
simply select the Maintain Design Notes check box. If you want to move the
notes to the server when the site is published so that other team members
can access them, select the Upload Design Notes for Sharing check box.
Setting up a site map
If you select Site Map Layout in the Category list in the Site Definition dialog
box, you can set up the specifics of how you’d like your site’s site map to
look. You can specify the following:
✦The home page for the site map, which can be different from the home
page (index.htm) of the site
✦The number and width of the columns of the map
✦The labels for the site map icons
✦Whether to display items marked hidden
✦Whether to display dependent files

Using Advanced Site Options
52
Selecting columns for File view
For the File view, shown in Figure 3-7, you have six built-in columns to
choose from: Name, Notes, Size, Type, Modified, and Checked Out By.
However, you can also add and remove your own columns by clicking the (+)
and (–) buttons, respectively. For a column you create, you can also specify
the following:
✦The column name
✦The column’s Design Note association, if its contents relate to a specific
Design Note
✦The text alignment for the column
✦The option to show or not show the column in the File view 
(Note: The Name column cannot be hidden or moved.)
✦Whether to share the column so that other workers on the site can see it
(Note: You must have Maintain Design Notes selected to share a column.)

53
Enabling Contribute compatibility
To enable compatibility with Contribute, click the Advanced tab of the Site
Definition dialog box and select Contribute from the Category list on the left.
Select the Enable Contribute Compatibility check box if you plan to have
people maintain your site using Contribute. Selecting this option allows you
to perform many administrative functions related to Contribute (for exam-
ple, you can send Connection Keys based on your Dreamweaver Site setups).
Updating templates
When you create a document-relative link in a template file, the link is rela-
tive to the template. By default, when you create a page from the template,
Dreamweaver automatically adjusts the link to have the correct pathname
relative to the created page. To disable that feature, click the Advanced tab
of the Site Definition box and select Templates from the Category list on the
left. Select the Template Updating check box to remove the check.
Storing Spry Assets
The Spry framework, which incorporates JavaScript, CSS, and XML, allows
nonprogrammers to put fancy navigation and animation on Web sites with a
minimum of fuss. Book I, Chapter 7 offers instructions for using Spry to create
a richer user experience on your Web site. When you insert the first Spry
component in your site, Dreamweaver automatically creates a SpryAssets
folder in your root directory, where it places the JavaScript and CSS files.
To use a custom location for Spry Assets, click the Advanced tab of the Site
Definition box and select Spry from the Category list on the left. Enter the
location of your Spry Assets folder by typing or pasting it, or better yet, click
the folder icon at the right to browse to the folder.
Publishing Your Site
After you’ve set up a remote site in a Dreamweaver Site, publishing your Site
is a snap. To publish your Site to a remote server, just follow these steps:
1. If the Files panel isn’t already open, open it by choosing Window➪
Files or by pressing F8.
2. On the File tab, click the Expand/Collapse button (the button on the
far right of the toolbar) to switch to File view.
This brings up the File view shown previously in Figure 3-7.

Publishing Your Site
54
. 3. If you haven’t connected to the remote server since you launched
Dreamweaver most recently, click the Connection button at the left
of the Files panel toolbar to establish a connection with the remote
server.
When you’re connected, you see the File view shown in Figure 3-8.
4. Select a file and click the Put button on the toolbar (an upward point-
ing blue arrow) to copy a file from the local server to the remote
server, or click the Get button (a downward pointing green arrow) to
copy a file from the remote server to the local server.
If you’re copying files for the first time, simply select the Site’s root
folder and click the Put button. To copy files from the Local to Remote
servers, or vice versa, you can also simply click and drag the elements
from local to remote, or vice versa. If you use this method, be careful to
place files in the correct folders.
If you ever want to see what’s going on behind the scenes when you’re copy-
ing those files, just click the FTP button in the toolbar in File view. The Results
panel appears or expands and shows you the remote connections being set
and all the commands for the files being sent (the File view collapses back to
the Files panel as well).

Maintaining Your Site
55
Maintaining Your Site
After your Site is built, you want to make sure that it continues running at
peak efficiency. To help in this effort, Dreamweaver offers some valuable
tools that can help you keep on top of the wide array of items that go into
keeping your Site running smoothly. We describe the two basic types of
tools, reports and link checkers, in detail in the following sections.
Running reports
Reports encapsulate information about various aspects of your Site at the
time the reports are run, giving you a snapshot of information such as which
files on your Site are currently being worked on by different team members,
whether all the images on a selected page have Alt tags, and more. To run a
report in Dreamweaver, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Reports.
The Reports dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-9.
2. Choose what you want to run the report against.
You can choose to run a report on the currently selected document, the
entire site, selected files in the site, or a folder within the site. Select one
of these options from the Report On drop-down list.
3. Select the reports you want to run by selecting the check boxes next
to their names.
You can run nine possible reports across two categories: Workflow and
HTML Reports. The nine reports are as follows:
Figure 3-9:
The Reports
dialog box,
with some
options
selected.

Maintaining Your Site
56
• Checked Out By: This report tells you what files in source control
are currently being used by different members of the team. If you
want the report to show only which files are currently checked out
by a particular team member, click the Report Settings button at the
bottom of the dialog box while the report is selected and add an indi-
vidual’s name to the text field in the Checked Out By dialog box that
pops up.
• Design Notes: This report prints all the Design Notes associated with
files on the site. To filter your results via the Design Notes dialog box,
click the Report Settings button while the Design Notes report is
selected.
• Recently Modified: This report shows which files have been modi-
fied within parameters you set by clicking the Report Settings button
and specifying the parameters in the Recently Modified dialog box
that pops up.
• Combinable Nested Font Tags: This report details locations in the
code where overlapping Font tags could be merged. For example, if
you change the size of a block of text, your code might contain some-
thing like this:
<FONT face=”Arial”><FONT size=”2”>Some
text.</FONT></FONT>
When it could and should be
<FONT face=”Arial” size=”2”>Some text.</FONT>
• Accessibility: If you run this report, the site files are scanned to find

4. Click Run to run the reports.
The results appear in the Site Reports tab of the Results panel, as shown
in Figure 3-10.
Checking links
In addition to the reports that help clean up your code, Dreamweaver can
also check the links on your site. To run the Link Check report, choose
Site➪Check Links Sitewide or press Ctrl+F8. You see the results in the Link
Checker tab in the Results panel. The report shows broken links, external
links, and orphaned files.
Using Source Control
Source control allows team members to check out a document in your site,
thereby locking it and making it uneditable by others until the team member
who checked it out checks it back in again. This process is intended to
ensure that files don’t get overwritten accidentally and that data doesn’t
get lost during the development process.
In most large-scale software development projects, in which multitudes of
people work on a single code-base, source control is critical. If your site
requires that more than three people work on the same pages and code, you
should consider taking advantage of this feature in Dreamweaver.
To set up source control, do the following:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites, select your site, and then click the Edit
button to open the Site Definition dialog box.
2. Click the Advanced tab if it’s not already open and select Remote Info
from the Category list on the left.
Figure 3-10:

3. Set your source control options at the bottom of the screen.
When you enable file check in and check out, the following options
become available:
• Check out files automatically when you open a document within
the site.
• Provide your name and e-mail address for site reporting and informa-
tional purposes.
You must have selected an Access option on the Remote Info screen
before you can get the file check in and check out options to show up at
the bottom of the page. See the “Setting Up a Remote Connection” section,
earlier in this chapter, for more information about Access options.
4. Click OK to save your settings.
To work with a file after you’ve enabled source control, right-click the file
from the Files panel and select one of the following options:
✦Get: Retrieves the most recent version of the file and copies it locally.
✦Check Out: Makes your local version the only editable version of a docu-
ment and ensures that others can’t open and save the file.
✦Put: Copies the local version of your file to the remote location.
✦Check In: Puts your local version of the file on the server and unlocks it
so that others can check it out and work on it, if necessary.

Chapter 4: Punching Up Your
Pages with Forms and Frames
In This Chapter
 Incorporating forms into your Web pages
 Structuring your pages with frames
T
wo Web page features, forms and frames, are also two of the most
advanced features. You use them in your Web pages to serve the follow-
ing functions:
✦Forms: Enable you to gather information and feedback from the users
who visit your Web pages. Forms can consist of text fields, buttons,
check boxes, radio buttons, and drop-down lists, all of which enable the
user to enter information or to choose among options you present.
✦Frames: Enable you to construct sophisticated navigational schemes for
your Web site. Frames are actually separate Web pages that are parti-
tioned off so that two or more can be displayed in the same browser
window at the same time. For example, one frame may be a navigational
page consisting of a list of links to other pages; that frame remains in
place in its portion of the browser window even when the user clicks a
link to display a different Web page in the other frame.
In this chapter, you see how to work with these powerful features in
Dreamweaver CS3.
Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
Forms on the Web serve the same purpose as the paper-based forms you fill
out — they provide a structured format for gathering specific information.
The difference is that Web-based forms usually require less time for keyboard-
savvy users to fill out.
Dreamweaver offers you a number of handy tools for creating Web-based
forms that you can easily include on your Web pages. You can incorporate
everything from text fields to radio buttons, and create surveys, gather user
data, and conduct e-commerce.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
60
Creating Web-based forms requires the following two steps:
1. Creating the form that users see and interact with, which we demon-
strate how to do using Dreamweaver in this chapter.
2. Creating the processing program that accepts and processes form input,
which is beyond the scope of this book.
Adding a form
Before you can insert specific form objects such as check boxes on your
Web page, you must first add a form to the page so that the appropriate
code is added to the HTML.
To add a form to a page, click in the Document window where you want to
add the form and choose Insert➪Form➪Form, or click the Form button from
the Forms category on the Insert bar. (If the Insert bar is set to a different
category, click and hold the category name and select Common from the
drop-down list.)
Dreamweaver adds the form to the page, as indicated by the red dashed
lines, and adds the associated form tag to your HTML page code, as shown
in Figure 4-1. You can now insert form objects inside the red dashed lines of
the form.
Figure 4-1:
The dashed
lines mean
that you’ve
created a
form!

Book I
Chapter 4
Punching Up Your
Pages with Forms
and Frames
Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
61
If you attempt to add a form object without first adding a form, a dialog box
appears, asking whether you want to add a form tag. Click Yes to add both
the form tag and the object to your page.
Dreamweaver’s new Spry functionality includes form-specific widgets that
perform tasks such as text field validation. See Book I, Chapter 7 for more
details.
Specifying form properties
A form has six properties that you can set using the Form Property inspec-
tor: Form Name, Action, Method, Enctype, Target, and Class. Click the form
to open the Form Property inspector. (If the Property inspector does not
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.) Then specify the follow-
ing properties:
✦Form Name: Enter an alphanumeric name in the empty text field (the
name should start with a letter, but it can be made up of both letters and
numbers). The advantage of naming your form is that you can use the
name to reference the form in a scripting language that you use to
retrieve, store, and manipulate the form data.
✦Action: Enter the URL of the application document or file that processes
the form data. Alternatively, you can browse to the location by clicking
the folder and making a selection in the Select File dialog box.
You can select the following three common actions:
• Enter the URL of a ColdFusion page that evaluates the form after it
has been submitted.
• Enter the JavaScript program that runs after the user submits the
form. The action appears as follows:
javascript:function()
Here, function refers to the name of your form-handling function.
• Enter a mailto: address where the form data goes after the user
clicks the Submit button. A mailto: address appears similar to the 
following:
mailto:worker@formhandling.com
✦Method: Select a method from the drop-down list for how the form data
passes to the processing entity that you specified in the Action field.
Choices are Default, GET, and POST. (Default and GET are the same.) GET
sends the form data by appending it to the URL that Action specifies.
POST sends the form data as a separate entity. GET limits the amount of
data that can pass along, but POST does not.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
62
In other words, if you were to choose GET, the URL sent to the
server might look something like http://www.server.com/
coldfusionpage.cfm&bowlingballcolor=blue, with the form
data stuck onto the end. If you were to choose POST instead, the
URL would just look something like http://www.server.com/
coldfusionpage.cfm.
Most of the time, whether you choose GET or POST doesn’t really make
a difference. However, there are times when you may want to choose
one over the other. For example, for security purposes, you may not
want information, such as a credit card number, ever being shown in a
browser’s history. And if the user might choose to bookmark the URL,
whether to have all the form data appear could affect your decision.
If the form data included secure user information (such as the credit
card example), then you probably wouldn’t want to have the form
data appear. However, if the form data includes search criteria, the
user might want to bookmark the URL complete with the search 
parameters.
Data received at the specified mailto: address is not formatted for easy
reading: It appears as strings of code with the form data embedded
within it. This may depend on the encoding option, which we are about
to discuss.
✦Enctype: This is an optional attribute. For enctype, your choices are
application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data.
The first one, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, replaces all
blank characters in the text with a plus sign (+), and it replaces other
nonprinting characters with symbols and numbers. These replacements
are often necessary for the server to interpret the information it is
receiving — for example, when you’ve used the GET method, the
browser would not be able to process a URL with blank spaces in it.
The multipart/form-data attribute does not do this conversion but
instead transfers the information as a compound MIME document. The
multipart/form-data attribute is the method that must be used if you
are using an <INPUT TYPE=”file”> element in the form. Alternatively,
if the form action is mailto:, you can input text/plain, which will
send the data unencoded; however, this is not a W3C standard.
✦Target: This is also an optional attribute. If you do not specify a target,
the server will assume that you want any information that is sent back
to the browser (the URL of the response page, for example) sent to the
same window or frame that your original form is in. If you wish the form
submission’s results to appear in a different frame or window, you must
specify the name of the target window in this attribute.
✦Class: You can apply a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) class to the form as a
whole and to some form elements in order to control how those form

Book I

elements appear in a browser. For example, you can specify the color
of a text field by assigning it a style. This attribute is also optional.
For details on using CSS stylesheets, take a look at CSS Web Design For
Dummies, by Richard Mansfield (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Labeling form objects
Dreamweaver enables you to provide descriptors for form objects and provide
the user with directions about how to complete the information requested
for each option. To add descriptors to form objects, simply position your
cursor in the form and begin typing. Then insert the form object you want.
Using text fields
Text fields are blank text boxes that you can insert in your form to hold
alphanumeric information that the user types. You can set up a text field to
hold a single line of text, multiple lines of text, or a password, as follows:
✦Single line: Provides space for the user to enter a single word or short
phrase of text.
✦Multi-line: Provides space for the user to enter a longer string of text.
Appropriate for a comment box.
✦Password: Provides space for the user to enter a password. An asterisk
or other placeholder appears in the text field for each character that the
user types to hide the password characters from anyone who might be
looking over the user’s shoulder.
To add a text field, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, click where you want to add the text field
and choose Insert➪Form➪Text Field, or click the Insert Text Field
button on the Form category of the Insert bar.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click Form.
The Input Tag Accessibility Attributes window appears, unless you have
set your preferences otherwise.
2. Enter Accessibility information as desired and click OK.
This information is not required, but including it makes your form
easier to navigate for sight-impaired users. See your Dreamweaver 
documentation for details.
Dreamweaver adds a text field to your form and a Text Field Property
inspector appears. If the Text Field Property inspector does not appear,
choose Window➪Properties to open the inspector.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
64
3. Fill in the following fields of the Text Field Property inspector to
define the parameters of the text field:
• TextField name: Enter a name in the empty field. The field is refer-
enced by this name in the HTML page code.
• Char Width: Enter a whole number for the approximate visible
width of the field. (The width is approximate because text characters
in your form are displayed differently according to users’ browser
settings.)
• Max Chars: (Applies to Single line and Password fields only) Enter a
whole number to indicate the maximum number of characters that
the user can enter in the field. Max Chars can be different from Char
Width.
• Num Lines: (Applies to Multi-line fields only) This specifies the height,
in lines, of the form element, and may be affected by the setting for
Wrap.
• Type: Select a radio button for Single line, Multi-line, or Password.
When you select Password, Dreamweaver includes code that makes
an asterisk appear for each character the user enters.
• Init Val: (Optional) Enter an alphanumeric word or phrase that occu-
pies the text field when the user first encounters the field. Users can
enter their own information over the Init Val. If you leave this attrib-
ute blank, the user will see a standard empty text field.
• Wrap: (Applies to Multi-line fields only) Select an option for text
wrapping from the drop-down list. Options consist of Default, Off,
Virtual, or Physical. Default and Off are the same and do not wrap
text until the user presses the Enter key. The Virtual option wraps
text on the user’s screen but not when the form is submitted. The
Physical option wraps text both on the user’s screen and when the
form is submitted.
• Class: (Optional) You may assign a CSS class to a text field to affect
the appearance of the field or the text within it. For details on using
CSS style sheets, look up CSS Web Design For Dummies, by Richard
Mansfield (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Setting up buttons
After a user enters data into a form, the user must then perform some sort of
task to transmit the data from his or her computer to another computer that

Book I
Chapter 4

Pages with Forms
and Frames
Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
65
can process the information. Dreamweaver offers you three buttons you can
use to activate your form: Submit Form, Reset Form, and None:
✦Submit Form: After the user clicks this button, the form data scoots off
to another computer based on the specified action. (You see how to set
the action of a form in the “Specifying form properties” section, earlier in
this chapter.)
✦Reset Form: After the user clicks this button, it erases all data entered
into the form, resetting each form field to its initial value.
✦None: After the user clicks this button, it executes the programming
function that the Web designer assigned to it (for example, performs a
mathematical calculation or sends the user to a different URL).
Follow these steps to insert a button into your form:
1. Click where you want to add the button in the Document window and
choose Insert➪Form➪Button or click Insert Button on the Form cate-
gory of the Insert bar.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click Forms.
Dreamweaver adds a button to your form and the Button Property
inspector becomes visible. If the Button Property inspector does not
appear, choose Window➪Properties to open the inspector.
2. Fill in the following fields of the Button Property inspector to define
the parameters of the button:
• Button Name: Enter a name in the empty text field. This name identi-
fies the button in the HTML code.
• Label: Enter the text that you want to appear on the button.
• Action: Select a radio button to indicate the function of the button.
Choices consist of Submit Form, Reset Form, and None.
• Class: (Optional) You can assign a CSS style to affect the button’s
appearance (color, width, and the like).
You can create a graphical Submit button — a button created from a small
image — by choosing Insert➪Form➪Image Field or by clicking the Image
Field button in the Form category of the Insert bar. Then browse to the
image file in your site or type the path to and name of the image file directly
into the File Name field.

Incorporating Forms into Web Pages
66
Adding other form elements
In addition to the text fields and buttons, you can add a variety of form ele-
ments that help your users give you information. Figure 4-2 shows some
of the useful form elements you can add to your forms. To insert any of the
elements you see in Figure 4-2, follow these steps:
1. Position your cursor in the area of the Document window where you
want to add the element.
2. Click the appropriate button in the Form category of the Insert bar
(see Figure 4-2) or choose Insert➪Form Objects➪Desired Form Element.
If the Insert bar is set to a different category, click Forms.
3. If the Input Tag Accessibility Attributes window appears, enter
Accessibility information as desired and click OK.
This information is not required, but including it makes your form
easier to navigate for sight-impaired users. See your Dreamweaver 
documentation for details.
Dreamweaver adds the element to your form and the appropriate
inspector appears. (If the appropriate inspector does not appear, open it
by choosing Windows➪Properties.) Note: You must save your document
before inserting a Spry widget.
4. Fill in the fields of the Property inspector.
If you’re adding a radio button group, jump menu, or image, a dialog box
will pop up and ask you for additional information. Fill in your choices
for each of these.
5. Click OK to apply your selections and close the dialog box.

Structuring Pages with Frames
Frames are divisions of a Web page that enable you to load information inde-
pendently into distinct regions of the browser window. Frames are useful if
you want to display certain information on-screen while changing other
information. You frequently see three-frame pages on the Web — the top
frame shows the site’s title graphic, the left frame shows the navigation bar,
and the large body frame changes to show the content that you select.
A special HTML page called a frameset defines the structure and formatting
of frames on your Web page. As you work with frames, be aware that you
must always save the frameset page to lay out the size, position, and borders
of your frames, along with the content that you want to display in each
frame. Keep in mind that different browsers may draw the frames slightly dif-
ferently, even if you specify exact pixel dimensions.
You can create a frameset two ways in Dreamweaver:
✦From scratch
✦By adding a frame to an existing document
We detail each in the following sections.
Creating a frameset from scratch
When you create a frameset from scratch, you create the frameset and all
the frames it describes in one fell swoop. To create a frameset using one of
Dreamweaver’s built-in templates, just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N.
The New Document window appears.
2. Click Page from Sample on the left.
The Sample Folder, Sample Page, and preview panes are updated.
3. Click Frameset in the Sample Folder area.
The Sample Page pane and preview areas are updated.
4. Click a Sample page.
The preview area shows you what the frameset will look like, as shown
in Figure 4-3.
5. Click Create.
The New Document window closes and the Frame Tag Accessibility
Attributes window appears. The document window displays the new
frameset.

Structuring Pages with Frames
68
6. Select a frame from the Frame drop-down menu and type or paste a
name in the Title field. Repeat until you’ve entered titles for all your
frames and click OK.
This step is optional. Adding titles to your frames makes them easier to
navigate for sight-impaired users. Dreamweaver automatically gives the
frames generic titles. If you don’t want to enter custom titles, simply
click OK. The Frame Tag Accessibility Attributes window disappears 
and your document window displays the frameset.
Adding frames
You can add a frame to a frameless Document window or to an existing
frame within the Document window. Adding a frame to an existing frame
divides that frame into two or more regions.
To add a frame, click the Document window or existing frame in the area
where you want to add the frame. Then click the Frames button in the Form
category of the Insert bar and choose from the list of options that pops up.
You can also get to an equivalent list (the same options, some with slightly
different names and no icons) by choosing Insert➪HTML➪Frames➪
Frame Option, where Frame Option is one of the choices detailed in Table 4-1.

A third method of adding a frame is to drag the outer border of the current
frame or Alt+click (Opt+click on a Mac) in the inner border. You can then
follow the steps in the next section to modify this new frame.
Modifying frames
You use the Frame Property inspector to select the source page that appears
in a frame. You also use the Frame Property inspector to format the appear-
ance of an individual frame. To modify a frame, follow these steps:
1. If the Properties panel is not already open, open it by choosing
Window➪Properties or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+F3.
2. In the Frames panel, Alt+click (Opt+click on a Mac) the frame whose
attributes you want to modify.
Note: You can’t simply click a frame to open its associated Frame Property
inspector. If you click a frame, you’re actually clicking the source page
that resides in the frame — a process identical to clicking in the Document
window for that page. To select a specific frame, press the Alt key and click
in the frame. You see the Frame Property inspector for an individual frame
and the selected frame marked with a dashed line, as shown in Figure 4-4.
A Frame Property inspector appears for the selected frame. If the inspec-
tor doesn’t appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.

Structuring Pages with Frames
70
3. In the Frame Property inspector or the Attributes tab of the Tag
Inspector panel, enter a name for your frame in the Frame Name
text field.
This name is the name by which the frame is referenced in the Frames
panel, target drop-down lists, and the HTML page code.
The frame name must start with a letter, and you should not use hyphens,
spaces, or periods. You should also avoid using JavaScript-reserved
names, such as top. Although these words and symbols may be accepted,
if you are using any scripting (JavaScript, VBScript) to manipulate your
frames, the results may be inconsistent or wrong. It’s a good idea to get
into the habit of avoiding these words and characters. Word separation
can be indicated by capitalization, and underscore characters can also
be used.
4. In the Src text field, enter the name of the source page whose content
you intend to display in the frame.
Alternatively, you can click the Src folder and browse to select the
source page.

5. Select a scrolling option for your selected frame from the Scroll drop-
down list. The options are as follows:
• Yes: Adds scrollbars to the frame, whether they’re needed or not.
• No: Doesn’t add scrollbars to the frame, even if a scrollbar is needed
to display the entire frame.
• Auto: Places one or more scrollbars in the frame if the frame con-
tents exceed the frame boundaries.
• Default: Places one or more scrollbars in the frame, depending on
the user’s browser settings.
6. Select the No Resize check box if you don’t want the user to be able to
resize the frame.
If you do want the user to be able to resize the frame, leave the check
box deselected.
7. Format the frame border appearance by selecting a choice from the
Borders drop-down list:
• Yes: Creates a three-dimensional look for the borders. (This doesn’t
work in all browsers.)
• No: Creates a single-color flat look for the borders, or, if No is
selected for each of the frames in a frameset, no border appears.
• Default: Enables the user’s browser to set how borders appear.
8. Select a border color for the frame by clicking the Border Color
swatch and selecting a color from the Color palette that appears.
Alternatively, you can enter a hexadecimal color code in the Border
Color text field. This doesn’t work in all browsers and is optional. If your
frames don’t have borders, the border color will not apply.
9. Enter a number in pixels in the Margin Width and the Margin Height
text fields.
Margin Width specifies the horizontal standoff space between the frame
content and the frame border. Margin Height specifies the vertical standoff
space between the frame content and the frame border. This is in addition
to any values that the page called into the frame already has assigned.
Deleting frames
To delete a frame, select the frame border and drag it to the edge of the
parent frame or to the edge of the Document window — whichever is closer.
If you only have two frames on the page, this action will result in a frameset
with only one page in it.

Structuring Pages with Frames
72
Saving frames
Saving a frame means that you’re saving the HTML page from which the
source content of the frame originates. To save a frame, follow these steps:
1. Select the frame by clicking in it.
2. Choose File➪Save Frame.
3. The first time you save the frame, enter a name in the File Name text
field of the Save As dialog box that appears and then click the Save
button.
Future saves require that you complete only Steps 1 and 2.
Saving framesets
Saving a frameset means saving the layout of frame positions, frame names,
and border formatting on a page. Keep in mind that you must save individual
frames to save the content contained in those frames. To save a frameset,
follow these steps:
1. Select the frameset by clicking one of its borders.
2. Choose File➪Save Frameset.
Note: This will not work if the frameset is nested.
3. The first time you save the frameset, enter a name in the File Name
text field of the Save As dialog box that appears and then click Save.
Future saves require that you complete only Steps 1 and 2.
If you have made changes to individual frames — not just the frameset —
since your last save, Dreamweaver asks whether you want to save individual
frames. Make sure that you do so.
Setting no-frames content
Text-based browsers and many older browsers frequently don’t support
frames and can’t correctly display pages that you create by using frames.
To help ensure that the maximum number of users can view your page cor-
rectly, Dreamweaver offers you a method for building no-frames pages as
companions to your frame-enabled pages. To create a no-frames page for
your current frameset, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Frameset➪Edit NoFrames Content.
A blank, NoFrames Content page appears in the Document window and
replaces your frame-enabled page, as shown in Figure 4-5.

Book I
Chapter 4
Punching Up Your
Pages with Forms
and Frames
Structuring Pages with Frames
73
2. On the NoFrames Content page, insert the content that you want to
appear in NoFrames browsers.
This content can include text, images, and other page elements.
3. Return to your frame-enabled page by choosing Modify➪Frameset➪
Edit NoFrames Content.
Targeting content
You can set up a two-frame frameset in which you use the left frame for navi-
gation and the main frame to display any link that the user clicks in the navi-
gation frame. Simply set up the link to target the main frame as the location
where you want the selected HTML page to open.
Set up a target by following these steps:
1. Select the text or image that you want to act as a link.
Doing so opens the associated Property inspector. If the inspector doesn’t
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
2. In the Link field, enter the name of the HTML source page that will
appear in the frame.
Alternatively, you can click the Link folder and browse to select the
source page.
Figure 4-5:

3. From the Target drop-down list, select the target frame where the link
is to appear.
All available targets are listed in the drop-down list, as shown in Figure 4-6.
These targets include the names of all frames that you set up and also
the following systemwide targets:
• _blank: Opens a new browser window and shows the link in that
window. The current window remains open.
• _parent: Opens the link in a window that replaces the frameset 
containing the current page.
• _self: Opens the link in the current frame. The linked page replaces
the page in the current frame. If you want the link to open in the cur-
rent frame, you can select _self or leave the Target area in the
Property inspector empty.
• _top: Opens the link in a window that replaces the outermost frame-
set of the current page. (Same as _parent, unless you’re using
nested framesets.)

Targeting can work in more complicated framesets using the same basic
process. Whichever frame you target is the one that will update when the
user clicks a link targeting that frame.
Adding IFrames
An IFrame allows you to embed one HTML page in another HTML page with-
out having to create a frameset (the I in IFrame stands for inline). To insert
an IFrame into an HTML page, follow these simple steps:
1. Click in your document where you want the IFrame to go.
2. Click Layout in the Insert bar if Layout is not already selected.
3. Click the IFrame button.
The Document window shows that the IFrame has been inserted, as
shown in Figure 4-7.
Any content you enter inside the IFrame tags functions as alternative
content for users whose browsers don’t support IFrames.

4. Right-click inside the <iframe> tag and select Edit Tag from the menu
that appears.
The Tag Editor window appears, open to the General area.
5. Enter a filename or click Browse to navigate to the Source file (the
HTML page or other content that will appear inside the IFrame).
The only required field is Source, because that field determines what
goes in the IFrame; the rest of the settings control how the IFrame looks
and functions.
6. Enter other settings as necessary and click OK.
The Tag Editor disappears, and the document window is updated. To see
your IFrame in action, choose File➪Preview in Browser➪Browser Name
or use the keyboard shortcut F12 (PC only).

T
o lay out the content of your Web page precisely, you can use tables (see
Book I, Chapter 2), or you can use the latest and greatest layout aid: AP
Divs. You can think of AP Divs in Dreamweaver as separate pieces of transpar-
ent paper that you fill with content (images, text, and so on) and shuffle, stack,
position, and overlap until your Web page looks exactly the way you want.
Dreamweaver AP Divs use a now common companion to HTML called
Cascading Style Sheets Positioning (CSS-P) in order to place your content
anywhere on the screen. However, you should be aware that Cascading Style
Sheets are supported inconsistently across browsers (what looks perfect in
Internet Explorer 7 might not look the same in Safari or Firefox). For more
information about Cascading Style Sheets, check out CSS Web Design For
Dummies, by Richard Mansfield (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
One of the chief advantages of CSS-P is that you can use it to place elements in
Absolute Positions (the AP in AP Elements) on your Web page without using
tables. You can make any page element (an image or a block of text, for exam-
ple) into an AP Element in Dreamweaver by giving it an absolute position.
Distinguishing divs from AP Divs
If you have any familiarity with CSS, you might also know Divs by the name
they used to be called in Dreamweaver: AP Divs. Most commonly, when you
add an AP Element to a page, you’re adding an AP Div. Much of the information
in this chapter about AP Divs may be applied to regular divs as well
(naming, nesting, and AP Diving, for example). We use the generic term div
when the information applies to both kinds of divs.

Tracing a Design
78
You can add a regular old div to a page with a click of a button, but we
focus here on AP Divs because they’re easier for a beginner to work with.
Why’s that? Because, unlike regular divs, you can draw AP Divs right on your
document, saving yourself the trouble of sizing and positioning the div after
adding it to your page.
Before you begin working with AP Divs, you may find it useful to have the
Insert panel open to the Layout category (click Layout in the Insert panel
to make it active) and the document in Design view (click Design in the
Document window). To open the AP Elements panel, if it’s not already open,
press F2 or choose Window➪AP Elements. When you have several AP Divs in
your document, the AP Elements panel may come in handy.
Tracing a Design
If you’re using AP Divs to reproduce a page designed in Fireworks, Photoshop,
or Illustrator, you can take advantage of the tracing feature in Dreamweaver.
It works just like putting a piece of tracing paper on top of a photograph and
tracing the image (in that analogy, the tracing image is the photograph, on
top of which you’ll “trace” your AP Divs).
To trace a page design, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Tracing Image➪Load.
The Select Image Source window appears.
2. Navigate to the file and click the filename.
The tracing image can be a PNG, PSD, GIF, or JPEG file.
3. Click OK.
The Page Properties window appears, open to the Tracing Image category.
If the tracing image is not in your site root folder, you may see a window
asking if you want to copy the image to the site root folder. You don’t
need to do so, but you may. We usually click No.
4. Drag the Transparency Slider as needed.
If you drag it all the way to the left, your tracing image will be invisible —
not very useful as a tracing image. If you drag it all the way to the right
(the default setting), your tracing image will be totally opaque.
5. Click OK.
The tracing image appears in the Document window, allowing you to
“draw” your AP Divs directly on top of it. Note that the tracing image is
not a background image — it won’t appear in a browser.

Book I

AP Elements
Adding an AP Div
79
You can go back and adjust the transparency of the tracing image at any time
by choosing Modify➪Page Properties and clicking Tracing Image on the left
of the window that appears.
Setting AP Element Preferences
To choose different default settings for when you add an AP Element to a
page, choose Edit➪Preferences; the Preferences dialog box appears. Click
the AP Elements Category on the left to view the AP Element default settings
that you can change, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Adding an AP Div
You can add an AP Div to the workspace of your Document window, shown
through the drawing method in Figure 5-2, using one of the following two
methods:
✦Choose Insert➪Layout ➪Objects➪AP Div. If nothing is on the page
already, as in this case, a new AP Div appears in the upper-left corner of
your Document window.
✦Click the Draw AP Div button (just to the right of the Insert Div Tag
button) on the Layout category of the Insert bar. (If the Insert bar is
not set to the Layout category, click Layout.) Position the cross-hair
cursor anywhere in your Document window and click and drag until the
AP Div obtains the dimensions you want. Release the mouse button.
Figure 5-1:
Setting your
default
preferences
for AP
Elements.

Selecting an AP Div
80
If you set an AP Div’s visibility to Hidden, it may be invisible in the Document
window. To see it, simply click the name of the AP Div in the AP Elements
tab of the CSS panel. Now you can see the AP Div, even though its visibility
remains set to Hidden. See the “Changing the visibility of an AP Div” section,
later in this chapter, for details on Visibility settings.
Selecting an AP Div
Selecting an AP Div enables you to identify which AP Div you want to affect
when executing an AP Div operation, such as moving or naming the AP Div.
Use either of the following methods to select an AP Div:
✦In the Document window, click on the boundary of the AP Div. Before
you select the AP Div, your cursor will turn into a four-pointed arrow
(PC) or Grabber hand (Mac) when you place it over an AP Div boundary;
the cursor becomes a white arrow (PC) when you place it over a Div
boundary.
✦In the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel, click the name of the AP Div.
Figure 5-2:
Drawing an
AP Div.

81
The boundary becomes a thick blue line when the AP Div is selected. Also,
selection handles appear on the boundary of the AP Div to indicate that you
have selected it. The cursor becomes a double-sided arrow when you roll
over a selection handle.
Deleting an AP Div
Deleting an AP Div removes the AP Div, the AP Div’s contents, and the AP Div
marker from the Document window. To delete an AP Div, select the AP Div
and press the Del or Backspace key.
Don’t delete an AP Div if you want to remove it from one page and add it to
another. Instead, cut the AP Div by choosing Edit➪Cut or by pressing Ctrl+X.
Open the page where you want to add the AP Div and choose Edit➪Paste or
press Ctrl+V.
Placing Objects in an AP Div
To add an object to an AP Div, click inside the AP Div and follow the normal
procedure for adding the object. For instance, add text to an AP Div by click-
ing inside the AP Div and typing text; add other objects to an AP Div by click-
ing inside the AP Div and choosing Insert➪Object, where Object is the name
of the item you want to add to the AP Div.
Changing AP Div Properties
You can change lots of properties of AP Divs, including
✦Background: You can add a background image or color to an AP Div.
✦Name: Naming an AP Div can help you keep track of objects on a com-
plex page, and is necessary if you want to apply behaviors to the AP Div.
✦Alignment: You can align AP Divs with each other.
✦Visibility: AP Divs (and the objects on them) can be visible or invisible.
✦Position: AP Divs can be nested inside other AP Divs; they can also be
stacked in different orders.
✦Size: You can change the AP Div’s height and width.
✦Location: You can move an AP Div to any location on a page.

Changing AP Div Properties
82
We show you how to edit each of these AP Div properties in the following
sections.
Including a background image or color in an AP Div
By default, an unnested AP Div does not have a color or background image
and will just display what lies beneath it as if it were transparent. (A nested
child AP Div, if it’s empty, will show the color or background image of its
parent. For more about nested AP Divs, see the “Nesting AP Divs” section,
later in this chapter.)
You can change the background of any AP Div by adding a background image
or color as follows:
1. Select the AP Div whose background you want to change by clicking
the AP Div’s border on the document or clicking the AP Div name in
the AP Elements panel.
If the CSS-P Element Property inspector does not appear, open it by
choosing Window➪Properties.
2. In the CSS-P Element Property inspector, change one of the following:
• Bg Image: Click the folder to the right of the text field and browse to
select a background image from the Select Image Source dialog box
that appears. Click the Select button to accept your image choice
and close the dialog box. The path to and name of the background
image appear in the Bg Image field and the image is added to the
background of the AP Div. Figure 5-3 shows an AP Div with a back-
ground image.
If the image is smaller than the AP Div, the image will tile to fill the AP
Div; if the image is larger than the AP Div, the image will be cropped
to fit within the AP Div.
• Bg Color: Click the color box (the little gray box with an arrow on it)
and select a color from the color palette that appears. Alternatively,
you can enter a hexadecimal number for a color in the Bg Color field.
The new color appears in the background of the selected AP Div (as
long as there isn’t a background image in the AP Div already).
Naming an AP Element
The first AP Div you add to a page is automatically named AP Div1, the
second AP Div you add is named AP Div2, and so on. You can change these
default number names to other names that help you more easily distinguish
AP Divs when working with HTML and examining AP Divs with the CSS-P
Element Property inspector or AP Elements tab of the CSS panel.

To name an AP Element using the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel, follow
these steps:
1. If the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel is not already visible, choose
Window➪AP Elements or press F2.
2. Double-click the Name column for the AP Element whose name you
want to change.
The current name is selected.
3. Enter a new name for the AP Element.
Remember that AP Element names can contain only letters and numbers
and must start with a letter.
You can also name an AP Element by double-clicking its name in the CSS-P
Element Property inspector and entering a new name. The name updates
automatically in the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel.
Get in the habit of appropriately naming your AP Divs as soon as you create
them. The name BlueprintImageMap helps you remember an AP Div’s content
much better than APDiv15.

Aligning AP Elements
Aligning AP Elements with each other can help you precisely lay out visual
content in the Document window. You can align the top, left, right, or bottom
sides of AP Elements.
To align AP Elements, select the AP Elements you want to align by pressing
and holding the Shift key and then clicking each AP Element in the Document
window. Choose Modify➪Arrange and choose one of the following options
from the submenu:
✦Align Left: Assigns the x-coordinate of the last selected AP Element to
all selected AP Elements.
✦Align Right: Aligns the right side of all selected AP Elements with the
right side of the last selected AP Element.
✦Align Top: Assigns the y-coordinate of the last selected AP Element to
all selected AP Elements.
✦Align Bottom: Aligns the bottom of all selected AP Elements with the
bottom of the last selected AP Element.
✦Make Same Width: Gives all the AP Elements the same width as the last
selected AP Element.
✦Make Same Height: Gives all the AP Elements the same height as the
last selected AP Element.
Changing the visibility of an AP Div
You can specify whether an AP Div is visible or hidden when a Web page
loads — first appears in the user’s browser window — and as a result of spe-
cific actions by the user. Visibility can change as many times as you want.
Visibility options consist of the following:
✦Default: The AP Div’s initial visibility is the default setting, which is 
visible.
✦Inherit: For a nested AP Div, the AP Div’s initial visibility is the same as
the visibility of its parent. For an unnested AP Div, selecting the Inherit
option causes the AP Div to appear as visible.
✦Visible: The AP Div’s initial visibility setting is Visible.
✦Hidden: The AP Div’s initial visibility is Hidden.
You can use the CSS-P Element Property inspector or the AP Elements tab of
the CSS panel to set AP Div visibility. By setting AP Div visibility, you can
create scripts that cause images to appear (or disappear) in response to

85
user interaction. For example, you can create an image of a gizmo that
appears on a Web page after a user clicks a link marked Click Here to See
Our Top-of-the-Line Gizmo!
To set the initial visibility of an AP Div via the CSS-P Element Property
inspector, select the AP Div in the Document window to open the CSS-P
Element Property inspector. If the inspector does not appear, open it by
choosing Window➪Properties. Choose a visibility option from the Vis drop-
down list.
AP Divving AP Divs: Setting the z-index
The z-index of an AP Div indicates the AP Div’s position in a stack of multiple
AP Divs. Z-indices are useful when you have a handful of AP Divs — some
containing transparent portions, some of different sizes — stacked one on
top of the other. Changing the z-index of your AP Div lets you “shuffle” the
AP Divs — much as you shuffle a deck of cards — to create interesting visual
effects.
Z-indices are measured in whole numbers and do not have to be consecutive —
for instance, you can have three AP Divs with z-indices of 1, 3, and 7, respec-
tively. The AP Div with the largest z-index sits on top of the AP Div stack and
the AP Div with the smallest z-index sits on the bottom of the AP Div stack.
AP Divs with larger z-indices obscure those with smaller z-indices. You can
change the z-index of an AP Div in either the CSS-P Element Property inspec-
tor or the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel.
To assign the z-index of an AP Div by using the CSS-P Element Property
inspector, follow these steps:
1. Select the AP Div to open the CSS-P Element Property inspector.
If the CSS-P Element Property inspector does not appear, open it by
choosing Window➪Properties.
2. Enter a new number in the Z-Index field of the CSS-P Element
Property inspector.
To assign the z-index of an AP Element using the AP Elements tab of the CSS
panel, follow these steps:
1. If the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel is not already visible, choose
Window➪AP Elements or press F2.
2. Click the Z column for the AP Div whose z-index you want to change.
The current z-index is selected.

Changing AP Div Properties
86
3. Enter a new z-index for the AP Div.
The new number appears in the Z column for the selected AP Div, as
shown in Figure 5-4.
4. Click anywhere outside the Z column or press the Enter key.
Note that you can have multiple AP Divs at the same z-index.
To assign relative z-indices to AP Divs by reordering Divs in the AP Divs tab
of the CSS panel, follow these steps:
1. Open the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel by choosing Window➪
AP Elements or by using the keyboard shortcut F2.
The AP Elements tab lists AP Elements in order of descending z-index.
Nested AP Divs are listed in descending order within their parent AP Div.
2. Click the name of an AP Element for which you want to change the 
z-index.
3. Drag the AP Element name into a new list position and release the
mouse button.
As you drag, the selected AP Div is indicated by a thick line.
Figure 5-5 shows the effect of changing a z-index. In the top image, the z-index
of the bowling pins is higher than the starry background image. As a result,
the bowling pins are on top. Conversely, in the bottom image, the starry back-
ground image has the higher z-index value, and as a result, it’s on top of the
bowling pins. Dreamweaver reorders the list in the AP Divs tab and renumbers
AP Div z-indices to reflect your change. Also, Dreamweaver updates the asso-
ciated code for the AP Divs’ z-indices in the HTML source code for your page.
Because you don’t have to number the z-index of AP Divs consecutively, con-
sider leaving gaps between indices in case you later want to add new AP Divs
into the middle of the stack. For instance, use only even numbers for your
indices so that you can easily sandwich an AP Div with an odd-numbered 
z-index in between.

Moving an AP Div
You may want to move an AP Div to another location in the Document
window or to a position relative to the grid or to other objects.
To move an AP Div, select the AP Div in the Document window and then
reposition your selection by using one of the following three methods:
✦Click the AP Div’s border and drag the AP Div to a new location and
release the mouse button. The border highlights with a red line inside
the blue borderline to indicate that the AP Div can be moved.
✦Press the arrow keys to nudge the AP Div up, down, left, or right one
pixel at a time. If you hold down the Shift key, every press of an arrow
key moves the AP Div by ten pixels.
✦In the CSS-P Element Property inspector, enter a new value in the T (top)
and L (left) fields to indicate the pixel coordinates of the AP Div’s top-left
corner.

Nesting AP Divs
88
When moving AP Divs, you can choose to enable or prevent AP Div overlap,
depending on how you want the final image montage to appear. You enable
or prevent AP Div overlap by selecting or deselecting the Prevent Overlaps
check box in the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel.
Resizing an AP Div
Resizing an AP Div means changing its height and width dimensions. To resize
an AP Div, select the AP Div and perform one of the following tasks:
✦Click and drag a selection handle — one of the large dots on the AP Div
boundary — until the AP Div is the size you want.
✦In the CSS-P Element Property inspector, enter a new width in pixels in
the W field and a new height in pixels in the H field. If the CSS-P Element
Property inspector does not appear, open it by choosing Window➪
Properties.
You can change the height and width dimensions of multiple AP Divs at the
same time, provided the dimensions of the AP Divs you want to resize already
match. Simply follow these steps:
1. Press and hold the Shift key while selecting each AP Div you want to
resize.
If the Multiple CSS-P Elements Property inspector does not appear, open
it by choosing Window➪Properties.
2. In the Multiple CSS-P Elements Property inspector, enter a new width
in pixels in the W field and a new height in pixels in the H field.
Nesting AP Divs
A nested AP Div is an AP Div that has all of its HTML code lying within
another AP Div. The nested AP Div is often referred to as a child AP Div,
whereas the AP Div on which it depends is called the parent AP Div. A child
AP Div can be drawn completely inside its parent (as shown in Figure 5-6), in
an intersecting arrangement with its parent, or completely unattached to its
parent, depending on the effect you want to achieve. A nested AP Div inher-
its the same visibility of its parent and moves with the parent when the
parent AP Div is repositioned in the Document window.
Enabling nesting
To create nested AP Divs in the Document window, you must first enable
nesting. To do so, follow these steps:

Book I
Chapter 5

89
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box, or
press Ctrl+U.
2. In the Preferences dialog box, select AP Elements in the Category area.
3. Select the Nesting check box.
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
5. In the Document window, choose Window➪AP Elements to open the
AP Elements tab of the CSS panel.
6. In the AP Elements tab, make sure that the Prevent Overlaps option is
deselected.
Creating a new nested AP Div
Use either of these methods to draw a nested AP Div after enabling nesting:
✦Click inside an existing AP Div and choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪AP
Div. A child AP Div of default size appears inside the parent AP Div.
✦Choose Layout Tools➪Draw AP Div in the Layout category of the Insert
bar. Then click and drag your mouse in the parent AP Div, releasing the
mouse button when the AP Div has reached the dimensions you desire.

Nesting an existing AP Div
To change the nesting of an existing AP Div, follow these steps:
1. Open the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel by choosing Window➪
AP Elements or pressing F2.
2. In the AP Elements tab of the CSS panel, press and hold the Ctrl key
(Ô key on the Mac) while using the mouse to click and drag the
intended child AP Div on top of its new parent.
The child AP Div is in the correct position when you see a box appear
around the name of its intended parent AP Div.
3. Release the mouse button.
The new child-parent relationship is shown in the AP Divs tab of the
CSS panel.
Dreamweaver draws the new child AP Div and updates the associated code
for changed AP Div-nesting in the HTML source code for your page.
Collapsing or expanding your 
view in the AP Divs tab
You can change how you view the names of nested AP Divs in the AP
Elements tab of the CSS panel by collapsing or expanding your view:
✦To collapse your view: Click the minus sign (–) in front of a parent AP
Div. Names of nested child AP Divs for that parent are hidden.
✦To expand your view: Click the plus sign (+) in front of a parent AP Div.
Names of nested child AP Divs appear underneath that parent AP Div.

n previous chapters of Book I, we focus on providing a good working
knowledge of Dreamweaver CS3. Now we need to spend some time look-
ing at the more advanced uses of Dreamweaver in Web development. In this
chapter, we show you how to make images a bit more striking and how you
can bring some other multimedia elements to life.
Creating Clickable Image Maps with Hotspots
You can designate certain areas of an image as hotspots — active areas that
a user can click to open a link to another Web page or activate some other
behavior. Hotspots can be shaped like rectangles, circles, or polygons (irreg-
ular objects). The coordinates of the hotspots are grouped into chunks of
HTML code called image maps.
Creating a hotspot
Check out Figure 6-1. It shows a typical navigation bar for a site as a single
JPEG image, with hotspots added. The following procedure shows you how
to create an image map for that image by adding hotspots:

Creating Clickable Image Maps with Hotspots
92
1. Select the image to which you want to add a hotspot.
The Image Property inspector appears. If the bottom half of the Image
Property inspector is not visible, click the Expander button, which is the
down arrow in the bottom-right corner.
2. In the Map area of the Image Property inspector, click the Hotspot
button for the shape you want to draw.
You can choose a rectangle, a circle, or a polygon. Your mouse pointer
becomes a cross-hair cursor when you move it over the image.
3. Draw the hotspot according to the shape you select:
• Circle or rectangle: Click your cross hair cursor on the image and
drag diagonally to create a hotspot. Release the mouse button when
the hotspot reaches your desired dimensions. The area you draw is
highlighted light blue, and the Hotspot Property inspector appears.
• Polygon: Click your cross hair cursor on the image once for each
point. The area you draw is highlighted light blue and the Hotspot
Property inspector appears.
Depending on your preference settings, you may see a window remind-
ing you to supply Alternate text for the hotspot. Click OK.
4. In the Hotspot Property inspector, supply the following information:
• Map: Enter a unique name for the image map.
• Link: Enter a URL or the name of an HTML file you want to open when
the user clicks the hotspot. Alternatively, you can click the folder
icon and browse to select the link from your files. Note: Completing
this field is optional. Instead, you may choose to attach a behavior
to the hotspot.
• Behaviors: To attach a behavior other than a link to the hotspot, open
the Behaviors tab of the Tag panel by choosing Window➪Behaviors
or by pressing Shift+F4. Then click the Add (+) button in the Behaviors
panel, which opens a pop-up menu of available behaviors, including
Check Plugin, Effects, Popup Message, Preload Images, and many

others. Choose a behavior from the pop-up menu, complete the infor-
mation in the dialog box that appears for your selected behavior, and
click OK.
• Target: Complete this field if you entered a link in the Link field and
you want the link to open in a window or frame other than the one
you’re linking from. Click the arrow and select from the drop-down
list a target window where you want your selected link to appear.
You can select from the following choices: _blank (opens the link in
a new window); _parent (opens the link in the parent of the currently
opened window; if the currently opened window was opened from
another frame, the link will open in that frame); _self (the default;
opens the link in the currently opened window; not selecting a Target
produces the same effect); and _top (opens the link in the top-level
window, replacing frames, if any). If you have created frames, you
can also select a frame name from this list. (See Book I, Chapter 4 for
more information about frames.)
• Alt: Enter the text you want to show when the user moves the mouse
pointer over the hotspot. Alt text also makes information about the
hotspot accessible to vision-impaired users.
Modifying or deleting a hotspot
If you need to change the size or shape of a hotspot after you’ve created it,
or you need to change the link, target, or Alt information for the hotspot, use
the following procedure to edit the hotspot:
1. On an image in the Document window, click the hotspot you want to
modify.
The Hotspot Property inspector appears. If the inspector does not
appear, open it by choosing Window➪Properties.
2. Edit the Link, Target, or Alt information you want to change in the
Hotspot Property inspector.
3. If you want to reshape or resize the hotspot, select the Arrow tool in
the Hotspot Property inspector and then click any handle of the
selected hotspot and drag the handle to a new location.
4. If you want to reposition the hotspot, select the Arrow tool in the
Hotspot Property inspector, click anywhere within the hotspot, and
drag it to a new location.
You can delete a hotspot by selecting it and pressing the Del key on your
keyboard.

Adding Flash Text Rollovers

Adding Flash Text Rollovers
A text rollover is text that changes color when users move their mouse
pointer over it. One way to create text rollovers in Dreamweaver is by
adding Flash text to your pages, as described in the following section.
Flash text and Flash buttons are so named because Dreamweaver implements
these features using the same code that Adobe Flash CS3 (the animation pro-
gram included in Creative Suite 3) uses.
Adding Flash text
To add hyperlinked Flash text that changes color when users roll their
mouse over it, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Document window where you want to add Flash text.
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Text.
Your page must be saved before you can insert Flash text. If the page
hasn’t been saved at least once, an alert pops up to remind you to save
the page so you can insert the Flash text.
3. In the Insert Flash Text dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, select a font
from the Font drop-down list.

4. Enter a point size for your text in the Size text field.
5. If you want, you can also format the text.
You can click the Bold button and/or Italics button. You can also click an
alignment button. Alignment choices are Left, Center, and Right.
6. Select a Color (the initial color) and a Rollover Color (the color the
text changes to when users move their mouse pointer over it) by click-
ing the color swatch in each area and selecting a color from the color
palette that appears.
7. Enter your text in the Text field. Select the Show Font option if you
want to preview the characters in the Text field in your selected font.
8. In the Link field, enter a URL or the name of the page you want to
appear when the user clicks the Flash text.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from your
files.
9. In the Target area, click the arrow and select from the drop-down list
a target window where the linked page will appear.
If you have created frames, you can select a frame name from this list, or
you can select from the following choices:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the currently opened window.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default. Leaving the Target area empty produces the same result.
• _top: Opens the link in the top-level window, replacing any existing
frames.
10. Select a Background color by clicking the Bg Color swatch and selecting
a color from the color palette that appears, or type in a hexadecimal
number.
Your Flash text appears over the background color you choose.
11. Enter a name for your Flash text component in the Save As field or
click the Browse button to select a name from your files.
You must save Flash text with an .swf extension.
12. Click OK to create your Flash text and close the dialog box.
Depending on your preferences, you may see the Flash Accessibility
Attributes window. Enter the Title, Access key, and Tab index informa-
tion as needed and click OK. You can click OK without entering any

To preview the rollover effect of your Flash text, select the Flash object in
the Document window to open the Flash Text Property inspector. In the
Property inspector, click the Play button to view your Flash text as it will
appear in the browser window. Click the Stop button when you’re done.
Changing Flash text
You can change an existing Flash text object by simply double-clicking the
object in the Document window or by clicking the object and then clicking
the Edit button in the Property inspector. Doing so opens the Insert Flash
Text dialog box, where you can change various attributes of the object as we
describe in the previous section.
Adding Flash Button Rollovers
Buttons that change appearance when users move their mouse pointer over
them — called button rollovers — are so popular that Dreamweaver gives you
a way to create them quickly and easily as Flash movies. To find out how to
create button rollovers using images and behaviors instead of Flash button
rollovers, see the “Inserting Image Rollovers” section, later in this chapter.
(Book III, Chapter 5 describes how to make rollovers in Fireworks CS3 using
images and behaviors.)
Adding a Flash button
To add a Flash button, follow these steps:
1. Click in the Document window where you want to add a Flash button.
2. Choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Button to open the Insert Flash Button
dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-3.
Your page must be saved before you can insert a Flash button. If the
page hasn’t been saved at least once, an alert pops up to remind you to
save the page so you can insert the Flash button.
3. In the Insert Flash Button dialog box, scroll through the button selec-
tions in the Style list and click to select a style.
You can preview the style in the Sample area of the dialog box — just
point to the sample with your mouse to see the Flash button in action.
You can get new Flash buttons on the Dreamweaver Web site by clicking
the Get More Styles button in the Insert Flash Button dialog box. A Web
page on Adobe’s site opens in your browser. Select the Flash Media
option from the Categories drop-down list and scroll through the results
as needed.

4. If your selected button has a placeholder for text, enter the text that
you want to appear on the button in the Button Text field.
Text centers within the button automatically. Button size is fixed,
though, so you must make sure your text is brief enough to fit on the
button.
5. Select a font for your Flash button text from the Font drop-down list.
6. Enter a point size for your text in the Size field.
7. In the Link field, enter a URL or the name of the page that you want to
appear when the user clicks the Flash button.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from your
files.
8. From the Target drop-down list, select a target window where the
linked page will appear.
If you have created frames, you can select a frame name from this list, or
you can select from the following choices:
• _blank: Opens the link in a new window.
• _parent: Opens the link in the parent of the currently opened window.
• _self: Opens the link in the currently opened window; this is the
default. Leaving the Target area empty produces the same result.

Your Flash button displays with the background color you select.
10. Enter a name for your Flash button in the Save As field or click the
Browse button to select a name from your files.
The Flash button filename requires an .swf extension. Dreamweaver
will add the extension automatically if you don’t enter it.
11. Click OK to create your Flash button and close the dialog box.
Depending on your preferences, you may see the Flash Accessibility
Attributes window. Enter the Title, Access key, and Tab index informa-
tion as needed and click OK. You can click OK without entering any

To see what a Flash button looks like in action, select the button in the
Document window to open the Flash Button Property inspector. In the
Property inspector, click the Play button to view your Flash button as it
appears in the browser window. Click the Stop button when you finish.
Changing a Flash button
To change an existing Flash button object, simply double-click the object in
the Document window, or click the object and then click the Edit button in
the Property inspector. Doing so opens the Insert Flash Button dialog box,
where you can change your button as we describe in the previous section.
Inserting Image Rollovers
An image rollover (often just referred to as a rollover) is a behavior that
changes an image whenever users move their mouse pointer over the image.
Rollovers add interactivity to a Web page by helping users to see what parts
of the page are links to other Web pages.
A rollover is actually two images — one for normal display on a page (the
original image) and one that is slightly modified for display when the image
is rolled over (the rollover image). You can modify an image by changing the
color or position, adding a glow or a shadow, or adding another graphic —
such as a dog changing from sleeping to wide-awake. For a rollover to work
best, the normal and rollover states of the image should share the same
width and height.

Inserting Image Rollovers

As with all images, you can’t create the original image or the rollover image
directly in Dreamweaver; you must use an image-editing program, such as
Fireworks or Photoshop, to generate the images.
Insert a rollover by following these steps:
1. Click inside the Document window where you want to insert the
image rollover.
2. On the Common category of the Insert bar, click and hold the Image
button and select Rollover Image from the pop-up menu.
The Insert Rollover Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image.
3. In the Insert Rollover Image dialog box, enter a unique name for the
rollover in the Image Name field, making sure there are no spaces in
the name.
The rollover is referred to by this name in the HTML page code. Keep in
mind that this rollover name refers to the combined original image/
rollover image pair.
4. Enter the name of the original image file in the Original Image field,
or click the Browse button to select an image from your files.
The original image appears on the page when the user’s mouse pointer
is not over the image.
5. Enter the name of the rollover image file in the Rollover Image field,
or click the Browse button to select an image from your files.
The rollover image appears on the page when the user’s mouse pointer
is over the image.
Figure 6-4:

6. Select the Preload Rollover Image check box.
This feature makes the rollover action appear without delay to users as
they move the mouse pointer over the original image. It is selected by
default.
7. Enter alternate text for the image to make it accessible to vision-
impaired visitors to your site.
This step is optional but recommended.
8. If you want to make the rollover image a link, enter a URL of the page
in the When Clicked, Go to URL text field.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from your
files.
9. Click OK to accept your choices and close the dialog box.
To check the rollover, preview your page in a browser by choosing
File➪Preview in Browser or by clicking the Preview in Browser button, and
then use your mouse to point to the original image. You can also press F12
(on the PC, not on the Mac) to preview the rollover in the default preview
browser. If you haven’t set a default preview browser, you will have to do so
using the Preview in Browser category in Dreamweaver’s Preferences dialog
box. See Dreamweaver’s help documentation for details.
Setting Up a Navigation Bar
A navigation bar is a group of buttons that users can access to move through-
out your Web site. Buttons within a navigation bar may present users with
options, such as moving backwards, moving forwards, returning to the home
page, or jumping to specific pages within the site.
Each button in a navigation bar possesses properties similar to a rollover in
that the button changes state — or appears differently — based on where the
user is positioning the mouse pointer. However, a navigation bar button can
possess as many as four different states:
✦Up: The original state of the button
✦Over: How the button appears when a user moves their mouse pointer
over it
✦Down: How the button appears as a user is clicking it
✦Over While Down: How the button appears when the user moves
their mouse pointer over it after clicking it and arriving on the page it
represents

Setting Up a Navigation Bar
101
A navigation bar differs from individual rollovers in that clicking a navigation
bar button in the Down state causes all other buttons in the bar to revert to
the Up state.
To create a navigation bar, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Navigation Bar button from the Common category of the
Insert bar or choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Navigation Bar.
Whichever method you choose, the Insert Navigation Bar dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
2. In the Insert Navigation Bar dialog box, enter a name for the first
button in the Element Name field.
The new button appears in the Nav Bar Elements field. Don’t use spaces
in the names of any of these elements.
3. For each state of the button — Up Image, Over Image, Down Image,
and Over While Down Image — enter the name of the image file that
you want to use in the associated field.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button for each field and select
an image from your files. You must supply the Up Image. All other states
are optional and can be left blank.
You don’t need to use all four navigation bar button states — creating
only Up and Down states works just fine.
4. Enter alternate text for the image to make it accessible to vision-
impaired visitors to your site.
This step is optional but recommended.

5. In the When Clicked, Go to URL text field, enter a URL or the name for
the page you want to appear when the user clicks the navigation bar
button.
Alternatively, you can click the Browse button to select a page from your
files.
6. From the In drop-down list, select a target window where you want
the linked page to appear.
If you aren’t using frames, the only option is to use the Main window.
7. Click the Add Item (+) button to add another navigation bar button.
Repeat Steps 2 through 6 to format the new button.
Note: You can remove any button already created by clicking its name
in the Nav Bar Elements field and clicking the Remove Item (–) button.
You can also reorder the sequence of the buttons as they will appear on
the page by clicking a button name in the Nav Bar Elements field and
clicking the up- or down-arrow button.
8. In the Options area, select the Preload Images check box if you want the
rollover effects to appear without delay when the user triggers them.
9. To set the current button to appear in the Down state when the user
first sees the navigation bar (which you might do to indicate that the
current page is the one represented by the button), select the Show
“Down Image” Initially check box in the Options area.
The Over While Down state works in combination with this option.
10. Select Horizontally or Vertically from the Insert drop-down list to
position the navigation bar horizontally or vertically.
11. To set up the button images in a table format, select the Use Tables
check box.
This option is checked by default.
12. Click OK to accept your choices and close the dialog box.
To check the navigation bar, you must preview your page in a browser.
Choose File➪Preview in Browser or click the Preview in Browser button and
use your mouse to point to the buttons.
To change elements of an existing navigation bar, choose Modify➪
Navigation Bar. The Modify Navigation Bar dialog box is nearly identical 
to the Insert Navigation Bar dialog box shown in Figure 6-5, except that 
you can no longer change the orientation of the bar or access the Use Tables

Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
103
Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
You have two basic options, which are described in detail in the following
sections, for adding downloadable audio and video to your Web pages:
✦Embedding: You can embed an audio or video file to display a playback
console on a Web page that users can use to play, rewind, and fast-forward
the media file. (You can also embed an audio file and make it invisible to
create a background audio effect.)
Users must have an appropriate plug-in installed on their machines to
play the embedded audio or video file. To ensure maximum compatibility,
you may want to use Flash to create SWFs with audio and video (check
out Book III, Chapter 6 for details on adding audio and video to SWFs).
✦Linking: You can link to an audio or video file to give users the choice of
whether or not to view that media file.
Keep in mind that most audio and video files are large — large enough that
many folks impatiently click the Stop button on their browsers before a Web
page chock-full of audio or video effects has a chance to finish loading. Keep
the following basic rules in mind to help you use audio and video effectively
in your Web pages:
✦Use audio and video only when plain text just won’t do.
✦Keep your audio and video clips as short (and corresponding file sizes
as small) as possible.
Embedding an audio or video clip
You can embed an audio or video file by following these steps:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add an embedded audio or video file.
2. Click and hold the Media button in the Common category of the Insert
bar and select Plugin from the pop-up menu, or choose
Insert➪Media➪Plugin.
The Select File dialog box shown in Figure 6-6 appears.
3. In the File Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path or
browse to the audio or video file that you want to embed, and click OK.
If the file is outside your current root directory, Dreamweaver asks
whether you want to copy the file to your site’s root directory. Click Yes.

Adding Audio and Video to Your Pages
104
4. In the Plugin Property inspector, size the Plugin placeholder to any
dimensions you prefer.
You can either enter a width and height in the W and H text fields in the
Plugin Property inspector, or you can drag a handle on the placeholder
to manually resize.
Test in all your target browsers (the browsers your users are likely to
view your site with) to ensure that users can view all the audio playback
controls or video area and controls.
You can click the Play button in the Plugin Property inspector to play your
media file without previewing your page in a browser.
Embedding background music
Embedding background music (music that plays automatically after the user
opens a page) in your page can be controversial because users may be
unpleasantly surprised by audio when they are expecting silence, and
because users have no way to turn off the music from within the browser. If
you still want to embed background music in your page, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add an embedded audio file.
This should be an out-of-the-way location, like the bottom of your page,
so the embedded audio doesn’t create an awkward space in your design.
2. Click and hold the Media button in the Common category of the Insert
bar and select Plugin from the pop-up menu, or choose Insert➪Media➪
Plugin.

The Select File dialog box appears.
3. In the File Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path to
the audio file that you want to embed, and click OK.
If the file is outside your current root directory, Dreamweaver asks
whether you want to copy the file to your site’s root directory. Click Yes.
4. Enter a width and height of 2 in the W and H text fields in the Plugin
Property inspector.
5. Click the Parameters button to open the Parameters dialog box.
6. In the Parameters dialog box, click the Add (+) button to add a new
parameter.
7. Click in the Parameter column and type hidden.
8. Type true in the Value column.
Steps 7 and 8 hide the audio playback controls.
9. Click OK to complete the process and close the dialog box.
Linking to an audio or video clip
A simple and relatively trouble-free way to include audio and video clips on a
Web page is to link the page to an audio or video file. Users can click the link
if they want to hear or watch the clip. This selection opens a player outside
the browser where the user can control playback.
You follow the same steps to create a link to an audio or video file that resides
in your root folder as you do to create a link to a Web page (see Book I,
Chapter 2 for information on adding links); the only difference is that you
specify a media file instead of a URL for the link.
Adding Other Media
Dreamweaver enables you to easily insert a number of other multimedia 
formats into your Web pages, including ActiveX, Java Applets, Adobe Flash,
and Shockwave. After inserting any of these media formats, you can set the
control and playback features of the media in the Parameters dialog box.
Additionally, you can fine-tune the media action on your page by using the
Behaviors panel to create triggering actions that cause the media to play,
stop, and execute other functions.
Follow these directions to insert other media:
1. In the Document window, click the location in your page where you
want to add a multimedia file.

Adding Other Media
106
2. Click and hold the Media button in the Common category of the
Insert bar to view all the object types that you can insert, as shown in
Figure 6-7, and click the icon of the type of media file you want to
insert.
Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Media➪Media Type, where Media
Type is the type of media file you want to insert.
The Select File dialog box appears.
• For Applet, Macromedia Flash, and Shockwave files: In the File
Name field in the Select File dialog box, enter the path to the media
and click OK. Your file is inserted and the associated Property
inspector appears. You can change the selected file in the Plugin
Property inspector by typing a new name in the File text field or by
browsing in the File folder to select a file (for Applets, use the Code
text field). Select the Embed check box if you want Netscape
Navigator users to have access to the Applet.
• For ActiveX: An ActiveX placeholder is inserted and the ActiveX
Property inspector appears. Enter the name of the ActiveX object
you want to play in the Class ID text field. Select the Embed check
box if you want Netscape Navigator users to have access to the
ActiveX object.

3. In the Property inspector for your selected media, enter dimensions
in the W and H text fields to size the Media placeholder to any dimen-
sions you choose.
4. In the Property inspector for your selected media, click the Parameters
button to open the Parameters dialog box, where you can add parame-
ters (like width, height, loop, and autoplay) appropriate to the selected
media type.
Using Dreamweaver Templates
Dreamweaver comes with many built-in layouts that you can use to create
pages or Dreamweaver templates quickly. The layouts are predesigned pages
with placeholder content. Make a new page from a layout, replace the place-
holder content with real content, and voilà — a professionally designed page!
To create a new page based on a built-in layout, just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document dialog box appears.
2. Select Page from Sample in the Category list on the left.
The Sample Folder and Sample Page columns are updated.
3. Select Starter Page (Theme) or Starter Page (Basic).
The Sample Page column is updated. Click any page in the Sample Page
column to see a preview in the Preview area, as shown in Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8:

4. When you’ve found the layout you want, select the Document option
in the lower-right corner and click the Create button.
The Save As dialog box appears.
5. Name the file and click Save.
An untitled HTML page opens in the Document window with placeholder
content that you can replace with real content.
If the Copy Dependent Files dialog box appears, click Copy. The styles
and images used in the template will be copied to your site’s root folder.
You don’t have to use a built-in layout to create a Dreamweaver template:
You can make a Dreamweaver template based on any Web page. One cool
thing about Dreamweaver templates is that if you make a whole bunch of
pages based on a template, you can change the template, and all the pages
based on it will be updated to match the template automatically. Another
cool thing is that you can make a template that other people can use in com-
bination with either Dreamweaver or Contribute to create new pages that
conform to the template’s design.
To create a Dreamweaver template based on an existing HTML page, just
follow these steps:
1. Open the HTML page you want to use as a template.
2. Choose File➪Save As Template.
The Save As Template dialog box appears.
3. Select the site you want to use the template in.
By default, the current site is selected.
4. If desired, input a description of the template.
This step is optional.
5. In the Save As field, input a name for the template.
6. Click Save.
If the Update Links dialog box appears, click Yes. When you’ve saved the
template, you need to add editable regions. See Steps 4–6 in the next set
of steps to find out how.
To create a Dreamweaver template from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document dialog box appears, with the General tab selected.
2. Select Basic Page from the Category list on the left and then select HTML
Template from the list of Basic Pages that appears in the middle.

You can also select Template Page from the Category list and choose
HTML Template from the Template Page list that appears in the middle.
3. Create your page layout.
By default, nothing in the design of pages based on your template is
editable. You must create editable regions in order to make a useful 
template.
4. Click a table cell or other part of your layout that you want users to
be able to fill with content, and choose Insert➪Template Objects➪
Editable Region, or press Ctrl+Alt+V (Ô+Opt+V on a Mac).
The New Editable Region dialog box appears. If you have a placeholder
image already in the layout, you can right-click the image and choose
Templates➪New Editable Region from the context menu that pops up, or
you can select the image and press Ctrl+Alt+V (Ô+Opt+V on a Mac).
5. Name the region and click OK.
You can use the default name Dreamweaver gives to the region, but it’s
better if you name the region to reflect the content that will go into it
(for example, name the region Product Description). Figure 6-9 shows a
template with three editable regions. Editable regions are bound by a
light blue box with the region name at the top left.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have made editable regions out of all
the areas of the page that you want to be editable in new pages based
on the template.
Anything inside an editable region can be replaced in a page based on
the template; anything outside the editable regions is locked and can’t
be changed in pages based on the template.

7. Choose File➪Save.
The Save As Template dialog box appears.
8. Choose the site the template belongs to from the drop-down list, enter
a name for the template in the Save As field, and click the Save button.
The template will now be available to anyone who has access to the
Dreamweaver site, either through Dreamweaver or with Contribute.
To create an HTML page based on an existing user-created template, follow
these steps:
1. Click the Templates icon in the Assets tab of the File panel. All avail-
able templates for the selected site appear.
If the Files panel is closed, choose Window➪Assets or press F11 (on the
PC only, not the Mac).
2. Right-click the template you want to create the new page from and
choose New from Template, as shown in Figure 6-10.
The page opens as an HTML page in the Document window.

Validating Your Code
111
You can also create an HTML page based on a user-created template by
choosing File➪New and choosing the template from the Page From
Template category of the New Document dialog box. (When you select the
Page from Template category, the Templates options appear, as shown in
Figure 6-11.)
Validating Your Code
Dreamweaver CS3 has a built-in code validator. The validator checks your
HTML for errors (for example, unclosed <TD> tags or tags with invalid attrib-
utes, such as <FONT width=113>). If you work exclusively in Design view,
you may never need to use the validator. If you work in Code view, though,
and you are creating long, complex pages, you may find it worthwhile to run
the validator.
To validate your code on a page that’s open in the document window (unless
it’s XML), choose File➪Validate Markup or press Shift+F6. The Results panel
opens and shows a list of warnings for any faults in the code. Double-click a
result in the list to highlight the problem in the code.
To validate XML code, choose File➪Validate➪As XML. Because XML has
stricter requirements for well-formed code, you should take advantage of
Dreamweaver’s built-in validator if you’re writing XML or XHTML.

purpose from the practical (form validation) to the decorative (animation
effects).
In this chapter, we introduce you to the uses of the Spry widgets that ship
with Dreamweaver CS3. If the past is any indicator, new widgets will become
available from Adobe’s Web site as power users share their work with the
Adobe community.
If you can’t find what you’re looking for in this chapter, fear not. You can
always check out Dreamweaver’s built-in help files by choosing Help➪
Dreamweaver Help or pressing F1. You can also find more information on
the Web by choosing Help➪Spry Framework Help.
Adding Spry Data Set Widgets
Data set widgets allow you to display XML data on your page in ways that
reproduce the feel of dynamic pages; the user can sort data in tables by
clicking column headers, for example, or click a link to display, replace, or
hide an image or text anywhere on that same page. The best part is that the
user doesn’t have to wait for the page to refresh. It all appears pretty much
instantly. XML (or eXtensible Markup Language) looks a lot like HTML but
has a very different purpose. XML allows you to organize data so that it can
be stored in a single text file, exchanged between different systems, and dis-
played in multiple ways (including standard Web pages and cell phones).
If you need more information about XML, see XML For Dummies, 4th Edition,
by Lucinda Dykes and Ed Tittel (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

If you want to display the data from an XML file in a Spry Region, list, or
table, the first step is to tell Dreamweaver where the XML data is and how it
is structured. Read on to discover how to build the line of communication
between Dreamweaver and your XML file.
Defining a Spry XML data set
If you want to display on a Web page data that you have stored in an XML
file, the first step is to reference the XML data in Dreamweaver. To do so,
simply follow these steps:
1. If it’s not already selected, click the Spry tab in the Insert bar.
The Spry category of the Insert tab gives you one-click access to all the
Spry widgets available in Dreamweaver, as shown in Figure 7-1.
2. Click the Spry XML Data Set button on the Insert bar.
The Spry XML Data Set window appears, with a default Data Set name.
3. If you’ll be referencing more than one data set on your site, you may
want to input a custom name in the Data Set name field.
Data Set names can contain only letters and numbers and can start only
with a letter.

4. Click the browse button and navigate to the XML file in the Select XML
Source window that appears. Click the file and click OK.
The Select XML Source window disappears and the selected file appears
in the XML Source field.
5. Click the Get Schema button and click the Row Element that you want
to use as the basis for display.
For example, we want to show bowling balls but not other products
in the XML file, so we’ve selected “ball,” as you can see in Figure 7-2.
The data hierarchy is reflected in the Row Element window, which
shows subordinate elements as indented. The XPath, Data Set Columns,
Data Type, and Direction fields update automatically to their defaults.
You can click the Preview button to see how the data would appear in a
simple table in your browser. (Note: The Preview window shows only
the top 20 rows.)
Figure 7-2:

6. Optional: If you have XML elements for which you want to specify the
data type, click the element in the Data Set Columns area and choose
a data type from the Data Type select menu.
Specifying the data type can allow for sorting and formatting. The Data
Type choices are as follows:
• String: The data is treated as a generic string of characters, even if
the data consists of numerals only. This is the default setting.
• Number: The data is treated as a number.
• Date: The data can be formatted as a date.
• Image link: The data will be treated as a link to an image file.
7. Optional: Choose a sort method from the Sort select menu and a sort
direction from the Direction select menu.
The contents of the Sort menu depend on the Data Set Columns. You can
choose to sort the data by any of the columns shown in the Data Set
Columns section.
Your choices for sort direction are Ascending (low value to high value,
as in 1–100 or A–Z) or Descending (high value to low value, as in 100–1
or Z–A).
8. Optional: Select the Distinct On Load check box if you don’t want
duplicate columns in your display of the data.
9. Optional: Select the Turn XML Data Caching Off check box.
This option and the Auto Refresh Data option apply only if you have data
that updates constantly on your site. For our purposes, we’re assuming a
fairly static XML data source, so you wouldn’t want to select these options.
10. Click OK.
Dreamweaver inserts the Spry code in your document and the neces-
sary JavaScript files in a SpryAssets directory on your site. If you’re in
Design view, you won’t see the code (you can click the Code button in
the Document window to view the code).
Creating a Spry Region
After you have a defined Spry data set, you need to create a container on
your page that can hold Spry elements. This container is called a Spry
Region. There are two types of Spry Regions:
✦Spry Region: The regular type of region, a div tag that “wraps around”
(contains) Spry data elements such as tables, tabbed panels, and so on.
✦Spry Detail Region: A region dependent on, and dynamically updateable
by, a regular Spry Region.

Book I
Chapter 7
Adding Interactivity
with Spry
Adding Spry Data Set Widgets
117
You’ll be prompted to create a Spry Region if you attempt to insert a Spry
list or table in your document without first creating a Spry Region. In other
words, you don’t need to create a Spry Region as a stand-alone step in the
process of building your page. You can do so if you want.
To create a Spry Region on your page, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Spry Region button on the Spry category of the Insert bar.
The Insert Spry Region window appears.
2. Choose a container type by clicking either DIV or SPAN.
The default, DIV, is the better option in most cases.
3. Choose a type by clicking either Region or Detail Region.
Choose Detail Region if you’re creating a region that will update based
on feedback from an object in another region on the page. If so, you
need to create the other region and object first. Otherwise, leave the
default (Region) selected.
4. Choose the applicable Spry Data Set from the select menu.
To learn how to define a Spry data set, see “Defining a Spry XML data set,”
earlier in this chapter.
5. Click OK.
The Insert Spry Region window disappears. A box with a dotted-line
border and the sentence “Content for Spry Region Goes Here” shows the
Spry Region.
Creating a Spry Repeat
You can use the Spry Repeat function to display repeating elements in your
data set in whatever display format you want (as items stacked vertically in
a div or table cell, for example). If you want to display the data in a bulleted
or numbered list, use the Spry Repeat List function, described later in this
chapter.
To add a Spry Repeat, create your data set and add a Spry Region as
described previously. (If you haven’t done so ahead of time, you’ll be
prompted to do each as part of the process of creating a Spry Repeat.)
1. Click the spot in the Spry Region where you want the repeating ele-
ments to start.
2. Insert a binding for the repeating element you want to display by
selecting it and clicking the Insert button in the Bindings category of
the Application panel.
If you can’t see the Bindings panel, choose Window Bindings or press
Ctrl+F10. The element will appear in the document in curly brackets.

Adding Spry Data Set Widgets
118
3. Click the element in the document window to select it, and click the
Spry Repeat button in the Spry category of the Insert bar.
The Insert Spry Repeat window appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
4. Choose either DIV (the default) or SPAN to contain the repeating data.
In most cases, you’ll want to use a DIV as your container.
5. Choose either Repeat (the default) or Repeat Children.
Beginning users will probably want to stick with the default.
6. Select a data set from the Spry Data Set select menu.
If you have only a single data set associated with your page, it will
appear as the default, and only, choice.
7. Choose either Wrap Selection (the default; wraps the repeat div tag
around the element selected in the document window) or Replace
Selection (replaces the selected element with a div tag).
8. Click OK.
The Insert Spry Repeat window closes and the Spry Repeat div is added
to your page’s code.
Creating a Spry Repeat List
As you might guess from the name, a Spry Repeat List is a variation on the
Spry Repeat function. A Spry Repeat List simply lets you set up the repeating
display element in a list. You can create four types of lists, as follows:
✦UL: An Unordered List (a.k.a. a bulleted list)
✦OL: An Ordered (numbered) List
Figure 7-3:

✦DL: A Definition List
✦Select: A list of options for an HTML Select menu
To insert a Spry Repeat List into an existing Spry Region, simply follow these
steps:
1. Click the spot in the Spry Region where you want the list to start.
2. Click the Spry Repeat List button in the Spry category of the Insert bar.
The Insert Spry Repeat List window appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
3. Choose a type of list from the Container Tag select menu.
The four choices are listed at the beginning of this section.
4. Select a data set from the Spry Data Set menu.
If you have only a single data set associated with your page, it will
appear as the default, and only, choice.
5a. If you chose UL or OL in Step 3, choose which data element you want
to display on your page from the Display Column menu.
The menu contains all the columns in the data set that you selected in
Step 4.
5b. If you selected DL in Step 3, select a term from the DT Column menu
and a definition from the DD Column menu.
5c. If you selected Select in Step 3, select what the user will see in the
menu you’re creating from the Display Column menu and what will
be processed by the form from the Value Column menu.
6. Click OK.
The Insert Spry Repeat List window disappears, and Dreamweaver adds
the necessary code to your page.

Creating a Spry Table
A Spry Table is a nifty way to display a data set on your page. One cool fea-
ture of Spry Tables is that you can choose to make any column sortable
alphabetically or numerically: When the user clicks on a column header, the
data is instantly re-sorted based on the data in the selected column. Not only
that, but the user can toggle the results between ascending order (A–Z, or
1–100, say) and descending order (Z–A or 100–1, for example).
To add a Spry Table to an existing Spry Region, follow these steps:
1. Click the spot in the Spry Region where you want the table to go.
2. Click the Spry Table button in the Spry category of the Insert bar.
The Insert Spry Table window appears, as shown in Figure 7-5.
3. Select a data set from the Spry Data Set menu.
If you have only a single data set associated with your page, it will
appear as the default, and only, choice. The columns in that data set
appear in the Columns section of the Insert Spry Table window.
4. Optional: To change the display order of a table column, click to
select it and click the Up arrow to move it up in the list or click the
Down arrow to move it down in the list.
You can also click the Add Column (+) button to add a column or the
Remove Column (–) button to remove the column.
5. Optional: To make it possible for the user to sort the data in the table
by clicking a column header, select the column in the Columns section
and select the Sort Column When Header is Clicked check box.
Figure 7-5:
Inserting a
Spry Table.

Book I
Chapter 7
Adding Interactivity
with Spry
Validating User Input with Spry Widgets
121
You can do this for as many columns as you have in your table, for none
of the columns, or for anything in between. After you finish inserting the
table, you’ll have to add empty links to the column headers in order to
make them trigger the sort action. To add an empty link to an object (a
link that doesn’t go anywhere), select the object and input the pound
sign (#) in the Link field in the Properties panel.
6. Optional: If you already have a stylesheet set up, you can apply exist-
ing classes to odd and even rows in your table and for hover and
selected states for links.
If you want to control these aspects of the look of the table with CSS, it’s
better to set up the styles before you create the table so that you can
easily set the display options from the select menus in the Insert Spry
Table window.
7. Optional: If you are using the table to control a Spry Detail Region
elsewhere on the page, select the Update Detail Regions When Row Is
Clicked check box.
8. Click OK.
The Insert Spry Table window disappears and Dreamweaver inserts the
necessary code in your page. After that’s done, you can select the table
and apply width, cellpadding, and all the usual table attributes as
needed.
Validating User Input with Spry Widgets
In case you want to put user feedback forms on your site, Dreamweaver
gives you an easy way to make those forms smarter, thanks to Spry’s
form field validation widgets. You can set up the widgets to change color
and/or display an error message when a user enters information you’ve
defined as invalid. The widgets add client-side validation capabilities to the
following:
✦Text Input fields: You can set the minimum/maximum amount of charac-
ters allowed in the field, and you can declare certain characters as
either not allowed or required.
✦Select menu: You can make selecting an option required, and you can
declare a selection invalid (such as when you have horizontal lines sepa-
rating the menu options into groups).
✦Check boxes: You can make any number of check boxes required (for
example, you might say that the user must select a minimum of three
boxes out of nine).
✦Textareas: You can make a textarea required, and you can set a mini-
mum and maximum number of characters that the user must enter.

Validating User Input with Spry Widgets
122
No matter which type of form validation widget you use, you must place it
inside a form. You can either put a form in your page as a separate step (see
Book II, Chapter 4 for details), or you can simply add the form as part of the
process of adding the first Spry form validation widget to your page, as we
show below.
Adding a Spry text input field
To add a Spry text input field to your document, follow these simple steps:
1. Place your cursor in your document where you want the text input
field to go.
2. Click the Spry Validation Text Input button in the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
Depending on your preferences settings, the Input Tag Accessibility
Attributes window may appear. If it does, enter information as you see
fit. It’s a good practice to make your forms accessible to people with
impaired sight. For information about the accessibility attributes, see
your documentation. Whether you enter attributes or not, click OK to
close the window.
If you haven’t yet created a form on your page, a dialog box may appear
asking if you want to add a form tag. Click Yes. The dialog box will disap-
pear, and the Spry text input field will appear in your document, as
shown in Figure 7-6.
3. Depending on what type of information users might be putting in the
field, you may find preset validation scripts by selecting an option in
the Type select menu.
For example, if you want users to enter their e-mail address in the field,
you can select Email Address. The field will be checked to make sure
there is an @ sign and dot (.) in the data the user enters.
4. Depending on the Type you select, the Format menu may become
active. If the menu is not grayed out, select a required format for the
field.
For example, if the Type is Date, the required format could be mm/dd/yy,
mm/dd/yyyy, or another. If you chose the first one, and a user input
07/18/2000, the field would turn red and an error message would appear.
5. Select a Preview state from the Preview States select menu to see
what the field will look like in each of three states if you make the
field required (which it is by default). You must be in Design view to
see the Preview state.

Book I
Chapter 7
Adding Interactivity
with Spry
Validating User Input with Spry Widgets
123
The states may include:
• Initial: What the field looks like when the user first loads the page in
a browser.
• Required: What the field looks like when the field is required but is
left blank.
• Invalid Format: How the field appears when the user enters informa-
tion in a format invalid for the type (for example, an e-mail without
an @ sign).
• Valid: What the field looks like when the user has entered valid infor-
mation.
Other states may appear depending on what you choose elsewhere in
the Property inspector.
6. Choose an action that triggers the field’s validation by checking one of
the Validate On check boxes.
By default, fields are validated on Submit, that is, when the user clicks
the form’s Submit button. You can also choose Blur (when the user
clicks anywhere else on the page after entering information in the field)
or Change (when the user begins inputting data in the field).

124
7. Optional: If you wish to specify a minimum number or maximum
number of characters that the user can input into the text field, enter
the numbers in the Min Chars or Max Chars field, respectively.
8. Optional: Depending on the Type you select, the Min Value and Max
Value fields may become active.
For the Integer type, for example, you could set minimum or maximum
(or both) allowable numerals for the field. (The numeral the user inputs
must be at least 5, say, or no greater than 100.)
9. Optional: You can prepopulate the field with a temporary value that
shows the correct format by entering the value in the Hint field.
For example, if you’re asking the user to fill in a phone number, you
could enter (111) 222-3456.
10. Optional: Select the Enforce Pattern check box if you want to ensure
that no illegal characters can be put in the text field.
For example, for the Email Address type, the user would not be able to
input characters such as < or /.
11. Optional: Deselect the Required check box if you don’t want the user
to have to fill in the field in order to submit the form.
Otherwise, leave Required at the default setting, which will prevent the
user from submitting the form unless the user puts a value in the text
field.
You can change the error messages or the default colors for the different
states of the text field, but that’s a little too advanced to describe here.
Click the Customize This Widget link in the Properties panel to learn more.
Adding a Spry Select menu
What makes a Spry Select menu different from a regular old select menu?
Three things:
✦You can make choosing an option mandatory for the user.
✦You can make options invalid.
✦The menu will change color based on user feedback and will display an
error message if the user makes an invalid selection (or, if the menu is
required and the user makes no selection).
To insert a Spry Select menu into a form, follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the form where you want the select menu to go.
If you don’t already have a form on the page, Dreamweaver will prompt
you to create one.

2. Click the Spry Validation Select button in the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
Depending on your preferences, the Input Tag Accessibility Attributes
window may appear. Fill in the fields as needed (see Figure 7-7 for an
example of one possibility). Click OK. The window will disappear, even if
you didn’t add any information.
3. If you want choosing an option to be mandatory, leave the Do Not
Allow Blank Value check box selected, as it is by default.
4. If you have options in your select menu that you don’t want users to
be able to select, select the Do Not Allow Invalid Value check box and
enter an invalid value (the default, –1, should work just fine).
5. Select a Preview state from the Preview States select menu to see
what the field will look like in each of three states if you make the
field required (which it is by default). You must be in Design view to
see the Preview state.
The states may include:
• Initial: What the field looks like when the user first loads the page in
a browser.
• Required: What the field looks like when the field is required but is
left blank.
• Invalid Format: How the field appears when the user enters informa-
tion in a format invalid for the type (for example, an e-mail without
an @ sign).
• Valid: What the field looks like when the user has entered valid 
information.

Other states may appear depending on what you choose elsewhere in
the Property inspector.
6. Click the select menu in your form in the Document window.
The Property inspector updates to show the List/Menu options.
7. Click the List Values button.
The List Values window appears.
8. Click in the Item Label column and enter an Item Label.
The Item Label is the option as it will appear to the user.
9. Click the same line in the Value column and enter a value for the
option.
The value is what the form will return when the user clicks the Submit
button.
10. Click the Plus (+) button to add another list value, and continue until
you have entered all the values; then click OK to close the window.
Note that in Figure 7-8, we’ve assigned “Select one” a value of –1 so that
a user may not submit the form if he or she chooses that option.
11. If you want a particular option to be selected when the user first loads
the page in a browser, click the option in the Initially Selected menu.
12. Click anywhere in the document page to deselect the Select menu.
You can press F12 to preview the Select menu in a browser. You may be
prompted to save the page. If so, click Yes. The dialog box will disappear
and the page will load in your default browser.
Adding a Spry Checkbox
If you want an easy way to make a certain number of check boxes required,
create Spry Checkboxes on your page. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click in the canvas where you want the check box to go.
Figure 7-8:

2. Select the Spry Validation check box in the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
Depending on your preference settings, the Input Tag Accessibility
Attributes window may appear. If it does, enter information as you see
fit. It’s a good practice to make your forms accessible to people with
impaired sight. For information about the accessibility attributes, see
your documentation. Whether you enter attributes or not, click OK to
close the window.
If you haven’t yet created a form on your page, a dialog box may appear
asking if you want to add a form tag. Click Yes. The dialog box will disap-
pear and the Spry Checkbox will appear in your document, as shown in
Figure 7-9.
3. Select Required (Single) if you want users to have to select at least one
check box; select Enforce Range (Multiple) if you want users to have
to select at least two check boxes.
If you select Enforce Range, enter a minimum number of boxes the user
must select in the Min # of Selections field. If you don’t want users to be
able to select more than a certain number of boxes, enter that number in
the Max # of Selections field.

4. Select a Preview state from the Preview States select menu to see
what the field will look like in each of three states if you make the
field required (which it is by default).
You must be in Design view to see the Preview state.
See Step 5 in “Adding a Spry Select menu” for details.
5. Choose an action that triggers the field’s validation by selecting one of
the Validate On check boxes.
By default, fields are validated on Submit, that is, when the user clicks
the form’s Submit button. You can also choose Blur (when the user
clicks anywhere else on the page after entering information in the field)
or Change (when the user begins inputting data in the field).
6. Add more check boxes as necessary by starting again at Step 1. Press
the Enter key or click anywhere in the Document window when
you’re finished.
If you’re enforcing a range, be sure to match the Min # of Selections and
Max # of Selections for each check box you create.
Adding a Spry Textarea
When you create a Spry Textarea in your form, you make a multiline input
field in which users can enter several lines of text. You can set minimum and
maximum character amounts, add a character counter, and make the field
required. To create a Spry Textarea in your form, simply follow these steps.
1. Click in your Document where you want the Textarea to go.
2. Click the Spry Validation Textarea button in the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
Depending on your preference settings, the Input Tag Accessibility
Attributes window may appear. See Step 2 in “Adding a Spry Checkbox,”
the preceding section, for more information.
If you haven’t yet created a form on your page, a dialog box may appear
asking if you want to add a form tag. Click Yes. The dialog box will disap-
pear, and the Spry Textarea will appear in your document.
3. In the Property inspector, leave the Required check box selected if
you want to require users to enter text in the textarea.
4. Select a Preview state from the Preview States select menu to see
what the field will look like in each of three states if you make the
field required (which it is by default). You must be in Design view to
see the Preview state.
The states may include:

• Initial: What the field looks like when the user first loads the page in
a browser.
• Required: What the field looks like when the field is required but is
left blank.
• Invalid Format: How the field appears when the user enters informa-
tion in a format invalid for the type (for example, an e-mail without
an @ sign).
• Valid: What the field looks like when the user has entered valid 
information.
Other states may appear depending on what you choose elsewhere in
the Property inspector.
5. Choose an action that triggers the field’s validation by selecting one of
the Validate On check boxes.
By default, fields are validated on Submit, that is, when the user clicks
the form’s Submit button. You can also choose Blur (when the user
clicks anywhere else on the page after entering information in the field)
or Change (when the user begins inputting data in the field).
6. If you want to set a minimum number of characters that users must
enter in the textarea, enter the number in the Min Chars field.
7. If you don’t want users to input more than a certain number of charac-
ters in the textarea, enter that number in the Max Chars field.
By default, if you enter a Max Chars limit, the Block Extra Characters
check box is selected. When this box is selected, users cannot enter
more than the maximum number of characters you specify.
Also, if you enter a Max Chars limit, you can add a character counter
that will appear in the user’s browser indicating either the number of
characters entered (Chars Count) or the number of allowed characters
not yet entered (Chars Remaining).
8. Optional: If you want to include instructions in the textarea itself,
enter text in the Hint field in the Spry Textarea Property inspector.
We put the hint “ Up to 200 characters,” as shown in Figure 7-10.
If you want to edit the non-Spry properties of any of your Spry Validation
form elements, simply click the element to select it and enter the properties
in the Property inspector. You can mix non-Spry form elements with Spry
form elements. In fact, there’s no Spry Submit button, so you need to add the
button from the Forms category of the Insert bar. See Book II, Chapter 4 for
more information about creating and modifying forms.

Adding Spry Navigation Widgets
130
Adding Spry Navigation Widgets
Spry Navigation widgets offer you a simple way to add flashy navigation to
your site. Apart from being cool, the chief advantage of Spry navigation
widgets is that they save plenty of space. You can have
✦Multilevel menus that appear only when a user rolls over a specified
area, with the extra levels appearing to hover above the page
✦Panels that share the same space on a page, which users can activate by
clicking the associated tabs
✦Panels with detail areas that appear to slide open while other detail
areas appear to close
✦Panels with detail areas that the user can make appear and disappear,
affecting other elements on the page
Inserting a Spry Menu Bar
A Spry Menu Bar is essentially a multilevel pop-up menu of the kind that first
appeared on the Web scene with the advent of DHTML. If you are building a
site that has two or more levels of navigation and much information to
squeeze on every page, Spry Menu Bars are for you.

To create a Spry Menu Bar on a page, follow these steps:
1. Click in your document where you want to put the menu bar.
2. Click the Spry Menu Bar button in the Spry category of the Insert bar.
The Spry Menu Bar window appears.
3. Choose either Horizontal (menu items appear side by side) or Vertical
(menu items arranged top to bottom) and click OK.
The Spry Menu Bar window closes and the menu bar appears in your
document, with placeholder text for each top-level menu item and three
second-level items for each top-level item.
4. Click the first item in the left-hand list (top-level items); then, click in
the Text field on the right and enter what the menu item should say.
5. Enter a link for the menu item by typing it in the Link field or clicking
the Folder icon and browsing to the page you want to link to.
6. Click the first item in the middle list (second-level items); then, click in
the Text field on the right and enter what the menu item should say.
7. Enter a link for the second-level menu item.
Click each of the second-level items in turn and follow the same procedure.
8. If you have third-level links, click the top-level menu item in the first
column, the second-level link in the second column, and the Add
button (+) in the third column.
A new Untitled Item appears in the third column, highlighted, as shown
in Figure 7-11.
9. Enter Text and Link information in the Text and Link fields on the right.
10. Continue until you have fully populated your menu as needed.
To remove an item from any column, click to select it and click the
Remove Menu Item (–) button above that column.
11. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
If this is the first Spry Menu Bar widget you’ve added to your site,
Dreamweaver will let you know that the applicable Spry Assets will be
copied to the SpryAssets directory in your site.
After you’ve saved your document, you can preview it in a browser by
choosing File➪Preview in Browser➪Browser Name or by pressing F12.
When you remove a top-level or second-level link, all links below it in the
hierarchy (also known as child links) are removed at the same time. If you
try to remove a parent link, Dreamweaver will alert you that the child links of
that parent will also be deleted.

To change the position of an item, click to select it and use the Up arrow to
put the item before others or the Down arrow to put the item after others.
Inserting a Spry Tabbed Panel
If you use a modern browser — Safari, Mozilla, or Internet Explorer 7, for
example — you know about the advantages of tabbed browsing. You can go
to a new page in the browser without opening a new window or browsing
away from your previous page. Spry Tabbed Panels provide the same effect
but do so on a single Web page. The user can’t look at the contents of two
Tabbed Panels simultaneously, but the user can click different tabs to see
the contents of their associated panels in a single space on the page, without
the page having to reload in a browser.
To create a Spry Tabbed Panel, follow these steps:
1. Click in the canvas where you want the tabbed panel to go.
2. Click the Spry Tabbed Panel button on the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
A Spry Tabbed Panels widget appears in the document, with two tabs,
and the Property inspector updates to show the Tabbed Panels options,
as shown in Figure 7-12.
Figure 7-11:

3. Click and drag across the Tab 1 text in the document to select it, and
enter your own text for the first tab.
4. Click and drag across the Content 1 placeholder text and insert the
content that should appear on the page when the user clicks the tab
on the left.
You can insert nearly anything in a panel that you’ll find in the Common
tab of the Insert bar.
5. Repeat the preceding Steps 3 and 4 for Tab 2.
6. If you want to add another tab, click the Spry Tabbed Panels label in
the document to select the widget; otherwise, skip to Step 8.
You can also click anywhere along the light-blue border of the widget to
select it. The border will be highlighted and the Property inspector will
be updated to display the Tabbed Panels options.
7. Click the Add Panel (+) button in the Tabbed Panels Property 
inspector.
A new tab (named Tab 3 by default) appears in the document and in
the panels column. Repeat the preceding Steps 3 and 4 for the third tab.
If you want to add another panel, repeat this step until you have as
many tabs as you want.

8. If you don’t want the left panel to be the one that’s visible when the user
first loads the page in a browser, you can select a different Default panel
from the menu on the right of the Tabbed Panels Property inspector.
9. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
If this is the first Spry Tabbed Panels widget you’ve added to your site,
Dreamweaver will let you know that the applicable Spry Assets will be
copied to the SpryAssets directory in your site.
After you’ve saved your document, you can preview it in a browser by
choosing File➪Preview in Browser➪Browser Name or by pressing F12.
Inserting a Spry Accordion
The Spry Accordion widget works in a similar way to the Spry Tabbed Panels
widget. The Accordion has two main differences:
✦The tab that a user clicks to view a different panel is a long, narrow strip
by default.
✦The selected panel appears to slide open, obscuring the previously open
panel.
To add a Spry Accordion to your page, simply follow these steps:
1. Click in the canvas where you want the tabbed panel to go.
2. Click the Spry Accordion button on the Spry category of the Insert bar.
A Spry Accordion widget appears in the document, with two labels, and
the Properties panel updates to show the Accordion options. Label 1,
the top strip, is selected by default.
3. Click and drag across the Label 1 text in the document window and
insert the content you want the user to click in order to view the con-
tents of the top panel.
You can put any element in the tab. Try to use something that describes
the contents of the panel.
4. Click and drag across the Content 1 text to highlight it and enter con-
tent in the first panel, as shown in Figure 7-13.
You can insert pretty much any content in the panel that you can find in
the Common category of the Insert bar. In Figure 7-13, we’ve included
only text.
5. Click and drag to select the Label 2 text in the document window and
enter the descriptive text a user will click to view the second panel.
Notice that when the tab is active in the document window, an eye icon
appears at the far right of the tab. Click the eye icon to view the panel
content for the tab.

6. Insert content in the second panel.
7. If you want to add another tab, click the Spry Accordion label in the
document to select the widget. Otherwise, skip to Step 9.
You can also click anywhere along the light-blue border of the widget to
select it. The border will be highlighted and the Property inspector will
be updated to display the Tabbed Panels options.
8. Click the Add Panel (+) button in the Accordion Property inspector.
A new tab (named Label 3 by default) appears in the document and in
the panels column. Repeat the preceding Steps 3 and 4 for the third tab.
If you want to add another panel, repeat this step until you have as
many tabs as you want.
9. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
If this is the first Spry Accordion widget you’ve added to your site,
Dreamweaver will let you know that the applicable Spry Assets will be
copied to the SpryAssets directory in your site.
After you’ve saved your document, you can preview it in a browser by
choosing File➪Preview in Browser➪Browser Name or by pressing F12.

Inserting a Spry Collapsible Panel
As with the Spry Tabbed Panels and Accordion widgets, the Spry Collapsible
Panel allows you to hide content on your page until the user does something
to make the content visible. When the panel expands, it pushes everything
below it on the page down; when the panel collapses, anything below it on
the page moves up.
To add a Spry Collapsible Panel to your page, follow these steps:
1. Click in the canvas where you want the Collapsible Panel to go.
2. Click the Spry Collapsible Panel button on the Spry category of the
Insert bar.
A Spry Collapsible Panel widget appears in the document, with a tab
labeled “Tab” and a panel with the default text “Content.” The Properties
panel updates to show the Collapsible Panel options. By default, Display
and Default State are set to Open, and the Enable Animation check box is
selected, as shown in Figure 7-14.

3. Click and drag to select the Tab text in the document window and
insert your own descriptive text that the user will click to open and
close the panel.
The text might be something like “Details” or it might be a more generic
“Show/Hide.”
4. Click and drag to select the Content default text and insert content
into the panel.
Content may include anything you can add to a document via the
Common tab of the Insert panel, as well as any other Web content.
5. If you want to preview the Open or Closed state of the panel within the
document window, change the Display select menu to Open or Closed.
You can also roll over the tab and click the eye icon at the right of the
tab to display or hide the panel.
6. Choose either Open or Closed in the Default State menu to make the
panel appear open or closed when the user loads the page in a browser.
7. If you want to disable the animation effect of the panel sliding open
and closed when the user clicks the tab, deselect the Enable Animation
check box.
If you disable the animation, the panel will appear and disappear
abruptly when the user clicks the tab.
8. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save your changes.
If this is the first Spry Collapsible Panel widget you’ve added to your
site, Dreamweaver will let you know that the applicable Spry Assets will
be copied to the SpryAssets directory in your site.
After you’ve saved your document, you can preview it in a browser by
choosing File➪Preview in Browser➪Browser Name or by pressing F12.
Dazzling Users with Spry Effects
Elsewhere in this chapter, we show you how to use Spry widgets to display
XML data sets, to create multilevel navigation bars, and to show and hide
content. In this section, we discuss the Spry widgets that add pizzazz to your
page without necessarily having a more practical purpose (except perhaps
drawing attention to a particular chunk of content). As with the Spry widg-
ets, the changes in appearance happen without any reloading of the page in
the browser.

Dazzling Users with Spry Effects

Dreamweaver CS3 ships with Spry effects widgets that make content appear
to do the following:
✦Fade in and out
✦Appear and disappear as if being revealed/obscured by a blind
✦Grow and shrink
✦Highlight
✦Shake
✦Slide up and down
✦Squish
✦Any combination of the preceding
Spry effects don’t work on all objects. For example, you can add a Fade
effect to an image, but you can’t add a Blind effect to an image. You can add
a Blind effect to a div that includes an image, though. If you apply an effect
and it doesn’t seem to be working, check the Help files to make sure that the
effect you’re applying can be applied to the object you’re trying to affect.
Effects depend on two objects:
✦The triggering object: The linked text or button that triggers the effect
based on a user action such as clicking the mouse. To add an empty link
to an object (a link that doesn’t go anywhere), select the object and
input the pound sign (#) in the Link field in the Properties panel.
✦The affected object: The object that changes when triggered. This
object must have an ID (you can add an ID in the Properties panel or the
Attributes panel).
After you’ve added a Spry effect, you must save your document in order to
preview the effect in a browser. The first time you save after adding a Spry
effect, the Copy Dependent Files window appears, letting you know that
the SpryEffects.js file will be placed in the SpryAssets directory in
your site. Click OK to add the file and close the window. Do not delete the
SpryEffects.js file from your site—it’s required to make the effects work.
And don’t forget to copy the Spry directories to your Web server with the
rest of your site files.
Making objects fade in and out
You can make objects fade in or out when a user performs a specified action,
or when the page first loads in a browser. You could think of the Spry fade
effect as kind of a slow-motion button rollover.

Book I
Chapter 7
Adding Interactivity

Dazzling Users with Spry Effects

The Appear/Fade effect won’t work with the following objects: applet,
body, iFrame, object, tr, tbody, and th.
We’re assuming that the object you want to add the effect to, and the trigger
for the effect, are in your document already. The object you want to add the
effect to must have an ID, which you can add by selecting the object and
entering characters in the ID field of the Properties panel. To add a fade to
an object (text, an image, or a div, for example), follow these steps:
1. In the document window, select the object you want to use as a 
trigger.
2. Click the Add (+) button in the Behaviors panel (you can find
Behaviors as a category of the Tag panel).
If the Behaviors panel isn’t open, choose Window Behaviors or press
Shift+F4.
3. Choose Effects➪Appear/Fade from the pop-up menu.
The Appear/Fade window appears, as shown in Figure 7-15.
4. For target element, select the object that you want to apply Appear/
Fade to.
If you don’t see the object in the select menu, check to make sure that it
has an ID and that the effect can be applied to its type of object.
5. Enter a number in milliseconds for the amount of time you want the
effect to last in the Effect Duration field.
One thousand milliseconds equals 1 second; 2000 milliseconds is 2 sec-
onds; 500 milliseconds is, you guessed it, half of one second. You want
the effect to last long enough to be noticeable but not so long that the
user gets frustrated waiting for the effect to end.
Figure 7-15:

6. Choose an effect from the Effect select list.
Your choices are Fade (start visible and slowly become less visible
or invisible) or Appear (start less visible or invisible and become more
visible).
7a. If you selected Fade in Step 6, you can set the visibility at the start
(Fade From) and end (Fade To) of the effect by entering a number
from 0 to 100 in the Fade fields.
One hundred would be totally visible; 0 is totally invisible.
7b. If you selected Appear in Step 6, you can set the visibility at the start
(Appear From) and end (Appear To) of the effect by entering a
number from 0 to 100 in the Appear fields.
Zero is totally invisible; 100 is totally visible.
8. If you want the user to be able to toggle the effect on and off, select
the Toggle Effect check box.
9. Click OK.
The Appear/Fade window disappears and the behavior shows in the
Behaviors panel. By default, the behavior is triggered when the user
clicks the trigger with the behavior applied to it. You can click onClick
in the action column of the Behavior panel and choose a different trigger
from the select menu that appears.
Applying the Open/Close Blind effect
When you add the Blind effect, the user can see an object seem to appear or
disappear as if it is behind a blind or curtain.
This effect cannot be applied to images. It can be applied to the following
HTML objects: address, dd, div, dl, dt, form, h1 through h6, p, ol, ul,
li, applet, center, dir, menu, and pre.
Adding the effect to an object is essentially identical to making objects fade
in or out (see the steps in the preceding “Making objects fade in and out”
section), so we’re saving some space here as we describe how to apply the
Blind effect:
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding set of steps.
2. Choose Effects➪Blind from the pop-up menu.
The Blind window appears.
3. Select a Target Element and enter an amount in the Effect Duration
field, as per Steps 4 and 5 above.

Book I
Chapter 7

Dazzling Users with Spry Effects
141
4. Choose an effect from the Effect select menu.
Your choices are Blind Up (the object is visible) and Blind Down (the
object seems to disappear behind the blinds).
5a. If you selected Blind Up in Step 4, you can set the visibility at the start
(Blind Up From) and end (Blind Up To) of the effect by entering a
number from 0 to 100 in the Blind Up fields.
One hundred is totally visible; 0 is totally obscured.
5b. If you selected Blind Down in Step 4, you can set the visibility at the
start (Blind Down From) and end (Blind Down To) of the effect by
entering a number from 0 to 100 in the Blind Down fields.
Zero obscures the object completely; 100 makes the object completely
visible.
6. If desired, select the Toggle Effect check box and click OK.
See Step 9 in the steps in the preceding “Making objects fade in and out”
section for details.
Making objects grow and shrink
The Spry Grow/Shrink effect doesn’t simply make objects grow or shrink in
place. Instead, it moves them as it shrinks, either diagonally to the bottom-
left or top-left corner, or toward/from the center.
To save space, we refer to the previous steps for “Making objects fade in and
out” where they apply equally to making objects grow and shrink.
1. Follow Steps 1 and 2 in “Making objects fade in and out.”
2. Choose Effects➪Grow/Shrink from the pop-up menu.
The Grow/Shrink window appears.
3. Select a Target Element and enter an Effect Duration, as per Steps 4
and 5 from “Making objects fade in and out.”
4. Choose an Effect from the Effect select menu.
Your choices are Shrink and Grow.
5a. If you selected Shrink in Step 4, you can set the size at the start
(Shrink From) and end (Shrink To) of the effect by entering a number
from 0 to 100 in the Shrink fields; then, select either Shrink to Center
or Shrink to Top Left Corner.
One hundred is full size; 0 is invisibly small.

Dazzling Users with Spry Effects
142
5b. If you selected Grow in Step 4, you can set the size at the start (Grow
From) and end (Grow To) of the effect by entering a number in the
fields; then, select either Grow to Center or Grow to Top Left Corner.
Zero obscures the object completely; 100 makes the object full size. You
can use a number higher than 100 (200, for example, would be double-
size), but be aware that you might grow your object right off the page!
6. If desired, select the Toggle Effect check box and click OK.
See Step 9 in the previous “Making objects fade in and out” section for
details.
Highlighting with color
The Highlight effect makes an object change from one color to another 
(typically, you would use this effect to change the background color of a
paragraph, a div, or even a whole page). As with other Spry effects, you can
set how quickly or slowly the change takes place and whether the user can
toggle the effect back and forth.
To use the highlight effect to change the background color of a div, follow
these steps:
1. In the document window, select the object you want to use as a trigger.
2. Click the Add (+) button in the Behaviors panel (you can find
Behaviors as a category of the Tag panel).
If the Behaviors panel isn’t open, choose Window Behaviors or press
Shift+F4.
3. Choose Effects Highlight.
The Highlight window appears.
4. For Target Element, select the div whose background color you want
to change.
If you don’t see the object in the Target Element select menu, check to
make sure it has an ID and that the effect can be applied to its type of
object.
5. Enter a number in milliseconds for the amount of time you want the
effect to last in the Effect Duration field.
One thousand milliseconds equals 1 second; 2000 milliseconds is 2 sec-
onds; 500 milliseconds is half of one second. You want the effect to last
long enough to be noticeable but not so long that the user gets frustrated
waiting for the effect to end.

6. Set the Start Color either by clicking the color box and choosing a
color via the color picker or by entering the color’s hexadecimal
equivalent in the Start Color text field.
See Book IV, Chapter 3 for details on using the color picker. If the start
color is different from the existing background color of the div, the div
will change color abruptly to the start color and then proceed to the end
color at the rate you set in the Effect Duration field.
7. Set the End Color either by clicking the color box and choosing a
color via the color picker or by entering the color’s hexadecimal
equivalent in the End Color text field.
8. Set the Color After Effect either by clicking the color box and choos-
ing a color via the color picker or by entering the color’s hexadecimal
equivalent in the Color After Effect text field.
The Color After Effect is the color that the object retains at the end of the
effect. That color does not have to be the same one as the original color of
the object, but that would be a typical implementation. The switch from
the End Color to the Color After Effect is abrupt (unless the Color After
Effect is identical to the end color, in which case there’s no switch at all).
9. If you want the user to be able to toggle the effect on and off, select
the Toggle Effect check box.
10. Click OK.
The Highlight window disappears and the behavior shows in the
Behaviors panel. By default, the behavior is triggered when the user
clicks the trigger with the behavior applied to it. You can click onClick
in the action column of the Behavior panel and choose a different trigger
from the select menu that appears.
Shaking up an object
The Shake Spry effect moves an object back and forth three times. It’s one of
the simplest Spry effects to apply to an object because it doesn’t permit you
to choose any options (at least not in the current implementation of Spry as
of this writing). To add the effect to an object, simply click the Add Effect
button (the + sign) in the Behaviors panel, select a Target Element (the object
you want to shake), and click OK.
Sliding an object up or down
Sliding is similar to the Blind effect, except that instead of remaining station-
ary while the effect obscures or shows the element, sliding makes everything
in a div move up as it disappears or down as it appears. The Slide effect can
be applied only to a single “container” div.

Dazzling Users with Spry Effects
144
To add the Slide effect to a div, follow these steps:
1. In the document window, select the object that you want to use as a
trigger.
2. Click the Add (+) button in the Behaviors panel (you can find
Behaviors as a category of the Tag panel).
If the Behaviors panel isn’t open, choose Window Behaviors or press
Shift+F4.
3. Select the div from the Target Element menu, as shown in Figure 7-16.
4. Choose either Slide Up or Slide Down in the Effect menu.
Slide Up will start with the div fully or partially visible and end with the
div partially or fully hidden. Slide Down will do the opposite.
5a. If you choose Slide Up in Step 4, enter a number in the Slide Up From
field, and select either % or pixels for the number. Proceed to Step 6a.
The default of 100% means that the full div appears before the effect is
applied. If you choose pixels, and you choose a lower number than the
actual height of the div, the top of the div will seem to be hidden at the
start of the slide.
5b. If you choose Slide Down in Step 4, enter a number in the Slide
Down To field and select either % or pixels for the number. 
Proceed to Step 6b.
The default of 0% means that the div would be totally hidden at the end
of the effect. If you choose a pixel number instead, and the number is
lower than the height of the div, some of the div will remain visible at the
end of the effect.

6a. If you choose Slide Up in Step 4, enter a number in the Slide Up To
field and select either % or pixels for the number.
The default of 0% means that the div would be totally hidden at the end
of the effect. If you choose a pixel number instead, and the number is
lower than the height of the div, some of the div will remain visible at the
end of the effect.
6b. If you choose Slide Down in Step 4, enter a number in the Slide Down
From field and select either % or pixels for the number.
The default of 100% means the full div appears at the end of the effect.
If you choose pixels, and you choose a lower number than the actual
height of the div, the top of the div will seem to be hidden at the end of
the slide.
7. If you want the user to be able to toggle the div up and down by click-
ing repeatedly, select the Toggle Effect check box.
8. Click OK.
The Slide window disappears and the behavior shows in the Behaviors
panel. By default, the behavior is triggered when the user clicks the trig-
ger with the behavior applied to it. You can click onClick in the action
column of the Behavior panel and choose a different trigger from the
select menu that appears.
Squishing an object
Squish lets a user toggle an object so that it appears to move up and away
into the top-left corner. It’s one of the simplest Spry effects to apply to an
object because it doesn’t permit you to choose any options (at least not in
the current implementation of Spry as of this writing). To add the effect to an
object, simply click the Add Effect button (the + sign) in the Behaviors panel,
select a Target Element (the object you want to squish) and click OK.
Combining effects
You can combine effects easily by simply selecting the trigger object and
clicking the Add Behavior (+) button. Then just follow any of the previous
sets of steps. It is possible to “chain” effects (make them happen one after
the other instead of simultaneously), but that takes some programming
know-how that’s beyond the scope of this book. As you work with Spry
Effects, you can always check out much of how things work by using Code
view in the Document window. For now, though, celebrate how easy it is in
Dreamweaver to add dynamism to your Web pages with Spry widgets!

P
hotoshop CS3 includes significant improvements to the workspace, 
filters, and selection tools. In this chapter, you take a quick tour of
some of most exciting new capabilities. The features you see depend on the
Photoshop that you have (Standard or Extended).
This quick rundown of what is new and exciting in Photoshop CS3 is hopefully
a help to you as you start experimenting with the new tools and features.
If you really want to dive into the new features, choose Window➪Workspace➪
What’s New In CS3. Instantly all new features are highlighted in the menus!
A New Efficient Workspace
As soon as you launch Photoshop CS3, the more efficient workspace —
meaning more space is available for you to work on your images — is 
apparent (see Figure 1-1).
The toolbar is now single column. If you don’t like the change in the toolbar,
you can return to the old two-column display by clicking the gray bar at the
top of the toolbar.
Additionally, palettes are collapsed to a compact view and represented by
icons, saving even more space. The new workspace makes focusing on the
images easier, and the tools become a natural extension of your work.

A New Efficient Workspace

Photoshop continues to make extensive use of palettes. To activate a palette
in this new version, simply click the appropriate palette icon. If you select
another palette icon, its pane is brought to the front of the display. You can
return them to icons by clicking the Collapse To Icons bar at the top of the
palette drawer. When an icon is dragged out to the work area, it automati-

Do you have Standard or Extended?
How can you tell whether you have Photoshop
Standard or Extended? If you purchase the
master, Design Premium, or Web Premium Suite,
you have Photoshop Extended.
Do you need Extended? Most likely not. The typ-
ical designer, whether Web or print, will most
likely never need the advanced tools that sep-
arate Standard from Extended.
But if you’re into 3D, life sciences, manufactur-
ing, or the medical field, you may want to take
advantage of the 3D, counting, and analysis
tools now available in Photoshop.

Smart Filters
151
Super Selection Tools and Features
If you want the ability to paint your selections, you’ll love the new Quick
Selection tool. With this tool, you can easily brush over the image area that
you want to select. By default, additional strokes with the Quick Selection
tool add to the selection. You can delete by holding down Alt (Option on a
Mac) as you stroke. The toolbar provides more options, including New
Selection, Add To Selection, and Subtract From Selection buttons.
The new Refine Edge button, available from any of the selection tool’s
options, is quite helpful in cleaning up selections or adding feathering to
create a vignette of a selection. All of these options are available in a preview
window that includes choices for five different ways to preview the selec-
tion, as shown in Figure 1-2. (Read more detail about selections in Chapter 4
of this minibook.)
Smart Filters
Photoshop CS3 has taken nondestructive imaging editing to the max with
Smart filters. Don’t worry about destroying your image with filters because
you can now edit filters after they’re applied. When you use a Smart Filter, a
Filter effects mask thumbnail appears in the Layer’s palette. You can select
the mask thumbnail and then, using your paint tools, paint black (or shades
of) to change where and how the filter is applied, or paint white to bring
back the filter.
You can turn off the Smart Filters by selecting the visibility icon in the Layers
palette or adjust filter settings by double-clicking the icon to the right of the
listed filter. It’s worth experimenting with this feature because you can apply
multiple filters. Read more about applying filters in Chapter 8 of this minibook.

Black-and-White Conversion like a Pro
152
Black-and-White Conversion like a Pro
Photoshop CS3 makes creating great-looking black-and-white images easier.
With an image open, you can click the Create New Fill or Adjustment Layer
button in the Layers palette and then select Black & White. The Black and
White dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 1-3. Choose a preset, or cus-
tomize the color conversion by using the Channel mixer adjustments. If
you’re converting multiple images, you can save your settings by selecting
the Preset options button to the right of the Presets drop-down menu. If you
want to experiment with more creative options, use the Tint box and add a
color tint to your image as it’s converted.
Multiple Planes in Vanishing Point Filter
In Photoshop CS3, you can create images wrapped around multiple perspec-
tive planes, which is great if you’re creating package design or needing spa-
tial illustrations. To experiment with this incredible feature:
1. Copy an image and choose Filter➪Vanishing Point.
The Vanishing Point dialog box appears.
2. Using the Create Plane tool, click four corners to make a perspective
plane.
Note that the plane is accurate if the grid is blue.

3. If the grid isn’t blue, use the Edit Plane tool to adjust the corners.
4. Hold down the Ctrl key (Windows) and drag one of the middle nodes.
An additional perspective plane, generated from the original, appears.
5. Paste your image and drag it into your plane.
The image wraps the planes (see Figure 1-4).
Even better, Vanishing Point adjusts brush strokes, healing, and cloning as
you paint over the planes. Note that in Photoshop CS3, you’re no longer
restricted to adding planes at 90-degree angles.
Help with Aligning
Ever take several versions of a picture and wish that you could easily combine
and align the images to pick the best of each? With the new Align feature,
you can do just that:
1. Drag similar images into a file to create layers.
These images may be several versions of a group picture, for example.
2. Select the Move tool and Shift+click to select the multiple layers.
3. Click the Auto-Align Layers button in the options bar.
The Auto-Align Layers dialog box appears.
4. Choose your alignment method and click OK.

If you know that you should use Curves, but like the interface of the Level
controls, the improved curve controls are a dream come true. Read about
using the Curves palette in Chapter 7 of this minibook.
Performance Improvements on Intel Macintosh
If you’re a Macintosh user, you’ll appreciate that Adobe has done a great
job at porting the software to the Intel-based processors. As a Universal
application, the software can run in a native mode on both Intel and
PowerPC Macintosh systems. As part of our testing, we’ve been using both
PC and Macintosh systems, both using Intel Core2 Duo processors. The per-
formance is strong on both platforms. Most noticeable is the huge speed
improvement between Photoshop CS3 running on an Intel-based Macintosh
and Photoshop CS2 running on the same system.
Before Photoshop CS3, the Intel-based Macintosh computers had to interpret
the software so that it could be used because the earlier versions of software
weren’t made for the Intel processors but for the PowerPC processors in the
last generation of Macintosh systems. This release of Photoshop CS3 has
been developed to run efficiently on either legacy or new Macintosh comput-
ers, regardless of the processor.
Compared to earlier versions of Photoshop running on the Intel-based
Macintosh systems, Photoshop CS3 is blazing fast. And if you still have an
older Macintosh system with a PowerPC processor, Photoshop CS3 still
runs on these computers as well.
Additional Features in Photoshop Extended
If you have Photoshop CS3 Extended, it’s probably because you purchased
the Master or one of the Premium Suites, or because you’re in the medical,
architecture, manufacturing, or construction business. Photoshop CS3
Extended isn’t necessarily a better version of Photoshop, but it does contain
additional tools to help those users in certain industries get the counting,
viewing, and analysis tools that they need to do their job. As a designer, you
may never need the Counting tool, but it can be invaluable to someone in
manufacturing.

Additional Features in Photoshop Extended
155
Some features are in Photoshop Standard, but are enhanced in Photoshop
Extended. For example, although you have animation in the Standard ver-
sion, you see a timeline in the Extended version that has a higher level of
functionality. The following sections are by no means a complete list of
Extended features, but a quick look at some incredibly different features that
have been included in Photoshop CS3 Extended.
3D Layers
For those involved in 3D graphics, Photoshop Extended is a great tool.
You don’t build 3D elements in Photoshop, but you can take advantage 
of 3D model visualization and texture editing and export of 3D models from
2D images. Support for common 3D interchange formats lets you import 3D
models, edit their textures, and easily composite designs with images, such
as site photographs.
You can freely rotate and manipulate these models in 3D space in a Photoshop
document. Access the textures applied to the model surfaces and edit them
with the full range of tools in Photoshop CS3 Extended. You can even create
3D models from 2D images, by defining perspective planes in an image with
Vanishing Point and then exporting the model to a 3D format.
Due to the scope of this book, we don’t discuss 3D features in detail, but you
can get step-by-step information by choosing Help➪Photoshop Help.
New Video Layers and Movie Paint
Now with the new video layers and the Animation (Timeline) palette,
Photoshop CS3 Extended offers a great new feature for video professionals,
Movie Paint. Movie Paint brings the power of Photoshop painting, retouch-
ing, and pixel level editing to every frame of a movie file. Using the
Animation palette to navigate, you can quickly find and edit any frame of the
movie file. Due to the advanced level of this feature, we don’t cover the
Animation (Timeline) palette in this book.
Comprehensive Image Analysis
Physicians, radiologists, and technicians using Photoshop? Absolutely,
thanks to the new selection, measurement, and analysis tools that let them
quickly extract and export a wide array of quantitative data from micro-
scopic and radiological images (see Figure 1-5).

Additional Features in Photoshop Extended
156
Photoshop Extended provides users with tools to count, rulers that can be
recorded in a measurement log, and other high-end analysis tools.

 Discovering Photoshop
 Organizing your palette
 Changing screen modes
N
avigating the work area in Photoshop can be slightly cumbersome at
first, especially if you’ve never worked in a program that relies so
heavily on palettes. In this chapter, we introduce you to Photoshop CS3
and show you how to do basic tasks, such as opening and saving an image.
We also introduce you to the work area, show you what the Photoshop CS3
tools are all about, and reveal how to neatly organize and hide palettes.
Getting Started with Photoshop CS3
Unless you use Photoshop as a blank canvas for painting, you may rarely
create a new file in Photoshop because you usually have a source image that
you start with. This image may have been generated by a scanner, digital
camera, or stock image library. You can open existing Photoshop images
by choosing File➪Open, selecting the file in the Open dialog box, and then
clicking the Open button.
Photoshop can open a multitude of file formats, even if the image was cre-
ated in another application, such as Illustrator or another image-editing 
program, but you have to open the image in Photoshop by choosing
File➪Open. If you just double-click an image file in a directory (one that
wasn’t originally created in Photoshop, or from different versions), the
image may open only in a preview application.
If you’re opening a folder of images that you want to investigate first, choose
File➪Browse to open Adobe Bridge, the control center for Adobe Creative
Suite. You can use Adobe Bridge to organize, browse, and locate the assets
you need to create your content. Adobe Bridge keeps native PSD, AI, INDD,
and Adobe PDF files, as well as other Adobe and non-Adobe application
files, available for easy access.

Getting Started with Photoshop CS3
158
Adobe Bridge is a standalone application that you can access from all appli-
cations in the Creative Suite by choosing File➪Browse or by clicking the Go
To Bridge icon in the upper-right corner of the application window. Use the
Bridge interface to view your images as thumbnails and look for Metadata
information. 
Creating a new file
If you’re creating a new file, you may be doing so to create a composite of
existing files or to start with a blank canvas because you’re super creative.
Discover Camera Raw
If you haven’t discovered the Camera Raw
capabilities in Adobe Photoshop, you’ll want to
give them a try. Camera Raw is a format avail-
able for image capture in many cameras. Simply
choose the format in your camera’s settings as
Raw instead of JPEG or TIFF. These raw files
are a bit larger than the standard JPEG files, but
you capture an enormous amount of data with
the image that you can retrieve upon opening.
(See www.adobe.com for a complete list of
cameras supporting Camera Raw.)
A camera raw file contains unprocessed picture
data from a digital camera’s image sensor, along
with information about how the image was cap-
tured, such as the camera and lens used, the
exposure settings, and white balance setting.
When you open the file in Adobe Photoshop
CS3, the built-in Camera Raw plug-in interprets
the raw file on your computer, making adjust-
ments for image color and tonal scale.
When you shoot JPEG images with your
camera, you’re locked into the processing done
by your camera, but working with camera raw
files gives you maximum control over your
image, such as controlling the white balance,
tonal range, contrast, and color saturation, as
well as image sharpening. Cameras that can
shoot in RAW format have a setting on the
camera that changes its capture mode to RAW.
Instead of writing a final JPEG, a RAW data file
is written, which consists of black-and-white
brightness levels from each of the several mil-
lion pixel sites on the imaging sensor. The
actual image hasn’t yet been produced, and
unless you have specific software, such as the
plug-in built into Adobe Photoshop, opening the
file can be very difficult, if not impossible.
To open a camera raw file, simply choose File➪
Browse. Adobe Bridge opens, and you see sev-
eral panels, including the Folders, Content,
Preview, and Metadata panels. Using the
Folders panel, navigate to the location on your
computer where you have saved your Camera
Raw images; thumbnail previews appear in the
Content panel. Think of camera raw files as
your photo negative. You can reprocess the file
at any time to achieve the results you want.
If Adobe Photoshop CS3 doesn’t open your raw
file, you may need to update your raw plug-in.
(See www.adobe.com for the latest plug-in.)
The plug-in should be downloaded and placed
in this location in Windows: C:\Program
Files\Common Files\Adobe\Plug-Ins\CS3\File
Formats, and this location on the Macintosh:
Library\Application Support\Adobe\Plug-Ins\
CS3\File Formats.

For whatever reason, note that when you choose File➪New, you have a mul-
titude of basic format choices that you can select from the Preset menu.
They range from basic sizes and resolutions, such as U.S. Paper or Photo, to
other final output such as the Web, Mobile Devices, or Film.
Keep in mind that you’re determining not only size but resolution in your
new file. If your new file is to contain images from other files, make sure the
new file is the same resolution. Otherwise, you may get unexpected size
results when cutting and pasting or dragging images into your new file.
Choose Image➪Image Size to see the document dimensions.
Saving documents
Save an image file by choosing File➪Save. If you’re saving the file for the
first time, the Save As dialog box appears. Notice in the Format drop-
down list that you have plenty of choices for file formats. The different
file formats are discussed in more detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook.
You can always play it safe by choosing the Photoshop (PSD) file format.
The native Photoshop format supports all features in Photoshop. Choosing
some of the other formats may eliminate layers, channels, and other special
features.
Many users choose to save a native Photoshop file as a backup to any
other file formats. It’s especially important to have a backup or original
file saved as a native Photoshop file (PSD) as you increase in capabilities
and start taking advantage of layers and the other great capabilities of
Photoshop.
Getting to Know the Tools
Tools are used to create, select, and manipulate objects in Photoshop CS3.
When you open Photoshop, the toolbox appears along the left edge of the
workspace (see Figure 2-1). We discuss palettes and the palette well in the
upcoming section, “Navigating the Work Area.”
In the toolbox, look for the name of the tool to appear in a ToolTip when
you hover the cursor over the tool. Following the tool name is a letter in
parentheses, which is the keyboard shortcut command that you can use
to access that tool. Simply press the Shift key along with the key command
you see to access any hidden tools. In other words, pressing P activates
the Pen tool, and pressing Shift+P activates the hidden tools under the
Pen tool in the order that they appear. When you see a small triangle at
the lower-right corner of the tool icon, you know that this tool contains
hidden tools.

Navigating the Work Area
Getting around in Photoshop isn’t much different from getting around in
other Adobe applications. All Adobe applications make extensive use of
palettes, for example. In the following sections, we cover the highlights on
navigating in Photoshop.
Docking and saving palettes
Palettes, palettes everywhere . . . do you really need them all? Maybe not
just yet, but as you increase your skill level, you’ll take advantage of most
(if not all) of the Photoshop palettes. The palettes give you easy access to
important functions.
As you work in Photoshop, keep in mind these two key commands:

Book II
Chapter 2
Getting into
Photoshop CS3
Basics
Navigating the Work Area
163
✦Press Tab to switch between hiding and showing the tools and palettes.
✦Press Shift+Tab to hide the palettes, leaving only the toolbox visible.
On the far right of the Options bar (a toolbar that contains the options for
each tool and appears across the top of the work area) is the palette well,
which helps you organize and manage palettes. The palette well stores, or
docks, palettes so that you can access them easily. (See Figure 2-1, earlier in
this chapter.)
The palette well is available only when using a screen resolution greater
than 800 x 600 pixels (a setting of at least 1024 x 768 is recommended). Dock
palettes in the palette well by dragging the palette’s tab into the palette well;
release when the palette well is highlighted.
If you find that you’re always using the same palettes, hide the palettes that
you don’t need and arrange your other palettes on-screen where you want
them. Then follow these steps to save that palette configuration:
1. Choose Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace.
2. In the Save Workspace dialog box that appears, name the Workspace
and click Save.
3. Any time you want the palettes to return to your saved locations, choose
Window➪Workspace➪Name of Your Workspace (where Name of
Your Workspace is the name you supplied in Step 2).
Choose Window➪Workspace➪Reset Palette Locations to put the palettes
back in the same order they were upon the initial installation.
Taking advantage of new workspace features
Photoshop CS3 now has included many saved workspaces that you can take
advantage of to streamline workspaces and open the palettes you need for
specific tasks. These new features include workspaces for Web Design,
Painting and Retouching, and Color and Tonal Correction to name a few.
Increase your work area by turning your palettes into icons, as shown in
Figure 2-2. Do so by either right-clicking the tab of a palette and selecting
Collapse To Icons or clicking the Auto Collapse gray bar at the top of the
palette drawer. Yes, you heard it correctly — the area where the palettes are
located is actually a drawer that can be adjusted in or out by clicking and
dragging on the vertical pane to the left of the palettes.

Navigating the Work Area

Zooming in to get a better look
What looks fine at one zoom level may actually look very bad at another.
You’ll find yourself zooming in and out quite often as you work on an image
in Photoshop. You can find menu choices for zooming in the View menu; a
quicker way to zoom is to use the keyboard commands listed in Table 2-2.

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you work with the Zoom tool to get
a better look at your work:
✦100-percent view: Double-clicking the Zoom tool in the toolbox puts you
at 100 percent view. Do this before using filters to see a more realistic
result of your changes.
✦Zoom marquee: Drag from the upper left to the lower right of the area
you want to zoom to. While dragging, a marquee appears; When you

Choosing Your Screen Mode
165
release the mouse button, the marqueed area zooms up to fill the image
window. The Zoom marquee gives you much more control than just
clicking on the image with the Zoom tool. Zoom back out to see the entire
image by pressing Ctrl+0. It fits the entire image in the viewing area.
✦Zoom using the keyboard shortcuts: If you have a dialog box open and
you need to reposition or zoom to a new location on your image, you
can use the keyboard commands without exiting the dialog box.
✦A new window for a different look: Choose Window➪Arrange➪
New Window to create an additional window for your front-most image.
This technique is helpful when you want to see the entire image (say, at
actual size)or to see the results as a whole, yet zoom in to focus on a
small area of the image to do some fine-tuning. The new window is
dynamically linked to the original window so that as you make changes,
the original and any other new windows created from the original are
immediately updated.
✦Cycle through images: Press Ctrl+Tab to cycle through open images.
Choosing Your Screen Mode
You have a choice of three screen modes in which to work. Most users start
and stay in the default (standard screen mode) until they accidentally end
up in another. The four modes are
✦Maximized Screen mode displays a maximized document window that
fills all available space between docks and that resizes when dock
widths change.
✦Standard mode is the typical view, where you have an image window
open but can see your desktop and other images open behind.
✦Full-screen mode with menu view surrounds the image out to the edge
of the work area with a neutral gray. This mode not only prevents you
from accidentally clicking out of an image and leaving Photoshop, but
also from seeing other images behind your working image.
✦Full screen mode, no menu is a favorite with multimedia types. It shows
your image surrounded by black and also eliminates the menu items
from the top of the window. Press Tab to hide all tools, and you have a
very clean work environment.

Cropping an Image
166
Cropping an Image
A simple but essential task is to crop your image. Cropping means to elimi-
nate all that is not important to the composition of your image. Cropping is
especially important in Photoshop. Each pixel, no matter what color, takes
up the same amount of information, so cropping eliminates unneeded pixels
and saves on file size and processing time, so you want to crop your image
before you start working on it.
You can crop an image in Photoshop CS3 in two ways:
✦Use the Crop tool.
✦Select an area with the Marquee tool and choose Image➪Crop.
To crop an image by using the Crop tool, follow these steps:
1. Press C to access the Crop tool and drag around the area of the image
that you want to crop to.
2. If you need to adjust the crop area, drag the handles in the crop-
bounding area.
3. When you’re satisfied with the crop bounding area, double-click in
the center of the crop area or press the Return or Enter key to crop
the image.
4. If you want to cancel the crop, press the Esc key.
Ever scan in an image crooked? When using the Crop tool, if you position the
cursor outside any of the handles, a rotate symbol appears. Drag the crop’s
bounding area to rotate it and line it up as you want it cropped. When you
press Return or Enter, the image is straightened out. 

Chapter 3: Messing 
with Mode Matters
In this Chapter
 Working in black and white
 Understanding Photoshop image modes
B
efore diving into Photoshop, you must know what image mode you
should be working in and how important color settings are. So no
matter whether you’re doing a one-color newsletter, a full-color logo, or
something in between, this chapter can help you create much better
imagery for both Web and print.
Working with Bitmap Images
You may have already discovered that Photoshop works a little differently
than most other applications. In order to create those smooth gradations
from one color to the next, Photoshop takes advantage of pixels. Bitmap
images (sometimes called raster images) are based on a grid of pixels. The
grid is smaller or larger depending on the resolution that you’re working in.
The number of pixels along the height and width of a bitmap image are called
the pixel dimensions of an image, which are measured in pixels per inch
(ppi). The more pixels per inch, the more detail in the image.
Unlike vector graphics (mathematically created paths), bitmap images can’t
be scaled without losing detail. (See Figure 3-1 for an example of a bitmap
image and a vector graphic.) Generally, it’s best to use bitmap images at or
close to the size that you need. If you resize a bitmap image, it can become
jagged on the edges of sharp objects. On the other hand, you can scale
vector graphics and edit them without degrading the sharp edges.
Photoshop has the capability to work on both bitmap and vector art. (See
the path line around the vector shape layer and notice that the path isn’t
pixilated.) It gives you, as a designer, incredible opportunities when combin-
ing the two technologies.

Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
168
For information on changing and adjusting image resolution, see Chapter 6
of this minibook.
Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
Choose Image➪Mode to view the image mode choices you can choose from.
Selecting the right one for an image is important because each mode offers
different capabilities and results. For example, if you choose the Bitmap
mode, you can work only in black and white . . . that’s it. No shades of color,
not even a gray. Most features are disabled in this Bitmap mode. This is fine
if you’re working on art for a black-and-white logo, but not for most images.
If, instead, you work in the RGB mode, you have full access to Photoshop’s
capabilities. So read on to see what image mode is best for your needs.
When you’re ready to make your mode selection, have a file open and
choose a selection from Image➪Mode. You can read descriptions of each
image mode in the following sections.
Along with a description of each image mode, we include a figure showing
the Channels palette set to that mode. A channel is simply the information
about color elements in the image. The number of default color channels in
an image depends on its color mode. For example, a CMYK image has at
least four channels, one each for cyan, magenta, yellow, and black informa-
tion. Grayscale has one channel. If you understand the printing process,
think of each channel representing a plate (color) that, when combined, 
creates the final image.
Bitmap
Bitmap mode offers little more than the ability to work in black and white.
Many tools are unusable, and most menu options are grayed out in this
mode. If you’re converting an image to bitmap, you must convert it to
Grayscale first.
Figure 3-1:
Bitmap

vector.

Chapter 3
Messing with 
Mode Matters
Choosing the Correct Photoshop Mode
169
Grayscale
Use Grayscale mode, shown in Figure 3-2, if you’re creating black-and-white
images with tonal values, specifically for printing to one color. Grayscale
mode supports 256 shades of gray in the 8-bit color mode. Photoshop can
work with Grayscale in 16-bit mode, which provides more information, but
may limit your capabilities when working in Photoshop.
When you convert to Grayscale mode, you get a warning message confirming
that you want to discard all color information. If you don’t want to see this
warning every time you convert an image to grayscale, select the option to
not show the dialog box again before you click Discard.
Duotone
Use Duotone mode when you’re creating a one- to four-color image created
from spot colors (solid ink, such as Pantone colors). You can also use the
Duotone mode to create Monotones, Tritones, and Quadtones. If you’re pro-
ducing a two-color job, duotones create a beautiful solution to not having
full color.
The Pantone Matching color system helps to keep printing inks consistent
from one job to the next. By assigning a numbered Pantone color, such as
485 for red, you don’t risk one vendor (printer) using fire-engine red, and the
next using orange-red for your company logo.

To create a Duotone, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Mode➪Grayscale.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Duotone.
3. In the Duotone dialog box, choose Duotone from the Type drop-
down list.
Your choices range from Monotone (one-color) up to Quadtone (four-
color). Black is automatically assigned as the first ink. But you can
change that if you like.
4. To assign a second ink color, click the white swatch immediately
under the black swatch to open the Color Libraries dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-3.
5. Now comes the fun part: Type (quickly!) the Pantone or PMS number
that you want to access and then click OK.
There is no text field for you to enter the number in, so don’t look for
one. Just type the number while the Color Libraries dialog box is open.
Try entering 300 for an easy one. That selects PMS 300.
6. You can already see that you have created a tone curve, but click the
Curve button to the left of the ink color to further tweak the colors.
7. Click and drag the curve to adjust the black in the shadow areas, per-
haps to bring down the color overall; experiment with the results.
8. (Optional) If you like your Duotone settings, store them by clicking
the Save button.

Click the Load button to find your customized presets and to find preset
Duotones, Tritones, and Quadtones supplied to you by Adobe.
Duotone images must be saved in the Photoshop EPS format in order to
support the spot colors. If you chose another format, you risk the possi-
bility of converting your colors into a build of CMYK (Cyan, Magenta,
Yellow, and Black.)
9. Click OK when you’re finished.
Index color
You may not work in Index color, but you probably have saved a file in this
mode. Index color mode (see Figure 3-4) uses a color look-up table (CLUT) in
order to create the image.
A color look-up table contains all the colors that make up your image, like a
box of crayons used to create artwork. If you have a box of eight crayons
and only those crayons are used to color an image, you have a color look-up
table of only eight colors. Of course, your image would look much better if
you used the 64-count box of crayons with the sharpener on the back, but
those additional colors increase the size of the color look-up table, as well as
the file size.
The most colors that can be in index mode are 256. When saving Web
images, you often have to define a color table. We discuss the Save For Web
feature (which helps you to more accurately save an index color image) in
Chapter 10 of this minibook.

Choose Image➪Mode➪Color Table to see the color table making up an

RGB
RGB (Red, Green, Blue), shown in Figure 3-5, is the standard format that you
work in if you import images from a digital camera or you scan images on a
scanner in RGB mode. For complete access to features, RGB is probably the
best color mode to work in. If you’re working on images for use on the Web,
color copiers, desktop color printers, and on-screen presentations, you want
to stay in the RGB mode.
If you’re having your image printed on a press (for example, if you’re having
the image professionally printed), it must be separated. Don’t convert
images to CMYK mode until you’re finished with the color correction and
you know that your color settings are accurate. A good print service may
want the RGB file so that it can do an accurate conversion.
CMYK
CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) is the mode used for final separations
for the press. Use a good magnifying glass to look closely at anything that
has been printed in color, and you may see the CMYK colors that created it.
A typical four-color printing press has a plate for each color and runs the
colors in the order of cyan, magenta, yellow, and then black.
Don’t take converting an image into this mode lightly. You need to make deci-
sions when you convert an image to CMYK, such as where the file is going to
be printed and on what paper stock, so that the resulting image is the best it
can be. Talk to your print provider for specifications that are important
when converting to CMYK mode.

Lab color
Lab (Lightness, A channel, and B channel) is a color mode that many high-
end color professionals use because of its wide color range. Using Lab, you
can make adjustments to luminosity (lightness) without affecting the color.
In this mode, you can select and change an L (Lightness or Luminosity)
channel without affecting the A channel (green and red) and the B channel
(blue and yellow).
Lab mode is also a good mode to use if you’re in a color-managed environ-
ment and want to easily move from one color system to another with no loss
of color.
Some professionals prefer to sharpen their images in LAB mode because
they can select just the Lightness channel and choose Filter➪Sharpen➪
Unsharp Mask to sharpen only the gray matter of the image, leaving the
color noise-free.
Multichannel
Multichannel is used for many things; sometimes you end up in this mode,
and you’re not quite sure how. Deleting a channel from an RGB, CMYK, or
Lab image automatically converts the image to Multichannel mode. This
mode supports multiple spot colors.
Bit depth
You have more functionality in 16-bit and even 32-bit mode. Depending upon
your needs, you may spend most of your time in 8-bit mode, which is more
than likely all that you need.
Bit depth, also called pixel depth or color depth, measures how much color
information is available to display or print each pixel in an image. Greater bit
depth means more available colors and more accurate color representation
in the digital image. In Photoshop, this increase in accuracy does also limit
some of the features available, so don’t use it unless you have a specific
request or need for it.
To use 16-bit or 32-bit color mode, you also must have a source to provide
you with that information, such as a scanner or camera that offers a choice
to scan at 16-bit or 32-bit.

I
t’s common to use Photoshop to create compositions that may not actu-
ally exist and to retouch images to improve them. What you don’t want is
obvious retouching or a composition that looks contrived. (The exception is
if you intend an image to be humorous, such as putting baby Joey’s head on
Daddy’s body.)
That’s where the selection tools come in. In this chapter, you discover several
selection methods and how to use the selection tools to make your images
look as though you haven’t retouched or edited them. Even if you’re an experi-
enced Photoshop user, this chapter provides a plethora of tips and tricks that
can save you time and help make your images look absolutely convincing.
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
You create selections with the selection tools. Think of selections as windows
in which you can make changes to the pixels. Areas that aren’t selected
are masked, which means that these unselected areas are unaffected by
changes, much like when you tape around windows and doors before you
paint the walls. In this section, we briefly describe the selection tools and
show you how to use them. You must be familiar with these tools in order to
do anything in Photoshop.
As with all the Photoshop tools, the Options bar across the top of the
Photoshop window changes with each selection tool. The keyboard com-
mands you read about in this section exist on the Options bar as buttons.
If you move a selection with the Move tool, pixels move as you drag, leaving
a blank spot in the image. To clone a selection (that is, to copy and move the
selection at the same time), Alt+drag (Option+drag on a Mac) the selection
with the Move tool.

Getting to Know the Selection Tools
176
The Marquee tool
The Marquee tool is the main selection tool; by that, we mean that you’ll use
it most often for creating selections. The exception, of course, is when you
have a special situation that calls for a special tool, either the Lasso, Magic
Wand tool, or the new Quick Selection tool. Throughout this section, we
describe creating (and then deselecting) an active selection area; we also
provide you with tips for working with selections.
The Marquee tool includes the Rectangular Marquee (for creating rectangular
selections), Elliptical Marquee (for creating round or elliptical selections),
and Single Row Marquee or Single Column Marquee tools (for creating a
selection of a single row or column of pixels). You can access these other
Marquee tools by holding down on the default, Rectangle Marquee tool.
To create a selection, select one of the Marquee tools (remember you can
press M) and then drag anywhere on your image. When you release the
mouse button, you create an active selection area. When you’re working on
an active selection area, whatever effects you choose are applied to the
whole selection. To deselect an area, you have three choices:
✦Choose Select➪Deselect.
✦Press Ctrl+D.
✦While using a selection tool, click outside the selection area.
How you make a selection is important because it determines how realistic
your edits appear on the image. You can use the following tips and tricks
when creating both rectangular and elliptical selections:
✦Add to a selection by holding down the Shift key; drag to create a
second selection that intersects the original selection (see the left image
in Figure 4-1). The two selections become one big selection.
✦Delete from an existing selection by holding the Alt (Option on a Mac)
key and then drag to create a second selection that intersects the origi-
nal selection where you want to take away from the original selection
(on the right in Figure 4-1).
✦Constrain a rectangle or ellipse to a square or circle by Shift+dragging;
make sure that you release the mouse button before you release the
Shift key. Holding down the Shift key makes a square or circle only when
there are no other selections. (Otherwise, it adds to the selection.)
✦Make the selection from the center by Alt+dragging (Option+dragging on
a Mac); make sure that you release the mouse button before the Alt or
(Option) key.

Book II
Chapter 4
Creating a Selection
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
177
✦Create a square or circle from the center out by Alt+Shift+dragging
(Option+Shift+dragging on a Mac). Again, make sure that you always
release the mouse button before the modifier keys.
✦When making a selection, hold down the spacebar before releasing the
mouse button to drag the selection to another location.
Fixed size
If you’ve created an effect that you particularly like — say, changing a block
of color in your image — and you’d like to apply it multiple times throughout
an image, you can do so. To make the exact same selection multiple times,
follow these steps:
1. With the Marquee tool selected, select Fixed Size from the Style drop-
down list on the Options bar.
You can also select Fixed Ratio from the Style drop-down list to create a
proportionally correct selection, but not fixed to an exact size.
2. On the Options bar, type the Width and Height values into the appro-
priate text fields.
You can change ruler increments by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪
Units And Rulers (Photoshop➪Preferences➪Units And Rulers on a Mac).
3. Click the image.
A selection sized to your values appears.
4. With the selection tool, drag the selection to the location that you
want selected.
Figure 4-1:
You can add
and delete
from
selections.

Getting to Know the Selection Tools
178
Shift+drag a selection to keep it aligned to a straight, 45-degree, or 90-degree
angle.
Floating and nonfloating selections
As a default, when you’re using a selection tool, such as the Marquee tool,
your selections are floating, which means that you can drag them to another
location without affecting the underlying pixels. You know that your selection
is floating by the little rectangle that appears on your cursor (see the left
image in Figure 4-2).
If you want to, however, you can move the underlying pixels. With the selection
tool of your choice, just hold down the Ctrl (Ô on a Mac) key to temporarily
access the Move tool; the cursor changes to a pointer with scissors, denot-
ing that your selection is nonfloating. Now, when you drag, the pixel data
comes with the selection (as shown on the right in Figure 4-2).
Hold down Alt+Ctrl (Option+Ô on a Mac) while using a selection tool and drag
to clone (copy) pixels from one location to another. Add the Shift key, and
the cloned copy is constrained to a straight, 45-degree, or 90-degree angle.
The Lasso tool
Use the Lasso tool for freeform selections (selections of an irregular shape).
To use the Lasso tool, just drag and create a path surrounding the area to be
selected. If you don’t return to your start point to close the selection before
you release the mouse button, Photoshop completes the path by finding the
most direct route back to your starting point.

icon is used
on the left,

Just like with the Marquee tool, you can press the Shift key to add to a lasso
selection and press the Alt (Option on a Mac) key to delete from a lasso
selection.
Hold down on the Lasso tool to show the hidden Lasso tools, the Polygonal
Lasso and the Magnetic Lasso tool. Use the Polygonal Lasso tool by clicking
on a start point and then clicking and releasing from point to point until you
come back to close the selection. Use the Magnetic Lasso tool by clicking to
create a starting point and then hovering the cursor near an edge in your
image. The Magnetic Lasso tool is magnetically attracted to edges; as you
move your cursor near an edge, the Magnetic Lasso tool creates a selection
along that edge. Click to manually set points in the selection; when you get
back to the starting point, click to close the selection.
You may find that the Polygonal Lasso and the Magnetic Lasso tools don’t
make as nice of a selection as you’d like. Take a look at the upcoming sec-
tion, “Painting with the Quick Mask tool,” for tips on making finer selections.
The new Quick Selection tool
The Quick Selection tool lets you quickly “paint” a selection using a round
brush tip of adjustable size. Click and drag and watch as the selection
expands outward and automatically follows defined edges in the image.
A Refine Edge command lets you improve the quality of the selection
edges and visualize the selection in different ways for easy editing.
Follow these steps to find out how you can take advantage of this new tool:
1. Start by choosing File➪Open and opening a file named Sunflower.psd
that already exists in your Photoshop CS3 Samples folder.
You can find the file in the following location on the Windows OS at
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Samples and on the
Mac OS at Applications\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Samples.
2. Select the Quick Selection tool.
3. Position the cursor over the yellow petals of the sunflower and notice
the brush size displayed with the cursor; click and drag to start paint-
ing the selection.
You can adjust the size of the painting selection by pressing [ to make
the brush size smaller or ] to make the brush size larger.
4. Using the Add To Selection or Subtract From Selection buttons in the
toolbar options, you can paint more of the selection or deselect active
areas (see Figure 4-3).

The Magic Wand tool
The Magic Wand tool is particularly helpful when you’re working on an
image of high contrast or with a limited number of colors. This tool selects
individual pixels of similar shades and colors. Select the Magic Wand tool,
click anywhere on an image, and hope for the best — the Magic Wand tool
isn’t magic at all. You decide how successful this tool is. What we mean by
that is that you control how closely matched each pixel must be in order for
the Magic Wand tool to include it in the selection. You do so by setting the
tolerance on the Options bar.
When you have the Magic Wand tool selected, a Tolerance text field appears
on the Options bar. As a default, the tolerance is set to 32. When you click
with a setting of 32, the Magic Wand tool selects all pixels within 32 shades
(steps) of the color that you clicked. If it didn’t select as much as you want,
increase the value in the Tolerance text field (all the way up to 255). The
amount that you enter really varies with each individual selection. If you’re
selecting white napkins on an off-white tablecloth, you can set as low as 5 so
that the selection doesn’t leak into other areas. For colored fabric with lots
of tonal values, you might increase the tolerance to 150.
Figure 4-3:
The Quick
Selection
tool allows
you to paint

Don’t fret if you miss the entire selection when using the Magic Wand tool.
Hold down the Shift key and click in the missed areas. If it selects too much,
choose Edit➪Undo (Step Backwards) or press Ctrl+Z, reduce the value in the
Tolerance text field, and try again.
Manipulating Selections
After you master creating selections, you’ll find that working with the 
selections — painting, transforming, and feathering them — can be easy
and fun.
Painting with the Quick Mask tool
If you have fuzzy selections (fur, hair, or leaves, for example) or you’re having
difficulty using the selection tools, the Quick Mask tool can be a huge help
because it allows you to paint your selection uniformly in one fell swoop.
To enter into Quick Mask mode, create a selection and then press Q.
(Pressing Q again exits you from Quick Mask mode.) You can also click the
Quick Mask button at the bottom of the toolbox. If you have a printing back-
ground, you’ll notice that the Quick Mask mode, set at its default color (red),
resembles something that you may want to forget: rubylith and amberlith.
(Remember slicing up those lovely films with Exacto blades before computer
masking came along?) In Quick Mask mode, Photoshop shows your image as
it appears through the mask. The clear part is selected; what’s covered in
the mask isn’t selected.
To create and implement a quick mask, follow these steps:
1. Press Q to enter Quick Mask mode.
2. Press D to change the foreground and background color boxes the
default colors of black and white.
3. Select the Brush tool and start painting with black in the clear area of
the image in Quick Mask mode.
It doesn’t have to be pretty; just get a stroke or two in there.
4. Press Q to return to the Selection mode.
You’re now out of Quick Mask mode. Notice that where you painted with
black (it turned red in the Quick Mask mode), the pixels are no longer
selected.
5. Press Q again to re-enter the Quick Mask mode and then press X.
This step switches the foreground and background colors (giving you
white in the foreground, black in the background).

Manipulating Selections
182
6. Using the Brush tool, paint several white strokes in the red mask area.
The white strokes turn clear in the Quick Mask mode.
7. Press Q to return to the Selection mode.
Where you painted white in the Quick Mask mode is now selected.
When in Quick Mask mode, you can paint white over areas you want selected
and black over areas that you don’t want selected. When painting in the
Quick Mask mode, increase the brush size by pressing the ] key. Decrease
the brush size by pressing the [ key.
In the Selection mode, your selection seems to have a hard edge; you can
soften those hard edges by using a softer brush in the Quick Mask mode. To
make a brush softer, press Shift+[ and press Shift+] to make a brush harder.
Because the Quick Mask mode makes selections based on the mask’s values,
you can create a mask by selecting the Gradient tool and dragging it across
the image in Quick Mask mode. When you exit Quick Mask mode, it looks as
though there is a straight-line selection, but actually the selection transitions
as your gradient did. Choose any filter from the Filters menu and notice how
the filter transitions into the untouched part of the image to which we
applied the new and improved Graphic Pen filter.
If you’re working in Quick Mask mode, choose Window➪Channels to see that
what you’re working on is a temporary alpha channel. See the later section,
“Saving Selections,” for more about alpha channels.
Transforming selections
Don’t deselect and start over again if you can just nudge or resize your selec-
tion a bit. You can scale, rotate, and even distort an existing selection.
Follow these steps to transform a selection:
1. Create a selection and then choose Select➪Transform Selection.
You can use the bounding box to resize and rotate your selection.
• Drag the handles to make the selection larger or smaller. Drag a
corner handle to adjust width and height simultaneously. Shift+drag
a corner handle to size proportionally.
• Position the cursor outside of the bounding box to see the Rotate
icon; drag when it appears to rotate the selection. Shift+drag to con-
strain to straight, 45-degree, or 90-degree angles.
• Ctrl+drag (Ô+drag on a Mac) a corner point to distort the selection,
as shown in Figure 4-4.
2. Press Return or Enter or double-click in the center of the selection
area to confirm the transformation; press Esc to release the transfor-
mation and return to the original selection.

Feathering
Knowing how to retouch an image means little if you don’t know how to
make it discreet. If you boost up the color using curves to the CEO’s face,
do you want it to appear like a pancake has been attached to his cheek?
Of course not — that isn’t discreet at all (or very wise). That’s where 
feathering comes in. Feathering a selection blurs its edges, so as to create a
natural-looking transition between the selection and the background of the
image.
To feather an image, follow these steps:
1. Create a selection.
For the nonfeathered image shown on top in Figure 4-5, we used the
Elliptical Marquee tool to make a selection. We then copied the selec-
tion, created a new, blank image, and pasted the selection into the new
image.
To create the feathered image on the bottom in Figure 4-5, we used the
Elliptical Marquee tool to select the same area on the original image and
went on to Step 2.
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather.
3. In the Feather dialog box that appears, type a value in the Feather
Radius text field and then click OK.
For example, we entered 20 in the Feather Radius text field. (We then
copied the selection, created a new image, and pasted the feathered
selection into the new image to create the image on the bottom of
Figure 4-5.) Voilà! The edges of the image are softened over a 20-pixel
area, as shown on the bottom of Figure 4-5. This technique is also
referred to as a vignette in the printing industry.

The results of the feathering depend upon the resolution of the image. A
feather of 20 pixels in a 72-ppi (pixels per inch) image will be a much larger
area than a feather of 20 pixels in a 300-ppi image. Typical amounts for a nice
vignette on an edge of an image would be 20 to 50 pixels. Experiment with
your images to find what works best for you.
This feathering effect created a nice soft edge to your image, but it’s also
useful when retouching images:
1. Using any selection method, create a selection around a part of an
image that you want to lighten.
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather; in the Feather dialog box that
appears, enter 25 in the Feather Radius text field and click OK.
If you get an error message stating, No Pixels are more than 50% selected,
click OK and create a larger selection.
3. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Curves.
4. Click in the center of the curve to add an anchor point and drag up to
lighten the image.
This step lightens the midtones of the image.
Notice how the lightening fades out so that there is no definite edge to the
correction. You can have more fun like this in Chapter 7 of this minibook,
where we cover color correction.
Saving Selections
The term alpha channel sounds pretty complicated, but it’s simply a saved
selection. Depending upon the mode you’re in, you already have several
channels to contend with. A selection is just an extra channel that you can
call on at any time.
To create an alpha channel, follow these steps:
1. Create a selection that you want to save.
2. Choose Select➪Save Selection.
3. Name the Selection and click OK.
In the Channels palette is an additional named channel that contains
your selection.

Using the New Vanishing Point Feature
186
To load a saved selection, follow these steps:
1. Choose Select➪Load Selection.
The Load Selection dialog box appears.
2. Select your named channel from the Channel drop-down list.
If you have an active selection and then choose to load a selection, you
have additional options. You can do the following with an active selec-
tion when loading a channel by selecting one of the following options:
• New Selection: Eliminate the existing selection and create a new
selection based upon the channel you select.
• Add To Selection: Add the channel to the existing selection.
• Subtract From Selection: Subtract the channel from the existing
selection.
• Intersect With Selection: Intersect the channel with the existing
selection.
3. Click OK.
Other Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Illustrator, Premiere, and After
Effects, can also recognize alpha channels.
Using the New Vanishing Point Feature
This incredible new feature lets you preserve correct perspective in edits
of images that contain perspective planes, such as the sides of a building.
You can do so much with this feature, and we provide you with a simple
introduction. Try experimenting with multiple planes and copying and 
pasting items into the Vanishing Point window for even more effects.
Follow these steps:
1. Open a file that you want to apply a perspective filter to.
For this example, we used the file named Vanishing Point.psd. 
You can find the file in Windows OS at C:\Program Files\Adobe\
Adobe Photoshop CS3\Samples and on the Mac OS at Applications\
Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS3\Samples.
2. Create a new blank layer by clicking the Create A New Layer button at
the bottom of the Layers palette.
If you create a new layer each time you use Vanishing Point, the results
appear on a separate, editable layer. You can then use layer features,

Book II
Chapter 4
Creating a Selection
Using the New Vanishing Point Feature
187
such as opacity, layer styles, and blending modes. Putting the Vanishing
Point results in a separate layer also preserves your original image.
3. Choose Filter➪Vanishing Point.
A separate Vanishing Point window appears. If you receive an error mes-
sage about an existing plane, click OK.
If you’re using a sample file from Photoshop, it may or may not have the
plane at release time. To help you understand this feature better, you
should delete the existing plane by pressing the Delete or Backspace key.
4. Select the Create Plane tool and define the four corners nodes of the
plane surface.
Try to use objects in the image to help create the plane.
After the four corner nodes of the plane are created, the tool automati-
cally is switched to the Edit Plane tool.
5. Select and drag the corner nodes to make an accurate plane.
The plane grid should appear blue, not yellow or red, if it’s accurate.
After creating the plane, you can move, scale, or reshape the plane. Keep
in mind that your results depend on how accurately the plane lines up
with perspective of the image.
You can use your first Vanishing Point session to simply creating perspec-
tive planes and then click OK. The planes appear in subsequent Vanishing
Point sessions when you choose Filter➪Vanishing Point. Saving perspec-
tive planes is especially useful if you plan to copy and paste an image
into Vanishing Point and need to have a ready-made plane to target.
6. Choose the Stamp tool in the Vanishing Point window and then choose
On from the Heal drop-down menu in the options bar.
You’re going to love where this is going. In the example, we simply clone
the blue broom, but it should get your brains working about all the ways
that you can apply this greatly improved feature.
7. With the Stamp tool still selected, cross over the middle part of the
broom and Alt+click (Option+Click on a Mac) to define it as the source
that is to be cloned.
8. Without clicking, move toward the back of the perspective plane and
click and drag to reproduce the cloned part of the image, in this case
the broom.
Notice that it’s cloned as a smaller version, in the correct perspective
for its new location.

Using the New Vanishing Point Feature
188
9. Start from Step 7 and clone the broom in front of the dog or clone any
region of an image up closer to the front of the perspective pane.
The cloned region is now cloned as a larger version of itself.
You can use the Marquee tool options (Feather, Opacity, Heal, and Move
Mode) at any time, either before or after making the selection. When you
move the Marquee tool, the Stamp tool, or the Brush tool into a plane,
the bounding box is highlighted, indicating that the plane is active.
10. Click OK.
To preserve the perspective plane information in an image, save your
document in PSD, TIFF, or JPEG format.

We recommend that you use the Pen tool as much as you can to truly master
its capabilities. If you don’t use it on a regular basis, it will seem awkward,
but it does get easier! Knowing how to effectively use the Pen tool puts you
a grade above the average Photoshop user, and the quality of your selections
will show it. Read Chapter 9 of this minibook to find out how to use the Pen
tool to create layer masks and adjustment layers.
Using Shape Layers
As a default, when you start creating with the Pen tool, Photoshop automati-
cally creates a shape layer, which is useful for adding additional elements,
but is frustrating if you’re attempting to create just a path with the Pen tool.
Select the Pen tool and note the default setting on the left side of the
Options bar. You can choose from the following options:
✦Shape layers: Creates a new shape layer, a filled layer that contains
your vector path.
✦Paths: Creates a path only; no layer is created.
✦Fill Pixels: Creates pixels directly on the image. No editable path or
layer is created. This option may not be useful to new users, but some
existing users prefer to use this method because it’s the only way to
access the Line tool from previous versions.

Using Shape Layers
190
Shape layers can be very useful when the goal of your design is to seam-
lessly integrate vector shapes and pixel data. A shape layer can contain
vector shapes that you can then modify with the same features of any other
layer. You can adjust the opacity of the shape layer, change the blending
mode, and even apply layer effects to add drop shadows and dimension.
Find out how to do this in Chapter 9 of this minibook.
Create a shape layer using any of these methods:
✦Create a shape with the Pen tool. With the Pen tool, you can create
interesting custom shapes and even store them for future use. We show
you how in the following section.
✦Use one of the Vector Shape tools shown in Figure 5-1. Vector shapes
are premade shapes (you can even create your own!) that you can create
by dragging on your image area with a shape tool.
✦Import a shape from Illustrator. Choose File➪Place to import an
Illustrator file as a shape layer or path into Photoshop.
Creating and using a custom shape
Perhaps you like the wave kind of shape (see Figure 5-2) that has been crop-
ping up in design pieces all over the place.

Copy and paste shapes right from Illustrator CS3 to Photoshop CS3. Simply
select your shape in Adobe Illustrator and choose Edit➪Copy, then switch to
the Photoshop application, and with a document open, choose Edit➪Paste.
You can create a wavy shape like that, too. With an image or blank document
open, just follow these steps:
1. Click and drag with the Pen tool to create a wavy shape.
Don’t worry about the size of the shape. The shape is vector, so you can
scale it up or down to whatever size you need without worrying about
making jagged edges. Just make sure that you close the shape (return
back to the original point with the end point).
As you create the shape, it fills in with your foreground color. Try to ignore
it if you can; the next section shows you how to change the fill color, and
Chapter 8 of this minibook covers how to change it to a transparent fill.
2. With the shape still selected, choose Edit➪Define Custom Shape, name
the shape, and click OK.
After you have saved your custom shape, you can recreate it at any
time. If you don’t like the shape, choose Windows➪Layers to open the
Layers palette and then drag the shape layer you just created to the
Trash icon in the lower-right corner of the palette. If you’d like to 
experiment with your custom shape now, continue with these steps.
3. Click and hold on the Rectangle tool to access the other hidden vector
tools; select the last tool, the Custom Shape Tool.
When the Custom Shape tool is selected, a Shape drop-down menu
appears on the Options bar at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 5-3.
You have lots of custom shapes to choose from, including the one you’ve
just created. If you just saved a shape, yours is in the last square; you
have to scroll down to select it.

4. Select your custom shape; click and drag in the image area to create
your shape.
You can make it any size that you want.
5. To change the shape’s size, choose Edit➪Free Transform Path, press
Ctrl+T (Ô+T on a Mac), or grab a bounding box handle and drag.
Shift+drag a corner handle to keep the shape proportional as you resize it.
Because a shape is created on its own layer, you can experiment with 
different levels of transparency and blending modes in the Layers palette.
Figure 5-4 shows shapes that are partially transparent. Discover lots of other
features you can use with shape layers in Chapter 9 of this minibook.
Changing the color of the shape
When you create a shape with a shape tool, the shape takes the color of your
present foreground color. To change the color of an existing shape, open the
Layers palette by choosing Window➪Layers; notice that the Vector Shape
tool creates a new layer for every shape you make. Creating a new layer is a
benefit when it comes to creating special effects because the shape layer is
independent of the rest of your image. (Read more about using layers in
Chapter 9 of this minibook.)
To change a shape’s color, double-click the color thumbnail, on the left in the
shape layer. The Color Picker appears, as shown in Figure 5-5. To select a
new color, drag the Hue slider up or down or click in the large color pane
to select a color with the saturation and lightness that you want to use.
Click OK when you’re done.

Editing a shape
Like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop provides both a Path Selection tool and
a Direct Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool is hidden under the Path
Selection tool. To move an entire shape on a layer, choose the Path Selection
tool and drag the shape.
To edit the shape, deselect the shape (while using the Path Selection or
Direct Selection tool, click outside the shape). Then select the Direct
Selection tool. With the Direct Selection tool, click individual anchor points
and handles to edit and fine-tune the shape, as shown in Figure 5-6.
Removing a shape layer
Because the Pen tool now has multiple options, you may find yourself 
unexpectedly creating a shape layer. Delete a shape layer by dragging the
layer thumbnail to the Trash icon in the lower-right corner of the Layers
palette.

Using a Path as a Selection
194
If you want to keep your path but throw away the shape layer, choose
Window➪Paths. Then drag the shape vector mask to the New Path icon, as
shown in Figure 5-7, which creates a saved path. Now you can throw away
the shape layer.
Using a Path as a Selection
You can use the Pen tool to create precise selections that would be difficult
to create with other selection methods. The Pen tool produces clean edges
that print well and can be edited using the Direct Selection tool. Before
using the Pen tool, make sure that you click the Paths button on the
Options bar.
To use a path as a selection (which is extremely helpful when you’re trying
to make a precise selection), follow these steps:
1. Open any file, or create a new blank file.
2. Using the Pen tool (make sure that the Paths button is selected on the
Options bar or else you will create a Shape layer!), click to place
anchor points; drag to create a curved path around the image area
that you want selected; and completely close the path by returning to
the start point (see Figure 5-8).
Use the techniques that we discuss in Book IV, Chapter 4 to perform this
step. A circle will appear before you click to close the path.
3. Choose Window➪Paths.

In the Paths palette, you can create new and activate existing paths,
apply a stroke, or turn paths into selections by clicking the icons at the
bottom of the palette (see Figure 5-9).
4. Click the Load Path As Selection icon.
The path is converted into a selection.
Use this quick and easy method for turning an existing path into a selection:
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on a Mac) the path thumbnail in the Paths palette.

Clipping Paths
196
Clipping Paths
If you want to create a beautiful silhouette that transfers well to other appli-
cations for text wrapping (see Figure 5-10), create a clipping path.
Creating a clipping path is easy when you have a good path! Just follow
these steps:
1. Use the Pen tool to create a path around the image area that is to be
the silhouette.
2. In the Paths palette, choose Save Path from the palette menu (click the
triangle in the upper-right corner of the palette to access this menu),
as shown in Figure 5-11, and then name the path.
(If Save Path isn’t an option, your path has already been saved; skip to
Step 3.)
3. From the same palette menu, choose Clipping Path.

4. In the Clipping Paths dialog box, choose your path from the drop-
down list if it’s not already selected; click OK.
Leave the Flatness Device Pixels text field blank unless you have a need
to change it. The flatness value determines how many device pixels are
used to create your silhouette. The higher the amount, the less points
are created, thereby allowing for faster processing time. This speed
does come at a cost, though; set the flatness value too high, and you
may see (you’d have to look really close) straight edges instead of
curved edges.
5. Choose File➪Save As and in the Format drop-down list, select Photoshop
EPS; in the EPS Options dialog box that appears, accept the defaults
and click OK.
If you get PostScript errors when printing, choose Clipping Path from the
palette menu and up the value to 2 pixels in the Flatness Device Pixels
text field. Keep returning to this text field and upping the value until
the file prints, or give up and try printing your document with another
printer.
If you’re placing this file in other Adobe applications, such as InDesign,
you don’t need to save the file as EPS; you can leave it as a Photoshop
(.psd) file.

Resolution Basics

S
omething as important as getting the right resolution for your images
deserves its own chapter, but fortunately, the topic isn’t all that complex.
In this chapter, you discover the necessary resolution for various uses of
Photoshop imagery (from printing a high-resolution graphic to e-mailing a
picture of your kids to Mom), how to properly increase the resolution, and
how to adjust image size.
Having the proper resolution is important to the final outcome of your
image, especially if you plan to print that image. Combine the information
here with using the correction tools that we show you in the next chapter,
and you should be ready to roll with great imagery.
Creating Images for Print
To see and make changes to the present size and resolution of an image
in Photoshop, choose Image➪Image Size. The Image Size dialog box
appears.
The Width and Height text fields in the Pixel Dimensions area of the Image
Size dialog box are used for on-screen resizing, such as for the Web and
e-mail. The Width and Height text fields in the Document Size area show the
size at which the image will print. The Resolution text field determines the
resolution of the printed image; a higher value means a smaller, more finely
detailed printed image.

Creating Images for Print
200
Before you decide upon a resolution, you should understand what some of
the resolution jargon means:
✦dpi (dots per inch): The resolution of an image when printed.
✦lpi (lines per inch): The varying dot pattern that printers and presses
use to create images (see Figure 6-1). This dot pattern is referred to as
the lpi, even though it represents rows of dots. The higher the lpi, the
finer the detail, and the less of the dot pattern or line screen you see.
✦Dot gain: The spread of ink as it’s applied to paper. Certain types of
paper will wick a dot of ink farther than others. For example, newsprint
has a high dot gain and typically prints at 85 lpi; a coated stock paper
has a lower dot gain and can be printed at 133–150 lpi and even higher.
Human eyes typically can’t detect a dot pattern in a printed image at 133 dpi
or higher.
Deciding the resolution or dpi of an image requires backward planning. If you
want to create the best possible image, you should know where it will print
before deciding the resolution. Communicate with your printer service if the
image is going to press. If you’re sending your image to a high-speed copier,
you can estimate that it will handle 100 lpi; a desktop printer will handle 85
lpi to 100 lpi.
The resolution formula
When creating an image for print, keep this formula in mind:
2 x lpi = dpi (dots per inch)
Figure 6-1:
The dot
pattern used
to print
images is
referred to
as lpi (lines
per inch).

Book II
Chapter 6
Thinking about
Resolution Basics
Creating Images for Print
201
This formula means that if your image is going to press using 150 lpi, have
your image at 300 dpi. To save space, many designers use 1.5 x lpi and get
pretty much the same results; you can decide which works best for you.
Changing the resolution
Using the Image Size dialog box is only one way that you can control the 
resolution in Photoshop. Even though you can increase the resolution, do so
sparingly and avoid it if you can. The exception is when you have an image
that is large in dimension size but low in resolution, like those that you typi-
cally get from a digital camera. You may have a top-of-the-line digital camera
that produces 72 dpi images, but at that resolution, the pictures are 28 x 21
inches (or larger)!
To increase the resolution of an image without sacrificing quality:
1. Choose Image➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-3.
2. Deselect the Resample Image check box.
This way, Photoshop doesn’t add additional pixels.
3. Enter the desired resolution in the Resolution text field.
Photoshop keeps the pixel size (the size of the image on screen) the
same, but the document size (the size of the image when printed)
decreases when you enter a higher resolution.
4. If the image isn’t the size that you need it to be, select the Resample
Image check box and type the size in the Width and Height text fields
in the Document Size section.
Note that it’s best to reduce the size of a bitmap image, such as a digital
photo, rather than increase it.
You can also deselect the Resample Image check box and essentially
play a game of give and take to see what the resolution will be when you
enter the size you want your image printed at in the Width and Height
text fields in the Document Size area.
Images can typically be scaled from 50 to 120 percent before looking
jagged (to scale by a percentage, select Percent from the drop-down lists
beside the Width and Height text fields). Keep this in mind when placing
and resizing your images in a page layout application, such as InDesign.
5. Click OK when you’re finished; double-click the Zoom tool in the tool-
box to see the image at actual size on-screen.

Determining the Resolution for Web Images
202
To increase the resolution without changing the image size, follow these
steps. (This situation isn’t perfect because pixels that don’t presently exist
are created by Photoshop and may not be totally accurate. Photoshop tries
to give you the best image, but you may have some loss of detail.)
1. Choose Image➪Image Size.
2. When the Image Size dialog box appears, make sure that the
Resample Image check box is selected.
Note that Bicubic is selected in the method drop-down list. This method
is the best, but slowest, way to reinterpret pixels when you resize an
image. Using this method, Photoshop essentially looks at all the pixels
and takes a good guess as to how the newly created pixels should look,
based upon surrounding pixels.
3. Enter the resolution that you need in the Resolution text field, click OK,
and then double-click the Zoom tool to see the image at actual size.
Determining the Resolution for Web Images
Did you ever have somebody e-mail you an image, and, after spending
10 minutes downloading it, you discover that the image is so huge that all
you can see on the monitor is your nephew’s left eye? Many people are
under the misconception that if an image is 72 dpi, it’s ready for the Web.
Actually, pixel dimension is all that matters for Web viewing of images; this
section helps you make sense of this.
Most people view Web pages in their browser windows in an area of about
640 x 480 pixels. You can use this figure as a basis for any images you create
for the Web, whether the viewer is using a 14-inch or a 21-inch monitor.
(Remember, those people who have large monitors set to high screen resolu-
tions don’t necessarily want a Web page taking up the whole screen!) If you’re
creating images for a Web page or to attach to an e-mail message, you may
want to pick a standard size to design by, such as 600 x 400 pixels at 72 dpi.
To use the Image Size dialog box to determine the resolution and size for on-
screen images, follow these steps:
1. Have an image open and choose Image➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears.
2. To make the image take up half the width of a typical browser
window, type 300 (half of 600) in the top Width text field.
If a little chain link is visible to the right, the Constrain Proportions
check box is selected, and Photoshop automatically determines the
height from the width that you entered.

3. Click OK and double-click the Zoom tool to see the image at actual
size on-screen.
That’s it! It doesn’t matter whether your image is 3,000 or 30 pixels wide,
as long as you enter the correct dimensions in the Pixel Dimension area,
the image works beautifully.
Applying the Unsharp Mask Filter to an Image
When you resample an image in Photoshop, it can become blurry. A good
practice is to apply the Unsharp Mask filter. This feature sharpens the
image based upon levels of contrast, while keeping the areas that don’t have
contrasting pixels smooth. You do have to set up this feature correctly to get
good results. Here is the down-and-dirty method of using the Unsharp Mask
filter:
1. Choose View➪Actual Pixels or double-click the Zoom tool.
When you’re using a filter, you want to view your image at actual size to
best see the effect.
2. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
In the Unsharp Mask dialog box that appears, set these three options:
• Amount: The Amount value ranges from 0 to 500. The amount that
you choose has a lot to do with the subject matter. Sharpening a car
or appliance at 300 to 400 is fine, but do this to the CEO’s 75-year-old
wife, and you may suffer an untimely death because every wrinkle,
mole, or hair will magically become more defined. If you’re not sure
what to use, start with 150 and play around until you find an Amount
value that looks good.
• Radius: The Unsharp Mask filter creates a halo around the areas that
have enough contrast to be considered an edge. Typically, leaving
the amount between 1 to 2 is fine for print, but if you’re creating a
billboard or poster, increase the size.
• Threshold: This option is the most important one in the Unsharp
Mask dialog box. The Threshold setting is what determines what
should be sharpened. If left at zero, you’ll see noise throughout the
image, much like the grain that you see in high-speed film. Bring it up
to 10, and this triggers the Unsharp Mask filter to apply only the
sharpening when the pixels are ten shades or more away from each
other. The amount of tolerance ranges from 1 to 255. Apply too
much, and no sharpening appears; apply too little, and the image
becomes grainy. A good number to start with is 10.

Applying the Unsharp Mask Filter to an Image
204
To compare the original state of the image with the preview of the
Unsharp Mask filter’s effect in the preview pane of the Unsharp Mask
dialog box, click and hold on the image in the Preview pane; this shows
the original state of the image. When you release the mouse button, the
unsharp mask is previewed again.
3. When you’ve made your choice, click OK.
The image appears to have more detail.
Once in a while, stray colored pixels may appear after you apply the
Unsharp Mask filter. Get in the habit of choosing Edit➪Fade Unsharp Mask
immediately after applying the Unsharp Mask filter. In the Fade dialog box,
select the Luminosity blend mode from the Mode drop-down list and then
click OK. This step applies the Unsharp Mask filter to the grays in the image
only, thereby eliminating sharpening of colored pixels.
New in Photoshop CS3 you can use smart filters. Smart filters allow you to
undo, all or some of any filter, including sharpening filters, that you apply to
a layer. Find out how by reading Chapter 8 in this minibook.

ith all the incredible things you can do in Photoshop, you can easily
forget the basics. Yes, you can create incredible compositions with
special effects, but if the people look greenish, it detracts from the image.
Get in the habit of building good clean images before heading into the artsy
filters and fun things. Color correction isn’t complicated, and if done properly,
it will produce magical results in your images. In this chapter, you discover
how to use the values you read in the Info palette and use the Curves dialog
box to produce quality image corrections.
Reading a Histogram
Before making adjustments, look at the image’s histogram, which displays an
image’s tonal values, to evaluate whether the image has sufficient detail to
produce a high-quality image. In Photoshop CS3, choose Window➪Histogram
to display the Histogram palette.
The greater the range of values in the histogram, the greater the detail.
Poor images without much information can be difficult, if not impossible,
to correct. The Histogram palette also displays the overall distribution of
shadows, midtones, and highlights to help you determine which tonal cor-
rections are needed.
Figure 7-1 shows a good full histogram that indicates a smooth transition
from one shade to another in the image. Figure 7-2 shows that when a his-
togram is spread out and has gaps in it, the image is jumping too quickly
from one shade to another, producing a posterized effect. Posterization is an
effect that reduces tonal values to a limited amount, creating a more defined
range of values from one shade to another. Great if you want it, yucky if you
want a smooth tonal change from one shadow to another.
So how do you get a good histogram? If you’re scanning, make sure that
your scanner is set for the maximum amount of colors. Scanning at 16
shades of gray gives you 16 lines in your histogram . . . not good!

Reading a Histogram
206
If you have a bad histogram, we recommend that you rescan or reshoot the
image. If you have a good histogram to start with, keep the histogram good
by not messing around with multiple tone correction tools. Most professionals
use the Curves feature . . . and that’s it. Curves (choose Image➪Adjustments➪
Curves), if used properly, do all the adjusting of levels (brightness and con-
trast) and color balance, all in one step. You can read more about curves in
the section “Creating a Good Tone Curve,” later in this chapter.
Figure 7-3 shows what happens to a perfectly good histogram when someone
gets a little too zealous and uses the entire plethora of color correction con-
trols in Photoshop. Just because the controls are there doesn’t mean that
you have to use them.

If you see a Warning icon appear while you’re making adjustments, double-
click anywhere on the histogram to refresh the display.
Breaking into key types
Don’t panic if your histogram is smashed all the way to the left or right. The
bars of the histogram represent tonal values. You can break down the types
of images, based upon their values, into three key types:
✦High key: A very light-colored image, such as the image shown in
Figure 7-4. Information is pushed toward the right in the histogram.
Color correction has to be handled a little differently for these images
to keep the light appearance to them.
✦Low key: A very dark image, such as the image shown in Figure 7-5.
Information is pushed to the left in the histogram. This type of image is
difficult to scan on low-end scanners because the dark areas tend to
blend together with little definition.

✦Mid key: A typical image with a full range of shades would be consid-
ered mid key, such as the image shown in Figure 7-6. These images are
the most common and easiest to work with. In this chapter, we deal with
images that are considered mid key.
Setting up the correction
To produce the best possible image, try to avoid correcting in CMYK mode.
If your images are typically in RGB or LAB mode, keep them in that mode
throughout the process. Convert them to CMYK only when you’re finished
manipulating the image.
Figure 7-6:

image with

of values is

Don’t forget! Press Ctrl+Y (Ô+Y on a Mac) to toggle on and off the CMYK pre-
view so that you can see what your image will look like in CMYK mode with-
out converting it!
Set up these items before starting any color correction:
1. Select the Eyedropper tool; on the Options bar, change the sample size
from Point Sample to 3 By 3 Average in the Sample Size drop-down list.
The Eyedropper tool is hidden in the Count Tool if you have Photoshop
Extended.
This setting gives you more accurate readings.
2. If the Histogram palette isn’t already visible, choose
Window➪Histogram.
3. If the Info palette isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Info to show
the Info palette so that you can check values.
4. Make sure that your color settings are correct.
If you’re not sure how to check or set up color settings, see Chapter 3 of
this minibook.
Creating a Good Tone Curve
A tone curve represents the density of an image. To get the best image, you
must first find the highlight and shadow points in the image. An image cre-
ated in less-than-perfect lighting conditions may be washed out or have odd
color casts. See Figure 7-7 for an example of an image with no set highlight
and shadow. Check out Figure 7-8 to see an image that went through the
process of setting a highlight and shadow.
Figure 7-7:
The image
is murky
before
defining a

and shadow.

Creating a Good Tone Curve
210
To make the process of creating a good tone curve more manageable, we’ve
broken the process into four parts:
✦Finding the highlight and shadow
✦Setting the highlight and shadow
✦Adjusting the midtone
✦Finding a neutral
Even though each part has its own set of steps, you must go through all four
parts to accomplish the task of creating a good tone curve (unless you’re
working with grayscale images, in which case you can skip the neutral part).
In this example, an Adjustment layer is used for the curve adjustments.
The benefit is that you can turn off the visibility of the adjustment at a later
point or double-click the adjustment layer thumbnail to make ongoing edits
without destroying your image.
Finding and setting the highlight and shadow
In the noncomputer world, you’d spend a fair amount of time trying to locate
the lightest and darkest part of an image. Fortunately, you can cheat in
Photoshop by using some of the new features in the Curves palette.
Here’s how you access the palette:
1. With an image worthy of adjustment — meaning one that isn’t
perfect already — choose Window➪Layer (if the Layers palette
isn’t already open).

The Curves palette, shown in Figure 7-9, appears.
Notice the grayed-out histogram behind the image Curve window. The his-
togram aids you in determining where you need to adjust the image’s curve.
If you’re correcting in RGB (as you should be!), the tone curve may be oppo-
site of what you think it should be. Instead of light to dark displaying as you’d
expect, RGB displays dark to light. Now think about it: RGB is generated with
light, and no RGB means that there is no light and you therefore have black.
Turn all RGB on full force, and you create white. Try pointing three filtered
lights, one red, one green, and one blue. The three lights pointed in one
direction really do create white.
If working with RGB confuses you, simply click on the Pigment/Ink% check
box, shown in Figure 7-10. The sample in this example uses the curve based
upon pigment.

Note that in the new Curves palette, you see a Preset drop-down menu that
offers quick fixes using standard curves for certain corrections. These set-
tings are great for quick fixes, but for the best image, you should create a
custom curve.
The first thing you need to do in the Curves palette is determine the lightest
and darkest part of the image, which is referred to as locating the highlight
and shadow:
1. To help you see where the highlight and shadow are in the image,
check the Show Clipping check box.
2. Grab the right modify curve slider, shown in Figure 7-11, and slide it
until you start to see white appear.
Coincidently, the white should appear where you see your histogram
(grayed out in the curves palette) begin.

Adjusting the midtone
You may have heard the statement, “Open up the midtones.” This phrase
essentially means that you’re lightening the midtonal values of an image.
In many cases, opening up the midtones is necessary to add contrast and
bring out detail in your image.
To adjust the midtones, follow these steps:
1. In the Curves dialog box, click the middle of the curve ramp to create
an anchor point; drag up slightly.
The image lightens. (If you’re in Pigment/Ink % mode, drag down to
lighten the image.) Don’t move a dramatic amount and be very careful
to observe what is happening in your Histogram palette (which you
should always have open when making color corrections).
Because you set highlight and shadow (see preceding section) and are
now making a midtone correction, you see the bars in the histogram
spreading out. The spreading of the information is necessary to a point,
and it’s the reason why you don’t click OK until all steps have been taken
in the Curves dialog box.
2. To adjust the three-quarter tones (the shades around 75 percent), click
halfway between the bottom of the curve ramp and the midpoint to
set an anchor point.
Use the grid in the Curves dialog box to find it easily. (In Pigment/Ink %,
the three-quarter point is in the upper section of the color ramp.) Adjust
the three-quarter area of the tone curve up or down slightly to create
contrast in the image. Again, keep an eye on your histogram!
3. If you’re working on a grayscale image, your tonal correction is done,
and you can click OK.
If you’re working on a color image, don’t click OK; keep the Curves
dialog box open for the final step, which is outlined in the next section.
Finding a neutral
The last step in creating a tone curve only applies if you’re working on a
color image. The key to understanding color is knowing that equal amounts
of color create gray. By positioning the mouse cursor over gray areas in an
image and reading the values in the Info palette, you can determine what
colors you need to adjust.
1. With your Curves dialog box open, position it so that you can see the
Info palette.
If the Info palette is buried under another palette or a dialog box, choose
Window➪Info to bring it to the front.

Book II
Chapter 7
Creating a 
Good Image
Using an Adjustment Layer
215
2. Position your cursor over your image and, in the Info palette, look for
the RGB values in the upper-left section.
You see color values and then forward slashes and more color values.
The numbers before the slash indicate the values in the image before
you opened the Curves dialog box; the numbers after the slash show the
values now that you have made changes in the Curves dialog box. Pay
attention to the values after the slashes.
3. Position the cursor over something gray in your image.
It can be a shadow on a white shirt, a counter top, a road — anything
that is a shade of gray. Look at the Info palette. If your image is perfectly
color balanced, the RGB values following the forward slashes should all
be the same.
4. If your color isn’t balanced, click the Set Gray Point Eyedropper in the
Curves dialog box and click the neutral or gray area of the image.
The middle eyedropper (Set Gray Point) is a handy way of bringing the
location that you click on closer together in RGB values, thereby balanc-
ing the colors.
5. Now you can click OK; if you’re asked whether you want to save your
color target values, click Yes.
Curves can be as complex or simple as you make them. As you gain more
confidence using them, you can check neutrals throughout an image to
ensure that all unwanted color casts are eliminated. You can even individu-
ally adjust each color’s curve by selecting them from the Channel drop-down
list in the Curves dialog box.
When you’re finished with color correction, using the Unsharp Mask filter on
your image is a good idea. Chapter 5 of this minibook shows you how to use
this filter.
Using an Adjustment Layer
You may go through a curve adjustment only to discover that some areas of
the image are still too dark or too light. If this is the case, you’re better off
using an adjustment layer, which is a layer that adjusts a selected area of
your image, based upon a correction applied on the layer. By using an adjust-
ment layer, you can turn off the correction or change it over and over again
with no degradation to the quality of the image. You can apply an adjustment
layer by following these steps:
1. Select the area of the image that needs adjustments.
See Chapter 4 of this minibook if you need a refresher on how to make
selections in Photoshop.

Using an Adjustment Layer
216
2. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather to soften the selection.
The Feather dialog box appears.
3. Enter a value into the Feather dialog box.
If you’re not sure what value will work best, enter 15 in the Feather
Radius text field and click OK.
4. If the Layers palette isn’t visible, choose Windows➪Layers; click and
hold on the Create New Fill Or Adjustment Layer icon and select
Curves from the menu that appears.
5. In the Curves dialog box, click the middle of the curve ramp to create
an anchor point; drag up or down to lighten or darken your selected
area and click OK.
Notice in the Layers palette (see Figure 7-13) that your adjustment layer,
named Curves 2, has a mask to the right of it. The selected area is white;
unselected areas are black.
6. With your adjustment layer selected in the Layers palette, use the
Brush tool to paint white to apply the correction to other areas of the
image; paint with black to exclude areas from the correction.
You can even change the opacity using the Brush tool Options bar at the
top to apply only some of the correction!

Testing a Printer
If you go through all the work of making color corrections to your images
and you still get printed images that look hot pink, it may not be you! Test
your printer by following these steps:
1. Create a neutral gray out of equal RGB values (double-click the Fill
Color swatch in the toolbar).
2. Create a shape, using your neutral gray as the fill color.
For example, you can use the Ellipse tool to create a circle or oval.
3. Choose File➪Print and click OK to print the image from your color
printer.
If you’re seeing heavy color casts, you need to adjust your printer; cleaning
or replacing the ink cartridge may fix the problem. Check out Chapter 10 of
this minibook for more about printing your Photoshop files.

In This Chapter
 Using the Swatches palette
 Getting to know foreground and background colors
 Introducing painting and retouching tools
 Discovering blending modes
T
his chapter shows you how to use the painting and retouching tools in
Photoshop. If you’re unsure about how good the painting you’re about
to do will look, create a new layer and paint on that. (See Chapter 9 of this
minibook to find out how to create and use layers.) That way, you can delete
the layer by dragging it to the Trash icon (at the bottom of the Layers palette)
if you decide that you don’t like what you have done. Don’t forget to make the
Eraser tool your friend! You can also repair painting or retouching mistakes
by Alt+dragging (Option+dragging on a Mac) with the Eraser tool selected to
erase the last version saved or present history state.
Have fun and be creative! Because Photoshop is pixel-based, you can create
incredible imagery with the painting tools. Smooth gradations from one
color to the next, integrated with blending modes and transparency, can
lead from super-artsy to super-realistic effects. In this chapter, you discover
painting fundamentals, and we show you how to use retouching tools to
eliminate wrinkles, blemishes, and scratches. Don’t you wish you could do
that in real life?
Using the Swatches Palette
Use the Swatches palette to store and retrieve frequently used colors. The
Swatches palette allows you to quickly select colors.
The Swatches palette also gives you access to many other color options. By
using the palette menu, you can select from a multitude of different color
schemes, such as Pantone or Web-safe color sets. These color systems are
converted to whatever color mode in which you’re working.

Choosing Foreground and Background Colors
220
To sample and then store a color for later use, follow these steps:
1. To sample a color from an image, select the Eyedropper tool in the
toolbox and click a color on the image.
Alternatively, you can use any of the paint tools (the Brush tool for
example) and Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac).
The color you click becomes the foreground color.
2. Store the color in the Swatches palette by clicking the New Swatch
button at the bottom of the Swatches palette.
Anytime you want to use that color again, simply click it in the Swatches
palette to make it the foreground color.
Choosing Foreground and Background Colors
At the bottom of the toolbox reside the foreground and background color
swatches. The foreground color is the color that you apply when using any of
the painting tools. The background color is the color that you see if you erase
or delete pixels from the image.
Choose a foreground or background color by clicking the swatch, which
opens the Color Picker dialog box. To use the color picker, you can either
enter values in the text fields on the right, or you can slide the hue slider.
Pick the hue (color) that you want to start with and then click in the color
pane to the left to choose the amount of light and saturation (grayness or
brightness) you want in the color. Select the Only Web Colors check box to
choose one of the 216 colors in the Web safe color palette. The hexadecimal
value used in HTML documents appears in the text field in the lower right of
the color picker.
New in Photoshop CS3, you can click the Add To Swatches button right in
the Color Picker to save a color for future use.
The Painting and Retouching Tools
Grouped together in the toolbox are the tools used for painting and retouch-
ing. The arrow in the lower right of a tool indicates that the tool has more
related hidden tools; simply click and hold on the tool to see additional

painting and retouching tools. In this chapter, we show you how the Spot
Healing Brush, Healing Brush, Patch, Red Eye, Brush, Clone Stamp, History
Brush, Eraser, and Gradient tools work. You also discover ways to fill shapes
with colors and patterns.
Changing the brush
As you click to select different painting tools, note the Brush menu, second
from the left, on the Options bar, as shown in Figure 8-1. Click the arrow to
open the Brush Picker. You can use the Master Diameter slider to make the
brush size larger or smaller, as well as change the hardness of the brush.
The hardness refers to how “fuzzy” the edges are; a softer brush is more
feathered and soft around the edges, while a harder edge would be more def-
inite with a harder edge (see Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-1:
The Brushes
Preset

The Spot Healing Brush Tool
222
Don’t feel like accessing the Brushes palette every time you want to make a
change? Press the right bracket ] several times to make your brush diameter
larger or press the left bracket [ to make the brush diameter smaller. Press
Shift+ ] to make the brush harder or Shift+[ to make the brush softer.
Choose Window➪Brushes to see a list of Brush presets, plus many more
brush options that you can use to create custom brushes. You can also
choose other brush libraries using the palette menu (click the triangle in the
upper-right corner of the Brushes Preset Picker). When you select an addi-
tional library, a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to replace the
current brushes with the brushes in the selected library. Click the Append
button to keep existing brushes and add the library to the list, or click OK to
replace the existing brushes.
Access the Brushes Preset Picker as you’re painting by right-clicking (Ctrl+
clicking on a Mac) anywhere in the image area. Double-click a brush to select
it; press Esc to hide the Brushes palette.
The Spot Healing Brush Tool
The Spot Healing Brush tool is destined to become everyone’s favorite.
Who wouldn’t love a tool that can remove years from your face and any
blemishes, too?
The Spot Healing Brush tool quickly removes blemishes and other imperfec-
tions in your images. Click a blemish and watch it paint matching texture,
lighting, transparency, and shading to the pixels being healed. The Spot
Healing Brush doesn’t require you to specify a sample spot. The Spot
Healing Brush automatically samples from around the retouched area.

The Patch Tool
223
The Healing Brush Tool
You can use the Healing Brush tool for repairs, such as eliminating scratches
and dust from scanned images. The difference between the Spot Healing
Brush tool (see preceding section) and the Healing Brush tool is that a
sample spot is required before applying the Healing Brush. Follow these
steps to use this tool:
1. Select the Healing Brush tool in the toolbox (it’s a hidden tool of the
Spot Healing Brush tool).
2. Find an area in the image that looks good and then Alt+click
(Option+click on a Mac) to sample that area.
For example, if you’re going to eliminate wrinkles on a face, choose a
wrinkle-free area of skin near the wrinkle. (Try to keep it relatively close
in skin tone.)
3. Position the mouse cursor over the area to be repaired and start
painting.
The Healing Brush tool goes into action, blending and softening to
create a realistic repair of the area.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary to repair the blemish, wrinkles, or
scratches.
The Patch Tool
Hidden behind the Healing Brush tool in the toolbox is the Patch tool. Use
the Patch tool to repair larger areas, such as a big scratch or a large area of
skin, by following these steps:
1. Click and hold the Healing Brush tool to select the Patch tool; on the
Options bar, select the Destination radio button.
You can either patch the source area or the destination. The preference
is really up to you. We recommend taking a good source and dragging it
over the location of the image that needs to be repaired.
2. With the Patch tool still selected, drag to create a marquee around the
source that you want to use as the patch.
The source would be an unscratched or wrinkle-free area.
3. After you create the marquee, drag the selected source area to the
destination that is to be repaired.
The Patch tool clones the selected source area as you drag it to the des-
tination (the scratched area); when you release the mouse button, the
tool blends in the source selection and repairs the scratched area!

The Red Eye Tool
224
Make the patch look even better by choosing Edit➪Fade Patch Selection
immediately after you apply the patch. Adjust the opacity until there are no
tell-tale signs that you made a change.
The Red Eye Tool
So you finally got the group together and shot the perfect image, but red eye
took over! Red eye is caused by a reflection of the camera’s flash in the retina
of your photo’s subject(s). You see it more often when taking pictures in a
dark room because the subject’s iris is wide open. If you can, use your
camera’s red-eye reduction feature. Or, better yet, use a separate flash unit
that you can mount on the camera farther away from the camera’s lens.
You will love the fact that red eye is extremely easy to fix in Photoshop CS3.
Just follow these steps:
1. Select the Red Eye tool (hidden behind the Spot Healing Brush tool).
2. Click a red eye.
You should see a change immediately, but if you need to make adjust-
ments to the size or the darkness amount, you can change options in the
tool options bar at the top of your work area.
The Brush Tool
Painting with the Brush tool in Photoshop is much like painting in the real
world. What you should know are all the nifty keyboard commands that you
can use to be much more productive when painting. These shortcuts are really
great, so make sure that you try them as you read about them. By the way,
the keyboard commands you see in Table 8-1 work on all the painting tools.

If you’re really into the brushes, you have lots of great options available in
the Brushes palette (choose Window➪Brushes to open the palette).
You have several choices of attributes, most of which have dynamic controls
in the menu options that allow you to vary brush characteristics by tilting or
applying more pressure to a stylus pen (if you’re using a pressure-sensitive
drawing tablet), among other things.
Note: A warning sign indicates that you don’t have the appropriate device
attached to use the selected feature, such as a pressure-sensitive drawing
tablet.
The following options are available in the Brushes palette:
✦Brush Tip Shape: Select from these standard controls for determining
brush dimensions and spacing.
✦Shape Dynamics: Change the size of the brush as you paint.
✦Scattering: Scatter the brush strokes and control brush tip count.
✦Texture: Choose a texture from pre-existing patterns or your own.
Create a pattern by selecting an image area with the Rectangular
Marquee tool. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern, name the pattern, and then
click OK. The pattern is now available in the Brush palettes Texture
choices.
✦Dual Brush: Use two brushes at the same time.
✦Color Dynamics: Change the color as you paint.
✦Other Dynamics: Change the opacity and flow.
If you’ve been using Photoshop for several versions, you may notice that
with Photoshop CS3, the attributes at the bottom of the Brushes palette
aren’t necessarily new, but have been moved from their old positions on the
Options bar. Here is what these attributes do:
✦Noise: Adds a grainy texture to the brush stroke.
✦Wet Edges: Makes the brush stroke appear to be wet by creating a heav-
ier amount of color on the edges of the brush strokes.

The Clone Stamp Tool
226
✦Airbrush: Gives airbrush features to the Brush tools (CS3 no longer has
a standalone Airbrush tool as in previous versions of Photoshop). You
can also turn on the Airbrush feature by clicking the Airbrush button
and adjusting the pressure and flow on the Options bar.
If you click and hold with the Brush tool out on the image area, the paint
stops spreading. Turn on the Airbrush feature and notice that when you
click and hold, the paint keeps spreading, just like with a can of spray
paint. You can use the Flow slider on the Options bar to control the 
pressure.
✦Smoothing: Smoothes the path that you create with the mouse.
✦Protect Texture: Preserves the texture pattern when applying brush 
presets.
In addition to the preceding options, you can also adjust the jitter of the
brush. The jitter specifies the randomness of the brush attribute. At 0 per-
cent, an element doesn’t change over the course of a stroke; at 100 percent,
a stroke will totally vary from one attribute to another. For example, if you
select Other Dynamics in the Brushes palette and then change the Opacity
Jitter to 100 percent, the opacity will vary from 0 to 100 percent while you’re
painting.
After going through all the available brush options, you may want to start
thinking about how you’ll apply the same attributes later. Saving the Brush
tool attributes is important as you increase in skill level.
The Clone Stamp Tool
The Clone Stamp tool is used for pixel-to-pixel cloning. It’s different from the
Healing Brush tool in that it does no automatic blending into the target area.
You can use the Clone Stamp tool for removing a product name from an
image, replacing a telephone wire that is crossing in front of a building, or
duplicating an item.
Here’s how you use the Clone Stamp tool:
1. With the Clone Stamp tool selected, position the cursor over the area
that you want to clone and then Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) to
define the clone source.
2. Position the cursor over the area where you want to paint the cloned
pixels and start painting.
Note the cross hair at the original sampled area, as shown in Figure 8-3.
As you’re painting, the cross hair follows the pixels that you’re cloning.

Book II
Chapter 8
Working with
Painting and
Retouching Tools
The Eraser Tool
227
When using the Clone Stamp tool for touching up images, it’s best to resam-
ple many times so as to not leave a seam where you replaced pixels. A good
clone stamper Alt+clicks (Option+clicks on a Mac) and paints many times
over until the retouching is complete.
The History Brush Tool
Choose Window➪History to see the History palette. You could work for
weeks playing around in the History palette, but this section gives you the
basics.
At the top of the History palette is a snapshot of the last saved version of
the image. Beside the snapshot is an icon noting that it’s the present History
state.
By default, when you paint with the History Brush tool, it will paint back to
the way the image looked at the last saved version, but you can click the
empty square to the left of any state in the History palette to make it the
target for the History Brush tool.
Use the History Brush tool to fix errors and add spunk to your images.
The Eraser Tool
You may not think of the Eraser tool as a painting tool, but it can be! When you
drag on the image with the Eraser tool, it rubs out pixels to the background
color. (Basically, it paints with the background color.) If you’re dragging
with the Eraser tool on a layer, it rubs out pixels to reveal the layer’s trans-
parent background. (You can also think of the Eraser tool as painting with
transparency.)
Figure 8-3:

cloning.

The Gradient Tool
228
The Eraser tool uses all the same commands as the Brush tools. You can
make an eraser larger, softer, and more or less opaque. But even better,
follow these steps to use the Eraser tool creatively:
1. Open any color image and apply a filter.
For example, we chose Filter➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur. In the Gaussian Blur
dialog box that appeared, we changed the blur to 5 and then clicked OK
to apply the Gaussian Blur filter.
2. Select the Eraser tool and press 5 to change it to 50 percent opacity.
You can also use the Opacity slider on the Options bar.
3. Hold down the Alt (Option on a Mac) key to paint back 50 percent of
the original image’s state before applying the filter; continue painting
in the same area to bring the image back to its original state!
The original sharpness of the image returns where you painted.
Holding down the Alt (Option on a Mac) key is the key command to erase to
the last saved version (or history state) of the image. This tool is incredible
for fixing little mistakes, or when you applied cool filters and you want to
bring back some of the original image.
The Gradient Tool
Choose the Gradient tool and click and drag across an image area to create a
gradient in the direction and length of the mouse motion. A short drag cre-
ates a short gradient; a long drag produces a smoother, longer gradient.
Using the Options bar, you can also choose the type of gradient that you
want: Linear, Radial, Angle, Reflected, or Diamond.
As a default, gradients are created using the current foreground and back-
ground colors. Click the arrow on the gradient button on the Options bar to
assign a different preset gradient.
To create a gradient, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Gradient tool and click the Gradient Editor button on the
Options bar.
The Gradient Editor dialog box appears. At the bottom of the gradient
preview, you see two or more stops. The stops are where new colors are
inserted into the gradient. They look like little house icons. Use the
stops on the top of the gradient slider to determine the opacity.

2. Click a stop and click the color swatch to the right of the word Color
to open the color picker and assign a different color to the stop.
3. Click anywhere below the gradient preview to add more color stops.
4. Drag a color stop off the Gradient Editor dialog box to delete it.
5. Click on the top of the gradient preview to assign different stops with
varying amounts of opacity, as shown in Figure 8-4.
6. When you’re finished editing the gradient, name it and then click the
New button.
The new gradient is added to the preset gradient choices.
7. To apply your gradient, drag across a selection or image using the
Gradient tool.
Blending Modes
You can use blending modes to add flair to the traditional opaque paint. Use
blending modes to paint highlights or shadows that allow details to show
through from the underlying image or to colorize a desaturated image.
You access the blending modes for paint tools from the Options bar.
Figure 8-4:

Blending Modes
230
You really can’t get a good idea of how the blending mode will work with
the paint color and the underlying color until you experiment. (That’s what
multiple undos are for!) Alternatively, you can copy the image you want to
experiment with onto a new layer and hide the original layer; see Chapter 9
of this minibook for more about layers.
The following list describes the available blending modes:
✦Normal: Paints normally, with no interaction with underlying colors.
✦Dissolve: Gives a random replacement of the pixels, depending on the
opacity at any pixel location.
✦Behind: Edits or paints only on the transparent part of a layer.
✦Darken: Replaces only the areas that are lighter than the blend color.
Areas darker than the blend color don’t change.
✦Multiply: Creates an effect similar to drawing on the page with magic
markers. Also looks like colored film that you see on theatre lights.
✦Color Burn: Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color. If you’re
using white, no change occurs.
✦Linear Burn: Looks at the color information in each channel and 
darkens the base color to reflect the blending color by decreasing
the brightness.
✦Lighten: Replaces only the areas darker than the blend color. Areas
lighter than the blend color don’t change.
✦Screen: Multiplies the inverse of the underlying colors. The resulting
color is always a lighter color.
✦Color Dodge: Brightens the underlying color to reflect the blend color.
If you’re using black, there is no change.
✦Linear Dodge: Looks at the color information in each channel and
brightens the base color to reflect the blending color by increasing the
brightness.
✦Overlay: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the base color.
✦Soft Light: Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color.
The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the artwork.
✦Hard Light: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the blend
color. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the artwork.
✦Vivid Light: Burns or dodges the colors by increasing or decreasing the
contrast.

Book II
Chapter 8
Working with
Painting and
Retouching Tools
Blending Modes
231
✦Linear Light: Burns or dodges the colors by decreasing or increasing the
brightness.
✦Pin Light: Replaces the colors, depending on the blend color.
✦Hard Mix: Paints strokes that have no effect with other Hard Mix paint
strokes. Use this mode when you want no interaction between the
colors.
✦Difference: Subtracts either the blend color from the base color or the
base color from the blend color, depending on which has the greater
brightness value. The effect is similar to a color negative.
✦Exclusion: Creates an effect similar to, but with less contrast than, the
Difference mode.
✦Hue: Applies the hue (color) of the blend object onto the underlying
objects but keeps the underlying shading or luminosity intact.
✦Saturation: Applies the saturation of the blend color but uses the lumi-
nance and hue of the base color.
✦Color: Applies the blend object’s color to the underlying objects but pre-
serves the gray levels in the artwork. This mode is great for tinting
objects or changing their colors.
✦Luminosity: Creates a resulting color with the hue and saturation of the
base color and the luminance of the blend color. This mode is essentially
the opposite of the Color mode.
✦Lighter Color: Compares the total of all channel values for the blend and
base color and displays the higher value color.
✦Darker Color: Compares the total of all channel values for the blend and
base color and displays the lower value color.
Painting with color
This section provides an example of using the blending modes to change
and add color to an image. A great example of using a blending mode is tint-
ing a black-and-white (grayscale) image with color. You can’t paint color in
Grayscale mode, so follow these steps to add color to a black-and-white
image:
1. Open an image in any color mode and choose Image➪Mode➪RGB.
2. If the image isn’t already a grayscale image, choose Image➪
Adjustments➪Desaturate.
This feature makes it appear as though the image is black and white, but
you’re still in a color mode with which you can apply color.

Blending Modes
232
3. Choose a painting tool (the Brush tool, for example) and, using the
Swatches palette, choose the first color that you want to paint with.
4. On the Options bar, select Color from the Mode drop-down list and
then use the Opacity slider to change the opacity to 50 percent.
You could also just type 5.
5. Start painting!
The Color blending mode is used to change the color of the pixels, while
keeping the underlying grayscale (shading) intact.
Another way to bring attention to a certain item in an RGB image (like those
cute greeting cards that have the single rose in color and everything else in
black and white) is to select the item you want to bring attention to. Choose
Select➪Modify➪Feather to soften the selection a bit (5 pixels is a good number
to enter in the Feather Radius text field). Then choose Select➪Inverse.
Now with everything else selected, choose Image➪Adjustments➪Desaturate.
Everything else in the image looks black and white, except for the original
item that you selected.
Filling selections
If you have a definite shape that doesn’t lend itself to being painted, you can
fill it with color instead. Make a selection and choose Edit➪Fill to access the
Fill dialog box. From the Use drop-down list, you can choose from the follow-
ing options to fill the selection: Foreground Color, Background Color, Color
(to open the color picker while in the Fill dialog box) Pattern, History, Black,
50% Gray, or White.
If you want to use an existing or saved pattern from the Brushes palette, you
can retrieve a pattern by selecting Pattern in the Fill dialog box as well.
Select History from the Use drop-down list to fill with the last version saved
or the history state.
If you would rather use the Paint Bucket tool, which fills based upon the tol-
erance set on the Options bar, it’s hidden in the Gradient tool.
To use the Paint Bucket tool to fill with the foreground color, simply click the
item that you want to fill. This technique isn’t as exact as using the Fill dialog
box, but it’s good for filling solid areas quickly.

Saving Presets
All the Photoshop tools allow you to save presets so that you can retrieve
them from a list of presets. The following steps show you an example of
saving a Brush tool preset, but the same method can be used for all other
tools as well:
1. Choose a brush size, color, softness, or anything!
2. Click the Tool Preset Picker button on the left side of the Options bar.
The preset menu for that tool appears.
3. Click the triangle in the upper-right corner to access the fly-out menu
and then choose New Tool Preset.
The New Tool Preset dialog box appears.
4. Type a descriptive name in the Name text field (leave the Include
Color check box selected if you want the preset to also remember the
present color) and then click OK.
Your preset is created and saved.
5. Access the preset by clicking the tool’s Preset Picker button and
choosing it from the tool’s Preset Picker list.
Each preset that you create is specific to the tool that it was created in, so
you can have a crop preset, an eraser preset, and so on. After you get in the
habit of saving presets, you’ll wonder how you ever got along without them!

L
ayers are incredibly helpful in production. By using layers, you can
make realistic additions to an image that you can remove, edit, and con-
trol with blending modes and transparency. Unfortunately, to show you all
the features of layers goes beyond what we can cover in this chapter. This
chapter covers layer basics to get you started working with layers in
Photoshop. We show you how to create composite images using easy layer
features — just enough knowledge to get yourself into a pretty complex
mess of layers! Even if you’re an experienced Photoshop user, read this
chapter to discover all sorts of neat key commands that can help you in
your workflow.
If you’re a video professional, open some videos in Photoshop Extended
CS3. Photoshop Extended automatically creates a Movie layer, and using the
timeline, you can do pixel editing frame by frame!
Have fun with layers and don’t worry if you mess up; you can always press
F12 to revert the image to the state it was in at the last time you saved it.
Creating and Working with Layers
Layers make creating composite images (images pieced together from many
other individual images) easy because you can separate individual elements
of the composite onto their own layers. Much like creating collages by cut-
ting pictures from magazines, you can mask out selections on one image and
place them on a layer in another image. When pixel information is on its
own layer, you can move it, transform it, correct its color, or apply filters
just to that layer, without disturbing pixel information on other layers.

Creating and Working with Layers
236
The best way to understand how to create and use layers is to, well, create
and use layers. The following steps show you how to create a new, layered
image:
1. Create a new document by choosing File➪New.
The New dialog box appears.
2. Select Default Photoshop Size from the Preset Sizes drop-down list,
select the Transparent option from the Background Contents area,
and then click OK.
Because you selected the Transparent option, your image opens with an
empty layer instead of a white background layer. The image appears as a
checkerboard pattern, which signifies that it’s transparent.
If you don’t like to see the default checkerboard pattern where there is
transparency, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Transparency And Gamut
(Photoshop➪Preferences➪Transparency And Gamut on a Mac). In the
Preferences dialog box that appears, you can change the Grid Size drop-
down list to None to remove the checkerboard pattern entirely. If you
don’t want to totally remove the transparency grid, you can change the
size of the checkerboard pattern or change the color of the checkerboard.
When you open an existing document (say a photograph), this image
will be your background layer.
3. Create a shape on the new image.
For example, create a red square by using the Rectangular Marquee tool
to create a square selection; we then filled the selection with red by
double-clicking the Foreground color swatch, selecting a red from the
color picker, and clicking in the selection with the Paint Bucket tool
(hidden under the Gradient tool).
After you’ve selected the color, you can also use the key command
Alt+Delete (Option+Delete on a Mac) to fill the selected area with color.
4. To rename the layer, double-click the layer name (Layer 1) in the
Layers palette and type a short, descriptive name.
A good practice is to name your layers based on what they contain; for
this example, the layer was named the catchy name of “square.”
5. Create a new layer by Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on a Mac) the
New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
The New Layer dialog box appears.
6. Give your new layer a descriptive name and then click OK.
7. Create a shape on the new layer.

Book II
Chapter 9
Using Layers
Creating and Working with Layers
237
We created a circle by using the Elliptical Marquee tool and filling the
selection with yellow.
The new shape can overlap the shape on the other layer, as shown in
Figure 9-1.
Duplicating a layer
Perhaps you want to create a duplicate of a layer for your composite. This
technique can be helpful for do-it-yourself drop shadows, as well as adding
elements to an image, such as more apples in a bowl of fruit.
Alt+drag (Option+drag on a Mac) the square layer to the New Layer button
at the bottom of the Layers palette to duplicate it. Again, by holding down
Alt (Option on a Mac), you can name the layer as you create it.
Selecting a layer
When you start working with layers, you may find yourself moving or adjust-
ing pixels, only to discover that you accidentally edited pixels on the wrong
layer. Select the layer that you plan to work on by clicking the layer name in
the Layers palette.
Unlike previous versions of Photoshop, Photoshop CS3 represents a selected
layer by simply highlighting the layer in the Layer’s palette. Don’t bother
looking for an indicator paintbrush icon in this version.
Here are some tips to help you select the correct layer:
✦Select the Move tool and then right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) to see a
contextual menu listing all layers that have pixel data at the point you
clicked and to choose the layer that you want to work with.
Figure 9-1:
The circle
overlaps the
square.

Creating a Text Layer
238
✦Get in the habit of holding down the Ctrl (Ô on a Mac) key while using
the Move tool and when selecting layers. This technique temporarily
turns on the Auto Select feature, which automatically selects the top-
most visible layer that contains the pixel data that you clicked.
✦Press Alt+[ (Option+[ on a Mac) to select the next layer down from the
selected layer in the stacking order.
✦Press Alt+] (Option+] on a Mac) to select the next layer up from the
selected layer in the stacking order.
Controlling the visibility of a layer
Hide layers that you don’t immediately need by clicking the eye icon in the
Layers palette. To see only one layer, Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) the
eye icon of the layer you want to keep visible. Alt+click (Option+click on a
Mac) the eye icon again to show all layers.
Rearranging the stacking order
Layers are like clear pieces of film lying on top of each other. Change the
stacking order of the layers in the Layers palette by dragging a layer until
you see a black separator line appear, indicating that you’re dragging the
layer to that location. You can also use these great commands to help you
move a layer:
Command
Windows Shortcut
Mac Shortcut
Move selected layer up
Ctrl+]
Ô+]

Creating a Text Layer
When you create text in Photoshop, the text is created on its own layer. By
having the text separate from the rest of your image, applying different
styles and blending modes to customize the type, as well as repositioning
the text, are simplified.
To create a text layer, choose the Type tool and click the image area. You 
can also click and drag to create a text area. The Options bar, shown in
Figure 9-2, gives you the controls to change font, size, blending mode, and
color of the text.

You can still edit text that has been warped. To remove a warp, click the
Create Warp Text button again and select None from the Style drop-down list.
Fine-tuning text
For controls such as leading, baseline shift, and paragraph controls, click the
Toggle The Character And Paragraph Palettes icon near the right end of the

After you’re finished editing text, confirm or delete the changes by clicking
the buttons on the right of the Options bar.
If you’d rather use key commands to confirm or delete your changes, press
the Esc key to cancel text changes; press Ctrl+Enter (Ô+Return on a Mac) to
commit text changes (or use the Enter key on the numeric keypad).
Using Layer Masks
In this section, we show you how to create a layer mask from a selection or a
pen path. A layer mask covers up areas of the image that you want to make
transparent and exposes pixels that you want visible. Masks can be based
upon a selection that you’ve created with the selection tools, by painting on
the mask itself, or by using the Pen tool to create a path around the object
you want to keep visible.
Creating a layer mask from a selection
You need to have two images open to follow these steps where we show you
how to create layer masks from a selection:
1. When combining images, choose Image➪Image Size to make sure that
the images are approximately the same resolution.
Otherwise, you may create some interesting, but disproportional, effects.
2. Using the Move tool, click one image and drag it to the other image
window.
A black border appears around the image area when dropping an image
into another image window. By dragging and dropping an image, you
automatically create a new layer on top of the active layer.
Hold down the Shift key when dragging one image to another to per-
fectly center the new image layer in the document window.
3. Using any selection method, select a part of the image that you want
to keep on the newly placed layer. Choose Select➪Modify➪Feather to
soften the selection (5 pixels should be enough).
4. Click the Layer Mask button at the bottom of the Layers palette.
A mask is created off to the right of your layer, leaving only your selec-
tion visible, as shown in Figure 9-3.

Book II
Chapter 9
Using Layers
Using Layer Masks
241
5. If you click the Layer thumbnail in the Layers palette, the mask
thumbnail shows corner edges, indicating that it is activated.
While the layer mask is active, you can paint on the mask.
6. Press D to return to the default black-and-white swatch colors in the
toolbox.
7. Select the Brush tool and paint black while the mask thumbnail is
selected to cover up areas of the image that you don’t want to see;
press X to switch to white and paint to expose areas on the image that
you do want to see.
You can even change the opacity as you paint to blend images in with
each other.
To create a smooth transition from one image to another, drag the Gradient
tool across the image while the layer mask is selected in the Layers palette.
Creating a vector mask from a pen path
A vector mask masks a selection, but it does so with the precision that you
can get only from using a path. The following steps show you another,
slightly more precise, way to create a layer mask by using a pen path:
1. Use the Pen tool and click from point to point to make a closed 
pen path.
If you already have a path, choose Windows➪Paths and click a path to
select it.

Organizing Your Layers
242
See Chapter 4 of this minibook for more about working with the Pen tool.
2. On the Layers palette, click the Layer Mask button and then click it
again.
Wow! A mask from your pen path! Anything that wasn’t contained within
the path is now masked out. Use the Direct Selection tool to edit the
path, if necessary.
If you no longer want vector mask, drag the thumbnail to the Trash icon in
the Layers palette. An alert dialog box appears, asking if you’d like to discard
the mask or apply it. Click the Discard button to revert your image back 
to the way it appeared before applying the mask or click the Apply button to
apply the masked area.
Organizing Your Layers
As you advance in layer skills, you’ll want to keep layers named, neat, and in
order. In this section, we show you some tips to help you organize multiple
layers.
Activating multiple layers simultaneously
Select multiple layers simultaneously by selecting one layer and then Shift+
clicking to select additional layers. The selected layers are highlighted.
Selected layers will move and transform together, making repositioning and
resizing easier than activating each layer independently.
Select multiple layers to keep their relative positions to each other and take
advantage of alignment features. When you select two or more layers and
choose the Move tool, you can take advantage of alignment features on the
Options bar (see Figure 9-4). Select three or more layers for distribution
options.
New Auto-Align Layers tool
Ever have multiple shots of a group, one with the guy’s eyes shut, and the
girl looking the other way? Or maybe you like the smile in one better than in
another. Using the new auto-alignment feature, you can pull the best parts of
multiple images into one “best” image.
To use the new tool, simply have the Move tool active, select multiple layers,
and then click the Auto-Align Layers button to the right of the alignment
tools. The window you see in Figure 9-5 appears; make your selection and
click OK.

Layer groups
After you start using layers, you’ll likely use lots of them, and your Layers
palette will become huge. If you find yourself scrolling to navigate from one
layer to another, take advantage of layer groups, which essentially act as fold-
ers that hold layers that you choose. Just like a folder you use for paper, you
can add, remove, and shuffle around the layers within a layer set. Use layer
sets to organize your layers and make the job of duplicating multiple layers
easier.

Using Layer Styles
244
To create a layer group, follow these steps:
1. After creating several layers, Shift+click to select the layers that you
want to group together in a set.
2. Choose New Group From Layers from the Layers palette menu, name
the group, and then click OK.
That’s it. You’ve created a layer group from your selected layers.
Pass through in the blending mode indicates that no individual blending
modes are changed. Using the Blending Mode drop-down list in the Layers
palette, you can change all the layers within a group to a specific blending
mode, or you can use the Opacity slider to change the opacity of all layers in
a group at once.
After you create a layer group, you can still reorganize layers within the
group or even drag in or out additional layers. You can open and close a
layer group with the arrow to the left of the set name.
Duplicating a layer group
After you’ve created a layer group, you may want to copy it. For example,
you may want to copy an image, such as a button created from several
layers topped off with a text layer. The most efficient way to make a copy of
that button is to create a layer group and copy the entire group. To copy an
image made up of several layers that aren’t in a layer group would require
you to individually duplicate each layer — how time-consuming!
To duplicate a layer group, follow these steps:
1. Select a group from the Layers palette.
2. From the palette menu, choose Duplicate Group.
The Duplicate Group dialog box appears.
3. For the destination, choose the present document or any open docu-
ment or create a new document.
Be sure to give the duplicated set a distinctive name!
4. Click OK.
Using Layer Styles
Layer styles are wonderful little extras that you can apply to layers to create
drop shadows, bevel and emboss effects, apply color overlays, gradients,
patterns and strokes, and more.

Book II
Chapter 9
Using Layers
Using Layer Styles
245
Applying a style
To apply a layer style (for example, the drop shadow style, one of the most
popular effects) to an image, just follow these steps:
1. Create a layer on any image.
For example, you could create a text layer to see the effects of the layer
styles.
2. With the layer selected, click and hold the Layer Style button at the
bottom of the Layers palette; from the menu options, choose Drop
Shadow.
In the Layer Style dialog box that appears, you can choose to change the
blending mode, color, distance spread, and size of a drop shadow. You
should see it has already applied to your text. Position the cursor on the
image area and drag to visually adjust the position of the drop shadow.
3. When you’re happy with the drop shadow, click OK to apply it.
To apply another effect and change its options, click and hold the Layer
Style button in the Layers palette and choose the name of the layer style
from the menu that appears — Bevel And Emboss, for example. In the dialog
box that appears, change the settings to customize the layer style and click
OK to apply it to your image. For example, if you choose Bevel And Emboss
from the Layer Styles menu, you can choose from several emboss styles and
adjust the depth, size, and softness.
Here are some consistent items that you see in the Layer Style dialog box, no
matter what effect you choose:
✦Contour: Use contours to control the shape and appearance of an effect.
Click the arrow to open the Contour fly-out menu to choose a contour
preset or click the contour preview to open the Contour Editor and
create your own edge.
✦Angle: Drag the cross hair in the angle circle or enter a value in the
Angle text field to control where the light source comes from.
✦Global light: If you aren’t smart about lighting effects on multiple
objects, global light will make it seem as though you are. Select the Use
Global Light check box to keep the angle consistent from one layer style
to another.
✦Color: Whenever you see a color box, you can click it to select a color.
This color can be for the drop shadow, highlight, or shadow of an
emboss, or for a color overlay.

Smart, Really Smart! Smart Objects
246
Creating and saving a style
If you come up with a combination of attributes that you like, click the New
Style button in the upper right of the Layer Style dialog box. Name the style,
and it’s now stored in the Styles palette. After you click OK, you can retrieve
the style at any time by choosing Window➪Styles. If it helps, click the palette
menu button and choose either Small or Large List to change the Styles
palette to show only the name of the styles.
After you’ve applied a layer style to a layer, the style is listed in the Layers
palette. You can turn off the visibility of the style by turning off the eye icon
or even throw away the layer style by dragging it to the Layers palette’s
Trash icon.
Thinking about opacity versus fill
In the Layers palette, you have two transparency options, one for opacity
and one for fill. Opacity affects the opacity of the entire layer, including
effects. Fill, on the other hand, affects only the layer itself, but not layer
styles. Figure 9-6 shows what happens when the Bevel And Emboss style is
applied to text and the fill is reduced to 0 percent. It looks like the text was
embossed onto the image. You can do lots of neat stuff with the Layer Fill
feature!
Smart, Really Smart! Smart Objects
Choose File➪Place and place an image, illustration, or even a movie into a
Photoshop document and discover that, as always, a new layer is created,
but even better than that, a Smart Object is created. The icon in the lower
right of the layer thumbnail indicates that this layer is a Smart Object.

Using Layers
Merging and Flattening the Image
247
What does being a Smart Object mean? It means that you have much more
flexibility with the placement of your images. Have you ever placed a logo, to
find out later you need it to be three times the size? Resizing is no longer an
issue, as the Photoshop Smart Object is linked to an embedded original. If
the original is vector, you can freely resize the image over and over again
without worrying about poor resolution. Want to change the spelling of your
placed Illustrator logo? Just double-click the Smart Object, the embedded
original is opened right in Adobe Illustrator, make your changes and save the
file, and viola . . . it’s automatically updated in the Photoshop file.
What could be better than this? Smart filters, of course. You can apply Smart
filters to any Smart Object layer, or even convert a layer to use Smart Filters,
by choosing Filters➪Convert For Smart Filters. Once a layer has been con-
verted to a Smart Object, you can choose filters, any filters, and apply them
to the layer. If you want to paint out the effects of the filter on the layer,
simply paint with black on the Filter effects thumbnail. Paint with different
opacities of black and white to give an artistic feel to the Filter effect, as
shown in Figure 9-7. You can even turn off the filters by turning off the visibil-
ity on the Filter Effects thumbnail by clicking the eye icon to the left of the
Filter Effects Thumbnail.
Merging and Flattening the Image
Merging layers combines several selected layers into one layer. Flattening is
when you reduce all layers to one background layer. Layers can increase
your file in size, thereby also tying up valuable processing resources. To
keep file size down, you may choose to merge some layers or even flatten
the entire image down to one background layer.
Figure 9-7:

Merging and Flattening the Image
248
Merging
Merging layers is helpful when you no longer need every layer to be inde-
pendent, like when you have a separate shadow layer aligned to another
layer and don’t plan on moving it again, or when you combine many layers
to create a composite and want to consolidate it to one layer.
To merge layers (in a visual and easy way), follow these steps:
1. Turn on the visibility of only the layers that you want merged.
2. Choose Merge Visible from the Layers palette menu.
That’s it. The entire image isn’t flattened, but the visible layers are now
reduced to one layer.
To merge visible layers onto a target (selected) layer that you create while
keeping the visible layers independent, do the following: Create a blank layer
and select it. Hold down Alt (Option on a Mac) when choosing Merge Visible
from the palette menu.
Flattening
If you don’t have to flatten your image, don’t! Flattening your image reduces
all layers down to one background layer, which is necessary for certain file
formats, but after you flatten an image, you can’t take advantage of blending
options or reposition the layered items. (Read more about saving files in
Chapter 10 of this minibook.)
If you absolutely must flatten layers, keep a copy of the original, unflattened
document for additional edits in the future.
To flatten all layers in an image, choose Layer➪Flatten Image or choose
Flatten Image from the palette menu on the Layers palette.

Chapter 10: Saving Photoshop
Images for Print and the Web
In This Chapter
 Determining the correct file formats for saving
 Preparing your images for the Web
 Discovering the color table
A
productive workflow depends on you choosing the proper format in
which to save your Photoshop files. Without the correct settings, your
file may not be visible to other applications, or you may delete valuable
components, such as layers or channels. This chapter provides you with the
necessary information to save the file correctly for both print and Web. We
cover the file format choices before moving on to the proper use of the Save
For Web & Devices feature (for saving in the GIF, JPEG, PNG, and WBMP file
formats).
Saving files in the correct file format is important not only for file size, but 
in support of different Photoshop features, as well. If you’re unsure about
saving in the right format, save a copy of the file, keeping the original in the
PSD format (the native Photoshop format). Photoshop alerts you automati-
cally when you choose a format in the Save As or the Save For Web &
Devices dialog box that doesn’t support Photoshop features. When you
choose a format that doesn’t support some of the features you’ve used,
such as channels or layers, a yield sign appears when a copy is being made.
It’s a good idea to save an original backup just in case you need to return to
the original file.
Choosing a File Format for Saving
When you choose File➪Save for the first time (or you choose File➪Save As
to save a different version of a file), you see at least 18 different file formats
that you can choose from in the Save As Type drop-down list. We don’t
cover each format in this chapter (some are specific to proprietary work-
flows), but we do show you which formats are best for the typical workflow
that you may face.

Choosing a File Format for Saving
250
Wonderful and easy Photoshop PSD
If you’re in an Adobe workflow (you’re using any Adobe products), you can
keep the image in the native Photoshop PSD format. By choosing this format,
transparency, layers, channels, and paths are all maintained and left intact
when placed in the other applications.
To maximize compatibility with previous versions of Photoshop and with
other applications, choose Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling (Photoshop➪
Preferences➪File Handling on a Mac). Choose Always from the Maximize PSD
File Compatibility drop-down list. This choice saves a composite (flattened)
image along with the layers of your document.
Leaving the Maximize PSD File Compatibility drop-down list set to Always
creates a larger file. If file size is an issue, leave the drop-down list set to Ask,
and only use the feature when you need to open the Photoshop file in older
versions of Photoshop.
Photoshop EPS
Virtually every desktop application accepts the EPS (Encapsulated
PostScript) file format. The EPS format is used to transfer PostScript-
language artwork between various applications. It supports vector data,
duotones, and clipping paths.
When you choose to save in the EPS format, an EPS Options dialog box
appears. Leave the defaults and click OK.
Creating a PDF presentation
You can create a multipage PDF file or presen-
tation by using Adobe Bridge (choose
File➪Browse). While in Adobe Bridge, choose
Tools➪Photoshop➪PDF Presentation. In the
PDF Presentation dialog box, use the Browse
button to choose the files that you want to add
to the Source list. You can Ctrl+click (Ô+click
on a Mac) to select multiple files and add them
to the Source list.
In the output options section, choose Multi-
Page or Presentation PDF. If you choose
Presentation, you’re given the opportunity to
set up slide show options, such as timing and
transition effects.
Click Save, name the file, and click Save again.
The Save Adobe PDF dialog box appears. If you
want to see the PDF immediately, make sure
that you select the View PDF After Saving
check box, choose any other specific options
that you want for the PDF (see Book VII for
more specifics on PDF settings), and click OK.

Alter the settings in the EPS Options dialog box only if you’re familiar with
custom printer calibration, or you need to save your image to a specific
screen ruling. Screen rulings (lpi) are usually set in a page layout application,
such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress.
Photoshop PDF
If compatibility is an issue, save your file in the Photoshop PDF (Portable
Document Format) format. PDF files are supported by more than a dozen
platforms when viewers use Acrobat or Adobe Reader. (Adobe Reader is
available for free at www.adobe.com.) What a perfect way to send pictures
to friends and family! Saving your file in the Photoshop PDF format supports
your ability to edit the image when you open the file by choosing File➪Open
in Photoshop.
TIFF
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a flexible bitmap image format that is sup-
ported by most image-editing and page-layout applications widely supported
by all printers. TIFF supports layers and channels, but it has a maximum size
of 4GB. We hope your files aren’t that large!
DCS
The Photoshop DCS (Desktop Color Separation) 1.0 and 2.0 formats are 
versions of EPS that enable you to save color separations of CMYK or multi-
channel files. Some workflows require this format, but if you have imple-
mented spot color channels in your image, using the DCS file format is
required to maintain them.
Choose the DCS 2.0 format unless you received specific instructions to use
the DCS 1.0 format — for example, for reasons of incompatibility in certain
workflows.
Saving for the Web and Devices
To access the maximum number of options for the GIF, JPEG, PNG, and
WBMP file formats, save your image by choosing File➪Save For Web &
Devices. The Save For Web & Devices dialog box appears, which allows you
to optimize the image as you save it. This procedure may sound big, but it’s
just the process of making the image as small as possible while keeping it
visually pleasing.

Saving for the Web and Devices
252
Saving images for the Web is a give-and-take experience. You may find your-
self sacrificing perfect imagery to make the image small enough in size that 
it can be downloaded and viewed quickly by users. Read the upcoming sec-
tions on GIF and JPG formats to see how you can best handle creating Web
images.
The following sections describe the differences between GIF, JPEG, PNG, and
WBMP. Choose the appropriate format based upon the type of image you’re
saving.
Having the image size correct before you save the file for the Web is a good
practice. If you need to read up on resizing images, see Chapter 6 of this
minibook. But generally speaking, you want to resize the image to the right
pixel dimensions. Choose Filter➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask to gain back some
of the detail lost when resizing the image and then save the image for the Web.
GIF
Supposedly, the way you pronounce GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is
based on the type of peanut butter you eat. Is it pronounced like the peanut
butter brand (Jiff), or with a hard G, like gift? Most people seem to pro-
nounce it like gift (minus the T).
Use the GIF format if you have lots of solid color, such as a logo like the one
shown in Figure 10-1.
The GIF format is not lossy (it doesn’t lose data when the file is compressed
in this format), but it does reduce the file size by using a limited number of
colors in a color table. The lower the number of colors, the smaller the file
size. If you’ve ever worked in the Index color mode, you’re familiar with this
process.

Transparency is supported by the GIF file. But generally, GIFs don’t do a
good job with anything that needs smooth transitions from one color to
another because of its poor support of anti-aliasing. Anti-aliasing is the
method that Photoshop uses to smooth jagged edges. When pixels transition
from one color to another, Photoshop produces multiple color pixels to
evenly blend from one pixel to another.
Because anti-aliasing needs to create multiple colors for this effect, GIF files
are generally not recommended. In fact, when you reduce a GIF in size,
you’re more apt to see banding because the anti-aliasing can’t take place
with the limited number of colors available in the GIF format.
You can, of course, dramatically increase the number of colors to create a
smoother transition, but then you risk creating monster files that take for-
ever to download.
Saving a GIF
When you choose File➪Save for Web, you first see the available GIF format
options. The GIF options may be more clear to you if you have an image
(with lots of solid color) open.
To save a file for the Web as a GIF, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save For Web & Devices.
The Save For Web & Devices dialog box appears.
2. At the top, click the 2-Up tab.
You see the original image on the left and the optimized image on the
right (or top and bottom, depending upon the proportions of your
image).
In the lower portion of the display, you see the original file size com-
pared to the optimized file size, as well as the approximate download
time. This time is important! Nobody wants to wait around for a Web
page to load; most people won’t wait more than ten seconds for the
entire Web page to appear, so try to keep an individual image’s down-
load time down to five seconds or less. Remember, all the images on a
page can add up to one monstrous wait time for the viewer!
Change the download speed by choosing from the Preview menu (it’s
the arrow on the upper-right side of the Save For Web & Devices dialog
box). The Preview menu isn’t labeled, so look for the ToolTip to appear
when you hover your cursor over the arrow icon.

3. Choose GIF 32 No Dither from the Preset drop-down list.
You may see a change already. Photoshop supplies you with presets that
you can choose from, or you can customize and save your own.
4. Choose whether you want dithering applied to the image by selecting
an option from the Specify The Dither Algorithm drop-down list.
This choice is purely personal. Because you may be limiting colors,
Photoshop can use dithering to mix the pixels of the available colors to
simulate the missing colors. Many designers choose the No Dither
option.
Using the color table
When you save an image as a GIF using the Save For Web & Devices dialog
box, you see the color table for the image on the right side of the dialog box.
The color table is important because it not only allows you to see the colors
used in the image, but also enables you to customize the color table by using
the options at the bottom of the color table.
You may want to customize your color table by selecting some of your
colors to be Web safe and locking colors so that they’re not bumped off as
you reduce the amount of colors.
To customize a color table, follow these steps:
1. If your image has only a few colors that you’d like to convert to 
Web-safe colors, choose the Eyedropper tool from the left of the Save
For Web & Devices dialog box and click the color, in the Optimized
view.
The sampled color is highlighted in the color table.
2. Click the Web Safe button at the bottom of the color table.
A ToolTip appears when you cross over this button with the text; Shifts/
Unshift selected colors to web palette.
A diamond appears, indicating that the color is now Web safe.
3. Lock colors that you don’t want to delete as you reduce the number of
colors in the color table.
Select a color with the Eyedropper tool or choose it in the color table
and then click the Lock Color button. A white square appears in the
lower-right corner, indicating that the color is locked.

Book II
Chapter 10

Saving for the Web and Devices
255
If you lock 32 colors and then reduce the color table to 24, some of your
locked colors will be deleted. If you choose to add colors, those locked
colors will be the first to return.
How is the color table created? Based upon a color reduction algorithm
method that you choose, the Save For The Web feature samples the
number of colors that you indicate. If keeping colors Web safe is impor-
tant, select the Restrictive (Web) option for the method; if you want
your image to look better on most monitors, but not necessarily be Web
safe, choose the Adaptive option.
4. Use the arrows to the right of the Colors combo box or enter a
number to add or delete colors from the color table.
5. If your image uses transparency, select the Transparency check box.
Remember that transparency is counted as one of your colors in the
color table.
6. Select the Interlaced check box only if your GIF image is large in size
(25K or larger).
Selecting this option causes the image to build in several scans on the
Web page, a low-resolution image that pops up quickly to be refreshed
with the higher resolution image when it’s finished downloading. Inter-
lacing gives the illusion of the download going faster but makes the file
size larger, so use it only if necessary.
7. Click Save.
Now the image is ready to be attached to an e-mail message or used in a
Web page.
JPEG
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the best format for continuous
tone images (those with smooth transitions from one color to another, as in
photographs), like the image shown in Figure 10-2.
The JPEG format is lossy, so you should not save a JPEG, open it, edit it, and
save it again as a JPEG. Because the JPEG compression causes data to be
lost, your image will eventually look like it was printed on a paper towel.
Save a copy of the file as a JPEG, keeping the original image in the PSD
format if you need to later edit the image, open the original PSD, make your
changes, save the PSD, and then save a copy of the edited file as a JPEG.
The JPEG format does not support transparency, but you can cheat the
system a little by using matting.

Saving for the Web and Devices
256
A good image to save in the JPEG format is a typical photograph or illustra-
tion with lots of smooth transitions from one color to the next. To save an
image as a JPEG, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save For Web & Devices and then click the 2-Up tab to
view the original image (left) at the same time as the optimized image
(right).
2. Choose one of the JPEG preset settings from the Settings drop-down
list.
You can choose Low, Medium, High, or customize a level in between the
presets by using the Quality slider.
3. Leave the Optimized check box selected to build the best JPEG at the
smallest size.
The only issue with leaving this check box selected is that some very old
browsers won’t read the JPEG correctly. (This is probably not an issue
for most of your viewers.)
4. Deselect the ICC Profile check box unless you’re in a color-managed
workflow and color accuracy is essential.
Deselecting the ICC Profile check box dramatically increases the file size,
and most people aren’t looking for exact color matches from an image
on the monitor . . . and it’s scary if they are!

5. Use the Blur slider to bring down some detail.
It’s funny, but one JPEG that’s the exact same pixel dimensions as
another may vary in file size because the more detailed an image, the
more information is needed. So an image of lots of apples will be larger
than an image the same size that has a lot of clear blue sky in it. The blur
feature does blur the image (surprise!), so you may want to use this for
only a Low Source image in Dreamweaver.
6. (Optional) Choose a matte color from the Matte drop-down list.
Because JPEG doesn’t support transparency, you can flood the transpar-
ent area with a color that you choose from the Matte drop-down list.
Choose the color that you’re using for the background of your Web page
by choosing Other and entering the hexadecimal color in the lower por-
tion of the color picker.
7. Click Save.
PNG
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is almost the perfect combination of JPEG
and GIF. Unfortunately, PNG isn’t yet widely supported . . . note, as well, that
PNG-24 images have file sizes that can be too large to use on the Web.
PNG supports varying levels of transparency and anti-aliasing. This variation
means that you can specify an image as being 50 percent transparent, and it
will actually show through to the underlying Web page! You have a choice of
PNG-8 and PNG-24 in the Save For Web & Devices dialog box. As a file format
for optimizing images, PNG-8 doesn’t give you any advantage over a regular
GIF file.
PNG files are not supported by all browsers. In older browsers, a plug-in may
be required to view your page. Ouch . . . by choosing PNG, you could shoot
yourself in the foot because not all your viewers will be able to view the PNG.
If you’re saving a PNG file, you have a choice of PNG-8 or PNG-24. The PNG-8
options are essentially the same as the GIF options; see the “Saving a GIF”
section, earlier in this chapter, for details.
PNG-24 saves 24-bit images that support anti-aliasing (the smooth transition
from one color to another). They work beautifully for continuous-tone images,
but are much larger than a JPEG file. The truly awesome feature of a PNG file
is that it supports 256 levels of transparency. In other words, you can apply
varying amounts of transparency in an image, as shown in Figure 10-3, where
the image shows through to the background.

WBMP
WBMP is short for Wireless BitMap, a format optimized for mobile comput-
ing, has no compression, is one-bit color (just black and white, no shades!),
and is one bit deep. WBMP images aren’t necessary pretty, but functional
(see Figure 10-4). You do have dithering controls to show some level of tone
value.
If you’re creating images for mobile devices, you should know that WBMP is
part of the Wireless Application Protocol, Wireless Application Environment
Specification Version 1.1.

Matte
Matting appears as a choice in the JPEG, GIF, and PNG format options.
Matting is useful if you don’t want ragged edges appearing around your
image. Matting looks for pixels that are greater than 50 percent transparent
and makes them fully transparent; any pixels that are 50 percent or less
transparent become fully opaque.
Even though your image might be on a transparent layer, there will be some
iffy pixels, the ones that aren’t sure what they want to be . . . to be transpar-
ent or not to be transparent. Choose a matte color to blend in with the 
transparent iffy pixels by selecting Eyedropper, White, Black, or Other (to
open the color picker) from the Matte drop-down list in the Save For Web &

F
ireworks CS3 is the latest version of a graphics creation and editing pro-
gram designed to streamline the process of making images for the Web.
In the days before the original version of Fireworks, making graphics for the
Web could be a frustrating and time-consuming process involving trial and
error. And the results often looked pretty bad.
With products such as Fireworks, all that has changed. This chapter gives
you a brief introduction and tour of the product and shows you how to set
up Fireworks to fit your working style.
Understanding the Power of Fireworks
You can divide the basic process of making graphics for a Web site into two
major parts:
✦Creating the images: Drawing, importing, and manipulating pictures, as
well as designing the overall page layout on the Fireworks canvas
✦Optimizing the images: Slicing the page layout into pieces, selecting the
proper compression format and level for each piece, and exporting the
individual pieces
Fireworks has two different tools that make the process of creating graphics
for a Web site easier: layers and slices. Layers are a mainstay of graphics
development tools, such as Photoshop and Illustrator, and of animation 
programs, such as Adobe Flash. Layers make creating and editing graphics 

Understanding the Power of Fireworks
264
a simpler proposition. Slices, first introduced in the original version of Fire-
works, offer an efficient way to divide a design into individually optimized
Web graphics. You can read more about both layers and slices in the follow-
ing sections.
Making designing easier with layers
We discuss layers in more detail in Book III, Chapter 5, but this section
serves as an introduction to the benefits of layers.
Layers act like transparent sheets that you can stack, one on top of the other.
You draw a separate element of the image on each transparency. Any area
where you haven’t put something remains transparent, so layers beneath
show through. In a typical file, you may have several text layers and many
layers of backgrounds, icons, lines, shapes, and so on.
If you ever make mistakes or change your mind about overall layout, text, or
graphical elements, layers can save you much time as you design your site.
Suppose that you’re painting watercolors on fine paper. If you mess up one
part of the image, you often ruin the whole thing because you have only one
layer to work with — the paper. Short of cutting a piece out of the paper, you
probably can’t delete your mistakes. Layers offer a more flexible approach to
creating and editing images.
Using layers provides many benefits. Some of the most practical advantages
include the following:
✦You can change any element of your design — text, bitmap, or vector
shape — without altering or destroying any other element.
✦You can apply effects to layers that are grouped together, decreasing the
amount of time needed to edit an image. (Of course, you can also apply
effects to individual layers.)
✦You can easily move elements up and down in the stack of layers to
change the visual effect on the screen.
✦You can test new designs and effects in a snap because you can very
easily hide and show elements of an image.
Creating slices
We discuss slices in more detail in Book III, Chapter 6, but here’s an introduc-
tion to the concept of slices. Imagine for a moment that you’ve created your
masterpiece design for a new Web site. Your Fireworks file may include a lot
of different kinds of imagery, such as the following:
✦Animations
✦Drawings

Book III
Chapter 1
Introduction to
Fireworks CS3
Understanding the Power of Fireworks
265
✦Header graphics, such as banners
✦Logos
✦Navigation buttons
✦Photos
Before you can create your Web page, you have to get all these graphics into
a Web-friendly format, which is where slices come in. The idea is simple and
elegant: Include a special layer in the program that no one can ever remove,
in which you can create guides as to how you want the images to be “sliced”
into separate, individually optimized, and hyperlinked images. Figure 1-1
shows that special layer, called the Web Layer, and some slices in action,
including a slice with an attached behavior (see Book III, Chapter 7 for infor-
mation on behaviors).
Slices provide some key advantages over outmoded methods of creating
images for the Web:
✦You can slice a design into more than one image at a time.
✦You can export multiple files in a single procedure.
✦You can control exactly where images are sliced, which helps prevent
you from making images with overlapping areas.

The Web
Layer and
slices.

266
✦You have an increased ability to optimize image size (and thereby
reduce download time) by selecting the best optimization method for
each slice.
Slices guarantee that the layout of your Web page appears nearly identical
on every user’s screen to the design that you create in Fireworks. (If you
have HTML text on your page, the appearance of that text may vary, depend-
ing on which browser and platform the user views your page with.)
Taking a Quick Tour of the Fireworks Interface
The Fireworks interface is set up to make accessing the tools quick and intu-
itive. When you start Fireworks, it doesn’t create a new document automati-
cally; instead, you see the Start page, as Figure 1-2 shows. From the Start
page, you get one-click access to
✦Create New: Click the Fireworks File link to open a new, blank image.
✦Extend: Click the Fireworks Exchange link to browse to a part of the
Adobe Web site that includes a lot of free, cool, downloadable tools and
graphical elements created by users like you.

267
✦Open a Recent Item: Just click the filename, or click the Open folder and
browse to a file to open the image in Fireworks.
✦Information: Click the Getting Started link, the New Features link, or the
Resources link to view basic tips and tutorials. Or click the link to the
Fireworks Developer Center, where you can find tutorials, sample files,
and feedback from other Fireworks users.
If you don’t want the Start page to show up every time you launch Fireworks,
select the Don’t Show Again check box at the bottom-left corner of the page.
To create a new Fireworks file (called a PNG file), follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New, or click the Fireworks File link on the Start page.
The New Document dialog box appears.
2. Choose the canvas size for your document in the New Document
dialog box.
The default width and height are 660 x 440 pixels (or the dimensions of
the previous file that you created in Fireworks), and the default resolu-
tion is 72 pixels per inch. You can enter your own size in the fields pro-
vided and change the unit of measurement by selecting one from the
drop-down list. Leave the resolution at 72 pixels per inch unless you’re
designing for some medium other than the Web, such as print.
3. Select a color for the canvas.
The default canvas color is white, but you can choose a custom color by
selecting the Custom radio button and then using the eyedropper to
choose a color from the color picker. You can also choose to have a
transparent background by selecting the Transparent radio button.
4. Click OK to create your new Fireworks document.
When you click OK, your screen looks similar to Figure 1-3.
The Tools panel: A bird’s-eye view
The panels along the left side of the screen are parts of the Tools panel,
which provides access to all the tools that you use to make and modify your
graphics. The Tools panel divides tools into groups based on their function:
✦Select: Contains tools used to select an object, as well as tools used to
crop or otherwise manipulate the canvas.
✦Bitmap: Stores tools used to paint, draw, fill, and so on.
✦Vector: Contains tools used to create and manipulate vector graphics.
(See Book IV for more on vector graphics.)

Taking a Quick Tour of the Fireworks Interface
268
✦Web: Holds tools, such as the Slice tool, that are designed specifically
for getting images ready for the Web.
✦Colors: Stows away tools that control the color(s) of objects.
✦View: Holds tools that you can use to change your view of the canvas or
the screen.
An arrow at the lower-right corner of a tool’s icon indicates that the tool has
one or more specialized variations. You can click the arrow to activate a pop-
up menu that displays icons for the available variations.
The Tools panel: A bug’s-eye view
This section gives you the lowdown on the tools that you probably use the
most in the Tools panel. A triangle (known as the flippy) at the bottom right
of the tool icon indicates that related tools are available. Click the icon or
the flippy and hold the mouse button down to activate a pop-up menu so
that you can choose from all the available tools. When you select a tool, you
can also cycle through the related tools by pressing certain keys on your
keyboard (for example, select the Marquee tool in the Bitmap section and
press M to toggle through the Marquee tool options). The tool tip for each
tool includes the key that you can press to cycle through the options on the
tool. You can activate the tool tip by hovering the mouse over the tool.

You get to see the tools in action in various chapters of several of the mini-
books, but for now, here are the highlights for each of the four key cate-
gories of drawing tools:
✦Select: The following four tools (clockwise from top left) make up the
Select section of the Tools panel:
• Pointer/Select Behind tool: Use the Pointer tool to select objects on
the canvas by clicking them or clicking and dragging an area that
encompasses them. Use the Select Behind tool when you want to
click an object on the canvas that other objects cover.
• Subselection tool: Use the Subselection tool to select an individual
object from a group.
• Crop/Export Area tool: Click the Crop tool and click and drag to
select an area on the canvas to crop an image. When you crop an
image, you discard everything outside the selected area from your
image. After you have selected the area that you want to keep,
double-click inside the area to crop. Use the Export Area tool to
create a new image from the area that you select. After you have
selected the area you want to export, double-click inside the area to
bring up the Export Preview window.
• Scale/Skew/Distort tool: This tool is inactive (as indicated by the
dimmed icon) until you select an object on the canvas. Click this tool
and click and drag the transform handles at the corners of the object
to change its size and/or shape.
✦Bitmap: The following tools (clockwise from top left) make up the
Bitmap section of the Tools panel:
• Marquee/Oval Marquee tool: Click the Marquee tool and click and
drag to select a rectangular area on the canvas. Hold down the shift
key while you click and drag to select a square area. If you want to
select an oval area, use the Oval Marquee variation (hold down the
shift key to select a perfect circle). When you select an area, you
select all objects that fall completely within the area.
• Lasso/Polygon Lasso tool: Click the Lasso tool and click and drag on
the canvas to select an irregularly shaped area of the canvas. If the
shape you want to select is made up of straight lines, use the
Polygon Lasso.
• Brush tool: Click this tool to paint on the canvas. See Book III,
Chapter 3 for more information about the very versatile Brush tool.
• Eraser tool: Click the Eraser tool to erase a swath through any
bitmap object on the canvas. The Eraser tool doesn’t work with
vector objects in Fireworks.

• Rubber Stamp/Replace Color/Red Eye Removal tool: Click this tool
to copy a selected area of a bitmap to another spot on the canvas.
Alt+click the area that you want to copy (Opt+click on the Mac) and
then click and paint where you want the copy to go. Use the Replace
Color tool to swap one color for another wherever you click and 
drag the Replace Color brush on the canvas. Simply click with the
Red Eye Removal tool to replace red with black wherever you click
the canvas; as you might guess from its name, this tool is designed to
fix that annoying byproduct of flash photography, red pupils.
• Blur/Sharpen/Dodge/Burn/Smudge tools: Click the Blur tool and
click and drag on the canvas to soften the focus of an area of a bitmap
image. Use the Sharpen tool to bring a selected area into focus. Click
the Dodge tool and click and drag on the canvas to lighten an area of
a bitmap image. Click the Burn tool and click and drag to darken an
area of a bitmap image. Click the Smudge tool and click and drag on
the canvas to smear a part of an image into another part of the image,
as if you were finger painting. You can set the parameters for these
tools in the Property inspector (explained later in this chapter, in the
section “The Property inspector”).
• Pencil tool: Click the Pencil tool and click and drag to draw single-
pixel-width bitmap lines. If you want control over the thickness and
texture of the line that you’re creating, use the Brush tool.
• Magic Wand tool: Click the Magic Wand and click a bitmap to select
neighboring areas of solid or similar colors in your image.
✦Vector: The following tools (clockwise from top left) make up the Vector
section of the Tools panel:
• Line tool: Throw your ruler away! With the Line tool, you can draw a
straight line every time. You can adjust the line’s thickness, color,
and other parameters in the Property inspector.
• Pen/Vector Path/Redraw Path tool: Click the Pen tool to create
vector graphics by drawing Beziér paths. You can use the Pen tool to
select points and let Fireworks connect the dots, or you can draw the
shape yourself with the Vector Path tool. You can use the Redraw
Path tool to change the shape of a vector graphic by clicking and
dragging any of the points that define the shape.
• Text tool: Click this tool and click the canvas to place and edit text
on the canvas. See Book III, Chapter 3 for information on how to
make the most of the Text tool.
• Knife tool: Click this tool and click and drag a line to cut vector
paths in two.
• Freeform/Reshape Area/Path Scrubber (Additive)/Path Scrubber
(Subtractive) tool: Use the Freeform tool to reshape a vector path by

pushing or pulling the stroke instead of moving the individual points
that define it. Use the Reshape Area tool to pull a vector path as if it
were taffy. If you have a graphics tablet, use the Path Scrubber tool
to change the color, thickness, and various other properties of the
vector path. You can set the properties to vary based on variations
in the pressure or speed that you use in drawing.
• Rectangle/ Ellipse/Polygon/Auto Shape tool: Create vector shapes
by clicking these tools and clicking and dragging on the canvas.
✦Web: The Web tools allow you to create and show or hide areas that can
be used as links on Web pages.
• Rectangle/Circle/Polygon Hotspot tools: Use these tools to create
hotspots (linkable areas) without cutting up the underlying images in
“HTML and images” exports.
• Slice/Polygon Slice tools: Use these tools to “slice” up your canvas
into individual images for export.
• Hide Slices and Hotspots and Show Slices and Hotspots tools. Click
the tool on the bottom left of the Web section to hide the Web Layer
(the overlays that show where your slices and hotspots are). Click
the tool on the right to show the Web Layer.
✦Colors: The Colors tools allow you to select and apply colors to lines,
objects, and anything else on your canvas.
• Eyedropper tool: Click this handy tool to select a color from the
swatches in the color picker or from any object on the canvas by
clicking when you place the Eyedropper on the color that you want.
• Paint Bucket/Gradient tool: Click this tool and then click a shape on
the canvas to fill the shape with a solid color (Paint Bucket) or gradi-
ent. For details about gradients, see Book III, Chapter 4.
• The Stroke tool: Click the color box next to the pencil to choose a
stroke color. For more information on choosing colors, see Book III,
Chapter 3.
• The Fill tool: Click the color box next to the paint bucket to choose a
fill color.
• The Default Color button: Click it to give a black stroke and white fill
to a selected vector object (or to a vector object you’re about to
create).
• The “None” color button (a white square with a red slash): Click
this tool to delete the color of the selected fill or stroke.
• The Swap Stroke and Fill Colors button: Does just that with a single
mouse click.

✦View: The View buttons offer handy ways to change your view of the
Fireworks workspace. You can toggle through the top three View mode
buttons by clicking one and pressing the F key on your keyboard.
• Standard Screen Mode button: Click this to work in the default
Fireworks view mode.
• Full Screen with Menus Mode button: Click this to maximize the
canvas within the space created within the surrounding panels.
• Full Screen Mode button: Click this to view the canvas on a black
background, with no Fireworks menus, toolbars, or panels showing.
• Hand tool: Click the hand tool and then click and drag the canvas
around in the Document window. This tool is only useful when you
can’t see the whole canvas in the Document window, either because
the canvas is bigger than the Document window, or because you are
zoomed in.
• Zoom tool: Click the Zoom tool and click the canvas to zoom in (mag-
nify the view by set increments), centered on where you click. Hold
down the Alt key (Option key on the Mac) when you click to zoom
out (demagnify).
Across the aisle: The right-side panels
Six key panels appear on the right side of the screen, opposite the Tools
panel. Some panels are grouped together by default. These panels include
the following:
✦The Optimize and Align panels: This group of panels lets you set your
export options (GIF or JPEG, quality level, and so on) and allows you to
align objects in your design. The Align panel is new to Fireworks CS3.
See Book III, Chapter 6 for more information about the Optimize panel.
✦The Pages, Layers, Frames, and History panels: New to Fireworks CS3,
the Pages panel gives you easy access to multiple pages if your
Fireworks document consists of more than one page. (See Book III,
Chapter 2 for information about pages). The Layers panel contains all
your layer options and information. The first layer is always the Web
Layer, which holds information about the coordinates of the slices. (See
Book III, Chapter 6 for more about slices.) The Frames panel gives you
access to the Frames area, where you can navigate easily among the
frames in your document. You use frames to make button rollovers and
animations. (See Book III, Chapter 5 for more details.) The History panel
allows you to view a list of your most recent actions.
✦The Assets panel: This group of panels provides quick access to premade
design elements such as button styles and common shapes, plus a way to

centralize and organize links from Web objects to Web pages. Fireworks
can actually generate your entire Web page — images, code, and all.
✦The Colors panel: The Colors panel, via its Mixer and Swatches tabs,
offers quick access to the tools that you can use to add and edit colors
and gradients to objects on the canvas.
✦The Symbol Properties panel: Use this panel to edit the values of
JavaScript properties of a graphic, animation, or button symbol. See
Book III, Chapter 7 for more information about symbols.
✦The Auto Shape Properties panel: When you select an Auto Shape
object on the canvas, you get access to many of its special properties
via this panel, including Thickness and Roundness.
The Property inspector
The Property inspector is docked to the bottom of the Document window.
This panel changes automatically to reflect the settings for the currently
selected tool or object.
The Property inspector allows you to see and adjust the parameters of what-
ever object or tool you select. If you’re working on a text layer, for example, the
Property inspector gives you immediate access to and complete control over
the font, size, color, and other attributes of the text. When you select a shape,
on the other hand, the Property inspector offers you easy access to controls
over the shape’s size, position on the canvas, color, texture, and more.
If you ever want to hide all the panels temporarily, press F4 or the Tab key.
To make the panels visible, press F4 or the Tab key again.
Viewing and Previewing Your Work
While you work, you view the canvas with Original view selected. The other
three view options at the top of the canvas allow you to preview what your
optimized images will look like. The views are as follows:
✦Original: This is the default view in which you create and edit your
design.
✦Preview: This view shows you what the page will look like when it 
is optimized for the Web, based on your current image optimization 
settings.
✦2-Up: This view offers previews of what optimized images will look like,
but with a little something extra: a side-by-side comparison of the origi-
nal image and an optimized version of the image, or two optimization
settings.

Customizing Your Work Environment
274
✦4-Up: By selecting the 4-Up view, you can preview the original image and
three different optimization settings at the same time. You can compare
how they look and how big the resulting image file is at each setting, as
well as how long the image takes to download at a particular Internet
connection speed.
Because every image compresses a little differently, you can never predict
exactly what an image may look like after you optimize it. The longer you
work with Fireworks, the better you get at narrowing the optimization
options before you preview; nevertheless, you may find previewing before
you export more efficient. For more information about the purpose and art
of image optimization, see Book III, Chapter 6.
At the top right of the canvas is a feature that you may have met in the origi-
nal Fireworks: a Quick Export button. The Quick Export button lets you
export files to, and even launch, other applications, such as Dreamweaver,
Adobe Flash, Photoshop, and Illustrator. The Quick Export button also gives
you export options for Director Shockwave Studio, FreeHand, GoLive,
FrontPage, Adobe Flex, and other programs.
Customizing Your Work Environment
During different phases of the design process, you may find that you refer 
to some panels constantly but other panels not at all. Unless you have a
gigantic monitor set to a high resolution, you need to collapse some less fre-
quently used panels to make room for more frequently used ones.
Collapsing and expanding panels
Every panel’s name appears at the left on the top title bar in the panel. To
the left of the name sits a handy little arrow that points down to indicate
that the panel is expanded, or points to the panel name if the panel is 
collapsed.
You can expand or collapse a panel in two ways:
✦Click the name of the panel.
✦Click the arrow to the left of the panel name.
When the panel expands, it makes room for itself by forcing the panels below
it down — unless it’s a panel on the bottom, in which case it forces the
panels above it up. If your monitor doesn’t have enough room to show all
the panels open at one time, Fireworks collapses the panel directly beneath
or above the one that you expand.

Book III
Chapter 1

Fireworks CS3
Customizing Your Work Environment
275
If you have a panel expanded but still can’t see quite enough of it, you can
drag the panel open wider or longer by clicking the left or bottom edge of
the panel and dragging it.
In addition to collapsing and expanding panels, you can also open and close
panels. Check out Table 1-1, which includes the key commands for closing
and opening panels.

with the arrow on it between the canvas and right-side panels, halfway down
the screen.
Moving, docking, and grouping panels
When you open Fireworks for the first time, all the panels are docked and
grouped in the default configuration. (Refer to Figure 1-3 to see this default
configuration.) However, you can easily undock and move panels and put
them in custom groups.
To move a panel, follow these steps:
1. Click the gripper at the top left of the panel.
The gripper is made up of two parallel lines of dots at the top left, on the
panel’s title bar.
2. Drag the panel to the spot on the screen where you want it to go.
3. Release the mouse button.
You now see the panel in the position that you selected, in its own
window, as you can see in Figure 1-4.

Customizing Your Work Environment
276
When you move a panel, you automatically undock it, but you don’t automat-
ically dock it somewhere else when you release the mouse button. The panel
remains floating in the Fireworks window until you dock it. To dock a panel,
follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor over the gripper at the top left of the panel.
The gripper is made up of two parallel lines of dots at the top left, on the
panel’s title bar.
2. Drag the panel to a docking area.
A docking area is anywhere along the outer edge of the Document
window or adjacent to a docked panel. When you drag the panel over a
docking area, a rectangle appears on the screen to give you a preview of
the space that the panel occupies if you docked it there.
3. Release the mouse button.
The panel is docked in its expanded state.
Fireworks gives you the option of consolidating or group panels, which pro-
vides a nice way to put the panels that you like using together. To group a
panel with another panel, follow these steps:

Follow these steps to close a panel or panel group:
1. Click the tab of the panel that you want to separate from the group.
2. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the panel.
The Panel Options menu appears.
3. Select the Close Panel Group option.
If you have moved your panels around and docked them to accommodate a
particular project or document, you can save your panel arrangement by
choosing Window➪Workspace Layouts➪Save Current and giving your set-
tings a name. You can then retrieve that layout setup from the same location.
Setting Fireworks Preferences
Setting preferences allows you to customize the way Fireworks handles cer-
tain basic functions and displays certain items. To edit Fireworks prefer-
ences, choose Edit➪Preferences (see Figure 1-5) or use the keyboard
shortcut Ctrl+U.
As you can see in Figure 1-5, the Preferences dialog box has five tabs:
✦General
✦Editing
✦Launch and Edit
✦Folders
✦Import

Setting Fireworks Preferences
278
Setting General preferences
You can click the General tab in the Preferences dialog box and customize
the following settings:
✦Undo Steps: Set the value from 0 to 999. This setting affects the Edit➪
Undo/Redo command and increases the number of possible steps in the
History panel. Be aware, however, that the more Undo steps you allow,
the more memory Fireworks requires. You must close and relaunch
Fireworks to use the new setting.
✦Color Defaults: Set the default colors for Stroke (a line or border), Fill
(the inside of a shape), and Highlight (the color that indicates what you
currently have selected). To apply the changes to the default Stroke and
Fill colors in the current document, you have to click the Set Default
Stroke/Fill Colors button in the Tools panel.
✦Interpolation: Choose one of the four methods that Fireworks can use to
render a change to the image size:
• Bicubic Interpolation: The default method, which generally yields
the highest-quality results
• Bilinear Interpolation: Gives a sharpness level somewhere between
Bicubic and Soft
• Soft Interpolation: Blurs the image slightly
• Nearest Neighbor Interpolation: Sharpens edges
A check box lets you select Faster but Less Accurate Resampling. If
working quickly is more important than retaining better image integrity,
select this check box. For more details on changing image size, see 
Book III, Chapter 2.

Editing just the way you want
Select the Edit tab to access these editing preferences in Fireworks:
✦Delete Objects When Cropping: Leave this check box selected if you
want to delete objects and pixels that fall outside the area to which you
crop your image.
✦Delete Paths When Converting to Marquee: Deselect this check box 
if you want a path to remain on the canvas when you convert it to a 
marquee.
✦Brush-Size Painting Cursors: Select this check box if you want the
cursor size to represent the size of stroke that you are about to make.
✦Precise Cursors: Select this check box if you prefer to use cross hairs as
a cursor rather than the custom cursors for each tool.
✦Bitmap Option: Select the Turn Off “Hide Edges” check box if you always
want to see the path selection feedback of a selected object.
✦Pen Tool Options: You have two options here:
• Select the Show Pen Preview check box if you want Fireworks to
show you what your path will look like (before you actually draw the
line) based on the position of your cursor.
• Select the Show Solid Points check box if you want selected points to
appear hollow and deselected points to appear solid.
✦Pointer Tool Options: You have several options here:
• Select the Mouse Highlight check box if you want an object’s selection
feedback (the box that indicates that an object has been selected) to
activate when you roll the cursor over that object.
• Select the Preview Drag check box if you want to see an object as
you drag it.
• Select the Show Fill Handles check box if you want to be able to drag
handles to change the position, width, skew, and rotation of a gradi-
ent fill.
• Set the value of the Pick Distance option from 1 to 10 to specify how
close in pixels your cursor needs to be to an object for you to select it.
• Set the value of the Snap Distance option from 1 to 10 to specify how
close to a grid or guide in pixels an object must be before the object
snaps to the grid or guide.

Setting Fireworks Preferences
280
Telling Fireworks how to play with others
You set the Launch and Edit preferences to specify how you want Fireworks
to act when it’s launched from within other applications in the Adobe
Creative Suite 3.
The options are the same whether you choose options under When Editing
from External Application or When Optimizing from External Application:
✦Ask When Launching: Select this option if you want Fireworks to ask
you whether to edit the PNG source file when you launch Fireworks from
within another application.
✦Always Use Source PNG: Select this option if you want Fireworks 
always to find the source PNG for editing an image from within another
application.
✦Never Use Source PNG: Select this option if you never want Fireworks 
to locate and make available for editing the source file for an image that
you are editing from within another application.
In most cases (with Adobe Flash being an exception), if you edit an image by
launching Fireworks from within another application, Fireworks attempts to
locate the source PNG file for editing, regardless of the Launch and Edit pref-
erences. When you edit the source file, you’re editing the original file, not a
copy of it. If you want to preserve the original, you can use the Save As com-
mand to create a new file to work on, with a new name.
Expanding your Folder options
Fireworks comes with its own effects, textures, and patterns, but the applica-
tion allows you to access additional materials for use in modifying bitmap
images. Select the Folders tab to gain access to the following:
✦Photoshop Plug-Ins: If you have Photoshop plug-ins that you want to be
able to use in Fireworks, select the Photoshop Plug-Ins check box. Press
the Browse button and use the dialog box to browse to the folder that
holds those plug-ins.
✦Textures: If you have additional textures that you want to access from
within Fireworks, select the Textures check box. Press the Browse button
and use the dialog box to browse to the folder that has the texture files.
✦Patterns: If you have additional patterns that you want to access from
within Fireworks, select the Patterns check box. Press the Browse button
and use the dialog box to browse to the folder that has the pattern files.
If you change these preferences, you need to quit and relaunch Fireworks for
the changes to take effect.

You can access the effects, textures, and patterns from the Property inspec-
tor when you select an object.
Importing files in a useful form
Thanks to Adobe’s purchase of Macromedia, Fireworks is more compatible
than ever with Photoshop. Set the Import preferences to tell Fireworks how
you want to convert Photoshop (.psd) files for editing in Fireworks:
✦Layers: You have three options under this heading:
• Convert to Fireworks Objects: Select this option if you want
Fireworks to make each Photoshop layer into an object on its own
Fireworks layer.
• Share Layer Between Frames: Select this check box if you want to
share each layer of the Photoshop file across all Fireworks frames.
• Convert to Frames: Select this option if you want Fireworks to
import each Photoshop layer as a Fireworks frame. This option can
save you a few steps if the Photoshop file has layers that correspond
to animation frames or button states.
✦Text: You have two options under this heading:
• Editable: Select this option if you want to edit text layers from the
Photoshop file using the Fireworks Text tool. The text may look
slightly different in Fireworks, though it’s close.
• Maintain Appearance: Select this option if you need the text in
Fireworks to look identical to the text in Photoshop but don’t have to
edit the text.
If you don’t need to preserve any editability from the Photoshop file,
select the Use Flat Composite Image check box.
Getting Help
Fireworks offers several forms of assistance to users. If you can’t find the
answer to your question in this book, several good options are available, as
follows:
✦The Help menu: This menu offers links to appropriate parts of the
Adobe Web site and an indexed, searchable online manual.
Press F1 to access the online manual at any time when you’re using
Fireworks. We always go to the online manual first when we need to
figure out how to do something in Fireworks.

Getting Help
282
✦Fireworks tutorials: You can use either of two basic Fireworks tutorials,
one on Graphic Design Basics and the other on Web Design Basics. You
can download them from the Web by clicking the Resources link on the
Fireworks Start page and then clicking the Tutorials link in the Adobe
Fireworks CS3 Documentation section at the top of the page. Then click
the Download PDF link to download the appropriate PDF and source files
for your platform (PC or Mac). The tutorials are quick, easy, and very
helpful to the novice.
✦The installation CD-ROM: The CD-ROM from which you installed
Fireworks contains a couple of searchable, printable PDF files:
• Using Fireworks PDF: Offers the basics
• Extending Fireworks PDF: Describes how you can use JavaScript to
control every command and setting in Fireworks
✦You can copy the PDFs into the Fireworks folder on your hard drive so
that you don’t have to rummage around for the installation CD when you
have a question that this book and the Help menu can’t answer.
✦Tool tips: Tool tips are built into the Fireworks user interface. Hover the
cursor over an interface element to see a brief description of the ele-
ment’s function or capabilities.
If none of these resources gives you an answer to your question, Adobe
offers both free Web-based support (including online forums) and fee-based
support via e-mail and telephone.

I
n this chapter, we introduce some of the basic processes of working with
Fireworks CS3. If you’re a regular computer user, many of these processes
are already second nature to you. We show you how to create and save a
Fireworks document, how to change the magnification of your document,
and how to change the size of your document. We also offer an introduction
to the concept of Pages, new to Fireworks CS3. Finally, we give you an intro-
duction to some issues regarding the way colors appear on the Web.
Creating a New Document
Before you can start creating or editing cool images with Fireworks, you
need to start the program and either create a brand-new blank document or
open an existing image that you want to change. You can open Fireworks in
several ways:
✦Select Fireworks CS3 from the Start menu.
✦Click the Fireworks icon in your taskbar or double-click the icon on your
desktop, if you have either of those options available.
✦Double-click the icon of an existing Fireworks PNG file.
✦Double-click the icon of any image associated with Fireworks. (During
installation, you can choose which file types you want to associate with
Fireworks, including GIFs and JPEGs.)

Creating a New Document
284
No matter how you open Fireworks, you can create a new Fireworks docu-
ment by following these steps:
1. Choose File➪New or press Ctrl+N.
The New Document dialog box opens, displaying options for the size and
background color of your canvas, as well as the resolution of your docu-
ment, as Figure 2-1 shows you. The settings of the most recently opened
Fireworks document determine the default for all these settings. If you
want to use those settings, simply click OK. Otherwise, continue with
the following steps.
2. Type numbers in the Width and Height text fields to set the width and
height of your canvas; use the drop-down list to select whether you
want the width and height of the canvas measured in pixels, inches,
or centimeters.
If you’re designing for the Web, pixels work best because pixels are the
basic display units on computer monitors.
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although doing so would probably be more confusing than helpful.
3. Set the canvas color.
The default canvas color is white. You can also set the canvas to be trans-
parent, which can be useful if you’re making a graphic that you want to
have a transparent background. If you want your Web page to use a partic-
ular color for the background, click the square to use the eyedropper and
choose a color from the color picker, as you can see in Figure 2-2.
4. Click OK.
Your canvas opens to the specified size and with the specified back-
ground color.

Changing Views of Your Document
After you start adding stuff to your canvas, you may find that you want to
make adjustments too fine to eyeball with the canvas at 100-percent size.
Fireworks offers several ways for you to increase and decrease the magnifi-
cation of your canvas. Changing the magnification doesn’t affect your 
document’s size, it just changes your view of it, as if you’re looking at your
document through a magnifying glass.
To increase the magnification of the canvas so that you can make fine adjust-
ments, use one of the following methods:
✦Choose View➪Zoom In or press Ctrl+=. Repeat as necessary to achieve
the view that you want.
✦Choose View➪Magnification and then select a magnification percent-
age greater than 100 percent. If you use this method, you can select
your magnification percentage directly rather than step through each
level. Figure 2-3 shows this selection method.
✦Click the Magnification drop-down list at the bottom-right of the
canvas. Select from the list of preset magnification levels.
✦Click the Zoom tool in the View section of the Tools panel and then
click the canvas. If you press Ctrl+Z, you can click and drag the Zoom
tool to zoom in on the selected area of the canvas.
If your canvas is larger than the window in which you’re viewing it, you can
decrease the magnification of the canvas so that you can see the entire docu-
ment by using one of the following methods:
✦Choose View➪Zoom Out or press Ctrl+–. Repeat as necessary to
achieve the view you want.
✦Choose View➪Magnification and then select a magnification percent-
age less than 100 percent. If you use this method, you can select your
magnification percentage directly, rather than step through each level.

✦Click the Zoom tool in the View section of the Tools panel and then hold
down the Alt key and click the canvas. Notice that when you press the
Alt key while you have the Zoom tool over the canvas, the plus sign in the
tool changes to a minus sign to indicate that you can click to zoom out.
You can access several of the most common magnification levels in one step
with the key commands listed in Table 2-1. On a Mac, substitute the Ctrl key
with the Ô key for all key combinations.

Saving Documents

Saving Documents
You may have read this advice elsewhere, but it bears repeating: Save early
and save often. We can’t think of anything worse than working for hours on
an image, getting it just perfect, and having a power outage or other mishap
wipe out all that work in one cruel second.
Spare yourself the frustration of losing your work and save your documents
often by choosing File➪Save or by pressing Ctrl+S. When you save a file that
you create in Fireworks using this method, you save the file in the native
Fireworks file format, PNG.
When you open and edit a TIFF, BMP, WBMP, GIF, or JPEG file, you can save
as that file type rather than save the edited file as a PNG. To exercise the
option, just save by choosing File➪Save or by pressing Ctrl+S. If you’ve
added Fireworks-specific elements such as slices or frames to your file, a
dialog box appears, asking how you want to save the file. If you save the file
as its original format, you lose any of those Fireworks-specific features.
You can still use the Undo command after you save, so it never really hurts to
save your document. However, if you want to preserve intermediate versions
of a document, you can save versions rather than save over your previous
work. If you want to try several different approaches to a design but don’t
want to clog one file with all the approaches, use the Save As command and
name the file with a slight variation. (For example, if you named your file
homepage.png, you can name a second version homepage_v02.png.) When
you choose Save As, any changes to the file since you last saved it are saved 
in the new version of the file, not the old one.
To save a version of your document, follow these simple steps:
1. Choose File➪Save or press Ctrl+S to save the file in its current state,
with its current name.
2. Choose File➪Save As or press Ctrl+Shift+S (Ô+Shift+S on a Mac).
The Save As dialog box appears, as you can see in Figure 2-4.
3. Type a new filename in the File Name text field.
If you have already named the file, the current name already appears in
the text field, so you need to modify the filename in order to save the
current version of the document.
4. If you’re editing a non-PNG file and want to save the file in its original
format, use the Save As Type drop-down list to select the format.
5. Click Save.
The new version of the file is now open and ready for modification.

Modifying Document Size
You can modify the size of your Fireworks document in two fundamentally
different ways. With these methods, you’re changing the actual dimensions
of the document, not just the magnification of the canvas:
✦Changing the image size: When you change the image size, Fireworks
re-creates the entire document, including everything on the canvas, at a
different height, width, or both.
✦Changing the canvas size: When you change the canvas size, you don’t
change the size of the objects on the canvas, you change only the size of
the space on which you put the material, as if you cut the top, bottom,
or sides off a printed picture (or pasted extra strips on, if you’re increas-
ing the canvas size). You can use the crop tool to reduce the canvas size,
or you can use a dialog box to increase or reduce the canvas size.
Changing the image size
To change the image size of your document, you use the Image Size dialog
box, which you can access by choosing Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size or
pressing Ctrl+J (no shortcut on the Mac). When you change the image size of
your document, you change the dimensions of the canvas and of everything
on the canvas. If you shrink your image, Fireworks discards some of the data
when it reorders the pixels to make the image smaller.
If you increase the size of your image, Fireworks interpolates data, which
means that it performs sophisticated calculations to decide what color of
pixels to add and where to add them in order to make a larger version of 
the image. Although Fireworks interpolates smartly, you can’t avoid some
amount of distortion.

Using the Image Size dialog box, you can choose which method Fireworks
uses to interpolate or resample pixels:
✦Bicubic interpolation: Bicubic interpolation is the default method and
generally gives you the highest-quality results with the widest variety of
images by taking an average of the nearest 16 pixels in the original image
size to create a new pixel in the resized image.
✦Bilinear interpolation: The bilinear method gives a sharpness level
somewhere in between Bicubic and Soft.
✦Soft interpolation: This method blurs the image slightly. Why would you
want to slightly blur the resized image? Because resizing can result in
visual inconsistencies, called artifacts, in the image. Blurring the image
takes the edge off the artifacts, in much the same way that a soft-focus
lens makes a starlet’s skin look smoother.
✦Nearest-neighbor interpolation: This method sharpens edges, so it works
best on images that don’t have subtle gradients. If you use this method on
a bitmap of a sunset, for example, you get banding — noticeable stripes of
color instead of a smooth blending of colors.
When you shrink your image, Fireworks discards some pixels and replaces a
few to smooth out the resized image. If you have a 400 x 300 image that you
shrink to 240 x 180, and then you enlarge it back to its original size, the image
that you end up with doesn’t exactly match the original image. However, as
long as you don’t make extreme size changes, you may not notice much of a
difference.
If the Constrain Proportions check box is selected in the Image Size dialog
box, as it is by default, and you change the width in the Pixel Dimensions
part of the dialog box, the height in that part of the dialog box updates 
automatically, as do the width and height in the Print Size part of the dialog
box. If you change the image resolution in the Print Size part of the dialog
box, the width and height in both Pixel Dimensions and Print Size update
automatically.
The Pixel Dimensions and Print Size widths and heights are identical; they’re
just being measured with different units. (In the Image Size dialog box, you
can set Pixel Dimensions and Print Size to use the same units of measure-
ment. See the two sets of steps that follow to find out how.)
To change the image size of your document in order to display the image
online, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears, with the current image size and reso-
lution as the defaults, as you can see in Figure 2-5.

Modifying Document Size
290
2. Type new numbers in the width and height text fields in the Pixel
Dimensions part of the dialog box to set the new width and height 
for your image; use the drop-down list to select whether you want 
to change the width and height of the image based on pixels or 
percentages.
If you’re designing for the Web, you may want to use pixels because pixels
are the standard units of computer monitor display. If you’re designing for
print, inches or centimeters may work better. If you want your new image
to have the same aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height, for example, 
4:3 for an image that is 400 x 300 pixels) as your current image, leave the
Constrain Proportions check box selected. A padlock icon at the right
indicates that Fireworks will constrain proportions.
If you want to stretch or squash everything in your image as if it’s being
reflected in a funhouse mirror, deselect the Constrain Proportions check
box and make sure that the new width and height dimensions don’t pre-
serve the aspect ratio of the old width and height. (You can make this
change most easily by changing only height or only width.)
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although doing so doesn’t really give you any advantages.
3. Select a method for resampling your image or leave it at the default.
You can read more about resampling settings (Bicubic interpolation or
Soft interpolation, for example) earlier in this section.
4. Click OK.
The image resizes.
To change the image size of your document for the purpose of printing it,
follow these steps:

1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box appears, with the current image size and reso-
lution as the defaults.
2. Set the image resolution in the Print Size section of the Image Size
dialog box.
Computer screen resolution is standardized at 72 dots per inch (dpi).
Most printers nowadays print at resolutions of anywhere from 300 dpi to
2400 dpi. If you’re designing for the Web and working with a resolution 
of 72 dpi, changing the resolution here doesn’t increase the resolution 
of any of your bitmaps (that’s kind of like trying to focus a photograph
after you’ve already taken it), but it ensures that the printout fills the
page properly.
3. Type new numbers in the width and height text fields in the Print Size
part of the dialog box; use the drop-down list to change the measure-
ment units, if you want.
If the Constrain Proportions check box is selected, as it is by default,
and you want the printed image to have the same aspect ratio as the
current image, skip this step and go on to Step 4. You can deselect the
Constrain Proportions check box and type new numbers in the Width
and Height text fields if you want to stretch or squish your image.
You can use different units of measurement for the width and height,
although doing so doesn’t give you any advantages.
4. Leave the Resample Image check box selected unless you want to
change the image size by changing the image resolution.
If you change the image resolution, you change the number of pixels 
per inch.
5. Click OK.
The image resizes.
Changing the canvas size
Making the canvas size smaller is sort of like removing strips from the out-
side of a drawing or painting. Whatever is on those strips gets discarded
with the strips. In other words, when you reduce the canvas size, you essen-
tially crop or cut out a piece of the image.
To reduce the canvas size, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-6. The default
width and height dimensions when the dialog box opens are the current
dimensions of the document.

Modifying Document Size
292
2. Type new numbers for the width and height in the text fields and
select the measurement units for the width and height.
You have the choice, as you do elsewhere, of pixels, inches, or 
centimeters.
3. Select the anchor area.
Because you’re cutting off part of your canvas, you have to set the anchor
to tell Fireworks which edges of the canvas to discard. You can click
• One of the top three squares: Fireworks preserves the top and cuts
off any pixels below the height that you have set in the height text
field.
• One of the middle three squares: Fireworks removes the top and
bottom of the existing document.
• One of the bottom squares: Fireworks cuts off any pixels above the
height that you have set in the height text field.
• One of the left three squares: Fireworks discards any pixels to the
right of the width that you have set in the width text field.
• One of the middle three squares: Fireworks chops off the pixels on
either side of the width that you have set in the width text field.
• One of the right three squares: Fireworks lops off everything to the
left of the width that you have set in the width text field.
4. If you have a multipage document and want the change to affect all
pages in the document, deselect the Current Page Only check box.
Otherwise, leave the check box selected
5. Click OK.
The canvas resizes.

If you don’t know what dimensions you want your image to have, but you do
know which area of the current image you want to keep, you can reduce the
canvas size by using the Crop tool. See Book III, Chapter 1 for information
about how to use the Crop tool.
Making the canvas size bigger is like sewing extra strips onto the outside
edges of a canvas. You add space to the canvas without changing the size 
of anything already sitting on it.
To increase the canvas size, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Canvas➪Canvas Size.
A dialog box opens, showing the current document dimensions.
2. Type the new width and height in the width and height text fields and
select the measurement units for the width and height.
You can choose pixels, inches, or centimeters.
3. Select the anchor area.
Because you’re adding an area on to your canvas, you have to set the
anchor to tell Fireworks where to put the new area. You can click
• One of the top three squares: Fireworks adds the space to the
bottom of your current canvas.
• One of the middle squares: Fireworks adds equal space to the top
and bottom of your current canvas.
• One of the bottom squares: Fireworks adds space to the top of your
current canvas.
• One of the left three squares: Fireworks adds space to the right of
your current canvas.
• One of the center three squares: Fireworks adds equal space to the
left and right of your current canvas.
• One of the right three squares: Fireworks adds space to the left of
your current canvas.
4. If you have a multipage document and want the change to affect 
all pages in the document, deselect the Current Page Only check 
box.
Otherwise, leave the check box selected.
5. Click OK.
The canvas resizes.

Organizing Your Document into Pages
294
Organizing Your Document into Pages
Previous versions of Fireworks allowed each PNG file to include only a single
page. There was no convenient way to create a multipage document for
printing, or to save designs for multiple pages of a Web site in a single
Fireworks document. That’s all changed with the release of Fireworks CS3.
Now you can use a single Fireworks document to create a hyperlinked set of
HTML pages. Each page can have its own canvas size, canvas color, and even
resolution.
Adding a page to your document
To add a page to a document you already have open on your desktop, follow
these simple steps:
1. If the Pages panel is not active, press F5.
The Pages panel opens on the right, with the current page highlighted.
2. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the Pages panel.
The Options menu appears.
3. Choose New Page.
The new page appears, highlighted, in the Pages panel. The new page is
active, so any changes you make on the canvas apply to the new page.
Selecting a page in your document
If you have a multipage document and want to move from one page to
another, you can select it from the Pages menu at the bottom of the canvas,
or just follow these steps:
1. If the Pages panel is not active, press F5.
The Pages panel opens on the right, with the current page highlighted.
2. In the Pages panel, click the name of the page you want to work on.
The page you selected is highlighted in the Pages panel, and the canvas
shows the selected page.
Deleting a page from your document
To delete a page from your multipage document, follow these steps:

1. If the Pages panel is not active, press F5.
The Pages panel opens on the right, with the current page highlighted.
2. In the Pages panel, click the name of the page you want to delete.
The selected page is highlighted.
3. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the Pages panel.
The Options menu appears.
4. Select Delete Page.
The page disappears from the Pages panel and is deleted from the PNG.
Mastering Master Pages
If there is a design element you want to appear identically on every page of
your document (a company logo, for example), you can create a master page
with that element and any other objects you want visible on all pages of your
document.
When you create a new page in a document with a master page, the new
page is automatically linked with the master page — that is, it inherits the
canvas size and color, and the resolution, of the master page, as well as any
layers and objects in the master page. Whenever the master page changes,
all the pages linked to it reflect those changes automatically.
Making a page the master
To make a page in your document the master page, just follow these steps:
1. Select the page in the Pages panel.
The page you selected is highlighted in the Pages panel.
2. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the Pages panel.
The Options menu appears.
3. Select Set As Master Page from the Options menu.
The designation “[Master Page]” appears next to the page name in the
Pages panel. Any new pages you create will be linked to this page by
default.
Master pages cannot have any shared layers. If you have shared layers in a
page that you convert to a master page, the shared layers are converted to
normal layers.

An Introduction to Color Management
296
Linking pages to the master page
If you have existing pages in your document when you create a master page,
the existing pages are not automatically linked to the master page. It may
look as though they are, because they share the master page’s current layers
and objects. What they don’t do, however, is inherit the canvas size, canvas
color, and resolution. So when you update those properties on the master
page, the unlinked pages won’t inherit the changes. To link a page to the
master page, follow these steps:
1. Select the page you want to link to the master page by clicking it in
the Pages panel.
The page appears on the canvas and is highlighted in the Pages panel.
2. Click the Panel Options icon at the top right of the Pages panel.
The Options menu appears.
3. Select Link to Master Page from the Options menu.
A link icon appears next to the page in the Pages panel, and the canvas
updates with the master page’s canvas properties.
Note that you can change a canvas property on a page that’s linked to the
master page; the page whose canvas property you change simply loses its
link to the master page.
Resetting the master page
Resetting the master page of a document doesn’t mean changing the master
page; it means resetting the document to its default state, that is, without a
master page. If you have a master page in your document and don’t want to
have one any longer, simply select the master page in the Pages panel and
choose Reset Master Page from the panel’s Options menu.
An Introduction to Color Management
The primary colors of light are Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). All the colors 
that you see on a computer monitor are made up of varying amounts of those
three colors. When you work in Photoshop or Illustrator, you have the option
to create your designs using CMYK colors (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black).
CMYK is the process used in traditional offset printing. If you’re creating an
image that you want to use for printing, be sure to set a resolution of at least
300 dpi in the Image Size dialog box before you put any bitmap objects in your
Fireworks document. Better yet, use Photoshop to make the image; you can
import the image into Fireworks if you want to deploy it on the Web. (See 
Book III, Chapter 7 for information about integrating Fireworks and Photoshop,
and see Book II for more about how to use Photoshop.)

Book III
Chapter 2
Fireworks 
CS3 Basics
An Introduction to Color Management
297
Because Fireworks is made for Web design, it uses only the RGB color spec-
trum; all its color options are combinations of red, green, and blue. The fol-
lowing section explains how you use hexadecimal numbers to create
different colors using the RGB color spectrum.
Hexadecimal numbers
When you design a Web page, you select a background color and HTML text
colors. In HTML, hexadecimal numbers — signified by the pound symbol (#),
followed by six digits (from 0 through 9) or letters (A through F) — specify
colors. Zero represents the bottom of the scale (zero luminosity) and F rep-
resents the top of the scale (full luminosity).
The hexadecimal number’s six places operate as three pairs. The first pair
represents red, the second pair represents green, and the third pair repre-
sents blue. For example, to make the background color for your page white,
you write the following code:
<BODY bgcolor=”#FFFFFF”>
To make white, you need to set each color to its highest luminosity, which is
represented by the pair FF. If you want to put black text on your page, you
can use the following code:
<FONT color=”#000000”>text</FONT>
To make black, you need to set each color to its lowest luminosity, which is
represented by the pair 00. If you don’t understand the code in the preced-
ing examples, see Book I, which covers Dreamweaver CS3.
The hexadecimal expression of a pure RGB red is #FF0000; a pure green is
#00FF00; and a pure blue is #0000FF. The number of possible colors can
boggle the mind: It’s in the millions. Historically, only a small subset of those
possible colors worked on the Web, though.
Web-safe colors
In the early days of the Web, many computer monitors could display only
256 colors. Because 40 of those colors were reserved for the computer’s
operating system or were otherwise off limits, that left 216 colors available
for use on Web sites: the Web-safe colors. When you set your monitor’s reso-
lution to the 8-bit display option, your monitor can show only that old set of
256 colors. What happens when you look at an image that has colors that
don’t fall into that set of 256? Your computer approximates the colors it can’t
display, by either using a process called dithering or changing the colors to
ones that it can display.

An Introduction to Color Management
298
Dithering is the process of combining two or more colors to mimic another
color. Offset printing uses a similar process to make many colors out of the
four CMYK ink colors. If you look at a color image in a newspaper or maga-
zine through a magnifying glass, you see that it’s made up of many little col-
ored dots. Viewed from a certain distance, those tiny dots blend together 
to form what looks like solid colors. For example, you may see orange with
your naked eyes, but if you look closely with a magnifying glass, you see
alternating yellow and magenta dots on that newspaper or magazine page.
When a computer dithers a color, it patterns two colors to create the illusion
of a third color. As with a color photo in a newspaper, this strategy works
only to a limited extent. If you look closely, you can see the pattern. If you
use the dithered color for a line or some small page element, you may not
really notice the dither. If, on the other hand, you select non-Web safe colors
for your page background, text colors, or both, people who view your site
using a monitor set to 8-bit may have a difficult time trying to read the text
on your Web site.
If users have their monitors set to 16-bit and they’re looking at a 24-bit color,
they get a dithered color also, but the higher resolution of 16-bit versus 8-bit
means that the computer can choose closer colors, so the dither doesn’t
look as obvious.
The more colors that you have in your image, the larger the file size.
So, do you want to use only Web-safe colors when you design your Web site?
Isn’t that terribly limiting? After all, designers didn’t choose the Web-safe
colors, and you can find some really ugly ones in the bunch! Not to mention,
8-bit monitors have gone the way of 28Kbps modems — the only place
you’re likely to see them is at a computer museum!
By all means, go ahead and use non-Web-safe colors. Nowadays, browsers
have become more sophisticated, and average computer owners can afford
monitors that display at 16-bit and higher. As a result, designers have
decided that it’s better to allow inconsistency in the realm of display in
order to offer higher image quality to better-equipped users.
In keeping with tradition, though, Fireworks still uses the Web-safe color
palette as its default in the color picker.
In the next chapter, we get into the nitty-gritty of applying all this color stuff
to the real-life situations of choosing colors for page backgrounds, HTML
text, and the like.

I
n this chapter, we explore the power that Fireworks CS3 gives you to
write and edit text, make and manipulate vector shapes, and create and
mutate bitmap images. You may sometimes feel a little overwhelmed by the
control that you have with Fireworks. But Fireworks has a limited number of
tools, and the concepts behind the tools are simple. And whether you have
a clear idea about what you want or you’re interested in experimenting,
Fireworks suits your needs.
Working with Text
Some of the most important decisions that you make in building your Web
site involve how you present text on the screen. In general, a finished Web
page has two kinds of text:
✦HTML text: The text that you see on the Web page that you create with
HTML. This type of text is akin to the text in word-processing software,
such as Microsoft Word.
✦Graphic text: The text that’s embedded in an image, such as a JPEG or a
GIF file. In other words, it’s a picture of text.
Which method of presenting text works better for you and people viewing
your Web site depends largely on the function of the text.
Some advantages of using HTML text include the following:
✦HTML text is smaller (in kilobytes) and therefore loads faster in a user’s
Web browser.
✦Visitors can vary the size of the text by changing settings in their
browsers.

Working with Text
300
✦Special software and hardware (in the case of Braille) can make HTML
text available to visually impaired users via audio or touch.
✦Visitors to your site can select, copy, and paste HTML text into e-mails
or word-processing documents, which can help spread the word that
you’re trying to get out via your Web site.
On the downside, HTML text can use only very basic fonts — those fonts
that all computers have, notably Arial and Times — and you can present
HTML text in only a limited number of ways.
Graphic text, in contrast, is much more visually dynamic than HTML text
because it’s part of an image. You commonly find graphic text used for but-
tons and banners, which need to grab the user’s attention. Some of the key
advantages to using graphic text include the following:
✦You can create text using any font that you have installed on your 
computer.
✦You can apply a lot of different effects to text, such as glows and shad-
ows (both conventional drop-shadows and shadow auto shapes). See
Book III, Chapter 4 for details. You can also run text along a path — 
sideways, diagonal, or even curved! We show you how in the “Aligning
text along a path” section.
✦You have greater control of elements such as leading (the spacing
between lines of text) and kerning (the spacing between letters).
Of course, using graphic text also has drawbacks. Users can’t copy and
paste text from graphic text, for example. Also, because the graphic text is
part of an image, the size (in kilobytes) of the text is larger than that of plain
HTML text.
Remember, always use an Alt tag for graphic text. The Alt tag says what the
graphic text says, so visually impaired users have access to it.
Regardless of the kind of text that you want to create, Fireworks can help.
The following sections show how you can use the Fireworks text-editing
tools to create text as part of an image, as well as export text in HTML
format.
If you want to include your main HTML text in your Fireworks document, or
if you want to use placeholder text that you eventually replace with final
HTML text later in Dreamweaver, use the Fireworks text default, 12-point
Arial or Verdana, with no anti-alias (smoothing), in your page design. Using
one of those settings gives you a good approximation of how the text looks
on the HTML page that you make from your design.

Chapter 3

301
Creating text with the Text tool
You can create text with Fireworks in a snap, which really helps you out
because you do a lot of text creating when you make images and page mock-
ups. To create some text, just follow these three easy steps:
1. Select the Text tool by clicking the capital A in the Vector section of
the Tools panel.
An I-shaped pointer appears, as you can see in Figure 3-1.
2. Move the pointer to the point on the canvas where you want to create
the text.
3. Click the canvas and type away.
You can always move the text later, as well as change its font or color. We
cover those details later in this chapter.
If the text you want to add already exists in a word-processing program,
open the text document, select the applicable text, and copy it. Then select
the Text tool in Fireworks, click the canvas, and press Ctrl+V to paste the
text. Your text appears in the default font.
Figure 3-1:
Getting
ready to
enter text.

Working with Text
302
If you’re pasting text into your Fireworks document, set the width of the text
box before you paste the text in. The default Fireworks text box expands out-
ward to the right rather than downward. To set the width of the text box,
select the Text tool from the Tools panel and click and drag diagonally on
the canvas to create a text box of the right size. If your text is too long to fit
in the box that you create, the box expands downward automatically.
Selecting a font and changing 
its size and smoothness
After you create a snippet of text, you can select it for editing in one of 
three ways:
✦After selecting the Text tool, select the text that you want to edit by
clicking and dragging to highlight just the desired text.
✦Using the Pointer tool, double-click the text that you created. Doing so
activates the Text tool and makes the text available for editing. Double-
click again to select a single word for editing.
✦Using the Pointer tool, click the text that you created. Doing so selects
the entire text box. When you edit the text settings in the Property
inspector (see Book III, Chapter 1 for more about the Property inspec-
tor), Fireworks applies the changes to all the text in the box. After you
select text, the Property inspector switches automatically to show the
available text properties that you can apply to your selected text, 
including bold, italic, various text alignments, and effects such as drop-
shadow and glow.
You can change your text to a different font in one of two ways:
✦Choose a font from the drop-down list (the list displaying the default
font, Arial on the PC and Geneva on the Mac) in the Property inspector.
The drop-down list displays all the fonts that you have in your machine
in alphabetical order. As you scroll through the list, the list displays the
name of the selected font using the font face itself, so you can quickly
see what each font looks like. Figure 3-2 shows you what the Property
inspector looks like when you select text.
✦Choose Text➪Font and then select from the list of fonts that appears on
the screen.
If you have tons of fonts and your favorite is way down on the list, you can
skip to it by clicking in the scrolling drop-down list in the Property inspector
and typing the first letter of the font name. This action jumps you to the first
font available with that letter. You can then press the down-arrow key to find
the font that you’re looking for. Press Enter to apply the font to the selected
text.

Book III
Chapter 3

After you select a font, you can change its size in no time at all. You can
change a font size in Fireworks in one of two ways:
✦Use the Size field: The Property inspector contains a field indicating the
current size of the font that you’re working with. To change the text size,
simply type in the text field the point size that you want and press Enter.
✦Use the Slider: Click and hold the arrow at the right of the Size field and
then slide it up. The text size increases. Similarly, slide it down and the
text size decreases (see Figure 3-3).
If you’re creating graphic text (that is, text to be exported in a graphic),
you’ll probably want to select an anti-alias style from the Anti-Alias select
menu. Anti-aliasing is the smoothing of the text’s appearance to make it look
like a printed typeface.
Because greater levels of anti-aliasing can make text look blurry, you have
the following choices of basic anti-aliasing from the Anti-Alias select menu,
each of which provides a different method of creating the smoothness:
✦No Anti-Alias
✦Crisp Anti-Alias
✦Strong anti-Alias
✦Smooth anti-Alias

You can also use System Anti-Alias (the built-in anti-aliasing used by your
operating system) or choose a custom level.
Adding a little color
By default, all text you enter initially in Fireworks is black. Although black is
handy and always in fashion, you don’t want to use it for every occasion.
You can pretty easily change the font color in Fireworks. To change your
color the basic way, just follow these steps:
1. Select the Text tool and place the cursor next to the first word that
you want to change the color of. Click and drag until you select all the
text that you want to make a different color.
Alternatively, if you’re using the Pointer tool, click the text to select it.
2. Click the Color box to open the color picker.
The color picker appears on-screen, showing only Web-safe colors by
default (see Figure 3-4). Your mouse pointer changes to an eyedropper
when you roll over the palette. (You can read more about the System
Color Picker, which offers other color options, later in this section.) You
can move the eyedropper anywhere within the Fireworks window.
3. Using the eyedropper, click a color.
The square now becomes the color that you select for your text. More
important, your selected text becomes that color as well. If the text
appears to be a different color than the square, you still have the text
highlighted. Click anywhere on the canvas or click any tool to deselect
the text and see the color applied to the text.
If you don’t feel like moving your mouse all the way to the bottom of the
screen, you can also change the color of your font by using the Colors area
of the Tools panel or by using the Colors panel. They work the same way as
the color picker in the Property inspector, so feel free to use whichever one
you find most convenient.

The color picker contains a number of different views. The default view uses
Web-safe color cubes. You can switch views by clicking the right-facing trian-
gle in the top-right corner of the color picker and then selecting a new view
from the list that appears. The other views include the following:
✦Swatches panel: Displays your saved colors. If you have any saved
colors, they show up here. If not, the panel displays the Web-safe
palette.
✦Continuous tone: Shows the colors as they move from lighter to darker,
left to right across the color picker. You can find all these colors in the
Web-safe color cubes, just arranged differently.
✦Windows OS: Shows the 256 Windows operating system colors.
✦Mac OS: Shows the system colors for the Mac operating system.
✦Grayscale: Provides a range of grays from light to dark. Be warned,
though: Only six grayscale colors are Web safe!
What if the color you want isn’t in the Web-safe palette? Well, thankfully,
Fireworks gives you a number of different coloring options. On the top of 
the palette, you can find the System Color Picker (the color wheel near the
middle of the top of the color picker). You can click the System Color Picker
to see your other color options. The System Color Picker offers several other
ways for you to choose a color (as you can see in Figure 3-5):
✦RGB values: Red, green, and blue make up all the colors that you can
see on-screen.
✦Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity values: A different way of telling the
computer how to combine red, green, and blue.
✦The color matrix: A visual representation of the hue (the horizontal
axis), saturation (the vertical axis), and luminosity (the extra strip on
the right) values.
Figure 3-5:

Using the color matrix gives you the most flexibility in choosing a color
because you can visually pick precisely the color that you want. Here’s how
you use the color matrix to change the color of selected text:
1. Select the Text tool and place the cursor next to the first word that
you want to change the color of. Click and drag until you select all the
text that you want to make a different color.
Alternatively, if you’re using the Pointer tool, click the text to select it.
2. Click the Color box to open the color picker.
3. From the top middle of the color picker, select the System Color Picker.
The Color dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-5.
4. Place your cursor over the color that you want and click the mouse
button.
You see a cross hair where you click. At the center of the cross hair, you
can see the color that you choose. The higher you go in the matrix, the
more saturated the color becomes. If you want to make the color darker
or lighter, click the shade that you want in the Luminosity bar next to
the matrix, or click and move the slider to the right of the shade. At this
point, you still haven’t changed the color of the text on the canvas.
5. Click OK to apply the color to your text.
The text you selected on the canvas changes to the color that you
selected in Step 4.
If you want to use a color frequently, click the Add to Custom Colors button on
the lower right after you select your custom color. That way, whenever you
need to use that color, you can click its square in the color picker instead of
having to remember its RGB values or trying to find it in the color matrix.
Manipulating text
After you type or paste your text, you can change anything about it, from its
color to its position on the page. You change the color exactly the same way
that you apply the color in the first place, and you can just as easily edit,
move, and delete text.
Inserting text
To insert text, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
An I-beam-shaped cursor appears.

Book III
Chapter 3

2. Click the place in the text box where you want to add text.
A blinking vertical line indicates where you will insert your new text.
3. Start typing, or paste text (press Ctrl+V) that you have copied from
elsewhere.
Deleting text
To delete text, do the following:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the place in the text box where you want to delete text.
3. Click and drag over the text you want to delete.
The selected text is highlighted, as shown in Figure 3-6.
4. Press Delete or cut the text by pressing Ctrl+X.
The highlighted text disappears.
To delete an entire selection of text, select the Pointer tool and then click the
text box that you want to delete. After you select the text box, press the Del
key to delete the text box and everything in it.
If you realize that you deleted more than you wanted to, or deleted the
wrong chunk of text, press Ctrl+Z to undo the deletion.

Replacing text
To replace text, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click the place in the text box where you want to replace text.
3. Click and drag over the text you want to replace with other text.
The selected text is highlighted (refer to Figure 3-6).
4. Start typing, or press Ctrl+V to paste in text that you copied from 
elsewhere.
Moving text
To move text within a text box, do the following:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag over the text you want to move.
The selected text is highlighted (refer to Figure 3-6).
3. Choose Edit➪Cut or press Ctrl+X to cut the text.
4. Click where you want to drop in the cut text.
A blinking vertical line indicates where you will insert your text.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ctrl+V to paste the text at the insertion
point.
To move a text box, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pointer tool.
2. Place the cursor anywhere over the text box.
If the text box is already selected, the outline remains blue. Other-
wise, an outline appears in red to indicate that your cursor is over the
text box.
3. Click anywhere within the text box and, with the mouse button held
down, drag to move the text box.
Fireworks shows you where you’re moving the text.
4. Release the mouse button when you have the top left of your text
where you want it.
The text relocates.

Changing text box dimensions
After you move your text box, you may find that the text is too wide, too
narrow, too long, or too short to fit in its new position in your design. Do 
you have to change your text? Not necessarily. Fireworks lets you adjust the
dimensions of your text box, which may be all that you need to do.
To change the width or length of a text box, just follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pointer tool.
2. Place the cursor anywhere over the text box.
An outline appears in red to indicate that you have rolled the cursor
over the text box.
3. Click anywhere within the text box to select it.
The red outline changes to blue to indicate that you have selected the
entire text box.
4. Place the Pointer over one of the resize handles (the squares in the
middle of the right or left side, which allow you to change the width
of the box, and the squares in the corners, which allow you to change
the width and height at the same time).
The Pointer (the black arrow) automatically changes to the Subselection
tool (the white arrow).
5. Click a resize handle and drag the box to the width or length that 
you want.
6. Release the mouse button to see the change.
If you widen your text box, Fireworks automatically shortens it. If you
make your text box narrower, on the other hand, Fireworks makes the
text box longer. If you drag the box longer than it needs to be to hold the
text, the bottom of the box snaps to the lowest point to which your text
reaches at the width that you drag the box to.
Aligning text along a path
Graphic text in Fireworks doesn’t have to conform to the straight and
narrow — it can hug any curve like a fancy sports car. To align a block of text
to a vector path (see the section “Working with Vector Shapes,” later in this
chapter, for info on vector shapes, paths, and strokes), simply follow these
easy steps:
1. Select the text block and Shift+click the shape or path.
Both the text and path have light-blue outlines that show you’ve
selected them.

Working with Vector Shapes
310
2. Choose Text➪Attach to Path or press Ctrl+Shift+Y.
The text conforms to the path or shape. The path loses its stroke attrib-
utes, and any attributes that you attach to the path after aligning the
text (such as color, shadows, and so on) are applied to the text, not the
path.
After you have attached text to a path, you can edit the path, and the text
follows the edited path. To detach text from a path, simply choose
Text➪Detach from Path.
Working with Vector Shapes
Fireworks gives you two ways to draw on your canvas:
✦Vector mode: Uses points, lines, and shapes to define image elements
✦Bitmap mode: Uses pixels to define image elements
Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and which mode you use
depends on what you want to do.
If you want to make a shape that you can easily tweak, resize, or export to
Flash or Illustrator later, you want to work in vector mode. When you make a
simple vector shape in Fireworks, you actually create a mathematical model
of a series of points connected by lines. By adding, subtracting, or moving
points, you can change the shape without changing any of its other qualities,
such as the line (stroke), width, and texture.
Because a simple vector shape is more a mathematical description of an
image than an actual image, it has a small data size. Not only that, but a
square of a particular color, stroke width, and gradient fill is basically the
same data size whether it’s 10 x 10 pixels or 1000 x 1000 pixels on-screen.
That size consistency becomes important in Flash, in which smaller image
data sizes mean faster downloads.
The basic building block of a shape is the path. The path by itself is just a set
of coordinates; to make the path appear, you need to apply a stroke. A stroke
in Fireworks is like a brushstroke in a painting. Stroke properties include
width, texture, and color. The thicker the brush, the thicker the stroke that it
makes. Of course, in Fireworks, you can make strokes with the Pencil and
Pen tools, and with other tools as well.
Read on to discover how to create and edit vector shapes.

Making a good old-fashioned line
When you first create a line using the Line tool, it’s a straight line (which can
be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal). To create a line in Fireworks, just follow
these steps:
1. Click the Line tool in the Vector part of the Tools panel.
2. Place your cursor over the spot where you want your line to start.
When you have your cursor over the canvas, the cursor becomes a
cross hair. The center of that cross hair is your point of contact with the
canvas.
3. Click where you want your line to start and, holding the mouse button
down, move your cursor to where you want your line to end.
4. Release the mouse button.
By default, the stroke of your line is 1 pixel in width.
You can access dotted and dashed line stroke options, as well as other
options, in the Stroke Category pop-up menu in the Property inspector, as
you can see in Figure 3-7.
Figure 3-7:

If you hold down the Shift key while you draw a line, you restrict the angle of
the line to 45-degree increments.
Making simple shapes
Fireworks has easy-to-use tools for creating rectangles (including squares),
ovals (including circles), and polygons. The tools for making all these shapes
are grouped with the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel.
When you click the Rectangle tool and hold down the mouse button, a pop-
up menu displays three basic tools at the top:
✦The Rectangle tool: Use this tool to create squares and other rectangles.
✦The Ellipse tool: Use this tool to create round shapes such as circles
and other ovals.
✦The Polygon tool: Use this tool to create many-sided shapes (up to 360
sides). Use the Property inspector to set the number of sides before you
draw on the canvas. The slider includes values from 3 to 25; for values
greater than 25, you need to type a number in the field. By default, the
Polygon tool creates pentagons. Add three sides and you have an octa-
gon, or delete two sides to get a triangle.
See the section “Making complex shapes,” later in this chapter, for informa-
tion on the other options in the Rectangle tool’s pop-up menu.
To make a rectangle, follow these steps:
1. Click the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
top-left corner of your rectangle.
The cursor becomes a cross hair.
3. Click and drag to the spot where you want the bottom-right corner of
the rectangle, as you can see in Figure 3-8.
To create a square, hold down the Shift key as you drag.
4. Release the mouse button.
The shape appears on the canvas.
To make an oval, follow these steps:
1. Click the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel and
hold the mouse button down until the pop-up menu with the Ellipse
tool appears.

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images

313
2. Place the cursor over the Ellipse tool and release the mouse button.
The Ellipse tool is selected.
3. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
oval.
Your cursor becomes a cross hair.
4. Click and drag to create the oval.
To create a circle, hold down the Shift key as you drag.
An oval doesn’t have corners, so you may not be able to get precise place-
ment when you make the shape. But you can easily move the shape, as we
describe in the “Editing, moving, and deleting shapes” section, later in this
chapter.
You can make an equilateral polygon (a shape in which all sides have equal
lengths) by following these steps:
1. Click the Rectangle tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel and
hold the mouse button down until the pop-up menu with the Polygon
tool appears.
2. Place the cursor over the Polygon tool and release the mouse button.
The Polygon tool is selected.
3. In the Sides text field on the right of the Property inspector, type the
number of sides you want the polygon to have, or use the slider next
to the Sides text field to set the number of sides.
Figure 3-8:
Making a
rectangle
shape.

Working with Vector Shapes
314
By default, the polygon is five sided. If you set the number of sides to
three rather than five, you draw a triangle. Set the number of sides to six
and you draw a hexagon. You can make a shape with up to 360 sides —
just don’t expect us to know what you call a polygon with 360 sides!
4. Place your cursor over the point on the canvas where you want the
shape.
Your cursor becomes a cross hair.
5. Click and drag to create the polygon.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to various properties
of the polygon, including fill options, stroke options, and effects.
Making complex shapes
You can make complex shapes simply by choosing them directly from the
Rectangle tool’s Auto Shapes pop-up menu, which presents you with icons
representing the following choices:
✦Arrow
✦Beveled Rectangle
✦Chamfer Rectangle
✦Connector Line
✦Doughnut
✦L-Shape
✦Pie
✦Rounded Rectangle
✦Smart Polygon
✦Spiral
✦Star
You can also create an Auto Shape by selecting it from the Insert New Auto
Shape pop-up menu in the Auto Shape Properties panel, which by default is
the bottom right panel. (Because it is closed by default, click the triangle or
panel name to open the panel.) And when you have an Auto Shape selected
on the canvas, you can change many of its settings in the Auto Shape
Property inspector.
The new Shapes panel, which you can find grouped in the Assets panel,
includes shapes such as 3D Box, Talking (a comic strip-type dialog bubble),
and Frames (a few picture frames). To place one of these shapes on the
canvas, simply click it in the Shapes panel, drag it onto the canvas, and
release the mouse button.

If you can’t find the kind of shape that you want to make in the Vector Shape
tool’s pop-up menu or the Shapes panel, you can make a custom, free-form
shape. Believe it or not, you can just as easily make odd shapes as regular
ones, and you may have more fun doing it!
The main tool that you use to create complex shapes is the Pen tool, which
you can find in the Vectors section of the Tools panel. As does the Rectangle
tool, the Pen tool comes with some variations, which you can access by
clicking and holding the mouse button down on the Pen tool. The pop-up
menu for the Pen tool displays the following variations:
✦The Pen tool: Use the Pen tool to place points on the page; Fireworks
connects the dots for you.
✦The Vector Path tool: Use the Vector Path tool to draw as you do with a
felt-tip marker. You can manipulate the path in ways that you can’t if you
use a bitmap tool (or a real felt-tip marker); see the section “Editing,
moving, and deleting shapes,” later in this chapter.
✦The Redraw Path tool: Use the Redraw Path tool to change the length or
shape of a path that you’ve already created.
To make a free-form shape with straight lines, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pen tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place the cursor over the canvas.
Your cursor becomes a fountain pen.
3. Click to make your starting point.
4. Move your cursor and click to create a second point.
Fireworks connects the dots with a straight line.
5. Move your cursor and click to create a third point, and, if you want, a
fourth, fifth, tenth, or one-hundred-forty-second point.
6. If you want a closed shape, click again on your starting point to close
the shape. Otherwise, double-click the end point to make an open
shape.
You may initially have some problems making curved lines with the Pen tool.
If you know a few things about the Pen tool, you can much more easily use it
to make curved lines. First of all, you can make two kinds of points with the
Pen tool. Which kind of point you make determines whether the line con-
necting the dots is straight or curved:
✦Corner points: These points anchor straight lines.
✦Curve points: These points anchor curved lines.

Working with Vector Shapes
316
If you simply click in various spots to make the shape, you automatically
make corner points. To make a free-form shape with curved lines, as in the
one shown in Figure 3-9, do the following:
1. Click the Pen tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel.
2. Place the cursor over the canvas.
Your cursor becomes a fountain pen.
3. Click to make your starting point.
4. Move your cursor and click a second point. Keeping the mouse button
held down, move your cursor.
Point handles (solid circles at both ends of a line that has the selected
point in the middle) appear, which tells you that you have made a curve
point. As you move the mouse, Fireworks previews the curve between
the first and second points.
5. Release the mouse button to make the curve.
Fireworks joins your first and second points.
6. Move your cursor and click and drag to create as many curved lines
as you want.
7. If you want a closed shape, click again on your starting point to close
the shape. Otherwise, double-click the end point to make an open
shape.
Editing, moving, and deleting shapes
You can alter a simple shape nearly as easily as you can make one. If you make
a shape using any of the tools grouped with the Rectangle, Ellipse, or Polygon
tool, Fireworks thinks of the shape as a group of points. If you want to edit the
shape, first you need to ungroup the points so that you can move them.
Figure 3-9:

To change the shape of a straight-sided simple shape (a shape with nothing
but corner points, such as a rectangle), follow these steps:
1. Click the Subselection tool (the white arrow) in the top of the Tools
panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, are highlighted.
3. Choose Modify➪Ungroup or press Ctrl+Shift+G (Ô+Shift+G on a Mac)
to ungroup the points.
The shape remains selected.
4. Click and drag any point in the shape to the new location that you
want.
You can also delete a point by clicking it and pressing the Backspace or
Delete key.
If you want to edit a complex shape (such as the one in Figure 3-9), you can
use the Subselection tool to alter any of the curves:
1. Select the Subselection tool (the white arrow) from the top of the
Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, are highlighted.
3. If the shape is grouped, choose Modify➪Ungroup or press Ctrl+
Shift+G (Ô+Shift+G on a Mac) to ungroup the points.
When points are grouped, they’re locked together and can’t be manipu-
lated individually.
4. Click and drag a curve point to its new location or click a curve point
to make it active, and then click and drag one of the point handles to
change the shape of the curve.
Moving a shape is a piece of cake. Here’s how:
1. Click the Pointer tool (the black arrow) in the top of the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape and, keeping the mouse
button held down, drag the shape to the location that you want.
You can also use the Subselection tool to move a shape, but you have to
be careful not to click a handle. If you click and drag a point handle, you
move the point rather than the whole shape. If you change the shape by
mistake, press Ctrl+Z to undo the change.

Working with Vector Shapes
318
Deleting a shape is simple; just follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or the Subselection tool (the
white arrow) from the top of the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape.
3. Press the Delete or Backspace key.
If you want to cut the shape and paste it somewhere else (in your cur-
rent document or in a different document), press Ctrl+X to remove the
shape and Ctrl+V to paste it in your desired new location.
Splitting shapes
If you ever want to split one shape into two shapes, you can call upon the
services of the Knife tool. You have access to the Knife tool only when you
select an ungrouped shape. When you don’t have an ungrouped shape
selected, the Knife tool is grayed out in the Tools panel.
To split an ungrouped shape, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool (the black arrow) at the top of the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere on the line defining the shape that you want to split.
All the points, and the guide lines connecting them, are highlighted. Just
as important, the Knife tool in the Vector section of the Tools panel
becomes available. (If the Knife tool remains grayed out, press
Ctrl+Shift+G (Ô+Shift+G on a Mac) to ungroup the shape and make the
Knife tool available.)
3. Select the Knife tool from the Vector section of the Tools panel by
clicking it or pressing the Y key.
When you move your cursor over the canvas, your cursor becomes a
blade.
4. Click and drag the cursor over the guide lines where you want the
shape to split, as you can see in Figure 3-10.
New points show where you made the cut. You now have two shapes. If
you want to move or edit either of the new shapes, select the shape that
you want with the Subselect tool.
If you hold down the Shift key while dragging, you can constrain the split to
45-degree angles.

Adding a little color to your shapes
You can think of your shapes as having two parts: the path that defines the
outside (which can have a stroke or not) and the whole of the inside (which
can be empty or filled). The most basic stroke for a shape is a solid color;
likewise, the most basic inside for a filled shape is a solid color.
You can get pretty fancy with both strokes and fills (adding gradients, tex-
tures, and more, which you can read about in Book III, Chapter 4). However,
we start with the basics: adding solid colors to strokes and fills.
Adding color to the stroke
The initial default color of strokes in Fireworks is black. So, when you add
color to the stroke, you’re really changing the stroke’s color from black to
the color that you choose. Whatever you last selected as the stroke color
becomes the new default.
To add or change the color of your stroke, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool (the black arrow) or Subselection tool (the white
arrow) in the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere in the stroke.
The stroke is highlighted to show that you selected it.
3. Click the color box next to the Pencil icon in the Stroke part of the
Property inspector.
The pointer assumes the shape of an eyedropper, and the Fireworks color
picker appears. You can choose a color from the color picker or place the
eyedropper anywhere in the Fireworks window to select a color.
Figure 3-10:
Splitting a
square into
two pieces.

Working with Vector Shapes
320
4. Click to select the color that the tip of the eyedropper is over.
The stroke changes color. To find out more about the color picker, see
the “Adding a little color” section, earlier in this chapter.
If your stroke is only 1 pixel wide, the highlight obscures the line, and you
can’t see your change immediately. Don’t worry, though. Just click anywhere
on the canvas except in the shape that you just changed; you do this to des-
elect the shape so that you can see it. (You can also deselect the shape by
pressing Ctrl+D.
To remove a stroke from a path, select the stroke and choose None from the
Stroke Category pop-up menu in the Stroke part of the Property inspector.
Adding a fill color to the inside of the shape
Fills in Fireworks are empty by default. So when we say that you add color to
the fill, you really add color to the fill! Just as with adding color to a stroke,
after you know how to add a color to the fill, you also know how to change
the fill’s color.
To add a fill color to your shape, or to change the color that your shape cur-
rently has, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool (the black arrow) in the Tools panel.
2. Click anywhere in the shape.
The stroke highlights to show that you selected the shape.
3. Click the square with the red line through it (next to the Paint Bucket
icon) in the Fill part of the Property inspector.
The pointer assumes the shape of an eyedropper, and the Fireworks color
picker pops up. You can choose a color from the color picker or place the
eyedropper anywhere in the Fireworks window to select a color.
4. Select a color.
To get the goods on the color picker, see the “Adding a little color” sec-

Working with Bitmap Images
Vector images are compact and versatile, but they can’t handle the complex-
ity of photographic images or illustrations. In a photographic image, any
given pixel can be a completely different color than any of the pixels around
it, so each pixel’s color must be defined individually. That makes bitmaps big
from a file-size perspective, but for photos on your Web site, bitmaps are the
only way to go.
Fireworks offers an array of useful tools for making and manipulating bitmap
images. You may use the bitmap tools to draw in Fireworks, but you proba-
bly want to use bitmap mode mostly when you need to place and tweak
imported images, such as photographs.
Exploring the bitmap drawing tools
The main bitmap drawing tools in Fireworks are the Brush and Pencil tools.
You can use those tools somewhat interchangeably. Each tool has an amaz-
ing amount of flexibility, so although you can start drawing with them
quickly, getting comfortable with their full capabilities may take some time.
Most of the flexibility of the tools centers around the concept of tips. In the
real world, the sharper a pencil, the thinner a line it draws. The thicker the
end of a paintbrush, the thicker the line it makes, and the kind of bristles it
has affects the texture of the line it makes. The same results hold true with
the tools in Fireworks.
In Fireworks, however, each tool has its own unique tip (though all those
tools are really just variations of the Pencil and Brush tools) to form a stroke
category, as the following list describes:
✦Basic: Hard Line, Hard Rounded, Soft Line, Soft Rounded
✦Air Brush: Basic, Textured
✦Calligraphy: Bamboo, Basic, Quill, Ribbon, Wet
✦Charcoal: Creamy, Pastel, Soft, Textured
✦Crayon: Basic, Rake, Thick
✦Dashed: Basic Dash, Dash Double, Dash Triple, Dotted, Hard Dash,
Heavy Dash
✦Felt Tip: Dark Marker, Highlighter, Light Marker, Thin
✦Oil: Bristle, Broad Splatter, Splatter, Strands, Textured Bristle
✦Pencil: 1-Pixel Hard, 1-Pixel Soft, Colored Pencil, Graphite
✦Watercolor: Heavy, Thick, Thin

Working with Bitmap Images
322
✦Random: Confetti, Dots, Fur, Squares, Yarn
✦Unnatural: 3D, 3D Glow, Chameleon, Fluid Splatter, Outline, Paint
Splatter, Toothpaste, Toxic Waste, Viscous Alien Paint
The tips run the gamut from basic to out of this world. Figure 3-11 shows you
strokes made with three of the more complex tips. After you’re familiar with
the default stroke settings, you may want to customize the tips. The Edit
Stroke dialog box offers you an amazing amount of control over stroke
parameters such as ink amount, flow rate, shape, and sensitivity. To open
the Edit Stroke dialog box, choose Stroke Options from the Stroke Category
pop-up menu of the Property inspector and click Advanced. See the
Fireworks Help files for further details, or feel free to experiment!
If you have a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet, you can set your drawing
speed and pressure to modify how you place the stroke on the canvas. Just
enter the settings that you want in the Sensitivity tab of the Edit Stroke
dialog box.
To draw a line or shape using the Brush or Pencil tool, follow these steps:
1. Select the Brush or Pencil tool from the Bitmap area of the Tools
panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, the pointer takes the
shape of a cross hair. The default tip for the Brush tool is also the
default tip for the Pencil tool: 1-Pixel Hard.
2. Select a color from the color picker in the tool’s Property inspector.
To find out more about the color picker, see the “Adding a little color”
section, earlier in this chapter.

3. Select a tip from the Stroke Category pop-up menu.
Each specialized tip has its own default edge size and texture.
4. Click and drag on the canvas to make your line or shape.
The wider the brush, the more pronounced the effect of a fancy tip. See
Book III, Chapter 4 for more information on customizing the brush edge
and texture.
Inserting a bitmap image
You probably need to insert an existing bitmap image into a Fireworks docu-
ment often if you’re designing a Web page, whether the bitmaps are pictures
of your products or pictures of your family.
To insert a bitmap image into your document, you can drag and drop the
image onto the canvas from your desktop or a folder, or you can import the
image. To import a bitmap image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import or press Ctrl+R.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the image that you want to insert.
3. Double-click the filename, or click the filename and click OK.
The Import dialog box closes, revealing the canvas. The cursor changes
into the Insertion Pointer — a right angle.
4. Align the Insertion Pointer with the top-left point on your canvas
where you want the inserted image to go.
5. Click to place the image.
Selecting areas in a bitmap image
Fireworks allows you to select areas within an image in several different
ways. If you’ve used Photoshop before, the Marquee tool, Lasso tool, and
Magic Wand tool probably look familiar. In case you’re new to these tools,
the following sections give you a brief rundown.
Using the Marquee tool
The Marquee tool has two guises, which you can access by clicking and
holding the Marquee tool until the pop-up menu appears:
✦The Marquee tool: Use this tool to make rectangular selections.
✦The Oval Marquee tool: Use this tool to make oval-shaped selections.

Working with Bitmap Images
324
To select a rectangular or oval part of your bitmap, simply follow these steps:
1. Select the Marquee tool or the Oval Marquee tool from the Bitmap
part of the Tools panel.
When you move your pointer over the canvas, your pointer becomes a
cross.
2. Place the center of the pointer over one corner of the area that you
want to select.
3. Click and drag diagonally over the area that you want to select.
A flashing marquee marks the selected area; the marquee is rectangular
if you selected the Marquee tool and oval if you selected the Oval
Marquee tool.
You can convert any vector shape on the canvas to a marquee by selecting 
it and choosing Modify➪Convert Path to Marquee. Then just select an edge
style and click OK. The path becomes a marquee. Depending on how your
preferences are set, the path itself may disappear from the canvas (see 
Book III, Chapter 1 for details on setting your Preferences).
Using the Lasso tool
The Lasso tool has two guises, which you can access by clicking and holding
the Lasso tool until the pop-up menu appears:
✦The Lasso tool: Use this tool to make a free-form selection area by
“drawing” the area.
✦The Polygon Lasso tool: Use this tool to select a polygonal area by click-
ing points on the perimeter of the area.
To select an irregular area of your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, the pointer becomes a
lasso.
2. Place the bottom tip of the pointer over the spot on the canvas where
you want your selection to start.
3. Click and drag to create an outline of the area you want to select, as
Figure 3-12 shows you.
You have to close the outline to make the selection. When you have your
pointer over the spot where you started your selection, a little filled
square appears at the bottom right of the pointer. Click to close the
selection shape.

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images
Working with Bitmap Images
325
To select a polygonal area of your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Lasso tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, the pointer becomes a
lasso.
2. Place the bottom tip of the pointer over the spot on the canvas where
you want your selection to start.
3. Click to establish the first point of the area that you want to select.
4. Move your cursor to the second point of the area that you want to
select; click it.
Fireworks connects the points with a straight line.
5. Place your cursor and click all points making up the polygonal 
selection.
You have to close the outline to make the selection. Double-click to close
the selection from the last-placed point to the first-placed point. Or,
when you have your pointer over the first-placed point (a little filled
square appears at the bottom right of the pointer), click to close the
selection shape.
Using the Magic Wand
The third bitmap selection tool is known as the Magic Wand tool. The Magic
Wand tool selects an area of solid color or of similar colors. (You can set the
wand’s sensitivity level so that it selects areas of more similar or less similar
colors.)
Figure 3-12:
The Lasso
tool allows
you to
select an
irregularly
shaped
area.

Working with Bitmap Images
326
To select a contiguous area of similar color in your bitmap, follow these
steps:
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools panel.
When you place your pointer over the canvas, the pointer takes the form
of a magician’s wand.
2. Place the pointer over the part of the image that you want to select
and click.
A blinking marquee marks off the selected area. If you select too much
area, you need to make the wand more sensitive. Set the Tolerance level
in the Property inspector to a lower number. If you don’t select enough
area, set the Tolerance level to a higher number (up to 255, at which set-
ting you probably select your entire bitmap).
Editing bitmaps: The basics
Fireworks allows you to manipulate bitmaps in all kinds of crazy and inter-
esting ways, but naturally, it also allows you to do common everyday image-
altering as well.
Perhaps the most basic bitmap editing tasks that you can do are cropping,
resizing, rotating, and distorting an image, which you can read about in 
Book III, Chapter 4, along with basic filtering operations, such as Blurring,
Sharpening, and making color adjustments.
No introductory chapter on bitmap editing is complete, though, without a
quick look at the Eraser tool. As you may expect, the Eraser tool is the anti-
brush. The Brush tool adds a line, shape, or pattern to a bitmap. The Eraser
tool removes a line of pixels from a bitmap.
To erase pixels from your bitmap, follow these steps:
1. Select the Eraser tool from the Bitmap part of the Tools panel.
The Eraser tool defaults to a circle, though you can make it square
shaped by clicking the square shape in the Property inspector.
2. In the Property inspector, type a size in the Size text field or use the
handy slider to set the width of the Eraser.
The range goes from 1 to 100.
3. Select the circle shape or square shape by clicking on one or the
other.
4. Set the Edge by typing a number or using the slider.

Book III
Chapter 3
Working with Text,
Shapes, and Images
Working with Bitmap Images
327
The range goes from 0 to 100. Setting to 0 gives a hard edge to your
Eraser (it removes a single pixel at a time), and setting to 100 gives a
fuzzy edge to the erased area.
5. Set the Opacity of the Eraser by typing a number or using the slider.
The range goes from 1 to 100 percent. If you set the Opacity to 100 per-
cent, the Eraser clears all the erased pixels entirely (except at the edges,
if you set an edge of greater than 0). If you set the opacity to less than
100 percent, the Eraser creates a translucent effect, allowing whatever
you have under the bitmap to show through. The lower the opacity set-
ting, the more the image underneath shows through.
6. Click and drag on your image with the Eraser tool to rub out those
unwanted pixels.
The pixels disappear as you drag the cursor over them.

I
n the course of laying out the pages of your Web site, you may want to
change the size or color of an image so that it fits more naturally into
your design. In this chapter, we show you how to manipulate images, or
parts of images, to create effects from subtle to extreme.
Scaling Graphics
When we talk about scaling graphics, we’re talking about changing the size of
a bitmap or vector shape on the canvas, not changing the size of your over-
all image (that is, everything on the whole of your canvas). To find out how
to change the canvas size, see Book III, Chapter 2. You can change the size of
an image element or selected part of an image element in two ways:
✦Use the Scale tool: Click and drag the image object or selection. Use
this option if you want to figure out the proper size of the image by eye-
balling it.
✦Change the numbers in the Property inspector: Type numbers in the
width and height boxes. Use this option if you have exact dimensions in
mind for your image.
You can use both methods fairly simply, and you get identical results
(whether you drag an object to a specific width or type that width into the
Property inspector, the resized object looks the same).

Scaling Graphics
330
When you scale or resize a bitmap, the new version of the image will suffer
some degradation. The more extreme the change in size, the more glaring
will be the degradation. One of the advantages of vectors is that they can be
scaled and resized without suffering any degradation.
Using the Scale Transformation tool
You can change the size of an object, either retaining its proportions or dis-
torting it, by using the Scale tool. To change the size of an object by using
the click-and-drag method, follow these instructions:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool from the Select section of
the Tools panel and then click the object you want to resize.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Select the Scale tool — it looks a bit like a baseball diamond — from
the Select section of the Tools panel or choose Modify➪Transform➪
Scale.
A box with eight handles and a center point overlays the selected object.
You can also select the Scale tool by clicking the arrow next to
Transform Tools in the Image Editing panel.
3. Click and drag one of the handles to scale the object in one of two ways:
• To scale the object while retaining its proportions: Click one of the
corner handles (make sure that the cursor looks like a double-sided
arrow) and drag the object to the desired size.
• To scale the object and distort its proportions: Click and drag the
middle handle on either the left or right side of the box around the
object (make sure that the cursor looks like a double-sided arrow) to
change the object’s width, or click and drag the center handle on
either the top or bottom of the box around the object (make sure
that the cursor looks like a double-sided arrow) to change the
object’s height.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around
the object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show
the new dimensions as you drag (see Figure 4-1).
When the cursor looks like a three-quarter circle with an arrow, you
can rotate the image rather than resize it. See the “Rotating graphics”
section, later in this chapter, for details on rotating images.
4. Release the mouse button.
Fireworks redraws the image to your selected size.

5. Click and drag to reposition the image, if necessary.
The cursor changes into a four-pointed arrow when you place it over 
the redrawn image, which indicates that you can move the image. (See
Figure 4-2.) You can remove the transform handles by double-clicking
the image, which also changes the tool to the Pointer tool.

Resizing by entering numerical values
Sometimes you have a space with a defined width and height into which you
want to place images of that exact width and height. If the images aren’t
already sized to fit that space, and you have calculated the exact propor-
tions or aren’t worried about distorting the images, use the following
method to resize the images.
To change the width, height, or both of an image by typing in a new value for
the width and/or the height, just follow these steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool, click the object you want
to resize.
See Book III, Chapter 3 for more information on selecting image objects
or parts of image objects.
2. In the Property inspector, double-click or highlight the number in the
Width field, as Figure 4-3 shows you, and type in a new number.
If you can’t see the Width and Height fields, your Property inspector
may be collapsed. To expand the panel, click the downward-pointing
arrow at the bottom-right corner of the panel. If you can’t see the
Property inspector on-screen, press Ctrl+F3 to open it.
3. If you don’t want to change the height, press Enter to implement the
width change.
Fireworks redraws the selection at the new width.
4. If you want to change the height, select the number in the Height field
and type a new value.
5. Press Enter or click in another value field.
Fireworks updates the height of the selection.

Distorting and Skewing Images and Text
333
Distorting and Skewing Images and Text
Changing the width but not the height of an image object, or changing the
object’s height but not the width, distorts the object along one axis. What if
you want to stretch one corner of an object but leave the rest of the object
more or less intact, or perform some other unusual stretching or shrinking?
You have the Distort and Skew tools at your disposal — they’re just hiding
behind the Scale tool. To access the Distort and Skew tools, click and hold
the Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select one of the
tools from the menu that pops up, or select the Scale tool and press Q on
your keyboard until the tool you want appears.
What’s the difference between skewing and distorting? Skewing is actually a
particular kind of distortion:
✦Distorting: Stretching or shrinking one or more sides of an image object.
✦Skewing: Distorting an image object by stretching or shrinking two of its
four sides while leaving the other two the same, or stretching or shrink-
ing three of the four sides of the object’s bounding box at once but not
changing the dimensions of the fourth side. Skewing can create the illu-
sion of perspective.
The Distort tool is far more versatile than the Skew tool:
✦You can use the Distort tool to resize along one axis, in which case you
scale the object.
✦You can use the Distort tool to stretch or shrink three sides of an object
simultaneously, in which case you skew the object.
✦You can use the Distort tool to create more complex forms of image
manipulation by both scaling and skewing the object, for example.
Distorting an image
To distort an object by using the Distort tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel and then
click the object that you want to distort.
2. Select the Distort tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Distort.
If you want to select the tool from the Tools panel, click and hold on the
Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select the Distort
tool from the pop-up menu. A box with eight handles and a center point
overlays the selected object.

Distorting and Skewing Images and Text
334
You can also select the Distort tool from the Image Editing panel by
clicking the arrow next to Transform Tools and selecting Distort from
the options that appear.
3. Click and drag any handle.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the new
dimensions as you drag, as you can see in Figure 4-4. The cursor becomes
a double-sided arrow as you place it over a center or middle handle.
When you try to drag handles too far (if you try to drag a middle-left
handle above the top-left handle, for example), the dotted line stretches
to wherever you drag the handle, but when you release the mouse
button, the image snaps to the farthest allowable point in the direction
you dragged. In short, a handle can’t cross other handles.
4. Click and drag any other handles.
You can stretch and squash the image by dragging as many handles as
many times as you want.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection.
Skewing an image
To skew an image, follow these simple steps:
1. With the Pointer tool or Subselection tool, click the object that you
want to skew.

2. Select the Skew tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Skew.
If you want to select the tool from the Tools panel, click and hold on the
Scale tool in the Select section of the Tools panel and select the Skew
tool when the pop-up menu displays the Skew and Distort tools. A box
with eight handles and a center point overlays the selected object.
You can also select the Skew tool from the Image Editing panel by click-
ing the arrow next to Transform Tools and selecting Skew from the
options that appear.
3. Click and drag any handle:
• The center handles: On the top and bottom, these handles can skew
a side of the image left or right.
• The middle handles: The handles on the left and right can skew a
side of the image up or down.
• The corner handles: These handles behave differently, depending on
whether you drag them along the left-right axis or the up-down axis.
However, no matter which axis you drag along, the handles spread
the selected side of the image along that axis. For example, if you
select the top-left corner and drag up, the bottom-left corner
stretches down proportionally.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the new
dimensions as you drag, as shown in Figure 4-4. The cursor becomes a
double-sided arrow as you place it over a center or middle handle. The
arrow indicates in which directions you can drag the handle.
4. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Distorting and skewing text
In Fireworks, you can distort text as easily as you can distort images. To 
distort the text in a text box while leaving the text editable, just follow these
steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel and then
click the text box that you want to distort.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but you can’t distort
only part of the text in a text box. You can, however, Shift+click two text
boxes and distort them together.

2. Select the Distort tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Distort.
If you want to select the tool from the Tools panel, click and hold on the
Scale tool in the Tools panel and select the Distort tool from the pop-up
menu. A box with eight handles and a center point overlays the selected
text box.
You can also select the Distort tool from the Image Editing panel by
clicking the arrow next to Transform Tools and selecting Distort from
the options that appear.
3. Click and drag any handle.
By default, Fireworks continues to display the original box around the
object, but it adds a version of the box with a dotted line to show the
new dimensions as you drag. The cursor becomes a double-sided arrow
as you place it over a center or middle handle.
When you try to drag handles too far (if you try to drag a middle-right
handle above the top-right handle, for example), the dotted line
stretches to wherever you drag the handle, but when you release the
mouse button, the image snaps to the farthest allowable point in the
direction that you dragged. In short, a handle can’t cross other handles.
4. Click and drag any other handles.
You can stretch, squash, and drag as many handles as many times as
you want.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, as Figure 4-5 shows you.

To skew a text box, follow these simple steps:
1. Using the Pointer tool in the Tools panel, click the text box.
You can also select the text box by using the Text tool, but either way,
you can’t distort only a part of the text in a text box.
2. Select the Skew tool from the Tools panel or choose Modify➪
Transform➪Skew.
If you want to select the tool from the Tools panel, click and hold on the
Scale tool in the Tools panel and select the Skew tool when the pop-up
menu displays the Skew and Distort tools. A box with eight handles and
a center point overlays the selected text box.
You can also select the Skew tool from the Image Editing panel, by click-
ing the arrow next to Transform Tools and selecting Skew from the
options that appear.
3. Click and drag any handle:
• The center handles: On the top and bottom, these handles can skew
a side of the text left or right.
• The middle handles: The handles on the left and right can skew a
side of the text up or down.
• The corner handles: These handles behave differently, depending 
on whether you drag them along the left-right axis or the up-down
axis. However, no matter which axis you drag along, they spread the
selected side of the text along that axis. For example, if you select
the top-left corner and drag up, the bottom-left corner stretches
down proportionally.
4. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
You can align text along a vector shape or path. See Book III, Chapter 3 to
find out more about aligning text.
Rotating and Flipping Graphics and Text
As is the case with resizing, Fireworks allows you to rotate and flip 
everything on the canvas simultaneously, but it also allows you to select
individual graphic elements (image objects) and rotate or flip them 
independently.

Rotating and Flipping Graphics and Text
338
Rotating graphics
You can rotate a graphic in two ways:
✦Rotate a preset amount: Fireworks offers a quick way to rotate a graphic
either 90 or 180 degrees around its center point.
✦Rotate any amount: You can click and drag to rotate an image around 
its center point, or even move the point and rotate the image around a
point not at the image’s center.
To rotate a graphic by 90-degree increments, follow these steps:
1. Select the object by using the Pointer tool or Subselection tool.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose how you want to rotate the object:
• To rotate the object 180 degrees (turning it upside down): Choose
Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 180 Degrees.
• To rotate a graphic 90 degrees clockwise (to turn it sideways to the
right): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees CW, or press
Ctrl+Shift+9.
• To rotate a graphic 90 degrees counterclockwise (to turn it side-
ways to the left): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees
CCW, or press Ctrl+Shift+7.
Rotating an object freehand requires a couple of extra steps, but it gives you
much finer control over the degree of rotation. To rotate an object any
amount around its center axis, just follow these steps:
1. Select the object by clicking the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and
clicking the object on the canvas.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Free Transform (or Scale, Skew, or
Distort).
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T to access the Free
Transform command. When you’re rotating an object, it doesn’t matter
which tool you choose.
3. Place your cursor over the canvas.
The cursor changes into a rounded arrow, as you can see in Figure 4-6.
4. Click and drag the cursor in any direction.
If you drag down or to the right, the image rotates clockwise; if you drag
up or to the left, the image rotates counterclockwise.

If you hold down the Shift key while rotating your graphic, you restrict
the angle of the rotation to 15-degree increments.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Rotating text
In Fireworks, you can rotate text essentially the same way that you rotate a
graphic. To rotate a text box in 90-degree increments, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool in the Tools panel and then
click the text box.
You can also select the text box by using the Text tool, but either way,
you can’t rotate only a part of a text box.
2. Choose how you want to rotate the text:
• To rotate the text box by 180 degrees (turning it upside down):
Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 180 Degrees.
• To rotate a text box 90 degrees clockwise (to turn it sideways to
the right): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees CW, or
press Ctrl+Shift+9.
• To rotate a text box 90 degrees counterclockwise (to turn it side-
ways to the left): Choose Modify➪Transform➪Rotate 90 Degrees
CCW, or press Ctrl+Shift+7.

1. Use the Pointer tool or Subselection tool to select the text box that you
want to rotate.
You can rotate only the entire text box.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Free Transform (or Scale, Skew, or
Distort).
You can also use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T to access the Free
Transform command. When you’re rotating a text box, it doesn’t matter
which tool you choose.
3. Place your cursor over the canvas.
The cursor changes into a rounded arrow.
4. Click and drag the cursor in any direction.
If you drag down or to the right, the text box rotates clockwise; if you
drag up or to the left, the text box rotates counterclockwise.
5. Press Enter or double-click anywhere on the canvas.
Fireworks updates the selection, the transformation handles disappear,
and the tool reverts to the Pointer tool.
Flipping images
Fireworks lets you flip images vertically and horizontally. You can do both
manipulations in a snap.
To flip an image horizontally (making it a mirror image of what it was origi-
nally) or vertically (turning it upside down), follow these steps:
1. Select the object you want to flip.
2. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Horizontal to make a mirror image
of the object; choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Vertical to turn the
object upside down.
Depending on which choice you make, your selection either flips hori-
zontally, as Figure 4-7 shows you, or vertically, as you can see in Fig-
ure 4-8.
Flipping text
Fireworks lets you flip text boxes vertically and horizontally. Both manipula-
tions are a piece of cake.

Follow these steps to flip a text box horizontally (making it a mirror image of
what it was originally) or vertically (turning it upside down):
1. Select the text box that you want to flip with the Pointer tool or
Subselection tool.
You can also select the text box using the Text tool, but either way, you
can’t distort only a part of a text box.

Adding Gradients, Textures, and Patterns 
to Shape Fills and Bitmap Selections
In Book III, Chapter 3, we show you how to fill a vector shape with a color. In
this section, you find out how to treat your shape to a fancier filling: a gradi-
ent, a pattern, and (or) a texture. Gradients, patterns, and textures can add
the illusion of depth to your images. They also increase the file size of your
images because they’re difficult to compress, so you may want to use them
sparingly.
Introducing gradients
A gradient is a subtle blend of one color into another. A classic example of 
a gradient in nature is a sky at sunset (or sunrise, if you ever wake up that
early). Near the horizon, the sky is a deep, bright orange; straight up, the sky
is a dark blue. In between those two colors is a bunch of transitions: from
bright orange to pale orange to pale blue to dark blue. The transitions are so
subtle, it’s difficult to say where one color leaves off and another begins.
That’s a gradient.
Fireworks ships with a wonderful array of useful gradient patterns, which
you can access through a pop-up menu in the Property inspector:
✦Linear
✦Starburst
✦Radial
✦Folds
✦Rectangle
✦Ellipse
✦Cone
✦Bars
✦Contour
✦Ripples
✦Satin
✦Waves
The fact that this page is in black and white doesn’t do these gradients jus-
tice compared to what they look like in full color, but you can still get a
pretty good idea of the variety of the gradients by checking out Figure 4-9.

Book III
Chapter 4

Adding Gradients, Textures, and Patterns 343
You can choose any colors to make your gradients, but Fireworks also has
the following handy preset gradient options:
✦Blue, Yellow, Blue
✦Silver
✦Cobalt Blue
✦Spectrum
✦Copper
✦Violet, Orange
✦Emerald Green
✦White, Black
✦Pastels
✦Black, White
✦Red, Blue
✦Blue, Red, Yellow
✦Red, Green, Blue
To add a preset gradient fill to a vector shape, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.
2. Click and hold the Fill Categories box next to the Paint Bucket icon in
the Property inspector.
3. Choose Gradient.
4. Select a gradient type from the menu (see Figure 4-10).
The default colors for gradients are black and white. If you want those
colors for your gradient, congratulations! You’re done! If not, continue to
the next step.

5. Click the Fill Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Property
inspector.
A pop-up window, like the one in Figure 4-11, appears:
• At the bottom of the pop-up window, you can see a preview pane,
which shows what the gradient pattern will look like when you apply
it to the shape. (Figure 4-11 shows the selected pattern, Cone.)
• In the middle of the window lies the Preset drop-down list, from
which you can choose preset colors for your gradient.
• At the top of the window, you can find a simpler preview strip that
shows color but not pattern information. Above and below that strip
are sliders. The sliders above give you control over the opacity of
each color in the gradient; the sliders below give you control over
the amount of each color in the gradient.

6. Select preset colors for your gradient from the Preset drop-down list.
The preview panes and the selected shape update.
Different presets have different numbers, or instances, of colors. The
Cobalt Blue preset, for example, creates its opalescent glow with two
instances each of three colors.
7. Click anywhere outside the pop-up window to make the window 
disappear.
You have to go through a number of steps to add a user-defined gradient fill
to a vector shape, but you can make the process as simple or complex as
you want. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.
2. Click and hold the Fill Categories box next to the Paint Bucket icon in
the Property inspector.
3. Select a gradient type from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 4-10).
The default colors for gradients are black and white.
4. Click the Fill Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Property
inspector.
A pop-up window appears (which you can see in Figure 4-11).
5. Click the left color slider, as Figure 4-12 shows you.
When you place the cursor over a slider, the cursor becomes a solid
black arrow with no stem. When you click and release the slider, the
color picker pops up. To get the lowdown on the color picker, see 
Book III, Chapter 3.
6. Select a color from the color picker.
Your cursor is an eyedropper in the color picker.

7. If you want more than two colors in your gradient, click anywhere
between the two default color sliders. If not, skip to Step 12.
Your cursor becomes an arrow with a small plus sign (+) when you move
it between the existing color sliders. After you click, a new slider
appears, and your cursor becomes a solid black arrow with no stem
until you move it off the new slider.
By default, the color of the new slider is the color in the strip directly
above where you clicked.
8. If you want to change the color of the new slider, click it and release.
When you click and release, the color picker pops up.
9. Select a color by using the eyedropper.
10. If you want, move the new color slider left or right to change where
the new color blends with the other colors.
11. If you want more than three colors in your gradient, repeat Steps 7
through 10.
12. Click the right color slider.
13. Select a color by using the eyedropper.
14. If you want, move any of the sliders horizontally to adjust where their
respective colors fall in the gradient.
15. If you want, adjust the opacity of the entire gradient or vary the opac-
ity of different parts of the gradient.
By default, the opacity of both ends is set to 100 percent (no background
shows through). You can add and adjust opacity sliders just as you can
color sliders, and they work in more or less the same way.
When you click an opacity slider, a pop-up window displays a slider that
goes from 0 percent at the left (no gradient shows in front of the back-
ground) to 100 percent at the right.
16. Click anywhere outside the pop-up window to make it disappear.
After you add a gradient fill to your shape, you can rotate, skew, move, and
change the width of the gradient. See the Fireworks Help files (found in the
Help menu) for details.
To remove a color slider or opacity slider (you must have at least two colors
to make a gradient, of course), click and drag it up out of the gradient pop-
up window. When you release the mouse button, the slider disappears, and
you have a less complex gradient fill.

Follow these steps to add a gradient fill to a bitmap selection:
1. Using the appropriate Tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools panel,
select the part of the bitmap image that you want to fill.
In most cases, the Magic Wand tool works best for this job. For more
information on selecting parts of image objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Click the Color box next to the Paint Bucket icon in the Colors section
of the Tools panel.
The color picker appears.
3. Click the Fill Options button at the bottom of the color picker.
A new pop-up window appears in place of the color picker.
4. Select a gradient pattern from the drop-down list.
5. Follow Steps 4 through 6 in the steps that describe adding a preset
gradient fill to a vector shape, or Steps 4 through 6 in the steps that
describe adding a user-defined gradient fill to a vector shape, both of
which you can find a little earlier in this section.
6. Click the Paint Bucket tool.
7. Click anywhere in the selected area to apply the gradient fill.
Adding patterns
You get Fireworks CS3 already loaded with a dizzying array of patterns with
names like Bubbles, Flames, Moon, and three varieties of Oil Paint. Fireworks
has so many patterns, we don’t have room to list them all here. As with gra-
dients, Fireworks shows you a preview of each pattern as you roll over its
name with your mouse. How do you get to the pattern names? Just follow
these steps to add a pattern to a vector shape:
1. Select the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape that
you want to add a pattern to.
2. Click and hold the Fill Categories box next to the Paint Bucket icon in
the Property inspector.
3. Choose Pattern.
4. Select a pattern type from the menu.
Each pattern appears in a preview window next to its name as you roll
over the name. When you release the mouse button, the pop-up menu
disappears and the pattern is applied to your shape.

Adding textures
You can add textures to your fills and bitmap selections even more easily
than you can add gradients. You can even have fills with both a gradient and
a texture, or with both a pattern and a texture, though combining gradients
or patterns with textures often diminishes the graphic power of both in a
given image.
Fireworks ships with more than 50 textures. To add a texture to a vector
shape, follow these steps:
1. Click the Pointer tool or Subselection tool and click the shape.
If the shape is transparent, you need to add a color or gradient fill. If the
shape has a transparent fill (no fill), the Texture list box is inactive.
2. Click and hold the arrow in the Texture drop-down list.
You can find this list under the Edge drop-down list in the Property
inspector.
3. Select a texture from the drop-down list.
The drop-down list displays the built-in textures. If you have additional
textures on your computer, select Other from the list and browse to the
texture you want to use.
When you release the mouse button, the texture is applied to the shape
fill with the default opacity of 50 percent.
4. Type a value or drag the slider in the Amount of Texture field (next to
the Texture drop-down list) to set the opacity of the texture.
You don’t see any of the texture with a setting of 0, and a setting of 100
shows the texture at full (100 percent) opacity.
Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
Fireworks has plenty of useful presets and defaults for the novice user, and
enough tweakability to satisfy almost any professional. Pros especially appre-
ciate the amount of control Fireworks gives users in the area of color adjust-
ment. Blend modes offer another way to adjust the color information of
objects. You can find out more about blending modes in Book III, Chapter 5.
You can accomplish many of the effects that we describe in the following
sections in two basic ways:
✦Using Photoshop Live Effects: These effects, formerly known simply as
Live Effects, act a bit like putting on a pair of sunglasses. You don’t
change the colors of whatever you’re looking at; you put something

Book III
Chapter 4
Transforming Text,
Shapes, and Images
Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters
349
between you and the object that changes the appearance of the object.
You can turn Photoshop Live Effects off and on without changing the
pixels that make up the object to which you apply the effects. If you
change the object in your Web page design later or repurpose it else-
where, perhaps with different effects applied, you can use Photoshop
Live Effects to apply nondestructive changes to the object in a particular
PNG file. Nondestructive means that the object itself is unchanged, but
how the object appears on-screen changes. You can apply Photoshop
Live Effects only to whole objects, not to parts of objects.
And now in Fireworks CS3, you can apply Photoshop Live Effects to
whole layers simultaneously. Also, Layer Effects applied in Photoshop
can be edited in Fireworks.
✦Using Filters: You can think of this method as destructive because it
alters the pixels in the bitmap. This approach is like making everything
you see yellow by painting everything yellow. Though the process is
destructive, it isn’t permanent — as long as you have the Undo com-
mand available.
We show you how to use the Filters method in the following sections. 
Fine-tuning your colors
We touch briefly on the color adjustment tools at the end of Book III, Chap-
ter 3, but here we go into a bit more detail. The color adjustment controls
available from the Filters menu are as follows:
✦Auto Levels: In theory, an optimal image has an even distribution of
dark tones, medium tones, and light tones. Auto Levels sets levels auto-
matically so that shadows, midtones, and highlights are evenly distrib-
uted in your image.
✦Brightness/Contrast: Controls the overall luminosity of a selection and
the contrast of color shades within a selection.
✦Curves: Offers a way to modify very specific colors without affecting
others.
✦Hue/Saturation: Controls the tones and intensities of colors within a
selection.
✦Invert: Allows you to reverse the colors in a selection to make some-
thing that looks like a photographic negative.
✦Levels: As with curves, the Levels filter allows you to modify colors, but
it does so by letting you adjust shadows, midtones, and highlights of one
of the three individual color channels (red, green, or blue) or all chan-
nels together.

Adjusting Color Information and More with Filters

To change the brightness or contrast of a graphic or selection, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Brightness/Contrast.
A dialog box with separate sliders for brightness and contrast appears.
3. If you want to lighten or darken your selection, click and drag the
Brightness slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100 units
to darken the selection, or you can drag right up to 100 units to lighten the
selection. If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can
see the change to your selection when you release the mouse button.
4. If you want to alter the relationship between the dark and light pixels
in your selection, click and drag the Contrast slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100 units
to reduce the contrast in the selection, or you can drag right up to 100
units to increase the contrast in the selection. If the Preview check box
is selected, as it is by default, you can see the change to your selection
when you release the mouse button.
5. Click OK.
All colors on a computer monitor are formed from the combination of the
three color channels: red, green, and blue. You can change the curves for the
individual color channels or for the combination of all channels. You can
make curve adjustments for bitmaps only, not shapes. If you want to adjust
the color of a vector shape using curve values, convert it to a bitmap first
(select the object and choose Flatten Selection from the Options menu in the
Layers panel). To change the curve of the RGB channels, follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Curves.
A dialog box with a grid appears, as you can see in Figure 4-13. The
grid’s horizontal axis shows the original brightness of the pixels in your
selection. The grid’s vertical axis shows the new brightness of the pixels.
3. Choose a channel from the Channel drop-down list.
Your choices are RGB (all channels), Red, Green, or Blue.

351
4. Click anywhere along the line in the grid and drag to adjust the curve.
When you click the line, Fireworks generates a handle automatically. The
end points always remain where they start, but you can add handles
anywhere else on the line and drag them to new points. You can delete
handles by dragging them up out of the dialog box. You can type a
numerical value into the Input and Output text fields instead of dragging
the line, if you prefer.
If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the
changes when you release the mouse button after dragging a handle.
Clicking the Auto button restores the line to its original setting.
5. Click OK.
Follow these steps to change the hue, saturation, and (or) lightness of a
graphic or selection:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Hue/Saturation.
A dialog box with separate sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
pops up.
3. If you want to change the basic color of your selection, click and drag
the Hue slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –180
degrees, or you can drag right up to 180 degrees. (You can think of the
slider as a flattened circle, the way a map of the Earth is a flattened
globe.) If the Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can
see the change to your selection when you release the mouse button.
Figure 4-13:

the Curves
dialog box is

4. If you want to alter the intensity of the colors in your selection, click
and drag the Saturation slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100 units
to reduce the color saturation in the selection, or you can drag right up
to 100 units to increase the color saturation in the selection. If the
Preview check box is selected, as it is by default, you can see the change
to your selection when you release the mouse button.
5. If you want to alter the luminosity of the colors in your selection, click
and drag the Lightness slider.
The default position is at the center. You can drag left down to –100 units
to reduce the lightness of the selection, or you can drag right up to 100
units to increase the lightness of the selection. A setting of –100 gives
you black, and a setting of 100 gives you white. If the Preview check box
is selected, as it is by default, you can see the change to your selection
when you release the mouse button.
6. Click OK.
If you want to change the hue, saturation, or both of black or white pixels,
select the Colorize check box and then make your adjustments.
To invert the colors of a graphic or any selection, follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Invert, or use the key command
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I (Ô+Opt+Shift+I on a Mac).
The colors of your selection are inverted, as in a photographic negative.
The Levels command lets you make color corrections to an image or selec-
tion by altering the balance of highlights, midtones, and shadows. You call
the graphical representation of the distribution of shades a histogram.
To adjust the levels of an image or image selection, follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Levels.
The Levels dialog box appears, as Figure 4-14 shows you.

3. Choose a channel from the Channel drop-down list.
Your choices are RGB (all channels), Red, Green, or Blue.
4. Click and drag the Input shadows slider (the black triangle at the left
under the histogram) to adjust the blacks in the selected image.
You can’t drag the shadows slider farther right than the midtones slider
because shadows must always be darker than midtones. The slider scale
goes from 0 (no brightness, which is black) to 255 (full brightness, which
is white). The midtones slider moves automatically when you move the
shadows slider.
5. Click and drag the Input midtones slider (the gray triangle in the
middle under the histogram) to adjust the midtones (grays).
You can’t drag the midtones slider farther left than the shadows slider
or farther right than the highlights slider. The midtones slider’s scale
goes from 0 to 10.
Dragging the midtones slider to the right generally darkens the selec-
tion, and dragging it to the far left can create something resembling a
posterization effect, in which transitions between colors happen
abruptly rather than smoothly.
6. Click and drag the Input highlights slider (the white triangle at the
right under the histogram) to adjust the whites in your image.
You can’t drag the highlights slider farther left than the midtone slider
because highlights must be lighter than midtones.
7. Click and drag the Output shadows and highlights sliders as needed.
You can move these sliders past each other. Moving the darkness slider
all the way to the right and the lightness slider all the way to the left
inverts the colors in the selection.
8. Click OK.
If you click Cancel, your adjustments aren’t implemented. If you click the
Auto button, Fireworks sets the optimal color balance automatically.

To let Fireworks set the optimal levels automatically, you can click the Auto
buttons in the Curves and Levels dialog boxes, or you can select a graphic 
or part of a graphic and then choose Filters➪Adjust Color➪Auto Levels or
press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A (PC only; no Mac shortcut equivalent).
Blurring and sharpening
Blurring a graphic or selection can add a sense of softness to an image;
sharpening, on the other hand, can add a sense of solidity or hyper-reality to
an image. Note that the Sharpen command can’t correct a blatantly out-of-
focus photo; nothing can.
To blur an image or part of an image using Fireworks presets, simply follow
these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Blur➪Blur.
For a more pronounced effect, choose Filters➪Blur➪Blur More. You can
also click Filters on the Image Editing panel and choose Blur or Blur
More from the list that appears.
3. Click OK.
You can also use the Blur tool from the Bitmap section of the Tools panel to
“paint” a blur across your image. If you want to blur multiple small parts of
an image, you may find the Blur tool more effective.
If you want more control over the amount of blur in your image, you can
employ the Gaussian Blur filter by following these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Blur➪Gaussian Blur.
The Gaussian Blur dialog box appears.
3. Click and drag the slider to set the radius of the blur.
The radius can be set from 0.1 (hardly noticeable blur) to 250.0 (nearly
total blur).
4. Click OK.

You can get other blur filters as well, including Motion, Radial, and Zoom,
each with its own properties and settings. Experiment to find the filter that
gives you the effect you’re looking for.
To sharpen an image or selection by using Fireworks presets, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Sharpen.
For a more pronounced effect, choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Sharpen More.
3. Click OK.
If you want more control over the amount and manner of the sharpening,
you can use the Unsharp Mask filter. This filter works by strengthening the
contrast between adjacent pixels, which makes edges between areas of color
more sharply defined. Actually, all the Sharpen filters work this way, but with
Unsharp Mask, you can create your own settings for three aspects of the
sharpening process:
✦Sharpen Amount: Determines the amount of contrast introduced
between adjacent pixels
✦Pixel Radius: Determines the size of the area around each pixel that gets
sharpened
✦Threshold: Determines which pixels get sharpened, based on the exist-
ing contrast levels in the selection or image
Follow these steps to sharpen an image or selection, using the Unsharp Mask
filter:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Sharpen➪Unsharp Mask.
The Unsharp Mask dialog box pops up.
3. Click and drag the Sharpen Amount slider.
The slider goes from 1 percent (not very much) to 500 percent (very
strong contrast).

4. Click and drag the Pixel Radius slider.
The slider goes from 0.1 (hardly noticeable) to 250.0 (very strong effect).
5. Click and drag the Threshold slider.
The slider goes from 0 (change all pixels) to 255 (change no pixels).
6. Click OK.
Using the other filters: Convert 
to Alpha and Find Edges
The Convert to Alpha filter makes your selection transparent. The lighter the
pixel, the more transparent it becomes. White pixels, for example, seem to
disappear, allowing the background to show through fully. Black pixels, on
the other hand, remain black and completely opaque.
To convert a selection to Alpha, follow these simple steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Other➪Convert to Alpha.
The selection is converted.
3. Click anywhere on the canvas or press Ctrl+D to deselect your 
selection.
The Find Edges filter makes a photograph look like a line drawing by greatly
simplifying the color information in the image.
To use the Find Edges filter, just follow these steps:
1. Select a graphic or part of a graphic.
For more information on selecting image objects or parts of image
objects, see Book III, Chapter 3.
2. Choose Filters➪Other➪Find Edges.
The selection takes on the appearance of a line drawing.
3. Click anywhere on the canvas or press Ctrl+D to deselect your

Adding shadows to objects
You can add several kinds of shadows to objects in Fireworks CS3. Two of
the most useful shadows are
✦Drop shadows: Create the illusion that text or objects are floating above
the surface of the canvas.
✦Shadow auto shapes: Adjust shadow auto shapes as if changing the posi-
tion of the light source that’s making the text or object cast a shadow.
To add a drop shadow to an object, simply select the object and click the +
(Plus) button next to Filters in the Properties panel. Then choose Shadow
and Glow➪Drop Shadow. You can edit various properties of the drop shadow
by clicking the Information button (the white, italic i in a blue circle in the
Filters section of the Properties panel). To add a shadow auto shape to an
object, select the object and choose Commands➪Creative➪Add Shadow.
You can edit the offsets and width of the auto shape using the Auto Shape
Properties panel.
Adding Photoshop Live Effects
With Fireworks CS3, you now have a new set of options for effects such as
drop shadows, glows, bevels, and the like: Photoshop Live Effects. The new
effects include the following:
✦Drop Shadow: Makes an object appear to be floating above other objects.
✦Inner Shadow: Adds dark pixels inside an object to make it appear as
though you can see through it to its shadow on a surface below.
✦Outer Glow: Adds a halo around the outside edges of an object.
✦Inner Glow: Adds a halo to the inside edges of an object.
✦Bevel and Emboss: Adds shading to make an object appear to be stick-
ing up from or sinking below the surface of the canvas.
✦Satin: Adds shading to an object to give it the shiny appearance of satin.
✦Color Overlay: Adds a layer of color of adjustable opacity over an
object.
✦Gradient Overlay: Adds one of five types of gradient to the inside of an
object.
✦Pattern Overlay: Adds a pattern inside an object.
✦Stroke: Adds a line to the edges of an object. You can choose the color,
thickness, and position of the line.

Many of the Photoshop Live Effects duplicate image-transforming effects of
their namesake filters. But Photoshop Live Effects have two important differ-
ences from Filters:
✦Live Effects are nondestructive (they don’t change the object to which
they’re applied; instead, they change the object’s appearance).
✦Live Effects can be applied to layers, not just objects.
To apply a Drop Shadow Live Effect to an object, follow these steps:
1. Select an object by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The object is highlighted on the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. Click the + (plus) button in the Filters section of the Properties panel
and click Photoshop Live Effects at the bottom of the menu that
appears.
The Photoshop Live Effects window appears.
3. Click the check box next to the words Drop Shadow.
The drop shadow appears on the canvas, as shown in Figure 4-15.

4. Select the opacity of the shadow by typing a number in the Opacity
text field or clicking the arrow next to the text field and dragging the
slider that appears.
The values range from 0 at the bottom of the slider (totally transparent)
to 100 at the top of the slider (completely opaque).
5. Select a distance by entering a number in the Distance text field or
clicking the arrow next to the text field and dragging the slider that
appears.
The range of numbers available is 0 to 250, from the bottom of the slider
to the top. The higher the number, the higher above the surface of the
canvas the object appears to float.
6. Select an angle by typing a number in the Angle text field or clicking
the arrow next to the text field and clicking and dragging the control
that appears.
The angle control sets the position of the light source that is causing the
object to cast a shadow. The range of values is –180 to 180. A positive
value makes the shadow fall below the object, and a negative value
makes the shadow fall above the object.
7. Select a color for the shadow by clicking the Color square and click-
ing a square in the color picker.
For more information on the color picker, see Book III, Chapter 3. The
default color for drop shadows is black.
8. Select a size by entering a number in the Size text field or clicking the
arrow next to the text field and dragging the slider that appears.
The range of values is from 1 at the bottom of the slider (thin shadow)
to 250 at the top of the slider (wide shadow).
9. Select a spread by entering a number in the Spread text field or clicking
the arrow next to the text field and dragging the slider that appears.
The range of values is from 0 at the bottom of the slider (shadow appears
diffuse) to 100 at the top of the slider (shadow appears to have solid
edges).
10. Select a Noise value in the Quality section by entering a number in the
Noise text field or clicking the arrow next to the text field and drag-
ging the slider that appears.
The range is from 0 at the bottom of the slider (no noise, a smooth
shadow) to 100 at the top of the slider (lots of noise, a grainy shadow).
11. Leave the Layer Knocks Out Drop Shadow check box selected if you
want the object to obscure the shadow beneath it.
Otherwise, if your object has an opacity of less than 100% and you want
to see the shadow through the object, click the box to deselect it.

E
verything that you put on your canvas in Fireworks CS3 — everything
that you draw, type, paste, or import — exists in a layer. And every
layer exists in a frame. Initially, you may think this concept seems simple
enough, but it’s more involved than it first appears. Frames can share layers,
and a single layer can contain a single object (a bitmap, shape, or text) or
multiple objects. A large file can actually get pretty complex; it can have
dozens of bitmaps, shapes, and text blocks. Layers give you a way to organ-
ize your Fireworks PNG images so that you can easily turn groups of objects
on or off (make the groups of objects visible or hide them), put objects on
top of or beneath other objects, lock groups of objects so that you can’t
modify them, and find objects easily.
Users of Photoshop will be delighted to find that with this new release,
Fireworks files can now be organized into hierarchical layers, which gives
you finer control over the objects in your PNGs. This style of organization
also removes a major hassle to working with Photoshop files, because previ-
ous versions of Fireworks did not preserve Photoshop’s hierarchical layer
structure.
Frames, on the other hand, offer a way to organize layers so that you can
export multiple states of buttons (different versions of the button, such as
those versions that appear when the user rolls over or clicks the button)
and animated GIFs quickly and easily.
The Web Layer, the repository for slices and hotspots, is always the top
layer, as shown in Figure 5-1. You create slices in the Web Layer in order to
cut your page design into individual images. After you slice images, you can
optimize, export, and place them in HTML pages, where you can hyperlink

Managing Layers
364
them. You create hotspots in the Web Layer to make images that you can
export for your Web page along with some HTML code that specifies areas in
the image that you want hyperlinked. You can make the Web Layer visible or
invisible, and you can lock and unlock it, but you can’t delete it.
Managing Layers
You can think of a layer as a transparent folder that holds “files” (image
objects and text objects). (Check out the little folder icons next to the layer
names in Figure 5-1.) You can copy or move the individual objects to other
layers, delete them, name them, rename them, and so on. The power of
layers comes from the fact that you can group objects into layers. Then you
can copy, move, name, and delete whole groups of objects simultaneously.
And you can make everything in a layer visible or invisible with one click of
the mouse. Sublayers offer a deeper level of organization, which comes in
handy if you have lots of objects and you want to be able to organize them
so that you can quickly turn on and off elements of your design.
Take a closer look at the Layers panel. Looking left to right at an unexpanded
layer, you can see the following across five columns:
✦The Show/Hide layer button: An eye appears in this column when the
layer is visible on the canvas. When the layer is invisible on the canvas,
the column is empty. Click in the column to toggle the layer’s visibility
on the canvas off and on. When you export images from your PNG, only
visible objects are exported.
✦The Lock/Unlock button: If you click this column of a collapsed layer, a
lock appears, indicating that you can’t edit any of the objects on that
layer. If you click the layer name (in the fourth column) or turn on the
Show/Hide layers button (in the second column), a pencil appears in the
third column, indicating that the layer is unlocked and active. If the layer

stack of
layers in
their
collapsed
states.

Book III
Chapter 5

and Frames

is unlocked and active, you can edit the objects in the layer. You can
have only one layer active at a time, though you can unlock or lock any
number of layers simultaneously. You can, of course, make individual
objects visible or invisible, and locked or unlocked.
✦The Expand/Collapse button: A right-pointing arrow in the box indi-
cates that you can expand the layer. A downward-pointing arrow in the
box indicates that you can collapse the layer. Click the arrow to toggle
between expanded and collapsed views of the layer.
✦The layer name: By default, Fireworks names each layer for the order in
which you created it. The first layer is called Layer 1, the second layer 
is called Layer 2, and so on. (To find out how to give the layer a more
meaningful name, check out the “Renaming a layer” section, later in this
chapter.) When the layer is active, the layer name is highlighted in the
Layers panel and the folder icon to the left of the name appears open.
The sublayer name is indented slightly to denote its sublayer status (see
Figure 5-1, in which “HTML text” is a sublayer of the “Foreground” layer).
From here on, we often use the term layer to apply to both layers and
sublayers except when the two function differently.
✦The layer status: When the layer is active, a box appears in the fifth
column. The box’s fill color corresponds to the color of the outlines
around the selected object on the canvas and in the Layers panel.
Adding and deleting layers and sublayers
When you add a new layer to your PNG, the new layer always gets added
above the currently selected layer. You can add a layer or sublayer in three
easy ways:
✦Click the New/Duplicate Layer button (the folder with the plus sign on
it) or New Sub Layer button (the folder with the right-angled arrow) at
the bottom middle of the Layers panel.
✦Choose Edit➪Insert➪Layer (there’s no menu item for sublayers in the
Insert menu).
✦Choose New Layer or New Sub Layer from the Layer panel’s Options
menu (the bulleted list icon at the right of the panel’s title bar).
In either case, the new layer appears in the Layers panel, with the layer’s
default name highlighted. The newly created layer or sublayer is active until
you click another layer or sublayer, or an object on the canvas that resides
in another layer or sublayer.
To delete a layer or sublayer, click it in the Layers panel and drag it to the
Delete button (the garbage can icon) at the bottom right of the Layers panel.
You can also click the layer and then click the Delete button in the Layers
panel.

Managing Layers
366
Making a layer active
You can have only one layer or sublayer active at a time. However, you can
have many objects on a layer ready to edit at the same time, which can come
in handy when you want to move several objects the same amount and in
the same direction. To change any object in a layer, you need to make the
layer active, as follows:
✦Make a layer active: Click an object on the canvas that’s in that layer or
click the name of that layer in the Layers panel.
✦Make a layer inactive, but not locked: Click an object on the canvas
that’s not in that layer, or click the name of another layer in the Layers
panel.
Sometimes when you have an object from one layer selected and you click
an object on another layer to make it active, the item that you’re trying to
select doesn’t highlight. Why not? Look closely: You have selected a new
layer, just not the one that you want. Often you find yourself in this position
if you have a very large object on the bottom layer of your file; when you try
to click something in front of it, Fireworks thinks you’re trying to click the
large object on the bottom layer, so it highlights that object rather than the
smaller object (the one that you’re trying to select) in front of it. Luckily, you
can just click the object that you want to select in the Layers panel to make
it active, or you can lock the layers that are “in the way” so that you can
click the object on the canvas.
To select multiple neighboring objects or layers in the layers panel, simply
click the first object or layer that you want to select and then Shift+click the
last one. All the objects and layers in between are also selected.
Expanding and collapsing layers
Because files can contain many layers, and layers can contain many objects,
and you have only so much room for the Layers panel, Fireworks lets you
expand and collapse a layer as you need:
✦Expand a layer: Click the right-facing arrow in the third column of that
layer. Each object in that layer appears on its own line below the layer
name. Each object has its own Show/Hide button, as well as a thumbnail
of the object and a name.
✦Collapse a layer: Click the downward-facing arrow. If the layer is active,
it remains so until you click another layer or an object on the canvas
that resides on another layer.
Figure 5-2 shows the Layers panel with some layers collapsed and some
layers expanded to show the objects they contain. Several layers are locked,
and the layer called “shapes” is active, as indicated by the pencil icon.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of Layers

Making a layer visible or invisible on the canvas
The more complicated your designs get, the more you show and hide layers,
making them visible or invisible. Luckily, you can show and hide layers
easily, as follows:
✦Make a layer visible (show a layer): Click in the first column or the
name column of the Layers panel.
✦Make a layer invisible (hide a layer): Click the Hide Layer button (the
eye icon) in the first column.
If you export your design as images (so that you can use the images in a Web
page), objects on hidden/invisible layers don’t export. In other words, what
you see on the canvas when you export is what you get in your exported
images folder.
Locking and unlocking a layer
Sometimes when you have many overlapping objects, selecting some objects
without selecting others can get difficult. To prevent accidentally moving or
deleting objects, you can lock the layer that they’re on.
✦Lock a layer: Click in the second column. If the column is blank when
you click in it, the lock appears. If the column has a pencil in it, the
pencil changes to a lock, and the pencil appears in an adjacent layer, if
you have one.
✦Unlock a layer: Click the lock in that layer. You don’t automatically make
a layer active by unlocking it.

Managing Layers

Renaming a layer
By default, each nontext layer is named for the order in which you created it.
The first layer is called Layer 1, the second is called Layer 2, and so on (the
numbering scheme extends to sublayers).
If you have only a couple of layers in your document, that naming scheme
may work just fine. If you have dozens of layers, on the other hand, you
probably want to place similar objects together on layers and then name the
layers. By doing so, you can tell with a quick glance at the Layers panel
where the objects are.
When you add text to a layer, Fireworks automatically names the layer based
on the text that you enter. If you enter a paragraph of text, you don’t have to
remember the whole thing; Fireworks uses only the first 20 characters of text
for the layer name.
To rename a layer from its default name, just follow these simple steps:
1. Double-click the layer name.
A simple dialog box appears. The current name is highlighted in the text
field.
2. Type a new name.
You don’t need to click in the text field because the current layer name
is already highlighted. If you want to keep part of the current name, use
your mouse to select the part of the name that you want to replace or
remove and type over or delete it.
3. If you have multiple frames in your document and you want this layer
to be visible in the other frames, select the Share Across Frames check
box (this doesn’t apply to sublayers, which inherit the sharing prop-
erty of the layer they’re part of).
Otherwise, move on to Step 4.
4. Press the Enter key.
The dialog box closes, and your layer has a new name.
Moving a layer in front of or behind other layers
As you add layers to your PNG file, they stack up. Figure 5-3 illustrates the
relationship between objects, their position on the canvas, and their posi-
tion in the Layers panel. The before part (on the top) of Figure 5-3 shows the
bowling ball in front of both pins, and in the Layers panel, the object named
“bowling ball” is above the “pin” objects. The after part (on the bottom) of
Figure 5-3 shows the large pin in front of the bowling ball. The ball, in turn, is
in front of a smaller bowling pin. In the Layers panel, the ball object is
between the pin objects.

You can change the order of a layer or object in one of two ways:
✦Move a layer or object in front of another: Click the name column of
the layer or object and drag it up. A black horizontal line appears when
you roll over a spot where you can place the layer or object. Release the
mouse button to drop the layer or object in its new location.
✦Move a layer or object behind another: Click the name column of the
layer or object and drag it down. A black horizontal line appears when
you roll over a spot where you can place the layer or object. Release the
mouse button to drop the layer or object in its new location.
Merging layers
Sometimes in the process of creating a PNG document, you find that you
need all the objects you’ve made, but you don’t need them to be on so many
layers. If, on the other hand, you want to move all the objects in one layer to
another, and you have quite a few objects in each layer, you probably want
to merge the layers.
To merge all the objects on one layer into a single bitmap object in the layer
immediately underneath, follow these steps:
1. Click in the name column of the layer in the Layers panel.
Make sure that all the objects in the layer are highlighted. (If they’re not,
you may have clicked an object in the layer rather than the layer itself.)
2. If necessary, drag the layer so that it’s on top of the layer that you
want to merge it into.
You use the Merge Down command in Step 3, so you need to make sure
the two layers are one on top of the other.
3. Click the Options menu icon (it looks like a bulleted list) at the top
right of the Layers panel and select Merge Down.
The selected layer merges into the one below it. The objects in the
upper layer are combined into a single bitmap object in the new layer. 
You can’t edit text in the new object, and vector shapes in the new
object are now bitmaps.
You can also use the key command Ctrl+E to merge a layer into the one
below it, or choose Modify➪Merge Down.
To merge all the visible layers together into one, do the following:

and Frames
Using Layers for Masking
371
1. Click in the name column of any layer in the Layers panel.
2. Choose Modify➪Flatten Layers.
Your document now has a single layer. Each object remains separate
from the others.
Using Layers for Masking
A mask is a layer that you create specifically to let some areas of an image
show while you keep other areas hidden. Fireworks uses two kinds of 
masks — bitmap masks and vector masks (you can use text as a vector
mask). Both kinds of masks have one thing in common — what they do:
When you lay a mask over an image, the mask blocks out parts of the image
and lets other parts show through. The shape of the mask determines which
parts show through and which are blocked out, as Figure 5-4 shows you.
When you use a bitmap mask, the grayscale values of the mask determine
what, and how much, shows through. The lighter the pixel, the more the
object or objects beneath show through. The darker the pixel, the less the
stuff underneath shows through.
A vector mask, on the other hand, uses the shape outline of the vector object
like a cookie cutter. However, Fireworks gives you a lot more flexibility than
you have with a real cookie cutter! For example, you can anti-alias (smooth
out jagged edges) and even feather (blur) the edges of your mask, or you can
change the size of your mask at any time after you’ve created it.

Using Layers for Masking
372
Fireworks offers many ways to create masks. We cover the basics here, but
you can always refer to the Fireworks Help files if you want to explore masks
in more depth.
Creating a bitmap mask
To make a bitmap mask using an existing bitmap, follow these steps:
1. If you want to mask multiple objects, group them by selecting them
and using the key command Ctrl+G.
2. Select the object you want to use to make the mask.
You can select multiple objects to make a mask by Shift+clicking them, but
if you do, Fireworks automatically makes a vector mask, not a bitmap
mask. See the section “Creating a vector mask,” later in this chapter, if you
want to make a vector mask that uses multiple bitmap objects.
3. Choose Edit➪Cut or press Ctrl+X.
Cut? That’s right. We have you paste the shape in Step 5.
4. Select the layer, object, or group you want to be visible through the
mask by selecting it in the Layers panel or on the canvas.
The layer, object, or group is highlighted.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste as Mask.
All the parts of the masked image that fall outside the masking object
disappear. In the Layers panel, the mask icon shows up in the third
column, and a link icon and thumbnail of the mask shape show up next
to the thumbnail of the masked image.
6. If it’s not already selected, select Alpha channel in the Property
inspector.
When the mask is selected in the Layers panel, the Property inspector
offers two options for a bitmap mask: Mask to Alpha Channel and Mask
to Grayscale (the default), as Figure 5-5 shows you. Mask to Alpha
Channel uses the transparency of the mask bitmap, and Mask to
Grayscale uses the brightness of the pixels in the mask bitmap.
Figure 5-5:
You can
change 
the Mask
setting in
the Property
inspector.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of Layers
and Frames
Using Layers for Masking
373
You can think of bitmaps as having four channels: Red, Green, Blue, and
Alpha. The Red, Green, and Blue channels describe the amount of each of
those colors in every pixel in the bitmap. The Alpha channel contains infor-
mation about the level of transparency of each pixel in the bitmap.
You can hide a mask temporarily by clicking it in the Layers panel and then
choosing Disable Mask from the Layers panel’s Options menu (the bulleted
list icon at the top right of the panel). The mask icon disappears from the
Show/Hide object column and a red X appears over the mask, indicating that
the mask is disabled. To re-enable the mask, simply click it.
To make a bitmap mask by creating an empty mask and modifying it, follow
these steps:
1. Select the object you want to mask by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Click the Mask button at the bottom of the Layers panel or choose
Modify➪Mask➪Reveal All.
The Mask icon is the rectangle with a dotted circle inside. Reveal All
means that the mask you made is completely transparent until you
modify it.
3. Select a paintbrush or other drawing tool and draw on top of the
bitmap.
Wherever you draw, the mask blocks the image behind.
What if you want to do the opposite — reveal what’s underneath only where
you draw? Easy! Just follow these steps:
1. Select the object you want to mask by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Choose Modify➪Mask➪Hide All.
Hide All means that the mask you made is completely opaque until you
modify it, so when you first apply the mask, it looks as though your
masked object has disappeared.
3. Select any color other than black.
Because the opaque areas of the mask appear black, you have to draw
the areas that you want to show through by using any other color.
4. Select a paintbrush or other drawing tool and draw on top of the
bitmap.
Wherever you draw, the mask reveals the image behind.

Using Layers for Masking
374
You can delete a mask by clicking it in the Layers panel and then choosing
Delete Mask from the Layers panel’s Options menu (the bulleted list icon at
the top right of the panel). When you delete a mask, a dialog box appears to
give you the option to apply the mask before deleting it, which changes the
masked image.
Creating a vector mask
To make a vector mask, such as the one shown in Figure 5-6, follow these
steps:
1. Select a text block or vector shape by clicking the shape on the canvas
or in the Layers panel.
The object is highlighted on the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. Drag the shape or text over the object or objects you want to mask.
The layer with the shape doesn’t have to be on top of the layers with the
objects you want to mask, but you can position the shape more easily if
you can see it!
3. Choose Edit➪Cut or press Ctrl+X.
You paste the shape in Step 5, so you need to cut it here.
4. Select the layer or object you want to be visible through the mask by
clicking it in the Layers panel or on the canvas.
The layer or object is highlighted.

5. Choose Edit➪Paste as Mask.
All the parts of the masked image that fall outside the mask shape or
text disappear. In the Layers panel, the mask icon shows up in the third
column, and a link icon and thumbnail of the mask shape appear next to
the thumbnail of the masked image, as shown in Figure 5-7.
Using the Web Layer
The Web Layer was the greatest innovation of the original version of Fire-
works, and even if it no longer seems revolutionary, it’s still as handy a fea-
ture as you come across in making Web pages. The Web Layer lets you cut
your page layout into slices, which are pieces of your layout that end up as
individual images on your Web page, held in place by HTML or CSS. The Web
Layer also lets you name and optimize each slice individually, which means
that you can find the best balance of file size and image quality for each
piece of your layout. Just as important, because it’s a repository for slice
information, the Web Layer lets you save slice coordinates, dimensions, and
optimization settings along with everything else in your PNG file.
You never have to leave the Fireworks application to ready your images for
the Web, and you don’t have to write down or remember your image size,
placement, and optimization settings if you ever need to remake an image.
The Web Layer also lets you see at a glance where your slices are, which
helps you re-create your page design in HTML. For details about slices and
image optimization (including when to use GIFs and when to use JPEGs), see
Book III, Chapter 6.
Standard HTML pages are built on a grid system of cells organized into rows
and columns. The rows and columns make up a table. You can have multiple
tables on a Web page, and you can even have tables within tables within
tables. You can set the height of each row and the width of each column indi-
vidually, but you can’t make a round cell or a triangular table.
Figure 5-7:
An active
mask in the
Layers
panel.

Using the Web Layer
376
If you use Fireworks to make your HTML, each slice that you make in your
PNG ends up as an image that fills a table cell in your Web page. Using
Dreamweaver, you can combine multiple images in a single cell in your
HTML code, but Fireworks isn’t made to work that way.
Think of your Web page design as a rectangular sheet cake. You can make
the decorations on top of the cake all kinds of shapes, but when you cut the
cake, you probably make rectangular slices, cutting right through text, slic-
ing a single icing rose into four pieces, and so on. You ignore the design on
the surface of the cake because you’re more interested in slicing the cake
quickly and controlling the size of each piece. But you may make a few spe-
cially cut pieces if somebody really wants the blue rose near the top or the
exclamation points from the text that says, “Happy Birthday!!!”
When you’re cutting up a Web page, you want certain pieces to remain intact
(a corporate logo or a navigation button, for example), but other objects fit the
HTML grid structure better if you slice them into pieces or include them with
other objects on a single piece. If you have an object with round edges, you
need to slice it into rectangles so that you can reconstruct it on a Web page, 
as with the bowling ball shown in Figure 5-8. You re-create the bowling ball in
HTML as three stacked rectangles. The middle slice in Figure 5-8 is selected, so
its name and image compression type appear at the top left of the slice.

Using the Web Layer

Cutting your objects with the Slice tool
The Slice tool, which you can find in the Web section of the Tools panel, looks
like a utility knife on a green square with red lines on each side. When you
employ the Slice tool, the slices you create are added automatically to the Web
Layer.
To make a slice in your PNG file, follow these steps:
1. Select the Slice tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag diagonally on the canvas to make a rectangle.
The slice shows up as a green overlay on the canvas.
Slicing your canvas more exactly 
with the Polygon Slice tool
The Slice tool has a partner “hidden” behind it in the toolbar: the Polygon
Slice tool, which you can get to by clicking and holding the Slice tool until
the pop-up menu containing the Polygon Slice tool appears, or by clicking
the Slice tool and pressing K on your keyboard.
You can probably guess that the Polygon Slice tool lets you make nonrec-
tangular slices. But wait! Didn’t we say that slices and images have to be rec-
tangular? The short answer is that the Polygon Slice tool doesn’t create a
nonrectangular slice — it creates a rectangular slice with a polygonal hotspot
(a polygonal area that you can hyperlink in combination with some HTML
code) inside.
So what’s the difference between a polygonal hotspot made by the Polygon
Slice tool and one made by the Polygon Hotspot tool? The Polygon Hotspot
tool doesn’t make a slice, it just makes an irregularly shaped linkable area in
a slice. (A slice may contain many hotspots, each linked to a different page.)
The Polygon Slice tool, on the other hand, makes both hotspots and slices. 
If you have a map of the United States, and you want each state to link to its
own HTML page, use the Polygon Hotspot tool to make linked areas in the
shape of each state. (For more information on the Polygon Hotspot tool, see
Book III, Chapter 6.) If you just have a few irregularly shaped buttons, you
can use the Polygon Slice tool to make a linkable image.
To make a polygonal slice, follow these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Slice tool from the Slice tool menu in the Web area
of the Tools panel.
If the regular Slice tool is showing, click and hold the Slice tool button 
to reveal the pop-up menu so that you can select the Polygon Slice tool.

Working with Objects
378
2. Click a series of points to make a polygonal shape.
Fireworks automatically draws straight lines to connect each point to
the last. You don’t need to click the first spot to close the shape.
You can make a polygon slice to match any vector shape by using the Insert
Polygon Slice command. Simply select the shape and choose Edit➪Insert➪
Polygon Slice, or press Alt+Shift+P.
Working with Objects
In the world of Fireworks, an object is any self-contained bitmap, vector
shape, or text block that can appear on the canvas. The object may include
blank space, and you can make a single object out of many objects (as you
do when you merge layers, which you can read about in the section “Merging
layers,” earlier in this chapter). In general, you want to leave anything in
your design that you may want to edit individually as a single object.
Renaming an object in the Layers panel
By default, each object is named for its type (path, bitmap, and so on), but you
can individually rename them. As with layers, being able to name objects in
the Layers panel becomes crucial as you add more elements to your design.
The Layers panel does contain thumbnails of each object, but if you have mul-
tiple similar objects in several places on the canvas, you may want a way to
tell the objects apart in the Layers panel.
To rename an object, double-click the current name of the object in the Layers
panel and type a new name in the text field that appears. Press Enter or click
outside the text field to save the new name. Renaming an object makes it
active. When the object is active, the line around the icon is highlighted and
the column’s background becomes gray (light blue on a Mac).
Moving an object between layers
You may want to move an object from the layer it was originally created on
to a different layer. For example, you may want an object to be stacked on
top of or under other items on the canvas and have other objects in the
layer remain exactly where they are. Luckily, you can move an object from
one layer to another in a snap.
To move an object from one layer to another, click the name column of the
object in the Layers panel and drag it to a new location. A black horizontal
line appears when you roll over a spot where you can place the object.
Release the mouse button to drop the object in its new location.

Setting an object’s opacity/transparency
You can set each object’s transparency independently by using the slider
near the top left of the Layers panel. By default, objects are completely
opaque, and the opaque object completely blocks out whatever objects are
underneath it, as in Figure 5-3. You can make the objects on a layer semi-
transparent, which allows the objects underneath to show through by an
adjustable amount.
The extreme ends of the Opacity/Transparency scale are 100 percent opaque
(which can also be thought of as 0 percent transparent) and 0 percent opaque
(100 percent transparent). When you add an object to the canvas, its default
opacity of 100 shows up at the top left of the Layers panel and in the object’s
Property inspector.
To adjust the transparency of a layer, follow these simple steps:
1. Click the name column of the object that you want to adjust or click
the object on the canvas to select the object.
The object is highlighted on both the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. Click and drag the Opacity/Transparency slider to adjust how opaque
you want the object to be.
The Opacity/Transparency slider is the button with the downward-
pointing arrow located near the top left of the Layers panel, next to 
the Opacity text field. (You can find an identical slider in the Property
inspector.)
3. Release the mouse button when you get to the setting you want.
You can also type a number from 0 to 100 into the text field next to the slider
to set the object’s transparency. Remember to press the Enter key to apply
the new setting.
Fireworks can do a few fancier tricks with opacity. For example, you can set
an opacity gradient to make some parts of your object more transparent
than others. See the following section for more information on this topic.
Blending
Blending one object with another involves varying the transparency of the
top object so that some of the bottom object shows through. But blending in
Fireworks involves more than just adjusting opacity. With Fireworks CS3, you
can choose from a whopping 47 blending modes, in conjunction with the
Opacity control and the colors of your objects, to produce different blending
effects. Some of the most common blending modes are listed in Table 5-1.

Working with Objects
380
Table 5-1
Blending Modes
Mode
What It Does
Normal
The default blending mode. Actually, no blending goes on at all.
Darken
Replaces pixels of the top object that are lighter than the pixels in the object
underneath with the darker pixels from below.
Multiply
Multiplies the value of each pixel of the top object with each pixel of the
objects underneath, which generally results in a darker color.
Lighten
Replaces pixels of the top object that are darker than the object underneath
with the lighter pixels from the object below.
Screen
Divides the value of each pixel of the bottom object by each pixel of the object
on top and produces a lighter color.
Difference
Subtracts the darker color from the color with more brightness, regardless of
which is on top.
Hue
Replaces the luminance and saturation of a pixel on top with those values of
the pixel underneath.
Saturation
Replaces the hue and luminance of a pixel on top with those values of the
pixel underneath.
Color
Replaces the luminance of a pixel on top with that of the pixel underneath, but
keeps the hue and saturation of the top pixel the same.
Luminosity
Replaces the hue and saturation of the pixel on top with those values of the
pixel underneath, leaving the luminance of the pixel on top.
Invert
Changes the colors of the pixels in the object underneath to their opposites,
regardless of the colors of the object on top.
Tint
Adds gray to the areas of overlap.
Erase
Removes all pixels in the overlapping areas, leaving a hole in the canvas. Any
objects underneath the object with a blend mode of Erase become invisible
where the objects overlap.
Additionally, Fireworks CS3 debuts seven blend modes inherited from
Photoshop CS2:
✦Dissolve
✦
Linear Light
✦Linear Burn
✦
Pin Light
✦Linear Dodge
✦
Hard Mix
✦Vivid Light
See your Fireworks documentation for details, or better yet, experiment!
Seeing what the blending modes do by choosing different ones and changing
their settings is much more worthwhile than reading technical explanations
of what they’re doing — and it’s more fun!

Chapter 5

Working with Objects
381
Layers can have blending modes, but the blending mode settings of individ-
ual objects on the layer override the settings of the layer that they’re on. So
different objects on the same layer can have individualized blend settings.
The blending mode of a group of objects, however, overrides the blending
modes of individual objects within the group. Removing the blending mode
of the group restores the blending modes of the individual objects.
To blend an existing object with whatever is under it, just follow these steps:
1. Select the object you want to blend by clicking it on the canvas or in
the Layers panel.
2. Select a blending mode from the drop-down list at the top-right of the
Layers panel.
When you release the mouse button, the blend mode takes effect.
3. If you want, adjust the transparency of the object by typing a value
between 1 and 100 in the Opacity text field next to the blending mode
list or by using the Opacity/Transparency slider between the Opacity
text field and the blending mode list.
The blended object affects (or is affected by) any objects that you put under
the blended object where both objects overlap.
You can also establish a blend’s opacity and mode before you create an
object. You do so by setting the properties of a drawing tool in the Property
inspector, as you can see in Figure 5-9. (Note: Not all tools permit you to set
the object properties before you create the object.) Your settings apply
every time you use that tool. Remember, blend settings of individual objects
override the blend settings of the layer the objects are on.
To set the blend before you draw, follow these steps:
1. Press Ctrl+D or choose Edit➪Deselect to make sure that you don’t
have any objects selected.
If you have an object selected, you may accidentally change its blending
mode when you’re trying to set a blending mode for the object you’re
about to create.
2. Select a drawing tool, such as the Brush tool.
You can’t change the blending mode of some tools from the default,
which is Normal.
3. Select a color for the tool.

Working with Objects
382
See the section on adding color in Book III, Chapter 2 if you don’t know
how to select a color for the tool. You can always change the color of the
object later, but that can get complicated, especially if you have a spe-
cial blending mode and opacity set.
4. Select a blending mode from the drop-down list in the tool’s Property
inspector.
5. If you want, set an opacity for the tool by typing a value in the
Property inspector’s Opacity text field.
You can also set the opacity by dragging the Property inspector’s
Opacity/Transparency slider (the button with the downward-pointing
arrow between the Opacity text field and the blending mode list).
6. Use the tool to make your vector shape or bitmap.
The tool’s blend and opacity settings remain in effect until you change
them. After you create an object, you can always adjust its blend and
opacity settings. You may want to create a new layer (see the section
“Adding and deleting layers and sublayers,” earlier in this chapter)
before making a new object. If you don’t make a new layer, remember
that the object’s blend settings override the layer’s blend settings.

The Power of Layers
and Frames
Managing Frames
383
Managing Frames
Given all that you can do with layers, you may be wondering why you need
these things called “frames.” Frames are essentially sets of layers that let you
do two things that layers alone can’t accomplish:
✦Export multiple button states (different versions of the button, such as
those versions that appear when the user rolls over or clicks the button)
simultaneously
✦Create and export animated GIFs (files that contain multiple GIF images
displayed in sequence)
You can think of layers as stacked one on top of the other; you may want to
think of frames, on the other hand, as a series, each following the previous in
the same location but at a later time, like a flip book. Each frame is distinct
from the others. A given frame may share layers or objects with other
frames, but the shared layers or objects usually change from one frame to
the next (the objects are a different color, have a different effect applied to
them, or are at different coordinates). These differences make up multiple
button states or animated GIFs.
The Frames panel (see Figure 5-12) displays frames in much the same way as
the Layers panel displays layers, except that the Frames panel doesn’t show
the objects contained within each frame.
As with layers, you can duplicate, add, and delete frames. You must have at
least two frames in your Fireworks PNG file in order to export buttons with
rollover states or animated GIFs.
Adding frames
By default, your Fireworks PNG has a single frame, which contains all the
layers in the file. To add a frame to your file, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Options menu (the bulleted list icon) at the top right of the
Frames panel and choose Add Frames or Duplicate Frame from the
menu.
Choose Duplicate Frame if you want to copy the objects in the current
frame to the new frames. Choose Add Frames if you want to add empty
frames to your file. Either the Add Frames or Duplicate Frame dialog box
(which you can see in Figure 5-10) appears, both of which have identical
parameters.

Managing Frames
384
2. Enter a number or click the arrow next to the text field to use a 
slider to set the number of frames that you want to add:
• For a simple rollover, you want one additional frame, for a total of
two frames in your file.
• If you want your button to have an on state as well as a highlight
(rollover) and normal state, you want two additional frames, for a
total of three frames.
• If you want a highlight-while-on state, you want three additional
frames, for a total of four frames.
The slider goes from 0 to 10, but you can type in values higher 
than 10.
If your animated GIF has more than 20 frames, the file size may be too
large for you to use. For complicated animations, you’re better off using
Flash (see Book V for more information on Flash CS3).
3. Select one of the options for where you want to add the new frames in
reference to the current one.
You have the following options:
• At the Beginning: The first new frame becomes Frame 1 and the
remaining frames are numbered sequentially, regardless of how many
frames you currently have in your document, and regardless of
which frame is currently active.
• Before Current Frame: The frames are added before the currently
active frame.
• After Current Frame: The frames are added after the currently
active frame.
• At the End: The new frames are the last frames, no matter how many
frames you already have or which frame is currently active.
4. Click OK.

Deleting and editing frames
To delete a frame, click the frame in the Frames panel and drag it to the
garbage can icon at the bottom right of the Frames panel. To delete multiple
frames simultaneously, Shift+click all the frames in the Frames panel that
you want to delete and, while the frames are highlighted, click the garbage
can icon at the bottom right of the Frames panel.
You can select a frame for editing in two ways:
✦Click the frame in the Frames panel.
✦Click and hold the frame indicator at the bottom left of the Layers
panel. A drop-down list appears, giving you easy access to all the frames
in your document. Simply select the frame that you want to edit.
Renaming frames
You can easily rename frames: Double-click the frame’s name in the Frames
panel and type the new name in the text field that appears.
Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
Now that you know how to make and manage frames, you’re ready to use
them! In this section we cover how to create rollovers and animated GIFs,
both of which can add interest to your Web site.
Creating a rollover
Creating a button rollover really just involves making two (or three or even
four) versions, or states, of a button graphic, each on its own frame. Dream-
weaver lets you generate rollover code pretty easily, but you can also have
Fireworks make the rollover code along with the HTML. (See Book I for much
more about Dreamweaver.)
To make a simple button rollover, follow these steps:
1. Make a button, or set of buttons, using the processes outlined in 
Book III, Chapters 3 and 4.
The button can have text or an icon, it can have a shape or bitmap
under the text or icon, and it can be any shape or size you like (but you
probably want to keep it on the small side to limit file size and leave
room on your page for content). For easy housekeeping, if you’re creat-
ing a navigation bar, keep all the buttons for which you want to have
additional states on the same layer.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
386
2. Disable sharing across frames by double-clicking the layer and dese-
lecting the Share Across Frames check box.
By default, objects on layers aren’t shared across frames, so you may be
able to skip this step. If a layer is shared across frames, changes to any
objects in that layer appear in all frames. If a layer is shared across
frames, the Shared icon (which resembles a ladder or strip of film with
arrows on both sides) appears to the right of the layer name in the
Layers panel.
3. Add one frame after the current frame by clicking the New/Duplicate
Frame button in the Frames panel or by choosing Add Frames from
the Frames panel’s Options menu (the bulleted list icon at the top
right of the panel).
4. In Frame 2, edit the objects that make up your button to create a high-
lighted rollover state.
The highlighted rollover state is the image that swaps in when the user
rolls the cursor over the button.
You can make the text a different color or add a glow to it, or you can
make the vector shape or bitmap a different color. You have too many
options to mention here, really. Just make sure that the user can notice
the difference when he or she moves a cursor over the button.
5. Make a slice overlaying the button graphic.
See Book III, Chapter 6 for details on making slices, or just check out the
“Cutting your objects with the Slice tool” section, earlier in this chapter.
6. Click and release the mouse button in the middle of the slice to access
the Add Behavior pop-up menu and choose the Add Simple Rollover
behavior.
When a slice is active, you can see the Target icon in the middle of the
slice. When you place your cursor over the target, it becomes a hand.
If you want to test the rollover, click the Preview tab at the top of the canvas
to make the Preview pane active. Place your cursor over your button in the
Preview pane to see the Rollover behavior in action. Next, move the cursor
off the button to see the button return to its normal state; the change from
the rollover state back to the normal state is part of a Simple Rollover.
You can add an on state (for when the user is on the Web page that the
button represents) and a highlight-while-on state (for when the user rolls
over the button on the Web page that the button represents). You add these
states by repeating Steps 3 and 4 in the previous list, and you can add more
behaviors via the Behaviors panel. See Book III, Chapter 7 for further details.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
387
Creating an animated GIF
You may find that you can most easily create an animated GIF by building
one frame, duplicating it, editing that frame, duplicating it, and so on.
Fireworks has a display mode called onion skinning, which you may find
especially handy for building animated GIFs. With onion skinning turned on,
as Figure 5-11 shows you, you can see the frame you’re working on, plus
dimmed versions either of the next frame, the previous and next frames, or
all frames. That setup can greatly help you pace your animation to get the
illusion of smooth motion.
To activate onion skinning, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Onion Skinning button (the downward-pointing pentagon) at
the lower left of the Frames panel.
The Onion Skinning menu pops up.
2. Select one of the four options:
• Show Next Frame: Select the Show Next Frame option if you already
have your frames set up and want to check frames two at a time.
• Before and After: Select the Before and After option if you want to
see the previous and next frames, as well as the current frame.
• Show All Frames: Select the Show All Frames option to see all the
frames simultaneously.
Figure 5-11:
You can see
the current
frame plus
other
frames with

skinning on.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
388
• Custom: Select the Custom option if you want to set the number of
frames to be visible simultaneously and to customize their trans-
parencies.
3. Leave the Multi-Frame Editing option selected if you want to be able
to edit the objects in the visible but not current frames.
Use the Select Behind tool to select objects in frames other than the cur-
rent one.
When you duplicate a frame, you duplicate the objects in it. When you edit
an object in a frame, though, you change only that instance of it. In our 
bowling ball animation, which you can see in Figure 5-11, we rotated the ball
(as well as moved it left) in each frame to give the illusion that the ball is
rolling. If we want to, we can make the ball a different color in each frame, 
as well.
Setting the frame rate
The frame rate is the speed at which each frame follows the previous frame.
You can use the same rate all the way through the animation, or you can set
individually the amount of time each frame stays on-screen.
To set a constant frame rate, follow these steps:
1. Click the first frame and Shift+click the last frame in the Frames panel
to select all the frames.
All the frames are highlighted.
2. Double-click the frame delay column (the column on the right) of any
frame in the Frames panel.
The Frame Delay dialog box appears.
3. Type a number in the Frame Delay text field to set the amount of 
time in hundredths of a second that you want each frame to remain
on-screen.
If you want the frames to stay on-screen for more than a second, you need
to type a number over 100. For example, if you type 350, each frame stays
on-screen for 3.5 seconds. You don’t get much of an illusion of motion 
at that frame rate, however! The less time that you have each frame on-
screen, the more frames of your animation appear each second. The 
more frames per second, the smoother the animation looks. But the more
frames you have in your animation, the bigger the file.
4. Press Enter.

Book III
Chapter 5
The Power of Layers
and Frames
Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs
389
To change the amount of time one frame stays on-screen, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the frame delay column (the column on the right) of any
frame in the Frames panel.
The Frame Delay dialog box appears.
2. Type a new number in the Frame Delay text field to set the amount 
of time in hundredths of a second that you want the frame to remain
on-screen.
3. Press Enter.
To loop or not to loop
Fireworks lets you loop your animation, which causes it to automatically
start over at the beginning after playing the last frame. You can have the GIF
loop indefinitely, you can set it to play once (stopping at the last frame), or
you can make it play a designated number of times and then stop on the last
frame.
The default for animated GIFs is to loop endlessly. To make a GIF that stops
at the final frame, just follow these steps:
1. Click the GIF Animation Looping button (the oval with an arrow) at
the bottom of the Frames panel.
The Looping pop-up menu appears.
2. Select the number of times you want the animation to repeat, or select
No Looping if you want it to play only once.
Because you’re setting the amount of times you want it to repeat, if you
select 1, that means that the animation plays twice through and stops.
After you have made your choice, the choice appears next to the Loop
button, as you can see in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12:
The Frames
panel
shows the
frames’
settings.

Using Frames to Create Rollovers and Animated GIFs

The Frames panel, which you can see in Figure 5-12, shows what mode of
onion skinning is on, if any, and on which frames (first column); it also shows
the frame name (second column), frame delay (third column), and looping
information (bottom).
Previewing animated GIFs
You can preview animated GIFs in the Preview pane (click Preview at the top
of the canvas to view the Preview pane) or in the Original pane. You have
access to these controls in the order that they appear from left to right at
the bottom of the pane, as follows:
✦Go to First Frame
✦Play/Stop
✦Go to Last Frame
✦Go Back One Frame
✦Go Forward One Frame
The animation plays at the frame rate that you have set for it (see the sec-
tion “Setting the frame rate,” earlier in this chapter), and, conveniently, you
can adjust the frame rate in the Frames panel without leaving the Preview
pane. Your animation loops in the Preview pane even if you don’t have it set
to loop for export. Onion skinning is not visible in the Preview pane.

 Exporting your images for the Web
A
fter you design your page, you need to figure out how to translate your
design to the Web. If you’re planning to export HTML as well as images
from Fireworks and don’t want to mess with the code afterward, you don’t
have to. When you want to make changes to the Web page, you can do so in
Fireworks and then re-export the HTML and images.
Of course, you can also export all the images from Fireworks but generate
the HTML code in Dreamweaver. Regardless of your Web-coding skill level 
or your site maintenance needs, you probably want to slice and optimize
your images, and you can do so easily with Fireworks. The following section
explains the whys and hows of slicing your design in Fireworks; for more
information on image optimization, see the “Optimizing Your Images for the
Web” section, later in this chapter.
Exploring the Advantages of Using Slices
When you slice a page layout, such as the one in Figure 6-1, you want to 
optimize (reduce the file size of) your images so that you can reconstruct
your design with HTML in such a way as to balance image quality with
download time.
Slicing your design offers two advantages:
✦Individually optimized images: You can compress each sliced image by
a different amount by using the most appropriate method, giving you
maximum control over the balance between image quality and file size.

Exploring the Advantages of Using Slices
392
✦Gradual download: The browser displays each sliced image as it down-
loads to the user’s computer, so the page appears to build gradually.
Users find watching this process much more interesting than staring at 
a blank screen waiting for a complete page to load all at one time!
When you use slices in combination with frames, you gain other advantages
(for more on frames, see Book III, Chapter 5). You can export multiple images
simultaneously from a single slice, which is the easiest way to make buttons
that change based on user actions. (See the “Exporting Images” section, later
in this chapter, for the details on exporting multiple images from a single
slice.)
You can easily make a Web page with a single image, but that page may take
too long to download because the image file is so large. That’s where slices
come in. Although you don’t have a minimum or maximum number of slices
that you can make on a page, you don’t want to make too many slices.
Having many teeny-weeny images can give you a page that loads too gradu-
ally. You need to find a good balance.
Every image tag in a Web page’s HTML code results in a call to the Web site’s
host server. The more images that you have on your page, the more requests
for images the browser has to make, and the more images the server has to
send. That process can feel like having a waiter bring you a salad one piece
of lettuce at a time — with you having to request each piece!

Creating and Editing Slices
393
Creating and Editing Slices
In Book III, Chapter 5, we cover the basics of how to make a slice, but here we
give you some more details. So you don’t have to flip back to the previous
chapter, here’s a reminder on how to make a slice in your Fireworks PNG file:
1. Select the Slice tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
2. Click and drag diagonally on the canvas to make a rectangle.
The slice shows up as a green overlay on the canvas.
The default appearance of the slice is as a bright-green, semitransparent over-
lay. You can change the default color of slices in the Preferences settings if you
need to make the underlying images easier to see. You can also change the
color of an individual slice in the Property inspector when you have the slice
selected. Changing a slice color doesn’t affect the underlying image in any way.
One handy feature of the Slice tool is its snap feature. If you have navigation
buttons on the left side of your page, you may want the buttons all to be the
same width to simplify your HTML. When you have a single slice made for your
first button and you click and drag to make the slice for the second button,
Fireworks snaps to the identical width when you have your cursor within a few
pixels of it. Of course, you can also make sure they’re the same width by typing
a value into the width text field, or by copying and pasting the slice.
Naming a slice
When you name a slice, you’re doing more than making it easy to identify in
the Layers panel — you’re also naming the image for export. For that reason,
when you name a slice, you want to avoid using spaces or any special char-
acters that are illegal in filenames (Windows filenames cannot contain the
following characters: \ / : * ? “ < > |).
To name or rename a slice, just follow these steps:
1. Double-click the current name of the slice in the Layers panel.
A text field pops up, as you can see in Figure 6-2. By default, slices are
named “Slice.” If you don’t see the slices, you may have to expand the
Web Layer by clicking the triangle at the left.
2. Type a new name for the slice.
3. Press Enter.
When you select a slice, the Property inspector gives you access to the slice’s
name, dimensions, position on the page, and more. You can also change the
name of the slice in the Property inspector rather than in the Layers panel.

Moving a slice
You may find that you need to move a slice. For example, if you move some
elements in your design a few pixels one way or the other, the image under-
lying the slice may shift enough that you need to adjust the slice’s position.
You can choose between three basic ways of moving a slice:
✦Move a slice by clicking and dragging the slice. (In most cases, you prob-
ably want to use this method.)
✦Use the arrow keys to move a slice.
✦Change the X and Y coordinates of the slice in the Property inspector.
If you overlap slices on the canvas, the overlapped area appears only in the
image created from one of the slices — the one that appears higher in the
Layers panel.
To move a slice using the click-and-drag method, just follow these steps:
1. Click the slice on the canvas.
You can click anywhere on the slice except the corners and the center.
Clicking a corner or the center of a slice gives you special options to 
add behaviors (see Book III, Chapter 7 for the lowdown on behaviors).
2. Hold down the mouse button and drag the slice to its new location.
If you want finer control when you move a slice, you can use the arrow keys
to move a slice as follows:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Press the appropriate arrow key.
Each time you press an arrow key, the slice moves by one pixel. If you
hold down the Shift key and then press an arrow key, the slice moves by
ten pixels.

Sometimes when you want to line something up along one axis, you can most
easily line it up by selecting slices and typing the new X or Y coordinates for
each slice. The top-left corner of the canvas always has the coordinates (0, 0),
and coordinates are expressed in the form (X, Y), with X representing the hori-
zontal coordinate and Y representing the vertical coordinate. If your design is
800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high, the bottom-right corner has the coordi-
nates (800, 600).
A slice’s coordinates denote the position of its top-left corner on the canvas.
To move a slice when you know the exact pixel coordinates to which you
want to move it, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to slice parameters.
2. If you want to change the slice’s horizontal position, type a numerical
value in the Property inspector text field labeled X: and press Enter.
Your slice shifts left if you type in a lower number; the slice shifts right if
you type in a higher number.
3. If you want to change the slice’s vertical position, type a numerical
value in the Property inspector text field labeled Y: and press Enter.
Your slice shifts up if you type in a lower number; the slice shifts down if
you type in a higher number.
Resizing a slice
Sometimes after you make a slice, you decide that you need to resize the
underlying image. After you resize the image, you may want to resize the
slice. You may also need to resize a slice if you draw the slice quickly and
don’t make it big enough. As with moving a slice, you can resize a slice by
clicking and dragging or by typing new values.
To resize two dimensions of a slice simultaneously by using the click-and-
drag method, follow these steps:
1. Click a corner of the slice.
You have to click a handle at one of the corners to resize the slice. If you
click anywhere inside the slice (except the exact center) and drag, you
move the slice rather than resize it.
2. Drag the handle on the corner of the slice to the new location that you
want.

Creating and Editing Slices
396
If you want to change only the height, click and drag the top or bottom
border of the slice. If you want to change only the width, click and drag the
left or right border of the slice. When your cursor is over the border, it
changes into the Resize cursor, two parallel lines with an arrow pointing 
outward from each line, as you can see in Figure 6-3.
When you’re creating slices, their edges snap to edges of already created
slices, so if you don’t want that, you may find getting the edge of a slice
where you want it difficult. You can zoom in until you reach a magnification
at which you can resize the slice so that it doesn’t snap to the edge of the
other slice, or you can use the text fields in the Property inspector to change
the selected slice’s dimensions.
To resize a slice by typing new values, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The Property inspector changes to give you access to the slice’s 
parameters.
2. If you want to change the slice’s width, type a new numerical value in
the text field labeled W: and press Enter.
If you increase the width, you add pixels to the right side of the slice. If
you decrease the width, you take pixels away from the right side of the
slice.

3. If you want to change the slice’s height, type a new numerical value in
the text field labeled H: and press Enter.
If you increase the height, you add pixels to the bottom of the slice. If you
decrease the height, you take pixels away from the bottom of the slice.
Duplicating a slice
If you have a series of buttons, each of which you want to be the same width
and height, you can make one slice and duplicate it as many times as you
need. Of course, you also need to move each duplicated slice to overlay a
different button and name each slice according to the button it overlays. To
duplicate a slice, just follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Choose Edit➪Duplicate or press Ctrl+Alt+D (Ô+Opt+D on a Mac).
A duplicate slice appears on top of, but slightly offset from, the slice that
you duplicated.
If you clone the slice instead of duplicating it (choose Edit➪Clone or
press Ctrl+Shift+D), the new slice appears directly on top of the old one.
You can also copy and paste a slice, though that’s essentially the same
as cloning, except that it takes an extra step!
3. Move the slice to its proper location.
See the “Moving a slice” section, earlier in this chapter, for instructions.
Optimizing Your Images for the Web
To understand the process of optimization, you need to know about image
compression. When you compress an image, you reduce its file size by reducing
the amount of data in the file. The two main types of image compression are
✦Lossy: Some data is discarded from the image to make the file smaller.
✦Lossless: The data in the image is described in a more efficient way,
which makes the file smaller.
The two main compression methods used to format images for the Web are
✦JPEG: A lossy method, best used for photographs, gradients, and other
complex images that have many colors.
✦GIF: A generally lossless method, best used for images with large areas
of flat color, such as company logos. GIF images can have transparent
backgrounds.

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
398
Not sure which compression method you want to use for a particular slice?
The Preview panes come in handy for this job. You can use a Preview pane
any time that you have slices. They show you what the image looks like at
your chosen compression setting (or settings). See the section, “Previewing
Slices,” later in this chapter, for the details.
You can deal with compression by making a setting when you first make the
slice and making the fine adjustments later. It doesn’t really matter, though.
You can just leave each slice at the default setting until you’re ready to
export.
Working with the options in the Optimize panel
By default, the Optimize panel sits at the top right of the Fireworks window.
You can’t see it on-screen; choose Window➪Optimize or press F6 to open it.
Figure 6-4 shows the Optimize panel as it appears when you expand it and
select a slice.
The top drop-down list displays a saved setting. A saved setting is a group of
optimization options that includes the export file format and options appro-
priate to the selected export file format. (The upcoming sections “Making a
JPEG” and “Making a GIF” tell you about the main export file formats — JPEG
and GIF — and the options specific to each.)
Under the Saved Settings drop-down list, you can find the Export File Format
drop-down list. If you use a default setting from the Saved Settings drop-
down list, Fireworks automatically shows the file format in the lower list.
Otherwise, you have to select the export file format. We look only at JPEGs
and GIFs in this book because those file formats are by far the most common
Web formats, but Fireworks can export other formats as well.

We discuss the options displayed in the Optimize panel in the next two sec-
tions, “Making a JPEG” and “Making a GIF.” The Options menu icon (the bul-
leted list icon) at the top right of the Optimize panel provides access to the
Options menu, which offers its own set of choices. The items in the Options
menu vary, depending on the file type that you select in the Export File
Format drop-down list.
When you have JPEG selected, the Options menu offers the following:
✦Save Settings: This option lets you preserve your current compression
settings as a preset, which you can then select from the Saved Settings
drop-down list in the Optimize panel. You may find presets (custom or
not) useful for batch processing images (automating the export of multi-
ple images that use the same settings).
✦Delete Settings: This option does what you probably expect — deletes
your custom compression settings.
This option deletes all the settings.
✦Optimize to Size: This handy option lets you set a target file size for
your slice. Fireworks then makes the appropriate compression settings
to produce a file of your specified size.
✦Export Wizard: The Export Wizard walks you through the steps of
exporting an image with a series of dialog boxes.
✦Progressive JPEG: If you have this option selected when you export 
a slice, your JPEG contains two versions of your image. The first is a 
low-resolution version of the image that loads relatively quickly to a
browser. The second, which fills in over the first, is a higher-resolution
version. Although you need a shorter amount of time for this type of
image to become visible, you have a longer overall download time.
If you need your JPEG to be large (in terms of width and height) and of
high quality, consider exporting it as a progressive JPEG.
Flash can’t dynamically import progressive JPEGs, so if you want to 
link to a JPEG from an SWF file without embedding the graphic in the
Flash movie, make sure you don’t export the graphic as a progressive
JPEG.
✦Sharpen JPEG Edges: Select this option if you need to make image clar-
ity a priority (if, for example, you have small text in the image). Clarity
makes for larger file sizes.
✦Remove Unused Colors: When this option is selected, as it is by default,
Fireworks removes any color from the image’s palette that the image
doesn’t use. Smaller palettes mean smaller file sizes.

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
400
✦Show Swatch Feedback, Load Palette, Save Palette: These options
apply to 8-bit graphics (including GIFs; JPEGs are a 24-bit format).
Custom palettes are sets of colors to which you can limit images. See 
the Fireworks Help files or online resources for further details.
✦Help, Group Optimize With, Close Panel Group: These options don’t
relate only to JPEGs. See Book III, Chapter 1 for more information about
general panel options.
When you have GIF selected from the Export File Format drop-down list, the
Options menu makes some JPEG-specific options unavailable but offers the
following GIF-specific (8-bit graphic specific) options:
✦Interlaced: An interlaced GIF is similar to a progressive JPEG. A low-
resolution version of the graphic loads first (and fast), and the image
slowly transitions until it’s at its maximum resolution. As with progressive
JPEGs, the image loads faster initially, but the final version of the image
doesn’t load as quickly as it would if you hadn’t interlaced it. (You can
also export an interlaced PNG, which downloads in stages the way an
interlaced GIF does but has the larger file size of an uncompressed image.)
✦Remove Unused Colors: When this option is selected, as it is by default,
Fireworks removes any color from the image’s palette that the image
doesn’t use. Smaller palettes mean smaller file sizes.
For information about the default GIF settings, see the section “Making a
GIF,” later in this chapter.
Under the Optimize panel name, you can find the Saved Settings drop-down
list, which offers seven default settings (two for JPEGs and five for GIFs). You
can read about the GIF default settings in “Using the default GIF settings,”
later in this chapter. You can choose between two default settings for JPEGs:
✦JPEG — Better Quality: Makes a high-quality image, which results in a
bigger file size and a longer download time.
✦JPEG — Smaller File: Makes a small file, with a corresponding loss in
image quality.
The rest of the parameters in the Optimize panel vary based on what export
file format you choose. You can find out about them in the following sec-
tions, “Making a JPEG” and “Making a GIF.”
Making a JPEG
Because JPEG is a lossy compression method, you want a fair amount of con-
trol over just how much data gets discarded from your image. The higher the
amount of compression, the lower the image quality — but also the smaller

the file size and consequently the faster the download time. Fireworks gives
you a few options so that you can maximize image quality while minimizing
file size. See “Previewing Slices” in this chapter for information on how to
find out, before you export, what the image will look like and how big the file
will be.
Using the default JPEG settings
You can easily use a default setting on a slice. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select either JPEG — Better Quality or JPEG — Smaller File from the
Settings drop-down list in the Optimize panel.
The Image Type, Quality, and Smoothing drop-down lists update accord-
ing to the setting that you choose.
Using custom JPEG settings
To make or edit a custom JPEG setting, follow these steps:
1. Select the slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select JPEG from the Export File Format drop-down list in the
Optimize panel.
3. Type a number in the Quality text field or use the slider (click the
button next to the text field with the downward-pointing arrow to acti-
vate the slider) to set the image quality.
You can enter any whole number from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the
lowest quality and 100 the highest.
If you need a part of your image to be a higher quality than the rest,
follow the following set of instructions, which describe using the
Selective Quality option.
4. Set the smoothing, if you need to.
Smoothing blurs the image a little, reducing its quality but also reducing
its file size. You can type or select any whole number from 1 to 8, with 1
representing the least blurring and 8 representing the most blurring. If
you don’t want smoothing, leave it at its default setting, 0.
The Selective Quality option in the Optimize panel lets you compress differ-
ent parts of your image by different amounts. In some cases, you can use
Selective Quality as a great alternative to cutting a photograph into different
slices set at different compression levels.

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
402
Here’s how to use the Selective Quality option:
1. Click the Original button at the top left of the canvas if you aren’t
already viewing the Original pane.
2. Use a Selection tool to select the area of the image that you want to
compress differently than the rest of the image.
If the Web Layer is visible, you’ll need to click the Eye icon to make the
slice invisible in order to select an area.
3. Choose Modify➪Selective JPEG➪Save Selection as JPEG Mask.
Your JPEG mask shows up as a pink overlay (which may look gray when
it’s on top of the slice’s green overlay), and the Selective Quality field in
the Optimize panel becomes active.
4. Select JPEG from the drop-down list in the Optimize panel, if it’s not
already selected.
5. Click the Selective Quality button (the pencil and paper) in the
Optimize panel.
The Selective JPEG Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, appears.
6. Make sure that the Enable Selective Quality check box is selected in
the Selective JPEG Settings dialog box (it’s selected by default).
7. Type a number from 0 to 100 in the text field.
Zero represents the lowest quality; 100 represents the highest quality.
Typically, the number you input in the Selective Quality text field is
higher than the number in the main JPEG Quality text field (see the set
of steps that precedes this set).
8. Change the overlay color if you don’t like the default overlay color.
The overlay color doesn’t affect the exported image, only how the PNG
file appears on-screen when you view it in Fireworks.

9. Select the Preserve Text Quality check box if you want to preserve the
quality of any text within your selection, regardless of the overall
compression settings.
You can use this handy shortcut with or without a JPEG mask.
10. Select the Preserve Button Quality check box if you want to preserve
the quality of any buttons within your selection, regardless of the
overall compression settings.
11. Click OK or press Enter.
Making a GIF
Okay, when we say that the GIF compression method is generally lossless,
we mean this: You can make lossless GIFs, but you can also make lossy GIFs
if you need to. GIFs compress image data in a couple of ways:
✦By keeping track of the data more efficiently: GIFs group adjacent
pixels of the same color in each row of the image, so the pixels can be
described as a group rather than as individual pixels. The fewer colors
that you have in each row, and the more pixels of the same color that 
are together in a line, the better GIF compression works.
✦By limiting the number of colors in an image: You can create custom
palettes (sets of colors) or use the specialized built-in palettes that Fire-
works offers. If you compress your image with a palette that doesn’t 
contain all the colors in the image, Fireworks substitutes colors from 
the palette, effectively reducing the number of colors in the GIF, as com-
pared to the source image.
Sometimes you can simulate the appearance of the lost color by dither-
ing two colors from the palette. You can find out more about dithering in
the section on Web-safe colors in Book III, Chapter 2.
Using the default GIF settings
Fireworks offers several default Saved Settings for GIFs (available from the
Saved Settings drop-down list at the top of the Optimize panel):
✦GIF Web 216: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to the basic Web-
safe palette.
✦GIF Web Snap 256: This setting limits the number of colors in your GIF
to 256 while snapping any colors close in appearance to Web-safe colors
to the Web-safe palette.
✦GIF Web Snap 128: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to 128 while
snapping any colors close in appearance to Web-safe colors to the Web-
safe palette.

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
404
✦GIF Adaptive 256: This setting limits the colors in your GIF to the 256
most common in the GIF. Other colors are changed to the closest color
in the palette. This setting gives you the highest-fidelity GIF version of
your image.
✦Animated GIF Web Snap 128: This setting is the same as GIF Web Snap
128 but is for animated GIFs.
Using custom GIF settings
To make a basic GIF that doesn’t use a Fireworks default setting, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select GIF from the Export File Format drop-down list in the Optimize
panel.
The Optimize panel (see Figure 6-6) displays the setting for a top naviga-
tion button. Transparency appears as a checkerboard pattern in the
palette. And because you are creating a custom setting, the Saved
Settings field is blank.
3. Set the compression mode by selecting one from the Indexed Palette
drop-down list (right below the Export File Format drop-down list).
Palettes are sets of colors. For GIFs, the palettes may contain no more
than 256 colors. For Web images, choose from the top four: Adaptive;
Web Adaptive; Web 216; and Exact.
For more information about these palettes, see the Fireworks Help files,
which you can access via the Fireworks Help menu.
Figure 6-6:

Chapter 6
Slicing Up Content

Optimizing Your Images for the Web
405
4. Type a number in the Colors text field or use the drop-down list to set
the number of colors in your palette, if you’re not compressing by
using the Web 216 or Exact settings.
The fewer colors that you have in your palette, the smaller the file size
of your image. If you have fewer colors in the palette than in your image,
however, Fireworks has to substitute colors, which deteriorates image
quality. If your image has more than 256 colors, you may get better
results using a JPEG setting.
5. If you have more colors in your image than in your palette, and if you
prefer dithering to straight one-for-one color substitutions, type a per-
cent in the Dither text field or use the slider (click the button next to
the text field with the downward-pointing arrow to activate the slider)
to set a percentage from 1 to 99.
The more you dither, the fewer colors you need in your palette.
Unfortunately, dithering can look pixelated up close and increases the
file size.
Making a transparent GIF
To make a GIF with transparent areas, which allow the HTML page back-
ground color or background image to show through, follow these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Select GIF from the Export File Format drop-down list in the Optimize
panel, if GIF isn’t already selected.
3. Select Index Transparency from the Transparency drop-down list.
The default is No Transparency. Even when you don’t have a background
in your PNG file, you still need to select Index Transparency to make a
GIF with transparent pixels. Otherwise, your GIF will have a solid white
background.
4. Click the eyedropper button with the equal sign (=) to select a color in
the palette or on the canvas that you want to make transparent.
The three transparency eyedropper buttons are at the bottom left of the
Optimize panel. The selected color becomes transparent in the palette
in the Optimize panel. If you’re viewing a Preview pane, the transparency
appears (or disappears, we should say) on the canvas.
5. Use the eyedropper with the plus sign (+) to select additional colors
that you want to make transparent.
You can use the eyedropper with the minus sign (–) to restore opacity to
a color that you make transparent, if you need to.

Previewing Slices
406
Previewing Slices
You can optimize your slices as you make them, or you can make all your
slices first and then optimize them all at one time. Either way, if you’re
having trouble deciding on the best method or amount of compression to
use on a slice, you can use one of the three Preview panes to help you make
an informed decision. Just click one of the following buttons at the top of the
canvas:
✦Preview: This view shows a single version of your canvas, in which you
can see what your slices will look like and how big their file sizes will be
at your current compression settings. Click a slice to preview it.
✦2-Up: This view puts two versions of your canvas side by side, so you
can compare the original image with a compressed version of the image,
or you can compare two compressed versions to each other. Click a slice
on either side to preview it on both sides.
✦4-Up: This view divides the work area into quadrants, so you can com-
pare three compression settings simultaneously to the original image.
Click a slice in any quadrant to preview the settings in all quadrants.
In the Preview panes, slices that aren’t currently selected look slightly pale,
as though you’re looking at them through a fogged-up window. Selected
slices look as they will when you export them, given their current settings
(including transparencies, which appear as checkerboards), as you can see
in Figure 6-7.

The Preview pane
You can select the Preview pane by clicking the Preview button at the top
left of the image’s window, right above the canvas.
The Preview pane previews more than just the appearance of your image; 
it also shows you the image’s projected file size and the amount of time it
takes for a file that size to download at a particular download speed. (The
default is 56 Kbps, or the approximate speed of a dial-up modem.)
In Figure 6-7, you can see the file size, export file format, and download time
stats at the bottom left, below the canvas. Because a 56 Kbps modem can
download at a rate of 5K per second, and this image is a little over 0.5K, the
download time shows as 0 sec (less than 1 second).
When you change the settings in the Optimize panel, the size and download
time information at the bottom of the Preview pane update automatically.
The Optimize panel works the same way, whether you’re looking at a
Preview pane or the default Original pane.
The 2-Up view
You can select the 2-Up view simply by clicking the 2-Up button at the top
left of the image’s window, above the canvas.
The 2-Up view sets two versions of the canvas side by side. At the bottom of
each pane, you can find an indicator of which view is in the pane and some
of its vital statistics. In Figure 6-8, the pane on the right shows what the
image would look like as a JPEG with the settings as shown at the bottom of
the pane, and the pane on the left shows what the image would look like if
exported as a GIF with the settings as shown at the bottom of the pane.
You can click in either pane to select the slice and then adjust its settings in
the Optimize panel. You can set the magnification of both panes several ways:
✦You can use the Magnifying tool in the View section of the Tools panel.
✦You can choose Zoom In, Zoom Out, or a preset Magnification setting
from the View menu.
✦You can select a zoom setting from the drop-down list at the bottom
right of the window.
To toggle between an optimized setting and the original image, click the
indented button at the left just below the canvas. A pop-up menu allows you
to select Original (No Preview) or Export Preview.

Previewing Slices
408
You can use the Hand tool from the View section of the Tools panel to move
the canvas (select the Hand tool and then click and drag on the canvas) or
just hold down the spacebar while you click and drag (whatever tool you’re
using becomes the Hand tool automatically). When you move the canvas in
one pane, the canvas also moves in the other pane.
To select a different slice than the one currently selected, click the Pointer 
tool from the Tools panel and then click a slice in either pane or in the Layers
panel. The slice becomes active in both panes simultaneously.
The 4-Up view
You can select the 4-Up view by clicking the 4-Up button at the top left above
the canvas. When you first open the 4-Up view, the top-left quadrant displays
the Original view, and the other three panes have identical compression set-
tings. To change the settings in one pane, click in the pane to select it and
then change its settings in the Optimize panel. In fact, you use the concept,
properties, and processes of the 4-Up view just as you use those of the 2-Up
view; you just get two extra panes.
Figure 6-9 shows the 4-Up view. Comparing the three compression settings, it
seems that the one that best balances visual quality with file size is the GIF
pane at the bottom right.

Relating Hotspots and Slices
Slices can only be rectangular, which works fine if you have rectangular but-
tons. But what if you want to create nonrectangular HTML links to other Web
pages? You have two choices:
✦Use the Polygon Slice tool to make a polygonal slice. This choice
works best if the area that you want to use as a hyperlink is fairly iso-
lated from other slices. See Book III, Chapter 5 for details on the Polygon
Slice tool.
✦Use a Hotspot tool to draw hotspots on an image. Fireworks creates the
underlying image, plus an image map. An image map is some HTML code
representing coordinates for hyperlinked polygonal hotspots. Hotspots
are areas on an image that you code to respond to user actions.
Typically, the hotspots are hyperlinked to Web pages. In Figure 6-10, the
bowling ball can be linked to a page about bowling balls, and the pin can be
linked to a page with a list of bowling alleys. Don’t use hotspots more than
you need to so that you don’t add too much code to your HTML or tax the
user’s processor with too many instructions.
If you’re not familiar with Web page coding, don’t worry. You don’t need to
know all the ins and outs of HTML to make an image map — Fireworks takes
care of that for you. You just have to create hotspots in the shapes that you
want and export HTML with your images. See Book III, Chapter 7 for details
on exporting HTML.

Exporting Images
You can export images in two ways: one by one or all at one time. You can
have Fireworks generate HTML at the same time that you export your images,
or you can export the images only and write the code yourself in Dream-
weaver (Book I describes how to use Dreamweaver). (Fireworks generates a
less efficient code than code that you write in Dreamweaver, and you may find
editing the Fireworks code more difficult than in Dreamweaver.)
Exporting a single image
To export a single image, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a slice and select Export Selected Slice from the contextual
menu.
An Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting a
single image.
2. Navigate to the folder into which you want to put your image.
3. Leave the Save as Type setting at the default, Images Only.
4. If you need to, rename the image.
If you want the filename to be the same as the slice name, you don’t
need to rename the image.

7. Click the Save button.
Exporting multiple image slices
To export all the image slices in a PNG file simultaneously, if you plan to
write the HTML yourself, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting
multiple images and HTML, as shown in Figure 6-11.
2. Select Images Only from the Save as Type drop-down list.
The options below the Save as Type drop-down list update to reflect
your selection.
3. Leave the Slices setting at the default, Export Slices.
4. Deselect the Include Areas without Slices check box if you need only
the sliced images to build your HMTL page.

5. If you have rollover images that you want to export, deselect the
Current Frame Only check box if it’s selected.
Remember, it takes multiple frames to make rollover images.
6. Click the Save button.
Exporting an animated GIF
When you save the file as an animated GIF, you also get a Flash SWF option
beyond the default Images Only option in the Save as Type drop-down list.
Although that option does let you make some additional settings, if you want
the ultimate format of the animation to be an SWF file rather than a GIF file,
you probably want to open the PNG file in Flash and export from there. Why?
Because Flash offers more powerful authoring and editing tools, many more
export parameters than Fireworks, and ActionScript for adding complex
interactivity to your animation.
To export an animation as an animated GIF (not a Flash SWF movie), follow
these simple steps:
1. Select Animated GIF in the Optimize panel’s Export File Format drop-
down list.
2. Choose File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears, with default values set for exporting ani-
mated GIFs.
3. Navigate to the folder into which you want the GIF to go.
4. Leave the default Images Only setting in the Save as Type drop-down
list.
5. Click Save.
You can do much more with the Export function than we cover in this sec-
tion. For information on exporting HTML and other export options, see the
section about advanced export functions in Book III, Chapter 7.

ireworks CS3, like all the applications in the Adobe CS3 suite, is deep
and rich. In this chapter, we introduce some of the application’s more
advanced capabilities, such as the following:
✦Adding pizzazz to your design by applying visual styles to objects
(including text blocks). You can create your own styles or use one of
the vast array that comes with Fireworks.
✦Increasing productivity by including reusable symbols in your
designs. Symbols are much more than just pictures; they can contain
multiple frames (animation symbols) and multiple frames plus behav-
iors (button symbols).
✦Exporting HTML code with JavaScript/CSS. JavaScript is a coding lan-
guage that you can use to make elements of your Web page change
based on user feedback, among other things; CSS, which stands for
Cascading Style Sheets, offers a different method of coding pop-up
menus or arranging graphics and text on a Web page. If you add behav-
iors to your Fireworks PNG, you add either JavaScript or CSS to the
HTML that Fireworks generates — you choose which type of code gets
added when you export the HTML.
✦Creating image maps with hotspots.
✦Setting up button behaviors that go beyond simple rollovers. (See
Book III, Chapter 5 for instructions on how to create simple button
rollovers.)
✦Using the Image Swap behavior to make an image on your Web page
change when the user rolls over a separate image.

Adding Styles to Objects
414
Adding Styles to Objects
Styles are your shortcuts to creating eye-catching designs. Typically, they
combine various combinations of strokes, fills, and effects. You can make
your own styles, edit the ones that come with Fireworks to create custom
styles, or just apply the styles straight out of the box. We don’t have space
here to explore all the aspects of styles, but we can give you a big head start
by showing you how to use them.
To apply a style to a bitmap or vector object, follow these steps:
1. Select an object by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
The object highlights on the canvas and in the Layers panel.
2. If it isn’t already open, open the Styles panel by pressing Shift+F11
(PC only) or clicking the Styles tab in the Assets panel.
All the available styles appear in a grid.
3. Click a style in the Styles panel.
The object inherits the attributes of the style, as shown in Figure 7-1.

Using (And Reusing) Symbols
415
You can edit any of the properties of the styled object using the Properties
panel. Just be aware that you will not be editing the underlying style. If you
make edits you like and want to apply them to other objects in your design
(or in future designs), make sure that the styled object is selected and select
New Style from the Assets options menu. A New Style window appears, in
which you can name the style and preserve whichever attributes you wish.
Using (And Reusing) Symbols
Symbols are reusable elements that can be stored centrally in a library and
used as “instances” multiple times in a single document or in many docu-
ments. Any edits you make to a symbol will update all the instances of that
symbol on the canvas. Fireworks has three types of symbols:
✦Graphic: Bitmap or vector objects, which may have filters and effects
applied
✦Animation: Motion graphics with multiple frames
✦Button: Graphics with button behaviors attached
Figure 7-2 shows all three button types in the Library panel. The selected 2-
State Button is previewed at the top of the panel. Click the play button (the
white triangle at the right of the preview window) to preview a button
symbol’s behavior or an animation symbol’s motion.
Fireworks ships with many symbols, including buttons, animations, bullet
and flow diagram graphics, and Flex component graphics. You can create,
edit, and delete symbols, and you can import and export them as well. We
don’t have space to describe all the things you can do with symbols, but we
get you started by showing you how to add an instance of a Fireworks CS3
prepackaged button symbol to your design.
Figure 7-2:

Using (And Reusing) Symbols
416
To gain access to a premade symbol, you must import it into your library. To
import a symbol, follow these steps:
1. If the Library panel isn’t already open, press F11 to open it, or click
the Library tab in the Assets panel.
2. Select Import Symbols from the Assets panel Options menu.
The Open window appears. The Options menu is located at the top right
of the Assets panel.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the button symbols and double-click
the symbol you want to import.
The Import Symbols window appears, with the selected symbol high-
lighted. If you want to see the symbol before you import it, single-click it
and you’ll see it in the Preview section of the Open window.
4. Click Import.
The Import Symbols window disappears, and the symbol appears in the
Library panel.
To add an instance of a button symbol to the canvas, follow these steps:
1. If the Library panel isn’t already open, press F11 (PC only) to open it,
or click the Library tab in the Assets panel.
2. Click a 2-State Button symbol name in the Library panel and drag it to
the canvas. Let go of the mouse button when the symbol is where you
want it on the canvas.
The symbol appears on the canvas (and in the preview pane at the top
of the Library panel).
3. If you want to be able to resize the button, double-click the button
symbol on the canvas to edit it.
The 2-State Button window appears. By default, the button graphic says
“Button” on it. We’re assuming that you want your button to say some-
thing different, such as “Home.” If so, be sure to read “Editing a button
symbol instance,” later in this chapter.
You can edit many of the properties of the symbol, but remember: When
you edit the symbol, you change all associated instances of it on the
canvas.
4. Select the 9-Slice Scaling Guides Enable check box.
Dotted blue lines show where the 9-slice guides will go. See “Scaling with
9-slice,” later in this chapter, for the lowdown on 9-slice scaling.

5. Click Done.
The 2-State Button window closes. The button appears on the canvas,
with slice, frame, and behavior settings automatically configured.
After you have the button symbol instance on the canvas, chances are you’ll
want to change the text on the button. To edit an instance of a symbol on the
canvas, follow these easy steps:
1. Double-click the button symbol on the canvas to edit it.
The 2-State Button window appears. By default, the button graphic says
“Button” on it. We’re assuming that you want your button to say some-
thing different, such as “Home.” If so, be sure to read “Editing a button
symbol instance,” later in this chapter.
2. Double-click the text on the button and type or paste new text.
The text behaves just as it would on the canvas (see Figure 7-3 in the fol-
lowing section).
3. Click anywhere in the 2-State Button window to deselect the text.
A warning dialog box appears, asking whether you want to update the
text in the other button states.
4. To make the Down state of the button say the same thing as the Up
(default) state, click Yes.
The dialog box closes and the button is updated. If, for some reason, you
want the Down state of the button to say something different than the Up
state, click No, click the Down tab, and edit the text as you did in Step 2.
5. If you want to resize the button, select the 9-Slice Scaling Guides
Enable check box.
Dotted blue lines show where the 9-slice guides will go. See “Scaling with
9-slice,” later in this chapter, for the lowdown on 9-slice scaling.
6. Click Done.
The 2-State Button window closes.
Editing a button symbol instance
You can edit a button symbol, and you may want to do it so that you can cus-
tomize the button’s look wherever it appears. But when you want to make
several buttons from the same symbol, each of which has its own text, you
need to edit each instance of the button on the canvas. The look of the
button will remain consistent with the symbol, and each instance of the

Using (And Reusing) Symbols
418
button will remain attached to the symbol (so that if you edit the symbol
itself, all the instances will update). To edit a button symbol instance on the
canvas, follow these steps:
1. Click the button symbol instance on the canvas.
All the points, and the guidelines connecting them, appear in light blue,
and the instance is highlighted in the Layers panel. The button
instance’s properties appear in the Properties panel. You may have to
make the Web layer inactive in order to select the instance (to do so,
click the eye icon at the left of the Web Layer in the Layers panel).
2. Name the slice by entering text in the top-left text field in the
Properties panel.
The text you enter will be used to name the exported image.
3. Change the text on the button by entering what you want the button
to say in the Text text field of the Properties panel and press Enter.
The button updates on the canvas.
4. If you plan to export HTML from Fireworks, enter a URL in the Link
text field and Alt text in the Alt text field.
Figure 7-3 shows how the Properties panel might look if you were plan-
ning to export HTML along with images.

Scaling with 9-slice
If you want to resize an object that has a style applied to it, or just has a gradi-
ent or filter effect such as inner glow or emboss, Fireworks CS3 offers you the
option to scale the object using the new 9-slice method. The 9-slice feature
allows you to scale the object up or down without distorting its geometry. For
example, if your button has a gradient and you want to stretch the button but
maintain the integrity of the gradient, you’ll want to scale with 9-slice.
To scale a button using the 9-slice feature, follow these simple steps:
1. Double-click the symbol in the library.
The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears. If you don’t have the Library
panel open, press Shift+F11 to open it (PC only).
2. If the Enable 9-Slice Scaling Guides check box is not selected, click the
check box to select it.
It is not selected by default, unless you selected it when you originally
imported the symbol.
3. Click the Edit button.
The Button Editor window appears, showing the button with the 9-slice
guides, as shown in Figure 7-4.
4. Align the 9-slice guides to protect the areas of the button you don’t
want scaled.
The slice in the center, with the plus (+) sign in it, is the part that will get
scaled.

5. Click Done.
The Button Editor window disappears, and the first instance of the
button on the canvas has the blue points and guidelines on it, along with
a blue plus (+) sign in the middle.
6. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Scale.
The points and guidelines turn black. You can also choose Free
Transform (or press Ctrl+T).
7. Click on a point and drag away from the center of the button object.
Release the mouse button when the button has reached the size you
want.
The button is scaled, but its edges have not been distorted, as shown in
Figure 7-5. Hold down the Alt key (PC) or Option key (Mac) while drag-
ging to resize equally from the center of the button.
Using Advanced Export Options
In Book III, Chapter 6, we describe how to export images, but not how to
export HTML or other types of files. If you’re designing a Web page and you
have behaviors or hotspots in your Fireworks PNG file, you want to export
HTML along with your images because the HTML and JavaScript or CSS code
make hotspots and behaviors work in Web pages.

When you want to export any type of file from Fireworks, you first have to
choose File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R to bring up the Export dialog box,
which you can see in Figure 7-6. The Save as Type drop-down list in the
Export dialog box offers access to an array of extra options:
✦HTML and Images: Exports HTML (or other Web language) code, as well
as images.
✦Images Only: Exports images at your chosen optimization settings.
✦Dreamweaver Library (.lbi): Exports Library items, as well as images.
(Library items are snippets of HTML code that you can use in
Dreamweaver to make site maintenance easier.)
✦CSS Layers (.htm): Allows you to export layers, frames, or slices as
Cascading Style Sheet layers, so Fireworks generates both images and
CSS-based HTML code, placing each layer, frame, or slice in its own CSS
layer (or div). (For information about working with CSS in Dreamweaver,
see Book I, Chapter 5.)
✦Director (.htm): Exports either layers or frames as images that you can
import into Director for use in Shockwave movies. (Director is not part
of the CS3 suite, so we don’t cover it in this book.)
✦Layers to Files: Exports each layer in the current frame as a separate
image file, which you may find useful if you’re planning to use the layers
to build an animation in another application.
Figure 7-6:

✦Frames to Files: Exports each frame as a separate image file, which you
may find useful if you’re planning to use the frames to build an anima-
tion in another application.
✦Lotus Domino Designer: Exports either the top four layers, the top four
frames, or the first four frames of each slice as separate files. Domino is
an IBM Web-based collaboration tool.
✦MXML and Images: Exports code and images for building Rich Internet
Applications using Adobe Flex.
Using the Save As command offers you additional formats not available
through the Export command, including the following:
✦Flash SWF: Exports an SWF file, which you can view via the Flash browser
plug-in and import into Flash. Flash is a much more flexible authoring tool
for SWFs. See Book III for a wealth of information about Flash.
✦Illustrator 8: Exports either the current frame, leaving layers intact, or
exports a document in which frames are converted to layers. Book IV
covers Illustrator.
✦Photoshop PSD: Exports the PNG as a layered Photoshop document
(PSD). You can choose to maintain editability over text layers and
effects, which may result in variations in appearance between the two
files, or to maintain the appearance by giving up editability over text and
effects. Remember, your PNG’s Web Layer doesn’t get exported. See
Book II for much more about Photoshop.
Although you may want to export any of these types of files, we focus on the
HTML and Images option in the following sections. You will probably use this
option the most.
Readying your PNG for HTML export
If you’re using Fireworks to generate your HTML code, you probably have
buttons in your design that you want linked to other pages on your site. Or
perhaps you have one or more hotspots in your PNG and you want those
hotspots to link to other pages on your Web site. Naturally, Fireworks makes
it easy for you to add URLs to create the hyperlinks for buttons and
hotspots. You just need to plan ahead: Prepare HTML document names
(about-us.htm or contact.htm, for example) for all the pages to which
you want to link from your current page.
To add a URL to an existing slice or hotspot in the document’s Web layer
(see Book III, Chapter 6 for information on creating slices), just follow these
steps:

Book III
Chapter 7
Advanced
Fireworks CS3 Tools
Using Advanced Export Options
423
1. Select the slice or hotspot by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers
panel (if you need to, open the Layers panel by pressing F2; you also
can expand the panel by clicking the panel name).
The Property inspector is updated to show information about the
selected slice or hotspot.
2. Click in the Link text field in the Property inspector.
If you have added links to other slices or other hotspots, those links
appear as drop-down list choices in the Link text field.
3. Type a URL.
If you’re linking to a page on your own site and you have all your HTML
pages in the same folder, simply type the name of the HTML document
(for example, index.htm or help.htm). You have to type the name of the
document exactly as it appears. (If you type index.htm but your home
page is actually index.html, the link doesn’t work.)
If you’re linking to a page not on your site, include the complete URL (such
as http://catalog.dummies.com/booksanddownloads.asp).
4. Press Enter or click anywhere on the canvas.
Exporting HTML with your images
If you want, you can tell Fireworks to generate the HTML along with the opti-
mized images for your Web page and make that the end of it. If you plan to
make any changes to the HTML in Dreamweaver or another HTML editor,
however, you can set some options to control the way Fireworks sets up
tables in the HTML it generates, which can make your Web page mainte-
nance a little easier down the line.
To export HTML and images that you plan not to update, or that you plan to
update in Fireworks rather than Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Set up a folder structure for your Web site on your hard drive.
You need a master folder that holds every file for your site. Inside the
master folder, you may want to put an images folder, which can hold all
your images, keeping them separate from the HTML documents. You can
have your HTML documents and image files all mixed together in the
master folder, but if you have many images, you can find and work with all
the files much more easily if you create a separate folder for the images.
2. Check to make sure that all the right layers are visible (or not visible)
in your PNG file.
Remember, the exported image files include only visible layers and
objects. If you don’t see it on-screen now, it won’t be exported. See 
Book III, Chapter 5 for details on making layers visible/invisible.

Using Advanced Export Options
424
3. In Fireworks, choose File➪Export or press Ctrl+Shift+R.
The Export dialog box appears.
4. Navigate to the Web site’s master folder.
If you haven’t created a master folder for your Web site, you can create a
folder by clicking the standard Windows Create New Folder icon to the
right of the Save In drop-down list.
5. Type a name for your page in the File Name text field if the default
isn’t what you want to name your HTML page.
The default HTML file extension in the Adobe CS3 suite is .htm, but you
can also use .html.
6. Select HTML and Images from the Save as Type drop-down list.
The options below this drop-down list update to reflect your choice.
7. Select Export HTML File from the HTML drop-down list.
If you select Copy to Clipboard rather than Export HTML File, Fireworks
exports the code to a temporary location (your computer’s Clipboard),
from which you can paste the code into an existing document. If you
select Copy to Clipboard, you can simply open any type of text docu-
ment and press Ctrl+V to paste the HTML into the file.
Export HTML File has myriad options available. See the following sec-
tion, “Setting the export HTML file options,” for more information.
8. Select Export Slices from the Slices drop-down list.
If you haven’t made slices in your PNG file but you have placed guides in
the file, you can select the Slice Along Guides option, and Fireworks cuts
up your design based on the guides.
9. Leave the Current Frame Only check box deselected unless you have
multiple frames in your document, at least one of which you do not
want to export.
10. Leave the Include Areas without Slices option selected unless you
have a plan to deal with areas you didn’t slice.
If you’re using a background image, for example, or you want to use
transparent spacer GIFs, you may not need images from the nonsliced
areas — if you have any.
11. Select the Put Images in Subfolder check box if you want to export
your images to a folder inside your site’s master folder.
You need to decide when you export where you want your images to
live, because your HTML document will include links to the images. You
express the links as pathnames to the images relative to the location of
the HTML document.

12. Click the Save button.
The HTML file is saved to your site’s master folder, and the images are
saved either to that same folder or to a folder within that folder, as you
specify in Step 11.
Setting the export HTML file options
When you click the Options button in the Export dialog box, the HTML Setup
dialog box opens, as you can see in Figure 7-7. In the HTML Setup dialog box,
you can view and modify the default settings that determine the structure of
the exported HTML document.
You can access settings on the three tabs in the HTML Setup dialog box:
✦General: Lets you change the default HTML style (different HTML edi-
tors have different styles of writing and displaying the code) and file
extension. With Fireworks CS3, the new default is Dreamweaver XHTML
(eXtensible HyperText Markup Language, the latest version of HTML).
You can also choose whether you want Fireworks to put comments in
the HTML document. (Comments are notes in the HTML source code
that typically contain information about the structure of the code, such
as “<!— --Left navigation starts here —>.” The browser doesn’t display
comments. If you want to be able to launch and edit entire tables from
Dreamweaver, be sure that you select the Include HTML Comments
check box.) Select the Lowercase File Name check box if you want to
make the names of the HTML file and all exported images all lowercase,
even if you name images with uppercase and lowercase letters in your
PNG. Select the Use CSS For Popup Menus check box if you want the

pop-up menus in your file to be exported as CSS code rather than
JavaScript. If you select this check box, an additional option becomes
available. Select the Write CSS to an External File check box if you want
to keep the CSS code in a separate file from the HTML.
✦Table: Lets you customize the way Fireworks sets up tables. In the default,
Fireworks puts a 1-pixel-high spacer row at the top and a 1-pixel-wide
spacer column on the right to hold the design in place. You can choose to
have Fireworks nest tables (put one table inside another) instead. You can
also tell Fireworks to re-create parts of your design that lack objects as
cells with background-transparent spacer GIFs in the HTML, to leave the
cell empty, or to put in a nonbreaking space. A spacer GIF is a one-pixel-
by-one-pixel transparent image that you can set to any height and width 
in your HTML to hold open an otherwise empty table cell.
✦Document Specific: Lets you customize image naming based on table
structure, image function, or both. For example, for slices with multiple
frames, Fireworks appends _f2, _f3, and so on, to the filename. If the
images from Frame 2 of your PNG are buttons in their rollover state, you
may want to have Fireworks append -o or -over to the filename. If you
want all images to have identical Alt tags, enter the desired word or
phrase in the Default ALT Tag text field (see Book I, Chapter 2 for details
on Alt tags). If your PNG file contains a nav bar image (see the “Creating
advanced button rollovers” section, later in this chapter), you can select
the Export Multiple Nav Bar HTML Files check box if you want Fireworks
to generate separate HTML files for each button in the navigation bar.
The Include Areas without Slice Objects check box is selected by default;
leave it selected to get the most consistent results. Select the UTF-8
Encoding check box if you want to use multiple character sets (Hebrew
and English, for example) in your HTML.
The Set Defaults button on the Document Specific tab lets you save any new
settings you make, which you may find particularly useful if you like to use a
specific naming convention for button rollovers and on states. When you
adjust the Document Specific settings to your liking and click the Set Defaults
button, your adjusted settings become the new default Document Specific 
settings.
Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers
Fireworks writes image maps and JavaScript into the HTML code you export,
provided that you have hotspots (which Fireworks uses to make image
maps) or behaviors (which Fireworks uses to make JavaScript) in your PNG.
The following sections outline how to set up image maps (which let you

Book III
Chapter 7
Advanced
Fireworks CS3 Tools
Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers
427
make several distinct hyperlinks from a single image) and complex button
behaviors (which make the button image change based on a user action,
such as rolling the mouse over the image or clicking the image).
Fireworks can show slices and hotspots overlapping, but you don’t want to
overlap them. Fireworks doesn’t export any part of a slice that’s under
another slice. (The slice on top includes the overlapped area; the slice
underneath is cut off.) Likewise, whichever hotspot is on top in the Layers
panel overrides the hotspot underneath.
Creating image maps with hotspots
The three hotspot tools let you create hotspots shaped like rectangles, circles,
or polygons. You can also use the Polygon Slice tool to create a hotspot,
although as a rule, you should use the hotspot tools unless you’re making a
single, isolated hotspot. (For more information on the Polygon Slice tool, see
Book III, Chapter 6.)
To create a circular or rectangular hotspot using a hotspot tool, just follow
these steps:
1. Select a hotspot tool from the Web section of the Tools panel.
Click and hold on the Rectangle Hotspot tool to access the pop-up menu
containing the Circle Hotspot tool, if you need to.
2. Click and drag over the area you want to make a hotspot.
3. Type a URL in the Link text field in the Property inspector and press
Enter.
The URL should be an HTML document name (about-us.htm, for
example) or pathname (/aboutus/staff.htm, for example) for the
page you want the hotspot to link to. You can add URLs as you make the
hotspots, or you can create all your hotspots and then select each one
and add a URL in the Property inspector.
4. Make as many more hotspots as you need by repeating Steps 1
through 3.
When you create hotspots using the Polygon Slice tool, you’re actually
making rectangular images with linked areas inside. As a result, Fireworks
makes a separate image map for each slice. That approach works fine if
you’re making only one polygonal slice, but if you’re making several adjacent
hotspots, you may want to use the Polygon Hotspot tool or make your image
map in Dreamweaver. (See Book III, Chapter 6 for information about how to
use the Polygon Slice tool, and Book I, Chapter 6 for information on creating
hotspots using Dreamweaver.)

Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers

You only have to do a little more to make a polygonal hotspot rather than a
rectangular or circular hotspot. To make a polygonal hotspot, just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Polygon Hotspot tool from the Web section of the Tools
panel.
Click and hold on the Rectangle Hotspot tool to access the pop-up menu
containing the Polygon Hotspot tool.
2. Click the canvas to establish the first point of your polygon.
3. Click a second point.
Fireworks draws a line connecting the points.
4. Continue to click until you have drawn the shape that you want.
You don’t need to click again on the first point to close the shape. You
may want to avoid making hotspots that have more than six or seven
points, because the more points that you make, the more code you need
to reproduce your hotspot as an image map. The polygonal hotspot for
the bowling pin in Figure 7-8 sacrifices perfect coverage of the pin to
make a simpler shape, which means less code.

5. Type a URL in the Link text field in the Property inspector and press
Enter.
The URL should be an HTML document name (aboutus.htm, for exam-
ple) or pathname (/aboutus/staff.htm, for example) for the page
you want the hotspot to link to. You can add URLs as you make the
hotspots, or you can create all of your hotspots and then select each
one and add a URL in the Property inspector.
6. Click the Polygon Hotspot tool and then deselect the last hotspot that
you made by pressing Ctrl+D or choosing Select➪Deselect.
Deselecting ensures that you don’t inadvertently add an extra point to
your Polygon hotspot.
When it comes time to export your images, you need to export HTML as well
as images in order to get the image map that Fireworks makes from your
hotspots. See the “Exporting HTML with your images” section, earlier in this
chapter, for more details.
Dreamweaver has its own tool for creating hotspots and image maps. You can
also use that tool to edit hotspots and image maps generated by Fireworks.
See Book I, Chapter 6 for more details.
Creating advanced button rollovers
In Book III, Chapter 5, we discuss how to use frames in conjunction with text
and drawing tools to make the images (one per frame for each button) for a
simple button rollover. If you plan to use Dreamweaver to generate the
rollover code, that chapter provides all the information you need.
If you want to export the rollover code for a 2-State Button (normal and
rollover/highlight) from Fireworks, you need to add a behavior to the slice
by taking these steps:
1. Right-click the slice for which you want to create rollover code, or
select the slice and click the behavior handle (the round icon) in the
center of the selected slice.
A contextual menu appears.
2. Choose Add Simple Rollover.
You can also add rollover behavior to a button by using the Behavior panel,
as follows:
1. If the Behavior panel is not currently open, choose Window➪Behaviors
or press Shift+F3.

Setting Up Image Maps and Button Rollovers
430
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors panel.
A menu appears.
3. Choose Simple Rollover from the menu.
You have set up a behavior that swaps the image in Frame 1 with the image
in Frame 2 when a user rolls a cursor over the button on your Web page. The
behavior also swaps the image back when the user moves the cursor off the
button.
If you want to check out your rollover in action without building your Web
page, click the Preview button at the top of the canvas and move your
cursor over the slice.
Your button can have up to four states. Fireworks uses the image in Frame 1
for the normal, default state; Frame 2 for the Rollover state; Frame 3 for the
Down state; and Frame 4 for the Over While Down state. If you want to
include a Down state for your button, and you have a third frame in your
PNG with the image for an additional button state, follow the preceding
steps to add a Rollover state and then do the following:
1. Click the Add Behavior button at the top left of the Behaviors panel.
A menu appears.
2. Choose Set Nav Bar Image from the menu.
The Set Nav Bar Image dialog box appears.
3. Click OK.
Now, when a user clicks the button in your exported HTML, the button
changes from the rollover state to the down state.
Figure 7-9 shows what the Behaviors panel looks like after you add the
Simple Rollover and Set Nav Bar Image behaviors. You can use the add
behavior (+) button to add a behavior and use the remove behavior (–)
button to remove a behavior from a slice.

If the 3-State Button is linking to another page, adding a Down state doesn’t
give you much bang for your buck because the linked page may appear in
the browser window before the user even has a chance to notice that the
button changed.
You may want to include an Over While Down state for your button (sort of
an extra rollover) if you’re using the Down state of the button to indicate the
current page. If so, check in the Frames panel to make sure that you have a
fourth frame with the image for an extra button state, add the Rollover and
Set Nav Bar Image behaviors by using the steps earlier in this section, and
then perform the following steps:
1. Double-click the Set Nav Bar Image line in the Behaviors panel.
The Set Nav Bar Image dialog box appears.
2. Select the Include Over While Down State (Frame 4) check box.
If the button is for the current page, select the Show Down Image upon
Load check box, as well.
3. Click OK.
Select the Export Multiple Nav Bar HTML Files check box on the
Document Specific tab of the HTML Setup dialog box if you want Fire-
works to generate separate HTML files for each button in the nav bar
(see the “Setting the export HTML file options” section, earlier in this
chapter, for more information).
Bringing Interactivity to Your Pages with Behaviors
Fireworks can generate JavaScript that does more than merely change the
state of a button. For instance, you can set a behavior that swaps one image
for another image elsewhere on the page when you roll over a button or
hotspot. You can also use Fireworks to generate pop-up menus, which you
can export as either JavaScript or CSS code.
The Swap Images behavior
A button rollover is an image swap — you exchange the image for one button
state with the image for another state. But you can roll over a button and
have a different image on the page swap. For example, you can set up a
rollover behavior for two or more buttons to show different color choices
for a product, so when the user rolls over a button for color choices, the
image of the product changes to show the appropriately colored version. If
you want the image swap and page download to happen quickly, limit the
number of images that you want to swap and limit the file size of each
swapped image.

Bringing Interactivity to Your Pages with Behaviors
432
To add the Swap Image behavior to a trigger slice and target slice, create the
frames, images, and slices. (See Book III, Chapter 3 to learn how to create
images, Book III, Chapter 5 for information on frames, and Book III, Chapter 6
for information on slices.) Then, follow these steps:
1. Click the slice that you want to use to trigger the image swap.
You can click the slice either on the canvas or in the Layers panel.
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors
panel (if the Behaviors panel isn’t visible, press Shift+F3).
A menu appears.
3. Choose Swap Image.
The Swap Image dialog box, which you can see in Figure 7-10, appears.
4. Select the targeted slice by clicking its name (in the box on the left) or
by clicking its representation (in the box on the right).
When you click in either box, both boxes update to show your selection.
5. Using the Frame No. drop-down list, select the frame number that you
want the rollover to trigger.
The drop-down list shows all the frames in your PNG file.
You can also select the Image File radio button and navigate to an exist-
ing image file outside your PNG to swap in. But for the rollover to work
correctly in all browsers, the default target image and swapped target
image have to be the same height and width.

6. Leave the Preload Images and the Restore Image onMouseOut check
boxes selected.
Preloading the swapped image ensures the user doesn’t experience a
delay when he or she rolls over the button that triggers the swap. You
make a trade-off with preloading because the Web page takes longer to
load initially.
Restoring the image to default prevents the swapped image from “stick-
ing.” If you want the swapped image to remain in place until the user
rolls over another button, deselect the Restore Image onMouseOut
check box.
7. Click OK.
A line on the canvas from the center of the trigger slice to the target
slice shows that one slice triggers a behavior in the other, as you can see
in Figure 7-11.
You can have multiple buttons trigger a rollover in the same slice, and you
can have a single button trigger rollovers in multiple slices. Of course, the
more big rollovers you have on the page, the longer the page takes to load.
On the other hand, rollovers give useful feedback (and instant gratification)
to the user, and Fireworks makes producing them a snap.
Generating pop-up menus
You can cram a lot of navigation into a small space by using a pop-up menu
because pop-up menus appear only when a user rolls over a button or
hotspot. Fireworks lets you specify many of the parameters of a menu’s
Figure 7-11:

appearance. To start with, you can choose whether the links in your pop-up
menu are made of text or images. In a nutshell, that choice boils down to this:
✦Linked images: This option makes for a slower download but gives you
more control over the appearance of the text because the text is graphic.
✦Linked text: This option ensures faster download but gives you less con-
trol over the appearance of the text because the text is HTML.
You can also customize the position of the menu relative to the slice that
triggers it, the color of the text and cell background for both normal and
rollover states, and more. In fact, you have so many options, we can’t cover
them all here! After you have the basics, though, you can explore all the
options by using the Fireworks Help files (select the Help menu at the top
right of the Fireworks menu bar) or just by experimenting.
To make a basic, one-level pop-up menu with linked text, follow these steps:
1. Select a slice by clicking it on the canvas or in the Layers panel (if you
need to, open the Layers panel by pressing F2; you also can expand
the panel by clicking the panel name).
2. Click the Add Behavior (+) button at the top left of the Behaviors
panel (if the Behaviors panel isn’t visible, press Shift+F3).
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Set Pop-up Menu from the Add Behaviors pop-up menu.
The Pop-up Menu Editor, which you can see in Figure 7-12, appears, with
the Content tab active by default.

4. Click under the Text column of the Pop-up Menu Editor and type the
text as you want it to appear in your menu.
5. Press Tab or click under the Link column of the Pop-up Menu Editor
and type or select the URL or filename for the page you want your text
linked to.
If you have any existing links already on your page, they appear in a
drop-down list in the Link column.
6. If you want the link to open in a new window or different frameset,
tab over to or click in the Target column to set the target for the link.
If you simply want the linked page to open in the user’s current browser
window, leave this column blank (refer to Figure 7-12). For information
on other Target options, see the discussion of links in Book I, Chapter 2,
or the discussion of frames in Book I, Chapter 4.
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for each item in your menu.
You can add rows to the list of menu items by clicking the Add Menu
button (the plus sign at the top left) or by pressing the Tab key until a
text field appears in the Text column.
8. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Appearance tab becomes active.
9. For the Cells option, make sure that the HTML radio button (the
default selection) is selected.
If you want to use images rather than HTML text, you need to select the
Image radio button. Each navigation item is in its own table cell.
10. Select Vertical Menu or Horizontal Menu from the drop-down list.
If you select Vertical Menu, menu items will be stacked vertically in a
single column. If you select Horizontal Menu, menu items will appear in
a horizontal row.
11. Select the font face, size, style, and alignment.
Of course, you don’t need to do this step if you’re using graphics rather
than HTML text.
12. Select the text color and cell background color for the Up (normal)
state by clicking the Text and Cell color swatches and clicking when
the eyedropper is on the color you want in the color picker that 
pops up.
If you don’t want to use the defaults, click the color boxes to open the
color picker. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can see a preview of
your menu, as shown in Figure 7-13.

13. Select the text color and cell background color for the Over (rollover)
state by clicking the Text and Cell color swatches and clicking when the
eyedropper is on the color you want in the color picker that pops up.
If you don’t want to use the defaults, click the color boxes to open the
color picker. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can see a preview of
your menu.
14. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Advanced tab becomes active.
15. Adjust any of the parameters in the Advanced tab as needed.
You can preview all the following settings at the bottom of the dialog
box, except Menu Delay:
• Cell Width and Cell Height: By default, Fireworks sets the cell width
and cell height automatically, based on the content, but you can select
Pixels from the drop-down list and type in a custom width and/or
height.
• Cell Padding and Cell Spacing: Cell padding is the space between
the edges of the cells and the text within the cells. The default Cell
Padding setting is 3 pixels. Cell spacing is the space between the edge
of one cell and the edge of an adjacent cell. The default Cell Spacing
setting is 0.
• Text Indent: Text indent is the number of pixels from the left (in a
vertical menu) or from the top (in a horizontal menu) to the text, not

including the gaps introduced by cell padding and cell spacing. The
default Text Indent setting is 0.
• Menu Delay: Menu delay is the amount of time your menu stays on-
screen after the user’s mouse rolls off the menu. You adjust it in mil-
liseconds (ms), or thousandths of a second. The default, 1000 ms,
equals one second.
• Pop-up Borders: You can turn on or off the border of your pop-up
menu (and you can adjust its width if you have the border on), and
you can customize the colors that make up the border.
16. Click the Next button at the bottom of the Pop-up Menu Editor.
The Position tab becomes active.
17. Click a Menu Position icon.
The X and Y coordinates, which represent the top-left corner of the
menu relative to the slice, update. You can type your own values for the
X and Y coordinates if you want to customize them.
18. Click Done.
The Preview pane that you access at the top of your canvas doesn’t let you
see the pop-up menu in action. To preview your pop-up menu in action, you
have to choose File➪Preview in Browser or press F12 (PC only). You can use
any Web browser installed on your computer to preview your menu, as long
as you have JavaScript enabled on that browser.
Pop-up menus are a tricky business because their appearance can vary in
different browsers. Be sure to test all your target browsers to make sure that
they display the menus in a way you find acceptable.
When you make a slice active that has a pop-up menu behavior attached,
you see an outline on the canvas in Fireworks in which the pop-up menu will
appear when the user rolls over the slice.
To edit the pop-up menu, click the behavior handle (the round icon in the
middle of the slice, visible when you select the slice) and choose Edit Pop-up
Menu, or double-click the behavior’s name in the Behaviors panel.
Creating a Slideshow for the Web
You can now create a Flash-based Web slideshow without leaving Fireworks.
You can choose settings for image size, length of time each image appears
on-screen, transition type, and more. There are so many customization
options, we don’t have space for all the details here. Instead, we offer the
quickest route to a working Web slideshow.

4. Navigate to the folder that contains the images you want to use in
your slideshow and click to select the images. When you have
selected all the images you want to add, click Done.
Hold down the Shift key while you click to select multiple files. When
you click Done, the window disappears.
5. Click OK in the Files to Process window.
The album title and the folder name appear in the Albums section of the
Create Slideshow window. By default, the album title matches the name
of the folder containing the images.
6. Click the title or folder name of the album you just created.
The title and folder name of the album are highlighted in green, and the
images appear in the images section.
7. Click Slideshow Properties.
The Slideshow Properties panel slides open, as shown in Figure 7-14.
8. Type a number or use the arrows to set an Interval for the slideshow.
The number you enter sets the number of seconds each slide appears
on-screen.
9. Select a transition effect from the Type pop-up menu by clicking the
arrow at the right and clicking an effect. Next, enter a number for the
amount of seconds you want each transition to take.
If you want the slides to appear one after the other without any transi-
tional effect, deselect the Use Transition check box.
10. If you don’t want your slideshow to start with the first image as listed
in the Images section of the window, enter the number of the image
you’d like to appear first in the First Image field.

Yes, Adobe has done it again — an even better Adobe Illustrator, and
you can discover the best new features in this chapter. This chapter
breezes through the new features to open your eyes to exciting new work
methods. Don’t forget to look for references to where you can get more in-
depth knowledge in other locations of this book.
Integrated Interface
As you may guess, Adobe Illustrator follows the other products in the suite
with its similar interface, which makes it easy for you to set up efficient
workspaces and keep just the tools you need handy.
The user experience is noticeably different right away. As you launch Adobe
Illustrator CS3, a splash screen appears, asking whether you’re opening an
existing document or if you’re creating a new print, Web, mobile device,
video, CMYK, RGB, or template file. By selecting the appropriate selection,
you’ll have the correct tools and preferences set up from the beginning.
Just like many of the other CS3 applications, you now have a space-saving
one-column toolbar that you can switch back to two by clicking on the gray
bar at the top of the toolbar and a palette system that you can collapse to
icons (see Figure 1-1).

Live Color
444
Live Color
Gain your color confidence! Live Color allows for complete color exploration
in addition to timesaving features to apply color schemes to your Illustrator
objects. If you’ve ever been frustrated by having to color objects individu-
ally, you’re sure to appreciate the new, interactive way to create and apply
color schemes.
Live Color includes the Color Guide panel (see Figure 1-2), which includes
features that allow you to save color groups without affecting your 
artwork.
Use the Color Guide to find compelling colors and save them to color groups
in your Swatches panel. You can create color schemes based on 23 classic
color-harmony rules, such as Complementary, Analogous, Monochromatic,
and Triad, or you can create custom harmony rules. Even if you’ve gone
through art school, using Live Colors beats trying to figure out a color
scheme on your own. (Read more about Live Color in Chapter 9 of this 
minibook.)

Flash Integration
445
Flash Integration
Flash is vector, and Illustrator is vector, which means illustrations created in
these applications are composed of mathematically created line and curve
segments. Why can’t they be better friends? Well, in this version, they’re
great buddies. Not only do you have the ability to do simple tasks like cut
and paste from Adobe Illustrator directly into Flash files, but you also can
transfer Illustrator layers and grouping structures along with all object
names. (Read more about Flash integration with the CS3 products in Book V
on Flash.)
Figure 1-2:
The new
Color Guide
allows you
to create
color groups
that you 
can then
store in the
Swatches
panel.
Vector graphics
Vector graphics are made up of lines and
curves defined by mathematical objects called
vectors. Because the paths (the lines and
curves) are defined mathematically, you can
move, resize, or change the color of vector
objects without losing quality in the graphic.
Vector graphics are resolution-independent;
that is, they can be scaled to any size and
printed at any resolution without losing detail.
On the other hand, bitmap graphics have a pre-
determined amount of pixels creating them, so
you can’t scale (resize) them easily — if you
scale them smaller, you throw out pixels; if you
scale them bigger, you end up with a blocky,
jagged picture.
(continued)

Improved Drawing Controls
446
Improved Drawing Controls
Illustrator drawing tools have long been the industry standard for power and
versatility, but they’ve also always been a little unnatural and tedious to those
who are new to using vector drawing tools. Now, in Adobe CS3, the drawing
tools have been improved to allow you to work faster and get better results,
starting with Point selection: Simply move your cursor over an anchor point
(with the direct selection tool), and it’s enlarged to help you see it better.
The control panel has gained additional tools to help you change curved cor-
ners to rounded curves, or back again. You can also connect and remove
anchor points quickly with the improved path controls shown in Figure 1-3.
Read more about improved performance and how to use the drawing tools
in Chapter 5 of this minibook.
Figure 1-3:
New tools in
the control
panel help
edit paths.
The following figure shows the differences
between an enlarged vector graphic on the left
(notice the smooth edges) and an enlarged
bitmap graphic on the right (note the jagged
edges). Many companies have their logos 
created as vectors to avoid problems with scal-
ing: A vector graphic logo maintains its high-
quality appearance at any size.

Isolation Mode
447
Erase It Away
If you’re an experienced Illustrator user, you’ll really appreciate the new
Eraser tool. It lets you erase as easily as you create, even reconnecting paths
as you erase over shapes and paths. You can make the eraser larger or
smaller by double-clicking the Eraser tool and changing the options in the
Eraser Tool Options window, shown in Figure 1-4.
Isolation Mode
Those of you who build a little more than text art and the occasional logo
will appreciate the new Isolation mode that allows you to take selected
objects into a mode that protects other artwork. Isolation mode is truly
essential if you work on complex artwork and spend a lot of time grouping,
hiding, locking, and restacking layers to access objects for editing.
To use this new mode, just use the Selection tool to double-click any
grouped set of objects. The rest of your artwork becomes inaccessible, as
shown in Figure 1-5. This feature is truly a timesaver!

A
dobe Illustrator goes hand in hand with the other Adobe products but
serves its own unique purpose. Adobe Illustrator creates single-page
artwork, not lengthy documents with repeated headers, footers, and page
numbers, such as documents created in InDesign, and not artwork created
out of pixels, such as images edited or created in Photoshop. Illustrator is
generally used to create logos, illustrations, maps, packages, labels, signage,
Web art, and more.
Deciding When to Use Illustrator CS3
So how do you draw the line and decide when to create graphics in
Illustrator rather than Photoshop? By using Illustrator, you gain the follow-
ing benefits:
✦Illustrator can save and export graphics into most file formats. By choos-
ing to save or export, you can create a file that can be used in most other
applications. For instance, Illustrator files can be saved as .svg, .bmp,
.tiff, .pdf, .jpg, and even as a Flash .swf file, to name a few.
✦Illustrator files are easily integrated into other Adobe applications. You
can save Illustrator files in their native format and open or place them in
other Adobe applications, such as InDesign, Photoshop, Dreamweaver,
and Flash. You can also save Adobe Illustrator artwork in the .pdf format

Opening an Existing Document
450
(Acrobat Portable Document Format). This format allows anyone using
the free Acrobat Reader software to open and view the file, but editing
capabilities are still maintained when the file is later opened in Illustrator.
✦Illustrator is resolution-independent. Resolution of Illustrator vector art-
work isn’t determined until output. In other words, if you print to a 600-
dpi (dots per inch) printer, the artwork is printed at 600 dpi; print to a
2,400-dpi printer, and the artwork will print at 2,400 dpi. Illustrator 
graphics are very different from the bitmap images you create or edit in
Photoshop, where resolution is determined upon creation of the artwork.
✦Illustrator has limitless scalability, which means that you can create
vector artwork in Illustrator and scale it to the size of your thumb or the
size of a barn, and it will still look good. See the “Vector graphics” side-
bar in Chapter 1 of this minibook for more information.
Opening an Existing Document
To familiarize yourself with the basics of Illustrator and what the work area
looks like, jump right in by opening an existing document in Illustrator. If you
don’t have an Illustrator file already created, you can open one of the sample
files that is packaged with the Illustrator application. For example, you can
open the file named Cheshire Cat.ai in the Sample Art folder. The path
to the file is C:\Programs\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CS3\Cool Extras\Sample
Files\Sample Art (Applications\Adobe Illustrator CS3\ Cool Extras\Sample
Files\Sample Art\ on a Mac).
When you launch Illustrator CS3 for the first time, a Welcome screen appears,
giving you various options. Click the Open icon and then browse to locate a
file to open. (Note that you can uncheck the Don’t Show Again check box to
not see the Welcome screen at launch.)
If your preferences have been changed from the original defaults, the Welcome
screen may not appear. To open a file in that case, choose File➪Open and
select the file in the Open dialog box. The Open dialog box is used to open
existing Adobe Illustrator files, or even files from other Adobe applications.
Use File➪Open to open PDFs in Illustrator as well as many other file formats.
Creating a New Document
To create a new document in Illustrator, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.

Book IV
Chapter 2
Discovering
Illustrator CS3
Taking a Look at the Document Window
451
The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-2. This
dialog box enables you to determine the new document’s profile, size,
units of measurement, color mode, and page orientation.
2. Enter a name for your new file in the Name text field.
You can determine the name of the file now or when you save the docu-
ment later.
3. Choose a New Document Profile from a drop-down list.
Selecting the correct profile sets up preferences, such as resolution and
colors, correctly. Select the Advanced tab to see what changes are
selected for each profile and change them if necessary.
4. Set the size of the document page by choosing from the Size drop-down
list or by typing measurements in the Width and Height text fields.
The size can be set from several standard sizes available in the Size
drop-down list, or you can enter your own measurements in the Width
and Height text fields. Note that several Web sizes are listed first, fol-
lowed by other typical paper sizes.
5. Select the type of measurement that you’re most comfortable with by
choosing from the Units drop-down list.
Note that your selection sets all measurement boxes and rulers to the
increments you choose: points, picas, inches, millimeters, centimeters,
or pixels.
6. Pick the orientation for the artboard.
The artboard is your canvas for creating your artwork in Illustrator. You
can choose between Portrait (the short sides of the artboard at the top
and bottom) and Landscape (the long sides of the artboard on the top
and bottom).
7. When you’re finished making your selections, click OK.
An Illustrator artboard appears.
Don’t worry if document size and color mode need to be changed at a later
point. You can change them by choosing File➪Document Setup and making
changes in the Document Setup dialog box.
Taking a Look at the Document Window
To investigate the work area and really get familiar with Illustrator, open 
a new document and take a look around. In the Illustrator work area, you
have a total of 227 inches in width and height to create your artwork in.

Taking a Look at the Document Window
452
That’s great, but it also leaves enough space to lose objects, too! The follow-
ing list explains the areas that you’ll work with as you create artwork in
Illustrator:
✦Imageable area: The space inside the innermost dotted lines, which
marks the printing area on the page. Many printers can’t print all the
way to the edges of the paper, so the imageable area is determined by
the printer that you have selected in the Print dialog box. To turn off or
on this dotted border, choose View➪Hide/Show Page Tiling.
You can move the imageable area around on your page by using the
Page tool. See the nearby sidebar, “The Page tool,” for more on this tool.
✦Edge of the page: The page’s edge is marked by the outermost set of
dotted lines.
✦Nonimageable area: The space between the two sets of dotted lines rep-
resenting the imageable area and the edge of the page. The nonimage-
able area is the margin of the page that can’t be printed on.
✦Artboard: The area bounded by solid lines that represents the entire
region that can contain printable artwork. By default, the artboard is the
same size as the page, but it can be enlarged or reduced. The U.S. default
artboard is 8.5 x 11 inches, but it can be set as large as 227 x 227 inches.
You can hide the artboard boundaries by choosing View➪Hide Artboard.
The Page tool
Use the Page tool to move the printable area of
your page to a different location. For example,
if you have a printer that can print only on paper
that is 8.5 x 11 inches or less, but you have a
page size of 11 x 17, you can use the Page tool
(a hidden tool accessed by holding down the
mouse button on the Hand tool) to indicate
what part of the page you want to print. Follow
these steps to use the Page tool:
1. When adjusting page boundaries, choose
View➪Fit in Window so that you can see
all of your artwork.
2. Hold down on the Hand tool to select the
hidden Page tool.
The pointer becomes a dotted cross when
you move it to the active window.
3. Position the mouse over the artboard and
click and drag the page to a new location.
As you drag, the Page tool acts as if you
were moving the page from its lower-left
corner. Two gray rectangles are displayed.
The outer rectangle represents the page
size, and the inner rectangle represents the
printable area of a page. You can move the
page anywhere on the artboard; just
remember that any part of a page that
extends past the printable area boundary
isn’t printed.

Book IV
Chapter 2

Illustrator CS3
Becoming Familiar with the Tools
453
✦Scratch area: The area outside the artboard that extends to the edge 
of the 227-inch square window. The scratch area represents a space on
which you can create, edit, and store elements of artwork before moving
them onto the artboard. Objects placed onto the scratch area are visi-
ble on-screen, but they don’t print. However, objects in the scratch area
will appear if the document is saved and placed as an image in other
applications.
Basically, the rules regarding the work area are simple: If you’re printing
directly from Adobe Illustrator, make sure that you choose the proper paper
size and printer in the Print dialog box. Open the Print dialog box by choos-
ing File➪Print. If you’re creating artwork for another application, such as for
a document you’re creating in InDesign, the boundaries have no effect on
what appears in the Illustrator file. Everything in Illustrator’s scratch area
will appear in the other application.
Becoming Familiar with the Tools
As you begin using Adobe Illustrator, you’ll find it helpful to be familiar with
its tools. Tools are used to create, select, and manipulate objects in
Illustrator. The tools should be visible as a default, but if not, you can access
them by choosing Window➪Tools.
Table 2-1 lists the tools that we show you how to use throughout this mini-
book. Hover the cursor over the tool in the toolbox to see the name of the
tool appear in a ToolTip. In parentheses on the ToolTip (and noted in the
second column of Table 2-1) is the keyboard command that you can use to
access that tool. When you see a small triangle at the lower-right corner of
the tool icon, you know that it contains additional hidden tools. Select the
tool and hold the mouse button to see any hidden tools.

Checking Out the Panels
The new standardized interface is a great boost for users as Illustrator’s
panel system is similar to all the other products in Adobe’s Creative Suites.
This consistency makes working and finding tools and features easier.

Checking Out the Panels
456
When you first open Illustrator, you’ll notice the one-column toolbar and the
panels that have been reduced to icons on the right. To select a panel, click
the appropriate icon, and the Fill panel appears.
How do you know which icon brings up which panel? Good question. If you’re
hunting around for the appropriate panels, you can do one of three things.
✦Choose Window and select the named panel from a list.
✦Position your mouse on the left side of the icons, when you see the
double arrow icon, click and drag to the left. The panel names appear.
✦Click the Expand dock gray bar at the top of the icons. The panels
expand so that you can see their contents and names. See Figure 2-1 to
see the panels in iconic and expanded views.
The panels that you see as a default are docked together. To dock a palette
means that, for organizational purposes, the panel is attached in the docking
area.
Figure 2-1:
The panels

and

Changing Views
457
You can arrange panels to make them more helpful for production. You may
choose to have only certain panels visible while working. Here’s the low-
down on using Illustrator’s panels:
✦To see additional options for each panel, click the Show Options button
on the upper-right side of the panel (see Figure 2-2.)
✦To move a panel group, click and drag above the tabbed panel name.
✦To rearrange or separate a panel from its group, drag the panel’s tab.
Dragging a tab outside the docking area creates a new separate panel
window.
✦To move a tab to another palette, drag the tab to that palette.
Look out for those panels — they can take over your screen! Some panels,
but not all, can be resized. Panels that you can resize have an active lower-
right corner (denoted by three small lines in the corner). To change the size
of a panel, drag the lower-right corner of the panel (on a Mac, drag the size
box at the lower-right corner of the panel).
As you become more efficient, you may find it helpful to reduce the clutter 
on your screen by hiding all panels except those that are necessary for your
work. Save your own panel configuration by choosing Window➪Workspace➪
Save Workspace. Choose Window➪Workspace➪[Basic] to return to the
default workspace.
Changing Views
When you’re working in Illustrator, precision is important, but you also want
to see how the artwork really looks. Whether for the Web or print, Illustrator
offers several ways in which to view your artwork:
✦Preview and Outline views: By default, Illustrator shows the Preview
view, where you see colors, stroke widths, images, and patterns as they
should appear when printed or completed for on-screen presentation.
Figure 2-2:
Each panel
has
additional
options
available.

Changing Views
458
Sometimes this view can become a nuisance, especially if you have two
thick lines and you’re trying to create a corner point by connecting
them. At times like this, or whenever you want the strokes and fills
reduced to the underlying structure, choose View➪Outline. You now 
see the outline of the illustration, as shown in Figure 2-3.
✦Pixel view: If you don’t want to be surprised when your artwork
appears in your Web browser, use the Pixel view. This view, shown in
Figure 2-4, maintains the vectors of your artwork, but gives you a view
showing how the pixels will appear when the image is viewed on-screen,
as if on the Web.
Pixel view is great for previewing what your text will look like 
on-screen — some fonts just don’t look good as pixels, especially if the
text is small. Using Pixel view, you can go through several different fonts
until you find one that is more readable as pixels.
✦Overprint view: For those of you in print production, the Overprint pre-
view can be a real timesaver. Choose View➪Attributes to bring up the
Attributes palette, which you can use to set the fill and stroke colors to
overprint. This view creates additional colors when printing and aids
printers when trapping abutting colors.
Trapping is the slight overprint of a lighter color into a darker color to
correct for press misregistration. When several colors are printed on one

piece, the likelihood that they’ll be perfectly aligned is pretty slim!
Setting a stroke to Overprint on the Window➪Attributes palette is one
solution. With overprint selected, the stroke is overprinted on the touch-
ing colors. This mixing of color produces an additional color, but is less
obvious to the viewer than a white space created by misregistration.
Select Overprint to see the result of overprinting in Overprint view in
Figure 2-5.
Navigating the Work Area with Zoom Controls
You can navigate the work area efficiently by using the Hand tool and the
various zoom controls. You can change the magnification of the artboard in
several ways, including using menu items, the Zoom tool, and keyboard com-
mands. Choose the method you feel most comfortable with:
✦Hand tool: Scroll around the document window by using the scrollbars
or the Hand tool. The Hand tool gives you the ability to scroll by drag-
ging. You can imagine you’re pushing a piece of paper around on your
desk when you use the Hand tool.
Hold down the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool while any
tool (except the Type tool) is selected. Holding down the spacebar while
the Type tool is selected only gives you spaces!
✦View menu: Using the View menu, you can easily select the magnifica-
tion that you want from a choice of four: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Fit In
Window (especially useful when you get lost in the scratch area), and
Actual Size (gives you a 100-percent view of your artwork).
✦New Crop Area tool: Using the new Crop Area tool you can define crop
areas interactively for print or export. You can choose preset formats
and define multiple crop areas.
✦The Zoom tool: Using the Zoom tool, you can click the document
window to zoom in; to zoom out, Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac).
Double-click with the Zoom tool to quickly resize the document window
to 100 percent. Control what is visible when using the Zoom tool by
clicking and dragging over the area that you want zoomed into.

view.

Navigating the Work Area with Zoom Controls

✦Keyboard shortcuts: If you’re not the type of person who likes to use key-
board shortcuts, you may change your mind about using them for magnifi-
cation. They make sense and are easy to use and remember. Table 2-2 lists
the most popular keyboard shortcuts to change magnification.
The shortcuts in Table 2-2 require a little coordination to use, but they
give you more control in your zoom. While holding down the keys, drag
from the upper-left to the bottom-right corner of the area you want to
zoom to. A marquee appears while you’re dragging; when you release
the mouse button, the selected area zooms up to the size of your window!
The Zoom Out command doesn’t give you that much control; it simply
zooms back out, much like the commands in Table 2-2.

 Anchor points, the bounding boxes, and selection tools
 Working with selections
 Grouping and ungrouping selections
 Constraining movement and cloning objects
You’ve probably heard the old line, “You have to select it to affect it.”
This statement is so true. When you’re ready to apply a change to an
object in Illustrator, you must have that object selected, or Illustrator won’t
know what to do. You’ll sit there clicking a color swatch over and over
again, and nothing will happen. Although making selections may sound
simple, it can become more difficult when working on complicated artwork.
Getting to Know the Selection Tools
Before delving into the world of selecting objects in Illustrator, you must
know what the selection tools are. In this section, we take you through a
quick tour of anchor points (integral to the world of selections), the bound-
ing box, and, of course, the selection tools (yes, there are more than one).
Anchor points
To understand selections, you must first understand how Illustrator works
with anchor points. Anchor points act like handles and can be individually
selected and moved to other locations. Essentially, the anchor points are
what you use to drag objects or parts of objects around the workspace.
After you’ve placed anchor points on an object, you can then create strokes
or paths from the anchor points.
You can select several anchor points at the same time (Figure 3-1) or only
one (Figure 3-2). Selecting several anchor points at once enables you to
move the entire object without changing the anchor points in relationship 
to one another. You can tell which anchor points are selected and active
because they appear as solid boxes.

Getting to Know the Selection Tools
462
Bounding box
As a default, Illustrator shows a bounding box when an object is selected
with the Selection tool (a bounding box is shown in Figure 3-1). This feature
can be helpful if you understand its function, but confusing if you don’t know
how to use it.
By dragging on the handles, you can use the bounding box for quick trans-
forms, such as scaling and rotating. To rotate, you pass the mouse cursor
(without clicking) outside a handle until you see a rotate symbol, and then
drag.
If the bounding box bothers you, you can turn off the feature by choosing
View➪Hide Bounding Box.
Selection tools
Illustrator CS3 offers three main selection tools:
✦Selection tool: Selects entire objects or groups. This tool activates all
anchor points in an object or group at the same time, allowing you to
move an object without changing its shape.
✦Direct Selection tool: Selects individual points.
✦Group Selection tool: Hidden in the Direct Selection tool in the toolbox,
you use this tool to select items within a group. This tool adds grouped

items as you click an object in the order in which objects were grouped.
This selection tool will become more useful to you as you find out about
grouping objects in Illustrator.
You can select an object with the Selection tool using one of three main
methods:
✦Click the object’s path.
✦Click an anchor point of the object.
✦Drag a marquee around part or all of the object’s path. (In the later sec-
tion, “Using a marquee to select an object,” we discuss using the mar-
quee method.)
Use the Magic Wand selection tool to select objects with like values, such as
fill and stroke colors, based upon a tolerance, and stroke weight. Change the
options of this tool by double-clicking the Magic Wand tool.
Use the Lasso tool to click and drag around anchor points that you want to
select.
Working with Selections
After you have an understanding about the basics of selections, you proba-
bly will be anxious to jump in and start with the selecting. So in this section,
we introduce you to the basics: making a selection, working with anchor
points and the marquee, making multiple selections, and, of course, saving
your work.
When we give you Ctrl key combinations, you should press the Ô key if
you’re using a Mac (unless we note otherwise).
Creating a selection
To work with selections, you need to actually have something on the page in
Illustrator. Use the following techniques to make a selection:
1. Create a new page in Adobe Illustrator (any size or profile is okay).
Alternatively, you can open an existing illustration; see Chapter 2 of this
minibook for instructions.
2. If you’re starting from a new page, create an object to work with.
For example, select the Rectangle tool and click and drag from the top
left to the lower right to create a shape.

Working with Selections
464
Exact size doesn’t matter, but make it large enough that you can see it.
To start over, choose Edit➪Undo or press Ctrl+Z.
As a default, all shapes start out having a black stroke and a white fill
(see Figure 3-3). If yours is not black and white, press D, which changes
the selected object to the default colors.
3. Using the Selection tool, click the object to make sure that it’s active.
Note that all anchor points are solid, indicating that all anchor points
are active, as shown in Figure 3-4. As a default, you see many additional
points that you can use to transform your selected object.
4. Click and drag the rectangle to another location.
All anchor points travel together.
5. When completed, deactivate your selection.
You can use one of these three methods:
• Choose Select➪Deselect.
• Ctrl+click anywhere on the page.
• Press Ctrl+Shift+A.

Selecting an anchor point
When you have a selection to work with (see the preceding numbered list),
you can deselect all the active anchor points and then make just one anchor
point active. Just follow these steps:
1. Make sure that the object isn’t selected by choosing Select➪Deselect.
2. Select the Direct Selection tool (the white arrow) from the toolbox.
3. Click one anchor point.
Only one anchor point (the one you clicked) is solid, and the others are
hollow, as shown in Figure 3-5.
4. Click and drag that solid anchor point using the Direct Selection tool.
Only that one anchor point moves.
New in Illustrator CS3, an anchor point actually enlarges when you cross over
it using the Direct Selection tool. This enlargement is a big break for those who
typically have to squint to see where the anchor points are positioned.
Using a marquee to select an object
Sometimes it’s easier to surround what you want selected by dragging the
mouse to create a marquee. Follow these steps to select an object by creat-
ing a marquee:
1. Choose the Selection tool.
2. Click outside the object (we use a rectangle in this example) and drag
over a small part of it, as shown in Figure 3-6.
The entire object becomes selected.
Figure 3-5:
Only the
selected
anchor point
becomes
active when

Working with Selections
466
You can also select just one anchor point in an object by using the marquee
method:
1. Make sure that the object isn’t selected by choosing Select➪Deselect
and then choose the Direct Selection tool.
2. Click outside a corner of the object and drag over just the anchor
point that you want to select.
Notice that only that anchor point is active, which can be a sight-saver
when you’re trying to select individual points (see Figure 3-7).
You can use this method to cross over just the two top points or side anchor
points to activate multiple anchor points as well.
Selecting multiple objects
If you have multiple items on your page, you can select them by using one of
the following methods:

Grouping and Ungrouping
467
✦Select one object or anchor point and then hold down the Shift key 
and click another object or anchor point. Depending on which selection
tool you’re using, you’ll either select all anchor points on an object
(Selection tool) or additional anchor points only (Direct Select tool).
You can use the Shift key to deactivate an object as well. Shift+click a
selected object to deselect it.
✦Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A.
✦Use the marquee selection technique and drag outside and over the
objects. When you use this technique with the Selection tool, all anchor
points in the objects are selected; with the Direct Selection tool, only the
points that you drag over are selected.
Saving a selection
Spending way too much time trying to make your selections? Illustrator
comes to the rescue with the Save Selection feature. After you have a selec-
tion that you may need again, choose Select➪Save Selection and name the
selection. It now appears at the bottom of the Select menu. To change the
name or delete the saved selection, choose Select➪Edit Selection. This selec-
tion is saved with the document.
Grouping and Ungrouping
Keep objects together by grouping them. The Group function is handy in a
situation when you’re creating something from multiple objects, such as a
logo. With the Group function, you can make sure that all the objects that
make up the logo stay together when you move, rotate, scale, or copy it. Just
follow these steps to create a group:
1. If you aren’t already working with an illustration that contains a
whole bunch of objects, create several objects on a new page, any-
where and any size.
For example, select the Rectangle tool and click and drag on the page
several times to create additional rectangles.
2. Select the first object with the Selection tool and then hold down the
Shift key and click a second object.
3. Choose Object➪Group or press Ctrl+G.
4. Choose Select➪Deselect and then click one of the objects with the
Selection tool.
Both objects become selected.

Grouping and Ungrouping
468
5. While the first two objects are still selected, Shift+click a third object.
6. With all three objects selected, choose Object➪Group again.
Illustrator remembers the grouping order. To prove that, deselect the
group by choosing Select➪Deselect and switch to the Group Selection
tool. (Hold down the mouse button on the Direct Selection tool to access
the Group Selection tool.)
7. Using the Group Selection tool, click the first object, and all anchor
points become active. Click again on the first object, and the second
object becomes selected. Click yet again on the first object, and the
third object becomes selected.
This tool activates the objects in the order that you grouped them. After
you’ve grouped the objects together, you can now treat them as a single
object.
To Ungroup objects, choose Object➪Ungroup or use the key command
Ctrl+Shift+G. In a situation where you group objects twice (because you
added an object to the group, for example), you would have to choose
Ungroup twice.
Using the Isolation mode
Now in Illustrator you can take advantage of the Isolation mode, which
allows you to easily select and edit objects in a group without disturbing
other parts of your artwork. Simply double-click a group, and it opens in a
separate Isolation mode, where all objects outside of the group are dimmed
and inactive. Do the work that you need to on the group and exit out of the
Isolation mode by clicking on the arrow to the left of Group in the upper
right of the window, as shown in Figure 3-8.

Manipulating Selected Objects
In the following list, you can discover a few other cool things that you can do
with selected objects:
✦Moving selected objects: When an object is selected, you can drag it to
any location on the page, but what if you only want to nudge it a bit? To
nudge an item one pixel at a time, select it with the Selection tool and
press the left-, right-, up-, or down-arrow key to reposition the object.
Hold down the Shift key as you press an arrow key to move an object by
ten pixels at a time.
✦Constraining movement: Want to move an object over to the other side
of the page without changing its alignment? Constrain something by
selecting an object with the Selection tool and dragging the item and
then hold down the Shift key before you release the mouse button. By
pressing the Shift key mid-drag, you constrain the movement to 45-, 90-,
or 180-degree angles!
✦Cloning selected objects: Use the Selection tool to easily clone (dupli-
cate) an item and move it to a new location. To clone an item, simply
select it with the Selection tool and then hold down the Alt key (Option
key on a Mac). Look for the cursor to change to two arrows (see Fig-
ure 3-9) and then drag the item to another location on the page. Notice
that the original object is left intact and that a copy of the object has
been created and moved.
✦Constraining the clone: By Alt+dragging (Option+dragging on a Mac) an
item and then pressing Shift, you can clone the item and keep it aligned
with the original. Remember: Don’t hold down the Shift key until you’re
in the process of dragging the item; otherwise, pressing Shift will dese-
lect the original object.

double
arrow
before
dragging to

Manipulating Selected Objects
470
After you’ve cloned an object to a new location, try this neat trick
where you create multiple objects equally apart from each other using
the Transform Again command: Choose Object➪Transform➪
Transform Again, or press Ctrl+D to have another object cloned the
exact distance as the first cloned object (see Figure 3-10). We discuss
transforms in more detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook.
✦Using the Select menu: Using the Select menu, you can gain additional
selection controls, such as Select➪Inverse, which allows you to select
one object and then turn your selection inside out. Also, the Select➪
Select Same options allow you to select one object and then select addi-
tional objects on the page based upon similarities in Color, Fill, Stroke,
and other special attributes.

Chapter 4: Creating Basic Shapes
In This Chapter
 Introducing rectangles, ellipses, stars, and polygons
 Resizing shapes after creation
 Creating shapes
S
hapes, shapes, shapes . . . they’re everywhere in Illustrator. Basic
shapes, such as squares, circles, polygons, and stars, are used in all
types of illustrations. With the right know-how and the right shape tools,
you can easily create these shapes exactly the way you want. In this chap-
ter, we show you how to use these tools to control a shape’s outcome,
create shapes based on precise measurements, and change the number of
points a star has.
The Basic Shape Tools
As a default, the only visible shape tool in the toolbox is the Rectangle tool.
Click and hold down that tool, and you have access to the Rounded
Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, and Star tools, shown in Figure 4-1. (Although
you see the Flare tool, it’s not a basic shape.)
You can tear off this tool set so that you don’t have to find the hidden
shapes in the future. Click and hold on the Rectangle tool and drag to the
arrow on the far right. Wait until you see the pop-up hint (Tearoff) and then
release the mouse button. These tools are now in a free-floating toolbar that
you can drag to another location.

Creating rectangles and ellipses
Rectangles and ellipses are the most fundamental shapes that you can create
(see Figure 4-2). To create a rectangle shape freehand, select the Rectangle
tool and simply click the page where you want the shape to appear. Then
drag diagonally toward the opposite side, drag it the distance that you want
the shape to be in size, and release the mouse button. You can drag up or
down. You do the same to create an ellipse with the Ellipse tool.
After you create the shape, adjust its size and position by using the Selection
tool. Reposition the shape by clicking the selected object and dragging.
Resize the object by grabbing a handle and adjusting in or out. To adjust two
sides together, grab a corner handle. To resize your shape proportionally,
Shift+drag a corner handle.
Using the Rounded Rectangle tool
You can create the rounded rectangle by using one of two methods:
✦Freehand clicking and dragging to create the rounded rectangle shape.
✦Clicking once on the artboard to bring up the Rounded Rectangle dialog
box, where you can enter values to define the shape.
The difference between these two methods is that when you open the
Rounded Rectangle dialog box (see Figure 4-3), you have the option to enter
a value in the Corner Radius text field, which determines how much round-
ing is applied to the corners of the shape. The smaller the value, the less
rounded the corners will be; the higher the value, the more rounded. Be
careful; you can actually round a rectangle’s corners so much that it
becomes an ellipse!
Figure 4-2:

Using the Polygon tool
You create stars and polygons in much the same way as the rectangles and
ellipses. Select the Polygon tool and click and drag from one corner to
another to create the default six-sided polygon shape. You can also select
the Polygon tool and click once on the artboard to change the Polygon tool
options in the Polygon dialog box.
You can change the polygon shape by entering new values in the Radius and
Sides text fields, as shown in Figure 4-4. The radius is determined from the
center to the edge of the polygon. The value for the number of sides can
range from 3 (making triangles a breeze to create) to 1000. Whoa . . . a poly-
gon with 1,000 sides would look like a circle unless it was the size of Texas!
Using the Star tool
To create a star shape, select the Star tool from the toolbox. (Remember that
it may be hiding under other shape tools.) If you click once on the artboard
to bring up the Star dialog box, you see three text fields in which you can
enter values to customize your star shape:
✦Radius 1: Distance from the outer points to the center of the star.
✦Radius 2: Distance from the inner points to the center of the star.
✦Points: Number of points that make up the star.

Resizing Shapes
474
The closer together the Radius 1 and Radius 2 values are to each other, the
shorter the points on your star. In other words, you can go from a starburst
to a seal of approval by entering values that are close in the Radius 1 and
Radius 2 text fields, as shown in Figure 4-5.
Resizing Shapes
You often need a shape to be an exact size (for example, 2 x 3 inches). After
you create a shape, the best way to resize it to exact measurements is to use
the Transform panel, shown in Figure 4-6. Have your object selected and
then choose Window➪Transform to open the Transform panel. Note that on
this panel, you can enter values to place an object in the X and Y fields, as
well as enter values in the Width and Height text fields to determine the
exact size of an object.

In many of the Adobe Illustrator panels, you may see measurement incre-
ments consisting of points, picas, millimeters, centimeters, or inches, which
can be confusing and maybe even intimidating. But you can control which
measurement increments to use.
Show Rulers by choosing View➪Show Rulers or press Ctrl+R. Then right-click
(Ctrl+click on a Mac) on the ruler to change the measurement increment to an
increment you’re more familiar with. The contextual menu that appears allows
you to change the measurement increment right on the document.
Alternatively, you can simply type the number followed by a measurement
extension into the Width and Height text fields in the Transform palette (refer
to Figure 4-6), and the measurement converts properly for you. Table 4-1 lists
the extensions that you can use.

If you don’t want to bother creating a shape freehand and then changing the
size, select the shape tool and click your page. An options dialog box spe-
cific to the shape you’re creating appears, in which you can type values into
the width and height text fields.
If you accidentally click and drag, you end up with a very small shape on
your page. If this happens, don’t fret. Simply get rid of the small shape by
selecting it and pressing the Delete key, and then try again.
Tips for Creating Shapes
The following are simple tips to improve your skills at creating basic shapes
in Illustrator:
✦Press and hold the Shift key while dragging with the Rectangle or Ellipse
tool to create a perfect square or circle. This trick is also helpful when
you’re using the Polygon and Star tools — holding down the Shift key
constrains them so that they’re straight (see Figure 4-7).

Tips for Creating Shapes
476
✦Create a shape from the center out by holding down the Alt (Option on a
Mac) key while dragging (see Figure 4-8). Hold down Alt+Shift (Option+
Shift on a Mac) to pull a constrained shape out from the center.
✦When creating a star or polygon shape by clicking and dragging, if you
keep the mouse button down, you can then press the up- or down-arrow
key to interactively add points or sides to your shape.
Creating advanced shapes
At times, it may be much easier to use advanced tools in Illustrator to create
unique shapes. The Pathfinder panel is an incredible tool that allows you to
combine, knock out, and even create shapes from other intersected shapes.
You use the Pathfinder panel, shown in Figure 4-9, to combine objects into
new shapes. To use the Pathfinder panel, choose Window➪Pathfinder.
Across the top row of the Pathfinder panel are the Shape Modes, which let
you control the interaction between selected shapes. You can choose from
the shape modes listed in Table 4-2.

What It Does
Add To Shape Area
Essentially unites the selected shape into
one.
Subtract from shape area

Intersect shape areas
Uses the area of the topmost shape to clip
the underlying shape as a mask would.
Exclude overlapping 
Uses the area of the shape to invert the

underlying shape, turning filled regions
into holes and vice versa.
If you like the Exclude Overlapping Shapes effect, you can also get a similar
effect by selecting several shapes and selecting Object➪Compound Path➪
Make. This command takes the topmost shapes and “punches” them out of
the bottom shape.
The shapes remain separate so that you can still adjust them, which is great
if you like to tweak your artwork (but it drives some people crazy). You can
turn the results of the Shape Modes into one shape by either pressing the
Expand button after selecting the shape mode or holding down the Alt key
(Option key on a Mac) when selecting a Shape Mode.
Using the Pathfinders
The Pathfinders are the buttons at the bottom of the Pathfinder panel. They
also let you create new shapes out of overlapping objects. Table 4-3 offers a
summary of what each Pathfinder does.

Chapter 5: Using the Pen 
Tool and Placing Images
In This Chapter
 Familiarizing yourself with the Pen tool
 Creating paths, closed shapes, and curves
 Creating template layers
 Placing images in Illustrator CS3
You’ve seen illustrations that you know are made from paths, but how
do you make your own? In this chapter, we show you how to use the
Pen tool to create paths and closed shapes.
The Pen tool requires a little more coordination than other Illustrator tools.
Fortunately, Adobe Illustrator CS3 includes new features to help make using
the Pen tool a little easier. After you master the Pen tool, the possibilities for
creating illustrations are unlimited. Read this chapter to build your skills
with the most popular feature in graphic software, the Bézier curve.
Pen Tool Fundamentals
You can use the Pen tool to create all sorts of things, such as straight lines,
curves, and closed shapes, which you can then incorporate into illustrations:
✦Bézier curve: Originally developed by Pierre Bézier in the 1970s for CAD/
CAM operations, the Bézier curve (shown in Figure 5-1) became the
underpinnings of the entire Adobe PostScript drawing model. A Bézier
curve is one that you can control the depth and size of by using direction
lines.
✦Anchor points: You can use anchor points to control the shape of a
path or object. Anchor points are automatically created when using
shape tools. You can manually create anchor points by clicking from
point to point with the Pen tool.
✦Direction lines: These lines are essentially the handles that you use on
curved points to adjust the depth and angle of curved paths.

Pen Tool Fundamentals
480
✦Closed shape: When a path is created, it becomes a closed shape when
the start point joins the endpoint.
✦Simple path: A path consists of one or more straight or curved seg-
ments. Anchor points mark the endpoints of the path segments.
In the next section, we show you how to control the anchor points.
Creating a straight line
A basic function of the Pen tool is to create a simple path. You can create a
simple, straight line with the Pen tool by following these steps:
1. Before you start, press D or click the small black-and-white color
swatches at the bottom of the toolbox.
You revert back to the default colors of a black stroke and a white fill.
With black as a stroke, you can see your path clearly.
2. Click the Fill swatch, located at the bottom of the toolbox, to make
sure that the Fill swatch is in front of the Stroke swatch, and then
press the forward slash (/) key to change the fill to None.
The trick of pressing D to change the foreground and background colors
to the default of black and white also works in Photoshop and InDesign.
3. Open a new blank page and select the Pen tool.
Notice that when you move the mouse over the artboard, the Pen cursor
appears with an X beside it, indicating that you’re creating the first
anchor point of a path.
4. Click the artboard to create the first anchor point of a line.
The X disappears.

Don’t drag the mouse, or you’ll end up creating a curve instead of a
straight segment.
5. Click anywhere else on the document to create the ending anchor
point of the line.
Illustrator creates a path between the two anchor points. Essentially, the
path looks like a line segment with an anchor point at each end (see
Figure 5-2).
To make a correction to a line you created with the Pen tool (as described in
the preceding steps), follow these steps:
1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure that no objects are currently
selected.
2. Select the Direct Selection tool from the toolbox.
Notice that in Illustrator CS3, Adobe has been kind and added a feature
that enlarges the anchor point when you pass over it with the Direct
Selection tool.
3. Click to select one anchor point on the line.
Notice that the selected anchor point is solid and the other is hollow.
Solid indicates that the anchor point you clicked is active while the
hollow one is inactive.
4. Click and drag the anchor point with the Direct Selection tool.
The selected anchor point moves, changing the direction of the path
while not affecting the other anchor point. And that’s it.
Use the Direct Selection tool (shortcut to select this tool is A) to make any
corrections to paths. Make sure that only the anchor point you want to
change is active. If the entire path is selected, all anchor points are solid. If
only one anchor point is selected, all but that one point will be hollow.

Creating a constrained straight line
In this section, we show you how to create a real straight line, meaning one
that is on multiples of a 45-degree angle. Illustrator makes it easy; just follow
these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool and click anywhere on the artboard to place an
anchor point.
2. Hold down the Shift key and click another location to place the
ending anchor point.
Notice that when you’re holding the Shift key, the line snaps to a multi-
ple of 45 degrees. Remember: Release the mouse button before you
release the Shift key, or else the line will pop out of alignment.
Creating a curve
In this section, you discover how to use the Bézier path to create a curved
segment. We won’t guarantee that you’ll love it — not at first anyway. But
after you know how to use a Bézier path, you’ll likely find it useful. To create
a Bézier path, just follow these steps:
1. Starting with a blank artboard, select the Pen tool and click anywhere
on the artboard to place the first anchor point.
2. Now click someplace else to place your ending anchor point, but don’t
let go of the mouse button. Drag the cursor until a direction line
appears.
If you look real close, you see that anchor points are square, and the
direction lines have circles at the end, as shown in Figure 5-3.
3. Drag the direction line closer to the anchor point to flatten the curve;
drag farther away from the anchor point to increase the curve, as
shown in Figure 5-4.
4. Release the mouse button when you’re happy with the curve.

Pen Tool Fundamentals
483
What you have created is an open path, a path that doesn’t form a closed
shape. We show you how to reconnect to the starting point of the path to
make a closed shape in the next section.
To alter a curved segment after you’ve created it, follow these steps:
1. Choose Select➪Deselect to make sure that no objects are currently
selected.
2. Choose the Direct Selection tool and click the last anchor point 
created.
If they’re not already visible, the direction lines appear.
If you have a hard time selecting the anchor point, drag a marquee
around it using the Direct Selection tool.
3. Click precisely at the end of one of the direction lines; drag the direc-
tion line to change the curve.
Reconnecting to an existing path
Creating one segment is fine if you just want a line or an arch. But if you want
to create a shape, you need to add more anchor points to the original seg-
ment. If you want to fill your shape with a color or a gradient, you need to
close it, meaning that you need to eventually come back to the starting
anchor point.
To add segments to your path and create a closed shape, follow these steps:
1. Create a segment (straight or curved).
We show you how in the preceding sections of this chapter.
You can continue from this point, clicking and adding anchor points
until you eventually close the shape. For this example, you deselect the
path so that you can discover how to continue adding to paths that have
already been created. Knowing how to edit existing paths is extremely
helpful when you need to make adjustments to artwork.

tional lines

2. With the Pen tool selected, move the cursor over an end anchor point
on the deselected path.
3. To connect your next segment, click when you see the Pen icon with a
forward slash.
The forward slash indicates that you’re connecting to this path.
4. Click someplace else to create the next anchor point in the path; drag
the mouse if you want to create a curved segment.
5. Click to place additional anchor points, dragging as needed to curve
those segments.
Remember that you want to close this shape, so place your anchor
points so that you can eventually come back around to the first anchor
point.
Figure 5-5 shows a shape that is a result of several linked anchor points.
6. When you get back to the first anchor point, move the cursor over it
and click when the close icon (a small hollow circle) appears, as
shown in Figure 5-6.
The shape now has no end points.

Controlling the curves
After you feel comfortable creating curves and paths, you need to take 
control of those curves so that you can create them with a greater degree 
of precision. The following steps walk you through the manual method for
changing direction of anchor points, as well as reveal helpful keyboard com-
mands to make controlling paths a little more fluid. At the end of this sec-
tion, we introduce you to new tools that may also want to take advantage 
of to help you get control of the Pen tool.
To control a curve, follow these steps:
1. Create a new document and then choose View➪Show Grid to show a
series of horizontal and vertical rules that act as guides.
If it helps, use the Zoom tool to zoom in to the document.
2. Using the Pen tool, click an intersection of any of these lines in the
middle area of the page to place your initial anchor point and drag
upward.
Let go, but don’t click when the direction line has extended up to the
horizontal grid line above it, as shown in Figure 5-7a.
3. Click to place the second anchor point on the intersection of the grid
directly to the right of your initial point; drag the direction line down
to the grid line directly below it, as shown in Figure 5-7b.
If you have a hard time keeping the direction line straight, hold down the
Shift key to constrain it.
4. Choose Select➪Deselect to deselect your curve.
Congratulations! You’ve created a controlled curve. In these steps, we
created an arch that is going up, so we first clicked and dragged up.
Likewise, to create a downward arch, you must click and drag down.
Using the grid, try to create a downward arch like the one shown in
Figure 5-7c.

Creating a corner point
To change directions of a path from being a curve to a corner, you have to
create a corner point, as shown on the right in Figure 5-8. A corner point has
no direction lines and allows for a sharp direction change in a path.
You can switch from the Pen tool to the Convert Anchor Point tool to change
a smooth anchor point into a corner point, but that process is a bit time con-
suming. An easier way is to press the Alt (Option on a Mac) key (the Pen tool
temporarily changes into the Convert Anchor Point tool) while clicking the
anchor point.
To change a smooth anchor point into a corner point using the shortcut
method, follow these steps:
1. Create an upward arch.
We show you how in the preceding section, “Controlling the curves”
(refer to Figure 5-8b).
2. Hold down the Alt (Option on a Mac) key and position the cursor over
the last anchor point (the last point that you created with the Pen tool).
3. When the cursor changes to a caret (that’s the Convert Anchor Point
tool), click and drag until the direction line is up to the grid line
above, as shown on the left in Figure 5-9.
4. Release the Alt (Option on a Mac) key and the mouse button, move the
cursor to the grid line to the right, and click and drag down.

The Hidden Pen Tools
Hold down on the Pen tool icon in the toolbox to access additional tools: the
Add Anchor Point, Delete Anchor Point, and Convert Anchor Point tools,
shown in Table 5-1. In the preceding section, we show you how to create a
corner point with the shortcut method, by pressing the Alt (Option on a
Mac) key to access the Convert Anchor Point tool. You may feel more com-
fortable switching to that tool when you need to convert a point, but switch-
ing tools can be more time-consuming.

Even though you can use a hidden tool to delete and add anchor points,
Illustrator automatically does this as a default when you’re using the Pen
tool. When you move the cursor over an anchor point with the Pen tool, a
minus icon appears. To delete that anchor point, simply click. Likewise,
when you move the cursor over a part of the path that doesn’t contain
anchor points, a plus icon appears. Simply click to add an anchor point.
If you prefer to use the tools dedicated to adding and deleting anchor points,
choose Edit (Windows) or Illustrator (Mac)➪Preferences➪General; in the
Preferences dialog box that appears, select the Disable Auto Add/Delete
check box. Then, when you want to add or delete an anchor point, select 
the appropriate tool and click on the path.
So what’s new in CS3?
Some tools have been added to the control panel in Illustrator CS3, and you
can take advantage of them to do many of the Pen tool functions you do
manually. To tell you the truth, using keyboard modifiers to switch your Pen

tool is probably still faster, but some of you who may be resistant to contort-
ing your fingers while trying to create a path may appreciate these new
tools.
In order to see the new tools, select the Pen tool and start creating a path.
Notice that the control panel has a series of buttons available, as shown in
Figure 5-10.
Using the new Eraser tool
The Eraser tool is a tool both new and old users will love! The Eraser tool
allows you to quickly remove areas of artwork as easily as you erase pixels
in Photoshop by stroking with your mouse over any shape or set of shapes.
New paths are automatically created along the edges of your erasure, even
preserving the smoothness of your erasure as you see in Figure 5-11.
By double-clicking the Eraser tool, you can define the diameter, angle, and
roundness of your eraser and even set Wacom (digitizing) tablet interaction
parameters, such as Pressure and Tilt (see Figure 5-12).

Tracing Artwork
489
If you want to erase more than a single selected object, use Isolation Mode to
segregate grouped objects for editing. Remember that to enter Isolation mode,
you simply double-click a group of items. You can then use the eraser on all
objects in that group at once without disturbing the rest of your design.
Tracing Artwork
You can use a template layer to trace an image manually. A template layer is a
locked, dimmed layer that you can use to draw over placed images with the
Pen tool, much like you’d do with a piece of onion skin paper over the top of
an image.
Just follow these steps to create a template layer:
1. Take a scanned image or logo and save it in a format that Illustrator
can import from your image-editing program, such as Photoshop.
Typically, you save the image as an .eps, .tif, or native .psd
(Photoshop file).
2. Choose File➪Place to open the Place dialog box.
3. In the Place dialog box, locate the saved image; then select the
Template check box and click Place.
Note that the Template check box may be in a different location depend-
ing upon your platform, but it’s always located at the bottom of the
dialog box.
Selecting the Template check box tells Illustrator to lock down the
scanned image on a layer. Essentially, you can’t reposition or edit your
image.
After you click Place, a template layer is automatically created for you,
and another layer is waiting for you to create your path. The newly cre-
ated top layer is like a piece of tracing paper that has been placed on
top of the scanned image.
Figure 5-12:

4. Re-create the image by tracing over it with the Pen tool.
5. When you’re done, turn the visibility off the placed image by clicking
the Visibility icon to the left of the template layer.
You now have a path that you can use in place of the image, which is
useful if you’re creating an illustration of an image or are digitally re-
creating a logo.
For more about layers, check out Chapter 8 of this minibook.
Keep practicing to get yourself more comfortable with clicking and dragging,
flowing with the direction line pointing the way that you want the path to be
created; everything will fall into place.
Using Live Trace
Use the Live Trace feature, introduced in Illustrator CS2, to automatically trace
raster images into vector paths. This does work great in many instances, but is
definitely not a “magic pill” for getting your images re-created as vectors. For
example, a logo with many precise curves and straight lines isn’t a good candi-
date for this feature, but a hand-drawn illustration, clip art, or other drawing
works well.
Here are the steps that you want to take to use Live Trace.
1. Choose File➪Place and place a scan or raster illustration that you
want to convert to vector paths.
2. Immediately after placing, you see that the control panel now has
some additional buttons available, as shown in Figure 5-13.
3. You can either press the Live Trace button to automatically trace
based upon default settings or, better yet, click and hold on the
Tracing presets and options arrow and choose a more appropriate 
setting.

the Control panel to expand the trace object to vector paths that can
be edited.
See Chapter 9 of this minibook for more information on painting fills and
strokes.
Other Things You Should Know about Placing Images
In the preceding section, you discover how to place an image as a template.
But what if you want to place an image to be utilized in your illustration file?
Simply choose File➪Place.
Click once on an image to see the Link check box. If you keep the check box
selected, the image is linked to the original file. This is good if you plan on ref-
erencing the file several times in the illustration (saves file space) or if you
want to edit the original and have it update the placed image in Illustrator.
This option is usually checked by those in the prepress industry who want to
have access to the original image file. Just remember to send the image with
the Illustrator file if it’s to be output or used someplace other than on your
computer.
If you uncheck the Link check box, the image is embedded into the Illustrator
file. This option does keep the filing system cleaner, but doesn’t leave much
room to edit the original image at a later point. There are certain instances,
such as when you want an image to become a Symbol (see Chapter 11 of this
minibook), that the image will have to be embedded, but most functions work
with linked and unlinked files.
Using Photoshop Layer Comps
Layer Comps are a feature in Photoshop that allow you to set the visibility,
appearance, and position of layers. It’s a great organizational tool that you
can now take advantage of in other Adobe products. Read more about
Photoshop in Book II.
You can place a .psd (Photoshop) image that has saved Layer Comps from
Photoshop and choose which layer comp set you want visible while placing
in Adobe Illustrator CS3.

In This Chapter
 Introducing the Type tools
 Getting to know text areas
 Manipulating text along paths and within shapes
 Assigning font styles

 Using the new control panel for text controls
 Saving time with text utilities
O
ne of Illustrator’s strongest areas is manipulating text. Whether you’re
using Illustrator to create logos, business cards, or type to be used on
the Web, you have everything you need to create professional text.
In this chapter, you meet the Type tools and discover a few basic (and more
advanced) text-editing tricks that you can take advantage of. You then dis-
cover other text tools, such as the Character and Paragraph panels. You end
the chapter by getting a quick-and-dirty lowdown on the Illustrator text utili-
ties. These utilities can save you loads of time, so don’t skip this section.
Working with Type
You can do all sorts of cool things with type, from the simplest tasks of cre-
ating a line of text and dealing with text overflow to more complicated
tricks, such as placing text along paths and wrapping text around objects.
Figure 6-1 shows the Type tools with an example of what you can do with
each one. Click and hold the Type tool to see the hidden tools. The different
tools give you the ability to be creative and also accommodate foreign 
languages.

Working with Type
494
Creating text areas
A text area is a region that you define. Text, when inserted in this region, is
constrained within the shape. To create a text area, click and drag with the
Type tool.
As you create and finish typing in a text area, you may want to quickly click
and drag a new text area elsewhere on your artboard. Unfortunately, if
you’re on the Type tool, Illustrator doesn’t allow you to do so. You have two
options to address this problem:
✦Choose Select➪Deselect and then create another area.
✦Hold down the Ctrl key (or, as always unless otherwise noted, Ô on a
Mac) to temporarily access the Selection tool, and click. When you
release the Ctrl key, you’ll still be on the Type tool, and you can then
create a new text area.
Creating a line of text
To create a simple line of text, select the Type tool and click the artboard. A
blinking insertion point appears. You can now start typing. Using this method,
the line of type goes on forever and ever (even beyond the end of the Scratch
area) until you press Enter (Return on a Mac) to start a new line of text. This
excess length is fine if you just need short lines of text, say for callouts or cap-
tions, but it doesn’t work well if you’re creating a label or anything else that
has large amounts of copy.
Figure 6-1:
The Type
tools.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in
Illustrator
Working with Type
495
Many new users click and drag an ever-so-small text area that doesn’t 
allow room for even one letter. If you do this, switch to your Selection tool,
delete the active type area, and then click to create a new text insertion
point.
Flowing text into an area
Select the Type tool and then drag on the artboard to create a text area. 
The cursor appears in the text area; text you type automatically flows to the
next line when it reaches the edge of the text area. You can also switch to 
the Selection tool and adjust the width and height of the text area using the
handles.
Need an exact size for a text area? With the Type tool selected, drag to
create a text area of any size. Then choose Window➪Transform to view the
Transform panel. Type an exact width in the W text field and exact height in
the H text field.
Dealing with text overflow
Watch out for excess text! If you create a text area that’s too small to hold all
the text you want to put into it, a red plus sign appears in the lower-right
corner, as shown in Figure 6-2.
When Illustrator indicates to you that you have too much text for the text
area, you have several options:
✦Make the text area larger by switching to the Selection tool and dragging
the handles.
✦Make the text smaller until you don’t see the overflow indicated.
✦Link this text area to another, which is called threading and is covered
later in this chapter in the “Threading text into shapes” section.

Creating columns of text with the Area Type tool
The easiest and most practical way to create rows and columns of text is 
to use the area type options in Adobe Illustrator. This feature lets you 
create rows and columns from any text area. You can just have rows, or 
you can just have columns (much like columns of text in a newspaper), or
even both.
1. Select the Type tool and drag to create a text area.
2. Choose Type➪Area Type Options.
The Area Type Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. At
the end of this section, we provide a list explaining all the options in the
Area Type Options dialog box.
3. Enter the desired width and height in the Width and Height text
fields.
The Width and Height text fields contain the height and width of your
entire text area. For example, we entered 325 pt in the Width text field
and 250 pt in the Height text field.
4. In the Columns area, enter the number of columns you want to 
create in the Columns Number text field, the span distance in the
Columns Span text field, and the gutter space in the Columns Gutter
text field.
We entered 2 to create two columns in the Columns Number text field.

Type
Options
dialog box

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in

Working with Type
497
The span specifies the height of individual rows and the width of individ-
ual columns. The gutter is the space between the columns and is auto-
matically set for you.
5. Click OK.
When you create two or more columns of text using the Area Type Options
dialog box, text flows to the next column when you reach the end of a
column, as shown in Figure 6-4.
The following is a breakdown of the other options available in the Area Type
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 6-3):
✦Width and Height: The present width and height of the entire text area.
✦Number: The number of rows and/or columns that you want the text
area to contain.
✦Span: The height of individual rows and the width of individual columns.
✦Fixed: Determines what happens to the span of rows and columns if you
resize the type area. When this check box is selected, resizing the area
can change the number of rows and columns but not their width. Leave
this option deselected if you want to resize the entire text area and have
the columns automatically resize with it.
✦Gutter: The empty space between rows or columns.
✦Inset Spacing: The distance from the edges of the text area.
✦First Baseline: Where you want the first line of text to appear. The
Ascent option is the default and starts your text normally at the top. If
you want to put a fixed size in, such as 50 pts from the top, select Fixed
from the drop-down list and enter 50 pt in the Min text field.
✦Text Flow: The direction in which you read the text as it flows to another
row or column. You can choose to have the text flow horizontally (across
rows) or vertically (down columns).

Threading text into shapes
Create custom columns of text that are in different shapes and sizes by
threading closed shapes together. This technique works with rectangles, 
circles, stars, or any closed shape and can lead to some creative text 
areas.
1. Create any shape, any size.
For this example, we’ve created a circle.
2. Create another shape (it can be any shape) someplace else on the
page.
3. Using the Selection tool, select one shape and Shift+click the other to
make just those two shapes active.
4. Choose Type➪Threaded Text➪Create.
A threading line appears, as shown in Figure 6-5, indicating the direction
of the threaded text.
5. Select the Type tool, click the top of the shape to start the threading,
and start typing.
Continue typing until the text flows over into the other shape.
If you don’t want the text to be threaded anymore, choose Type➪
Threaded Text➪Remove Threading, which eliminates all threading from 
the text shapes. To remove one or more shapes from the threading but 
not all the shapes, select the shape you want to remove from the threading
and choose Type➪Threaded Text➪Release Selection.
Wrapping text
Wrapping text isn’t quite the same as wrapping a present — it’s easier! A text
wrap forces text to wrap around a graphic, as shown in Figure 6-6. This fea-
ture can add a bit of creativity to any piece.
Figure 6-5:

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in

Follow these steps to wrap text around another object or group of objects:
1. Select the wrap object.
This is the object that you want the text to wrap around.
2. Make sure that the wrap object is on top of the text you want to wrap
around it by choosing Object➪Arrange➪Bring to Front.
If you’re working in layers (which we discuss in Chapter 8 of this 
minibook), make sure that the wrap object is on the top layer.
3. Choose Object➪Text Wrap➪Make.
An outline of the wrap area is visible.
4. Adjust the wrap area by choosing Object➪Text Wrap➪
Text Wrap Options.
The Text Wrap Options dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-7,
giving you the following options:
• Offset: Specifies the amount of space between the text and the 
wrap object. You can enter a positive or negative value.
• Invert Wrap: Wraps the text on the inside of the wrap object 
instead of around it.
5. When you’ve finished making your selections, click OK.
If you want to change the text wrap at a later point, select the object and
choose Object➪Text Wrap➪Text Wrap Options. Make your changes and 
click OK.
If you want to unwrap text from an object, select the wrap object and choose
Object➪Text Wrap➪Release.

Outlining text
Illustrator gives you the opportunity to change text into outlines or artwork.
Basically, you change the text into an object, so you can no longer edit that
text by typing. The plus side is that it saves you the trouble of sending fonts
to everyone who wants to use the file. Turning text into outlines makes it
appear as though your text was created with the Pen tool. You want to use
this tool when creating logos that will be used frequently by other people or
artwork that you may not have control over.
To turn text into an outline, follow these steps:
1. Type some text on your page.
For this example, just type a word (say, your name) and make sure that
the font size is at least 36 pts. You want to have it large enough to see
the effect of outlining it.
2. Switch to the Selection tool and choose Type➪Create Outlines.
You can also use the keyboard command Ctrl+Shift+O (Ô+Shift+O on 
a Mac).
The text is now grouped together in outline form.
3. If you’re being creative, or just particular, and want to move individ-
ual letters, use the Group Select tool or choose Object➪Ungroup to
separate the letters, as shown in Figure 6-8.
When you convert type to outlines, the type loses its hints. Hints are the
instructions built into fonts to adjust their shape so that your system dis-
plays or prints them in the best way based on the size. Without hints, letters
like lowercase e or a might fill in as the letter forms are reduced in size.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in

Working with Type
501
Make sure that the text is the approximate size that it might be used at
before creating outlines. Because the text loses the hints, try not to create
outlines on text smaller than 10 pts.
Putting text on a path, in a closed 
shape, or on the path of a shape
Wow — that’s some heading, huh? You’ve probably seen text following a
swirly path or inside some shape. Maybe you think accomplishing such a
task is too intimidating to even attempt. In this section, we show you just
how easy these things are! There are Type tools dedicated to putting type 
on a path or a shape (refer to Figure 6-1), but we think you’ll find that the 
key modifiers we show you in this section are easier to use.
Creating text on a path
Follow these steps to put type on a path:
1. Create a path using the Pen, Line, or Pencil tool.
Don’t worry if it has a stroke or fill applied.
2. Select the Type tool and simply cross over the start of the path.
3. Look for an I-bar with a squiggle to appear (it indicates that the text
will run along the path) and click.
The stroke and fill of the path immediately change to None.
4. Start typing, and the text runs on the path.
5. To reposition where the text falls on the path, choose Window➪
Type➪Paragraph and change the alignment in the Paragraph panel.
Alternatively, switch to the Selection tool and drag the I-bar that
appears, as shown in Figure 6-9, to move the text freehand.
Figure 6-8:

shapes
when

outlines.

Working with Type
502
Flip the text to the other side of a path by clicking and dragging the I-bar
under or over the path.
Creating text in a closed shape
Putting text inside a shape can add spunk to a layout. This feature allows
you to custom-create a closed shape with the shape tools or the Pen tool
and flow text into it. Follow these steps to add text inside a shape:
1. Create a closed shape — a circle or oval, for example.
2. Select the Type tool and cross over the closed shape.
3. When you see the I-bar swell or become rounded, click inside the
shape.
4. Start typing, and the text is contained inside the shape.
Text on the path of a closed shape
Perhaps you want text to run around the edge of a shape instead of inside it.
Follow these steps to have text created on the path of a closed shape:
1. Create a closed shape, such as a circle.
2. Select the Type tool and cross over the path of the circle.
3. Don’t click when you see the I-bar swell up; hold down the Alt (Option
on a Mac) key instead.
The icon now changes into the squiggle I-bar that you see when creating
text on a path.
4. When the squiggle line appears, click.
5. Start typing, and the text flows around the path of the shape, as
shown in Figure 6-10.

Assigning Font Styles
503
To change the origin of the text or move it around, use the alignment
options in the Paragraph panel or switch to the Selection tool and drag
the I-bar to a new location on the path.
You can drag the I-bar in and out of the shape to flip the text so that it
appears on the outside or inside of the path.
Assigning Font Styles
After you have text on your page, you’ll often want to change it to be more
interesting than the typical 12-pt Times font. Formatting text in Illustrator
isn’t only simple, but you can do it multiple ways. In the following list, we
name and define some basic type components (see Figure 6-11):
✦Font: A complete set of characters, letters, and symbols of a particular
typeface design.
✦X height: The height of type, based on the height of the small x in that
type family.
✦Kerning: The space between two letters. Often used for letters in larger
type that need to be pulled closer together, like “W i.” Kern a little to get
the i to slide in a little closer to the W, maybe even going into the space
that the W takes, as shown in Figure 6-12. Kerning doesn’t distort the
text; it only increases or decreases the space between two letters.

✦Tracking: The space between multiple letters. Designers like to use this
technique to spread out words by increasing the space between letters.
Adjusting the tracking doesn’t distort text; it increases or decreases the
space between the letters, as shown in Figure 6-13.
Pretty good tracking and kerning has already been determined in most
fonts. You don’t need to bother with these settings unless you’re trying
to tweak the text for a more customized look.
✦Baseline: The line that type sits on. The baseline doesn’t include
descenders, type that extends down, like lowercase y and g. You adjust
the baseline for trademark signs or mathematical formulas, as shown in
Figure 6-14.

Using the Character Panel
To visualize changes that you’re making to text and to see characteristics
that are already selected, choose Window➪Type➪Character or press Ctrl+T,
which brings up the Character panel. Click the triangle in the upper-right
corner to see a panel menu of additional options. Choose Show Options, and
additional type attributes appear, such as baseline shift, underline, and
strikethrough.

Using the Character Panel
506
Pressing Ctrl+T is a toggle switch to either show or hide the Character panel.
If you don’t see the Character panel appear at first, you may have hidden it
by pressing the keyboard shortcut. Just try it again.
The following list explains the options in the Character panel (see Figure 6-15):
✦Font: Pick the font that you want to use from this drop-down list.
In this version, you can select the font name in the Character panel or
control panel and press the up or down arrow key to automatically
switch to the next font above or below on the font list. Do this while you
have text selected to see the text change live!
✦Set Font Style: Pick the style (for example, bold, italic, or bold italic)
from this drop-down list. The choices here are limited by the fonts that
you have loaded. In other words, if you have only Times regular loaded
in your system, you won’t have the choice to bold or italicize it.
✦Type Size: Choose the size of the type in this combo box. Average read-
able type is 12 pt; headlines can vary from 18 pts and up.
✦Leading: Select how much space you want between the lines of text in
this combo box. Illustrator uses the professional typesetting method of
including the type size in the total leading. In other words, if you have 12
pt and want it double-spaced, set the leading at 24 pts.
✦Kerning: Use this combo box by placing the cursor between two letters.
Increase the amount by clicking the up arrow or by typing in a value to
push the letters further apart from each other; decrease the spacing
between the letters by typing in a lower value, even negative numbers,
or by clicking the down arrow.
✦Tracking: Use the Tracking combo box by selecting multiple letters and
increasing or decreasing the space between all of them at once by click-
ing the up or down arrows or by typing in a positive or negative value.
✦Horizontal Scale: Distorts the selected text by stretching it horizontally.
Enter a positive number to increase the size of the letters; enter a nega-
tive number to decrease the size.
✦Vertical Scale: Distorts the selected text vertically. Enter a positive
number to increase the size of the letters; enter a negative number to
decrease the size.
Using horizontal or vertical scaling to make text look like condensed
type often doesn’t give good results. When you distort text, the nice
thick and thin characteristics of the typeface also become distorted and
can produce weird effects.
✦Baseline Shift: Use baseline shift for trademark signs and mathematical
formulas that require selected letters to be moved above or below the
baseline.

✦Character Rotation: Rotate just the selected text by entering an angle in
this text field or by clicking the up or down arrows.
✦Rotate: Choose to rotate your selected text on any angle.
✦Underline and Strikethrough: Finally! This simple text attribute was
noticeably missing from previous versions, but now a type style you can
choose.
✦Language: Choose a language from this drop-down list. Note: The lan-
guage you specify here is used by Illustrator’s spell checker and hyphen-
ation feature. We discuss these features in the later section, “Text
Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency.”
Using the Control Panel
Try and get used to using the control panel to quickly access your type tools
and type panels. Note in Figure 6-16 that, when you have active text, hyper-
linked text buttons allow you to quickly access panels, such as the Character
and Paragraph panels. You can also use this control panel as a quick and
easy way to select fonts, size, alignment, color, and transparency.

Using the Paragraph Panel
508
Using the Paragraph Panel
Access the Paragraph panel quickly by clicking the Paragraph hyperlink in 
the control panel or by choosing Window➪Type➪Paragraph. In this panel are
all the attributes that apply to an entire paragraph, including alignment and
indents, which we discuss in this section, and also hyphenation, which we dis-
cuss later in this chapter. For example, you can’t flush left one word in a para-
graph. When you click the Flush Left button, the entire paragraph flushes left.
To see additional options in the Paragraph panel, click the triangle in the
upper-right of the panel (the panel menu) and choose Show Options.
Alignment
You can choose any of the following alignment methods by choosing the
appropriate button on the Paragraph panel:
✦Flush Left: All text is flush to the left with a ragged edge on the right.
This is the most common way to align text.
✦Center: All text is centered.
✦Flush Right: All text is flush to the right and ragged on the left.
✦Justify With The Last Line Aligned Left: Right and left edges are both
straight, with the last line left-aligned.
✦Justify With The Last Line Aligned Center: Right and left edges are
both straight, with the last line centered.
✦Justify With The Last Line Aligned Right: Right and left edges are both
straight, with the last line right-aligned.
✦Justify All Lines: This method is called forced justification, where the
last line is stretched the entire column width, no matter how short it is.
This alignment is used in many publications, but it can create some
awful results.
Indents
You can choose from the following methods of indentation:
✦First Line Indent: Indents the first line of every paragraph. In other
words, every time you press the Enter (Return on a Mac) key, this spac-
ing is created.
To avoid first-line indents and space after from occurring, say if you just
want to break a line in a specific place, create a line break or soft return
by pressing Shift+Enter (Shift+Return on a Mac).

✦Right Indent: Indents from the right side of the column of text.
✦Left Indent: Indents from the left side of the column of text.
Use the Eyedropper tool to copy the character, paragraph, fill, and stroke
attributes. Select the text that you want to, select the Eyedropper tool, and
click once on the text with the attributes you want to apply to the selected
text.
By default, the Eyedropper affects all attributes of a type selection, including
appearance attributes. To customize the attributes affected by these tools,
double-click the Eyedropper tool to open the Eyedropper dialog box.
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
After you have text in an Illustrator document, you may need to perform 
various tasks within that text, such as searching for a word to replace with
another word, checking your spelling and grammar, saving and creating your
own styles, or changing the case of a block of text. You’re in luck, because
Illustrator provides various text utilities that enable you to easily and effi-
ciently perform all these otherwise tedious tasks. In this section, we give you
a quick tour of these utilities.
Find And Replace
Generally, artwork created in Illustrator isn’t text heavy, but the fact that
Illustrator has a Find And Replace feature can be a huge help. Use the Find
And Replace dialog box (choose Edit➪Find And Replace) to search for words
that need to be changed, such as changing Smyth to Smith, or to locate
items that may be difficult to find otherwise. This feature works pretty much
like all other search and Replace methods.
Spell checker
Can you believe there was a time when Illustrator didn’t have a spell checker?
Thankfully, it does now — and its simple design makes it easy to use.
To use the spell checker, choose Edit➪Check Spelling, and then click the
Start button in the dialog box that appears. The spell checker works much
like the spell checker in Microsoft Word or other popular applications: When
a misspelled word is found, you’re offered a list of Replacements. You can
either choose to fix that instance, all instances, ignore the misspelling, or
add your word to the dictionary.
If you click the arrow to the left of Options, you can set other specifications,
such as whether you want to look for letter case issues or have the spell
checker note repeated words.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
510
Note: The spell checker uses whatever language you specify in the Character
panel. We discuss this panel in the earlier section, “Using the Character
Panel.”
If you work in a specialized industry that uses loads of custom words, save
yourself time by choosing Edit➪Edit Custom Dictionary and then add your
own words. We recommend that you do so before you’re ready to spell
check a document so that the spell checker doesn’t flag the custom words
later (which slows you down).
The Hyphenation feature
Nothing is worse than severely hyphenated copy. Most designers either use
hyphenation as little as possible or avoid it altogether by turning off the
Hyphenation feature.
Here are a few things that you should know about customizing your hyphen-
ation settings if you decide to use this feature:
✦Turning the Hyphenation feature on/off: Activate or deactivate the fea-
ture in the Hyphenation dialog box (see Figure 6-17); access this dialog
box by choosing Window➪Type➪Paragraph, clicking the arrow in the
upper-right of the Paragraph panel to access the panel menu, and then
choosing Hyphenation from the list of options that appears. If you’re not
going to use the Hyphenation feature, turn it off by deselecting the
Hyphenation check box at the top of the Hyphenation dialog box.
✦Setting specifications in the Hyphenation dialog box: Set specifications
in the dialog box that determine the length of words to hyphenate, how
many hyphens should be used in a single document, whether to hyphen-
ate capitalized words, and how words should be hyphenated. The Before
Last setting is useful, for example, if you don’t want to have a word such
Figure 6-17:
Customizing
hyphenation
settings.

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in
Illustrator
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
511
as “liquidated” hyphenated as “liquidat-ed.” Type 3 in the Before Last
text field, and Illustrator won’t hyphenate words if it leaves only two 
letters on the next line.
✦Hyphenation Limit and Hyphenation Zone: They’re not diets or worlds
in another dimension. The Hyphenation Limit setting enables you to
limit the number of hyphens in a row. So, for example, type 2 in the
Hyphenation Limit text field so that there are never more than two
hyphenated words in a row. The Hyphenation Zone text field enables
you to set up an area of hyphenation based upon a measurement. For
example, you can specify 1 inch to allow for only one hyphenation every
inch. You can also use the slider to determine whether you want better
spacing or fewer hyphens. This slider works only with the Single-line
composer (the default). 
The Find Font feature
If you work in production, you’ll love the Find Font feature, which enables
you to list all the fonts in a file that contains text and then search for and
Replace fonts (including the font’s type style) by name. You do so from the
Find Font dialog box (see Figure 6-18), accessed by choosing Type➪
Find Font. Select the font that you want to Replace from the Fonts in
Document list. Next, select a font from the Replace with Font From list. 
Note that the font must already appear in the document. Click the Change
button to Replace the font (or click the Change All button to Replace all
instances of the font) and then click OK. That’s it!
Figure 6-18:
Use the Find
Font dialog
box to find
and replace

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
512
This cool feature enables you to Replace fonts with fonts from the current
working document or from your entire system. Select System from the
Replace with Font From drop-down list to choose from all the fonts loaded in
your system.
The Change Case feature
Doesn’t it drive you crazy when you type an entire paragraph before discover-
ing that you somehow pressed the Caps Lock key? Fix it fast by selecting the
text, choosing Type➪Change Case, and then choosing one of the following:
✦Uppercase: Makes the selected text all uppercase.
✦Lowercase: Makes the selected text all lowercase.
✦Title Case: Capitalizes the first letter in each word.
✦Sentence Case: Capitalizes just the first letter in the selected
sentence(s).
In Illustrator CS3, you use the same type engine used by InDesign for high-
quality text control. As a default, you’re working in what is referred to as a
single-line composer. Select Single or Every Line composer from the
Paragraph panel menu.
The different options include
✦Single-Line Composer: Useful if you prefer to have manual control over
how lines break. In fact, this method had been in place in the past. The
single-line composer doesn’t take the entire paragraph into considera-
tion when expanding letter space and word spacing, so justified text can
sometimes look odd in its entire form (see Figure 6-19).

Single-Line
Composer

Book IV
Chapter 6

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
513
✦Every-Line Composer: The every-line composer is a very professional
way of setting text; many factors are taken into account as far as spacing
is concerned, and spacing is based on the entire paragraph. Using this
method, you see few spacing issues that create strange effects, such as
the ones on the left of Figure 6-19.
Text styles
A text style is a saved set of text attributes, such as font, size, and so on.
Creating text styles keeps you consistent and saves you time by enabling you
to efficiently implement changes in one step instead of having to select the
text attributes for each instance of that style of text (say a heading or caption).
So when you’re finally happy with the way your headlines appear and the
body copy looks or when your boss asks whether the body copy can be a
smidgen smaller (okay . . . a smidgen?), you can confidently answer, “Sure!”
If you’ve created styles, changing a text attribute is simple. What’s more, the
change is applied at once to all text that uses that style. Otherwise, you’d
have to make the attribute change to every occurrence of body text, which
could take a long time if your text is spread out.
Illustrator offers two types of text styles:
✦Character styles: Saves attributes for individual selected text. If you
want just the word “New” in a line of text to be red 20 pt Arial, you can
save it as a character style sheet. Then, when you apply it, the attributes
apply only to the selected text (and not the entire line or paragraph).
✦Paragraph styles: Saves attributes for an entire paragraph. A span of
text is considered a paragraph until it reaches a hard return or para-
graph break. Note that pressing Shift+Enter (Shift+Return on a Mac) is
considered a soft return, and paragraph styles will continue to apply
beyond the soft return.
There are many ways to create character and paragraph styles, but we show
you the easiest and most direct methods.
Creating character styles
Create a character style when you want individual sections of text to be
treated differently from other text in the paragraph. So instead of manually
applying a style over and over again, you create and implement a character
style. To do so, open a document containing text and follow these steps:
1. Set up text with the text attributes you want included in the 
character style in the Character and Paragraph panels and then
choose Window➪Type➪Character Styles.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
514
The Character Styles panel opens.
2. Select the text from Step 1 and Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) the
New Style button (dog-eared page icon) at the bottom of the Character
Styles panel.
3. In the Character Styles Options dialog box that appears, name your
style and click OK.
Illustrator records what attributes have already been applied to the
selected text and builds a style for them.
4. Now create another text area by choosing Select➪Deselect and using
the Type tool to drag out a new text area.
We discuss using the Type tool in the earlier section, “Creating text areas.”
5. Change the font and size to something dramatically different from
your saved style and type some text.
6. Select some (not all) of the new text and then Alt+click (Option+click
on a Mac) the style name in the Character Styles panel.
You Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) to eliminate any attributes that
weren’t a part of the saved style. The attributes of the saved character
style are applied to the selected text.
When creating a new panel item (any panel) in Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, or
Photoshop, we recommend that you get in the habit of Alt+clicking (Option+
clicking on a Mac) the New Style button. This habit allows you to name the
item (style, layer, swatch, and so on) while adding it to the panel.
Creating a paragraph style
Paragraph styles include attributes that are applied to an entire paragraph.
What constitutes a paragraph is all text that falls before a hard return (you
create a hard return when you press Enter [Return on a Mac]), so this could
be one line of text for a headline or ten lines in a body text paragraph.
To create a paragraph style, open a document that contains text or open a
new document and add text to it; then follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Type➪Paragraph Styles to open the Paragraph
Styles panel.
2. Find a paragraph of text that has the same text attributes throughout it
and put your cursor anywhere in that paragraph.
You don’t even have to select the whole paragraph!

Book IV
Chapter 6
Using Type in
Illustrator
Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
515
3. Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) the Create New Style button (the
dog-eared icon at the bottom of the Paragraph panel) to create a new
paragraph style; give your new style a name.
Your new style now appears in the Paragraph Styles panel list of styles.
4. Create a paragraph of text elsewhere in your document and make its
attributes different from the text in Step 2.
5. Put your cursor anywhere in the new paragraph and Alt+click (Option+
click on a Mac) your named style in the Paragraph Styles panel.
The attributes from the style are applied to the entire paragraph.
Updating styles
When you use existing text to build styles, reselect the text and assign the
style. In other words, if you put the cursor in the original text whose attrib-
utes were saved as a style, it doesn’t have a style assigned to it in the Styles
panel. Assign the style by selecting the text or paragraph and clicking the
appropriate style listed in the Styles panel. By doing so, you ensure that any
future updates to that style will apply to that original text, as well as to all
other instances.
To update a style, simply select its name in either the Character or
Paragraph Styles panel. Choose Options from the panel menu, which you
access by clicking the arrow in the upper-right corner of the panel. In the
resulting dialog box (see Figure 6-20), make changes by clicking the main
attribute on the left and then updating the choices on the right. After you 
do so, all tagged styles are updated.
Documents created in older versions of Adobe Illustrator (Version 10 or ear-
lier) contain what is called legacy text, which is text using the older text
engine. When these files are opened, you see a warning dialog box, such as
the one you see in Figure 6-21.
Figure 6-20:
Updating a
paragraph
style.

Text Utilities: Your Key to Efficiency
516
Understand that if you click the Update button, any text on the document
will most likely reflow, causing line breaks, leading, and other spacing to
change.
Click the OK button to update the file after it’s opened to lock down the text.
If necessary, you can use the Type tool to click a selected text area to update
only the contained text. Another Warning dialog box appears that gives you
the opportunity to Update the selected text, copy the Text Object, or cancel
the text tool selection. This method is the best way to see what changes are
occurring so that you can catch any spacing issues right off the bat. See
Figure 6-22 for samples of the three options in the warning dialog window.
If you choose to Copy the Text Object, you can use the underlying locked
copy to adjust the new text flow to match the old. Throw away the legacy
text layer by clicking and dragging it to the trash icon in the Layers panel, or
click on the visibility Eye icon to the left of the Legacy Text layer to hide it
when you are finished.

 Rearranging, hiding, and locking objects
 Masking objects
You can know all the neat special effects in Illustrator, but if you don’t
have a strong foundation on the organization of your artwork, you can
fall flat on your face when it comes to getting some features to work. In this
chapter, we focus on a few tricks of the trade.
Setting Ruler Increments
Using rulers to help you accurately place objects in your illustration sounds
pretty simple (and it is), but not knowing how to effectively use the rulers in
Illustrator can drive you over the edge.
To view rulers in Illustrator, choose View➪Show Rulers or press Ctrl+R
(Ô+R on a Mac). When the rulers appear, they’ll be in the default setting 
of points (or whatever measurement increment was last set up in the 
preferences).
You can change the rulers’ increments to the measurement system that you
prefer in the following ways:
✦Create a new document and select your preferred measurement units in
the New Document dialog box.
✦Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) the horizontal or vertical ruler and pick
a measurement increment.
✦Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Units And Display Performance (Illustrator➪
Preferences➪Units And Display Performance on a Mac) to bring up the
Preferences dialog box.

Using Guides
518
Be very careful with this dialog box. Change ruler units only by using the
General tab of the Preferences dialog box. If you change the units of
measurement in the Stroke and Type tabs, you can end up with 12-inch
type instead of that dainty 12-point type you were expecting! Remember:
Setting the General Preferences changes the preferences for all future
documents.
✦Choose File➪Document Setup to change measurement units only for the
document that you’re working on.
Using Guides
Guides can make producing accurate illustrations much easier, and they can
even go away when you’re done with them. You can use two kinds of guides
in Illustrator:
✦Ruler guides: Straight-line guides that are created by clicking the ruler
and dragging out to the artboard.
✦Custom guides: Guides created from Illustrator objects, such as shapes
or paths. Great for copying the exact angle of a path and replicating it, as
shown in Figure 7-1.
Creating a ruler guide
A ruler guide is the easiest guide to create. Click anywhere on the vertical or
horizontal ruler and drag it to the artboard to create a ruler guide, as shown
in Figure 7-2. By default, the horizontal ruler creates horizontal guides (no
kidding), and the vertical ruler creates vertical guides. You can Alt+drag
(Option+drag on a Mac) to change the orientation of the guide. The vertical
ruler then creates a horizontal guide, and the horizontal ruler then creates a
vertical guide.

Book IV
Chapter 7
Organizing Your

Using the Transform Panel for Placement
519
Creating a custom guide
Create a custom guide by selecting a path or shape and choosing View➪
Guides➪Make Guides. Whatever is selected turns into a nonprinting guide.
Changing a path into a guide isn’t permanent. Choose View➪Guides➪
Release Guides to turn guides back into paths.
Using the Transform Panel for Placement
Placing shapes and paths precisely where you want them can be difficult for
those with even the most steady of hands. Save yourself aggravation by
using the Transform panel to perform such tasks as scaling and rotating
objects. On a more practical note, however, the Transform panel also
enables you to type in x, y coordinates. This way, you can position your
objects exactly where you want them.
In Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, the Reference Point Indicator icon is on the
left side of the Transform panel. Click the handle of the Reference Point
Indicator icon to change the point of reference. If you want to measure from
the upper-left corner, click the indicator on the handle in the upper left.
Want to know exactly where the center of an object is? Click the center point
in the indicator. The point of reference is the spot on the object that falls at
the x, y coordinates:
✦X coordinate: Sets the placement of the selected object from left to
right.
✦Y coordinate: Sets the placement of the selected object from top to
bottom.
Did you ever notice that Adobe Illustrator, which is based on PostScript, con-
siders the lower-left corner the zero point? This can be confusing at first.
You can change the ruler origin if it really drives you crazy by following the
steps in the next section.
Figure 7-2:

Changing the Ruler Origin
520
Changing the Ruler Origin
In Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop, you can change your ruler
origin. This action helps define your measuring starting point and defines
the part of the page that will print if you use manual tiling.
To change the ruler origin, follow these steps:
1. Move the pointer to the upper-left corner of the rulers where the
rulers intersect, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2. Drag the pointer to where you want the new ruler origin.
As you drag, a cross hair in the window and in the rulers indicates
where the new ruler origin will be placed.
You can put the original ruler origin back in place by double-clicking the
ruler intersection.
Thinking about Object Arrangement
Just like stacking paper on your desk, new objects in Illustrator are placed
on top of the existing objects. Change this order by using the Object➪
Arrange choices.
The easiest choices are to bring an object to the front or send it to the back.
The results of sending forward or backward can be a little unnerving if you
don’t know exactly in what order objects were created. Figure 7-4 shows an
illustration that we rearranged using four of the available choices. Figure 7-5
shows the result of each choice.

Hiding Objects
521
To change the stacking order, select the object(s) whose placement you
want to change and then choose one of the following:
✦Object➪Arrange➪Bring To Front: Brings the selected object(s) to the
top of the painting order. In Figure 7-5a, the square is brought in front by
using the Bring To Front command.
✦Object➪Arrange➪Bring Forward: Brings the selected object(s) in front
of the object created just before it, or one level closer to the front. In
Figure 7-5b, the square is pulled up in front of the circle with the Bring
Forward command.
✦Object➪Arrange➪Send Backward: Moves the selected object(s) so that
it falls under the object created just before it, or one level further to the
back. In Figure 6-5c, the triangle is sent backward so that it’s just under
the circle.
✦Object➪Arrange➪Send To Back: Pushes the selected object(s) to the
bottom of the painting order. In Figure 7-5d, the triangle is placed on the
bottom using the Send To Back command.
Hiding Objects
Seasoned Illustrator users love the Hide command. Use it when the object
that you want to select is stuck behind something else, or when you need to
select one object and another keeps activating instead.

Hiding Objects
522
A good opportunity to use the Hide command is when you’re creating text
inside a shape. In Chapter 6 of this mini-book, we show you that as soon as
you turn a shape into a text area, the fill and stroke attributes turn into
None. Follow these steps to hide a shape:
1. Create a shape.
For this example, we created a circle.
2. Click the Fill color box at the bottom of the Illustrator toolbox and
then choose Window➪Swatches.
The Swatches panel appears.
3. In the panel, choose a color for the fill.
We’ve chosen yellow here. The stroke doesn’t matter; we’ve set it 
to None.
When changing your shape into a text area, the color you’ve chosen is
going to disappear. To have the colored shape remain, you have to cheat
the system.
4. With your colored shape selected, choose Edit➪Copy; alternatively,
you can press Ctrl+C (Ô+C on a Mac).
This step makes a copy of your shape.
5. Choose Edit➪Paste In Back or press Ctrl+B (Ô+B on a Mac).
This step puts a copy of your shape exactly in back of the original.
6. Choose Object➪Hide or press Ctrl+3 (Ô+3 on a Mac).
The copy of the shape is now hidden; what you see is your original
shape.
7. Switch to the Type tool by selecting the tool in the toolbox or 
pressing T.
8. With the cursor, cross over the edge of the shape to change it to the
Area Type tool.
The Area Type tool enables you to type into a shape.
9. When you see the type insertion cursor swell up (as shown in 
Figure 7-6), click the edge of the shape.
The insertion point is now blinking inside the shape, and the fill and
stroke attributes of the shape have been changed to none.

10. Type some text (see Figure 7-7).
11. When you’re finished entering text, choose Object➪Show All or press
Ctrl+Alt+3 (Ô+Option+3 on a Mac).
Your colored shape reappears with the text in the middle of it (see
Figure 7-8).

Locking Objects
524
Use the Hide command anytime you want to tuck something away for later use.
We promise that anything hidden in Illustrator won’t be lost. Just use the Show
All command, and any hidden objects are revealed, exactly where you left
them. Too bad the Show All command can’t reveal where you left your car keys!
Locking Objects
Locking items is handy when you’re building an illustration. Not only does the
Lock command lock down objects that you don’t want to make changes to, but
it also drives anyone who tries to edit your files crazy! In fact, we mention lock-
ing mainly to help preserve your sanity. There will be many times you need
to make simple adjustments to another designer’s artwork and you just can’t,
unless the objects are first unlocked. You can lock and unlock objects as follows:
✦Lock an object: Choose Object➪Lock or press Ctrl+2 (Ô+2 on a Mac) to
lock an object so that you can’t select it, move it, or change its attributes.
✦Unlock an object: Choose Object➪Unlock All or press Ctrl+Alt+2
(Ô+Option+2 on a Mac). Then you can make changes to it.
You can also lock and hide objects with layers. See Chapter 8 in this mini-
book for more information about using layers.
Creating a Clipping Mask
Creating a clipping mask may sound complex, but it’s actually easy and brings
together some of the items that we talk about in this chapter, such as arrang-
ing objects. A clipping mask allows a topmost object to define the selected
shapes underneath it. It’s similar to you cutting a hole in a piece of paper
and peering through it to the objects below, except that with a clipping
mask, the area around the defining shape is transparent (see Figure 7-9).
Figure 7-9:
Examples of

Chapter 7
Organizing Your

Creating a Clipping Mask
525
You may remember what a film mask looks like. It’s black to block out the
picture and clear where you want to view an image, as shown in Figure 7-10.
The clipping mask feature uses the same principal as the conventional film
mask, but the clipping mask is a whole lot easier to create and modify. To
create a clipping mask, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Place to place an image.
Masks work with objects created in Illustrator, as well as those placed
(scanned or otherwise imported into Illustrator), but an example using a
single placed image is less complicated.
2. Create the item that you want to use as a mask by creating a shape or
a closed path with the Pen tool.
For example, in Figure 7-11, the circle is the mask. (The photo underneath
it is the placed image from Step 1.) The circle is placed where the mask
will be created. It doesn’t matter what the shape’s color, fill, and stroke
are because these automatically change to None when you create a mask.
Note: When creating a clipping mask, make sure that the object to be
used as a mask is a closed shape and is at the top of the stacking order.

that is to
become the

3. Using the Selection tool, select the placed image and the shape.
Shift+click to add an object to the selection.
4. Choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.
Ta-da! The clipping mask is created. The masked items are grouped
together, but you can use the Direct Selection tool to move around the
image or the mask individually.
5. To turn off the clipping mask, choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Release.
You can also use text as a mask. Just type a word, make sure that it is posi-
tioned over an image or other Illustrator object(s), select both the text and
the object, and then choose Object➪Clipping Mask➪Make.

Chapter 8: Using Layers
In This Chapter
 Working with layers
 Putting something on a layer
 Locking and putting away layers
T
his chapter shows you just how simple it is to use layers and how help-
ful layers can be when you’re producing complex artwork. Layers are
similar to clear pages stacked on top of your artwork: You can place content
(text, shapes, and so on) on a layer, lift up a layer, remove a layer, hide and
show layers, or lock a layer so that you can’t edit the content on it. Layers
are an incredible feature that can help you:
✦Organize the painting (stacking) order of objects.
✦Activate objects that would otherwise be difficult to select with the
Selection or Direct Selection tool.
✦Lock items that you don’t want to reposition or change.
✦Hide items until you need them.
✦Repurpose objects for artwork variations. For example, business cards
use the same logo and company address, but the name and contact
information change for each person. In this case, placing the logo and
company address on one layer and the person’s name and contact infor-
mation on another layer makes it easy to create a new business card by
just changing the name of the person.
Many Illustrator users don’t take advantage of layers. Maybe these users
don’t understand the basic functions of layers, or maybe they think that
layers are much more complicated than they really are. By reading this
chapter, you’ll be able to take advantage of layers in Illustrator.
Unlike in Photoshop, layers in Illustrator don’t add an incredible amount of
size to the file.

Creating New Layers
528
Creating New Layers
When you create a new Illustrator document, you automatically have one
layer to start with. To understand how layers work, create a new file and
then follow these steps to create new layers and put objects on them:
1. If the Layers panel isn’t already visible, choose Window➪Layers.
The Layers panel appears. In Illustrator CS3, you see new layer color
bars to help identify selected objects and the layer they’re on, as shown
in Figure 8-1.
2. Create a shape anywhere on the artboard.
It doesn’t matter what size the shape is, but make sure that it has a 
colored fill so that you can see it easily. For this example, we created a
rectangle.
3. Click the Fill pop-up menu in the control panel and select any color
for the shape, as shown in Figure 8-2.

The blue handle color that appears on the active shape matches the
blue-color bar you see on the left side of the layer name and the small
selection square to the right of the radio button. The small selection
square on the right disappears if you choose Select➪Deselect. You use
that square to see what layer a selected object is on.
Also, notice now that you’ve added a shape to this layer, and an arrow
appears to the left of the layer name. This arrow indicates that you now
have a sublayer, which is essentially a layer within a layer. Click the
arrow to expand the layer and show any sublayers nested under it; sub-
layers are automatically created as you add objects, which helps when
you’re trying to make difficult selections.
4. To make a new layer, Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) the Create
New Layer button at the bottom of the Layers panel.
The Layer Options window appears (see Figure 8-3), and you can use it
to name a layer and change the selection color. You don’t have to hold
down the Alt or Option key when making a new layer, but if you don’t,
you won’t have the opportunity to name the layer as you create it.
5. Enter a name for the new layer in the Name text field and click OK.
In this case, we used the name circle because it’s the shape that we add
in the next step.
A new layer is added to the top of the stack in the Layers panel.
6. Make a shape on the new layer and overlap the shape you created in
Step 2 (see Figure 8-4).
For this example, we created a circle.
7. Change the fill color for your new shape.
Check out the selection handles? They change to a different color, indi-
cating that you’re on a different layer. The different colors of the handles
are for organizational purposes only and don’t print.
Figure 8-3:

8. Just to be different, this time choose New Layer from the panel menu.
The Layer Options dialog box appears.
9. (Optional) In the Layer Options dialog box, change the color of the
selection handles by selecting an option from the Color drop-down list.
You can also hide or lock the contents of the layer.
10. Enter a name for this new layer in the Name text field, click OK, and
then create a shape on it.
For this example, we named the layer “star” and used the Star tool to
create a star.
11. Again, change the fill color of your newest shape so that it’s different
from the other shapes.
12. Use the Selection tool to move the new shape (in our case, the star) so
that it overlaps the others slightly.
13. Rename the original layer (Layer 1) by double-clicking the layer’s
name in the Layers panel, typing a new name, and then pressing Enter
(Return on a Mac).
In our case, it would make sense to rename the original layer as “rectan-
gle” (that’s nice and descriptive). You can open up the Options dialog
box for any existing layer by choosing Options For Layer (Named Layer)
from the panel menu in the Layers panel.
Congratulations! You’ve created new layers and now have a file that you can
use to practice working with layers.
Using Layers for Selections
When you have a selected object on a layer, a color selection square appears
to the right of the named layer. If you click the radio button directly to the
right of the name, all objects are selected on that layer.

Using Layers
Moving and Cloning Objects
531
Sublayers each have their own radio button as well. If you have sublayers
visible, you can use this same technique to select objects that may be buried
behind others.
If you think that you’ll be selecting sublayers frequently, double-click the
default name and type a more descriptive name.
Changing the Layer Stacking Order
In Chapter 7 of this minibook, we tell you about the Object➪Arrange feature
in Illustrator; with layers, this process gets just a little more complicated.
Each layer has its own painting order, the order in which you see the layers.
To move a layer (and thereby change the stacking order of the layers), click
and drag that layer until you see the black insertion line where you want the
layer to be moved.
As you add shapes to a layer, a sublayer is created, and it has its own little
stacking order that is separate from other layers. In other words, if you
choose to send an object to the back, and it’s on the top layer, it will only 
go to the back of that layer, and still be in front of any objects on layers
beneath.
Understanding how the stacking order affects the illustration is probably the
most confusing part about layers. Just remember that for an object to
appear behind everything else, it has to be on the bottom layer (and at the
bottom of all the objects in that bottom layer); for an object to appear in
front of everything else, it has to be on the topmost layer.
Moving and Cloning Objects
To move a selected object from one layer to another, click the small color
selection square to the right of the layer’s radio button, drag it to the target
layer, and release. That’s all there is to moving an object from one layer to
another.
You can also clone items — that is, make a copy of it as you move the copy
to another layer. Clone an object by Alt+dragging (Option+dragging on a
Mac) the color selection square to another layer. A plus sign appears as you
drag (so you know that you’re making a clone of the object). Release when
you get to the cloned object’s target layer.

Hiding Layers
532
Hiding Layers
On the Layers panel, notice that to the left of each layer is an eye icon. This
is a visibility toggle button. Simply clicking this icon hides the layer (the 
eye disappears, denoting that this layer is hidden). Click the empty square
(where the eye icon was) to show the layer again.
Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) an eye icon to hide all layers but the one
you click; Alt+click again on the eye icon to show all the layers again.
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on a Mac) the eye icon to turn just the selected layer into
Outline view mode. In Outline view, all you see are the outlines of the art-
work with no stroke widths or fill colors. The rest of your artwork remains in
Preview mode, with strokes and fills visible. This technique is pretty tricky
and helpful when you’re looking for stray points or need to close paths.
Ctrl+click (Ô+click on a Mac) back on the eye icon to return the layer to
Preview mode.
Locking Layers
Lock layers by clicking the empty square to the right of the Visibility (eye)
icon. A padlock icon appears so that you know the layer is now locked.
Locking a layer prevents you from making changes to the objects on that
layer. Click the padlock to unlock the layer.

his chapter is all about making your brilliant illustrations come alive
with color. Here, we show you how to create new and edit existing
colors, save custom colors that you create, create and use patterns and gra-
dients, and even apply color attributes to many different shapes.
Choosing a Color Mode
Every time that you create a new file, you choose a profile. This profile
determines, among other things, which color mode your document will be
created in. Typically, anything related to Web, mobile, and video is in RGB
mode, and the print profile is in CMYK. You can also simply choose Basic
CMYK or Basic RGB. Here are the differences between the color modes:
✦CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black): This mode is used if you’re
taking your illustration to a professional printer and the files will be sep-
arated into cyan, magenta, yellow, and black plates for printing.
✦RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Use this mode if your final destination is the
Web, mobile device, video, color copier or desktop printer, or screen
presentation.

Using the Swatches Panel
534
The decision that you make affects the premade swatches, brushes, styles,
and a slew of other choices in Adobe Illustrator. This all helps you to avoid
sending an RGB color to a print shop. Ever see how that turns out? If your
prepress person doesn’t catch that the file isn’t CMYK and sends an RGB file
as separations (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) to a printer, you can end
up with a black blob instead of your beautiful illustration.
You can change the color mode at any time without losing information by
choosing File➪Document Color Mode.
Using the Swatches Panel
Accessing color from the control panel is probably the easiest way to make
color choices, as using the Fill and Stroke drop-down menus allow you to
quickly access the Swatches palette, as shown in Figure 9-1, and at the same
time make sure that the color is actually applying to either the fill or stroke.
How many times have you mixed up colors and assigned the stroke color to
the fill or vice versa?
You can also access the Swatches panel, which you open by choosing
Window➪Swatches. Although limited in choice, its basic colors, patterns,
and gradients are ready to go. You can use the buttons at the bottom of the
Swatches panel (shown in Figure 9-2) to quickly open color libraries, select
what kinds of colors to view, access Swatch options, create color Groups,
add new swatches, and delete selected swatches.
You may notice some odd color swatches — for example, the cross hair and
the diagonal line.

Applying Color to the Fill and Stroke
535
The cross hair represents the Registration color. Only use this swatch when
creating custom crop marks or printer marks. It looks black, but it’s actually
created from 100 percent of all colors. This way, when artwork is separated,
the crop mark appears on all color separations.
The diagonal line represents None. Use this option if you want no fill or
stroke.
Applying Color to the Fill and Stroke
Illustrator objects are created from fills (the inside) and strokes (border or
path). Look at the bottom of the toolbox for the Fill and Stroke color boxes.
If you’re applying color to the fill, the Fill color box must be forward in the
toolbox. If you’re applying color to the stroke, the Stroke color box must be
forward.
Table 9-1 lists keyboard shortcuts that can be a tremendous help to you
when applying colors to fills and strokes.

Double-click the Fill or Stroke color box
Try this trick: Drag a color from the Swatches panel to the Fill or Stroke
color box. This action applies the color to the color box that you dragged to.
It doesn’t matter which is forward!
To apply a fill color to an existing shape, drag the swatch directly to the
shape. Select a swatch, hold down Alt+Shift+Ctrl (Option+Shift+Ô on a Mac),
and drag a color to a shape to apply that color to the stroke.
Changing the Width and Type of a Stroke
Access the Stroke panel by clicking the Stroke Hyperlink in the control panel.
In the Stroke panel, you can choose caps (the end of a line), joins (the end
points of a path or dash), and the miter limit (the length of a point). The
Stroke panel also enables you to turn a path into a dashed line.
As you can see in Figure 9-3, you can choose, in the Stroke panel options, to
align the stroke on the center (default) of a path, the inside of a path, and
the outside of a path. Figure 9-4 shows the results.
This feature is especially helpful when stroking outlined text. See Figure 9-5
to compare text with the traditional centered stroke, as compared to the
new option for aligning the stroke outside of a path.

You can’t adjust the alignment of a stroke on text unless you change it to
outlines first. Select the Selection tool and choose Type➪Create Outlines to
enable the Align Stroke options.
You can also customize the following aspects of a stroke in the Stroke panel:
✦Cap Options: The endpoints of a path or dash.
• Butt Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines square.
• Round Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines 
semicircular.
• Projecting Cap: Click this button to make the ends of stroked lines
square and extend half the line width beyond the end of the line.
✦Join Options: How corner points appear.
• Miter Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with pointed 
corners.
• Round Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with rounded
corners.
• Bevel Join: Click this button to make stroked lines with squared 
corners.
✦Dashed Lines: Regularly spaced lines, based upon values you set.

To create a dashed line, specify a dash sequence by entering the lengths of
dashes and the gaps between them in the Dash Pattern text fields (see Figure
9-6). The numbers entered are repeated in sequence so that after you’ve set
up the pattern, you don’t need to fill in all the text fields. In other words, if
you want an evenly spaced dashed stroke, just type the same number in 
the first and second text fields, and all dashes and spaces will be the same
length (say, 12 pts). Change that to 12 in the first text field and 24 in the next,
and now you have a larger space between the dashes.
Using the Color Panel
The Color panel (access it by choosing Window➪Color) offers another
method for choosing color. It requires you to custom pick a color using
values on the color ramp. As a default, you see only the color ramp — the
large color well spanning the panel. If you don’t see all the color options,
choose Show Options from the Color panel’s panel menu (click the triangle
in the upper-right corner to access the panel menu).
Ever want to create tints of a CMYK color but aren’t quite sure how to adjust
the individual color sliders? Hold down the Shift key while adjusting the
color slide of any color and watch how all colors move to a relative position
at the same time!
As shown in Figure 9-7, the panel menu offers many other choices. Even
though you may be in the RGB or CMYK color mode, you can still choose to
build colors in Grayscale, RGB, HSB (Hue Saturation Brightness), CMYK, or
Web Safe RGB. Choosing Invert or Complement from the panel menu takes
the selected object and inverses the color or changes it to a complementary
color. You can also choose the Fill and Stroke color boxes in the upper-left
corner of the Color panel.

You see the infamous cube and exclamation point in the Color panels in most
of Adobe’s software. The cube warns you that the color you have selected
isn’t one of the 216 nondithering, Web-safe colors, and the exclamation point
warns you that your color is not within the CMYK print gamut. In other words,
if you see the exclamation point in the Color panel, don’t expect that really
cool electric blue you see on-screen to print correctly — it may print as dark
purple!
Click the cube or exclamation point symbols when you see them to select
the closet color in the Web safe or CMYK color gamut.
Saving Colors
Saving colors not only keeps you consistent, but it makes edits and changes
to colors easier in the future. Any time you build a color, drag it from the
Color panel to the Swatches panel to save it as a color swatch for future use.
You can also select an object that uses the color and click the New Swatch
button at the bottom of the Swatches panel (refer to Figure 9-2 to see this
button). To save a color and name it at the same time, Alt+click (Option+
click on a Mac) the New Swatch icon. The New Swatch dialog box opens,
where you can name and edit the color if you want. By double-clicking a
swatch in the Swatches panel, you can open the options at any time.
A color in the Swatches panel is available only in the document in which it
was created. Read the next section on custom libraries to see how to import
swatches from saved documents.

Saving Colors

Building and using custom libraries
When you save a color in the Swatches panel, you’re essentially saving it to
your own custom library. You can use Swatches panels from one document
to another by using the Libraries feature. Retrieve colors saved in a docu-
ment’s Swatches panel by selecting the Swatch Libraries menu button at 
the bottom of the Swatches window and dragging down to Other Library.
You can also access swatch libraries, including other documents, by choos-
ing Window➪Swatch Libraries➪Other Library. Locate the saved document
and choose Open. A panel appears with the document name, as shown in
Figure 9-8. You can’t edit the colors in this panel. To use the colors in this
panel, double-click a swatch or drag a swatch to your current document’s
Swatches panel.
You can also click the Swatch Libraries button to access color libraries for
Pantone colors, Web colors, and some neat creative colors, such as jewel
tones and metals.
Using the Color Guide and Color Groups
Perhaps you failed at color in art class or just don’t feel that you’re one of
those people who picks colors that look good together. In Illustrator CS3,
you can use the Color Guide to find colors and save them to organized color
groups in your Swatches panel. You can create color schemes based on 23
classic color-harmony rules, such as Complementary, Analogous,
Monochromatic, and Triad, or you can create custom harmony rules.
Sounds complicated, doesn’t it? Fortunately, all you have to do is choose a
base color and then see what variations you come up with according to rules
you choose. Give it a try:
1. Choose Window➪Color Guide.
The Color Guide panel appears, as shown in Figure 9-9.
2. Select a color from your Swatches palette.
Immediately, the Color Guide kicks in to provide you with colors that are
related to your original swatch.

3. Change the Harmony Rules by selecting the Edit Colors button at the
bottom of the Color Guide panel.
The Live Color panel, shown in Figure 9-10, appears.
You could spend days experimenting in the Live Color window, but for
the scope of this book you will delve into changing simple harmony
rules. To do this, click on the Harmony Rules arrow to the right of the
color bar. A drop-down menu appears with many choices as to how you
want colors selected, see Figure 9-11. Choose a Color Harmony.
4. Save your color selection as a color group by clicking the New Color
Group icon.
If you like, you can rename the color group by double-clicking the group
name in the Color Group section of the Live Color window.
5. Click OK.
The Color group is added to the Swatches panel.

You don’t have to go through the Live Color window in order to save a group
of colors. You can Ctrl+click (Ô+Click on a Mac) to select multiple colors and
then click the New Color Group button at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
Adding Pantone colors
If you’re looking for the typical Pantone Matching System-numbered
swatches, click the Swatch Libraries menu button at the bottom of the
Swatches panel. From the drop-down list, choose Color Books and then
Pantone solid coated, or whatever Pantone library you want to access.
Colors for the Pantone numbering system are often referred to as PMS 485,
or PMS 201, or whatever number the color has been designated. You can
locate the numbered swatch by typing the number into the Find text field of
the Pantone panel, as shown in Figure 9-12. When that number’s correspon-
ding color is highlighted in the panel, click it to add it to your Swatches
panel. Many users find it easier to see colored swatches by using the List
View. Choose List View from the panel options menu.

Editing Colors
Edit colors in the Swatches panel by using the Swatch Options dialog box
(shown in Figure 9-13), which you access by double-clicking the color or by
choosing Swatch Options from the Swatches panel menu.
Use the Swatch Options dialog box to
✦Change the color values: Change the values in a color by using the slid-
ers or by typing values into the color text fields. Having the ability to
enter exact color values is especially helpful if you were given a color
build to match. Select the Preview check box to see results as you make
the changes.
✦Use global colors: If you plan on using a color frequently, select the
Global check box. If the Global check box is selected and you use the
swatch throughout the artwork, you only have to change the swatch
options one time, and all instances of that color are updated.

Building and Editing Patterns
544
One important option to note in the Swatch Options dialog box is the Color
Type drop-down list. You have two choices here: Spot Color and Process
Color. What’s the difference?
✦Spot color: A color that isn’t broken down into the CMYK values. Spot
colors are used for 1–2 color print runs or when precise color matching
is important.
Suppose that you’re printing 20,000 catalogs and decide to run only two
colors, red and black. If you pick spot colors, the catalogs have to go
through the press only two times: once for black and once for red. If the
red were a process color, however, it would be created out of a combina-
tion of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, and so the catalogs would
need to go through the press four times in order to build that color. Plus,
if you went to a print service and asked for red, what color would you
get? Fire-engine red, maroon, or a light and delicate pinkish-red? But if
the red you pick is PMS 485, your printer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, can
now print the same color of red on your brochure as the printer doing
your business cards in Woburn, Massachusetts.
✦Process color: A color that is built from four colors (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black). Process colors are used for multicolor jobs.
For example, you’d want to use process colors if you’re sending an ad to
a four-color magazine. The magazine printers certainly want to use the
same inks they’re already running, and using a spot color would require
another run through the presses in addition to the runs for the cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black plates. In this case, you’d take any spot
colors created in corporate logos and such and convert them to 
process colors.
Choose the Spot Colors option from the Swatches panel menu to choose
whether you want Spot colors changed to Lab or CMYK values:
✦Choose Lab to get the best possible CMYK conversion for the actual
spot color when using a color-calibrated workflow.
✦Choose CMYK (default) to get the manufacturer’s standard recommended
conversion of spot colors to process. Results can vary depending upon
printing conditions.
Building and Editing Patterns
Using patterns can be as simple or complicated as you want. If you become
familiar with the basics, you can take off in all sorts of creative directions. To
build a simple pattern, start by creating the artwork that you want to use as

Book IV
Chapter 9
Livening Up
Illustrations 
with Color
Building and Editing Patterns
545
a pattern on your artboard — polka dots, smiley faces, wavy lines, whatever.
Then select all the components of the pattern and drag them to the
Swatches panel. That’s it, you made a pattern! Use the pattern by selecting it
as the fill or stroke of an object.
You can’t use patterns in artwork that is then going to be saved as a pattern.
If you have a pattern in your artwork and try to drag it into the Swatches
panel, Illustrator will kick it back out with no error message. On a good note,
you can drag text right into the Swatches panel to become a pattern.
You can update patterns that you created or patterns that already reside in
the Swatches panel. To edit an existing pattern, follow these steps:
1. Click the pattern swatch in the Swatches panel and drag it to the 
artboard.
2. Deselect the pattern and use the Direct Selection tool to change its
colors or shapes or whatever.
Keep making changes until you’re happy with the result.
3. To update the pattern with your new edited version, use the Selection
tool to select all pattern elements and Alt+drag (Option+drag on a
Mac) the new pattern over the existing pattern swatch in the Swatches
panel.
4. When a black border appears around the existing pattern, release the
mouse button.
All instances of the pattern in your illustration are updated.
If you want to add some space between tiles, as shown in Figure 9-14, create a
bounding box using a rectangle shape with no fill or stroke (representing the
repeat that you want to create). Send it behind the other objects in the pat-
tern and drag all objects, including the bounding box, to the Swatches panel.
We cover transformations in detail in Chapter 10 of this minibook, but some
specific transform features apply to patterns. To scale a pattern, but not the

object that it’s filling, double-click the Scale tool. In the Scale dialog box that
appears, type the value that you want to scale, but deselect all options except
for Patterns, as shown in Figure 9-15. This works for the Rotate tool as well!
Working with Gradients
Create gradients for nice smooth metallic effects or just to add dimension to
illustrations. If you’re not sure which swatches are considered gradients,
choose Gradient from the Show Swatch Kinds button at the bottom of the
Swatches panel.
Once applied, you can access the Gradient panel (shown in Figure 9-16) by
choosing Window➪Gradient. Choose Show Options from the Gradient panel
menu to see more options.

On the Gradient panel, use the Type drop-down list to choose a Radial gradi-
ent (one that radiates from the center point) or a Linear gradient (one that
follows a linear path).
Use the Gradient tool to change the direction and distance of a gradient
blend as follows:
1. Select an object and apply any existing gradient from the Swatches
panel to its fill.
2. Choose the Gradient tool (press G) and drag in the direction that you
want the gradient to go.
Drag a long path for a smooth, long gradient. Drag a short path for a
short, more defined gradient.
To create a new gradient, follow these steps:
1. With the Gradient panel options visible, click the gradient box at the
bottom of the panel.
Two color stops appear, one on each end.
2. Activate a color stop by clicking it.
When a color stop is active, the triangle on the top turns solid.
3. Choose Window➪Color to access the Color panel and then click the
triangle in the upper-right corner to open the panel menu; choose
RGB or CMYK colors.
4. Click the color ramp (across the bottom) in the Color panel to pick a
random color (or enter values in the text fields to select a specific
color) for the active color stop in the Gradient panel.
Repeat this step to select colors for other color stops.
To add additional color stops, click beneath the gradient slider and then
choose a color from the Color panel. You can also drag a swatch from the
Swatches panel to add a new color to the gradient. To remove a color stop,
drag it off the Gradient panel.
Copying Color Attributes
Wouldn’t it be great if you had tools that could record all the fill and stroke
attributes and apply them to other shapes? You’re in luck — the Eyedropper
tool can do just that! Copy the fill and stroke of an object and apply it to
another object using the Eyedropper tool as follows:

Copying Color Attributes
548
1. Create several shapes with different fill and stroke attributes, or open
an existing file that contains several different objects.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool and click a shape that has attributes you
want to copy.
3. Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) another object to apply those 
attributes.
Not only is this technique simple, but you can change the attributes that the
Eyedropper applies. Do so by double-clicking the Eyedropper tool; in the
dialog box that appears, select only the attributes that you want to copy.
The Live Trace feature
If you’re looking for good source art to use to experiment with color, look no
further than your own sketches and scanned images. You can automatically
trace bitmap images using a variety of settings that range from black-and-
white line art to vector art with multitudes of color that can be extracted
from your image.
To use the Live Trace feature, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Place and select an image that you want to trace.
The file you place can be a logo, sketch, or even an image. Notice that
after you place the image, the control panel offers additional options.
2. Click the arrow to the right of the Live Trace button.
This drop-down list provides Live Trace presets that may help you
better trace your image.
3. Scroll to the bottom and choose Tracing Options.
The Tracing Options window appears.
4. Check the Preview check box and experiment with the various set-
tings, as shown in Figure 9-17.
5. When you find the setting that works best for your image, choose
Trace.
You can return to the Tracing Options window and change settings over and
over again, until you find the best one.

The Live Paint Feature
Painting made easy! Don’t worry about filling closed shapes, or letting fills
escape out of objects with gaps into unwanted areas. With the Live Paint fea-
ture, you can create the image you want and fill in regions with color. The
Live Paint bucket automatically detects regions composed of independent
intersecting paths and fills them accordingly. The paint within a given region
remains live and flows automatically if any of the paths are moved. If you
want to give it a try, follow this nifty little exercise to put together an exam-
ple to experiment with.
1. Using the Ellipse tool, create a circle on your page.
Make it large enough to accommodate two or three inner circles.
2. Press the letter D (just D, nothing else).
As long as you’re not on the Type tool, you revert back to the default
colors of a black stroke and a white fill.
3. Double-click the Scale tool and enter 75% in the Uniform Scale 
text box.
4. Press the Copy button and then click OK.
You see a smaller circle inside the original.
5. Press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on a Mac) to duplicate the transformation and
create another circle inside of the last one.

6. Choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Ô+A on a Mac) to activate the cir-
cles you just created.
7. Make sure that the Fill swatch is forward.
The Fill swatch is at the bottom of the toolbar.
8. Use the Swatches or Color panel and choose any fill color.
9. Select the Live Paint Bucket tool and move the cursor over the various
regions of the circles.
See how the different regions become highlighted?
10. Click when you have the region activated that you want to fill.
Now try it with other fill colors in different regions, as shown in 
Figure 9-18.
Got Gaps?
A companion feature to the new paint bucket is support for Gap Detection.
With this feature, Illustrator is able to automatically and dynamically detect
and close small to large gaps that may be part of the artwork. You can deter-
mine whether you want paint to flow across region gap boundaries by using
the Gap Options dialog box under Object➪Live Paint➪Gap Options, as
shown in Figure 9-19.
When you save a file with the Live Paint feature back to an older version 
of Illustrator, it’s best to select the occurrences of Live Paint and choose
Object➪Expand. When the Expand window appears, leave the options at
their default and click OK. This setting breaks down the Live Paint objects to
individual shapes, which older versions can understand.

 Discovering transformation methods
 Putting the Transform tools to work
 Becoming familiar with the Liquify tools
 Distorting, warping, and otherwise reshaping objects
T
ransformations that you can give to objects in Illustrator include scaling,
rotating, skewing, and distorting. In this chapter, we show you how to
use the general transform tools as well as some of the neat Liquify and
Envelope Distort features available in Illustrator.
Working with Transformations
With just the Selection tool, you can scale and rotate a selected object. Drag
the bounding box handles to resize the object (as shown in Figure 10-1) or
get outside a handle, and then, when the cursor changes to a flippy arrow (a
curved arrow with arrowheads on both ends), drag to rotate the object.
Figure 10-1:
Use the
bounding
box to resize
or rotate a
selected
object.

Working with Transformations
554
If you want to scale proportionally, hold down the Shift key as you drag to
resize. To rotate an object at 45-degree increments, hold down the Shift key
while you’re rotating.
When you use the bounding box to rotate a selection, the bounding box
rotates with the object, but its handles show the object’s original orienta-
tion, as shown in Figure 10-2. This can help you to keep track of the original
placement but can also interfere when you’re building additional artwork. To
reset the bounding box so that it’s straight at the new orientation, choose
Object➪Transform➪Reset Bounding Box.
When you scale, rotate, or use any other type of transformation in Illustrator,
the final location becomes the zero point. In other applications, such as
InDesign, you can rotate an object by any number of degrees (45 degrees, 
for example) and later enter 0 for the rotation angle in the Transform palette
or in the Rotate dialog box to return the object to its original position. With
Illustrator, if you enter 0 for the rotation angle to return a rotated object to
its original position, the object will not change its position. To return the
object to the previous position in Illustrator, you have to enter the negative
of the number you originally entered to rotate the object, so you would 
enter –45 for the degree of rotation in this example.
Transforming an object
The Rotate, Reflect, Scale, and Shear tools all use the same basic steps to
perform transformations. Read on for those basic steps, and then follow
through some individual examples of the most often used transform tools.
The following sections show five ways to transform an object: one for an
arbitrary transformation and four others for exact transformations based 
on a numeric amount that you enter.

ing box

that angle.

Chapter 10
Using the Transform
and Distortion Tools
Working with Transformations
555
Arbitrary transformation method
This method is arbitrary, meaning that you’re eyeballing the transformation
of an object — in other words, you don’t have an exact percentage or angle
in mind, and you want to freely transform the object until it looks right. Just
follow these steps:
1. Select an object, and then choose a transform tool (the Rotate, Reflect,
Scale, or Shear tool).
2. Click once on the artboard.
Be careful where you click because the click determines the point of ref-
erence, or axis point, for the transformation, as shown in Figure 10-3.
3. Drag in one smooth movement.
Just drag until you get the transformation that you want.
Hold down the Alt (Option on a Mac) key when dragging to clone a newly
transformed item while keeping the original object intact. This is especially
helpful when you’re using the Reflect tool.
Exact transformation methods
In the following methods, we show you how to perform transformations
using specific numeric information:
✦Exact transformation method 1: Using the tool’s dialog box
1. Select an object and then choose the Rotate, Reflect, Scale, or
Shear tool.
Figure 10-3:
The first
mouse click
creates the
point of ref-
erence, or
axis point for
the trans-
formation.

Working with Transformations
556
2. Double-click the transform tool in the toolbox.
A dialog box specific to your chosen tool appears. For this example,
we selected and then double-clicked the Rotate tool to bring up the
Rotate dialog box.
3. Type an angle, scaled amount, or percentage in the appropriate
text field.
4. Check preview to see the effect of the transformation before you
click OK; click the Copy button instead of OK to keep the original
object intact and transform a copy.
✦Exact transformation method 2: Using the reference point
1. Select an object, and then choose the Rotate, Reflect, Scale, or
Shear tool.
2. Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) where you want the reference
point to be.
3. In the appropriate transform tool dialog box that appears, enter
your values and click OK or the Copy button to apply your 
transformation.
This is the best method to use if you need to rotate an object an
exact amount on a defined axis.
✦Exact transformation method 3: Using the Transform menu
1. Select an object, and then choose a transform option from the
Object➪Transform menu.
The appropriate transform dialog box appears.
2. Enter your values and click OK or the Copy button.
✦Exact transformation method 4: Using the Transform palette
Select an object and choose Window➪Transform to access the
Transform palette, as shown in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4:
The Trans-
form palette
allows you to
enter values.

While using this palette is probably the easiest way to go, it doesn’t give you
the option of specifying where you want your reference point to be or some
other options that apply to the individual transform tools.
Using the Transform tools
In this section, we show you how to use some of the most popular transform
tools to create transformations.
The Reflect tool
Nothing is symmetrical, right? Maybe not, but objects that are not symmetri-
cally created in Illustrator can look pretty off kilter. Using the Reflect tool,
you can reflect an object to create an exact mirrored shape of it; just follow
these steps:
1. Open a new document in Illustrator and type some text or create an
object.
If you want to reflect text, make sure that you use at least 60-point type
so that you can easily see what you’re working with.
2. Select the Reflect tool (hidden under the Rotate tool) and click the
object; if you’re using text, click in the middle of the text’s baseline, 
as shown on the right in Figure 10-6.
This step sets the reference point for the reflection.
3. Alt+Shift+drag (Option+Shift+drag on a Mac) and release when the
object or text is reflecting itself, as shown on the right in Figure 10-5.
This step not only clones the reflected object or text, but also snaps it to
45-degree angles.
Figure 10-5:

reference
point (left);

pleted

Working with Transformations

The Scale tool
Using the Scale tool, you can scale an object proportionally or non-uniformly.
Most people like to be scaled non-uniformly, maybe a little taller, a little thin-
ner, but on with the topic. Follow these steps to see the Scale tool in action:
1. Create a shape and give it no fill and a 5-point black stroke.
For this example, we created a circle. See Chapter 4 of this minibook if
you need a reminder on how to do this.
2. Select your shape and double-click the Scale tool.
The Scale dialog box appears.
3. Type a number in the Scale text field (in the Uniform section) and
click the Copy button.
We entered 125 in the Scale text field to increase the size of the object by
125 percent.
4. Press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on a Mac) to repeat the transformation as many
times as you want.
Each time you press Ctrl+D, the shape is copied and sized by the per-
cent you entered in the Scale text field. This is especially handy with cir-
cles and creates an instant bull’s-eye!
To experiment with the Scale tool, create different shapes in Step 1 and enter
different values in Step 3. Remember that if you type 50% in the Scale text
field, the object is made smaller; go over 100% — say to 150% for example —
to make the object larger. Leaving the Scale text field at 100% has no effect
on the object.
The Shear tool
The Shear tool enables you to shear an object by selecting an axis and drag-
ging to set a shear angle, as shown in Figure 10-6.
Figure 10-6:
Create
perspective
using the
Shear tool.

Book IV
Chapter 10
Using the Transform
and Distortion Tools
Creating Distortions
559
The axis will always be the center of the object unless you use method 1 or
method 2 from the earlier section, “Exact transformation methods.” Use the
Shear tool in combination with the Rotate tool to give an object perspective.
The Reshape tool
The Reshape tool enables you to select anchor points and sections of paths
and adjust them in one direction. You determine that direction by dragging
an anchor point with the Reshape tool selected.
The Reshape tool works differently from the other transform tools. To use it,
follow these steps:
1. Select just the anchor points on the paths that you want to reshape.
Deselect any points that you want to remain in place.
2. Select the Reshape tool (hidden under the Scale tool) and position 
the cursor over the anchor point that you want to modify; click the
anchor point.
If you click a path segment, a highlighted anchor point with a square
around it is added to the path.
3. Shift+click more anchor points or path segments to act as selection
points.
You can highlight an unlimited number of anchor points or path 
segments.
4. Drag the highlighted anchor points to adjust the path.
The Free Transform tool
You use the Free Transform tool pretty much like you use the bounding box.
(See the earlier section, “Working with Transformations.”) This tool is neces-
sary only if you choose View➪Hide Bounding Box but want free transform
capabilities.
Creating Distortions
Bend objects, make them wavy, gooey, or spiky — you can do all of these
things by creating simple to complex distortions with the Liquify tools and
Envelope Distort features.

Creating Distortions
560
The Liquify tools
The Liquify tools can accomplish all sorts of creative or wacky (depending
on how you look at it) distortions to your objects. You can choose from
seven Liquify tools. Even though we define these for you in Table 10-1, you
really need to experiment with these tools to understand their full capabili-
ties. Here are some tips:
✦A variety of Liquify tools are available by holding down the mouse
button on the default selection, the Warp tool. If you use them fre-
quently, drag to the arrow at the end of the tools and release when you
see the ToolTip for Tearoff. You can then position the tools anywhere in
your work area.
✦Double-click any of the Liquify tools to bring up a dialog box specific to
the selected tool, as shown for the Warp tool in Figure 10-8.
✦When a Liquify tool is selected, the brush size appears. Adjust the diam-
eter and shape of the Liquify tool by holding down the Alt (Option on a
Mac) key while dragging the brush shape smaller or larger. Add the Shift
key to constrain the shape to a circle.

Using the Envelope Distort command
Use the Envelope Distort command to arch text and apply other creative dis-
tortions to an Illustrator object. To use the Envelope Distort command, you
can either use a preset warp (the easiest method) or a grid or a top object to
determine the amount and type of distortion. In this section, we discuss all
three methods.
Using the preset warps
Experimenting is a little more interesting if you have a word or object
selected before trying the different warp presets. To warp an object or text
to a preset style, follow these steps:
1. Select the text or object that you want to distort, and then choose
Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make With Warp.
The Warp Options dialog box appears.
2. Choose a warp style from the Style drop-down list and then specify
any other options you want.
3. Click OK to apply your distortion.
Note: If you want to experiment with warping, but also want to revert back
to the original at any time, choose Effect➪Warp. Find out more about excit-
ing Effects that you can apply to objects in Chapter 12 of this minibook.
Reshaping with a mesh grid
You can also assign a grid to the objects to give you the ability to drag differ-
ent points and create your own custom distortion, as shown in Figure 10-7.
Follow these steps to apply a mesh grid:
1. Select the text or object that you want to distort, and then choose
Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make With Mesh.
The Envelope Mesh dialog box appears.
Figure 10-7:

2. Specify the number of rows and columns that you want the mesh to
contain and then click OK.
3. To reshape the object, drag any anchor point on the mesh grid with
the Direct Selection tool.
To delete anchor points on the mesh grid, select an anchor point with the
Direct Selection tool and press the Delete key.
You can also use the Mesh tool to edit and delete points when using a mesh
grid on objects.
Reshaping an object with a different object
To form letters into the shape of an oval or distort selected objects into
another object, use this technique:
1. Create text that you want to distort.
2. Create the object that you want to use as the envelope (the object to
be used to define the distortion).
3. Choose Object➪Arrange to make sure that the envelope object is on
top, as shown in Figure 10-8.
4. Select the text and Shift+click to select the envelope object.
5. Choose Object➪Envelope Distort➪Make with Top Object.
The underlying object is distorted to fit the shape of the top (envelope)
object.

T
his chapter is full of neat things that you can do using some of the more
advanced features in Adobe Illustrator. These special effects tools can
help you create art that really makes an impact: Discover how to make your
art look like a painting with the Gradient Mesh tool, create morph-like blends
with the Blend tool, become a pseudo-graffiti artist by trying out the Symbol
Sprayer tool, and see what’s underneath objects by using transparency!
The Mesh Tool
If you’re creating art in Illustrator that requires solid colors or continuous
patterns, you can achieve those results quite easily. But what if you’re work-
ing on something that requires continuous tones, like a person’s face? In
that case, you’d turn to the very handy Mesh tool, which enables you to
create the impression that you used paint and paintbrushes to create your
illustration. Choose to blend one color into another and then use the 
Mesh tool to adjust where the blends occur and how dramatic the blends
should be.
The Mesh tool can be as complex or simple as you want. Create intense
illustrations that look like they were created with an airbrush, or just use it
to give an object dimension, like the objects shown in Figure 11-1.

The Mesh Tool
564
We show you how to create a gradient mesh two different ways: First by
clicking (which gives you a little more freedom to put mesh points where
you want them) and then by manually setting the number of rows and
columns in the mesh (which is a more precise method).
You can change the color in mesh points by choosing the Direct Selection
tool and either clicking a mesh point and picking a fill color, or by clicking in
the center of a mesh area and choosing a fill. Each gives you a very different
result, as shown in Figure 11-2. To add a mesh point without changing to the
current fill color, Shift+click anywhere in a filled vector object.
To create a gradient mesh by clicking, follow these steps:
1. Deselect all objects by choosing Select➪Deselect.
2. Select a fill color that you want to apply as a mesh point to an object.
For example, if you have a red circle and you want a shaded white spot,
choose white for your fill color.

3. Select the Mesh tool (keyboard shortcut is U) and click anywhere in a
filled vector object.
The object is converted to a mesh object.
4. Click the object as many times as you want to add additional mesh
points.
To create a gradient mesh by setting the number of rows and columns,
follow these steps:
1. Select a bitmap or filled vector object.
2. Choose Object➪Create Gradient Mesh.
The Create Gradient Mesh dialog box appears.
3. Set the number of rows and columns of mesh lines to create on the
object by entering numbers in the Rows and Columns text fields.
4. Choose the direction of the highlight from the Appearance drop-
down list.
The direction of the highlight determines in what way the gradient flows
(see Figure 11-3); you have the following choices:
• Flat: Applies the object’s original color evenly across the surface,
resulting in no highlight.
• To Center: Creates a highlight in the center of the object.
• To Edge: Creates a highlight on the edges of the object.
5. Enter a percentage of white highlight to apply to the mesh object in
the Highlight text field.
6. Click OK to apply the gradient mesh to the object.
Figure 11-3:

The Blend Tool
566
The Blend Tool
Use the Blend tool (located in the main Illustrator toolbox) to transform one
object to another to create interesting morphed artwork or to create shaded
objects. With the Blend tool, you can give illustrations a rendered look by
blending from one color to another, or you can create an even amount of
shapes from one point to another. Figure 11-4 shows examples of what you
can do with this tool.
Creating a blend isn’t difficult, and as you get used to it, you can take it far-
ther and farther, creating incredibly realistic effects with it. Follow these
steps to create a simple blend from one sized rectangle to another, creating
an algorithmic stripe pattern (a rectangle of one height blended to a rectan-
gle of another height):
1. Create a shape.
Size doesn’t really matter for this example; you just want to make sure
that you can see a difference in shapes when you blend. We’re using a
rectangle that’s roughly 4 x 1 inches.
2. Give your shape a fill and assign None to the stroke.
You can use other settings here, but we recommend keeping it simple if
you’re still new to working with blends.
3. With the Selection tool, click the rectangle and Alt+drag (Option+drag
on a Mac) toward the bottom of the artboard to clone your shape;
press the Shift key before you release the mouse button to make sure
that the cloned shape stays perfectly aligned with the original shape.
4. Reduce the cloned shape to about half its original height by using the
Transform panel (if the Transform panel isn’t visible, choose
Window➪Transform).
Alternatively, you can hold down the Shift key and drag the bottom-
middle bounding box handle, as shown in Figure 11-5.
Figure 11-4:
Samples of
objects using
the blend
feature.

Book IV
Chapter 11
Working with
Transparency 
and Special 
Effects Tools
The Blend Tool
567
5. In the Swatches panel (choose Window➪Swatches), change the cloned
shape’s fill to a different color, but keep the stroke at None.
Changing the color just helps you see the blend effect a little better.
6. With the Blend tool, click the original shape and then click the cloned
shape.
As a default, the Blend tool creates a smooth blend that transitions from
one color to another, as shown in Figure 11-6. To change the blend effect,
you need to experiment with the Blend Options dialog box.
You can change the way that a blend appears by using the Blend Options dialog
box, which you access by choosing Object➪Blend➪Blend Options. From the
Spacing drop-down list, change the blend to one of the following options:
✦Smooth Color: The blend steps are calculated to provide the optimum
number of steps for a smooth transition.
✦Specified Steps: You can determine the number of steps in a blend by
typing a number in the text field to the right of the drop-down list.
✦Specified Distance: You control the distance between the steps in the
blend by typing a number in the text field to the right of the drop-down list.

The Symbol Sprayer Tool
568
You can also choose between two orientation options: Align To Page (orients
the blend perpendicular to the X-axis of the page) or Align To Path (orients
the blend perpendicular to the path). You will probably not see a difference
when changing orientation unless you have edited the blend path.
You can easily access the Blend tool options by selecting a Blended object
and double-clicking the Blend tool in the toolbox.
If you’re feeling adventurous, try changing a smooth blend (such as the one
you create in the preceding steps) into a logarithmic blend. In the Blend
Options dialog box, choose Specified Steps from the Spacing drop-down list
and change the value to 5. This change creates the blend in five steps
instead of the 200 plus steps that may have been necessary to create the
smooth blend.
Here are a few more tips to help you become more comfortable using blends:
✦You can blend between an unlimited number of objects, colors, opaci-
ties, or gradients.
✦Blends can be directly edited with tools, such as the Selection tools, the
Rotate tool, or the Scale tool.
✦A straight path is created between blended objects when the blend is
first applied. You can switch to the Direct Selection tool and edit the
blend path by dragging anchor points.
✦You can edit blends that you created by moving, resizing, deleting, or
adding objects. After you make editing changes, the artwork is automati-
cally reblended.
The Symbol Sprayer Tool
The Symbol Sprayer tool is a super tool that you must experiment with to
understand its full potential. In a nutshell, however, what it does is work like
a can of spray paint that, instead of spraying paint, sprays symbols —
objects that, in Illustrator, can be either vector- or pixel-based. Each individ-
ual symbol is an instance.
Illustrator comes with a library of symbols ready for use in the Symbols
panel (if the Symbols panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Symbols Panel).
Use this panel as a storage bin or library to save repeatedly used artwork 
or to create your own symbols to apply as instances in your artwork, like

To create a symbol, select the object and drag it into the Symbols panel or
click the New Symbol button at the bottom of the Symbols panel. Yes, it’s
that easy. Then use the Symbol Sprayer tool to apply the Symbol instance on
the artboard by following these steps:
1. Select the symbol instance in the Symbols panel.
Either create your own symbol or use one of the default symbols sup-
plied in the panel.
2. Drag with the Symbol Sprayer tool, spraying the symbol on the art-
board (see Figure 11-7).
And that’s it. You can increase or reduce the area affected by the Symbol
sprayer by pressing the bracket keys. Press ] repeatedly to enlarge the
application area for the symbol or [ to make it smaller.
Note that you can access all sorts of Symbol Libraries from the Symbols

Transparency
Using transparency can add a new level to your illustrations. The trans-
parency feature does exactly what its name implies: It changes an object to
make it transparent so that what’s underneath that object is visible to vary-
ing degrees. You can use the Transparency panel for simple applications of
transparency to show through to underlying objects, or you can use trans-
parency for more complex artwork using opacity masks, masks that can con-
trol the visibility of selected objects.
Choosing Window➪Transparency brings up the Transparency panel where
you can apply different levels of transparency to objects. To do so, create an
arrangement of objects that intersect, select the topmost object, and then
change the transparency level of the object in the Transparency panel, either
by moving the Opacity slider or by entering a value of less than 100 in the
Opacity text field.
Blend modes
A blend mode determines how the resulting transparency will look. So to
achieve different blending effects, you choose different blend modes from
the Blend Mode drop-down list in the Transparency panel.
Truly, the best way to find out what all these modes do is to create two
shapes that are overlapping and start experimenting. Give the shapes differ-
ently colored fills (but note that many of the blending modes don’t work
with black and white fills). Then select the topmost object and change the
blending mode by selecting an option from the Blend Mode drop-down list in
the Transparency panel. You’ll see all sorts of neat effects and probably end
up picking a few favorites.
We define each blend mode in the following list (but we’ll say it again, the
best way to see what each one does is to apply them — so start 
experimenting!):
✦Normal: Creates no interaction with underlying colors.
✦Darken: Replaces only the areas that are lighter than the blend color.
Areas darker than the blend color don’t change.
✦Multiply: Creates an effect similar to drawing on the page with magic
markers. Also looks like colored film you see on theater lights.
✦Color Burn: Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color. If you’re
using white, no change occurs.

Transparency
572
✦Lighten: Replaces only the areas darker than the blend color. Areas
lighter than the blend color don’t change.
✦Screen: Multiplies the inverse of the underlying colors. The resulting
color is always a lighter color.
✦Color Dodge: Brightens the underlying color to reflect the blend color. If
you’re using black, there is no change.
✦Overlay: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the base color.
✦Soft Light: Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color.
The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the artwork.
✦Hard Light: Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the blend
color. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the artwork.
✦Difference: Subtracts either the blend color from the base color or the
base color from the blend color, depending on which has the greater
brightness value. The effect is similar to a color negative.
✦Exclusion: Creates an effect similar to, but with less contrast than, the
Difference mode.
✦Hue: Applies the hue (color) of the blend object onto the underlying
objects, but keeps the underlying shading, or luminosity.
✦Saturation: Applies the saturation of the blend color, but uses the lumi-
nance and hue of the base color.
✦Color: Applies the blend object’s color to the underlying objects but 
preserves the gray levels in the artwork. This is great for tinting objects
or changing their color.
✦Luminosity: Creates a resulting color with the hue and saturation of the
base color and the luminance of the blend color. This is essentially the
opposite of the Color mode.
Opacity masks
Just like in Photoshop, you can use masks to make more interesting artwork
in Illustrator. Create an opacity mask from the topmost object in a selection
of objects or by drawing a mask on a single object. The mask uses the
grayscale of the object selected to be the opacity mask. Black areas are
totally transparent; shades of gray are semi-transparent, depending on the
amount of gray; and white areas are totally opaque. Figure 11-8 shows the
effect of an opacity mask.

Book IV
Chapter 11
Working with
Transparency 
and Special 
Effects Tools
Transparency

To create an opacity mask, follow these steps:
1. Open the Transparency panel menu (click the arrow in the upper-
right corner to access this menu) and choose Show Thumbnails.
Also, be sure that the Blend Mode drop-down list is set to Normal.
2. Create a shape anywhere on the artboard or open a document that
has artwork on it.
We’re using a rectangle, but the shape doesn’t matter. Make sure that the
artwork has a fill. A solid color will help you see the effect.
3. Open the Symbols panel (choose Window➪Symbols Panel) and drag a
symbol to the artboard.
For this example, we’re using the butterfly symbol.
4. With the Selection tool, enlarge your symbol so that it fills your shape
(see image on the left in Figure 11-9).
5. Select both the symbol and the shape and then choose Make Opacity
Mask from the Transparency panel menu.
The symbol turns into a mask, showing varying levels of the underlying
box through, depending on the original color value. To delete an Opacity
mask, choose Release Opacity Mask from the Transparency panel menu.

Click the right thumbnail (this is the mask) in the Transparency panel, and a
black border appears around it, indicating that it’s active. You can move the
items on the mask, or even create items to be added to the mask. It works
just like the regular artboard, except that anything done on the mask side
will only be used as an opacity mask. To work on the regular artboard, click
the left thumbnail.

F
ilters and effects give you the opportunity to do jazzy things to your
Illustrator objects, such as adding drop shadows and squiggling artwork.
You can even use Photoshop filters right in Illustrator. In this chapter, we
explain the difference between filters and effects (it’s a very big difference);
show you how to apply, save, and edit filters and effects; and give you a
quick tour of the Appearance panel (your trusty sidekick when performing
these tasks).
Working with Filters and Effects
Filters apply permanent changes to artwork. After you use the filter, the only
way to remove the change is to undo your actions or choose Object➪Expand
and take it apart. This process can be messy and not near as much fun as
using an effect that is dynamically connected to the object. Effects are very
different in that you can apply, change, and even remove effects at any time
with the Appearance panel (Window➪Appearance).
In Figure 12-1, we applied the drop shadow filter when the shape was a rec-
tangle; then we applied the roughen filter. Notice that the drop shadow has
no interaction with the original artwork.

Working with Filters and Effects
576
In contrast, in Figure 12-2, we applied the Roughen effect, and the rectangle’s
drop shadow changed to look like the new shape. In the Appearance panel,
you can double-click an effect to change it, or even drag it to the Trash icon
in the lower-right corner of the Appearance panel to remove it.
Understanding the Appearance panel
You can apply multiple effects to one object and even copy the effects to
multiple objects. This is when a good working knowledge of the Appearance
panel is necessary. If it isn’t visible, choose Window➪Appearance to show
the Appearance panel, as shown in Figure 12-3.

To turn off effects so that they aren’t automatically applied to any future
objects, use any one of three buttons at the bottom of the Appearance panel:
✦New Art Maintains Appearance: With the New Art Maintains Appearance
button selected, your new art maintains the effects that you have
applied to the present object.
Click this button to switch to New Art Has Basic Appearance so that
when you create the next object, colors are maintained, but just a single
fill and stroke are created.
✦Clear Appearance: Click this button if you have a selected object and
want the Fill and Stroke color boxes to be set to None.
✦Reduce To Basic Appearance: If you have a selected object and dis-
cover that you applied unwanted effects, click this button to reduce it
back to a single fill and stroke.
As a default, if you have no effects applied, you see only a fill and a stroke
listed in the Appearance panel. As you add effects, they’re added to this list.
You can even add more strokes and fills to the list. Why would you do that?
Because you can do incredible things with additional fills and strokes (which
we show you in the upcoming section “Applying an effect.”
Applying a filter
If effects are so great, why even use filters? Well, nothing can be all good. If
you have lots of RAM (Random Access Memory) and you don’t mind running
through a few extra steps before printing (see Chapter 13 of this minibook),
effects are the way to go. Most people don’t mind, but you should see the
alternative as well. Plus, some very useful Color filters are available that
don’t exist as effects — for example, filters that take a full color illustration
and change it to grayscale.
If you generally work in the CMYK color mode, you will come across filters
and effects that are grayed out. You can apply these filters and effects only in
the RGB color mode. Choose File➪Document Color Mode and change the
document to RGB to use them.
Filters aren’t dynamically linked to the original object that they were 
created from.
To apply the Add Arrowhead Filter, follow these steps (which essentially just
add arrowheads to a path and are pretty straightforward):
1. Create a new document, choose any color mode, and draw a path in
your document.
If you haven’t mastered the Pen tool yet (see Chapter 5 of this mini-
book), use the Pencil tool.

Working with Filters and Effects
578
2. To make it clear what is happening with the arrowheads, give the path
a 3-pt stroke and make sure that there’s no fill.
Using a 3-pt stroke enables you to see the stroke a little easier.
3. Choose Filter➪Stylize➪Add Arrowheads.
Make sure that you choose the top Stylize menu item.
The Add Arrowheads dialog box appears (see Figure 12-4).
4. Choose to add an arrowhead to both the start and the end of the path
by using the arrow keys to scroll through the selection.
Note that the Start arrowhead (top of Add Arrowhead dialog box) will be
placed on the first point you created; the End arrowhead (bottom of the
dialog box) will be placed on the last point you created.
5. Choose the size of the arrowhead by typing a number in the Scale 
text field.
You can go anywhere from 1 to 1,000 percent, but typically an arrow is
set at 50 percent. There is no preview available, but this scales the
arrowhead relative to the selected line stroke weight.
Note that if you used the Arrowhead effect instead of the Filter, the arrow-
head would dynamically be linked to the stroke. Scaling and changing direc-
tion occur automatically as the stroke weight and direction are updated. See
the next section for more information on effects.
Applying an effect
To apply the Add Arrowheads effect, choose Effects➪Stylize➪Add Arrowheads.
Use the same settings that we describe in the preceding step list and then
reposition some of the anchor points on the path by using the Direct Selection
Figure 12-4:
Use the Add
Arrowheads
Filter to
create
arrows.

and Effects

tool to see how the arrowhead applied with the effect moves with the direc-
tion of the path; the filter keeps the arrowhead in its original position.
Different from filters, the items under the Effect menu are dynamically linked
to the object that they were applied to. Effects can be scaled, modified, and
even deleted from the original object with no harm done to the original object.
Creating a drop shadow is a quick and easy way of adding dimension and a
bit of sophistication to your artwork. The interaction between the object
with the drop shadow and the underlying objects can create an interesting
look. To add the Drop Shadow effect to an illustration, follow these steps:
1. Select the object(s) that are to have the drop shadow applied.
2. Choose Effect➪Stylize➪Drop Shadow.
3. In the Drop Shadow dialog box that appears, select the Preview check
box in the upper-right corner.
You now see the drop shadow applied as you make changes.
4. Choose from the following options (see Figure 12-5):
• Mode: Select a blending mode from this drop-down list to choose
how you want your selected object to interact with the objects
underneath. The default is Multiply, which works well — the effect is
similar to coloring with a magic marker.
• Opacity: Enter a value or use the drop-down list to determine how
opaque or transparent the drop shadow should be. If it’s too strong,
choose a lower amount.
• Offset: Enter a value to determine how close the shadow is to the
object. If you’re working with text or small artwork, smaller values
(and shorter shadow) look best. Otherwise, the drop shadow may
look like one big indefinable glob.
The X Offset shifts the shadow from left to right, and the Y Offset
shifts it up or down. You can enter negative or positive numbers.
• Blur: Use blur to control how fuzzy the edges of the shadow are. A
lower value makes the edge of the shadow more defined.
• Color and Darkness: Select the Color radio button to choose a
custom color for the drop shadow. Use Darkness to add more black
to the drop shadow. Zero percent is the lowest amount of black, and
100 percent is the highest.
As a default, the color of the shadow is based upon the color of your
object, sort of . . . the Darkness option has a play in this, also. As a
default, the shadow is made up of the color in the object if it’s solid.
Multicolored objects have a gray shadow.

Saving Graphic Styles
580
Saving Graphic Styles
A graphic style is a combination of all the settings you choose for a particular
filter or effect in the Appearance panel. By saving this information in a
graphic style, you store these attributes so that you can quickly and easily
apply them to other objects later.
Choose Window➪Graphics Styles; in the panel that appears are thumbnails
of many different styles that Adobe has provided to you as a default. Click
any of these graphic styles to apply the style to an active object. Look at the
Appearance panel as you click different styles to see that you’re applying com-
binations of attributes, including effects, fills, and strokes (see Figure 12-6).
Find more styles by choosing the Graphic Styles panel menu (click the arrow
in the upper-right corner of the panel) and selecting Open Graphic Style
Library.

You can store attributes as a graphic style in several ways; we show you two
easy methods. If you have a combination of attributes already applied to an
object, store them by doing one of the following:
✦With the object selected, Alt+click (Option+click on a Mac) the New
Graphic Style button at the bottom of the Graphic Style panel. Alt+click-
ing (Option+clicking on a Mac) allows you to name the style as it is
added.
✦Drag the selected object right into the Graphic Style panel. The panel
stores its attributes, but you have to double-click the new style to 
name it.
After you store a graphic style, simply select the object that you want to
apply the style to and then click the saved style in the Graphic Styles panel.
Creating 3D Artwork
All the effects in Illustrator are great, but this new feature is really swell. Not
only can you add dimension by using the 3D effect, you can also map artwork
(that is, wrap artwork around a 3D object) and apply lighting to the 3D
object. This means that you can design a label for a jelly jar and actually
adhere it to the jar to show the client!
Here are the three choices for the 3D effect:
✦Extrude & Bevel: This uses the z-axis to extrude an object. For example,
a square becomes a cube.
✦Revolve: Uses the z-axis and revolves a shape around it. You can use
this to change an arc into a ball.
✦Rotate: Rotates a 3D object created with the Extrude & Bevel or Revolve
effects, or you can rotate a 2D object in 3D space. You can also adjust a
3D or 2D object’s perspective.
To apply a 3D effect, you need to create an object appropriate for the 3D
effect. Extrude & Bevel works great with shapes and text. If you want to edit
an object that already has a 3D effect applied to it, double-click the 3D effect
in the Appearance panel.
To apply a 3D effect, follow these steps:
1. Select the object that you want to apply the 3D effect to.
For this example, we’re choosing Extrude & Bevel.

Creating 3D Artwork
582
2. Choose Effect➪3D➪Extrude & Bevel.
Options for your chosen 3D effect appear. The Extrude & Bevel Options
dialog box is shown in Figure 12-7.
3. Select the Preview check box in the dialog box so that you can see
results as you experiment with these settings.
4. Click the Preview pane (which shows a cube in Figure 12-7) and drag
to rotate your object in space.
It makes selecting the right angle fun, or you can choose the angle from
the Position drop-down list above the preview. This is called positioning
the object in space.
You should never rotate a 3D object with the Rotate tool, unless you
want some very funky results; use the Preview pane in this dialog box
instead.
5. If you want, use the Perspective drop-down list to add additional per-
spective to your object.
6. In the Extrude And Bevel section of the 3D Effects dialog box, choose
a depth for your object and a cap.
The cap determines whether your shape has a solid cap on it or whether
it’s hollow, as shown in Figure 12-8.
Figure 12-7:

7. Choose a bevel (edge shape) from the Bevel drop-down list and set the
height using the Height drop-down list.
You have a choice of two ways to apply the bevel:
• Bevel Extent Out: The bevel is added to the object.
• Bevel Extent In: The bevel is subtracted from the object.
8. Choose a rendering style from the Surface drop-down list or click the
More Options button for in-depth lighting options, such as changing
the direction or adding additional lighting.
9. Click the Map Art button.
The Map Art dialog box opens. Use this dialog box to apply artwork to a
3D object.
10. Using the Surface arrow buttons, select which surface you want the
artwork applied to and then choose the symbol from the Symbols
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 12-9.
The result is shown on the bottom in Figure 12-9.
Keep the following points in mind when mapping artwork:
✦An object must be a symbol to be used as mapped artwork. You would
simply need to select and drag the artwork that you want mapped to the
Symbols panel to make it a selectable item in the Map Art dialog box.
✦The light gray areas in the Preview pane are the visible areas based
upon the object’s present position. Drag and scale the artwork in this
pane to get the artwork where you want it.
✦Shaded artwork (the check box at the bottom of the dialog box) looks
good but can take a long time to render.
Note: All 3D effects are rendered at 72 dpi (low resolution) so as not to slow
down processing speed. You can determine the resolution by choosing Effect➪
Document Raster Effects Settings, or when you save or export the file. You
can also select the object and choose Object➪Rasterize. After the object is
rasterized, it can no longer be used as an Illustrator 3D object, so save the
original!

Using the panel menu in the Appearance panel, you can add more fills and
strokes. With this feature, you can put different colored fills on top of each
other and individually apply effects to each one, creating really interesting
and creative results.
Just for fun, follow along to see what you can do to a single object with the
Appearance panel:
1. Create a star shape.
It doesn’t matter how many points it has, or how large it is, just make it
large enough to work with.
2. Use the Window➪Swatches panel to fill it with yellow and give it a
black stroke.

3. Use Window➪Stroke to make the stroke 1 pt or choose 1 from the
Stroke drop-down menu in the control panel.
Notice that in the Appearance panel, the present fill and stroke are
listed. Even in the simplest form, the Appearance panel helps track basic
attributes. You can easily take advantage of the tracking to apply effects
to just a fill or a stroke.
4. Click Stroke in the Appearance panel.
5. Choose Effect➪Path➪Offset Path and in the Offset Panel dialog 
box that appears, change the Offset to –5pt and select the Preview
check box.
Notice that the stroke moves into the fill instead of on the edge.
6. Change the offset to something that works with your star shape and
click OK.
Depending on the size of your star, you may want to adjust the amount
of offset up or down.
7. From the panel menu of the Appearance panel, choose to add an addi-
tional fill to the star shape.
This may sound ridiculous, but you can create some super effects with
multiple fills.
8. Click Fill in the Appearance panel (the top one) and choose Effect➪
Distort and Transform➪Twist.
9. In the Twist dialog box that appears, type 45 into the Angle text field
and select the Preview check box.
Notice how only the second fill is twisted? Pretty neat, right?
10. Click OK to exit the Twist dialog box.
11. Select the top Fill from the Appearance panel again.
You always have to be sure that they’re selected before doing anything
that is meant to change just a specific fill or stroke.
12. Then, using the Transparency panel (choose Window➪Transparency),
choose 50% from the Opacity slider or simply type 50% in the Opacity
text field.
Now you can see your original shape through the new fill!
13. With that top fill still selected, change the color or choose a pattern in
the Swatches palette for a really different appearance.
You could go on for hours playing around with combinations of fills and
strokes. Hopefully, this clicks, and you can take it further on your own.

o you have beautiful artwork, but you aren’t sure how to get it off your
screen. You could have a party and invite all interested clients to stand
around your monitor and ooh and ah, or you could actually share or sell
your artwork by putting it on the Internet or printing it.
In this chapter, we show you how to use your illustrations in a variety of
workflows, from using Illustrator files in page layout programs, to exporting
files for Photoshop (and other programs) and the Web. Hopefully, this chap-
ter can help you really use your artwork and understand the saving and flat-
tening choices available in Adobe Illustrator.
Saving and Exporting Illustrator Files
In this section, we show you how the general choices in the Save As dialog
box (choose File➪Save As) differ and the benefits of each.
If you need a particular file format that is not listed in the regular Save As
dialog box, choose File➪Export for additional choices. Using the File Export
command, you can choose to save your files in any of the formats in 
Table 13-1.

Many of these formats rasterize your artwork, meaning that they’ll no longer
maintain vector paths and the benefits of being vector. Scalability is not lim-
ited, for example. If you think that you may want to edit your image again
later, be sure to save a copy of the file and keep the original in the .ai
format.
The native Adobe Illustrator file format
If your workflow can handle it, the best way to save your file is as a native
Illustrator .ai file. By workflow, we mean that you’re working with Adobe
applications such as Adobe InDesign for page layout, Adobe Dreamweaver
for Web page creation, Adobe Photoshop for photo-retouching, and Adobe
Acrobat for cross-platform documents.
Understanding when it’s best to use the .ai format is important. Saving
your illustration as an .ai file ensures that your file is editable; it also
ensures that any transparency is retained, even if you use the file in another
application.
To save and use a file in the native Illustrator format, follow these steps:
1. Make an illustration with transparency (50 percent transparent, for
example) in Adobe Illustrator and choose File➪Save As.

Book IV
Chapter 13
Using Your
Illustrator Images
Saving and Exporting Illustrator Files
589
2. Select Adobe Illustrator Document (.ai) from the Save As Type drop-
down list, give the file a name, and click Save.
3. Leave the Illustrator Native Options at the defaults and click OK.
After you follow the preceding steps to prepare your Illustrator file, you can
use the illustration in other Adobe applications:
✦Adobe Acrobat: Open the Acrobat application and choose File➪Open.
Locate the .ai file. Native Illustrator files open in Acrobat when you
open them from within the Acrobat application.
✦Adobe InDesign: Choose File➪Place. This method supports trans-
parency created in Adobe Illustrator. (However, copying and pasting
from Illustrator to InDesign does not support transparency.) See 
Figure 13-1.
✦Adobe Photoshop: Choose File➪Place. By placing an Illustrator file into
Adobe Photoshop, you automatically create a Photoshop Smart Object.
You can scale, rotate, and even apply effects to the Illustrator file and
return to the original illustration at any time. Read more about Smart
Objects in Photoshop in Chapter 9 of the Photoshop CS3 minibook.
If you really want to go crazy with an Illustrator file in Photoshop, 
when you save the file in Illustrator, choose File➪Export and select the
Photoshop (.psd) format from the Save As Type drop-down list. Choose
a resolution from the options window. If you used layers, leave the Write
Layers option selected.
In Photoshop, choose File➪Open, select the file that you just saved in
Illustrator as a .psd, and click Open. The file opens in Photoshop with
the layers intact.

✦Adobe Flash: New integration features built into Adobe Illustrator CS3
allow you to cut and paste directly into Adobe Flash CS3. If you Choose
Edit➪Copy from Adobe Illustrator, you can then switch to Adobe Flash
CS3 and choose Edit➪Paste. The Paste dialog box appears.
✦Adobe Dreamweaver: By choosing File➪Save for Web & Devices, you
can choose to save your Illustrator document in the .gif, .jpg, .png,
.swf, .svg, or WBMP format. You can then insert these formats into
Dreamweaver by choosing Insert➪Image in Adobe Dreamweaver.
Select the Image button from the Insert panel in Dreamweaver. When the Select
Image Source dialog box appears, navigate to the location which you saved
your optimized file. Select it and click Choose. If your file is located out of
the root folder for the site you’re working on, an alert window appears, offer-
ing the opportunity to save the file with your other site assets.
Saving Illustrator files back to previous versions
When saving an .ai or .eps file, you can choose a version from the Version
drop-down menu. Keep in mind that any features specific to newer versions
of Illustrator will not be supported in older file formats, so make sure that
you save a copy and keep the original file intact. Adobe helps you under-
stand the risk of saving back to older versions by putting a warning sign next
to the version drop-down menu and showing you specific issues with the
version you have selected in the Warnings window.
The EPS file format
EPS is the file format that most text editing and page layout applications
accept; EPS supports vector data and is completely scalable. The Illustrator
.eps format is based on PostScript, which means that you can reopen an
EPS file and edit it in Illustrator at any time.
To save a file in Illustrator as an EPS, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As and select EPS (Encapsulated PostScript File)
from the Save As Type drop-down list.
2. From the Version menu, choose the Illustrator version you’re saving to.
3. In the EPS Options dialog box that appears (shown in Figure 13-2),
choose the preview from the Format drop-down list:
• TIFF (8-bit Color): A color preview for either Mac or PC.
• TIFF (Black & White): A low-resolution black-and-white preview.

4. Select either the Transparent or Opaque option, depending on whether
you want the non-image areas in your artwork to be transparent or
opaque.
5. Set your Transparency Flattening settings.
These settings are grayed out if you haven’t used transparency in the
file. (See the “Flattening Transparency” section, later in this chapter, for
more about this setting.)
6. Leave the Embed Fonts (For Other Applications) check box selected to
leave fonts you used embedded in the EPS file format.
7. In the Options section, leave the Include CMYK PostScript In RGB
Files check box selected.
If you don’t know which Adobe Postscript level you want to save to,
leave it at the default.
8. Click OK to save your file as an EPS.

The PDF file format
If you want to save your file in a format that supports over a dozen platforms
and requires only the Acrobat Reader, available as a free download at
www.adobe.com, choose to save in the PDF format.
If you can open an Illustrator file in Acrobat, why would you need to save a
file in the PDF format? Well, for one thing, you can compress a PDF down to a
smaller size; also, the receiver can double-click the file, and Acrobat or
Acrobat Reader launches automatically.
Depending on how you save the PDF, you can allow some level of editability
in Adobe Illustrator. To save a file in the PDF format, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As; select Illustrator PDF (.pdf) from the Save As
Type drop-down list and then click Save.
2. In the Adobe PDF Options dialog box that appears, select one of the
following options from the Preset drop-down list:
• Illustrator Default: Creates a PDF file in which all Illustrator data is
preserved. PDF files created with this preset can be reopened in
Illustrator without any loss of data.
• High Quality Print: Creates PDFs for desktop printers and proofers.
• PDF/X-1a:2001: This method is the least flexible delivery of PDF con-
tent data, but it can be very powerful. It requires that the color of all
objects be in CMYK or spot colors. Elements in RGB or Lab color
spaces or tagged with ICC profiles are prohibited. It also requires
that all fonts used in the job be embedded in the supplied PDF file.
• PDF/X-3:2002: This method of creating a PDF has slightly more flexi-
bility than the X-1a:2001 method in that color managed workflows
are supported elements in Lab, and attached ICC source profiles may
also be used.
• PDF/X-4:2007: This preset is based on PDF 1.4, which includes sup-
port for live transparency. PDF/X-4 has the same color management
and International Color Consortium (ICC) color specifications as
PDF/X-3. You can open PDF files created with PDF/X-4 compliance in
Acrobat 7.0 and Reader 7.0 and later.
• Press Quality: Creates a PDF file that can be printed to a high-
resolution output device. The file will be large, but it will maintain all
the information that a commercial printer or service provider needs

to print your file correctly. This option automatically converts the
color mode to CMYK, embeds all fonts used in the file, prints at a
higher resolution, and uses other settings to preserve the maximum
amount of information contained in the original document.
• Smallest File Size: Creates a low-resolution PDF suitable for posting
on the internet or sending via e-mail.
Before creating an Adobe PDF file using the Press preset, check with
your commercial printer to find out what the output resolution and
other settings should be.
• Standard: Don’t pick a PDF/X standard unless you have a specific
need or have been requested to. Through the Standard drop-down
menu, you can select the type of PDF/X file you want to create.
• Compatibility: Different features are available for different versions,
such as the ability to support layers in Version 6 or higher. If you
want the most compatible file type choose Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4). But if
you want to take advantage of layers or need to preserve spot colors,
you must choose Acrobat 6 or higher.
3. Click Save PDF to save your file as a PDF.
If you want to be able to reopen the PDF file and edit it in Illustrator,
make sure that you leave the Preserve Illustrator Editing Capabilities
check box selected in the Adobe PDF Options dialog box. 
In the Adobe PDF Options dialog box, to the left of the preset choices are
options that you can change to customize your settings. Scan through them
to see how you can change resolution settings and even add printer’s marks.
Take a look at Book VII on Acrobat to find out more about the additional 
PDF options.
Want a Press Quality PDF, but don’t want to convert all your colors to
CMYK? Choose the Press setting and then click the Output options. In 
the Color section, select No Conversion from the Color Conversion drop-
down list.
Saving Your Artwork for the Web
If you need to save artwork for the Web, there is no better feature than Save
For Web. The Save For Web dialog box gives you a preview pane where you
can test different file formats before you actually save the file.

Saving Your Artwork for the Web
594
To save an Illustrator file that you intend to use in a Web page, just follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save For Web & Devices.
The Save For Web & Devices dialog box appears, showing your artwork
on the Optimized tab.
2. Choose a tabbed view: Original, Optimized, 2-Up, or 4-Up.
As a default, you see the artwork in the Optimized view, which previews
the artwork as it will appear based upon the settings on the right. The 2-
Up view is probably the best choice because it shows your original
image versus the optimized version.
3. Choose a setting for your file from the options on the right.
If you want to make it easy on yourself, choose a preset from the Preset
drop-down list. Keep in mind these points:
• GIF is generally used for artwork with spans of solid color. GIF is not
a lossy format. You can make your artwork smaller by reducing the
number of colors in the image — hence the choices, such as GIF 64
No Dither (64 colors). The lower the amount of colors, the smaller
the file size. You can also increase or decrease the number of colors
in the file by changing the preset values in the Color text field or by
using the arrows to the left of the Color text field.
• Dithering tries to make your artwork look like it has more colors by
creating a pattern in the colors. It looks like a checkerboard pattern
up close and even far away, as shown in Figure 13-3. It also makes a
larger file size, so why use it? Most designers don’t like the effect and
choose the No Dither option.
• JPEG is used for artwork that has subtle gradations from one shade
to another. Photographs are often saved in this format. If you have
drop shadows or blends in your artwork, you should select this
format. JPEG is a lossy file format, meaning that it will reduce your
image to a lesser quality and can create odd artifacts in your art-
work. You have choices such as High, Medium, and Low in the
Settings drop-down list. Make sure that you choose wisely. You can
also use the Quality slider to tweak the compression.
Figure 13-3:

• PNG-8 is very similar to a GIF file format. Unless you have a certain
reason for saving as PNG-8, stick with the GIF file format.
• PNG-24 supports the best of two formats. Not only does the PNG
format support the nice gradients from one tonal value to another
(like JPEG), but it also supports Transparency (like GIFs). Not just
any old transparency, if you make an object 50% transparent in
Adobe Illustrator, then choose to save it, using Save For Web &
Devices, as a PNG-24 file with the Transparency check box checked,
the image will show through to any other objects underneath it on its
destination page.
• The SWF graphic file format is a version of the Adobe Flash Player
vector-based graphics format. Because a SWF file is vector-based, its
graphics are scalable and play back smoothly on any screen size and
across multiple platforms. Using the Save For Web & Devices dialog
box, you can save your image directly to SWF from Adobe Illustrator.
With the SWF choice, you can preview and make decisions as to how
you want to export to the file, as well as make decisions about how
layers should be exported.
• Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an emerging Web standard for two-
dimensional graphics. SVG is written in plain text and rendered by
the browser, except that in this case, it’s not just text that is ren-
dered but also shapes and images, which can be animated and made
interactive. SVG is written in XML (Extensible Markup Language).
You can choose to save Scalable Vector Graphics out of Adobe
Illustrator using the Save For Web & Devices dialog box.
• Use the Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format (WBMP)
format for bitmap images for mobile devices.
4. When you’re satisfied with your chosen settings, save your file by
clicking Save.
When saving illustrations for the Web, you should keep the following points
in mind, which will make the whole process much easier for you and anyone
who uses your illustrations:
✦Keep it small. Don’t forget that if you’re saving illustrations for a Web
page, many other elements will be on that page. Try to conserve on file
size to make downloading the page quicker for viewers using dial-up
connections. Most visitors won’t wait more than 10 seconds for a page
to download before giving up and moving on to another Web site.
As you make your choices, keep an eye on the file size and the optimized
artwork in the lower-left corner of the preview window. On average, a
GIF should be around 10K and a JPEG around 15K. These rules aren’t
written in stone, but please don’t try to put a 100K JPEG on a Web page!

Flattening Transparency
596
You can change the download time by selecting the panel menu in the
upper-right corner of the Save For Web & Devices dialog box and choos-
ing Optimize to File Size to input a final file size and have Illustrator
create your settings in the Save For Web & Devices dialog box.
✦Preview the file before saving it. If you want to see the artwork in a
Web browser before saving it, click the Preview In Default Browser
button at the bottom of the Save For Web & Devices dialog box. The
browser of choice appears with your artwork in the quality and size in
which it will appear. If you have no browser selected, click and hold
down the Preview In Default Browser button to choose Other and then
browse to locate a browser that you want to use for previewing. Close
the browser to return to the Save for Web & Devices dialog box.
✦Change the size. Many misconceptions abound about size when it
comes to Web artwork. Generally, most people view their browser win-
dows in an area approximately 700 x 500 pixels. Depending on the screen
resolution, this may cover the entire screen on a 14-inch monitor, but
even viewers with 21-inch monitors with a high resolution often don’t
want to have their entire screen covered with a browser’s window, so
they still have a browser window area of around 700 x 500 pixels. When
choosing a size for your artwork, use proportions of this amount to help
you. For example, if you want an illustration to take up about a quarter
of the browser window’s width, you should make your image about 175
pixels wide (700÷4 = 175). If you notice that the height of your image is
over 500 pixels, you should whittle the height down in size as well, or
your viewers will have to scroll to see the whole image (and it will prob-
ably take too long to download!).
Use the Image Size tab to input new sizes. As long as the Constrain
Proportions check box is selected, both the height and width of the
image will be changed proportionally. Click the Apply button to change
the size but do not close the Save For Web & Devices dialog box.
✦Finish the save. If you aren’t finished with the artwork, but you want to
save the settings, hold down the Alt (Option on a Mac) key and click the
Remember button. (When you’re not holding down the Alt or Option
key, the Remember button is the Done button.) If you’re finished, click
the Save button and save your file in the appropriate location.
Flattening Transparency
You may find that all those cool effects that you put into your illustration
don’t print correctly. When you print a file that has effects such as drop
shadows, cool gradient blends, and feathering, Illustrator turns transparent

areas that overlap other objects into pixels and leaves what it can as 
vectors — this process is called flattening.
So what actually is flattening? Look at Figure 13-4 to see the difference
between the original artwork (on the left) and the flattened artwork (on the
right). Notice that in Figure 13-4, when the artwork was flattened, some 
of the areas turned into pixels. But at what resolution? This is why you 
want to know about flattening, so that you can determine the quality of art
yourself — before getting an unpleasant surprise at the outcome.
Flattening a file
If you’ve taken advantage of transparency or effects using transparency
(which we discuss in Chapter 11 of this minibook), follow these steps to get
the highest quality artwork from your file:
1. Make sure that you’ve created the artwork in the CMYK mode.
You can change the document’s color mode by choosing File➪Document
Color Mode.
2. Choose Effects➪Document Raster Effects Settings.
The Document Raster Effects Settings dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 13-5.
3. Choose the resolution that you want to use by selecting an option in
the Resolution area.
As a default, the rasterization setting is the Screen (72 ppi) option,
which is fine for the screen. Select the Medium (150 ppi) option for print-
ers and copiers and select the High (300 ppi) option for press.

and after

4. Choose whether you want a white or transparent background.
If you select the Transparent option, you create an alpha channel. The
alpha channel is retained if the artwork is exported into Photoshop.
5. You can generally leave the items in the Options section deselected:
• The Anti-Alias check box applies anti-aliasing to reduce the appear-
ance of jagged edges in the rasterized image. Deselect this option to
maintain the crispness of fine lines and small text.
• The Create Clipping Mask check box creates a mask that makes the
background of the rasterized image appear transparent. You don’t
need to create a clipping mask if you select the Transparent option
for your background.
• The Add Around Object text field adds the specified number of pixels
around the rasterized image.
6. Click OK.
The next step is to set the transparency options in the Document Setup
dialog box.
7. Choose File➪Document Setup➪Transparency.
The Export And Clipboard Transparency Flattener Settings options
appear. From the Preset drop-down list, select the Low, Medium, High,

or Custom option. Select the Low option for on-screen viewing, the
Medium option for printers and copiers, or the High option for press.
Choose the Other option if you want to control more of the settings
yourself.
8. Click OK.
If you find yourself customizing the settings on a regular basis, choose Edit➪
Transparency Flattener Presets to create and store your own presets.
You can apply the flattening in several ways. Here are three simple methods.
✦Select the object(s) that require flattening and choose Object➪Flatten
Transparency. Choose one of the default settings or a custom preset that
you created from the Preset drop-down list and click OK.
✦Choose File➪Print and select Advanced from the list of print options 
on the left. Choose a preset from the Overprint and Transparency
Flattener options. If you used the Attributes panels to create overprints
(for trapping used in high-end printing), make sure that you preserve 
the overprints.
Note: Overprints will not be preserved in areas that use transparency.
✦Choose File➪Save As and choose Illustrator EPS. In the Transparency
section of the EPS Options dialog box, choose a flattening setting from
the Preset drop-down list. If your Transparency options are grayed out,
you have no transparency in your file.
Using the Flattener Preview panel
Want to preview your flattening? Use the Flattener Preview panel by choos-
ing Window➪Flattener Preview.
The Flattener Preview panel doesn’t apply the flattening, but it gives you a
preview based upon your settings. Click the Refresh button and choose
Show Options from the panel menu. Test various settings without actually
flattening the file. Experiment with different settings, and then save your pre-
sets by selecting Save Transparency Flattener Preset from the panel menu.
The saved settings can be accessed in the Preset drop-down list in the
Options dialog boxes that appear when you save a file as an EPS or in the
Document Setup dialog box.
Click the Refresh button after making changes to update the preview.

Zoom in on the artwork by clicking in the preview pane. Scroll the artwork in
the preview pane by holding down the spacebar and dragging. Zoom out by
Alt+clicking (Option+clicking on a Mac).
Printing from Illustrator
Printing from Illustrator gives you lots of capabilities, such as printing com-
posites to separations and adding printer’s marks.
To print your illustration, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print.
2. In the Print dialog box that appears, select a printer if one isn’t
already selected.
3. If the PPD isn’t selected, choose one from the PPD drop-down list.
A PPD is a printer description file. Illustrator needs this to determine the
specifics of the PostScript printer you’re sending your file to. This set-
ting lets Illustrator know whether the printer can print in color, the size
paper it can handle, and the resolution, as well as many other important
details.
4. Choose from other options as follows:
Use the General options area to pick what pages to print. In the Media
area, select the size of media that you’re printing to. In the Options area,
choose whether you want layers to print and any options specific to
printing layers.
5. Click the Print button to print your illustration.
And that’s it. Printing your illustration can be really simple, but the following
list highlights some basic things to keep in mind as you prepare your illus-
tration for printing:
✦Printing a composite: A composite is the full-color image, where all the
inks are applied to the page (and not separated out onto individual
pages, one for cyan, one for magenta, one for yellow, and one for black).
To make sure that your settings are correct, click Output in the print
options pane on the left side of the Print dialog box and select
Composite from the Mode drop-down list.
✦Printing separations: To separate colors, click Output in the print
options pane on the left side of the Print dialog box; from the Mode
drop-down list, choose the Separations (Host-Based) option. Select the

Book IV
Chapter 13

In-RIP Separations option only if your service provider or printer asks
you to. Other options to select from are as follows:
• The resolution is determined by your PPD, based upon the dpi in the
printer description. You may have only one option available in the
Printer Resolution drop-down list.
• Select the Convert Spot Colors to Process check box to make your
file 4-color.
• Click the printer icons to the left of the listed colors to turn off or on
the colors that you want to print.
✦Printer’s marks and bleeds: Click Marks And Bleeds in the print options
pane on the left side of the Print dialog box to turn on all printer’s
marks, or just select the ones that you want to appear.
Specify a bleed area if you’re extending images beyond the trim area of a
page. If you don’t specify a bleed, the artwork will stop at the edge of the
page and not leave a trim area for the printer.
After you’ve created a good set of options specific to your needs, click the
Save Preset button at the bottom of the Print dialog box. Name your preset
appropriately; when you want to use that preset, select it from the Print
Preset drop-down list at the top of the Print dialog box for future print jobs.

f you’re creating a Web site, you don’t really need Adobe Flash CS3. So,
when and why do you use Flash? You use it when you want your Web site
to make greater use of animation, sound, and interactive graphics. Adobe
Flash CS3 Professional is an exceptionally powerful product that can be
used to create rich Internet applications. Developing those kinds of applica-
tions goes beyond the scope of this book. This book is designed to give you
an introductory look at Flash’s basic capabilities. For more in-depth cover-
age on Adobe Flash CS3 Professional, you should check out Flash CS3 For
Dummies, by Ellen Finkelstein and Gurdy Leete (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Understanding What Flash Is and How It Works
If someone asks you what Flash is, you can quickly say, “It’s a Web anima-
tion program.” But that statement, although true, doesn’t do justice to
Flash’s wide-ranging capabilities.
Seeing what Flash can do
Flash is a rich program. Only your creativity limits what you can do with
Flash. The following list points out Flash’s major features and may help you
decide whether you want to use Flash on your Web site:
✦Animate text and graphics, including changing their color and visibility.
✦Create your own graphics or import graphics from another program,
such as Adobe Illustrator CS3 or Adobe Fireworks CS3.

Understanding What Flash Is and How It Works
606
✦Design Web buttons, still or animated, that link users to other pages or
sites or perform other programmed actions.
✦Add sound and video to your Web site.
✦Add interactivity to your site by letting viewers choose where they go
and what they see or hear. You can also create forms for viewers to fill
out, poll viewers’ interests, and customize a site for each viewer.
✦Design more compelling advertisements for your business that you run
online.
✦Create a user interface, including scrollbars, check boxes, list boxes,
forms, and more.
You can design an entire Web site using Flash. For example, you can use
Flash buttons to create your menu and place the content of your Web site on
the Timeline. (The Timeline is the collection of frames and layers that make
up a Flash movie and is covered in more detail in Book V, Chapter 5.) Flash
gives you complete artistic freedom when designing your site, as compared
to designing in HTML, which you may find limiting. For example, HTML sig-
nificantly limits your placement of objects. On the other hand, when using
Flash, you need to be careful that the site displays quickly and that users
can easily navigate it. Also, updating your content and connecting to a data-
base to retrieve content is more complex and time consuming with Flash.
Creating content for a Web site in Flash
Using Flash has two components. First, you create the Flash document and
publish it to a format that a browser can read. Then, you (or others) view the
Flash content in a browser. To create Flash content, follow these basic steps:
1. Create your Flash animation in Flash and save it as a Flash document.
This document has an .fla extension. (Chapters 2 through 6 and
Chapter 8 in Book V explain the features that Flash offers for creating
Flash documents.)
2. Use the Publish command in Flash to save your .fla file as a Flash
movie.
The Flash movie has an .swf extension, and you often hear it called an
SWF file. When you publish the movie, Flash also generates the HTML
code that you need to insert the SWF file into your Web page. See 
Book V, Chapter 7 for a detailed description of how to add Flash movies
to your Web page.
3. Insert the HTML code into your Web page (or create a new Web page
and add the HTML code).
The HTML code refers to the SWF file.

Book V
Chapter 1
Introduction to
Adobe Flash CS3
Comparing Bitmaps and Vector Graphics
607
After taking these three steps, you simply follow the procedures that you use
for any Web site — uploading the HTML and SWF files.
Using Flash on a Web site
To view a Flash movie, you need the Flash Player. Flash Player 9 is the latest
player as of this writing. After you have the Flash Player installed, your
browser automatically uses the player to display the Flash animation. You
can download the Flash Player for free from the following Web site:
www.adobe.com/flashplayer/
Although the vast majority of people who access your Web site have the
Flash Player on their computers already, you may want to include a button
or link on your Web site that connects to this Adobe URL so that people can
easily find and download the player if they need it.
Comparing Bitmaps and Vector Graphics
Most graphics that you see on a Web site are bitmap files that are reduced in
file size so that they can be displayed as .gif or .jpg files. A bitmap is a
graphic image that’s made up of many tiny dots (bits) that are very close
together. The various colored dots create the pattern that your eyes see as 
a picture. When the dots are displayed on a computer screen, they’re called
pixels. To get a bitmap graphic into Flash, you import it. See Book V, Chapter
3 for more details about importing graphics.
Bitmap graphics can create very large file sizes (although compression can
make the files smaller). Large file sizes mean that your Web page takes
longer to display in a Web browser. Bitmaps also don’t scale very well. If you
need to enlarge a bitmap, you start to see the individual dots, which give you
a grainy graphic image.
Flash creates vector graphics. Unlike bitmaps, vector graphics are defined by
equations that specify location, direction, and color. The equations result in
small file sizes, and that small size provides a faster display on your Web
site. And you can easily scale vector graphics. No matter how large or small
you make your graphic, it always looks clear. Finally, with vector graphics,
you can easily transform an image such as a circle into another image, such
as a triangle.
You can’t create all graphics by using vectors. Photographs and other com-
plex designs usually need bitmaps to display them in all their glory. Often,
you use a combination of bitmap and vector graphics to complete your 
Web site.

Exploring Basic Moviemaking Principles
608
Exploring Basic Moviemaking Principles
Flash uses a classic moviemaking structure, which contains the following
components:
✦The Stage: The Stage contains all your content, which includes graphics
and text.
✦Frames: A frame represents a small unit of time, such as 1⁄12 of a second.
Each frame contains a tiny section of the animation.
✦The Timeline: The Timeline contains all the frames. You use the
Timeline to manipulate your content over time and thus create the 
animation.
✦Layers: Layers are collections of linear frames that are all on the same
level. Layers can be moved up or down to change the position of objects
on the Stage relative to each other.
✦Scene: Scenes are discreet collections of layers, and are a great tool to
help you organize your movie.
The Stage
The Stage, shown in Figure 1-1, is a simple rectangle on which you place all
your content. You change the content on the Stage from frame to frame to
create animation. You generally use the drawing and editing tools in the
Tools panel to draw and edit the content on the Stage. In this respect, Flash
is a graphic program like many others. You can create text, circles, lines, and
so on, and you can specify the color of the objects that you create. When
you publish your movie, you can save the graphics in standard Web site
bitmap formats — JPEG, GIF, and PNG.
In the section “Setting document properties,” later in this chapter, we
explain how to specify the size and color of the Stage.
The Timeline and frames
You can think of the Timeline (refer to Figure 1-1) as the frames in a film reel.
The difference is that Flash’s Timeline is electronic, rather than on film. Each
frame covers a specific period of time. The default frame rate is 12 frames
per second (fps). You use the frames in the Timeline to control the flow of
the animation. You click a frame to make it current. By specifying which
frames contain animation, you determine when animation starts and stops.
Book V, Chapter 5 explains more about working with the frames in the
Timeline.

Book V

Layers
In Figure 1-1, you can see the Layer list to the left of the Timeline. Layers are
covered in Book V, Chapter 4, but for now you should understand that you
can separate the content on the Stage into layers. Layers help organize your
content so that your graphics and animations don’t “bump” into each other.
You should also use separate layers for sounds and other interactive ele-
ments in your movie.
Scenes
A scene is simply a way to organize the Timeline. You can use the default
Scene 1 (choose File➪New to create a new Flash movie) and have just one
scene for your entire movie. However, when your animations become more
complex, adding scenes can help you keep track of your movie structure.
You can find out more about scenes in Book V, Chapter 5.
Taking a Quick Tour of the Flash Interface
The Flash interface exists to help you create animation. Although the inter-
face has several components, and you have many options for customizing
Figure 1-1:

Most of the commands that you use in Flash appear on the toolbar. The fol-
lowing list gives you a summary of the menu items and their main features:
✦File: Open, close, and save files; import and export files; print a Flash
document; publish documents (to create SWF movie files); and close
Flash
✦Edit: Undo and redo actions; cut, copy, and paste; delete, duplicate, and
select objects on the Stage; copy and paste frames from the Timelines;
edit symbols (which you can read about in Book V, Chapter 3); set pref-
erences; and create keyboard shortcuts
✦View: Zoom in and out, change how Flash displays objects and text,
choose which parts of the screen you want to display, and snap objects
to pixels on the Stage or other objects
✦Insert: Insert symbols, insert and delete frames on the Timeline, insert
layers, and create animation (see Book V, Chapter 5 to find out how to
create animation)
✦Modify: Edit layers, scenes, the Stage, symbols, frames, and graphic
objects on the Stage
✦Text: Format text
✦Commands: Create automated tasks that you can use repeatedly on a
variety of objects
✦Control: Play and rewind animation, test movies and scenes, activate
some interactive features, and mute sounds
✦Window: Display panels and toolbars
✦Help: Get help on Flash and ActionScript
Most of the menu commands are discussed in detail in the rest of this book.
Table 1-1 lists some of the commonly used keyboard shortcuts for the menu
commands. After you get used to them, you may find using them easier (and
faster) than using the menu. In the section “Creating your own keyboard
shortcuts,” later in this chapter, we explain how you can make keyboard
shortcuts for your particular needs.
You may want to photocopy Table 1-1 and post it near your computer.

Timeline
The Timeline doesn’t tell you what is happening; it tells you when something
is happening. But the Timeline does give you clues about the content of 
your animation. Figure 1-2 shows a Timeline with plenty of action. (Book V,
Chapter 5 tells you all about using the Timeline to create animation.)

Taking a Quick Tour of the Flash Interface
612
If the Timeline isn’t displayed, choose View➪Timeline. Each layer has its own
Timeline so that you can see the sequence of events separately for each layer.
(See Book V, Chapter 4 for more information about the Timeline, layers, and
the Layer list.) The Timeline (see Figure 1-2) has the following features:
✦Layer list: The Layer list helps you organize your content.
✦Insert a layer: Use the New Layer button to add a new layer.
✦Insert Layer Folder: This creates a folder that you can add layers into
for easy management.
✦Delete a layer: Use the Delete Layer button to delete a layer.
✦Playhead: The playhead indicates the current frame.
✦Current frame: The Current Frame box also displays the current frame.
✦Frame rate: The Frame Rate box displays the current frame rate, which
is the number of frames that play per second in an animation.
✦Elapsed seconds: The Elapsed Seconds box displays the number of sec-
onds that have passed from the beginning of the movie to the current
frame, at the current frame rate.
✦Action: A small a in a frame indicates that the frame contains
ActionScript to control the animation.
✦Keyframe with no content: A keyframe is a frame that contains a change
in the animation. If you insert a keyframe but don’t put anything in that
keyframe, the Timeline displays an unfilled circle.
✦Keyframe with content: When a keyframe contains any object, the
Timeline displays a filled circle.
✦Sound: When you insert sound into an animation, the sound’s wave
appears on the Timeline.
✦Motion tween: A motion tween is motion animation that Flash calculates
automatically from the first and last keyframes. The Timeline shows
motion tweens in light blue.
✦Shape tween: A shape tween is shape (morphing) animation that Flash
calculates automatically. The Timeline shows shape tweens in light
green.

The Tools panel
The Tools panel includes all the tools that you need to create and edit graph-
ics. The Tools panel contains the following sections:
✦Tools: Select, draw, and edit graphic objects and text
✦View: Pan and zoom
✦Colors: Specify the color of lines and fills
✦Options: Specify options for the buttons in the Tools section
Figure 1-3 shows the Tools panel in detail, and you can also see the options
for the Brush tool. See Book V, Chapter 2 for further explanation about the
Tools panel.
Getting Organized with Panels
You use panels to specify settings (such as colors) or to view information
about objects. You can access the panels from the Window menu, and panels
also have their own Options menus. Click the menu icon in the upper-right
corner of a panel to display its Options menu.
You can organize the Flash screen for your convenience. For certain tasks,
you may want one group of panels open; for other tasks, you may want a dif-
ferent group available, or none at all. Follow these guidelines when working
with panels:

layout, choose Window➪Workspace➪YourLayoutName (you can choose
a layout name that makes sense to you).
✦Dock: You can dock the panels at the edge of the screen so that they
don’t cover up the Stage. To dock a panel, drag it by its header to the
right or bottom of the screen until it displays a rectangular border. (See
Figure 1-4.) To undock a panel, drag the tab for that panel away from the
edge of the screen.
✦Hide/Display panels: Press F4 to toggle hiding and displaying all the
panels.

You can find more information about specific panels throughout this mini-
book. For example, Chapter 2 includes a discussion of colors as well as the
panels that you need to use to create and work with colors.
The Properties panel
The Properties panel is a special panel that you use almost all the time. The
Properties panel is context sensitive, which means that it changes depending
on what you’re doing. For example, if you’re working with text, you see all
the possible text properties, as Figure 1-5 shows you. If you select a rectan-
gle, you see the properties of that shape. Usually, you keep the Properties
panel open at the bottom of the screen, either expanded or collapsed. The
Properties panel has its own special Expand/Collapse arrow at its lower-right
corner that you use to display additional properties.
To set the properties of an object, select the object and enter the properties
in the appropriate boxes of the Properties panel. You can find specific
details about the Properties panel (for example, the size of the fonts you’re
using in your movie) throughout the rest of this minibook in the context of
the topics of each chapter.
Library
Every Flash document file has its own Library. Whenever you import a
graphic, video, or sound, Flash saves it in the Library. If you save a graphic
object as a symbol (see Book V, Chapter 3 for a description of how to do
this), the object goes in the Library as well. The Library stores every object
that you may use again. These objects all have names so that you can easily
find them.
To use an object from the Library, click the keyframe on the Timeline where
you want the object to appear and then drag the object from the Library
Figure 1-5:

onto the Stage. (Keyframes are explained in Book V, Chapter 5.) You can drag
an object from the Preview window or from the item’s listing. Figure 1-6
shows a Library with several types of objects.
To keep your Library from becoming overwhelming, use the following
Library tools:
✦Use folders: Organize your Library items into folders. To create a new
folder, click the New Folder icon. Then drag items onto the folder’s
name. Double-click a folder to expand or collapse it.
✦Sort: You can alphabetize Library items by any column. Click the head-
ing of the column. To reverse the sort order, click the Sort Order icon.
✦Rename: Double-click any item and type a new name.
✦Delete: Select an item and click the Delete (Trashcan) icon. Flash warns
that you can’t undo this action.
✦Update: If a sound, video, or bitmap file that you have imported has
changed, you can update the Library to use the latest version of that file.
Click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of a panel to display its
Options menu and then choose Update.
You’re not limited to using items in your current document’s Library. You
can open a Library from any Flash document and drag any of its items into
your movie. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library and choose the file. The
new Library opens as a stacked panel on your current Library panel.
To see some sample Library items, choose Window➪Common Libraries. You
can find a good assortment of sounds and symbols that come with Flash.

Viewing the Stage
617
Viewing the Stage
As you work, you often need to zoom in to see part of the Stage more closely
or zoom out to see the entire Stage. You may also want to pan — to move the
display in any direction.
At the upper-right corner of the Timeline, you can find the Zoom drop-down
list, as Figure 1-7 shows you. Click the arrow to set the zoom percentage;
choose a higher zoom setting to see objects on the Stage more clearly.
You can also zoom in and out by using the Zoom tool in the View section of
the Tools panel, which you can see in Figure 1-8. Follow these steps to use
the Zoom tool:
1. Choose the Zoom tool.
The Options section displays the plus and minus icons.
2. Choose the plus icon if you want to zoom in or the minus icon if you
want to zoom out.
3. Click anywhere on the Stage to zoom in or out.
To pan, choose the Pan tool in the View section of the Tools panel and drag
on the Stage in any direction. You can also use the scrollbars to pan.
If you’re not in the Text tool, you can hold down the spacebar to turn the
cursor into the Grabber hand, which enables you to move the stage all
around your window in any direction.

steps:
1. Choose Window➪Properties➪Properties to display the Properties
panel, if it isn’t already open.
If the Properties panel isn’t expanded, click its title bar to expand it.
2. Click the Stage to make sure that no other object is selected.
The Properties panel looks like the one shown in Figure 1-9.
3. To change the Stage size, click the Size button.
The Document Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 1-10, opens.
4. Add a title and description for your document in the appropriate
fields.
5. Type the new width and height of the Stage in the Dimensions text
fields.
6. To change the frame rate (the speed at which Flash plays the frames),
type a new number in the Frame Rate text field.
The default is 12 frames per second (fps).

T
his chapter shows you how to use the drawing and editing tools in
Adobe Flash CS3 to create graphics and text. To produce great anima-
tion, you need great graphics.
Choosing When to Use the Flash Tools
Book V, Chapter 1 explains the difference between vector and bitmap graph-
ics. Use the Flash drawing tools when you want to create vector graphics for
fast download times.
To create more detailed graphics, you may want to use Illustrator CS3
because it has more advanced creation and editing tools. You may also want
to use this program to edit existing bitmaps. On the other hand, you may
have bitmaps, such as a photograph or complex logo, that you can get only
as a bitmap. To use any bitmap, import it. (See Book V, Chapter 3 for the
scoop on importing graphics.)
Creating Shapes and Text
You use the Tools panel to create shapes and text in Flash. See Figure 2-1 for
the details of the Tools panel. The Tools section of the Tools panel offers
many tools for creating and editing images. Most tools have options that
specify how the tool works.

Creating Shapes and Text
624
When creating shapes in Flash, you need to keep in mind what happens
when two or more shapes touch:
✦If the shapes are the same color: They combine. You can use this tech-
nique to create complex shapes.
✦If the shapes are different colors: The top shape replaces and cuts out
the overlapping part of the bottom shape.
✦If you use the Pencil or Line tool to intersect any other shape: The line
and other shape are cut at their intersection.
If you don’t see the Tools panel, choose Window➪Tools or press Ctrl+F2 to
make it visible.
Line tool
The Line tool draws straight lines. You can continue to draw connected lines
to create any shape you want.
To draw a line, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Line tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a color by clicking the Stroke 
Color box.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties (or press
Ctrl+F3) to make it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. A stroke is another word for a line or the outline of any shape in
Flash.

ing the mouse button down) to the ending point.
6. Release the mouse button.
To constrain the line to multiples of 45 degrees, press Shift while dragging.
Oval tool
An oval has both a stroke (outline) and a fill color. Use the Oval tool to draw
ellipses and circles, following these steps:
1. Choose the Oval tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a stroke color by clicking the
Stroke Color box and choosing a color.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. As with the Line tool, you can also set a stroke weight and style.
3. From the Properties panel, choose a fill color by clicking the Fill 
Color box.
4. Click the Stage where you want the upper-left portion of the oval to
be and drag (while holding the mouse button down) diagonally to the
lower right.
5. Release the mouse button.
To create a circle, press Shift as you drag the mouse.
Rectangle tool
As does an oval, a rectangle has both a stroke and a fill. You can draw rectan-
gles and squares with the Rectangle tool by following these steps:
1. Choose the Rectangle tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a stroke color by clicking the
Stroke Color box and choosing a color.

Creating Shapes and Text
626
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. As with the Line tool, you can also set a stroke weight and style.
3. From the Properties panel, choose a fill color by clicking the Fill 
Color box.
4. To draw a rectangle with rounded corners, click the Rounded
Rectangle Radius button (the button with the curved black line and
the little blue semi-square underneath it) in the Options section of the
Tools panel, type a radius, and press Enter.
The larger the number entered in the Corner Radius field, the softer the
curve of the rectangle’s edges.
5. Click the Stage where you want the upper-left corner of the rectangle
to be and drag (while holding the mouse button down) diagonally to
the lower right.
6. Release the mouse button.
To create a square, press Shift as you drag the mouse.
In case you want to have greater control over an object, Flash CS3 now has
Rectangle and Oval Primitive tools. Select one of these from the Rectangle
Tools panel, and you can create objects just as you would with the regular
oval and rectangle tools. After you’ve created an object, you can use the
Properties panel to manipulate it, as well as use the Selection and
Subselecttools to transform the object, as shown in Figure 2-2.

5. Enter the number of sides for the polygon or star.
The larger the number of sides, the closer to a circle a polygon looks.
For the star, having more points creates a starburst-like effect.
6. Enter a value for the star point size.
The larger the star point size, the more dull the star becomes, making it
look closer to a circle.
Pencil tool
The Pencil tool works somewhat like a real pencil. You can draw artistic
shapes with it. To draw with the Pencil tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Pencil tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a stroke color by clicking the
Stroke Color box and choosing a color.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. As with the Line tool, you can also set a stroke weight and style.
3. Click the Pencil Mode button in the Options section of the Tools panel,
and from the pop-up menu, choose one of the following:
• Straighten: Straightens wiggly lines and changes sloppy rectangles,
ovals, and triangles to perfect ones
• Smooth: Smoothes out curved lines
• Ink: Slightly smoothes and straightens, but mostly leaves your draw-
ings the same

Creating Shapes and Text
628
4. Click the Stage where you want the drawing to start and drag on the
Stage.
You can draw angles and curves.
5. Release the mouse button.
To constrain each line segment to 90-degree angles, press Shift as you drag
the mouse. To refine how the options work, choose Edit➪Preferences and
click the Editing tab. Use the Smooth Curves and Recognize Shapes drop-
down lists to edit the options described previously. When you’re done, 
click OK.
Pen tool
You can use the Pen tool to draw straight lines and curves. The Pen tool
offers the greatest editing control and the most control over curves. Using
the Pen tool takes some practice (as most users will no doubt be using
either a mouse or a trackpad), but soon you’ll can find it very flexible.
Follow these steps to work with the Pen tool:
1. Choose the Pen tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. From the Properties panel, choose a stroke color by clicking the
Stroke Color box and choosing a color.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. As with the Line tool, you can set a stroke weight and style.
3. You can draw either straight segments or curves, as follows:
• To draw a straight segment: Click the start point and click the end
point. Don’t drag. Click additional points to add segments. Double-
click to finish.
• To draw a curve: Click the start point and move the mouse in the
desired direction that you want the next point of your shape to be;
then, click and drag your mouse in the direction that you want to
create the curve. Let go of the mouse to lock that portion of the
shape and continue clicking and dragging to create additional
curves. Double-click to finish.
To close a figure, place the cursor near the start point until you see a small
circle and then click. Press Shift as you draw to constrain the lines or curves
to 45-degree angles.

on layers)
• Paint Fills: Fills enclosed and blank areas, but doesn’t cover strokes
• Paint Behind: Paints blank areas of the Stage, but doesn’t cover fills
or strokes
• Paint Selection: Fills in a selected area
• Paint Inside: Paints inside any enclosed area where you start your
brush or on the Stage if you don’t start in an enclosed area; doesn’t
cover strokes
4. Choose a brush size by clicking the Brush Size drop-down list in the
Options section of the Tools panel.
5. Choose a brush shape by clicking the Brush Shape drop-down list.

in the Options section. You can then dynamically vary the width of the
brush according to how much pressure you put on the pen as you draw.
6. Click the start point and then drag to draw with the brush.
Press Shift as you draw to constrain your shapes to 90-degree angles.
If you want your gradient fill to be independent of the background fill, make
sure that you don’t have the Lock Fill option button selected. If, however,
you’re creating more than one stroke and you want it to appear as though
the gradient is in the background and being applied to both strokes, select
the Lock Fill option button.

2. From the Properties panel, choose a stroke color by clicking the
Stroke Color box and choosing a color.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
You can also find the Stroke Color box in the Colors section of the Tools
panel. You can set a stroke weight and style as well.
3. Click anywhere on the shape.
If the shape has no stroke outline, Flash adds a stroke. Otherwise, Flash
changes the shape’s color, width, and style to the settings that you
choose.

Text tool
Sooner or later, you may need to explain what all those animations that
you’ve created mean, so you’ll probably need some text. Flash offers many
text options, both simple and advanced. To create text, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
2. In the Properties panel, which you can see in Figure 2-3, specify the
font, size, color, and other properties.
If the Properties panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Properties to make
it appear.
3. Click the Stage and start typing, as follows:
• To specify the width of the text area (when creating a paragraph),
click at the upper-left corner where you want the text to start and
drag to the right margin.
• To create text that expands as you type (for a single line of text), just
click.
You can specify the following text properties in the Properties panel:
✦Text type: Use the Text Type drop-down list to specify one of the follow-
ing types of text:
• Static: Regular text.
• Input: Text that users type in their browser. You can use input text to
make your Web site interactive. Use input text for forms or to enable
users to set values that affect the animation.
• Dynamic: Text that you display from another source, such as
another Web site, another movie (SWF) file, or an external file. You
can use this type of text for weather, sports scores, and so on.

✦Font: The font or typeface. Select from the drop-down list.
✦Font size: Type a number or use the vertical slider to choose a size.
✦Color: Click the Text (fill) Color box to choose a color.
✦Bold/Italic: Click the Bold button or the Italic button to make the text
bold or italic.
✦Justify: Click one of the Justify buttons to make the text justified to the
left, center, or right, or full justified (justified to reach both the left and
right margins).
✦Character spacing: Adjust the tracking, the spacing between a series of
letters.
✦Character position: Select Superscript to create text above the normal
position or Subscript to create text that appears below the normal posi-
tion. For normal text, just keep it at Normal.
✦Auto Kern: Kerning is the spacing between two specific letters. You may
adjust the kerning of certain letters, such as A and V, that appear to be
too far apart. Select the Auto Kern check box to turn kerning on; dese-
lect it to turn kerning off.
✦Aliasing: By default, all text is anti-aliased, or smoothed. If you want the
text to appear jagged, select Bitmap from the available options in this
drop-down list. You can also customize the thickness and sharpness of
the anti-alias by selecting the Custom Anti-Alias option.
✦Format: Click the Format button to open the Format Options dialog box,
where you can set paragraph formatting, as follows:
• Indent: The indentation of the first line of a paragraph.
• Line Spacing: The spacing between lines, measured in points. If your
text is 18 points, for example, set a line spacing of 18 points to
double-space the text.
• Margins: You can set the pixel width for both the right and left 
margins.
Click the Expand/Collapse arrow next to the Properties tab for more
advanced text options.
Modifying Shapes and Text
If you create something on a computer, you inevitably have to change it.
Sometimes you change your mind, and other times you just need to make
adjustments to get the effect that you want.

Selection tool
Before you can change an object, you need to select it. To select an object or
group of objects, choose the Selection tool (the dark arrow at the top left of
the Tools panel) and use one of the following techniques:
✦To select one object: Click the object.
✦To select an object and its stroke: Double-click the object. (Double-
clicking doesn’t work with symbols. See Book V, Chapter 3 for more
about symbols.)
✦To select a portion of an object: Click and drag covering only the por-
tion of the object you want to move. This technique works only for
objects that are not symbols.
✦To select several objects that don’t touch: Click away from the objects
and drag diagonally to create a bounding box around the objects that
you want to select. Flash selects all objects that are completely inside
the box.
See the section “Reshaping with the Selection tool,” later in this chapter, for
information on reshaping objects by using the Selection tool.
The Selection tool has a Snap button in the Options section of the Tools
panel. When you click this button, objects that you move snap to other
objects so that you can attach two objects precisely. The Snap option also
snaps new objects that you create to existing objects.
Lasso tool
You can also select your objects by lassoing ’em. Use the Lasso tool when
you want to select a number of objects but can’t get them in a rectangular
bounding box. You can drag the mouse and create a free-form shape or use
straight-line segments by following these steps:
1. Choose the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
2. Choose the type of lassoing that you want:
• To lasso free-form: Click anywhere on the Stage, drag around 
the objects that you want to select, and then release the mouse
button.
• To lasso with straight-line segments: Choose the Polygon Mode
button from the Options section of the Tools panel. Click anywhere
on the Stage and continue to click at each segment’s end point.
Double-click to finish.

Moving and copying objects
You can move and copy objects on the Stage in many ways. The best method
depends on the circumstances and your personal preferences. Move and
copy objects using the following methods:
✦Select and drag: Use the Selection tool to select an object. Then move
the cursor over the object until you see the four-arrow cursor. Click and
drag to move the object. Press and hold Ctrl while you drag to copy the
object.
✦Arrow keys: Select an object and use the arrow keys to move the object
one pixel at a time in the direction of the arrow.
✦Properties panel: Select an object and open the Properties panel. Click
the Expand/Collapse arrow at the lower-right corner to display the
expanded panel. Use the X and Y text fields to set a new location for the
object.
✦Cut, copy, and paste: Select an object; then press Ctrl+X to move (cut) 
it or Ctrl+C to copy it. If you want to paste the object somewhere else,
click another layer or frame. Then press Ctrl+V to paste the object.
Eraser tool
To delete any object, select it and press Delete. However, to erase part of an
object, use the Eraser tool, following these steps:
1. Choose the Eraser tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select the eraser size and shape from the Eraser Shape pop-up menu
in the Options section of the Tools panel.
3. To specify how the Eraser tool works, choose an option from the
Eraser Mode pop-up menu:
• Erase Normal: Erases anything that you drag across.
• Erase Fills: Erases only fills.
• Erase Lines: Erases only strokes.
• Erase Selected Fills: Erases only selected fills.
• Erase Inside: Erases only fills where you first click. Use this option to
erase only fills inside an enclosed area, leaving other fills alone.
4. With the Faucet option (in the Options section of the Tools panel) dese-
lected, click on the portion of the object (the fill or the stroke) on the
Stage to erase.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 
Graphics Tools
Modifying Shapes and Text
635
To erase an entire fill, select the Faucet option (in the Options section of the
Tools panel) and click the fill. This method is the same as selecting a fill and
pressing Delete, as though the faucet washes away all the color.
Reshaping with the Selection tool
You can reshape and modify objects using the Selection tool when the
objects aren’t selected. You can reshape both end points (including corners)
and middles (whether straight or curved), as Figure 2-4 shows you, in a
couple of ways:
✦End points: Place the cursor over the end point of a line or curve seg-
ment. You see a small corner shape near the cursor. Click on that point
and drag to a new location on the Stage to change the location of the end
point.
✦Middles: Place the cursor over the middle of any line or curve segment.
You see a small curved shape near the cursor. Click on that point and
drag to a new location on the Stage to reshape the segment.
Subselect tool
The Subselect tool looks like the Selection tool, but the Subselect tool is a
white (rather than black) arrow. Both the Selection tool and the Subselect tool
reshape objects, but the Subselect tool uses a more sophisticated technique.
When you use the Subselect tool, the shape displays anchor points that you
can move or delete. When you click an anchor point, tangent lines — lines 
that are parallel to the curve at the anchor point — appear and enable you to
change the direction of the curve. You can reshape strokes or fills that you 
created with the following tools:
✦Pen
✦Oval
✦Pencil
✦Rectangle
✦Line
✦Brush
Figure 2-4:

636
To reshape objects with the Subselect tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Subselect tool from the Tools panel.
2. Click a stroke or the edge of a fill to display the anchor points.
3. Drag any anchor point to modify the shape.
4. To change the direction of a curve, select its anchor curve and then
drag the tangent line’s handles (the dots at either end of the tangent
line).
To delete an anchor, select the object and then click the anchor point that
you want to delete. The anchor point turns dark. Then press Delete.
Free Transform tool
The Free Transform tool is the heavyweight of editing tools — it can do
almost anything. To use this tool, choose it from the Tools panel and select
an object. The object displays a special bounding box that includes handles
and a central transformation point, as you can see in Figure 2-5.
You can use the Free Transform tool in the following ways:
✦Move: Place the cursor over the object. When you see the four-arrow
cursor, click and drag.
✦Rotate: Place the cursor just outside (but not on) any corner handle.
When you see a circular arrow cursor, click and drag.
✦Scale while maintaining proportion: Place the cursor on any corner
handle. When you see a broken two-arrow cursor, click and drag inward
or outward while holding down the Shift key.
✦Scale either the height or width: Place the cursor on any side handle.
When you see a two-arrow cursor, click and drag inward or outward.
✦Skew (slant either horizontally or vertically): Place the cursor any-
where on the bounding box, but not on a handle. When you see the par-
allel line cursor, click and drag in any direction.
Figure 2-5:

637
✦Move the transformation point: Place the cursor on the transformation
point at the center of the bounding box. When you see a small circle
cursor, click and drag in any direction. Flash uses the transformation
point as a base for rotation and scaling.
✦Taper: Choose the Distort option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Place the cursor on any corner
handle and press Shift as you click and drag inward or outward. (See
Figure 2-6 for an example of tapering.)
✦Distort: Choose the Distort option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Click and drag any handle to distort
the bounding box. (See Figure 2-7 for an example of distortion.) Note:
The Distort option works on shapes, but not on symbols (see Book V,
Chapter 3 for more on symbols), text, or groups. (You can find out more
about groups in the “Grouping” section, later in this chapter.)

Modifying Shapes and Text
638
✦Warp: Choose the Envelope option of the Free Transform tool from the
Options section of the Tools panel. Drag any anchor point or tangent
line handle to warp the bounding box.
The Envelope option, which you can see in Figure 2-8, works on shapes, but
not on symbols, text, or groups.
When you select an object — for example, a circle — with the Free Trans-
form tool, you may notice that the tool selects the object, but not the stroke
around the object. To select both the object and its stroke, click the Free
Transform tool and drag it around the entire object. This tool creates one
bounding box for both the fill and the stroke.
Straightening and smoothing with the Selection tool
You can straighten lines and smooth curves with the Selection tool. Both
processes reduce the number of changes in direction. You can repeat the
process until Flash can’t straighten or smooth anymore. Follow these steps
to straighten lines and smooth curves:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select the shape that you want to modify.
3. To straighten, click the Straighten button in the Options section of the
Tools panel. To smooth, click the Smooth button.
4. Continue to click the Straighten or Smooth button until you like the
result.
Optimizing curves
A process called optimizing curves is similar to smoothing curves. Optimizing
a curve reduces the number of individual elements that the curve contains
Figure 2-8:

and can help reduce the size of your Flash document file. Follow these steps to
optimize curves:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the object that you want to optimize.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Optimize.
The Optimize Curves dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-9. You
can select Use Multiple Passes for a slower, more thorough approach. If
you select the Show Totals Message check box, the amount of optimiza-
tion appears after you close the dialog box.
4. Choose the amount of smoothing by using the slider in the dialog box.
5. Click OK.
Carefully check the results after optimizing. Sometimes small objects disap-
pear! If you don’t like the results, choose Edit➪Undo and try again with a dif-
ferent Smoothing setting.
Softening edges
To create a soft look around the edges of a shape, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select a shape.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Soften Fill Edges.
The Soften Fill Edges dialog box opens, as you can see in Figure 2-10.
Figure 2-10:
The Soften
Fill Edges
dialog box.
Figure 2-9:

4. In the Soften Fill Edges dialog box, set the distance.
The default distance is the width of the softened part of the edge, in
pixels.
Flash uses the units that you set in the Document Properties dialog box
to measure the distance. Choose Modify➪Document to change the meas-
urement units.
5. Enter the number of steps, that is, the number of concentric rows in
the softened edge.
6. Select Expand or Inset.
The Expand option creates the softened edges outside the shape. The
Inset option creates the softened edges within the shape.
7. Click OK.
Flipping
You can make symmetric shapes easily by drawing half the shape, copying it,
and flipping the copy either vertically or horizontally. You can then move the
two shapes together, as Figure 2-11 shows you. To flip an object, follow these
steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the object.
3. Choose Modify➪Transform➪Flip Vertical or Flip Horizontal.

Transferring properties with the Eyedropper tool
The Eyedropper tool transfers stroke and fill properties from one object to
another. To transfer properties, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Eyedropper tool from the Tools panel.
2. Select a stroke or fill.
If you select a stroke, the Ink Bottle tool activates. If you select a fill,
the Paint Bucket tool activates.
3. Click another stroke or fill.
Flash transfers the properties of the stroke or fill to the second object.
Grouping
You often want to work with several objects at one time. Instead of having 
to select all the objects each time you want to move or copy them, you can
group them and work with them as one object. To group objects, select them
and choose Modify➪Group (or press Ctrl+G).
You can edit one element of the group by following these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Double-click the group.
Flash dims other objects on the Stage.
3. Edit any element of the group.
4. To return to regular editing, double-click any blank area on the Stage
with the Selection tool.
Alternatively, you can choose Edit➪Edit All to return to regular editing.
To ungroup objects, select the group and choose Modify➪Ungroup (or press
Shift+Ctrl+G).
Breaking objects apart
You can break apart text into letters and then break apart the letters into
shapes. After you break apart letters into shapes, you can edit them like any
other shape. You can also break apart symbols (see Book V, Chapter 3),
groups, and bitmaps. (See the section “Working with bitmap fills,” later in
this chapter, for more information.)

Aligning objects
To get a professional look, you may want to make sure that objects are prop-
erly aligned and equally distributed. To align and distribute objects, follow
these steps:
1. Choose the Selection tool from the Tools panel.
2. Using the Selection tool, select the objects.
3. Choose Window➪Align.
The Align panel, which you can see in Figure 2-12, appears.
4. Choose the options that you want in the Align panel, as follows:
• Use the top row to align the selected objects horizontally or vertically.
• Use the middle row to evenly distribute objects horizontally or verti-
cally by their edges.
• Use the Match Size buttons to match the size of selected objects by
width, height, or both.
• Use the Space buttons to distribute objects by the spaces between
them.
• Use the To Stage button to align or distribute objects relative to the
Stage.
To center an object on the Stage, click the To Stage button on the Align
panel. Then click the middle Align Vertical and Align Horizontal buttons.
However, if you haven’t panned or scrolled your display, you can use a
quicker method — just cut and paste the object. Flash pastes the object at
the center of the display.

Working with Colors
643
Working with Colors
By default, Flash works with a Web-safe palette of 216 colors. These colors
probably appear the same in all browsers. However, you can create your own
colors. You can also design gradients that vary from one color to another. Or
you may want to try the technique of filling objects with bitmap images (which
is explained in the “Working with bitmap fills” section, later in this chapter).
Creating solid colors
You can create a solid color when you need to take more artistic license than
the standard Web-safe palette allows. Follow these steps to create a solid
color:
1. Choose Window➪Design Panels➪Color Mixer.
The Color Mixer panel, which you can see in Figure 2-13 with the Solid
option active, opens.
You can specify colors using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSB (Hue,
Saturation, Brightness) system. You can see the current system by the
letters that are next to the text fields in the panel. In Figure 2-13, you can
tell that the RGB system is active because the text fields are labeled R, G,
and B. To choose a different system, click the menu icon in the upper-
right corner of the panel to open the panel’s Options menu and choose
the color system that you want. You can also use the color space in the
panel to specify a color.
2. Select Solid from the Fill Style drop-down list.
3. Click the Stroke Color or Fill Color icon (to the left of the Stroke or Fill
box), depending on whether you want to change a stroke or a fill.
You can use this color later for either a stroke or a fill if you save the
color as a swatch, as Step 6 explains how to do.
Figure 2-13:
The Color
Mixer panel
is the place
to create
new colors.

Working with Colors
644
4. Type the color specifications in the text fields, or click a color in the
color space and use the slider to make the color lighter or darker.
5. Use the vertical slider next to the Alpha field or text field to set the
transparency of the color.
A higher alpha percent is more opaque.
6. To save the color, create a color swatch by clicking the Options 
menu icon in the upper-right corner of the panel and choosing Add
Swatch.
You can now see your new color displayed in the Stroke Color or Fill Color
box in the Properties panel and in the Colors section of the Tools panel. You
can use any of the tools to work with that color. If you add a color swatch,
you can continue to use that color later by choosing it from the color palette
that opens when you click the Stroke Color or Fill Color box.
Creating gradients
Gradients blend one color (lighter with darker) or many colors in either a
linear or radial (circular) pattern. Gradients give the appearance of shading
and three dimensions. To create a gradient, follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪Design Panels➪Color Mixer.
The Color Mixer panel opens.
2. From the Type drop-down list, select Linear or Radial to specify the
type of gradient that you want to create, as shown in Figure 2-14.
3. Choose a pointer underneath the horizontal gradient bar.
The pointer becomes black when you select it so that you know it’s
active.
Figure 2-14:
Use the
Color Mixer
panel to
create
gradients.

Book V
Chapter 2
Using the 
Graphics Tools

645
4. Use one of the following methods to select a color for that pointer:
• Click the Fill Color box and choose a color.
• Specify a color using one of the methods of creating a new color dis-
cussed in the preceding section.
• Use the color space to specify a color.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for all the pointers.
You add a pointer when you want to add a new color to the gradient.
Three pointers result in a three-color gradient. To add a pointer, click
just beneath the gradient bar where you want the pointer to appear. To
delete a pointer, drag it off the gradient bar.
6. To save the gradient, click the menu icon in the upper-right corner of
the Color Mixer panel and choose Add Swatch from the Options menu
that appears.
Editing fills
After you create your gradient or bitmap fills, you may decide that you want
to change them. (You can find out about bitmap fills in the following section.)
To edit a fill, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Gradient Transform tool from the Tools panel.
If this is the first time you’ve used the tool, you first need to click and
hold down the Free Transform tool. You’ll see the Gradient Transform
tool pop up beneath your cursor. While still holding the mouse down,
drag over the Gradient Transform tool to select it.
2. Click a gradient or bitmap fill.
Flash places a boundary and editing handles around the fill, which vary
with the type of fill, as you can see in Figure 2-15.
Figure 2-15:
When you
edit a fill,
you see an
editing
boundary
around 
the fill.

Working with Colors
646
3. Make one or more of the following changes:
• Move the fill’s center: Drag the small circle at the center of the fill.
• Change the fill’s width or height: Drag the square handle inward or
outward.
• Rotate a fill: Drag the circle on the editing boundary (the endmost
circle for a radial gradient).
• Scale a bitmap fill: Drag the corner square boundary inward or 
outward.
• Scale a radial gradient: Drag the middle circular handle on the edit-
ing boundary inward or outward.
• Skew a bitmap fill: Drag a circular handle on the top or side.
Working with bitmap fills
You can create a fill with a bitmap that you have imported. (See Book V,
Chapter 3 for more on importing graphics.) To create a fill with a bitmap
image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Choose the bitmap file that you want and click Open.
The bitmap appears on the Stage.
3. Choose Modify➪Break Apart.
This action selects the entire image as a fill rather than as a single color
when you use the eyedropper (in Step 5).
4. Choose the Eyedropper tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel.
5. Click the bitmap image.
The Paint Bucket tool is activated, and the Fill Color button (in the
Colors section of the Tools panel and in the Properties panel) displays
the bitmap image.
6. Click the object that you want to fill.
You may have to move the bitmap image that you imported if it covers
your object. The bitmap is tiled — repeated throughout the filled area.

Chapter 3: Working with Symbols
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of symbols
 Getting graphic with graphic symbols
 Animating with movie clip symbols
 Making your site interactive with button symbols
A
symbol is any object or group of objects, an animation, or a Web
button. You give the symbol a name and save it in the Library. (See
Book V, Chapter 1 for a discussion of the Library.) In this chapter, you can
find out about symbols and how to use them.
Appreciating the Importance of Symbols
You need to know about symbols if you want to work in Adobe Flash CS3.
The following are the three types of symbols:
✦Graphic: The simplest type of symbol, and a useful way to save groups
of objects that you want to reuse. You can animate graphic symbols.
✦Movie clip: A little movie that you put inside your big movie. You can
apply ActionScript, Flash’s programming language, to a movie clip or
within a movie clip to specify how it functions. The movie clip has its
own Timeline, and you generally insert the movie clip on the Timeline 
of the main Flash movie to let it play. You can place, or nest, movie clips
inside each other. You may find movie clips useful for building complex
animation and an interactive Web site.
✦Button: You use buttons when you want your site viewers to click to go
to another page or create some other effect. You use ActionScript to
specify what happens when a viewer clicks a button.
The rest of this chapter explains how to create and work with graphic,
movie clip, and button symbols.

Working with Graphic Symbols
648
Symbols are the building blocks of complex graphics and animation in your
Flash documents. Symbols have the following qualities:
✦You can easily use symbols repeatedly by dragging them from the
Library onto the Stage. Each time that you drag something from the
Library onto the Stage, you create an instance of the symbol. You can
resize individual instances.
✦Symbols reduce your file size (for faster browser display) because Flash
only stores the symbol definition once and remembers one object rather
than many.
✦Most animation requires symbols (or text or grouped objects).
✦Symbols keep their integrity, so you can put other objects in front of
them or behind them without the objects being joined or cut out.
Working with Graphic Symbols
You usually create a graphic symbol from objects that you’ve already cre-
ated. For example, you may have a background that consists of a sky, grass,
flowers, and the sun. Saving these objects as a symbol reduces file size and
ensures that if you copy or move the background, all its components come
along for the ride.
Working with instances of symbols
When you drag a symbol from the Library, the copy on the Stage is called an
instance. You can have many instances of one symbol in a Flash document.
You can change an instance so that it differs from its original symbol, and
the original symbol in the Library remains intact. To change an instance,
follow these steps:
1. Select the instance by clicking it on the Stage with the Selection tool.
Remember that changing an individual instance doesn’t change the
symbol itself.
2. Use the Properties panel to do one or more of the following:
• Change the brightness, color, or transparency by selecting an option
from the Color drop-down list. Select Advanced from the Color drop-
down list to change both color and alpha (transparency) at the same
time.
• Change an instance’s type (graphic, movie clip, or button) by select-
ing an option from the Symbol Behavior drop-down list.

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Working with Graphic Symbols
649
3. Use the Free Transform tool (or other editing tools) in the Tools panel
to rotate, scale, or skew the instance.
Creating graphic symbols
To create a graphic symbol from existing objects, follow these steps:
1. Using the Selection tool from the Tools section of the Tools panel,
select the objects that you want to convert to a symbol.
2. Choose Modify➪Convert to Symbol or press F8.
The Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
Some people start the names of their symbols with a code that indicates
the type of symbol. For example, you can start your graphic symbols
with gr_ and then add the name of the symbol. Classifying your symbols
in this way automatically alphabetizes them by their type and helps to
keep clear which type of symbol you’re using.
4. Select Graphic from the Behavior list of symbol types.
5. Click OK.
The objects that you selected are now one object, surrounded by a
selection border. The symbol is also stored, automatically, in the
Library.
You can achieve the same result by creating an empty symbol and then
adding your objects. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol to open the Create New Symbol dialog
box.
The Create New Symbol dialog box is the same as the Convert to Symbol
dialog box (refer to Figure 3-1).
2. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
3. Select Graphic from the Behavior list of symbol types.
Figure 3-1:
Convert an
object to a

Working with Graphic Symbols
650
4. Click OK.
You now find yourself in symbol-editing mode and are no longer on the
main Timeline.
5. Draw the objects for your graphic symbol.
All these objects become part of your symbol. 
Note the cross hairs in the middle of the screen. This is the registration
point. Generally, this is the center point of your symbol. If you move
your object away from that registration point, the symbol will act differ-
ently when you animate it. For example, if you make a square and put
the registration point at the top left, when you rotate the object it will
rotate the square around that point in the top left. 
6. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to exit symbol-editing mode and return
to the main Timeline.
The symbol is now in the Library and disappears from the screen.
Using graphic symbols
To insert an instance of a symbol, drag it from the Library onto the Stage.
You can drag from the symbol’s icon in the Library list or from its preview at
the top of the Library window.
You can also use a graphic symbol (and any other type of symbol) from
another Flash document file by following these steps:
1. Choose Import➪Import to Library.
This step opens the Import to Library dialog box, where you can browse
for Flash files.
2. Choose the file that contains the symbol that you want.
3. Click the Open button.
Flash opens another Library window.
4. Drag symbols from the new Library window onto the Stage.
Editing graphic symbols
If you change the original symbol, every instance of the symbol that you’ve
inserted also changes. This feature can save you a lot of time if you need to
change the shape of all your buttons, for example. To edit a symbol, follow
these steps:
1. Select any instance of the symbol on the Stage.

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
651
Although you start by selecting an instance of the symbol, when you
edit it on the Stage, as Step 2 describes, you’re editing the symbol, not
the instance.
2. Right-click the symbol instance and choose one of the following:
• Edit in Place: This option lets you edit a symbol while still viewing
other objects on the Stage. The other objects are dimmed so that
you can distinguish them from the symbol.
• Edit: If you select this option, you perform your edits in symbol-edit-
ing mode, which lets you edit a symbol separately from the main
Stage and Timeline. You see only the symbol.
• Edit in New Window: This option opens a new window, where you
edit the symbol. You see only the symbol.
3. Edit the symbol by changing its color, shape, or effects.
4. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the main Timeline, or if you
chose Edit in New Window, click the window’s Close button.
You see all the instances of the symbol change to reflect the edits.
To return to individual objects, you can break apart any instance of a
symbol. Select the instance and choose Modify➪Break Apart.
Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
You can use movie clips for a number of reasons and in a number of differ-
ent ways:
✦Use a movie clip to create animation that you want to insert or load onto
the main Timeline.
✦Use a movie clip whenever you need to control its functioning with
ActionScript. (For more information on ActionScript, see Book V, Chap-
ter 8.) For example, you can use ActionScript to control the size or color
of a movie clip. You can also put ActionScript inside a movie clip to tell
the movie to stop at a certain frame. 
✦You can use movie clips to create interface elements, such as check
boxes, radio buttons, and scrollbars. This type of movie clip is called a
component (you can read more about components in Book V, Chapter 8).
✦You can also use movie clip symbols whenever you want to insert anima-
tion into the main Timeline but keep the original movie in the Library for
reuse. Figure 3-2 shows a movie clip in symbol-editing mode that will be
an animation of a bouncing ball. If you want several bouncing balls on
your Web site, you can drag the movie clip onto the Stage as many times
as you want.

Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols
652
You can create a movie clip symbol from scratch or convert animation that
you’ve created on the main Timeline to a movie clip. To create a movie clip
symbol from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol to open the Create New Symbol dialog box.
Make sure that no objects are selected when you perform this step.
2. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
3. Select Movie Clip from the Behavior list of symbol types.
4. Click OK.
You now find yourself in symbol-editing mode and are no longer on the
main Timeline. In Figure 3-2, you can see the movie clip icon and the
name of the movie clip, Bouncing Ball, just below the layer list.
5. Create the objects or animation for your movie clip symbol.
6. Choose Edit➪Edit Document (or press Ctrl+E) to exit symbol-editing
mode and return to the main Timeline.
The symbol is now in the Library and disappears from the screen.

Sometimes you create some animation on the main Timeline and later realize
that you need to turn that animation into a movie clip. Follow these steps to
create a movie clip from an animation:
1. On the layer listing, click the first layer on the list, press Shift, and
then click the last layer.
All the layers are now selected. See Book V, Chapter 4 for coverage of
layers.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Make sure that no single objects on an individual frame are selected
and choose Insert➪New Symbol.
The New Symbol dialog box appears.
4. In the Name text field, enter a name for the symbol.
5. Select Movie Clip from the Behavior list of symbol types.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and enter symbol-editing mode.
7. Click the first frame of the Timeline.
This is the Timeline for the movie clip, not the whole movie.
8. Choose Edit➪Paste in Center.
The frames are copied into the active layer.
9. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the main Timeline of the
movie and exit symbol-editing mode.
The movie clip symbol is now saved in the Library.
10. Delete the original animation by selecting all the layers (as you did in
Step 1) and choosing Edit➪Timeline➪Remove Frames.
You can drag a movie clip onto the Stage just like a graphic symbol. You 
also edit a movie clip in the same way that you edit graphic symbols. See 
the section “Working with Graphic Symbols,” earlier in this chapter, for
detailed steps.
Working with Button Symbols
Buttons are a major component of Web sites. You can use buttons as links 
to move to other pages and sites, and some buttons trigger more complex
actions, such as stopping music or starting an animation.

Working with Button Symbols
654
A button has the following states, which you define when you create the
button:
✦Up: The appearance of the button when the mouse cursor isn’t over the
button.
✦Over: The appearance of the button when the mouse cursor is over the
button, but not clicking it.
✦Down: The appearance of the button when the cursor clicks the button.
✦Hit: The area of the button that responds to the mouse. This area is
invisible. The Hit state is often the same as the Down state because it
just defines the active area of the button.
You may want to use the common technique of designing a button that
changes color or size when you pass the cursor over the button and then
changes again when you click it. This technique provides feedback that the
button has responded to the user. Figure 3-3 shows a button’s four states.
Creating simple button symbols
Creating a button involves designing the look of the button for the first three
states and the size of the button for the Hit state. Often, you add text to the
graphic so that people know what the button is for. Follow these steps to
create a button:
1. Choose Insert➪New Symbol.
The Create New Symbol dialog box appears.
2. In the Name text field, type a name for the button.
3. From the list of behaviors, select Button and click OK.
Figure 3-3:
The four
button
states: Up,
Over, Down,
and Hit.
Each state
has a
slightly
different fill.

Book V
Chapter 3
Working with
Symbols
Working with Button Symbols
655
You now see the Button Timeline. The dot in the Up frame indicates that
the frame is a keyframe. (See Book V, Chapter 5 for more information on
keyframes.) The Up frame is active.
4. Draw the button for the Up state.
You can create the graphic with Flash’s drawing tools, an imported
graphic, or an instance of a symbol.
Place the graphic for all the button states at the center of the display.
(Book V, Chapter 2 explains how to center objects.) If the button images
aren’t all in the same place, the button shifts when the viewer passes the
cursor over or clicks the button.
5. Click the Over frame and choose Insert➪Timeline➪Keyframe.
The graphic that you created for the Up state in Step 4 is still on the
Stage.
6. Draw the button for the Over state.
Use the graphic for the Up state and change it (or leave it the same, if
you want), or delete the graphic and draw a new one in its place.
7. Click the Down frame and choose Insert➪Timeline➪Keyframe.
8. Create the graphic for the Down state (as in Step 6).
9. Click the Hit frame and choose Insert➪Timeline➪Keyframe.
10. Create the shape that defines the active area of the button.
You want this shape to completely cover all the graphics of the other
states. Usually, you need only a rectangle or circle. If you ignore the Hit
frame, Flash uses the boundary of the objects in the Up frame.
If you use text for the button, viewers have to hit the letters precisely,
unless you create a hit area around the text.
11. Choose Edit➪Edit Document to return to the regular Timeline.
To place a button on the Stage, use the Selection tool to drag the button
from the Library to create an instance of the symbol. To edit a button,
double-click it in the Library.
Adding pizzazz to buttons
Buttons don’t have to be simple. You can make your buttons more interest-
ing in the following ways:
✦Add a sound: You add a sound to a button’s Timeline in symbol-editing
mode in the same way that you add a sound to a frame on the main
Timeline. See Book V, Chapter 6 for information on adding sounds.

Working with Button Symbols
656
✦Add animation: Create a movie clip symbol, as you can read about in
the section “Creating and Working with Movie Clip Symbols,” earlier in
this chapter. Click the keyframe of the button’s Timeline that you want
to contain the movie clip; for example, click the Over keyframe. Delete
any existing graphic and drag a movie clip symbol that contains anima-
tion from the Library onto the screen.
✦Add interactivity: In order for the button to do something, it needs
some ActionScript. Drag an instance of the button onto the Stage and
select that instance by clicking it with the Selection tool. Then use the
Actions panel to add ActionScript to the button. 
Testing buttons
After you create a button, you should drag an instance of it onto the Stage
and test it. To test simple buttons, follow these steps:
1. Choose Control➪Enable Simple Buttons.
2. Pass the cursor over the button and click it to see whether the effects
work.
3. To select the button by clicking it, choose Control➪Enable Simple
Buttons again to disable the button.
If your button contains movie clips, you need to test the entire movie to test
the button. Choose Control➪Test Movie and test the button. To close the
movie window, click its Close button.

Chapter 4: Making Your 
Life Easier with Layers
In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with layers
 Adding depth to your work with layers
 Getting what you need from your layer options
 Organizing your layers in folders
You can use layers to organize your Adobe Flash document. Layers are
an important part of creating a movie for the following reasons:
✦Layers keep objects from bumping into each other. If you draw two cir-
cles and overlap them, they either merge or one creates a cut-out of the
other. However, if you put the two circles on two separate layers, they
each remain whole.
✦Each animated object needs its own layer. If you want to manipulate
more than one object on the Stage at a time, you need to create a new
layer.
✦ActionScript and sounds should have their own layer. This lets you
easily find and troubleshoot any problems as well as avoid potential
conflicts.
✦Special types of layers let you create special effects:
• Mask layers: Mask layers create a “keyhole” through which you can
see layers beneath it.
• Guide layers: Guide layers direct animation along a path.
In addition, you can use layers for your own organizational purposes. For
example, you can put text on a separate layer. Then, to focus on just the
text, you can hide all the other layers. In this chapter, we explain how to
create and manage layers.
Layers add a third dimension to the organization of your Flash document. The
Stage lays out your graphics in the horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis)
dimensions. Using layers is like adding a Z-axis, letting you place graphics on
top of each other as if they were on successive transparent sheets.

Working with the Layer List
658
The Timeline, of course, adds the fourth dimension — time. Layers are inti-
mately connected to the Timeline. For each layer, Flash adds a row of frames
in the Timeline.
Working with the Layer List
You work with layers on the Layer list, which you can find to the left of the
Timeline, as shown in Figure 4-1. The Layer list contains the following fea-
tures:
✦Default layer: You start a new movie with the default layer, Layer 1.
✦Active layer: The active layer is highlighted in gray. When you create
objects, they go on the active layer.
✦Show/Hide Layers: You can show or hide objects on any layer by click-
ing the Show/Hide icon for that layer.
✦Lock/Unlock Layers: You can lock any layer so that you can’t select or
edit objects. Click the Lock icon for that layer. To unlock a layer, click
the Lock icon again.
✦Display Outlines: You can display objects on a layer as outlines. Each
layer uses a different outline color. Outlines may help you see objects on
all layers more clearly. Click the Outlines icon for any layer.
✦Insert Layer: To insert a layer, click the Insert Layer button below the
Layer list.
✦Add Motion Guide: To add a motion guide layer, click the Add Motion
Guide button below the Layer list. See the section “An introduction to
guide layers,” later in this chapter, for more information on guide layers.
✦Insert Layer Folder: You can organize layers into folders. Click the
Insert Layer Folder button below the Layer list.
✦Delete Layer: To delete a layer, select it and click the Delete Layer
button, or drag the layer to the Delete Layer button.
Figure 4-1:
Use the
Layer list to
manage
your layers.

Book V
Chapter 4
Making Your Life
Easier with Layers
Working with Layers
659
Working with Layers
When you open a new movie, it has one layer, called Layer 1. As you work,
you create, delete, move, and copy layers. You also name your layers.
Choose a naming system that makes sense to you. Note: If you make the
names too long, you can’t see the whole name in the Layer list, so don’t get
too extravagant. You can drag the right border of the Layer list to the right
to see more of the layer names.
Creating layers
When you need to create a new layer, click the Insert Layer button at the
bottom of the Layer list (refer to Figure 4-1) or choose Insert➪Timeline➪
Layer. The new layer appears above the active layer and becomes the active
layer.
You can also create a new layer by right-clicking (or Ctrl+clicking on a Mac) a
layer in the Layer list and selecting Insert Layer from the contextual menu
that appears.
Rename the new layer from its default name (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on)
immediately after you create it to avoid any confusion about what you’re
putting on that layer. Double-click the layer name, type a new name, and
press Enter.
Using layers
When you draw an object, it appears on the active layer, which is the layer
that is highlighted and has a pencil icon next to its name in the Layer list. To
draw on a different layer, click the name of the layer that you want to use.
When you click a new layer, Flash selects all the objects on that layer. To
deselect the objects, click any empty area (on the Stage or in the gray space
around the Stage).
Editing layers
You often need to make changes to layers or move objects from one layer to
another. You need to keep your layers organized to keep your entire movie
under control.
Selecting layers
When editing layers, you may want to select more than one layer at a time,
such as when you need to move more than one layer. To select a group of
layers that are contiguous (meaning grouped together in a stack), click the

Working with Layers
660
first layer name on the Layer list, press and hold down Shift, and click the
last layer of the group. To select layers that aren’t contiguous, click the first
layer, press and hold down Ctrl, and click any additional layers that you
want to select.
Moving objects from one layer to another
You often draw objects before you realize that you need them on a separate
or different layer. For example, you can only have one object on a layer that
you’re animating. If you draw additional objects on that layer, you should
move them to another layer. First create a new layer, if you don’t have one
available. (See the section “Creating layers,” earlier in this chapter.) To move
objects from one layer to another, follow these steps:
1. Select the frames that represent the objects that you want to move by
using the Selection tool.
The layer that contains the objects is active and highlighted gray. To
select more than one frame in a sequence, select the first frame, press
and hold down Shift, and then select the last frame.
2. Choose Edit➪Cut.
3. In the Layer list, click the layer to which you want to move the
objects.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste in Place.
The objects appear to be in the same location, but they’re now on a new
layer.
Distributing to layers
In one of Flash CS3’s great features, you can distribute all objects on a layer
to separate layers. For example, to animate each letter of a word, you can
put each letter on a separate layer. You may want to animate the letters of
the word now so that each letter flies onto the Stage separately. Follow these
steps to distribute objects to separate layers:
1. Select the text or objects by using the Selection tool.
For the purposes of this example, select the Text tool from the Tools sec-
tion of the Tools panel, type now in a single frame, and then select the
text.
2. If you’re working with text, choose Modify➪Break Apart. Otherwise,
skip to Step 3.
You see a separate box around each letter. Each letter is now a separate
object.

Book V
Chapter 4
Making Your Life
Easier with Layers
Working with Layers
661
3. Choose Modify➪Timeline➪Distribute to Layers.
Each object or letter is now on a separate layer. Flash automatically cre-
ates the layers for you. In the “now” example, Flash creates three layers,
named n, o, and w, for each of the three letters.
The objects also remain on their original layer. Because you won’t be
needing the entire object any longer, you generally want to delete the
original layer and keep only the copies on the individual layers.
Renaming layers
If the content of a layer changes, you probably want to rename the layer to
something appropriate to its new content. To rename a layer, double-click
the layer name in the Layer list, type the new name, and press Enter.
Deleting layers
To delete a layer, select the layer in the Layer list and click the Delete button
(it looks like a trash can) at the bottom of the list. (Refer to Figure 4-1.)
Deleting a layer deletes everything on that layer. You may not be able to see
everything on the layer because you see only what is on the Stage in the cur-
rent frame. To see everything on a layer throughout the Timeline, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click the layer name in the Layer list and choose Hide Others
from the contextual menu that appears.
2. Click the first frame on the Timeline.
3. Press Enter to run the animation.
Copying layers
You can copy an entire layer, and if you do, all the objects on that layer are
copied as well. Follow these steps to copy a layer:
1. Select the layer by clicking the layer’s name in the Layer list.
Selecting the layer selects all the objects on the layer.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Choose Insert➪Timeline➪Layer to create a new layer.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste in Center.

Working with Layers
662
Reordering layers
Flash displays objects in the order of their layers, from the top down. In
other words, objects on the top layer appear in front of objects on the next
layer. You can reorder the Layer list to change which objects appear in front
on the Stage. See Figure 4-2 for an example.
To move a layer to a different spot in the Layer list, click and drag the layer’s
name to the location that you want the layer to appear and then release the
mouse button.
An introduction to guide layers
A guide layer is a special type of layer that’s invisible when you publish your
Flash document and play it as a movie. Guide layers have the following main
purposes:
✦Drawing guide: You can place gridlines on the Stage to help you lay out
the objects on the Stage, or you can import a bitmap and use it as a
guide to help you draw using the graphics tools. The content on the
guide layer is invisible when you publish the movie, but having the extra
layer helps you draw.
✦Motion guide: You can place a path on a guide layer that controls the
animation of an object. You can read more about this process in Book V,
Chapter 5.
To create a drawing guide layer, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Layer button on the Layer list.
2. Right-click the layer and choose Guide from the contextual menu that
appears.
The layer icon changes to the guide icon that looks like a hammer.
Using mask layers
A mask layer sits on top of other layers, and acts, you guessed it, like a mask!
A mask layer hides everything on its connected masked layers, except
what’s inside the objects that are on the top mask layer. It, in effect, masks
the content on the lower layers. You can use masks to create a spotlight
effect, where you only see what’s in the spotlight and everything else is
hidden. You can see this effect in Figure 4-3, where the circular mask hides
everything inside of the circle. The circle is on a mask layer, and what you
see inside the circle is on a masked layer.

Changing Layer Options
665
To create a mask layer, follow these steps:
1. On the top layer of the Layer list, create the objects that you want to
be visible through the mask.
2. With the top layer selected, click the Add Layer button at the bottom
of the Layer list.
3. Draw a shape, such as a circle, on this new layer.
4. Right-click the new layer and choose Mask from the contextual menu
that appears.
In the Layer list, the mask layer is locked (meaning it can’t be edited) by
default, and the masked layer is both locked and indented, showing that
it’s connected to the mask layer above it. (Refer to Figure 4-3.)
To edit a mask or masked layer, click the lock next to the layer name in the
Layer list. Unlocking these layers removes the mask effect. After you finish
editing, click the lock column next to the layers’ names again to redisplay
the mask effect.
To link a layer to a mask layer, drag the layer directly underneath a mask
layer. The layer is indented. To display the mask effect, make sure that the
layer is locked by clicking it under the Lock column in the Layer list.
Changing Layer Options
You can control the visibility, editability, and display of objects on layers.
These tools can really help you when you’re trying to isolate certain objects
for editing or animation.
Altering the visibility of objects
You can hide all the objects on a layer. If you have a lot of objects on the
Stage and want to edit objects on one layer, you can hide other layers that
you don’t need to see at the moment.
Don’t forget about objects on hidden layers. These objects still appear in
your published movie.
To hide a layer, click beneath the Eye icon on the layer’s row. An X appears
in the Eye column to show you that the layer is hidden. Click the X to unhide
the layer.
To hide all layers except one, right-click the layer that you want to see and
choose Hide Others from the contextual menu that appears.

Changing Layer Options
666
Locking and unlocking layers
You can lock the objects on a layer so that you can’t edit them. You may 
find yourself accidentally selecting objects that you want to leave alone. 
This can get annoying, but you can easily avoid the situation by locking 
that layer.
To lock a layer, click beneath the Lock icon on the layer’s row. A lock
appears in the Lock column. Click the lock to unlock the layer.
To lock all layers except one, right-click the layer and choose Lock Others
from the contextual menu that appears.
Setting layer properties
Many of the layer controls described in this chapter all appear in the Layer
Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4. Most of the time, you just use
the controls on the Layer list or the contextual menu that you see when you
right-click a layer. However, the Layer Properties dialog box does have some
unique features.
To open the Layer Properties dialog box, select the layer that you want to
modify and choose Modify➪Timeline➪Layer Properties. You can use this
dialog box to do the following things:
✦Rename the layer: Type a new name in the Name text field.
✦Show/Hide the layer: Select or deselect the Show check box.
✦Lock/Unlock the layer: Select or deselect the Lock check box.
✦Change the type of layer: You can turn a layer into a guide, guided,
mask, masked, or folder layer.
✦Change the outline color: Click the Outline Color swatch to choose a
new color.
✦Turn outlines on/off: Select or deselect the View Layer as Outlines
check box.
✦Change layer height: Select a percentage from the Layer Height drop-
down list. This percentage can increase the physical size of the layer to
make it more viewable.
When you finish making changes, click OK to close the Layer Properties
dialog box.

Using Folders to Manage Layers
667
Using Folders to Manage Layers
If you have many layers, you can organize them into folders. For example,
you may want to put all your layers containing text in one folder.
To create a folder, click the Insert Layer Folder icon at the bottom of the
Layer list. A new folder appears above the current layer. Double-click the
folder name and enter a name that describes the folder’s contents.
Use the following tips to manage folders:
✦Put layers in a folder: Drag layers onto the folder’s row.
✦Collapse and expand individual folders: Click the arrow at the left of
the folder’s icon.
✦Expand and collapse all folders: Right-click the Layer list, and choose
Expand All Folders or Collapse All Folders from the contextual menu
that appears.
✦Remove a layer from a folder: Expand the folder, if it isn’t already
expanded, and drag the layer above the folder name or to another loca-
tion where it doesn’t darken a folder.
✦Hide or lock an entire folder and its layers: Click beneath the Eye or
Lock icon on the folder’s row.
✦Reorder folders: You can change the order of folders, which also
changes the order of the layers contained in the folder relative to other
folders. Just drag any folder up or down.
✦Delete folders: Select the folder and click the Delete (trash can) icon.
Deleting a folder deletes all the layers in the folder and everything on those
layers. Flash warns you of this fact if you try to delete a folder.

 Touring the Timeline
 Using frames and keyframes
 Approaching animation frame by frame
 Creating tweened animation
 Making interactive animation
 Working with scenes
A
dobe Flash CS3 is basically an animation program, so this chapter
focuses on animation, the central purpose of Adobe Flash CS3. In this
chapter, we provide the information that you need to create motion and
shape animation.
Getting Familiar with the Timeline
The Timeline lays out your animation in time. In order to animate, you need
to be thoroughly familiar with the Timeline (shown in Figure 5-1) and its spe-
cial coding.
As you can see in Figure 5-1, every fifth frame on the Timeline is numbered
and each layer has its own row in the Timeline. (For more information on
layers, see Book V, Chapter 4.)
Figure 5-1:
The Timeline
provides a
great deal of
information
about your
animation.

Getting Familiar with the Timeline
670
If the Timeline isn’t visible, choose Window➪Timeline (Ctrl+Alt+T). You can
collapse the Timeline by clicking its Collapse/Expand arrow at the left side of
its title bar.
Understanding the frame rate
The frame rate is the speed at which Flash plays the animation. The default
frame rate is 12 frames per second (fps). You can have only one frame rate
per document. To change the frame rate, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Frame Rate box at the bottom middle of the Timeline.
The Document Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the Frame Rate text field, enter a new number in frames per
second.
3. Click OK.
When you use a frame rate that’s too slow, the animation appears jerky.
Increasing the frame rate may make animation appear smoother, but a frame
rate that’s too fast can appear blurred. The default frame rate of 12 fps is a
good place to start.
The Internet connection rate and the size of the file also affect the rate of
animation. A large file (often because of large graphics or sounds) and a slow
Internet connection can make the animation stutter. Your viewers can get the
best results if you reduce the size of the file as much as possible. In Book V,
Chapter 7, we explain how to optimize files for the Web.
Working with the Timeline
You can work with the Timeline in the following ways:
✦Go to a frame: Click the frame on the Timeline to go to a particular
frame. If you want to work on a specific layer, click the frame in that
layer’s row.
✦Change size and appearance of the frames: To modify the frames as
they appear in the Timeline, click the Frame View button in the upper-
right corner of the Timeline and choose one of the options from the
menu. You can change the width and height of the frames, turn coloring
of frames on and off, and choose to display a small thumbnail of the
frame’s content in each frame.
✦Add a label or comment to a frame: To add a label or comment to a
frame in the Timeline, select a frame and type a label name in the Frame
Label text field in the Properties panel.

✦Select frames: Click a frame and drag across the frames you want to
select. (You can also click the first frame, press Shift, and click the last
frame you want to select to select all the frames in between.)
✦Copy and paste frames: Select the frames you want to copy, choose
Edit➪Timeline➪Copy Frames, click where you want the frames to go,
and choose Edit➪Timeline➪Paste Frames.
✦Move frames: Select the frames you want to move and drag them to the
desired location.
✦Add a frame: To add a frame, right-click the frame to the left of where
you want to create a frame and choose Insert Frame from the contextual
menu that appears (or press F5).
✦Delete frames: Select the frames you want to delete. Right-click and
choose Remove Frames (or press Shift + F5).
✦Add a keyframe: Right-click the desired frame and choose Insert
Keyframe from the contextual menu (or press F6).
✦Change the length of an animation: Click and drag the first or last
keyframe of the animation to the right or left.
✦Scroll along the Timeline: Use the horizontal scrollbar to scroll along
the Timeline. Use the Vertical scrollbar (which appears when you have
too many layers to display) to scroll through the layers.
Onion skinning
When you animate an object, you can display some or all of the animated
frames at once, using an effect known as onion skinning. Onion skinning pro-
duces overlapping translucent images like the translucent layers of an onion.
See Figure 5-2 for an example of onion skinning.
To work with onion skinning, use the buttons under the Timeline:
✦Onion skin: Turns on onion skinning and adjusts the Onion markers to
customize the number of frames that display the effect.
✦Onion skin outlines: Displays single-color outlines of your animation.
✦Edit multiple frames: Enables you to edit any of the frames on the
Timeline, regardless of the current frame.
✦Modify onion markers: Displays a menu that enables you to always
show the markers (even when onion skinning is off), anchor the markers
so they don’t follow the playhead (current frame marker), and set the
number of frames that the markers cover.

Using Frames and Keyframes
672
Using Frames and Keyframes
A frame is actually a unit of time, based on your frame rate. You can place
content on any frame, but you can only change content on a keyframe. Use 
a keyframe whenever you want to start or stop an animation or make any
object appear or disappear.
To introduce any new object onto the Stage, you must have a keyframe.
Insert a keyframe by right-clicking the frame where you want the keyframe
and selecting Insert Keyframe from the contextual menu. Click the keyframe
on the layer where you want the object to appear and then do one of the
following:
✦Draw something by using the Flash drawing tools. (See Book V, Chap-
ter 2.)
✦Import a graphic. (See Book V, Chapter 3.)
✦Drag an object onto the Stage from the Library. (See Book V, Chapter 1.)

Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Creating Animation Frame by Frame
673
You can create two types of animation in Flash:
✦Frame-by-frame: In frame-by-frame animation, each frame is a keyframe
and contains a slight change in your objects so that when you play the
Flash document, you see a smooth animation. This type of animation
takes a lot of time and creates bigger files, but you may need to use it to
create complex effects. You do cartooning mostly by using frame-by-
frame animation.
✦Tweening: In tweening, the first and last frames of the animation are
keyframes, and Flash calculates everything in between. You can tween
motion and shapes (morphing). You can create tweening much faster
than frame-by-frame animation, and tweening creates small file sizes.
Tweening does have one down side — you can’t do it with any type of
object except vector graphics.
Creating Animation Frame by Frame
When your animation doesn’t have a simple pattern, such as movement of
one object in a direction or the change of one shape to another shape, you
need to use frame-by-frame animation. A common example of frame-by-frame
animation is cartooning, in which a figure needs to move in complex ways or
a mouth moves in time with speech.
To create frame-by-frame animation, follow these steps:
1. Right-click a frame in the current layer where you want the animation
to start and choose Insert Keyframe (or press F6) from the contextual
menu.
2. Draw or import your image.
Book V, Chapter 2 tells you all about creating graphics. To import an
image, choose File➪Import.
3. Right-click the next frame and choose Insert Keyframe again.
4. Change the graphic slightly to create the second frame of the 
animation.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you complete your animation.
See Figure 5-3 for an example of frame-by-frame animation.
During the process, press Enter to play back your animation and check your
work.

Creating Tweened Motion Animation
674
Creating Tweened Motion Animation
Motion tweening moves a single symbol instance, text object, or grouped set
of objects either in a straight line or along a path that you draw (often with
the Pencil tool).
Although you can motion tween only one object at a time on any layer, you
can tween other objects on other layers to create the overall look of many
objects being animated.
You can also change the size, rotation, skew (slant), color, and transparency
of symbol instances as you motion tween them. To make these changes to
text or groups, convert them to symbols. See Book V, Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of symbols.
Preparing to tween
You can only put one object — symbol instance, text, or group — on the
layer where you’re animating. First, you need to create the object you want
to animate and make sure that nothing else is on that layer. Often, you want
to create a new layer just for your animation.
Figure 5-3:

Book V
Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Creating Tweened Motion Animation
675
Decide how you want your object to move. Do you want its color, size, or
rotation to change? After you decide, you’re ready to tween.
The Flash Controller is like a control panel for a CD or video player. You 
may find the Controller helpful when you animate because it offers controls
for rewinding and playing your animation. To open the Controller, choose
Window➪Toolbars➪Controller.
Creating a simple tween
Before you tween, open the Properties panel by choosing Window➪
Properties. To create a simple motion tween that moves the object along a
straight line, follow these steps:
1. On your animation layer, insert a keyframe where you want the ani-
mation to start.
To add a keyframe, right-click the frame to the left of where you want 
to create a keyframe and choose Insert Keyframe from the contextual
menu.
2. Click the keyframe and create the object or objects that you want to
animate.
You can’t tween two bitmaps or graphics that are not symbols. If you
need to, turn your object or objects into a symbol (see Book V, Chap-
ter 3) or a group (see Book V, Chapter 2). You can tween text without
having to change it. You can also import a graphic or drag an instance 
of a symbol from the Library onto the Stage.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want the animation to end.
The longer the span of frames, the slower the animation. You can always
adjust the length of a tween later, as you can read about in the “Working
with the Timeline” section, earlier in this chapter.
4. Click the last keyframe and then move the object to its new location
by using the Selection tool.
At this point, you can also change the object’s color properties and
transparency by using the Color box in the Properties panel. In addition,
you can use the Free Transform tool or other Flash commands to change
the object’s size, rotation, and skew, as you can see in Figure 5-4.
5. Select the range from keyframe to keyframe by clicking the first
keyframe and dragging to the last keyframe.
If the span of frames is too long to show, click the first keyframe, scroll
to the last keyframe, press Shift, and click the last keyframe.

Creating Tweened Motion Animation
676
You can click anywhere between the keyframes and get almost the exact
same result as you can get with the click-and-drag technique. The last
keyframe isn’t tweened, but the result looks the same when you play the
animation.
6. From the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel, select Motion.
If you changed the object’s size, select the Scale check box in the
Properties panel to tween the size.
7. If you want to rotate the object during the tween (in addition to any
rotation you create in Step 4), select CW (clockwise) or CCW (counter-
clockwise) from the Rotate drop-down list in the Properties panel and
then enter the number of rotations in the Rotation Count text field.
To test your animation, click the first keyframe and press Enter or use
the Controller to rewind and play your animation.
You can accelerate or decelerate the speed of the tween. To accelerate from
beginning to end, enter a value between –1 and –100 in the Ease text field in
the Properties panel. To decelerate, use a value between 1 and 100.
See Figure 5-4 for an example of a star that moves along a diagonal line. The
star also becomes smaller, so it appears to recede in the distance as it moves.

Motion tweening along a path
To tween along a path that isn’t a straight line, you need to draw the path on
a guide layer. (See Book V, Chapter 4 for the steps to create a guide layer.)
Your animation is on the guided layer (the layer with the animation on it)
that is associated with the guide layer (the layer that has the path that the
animation follows on it). You can refer back to Figure 5-2 for an example of a
motion tween along a path. In that figure, the star moves along a path, which
you see with onion skinning on.
To create an animation that moves along a path, follow these steps (which
start just like the steps for simple motion tweening):
1. On your animation layer, insert a keyframe where you want the ani-
mation to start.
To add a keyframe, right-click the frame to the left of where you want to
create a keyframe and choose Insert Keyframe from the contextual menu.
2. Click the keyframe and create or import the object or objects (symbol
instance, group, or text) you want to animate.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want the animation to end.
4. Select the range from keyframe to keyframe by clicking the first
keyframe and dragging to the last keyframe, or click anywhere
between the two keyframes.
5. From the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel, select Motion.
6. In the Properties panel, select the Snap check box to snap the object
to the path.
7. If you want the object to rotate in the direction and angle of the path,
select the Orient to Path check box.
8. Right-click the object’s layer and select Add Motion Guide.
The new layer is added. The layer is labeled Guide, and the object’s
layer is indented beneath it.
9. On the guide layer, draw your path using the Pen tool.
10. Click the first keyframe of the object’s layer and drag the object by its
registration point (a small plus or circle) to the beginning of the path
until the registration point snaps to the path.
11. Click the last keyframe of the object’s layer and drag the object by its
registration point to the end of the path until the registration point
snaps to the path.
12. Press Enter to play the animation.

Creating Tweened Shape Animation
678
If you need to change your path, use the Flash editing tools to edit the path
that you created. You can use the Selection or Subselection tools to edit the
path. (See Book V, Chapter 2 for details on editing graphics.)
The guide path isn’t visible in the published movie. However, you often don’t
want to see the path even in your document, so you can more easily visual-
ize the animation. Just click the eye column of the guide layer to hide it.
Creating Tweened Shape Animation
If you want your objects to change shape, you need shape tweening, often
called morphing. In contrast to motion tweening, shape tweening works only
with plain vector objects, usually ones that you create with the Flash draw-
ing tools. You can’t shape tween a symbol instance, text, or a group unless
you break it apart by choosing Modify➪Break Apart.
To turn text into shapes, choose Modify➪Break Apart twice. The first time
only breaks apart the text into individual letters. The second time you
choose Modify➪Break Apart, you create shapes from the individual letters.
However, remember that you can have only one animated object on a layer.
You can break apart text once and then choose Modify➪Timeline➪Distribute
to Layers to put each letter on a separate layer. If you want to shape tween
the letters, break apart each letter a second time.
Creating a simple shape tween
To shape tween a shape, follow these steps:
1. On a new layer, right-click the frame where you want the animation to
start and select Insert Keyframe (or press F6).
2. Create the beginning shape.
3. Insert a keyframe where you want to end the animation.
4. With the second keyframe selected, create the ending shape.
You can create the end shape by erasing the first shape and drawing a
new one or by modifying the first shape.
5. If you want to change color, you can simply choose another color for
the ending shape from the Color box in the Properties panel.
6. If you want to change transparency, open the Color Mixer panel
(Window➪Color) and change the Alpha percentage in the Alpha text
field.
You can also change the color in the Color Mixer.

Book V
Chapter 5
Creating Animation

679
7. Click between the keyframes or select the entire span of the tween.
8. Select Shape from the Tween drop-down list in the Properties panel.
9. From the lower section of the Properties panel, select Angular from
the Blend drop-down list if your tween shape has straight lines and
sharp corners. Select Distributive for more curvy shapes.
You may need to click the Collapse/Expand arrow at the lower-right
corner of the Properties panel to display the lower section of the
Properties panel.
10. To play the animation, click the first keyframe and press Enter.
Using shape hints for more control
When you create your first shape tween, you may find that Flash calculated
the transformation differently than you imagined it. You can give Flash cues,
called shape hints, that tell it which part of the original shape you want to
move where, as you can see in Figure 5-5.
To use shape hints, follow these steps:
1. Create a shape animation, using the steps in the section “Creating a
simple shape tween,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the first keyframe of the animation.
3. Choose Modify➪Shape➪Add Shape Hint or press Ctrl+Shift+H.
A small red circle with the letter “a” inside it appears on the Stage.
4. Drag the shape hint to the area in your shape where you want the
shape to transform to your settings.
Figure 5-5:

5. Click the ending keyframe of the animation.
You again see a small circle with the letter “a” inside it on the Stage.
6. Drag the shape hint to the area in your shape where you want the
beginning hint to move.
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 to place additional shape hints.
8. Press Enter to play the animation and check the results.
If you want, you can remove or hide existing shape hints:
✦To remove a shape hint: Drag it off the Stage.
✦To display and hide shape hints: Select the layer and keyframe with the
shape hints and choose View➪Show Shape Hints.
Adding Basic Interactivity to Animation
You often need to control how your animation works. For example, you may
want some animation to loop or to stop at a certain point. You may also want
to enable viewers to control the animation. Buttons commonly allow users
to stop the animation (perhaps some introductory animation for your Web
site) or turn off the sound. You introduce interactivity and control by using
ActionScript, the Flash programming language.
The following sections offer a few ideas for using ActionScript in animation.
We cover interactivity in detail in Book V, Chapter 8.
Go To
You don’t need to play your animation from beginning to end. You can add
ActionScript (often simply called actions) to control the playing of the
frames. The Go To action tells the movie to go to a different frame. At that
point, you can tell the animation to stop or to play.
Say that you want your animation to play from Frame 1 to Frame 24, but then
you want the last half to loop over and over again. On Frame 24, you can add
a Go To action and tell Flash to go to Frame 12 and play. The animation goes
to Frame 24 and then loops back to Frame 12 again. In this situation, the 
first 11 frames play only once, but Frames 12 through 24 play over and over
in a loop.
In another situation, you may want animation to play from Frame 1 to Frame
24, and then go to Frame 50 and stop. You may be using Frame 50 to display
a menu. In this case, you use the Go To and Stop actions.

Book V
Chapter 5
Creating Animation
Working with Scenes
681
Stop
Sometimes, you just want to stop the animation. For example, movie clips
automatically loop. If you want them to play just once and then stop, you
add a Stop action in the last frame. For any animation, you can add a Stop
action at the end to make sure that everything stops at the same time.
Play
After you stop an animation, you may want to play it again. You can use the
Play action to play a movie when certain conditions are met (a rollover or a
click for example). If the conditions aren’t met, the movie doesn’t play
(because of a Stop action).
On (mouse event)
You use the On action for buttons, which you can read more about in 
Book V, Chapter 3. To add interactivity, you specify what happens when the
button is clicked or released, when a mouse cursor passes over or off the
button, or when a mouse cursor is dragged over or off the button. For exam-
ple, you may want to use the On action to specify that when the button is
clicked, you go to a different frame or URL, such as another page on the 
Web site.
Working with Scenes
A scene is a section of an animation. You can divide your animation into
scenes, each with its own Timeline. The scenes play back in the order you
set. You create a scene to help you organize your animation. By default, you
work in Scene 1. The current scene name appears beneath the Layer list. To
create a new scene, choose Insert➪Scene.
To manage your scenes, choose Window➪Scene. The Scene panel opens, as
you can see in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6:
The Scene
panel helps
you manage
scenes.

Working with Scenes
682
You can use the Scene panel to work with scenes in the following ways:
✦Change scene order: Drag a scene’s name in the Scene panel to a new
location to change the order of the scenes.
✦Rename a scene: Double-click a scene’s name, type a new name, and
press Enter to rename a scene.
✦Add a scene: Click the Add Scene button at the bottom of the Scene
panel to add a scene.
✦Delete a scene: Select a scene and click the Delete Scene button at the
bottom of the Scene panel to delete a scene.
✦Duplicate a scene: Select a scene and click the Duplicate Scene button
at the bottom of the Scene panel to create a copy of a scene.
✦View a scene: Select the scene in the Scene panel to view the scene.

Chapter 6: Adding 
Sound and Video
In This Chapter
 Introducing sound and video formats
 Working with sounds
 Working with video clips
You can make the Web experience richer by adding sound and video to
your Web pages. Sounds can range from a simple clicking noise when a
user clicks a button to music and narration. You can also include video in
your Web site.
Exploring Sound and Video Formats
Both sound and video files come in many formats. Before you can use sound
or video, however, you need a file that Adobe Flash CS3 can import.
Sound file formats
Adobe Flash supports several sound formats. These are the most common:
✦AIFF: This is the standard sound format for Macintosh computers.
These files usually have filenames with the .aif or .ief extension.
✦WAV: This is the standard format for Windows machines. These files
usually have filenames with the .wav extension.
✦MP3: This is a highly compressed format that maintains high-quality
sound.
A sound file has several properties that affect its quality and size. You can
often adjust these properties to reduce file size without noticeably affecting
quality. For sophisticated adjustments, you probably need a sound-editing
program, such as SoundForge. Here are the basic properties of a sound file:
✦Sample rate: The sample rate is the number of times in kilohertz (kHz)
that an audio signal is sampled when it’s recorded digitally. A higher
sample rate results in higher quality sound but also yields a larger file
size.

Working with Sounds
684
✦Bit rate: The bit rate is the number of bits (pieces of data) used for each
audio sample. Sixteen-bit sounds are clearer, but 8-bit sounds are smaller
and may be good enough for simple sounds, such as a button click.
✦Channels: Channels are the number of streams of sound in a file and are
either mono or stereo. Mono may be just fine and uses half the amount
of data as stereo.
You can find a sound’s properties when you import the sound into Flash, as
explained in the section, “Importing sounds,” later in this chapter.
Video file formats
The types of video formats you can use depend on some other software that
supports their playback:
✦If you have QuickTime 4 or later installed: You can import AVI, MPEG
(MPG), MOV, and DV formats.
✦If you have DirectX 7 or later installed: You can import AVI, MPEG
(MPG), and WMV/ASF (Windows Media File) formats.
Because video files are usually very large, they are always compressed by
using a codec. The word codec stands for compression/decompression. The
same codec decompresses the video file when it is used. You need to have
the codec that was used for the video file on your computer to be able to
import the video file. The same applies to the audio track in a video file.
Working with Sounds
Working with sounds in Flash involves at least two steps: importing the
sound and placing it in a movie. You can also do basic sound edits in Flash.
Importing sounds
To import a sound, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Import to Library.
The Import dialog box appears.
2. Select the sound file you want to import and click Open.
The sound goes into the Library.
To see a sound’s properties, open the Library, right-click the sound, and
choose Properties from the contextual menu that appears.

Book V
Chapter 6
Adding Sound 
and Video
Working with Sounds
685
Placing a sound in a movie
After a sound is in the Library, you can place it in your movie. You need to
decide when it starts, when it ends, or whether you want to loop the sound.
To place a sound, follow these steps:
1. Create a new layer for the sound by choosing Insert➪Timeline➪Layer.
2. Right-click the frame and choose Insert Keyframe from the contextual
menu.
This selection inserts a keyframe on the sound’s layer where you want
the sound to start.
3. Press Ctrl+L to open the Library or choose Window➪Library.
Scroll down to the sound file you’re looking for in the Library.
4. Drag the sound to the Stage.
The sound extends to the next keyframe, if one exists.
5. To specify settings for the sound, open the Properties panel by choos-
ing Window➪Properties.
6. Expand the Properties panel, shown in Figure 6-1, using the
Expand/Collapse arrow in the lower-right corner.
7. From the Sound drop-down list, choose the sound for which you want
to specify settings.
All the sounds you have imported are listed.
8. To create a special effect, select an effect from the Effect drop-down list.
You have the following choices:
• None: No special effect (the default)
• Left channel: Plays the sound from only the left speaker
• Right channel: Plays the sound from only the right speaker
• Fade left to right: Starts playing from the left speaker and moves to
the right speaker
Figure 6-1:
Specify
sound
settings.

Working with Sounds
686
• Fade right to left: Starts playing from the right speaker and moves to
the left speaker
• Fade in: Starts playing softly and increases the volume
• Fade out: Starts playing loudly and decreases the volume
• Custom: Plays a custom effect if you edit the sound, as explained in
the next section
9. Select a synchronization type from the Sync drop-down list.
You can choose from the following options:
• Event: Plays the sound from its first keyframe until it ends (even if
the movie stops), replays the sound whenever that keyframe plays,
and downloads the entire sound before it plays. This choice is ideal
for button sounds that you want to play whenever you click the
button. Event is the default synchronization type.
• Start: Plays the sound as the Event option does, but if the keyframe
is replayed before the sound is finished, the Start option doesn’t
replay the sound.
• Stop: Stops playing the sound.
• Stream: Synchronizes the sound with the animation, shortening or
lengthening the animation to match the length of the sound. Flash
may skip frames if necessary.
10. If you want to loop or repeat the sound, select either Loop or Repeat
from the drop-down list beside it.
If you select Loop, the movie simply repeats over and over again. If you
select Repeat, you are asked to enter the number of repeats in the field
provided.
11. Press Enter to play the animation and hear the sound.
Press Ctrl+Enter to test the movie if you’re working on a complex 
animation.
Editing sounds
Flash contains its own simple sound-editing tool. For example, you can
delete some of the beginning or end of the sound if you don’t need it. You
can also change the volume. To edit a sound, follow these steps:
1. Click a frame that contains a sound.
2. Open the Properties panel by choosing Window➪Properties.
If necessary, click the Collapse/Expand arrow at the lower-right corner
to expand the Properties panel fully.

Book V
Chapter 6

and Video
Working with Sounds
687
3. Click the Edit button within the Properties panel.
The Edit Envelope dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, appears. In this con-
text, envelope just means the entire snippet of music.
You can edit the sound as follows:
• Change the volume: Drag an envelope handle up to increase volume
or down to decrease volume. Click an envelope line to add a handle
so that you can change the volume at that location.
• Delete the beginning of the sound: Drag the Time In control to the
right.
• Delete the end of the sound: Scroll to the end of the sound and drag
the Time Out control (the ending control) to the left.
You can use the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to change the magnification of
the sound wave in the Edit Envelope dialog box. You can also use the Frames
and Seconds buttons to change the display between frames and seconds.
Setting sound properties
You can control the properties of a sound to further compress it. If you need
to specify different properties for different sounds, set the properties when
you place the sound in your movie:
1. Open the Library by choosing Window➪Library or by pressing Ctrl+L.
2. Double-click the sound icon next to the sound for which you want to
see the properties.
The Sound Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 6-3, appears.
Figure 6-2:
Edit sounds
in the Edit
Envelope
dialog box.

Working with Sounds
688
The top part of the dialog box lists the sound’s name, original location,
and statistics. At the bottom of the dialog box, use the Compression
drop-down list to select the file format you want:
• Default: Leaves the sound unchanged.
• ADPCM: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose a
sampling rate and bit rate. This option is used for short sounds.
• MP3: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose a bit rate
and quality. MP3 is an efficient compression method and is used for
longer, more complex sounds, especially music.
• Raw: Enables you to convert stereo to mono and to choose the sam-
pling rate. Raw uses no compression.
• Speech: Enables you to choose a sampling rate. This option uses
compression specially designed for speech.
As you choose an option, you see the resulting statistics at the bottom
of the dialog box.
3. Click the Test button to hear the result of your choice.
You can also set sound properties for all sounds at once when you publish
your movie. (See Book V, Chapter 7.)

Working with Video Clips
In Adobe Flash CS3, you can embed video clips in your Flash movie. A video
clip can be live action or animation created with an animation program that
outputs a video file format. Note: Flash may not be able to handle very long
video files. You also have no direct control over the video frames.
To use a video, follow these steps:
1. Select a keyframe already on your Timeline (or create a new keyframe
by right-clicking a frame and choosing Insert Keyframe from the con-
textual menu that appears).
2. Choose File➪Import➪Import Video.
The Import dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
3. Click the Browse button to select the video you’d like to import.
Browse to the movie you’d like to import and then select Open. The
location of the movie to import will appear in the File path field. 
4. Click Continue to continue the movie import process.
5. Select a compression profile.
Figure 6-4:

You can select from one of the five compression algorithms that Flash
offers by selecting it from the drop-down list, or you can create your
own by selecting the Create Your Own Profile option.
6. To choose the frequency of keyframes in the video clip, drag the
Keyframe Interval slider.
A video keyframe is separate from a Timeline keyframe. A video
keyframe stores the entire image data as compared to the changes from
the previous frame that are stored in regular frames.
A keyframe interval of 0 adds a single keyframe at the beginning of the
video stream and no other keyframes.
7. Select the Synchronize Video to Flash Document Frame Rate option to
match the video frame rate to the Flash movie frame rate.
If your video display is poor, try deselecting this option.
8. From the Number of Video Frames to Encode per Number of Flash
Frames drop-down list, select a ratio.
The default is 1:1, which plays one video frame for each Flash frame. A
ratio of 1:2 plays one video frame for every two Flash frames. A 1:2 or
higher ratio reduces file size but reduces smoothness of playback as
well.
9. Click Finish.
If the video clip is longer than the span of keyframes into which you are
placing the video, a message appears, asking whether you want to add
enough frames necessary to play the entire clip.
10. Click Yes to add the frames.

fter you finish creating your Flash document, you need to publish it in
SWF movie format. You then use HTML code to insert the SWF movie 
in a Web page so that browsers can display the animation. In this chapter,
we explain how to place your animation onto your Web site.
Publishing Movies the Simple Way
If you don’t need to change any settings, you can immediately publish 
your file by choosing File➪Publish. For more control, choose File➪
Publish Settings to open the Publish Settings dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 7-1.
By default, Adobe Flash CS3 creates two files: the SWF file and an HTML 
file that contains the HTML code needed for your Web page. You can also
export your document to other formats by selecting the format you want on
the Formats tab. We discuss the HTML code and other export formats in the
“Generating HTML and Graphics” section, later in this chapter.
Flash creates all these files by using the name of your Flash document and
tacking on various filename extensions. 
To post your movie on your Web site, you use the HTML code either by
itself or within another Web page. Then you upload both the Web page and
the SWF file as you would any other Web page and image.
Flash has many more options for you to tweak. To set these options, click
the other tabs of the Publish Settings dialog box and select the options you
want before clicking the Publish button.

Publishing Movies the Simple Way

Click the Flash tab, shown in Figure 7-2, to see the options for creating the
SWF file. You can set the following options:
✦Version: Saves in previous version formats for backward compatibility.
✦Load Order: Controls the loading order of layers in your document for
the first frame (which usually takes the longest to display).
Changing the load order can affect how your ActionScript code functions.
✦ActionScript Version: Enables you to select the version of ActionScript
you want to run in your movie. You can click the Settings button to spec-
ify the classes to be exported if you select ActionScript 2.0 from the
drop-down list.
✦Generate Size Report: Creates a text file that details the size of the
frames of your movie so that you can make adjustments if a movie is
loading slowly.

✦Protect from Import: Helps prevent the SWF file from being imported
into an FLA file that others can then modify.
Never trust that your SWF is completely safe. Tools to undo this option
are available on the Web.
✦Omit Trace Actions: Reduces file size by deleting trace actions if you
used them in your ActionScript to help you debug your code.
✦Permit Debugging: Enables you to use the Flash Debugger feature to
debug errors in ActionScript.
The debugger allows you to troubleshoot ActionScript problems from
within your browser. You can protect this feature by using a password.
✦Compress Movie: Compresses your Flash document, especially text 
and ActionScript. Note: This feature is compatible only with the Flash
Player 6 or later.
✦Optimize for Flash Player 6 r65: This feature optimizes your movie for
playback on the Flash Player 6 or the 6.5 revision.

✦Password: Enables you to enter a password for debugging so that those
without the password cannot debug your movie.
✦Script Time Limits: Allows you to set a timeout for how long your
ActionScripts can run in your application before they give up and decide
to display an error message.
✦JPEG Quality: Sets the quality of bitmaps. Higher quality looks better
but means a larger file size.
✦Audio Stream: Sets the audio compression for all streaming sounds in
the movie, if you haven’t set individual settings in the Sound Properties
dialog box. Click the Set button to set the compression. See Book V,
Chapter 6 for more information on streaming sounds.
✦Audio Event: Sets audio compression for all event sounds in the movie.
Click the Set button to set the compression.
✦Override Sound Settings: Overrides settings in the Sound Properties
dialog box and applies settings here to all sounds in your movie.
Optimizing Movies for Speed
As you work, be sure to always design for fast display on a Web site. You
can’t control the speed of your viewers’ Internet connections or how fast
their computers’ processors are, but you can definitely control the size of
your movie file. Before you publish your document, you may want to look 
it over from within Flash and see how you can make it more efficient. After
you publish and test the movie on a Web page, you may find that you need
to make some adjustments for faster download. The following four sections
offer some tips for optimizing your movies for speedy display.
Simplifying graphics
You can simplify the graphics in your movie and greatly increase its speed.
Here are some pointers:
✦Use tweened animation: Tweened animation is faster than frame-by-
frame animation. (See Book V, Chapter 5.)
✦Don’t animate bitmaps: Flash needs to store the location of each pixel
in a bitmap, and that storage information greatly increases file size. In
fact, avoid bitmaps altogether as much as possible.
✦Turn everything into symbols: Even backgrounds should be symbols.
You can also put symbols inside of symbols. (See Book V, Chapter 3 for
details on creating symbols.)
✦Group objects: Groups also reduce file size.

Book V
Chapter 7
Publishing Movies
Optimizing Movies for Speed
695
✦Optimize curves: Optimizing curves reduces the number of lines in your
graphics. (See Book V, Chapter 2.)
✦Use solid lines: Avoid dashed and dotted lines. Especially avoid custom
lines.
✦Use the Pencil tool rather than the Brush tool: The Brush tool requires
your document to store more information.
✦Use the Web-safe color palette: Avoid custom colors.
✦Use solid fills rather than gradients as much as possible: Gradients are
more complex to calculate.
✦Avoid transparency: As much as possible, avoid using alpha values of
less than 100 percent.
Optimizing text
Text takes up more bytes in your file than vector graphics. Here are some
options for reducing the load:
✦Reduce the number of fonts: Use simpler fonts, fewer font styles (bold,
italic), and fewer fonts overall. Use device fonts (Verdana, Arial, Times,
and Courier) if possible.
The device fonts display correctly in any browser and on any computer.
✦Put text into your HTML document: Not all text needs to be in your
Flash document. If you put some of your text in HTML format, you get
faster download times.
Minimizing the size of sound files
Sound and music can really hog up the download stream. (See Book V,
Chapter 6 for details about working with sounds.) You can use the following
techniques to minimize the size of sounds:
✦Compress sounds: Use the Sound Properties dialog box (right-click the
sound in the Library and choose Properties from the contextual menu)
to fine-tune settings for individual sounds, or compress sounds by using
the sound settings (Audio Stream and Audio Event) on the Flash tab of
the Publish Settings dialog box, described earlier in this chapter. Use the
MP3 format whenever possible.
✦Remove silent areas: Edit sounds to remove unnecessary beginnings
and endings by adjusting the Time In and Time Out controls.
✦Reuse sounds: You can reuse a sound with different in and out points or
loop different parts of the same sound.
✦Don’t loop streaming sound: Looping is not necessary, and the browser
continually downloads streaming sound.

Testing download time
Flash can simulate various Internet connection speeds and give you feed-
back on which frames may cause a delay in download time. Don’t miss out
on this excellent tool. If the results indicate delays, go back and adjust your
movie until the display is quick. You don’t want to lose your Web site visitors
because they become impatient while waiting for your Flash movie to down-
load! Follow these steps to test your movie’s download time:
1. Choose Control➪Test Movie.
2. From the menu bar of the new window, choose View➪Download
Settings and choose a download speed.
3. From the menu bar of the new window, choose View➪Bandwidth
Profiler.
The Bandwidth Profiler is shown in Figure 7-3.

4. Choose View➪Simulate Download to simulate playing the animation
over an Internet connection.
Watch for any jerkiness and listen for any breaks in the sound.
5. Choose View➪Streaming Graph to see all the frames that may cause
delays or View➪Frame by Frame Graph to see the size of each frame.
These are just two ways of viewing the information. You can use either
view. Click on any bar (which represents a frame) to see the information
for that frame. Frames that extend above the red horizontal line may
cause a delay in the display of the movie.
6. Choose File➪Close to close the movie-testing tools.
A short delay in the first frame is often acceptable as Flash downloads all the
information. After the first frame, try to avoid any delays because they result
in pauses or uneven animation.
Although the best solution is to minimize delays, another possible choice is
a preloader, a short animation that plays repeatedly while the main anima-
tion is loading. If you want your viewers to get to your movie quickly, work
to reduce file size rather than use a preloader. If the artistry and special
effects are primary, use a preloader.
Generating HTML and Graphics
When you publish your Flash document, you also generate the HTML code
that you need to create a Web page that plays your animation. You can also
export your movie in several other graphic and animation formats.
Creating HTML code
You can use the HTML code that Flash generates to create a new Web page
that contains nothing but your movie, or you can insert the HTML code into
an existing Web page that may contain many other components. On the HTML
tab of the Publish Settings dialog box, you can specify the following settings:
✦Template: Specifies the content of the HTML file. The Flash Only (the
default) option includes only <OBJECT> and <EMBED> tags. Other tem-
plates add code to detect earlier Flash Players or offer other features. To
see what each template does and which formats you need to choose,
select the template and click the Info button.
✦Dimensions: Controls the size of the movie in the browser. The default
option, Match Movie, matches the width and height of your Stage. You
can also specify the size in pixels or by percent.

Generating HTML and Graphics
698
✦Playback: Paused at Start: Pauses the movie until your viewer clicks 
a button (that you have coded to start the movie) or right-clicks and
chooses Play. By default, this option is off, so the movie plays 
automatically.
✦Playback: Loop: Repeats the movie over and over. By default, this
option is on.
✦Playback: Display Menu: Displays a contextual menu if viewers right-
click. The menu allows viewers to play, loop, and print the movie.
However, not all viewers know that this contextual menu exists. This
option is on by default.
✦Playback: Device Font: Substitutes anti-aliased fonts (that look
smoother) for fonts not available on the user’s computer. This option is
not selected by default.
✦Quality: Sets the quality of playback. Choose one of the following:
• Low: Uses no anti-aliasing (smoothing)
• Auto Low: Starts at low quality and switches to the highest quality
that the user’s computer (detected by the Flash Player) can handle
• Auto High: Starts at high quality and switches to a lower quality if
the user’s computer (detected by the Flash Player) cannot handle
high quality
• Medium: Uses some anti-aliasing but doesn’t smooth bitmaps
• High: Uses anti-aliasing for everything except tweened bitmaps (the
default)
• Best: Uses anti-aliasing for text, unanimated bitmaps, and tweened
bitmaps
✦Window Mode: Specifies how the movie’s window relates to the rest of
the page on the PC. Choose Window (a separate window), Opaque (an
opaque background), or Transparent (a transparent background).
✦HTML Alignment: Aligns the movie in the browser window. You can
choose Default (centered), Left, Right, Top, or Bottom.
✦Scale: Specifies how the movie is placed in its boundaries when you use
the Pixels or Percent option of the Dimensions setting and the width and
height are therefore different from the movie’s original size. The choices
are Default (Show All), No Border, Exact Fit, and No Scale.
✦Flash Alignment: Specifies how the movie fits in the movie window (not
the browser window). The Horizontal setting can be Left, Center, or
Right. The Vertical setting can be Top, Center, or Bottom.
✦Show Warning Message: Displays warning messages if problems occur
during publishing.

Creating graphic files
You can create GIF, JPEG, and PNG graphics files from a frame of your Flash
movie. Each type of graphics file has its own options. By default, Flash cre-
ates the image from your first frame.
To add a label to a frame, click the frame and open the Properties panel
(choose Window➪Properties). Expand the Properties panel by using the
Collapse/Expand arrow at the bottom-right corner. Type the label name in
the Frame text field. You can name a frame anything you want. Certain
names, such as the #Static label, have specific meanings for the way Flash
functions.
GIF files
GIF files have limited colors but allow transparency. Select the GIF check box
on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. When you do that, a
GIF tab appears. Then click the GIF tab, where you have the following settings:
✦Dimensions: Enables you to select the Match Movie option to match 
the size of the Stage. To use a different size, deselect the Match Movie
option and type the new dimensions.
✦Playback: Enables you to select either the Static (a single image) or
Animated (an animated GIF of the entire movie) option. If you select
Animated, you can choose to loop continuously or repeat a specified
number of times.
✦Options: Offers several options. Choose from the following:
• Optimize Colors: Removes unused colors
• Interlace: Loads in increments of greater resolution (starting from
fuzzy)
• Smooth: Anti-aliases the artwork
• Remove Gradients: Removes gradients from the GIF images
• Dither Solids: Approximates colors not available on the GIF color
palette
✦Transparent: Allows you to set transparency (alpha) of the background.
✦Dither: Defines the type of dithering, which is the approximation of a
color from a mixture of other colors when the desired color is not avail-
able. You can choose Ordered dithering, which provides good-quality
dithering without much increase in file size, or you can choose Diffusion
dithering, which provides top-quality dithering for the 216 Web-safe
colors but makes for a larger file size.

Generating HTML and Graphics
700
✦Palette Type: Defines the GIF color palette. If you choose an adaptive
palette, a unique color palette is created for the GIF. You can then
choose the maximum number of colors. If you choose a custom palette,
click the ellipsis button and choose a palette file. To save a palette of
colors that you use in Flash, choose Window➪Color Swatches, click the
Options menu icon in the upper-right corner of the Color Swatches
panel, and choose Save Colors.
JPEG files
JPEG files allow for many colors but do not allow transparency. They decom-
press when downloaded, taking up more memory. Select the JPEG check box
on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. Then click the JPEG
tab (it appears after you select the JPEG check box), where you have the fol-
lowing settings:
✦Dimensions: Enables you to match the size of the Stage or specify
another size.
✦Quality: Enables you to choose the quality. Higher quality means a
better picture but a larger file size.
✦Progressive: Displays the JPEG file in increments of greater resolution
(starting from fuzzy) as it downloads in a browser.
PNG files
PNG files offer many colors and transparency, too. Select the PNG check box
on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. Then click the PNG tab
(it appears after you select the PNG check box), where you have the follow-
ing settings:
✦Dimensions: Enables you to match the size of the Stage or specify
another size.
✦Bit Depth: Controls the number of colors the image can contain and 
the availability of transparency (alpha). More colors — and more 
transparency — increase the file size.
✦Options: Offers several options. Choose from the following:
• Optimize Colors: Removes unused colors.
• Interlace: Loads the PNG file in increments of greater resolution
(starting from fuzzy).
• Smooth: Anti-aliases the artwork.
• Remove Gradients: Removes gradients from the PNG images.

Book V
Chapter 7

701
• Dither Solids: Approximates colors not available on the GIF color
palette. This option is the same as for GIF images (explained 
previously).
✦Dither: Enables you to use the same Dither settings as for GIF images, 
if you choose an 8-bit depth. This option is not available for other bit
depths.
✦Palette Type: Enables you to use the same Dither settings as for GIF
images, if you choose an 8-bit depth.
✦Max Colors: Same as for GIF images.
✦Palette: Same as for GIF images.
✦Filter Options: Determines the method of compression (the method of
combining pixels in an image). Choose from the following options:
• None: No compression
• Sub: Filters adjoining pixel bytes, going horizontally
• Up: Filters vertically
• Average: Uses both horizontal and vertical
• Path: Creates an algorithm using the three nearest pixels to predict
the next pixel
• Adaptive: Provides the most accurate colors
Creating QuickTime movies
QuickTime is a video format that plays on the QuickTime player. To use
QuickTime movies, you need to have QuickTime 4 or higher installed.
Select the QuickTime check box on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings
dialog box. Click the QuickTime tab that appears, where you have the follow-
ing settings:
✦Dimensions: Enables you to match the size of the Stage or specify
another size.
✦Alpha: Sets the transparency of the Flash track within the QuickTime
movie, if you have combined a QuickTime movie with a Flash movie. A
QuickTime movie can contain a separate layer with the Flash movie. 
The Auto option makes the Flash track transparent only if it is on top of
other tracks. The Alpha-transparent option always makes the Flash track
transparent. The Copy option makes the Flash track opaque, hiding all
content behind it.

Generating HTML and Graphics
702
✦Layer: Specifies how the Flash track is layered with the QuickTime con-
tent. Choose from Auto (Flash track on top if Flash content appears in
front; otherwise on the bottom), Top (Flash track on top), or Bottom
(Flash track at the bottom).
✦Streaming Sound: Enables you to control how streaming sound is used
with QuickTime content. Select the Use QuickTime Compression check
box to export sound to a QuickTime soundtrack. Click Setting to specify
how the sound is compressed.
✦Controller: Creates a control panel to play the movie. Choose None if
you have created your own controller or don’t want viewers to have any
control. The Standard option displays the QuickTime controller. The
QuickTime VR option offers special panoramic and 3D viewing features.
✦Playback: Enables you to control movie playback. Select the Loop check
box to repeat the movie, the Paused At Start check box to let viewers
use the Controller to start the movie, or the Play Every Frame check box
to disable skipping frames and sound to maintain timing.
✦File: Enables you to determine how files are referenced. The Flatten
(Make Self-Contained) option combines the Flash movie with imported
content into a QuickTime movie. If you don’t select the Flatten check
box, the QuickTime movie references the Flash SWF file.
Creating self-playing movies
Self-playing movies are called projectors. A projector doesn’t require a separate
Flash Player and is ideal when you are putting a Flash movie on a CD-ROM. To
create a projector, select the Windows Projector or the Macintosh Projector
check box on the Formats tab of the Publish Settings dialog box. Then click
the Publish button. The result is a file with an .exe extension (for PCs) or an
.hqx extension (for Macs). The projector file is larger than an SWF file, but
users can download it from a Web site and play it without needing the Flash
Player.
Exporting movies and images
Export a movie or image, instead of publishing it, when you need to use it in
another application. For example, you can export a frame as a GIF file and
insert it into a PowerPoint presentation. If you already have the HTML code
and just want to update an SWF file, you can export instead of publish. To
export a movie, or frame, just follow these steps:
1. Select the frame you want to export, if you are exporting an image.
2. Choose File➪Export➪Export Image or File➪Export➪Export Movie.

Book V
Chapter 7
Publishing Movies

703
3. Type a name for the image or movie in the File Name field.
4. From the Save as Type drop-down list, select a file type.
5. Click Save.
A dialog box may appear if the format you choose has settings that you can
specify. These settings are the same as you have when you publish a file and
are explained in the “Generating HTML and Graphics” section, earlier in this
chapter. You can export the following file types:
✦Adobe Illustrator (.ai)
✦Encapsulated PostScript (.eps)
✦Drawing Exchange Format (.dxf)
✦Windows Bitmap (.bmp)
✦Metafile (.emf/.wmf)
✦FutureSplash Player (.spl)

Chapter 8: Using Flash’s
Components
In This Chapter
 Understanding components
 Inserting components
A
dobe Flash CS3 is not limited to creating animation. You can use Flash
to develop an entire interface, including buttons, menus, forms, scroll-
bars, and more. Flash includes a set of interface elements called compo-
nents that you can use to efficiently add interfaces and interactivity to your
Web site. In this chapter, we show how you can use components and create
forms with Flash.
Flash can create very innovative interfaces. As long as you keep your Flash
interfaces user friendly and easy to understand, your viewers will appreci-
ate the new look and feel. Scrollbars created with Flash are a lot cooler than
the ones created with conventional HTML editors because you can cus-
tomize how they look and function. Creating scrollbars and other interface
elements for your Web page with Flash may actually be easier than with
other, more complex programming environments. Some of these techniques,
however, require a bit of ActionScript programming to make them fully 
functional.
Components are actually movie clip symbols that contain a set of defined
parameters and properties. (For an explanation of movie clip symbols, see
Book V, Chapter 3.) You can specify the values of these parameters and
properties when you create your Flash document. Using these components
ensures that your interface items work together and in a similar manner.
Because of the programming that has been done in advance to create the
parameters and properties, you need to do less programming for each Flash
document you create.
You can customize the appearance of components to match the rest of your
Web site’s style. If you know some ActionScript, you can even create your
own components, and you can find components that Flash developers have
created on Flash resource Web sites.

Adding Components
706
Adding Components
A component can be as simple as a check box or as complex as an entire
graphical user interface. The following list represents the basic set of com-
ponents included in Adobe Flash CS3. There are several other components,
many of which are native to ActionScript 3.0. For the purposes of this book,
however, we focus on the essential ones, most of which are designed for
ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0. (You can find them in the User Interface section of
the Components panel.)
✦Button: A simple button within the movie that performs some action.
✦Radio buttons: Radio buttons are small round buttons. Users can select
one choice from several options.
✦Check boxes: Users can select or deselect each check box.
✦Push buttons: Clicking a button makes something happen, like a button
symbol in Flash. (See Book V, Chapter 3 for more information on working
with buttons.)
✦Combo boxes: Combo boxes provide drop-down lists.
✦List boxes: List boxes enable you to offer users a scrolling list of choices.
✦Scroll panes: Scroll panes enable you to create scrollable windows for
movie clips.
✦Label: A label is a simple one-line text descriptor that accompanies a
field.
✦ProgressBar: This handy component shows your viewers a growing per-
centage bar that represents the progress of a file being loaded.
✦TextArea: This multiline text area can accept text inputs.
✦TextInput: Unlike the multiline text area, the TextInput is a single line of
text.
✦Numeric Stepper: This handy component is great for drop-down-like
lists. Use it to make lists of numbers that can be incremented or decre-
mented depending on the keystroke.
✦Window: The Window component creates a window within your Flash
movie. This window can have a specific size, as well as header text and
even a Close button.
The procedure for working with a component is similar for all the compo-
nents. However, individual items vary. The general procedure is as follows:
1. Open the Components panel by choosing Window➪Components.
The Components panel is shown in Figure 8-1.

Book V
Chapter 8
Using Flash’s
Components

707
2. Drag one of the components onto the Stage.
3. With the component still selected, open the Properties panel, if it isn’t
open already, by choosing Window➪Properties.
If the Properties panel is open but collapsed, click the Expand/Collapse
arrow on its title bar.
4. Click the Parameters tab.
The Properties panel with the Parameters tab displayed is shown in
Figure 8-2.
5. In the Instance Name text field of the Parameters panel, type an
instance name.
Remember that an instance is a single iteration of a symbol. By naming
each instance of the component, you can refer to it in your ActionScript.
6. Set the parameters for the component in the Properties panel by click-
ing each parameter and entering the value in the field to its right.

Adding Components
708
Repeat this procedure with all the components. The individual requirements
of the components are listed in the next several sections.
Use the Align panel, which you access by choosing Window➪Align, to line up
and evenly distribute a series of components, such as radio buttons or
check boxes.
You can resize components using the Free Transform tool, but they are not
all infinitely flexible. For example, you can change the width of a check box,
but not its height.
Check boxes
The CheckBox component allows users to select one or more choices from 
a list. Each item on the list has a small box next to it that has a check inside
when the user clicks the box. The CheckBox component has the following
parameters:
✦Label: This parameter determines the text that is attached to the 
component.
✦LabelPlacement: This parameter places the text relative to the rest of
the component. You can choose Left or Right.
✦Selected: This parameter, when set to true, shows that your check box is
already selected when the page is first viewed.
Radio buttons
Radio buttons are like check boxes, except that users can select only one 
at a time in any group of radio buttons. When a radio button is selected, it
has a dot inside its circle. The RadioButton component has the following
parameters:
✦Label: This parameter determines the text that is attached to the com-
ponent.
✦Selected: This initial state parameter determines if a radio button is ini-
tially selected.
✦Group Name: This parameter enables you to create independent groups
of radio buttons. Say that you want to poll your users to see whether
they like to swim and like to run. You want a Yes or a No for each. To
create such groups of radio buttons, enter a Group Name parameter.
Users can select one radio button in each group. For example, if you
have four radio buttons, you can put two into a group named Swim and
two into a group named Run. You can then label buttons Yes and No in

Book V
Chapter 8
Using Flash’s
Components
Adding Components
709
each group and ask users “Do you like to swim?” for the buttons in the
Swim group and “Do you like to run?” for the buttons in the Run group.
Users can then answer Yes or No to each question.
✦Data: The Data parameter stores data related to a button. For example, 
if you want to know whether a user selected the radio button named
Yes, you can put Yes in the Data field and use ActionScript to execute 
an action (perhaps go to a specific Web page) if a user selected the Yes
radio button.
✦LabelPlacement: This parameter places the text relative to the rest of
the component.
Push buttons
Push buttons are similar to the buttons you create in Flash. The main reason
to use push button components is to create a consistent look with other
components. However, the included parameters may make them quicker to
use and require less code. They have a Label parameter that places text on
the button and a Click Handler that uses a function you write to specify what
happens when a user clicks the button.
Combo boxes
A combo box is a menu list of items with a scrollbar to its right. Users can
scroll through the list of items and choose one.
As do radio buttons, combo boxes have change handler and data parame-
ters. You add the labels for the list items in the Parameters tab as follows:
1. With the combo box selected, open the Properties panel, if it isn’t
open already, by choosing Window➪Properties. Alternatively, click
the Expand/Collapse arrow on the Properties panel’s title bar.
2. Click the Parameter tab.
3. Click the magnifying glass icon next to the dataProvider field, which
opens the Values dialog box.
The Values dialog box is shown in Figure 8-3.
4. To add a new list item, click the plus (+) sign and type the label.
You can click any label to edit it.
5. When you’re done, click OK.
The Editable parameter in the Parameter list specifies whether the combo
box is editable. If this parameter is set to true, users can enter text to search
for a matching item. If it is set to false, users can only select an item.

Adding Components
710
The Row Count parameter in the Parameter list determines how many items
must be in the combo box before the scrollbar is displayed. The default is
eight items.
List boxes
A list box is like a combo box, except that (unlike a combo box) users cannot
edit it and they can select multiple items. To allow this capability, set the
Select Multiple parameter to true. You add the labels as described in the
“Combo boxes” section.
Scroll panes
Scroll panes are rather unusual. They allow you to put movie clips (and only
movie clips) inside a scrollable pane. The advantage is to display large movies
or images without taking up a lot of space. No programming is necessary. The
movie clip must be in the Library, but it doesn’t need to be on the Stage.
Label
The Label component is perhaps the simplest of the components in that it is
not dynamic in any way. It is simply a label for another form element. That
said, some settings can be applied to a label. You can align the text within
the label by selecting an autoSize option. You can also specify whether the
label will be HTML text by selecting true or false from the HTML option.
Loader
The Loader component allows you to load an SWF movie or a JPEG within a
Flash movie, effectively allowing you to play a movie within a movie. You can
specify only a few options for this component:
Figure 8-3:
Use the
Value dialog
box to enter

✦Set autoload to true to let Flash load the movie for you in the keyframe
where the movie begins.
✦Provide a path to the SWF or JPEG file to be loaded using the
contentPath field.
✦Allow the movie to be scaled up or down by setting the scaleContent
property to true.
When you render the movie, Flash renders not only your movie but also the
one you’ve pointed to with the Loader component.
TextArea
The TextArea component creates, as you might expect, a text area on the
screen. Four simple options apply to this component. To take advantage 
of this component, simply drag an instance of it from the Components 
panel onto the Stage. Here’s what you can specify using parameters in the
Properties panel:
✦Make the text box editable (meaning you can type in it on-screen) by
selecting true from the Editable property field.
✦If you want the box to be in HTML format, select true from the HTML
property field. For ease of use, you probably want to keep this property
set to false.
✦If you want the field to be prefilled with text, input some text in the Text
property field.
✦Finally, if you want to use word wrap, be sure to select true in the
wordWrap property field.
TextInput
Much like the TextArea component, the TextInput component allows viewers
to input text on the screen. Again, you add it to your document by dragging 
an instance of it from the Components panel onto the Stage. In the Properties
panel, you can set the following parameters:
✦Make the text box editable (meaning you can type in it on-screen) by
selecting true from the Editable property field.
✦If you want the text field to be a password field, meaning that only ****
shows up instead of characters, select true from the Password property
field. The default value is true.
✦If you want the field to be prefilled with text, input some text in the Text
property field.

Adding Components
712
NumericStepper
The NumericStepper component can be handy when you have lists that 
have incremental numeric values in them. Essentially, this component cre-
ates a list that you can cycle either up or down by using arrows. To use a
NumericStepper, simply drag it from the Components panel onto the Stage.
There, you can specify the following through the Properties panel:
✦To set the maximum value of the NumericStepper, input an integer in the
Maximum property field.
✦To set the minimum value of the NumericStepper, input an integer in the
Minimum property field.
✦Input an integer in the StepSize property field. It determines how big the
increments are from step to step.
✦In the Value property field, input the initial value of the NumericStepper.
Window
Another interesting tool for adding some cool interactivity to your interface
is the Window component. This component adds a window to your Flash
movie. This feature can be useful if you’re zooming in or loading a picture in
your movie. You create a window by dragging it from the Components panel
onto the Stage. Then you can specify the following:
✦If you want to be able to close the window, select true from the
CloseButton property field.
✦To load a picture into the window, provide a path to the image in the
contentPath property field.
✦If you want the window to have a text title, enter it in the Title property
field.
Setting component properties
You can set the color and text properties of a component by using
ActionScript. You can also globally set properties of all the components in
your movie. Finally, you can create skins, graphic elements that affect how
components look. These methods are beyond the scope of this book. For
more information, see Flash Help.

F
or many big Internet and intranet sites these days, Web development
experts are the authors (that is, they design and build it from scratch, or
at least set up its basic framework). After a site is established, it may then
need to grow and change — which in the past meant calling in that handy
Web development expert again to update a Web site. Now, however, people
more familiar with the content that needs to go on the site than with the
vagaries of Web development are being asked to take on the responsibility of
updating the original pages or adding new pages based on existing designs.
The original version of Dreamweaver was built to enable people to create
and modify Web pages without having to learn the boring ins and outs of
HTML. The funny thing is that Dreamweaver CS3 has become so powerful as
an authoring tool that for many day-to-day editors and authors of Web sites,
Dreamweaver offers far more functionality than is required.
So what’s a nonexpert to do? Read on to discover the answer.
Why Contribute?
When Dreamweaver is too much, Contribute is just right. Contribute is
designed especially for people who must contribute to an existing site but
don’t need to know how to develop a site from scratch.
Contribute is streamlined to make Web page production as simple as possi-
ble, which means that the application can’t do many things, such as edit the
HTML making up the page. (However, Contribute CS3 can be set up to allow
specified users to launch and edit HTML in Dreamweaver.) For those kinds
of tasks, you definitely still need Dreamweaver. Table 1-1 offers a list of some
common Web page tasks for which each application can be used.

As you can see, the capabilities overlap quite a bit, but the more compli-
cated tasks are best accomplished using Dreamweaver.
Exploring the Contribute Interface
The Contribute interface is as streamlined as its functionality, as you can see
in Figure 1-1. Two panels are on the left, with a big work area — known as the
Browser — on the right.
Panel basics
While other applications in Adobe CS3 have many customizable panels,
Contribute has just two basic panels: Pages and How Do I, as shown in
Figure 1-1. In contrast to the panels in other Adobe CS3 applications, you
can’t move, group, or delete the panels in Contribute.

Book VI
Chapter 1

Contribute CS3

717
You can, however, collapse and expand the panels by double-clicking the
panel name. If the panel was expanded before you clicked, it collapses. If it
was collapsed originally, it expands.
The Pages panel
The Pages panel displays the name of the most recent page you browsed to,
any unpublished drafts (that is, any pages you have downloaded and edited
but not uploaded back to the server), and the page on which you’re cur-
rently working. Figure 1-2 shows that we’re connected to the Grasp Magazine
site, and that we have a draft of the home page that has been edited but not
yet uploaded.
To navigate to any page listed in the Pages panel, click the title or the icon to
the left of the page you want displayed in the Browser.
If you click the page at the top of the list, the Browser automatically
switches to Browse mode. If you’re already in Browse mode and you click a
draft, the Browser automatically switches to Edit mode and displays your
page, ready to edit.
The Browser is always at the top of the list in the Pages panel. See “The
Browser/Editor” section, later in this chapter, for more information on the
Browser itself.

The How Do I panel
The How Do I panel shows several options when you open Contribute for the
first time
✦Get Started with My Website
✦Add a Page to My Website
✦Add Content to a Web Page
✦Modify a Web Page
✦Finish Up with My Website
✦Work with Blogs
✦Administer a Website
It’s easy to collapse or expand a section; just click the arrow at the left of the
section name, or click the section name itself. If the section is expanded
when you click, it collapses. If the section is collapsed when you click, it
expands.
Each section has a list of actions you might want to perform. The list is in
the form of text links, just as on a Web page. The list of links changes, based
on what you’re currently working on. We collapsed the sections in Figure 1-2
so that you can see some of the other sections that show up automatically in
the How Do I panel when you’re editing a page.

When you click a link, the How Do I panel updates, as shown in Figure 1-3. To
return to the previous page of information in the panel, click the Back button
at the top left of the How Do I panel. To go back to the original list of links,
click the Topics icon at the top right of the panel.
The Browser/Editor
The main work area is called the Browser/Editor. (We call it the Browser to
save space.) The Browser has two modes, Browse and Edit, and you can only
be in one mode at a time. The appearance and functionality of the Browser
depend on which mode you’re in.
When you’re in Browse mode in the Browser, you can navigate anywhere a
regular Web browser, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari, could take
you. When you’re in Edit mode, you can make changes to a Web page.
Browse mode
To browse to a page you want to update, you must use the Browser in its
Browse mode. You can tell when the Browser is in Browse mode by looking
at the buttons at the top. The following buttons (as shown in Figure 1-4)
allow you to navigate as you would using any browser, such as IE:
✦Back: Click this button to view the page you were previously viewing in
the Browser. You can step back one page at a time through each of the
pages you viewed since you opened the Browser. The Back option in the
View menu performs the same function.
✦Forward: Click Forward to go one page at a time from pages you viewed
earlier to pages you viewed most recently.

✦Stop: Pages with lots of big images or complex Flash movies sometimes
take awhile to load in the Browser. Click this button to stop a page from
loading further in the Browser.
✦Refresh: As with your regular Web browser’s Refresh button, this button
reloads the current Web page in the Contribute Browser. The rest of the
buttons are specific to the Contribute Browser.
✦Edit Page: Click this button to edit the page you have browsed to. When
you click Edit, Contribute downloads the page and automatically sets the
Browser to Edit mode. This option is not available if you don’t have what
Contribute calls a connection — that is, permission to edit the page.
✦New Page: Click this button to create a new page on the current Web
site. You are prompted to name the page and, if you desire, to choose a
page or template to use as a basis for the new page. See Book VI,
Chapter 2 for more details.
✦Home Pages: Use this button to navigate quickly to the home pages of
the sites to which you have Contribute connections. Click and hold to
see a drop-down list of eligible home pages.
✦Go: This button works in conjunction with the Address text input field.
See the following instructions for browsing to a page on the Internet.
✦Choose: Click this button to open a dialog box in which you can navigate
quickly to any page on the Web site you’re currently updating.
✦Go to Bridge: This is a new feature to Contribute CS3 that allows you to
connect to Adobe Bridge to manage all your files across the various CS3
products.
To browse to a page on the Internet, just follow these simple steps:
1. Type or paste a URL (such as www.graspmagazine.com) into the
Address field at the top of the Browser.
2. Click the Go button at the right of the Address input field or press
Enter.
The requested Web page opens in the Browser.

When you browse to a site that you have been set up to edit, the top left of
the Browser toolbar has two buttons: Edit Page and New Page. When you
browse to a page that you are not set up to edit, the buttons are replaced by
the Create Connection button. (See the section on connecting to a site in
Book VI, Chapter 2 for more information on creating connections.)
Edit mode
The Edit mode is what Contribute is all about: It’s the mode that you use to
make changes to Web pages. To get into Edit mode after you’ve browsed to
an editable page, do one of the following:
✦Click the Edit Page button at the top left of the Browser.
✦Choose File➪Edit Page.
✦Press Ctrl+Shift+E (Ô+E on a Mac).
To get into Edit mode if you haven’t yet browsed to a page you have permis-
sion to edit, click the name of an existing draft in the Pages panel (or click
the icon next to the name). The draft opens in the Browser, and the Browser
automatically switches to Edit mode.
Most of Book VI, Chapter 2 is about the things you can do in Edit mode, so if
you’re anxious to get to work on a site, skip ahead to the next chapter.
Menus
The Contribute menu bar sports eight menus, each of which includes several
choices. (Many of the choices are also available from buttons at the top of the
Browser.) We give you some details about the most important functions in the
first three menus, as well as brief descriptions of what the other five offer:
✦File: Every computer program has a File menu, with options such as
Open, Save, and the like. The Contribute File menu offers the following:
• New Page: Select this option to create a new Web page. You can
create a new page from scratch, from an existing page, or from a
Dreamweaver CS3 template. See Book VI, Chapter 2 for details.
• Actions: The Actions option groups the most common functions in a
submenu. See File➪Actions, later in this list, for details.
• Save: Select this option to save the work you have done on a draft
without publishing the edited page. After saving, you may continue
working on the draft.
• Save for Later: Select this option to save the work you have done on
a draft without publishing the edited page; the Browser will automat-
ically change from Edit mode to Browse mode and load the last page
you were looking at in Browse mode.

Exploring the Contribute Interface
722
• Publish File from My Computer: With this option, you can move a
file directly from your computer or shared network to a remote
server where your Web site is located. This is handy when you need
to move files — an Excel file for example — that you don’t need to
edit in Contribute.
• Send File from My Computer: This is similar to the preceding
Publish option except that it’s used for situations in which a user
needs to have a file reviewed before sending, or when the user does-
n’t have access to a remote server.
• Preview in Browser: Select this to see what your draft looks like in
your regular browser (IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and so on).
• Export: Select Export to save a copy of the page you’re working on to
your local hard drive (or to a removable disk or remote hard drive).
• Page Setup: Select this option to open a dialog box that allows you
to customize how your printer deals with your page (paper size, ori-
entation, and so on).
• Print: As you might expect, you can print your Web page by selecting
Print from the File menu.
• Print Preview: Select Print Preview to see on your computer screen
a representation of how your Web page will appear on paper when
you print it.
• Delete Page: Select Delete Page to remove a page from your Web site.
This option is available only when the Browser is in Browse mode.
• Work Offline: Select this option if you don’t need to upload or down-
load any unpublished drafts you’re editing, or if you’re temporarily
unable to connect with your network or the Internet.
• Drafts: Use this option to open an unpublished draft of a page.
• Recently Published Pages: Use this option to view in the Browser a
page you recently published.
• Exit: Select this option to close Contribute. You can also close
Contribute by pressing Ctrl+Q or Alt+F4 on your keyboard.
✦File➪Actions: This new submenu groups together all the most common
publishing actions (as shown in Figure 1-5). Many of these actions are
available as buttons in the Browser.
• Edit Page: This option is available only when the Browser is in Browse
mode and is currently displaying a page you have permission to edit.
When you choose File➪Actions ➪Edit Page, Contribute downloads the
page to your computer and makes it available for modification.
Clicking the Edit Page button in the Browser does the same thing.

• Send for Review: Select this to upload a temporary version of your
page to the server and send an e-mail to a co-worker with a link to
the temporary page. If you need someone’s approval before you pub-
lish a page (that is, before you make it live on the site so users can
see it), E-mail Review is a handy automated way to show your work
to the person who can approve it.
• Publish: Select this option to upload an edited page to the server.
• Publish as New Page: Select this option to upload a page to the server
with a new filename (such as aboutus.htm). You’re prompted to type
or paste in the new filename. See Book VI, Chapter 2 for details.
• Cancel Draft: Select this to delete the draft you’re currently working
on from your computer. Note: Selecting Cancel Draft does not delete
the page from your Web site.
• Undo Send: Select this to remove a draft from a reviewer’s Pages
panel and put it back in yours. If the reviewer has sent the draft to
another reviewer, you can’t undo the send.
• Edit Page Source in External Application: Select this to launch
Dreamweaver (or another text editor) to edit the underlying HTML
source code of the page. Your site administrator must enable this
option in order for you to use it.
• Roll Back to Previous Version: If you find that you’ve published a
page that has a mistake on it, select Roll Back to Previous Version to
restore the previously published version of the page. See Book VI,
Chapter 3 for more information on this feature, which must be set up
by an administrator.

• Delete Page: Select this to delete the page you’re currently editing.
This will delete both your draft and the page on the server. Depending
on your permissions, this option may not be available to you.
• Delete Draft: Select this to delete the draft you’re currently editing. If
you’re editing an existing page, the last saved version of the page will
remain on the server.
✦Edit: The options under the Edit menu include such perennial favorites
as Cut and Paste, as well as a few Contribute-specific options. Which
options are live (not grayed out) at any given time depends on your
most recent action.
• Undo: Select this option to undo your most recent actions in a draft,
one at a time. You can’t use Undo to alter a published page; for that,
you need to choose File➪Actions➪Roll Back. The keyboard shortcut
for Undo is Ctrl+Z.
• Redo: Redo is sort of an undo of an undo. Select this option to redo
the last actions you undid in your draft, one at a time, or press Ctrl+Y.
• Cut: Select this option to remove highlighted text or objects from
your draft. You can then paste the text or objects into the same page,
a different page, or even a different kind of document (for example, a
Word document). The keyboard shortcut to cut highlighted objects
is Ctrl+X.
• Paste: After you’ve selected some text or objects (images, for exam-
ple), select this option to paste the text or objects into your draft, or
press Ctrl+V.
• Paste Text Only: After selecting a block of text that also includes
images or other objects, you can use this option to paste only the
text from your selection. You can also press Ctrl+Shift+V.
• Clear: Use this option to remove selected text or objects from your
Web page. In contrast to Cut, this option does not allow you to paste
the removed text or objects elsewhere.
• Find: Use this option to find any string of characters (a word or
phrase, for example) on a page you’re currently editing. You can also
automatically replace that string with another string (such as chang-
ing, say, “Go back to top” to “Go to top”). If the string appears multi-
ple times on the page, you can change each instance one at a time or
click Replace All and change every instance at once.
• Select All: Use this option to select everything in a draft. You can
then cut, paste, or clear everything at once. The keyboard shortcut
for selecting all is Ctrl+A.
• Preferences: Select this option to open a dialog box that allows you
to customize the way Contribute works. See the “Setting Preferences”
section, later in this chapter, for details.

• My Connections: Use this option to view, edit, and delete the connec-
tions you have to the sites you maintain.
• Administer Websites: If you have Administrator privileges on a
site to which you have a connection, use this option to open the
Administration dialog box and change any settings for the selected
site. See Book VI, Chapter 3 for information on sitewide settings,
permission groups, and setting up users.
If you’re using the Mac version of Adobe Contribute CS3, you’ll find the final
three items on the preceding list under the Contribute menu just to the right
of the Apple menu.
✦View: The View menu offers options related to what you see on-screen
in Contribute.
• Sidebar: Select this option to show or hide the sidebar, which con-
tains the Pages and How Do I panels.
• Home Pages: Select this option to open the home page for any site
you can connect to in Contribute.
• Draft Console: Select this option to view the Draft Console, which
shows you any drafts you have edited but not published, as well as
any drafts you have been asked to review or have sent to someone
else to view.
• Refresh Drafts: Select this option to update the Draft Console.
• Draft History: If you have received a draft for review, you can select
this option to open a window in which you can read a history of the
changes made to the draft.
• Browser: Select this option to switch to Browse mode. The last page
you looked at in that mode appears in the Browser. You can press
Ctrl+Shift+B or click the top line in the Pages panel to do the same
thing.
• Go to Web Address: If you select this option, a dialog box opens in
which you can type or paste a URL to open a particular Web page in
the Browser. When you click OK, the Browser switches to Browse
mode — if it wasn’t already — and loads the page you requested. You
can also press Ctrl+O (Ô+D on a Mac) to open the Go to Web
Address dialog box.
• Choose File on Website: This option allows you to navigate directly
to an editable page from a window that displays all the sites to which
you have a Contribute connection.
The Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh, and Home Pages options function
just the same as their corresponding buttons in the Browser. See the
“Browse mode” section, earlier in this chapter, for the skinny on them.

✦Bookmarks: A bookmark is a link to a Web page. Options here allow you
to add and delete bookmarks to Web pages that you visit often. If your
main Web browser is IE, you see all your IE bookmarks listed under the
Other Bookmarks option.
✦Insert: Select an option in this menu to insert an item into a draft. The
Insert menu allows you to insert the following items into a draft:
• Table

• Flash
• Special characters
• Video
• PayPal tool
• PDF document
• Google search field
• Enclosure
• HMTL snippets
✦Format: You can use the options in this menu to format selected text in
a draft. You can apply CSS styles, as well as more traditional HTML text
treatments such as bold and italic. See Book VI, Chapter 2 for details on
text formatting in Contribute. The Format menu also gives you access to
the Contribute spell checker (keyboard shortcut: F7) and allows you to
edit page properties, such as title and background color (keyboard
shortcut: Ctrl+J).
✦Table: This menu offers commands that allow you to insert and edit
tables in your draft.
✦Help: The Help menu gives you a choice of several kinds of help:
• Adobe Contribute Help: Select this option to view standard help
files, with step-by-step instructions.
• Quick Start Guide: Select this option to see instructions on
Contribute to help get you up and running quickly.
• Contribute Support Center: When you select this option, your regu-
lar Web browser opens to the Contribute Support home page on
Adobe’s Web site.
• Contribute Tutorial: Select this option to access a set of guided les-
sons on basic tasks you can perform with Contribute.
The Help menu also allows you to open the Contribute Welcome
page in the Browser, print your Contribute registration form, submit
your registration online, and see the About Contribute window,
which shows information about the version you’re running.

Setting Preferences
For most users, the default Preferences should suffice, but you may wish (or
need) to make a few changes in order to use Contribute most efficiently. To
open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences on a PC, or
Contribute➪Preferences on a Mac.
The Preferences dialog box includes nine “screens”; you access the different
screens by selecting one of the items in the list on the left side of the dialog
box; see Figure 1-6. A brief overview of each page follows.
Setting Blog Defaults preferences
By default, the Preferences dialog box opens to the Blog Defaults screen.
Here, if you’re using Contribute to manage your personal or corporate blog,
you can set the following items:
✦Select which blog should be the default blog for your Web site.
✦Change the default behavior of the New button in Contribute so that it
maps to creating a blog entry as opposed to creating a new Web page.
✦Set up your blog to allow outside users to add their comments.
✦Enable the trackback URL feature so that other blog authors can link
from their Web site to your blog entries.

Setting Editing preferences
From this screen, you can choose a dictionary language from the drop-down
list. Contribute uses the dictionary to spell-check Web page drafts.
Setting File Editors preferences
You can tell Contribute what application you want it to use to open various
types of files when you double-click the files in the Browser in Edit mode. To
set Contribute to open a particular type of file with a particular application,
just follow these steps:
1. Select File Editors from the list on the left side of the Preferences
dialog box.
The File Editors options appear, as shown in Figure 1-7.
2. If the extension is not already listed in the Extensions list box, click
the + (plus) button above the Extensions box.
If the extension is already listed in the Extensions box, skip to Step 4.
A cursor blinks at the bottom of the list.
3. Type the name of the extension, including the dot (for example, type
.wav for a WAV audio file), and press Enter.
The extension you typed remains highlighted.

4. If the application is not already listed, click the + button above the
Editors box.
If the application is listed, click its name to select it and skip to Step 6.
The Select External Editor dialog box pops up.
5. Navigate to the application and double-click its icon, or type the path-
name (including the application name) into the File Name text field.
The application name appears in the Editors box.
6. Set any other file editor preferences and click OK when you’re
finished.
Contribute comes with quite a few defaults (naturally, Adobe Studio CS3
applications feature prominently), so you may never need to touch the File
Editors preferences. You can assign more than one application to edit a par-
ticular file type. If you do that, you need to designate one of the programs as
the primary application by selecting it in the File Editors screen of the
Preferences dialog box and clicking the Make Primary button.
Setting FTP Proxy preferences
If your computer is separated by a firewall from the server that houses your
site (or sites), use the FTP Proxy screen of the Preferences dialog box to
input the host name and port number that allow you to tunnel through the
firewall. If you’re not sure what all that means, ask someone in your IT
department.
Setting Invisible Elements preferences
When you link some text or an image to a particular line on a Web page, you
need to place an invisible target (an anchor) at that line. Select Invisible
Elements in the list box on the left of the Preferences dialog box to see the
Invisible Elements options. Leave the Show Section Anchors When Editing a
Page check box selected if you want to be able to see icons that identify
where invisible anchor links are in your draft.
Setting PDF Documents preferences
In previous versions of Contribute, a preferences area was dedicated to
Microsoft integration. With the Adobe purchase of Macromedia and subse-
quent integration, that preference area is history. In its place, you now find
an Adobe PDF Preferences pane. Ironically, though, the contents of the
Preferences pane are nearly identical to the other Microsoft one.

Setting Preferences
730
When inserting a PDF document into Contribute, you can choose to have it
be a link, have it directly embedded in the document, or have Contribute
prompt you to choose one of those options when inserting.
Setting Ping Servers preferences
The Ping Servers preferences panel is another nod toward the fact that
Contribute is a blog-oriented product. In many cases, you want to notify
other sources when you make a blog post. This notification, often called a
“ping,” can be automated with Contribute. The Ping Servers panel is where
you can set up these pings. Using the plus (+) or minus (–) buttons, you can
add a server to notify you when a blog entry is posted. In addition, you can
specify the number of blog entries.
Setting Security preferences
If you share a computer with other people and don’t want them to have
access to Contribute (and therefore to the sites you maintain), open up the
Security options in the Preferences dialog box and select the Encrypt
Connection Information For All Websites check box. Then follow these steps:
1. Click in the Password text field, type a password, and press the Tab key.
The cursor moves to the Confirm Password text field.
2. Retype your password in the Confirm Password text field exactly as
you typed it in the Password text field. Go on to Step 3, or press Enter
or click OK.
Contribute asks for a password when you launch the application.
3. Select the Require Password at Startup option if you want users to
enter a password in order to launch the application.
4. Press Enter or click OK.
You can change your preferences at any time by choosing Edit➪Preferences
(Contribute➪Preferences on a Mac).
Setting Tagging preferences
Tags are a way to both gain exposure for your blog and help it get organized.
A tag is simply a way to identify the content of a blog posting by using a
handful of words. So, if you have an entry about remodeling your kitchen,
you might use the tags “appliances,” “counter,” and “cabinets.” You can
create your own tag repository or use others that are out there on the
Internet. Using the Contribute tagging preferences, you can select the loca-
tion within your posting of where the tags will show up, in addition to adding
tag repositories and prefixes for your tags.

ontribute CS3 is a remarkably easy-to-use tool for editing existing
pages on — or adding new pages to — a Web site. As with the original
Contribute version, many of the things you need to do to add or replace
content (or build a page based on an existing design) take little more than
a click — and you don’t have to know a thing about HTML.
With Contribute CS3, Adobe has added many features to the last version of
the application while keeping it simple enough for nontechnical users — no
small task. This chapter is all about how using the Contribute CS3 tools can
make modifying or creating a basic Web page easier. If you need to know
about things such as setting yourself up as a site administrator or sending a
connection key to a fellow site contributor, see Book VI, Chapter 3.
Connecting to a Site
To put Contribute CS3 to use when working on a Web site, you must be con-
nected to that site. Being connected means establishing an FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) connection between your computer and the remote server that
your site lives on. If that sounds complicated, don’t worry. It’s actually pretty
simple.

Connecting to a Site
732
You can connect in two ways:
✦By using a connection key that the site administrator has e-mailed to you
✦By entering information in the Connection Wizard
Both ways are pretty simple, but you’ll need some information about your
Web server to employ the latter method. If you’ve been sent a connection
key, read the next section to find out how to use it. If you need to connect to
a site but don’t have a key, skip ahead to the “Connecting to a site with the
Connection Wizard” section.
Connecting to a site with the connection key
A connection key is an encrypted file that contains nearly all the information
Contribute needs to connect your program copy to the Web site you’re
updating. (You also need to get a password from your administrator.) You
might receive a connection key
✦Via e-mail from the site administrator
✦By downloading it from your local network
Most likely, you’ll get your connection key via e-mail, but it works the same
either way (just skip Step 2). To open a connection to the Web site you’ll be
working on, just follow these simple steps:
1. Open the e-mail from your site administrator that contains the connec-
tion key.
The connection key shows up as an attachment; see Figure 2-1. The
e-mail body contains instructions on using the key. The connection key
name is based on the name the site administrator gives the site connec-
tion in Contribute.
2. Double-click the connection key.
Contribute starts up (if it’s not already open), and the Import
Connection Key dialog box opens.
3. If your name is not already there, click in the What Is Your Name? text
field and type your name.
4. Press Tab or click in the E-mail text field.
5. If your e-mail address is not already there, type your e-mail address in
the next field.
6. Press Tab or click in the next text field.
If you already have a connection to another Web site, your e-mail
address may already be entered in the field.

7. In the What Is the Connection Key Password? text field, type the pass-
word given to you by the site administrator.
The password may have been sent in a separate e-mail or told to you
on the phone. If you don’t yet know the password, check with the site
administrator.
8. Click OK.
The Contribute Browser loads the site’s home page.
The connection key should have all the FTP information that allows you to
connect to your Web server. In some cases, you may have to input the FTP
information manually. The next section tells you how.
Connecting to a site with the Connection Wizard
Contribute saves you the trouble of having to use an FTP client to move Web
pages back and forth between your computer and the server that hosts your
Web site. When you click the Edit button in the Browser, Contribute automat-
ically gets (downloads) the page for editing. When you click the Publish

button, Contribute puts (uploads) the page on the Web server. After you’ve
set up a connection, Contribute transparently handles all the downloading
and uploading.
The Connection Wizard makes connecting to a remote Web server a snap, if
you have the login information at hand. Just follow these steps to set up a
connection, after you’ve opened Contribute:
1. Type or paste the URL for your site (for example, www.MySite.com)
into the Address field of the Contribute Browser.
2. Either press Enter or click the Go button.
The Contribute Browser takes you right to your site.
You can use the Contribute Browser to view any site on the Web, but you
can only set up a connection to a site if you have FTP information for
that site.
3. Click the Create Connection button at the top left of the Browser.
The Connection Wizard opens to its Welcome screen.
4. We’re assuming that you don’t have a connection key, so click the
Continue button at the bottom of the wizard.
The Website Home Page screen appears.
5. Enter the URL (www.MySite.com, for example) for the Web site you’ll
be editing into the text field and then click Continue.
You can also click the Browse button, which opens a browser window
for navigating to the site.
When you click Continue, the Connection Information screen appears in
the wizard.
6. Select a connection method from the drop-down list.
You have the following options: FTP, Secure FTP (SFTP), Local/Network,
and WebDAV. If you’re not sure what to select, check with your IT person
or site administrator. Depending on what you choose, different text
fields appear below the drop-down list. As you can see in Figure 2-2,
we’ve entered FTP.
7a. If in Step 6 you selected FTP or SFTP, enter the FTP server name (for
example, ftp.EarlsBowlateria.com), the FTP login, and the FTP pass-
word in the respective text fields. Click Continue.
The FTP login is sometimes called the username.
The Testing Connection window appears. When the connection is con-
firmed, the User Information screen appears.

7b. If in Step 6 you selected Local/Network, enter the network path (for
example, \\mynetwork\mydepartment\site) by typing, by pasting, or
by clicking the Choose Folder button and browsing in your network to
the folder containing your site. Click Continue.
The User Information screen appears.
8. Enter your name in the What Is Your Full Name? text field.
Your name may already appear. The name in this field identifies you to
other contributors to your site, if there are any.
9. If it’s not already there, enter your e-mail address in the What Is Your
E-mail Address? text field and then click Continue.
If your site already has an administrator, the Role Information screen
appears. Go to Step 10. If the site doesn’t have an administrator, the
Summary screen appears. Go to Step 11.
10. Click the role you’re assigned to and click Continue.
If you click Administrator, a pop-up window may appear. Enter the
Administrator password and click OK. Congratulations! You’ve made it
to the Summary screen.
11. Make sure that the Summary screen information is correct.
If it isn’t, use the Back button to go to the screen with incorrect info and
fix the mistake; then use the Continue button to return to the Summary
screen.
12. Click Done.
Unless any of the information you put in the Connection Wizard changes,
you never have to think about it again — from here on, you can just get
straight to work making changes to your site.
If you want to make yourself the site administrator, see Book VI, Chapter 3.

Opening an Existing Page for Editing
After you’ve established a connection to your site, you’re ready to start
making changes to existing pages and even creating new ones. Downloading
a page to edit is extremely easy — just follow these steps:
1. Type or paste the URL of the page you want to edit (for example,
www.MySite.com) into the Address field of the Contribute Browser.
2. Either press Enter or click the Go button.
The Browser loads your page, and the Edit Page and New Page buttons
appear at the top left of the Browser. If the page is not available for edit-
ing, the warning You are viewing a page on a Web site that
you haven’t created a connection to appears under the
Address field in the Browser.
3. Click the Edit Page button.
The Browser switches to Edit mode, and the page appears as a draft in
the Browser. The Browser’s toolbar at the top changes to show buttons
for inserting links, images, tables, and text, as shown in Figure 2-3.

Creating a New Page
737
Creating a New Page
If opening a page for editing is a snap, creating a new page is maybe three
snaps. To create a new page for your site, follow these simple steps:
1. If you have connections to more than one Web site, use the Contribute
Browser to go to the site to which you want to add a page. Otherwise,
skip to Step 2.
The Browser loads your page, and the Edit Page and New Page buttons
appear at the top left of the Browser. If the site is not available for edit-
ing, the warning You are viewing a page on a Web site that
you haven’t created a connection to appears under the
Address field in the Browser.
2. Click the New Page button or choose File➪New Page.
The New Page dialog box appears.
3a. If you want the new page to have the same basic appearance and
structure (for example, to have the same navigation items and basic
layout) as the page currently showing in your browser, click the Copy
of Current Page in the New Page dialog box.
3b. If you want to create a page from a Dreamweaver CS3 template, click
the template name in the Create New Page From pane.
If the templates are in a folder and you don’t see them, click the arrow
next to the folder that holds the templates; the contents of the folder
appear. A template preview appears in the Preview pane, as shown in
Figure 2-4.
3c. If you want to start the page from scratch, skip to Step 4.
The Blank Web Page option may not be available to you, depending on
how the administrator has set up your connection.
4. Type or paste a page title in the Page Title text field. Click OK.
Your new page opens in the Browser, as a draft ready for editing. The
page title appears at the top of the Web browser’s window when people
view your Web site.
You can also create a new page by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N.

Working with Text
738
Working with Text
Text is often the most abundant element on a Web site. Contribute makes
adding, formatting, and deleting text a piece of cake.
Adding text
To add text to a draft (that is, to a page that’s ready for editing; see the previ-
ous sections, “Opening an Existing Page for Editing” or “Creating a New
Page”), just follow these easy steps:
1. Click the place in the draft where you want to insert text.
A cursor blinks in the spot you selected.
2. Type or paste the text.
You may need to format the text. See the next section for the lowdown.
Formatting text
Text formatting entails everything from setting a font face and font size, to
emphasizing words or phrases by making them bold or italic, to creating
numbered or bulleted lists. It’s all as easy as clicking a button in Contribute.
You can format text either before or after you insert it on a page. If you’re
working from a template, text areas may be preformatted for things like font
size, color, and face. If not, the text you insert conforms to the settings in the
text toolbar (the second row of the Browser).

Setting a text style
To set the font style, choose a style from the Style drop-down list at the top
left. If you have CSS styles attached to your page, they appear in the menu;
otherwise, your choices are Normal and Heading 1 (largest) through Heading 6
(smallest).
Setting a text face
To set a face for your font (for example, Arial, Verdana, and so on), choose
one from the Font drop-down list (to the right of the Style list). If you leave
the setting at Default, the text’s appearance is determined by a site visitor’s
browser settings.
Setting a text size
Choose a text size from the Size drop-down list. The smallest is 11, and the
largest is 96 (too big for most uses). If you select Default, the text’s size is
determined by a site visitor’s browser settings. Figure 2-5 shows just some of
the ways you can format text.
Selecting text
To select text, click and drag over the text you want. The selected text is
highlighted. If you change the style, font face, size, color, or background
color settings while text in your draft is selected, the selected text (and only
it) changes to reflect the new settings.

Aligning text
Contribute allows you to align text to the left, center, or right, or to justify
the text at the left and right (though the latter is extremely rare on the Web).
To align text, place the cursor anywhere in the block of text you want to
align (or select a block of text by clicking and dragging) and click an Align
button (from left to right, the Align buttons are Align Left, Align Center, Align
Right, and Justify).
Adding boldface to your text
To make some text bold, follow these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
bold is highlighted.
2. Click the Bold button or press Ctrl+B.
The selected text becomes bold.
You can remove the bold formatting from text by following the same steps.
Italicizing your text
To italicize some text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Italic button or press Ctrl+I.
The selected text becomes italicized.
You can remove the italic formatting from text by following the same steps.
Changing the text color
Web text is typically black by default but can be set to default to other
colors. If you’re working with CSS styles or Dreamweaver templates, default
text colors may be set for you already.
To change the color of a specific block of text, follow these steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Text Color button in the Browser’s Text toolbar.
The Text Color button is the one on the second row, toward the right,
with a capital A on it. When you click it, the color picker pops up.

Changing the text background color
When you change the text background color, you’re changing just that: the
background of each chunk of text, be it letters or numbers.
To change the text background color of some text, follow these simple steps:
1. Select the text by clicking and dragging until all the text you want
changed is highlighted.
2. Click the Highlight Color button in the Browser’s Text toolbar, as
shown in Figure 2-6.
The Highlight Color button is the one with the highlighter marker; it’s
just to the right of the Text Color button. When you click the Highlight
Color button, the color picker pops up.

Creating a numbered list
You can create a numbered list the fancy way, with complicated tables and
such, or you can do it the easy way, using the numbered list convention built
into HTML. Contribute makes the easy way even easier. To create a num-
bered list, just follow these steps:
1. Click the Numbered List button in the Browser’s toolbar, as shown in
Figure 2-7.
The indented number 1 appears, followed by a period, a space, and a
blinking cursor.
2. Type the first item in your numbered list. Press Enter when you’re
finished.
The number 2 automatically appears on the next line, followed by a
period, a space, and a blinking cursor.
3. Type the second item in your numbered list, press Enter, and con-
tinue to enter items until you have completed your list.
Leave the extra number for which you don’t have an item.
4. Click the Numbered List button to deactivate the numbering.
The last (extra) number disappears and the cursor goes to its non-
indented position below the list.
Creating a bulleted list
HTML has a specification for bulleted lists, just as it does for numbered lists.
Contribute knows the specification so you don’t have to. To create a bulleted
list, simply follow these steps:
1. Click the Bulleted List button in the Browser’s toolbar.
An indented bullet appears, followed by a little space and a blinking
cursor.
2. Type the first bullet item and press the Enter key.
A bullet appears on the next line, followed by a little space and a blink-
ing cursor.
3. Type the second bullet item, press the Enter key, and repeat the
process until you have completed your list.
An extra bullet remains temporarily at the bottom of your list.
4. Click the Bulleted List button to deactivate the bulleting.
The last (extra) bullet disappears and the cursor goes to its non-
indented position below the list.

Working with Tables
743
Working with Tables
You might use tables on a Web page in two basic ways:
✦To display tabular information, such as a spreadsheet
✦To control page layout
No matter which function you want the table to have, you can add, modify,
and delete the table using the same simple methods. Tables are made up of
cells, arranged in rows and columns. Picture a basic tic-tac-toe game. It’s
played on a kind of table, with nine cells arranged in three rows and three
columns. If you can draw a tic-tac-toe game, you can make a table on a Web
page.
Inserting a table
To insert a table into your page, just follow these steps:
1. Click the spot in your draft where you want the top-left corner of the
table to go.
A blinking cursor marks the spot.
Figure 2-7:
Contribute
allows you
to create
numbered
and bulleted
lists easily.

Working with Tables
744
2. Click the Insert Table button in the top row of the Browser toolbar.
The Insert Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-8.
3. Enter the number of rows you want the table to have in the Number of
Rows field.
You can always add or delete extra rows later, if you need to.
4. In the Number of Columns field, enter the number of columns you
want the table to have.
You can always add or delete extra columns later.
5a. If it doesn’t matter how wide the table is, leave the Default Width set-
ting as is and skip to Step 6.
5b. If you want a particular width, select the Specific Width radio button,
enter a number for the width, and then choose either Pixels or
Percent from the drop-down list to the right.
If you choose Pixels, the table will be the number of pixels wide that you
specified. If you choose Percent, you must choose a numeral between 1
and 100; the table’s width will vary according to the overall page layout,
and it may vary according to the width of a site visitor’s browser window.
6. In the Border Thickness field, enter a number for how many pixels
thick you want the border of your table to be.
If you don’t want the table border to show (which you probably don’t if
you’re using the table for page layout purposes), enter 0 (zero).

7. In the Cell Padding field, enter a number for the amount of pixels
you want between the border of the cell and the text or object inside
the cell.
The cell padding applies to the top, bottom, left, and right of the inside
of each and every cell.
8. In the Cell Spacing field, enter a number for the amount of pixels you
want between the cells.
The cell spacing applies to the whole table; you can’t have different cell
spacing for individual rows or columns.
9. If your table has a header row or header column (or both), click the
icon that represents the header structure.
Figure 2-9 shows a table with a single header row. The text in that row
is automatically bold and center-aligned in the cells.
10. Click OK.
The Insert Table dialog box closes, and an empty table appears in your
draft, built to your specifications and ready to be filled with content.
Adding information to a table
Adding text and images to a table is pretty much the same as adding them
anywhere else on a draft. To add text to a table, follow these steps:
1. Click in the cell where you want to put the text.
A cursor blinks in the cell.
2. Type or paste in the text.
The cell expands downwards. In some cases, the cell also expands to the
right, depending on its width and the nature of the text. For example, a
long e-mail address, which is made of many characters strung together
without a space, can stretch a cell. (Refer to Figure 2-9.) The other cells
may become narrower to compensate.
3. Click in another cell or outside the table if you want to add more
information to the table or elsewhere on the draft.
To add an image or other object to a cell, click in the cell and then follow
the directions in the “Adding Images, Links, and More” section, later in this
chapter.
Modifying a table
You can modify many properties of an existing table quickly and easily. In
some cases, you can make the changes by clicking and dragging table or cell
borders; in other cases, you can enter new settings in the Table Properties
dialog box.

Working with Tables
746
Changing the whole table using the Table Properties dialog box
To make changes to the entire table at once, follow these steps:
1. Select the table by placing your cursor over the top-left or bottom-left
corner of the table until the cursor changes into a four-pointed arrow;
then, click.
The border of the table highlights.
2. Click the Table button on the Browser toolbar.
Yes, it’s the same button you click to insert a table, but when you’ve
selected a table that’s already there, the button opens the Table
Properties dialog box. The dialog box has two tabs: Table and Row
and Column. (The default view opens to the Table tab, as shown in
Figure 2-10.)
3. Select an alignment from the Table Alignment drop-down list.
A table can be justified left, center, or right.
4. Change the table width, border thickness, cell padding, and cell spac-
ing as needed.
For more information on those table properties, see the “Inserting a
table” section, earlier in this chapter.
5. To change the border color, click the Border Color icon and use the
color picker to choose a color.

6. To change the color of the table’s background, click the Background
Color icon and use the color picker to choose a color.
7. To change other properties, click the Row and Column tab at the top
of the dialog box.
The Row and Column options appear. If you have selected only a row
and not the whole table, the tab says Row. Likewise, if you have selected
only a column and not the whole table, the tab reads Column.
8. To change the horizontal alignment of elements in each cell, select an
option from the Horizontal Alignment drop-down list.
Your options are Default, Left, Center, and Right. Choosing Default allows
the visitor’s browser to set the cells’ alignment.
9. To change the vertical alignment of elements in each cell, select an
option from the Vertical Alignment drop-down list.
Your options are Default, Top, Middle, and Bottom. Choosing Default
allows the visitor’s browser to set the cells’ alignment.
10. To change the background color for the cells in the table, click the
Background Color icon and use the color picker to choose a color.
11. Decide how you want to determine column width:
• If you want the table’s column width to be allotted automatically,
select the Fit to Contents radio button.
• If you want to set the column widths to a specific number of pixels or
percentage of the overall width, select the radio button underneath
the Fit to Contents radio button, enter a number in the text field, and
select either Pixels or Percent from the drop-down list.

If you insert something in a cell that is wider than you have set the
column to handle, the cell overrides your column width setting to
accommodate the element, be it an image or a long string of text.
12. If you want to keep all the text on a single line within the cells, dese-
lect the Wrap Text check box. Otherwise, leave the Wrap Text check
box selected.
If all the text in a cell won’t fit on a single line and the Wrap Text check
box is selected, the text is split into as many lines as necessary, given
the width of the cell. The line breaks come at spaces, dashes, and car-
riage returns. Deselecting the Wrap Text option may increase the width
of your table.
13. If you’ve selected the entire table, leave the Header Row check box
alone.
If you’ve selected a row, you can make it a header row by selecting the
Header Row check box, or you can remove its header row formatting by
deselecting the Header Row check box.
14. Decide how you want to determine row heights:
• If you want them determined by the content in the rows (each row is
only as large as the biggest cell in that row), select the Fit to
Contents radio button next to the Row Height section.
• If you want them set in pixels, select the radio button below the Fit to
Contents radio button and enter a number for the height you want
the row to be in pixels.
15. When you’ve made all the changes you want, click OK.
At any time while you are changing settings, you can click the Apply
button to see the effect before moving on to the next property.
Changing rows, columns, or individual cells
using the Tabl Properties dialog box
There may be times when you want to change the text alignment in some
cells but not others, or you want to perform some other task that applies
only to a particular row or column. In those circumstances, you need to
select only the cells you want to affect; then you can make the changes using
the Table Properties dialog box.
Selecting a row
To select a row, place your cursor on the table border at the left of the row
you want to select and click when the cursor becomes a bold right-pointing
arrow, as shown on the top in Figure 2-11. The row will highlight.

Selecting a column
To select a column, place your cursor on the table border at the top of the
column you want to select and click when the cursor becomes a bold down-
pointing arrow, a shown in the middle in Figure 2-11. The column will highlight.
Selecting an individual cell or group of cells
To select an individual cell, triple-click the cell. The cell is highlighted. To
select multiple cells, click in one cell, hold the Shift key, and triple-click in
another cell. The two cells you clicked in and every cell between them are
highlighted.
After you’ve made your selection, click the Table button to open the Table
Properties dialog box and make the changes just as outlined in the
“Changing the whole table using the Table Properties dialog box” section,
earlier in this chapter. If you have selected a row, the Rows and Columns tab
says only Row, and if you have selected a column, the Rows and Columns tab
reflects that by saying only Column.
Adding Images, Links, and More
Adding images to a page is a snap with Contribute. In a way, it’s easier
than adding a table, because images have fewer properties to set. Same
goes for adding Flash movies to a page.

Inserting an image
If the image you want to insert in your page is on your computer’s hard
drive, just follow these steps to insert it:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
image.
The cursor blinks where the top-left corner of your image will appear
on the page. You can insert an image in a table cell or anywhere else on
the page.
2. Choose Insert➪Image➪From My Computer or press Ctrl+Alt+I.
The Select Image dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder the image is in and then either double-click the
image’s filename or click the filename and click Select.
The image is placed in your draft. When you publish the page,
Contribute automatically uploads the image. Your site administrator can
set a maximum file size for any image uploaded to your site. If you get an
error message saying your image is too big, see your site administrator
or re-export the image from Fireworks at a smaller file size.
Inserting a Flash movie
Adding a Flash movie to your page from your computer’s hard drive is easy.
Just follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
Flash movie.
The cursor blinks where the top left of your movie will appear on the
page. You can insert a movie in a table cell or anywhere else on the page.
2. Choose Insert➪Flash➪From My Computer.
The Open dialog box appears.
3. Navigate to the folder the movie is in and then either double-click the
Flash movie’s filename or click the filename and click Open.
The Flash movie is placed in your draft. When you publish the page,
Contribute automatically uploads the .swf file.
Flash movies have parameters that can be set on a Web page — they affect
how the movies appear and function — but Contribute only gives you access
to a couple of them. To make these (limited) changes, select the movie by
clicking it and then choosing Format➪Flash Movie Properties to open the
Flash Movie Properties dialog box and set the Play on Page Load and Loop
properties.

Inserting a link
Links (short for hyperlinks) are what the Web is all about, so naturally
Contribute allows you to add links to your pages. You can link from both text
and images, and you can link to other pages on your site, other pages on the
Web, e-mail addresses, and things like PDF files.
Linking to a Web page
To add a link from text or an image to a page on your Web site or any other
Web site, just follow these steps:
1. Click an image or click and drag to select some text that you want to
link to another page on the Web.
The image or text highlights.
2. Choose Insert➪Link➪Browse to Web Page.
The Insert Link dialog box opens, with Browse selected at the top, as
shown in Figure 2-12. Alternatively, you can choose to link to a draft or
recently edited page.
3. Enter a URL (for example, www.MySite.com/contactus.htm) in the
Web Address text field, or click the Browse button to go to the page
you want to link to.
Browsing to the page is often the best way to ensure that you link to the
correct page. The page you browsed to appears in the Preview area on
the right.
4. Click OK.
You’ve just created a hyperlink.

Linking to an e-mail address
When you link to an e-mail address, the link on your Web page opens a new
e-mail message in your visitor’s e-mail program. The e-mail is automatically
addressed to the e-mail address you specify in the link.
To add an e-mail link to some text or to an image:
1. Click and drag to select text or click an image that you want to link to
an e-mail address.
The image or text highlights.
2. Choose Insert➪Link➪E-mail Address.
The Insert Link dialog box opens, with E-mail selected at the top.
3. Enter the text that will link to the e-mail address in the Link Text text
field.
4. Enter the e-mail address in the E-mail Address text field.
5. Click OK.
The selected text or image links to the e-mail address.
Linking to an e-mail address opens the visitor’s e-mail program only if his or
her program is set up to open when such a link is clicked. Most current
e-mail programs are set up by default to handle an e-mail link.
You can also link to other drafts, to new pages, and to files on your computer
(such as Word documents and PDF files). See Contribute’s Help files for
details on how to perform those tasks, or check out Adobe Contribute For
Dummies, by Janine Warner and Frank Vera (published by Wiley), which has
many details that we can’t fit into this minibook.
Inserting a document as PDF
Starting with Contribute 2, users were able to convert Office documents into
compact Flash movies that could be displayed in a Web page and viewed by
anyone with the Flash plug-in in his or her browser. Called FlashPaper, this
functionality basically competed with Adobe’s PDF format. With the merger
between Adobe and Macromedia, FlashPaper has been put out to pasture
and replaced throughout the entire old Macromedia product line with
Adobe’s PDF. Nowhere is this more noticeable than in Contribute.
To insert a PDF document into your page, just follow these steps:
1. Place your cursor in the draft and click where you want to add the
document.
The cursor blinks where the top left of your image will appear on the
page. You can insert an image in a table cell or anywhere else on the page.

your draft page.
You can also select the Remember This Setting and Don’t Ask Again
check box to avoid seeing the dialog box on subsequent inserts.
5. Click OK to insert the document or link.
Previewing Your Work
If you make minor text changes to a page, you may not need to see the
pagein a browser such as Internet Explorer or Opera before you put it on
your Web site for the whole world to see. But if you make extensive changes,
or if you’ve created a new page, you may want to check out how it looks in
your regular Web browser before you publish it to your site.
To preview a draft in your regular Web browser, choose File➪Preview or
press F12. Your regular Web browser (such as Internet Explorer) opens and
displays the page you’re editing.
Uploading (Publishing) a Page
When you’ve finished editing a page or creating a new one, you’ll want to put
it on your Web site where people can browse to it — that is, if you don’t
want to preview the page (see the preceding section, “Previewing Your
Work”) and you don’t need approval to post the page (see “Collaborating,”

later in this chapter). In Contribute, uploading the page to your Web server,
where it can be seen by any visitor who goes to the right URL, is known as
publishing a draft.
Publishing a draft is incredibly simple: Just click the Publish button at the
top left of Contribute’s Browser. The page and any images or Flash movies
you’ve added to it are uploaded to the server, and Contribute’s Browser
automatically switches to Browse mode to display the uploaded page as it
will appear to visitors to your site.
Working Offline
Unless you tell it otherwise, Contribute maintains an open connection to the
server that hosts your Web site. If you prefer not to have a connection open
the whole time you’re working, you have the option to work offline. Simply
choose File➪Work Offline (Contribute➪Work Offline on a Mac). The
Contribute Browser shows that you are working offline.
When you create a new page offline, the Work Online button instead of the
Publish button appears, as shown in Figure 2-14. To reconnect to your site,
simply click the Work Online button.

Collaborating
Contribute has several features that make collaborating on a site easy. For
example, when you edit a page, Contribute prevents anyone else from edit-
ing the page at the same time. That way, you never accidentally overwrite
someone else’s changes — and nobody overwrites yours!
If you need approval before you publish a draft, you have two methods for
submitting the draft to a colleague:
✦Email Review: Contribute uploads a copy of your draft to a hidden part
of your Web site, and you send an e-mail to your colleague with a link to
the hidden page. When you get approval, you publish the page.
✦Send Draft for Review: Contribute makes the hidden page available to
your colleagues so that they can review and publish it.
To make a preview of your draft and send an e-mail to a colleague with a link
to the preview, just follow these steps:
1. While you’re in Edit mode on the page you want to show to your col-
league, click the Send for Review button in the Browser.
The Send for Review window appears.
2. Select Send E-mail with a Link to a Preview of the Draft.
3. Click the Send button.
An e-mail appears with a message to the person you’re asking to review
your work.
4. Edit the e-mail if necessary and then send it.
5. If you think you may have to wait awhile for approval, save the draft
by clicking the Save for Later button at the top of the Browser.
The draft appears in the Pages panel.
6. When you have approval, click the draft’s name in the Pages panel.
The Browser switches to Edit mode and loads the draft in the Browser.
7. Click Publish.
The Browser switches to Browse mode and displays the published page
as it appears on your Web site.

The Send for Review window appears.
2. Select Send the Draft to Another Contribute User.
A list of users and groups becomes available.
3. Click to select a recipient or multiple recipients.
Press the Shift key to make multiple, contiguous selections from the list;
press the Ctrl key and click to make multiple, noncontiguous selections.
4. If the page is a new draft of an existing page, you can enter a descrip-
tion of the changes you’ve made.
This step is optional.
5. If you want to send an e-mail notifying your colleagues of your
request, leave the Notify Recipients Through E-mail option selected
and proceed to Step 6.
Otherwise, deselect the box and click Send. Depending on your setup,
the Send New Page or Send Linked New Files dialog box may appear. You
can rename your draft and navigate to a directory to copy the draft into.
A window appears to confirm that your draft has been sent for review
(unless you have previously selected the Don’t Show Me This Message
Again check box).
6. Edit the e-mail if necessary and send it.
The e-mail opens in your default e-mail program. After you send it,
Contribute updates to show the latest draft in the Draft Console. If you
want to cancel the review request, click the Undo Send button.

f you’re set up in the role of Contribute CS3 site administrator, you can do
everything a regular user can do — edit existing pages and make new
ones — but you also control who the regular users are, what access they
have to a site, and more.
A site may have multiple administrators as well as multiple users. All admin-
istrators have the same privileges, including the privilege to set up groups
of users in roles with distinct privileges. If reading that last sentence makes
you feel as though you’ve just stumbled into a hall of mirrors, don’t worry.
Read on, and you’ll be a site administrator in no time.
Setting Yourself Up as Site Administrator
You can set yourself up as an administrator, or you can set someone else up
as an administrator. But first things first: If you want to make site adminis-
trators of your colleagues, you have to make yourself a site administrator
beforehand. By the way, if you want to be an administrator on a site that
already has one, you need that site’s administrator to set you up in a role
with administrator privileges.
Though you may be able to set yourself up as a site administrator at any time
by editing your settings, we assume for the purposes of this book that you are
setting yourself up as an administrator at the same time you are making your
first connection to the site in Contribute, and that nobody else has yet done
so. To set yourself up as an administrator, just follow these steps:

Setting Yourself Up as Site Administrator
758
1. Browse to the site via Contribute’s Browser by typing or pasting a URL
(for example, www.MySite.com) into the Address text field.
2. Press Enter or click the Go button.
The Contribute Browser takes you right to your site.
You can use Contribute’s Browser to view any site on the Web, but you
can set up a connection to a site only if you have File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) information for that site.
3. Click the Create Connection button at the top left of the Browser, as
shown in Figure 3-1.
The Connection Wizard opens to its Welcome screen.
4. We’re assuming you don’t have a connection key, so click the
Continue button at the bottom of the wizard.
The Website Home Page screen appears. For more information about
connection keys, see the “Creating Connection Keys to Provide Access
to Contributors” section, later in this chapter.
5. If necessary, enter the URL (www.MySite.com, for example) for the
Web site you’ll be editing by typing or pasting it into the text field.
Click Continue.
The URL should be there already because you browsed to the site to
start the connection process. When you click Continue, the Connection
Information screen appears in the wizard.

6. Select a connection method from the drop-down list.
You have the following options: FTP, Secure FTP (SFTP), and
Local/Network. Depending on what you choose, different text fields
appear below the drop-down list. As you can see in Figure 3-2, we
entered FTP.
7a. If you selected FTP or SFTP, enter the FTP server name (such as
ftp.graspmagazine.com), login, and password in the respective
text fields. Click Continue.
The login is sometimes called the username. When you click Continue,
Contribute tests the connection and then the User Information screen
appears.
7b. If you selected Local/Network, enter the network path (for example,
\\mynetwork\mydepartment\site) by typing it, pasting it, or click-
ing the Choose Folder button and going to the folder that contains
your site. Click Continue.
When you click Continue, Contribute tests the connection and then the
User Information screen appears.
7c. If you selected WebDAV, enter the URL, username, and password that
you use to connect to the site under WebDAV.
When you click Continue, Contribute tests the connection and then the
User Information screen appears.
8. Enter your name in the What Is Your Full Name? text field.
Your name may already appear. The name in this field identifies you to
other contributors to your site, if there are any.

11. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer. (On the Mac, this option can be
found in the Contribute menu.)
Contribute connects to the site, and a Contribute window opens.
12. Select either Standard Word Processing or Dreamweaver-style editing.
These options affect the code that Contribute writes, but they do not
affect the Contribute user’s editing experience.
13. Click the Yes button, indicating you would like to become the site’s
Contribute administrator.
The Administer Website window opens to the Users and Roles screen,
with Administrator selected by default; see Figure 3-3. Your name may
appear under Administrator.
14. Click Administration in the list on the left.
The Administration screen appears on the right.
15. Enter a contact e-mail address as needed.
The contact e-mail address appears when Contribute throws a Contact
Your Administrator error message to a user.
16. Click the Set Administrator Password button.
The Change Administrator Password window appears.
17. Enter a password in the top text field of the Change Administrator
Password window.
18. Re-enter the password in the text field below, exactly as you typed it
in Step 17. Click OK.
You can use any combination of numbers and letters for your password.
The password is case sensitive (so as far as the password is concerned, a
big S and a small s are different characters). Only contributors who
know that password can perform administrator functions on the site.
When you click OK, the window closes.
You are now the site administrator. You can click the Close button or set
options for users on the other screens of the Administer Website window. To
find out about those other screens, read on.

Setting up Contribute Publishing Services (CPS)
Contribute Publishing Services (CPS) is a scalable, extensible server applica-
tion that can add administrative capabilities to Contribute while integrating
with your existing Active Directory or LDAP setup. CPS logs all publishing
activities on Web sites and offers administrators centralized control over
user access. If you’re having trouble understanding the terminology in this
paragraph, ask for help from your IT director.
You must install and configure CPS before you can enable it from the
Administer Website dialog box. For information on installing and configuring
CPS, see your documentation.
To enable CPS, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Websites➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the name of the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click Publishing Server in the list on the left.
The Publishing Services screen appears on the right.
4. Click the Enable Publishing Services button.
The Enable Publishing Services dialog box appears.

ability to authenticate users and manage the Web site connection.
7. Click OK.
The Enable Publishing Services window closes.
8. Perform further administrator tasks or click Close to save your set-
tings and close the Administer Website dialog box.
Establishing Web server settings
In some cases, the way your Web server is configured to retrieve index pages
may require you to adjust some settings in Contribute to get your connec-
tions between Contribute and the server working properly. The Web Server
pages in the Administer Website dialog box offer you the ability to customize
index pages and URL mapping, and to change from the default guard page
(a hidden file that Contribute uses to control access to drafts and adminis-
trative files).

Mapping to alternate Web site addresses
If you have multiple domain name system (DNS) entries pointing toward a
single Internet protocol (IP) address — that is, if www.graspmagazine.com
and grasp-magazine.com both point to the same Web server — or if your
contributors access your Web server using different addresses — from the
Web and from your internal network, for example — you need to set up
Contribute to recognize the additional addresses. Luckily, doing so is simple.
To map Contribute to an alternate Web site address, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click Web Server in the list on the left.
The Web Server screen appears on the right, open to the Web
Addresses tab.
4. Click the Add button.
The Add or Edit Alternate Address dialog box appears.
5. Enter the URL(s) in the Alternate Addresses text field.
6. Click OK.
The Add or Edit Alternate Address dialog box disappears and the addi-
tional address appears highlighted at the bottom of the list.
7. Make any other changes to the Web server settings, if necessary, and
click Close.
This step saves your settings and closes the Administer Website
dialog box.
To edit or delete an alternate Web site address, do the following:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the previous list to open to the Web
Addresses tab of the Web Server screen of the Administer Website
dialog box.
2. Click the address you want to edit or delete.
The address is highlighted. Now you can perform one of the following
actions:
• To edit the address, click the Edit button. The Add or Edit Alternate
Address dialog box appears, with the address highlighted. Edit the
URL in the Alternate Website Address text field and click OK to close
the Add or Edit Alternate Address dialog box.
• To delete the address, click the Remove button. The address disap-
pears from the dialog box.

This step saves your settings and closes the Administer Website

Mapping to index files
Assume that your server is configured to default to home pages in a nonstan-
dard way. For example, the server first checks a directory for start.php
and then looks for index.htm if it doesn’t find start.php. You can set up
Contribute to mirror that configuration.
Contribute has 30 possible index page filenames listed (index and default,
for each of 15 extensions). If your server is configured to look for a page with
a different filename (such as start.php or main.html), you need to add
that filename to the list.
To add a filename to the list, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click Web Server in the list on the left.
The Web Server screen appears on the right, open to the Web
Addresses tab.
4. Click the Index Files tab.
The Index Files page appears.
5. Click the Add button.
The Add or Edit Index Filename dialog box appears.
6. Enter the filename in the Index Filename text field.
7. Click OK.
The Add or Edit Index Filename dialog box disappears and the new file-
name appears at the bottom of the list in the Index and URL Mapping
dialog box.
8. Use the arrow buttons on the right to move the new filename to the
spot in the list that reflects the order the server uses.
For example, if the server checks index.htm first, that filename should
be at the top of the list (as it appears in Figure 3-5). Each time you click
the up-arrow button, the selected name moves up one spot in the list.

To edit or remove a filename from the list, just follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 4 in the previous list to open the Index Files
tab of the Web Server pages of the Administer Website dialog box.
2. Click the filename you want to edit or remove.
The filename is highlighted.
• To edit the filename, click the Edit button. The Add or Edit Index
Filename dialog box appears, with the current filename highlighted.
Type a new filename and click OK. The Add or Edit Index Filename
dialog box closes and the edited filename appears in the list.
• To remove the filename from the list, click the Remove button. The
filename disappears from the list.

prior state of things is sometimes the best way out of a jam. To make it
possible to roll back, Contribute keeps backup copies of edited pages on the
Web server. Administrators can specify how many versions Contribute backs
up. Administrators can also disable the Rollback feature.
The main advantage to the Rollback feature is pretty obvious: Backups can
help you recover quickly if a newly published version of a page has multiple
errors. Rather than having to scramble to fix the errors while the world sees
your faulty page, you can just roll back almost instantaneously to the previ-
ously published version of the page. It’s less likely you’ll end up in a Rollback
scenario if your draft has gone through the review process.
The major disadvantage of the Rollback feature, particularly for large sites,
is that backups take up space on the Web server. If you have Contribute set
to save three versions of each page, for example, by the time your colleagues
have published changes to 100 pages, 300 backup pages have been created
and stored in the _baks directory that Contribute has placed on the Web
server that contains your site.
To activate and customize the Rollback feature, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click Rollbacks in the list on the left.
The Rollbacks screen appears on the right.
4. Select the Enable Rollbacks check box.
A check appears in the check box and the text field below is no longer
grayed out.
5. Use the toggle buttons at the right of the text field to increase the
number of backups from 0, or double-click the 0 and enter a whole
number between 1 and 99.
Though you may elect to keep up to 99 versions of each page, you’re
probably better off limiting the number to 2 or 3 to conserve space on
your Web server.
6. Make any other changes and click Close.
This step saves your changes and closes the Administer Website
dialog box.

Creating General Settings
768
To disable rollbacks, follow Steps 1 through 3, deselect the Enable Rollbacks
check box, and click Close. Disabling rollbacks does not remove existing
backups. To remove existing backups, disable rollbacks and then use
Dreamweaver or your favorite FTP client to delete the files. Do not delete the
_baks folder because doing so can affect the way the program works.
Setting New Pages defaults
You can use the New Pages screen of the Administer Website dialog box to
set the default encoding and file extension for any new page generated by a
user. To set New Pages defaults, just follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears.
3. Click New Pages in the list on the left.
The New Pages options appear on the right.
4. Select a Default encoding from the drop-down list.
5. Enter a file extension in the Default File Extension text field.
6. Make any other changes and click Close.
This step saves your changes and closes the Administer Website
dialog box.
Deleting all permissions and settings at one time
The Administration page of the Administer Website dialog box includes a
button that allows you to delete all your custom sitewide settings and roles
with a single click. You might find it efficient to delete all the settings at one
time if your company or your Web site has just gone through a massive
reorganization.
If you click this button, you nullify all restrictions you may have placed on
any of your contributors. This means that all contributors have standard
user access to all files on your site. It also means that if you have an elabo-
rate array of restrictions and roles and you change your mind the next day,
you have to re-create all those settings from scratch.
To delete all your sitewide settings and roles, simply click the Remove
Administration button in the Administration page of the Administer Website
dialog box. A Warning dialog box appears to give you a chance to back out. If
you’re sure that you want to delete the settings, click Yes. Then click Close in
the Administer Website dialog box.

Setting Up Users and Roles
After you have designated yourself as an administrator, you have access to
the Administer Website dialog box, in which you can do things such as con-
figure general settings, send connection keys, and more.
When you set up a connection, Contribute automatically creates three
default roles for contributors: Administrators, Publishers, and Writers. By
default, users in all three roles may edit and create new pages, but only
administrators and publishers can publish pages. You can set up as many
additional roles as you like; each role might have different new page-creation
permissions or access to different directories on the site, or other settings
and permissions.
Opening the Administer Website dialog box
To open the Administer Website dialog box for a site to which you have
administrator access, simply do the following:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter if prompted.
The Administer Website dialog box appears, open conveniently to the
Users and Roles screen.
Setting up a new role
If you don’t need more than one set of users and one set of administrators,
you can skip this section.
If you’re creating a new role whose settings largely overlap with those of an
existing role’s, you can duplicate the existing role and then edit the dupli-
cated role’s settings as necessary. In fact, in Contribute CS3, all new roles
must be created this way. To create a new role by duplicating an existing
role, just follow these steps:
1. Open the Administer Website dialog box by following the steps
described in the earlier section, “Opening the Administer Website
dialog box.”
2. Click the Create New Role button in the Users and Roles page of the
Administer Website dialog box.
The Create New Role dialog box appears.
3. Select an existing role from the list at the top.

4. Enter a name for the new role in the Name of New Role field and click
OK or press Enter.
The Create New Role dialog box closes. The new role’s name is high-
lighted in the Administer Website dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-6,
where we added a role called “Editor.” If you want to edit that role’s set-
tings, just click the Edit Role Settings button. The “Editing Role Settings”
section, later in this chapter, details the settings you can make.
Deleting roles
Deleting a role is easy. Simply follow these steps:
1. Open the Administer Website dialog box by following the steps
described in the earlier section, “Opening the Administer Website
dialog box.”
2. In the Users and Roles page of the Administer Website dialog box,
click the name of the role you want to delete.
The role name is highlighted.
3. Click the Remove button.
A dialog box pops up, warning you that you are about to remove a role.
4. Click Yes to remove the role.
The Warning dialog box closes and the role’s name disappears from the
Administer Website dialog box.

Editing Role Settings
After you’ve created a role (or decided to go with the default Administrators,
Publishers, and Writers), you can adjust the permissions granted to the
users who perform that role. Permissions may be wholesale (contributors in
the Writers role may upload any images) or conditional (Writers may upload
images, but only if the images’ file sizes are smaller than 32 kilobytes, for
example).
In contrast to general settings, role settings apply only to individual roles,
not to all roles. Each role may have its own permissions or settings in the
following areas:
✦General
✦Folder/File Access
✦Editing
✦Styles and Fonts
✦New Pages
✦File Placement
✦Shared Assets
✦New Images
We discuss each of the areas in detail in the following subsections.
Making general settings
When you open the Role Settings dialog box, you see the General screen by
default. The General options allow you to make three types of settings for
a role:
✦Publish Permission: Give or deny users in the role permission to pub-
lish pages to the Web site.
✦Role Description: A sentence or two that describes the role. The Role
Description is what people see when they click the role name in the
Connection Wizard.
✦Role Home Page: The page that loads when users assigned to the role
connect to the Web site in Contribute.

Editing Role Settings
772
To create general settings for a role, follow these simple steps:
1. Click to select the role for which you want to edit settings.
The role is highlighted.
2. Click the Edit Role Settings button.
The Edit Role Settings dialog box appears, with the name of the role and
Web site in the title bar.
3. Select the Allow Users to Publish Files check box if you wish people in
the selected role to be able to publish files to the Web site.
If no mark is in the check box, users in the selected role will have to
send drafts to someone with publishing permission.
4. Enter a role description by typing or pasting it into the Role
Description text field.
Note that if you have selected the Allow Users to Publish Files check
box, you’ll probably want to change the default role description.
5. Click and drag to select the current role home page and enter a new
URL by typing or pasting it into the Home Page for Users in This Role
text field.
Alternatively, you can click the Choose button at the right and navigate
to the page in the Choose File on Website dialog box.
One advantage of navigating via the Choose File on Website dialog box is
that you avoid the possibility of misspelling the URL.
6. Make other changes to the role’s permissions as needed and click OK.
If your Web site has several directories, each of which is maintained by a dif-
ferent department, you can make a role for each department and set a
default home page for each role. For example, senior members of the
Editorial Department, who are responsible only for all Web site content,
might have www.graspmagazine.com /edit/index.php as their home
page. Figure 3-7 shows the local network version of that same page.
Granting access to folders and files
You may wish to restrict certain groups of contributors from editing particu-
lar files on your site. For example, you may want the members of your
Marketing Department to be able to update the News section of your site but
not have access to the Products section. Contribute allows you to specify
which folders (directories) a user in a particular role may access to edit the
files within. (See Figure 3-8.)

6. Click the Add Folder button.
The Choose Folder dialog box appears, with your site’s directory struc-
ture represented on the left.
7. Double-click the folder you want the role to be able to edit, and then
click Select Folder Name, where Folder Name is the name of the folder.
The Choose Folder dialog box disappears and the URL for the folder you
selected appears in the Folder Access text field (refer to Figure 3-8).
8. Make other changes to the role’s permissions as needed; then, click OK.
Extending file deletion privileges
The Folder/File Access screen in the Role Settings dialog box also allows you
to choose whether a role is permitted to delete files from the site. Users in a
given role can delete only files that they have permission to edit.
To allow users to delete files from a site, follow these simple steps:
1. In the Folder/File Access screen, select the Allow Users to Delete Files
They Have Permission to Edit check box at the top of the File Deletion
section of the dialog box.
The Remove Rollback Versions on Delete check box becomes available.
2. (Optional) If you want rollback files for a page to be deleted when
that page is deleted, select the Remove Rollback Versions on Delete
check box.
3. Make other changes to the role’s permissions as needed; then, click OK.
Customizing editing settings
The Editing options (shown in Figure 3-9) in the Edit Role Settings dialog box
allow you to set what aspects of a page’s underlying HTML code a role can
edit. The Edit Role Settings dialog box also allows you to specify how
Contribute writes some basic HTML formatting code.

Book VI
Chapter 3
Contribute CS3

Setting general editing restrictions
Dreamweaver templates “lock” certain chunks of code so that people editing
pages based on those templates cannot change certain aspects of the way
the page is built. This preserves the structure and look of the page. (For
details on creating Dreamweaver templates, see Book II, Chapter 6.)
If you’re not using Dreamweaver templates but you still want to protect any
specialized code (ColdFusion markup, for example) from being edited, make
sure that the Protect Scripts and Forms check box in the General Editing
Restrictions section is selected. (The Allow Unrestricted Editing option is
selected by default; if you want to allow everything on the page to be edited
except scripts and forms, the Allow Unrestricted Editing option must be
selected before the Protect Scripts and Forms check box can be selected.)
If you want users in the selected role to be unable to insert images or edit
them using Contribute’s new inline image-editing capabilities, select the
Prevent Users from Inserting Images check box.
If you want users in a role to be able to edit and format text only, select the
Only Allow Text Editing and Formatting option.
Setting the Paragraph Spacing option
When you’re writing text in a regular word-processing program (such as
Microsoft Word) and you press the Enter key on your keyboard, your cursor
goes to the next line, just as a carriage return works on a typewriter. When
you press Enter to go to a new line in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You

Get) HTML editor such as Dreamweaver, a blank line is inserted between the
previous line you were on and the new line. You can set up Contribute to
function either like a word processor or like Dreamweaver when a contribu-
tor presses the Enter key.
It’s not just Contribute’s behavior that changes when you change this set-
ting, it’s also the underlying HTML code that Contribute generates. When
you select the One Line option in the Paragraph Spacing section, Contribute
generates an inline CSS style to create the line break. When you select the
Two Lines option, Contribute uses the standard HTML paragraph tag <P> to
create the line break.
To set up Contribute to start a new line of text directly under the old one
when a contributor presses the Enter key, select the One Line, As in
Standard Word Processors (Uses Inline CSS Styles) option.
To set Contribute to start a new line of text two lines down from the old line,
leaving a space in between, select the Two Lines, As in Web Page Editors
(Uses Standard <P> Tags) option.
Setting other editing options
In the Other Editing Options section of the Editing screen, the Use <STRONG>
and <EM> in Place of <B> and <I> option is selected by default. Leave it as is
if you want Contribute to use the latest HTML tags for bold and italicized text.
Select the Allow Users to Insert Third-party Objects option if you want users
in the selected role to be able to insert Google and PayPal extensions into
pages.
Select the Allow Multiple Consecutive Spaces (Uses &nbsp;) option to enable
contributors to create horizontal space in a page by inserting multiple spaces.
Select the Require ALT Text for Images option if you want Contribute to
prompt contributors to include information that makes the page more acces-
sible to visitors who are visually impaired.
To choose a line break type for the underlying code (not the text as it
appears in a browser), select from the Line Break Type drop-down list. In
most cases, you may leave this at its default setting; if the people working
directly on the HTML use a particular type of computer, you may wish to
select the line break type accordingly. CR stands for Carriage Return, and LF
is short for Line Feed. Contribute offers the following line break types:
✦Windows (CR LF)
✦Macintosh (CR)
✦UNIX (LF)

Granting styles and fonts permissions
To change the permissions for a role’s ability to format text on Web pages,
click Styles and Fonts in the list on the left side of the Role Settings dialog
box; see Figure 3-10. Formatting text is usually one of the main responsibili-
ties of anybody maintaining a Web site. Contribute makes formatting text
easy as it is; setting styles and fonts permissions can make formatting text
even easier for contributors by taking away options that might lead to incor-
rect formatting.
Setting styles options
By default, contributors are permitted to apply CSS styles and HTML para-
graph and heading styles to text on pages they have permission to edit. The
Style Support drop-down menu allows you to prevent users from applying any
styles to the text by selecting the Don’t Allow Users to Create Styles option. If
you select that option, the rest of the Styles and Fonts options disappear.
If you don’t want contributors to be able to apply CSS styles but you do want
them to be able to apply styles to <P> tags and to insert header tags (<H1>,
<H2>, and so on), deselect the Include CSS Styles in the Style Menu check
box, but leave the other two check boxes selected.
If, on the other hand, you have set up a thorough CSS style sheet and don’t
want contributors using generic HTML paragraph and heading styles to
format text, deselect the Include HTML Heading Styles (<H1>, . . .) in the
Style Menu check box, but leave the other two check boxes selected.

Note that with Contribute CS3, you can limit the styles that appear in the
Contribute Browser’s toolbar to those that appear on a specific stylesheet.
Simply select the Show Only CSS Styles Included in This CSS File option and
input the pathname or URL of the style sheet, or click the Choose button and
browse to the style sheet.
Setting fonts options
When the Allow Users to Apply Fonts and Sizes (Displays the Font and Size
Menus) check box is selected, as it is by default, contributors can format
text by choosing a font face and size from drop-down lists on the Contribute
Browser’s toolbar.
If you’re using a CSS style sheet that includes font face, size, color, and other
attributes for all text on your site, deselect the Allow Users to Apply Fonts
and Sizes check box and make sure that the Include CSS Styles in the Style
Menu check box is selected.
If you want to allow contributors to apply text formatting, and you want
Contribute to generate basic HTML <FONT> tags, just follow these steps.
This assumes you have the Styles and Fonts options of the Edit Role Settings
dialog box showing.
1. Select HTML Tags from the Style Support drop-down menu.
2. Select the Allow Users to Apply Fonts and Sizes (Displays the Fonts
and Size Menus) check box, if it isn’t already selected.
This box is selected by default.
3. Select the Include HTML Heading Styles option.
4. Edit the settings as necessary.
By default, users are permitted to apply fonts and sizes, bold, italics,
underline, strikethrough, and fixed-width styles, and to edit font and
background colors.
5. Make other changes to the role’s permissions as needed, then click OK.
If you want to allow contributors to apply text formatting, but you want
Contribute to generate CSS-style code instead of HTML <FONT> tags, just
follow these steps. We assume that you have the Styles and Fonts options of

Granting permission to create new pages
Chances are, your contributors are going to need to create new pages for
your Web site. If your company paid good money to have the site profession-
ally designed, however, you probably don’t want the people maintaining
your site to fashion pages that diverge from the approved design.
Contribute gives administrators a way to force contributors to use
Dreamweaver templates (the safest bet) or to use existing pages to create
new ones. That helps keep the site design uniform and saves time for the
people maintaining the site, as well.
To control the types of Web pages contributors can create, just follow these
steps:
1. If you have the Edit Role Settings dialog box open already, skip to
Step 5. Otherwise, continue with Step 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site

Working with shared assets
Shared assets are things such as Dreamweaver library items, Flash movies,
and images that you want available for users to place easily in Web pages.
Adding a shared asset
To add a shared asset, follow these steps:
1. If you have the Edit Role Settings dialog box open already, skip to
Step 5. Otherwise, continue with Step 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
If the Administrator Password dialog box appears, go to Step 3.
Otherwise, when the Administer Website dialog box appears, open to
the Users and Roles screen, skip to Step 4.
3. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears, open conveniently to the
Users and Roles screen.
4. Click the role for which you want to edit settings.
5. Click the Edit Role Settings button.
The Edit Role Settings dialog box appears, with the name of the role and
Web site in the title bar.

6. Select Shared Assets in the list on the left.
The Shared Assets options appear on the right, as shown in Figure 3-13.
7. Click Add and select an asset type from the pop-up menu.
The choices are Image, Library Item, and Flash. The Choose window
appears.
8. Navigate to the asset you want to share.
Shift+click to select multiple contiguous items; Ctrl+Click to select multi-
ple noncontiguous items. You can also click the Select All Files in Folder
button if you want to share all the items. If the Shared Asset Properties
dialog box appears, see the instructions in the upcoming “Editing a
shared asset” section for details on options.
9. Click OK.
The Choose window disappears and a dialog box informs you that you
have the option to prevent users from editing the asset.
10. Click OK to close the dialog box.
11. Make other changes to the role’s permissions as needed; then, click OK.
12. Click OK in the Administer Website dialog box to save the changes.
Editing a shared asset
You can edit the name of any shared asset, regardless of type. The asset
name is what shows up for the user when he chooses Insert➪Shared Asset.
By default, the asset name is the filename, minus the extension. For example,
Figure 3-13:
We’ve
limited the
writers to

Editing Role Settings
786
if the filename is di_113_small_2006.gif, it appears to the user as
di_113_small_2006. An asset name like that might not be helpful to the
user, so Contribute gives you the power to name the asset something more
user friendly, such as Logo - Small.
If the asset is an image, you can also input an Alt tag.
If the asset is a Dreamweaver library item, you can change the asset name
that appears to users and prevent users from editing the item. (By default,
the Lock Item on Page check box is unselected, so users can edit the library
item.)
To edit a shared asset, follow Steps 1 through 6 in the “Adding a shared
asset” section, earlier in this chapter, and then do the following:
1. Click to select an asset and then click the Edit button.
The Shared Asset Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure
3-14. If you have selected multiple items, the dialog box will appear
slightly different. The contents of the box will also be slightly different
depending on which type of asset you have selected.

Deleting a shared asset
To delete a shared asset, follow Steps 1 through 6 in the “Adding a shared
asset” section, earlier in the chapter, and then click an asset or assets and
click the Remove button. A warning dialog box appears, asking whether you’re
sure that you want to remove the asset. Click Yes. The dialog box closes. Then
you can make other changes in the Administer Website dialog box, or click OK
to save your changes and close the Administer Website dialog box.
Customizing options for adding new images
As an administrator, you can set a file size limit for images; Contribute won’t
allow a role to add an image with a file size greater than the maximum you
set. By default, there’s no limit. You can also set maximum image dimen-
sions. Note that these settings apply only to new images, not to shared
assets or images inserted from the Web site.
If you want to allow users to edit new images using the built-in Contribute
CS3 image-editing tools and to constrain the user’s image-editing options,
just follow these steps:
1. If you have the Edit Role Settings dialog box open already, skip to
Step 5. Otherwise, continue with Step 2.
2. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.

Creating Connection Keys to Provide
Access to Contributors
Connection keys are password-protected, encrypted text files that contain
the data Contribute needs to establish a connection with a Web site. When
you send a connection key to a user in a role, all the user must do to estab-
lish a connection is double-click the key and enter a password. That can be
pretty handy if you have several people in a group, since you can e-mail the
same key to all of them, or post the key on your internal network.
You don’t have to go to each member’s machine to set up the connection,
nor do you have to worry about providing tech support if you’ve decided to
let people establish their own connections. Best of all, connection keys are
specific to roles, so you don’t have to worry that a contributor will choose
to be in the wrong role.
To create a connection key, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Administer Website➪Name of Site, where Name of Site
is the site you want to administer.
If the Administrator Password dialog box appears, go to Step 2.
Otherwise, when the Administer Website dialog box appears, open to
the Users and Roles screen, skip to Step 3.
2. Enter your password and click OK or press Enter.
The Administer Website dialog box appears, open conveniently to the
Users and Roles screen.

not, skip to Step 4c.
4b. If you want to include FTP or SFTP login information in the connec-
tion key, select the Include My FTP Username and Password check

If your connection to the site is Local/Network, the box will be grayed
out. When you click Continue, the Role Information screen appears.
4c. If users in the role will be connecting to the site in a different way
than you do, select the No, I Would Like to Customize the Connection
Settings for Other Users option. Then click Continue and go to Step 5.
If users in the role will be connecting via the Web while you connect via
your network, customize the connection settings for the role. When you
click Continue, the Connection Information screen appears.
5. Enter the information and click Continue.
For information about the Connection Information screen, see the section
on connecting to a site with the Connection Wizard in Book VI, Chapter 2.
When you click Continue, the Role Information screen appears.
6. In the Select a Role area, click the name of the role that will use the
connection key you’re creating. Click Continue.

7. Answer the question How Would You Like to Export the Connection
Key File? by selecting either the Send in E-mail or the Save to Local
Machine option.
Adobe recommends that you not send the key via Web-based e-mail
(such as Hotmail or Yahoo!) because even though the key is encrypted,
it contains sensitive information that should never be sent via inherently
less-secure, Web-based e-mail.
8. In the top text field, enter a password that enables users in the role to
use the key. Press the Tab key or click in the bottom text field.
A contributor must have the password to use the key. The password
may contain spaces, numbers, and letters and be up to 30 characters
long; the password is case sensitive. If you send the key in an e-mail, it’s
safest not to include the password in the same e-mail. Instead, send the
password in a separate e-mail or, better yet, reveal the password ver-
bally to users in the role.
9. Re-enter the password exactly as you entered it in the text field in the
previous step and click Continue.
10. Carefully check the information on the Summary screen to make sure
that it’s correct.
• If it isn’t, use the Back button to go back and correct any information
on previous screens; then, click Continue to return to the Summary
screen.
• If the information is correct, click Done.
If you selected the Send in E-mail option, a new e-mail with the connection
key attached opens automatically in your e-mail program. Customize the
e-mail as necessary, add a recipient or recipients, and send the message. If
you selected the Save to Local Machine option, the Export Connection Key
dialog box opens. Navigate to the folder on the local machine or on your net-
work where you want to place the key and click Save.

 Discovering Acrobat and PDF files
 Knowing when to use PDF files
 Becoming familiar with the Acrobat workspace and tools
A
dobe Acrobat 8 provides a variety of tools for sharing and reviewing
documents. Although the Adobe Creative Suite applications can create
Portable Document Format (PDF) files without Acrobat, you can use Acrobat
to create PDF files from programs that aren’t part of the Creative Suite. You
can also use Adobe Acrobat to enhance PDF files, regardless of how they
were created. You can add security to restrict features such as printing or
editing, change the page order, merge documents together, add comments
and annotations, and even create PDF forms.
In this chapter, you find out why you may want to create PDF files and
acquaint yourself with the Adobe Acrobat tools and workspace. You’ll see
how easy it is to navigate through PDF files using the navigational tools, tabs,
and viewing options in Acrobat. In the following chapters of this minibook,
you explore how to use Acrobat to create Adobe PDF files from documents
produced in a variety of programs and discover ways to enhance your Adobe
PDF files.
Working with PDF Files
Adobe Acrobat is used to create Adobe PDF files, review existing PDF files,
and modify existing PDF files. When you work with programs in the Adobe
Creative Suite, such as Adobe InDesign, and you want to share your work
with colleagues or clients, you need to find a way to deliver the documents
to them. Of course, you can always print your documents and send them via
courier, the mail, or even fax. But all these methods take time and don’t pro-
vide for easy collaboration. This area is where PDF files are helpful.
Many people prefer to receive documents electronically, but there’s a small
problem: All the people with whom you need to share files probably don’t
have the same software you use. They may not all have InDesign — or what-
ever part of the Adobe Creative Suite you’re using. PDF provides a common
file format that everyone can open to review your documents. PDF provides

Working with PDF Files
796
an application independent method for viewing your files, regardless of what
computer program was used to create them. The PDF file format also lets
Mac users share their files with Windows users, and vice versa. Additionally,
Acrobat provides extensive tools for review, commenting, and marking up so
that you can easily collaborate on a project without modifying the original
document.
You can view PDF files on many different computer types, including
Macintosh computers, Windows computers, Unix computers, and even some
cell phones and handheld PDAs. Because the software to view Adobe PDF
files is free, you can be assured that those receiving your files don’t need to
purchase any special software. In fact, the odds are quite good that most
users already have this free software, called Adobe Reader, as more than 500
million copies have been distributed. Adobe has actually released the under-
pinnings of PDF to all computer software makers, allowing them to freely
create different programs to read and create PDF files.
What makes PDF so useful is that it provides a true reproduction of original
documents. The fidelity of PDF files is so good that the Internal Revenue
Service uses this format to distribute tax forms online. Likewise, many
banks, insurance agencies, and financial services firms use PDF as a method
for distributing documents. We even use PDF files to send books like the one
you’re reading now to the printing plant.
Although PDF files provide a high-quality representation of an original file,
they’re more than just a picture of the document from which they were cre-
ated. PDF files retain the high-quality appearance of text so that they print
clearly and are searchable. Logos and illustrations created using Adobe
Illustrator retain the same high-quality appearance within a PDF file. PDF
files also may contain the intricate details that are captured in bitmap
images, such as those edited using Adobe Photoshop — but PDF files are
able to keep both bitmap and vector information together in the same file,
making them a great choice for distributing documents electronically. You
don’t have to sacrifice quality to distribute a file electronically. You do need
to know a few things about Acrobat to create the right type of PDF files for
your needs, though. The PDF file you’d send to a printer may be too big for
anyone to post on a Web site or send as an e-mail attachment, for example.
One new feature in Acrobat 8 lets you create PDF packages. A PDF package
contains multiple PDF files and can also contain other file types that aren’t
PDF files. A PDF package may contain a few pages from a PowerPoint presen-
tation, part of a spreadsheet, a CAD drawing, some text documents, perhaps
an e-mail or two, and so on. This great flexibility is a powerful enhancement
to Adobe Acrobat.
Adobe Acrobat is a tool for distributing documents; it’s not a design tool.
You generally don’t use Acrobat to build new documents, although Acrobat 8
does let you create a blank page and put text and objects on that page.

However, Acrobat is meant to be a medium for sharing files, not for creating
them. Simply put, you don’t use Acrobat to create new documents. But
Acrobat is still incredibly useful. Using Acrobat, you can
✦Share documents with users who don’t have the same software or fonts
that you use.
✦Review and mark up PDF files that others send you. You can also enable
a PDF file to be reviewed by users with the free Adobe Reader software.
✦Combine documents created in other programs. You can use Acrobat
to merge PDF files that may have been originally created in different
programs.
✦Create a PDF Package. You can combine various file formats into a single
PDF Package and yet retain the files in their original file formats.
✦Edit Adobe PDF files.
✦Apply security to PDF files when you don’t want them changed.
✦Add interactivity to PDF files by infusing them with sounds, movies, and
buttons.
✦Create interactive forms, where you can collect information without
requiring a user to print, write, and then fax or mail information back
to you.
We cover these capabilities throughout the rest of this minibook.
Knowing When to Use Adobe PDF Files
So when does it make sense to use Adobe PDF files? Here are some examples:
✦When you’ve created a spreadsheet that includes numbers, formulas,
and tables that you don’t want others to edit: Your recipients may have
the same software you used to build the document, but you can keep
them from editing the original spreadsheet file by distributing it as a
PDF file.
✦When you’ve created a presentation that you want others to deliver,
but you work on a PC and some of them use Macintosh systems: By
converting the document to PDF, you don’t have to worry about issues
that can arise when sharing files between different computer types. For
example, fonts are typically included within PDF documents and can be
used on any computer systems with the free Adobe Reader or the com-
plete Adobe Acrobat software.
In addition, by sending the presentation in PDF format rather than in the
original presentation file format, you don’t have to be concerned that
the recipients may edit the file.

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
798
✦When you have a sensitive document that will be shared only with
certain authorized colleagues: If you have a document containing
information that you don’t want unauthorized persons viewing, you
can add security to a PDF file by using Adobe Acrobat’s security tools.
Using these options, you can require users to enter a password to view
the file, and you can limit other features, such as the ability to print or
edit the document.
✦When you want to review a document quickly and efficiently: When
documents need to be reviewed or approved, Acrobat really shines. You
can use commenting, markup, and annotation tools to add suggestions
and edits to a file, regardless of where it was created. You can even com-
bine comments from multiple reviewers into a single document.
Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
To take advantage of all that Adobe Acrobat has to offer, you’ll want to dis-
cover the workspace and tools Acrobat uses. Adobe has significantly revised
the Acrobat 8 interface. Unlike previous versions of Acrobat, which opened
with a blank workspace, Acrobat 8 opens with a Getting Started screen. It
provides eight possible tasks: Create PDF, Combine Files, Export, Start
Meeting, Secure, Sign, Forms, and Review & Comment. These tasks are also
incorporated in Acrobat’s toolbar once you begin working with your docu-
ment. You can click a task in the Getting Started window, or if you just want
to review a file, you can close the Start Up window like you would any other
document window by clicking the Close Window button in the corner.
The Getting Started window appears each time you open Acrobat unless you
click the Do Not Show At Startup check box.
Once you open a document, you see the Acrobat workspace, which is
divided into three areas: the document window, the toolbar well, and the
navigation panes. When you open a PDF document using Acrobat, you can
use the toolbars, buttons, and navigation panes to work with and manipulate
the PDF file. For example, a PDF file may contain multiple pages. You can use
the navigational buttons or the Pages navigation panel to move between
pages and then use commenting tools to mark up the file.
The toolbar provides useful information for navigating through your docu-
ment, including:
✦Current page and total pages: Click in the area showing the current
page, type a different page number, and press Enter (Return on a Mac) to
view a specific page.
✦Previous Page/Next Page: Use these navigational buttons to skip for-
ward or backward by one page.

The Zoom tools
If things are a bit too small for you to see clearly, increase the magnification
used for viewing pages with the Zoom drop-down menu in the toolbar. Using
the toolbar, select from a preset magnification by choosing the drop-down list
showing magnification percentages. The preset magnification choices are
available to the right of the current magnification level, which is displayed in
the menu bar. You can use the minus (–) and plus (+) symbols to the left of the
current magnification level to zoom out or in from the current magnification.
The Marquee Zoom tool is the magnifying glass icon, and you can use it to
identify specific portions of a page that you want to magnify. Select this tool
and then click and drag around a portion of the page to increase the magnifi-
cation. You can also click multiple times on an area to increase its magnifica-
tion, but clicking and dragging a box with the Zoom In tool is generally a
much faster way to focus on a portion of a page you want to view. You can
change the Zoom In tool to the Zoom Out tool (magnifying glass with a minus
sign) by selecting the Marquee Zoom tool and Alt+clicking (Option+clicking
on a Mac) in the document window. The magnifier’s plus (+) sign changes to a
minus (-) to indicate that you’re decreasing the document’s magnification.
But it’s usually faster to choose a preset zoom percentage.
To the right of the magnification percentage box are page icons that you can
use to change the page magnification:
✦Scrolling Pages: Use this button to avoid scrolling from left to right
when reading a document. The view is changed to fit the document’s
width in the available space on your display, making it necessary to only
scroll up and down on a page. This also sets the page view to display the
top or bottom of adjacent pages. When you scroll and reach the bottom
of one page, the top of the next page becomes visible.
✦One Full Page: Use this button to fit the current page within the avail-
able screen space on your monitor. For smaller documents, such as a
business card, the magnification is increased. For larger documents, the
magnification is generally decreased unless you have a large monitor.
When viewing pages in the Fit Page mode, only one page is displayed at
a time. This mode is good for viewing the entire display of a page layout.
Toolbars
The toolbars in Acrobat 8 are now customizable, so you can combine func-
tions from different toolbars to meet your needs.
For example, Acrobat also includes several additional tools for navigation,
which are accessible by choosing View➪Toolbars➪More Tools. In the More
Tools window that appears, select the navigation tools you’d like to have dis-
played in the toolbar. The Selecting and Zoom Toolbar section displays the
navigation tool choices that can be displayed.

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
800
Less than half of the toolbars are visible in the default Acrobat display. You
can add to the tools that are displayed or limit them by clicking the check
box next to those you want to display or hide in the More Tools window.
Toolbars that have a check mark next to their names are visible, while those
without a check mark aren’t visible.
Customizing the location of toolbars on your screen can make it easier for
you to work with PDF files using Acrobat. For example, you may want all the
tools for navigating through your documents in one section of the toolbar
well. To achieve this, you can rearrange the location of specific toolbars.
Along the left edge of every group of tools is a dotted double line. By clicking
and holding onto this edge with your mouse, you can drag any toolbar to a
new location on your screen. This new location can be within the same area
holding the other toolbars, or anywhere in the Acrobat work area. If you pull
a toolbar out of the docking area, it becomes an independent, floating tool-
bar. You can reposition or drag floating toolbars back into the docking area
when you’re finished working with them. You can also close a floating tool-
bar by clicking its Close Window button. You can place toolbars along the
left or right of the Acrobat work area — turning either side of the Acrobat
workspace into a docking area for toolbars.
Although the flexibility of placing toolbars anywhere you like is useful, it may
lead to a chaotic work environment. Instead of leaving toolbars all over your
screen, you can have Acrobat clean up the workspace by choosing View➪
Toolbars➪Reset Toolbars.
Toolbars contain both tools and buttons. For example, you choose the
Marquee Zoom tool to change the magnification by clicking or selecting an
area of the page. Buttons perform an immediate task, such as printing, saving,
or applying security to a PDF document. In general, most of the task buttons
are on the top row of the docking area, immediately below the menu bar, and
most of the tools are on the bottom row — but you can move these toolbars.
Some tools and task buttons also include additional options that you can
access through drop-down lists within the toolbars. Tools and buttons that
contain additional choices are noted by the small triangle immediately to the
right of the icon. Click this small triangle, and you see a menu listing the
additional choices for that tool or button.
Viewing modes
Acrobat provides several viewing modes that control how the entire docu-
ment is displayed. You can choose which viewing mode is used by choosing
View➪Page Display and selecting the viewing option you want.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Discovering

Information

801
The viewing modes are
✦Single Page: This mode displays only the current document page on-
screen and does not show any adjoining pages. When you scroll to the
top or bottom of the current page, other pages aren’t visible at the same
time as the current page.
✦Single Page Continuous: With this mode, you can see the current docu-
ment page, and if you scroll to the top (or bottom) of the current page,
the adjoining page is also visible. If you reduce your page viewing magni-
fication, many document pages are visible.
✦Two-Up (previously known as Facing): Use this mode to see pages as a
spread, where you can view both the left and right side of adjoining
pages at the same time. When you have documents with pictures or text
that spans a pair of pages, use this option to see the pages presented
side-by-side in Acrobat. As with the Single Page mode, other pages that
go before or fall after the spread aren’t visible — only the one pair of
pages is visible on-screen, regardless of the magnification or scrolling.
✦Two-Up Continuous (previously known as Continuous-Facing): If you
have a document with many pages containing text or pictures on their
adjoining pages, you can use this mode to scroll from one pair of visible
pages to the next. When the Continuous-Facing view is selected, you can
see adjoining page spreads. This option is identical to the Facing option,
but it also shows pages above or below the spread you are presently
viewing.
If you have pages where images or text go across pages, the Two-Up 
choice is useful. By default, the pages generally display incorrectly. 
For example, a magazine will display the cover (page 1) and page 2 
together, instead of pages 2 and 3. To correct this, you need to choose
View➪Page Display➪Show Cover Page During Two-Up.
You can add viewing modes as menu buttons using the More Tools window,
described earlier in the Tools section.
Additional viewing options
Acrobat has two options for changing your document display.
✦Full Screen Mode (View➪Full Screen Mode): You can use the Full
Screen View option to hide all menus, toolbars, and other parts of the
Acrobat interface. This option is useful if you want to focus on the docu-
ment being displayed, not the program being used to view it. Use this
mode, for example, when you’ve a converted PowerPoint file to a PDF
document and want to deliver the presentation using Acrobat. If you’re
viewing a document in the Full Screen Mode, press the Esc key to return
to the regular viewing mode.

Introducing the Adobe Acrobat Workspace and Tools
802
You can set a document to automatically open in Full Screen Mode by
choosing File➪Properties and choosing this option from the Initial View
panel of the Document Properties window. Additionally, you can choose
Edit➪Preferences and select the Full Screen option along the top left side
of the Preferences window to control various aspects of the Full Screen
Mode. Some choices include the transition between pages and whether
pages advance automatically, allowing you to create a self-running PDF
presentation.
✦Reading Mode (View➪Reading Mode): With so many toolbars, they
sometimes get in the way. Reading Mode temporarily hides all your

Acrobat offers a variety of panels that are helpful when navigating through
PDF documents. The term panel may be a bit misleading because similar
options are called palettes or panes in the other Adobe Creative Suite pro-
grams. Regardless of the name, however, you use them to get around PDF
files more easily.
The navigation panels are visible along the left side of your document
window as small icons (refer to Figure 1-2). Click an icon to make its panel
visible. For example, click the Pages icon to display thumbnail-size represen-
tations of each page, as shown in Figure 1-5. You can click a thumbnail page
to have that page displayed in the document window. You can also choose
View➪Navigation Panels to access the panels. There are 14 panels: Articles,
Attachments, Bookmarks, Comments, Content, Destination, How To, Info,
Layers, Model Tree, Order, Pages, Signatures, and Tags.
Many panels have more advanced uses that are covered in later chapters of
this minibook. In this chapter, we provide you with a brief understanding of
how you can use the Pages tab to more easily navigate through a PDF docu-
ment. Just do this:
1. Make sure that the Pages panel is visible by clicking its panel icon.
2. In the Pages panel, click any page thumbnail to navigate directly to
that page.
A dark border appears around the selected page. In the lower-right
corner of the page is a very small red box.
3. Drag the small red box up and toward the left, in a diagonal move-
ment, to focus the magnification on a smaller portion of the page.

You don’t need Adobe Acrobat to create Portable Document Format
(PDF) files from Adobe Creative Suite documents — this capability is
built right into the Creative Suite application — but you do need Acrobat for
creating PDF files from many other programs. Converting documents to the
PDF format is a great way to share information. In this chapter, you find out
how to create Adobe PDF files from a variety of programs.
Creating PDF Files from Microsoft Office
Adobe Acrobat includes tools that make it easy to convert Microsoft Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint files to PDF. These capabilities are much more robust
for the Windows versions of these programs, so Macintosh users may find
that not all these options are available.
When you install Acrobat on your computer, it looks for Microsoft Office
programs. If it locates Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or Outlook, it installs a util-
ity called PDF Maker 8 that helps convert Microsoft Office documents to
PDF. This utility installs a PDF Maker 8 toolbar that appears in these pro-
grams, allowing for one-click PDF creation.
You can tell whether Adobe Acrobat PDF Maker 8 has been installed for
these Microsoft Office programs by looking for the Adobe PDF menu to the
right of the Help menu, and the PDF Maker 8 toolbar. If the Adobe PDF menu
is not there, check View➪Toolbars to see whether Adobe Acrobat PDF
Maker 8 is available to select in the Toolbars submenu. If it still isn’t avail-
able, it’s possible that Acrobat did not install Adobe PDF Maker 8. To gain
access to the Adobe PDF Maker 8 utility, you can reinstall Adobe Acrobat.
When you convert documents to Adobe PDF, the original file remains
unchanged, so you’ll have both the original file and a separate PDF docu-
ment. The original document and the PDF aren’t linked, so changes to the
original source file aren’t reflected in the PDF file.

PDF conversion options
Adobe PDF Maker 8 provides a variety of controls over how PDF files are cre-
ated. For example, you can have Acrobat create the file without asking you
to confirm the location and name of the file each time you click the Convert
To Adobe PDF button, and it will simply save the file in the same location as
the original document. Similarly, you can choose to create PDF files that bal-
ance your need for quality and file size.
PDF Maker 8 provides controls over the type of PDF file you create. This is
because some PDF files may need to be of a higher quality for printing, and
others may need to be smaller to allow for fast electronic distribution. For
example, you may want to post a PDF document to a Web site, where you
want to make the file small so that it can be quickly downloaded.
When working in Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, you can access the
PDF Maker 8 controls by choosing Adobe PDF➪Change Conversion Settings.
In the Acrobat PDF Maker 8 dialog box that appears, you can then choose
from a variety of settings that control how the PDF file is created. In this sec-
tion, we focus on the most useful options for Microsoft Office users.
From the Conversion Settings drop-down list in the Acrobat PDF Maker 8
dialog box, you can find these useful options that control how the PDF file is
generated:
✦Standard: Choose this option to create PDF files that will be printed on an
office laser printer or distributed via e-mail. This setting meets the needs
of most users — it provides some compression of graphics, but they
remain clear on-screen and look reasonably good when printed. In addi-
tion, this setting builds the fonts into the PDF file to maintain an exact rep-
resentation of the document, regardless of where the file is viewed.
✦Smallest File Size: With this setting, you can control the file size of the
PDF documents you create. This setting provides significant compres-
sion of images and also reduces resolution, which causes graphics
within the files to lose some clarity and perhaps appear jagged.
In addition, fonts aren’t embedded in PDF files created with this setting.
If the fonts used in the document aren’t available on a computer where a
PDF created with the Smallest File Size setting is viewed, Acrobat uses a
font substitution technology to replicate the size and shape of the fonts
used in the document. This feature typically provides a similar appear-
ance to the original document, but it’s not always an exact match of the
original file.
Because this setting is so lossy you would only want to use it if you
needed to compress a large file to a small enough size to send as an
email attachment. Make certain the recipient has the fonts used in the
document installed on their computer. Otherwise, Adobe uses font
substitution.

✦Press Quality: If you need to provide PDF files to your commercial
printer or copy shop, use this setting to create a PDF file that is designed
for high-quality print reproduction. Along with including fonts in the PDF
file, the graphics aren’t significantly compressed, and they maintain a
much higher resolution. Overall, these files tend to be larger than similar
PDF files created using different settings, but the quality of the PDF file is
more important than the file size when you’re having the PDF profes-
sionally printed.
PDF conversion options from
Microsoft Word and Excel
Although Microsoft Word and Excel are widespread standards on many cor-
porate computers, they aren’t always the best choice for distributing docu-
ments. Formatting of Microsoft Word documents and Excel spreadsheets
changes depending on the fonts available on users’ computers or even the
printer they choose to print with. In addition, Microsoft Word and Excel files
can be easily edited, and users can also copy and extract information from
these files with very few limitations.
Converting a Word or Excel file to PDF overcomes these limitations and is
quite straightforward. Choose from two methods:
✦From inside Microsoft Word or Excel (make sure that the document you
want to convert to an Adobe PDF file is open), simply click the Convert
To PDF button in the main toolbar to convert the document.
✦Alternatively, choose Adobe PDF➪Convert To Adobe PDF.
No matter which method you choose, you must specify the location of the
PDF file that is created and name the file.
Choose Adobe PDF➪Change Conversion Settings and deselect the Prompt
For PDF Filename option so that PDF files are generated in one step, without
having to input the name of the PDF file.
Not only can you create PDF files from Microsoft Office applications, but you
can add other functionality into PDF documents. Choose Adobe PDF➪Change
Conversion Settings and in the dialog box that appears, use the following
settings:
✦Add Links: Automatically converts Word links, such as Web addresses,
into PDF links that you can use when viewing the file in Acrobat or the
Adobe Reader. Click the Word tab to access additional link options that
can be built into PDF files created from Word.

Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative Suite Applications
806
✦Add Bookmarks: Adds interactive bookmarks that make navigating the
PDF file easy. Bookmarks are added based on Microsoft Word styles,
such as text that is styled as Heading 1. The bookmarks appear in the
Bookmarks palette when viewing the PDF.
Converting PowerPoint files to PDF
You can convert your PowerPoint presentations to Adobe PDF documents
using PDF Maker 8. PDFs make it easy to distribute electronic versions of
presentations, without worrying that the file may be edited, or that the recip-
ient may not have the same fonts that you used.
From PowerPoint, click the Convert To Adobe PDF button to save the file as
an Adobe PDF file. (Make sure that the presentation you’re converting is
open before you click the button!).You can also choose Adobe PDF➪Convert
To Adobe PDF from PowerPoint’s main menu. If you’re working with a new
file, you must save it before Adobe PDF Maker 8 will convert it.
As with Word and Excel, you can choose Adobe PDF➪Change Conversion
Settings within PowerPoint to select options relating to the conversion.
Along with the conversion settings that impact the quality of the resulting
PDF file, you should select two additional options:
✦Save Slide Transitions In Adobe PDF: With this option, you can have
the slide transitions that were created in PowerPoint converted into PDF
transitions that will be used when the presentation is delivered using
Adobe Acrobat’s Full Screen View option.
✦Convert Multimedia To PDF Multimedia: Because Adobe PDF files are
able to contain integrated sound and movie files, you can choose this
option to have sounds and movies used in a PowerPoint file converted
into the PDF document.
You can even use PDF as the method for delivering presentations that have
been created using PowerPoint by choosing Window➪Full Screen View after
you’ve converted the file to PDF. You can also click the Full Screen option in
the lower left corner of the document window. Press the Esc key to stop
viewing the document in the Full Screen mode.
Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative
Suite Applications
Throughout this book, we discuss how to integrate the applications within
the Adobe Creative Suite. You won’t be surprised to know that you can easily
convert a Photoshop file, an Illustrator file, or an InDesign document to the
PDF format. In this section, we show you how.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Creating PDF Files
Creating PDF Files from Adobe Creative Suite Applications
807
Converting Photoshop and Illustrator files to PDF
Both Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Adobe Illustrator CS3 can save documents
directly in the Adobe PDF file format. To do so, simply choose File➪Save or
File➪Save As. Then, from the File Type drop-down list, choose Adobe PDF
(Illustrator) or Photoshop PDF (Photoshop). In these programs, you can
create PDF files without Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Distiller.
You can view PDF files created from Photoshop or Illustrator using Adobe
Acrobat or Adobe Reader. But you can also open and edit these PDF files
using the same program in which they were created. For example, you can
open and modify a logo created using Adobe Illustrator and saved as a PDF
file from Illustrator at a later time with Illustrator. You can also view the
same file using either Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat software.
Converting InDesign documents to PDF
As with Photoshop and Illustrator, the ability to convert InDesign documents
to PDF is integrated into the application. Using Adobe InDesign CS3, you can
choose File➪Export and select Adobe PDF from the File Type drop-down list.
InDesign provides a significant number of options for controlling the size
and quality of the resulting PDF file. Many of these options are similar to
those available for PDF Maker 8 for Microsoft Office.
In the Adobe InDesign Export PDF dialog box, you can choose from the
Preset drop-down list at the top of the dialog box. The choices are many, but
we list and describe here the most commonly used settings:
✦Smallest File Size: Creates compact Adobe PDF files that are intended
for display on the Internet or to be distributed via e-mail. Use this set-
ting to create PDF files that will be viewed primarily on-screen.
✦High Quality Print: Creates Adobe PDF files that are intended for desk-
top printers and digital copiers.
✦Press Quality: Use this setting to create PDF files that will be delivered
to a commercial printer, for high-quality, offset print reproduction.
When creating PDF files to be used for high-resolution printing, be certain to
select Marks And Bleeds in the list on the left in the Export PDF dialog box,
as shown in Figure 2-1, and specify the amount of space items need to extend
off the page (bleed). If you’re delivering the file to a printing firm, they can
provide you with guidance as to the value you should use for bleed and
marks offset. A good rule to follow is to use at least .125 inches if you have
items extending all the way to the edge of your document pages. Specify the
value you want by entering the value in the Bleed And Slug section of the
Marks And Bleeds tab. If the amount of bleed is to be the same on all four
sides, type the value in the Top text field and then click the link icon to the
right of the Top and Bottom Bleed text fields.

Converting Other Electronic Documents to PDF
808
Converting Other Electronic Documents to PDF
Adobe has made it quite easy to create PDF files from other Adobe Creative
Suite applications and Microsoft Office programs, but you can also create
PDF files from many other programs. When you installed the Adobe Creative
Suite on your computer, you also installed a new printer, called the Adobe
PDF 8 printer, which is used to convert documents to Adobe PDF files. This
printer captures all the same information that is normally sent to your
printer, and, instead of creating a piece of paper, the information is con-
verted into an Adobe PDF file.
To create a PDF file from any program, choose File➪Print. In the Print dialog
box, select Adobe PDF 8 as the printer and click OK (click Print on a Mac).
To change the type of PDF file that is created, such as a smaller file for
Internet Web posting, or a higher quality file for delivery to a commercial
printer, do this:
✦Windows: Click the Properties button in the Print dialog box to open the
Adobe PDF Document Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2. Here,
you can choose the PDF settings you want to use to control the quality
and size of the resulting PDF file.
✦Mac OS: Choose PDF Options from the Copies And Pages menu and then
choose the PDF settings.

We discuss the settings earlier in this chapter, in the “PDF conversion
options” section.
This process of navigating through the Print menu may appear strange, but
it is probably the easiest way for Adobe to capture all the same information
that you’d expect to see when you print your files. This provides an easy and
standard method for generating PDF files from any program. In fact, you can
even use this method for creating PDF files from Microsoft Office programs
or other programs in the Adobe Creative Suite if you want.
Bookmarks and links aren’t exported if a PDF is generated using the Print
menu option.
Creating PDF Files from Paper
Documents and the Web
PDF files don’t need to start as electronic publishing files. Adobe Acrobat
provides options for converting both paper documents and Internet Web
pages into PDF format.
Converting paper documents to PDF
To convert paper documents into PDF, you need a scanner to digitize the
information. If you expect to scan a large number of pages into PDF, consider
purchasing a scanner with an automatic document feeder. Some scanners
can scan both the front and backside of a document at the same time.
Figure 2-2:

810
Unfortunately, we can’t fully describe all the ins and outs of choosing a scan-
ner to fit your needs, but Mark L. Chambers does a swell job of it in his book,
Scanners For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
If a scanner is already hooked to the computer on which you use Acrobat,
follow these steps to scan in a paper document and then convert it to PDF
format:
1. From the Acrobat main menu, choose File➪Create PDF➪From Scanner.
The Create PDF From Scanner dialog box appears.
2. Make sure that your scanner is turned on, put the document to be
scanned into the scanner, and then click the Scan button.
If necessary, continue to scan multiple pages into a single document.
When you’re done scanning, the scanned page appears in Acrobat.
3. Choose File➪Save to save the PDF.
If you have a PDF open and choose Create PDF From Scanner, a window
appears, giving you the opportunity to append the file (add to the exist-
ing file) or create a new PDF file.
The document opens in Acrobat.
If the pages need to be rotated, you can choose Document➪Rotate Pages.
Some scanners now automatically convert scanned documents to Adobe
PDF files and automatically rotate them.
Use the Zoom In tool to increase the magnification of what you’ve just
scanned. You can see that the text is jagged because it’s a picture of the text.
If you need the text to be searchable, use Document➪OCR Text
Recognition➪Recognize Text Using OCR. This command makes the text you
have just scanned searchable. Otherwise, you have only a picture of the text.
Scanned text is unlike text from electronic documents that you create using
either PDF Maker 8 or the Adobe PDF Printer. Both of these options create
text that looks very clear, even when enlarged.
Converting Web pages to PDFs
By converting online content to Adobe PDF, you can capture contents from an
Internet Web site. Because Web content can change rapidly, you can capture
something that may not remain online for a long period of time. You can con-
vert things such as news stories or competitive information ca from a Web
site into PDF in a single click. And because PDF files can easily be combined
with other PDF documents, you can merge information from a variety of
sources, such as spreadsheets, word-processing documents, and brochures.

If you want to convert only a single page and are using Internet Explorer,
click the Convert Web Page To PDF button. This step converts the current
web page to a PDF. If you want to convert more than a single page, follow
these steps from within Acrobat (not your Web browser):
1. From the Acrobat main menu, choose File➪Create PDF➪From
Web Page.
The Create PDF From Web Page dialog box opens.
2. In the URL text field, enter the URL for the Web site you’re converting
to PDF.
3. To capture additional pages that are linked from the main page you’re
capturing, select the Get Only radio button (selected by default), enter
the number of levels to be captured in the Levels text field, and then
select one of the following:
• Select the Stay On Same Path check box if you want only URLs
(pages) subordinate from the entered URL converted to PDF.
• Select the Stay On Same Server check box to download only pages
that are on the same server as the entered URL.
Be cautious about selecting the Get Entire Site radio button instead of
the Get Only radio button. The Get Entire Site option may take an enor-
mous amount of time and not have any relevance to what you need.
4. Click the Settings button to open the Web Page Conversion Settings
dialog box and see accepted File types and change PDF settings (on
the General tab), as shown in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3:

5. On the Page layout tab of the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog
box, make changes to page size, orientation, and margins.
6. When you’re done making changes in the Web Page Conversion
Settings dialog box, click OK.
7. Back in the Create PDF From Web Page dialog box, click the Create
button.
The Downloading Status window opens, showing the rate of download.
When the download is complete, the Web page (for the entered URL) selected
appears as a PDF with existing hyperlinks (links to other pages within the site)
left intact. When links on the converted Web page are selected, the viewer can
open the page either in Acrobat or the Web browser.

to PDF Files
In This Chapter

B
ecause many Adobe PDF documents are viewed online, you need to
make the documents easy for readers to navigate. Using Acrobat, you
can design documents that are easier to navigate than their printed counter-
parts and that include rich interactive features that simply aren’t available
with paper documents.
Rather than making readers scroll through a document to find what they
want, you can add links within an index or table of contents, or you can add
links to Web sites and e-mail addresses. Acrobat also includes features
(known as bookmarks) to build your own online table of contents, and you
can add buttons that link to specific pages within a PDF document or that
cause an action to occur when clicked, such as closing the document. We
discuss all these features in this chapter.
Adding Bookmarks to Ease PDF Navigation
One reason for distributing PDF documents is that it’s convenient and cost-
effective. But if users can’t easily find the information they need, or they’re
unable to effectively understand how the contents of a file are structured,
they may become frustrated, or they may need to print the document,
which defeats the purpose of electronic distribution.
A table of contents in a traditional, printed book doesn’t work well with elec-
tronic PDF files. It requires you to constantly return to the page containing
the contents and then navigate to the page containing the data you need.
But you can make your documents more user-friendly by adding bookmarks,
which are the equivalent of a table of contents that is always available, no
matter what page is being viewed in the document window.
Bookmarks provide a listing of contents that reside within a PDF file, or links
to relevant external content. Bookmarks sit within a panel, and when you click
one, you’re taken to a specific destination in the PDF document (or possibly

Adding Bookmarks to Ease PDF Navigation
814
to an external file), much like a hyperlink. Acrobat technically calls the panel a
panel, but all other Adobe Creative Suite programs call them panels — so
that’s what we call them here. You can create bookmarks from existing text, or
you can use your own text to describe the content, such as a chart or graphic.
By default, the Bookmarks icon resides along the left side of the 
Acrobat document window in what is called the navigation pane.
Click the Bookmarks icon to make the panel appear; click the Bookmarks
icon a second time to hide it. If the icon isn’t visible, choose
View➪Navigation Panels➪Bookmarks to make it appear.
Creating bookmarks that link to a page
By navigating to a page, and to a specific view on a page, you can establish
the destination of a bookmark link. With a PDF document open, follow these
steps:
1. If the Bookmark icon isn’t visible, choose View➪Navigation Panels➪
Bookmarks.
The Bookmarks panel appears on the left of the document window.
2. In the document window, navigate to the page that you want as the
bookmark’s destination.
3. Set the magnification of the view that you want by using the Marquee
Zoom tool to either zoom in or zoom out.
The zoom level that you are at when you create the bookmark is the
view that viewers see when they click the bookmark.
4. In the Bookmarks panel, choose Options➪New Bookmark.
The new bookmark appears in the Bookmarks panel as Untitled.
5. Change the name by typing something more descriptive.
If you leave the bookmark as Untitled but want to rename it later, you
must click the bookmark and then choose Options➪Rename Bookmark
from the menu in the Bookmark panel.
6. Test your bookmark by scrolling to another page and view in the docu-
ment window; then click your saved bookmark in the Bookmark panel.
The document window shows the exact location and zoom that you
selected when you created the bookmark.
If you use the Selection tool to highlight text, such as a headline or a caption,
that is a part of the bookmark destination and then choose Options➪
New Bookmark, the selected text becomes the title of the new bookmark.
You can use this shortcut to avoid entering a new name for new bookmark
titles. You can also press Ctrl+B (Ô+B on a Mac) to quickly create a book-
mark.

815
Creating bookmarks that link to external files
Although bookmarks are most commonly used to link to content within a
PDF file, you can also use bookmarks to create links to other documents. To
create a link to an external file, follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪New Bookmark in the Bookmarks panel.
2. Replace the Untitled bookmark entry that appears in the Bookmarks
panel with an appropriate title for the bookmark.
3. Choose Options➪Properties from the Bookmarks panel.
The Bookmark Properties dialog box appears. Using this dialog box, you
can change a bookmark so that it links to any type of file. In this exam-
ple, we use a PDF document, but the bookmark could be a link to
another PDF file, a Photoshop file, or even a Microsoft Excel file. Just
remember that this bookmark creates a relative link. The linked file must
travel with the PDF document in order for the link to work.
4. In the Bookmark Properties dialog box, click the Actions tab and
choose Open A File from the Select Action drop-down list and then
click the Add button.
The Select File To Open dialog box appears.
5. Click the Browse button, choose a file to which the bookmark will
navigate, and then click the Select button.
6. In the Specify Open Preference window, choose whether you want the
linked file to open in a new document, new window, or existing
window and then click OK.
Note that the other file isn’t attached to the current document. If you distrib-
ute a PDF file containing the bookmarks to external files, you must distribute
any external files that are referenced along with the source file; otherwise,
the links will not work. In addition, the linked files need to be in the same rel-
ative location as the original documents — so don’t change the name of the
linked file or the folder in which it is located.
You can create links to non-PDF files. Instead of choosing Go To A Page In
Another Document, choose Open A File to open a non-PDF file or choose
Open A Web Link to access an Internet Web address.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks are intuitive to use, which makes them an attractive option to add
to PDF files. After you click a bookmark, the action associated with it is per-
formed, which typically navigates you to a certain page within the PDF file.

Adding Bookmarks to Ease PDF Navigation
816
Unfortunately, the Bookmarks panel doesn’t open automatically with a docu-
ment, even when bookmarks are present within a file. To display the
Bookmarks panel when a file is opened, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Properties.
2. In the Document Properties dialog box that opens, select the Initial
View tab, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. From the Navigation drop-down list, choose Bookmarks Panel And
Page and then click OK.
After the file is saved and then reopened, the Bookmarks panel is dis-
played whenever the document is opened.
Editing bookmarks
You can change the attributes of bookmarks so that they link to other loca-
tions by clicking to select a bookmark and then choosing Options➪Properties
in the Bookmarks panel. In the Bookmark Properties dialog box, choose the
color and font type of the bookmark on the Appearance tab: To change the
bookmark’s font style, choose a style from the Style drop-down list; to change
the bookmark’s color, click the Color box and choose a color from the color
picker.

On the Actions tab of the Bookmark Properties dialog box, you can delete
existing actions (in the Actions section of the Actions tab) by clicking to
select an action and then clicking the Delete button. Also, you can add
actions by choosing another action from the Add Action section and then
clicking the Add button. You can add more than one action to a bookmark.
Adding Interactive Links
When viewing a PDF file electronically, you can add links for e-mail
addresses, Web addresses, and references to other pages. Links are attached
to a region of a page, which you identify with the Link tool.
To add an interactive link to your PDF document, follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪New Bookmark in the Bookmarks panel.
2. After locating an area of a page where you want to add a link, Choose
View➪Toolbars➪Advanced Editing to display the Advanced Editing
toolbar.
3. Select the Link tool and then click and drag to select the region that
you want to link to.
The Create Link dialog box appears.
4. Choose a Link Action:
• Go To A Page View: This option is the default, where you can scroll
to the page that is the destination of the link.
• Open A File: Alternatively, you can choose to link to another file;
click the Browse button to locate the file.
• Open A Web Page: If you choose this option, you’re choosing to link
to a Web address. In the Address text field, enter the complete
address of the Web site to which the link should direct viewers. To
create a link to an e-mail address, type mailto: followed by an e-mail
address. Note that mailto: is all one word with no spaces.
• Custom Link: Use this option to choose from other types of links in
the Link Properties dialog box.
5. Click Next, and follow the instructions in the next dialog box before
clicking OK.
The Link tool is relatively simple to use, but you may prefer to create links
from text in another way: Using the Selection tool, select the text, right-click
(Ctrl+click on a Mac) the selected text, and then choose Create Link from the
contextual menu that appears.

Adding Buttons to Simplify Your PDF Files
818
Remember that you can also have links automatically transferred from your
original Microsoft Office documents when using PDF Maker.
You can edit links by choosing the Link tool and double-clicking the link to
open the Link Properties dialog box. While editing a link, you can change
how it’s presented in the Appearance tab. Make a link invisible or add a
border to the link, such as a blue border that commonly is used to define
hyperlinks. On the Actions tab of the Link Properties dialog box, you can
add, edit, or delete actions, just as you can with bookmarks (see the
preceding section).
Adding Buttons to Simplify Your PDF Files
Along with links and bookmarks, buttons provide another way to make your
files more useful when they’re viewed online. You can create interactive but-
tons entirely within Acrobat — designing their appearance and adding text
to them. Or you can import buttons created in other Adobe Creative Suite
applications, such as Photoshop and Illustrator. For example, you can create
buttons that advance the viewer to the next page in a document.
Buttons are added by using the Button tool located on the Forms toolbar.
Choose View➪Toolbars➪Forms to open the Forms menu.
To add a button to your PDF document, follow these steps:
1. Click the OK Button tool and click and drag to create the region
where the button will appear.
The Button Properties dialog box appears.
2. In the General tab, you can enter a name for the button in the Name
text field and provide a Tooltip in the Tooltip text field.
A ToolTip is the text that appears whenever the mouse cursor is posi-
tioned over the button.
3. In the Appearance tab, establish how your button will look:
• Border Color/Fill Color: Click the square to the right of the appropri-
ate attribute in the Borders And Colors section of the Appearance
tab and then choose a color from the color picker.
• Line Thickness and Style: These options don’t appear unless you
change the border color from none (red diagonal line) to another
selection.

• Text Color: Change the color of the text by clicking the color square
and choosing a color from the color picker.
4. In the Options tab, make these selections:
• Layout: Use the Layout drop-down list to specify whether you want
to use a label (text that you enter in Acrobat that appears on the face
of the button) or whether you want an icon (an imported button
graphic that you may have designed using Photoshop or Illustrator).
• Behavior: Choose Push from the Behavior drop-down list to create
different appearances for a button so that it changes based upon
whether the mouse cursor is positioned over the button. The button
appearance can also change when clicked.
• State: To specify the different appearances (see Behavior, discussed
in the preceding paragraph), click the State on the left side of the
Options tab and then choose the Label or Icon status for each state.
• Label: If you choose to use a label, enter the text for it in the Label
text field.
• Icon: If you choose to use an icon, specify the location of the graphic
file by clicking the Choose Icon button. You can create button icons
in either Photoshop or Illustrator.
5. In the Actions tab, you can choose an action from the Select Action
drop-down list and then click the Add button.
Actions are applied to buttons similar to the way in which they’re
applied to links and bookmarks.
• To choose actions that are a part of the menu commands, such as
printing a document, closing a file, or navigating to the next or pre-
ceding page, choose the Execute Menu Item action and then specify
the command to be accessed.
• You can also choose the activity that causes the action to occur,
known as the trigger. The default trigger is Mouse Up, which causes
the action to occur when the mouse button is depressed and then
released. You can choose other actions, such as the mouse cursor
merely rolling over the button without the need to click it.
6. After you make all your changes in the Button Properties dialog box,
click Close and you’re done.

 Manipulating text with the TouchUp tools
 Modifying graphics with the TouchUp tools
 Pulling text and graphics out of PDFs for use in other documents
You may assume that PDF files are mere pictures of your documents and
can’t be edited, but nothing is further from the truth. Adobe Acrobat
includes a variety of tools for editing both text and graphics. You can use
these tools as long as the file has not been secured to prohibit editing. We
introduce you to these great tools in this chapter. (We discuss security, which
allows you to limit access to these tools, in Chapter 6 of this minibook.)
Editing Text
The tools for editing text and graphics are located on the Advanced Editing
toolbar (see Figure 4-1). You can add several TouchUp tools to the
Advanced Editing tool bar by choosing View➪Toolbars➪More tools and
checking the tools you want to add. You have three choices:
✦TouchUp Text Tool: Used to manipulate text.
✦TouchUp Object Tool: Used to manipulate objects.
✦TouchUp Reading Order Tool: Used to correct the reading order or
structure of the document.
The TouchUp Reading Order tool isn’t used for changing the appearance of
the document, so we don’t discuss it in this chapter.
Figure 4-1:

Using the TouchUp Text tool to manipulate text
The TouchUp Text tool is used for touching up, or manipulating, text. This
touchup can include changing actual text characters or the appearance
of text. You can change the word “cat” to read “dog,” or you can change
black text to make it blue, or you can even change the Helvetica font to
the Times font.
When you change a PDF file, the original source document isn’t modified.
You have a few ways to accomplish text edits:
✦Choose the TouchUp Text tool, click within the text that you want to
change to obtain an insertion point, and then start typing the new text.
✦Insert the TouchUp tool into your text and press the Backspace or
Delete key to delete text.
✦Drag, using the TouchUp tool, to highlight text and enter new text to
replace the highlighted text.
When changing text — whether you’re adding or deleting — Acrobat tries to
use the font that was specified in the original document. Sometimes, this
font is built into the PDF file, which means that it’s embedded in the file.
Other times, the font may not be available either because it hasn’t been
embedded or it’s been embedded as a subset where only some of the charac-
ters from the font are included in the PDF file. In these cases, Acrobat may
provide the following warning message:
All or part of the selection has no available system font. You cannot add or
delete text using the currently selected font.
Fortunately, you can change the font if you need to edit the text. However,
when you change the font, the text may not retain the same appearance as
the original document. In some instances, you may not have the exact same
font on your computer as the font used in the PDF document, but you may
have a similar font you can use without causing a noticeable change — most
people won’t notice the difference between Helvetica and Arial or between
Times and Times New Roman. Fonts with the same name but from different
font designers often look very similar. For example, Adobe Garamond looks
similar to ITC Garamond, even though they’re two different fonts.
To change the font that is used for a word or range of words, follow these
steps:
1. Select the text with the TouchUp Text tool by dragging across it.
You will probably get a message that reads Loading System Fonts
followed by another message that reads Loading Document Fonts.
Depending on the number of fonts installed on your system, it may take
a while for this message to appear.

2. Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) the highlighted text and then choose
Properties from the contextual menu.
The TouchUp Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-2.
3. In the Text tab, choose the typeface you want to use from the Font
drop-down list and make any other changes you want.
In this dialog box, you can also change the size by selecting or typing a
number into the Font Size drop-down list. In addition, you can modify
the color by clicking the Fill color swatch.
4. When you’re satisfied with your changes, click the Close button to
apply your changes to the selected text.

Typewriter tool
You can use the Typewriter tool to type any-
where on the document. This tool resembles
the Text Box tool, though its default properties
are different. Access the Typewriter tool by
choosing Tools➪Typewriter➪Show Typewriter
Toolbar. Then, select the Typewriter icon, posi-
tion your cursor where you want to begin typing
and type, pressing the Enter key whenever you
want to add a line. The Increase and Decrease
size buttons will enlarge or diminish your type
size.
Likewise, to change the leading, you select the
text and choose the Increase or Decrease Line
Spacing buttons. You can move or resize the
Typewriter block by selecting it with the Select
tool and either moving or resizing the text box.
Your text remains editable. So, if you’ve made a
mistake and want to correct it, or want to add
or delete text, you select the Typewriter tool
again and double-click in the type box.

Editing Text
824
Using the TouchUp Object tool to edit graphics
You can use the TouchUp Object tool to access editing software for modify-
ing graphics. For example, you can use the TouchUp Object tool to select a
graphic, bring the graphic into Photoshop, and then save the modified ver-
sion back into the PDF file. In other words, you can edit the graphics used in
PDF documents, even if you don’t have access to the original graphic files.
To edit a photographic file from Acrobat in Photoshop, follow these steps:
1. Select the image using the TouchUp Object tool, right-click (Ctrl+click
on a Mac) on a photographic image with the TouchUp Object tool, and
then choose Edit Image from the contextual menu.
The image file opens in Adobe Photoshop.
2. Using the many tools of Photoshop, make the necessary changes to
the graphic and then choose File➪Save.
When you return to the PDF file in Acrobat, the graphic is automatically
updated in the PDF document.
If you have the original graphic file, it remains untouched — only the version
used within the PDF file is modified. It isn’t necessary to have the original
graphic file to perform these steps.
You can also use Acrobat to edit vector objects from within PDF files, such
as those created using Adobe Illustrator. Just follow these steps:
1. Select a piece of vector artwork using the TouchUp Object tool, right-
click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) on the vector artwork, and then choose
Edit Object from the contextual menu.
Note that Acrobat displays Edit Object in the contextual menu if it
detects a vector object, and it displays Edit Image if it detects a bitmap
image. Acrobat also displays Edit Objects (note the plural) if you have
more than one object selected.
If you’re editing a complex illustration, be sure to select all its compo-
nents by holding down the Ctrl key (Ô on a Mac) while clicking them
with the TouchUp Object tool.
After you choose Edit Object, the object opens for editing in Adobe
Illustrator.
2. Make the necessary changes in Illustrator, choose File➪Save.
The graphic is updated in the PDF document.

825
If Acrobat doesn’t start Photoshop or Illustrator after choosing the Edit
Image or Edit Object command, you may need to access preferences by
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Touch Up and then specify which programs
should be used for editing images or objects.
You can also use the TouchUp Object tool to edit the position of text or
graphic objects on a page, which includes the ability to relocate individual
lines of text or to change the position of a graphic on a page. After you’ve
selected an object with the TouchUp Object tool, you can simply drag it to a
new location on the page.
Exporting Text and Graphics
Although editing text and graphics is helpful, you may need to take text or
images from a PDF document and use them in another file. Fortunately,
Acrobat also includes tools to make this a breeze. Of course, you should
always make certain that you have the permission of the owner of a docu-
ment before reusing content that is not your original work.
You need the Select & Zoom toolbar for extracting text and graphics, so
make sure that it’s visible. If it isn’t, choose View➪Toolbars➪Select & Zoom.
You can export text, images, or charts from Acrobat in three ways:
✦Select/Copy/Paste.
✦Save As To Word Document, JPEG, TIFF, HTML Web Page, XML 1.0,
Encapsulated PostScript, HTML 3.2, JPEG 2000, PNG, PostScript, Rich
Text Format, Text Accessible, Text (Plain).
✦Use the Snapshot tool to send selected areas to the Clipboard where
they will be available to use in other applications or save the selected
area as a TIFF file.
Exporting text using Select, Copy, and Paste
Make sure that the Select & Zoom toolbar is visible and then follow these
steps to select, copy, and paste text from a PDF file:
1. Using the Select tool, highlight the text you want to export.
The Select tool is the I-Bar/Black Arrow in the toolbar. When you hold
the arrow over a section of your document, it will turn into an I-Bar
cursor, which you can drag to select the text you want to copy.

Exporting Text and Graphics
826
If the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands are unavailable after you’ve
selected some text, the author of the document may have set the security
settings to disallow copying. If you can’t select the text, you may be trying
to copy text that is part of an image.
2. Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) the selected text and choose Copy
from the contextual menu.
Being able to extract the text out of a PDF document by selecting and
copying it is useful if you don’t have access to the original source docu-
ment, but you need to use the text from a PDF file.
3. Open another text-editing program, such as Adobe InDesign or
Microsoft Word.
You can paste the copied text into a new document or a preexisting file.
4. Insert your cursor in the document at the appropriate spot and choose
File➪Paste.
The text is pasted into the document, ready for you to use.
Exporting text using Save As
The File➪Save As command exports all the text in your PDF file. A drop-
down menu gives you various format options. After choosing an option and
any settings, click the OK button to select the settings and the Save button
to save the text. The File➪Export command gives you the same options.
Here are the formats you can use to export text:
✦Microsoft Word Document: Use the Settings button to choose whether
or not to save the comments or images with your document. If you
choose to save the comments or images, you can select additional for-
matting options.
✦Rich Text Format: Use the Settings button to choose whether or not to
save the comments or images with your document. If you choose to save
the comments or images, you can select additional formatting options.
✦Text (Accessible): Use this format to create a file that can be printed to a
Braille printer.
✦Text (Plain) (secondary Settings): This format creates a plain vanilla file
with no formatting. You can save some secondary options in various file
encodings. Also, you can select to save the images in your PDF in a sepa-
rate images folder.
✦Adobe PDF, Encapsulated PostScript, PostScript.
✦Various Adobe PDF Options.

✦Various graphics formats (JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, TIFF), but your text
will no longer be editable.
Text that is copied from a PDF file is no longer linked to the original doc-
ument. Edits made to the extracted text aren’t reflected within the PDF
file, and it is extremely difficult to have the extracted text reinserted into
the PDF document. Think of the extraction process as a one-way trip for
the text, which can be extracted but not reinserted.
You can also copy text within a table to the Clipboard or open it directly in a
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. And you maintain the table’s
formatting after it is extracted. Just follow these steps:
1. Click the Select tool and click and drag to select the text in the table.
You can also position your cursor just outside the edge of the table and
then draw a box around a table.
A border appears around the selected table.
2. Right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) and choose Open Table In
Spreadsheet from the contextual menu or save the table directly to a
file or save a copy to the Clipboard to be later pasted.
The table opens in Excel or whatever spreadsheet program you have
installed on your computer.
To save the table directly to a file, choose Save Table As from the contex-
tual menu.
To copy the table to the Clipboard so that you can paste it into other
documents, choose Copy As Table from the contextual menu.
And that’s it. You can now use that table in another program.
Extracting graphics
You can also extract graphics from DF files, but
extracting graphics is very different from edit-
ing them. We discuss editing graphics and
vector objects earlier in this chapter. When
editing graphics, you open the original graphic
file at its highest possible quality. Extracting
graphics is different because they’re removed
at the quality of the screen display resolution,
which may be of much lower quality than the
original, embedded graphics.
With the Select tool, right-click (Ctrl+click on a
Mac) an image, or drag with the Select tool to
select a part of the image. Then you can either
drag and drop the selection into an open docu-
ment or choose Copy Image from the contex-
tual menu. The image is now available to be
pasted into other applications. The other option
in the contextual menu is to Save Image As and
save the selected area as a TIFF file.

Exporting Text and Graphics
828
Snapshot tool
You can use the Snapshot tool to select both text and images and create a
picture of a certain area within a PDF file. The result is commonly referred to
as a screen grab of a section within a PDF file. The result is an image, and
your text is no longer editable.
To use the Snapshot tool, choose Tools➪Select & Zoom➪Snapshot Tool. You
then have two options.
✦After you select the Snapshot tool, click anywhere in the page. The snap-
shot tool automatically captures everything displayed on the screen.
✦After you select the Snapshot tool, click and drag a rectangle around an
area of the page.
You can include text and images. The area you’ve selected will be saved to
the Clipboard so that you can paste it into another document. The Snapshot
tool remains active so that you can keep selecting areas and saving them to
the Clipboard. However, the previous selection in your Clipboard is deleted
when you make a new selection. So, make certain you’ve pasted a selection
into your other document before you make a new selection.
You have to select another tool to deactivate the Snapshot tool.

and Annotation Tools
In This Chapter
 Adding comments to PDF files
 Working with comments
O
ne of the fantastic features of Acrobat is the capability to mark up docu-
ments electronically using virtual sticky notes called comments. You can
mark up text to indicate changes and add annotations and drawing comments
to a PDF file. The Acrobat commenting tools do not change the original file,
and you can remove the comments at any time, which means you can disable
comments for printing or viewing at any time. In this chapter, we describe
these great features and show you how to put them to work for you.
Creating Comments
You can easily add annotations to PDF files, including stamps, text highlights,
callouts, and electronic sticky notes, by using the Comment & Markup
Toolbar, which you can access by clicking the Review & Comment option in
the Tasks toolbar. You can then choose to display the Comment & Markup
Tools.
You can also access the Comment & Markup toolbar by choosing View➪
Toolbars➪Comment & Markup.
The Comment & Markup toolbar
The Comment & Markup toolbar, shown in Figure 5-1, provides several tools
for adding comments to PDF documents. It also includes a Show menu to
help manage comments and the process of adding comments. We discuss
these tools in the following sections.
The Sticky Note tool
Use the Sticky Note tool to add electronic sticky notes to your files. You can
click the location where you want the note to appear within a PDF document.
An icon, representing the note, appears, along with a window where you can
enter text. After entering text in the sticky note, close the window so that the
document isn’t hidden beneath it. You can change the icon and color used to

represent the note by right-clicking (Ctrl+clicking on a Mac) the note and
choosing Properties from the contextual menu. In the Properties dialog box
that appears, make the changes to the note icon or color and then click Close.
The Text Edits tool
The Text Edits tool is actually six separate text commenting tools. Use these
tools to replace selected text, highlight selected text, add a note to selected
text, insert text at cursor, underline selected text, and cross out text for
deletion.
To use the Text Edits tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Text Edits tool and drag to select text that requires a
change or comment.
2. Click the arrow to the right of the Text Edits tool to access the drop-
down list containing your six choices.
3. Choose an option from the list of available editing choices:
• Replace Selected Text: Replaces the selected text.
• Highlight Selected Text: Highlights the selected text.
• Add A Note To Selected Text: Allows you to add a note to the
selected text.
• Insert Text At Cursor: Places a cursor at the end of the selected text.
• Underline Selected Text: Underlines the selected text.
• Cross Out Text For Deletion: Crosses out the selected text.
Your selected text changes, depending on what you choose from the list.

After selecting the text that requires a comment, you can press the Delete or
Backspace key to indicate a text edit to remove the text. Similarly, you can
start to type, and Acrobat will create an insertion point. Also, if you right-
click (Ctrl-click on a Mac) after selecting the text, you can select the type of
edit or comment you want to insert from the contextual menu.
The Stamp tool
You can use stamps to identify documents or to highlight a certain part of
a document. Common stamps include Confidential, Draft, Sign Here, and
Approved.
The stamps are grouped into sections. Some stamps automatically add your
default user name along with the date and time you applied them to the doc-
ument; these stamps are available under the Dynamic category in the
Stamps menu. The more traditional business stamps, such as Confidential,
appear under the Standard Business category. You can access each of the
different categories by clicking the arrow to the right of the Stamp tool in the
Comment & Markup toolbar, as shown in Figure 5-2.

The Highlight, Underline Text, and Cross-Out, Callout,
and Text box tools
The Highlight, Cross-Out, and Underline text tools provide the same func-
tionality and options that are available with the Text Edits tool, but with
easier access. If you want to delete the highlighted, crossed-out, or under-
lined formatting to your text, just click the formatted area and hit the Delete
key. Your text will remain, but the formatting will disappear.
You can also call attention to areas in your document by using the Callout
and Textbox tools. If you want to delete a Callout or Text box after you’ve
added them, just highlight them and hit the Delete key.
To highlight text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Highlight Text tool from the Comment & Markup toolbar.
2. Drag over the text that you want highlighted.
The text is now highlighted.
To underline text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Underline Text tool by selecting in the Task tools Review &
Comment➪Comment & Markup Tools➪Underline Text tool.
2. Drag over the text that you want underlined.
The text is now underlined.
To cross-out text, follow these steps:
1. Select the Cross-out Text tool by selecting in the Task tools Review &
Comment➪Comment & Markup Tools➪Cross Out Text Tool.
2. Drag over the text that you want crossed out.
The text is now crossed out.

There are several types of icons to represent the attached file. You can
select a paperclip, graph, pushpin, or tag. Whatever icon you select
appears on your document to denote that another file is attached. When
you roll over the icon, a little annotation appears telling you the filename.
With the Record Audio Comment tool, you can share a verbal comment
by using a microphone and recording a message directly into the PDF.
The sound is added as a comment.
The file(s) that you attach with the Attach File tools becomes embedded
within the PDF file. The attached file remains in its original file format, even if
the attached file is not a PDF file. For example, you can attach an Excel
spreadsheet to a PDF document.
The Drawing tools
There are three shape tools, two line tools, and a pencil in the Comment &
Markup toolbar. Use the drawing tools to add lines, ovals, rectangles, and
other shapes to your PDF file. These shapes can call attention to specific

Managing Comments
836
Managing Comments
One of the most powerful features of PDF commenting is the ability to easily
manage and share comments and annotations among reviewers. For exam-
ple, you can determine which comments are displayed at any time, and you
can filter the comments by author or by the type of commenting tool used to
create the comment. In addition, you can indicate a response to a comment
and track the changes that may have been made to a document based upon
a comment. Also, you can consolidate comments from multiple reviewers
into a single document.
Viewing comments
You can use any of several methods to see a document’s list of comments:
✦Click the Comments tab along the left side of the document window in
the Navigation pane.
✦Choose Review & Comment➪Show Comments List.
✦Choose View➪Navigation Panels➪Comments.
No matter which method you use, the Comments List window that shows all
the comments in the document appears along the bottom of the document
window. You can see the author of each comment and any notes entered by
reviewers. By clicking the plus sign to the left of a comment, you can view
more information about it, such as what type of comment it is and the date
and time it was created.
If you’ve clicked the plus sign to the left of the comment to expand the view,
it changes to a minus sign, which you can then click to return to the consoli-
dated view showing only the author and the initial portions of any text from
the note.
To the right of the plus sign is a check box that you can use to indicate that
the comment has been reviewed or to indicate that a certain comment needs
further attention. Use these check boxes for your own purposes; their status
doesn’t export with the document if you send the file to others, so they’re
for your own personal use only.
Changing a comment’s review status
Acrobat makes it easy to indicate whether a comment has been reviewed,
accepted, or has additional comments attached to it. To change the status of
a comment, follow these steps:

the screen to display the comments.
2. In the Comments List, right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) on a comment
and choose Set Status➪Review from the contextual menu.
3. Select Accepted, Rejected, Cancelled, or Completed, depending on
what’s appropriate to your situation.
The comment you modified appears in the list, showing the new status
you assigned to it.
Replying to a comment
You can right-click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) on a comment in the Comments List
and choose Reply from the contextual menu to add a follow-up note to the
comment. This way, new comments can be tied to existing comments. If your
documents go through multiple rounds of review, adding a reply allows a
secondary or final reviewer to expand on the comments from an initial
reviewer. This also allows an author or designer to clearly respond to the
suggestions from an editor.
Collapsing or hiding comments
Because the Comments List can become rather large, you can choose to col-
lapse all comments so that only the page number on which comments
appear is displayed in the list. To do so, click the Collapse All button in the
upper-left of the Comments List window; it has a minus sign next to it. To
view all comments, click the Expand All button in the same location; this
button has a plus sign next to it.
To hide all the comments within a document, click and hold the Show button
on the Commenting toolbar and choose Hide All Comments. You can then
click the Show button in the Comments toolbar and choose to show com-
ments based upon:
✦Type of comment, such as note, line, or cross out
✦Reviewer, such as Bob or Jane
✦Status, such as accepted or rejected
✦Checked State, which can be checked or unchecked
Use these filtering options to view only those comments that are relevant
to you.

Sharing comments
You can share your comments with other reviewers who have access to the
same PDF document by following these steps:
1. Make sure that the Comments List is visible by clicking the Comments
tab on the left side of the document window.
2. Select the comment that you want to export by clicking it (Shift+click
for multiple selections).
3. Choose Options➪Export Selected Comments from the Comments List
window.
The Export Comments dialog box appears.
4. Browse to the location where you want the comments to be saved and
give the saved file a new name.
You now have a file that includes only the comments’ information, and
not the entire PDF file.
You can share your file with reviewers who have the same PDF file, and they
can choose Options➪Import Comments in the Comments List window to
add the comments into their document. You can use this method to avoid
sending entire PDF files to those who already have the document.
Summarizing comments
You can compile a list of all the comments from a PDF file into a new, sepa-
rate document. To summarize comments, follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Summarize Comments in the Comments List window.
The Summarize Options dialog box appears.
2. Create a listing of the comments with lines connecting them to their
locations on the page by selecting the second radio button from the
top of the list.
In the Include section, you can choose which comments should be
summarized.
3. Click Create PDF Comment Summary.
This step creates a new PDF document that simply lists all the com-
ments, as shown in Figure 5-3.

Chapter 6: Securing Your PDF Files
In This Chapter
 Finding out about security in Acrobat
 Using passwords
 Setting limits for editing and printing
You may think that because you’ve converted your documents to PDF
that they’re secure. This is not quite true, because Adobe Acrobat
includes tools for changing text and images, as well as extracting them. For
example, you can use the Select tool (see Chapter 4 of this minibook) to
select and copy a passage of text or graphics.
Applying security provides you with control over who is able to view, edit, or
print the PDF documents you distribute. You can restrict access to certain
features, which deters most users from manipulating your files. All Adobe
applications recognize and honor security settings applied in Acrobat, but
some software ignores Adobe’s security settings or can bypass them all
together. For this reason, we recommend that you share your most sensitive
documents only when you’ve applied password security protection. This
way the only users who can open a file are those who know the password.
In this chapter, we discuss using password protection to limit access to
PDF files and show you how to limit what users can do within your PDF
documents.
Understanding Password Security
By requiring users to enter a password to open and view your PDF files, you
limit access to those files so that only certain users can view them. You can
also apply security to limit access to certain Acrobat and Adobe Reader fea-
tures, such as copying text or graphics, editing the file, and printing. Adobe
calls this type of security password security because it requires a password
to either open the document or to change the security that has been applied
to the document.

Understanding Password Security
842
Apply security options that limit the opening and editing of your PDF docu-
ment to those who supply the proper password by using the Secure button on
the Tasks toolbar. If the Secure button isn’t visible, choose View➪Toolbars➪
Tasks.
Click and hold down the Secure button in the Tasks toolbar and choose 2
Password Encrypt to bring up the Password Security – Settings dialog box.
In the Password Security – Settings dialog box, you choose an Acrobat ver-
sion from the Compatibility drop-down list. The higher the version of
Acrobat, the greater the level of security.
Your choice here is based on your needs for security and also the version of
Acrobat or Adobe Reader that your audience will be using. In the following
list, we explain the compatibility choices before showing you how to enable
security in the following sections:
✦Acrobat 3 And Later: If the users who receive your PDF files may have
older versions of the software, you can choose Acrobat 3 And Later from
the Compatibility drop-down list to ensure that they can work with the
files you provide. This option provides compatibility for users who may
not have updated their software in many years, but the level of security
is limited to 40-bit encryption. While this amount will keep the average
user from gaining access to your files, it won’t deter a determined
hacker from accessing them.
✦Acrobat 5 And Later: When sharing files with users who have access to
Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat Version 5 or 6, this option provides
expanded security, increasing the security level to 128-bit, which makes
the resulting PDF files more difficult to access. Along with the enhanced
security, you can also secure the files while still allowing access to the
file for visually impaired users. Earlier versions of security don’t provide
this option, but it’s included when you choose either Acrobat 5- or 6-
compatible security.
✦Acrobat 6 And Later: Along with the enhanced security offered with
Acrobat 5 compatibility, this setting adds the ability to maintain plain
text metadata. In short, this option allows for information about the file,
such as its author, title, or creation date, to remain visible while the
remainder of the file remains secure.
✦Acrobat 7 And Later: This choice includes all security options of
Acrobat 6 compatibility and also allows you to encrypt file attachments
that are a part of a PDF file. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard,
which is a very high level of encryption, making it unlikely that an unau-
thorized user can decrypt the file without the password.

Book VII
Chapter 6
Securing Your
PDF Files
Understanding Password Security
843
Applying password security to your PDF documents
Selecting the Require A Password To Open The Document check box in the
Password Security – Settings dialog box limits access to the PDF file to only
those who know the password. The only practical way to open password-
protected files, especially those secured with the most recent versions of
Acrobat, is by entering the password. This safeguard provides a good incen-
tive to use passwords that you can easily remember but are difficult for
others to guess.
To apply password security to a file, follow these steps:
1. With a PDF file open, click and hold the Secure button on the Security
taskbar and choose Manage Security Policies.
The Managing Security Policies window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1.
If there is no Password Encrypt policy showing in the
Name/Description/Last Edited section, then you have to create one fol-
lowing the directions in Step 2. If there is a Password Encrypt policy, you
can skip Step 2 and go to Step 3.
2. Close the Managing Security Policies window; hold the Secure button
on the Security taskbar and select 2 Password Encryption and create
your encryption policy.
After you have created your Password Encrypt policy, click and hold the
Secure Button on the Security taskbar and choose Manage Security
Policies. The Password Security – Settings window opens.
Figure 6-1:
The
Managing
Security
Policies
window.

Understanding Password Security
844
3. Click the Require A Password to open the document check box.
Enter a logical password that will be required to open the file in the
Document Open Password text field.
You can also add additional security settings, which we outline in the
next section. Or you can use this setting as the only security to be
applied to the document.
If password protection is the only security measure you apply to the
document, authorized users are able to access the document by enter-
ing a password. Users with the password are also able to edit or print
the document.
4. Click the OK button.
5. Confirm the password, click OK again, and the dialog box closes.
6. Save, close, and then reopen the PDF file.
A password dialog box appears asking for the proper password to be
entered for access to this file. Now, every time a user accesses the file,
this dialog box appears.
Limiting editing and printing
In addition to restricting viewing of a PDF file, you can also apply restrictions
to editing and printing PDF files. In doing so, you restrict users from making
changes to your document. Users are only able to view the file.
To limit editing and printing of your PDF document, follow these steps:
1. With a PDF file open, click and hold the Secure button on the Security
taskbar and choose 2 Password Encrypt.
The Password Security — Settings window opens.
2. In the Permissions area, select the check box labeled Restrict Editing
And Printing Of The Document.
Whew! This check box may win the prize for the longest name ever
placed in a software program, but it allows you to require a password to
edit the file or change the security settings.
With this option selected, you can apply a password for access to fea-
tures such as printing or editing. This password can be different than
the password used to open the document — in fact, you don’t even need
to use a document open password if you don’t want to, but it is a good
idea to use both of these passwords for sensitive data.

3. In the Change Permissions Password text field, enter a password.
4. Choose whether users are able to print the document by selecting
from the Printing Allowed drop-down list.
The choices include low resolution or high resolution.
5. To restrict editing, choose from the Changes Allowed drop-down list
(see Figure 6-2).
6. If you want, enable the last two check boxes:
• Enable Copying Of Text, Images, and Other Content: Restrict the
ability to copy and paste text and graphics into other documents by
deselecting this check box.
• Enable Text Access For Screen Reader Devices For The Visually
Impaired: When you choose Acrobat 5 or later compatibility, you
can also select this check box to allow visually impaired users to
have the PDF file read aloud to them.
7. After you’re satisfied with the settings, click OK.
By choosing Acrobat 6 and later or Acrobat 7 and later from the
Compatibility drop-down list, you can choose to Encrypt All Document
Contents Except Metadata. If you choose Acrobat 7 and later from the
Compatibility drop-down list the additional option to Encrypt Only File
Attachments (Acrobat 7 and later compatible).
