Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of my Nadymama and Papa, Julia and
Joseph Abraham, whose incredible love and time spent with their grandchil-
dren left a lasting imprint on our lives and has been a great source of strength
throughout the years. 
Their nicknames for me when I was just a child (“Monkey” and “China Doll”)
can only be attributed to some long-lost Hungarian Jewish gypsy roots in our
family, for how else could they have known so long ago that I was, indeed, born
in the Year of the Monkey, and that my life would be so deeply connected to
all things Chinese.
Author’s Acknowledgments
It all started with dinner at Woo Fong Restaurant in Bayside, Queens, where I
grew up. Although the place no longer exists, it’s the first distinct memory
I have of falling in love with China — more specifically, with spring rolls and
the little old proprietress in her golden qípáo who took me under her wing
when I was barely 4 years old. It was the beginning of a love affair with the
Chinese culture, and later with the Chinese language, which has yet to end.
My first order of thanks, therefore, goes to my mother and father for intro-
ducing me to my first Chinese meal. To my father, George, for inspiring me
with his own great love of language learning (currently centered on Egyptian
hieroglyphics) and for always pushing me to study, study, study.
To my mother, Marilyn, for her unwavering support through thick and thin and
for her reminders to relax and enjoy life in between all the studying. (No sur-
prise then that her choice of foreign language in high school was Italian.)
To my sorella, Susan, for her amazing courage and strength and for her incred-
ible talent as a sculptor, which I can only aspire to in another lifetime.
To my father’s wife, Rhoda, for her immense wisdom, great help in emergencies
of every kind, and plain old common sense.
To Michael and Daisy Fogarty, for their loyalty to the Abrahams and for the
fun they bring wherever they go.
I would also like to thank my entire extended family for reaching out to me
this past year in ways I couldn’t have imagined and will not soon forget.
Special thanks go to my aunt, Maxine Cooper, and cousin, Michael Ian, for
being there with both humor and love.

Right up there with Woo Fong Restaurant was The Inn of the Sixth Happiness —
that 1958 classic that had Ingrid Bergman, the missionary, saving all those
orphans in northern China during the Sino-Japanese War. Acknowledgments
to those who played a part in my early childhood exposure to all things Chinese
can’t be made until that film’s name has been solemnly uttered. In addition to
clinching my passion for China, it made me want to adopt a hundred orphans
from Xi’an, and it began my great love affair with the movies.
First in line for childhood recognition is my beloved aunt, Carol Rothenstein,
who regularly schlepped a gaggle of us cousins down to New York City’s
Chinatown and plied us with all manner of colorful Chinese knick-knacks to
take home.
To my childhood friend, Cynthia Sargent, who went with me on jaunts to visit
our elementary school buddy Wanda Chin at her family’s Laundry (Chin’s) on
Springfield Boulevard, where the back room doubled as home for the family
of four. I can still smell the freshly starched shirts and see the swirls of steam
wafting up from the ironing boards as we passed by on our way to the back.
From my days at Hunter College, where I distinguished myself by being the
only Jewish kid to try to join the Chinese Students Association, I’m proud to
have hung out with the likes of Jon Ho, Winnie Chin, Mon Lan Jee, Nora Lee,
Karen Lee, and our classmate Conmay, whose untimely death while we were
all undergrads bonded us for one brief but memorable moment. Jon and Winnie
in particular have remained good, loyal friends, and I’m grateful for their fun
(Jon) and calming (Winnie) presence this past year. Mention of Hunter College
in the ’70s wouldn’t be complete if it didn’t also include a serious note of
thanks to my very first Chinese language teacher, professor Yu-shih Chen,
whom we all loved.
From my Georgetown days, I would like to especially thank my best friend of
nearly three decades now, Pei Dalin, for being his wonderful self. Thanks also
to his wife, Mian, and my little talented Godchildren, Julia and Christopher.
Dalin also helped immensely with the “cultural” editing of this book; he was
on call at all hours as emergency questions popped up.
To my dear friend Wen Yang, for all his help as technical editor of this project
and for our great years at Georgetown together. Some things really do come
full circle.
I would also like to mention places of particular importance in my study of the
Chinese language. To Middlebury College, for an incredible summer intensive
language program, and to National Chengchi University in Taiwan, for giving me
the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study oracle bones from the Shang dynasty
for one whole glorious year. And especially to my former language teacher
from Nankai University in Tianjin, Professor Pang Bingjun — poet-laureate
and scholar-gentleman — who spent countless hours helping me transcribe
my taped oral histories of the Chinese Jewish descendants of Kaifeng.

To all the Chinese Jewish descendants of Kaifeng, whose lives have so deeply
touched my own and whose regional dialect I can never hope to master.
At Stanford, I’d like to thank Carl Bielefeldt, Director of the Stanford Center for
Buddhist Studies, for his compassion, patience, and understanding these last
few months and, as always, for his signature Zen sense of humor. To Rabbi Dov
Greenberg of Stanford Chabad, for his amazing ability to listen for the spoken
as well as the unspoken, for his wise counsel and keen intellect, and most of
all for his humorous common sense. To Carol Zimbelman, for her dedication
and innate decency. And to all my new friends in Palo Alto, who keep showing
me why not to give up just five minutes before the miracle happens.
For entrusting me with this project in the first place, immediate and heartfelt
thanks go to my literary agent for this book, Carol Susan Roth. Immense thanks
are also due to Project Editor Tim Gallan for his patient prodding and gentle
suggestions while making sure this book went to print, to Acquisitions Editor
Stacy Kennedy for keeping tabs on the whole process, and to the incredible
trio of Copy Editors, Josh Dials, Kristin DeMint, and Tina Sims, who made the
book come alive.
Finally, words can’t quite express my deep gratitude to Christine Huo,
Kristina Smith, and F. Marland Chancellor III for ensuring that this book
would be only the first of many to come.

Wendy Abraham is the Associate Director of the Stanford Center for Buddhist
Studies and the Asian Religions & Cultures Initiative. She has taught courses
on Chinese language, Chinese literature, and Asian cultures at Hunter College,
Georgetown University, New York University, and Stanford University, where
she’s currently pursuing her second doctorate in modern Chinese literature.
She spent a year researching Shang Dynasty oracle bones in Taiwan, which
sparked her deep interest in the development of China’s written language.
Wendy has directed Chinese language programs for American students in
Beijing and Shanghai and has interpreted for high-level arts delegations
from China. Her first doctoral dissertation from Teachers College (Columbia
University) was on the Chinese Jews of Kaifeng, a subject about which she

Introduction
G
lobalization has made familiarity with other people, cultures, and lan-
guages not only preferable in the 21st century, but also essential. With
the help of the Internet, reaching out and touching someone on the other
side of the earth has become as easy as the click of a mouse. And yet, noth-
ing quite beats the excitement of a face-to-face encounter with someone who
hails from the other side of the globe in his or her own language.
Communication in cyberspace doesn’t even come close.
Whether you’re an inveterate traveler, going overseas for business, about to
study overseas, interested in frequenting Chinatown, befriending a Chinese-
speaking classmate or coworker, or just plain curious about China, Chinese
For Dummies can help you get acquainted with enough Chinese to carry on 
a decent conversation on any number of topics. You won’t become fluent
instantly, of course, but this book helps you greet a stranger, buy a plane
ticket, and order some food. This book also gives you some invaluable cul-
tural tips so that you can not only rattle off those newly acquired words and
phrases, but also back them up with the right behavior at the right time.
I designed this book to help guide you toward the successful use of one of the
most difficult languages on earth. Chinese should also just be plain fun to learn.
About This Book
The good news is that you can use Chinese For Dummies anytime, anywhere.
No mandatory class sessions, no exams, and no homework assignments to
dread. Need to get to a new city for a business meeting? Just turn to the chap-
ter on travel to find out how to haggle for a plane ticket, determine the price,
and get to the airport on time. Have to make a sudden trip to the doctor?
Turn to the chapter on your health and figure out in advance how to tell your
caregivers exactly what ails you.
The beauty of this book is that it can be all things to all people. You don’t
have to memorize Chapter 5 before moving on to Chapter 6, if what Chapter 6
deals with is what you really need. Each chapter provides you with different
bits of information about the Chinese language and highlights different parts

of Chinese grammar. Read as much or as little as you want, as quickly or as
slowly as you like. Whatever interests you is what you should focus on. And
remember: You’re discovering a language that simultaneously represents one
of the world’s oldest civilizations and one of its fastest growing economies in
the 21st century.
Conventions Used in This Book
Pay attention to a couple of conventions that can help you navigate this
book’s contents:
 Chinese terms are set in boldface to make them stand out.
 Pronunciations and meanings appear in parentheses immediately after
the Chinese terms. The pronunciations are in italics.
This book uses the p∫ny∫n (literally: spelling the way it sounds) romanization
system of Chinese words. What does that mean? Well, if you go to China, you
see signs in Chinese characters all around, but if you look for something in
English, you may be hard pressed to find it. Whatever signs you see in roman
letters will be of p∫ny∫n, the romanization system developed by the Communists
in the 1950s, so seeing p∫ny∫n in this book is good practice for you.
Another thing you should keep in mind as you begin to understand Chinese is
that many of the English translations you see in this book aren’t exactly lit-
eral. It’s more important to know the gist of what you hear or see instead of
what individual words in any given phrase mean. For example, if you trans-
late “horse horse tiger tiger” literally into Chinese, you have the phrase
meaning “so so.” You’re not actually talking about animals. Whenever I give a
literal translation, I preface it with “literally” in italics.
The following elements you find in Chinese For Dummies help to reinforce the
new terms and phrases you’re studying:
 Talkin’ the Talk dialogues: Nothing beats seeing and hearing an actual
conversation to learn Chinese, so I intersperse dialogues throughout
this book. They come under the heading “Talkin’ the Talk.” They show
you the Chinese words, the pronunciations, and the English translations,
and I often put cultural dos and don’ts into context, which should come
in handy.
2
Chinese For Dummies 

Dialogues with a CD icon beside them appear on the CD that comes with
this book so you can practice the sentences after you hear how they
should sound. With the tonal nature of the Chinese language, this feature
is indispensable as you learn Chinese.
 Words to Know blackboards: Memorizing key words and phrases is
very useful in language learning. The words and phrases on the 
blackboard-like boxes are the ones I think are most important in the 
preceding section or sections, so they appear on a chalkboard with the
heading “Words to Know.”
 Fun & Games activities: Working through word games can be a fun way
to review the words and phrases you encounter in each chapter. This
element of Chinese For Dummies is a great way to gauge your progress
and tease your brain at the same time. Look for these activities at the
end of each chapter.
Foolish Assumptions
Some of the foolish assumptions I made about you while writing Chinese 
For Dummies are:
 You don’t know any Chinese, except for maybe a couple of words you
picked up from a good kung-fu movie or the word “tofu,” which you
picked up while grocery shopping.
 Your goal in life isn’t to become an interpreter of Chinese at the U.N.;
you just want to pick up some useful words, phrases, and sentence 
constructions to make yourself understood in a Chinese-speaking 
environment.
 You have no intention of spending hours and hours memorizing Chinese
vocabulary and grammar patterns.
 You basically want to have fun while speaking a little Chinese.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided by topic into parts, chapters, and appendixes. Each part
focuses on one aspect of the Chinese language, and the chapters cover differ-
ent useful topics, such as how to dine at a restaurant, how to handle emer-
gencies, or how to plan a vacation. The following sections tell you what types
of information you can expect to find in each part.
3
Introduction

Part I: Getting Started
This part familiarizes you with some basics of Chinese: how to pronounce
words, how to create the proper pitch (also known as tone) for each word,
and so on. Because Chinese is a tonal language, if you pronounce a word with
an incorrect tone, you may say a whole different word. Sometimes the only
way to know whether you’ve said something you didn’t intend is by the look
on the listener’s face, so you should pay particular attention to the tones as
you speak.
Part II: Chinese in Action
In this part, you really begin to use Chinese. Instead of focusing strictly on
grammar, this part helps guide you through everyday situations that you
encounter while meeting people, eating at restaurants, going shopping, or
yakking on the phone.
Part III: Chinese on the Go
This part of the book gives you the tools you need to use Chinese in any
number of practical settings. You find out how to change money, how to ask
for and give directions, how to book a room at a hotel, and how to tell a
doctor what ails you. It covers all aspects of travel into Chinese-speaking
parts of the world. Whether your travels take you all the way to Shanghai or
just to your cubicle at work is up to you.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
Ever wish you could distill the Chinese culture into 10 simple rules of what to
do and what not to do? Well, Part IV is a collection of simple phrases you can
use, popular Chinese expressions, and reminders of what not to do in a
Chinese setting that you should always keep in the back of your mind as you
interact with the Chinese. You not only sound more like a native Chinese
speaker when you open your mouth, but you also start internalizing some of
the cardinal cultural rules and taboos for social settings that the average stu-
dent of the Chinese language may never discover.

Chinese For Dummies 

Part V: Appendixes
This part contains helpful references that you may want to refer to occasion-
ally as you snoop through the rest of the chapters. Appendix A contains a
useful verb table, which can help in any setting. Appendix B is a handy mini-
dictionary of both Chinese to English and English to Chinese. Feel free to
check this section when you encounter unfamiliar words on a need-to-know
basis. Appendix C contains the answers to the Fun & Games exercises at the
end of each chapter. Finally, Appendix D provides a list of the tracks that
appear on the audio CD. This appendix comes in handy when you’re ready to
hear a selection of the Talkin’ the Talk dialogues from the book.
Icons Used in This Book
Cute little icons appear in the left-hand margins, next to sidebars, and adja-
cent to some of the introductions to the Talkin’ the Talk sections throughout
this book. These beacons shed light on what kind of information you’re look-
ing at and can help you locate certain types of information in a hurry. The six
icons used in this book are:
The bull’s-eye appears wherever I’ve highlighted a great idea to help make
your study of Chinese easier.
This icon, appropriately showing a string around a finger, should serve as a
reminder about particularly important information concerning Chinese.
The bomb should act as a stop sign in your mind. It warns you about things
to avoid saying or doing so that you don’t make a fool of yourself overseas or
with a new Chinese-speaking acquaintance.
This icon clues you in on fascinating bits of information about China and
Chinese culture. Knowledge of a culture goes hand in hand with knowledge of
a foreign language, so these icons help light the way as you embark on your
journey.

Introduction

This icon highlights various rules of grammar that may be out of the norm.
Even though this book doesn’t focus primarily on grammar, your successful
execution of the language can only be enhanced by paying attention to little
grammatical rules as they pop up.
The audio CD that comes with this book gives you the chance to hear native
Chinese speakers so you can better understand the way Chinese really
sounds. This proves especially helpful because of all the tones you have to
keep in mind. This icon indicates the basic sounds and Talkin’ the Talk dia-
logues you can find on the CD.
Where to Go from Here
Chinese is often considered one of the toughest languages in the world to
master. Don’t worry. The good news is that you’re not trying to master it. All
you want to do is be understandable when you open your mouth so that you
don’t ask for the mens’ room when you really want the ladies’ room. All you
have to do now is keep listening to and repeating the words and phrases 
you find in this book. Turn to whichever chapter piques your curiosity, listen
to the accompanying audio CD at home or in your car, and keep practicing
your favorite Chinese phrases when you’re with your family and friends in
Chinatown.

Getting Started

In this part . . .
P
art I warmly welcomes you to the Chinese language.
I give you the lowdown on all the essentials of Chinese:
how to pronounce Chinese sounds (and tones) like a native,
how to string Chinese words together so that they make
sense, how to count in Chinese, and how to communicate in
Chinese with all the cultural trimmings. Wômen k≈ishî ba!
(waw mun kye shir bah; Let’s begin!)

Chapter 1
Getting to Know a Little Chinese
In This Chapter
 Getting a handle on basic Chinese sounds
 Reading to communicate
 Sounding fluent
 Perfecting the four basic tones
 Practicing Chinese idioms
 Understanding basic Chinese phrases and gestures
T
ime to get your feet wet with the basics of Chinese. This chapter gives
you guidelines that help you pronounce words in standard Mandarin (the
official language of both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan) like a
native speaker and helps you get a handle on the four tones that distinguish
Mandarin Chinese. After you have the basics down, I show you how to con-
struct basic Chinese phrases.
But before you dive in, here’s a bit of advice: Don’t be intimidated by all the
tones! The best thing you can do when learning a foreign language is to not
worry about making mistakes the minute you open your mouth. Practice
speaking Chinese first to your dog or cat, and then work your way up to a
couple of goldfish or a niece or nephew under the age of 10. When you finally
get the nerve to rattle off a few phrases to your local Chinatown grocer, you’ll
know you’ve made it. And when you visit China for the first time, you dis-
cover how incredibly appreciative the Chinese are of anyone who even
remotely attempts to speak their language. All the hours you spent yakking
away with the family pet start to pay off, and you’ll be rewarded greatly. Still
have doubts? You’ll be amazed at how much you can say after snooping
through Chinese For Dummies.

Encountering the Chinese culture is just as important as exploring the
Chinese language. In fact, you can’t quite master the language without
absorbing a little of the culture by osmosis. Just making the effort to speak
Chinese is an act of positive diplomacy. Don’t worry about how you sound
when you open your mouth — you’re contributing to international friendship
no matter what comes out.
Grasping Chinese Dialects
Give yourself a big pat on the back right now. Yup, right now — before you
even begin to utter one iota of Chinese. If you don’t do it now, you may be too
shocked later on when it sinks in that you’ve taken on a language that has
hundreds (yes, hundreds) of dialects — each one mutually incomprehensible
to speakers of the other ones. Practically every major town, and certainly
every province, in China has its own regional dialect that folks grow up learn-
ing (see Table 1-1). Of the seven major dialects, Shanghainese, Taiwanese,
and Cantonese are the ones you may have heard of before.
And then there’s Mandarin, dialect of the masses. Mandarin Chinese is
spoken by more people on earth than any other language today. Pretty much
a quarter of humanity uses it, given China’s immense population. So just why
was this particular dialect chosen to become the official dialect taught in all
schools throughout China, regardless of whatever additional dialects people
speak at home or in their communities?
With only four tones, Gu≈nhuà (gwan hwah; Mandarin; literally: the language
of the officials, who were also known as Mandarins) has served as the hybrid
language of China since the 15th century, because it was based on the edu-
cated speech of the region around Beijing. Instead of referring to it as
Gu≈nhuà, mainlanders in China now call it Pût∂nghuà (poo toong hwah; the
common language). People in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and in overseas Chinese
communities call it Guóyû (gwaw yew; the national language). You may also
hear it referred to as Zh∂ngwén (joong one; the language of the Chinese
people) and Hànyû (hahn yew; the language of the Han people), because the
Chinese have often referred to themselves as descendants of the Han dynasty
(206 BCE to 220 CE), one of the golden eras of Chinese history. Because
Chinese is the language of ethnic Chinese and China’s minority groups, the
more all-encompassing term Zh∂ngwén is preferred.

the national language) is the term used for Mandarin in Taiwan. If you simply
say Hànyû (the language of the Han people), however, you can use it 
anywhere.
The Written Word: Yikes! No Alphabet!
I bet you’re beginning to wonder just how the Chinese have managed to com-
municate with each other for the better part of five millennia if their spoken
language comes in so many distinct forms and dialects. The answer lies in
(drum roll) . . . the written word.
11
Chapter 1: Getting to Know a Little Chinese

Say you see two Chinese people sitting next to each other on a train traveling
from Canton to Shanghai. If the Cantonese speaker reads the newspaper out
loud, the guy from Shanghai won’t have a clue what he’s saying. But if they
both read the same newspaper article to themselves, they could understand
what’s going on in the world. That’s because Chinese characters are uniform
all across the country.
Chinese words are written in beautiful, often symbolic configurations called
characters. Each character is a word in and of itself, and sometimes it’s a part
of a compound word. It makes no difference if you write the characters from
right to left, left to right, or top to bottom, because you can read and under-
stand them in any order. If you see a Chinese movie in Chinatown, you can
often choose between two types of subtitles: English, which you read from
left to right, and Chinese characters on another line, which you read from
right to left. (They can also go from left to right, so be careful.) You may go
cross-eyed for a while trying to follow them both.
During the Han dynasty, a lexicographer named Xu Shen identified six ways in
which Chinese characters reflected meanings and sounds. Of these, four were
the most common:
 Pictographs: These characters are formed according to the shape of the
objects themselves, such as the sun and the moon. They show the mean-
ing of the character rather than the sound.
 Ideographs: These characters represent more abstract concepts. The
characters for “above” and “below,” for example, each have a horizontal
line representing the horizon and another stroke leading out above or
below the horizon.
 Complex ideographs: Combinations of simpler characters.
 Phonetic compounds: Also called logographs, these compound charac-
ters are formed by two graphic elements — one hinting at the meaning
of the word and the other providing a clue to the sound. Phonetic com-
pounds account for over 80 percent of all Chinese characters. 
12
Part I: Getting Started 
Early bare-bones Chinese writing
The earliest specimens of Chinese writing
appeared on oracle bones, dating from China’s
first archaeologically proven dynasty, the Shang
(circa 1766 to 1122 BCE). Written on ox scapu-
lae or tortoise shells, the writing was used for
divination purposes by shamans who asked
questions on behalf of the king. Only about a
thousand or so characters have been identified
on oracle bones, but the findings show that 
the written language had already attained a
solid foundation in China by the second millen-
nium, BCE.

No matter which type of characters you see, you won’t find any letters string-
ing them together like you see in English. So how in the world do Chinese
people consult a Chinese dictionary? (How did you know I could read your
mind?) In several different ways.
Because Chinese characters are composed of several (often many) strokes of
the writing brush, one way to look up a character is by counting the number
of strokes and then looking up the character under the portion of the diction-
ary that notes characters by strokes. But to do so, you have to know which
radical to check under first. Chinese characters have 214 radicals — parts of
the character that can help identify what the character may signify, such as
three dots on the left hand side of the character representing water. Each rad-
ical is itself composed of a certain number of strokes, so you have to first
look up the radical by the number of strokes it takes to write it, and after you
locate that radical, you start looking once more under the number of strokes
left in the character after that radical to locate the character you wanted to
look up in the first place.
You can always just check under the pronunciation of the character (if you
already know how to pronounce it), but you have to sift through every single
character with the same pronunciation. You also have to look further under
the various tones to see which one of all the words pronounced the same
way comes with the first, second, third, or fourth tone you want to locate.
And because there are so many homonyms in Chinese, this task isn’t as easy
as it may sound (no pun intended).
I bet you feel really relieved that you’re only focusing on spoken Chinese and
not the written language.
Pinyin Spelling: Beijing, Not Peking
To spell the way it sounds . . . that’s the literal meaning of p∫ny∫n. For decades,
Chinese had been transliterated in any number of ways. Finally, in 1979, the
People’s Republic of China officially adopted p∫ny∫n as its official romanization
system. After the adoption, U.S. libraries and government agencies diligently
changed all their prior records from other romanization systems into p∫ny∫n.
You should keep in mind the following quick facts about some of the initial
sounds in Mandarin when you see them written in the relatively new p∫ny∫n
system:
 J: Sounds like the “g” in “gee whiz.” An “i” often follows a “j.” “Jî kuài
qián?” (jee kwye chyan) means “How much money?”
 Q: Sounds like the “ch” in “cheek.” You never see it followed by a “u” like
in English, but an “i” always follows it in Chinese, possibly before
another vowel or a consonant. Q∫ngdâo (cheeng daow) beer used to be
spelled “ch’ing tao” or “Tsingtao.”
13
Chapter 1: Getting to Know a Little Chinese

 X: The third letter that’s often followed by an “i.” It sounds like the “sh”
in “she.” One famous Chinese leader, Dèng Xiâopíng (dung shyaow
peeng), boasted this letter in his name.
 Zh: Unlike “j,” which often precedes a vowel to make it sound like you’re
opening your mouth, “zh” is followed by vowels, which make it sound
like your mouth is a bit more closed. Take Zh∂u Enlái (joe un lye), for
example, the great statesman of 20th-century China. When you say his
name, it should sound like Joe En-lye.
 Z: Sounds like a “dz.” You see it in the name of the PRC’s first leader, Máo
Zéd∂ng (maow dzuh doong), which used to be spelled Mao Tse-tung.
 C: Pronounced like “ts” in such words as cài (tsye; food) or cèsuô (tsuh
swaw; bathroom).
 B, D, and G: In the past, the sounds made by these three letters were
represented by P, T, and K, respectively. In the past, if the corresponding
initial sounds were aspirated (had air coming out of the speaker, like in
the words “pie,” “tie,” and “kite”), they would’ve been written as “p’,”
“t’,” and “k’.” Today, the letters “P,” “T,” and “K” represent the aspirated
sounds.
Sounding Off: Basic Chinese Sounds
Don’t worry about sounding like a native speaker the first time you utter a
Chinese syllable — after all, who does? But the longer you procrastinate
becoming familiar with the basic elements of Chinese words, the greater your
fear of this unique language may become. After you begin to practice the
sounds (and eventually the tones) out loud, you may wonder if you’ll ever
come close to sounding like Bruce Lee in a kung-fu movie or even your local
Chinatown grocer. Hearing Chinese spoken at a normal speed is definitely
intimidating at the beginning, so you should enjoy taking plenty of baby steps
and reveling in the praise from waiters who appreciate all your effort the next
time you frequent a Chinese restaurant.
The main thing to remember about the Chinese language is that each mor-
pheme (the smallest unit of meaning in a language) is represented by one syl-
lable, which in turn consists of an initial sound and a final sound, topped off
by a tone. This applies to each and every syllable. Without any one of these
three components, your words may be incomprehensible to the average
Chinese person. For example, the syllable “m≈” is comprised of the initial “m”
and the final “a,” and you pronounce it with what’s called a first tone.
Together, the parts mean “mother.” If you substitute the first tone for a third
tone, which is written as “mâ,” you say the word “horse.” So be careful not to
call your mother a horse when you practice the initials, finals, and tones. The
following sections break up the three parts and give each their due.
14
Part I: Getting Started 

Before you can participate in sports or play games, you must become familiar
with all the rules. The same goes for practicing a new language. Do your best
to understand the basic rules of pronunciation, and keep practicing over and
over to begin feeling comfortable speaking the language.
Starting off with initials
In Chinese, initials always consist of consonants. Table 1-2 lists the initials
you encounter in the Chinese language.

Ending with finals
Chinese boasts many more consonants than vowels. In fact, the language has
only six vowels all together: a, o, e, i, u, and ü. If you pronounce the vowels
in sequence, your mouth starts off very wide and your tongue starts off very
low. Eventually, when you get to ü, your mouth becomes much more closed
and your tongue ends pretty high. You can also combine the vowels in vari-
ous ways to form compound vowels. Table 1-3 lists the vowels and some pos-
sible combinations.

Chapter 1: Getting to Know a Little Chinese

Tone marks in p∫ny∫n always appear above the vowel, but if you see a couple
of vowels in a row, the tone mark appears above the first vowel in that
sequence. One exception is when you see the vowels iu and ui together. In
that case, the tone mark falls on the second vowel.
Sometimes vowels appear without initial consonant accompaniment, but
they still mean something. The word âi, meaning “short” (of stature), is one
example.
Perfect pitch: Presenting . . . 
the four tones
Mee meeeee (cough cough)! Pardon me. I’m getting carried away with warm-
ing up before I get into the four tones. Just think of the tones this way: They
can be your best friends when it comes to being understood in Chinese, and
they’re the hip part of this ancient language.
If you combine all the possible initial sounds of Chinese with all the possible
permutations of the final sounds, you come up with only about 400 sound
combinations — not nearly enough to express all the ideas in your head. If
you add the four basic tones of Mandarin to the mix, the number of possible
permutations increases fourfold. Tones are also a great way to reduce the
number of homophones in Chinese. Even so, any given syllable with a spe-
cific tone can often have more than one meaning. Sometimes the only way to
decipher the intended meaning is to see the written word.
Mandarin has only four tones. The best way to imagine what each of the four
tones sounds like is to visualize these short descriptions:
 First tone: High level. The first tone is supposed to be as high as your
individual pitch range can be, without wavering. It appears like this
above the letter a: ≈.
 Second tone: Rising. The second tone sounds like you’re asking a ques-
tion. It goes from the middle level of your voice to the top. It doesn’t
automatically indicate that you’re asking a question, however — it just
sounds like you are. It appears like this above the letter a: á.
 Third tone: Falling and then rising. The third tone starts in the middle
level of your voice range and then falls deeply before slightly rising at
the end. It looks like this above the letter a: â.
 Fourth tone: Falling. The fourth tone sounds like you’re giving someone
an order (unlike the more plaintive-sounding second tone). It falls from
the high pitch level it starts at. Here’s how it looks above the letter a: à.

Here’s something interesting about tones: When you have to say one third
tone followed by another third tone out loud in consecutive fashion, the first
one actually becomes a second tone. If you hear someone say “T≈hên hâo”
(tah hun how; she’s very well), you may not realize that both “hên” and “hâo”
individually are third tone syllables. It sounds like “hén” is a second tone and
“hâo” is a full third tone.
Half-third tones
Whenever a third tone is followed by any of the other tones — first, second,
fourth, or even a neutral tone — it becomes a half-third tone. You only pro-
nounce the first half of the tone — the falling half — before you pronounce
the other syllables with the other tones. In fact, a half-third tone barely falls
at all. It sounds more like a level, low tone (kind of the opposite of the high
level first tone). Get it?
Neutral tones
A fifth tone exists that you can’t exactly count amongst the four basic tones,
because it’s actually toneless, or neutral. You never see a tone mark over a
fifth tone, and you say it only when you attach it to grammatical particles or
the second character of repetitive syllables, such as bàba (bah bah; father)
or m≈ma (mah mah; mother).
Tonal changes in y∫and bù
Just when you think you’re getting a handle on all the possible tones and
tone changes in Chinese, I have one more aspect to report: The words y∫
(ee; one) and bù (boo; not or no) are truly unusual in Chinese, in that their
tones may change automatically depending on what comes after them. You
pronounce y∫by itself with the first tone. However, when a first, second, or
third tone follows it, y∫instantly turns into a fourth tone, such as in yìzh≈ng
zhî (ee jahng jir; a piece of paper). If a fourth tone follows y∫, however, it auto-
matically becomes a second tone, such as in the word yíyàng (ee yahng; the
same). I know this all sounds very complicated, but when you get the hang of
tones, pronunciation becomes second nature. Just keep listening to the
accompanying CD. These concepts will sink in quicker than you expect.
Adding Idioms and Popular Expressions
to Your Repertoire
Even though Chinese seems like it has absolutely nothing in common with
English when you listen to it, especially in terms of pronunciation and tones,
it uses distinctive idioms (groups of words whose collective meanings differ
19
Chapter 1: Getting to Know a Little Chinese

from their individual parts) to express specific ideas or situations, just like in
English. If you try to translate these idioms word for word, however, you
won’t get very far.
For example, if you suddenly announced to your Chinese college roommate
“Wô huì l≈yíge quán yèg√” (waw hway lah ee guh chwan yeh guh; literally:
I’m going to pull an all-nighter), he would be clueless and would begin to
question what he was thinking when he agreed to room with a foreigner.
Similarly, you’d be just as confused if he broke out with “Wô huì k≈i yè ch√.”
(waw hway kye yeh chuh; literally: I’m going to ride the night train.) Both of
you mean the same thing, of course, but he’d start imagining just how heavy
something called an all-nighter is to actually pull, and you’d worry about
which city he’s going to end up in the next morning. You may even be
tempted to join him instead of studying for your exam.
The Chinese language has thousands of idiomatic expressions known as
chéngyû (chung yew). Most of these chéngyû originated in anecdotes, fables,
fairy tales, or ancient literary works, and some of the expressions are thou-
sands of years old. The vast majority consist of four characters, succinctly
expressing morals behind very long, ancient stories. Others are more than
four characters. Either way, the Chinese pepper these pithy expressions
throughout any given conversation.
Here are a few chéngyû you frequently hear in Chinese:
 Mò míng qí miào. (maw meeng chee meow; literally: No one can explain
the wonder and mystery of it all.) This saying describes anything that’s
tough to figure out, including unusual behavior.
 Yî sh√n zuò zé. (ee shun dzwaw dzuh; To set a good example.)
 Yì mó yí yàng. (ee maw ee yahng; exactly alike)
 Quán x∫n quán yì. (chwan sheen chwan ee; literally: entire heart,
entire mind)
 Àn bù jiù b≈n. (ahn boo jyoe bahn; To take one step at a time.)
 Hú shu∂b≈dào. (hoo shwaw bah daow; literally: To talk nonsense in
eight directions.) To talk nonsense.
 Huô shàng ji≈yóu. (hwaw shahng jyah yo; To add fuel to the fire; to
aggravate the problem.)
 Yì zh√n jiàn xiê. (ee jun jyan shyeh; To hit the nail on the head.)
 Yì jû liâng dé. (ee jyew lyahng duh; To kill two birds with one stone.)
 Rù xi≈ng suí sú. (roo shyahng sway soo; When in Rome, do as the
Romans do.)
Another fact you quickly become aware of when you start speaking with
chéngyû is that the expressions are sometimes full of references to animals.
Here are some of those:
20

 gôu zhàng rén shì (go jahng run shir; literally: the dog acts fierce when
his master is present; to take advantage of one’s connections with pow-
erful people)
 guà yáng tóu mài gôu ròu (gwah yahng toe my go roe; literally: to display
a lamb’s head but sell dog meat; to cheat others with false claims)
 dâ câo j∫ng shé (dah tsaow jeeng shuh; literally: to beat the grass to
frighten the snake; to give a warning)
 duì niú tán qín (dway nyo tahn cheen; literally: to play music to a cow; to
cast pearls before swine)
 xuán yá lè mâ (shywan yah luh mah; literally: to rein in the horse before
it goes over the edge; to halt)
 huà shé ti≈n zú (hwah shuh tyan dzoo; literally: to pain a snake and add
legs; to gild the lily; to do something superfluous)
 hû tóu shé wêi (hoo toe shuh way; literally: with the head of a tiger but
the tail of a snake; to start strong but end poorly)
 ch√shuî mâ lóng (chuh shway mah loong; literally: cars flowing like water
and horses creating a solid line looking like a dragon; heavy traffic)
Mastering Basic Phrases
If you make it a habit to use the following short Chinese phrases whenever
you get the chance, you can master them in no time. You’ll also shock every-
one around you — especially if they don’t speak Chinese. It doesn’t matter.
You know what you’re saying, at least. So the next time you meet up with a
Chinese waiter or take your clothes to a Chinese laundry down the block, you
can impress the heck out of everyone. Try these phrases:
 Nî hâo! (nee how; Hi; How are you?)
 Xièxiè. (shyeh shyeh; Thank you.)
 Bú kèqì. (boo kuh chee; You’re welcome; Don’t mention it.)
 Méi shì. (may shir; It’s nothing; Don’t mention it.)
 Hâo jíle. (how jee luh; Great; Fantastic.)
 Duì le. (dway luh; That’s right.)
 G∂ngxî g∂ngxî! (goong she goong she; Congratulations!)
 Duìbuqî. (dway boo chee; Excuse me.)
 Suàn le. (swan luh; Forget it; Nevermind.)
 Méiyôu gu≈nxi. (mayo gwan she; It doesn’t matter.)
 Dêng yíxià. (dung ee shyah; Wait a minute.)

Communicating with body language
Ever think you know what certain couples are
saying or thinking just by observing their ges-
tures and body language? Well, people can
make the same observations in China. Although
the gestures are different, they contain impor-
tant clues as to social status between people,
their emotions, and so on. Observe Chinese
people wherever you can to see if you notice
any of the following gestures:
 Pointing to one’s own nose: You may find
this hard to believe, but Chinese people
often point to their own noses, often touch-
ing them, when they refer to themselves by
saying the word “wô” (waw; I). The Chinese
are probably just as curious as to why
Westerners point to their hearts.
 Nodding and bowing slightly: When greet-
ing older people, professors, or others in
positions of power or prestige, people lower
their heads slightly to acknowledge them
and show respect. Unlike the Japanese,
who bow deeply, the Chinese basically bow
with their heads in a slight fashion.
 Shaking hands: People of vastly different
status generally don’t give each other a
handshake, but it’s common among friends
and business colleagues.
 Bowing with hands clasped: If you see
hand clasping and bowing going on at the
same time, you know the participants have
something to celebrate. It indicates con-
veying congratulations or greeting others
during special festival occasions. Their
hands are held at chest level and their
heads are slightly bowed (and they often
have big smiles on their faces).

Grammar and Numbers
In This Chapter

M
aybe you’re one of those people who cringe at the mere mention of the
word grammar. Just the thought of all those rules on how to construct
sentences can put you into a cold sweat.
Hey, don’t sweat it! This chapter could just as easily be called “Chinese with-
out Tears.” It gives you some quick and easy shortcuts on how to combine
the basic building blocks of Chinese (which, by the way, are the same compo-
nents that make up English) — nouns to name things, adjectives to qualify
the nouns, verbs to show action or passive states of being, and adverbs to
describe the verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. After you know how to com-
bine these parts of any given sentence, you’ll be able to express your ideas
and interests spanning the past, present, and future.
When you speak English, I bet you don’t sit and analyze the word order
before opening your mouth to say something. Well, the same can hold true
when you begin speaking Chinese. You probably didn’t even know the word
for grammar before someone taught you that it was the framework for analyz-
ing the structure of a language. Instead of overwhelming you, this chapter
makes understanding Chinese grammar as easy as punch.
If you be patient with yourself, have fun following the dialogues illustrat-
ing basic sentences, and listen to them on the accompanying CD, you’ll
do just fine. 

The Basics of Chinese Parts of Speech
Admit it. Most of us took the better part of our first two years of life to master
the basics when it came to forming English sentences. With this book, you
can whittle this same skill in Chinese down to just a few minutes. Just keep
reading this chapter. I promise it will save you a lot of time in the long run.
The basic word order of Chinese is exactly the same as in English. Hard to
imagine? Just think of it this way: When you say “I love spinach,” you’re using
the subject (I), verb (love), object (spinach) sentence order. It’s the same in
Chinese. Only in Beijing, it sounds more like Wô xîhu≈n b∂cài (waw she
hwahn baw tsye).
And if that isn’t enough to endear you to Chinese already, maybe these tidbits
of information will:
 You don’t need to conjugate verbs.
 You don’t need to master verb tenses. (Don’t you just love it already?)
 You don’t need to distinguish between singular and plural nouns.
 There’s no such thing as gender-specific nouns.
 The same word can be both the subject and the object.
How could such news not warm the hearts of all those who’ve had grammar-
phobia since grade school? The way you can tell how one part of a Chinese
sentence relates to another is generally by the use of particles and what form
the word order takes. (Particles, for those of you presently scratching your
heads, can be found at the beginning or end of sentences and serve mainly to
distinguish different types of emphatic statements but can’t be translated in
and of themselves.)
Some interesting characteristics of the Chinese language include the fact that
there’s no such thing as first, second, or third person (for example, “I eat”
versus “he eats”); no such thing as active or passive voices (for example,
“hear” versus “be heard”); and no such thing as past or present (“I like him”
versus “I liked him”). In addition, Chinese language has only two aspects —
complete and continuous — whereas English has all sorts of different aspects:
indefinite, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous, and so on. (Examples
include ways of distinguishing between “I eat,” “I ate,” “I will eat,” “I said I
would eat,” “I am eating,” and so on.) Aspects are what characterize the
Chinese language in place of tenses. They refer to how a speaker views an
event or state of being.

Part I: Getting Started 

Nouns
Chinese is just chock-full of nouns:
 Common nouns that represent tangible things, such as háizi (hi dzuh;
child) or yè (yeh; leaf)
 Proper nouns for such things as names of countries or people, like
Fâguó (fah gwaw; France) and Zh≈ng Xi≈nsh√ng (jahng shyan shung;
Mr. Zhang)
 Material nouns for such nondiscrete things as k≈f√i (kah fay; coffee)
or j∫n (jin; gold)
 Abstract nouns for such things as zhèngzhì (juhng jir; politics) or
wénhuà (one hwah; culture)
Pronouns
Pronouns are easy to make plural in Chinese. Here’s what you need to know:
Just add the plural suffix -men to the three basic pronouns:
 Wô (waw; I/me) becomes wômen (waw mun; we/us).
 Nî (nee; you) becomes nîmen (nee mun; you [plural]).
 T≈(tah; he/him, she/her, it) becomes t≈men (tah mun; they/them).
Sometimes instead of the term wômen for “us,” you hear the term zánmen
(dzah mun). This word is used in very familiar settings when the speaker
wants to include the listener in an action, like when you say Zánmen zôu ba
(dzah mun dzoe bah; let’s go).
When speaking to an elder or someone you don’t know too well and the
person is someone to whom you should show respect, you need to use the
pronoun nín (neen) instead of the more informal nî (nee). On the other hand,
if you’re speaking to several people who fit that description, the plural
remains nîmen (nee men).
Classifiers
Classifiers are sometimes called measure words, even though they don’t
really measure anything. They actually help classify particular nouns. For
example, the classifier bên (bun) can refer to books, magazines, dictionaries,
and just about anything else that’s printed and bound like a book. You might
hear Wô yào yìbên sh∆(waw yaow ee bun shoo; I want a book) just as easily
as you hear Wô yào kàn yìbên zázhì (waw yaow kahn ee bun dzah jir; I want
to read a magazine).
27
Chapter 2: The Nitty Gritty: Basic Chinese Grammar and Numbers

Classifiers are found in between a number (or a demonstrative pronoun such
as “this” or “that”) and a noun. They’re similar to English words such as
“herd” (of elephants) or “school” (of fish). Although English doesn’t use clas-
sifiers too often, in Chinese you find them wherever a number is followed by
a noun, or at least an implied noun (such as “I’ll have another one,” referring
to a cup of coffee, for example).
Because you have so many potential classifiers to choose from in Chinese,
the general rule of thumb is: When in doubt, use ge (guh). It’s the all-purpose
classifier and the one used the most in the Chinese language. You usually can’t
go wrong by using ge. If you’re tempted to leave a classifier out altogether
because you’re not sure which one is the right one, don’t give in to the temp-
tation! You may not be understood at all. 
Chinese has lots of different classifiers because they’re each used to refer to
different types of things. For example, Table 2-1 lists classifiers for natural
objects. Here are some other examples:
 g√n (gun): Used for anything looking like a stick, such as a string or even
a blade of grass
 zh≈ng (jahng): Used for anything with a flat surface, such as a newspa-
per, table, or bed
 k√(kuh): Used for anything round and tiny, such as a pearl

dwaw
flowers
k√
kuh
trees
lì
lee
grain (of rice, sand, and so on)
zh∫

zuò

Whenever you have a pair of anything, you can use the classifier shu≈ng
(shwahng). That goes for yì shu≈ng kuàizi (ee shwahng kwye dzuh; a pair of
chopsticks) as well as for yì shu≈ng shôu (ee shwahng show; a pair of hands).
Sometimes a pair is indicated by the classifier duì (dway), as in yí duì êrhuán
(ee dway are hwahn; a pair of earrings).
28
Part I: Getting Started 

Singular and plural: It’s a nonissue
Chinese makes no distinction between singular and plural. If you say the
word sh∆(shoo), it could mean “book” just as easily as “books.” The only
way you know whether it’s singular or plural is if a number followed by a clas-
sifier precedes the word sh∆, as in Wô yôu s≈n bên sh∆(waw yo sahn bun
shoo; I have three books).
One way to indicate plurality after personal pronouns wô (waw; I), nî (nee;
you), and t≈(tah; he, she, or it) and human nouns such as háizi (hi dzuh;
child) or xuésh√ng (shweh shuhng; student) is by adding the suffix -men at
the end. It acts as the equivalent of adding an “s” to nouns in English.
Talkin’ the Talk
Susan and Michael are looking at a beautiful field.
Susan:
Zhèr de f√ngjîng zh√n piàoliàng!

this flower is also really unique.
Michael:
Nà k√shù shàng yê yôu s≈n zh∫niâo.
Nah kuh shoe lee yeah yo sahn jir nyaow.
That tree also has three birds in it.
If a number and a measure word already appear in front of a pronoun or
human noun, such as s≈n ge háizi (sahn guh hi dzuh; three children), don’t
add the suffix –men after háizi because plurality is already understood.
29
Chapter 2: The Nitty Gritty: Basic Chinese Grammar and Numbers

Never attach the suffix -men to anything not human. People will think you’re
nuts if you start referring to your two pet cats as wôde xiâo m≈omen (waw
duh shyaow maow mun). Just say Wôde xiâo m≈o hên hâo, xiè xiè (waw duh
shyaow maow hun how, shyeh shyeh; My cats are fine, thank you), and that
should do the trick.
Definite versus indefinite articles
If you’re looking for those little words in Chinese you can’t seem to do with-
out in English, such as “a,” “an,” and “the” — articles, as grammarians call
them — you’ll find they simply don’t exist in Chinese. The only way you can
tell if something is being referred to specifically (hence, considered definite)
or just generally (and therefore, indefinite) is by the word order. Nouns that
refer specifically to something are usually found at the beginning of the sen-
tence, before the verb:
 Sh∆zài nàr. (shoo dzye nar; The book(s) are there.)
 Háizimen xîhu≈n t≈. (hi dzuh mun she hwahn tah; The children like her.)
 Pánzi zài zhu∂zishàng. (pahn dzuh dzye jwaw dzuh shahng; There’s a
plate on the table.)
Nouns that refer to something more general (and are therefore “indefinite”)
can more often be found at the end of the sentence, after the verb:
 Nâr yôu hu≈? (nar yo hwah; Where are some flowers; Where is there a
flower?)
 Nàr yôu hu≈. (nar yo hwah; There are some flowers over there; There’s a
flower over there.)
 Zhèige yôu wèntí. (jay guh yo one tee; There’s a problem with this;
There are some problems with this.)
There are some exceptions to these rules: If you find a noun at the beginning
of a sentence, it may actually refer to something indefinite if the sentence
makes a general comment (instead of telling a whole story), like when you
see the verb shì (shir; to be) as part of the comment:
Xióngm≈o shì dòngwù. (shyoong maow shir doong woo; Pandas are
animals.)
Same thing goes if an adjective comes after the noun, such as
Pútáo hên tián. (poo taow hun tyan; Grapes are very sweet.)
30
Part I: Getting Started 

Or if there’s an auxiliary verb:
Xiâo m≈o huì zhu≈lâoshû. (shyaow maow hway jwah laow shoo; Kittens
can catch mice.)
Or a verb indicating that the action occurs habitually:
Niú ch∫câo. (nyo chir tsaow; Cows eat grass.)
Nouns that are preceded by a numeral and a classifier, especially when the
word d∂u (doe; all) exists in the same breath, are also considered definite:
Sìge xuésh√ng d∂u hên c∂ngmíng. (suh guh shweh shung doe hun tsoong
meeng; The four students are all very smart.)
If the word yôu (yo; to exist) comes before the noun and is then followed by a
verb, it can also mean the reference is indefinite:
Yôu sh∆zài zhu∂zishàng. (yo shoo dzye jwaw dzuh shahng; There are
books on top of the table.)
If you see the word zhè (juh; this) or nà (nah; that), plus a classifier used
when a noun comes after the verb, it indicates a definite reference:
Wô yào mâi nà zh≈ng huà. (waw yaow my nah jahng hwah; I want to buy
that painting.)
Adjectives
As you learned in grade school (you were paying close attention, weren’t
you?), adjectives describe nouns. The question is where to put them. The
general rule of thumb in Chinese is, if the adjective is pronounced with only
one syllable, it appears immediately in front of the noun it qualifies:
 lf chá (lyew chah; green tea)
 cháng zh∫tiáo (chahng jir tyaow; long stick)
If the adjective has two syllables, though, the possessive particle de (duh)
comes between it and whatever it qualifies:
 g≈njìng de y∫fu (gahn jeeng duh ee foo; clean clothes)
 c≈ozá de wânhuì (tsaow dzah duh wahn hway; noisy party)
31
Chapter 2: The Nitty Gritty: Basic Chinese Grammar and Numbers

And if a numeral is followed by a classifier, those should both go in front of
the adjective and what it qualifies:
 yí jiàn x∫n y∫fu (ee jyan shin ee foo; a [piece of] new clothing)
 s≈n bên yôuyìs∫de sh∆(sahn bun yo ee suh duh shoo; three interesting
books)
One unique thing about Chinese is that when an adjective is also the predi-
cate, appearing at the end of a sentence, it follows the subject or the topic
without needing the verb shì (shir; to be):
 T≈de fángzi hên g≈njìng. (tah duh fahng dzuh hun gahn jeeng; His house
[is] very clean.)
 Nà jiàn y∫fu tài jiù. (nah jyan ee foo tye jyoe; That piece of clothing [is]
too old.)
Verbs
Good news! You never have to worry about conjugating a Chinese verb in
your entire life! If you hear someone say T≈men ch∫Yìdàlì fàn (tah men chir
ee dah lee fahn), it could mean “They eat Italian food” just as easily as it
could mean “They are eating Italian food.” Table 2-2 lists some common
verbs.

Part I: Getting Started 

To be or not to be: The verb shì
Does the Chinese verb shì (shir) really mean “to be”? Or is it not to be? It is
indeed similar to English in usage because it’s often followed by a noun that
defines the topic, such as T≈shì wôde lâobân (tah shir waw duh laow bahn;
He’s my boss) or Nà shì y∫jf huài huà (nah shir ee guh hwye hwah; That’s a
bad word).
Be careful not to put the verb shì in front of an adjective unless you really
mean to make an emphatic statement. In the course of normal conversation,
you might say Nà zh∫bî tài guì (nah jir bee tye gway; That pen [is] too expen-
sive). You wouldn’t say Nà zh∫bî shì tài guì (nah jir bee shir tye gway) unless
you really want to say “That pen IS too expensive!” in which case you’d
emphasize the word shì when saying it.
To negate the verb shì, put the negative prefix bù in front of it. “Shì bú shì?”
(shir boo shir; Is it or isn’t it?) “Zhè bú shì táng cù yú” (jay boo shir tahng tsoo
yew; This isn’t sweet and sour fish).
Feeling tense? Le, guò, and other aspect markers
Okay, you can relax now. There’s nothing to get tense about with Chinese
because verbs don’t indicate tenses all by themselves. That’s the job of aspect
markers. Those are little syllables that indicate whether an action has been
completed, is continuing, has just begun, and just about everything in between.
Take the syllable le (luh), for example. It can indicate an action has been
completed if it’s used as a suffix to a verb:
 Nî mâi le hên du∂sh∆. (nee my luh hun dwaw shoo; You bought many
books.)
 T≈dài le t≈de yûsân. (tah dye luh tah duh yew sahn; He brought his
umbrella.)
And if you want to turn it into a question, just add méiyôu at the end. It auto-
matically negates the action completed by le:
 Nî mâi le hên du∂sh∆méiyôu? (nee my luh hun dwaw shoo mayo; Have
you bought many books; Did you buy many books?)
 T≈dài le t≈de yûsân méiyôu? (tah dye luh tah duh yew sahn mayo; Did
he bring his umbrella?)
There’s also guò (gwaw). It basically means that something has been done at
one point or another even though it’s not happening right now:
 T≈qù guò Mêiguó. (ta chyew gwaw may gwaw; He has been to America.)
 Wômen ch∫guò Fâguó cài. (waw mun chir gwaw fah gwaw tsye; We have
eaten French food before.)
33
Chapter 2: The Nitty Gritty: Basic Chinese Grammar and Numbers

If an action is happening just as you speak, you use the aspect marker zài
(dzye):
 Wômen zài ch∫fàn. (waw mun dzye chir fahn; We are eating.)
 Nî m≈ma zài zuòfàn. (nee mah mah dzye dzwaw fahn; Your mother is
cooking.)
When using the aspect marker zài, you can also add the word zhèng (juhng)
in front of it to add emphasis. It can be translated as “to be right in the
middle of” doing something.
If something is or was happening continually and resulted from something
else you did, just add the syllable zhe (juh) to the end of the verb to say
things like
 T≈dài zhe yíge huáng màozi. (tah dye juh ee guh hwahng maow dzuh;
He’s wearing a yellow hat.)
 Nî chu≈n zhè yí jiàn piàoliàng de chènsh≈n. (nee chwan juh ee jyan
pyaow lyahng duh ee foo; You’re wearing a pretty shirt.)
Another way you can use zhe is when you want to indicate two actions occur-
ring at the same time:
T≈zuò zhe ch∫fàn. (tah dzwaw juh chir fahn; She is/was sitting there
eating.)

The special verb: Yôu (to have)
Do you yôu (yo) a computer? No?! Too bad. Everyone else seems to have one
these days. How about a Ferrari? Do you yôu one of those? If not, welcome to
the club. People who have lots of things use the word yôu pretty often. It
means “to have”:
 Wô yôu yí wàn kuài qián. (waw yo ee wahn kwye chyan; I have $10,000.)
 Wô yôu s≈nge fángzi — yíge zài ≥uzh∂u, yíge zài Yàzh∂u, yíge zài
Mêiguó. (waw yo sahn guh fahng dzuh — ee guh dzye oh joe, ee guh dzye
yah joe, ee guh dzye may gwaw; I have three homes — one in Europe,
one in Asia, and one in America.)
Another way yôu can be translated is “there is” or “there are”:
 Yôu hên du∂háizi (yo hun dwaw hi dzuh; There are many children), as
opposed to Wô yôu hên du∂háizi. (waw yo hun dwaw hi dzuh; I have
many children.)
 Sh∆zhu∂shàng yôu wû zh≈ng zhî. (shoo jwaw shahng yo woo jahng jir;
There are five pieces of paper on the desk.)

To negate the verb yôu, you can’t use the usual negative prefix bù. Instead,
you must use another term indicating negation, méi:
 Méiyôu hên du∂háizi. (mayo hun dwaw hi dzuh; There aren’t many
children.)
 Sh∆zhu∂shàng méiyôu wû zh≈ng zhî. (shoe jwaw shahng may yo woo

Asking for what you want: The verb yào
Ever since the 7-foot-6-inch basketball superstar from China, Yao Ming, came
on the scene, the verb yào has gotten some great advance publicity in the
United States. The character for his name isn’t written quite the same as the
verb “yào,” but at least everyone knows how to pronounce it already: yow!
Yào is one of the coolest verbs in Chinese. When you say it, you usually get
what you want. In fact, the mere mention of the word yào means that you
want something:
 Wô yào yí b√i k≈f√i. (waw yaow ee bay kah fay; I want a cup of coffee.)
 Wô yào g√n nî yìqî qù kàn diànyîng. (waw yaow gun nee ee chee chyew
kahn dyan yeeng; I want to go to the movies with you.)
You can also give someone an order with the verb yào, but only if it’s used
with a second-person pronoun:
 Nî yào xiâox∫n! (nee yaow shyaow sheen; You should be careful!)
 Nî yào xî shôu. (nee yaow she show; You need to wash your hands.)
Adverbs
Adverbs serve to modify verbs or adjectives and always appear in front of
them. The most common ones you find in Chinese are hên (hun; very) and yê
(yeah; also).

If you want to say that something is not just hâo (how; good), but that it’s
very good, you say it’s hên hâo (hun how; very good). If your friend wants to
put his two cents in and say that something else is also really good, he says
“Zhèige yê hên hâo” (jay guh yeah hun how; This is also very good) because
yê always comes before hên.
The adverb yê always comes not only before the adverb hên but also before
the negative prefix bù.
Bù and méiyôu: Total negation
Boo! Scare you? Don’t worry. I’m just being negative in Chinese. That’s right,
the word bù is pronounced the same way a ghost might say it (boo) and is
often spoken with the same intensity. 
Bù can negate something you’ve done in the past or the present (or at least
indicate you don’t generally do it these days), and it can also help negate
something in the future:
 T≈xiâo de shíhòu bù xîhu≈n ch∫sh∆cài. (tah shyaow duh shir ho boo
she hwahn chir shoo tsye; When he was young he didn’t like to eat
vegetables.)
 Wô búyào chàng g√. (waw boo yaow chahng guh; I don’t want to sing.)
 Wô bú huà huàr. (waw boo hwah hwar; I don’t paint.)
 Diànyîngyuàn x∫ngq∫liù bù k≈imén. (dyan yeeng ywan sheeng chee lyo
boo kye mun; The movie theatre won’t be open on Saturday.)
The negative prefix bù is usually spoken with a fourth (falling) tone. However,
when it precedes a syllable with another fourth tone, it becomes a second
(rising) tone instead, as in such words as búqù (won’t/didn’t/doesn’t go) and
búyào (don’t/didn’t/won’t want). (For more about tones, see Chapter 1.)
Méiyôu is another negative prefix that also goes before a verb. It refers only
to the past, though, and means either something didn’t happen or at least
didn’t happen on a particular occasion:
 Wô méiyôu kàn nèi bù diànyîng. (waw mayo kahn nay boo dyan yeeng; I
didn’t see that movie.)
 Zuóti≈n méiyôu xiàyû. (dzwaw tyan mayo shyah yew; It didn’t rain
yesterday.)
38
Part I: Getting Started 

If the aspect marker guò is at the end of the verb méiyôu, it means it never
happened (up until now) in the past. By the way, you’ll sometimes find that
méiyôu is shortened just to méi:
 Wô méi qù guò Fâguó. (waw may chyew gwaw fah gwaw; I’ve never been
to France.)
 Wô méi ch∫guò Yìndù cài. (wo may chir gwaw een doo tsye; I’ve never
eaten Indian food.)

Getting possessive with the particle de
The particle de is ubiquitous in Chinese. Wherever you turn, there it is. Wôde
ti≈n! (waw duh tyan; My goodness!) Oops . . . there it is again. It’s easy to use.
All you have to do is attach it to the end of the pronoun, such as nîde ch√
(nee duh chuh; your car), or other modifier, such as t≈g∂ngs∫de j∫nglî (tah
goong suh duh jeeng lee; his company’s manager), and — voilà — it indicates
possession.
The particle de acts as an apostrophe “s” (’s) in English when it’s not
attached to a pronoun. It also makes the process of modification exactly the
opposite of the French possessive “de” or the English “of,” with which you
may be tempted to compare it.

Asking Questions
There are a couple of easy ways to ask questions in Chinese. Hopefully you’re
so curious about the world around you these days that you’re itching to ask
lots of questions once you know how.
The question particle “ma”
By far the easiest way to ask a question is simply to end any given statement
with a “ma.” That automatically makes it into a question. For example, T≈
ch∫fàn (tah chir fahn; He’s eating/he eats) becomes T≈ch∫fàn ma? (tah chir
fahn mah; Is he/does he eat?) Nî shu∂Zh∂ngwén (nee shwaw joong one; You
speak Chinese) becomes Nî shu∂Zh∂ngwén ma? (nee shwaw joong one 
mah; Do you speak Chinese?)

Alternate choice questions using bù 
in between repeating verbs
The second way you can ask a question is to repeat the verb in its negative
form. The English equivalent is to say something like “Do you eat, not eat?”
This format can be used for only a yes or no question, though. For example:
 Nî shì búshì Zh∂ngguórén? (nee shir boo shir joong gwaw run; Are you
Chinese?)
 T≈yào búyào háizi? (tah yaow boo yaow hi dzuh; Does he want children?)
 T≈men xîhu≈n bùxîhu≈n ch∫Zh∂ngguó cài? (tah men she hwahn boo
she hwahn chir joong gwaw tsye; Do they like to eat Chinese food?)
Interrogative pronouns
The last way to ask questions in Chinese is to use interrogative pronouns.
The following are pronouns that act as questions in Chinese:
 shéi (shay; who/whom)
 shéi de (shay duh; whose)
 shénme (shummuh; what)
 nâ (nah + classifier; which)
 nâr (nar; where)
 shénme dìf≈ng (shummah dee fahng; where)
Don’t confuse nâ with nâr. That one extra letter makes the difference
between saying “which” (nâ) and “where” (nâr).
Figuring out where such interrogative pronouns should go in any given sen-
tence is easy. Just put them wherever the answer would be found. For example:
 Question: Nî shì shéi? (nee shir shay; Who are you?)
 Answer: Nî shì wô péngyôu. (nee shir waw puhng yo; You are my friend.)
 Question: T≈de nhpéngyôu zài nâr? (tah duh nyew puhng yo dzye nar;
Where is his girlfriend?)
 Answer: T≈de nhpéngyôu zài ji≈lî. (tah duh nyew puhng yo dzye jyah lee;
His girlfriend is at home.)
42
Part I: Getting Started 

This also goes for the verb-bù-verb pattern. All you have to do to answer that
type of question is omit either the positive verb or the negative prefix and the
verb following it:
 Question: Nî hâo bù hâo? (nee how boo how; How are you? Literally: Are
you good or not good?)
 Answer: Wô hâo (waw how; I’m okay) or Wô bùhâo (waw boo how;
I’m not okay).
A way of asking “who” or “which person” without sounding rude or too famil-
iar is to use the term nêi wèi: literally, “which person.” For example, Nî yéye
shì nêi wèi? (nee yeh yeh shir nay way; Which one is your grandfather?)
You’ll often find interrogative pronouns at the beginning of sentences if
they’re followed by the verb yôu (yo; to exist), such as Shéi yôu wôde bî?
(shay yo waw duh bee; Who has my pen?)

Counting in Chinese
Figuring out things like how to specify the number of pounds of meat you
want to buy at the market, how much money you want to change at the air-
port, or how much that cab ride from your hotel is really going to cost can be
quite an ordeal if you don’t know the basic words for numbers.
Numbers from 1 to 10
Learning to count from 1 to 10 in Chinese is as easy as y∫(ee; one), èr (are;
two), s≈n (sahn; three). Table 2-3 lists numbers from 1 to 10.

If the number two comes before a classifier (see the section “Classifiers” 
earlier in this chapter), use the word liâng rather than èr. So you would say
that you have liâng bên sh∆(lyahng bun shoo; two books) rather than èr bên
sh∆(are bun shoo).
Practice saying these numbers by listening to the accompanying CD at bed-
time, and you’ll be counting sheep in Chinese in no time.
Numbers from 11 to 99
After the number 10, numbers are created by saying the word 10 followed by
the single digit that, when added to it, will combine to create numbers 11
through 19. It’s real easy. For example, 11 is shíy∫(shir ee) — literally, 
10 plus 1. Same thing goes for 12, and so on through 19. Table 2-4 lists 
numbers from 11 to 19.

(suh shir; 40), wûshí (woo shir; 50), liùshí (lyo shir; 60), q∫shí (chee shir; 70),
b≈shí (bah shir; 80), and jiûshí (jyoe shir; 90). What could be easier?
Numbers from 100 to 9,999
After the number 99, you can no longer count by tens.
 100 is yì bâi (ee bye).
 1,000 is yì qi≈n (ee chyan).
Chinese people count all the way up to wàn (wahn; ten thousand) and then
repeat up to yì (ee; a hundred million), unlike in English, where counting goes
up to a thousand before being repeated all the way to a million.
Numbers are represented with the higher units of value first. So the number
387 is s≈n bâi b≈shí q∫(sahn bye bah shir chee). The number 15,492 is yí
wàn wû qi≈n sì bâi jiû shí èr (ee wahn woo chyan suh bye jyoe shir are).
46
Part I: Getting Started 

The number one (y∫) changes its tone from the first (high) to the fourth
(falling) tone when followed by a first (high) tone, as in yì qi≈n (ee chyan;
1,000), by a second (rising) tone, as in yì nián (ee nyan; one year), and by
a third (low dipping) tone, as in yì bâi (ee bye; 100). And it changes to the
second (rising) tone when followed by a fourth (falling) tone, as in yí wàn
(ee wahn; 10,000). It remains its original first tone mark only when people
count numbers: one, two, three, and so on.
Numbers from 10,000 to 100,000
and beyond
Here are the big numbers:
 10,000 is yí wàn (ee wahn; literally: one unit of ten thousand).
 100,000 is shí wàn (shir wahn; literally: ten units of ten thousand).
 1,000,000 is yì bâi wàn (ee bye wahn: literally: one hundred units of 
ten thousand).
 100,000,000 is yí yì (ee ee; one hundred million).
Numbers play an interesting role in everyday speech in China. Sometimes
you’ll hear someone say emphatically Nî qi≈nwàn búyào xìn t≈de huà (nee
chyan wahn boo yaow sheen tah duh hwah; No matter what, you’re not to
believe what he says!) Qi≈n means one thousand, and wàn means ten thou-
sand, but when you put those two words together in front of the negative
prefix bù, you emphasize a point even more. Another phrase that has been
heard often in the Chinese past is the partial phrase wàn suì! (wahn sway;
long live). After that phrase, the person may add the name of someone in
power, so you hear something like Máo zhûxí wàn suì! (maow joo she wahn
sway; Long live Chairman Mao!) These days if you use this expression, you’re
kind of parodying a phrase taken extremely seriously just a few short
decades ago.
How ’bout those halves?
So what happens if you want to add a half to anything? You might be asking
yourself this about now. Well, the word for half is bàn (bahn), and it can
either come at the beginning, such as in bàn b√i kêlè (bahn bay kuh luh; a
half a glass of cola), or after a number and classifier but before the object to
mean “and a half,” such as in yí ge bàn x∫ngq∫(ee guh bahn sheeng chee; a
week and a half).

If a noun follows the ordinal number, a classifier needs to go in between
them, such as dì b≈ge xuésh√ng (dee bah guh shweh shuhng; the eighth
student) or dì y∫ge háizi (dee ee guy hi dzuh; the first child).
Asking how many or how much
There are two ways to ask how much something is or how many of something
there are. You can either use the question word du∂shâo (dwaw shaow),
when referring to something for which the answer is probably more than 10,
or jî (ge) (jee guh), when referring to something for which the answer is prob-
ably going to be less than 10:
 Nàge qìch√du∂shâo qián? (nah guh chee chuh dwaw shaow chyan; How
much is that car?)
 Nî xiâo nh’ér j∫nnián jî suì? (nee shyaow nyew are jin nyan jee sway;
How old is your little girl this year?)

Chapter 3
Introductions and Greetings: 
Nî Hâo!
In This Chapter
 Introducing yourself and others
 Greeting and chatting with family, friends, and colleagues
N
î hâo! (nee how; Hello!; How are you?) Those are probably the two most
important words you need to know to start a conversation with your
Chinese neighbors, with your Chinese in-laws coming into town, with a
Chinese classmate, or with airport personnel upon your arrival in China.
When you say them, you take the first step in making new friends and estab-
lishing contact with just about anybody.
In this chapter, I show you how to start your new connection off with just the
right words. The only other thing you have to do is smile. That’s something
all people understand, no matter what country they’re from.
Making Introductions
Nothing beats making new friends at a wânhuì (wahn hway; party), a x∫n
g∂ngzuò (sheen goong dzwaw; new job), on the dìtiê (dee tyeh; subway), or
just zài lùshàng (dzye loo shahng; on the street). You may meet someone
right after reading this chapter who becomes a good friend for life. This sec-
tion gives you a head start in making a good first impression. Go ahead and
practice these greetings to get ready for anything.

Acquainting yourself
When you make Chinese acquaintances or travel abroad, you soon discover
that a little knowledge of even a few key expressions in their native language
goes a long way in creating good will between your two cultures. Chinese
people in particular are very appreciative of anyone who takes the time to
learn their intricate and difficult language, so your efforts will be rewarded
many times over.
You have options other than nî hâo (nee how; hi; how are you) when you first
meet someone, such as Hên g≈oxìng jiàndào nî (hun gaow sheeng jyan daow
nee; Glad to meet you) or Wô hên róngxìng (waw hun roong sheeng; I’m hon-
ored to meet you). Go ahead and tell the person your míngzi (meeng dzuh;
name) and take the conversation from there.
Don’t know what to say after the first nî hâo? Here are a few examples of
common opening lines to get you started:
 Qîng ràng wô jièshào wô zìjî. (cheeng rahng waw jyeh shaow waw dzuh
jee; Please let me introduce myself.)
 Wô jiào ______. Nî ne? (waw jyaow ____. nee nuh; My name is _____.
What’s yours?)
 Nî jiào shénme míngzi? (nee jyaow shummuh meeng dzuh; What’s your
name?)
 Wô shì Mêiguórén. (waw shir may gwaw run; I’m an American.)
Introducing your friends and family
You can help your friends make even more friends if you start introducing
them to each other. All you have to do is say Qîng ràng wô jièshào wôde
péngyôu, Carl. (cheeng rahng waw jyeh shaow waw duh puhng yo, Carl; Let
me introduce my friend, Carl.) In addition to introducing your péngyôu
(puhng yo; friend), you can also introduce these important people:
 m≈ma (mah mah; mother)
 bàba (bah bah; father)
 tàitai (tye tye; wife)
 zhàngfu (jahng foo; husband)
 lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher)
52
Part I: Getting Started 

 tóngw∆(toong woo; roommate)
 tóngxué (toong shweh; classmate)
 wôde péngyôu (waw duh puhng yo; my friend)
 nán péngyôu (nahn puhng yo; boyfriend)
 nh péngyôu (nyew pung yo; girlfriend)
 tóngshì (toong shir; colleague)
 lâobân (laow bahn; boss)
When introducing two people to each other, always introduce the one with
the lower social status and/or age to the person with the higher social status.
The Chinese consider it polite.
Asking people for their names
Many situations call for informal greetings like Wô jiào Sarah. Nî ne? 
(waw jyaow Sarah. nee nuh; My name is Sarah. And yours?) or Nî jiào shénme
míngzi? (nee jyaow shummuh meeng dzuh; What’s your name?), but you can
show a greater level of politeness and respect by asking Nín guì xìng? (neeng
gway sheeng; literally: What’s your honorable surname?) But if you’re asking
this of someone who’s younger than you or lower in social status, you can
easily just say Nî jiào shénme míngzi? (nee jyaow shummah meeng dzuh;
What’s your name?) Even though míngzi usually means “given name,” when
you ask this question, it may elicit an answer of first and last name. Keep
practicing these different opening lines to ask who people are and you’re
bound to make friends quickly (or you’re bound to get to know a lot of
Chinese names at least).
If someone asks Nín guì xìng, don’t use the honorific guì when you answer,
referring to yourself. Your new acquaintance would consider you too boast-
ful. Such a response is like saying “My esteemed family name is Smith.” The
best way to answer is to say Wô xìng Smith. (waw sheeng Smith; My family
name is Smith.)
If a guy tells you his name in Chinese, you can be sure the first syllable he
utters will be his surname, not his given name. So if he says his name is Lî
Shìmín, for example, his family name is Lî and his given name is Shìmín. You
should keep referring to him as Lî Shìmín (rather than just Shìmín) until you
become really good friends. If you want to address him as Xi≈nsh√ng (shyan
shuhng; Mr.), or if you’re addressing a female as Xiâojiê (shyaow jyeh; Miss),
you put that title after his or her last name and say Lî Xi≈nsh√ng or Lî
Xiâojiê. Even though the Chinese language has words for Mr., Miss, and Mrs.
(Tàitài; tye tye), it has no equivalent term for “Ms.” At least not yet.

Sylvia introduces her friends, Irene and Mel, to each other.
Sylvia:
Irene, qîng ràng wô jièshào wôde péngyôu Mel.

Irene, allow me to introduce my friend Mel.
Irene:

Nee how. Hun gaow sheeng jyan daow nee.

Mel:

Irene:

Waw men shir toong shir.
We’re co-workers.
Greeting and Chatting
When you dâ zh≈ohu (dah jaow who; extend greetings), you’re sure to main-
tain and possibly even improve your connections with others. This goes for
starting the day right with your àirén (eye run; spouse), showing respect for
your lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher), keeping on the good side of your lâobân
(laow bahn; boss), or paving the way for that deal with your new sh√ngyì hé
lhuôl rén (shuhng yee huh hwaw run; business partner).
After the opening greeting, stick around to chat for a bit so you can get to
know each other better. You can make new friends and find out more about
each other through small conversations. This section gives you the impor-
tant phrases to know.
54
Part I: Getting Started 

Addressing new friends and strangers
In your hometown or home country, you may have plenty of lâo péngyôu
(laow puhng yo; old friends), but in any other city or country, you need to get
off on the right foot by addressing people the way they’re used to being
addressed. You can get chummier as time goes by, but try to avoid sounding
too friendly or presumptuous too soon.
It’s always safe to greet people in professional settings by announcing their
last name followed by their title, such as Wáng Xiàozhâng (wahng shyaow
jahng; President [of an educational institution] Wang) or J∫n Zhûrèn (jeen joo
run; Director Jin). Here are some other examples of occupational titles:
 bùzhâng (boo jahng; department head or minister)
 fùzhûrèn (foo joo run; assistant director)
 jiàoshòu (jyaow show; professor)
 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher)
If you don’t know someone’s title, you can safely address the person by
saying his or her family name and then either Xi≈nsh√ng (shyan shuhng; Mr.)
or Xiâojiê (shyaow jyeh; Miss).
One of the perks of getting to know someone’s family in China is that the
person often instructs his or her young children to address an older person
as shúshu (shoo shoo; uncle) or ≈yí (ah yee; aunt). It makes you feel like
you’re part of the family in a new country.
Sometimes people add the terms lâo (laow; old) or xiâo (shyaow; young) in
front of the last name and omit the first name completely. It indicates a com-
fortable degree of familiarity and friendliness that can only develop over
time. But make sure you know which one to use — lâo is for someone who’s
older than you, and xiâo is for someone who’s younger than you. Sometimes
these names can sound kind of funny to non-Chinese. If someone’s surname is
pronounced Yáng (yahng), which sounds like the word for goat, you may end
up sounding like you’re calling the person an old goat when you become
good friends.
Conversing around the clock
You can always say nî hâo (nee how; hi; how are you) when you meet some-
one, but at certain times of the day, you can use specific ways to express
your greetings.
55
Chapter 3: Introductions and Greetings: Nî Hâo!

In the morning when you meet family, friends, co-workers, or fellow students
in class, you can say zâo (dzaow; good morning) or zâo ≈n (dzaow ahn; good
morning; literally: early peace).
In the evening or before you go to sleep, you can say wân ≈n (wahn ahn;
good night). Just as zâo means early, wân means late. So if someone says Nî
lái de tài wân (nee lye duh tye wahn) or Nî lái de tài zâo (nee lye duh tye
dzaow), he means “You came too late” or “You came too early.”
56
Part I: Getting Started 
A word about culturally acceptable behavior
The Chinese are very friendly people and some-
times don’t hesitate to come up to a foreigner on
the street in order to practice their English. This
can be a great chance to practice your Chinese
as well. You have all sorts of cultural differences
to get used to, however, so don’t be surprised if
a person you meet for the first time starts asking
you about your salary or the cost of that cute
sweater you’re wearing. Subjects that are taboo
as conversation pieces in the United States
aren’t off limits in China. (Note: Try not to inquire
about a person’s political views or love life
unless you know the person really well, or you
may hit a brick wall.)
In general, Chinese people are loath to show
negative emotions in public. Anger and disap-
pointment or disapproval are major no-nos. Try
to do the same when you’re in a Chinese setting,
because you may run the risk of insulting some-
one unintentionally. To do so means that you
make them lose face — a cardinal sin if you
want to get along in China. The last thing you
want to do is insult, yell at, or otherwise embar-
rass anyone publicly, so keep a lid on any neg-
ative reactions you may have. You earn respect
by controlling your emotions.
You may be surprised that many Chinese have
no compunction about performing certain bodily
functions in public. The Chinese don’t consider
it rude, for example, to belch, spit, or even pass
gas in front of others. And because there’s no
such thing as a nonsmoking area, most smok-
ers don’t even think to ask if you mind them
lighting up near you. In addition to all these
things that tend to offend foreigners, you may
find people pointing or even staring at you —
especially in smaller towns and villages, which
rarely get foreign visitors. These behaviors are
considered perfectly acceptable, so don’t let
them get your dander up. Just go with the flow
and offer a polite smile in return.
The Chinese have a different idea about keep-
ing a certain polite physical distance when
speaking to someone. It isn’t uncommon to find
someone standing or sitting pretty close to you,
no matter how much you keep trying to inch
away. And if you find two friends of the same
sex walking arm in arm or holding hands, don’t
jump to any conclusions. It just means that
they’re friends.
Note: Avoid slaps on the back to Chinese people
you don’t know well, no matter how excited you
are to meet them. And when dealing with mem-
bers of the opposite sex, any physical contact
with folks you don’t know too well will be misin-
terpreted, so try to avoid it.

Talking about the weather
Talking about the ti≈nqì (tyan chee; weather) is always a safe topic in any
conversation. In fact, it’s kind of the universal ice breaker. If the skies are blue
and all seems right with the world, you can start by saying “J∫nti≈n de ti≈nqì
zh√n hâo, duì bú duì?” (jin tyan duh tyan chee juhn how, dway boo dway; The
weather today is sure nice, isn’t it?) Here are some adjectives to describe
temperature and humidity:
 lêng (lung; cold)
 liángkuài (lyahng kwye; cool)
 m√nrè (mun ruh; muggy)
 nuânhuó (nwan hwaw; warm)
 rè (ruh; hot)
If the weather is hot, you can use the word rè to describe it. But if your food
is spicy, which you sometimes refer to as “hot” in English, you can’t use rè to
describe it. You have to say it’s là (lah) instead. And if your food is too hot 
(in terms of temperature) to even put into your mouth, you say it’s tàng
(tahng).

The sìjì (suh jee; four seasons) — d∂ngti≈n (doong tyan; winter), ch∆nti≈n
(chwun tyan; spring), xiàti≈n (shyah tyan; summer), and qi∆ti≈n (chyo tyan;
fall) — all have their charms. They also all have their distinctive characteris-
tics when it comes to the weather, which you can express with the following
words in any conversation:
 bàof√ngxuê (baow fuhng shweh; blizzard)
 dàf√ng (dah fuhng; gusty winds)
 du∂yún (dwaw yewn; cloudy)
 f√ng hên dà (fuhng hun dah; windy)
 léiyû (lay yew; thunderstorm)
 qínglâng (cheeng lahng; sunny)
 qíngti≈n (cheeng tyan; clear)
 xià máomáoyû (shyah maow maow yew; drizzle)
 xiàwù (shyah woo; fog)
 xiàxuê (shyah shweh; snow)
 xiàyû (shyah yew; rainy)
 y∫nti≈n (yeen tyan; overcast)

In cold weather, you can go skiing or ice skating. So
Harbin during the winter is a lot of fun.
Finding out where people are from
It’s natural to wonder where people are from when you first meet them.
Maybe they hail from your hometown. Maybe your new friend’s mother and
your father went to the same high school way back when. Either way, what-
ever motivates you to pose the question, you ask it by saying “Nî shì nâr de
rén?” (nee shir nar duh run; Where are you from?)
To answer this question, you replace the word nî (nee; you) with wô (waw; I)
and put the name of wherever you’re from where the word nâr is.
People in Taiwan say nálî (nah lee) rather than nâr (nar) for the word
“where.” Nâr indicates a northern accent and is used primarily by people
from mainland China.
Here’ a list of countries that may come up in conversation:
 Fâguó (fah gwaw; France)
 Mêiguó (may gwaw; America)
 Rìbên (ir bun; Japan)
 Ruìdiân (rway dyan; Sweden)
 Ruìshì (rway shir; Switzerland)
 Yìdàlì (ee dah lee; Italy)

Taking (a.k.a. rejecting) compliments
Chinese people are always impressed whenever they meet a foreigner who
has taken the time to learn their language. So when you speak Zh∂ngwén
(joong one; Chinese) to a Zh∂ngguórén (joong gwaw run; Chinese person), he
may very well say Nîde Zh∂ngwén tài hâole. (nee duh joong one tye how luh;
Your Chinese is fantastic.) Instead of patting yourself on the back, however,
you should be slightly self-deprecating in your response (see Chapter 18 for
more things you should never do). Don’t give in to the temptation to accept
the compliment easily and say xiè xiè (shyeh shyeh; thanks), because that
implies that you agree wholeheartedly with the complimentary assessment.
Instead, try one of the following replies. Each of them can be roughly trans-
lated as “It’s nothing” or the equivalent of “No, no, I don’t deserve any
praise”:
 guò jiâng guò jiâng (gwaw jyahng gwaw jyahng)
 nálî nálî (nah lee nah lee)
 nâr de huà (nar duh hwah)
Saying goodbye
When it comes time to say goodbye, you can always say zài jiàn (dzye jyan;
goodbye). If you’re just leaving for a little while and plan to be back soon, you
can say y∫huîr jiàn (ee hwahr jyan; see you in a bit). And if you won’t see
someone until the next day, you can say míngti≈n jiàn (meeng tyan jyan; see
you tomorrow). For a quick “see you later,” you can say huítóu jiàn (hway toe
jyan). Here’s a list of other phrases you can use to say goodbye:
 huítóu jiàn (hway toe jyan; see you later)
 míngnián jiàn (meeng nyan jyan; see you next year)
 míngti≈n jiàn (meeng tyan jyan; see you tomorrow)
 xiàge lîbài jiàn (shyah guh lee bye jyan; see you next week)
 x∫ngq∫’èr jiàn (sheeng chee are jyan; see you on Tuesday)
 y∫huîr jiàn (ee hwahr jyan; see you soon)

The importance of the common good
In China, the collective always comes before
the individual. The Chinese are certainly not 
as self-centered as Westerners and generally
subordinate their individual desires in favor of
the greatest common good, whether the
“common good” refers to the good of the family,
the class at school, or co-workers. You even see
this mentality in the way envelopes are
addressed — the country first, followed by the
province, the city, the street address, and then,
on the last line, the person’s name to whom it is
addressed. And even on that last line, the
person’s name is written with the family name
first and the given name last. The same holds
true for the way people refer to where they’re
from — the larger unit always comes before the
smaller. That’s why a person would say, for
example, that he’s from Y∫ngguó Lúnd∆n (eeng
gwaw lwun dun; England, London) rather than
London, England, as you say in English.

Xiánliáo (shyan lyaow) means “small talk” in Chinese. Xiántán (shyan tahn) is
“to chat” . . . either term does the trick.
Establishing a Connection
A surefire way of initiating a conversation is to ask someone a question. Here
are some basic question words to keep in mind as you approach the moment
of acquaintance:
 Shéi (shay; Who?)
 Shénme? (shummuh; What?)
 Zài nâr? (dzye nar; Where?)
 Shénme shíhòu? (shummuh shir ho; When?)
 Wèishénme? (way shummuh; Why?)
 Zênme? (dzummuh; How?)
 Du∂jiû? (dwaw jyoe; For how long?)

Here are a few examples of how to use these question words in simple 
sentences — sometimes you can also use some of them on their own, just as
in English:
 T≈shì shéi? (tah shir shay; Who is he/she?)
 Nî yào shénme? (nee yaow shummuh; What would you like?)
 Jî diân zh∂ng? (jee dyan joong; What time is it?)
 Cèsuô zài nâr? (tsuh swaw dzye nar; Where’s the bathroom?)
 Nî shénme shíhòu ch∫fàn? (nee shummuh shir ho chir fahn; When do 
you eat?)
 Nî wèishénme yào qù Zh∂ngguó? (nee way shummuh yaow chyew joong
gwaw; Why do you want to go to China?)
 Nî zênme yàng? (nee zummuh yahng; How’s it going?)
 Nî yîj∫ng zài zhèr du∂jiû le? (nee ee jeeng dzye jar dwaw jyoe luh; How
long have you been here already?)
 Xiànzài jî diân zh∂ng? (shyan dzye jee dyan joong; What time is it now?)
You can also use the following responses to the questions in the preceding
list if someone happens to approach you. These statements are the basics of
small talk and really come in handy when you’re learning a foreign language:
 Wô bùdông. (waw boo doong; I don’t understand.)
 Wô bùzh∫dào. (waw boo jir daow; I don’t know.)
 Wô búrènshi t≈. (waw boo run shir tah; I don’t know him/her.)
 Duìbùqî. (dway boo chee; Excuse me.)
 Hên bàoqiàn. (hun baow chyan; I’m so sorry.)

Making Small Talk on the Job
The kind of job you have can say plenty about you. It can also be a great
topic of conversation or spice up an otherwise dull exchange. To ask some-
one about his or her g∂ngzuò (goong dzwaw; work), you can say, “Nî zuò
shénme g∂ngzuò?” (nee dzwaw shummuh goong dzwaw; What kind of work
do you do?) You may even try to guess and say, for example, “Nî shì lâosh∫
ma?” (nee shir laow shir mah; Are you a teacher?)
The following are some occupations you or the person you’re talking with
may hold:
 lâosh∫(laow shir; teacher)
 jiàoshòu (jyaow show; professor)
 lfsh∫(lyew shir; lawyer)
 y∫sh√ng (ee shung; doctor)
 hùshì (who shir; nurse)
 bi≈njí (byan jee; editor)
 kuàijì (kwye jee; accountant)
 shuînuâng∂ng (shway nwan goong; plumber)
 diàng∂ng (dyan goong; electrician)
 yânyuán (yan ywan; actor)
 zhûguân (joo gwan; CEO)

 f√ixíngyuán (fay sheeng ywan; pilot)
 chéngwùyuán (chuhng woo ywan; flight attendant)
 hâigu≈n gu≈nyuán (hi gwan gwan ywan; customs agent)
 lièch√yuán (lyeh chuh ywan; train conductor)
 ji√xiànyuán (jyeh shyan ywan; telephone operator)
 qiántái fúwùyuán (chyan tye foo woo ywan; receptionist)
 kèfáng fúwùyuán (kuh fahng foo woo ywan; housekeeper)
 ch∆nàyuán (choo nah ywan; bank teller)
 yóudìyuán (yo dee ywan; mail carrier)
 cáifeng (tsye fung; tailor)
The following are some useful job terms and job-related expressions:
 bàn rì g∂ngzuò (bahn ir goong dzwaw; part-time work)
 quán rì g∂ngzuò (chwan ir goong dzwaw; full-time work)
 sh∫yè (shir yeh; unemployed)
 miànshì (myan shir; interview)
 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 gùyuán (goo ywan; employee)
 gùzhû (goo joo; employer)
In China, your d≈nwèi (dahn way; work unit) is an important part of your life.
(This term refers to your place of work, which can be anywhere in the coun-
try. Your d≈nwèi is the group that’s responsible for both taking care of you
and being responsible for any missteps you happen to make.) In fact, when
people ask you to identify yourself over the phone, they often say “Nî nâr?”
(nee nar; literally: Where are you from?) to find out what d≈nwèi you belong
to. Under Chairman Mao Zedong (the leader of the Chinese Communist Party,
who founded the People’s Republic of China in 1949), people were assigned
jobs right out of high school and didn’t even think of marrying until they
knew the location of their assignment. They could’ve been given a job in the
northern hinterlands of China, and their fiancées could’ve been sent south —
only to see each other once a year during the Chinese New Year. The d≈nwèi
continues to provide housing for its employees and also enforces govern-
ment policies, such as the one-child-per-family policy. You need the unit’s
permission to get married, have a child, or receive any government benefits.

Talking About Where You Live
After folks get to know each other through small talk, they may exchange
addresses and phone numbers to keep in touch. That introductory question
covered earlier in this chapter, “Nî zhù zài nâr?” (nee joo dzye nar; Where do
you live?), may pop up. You may also want to ask a few of these questions:
 Nîde dìzhî shì shénme? (nee duh dee jir shir shummuh; What’s your
address?)
 Nîde diànhuà hàomâ du∂shâo? (nee duh dyan hwah how mah dwaw
shaow; What’s your phone number?)
 Nî shénme shíhòu zài ji≈? (nee shummuh shir ho dzye jyah; When will
you be at home?/When are you home?)
You may also talk about your home from time to time. These words and
phrases can come in handy:
 Wômen zhù de shì fángzi. (waw mun joo duh shir fahng dzuh; We live in
a house.)
 T≈zhù de shì g∂ngyù. (tah joo duh shir goong yew; She lives in an apart-
ment.)
 T≈men yôu yíge yuànzi. (tah mun yo ee guh ywan dzuh; They have a
yard.)
 Nî yôu yíge hu≈yuán. (nee yo ee guh hwah ywan; You have a garden.)

 Wô zhù zài chénglî. (waw joo dzye chuhng lee; I live in the city.)
 Wô zhù zài ji≈owài. (waw joo dzye jyaow why; I live in the suburbs.)
 Wô zhù zài nóngc∆n. (waw joo dzye noong tswun; I live in the country.)
In addition to your diànhuà hàomâ (dyan hwah how mah; phone number)
and your dìzhî (dee jir; address), most people also want to know your diànzî
yóuxi≈ng dìzhî (dyan dzuh yo shyahng dee jir; e-mail address). And if you find
yourself in a more formal situation, it may be appropriate to give someone
your míngpiàn (meeng pyan; business card). (To find out how to pronounce
numbers, see Chapter 2.)

Chapter 5
Eating and Drinking: G≈nb√i!
In This Chapter
 Eating, Chinese style
 Ordering and conversing in restaurants
 Paying for your meal
 Shopping for groceries
You may think you already know what Chinese food is all about, but if you
suddenly find yourself a guest in a Chinese friend’s home or the guest 
of honor at a banquet for your company’s new branch in Shanghai, you may
want to keep reading. This chapter not only helps you communicate when
you’re hungry or thirsty, go grocery shopping, and order food in a restaurant,
but also gives you some useful tips on how to be both a wonderful guest and
a gracious host when you have only one shot at making a good impression.
Feeling hungry yet? Allow me to whet your appetite by inviting you to take a
closer look at world-renowned Chinese cuisine. No doubt you’re already
familiar with a great many Chinese dishes, from chow mein and chop suey, to
sweet and sour pork, to that delicious favorite of all Chinese fare, dim sum.
Exploring Chinese food and Chinese eating etiquette is a great way to dis-
cover Chinese culture. You can also use what you discover in this chapter to
impress your date by ordering in Chinese the next time you eat out.
All About Meals
If you feel hungry when beginning this section, you should stop to ch∫(chir;
eat) fàn (fahn; food). In fact, fàn always comes up when you talk about meals
in China. Different meals throughout the day, for example, are called
 zâofàn (dzaow fahn; breakfast)
 wûfàn (woo fahn; lunch)
 wânfàn (wahn fahn; dinner)

For centuries, Chinese people greeted each other not by saying “Nî hâo ma?”
(nee how ma; How are you?), but by saying “Nî ch∫fàn le méiyôu?” (nee chir
fahn luh mayo; literally: “Have you eaten?”)
In China, fàn actually means some kind of grain or starch-based staple. You
can have mîfàn (mee fahn; rice), which can be châo fàn (chaow fahn; fried
white rice) or bái mîfàn (bye mee fahn; boiled white rice); miàntiáo (myan
tyaow; noodles); màntóu (mahn toe; steamed bread); b≈ozi (baow dzuh;
steamed buns); or jiâozi (jyaow dzuh; dumplings). As you can see, you have
many types of fàn to choose from.
Satisfying your hunger
If you’re hungry, you can say wô hên è (waw hun uh; I’m very hungry) and
wait for a friend to invite you for a bite to eat. If you’re thirsty, just say wôde
kôu hên kê (waw duh ko hun kuh; literally: my mouth is very dry) to hear
offers for all sorts of drinks. You may not get a chance to even utter these
words, however, because Chinese rules of hospitality dictate offering food
and drink to guests right off the bat.
You have a couple of subtle ways to get across the idea that you’re hungry so
you don’t appear too forward. You can say
 Nî è ma? (nee uh mah; Are you hungry?)
 Nî è bú è? (nee uh boo uh; Are you hungry?)
 Nî hái méi ch∫wânfàn ba. (nee hi may chir wahn fahn bah; I bet you
haven’t had dinner yet.)
By checking to see if the other person is hungry first, you display the prized
Chinese sensibility of consideration for others, and you give yourself a
chance to gracefully get out of announcing that you, in fact, are really the one
who’s dying for some Chinese food. If you want, you can always come right
out and say that you’re the one who’s hungry by substituting wô (waw; I) for
nî (nee; you).
If you hear the sound ba (bah) at the end of a sentence, you can probably
interpret it as “I bet,” as in Nî hái méi ch∫wânfàn ba (nee hi may chir wahn
fahn bah; I bet you haven’t had dinner yet), or as “let’s,” as in Wômen qù
ch∫fàn ba (waw men chyew chir fahn bah; Let’s go have dinner). One little
utterance serves to soften the sound of making a request (or a command).
You can say something like Nî xi≈n h√jiû (nee shyan huh jyoe; Drink wine
first), but you sound nicer and friendlier if you say Nî xi≈n h√jiû ba (nee
shyan huh jyoe bah; Better drink some wine first; Why not have some wine
first?)?
80
Part II: Chinese in Action 

When an acquaintance invities you for dinner, he may ask, Nî yào ch∫fàn
háishì yào ch∫miàn? (nee yaow chir fahn hi shir yaow chir myan; Do you want
to eat rice or noodles?) Naturally, your host doesn’t just serve you a bowl of
rice or noodles, because he wants to know what basic staple to prepare
before he adds the actual cài (tsye; the various dishes that go with the rice or
noodles).
The many varieties of cài have made China the envy of the culinary world.
Centuries of subsistence-level existence have taught the Chinese not to waste
one morsel of an animal, mineral, or vegetable when they can use the morsel
as food. Chronic shortages of food at various points in Chinese history have
lent credence to the saying “Necessity is the mother of invention.” The
Chinese say it another way, however: They eat “anything with legs that’s not
a table and anything with wings that’s not an airplane.” Either way, you get
the idea.
Sitting down to eat
Once you’ve chosen what you’d like to order and it’s actually been served
and sits staring you in the face on the table, you’ll probably want to know
what utensils to use in order to eat the meal. Don’t be shy about asking for a
good old fork and knife, even if you’re in a Chinese restaurant. It’s a myth that
Chinese people all eat with chopsticks anyway. Table 5-1 presents a handy list
of utensils you’ll want to know how to say at one point or another.

Even though Chinese food is so varied and great you could have it three
meals a day forever, once in a while you might really find yourself hankering
for a good old American hamburger or a stack of French fries. In fact, you
may be surprised to find places like McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken
in Asia when you least expect to. Table 5-2 lists some items you can order
when you’re in need of some old fashioned comfort food, and Table 5-3 lists

Do you prefer meat háishì (hi shir; or) fish?
When you can choose between more than one
item on a Chinese menu, you can use the alter-
native question structure for interrogative
expressions by placing the word háishì (hi shir;
or) between the two choices. If you use the term
“or” in affirmative sentences, however — such
as when you say she’s arriving either today or
tomorrow — you should use the word huò
(hwaw) or huò zhe (hwaw juh) instead.

Fine. I agree, I also don’t like to eat spicy food. Let’s
go, it’s already 6 o’clock.
The word xiâng (shyahng) in Chinese can mean “to think” and “to miss.” So
you may hear someone say, Wô xiâng wô hên xiâng ji≈. (waw shyahng waw
hun shyahng jya; I think I really miss home.)
Practicing proper table manners
When you receive an invitation to someone’s home, always remember to
bring a small gift and to toast others before you take a drink yourself during
the meal (see Chapter 18 for a list of things never to do). The Chinese have
no problem slurping their soup or belching during or after a meal, by the way,
so don’t be surprised if you witness both at a perfectly formal gathering. And
to remain polite and in good graces, you should always make an attempt to
serve someone else before yourself when dining with others; otherwise, you
run the risk of appearing rude and self-centered.

Part II: Chinese in Action 

Don’t be hesitant to use some of these phrases at the table:
 Màn ch∫or màn màn ch∫! (mahn chir or mahn mahn chir; Bon appetite!)
This phrase literally means “Eat slowly,” but it’s loosely translated as
“Take your time and enjoy your food.”
 Zìjî lái. (dzuh jee lye; I’ll help myself.)
 G≈nb√i! (gahn bay; Bottoms up!)
 Du∂ch∫yìdiâr ba! (dwaw chir ee dyar bah; Have some more!)
 Wô ch∫bâo le. (waw chir baow luh; I’m full.)
Whenever a dining partner begins to serve you food, as is the custom, you
must always feign protest with a few mentions of zìjî lái (dzuh jee lye; I’ll help
myself) so you don’t appear to assume that someone should be serving you.
In the end, you should permit the person to follow proper etiquette by serv-
ing you portions from each dish if you’re the guest.
And whatever you do, don’t use a yáqi≈n (yah chyan; toothpick) without cov-
ering your mouth. One of the ultimate dining faux pas is to make your teeth
visible during toothpick use.
Getting to Know Chinese Cuisines
You may have already discovered that different regions of China specialize in
different types of cuisine. Each province has its own specialties, cooking
style, and favorite ingredients. Some corner the market on spicy food, and
others showcase rather bland food. But no matter where you go, you’re sure
to discover a new taste bud or two along the way.
Northern Chinese food, found in places like Beijing, is famous for all sorts of
meat dishes. You find plenty of beef, lamb, and duck (remember Peking
Duck?). To garnish the meat, garlic and scallions are added for good measure.
Northern cooking is bland because of the lack of excessive condiments, so
don’t expect anything overtly salty, sweet, or spicy.
Shanghai dining, as well as that of the neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces, represents Eastern cuisine. Because these places are close to the
sea and boast many lakes, you can find an infinite variety of seafood in this
part of China. Fresh vegetables, different kinds of bamboo, and plenty of soy
sauce and sugar are also hallmarks of this region’s cuisine.
Food from Sichuan and Hunan provinces is considered Western Chinese cui-
sine. Western food is common in Chinese restaurants in the United States.
85
Chapter 5: Eating and Drinking: G≈nb√i!

Because this part of China is hot and humid, hot peppers and salt are com-
monly found here. Not only is the food considered fiery, but also some
famous revolutionaries who’ve hailed from this part of China, such as Mao
Zedong.
Southern Chinese cuisine hails from Guangdong (formerly known as Canton)
province, as well as from Fujian and Taiwan. Like Shanghai cuisine, it offers
plentiful amounts of seafood, fresh fruits, and vegetables. One of the most
famous types of food from Guangdong that you’ve no doubt heard of is dim
sum (deem sum), which in standard Mandarin is pronounced diân x∫n (dyan
sheen).
Dining Out
Whether you eat in a friend’s home or in a fancy Chinese restaurant, you
need to know how to ask for some basic utensils and how to refer to items
already on the table.
You ask for something politely by saying Qîng nî gêi wô . . . (cheeng nee gay
waw; Would you mind please getting me a . . .)
You can also say Máfan nî gêi wô . . . (mah fahn nee gay waw; May I trouble
you to please get me a . . .)
Here are some items you commonly encounter or need to ask for when
dining out:
 yíge wân (ee guh wahn; a bowl)
 yíge pánzi (ee guh pahn dzuh; a plate)
 yíge b√izi (ee guh bay dzuh; a glass)
 yíge tiáog√ng (ee guh tyaow guhng; a spoon)
 yíge d≈ozi (ee guh daow dzuh; a knife)
 yíge ch≈zi (ee guh chah dzuh; a fork)
 yì zh≈ng c≈nj∫n (ee jahng tsahn jeen; a napkin)
 yì g√n yáqi≈n (ee gun yah chyan; a toothpick)
 yíge sh∫máoj∫n (ee guh shir maow jeen; a wet towel)
 yíge rè máoj∫n (ee guh ruh maow jeen; a hot towel)
 yì shu≈ng kuàizi (ee shwahng kwye dzuh; a pair of chopsticks)
86
Part II: Chinese in Action 

When in doubt, use the measure word ge (guh) in front of the noun you want
to modify by a numeral or a specifier, such as “this” (zhè; jay) or “that” (nà;
nah). As you can see from the previous list, the word for “a” always begins
with y∫(ee), meaning the number 1 in Chinese. In between y∫and the noun is
the measure word. For chopsticks, it’s shu≈ng (shwahng), meaning pair; for
napkin, it’s zh≈ng (jahng), used for anything with a flat surface (such as
paper, a map, or even a bed); and a toothpick’s measuring word is g√n (gun),
referring to anything resembling a stick, such as rope, a thread, or a blade of
grass. Chinese has many different measure words, but ge (guh) is by far the
most common.

Understanding what’s on the menu
Are you a vegetarian? If so, you’ll want to order sùcài (sue tsye; vegetable
dishes). If you’re a died-in-the-wool carnivor, however, you should definitely
keep your eye on the kind of h∆ncài (hwun tsye; meat or fish dishes) listed on
the càid≈n (tsye dahn; menu). Unlike the fàn (fahn; rice) or miàn (myan; noo-
dles) you may order, which come in individual bowls for everyone at the
table, the cài (tsye; dishes) you order arrive on large plates, which you’re
expected to share with others.
88
Part II: Chinese in Action 

You should become familiar with the basic types of food on the menu in case
you have only Chinese characters and p∫ny∫n romanization to go on. Having
the knowledge allows you to immediately know which section to focus on (or,
likewise, to avoid).
Take meat, for example. In English, the words for “pork,” “beef,” and “mutton”
have no hints of the words for the animals themselves, such as zh∆(joo; pig),
niú (nyoe; cow), or yáng (yahng; lamb). Chinese is much simpler. Just com-
bine the word for the animal and the word ròu (row), meaning “meat,” after
it, such as zh∆ròu (joo row; pork), niú ròu (nyoe row; beef), or yáng ròu
(yahng row; mutton). Voilà! You have the dish.

Chowing down on the Chinese New Year
On the eve of the Chinese lunar New Year,
known as chú x∫(choo she), the Chinese eat a
big niányèfàn (nyan yeh fahn; New Year’s Eve
dinner). The dinner almost always includes a
whole cooked yú (yew; fish), because the word
for fish rhymes with the word for abundance
(yú), even though the written characters for the
words look quite different. In some of the poorer
parts of northern China, people often eat jiâozi
(jyaow dzuh; dumplings) rather than fish
because their shape resembles traditional
yuánb≈o (ywan baow; gold ingots) used in 
pre-modern times by people of means. These
people hope that the prosperity and abundance
of such wealthy families will also come into
their lives through the eating of the jiâozi
(jyaow dzuh). Southerners often eat f≈cài (fah
tsye; a kind of stringy black vegetable), which
rhymes with f≈cái (fah tsye), although you
pronounce the words in different tones. F≈cái
means to get wealthy and prosper; in fact, the
most common greeting on New Year’s day is
g∂ngxî f≈cái! (goong she fah tsye; Congratula-
tions and may you prosper!)

Placing an order and chatting
with the wait staff
I bet you’re used to everyone ordering one dish for themselves, right? Well, in
China, diners almost always share dishes by putting them on common plat-
ters smack in the middle of the table where everyone can pick and choose.
You get used to ordering with the whole group in mind, not just yourself —
just one more example of how the collective is always considered before the
individual in Chinese culture.
Chinese table etiquette dictates that everyone decides together what to
order. The two main categories you must decide upon are the cài (tsye; food
dishes) and the t≈ng (tahng; soup). Feel free to be the first one to ask Wômen
y∫ngg≈i jiào jîge cài jîge t≈ng? (waw men eeng gye jyaow jee guh tsye jee guh
tahng; How many dishes and how many soups should we order?) Ideally, one
of each of the five major tastes should appear in the dishes you choose for
your meal to be a “true” Chinese meal: su≈n (swan; sour), tián (tyan; sweet),
kû (koo; bitter), là (lah; spicy), and xián (shyan; salty).
I know it can be hard to choose what to eat from all the fantastic choices star-
ing back at you from most any Chinese menu; after all, the Chinese perfected
the art of cooking long before the French and Italians appeared on the scene.
But when you finally hit on something you like, you have to figure out how to
tell the waiter what you want to ch∫(chir; eat), whether you like là (lah; spicy)
food or not, if you want to avoid wèij∫ng (way jeeng; MSG), what kind of píjiû
(pee jyoe; beer) you want to h√(huh; drink), and that you want to know what
kind of náshôu cài (nah show tsye; house specialty) the restaurant has going
today.
Here are some questions your waiter or waitress is likely to ask you:
 Nîmen yào shénme cài? (nee men yaow shummuh tsye; What would you
like to order; literally: What kind of food would you like?)
 Nîmen yào h√diâr shénme? (nee men yaow huh dyar shummuh; What
would you like to drink?)
 Yào jî píng píjiû? (yaow jee peeng pee jyoe; How many bottles of beer do
you want?)
And here are some phrases that come in handy when you need to give an
answer:
 Wômen yào yíge su≈n là t≈ng. (waw men yaow ee guh swan lah tahng;
We’d like a hot-and-sour soup.)
94
Part II: Chinese in Action 

 Wô bù ch∫là de. (waw boo chir lah duh; I don’t eat spicy food.)
 Qîng bié fàng wèij∫ng, wô guòmîn. (cheeng byeh fahng way jeeng, waw
gwaw meen; Please don’t use any MSG, I’m allergic.)
When addressing a waiter or waitress, you can call them by the same name:
fúwùyuán (foo woo ywan; service personnel). In fact, “he,” “she,” and “it” all
share the same Chinese word, too: t≈(tah). Isn’t that easy to remember?
 Qîng gêi wô càid≈n. (cheeng gay waw tsye dahn; Please give me the
menu.)
 Nî gêi wômen jièshào cài hâo ma? (nee gay waw men jyeh shaow tsye
how ma; Can you recommend some dishes?)
 Dà sh∫fu náshôu cài shì shénme? (dah shir foo nah show tsye shir 
shummuh; What’s the chef’s specialty?)
 Yú x∫nxi≈n ma? (yew shin shyan mah; Is the fish fresh?)
 Wô bú yuànyì ch∫hâish√n. (waw boo ywan yee chir hi shun; I don’t want
to try sea slugs.)
 Nîmen yôu kuàngquán shuî ma? (nee men yo kwahng chwan shway
mah; Do you have any mineral water?)
 Wô bú yào là de cài. (waw boo yaow lah duh tsye; I don’t want anything
spicy.)
 Wô bù néng ch∫yôu táng de cài. (waw boo nuhng chir yo tahng duh tsye;
I can’t eat anything made with sugar.)
 Wô bù ch∫zh∆ròu. (waw boo chir joo row; I don’t eat pork.)
 Qîng c≈zhu∂zi. (cheeng tsah jwaw dzuh; Please wipe off the table.)
 Qîng bâ yînliào sòng lái. (cheeng bah yin lyaow soong lye; Please bring
our drinks.)
 Wô méi jiào zhèige. (waw may jyaow jay guh; I didn’t order this.)
Regular nouns in Chinese make no distinction between singular and plural.
Whether you want to talk about one píngguô (peeng gwaw; apple), two júzi
(jyew dzuh; oranges), or both píngguó hé júzi (peeng gwaw huh jyew dzuh;
apples and oranges), the fruits always sound the same in Chinese. On the
other hand, if you want to refer to human beings, you can always add the
suffix men (mun). The word for “I” or “me” is wô (waw), but “we” becomes
wômen (waw men). The same goes for nî (nee; you) and t≈(tah; he, she,
and it). “They” becomes nîmen (nee mun) or t≈men (tah mun). If you want to
refer to a specific number of apples, however, you don’t use “men” as a suffix.
You can either say píngguô (peeng gwaw) for apple (or apples) or liângge
píngguô (lyahng guh peeng gwaw), meaning two apples. Got it?

Dipping into some dim sum
Dim sum is probably the most popular food of Chinese in the United States
and of people in Guangdong Province and all over Hong Kong, where you can
find it served for breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner. Vendors even sell
dim sum snacks in subway stations.
The dish’s main claim to fame is that it takes the shape of mini portions, and
it’s often served with tea to help cut through the oil and grease afterwards.
You have to signal the waiters when you want a dish of whatever is on the
dim sum cart they push in the restaurant, however, or they just pass on by.
Dim sum restaurants are typically crowded and noisy, which only adds to
the fun.
Part of the allure of dim sum is that you get to sample a whole range of differ-
ent tastes while you catch up with old friends. Dim sum meals can last for
hours, which is why most Chinese people choose the weekends to have dim
sum. No problem lingering on a Saturday or Sunday.
Because dim sum portions are so small, your waiter often tallys the total by
the number of plates left on your table. You can tell the waiter you want a

Finding the restrooms
After you have a bite to eat, you may be in need of a restroom. The need may
be dire if you’re smack in the middle of a 12-course banquet in Beijing and
already have a couple of glasses of máotái (maow tye), the stiffest of all
Chinese drinks, under your belt.
Now all you have to do is garner the energy to ask “Cèsuô zài nâr?” (tsuh
swaw dzye nar; Where’s the restroom?) if you’re in mainland China or “Cèsuô
zài nâlî” (tsuh swaw dzye nah lee) if you’re in Taiwan. You can also ask “Nâlî
kêyî xî shôu?” (nah lee kuh yee she show; Where can I wash my hands?)
No matter what way you ask for directions to the restroom, don’t forget to
take some toilet paper with you before you leave the hotel if you’re in main-
land China, because many public restrooms don’t supply it there. In most
cases, the pictures on the bathroom doors are self-explanatory, but you may
also see the p∫ny∫n for male (nán; nahn) and female (nh; nyew) before the
word cèsuô. Those are the words you want to pay attention to above all else.
You can also find the word cèsuô in the term for graffiti: cèsuô wénxué (tsuh
swaw one shweh; literally: bathroom literature). How apropos.
Finishing your meal and paying the bill
Once you’re through sampling all possible permutations of Chinese cuisine
(or French or Italian, for that matter), you won’t be able to just slink away
unnoticed out the front door and on into the sunset. Time to pay the bill, my
friend. Hopefully it was worth the expense. Here are some phrases you
should know when the time comes:
 jiézhàng (jyeh jahng; to pay the bill)
 f√nk≈i suàn (fun kye swahn; to go Dutch)
 Wô qîng kè. (waw cheeng kuh; It’s on me.)
99
Chapter 5: Eating and Drinking: G≈nb√i!

 Qîng jiézhàng. (cheeng jyeh jahng; The check, please.)
 Zhàngd≈n yôu cuò. (jahng dahn yo tswaw; The bill is incorrect.)
 B≈okuò fúwùfèi. (baow kwaw foo woo fay; The tip is included.)
 Qîng k≈i sh∂ujù. (cheeng kye show jyew; Please give me the receipt.)
 Wô kêyî yòng xìnyòng kâ ma? (waw kuh yee yoong sheen yoong kah
mah; May I use a credit card?)
All the Tea in China
You encounter about as many different kinds of tea as you do Chinese
dialects. Hundreds, in fact. To make ordering or buying this beverage easier,
however, you really need to know only the most common kinds of tea:
 Lf chá. (lyew chah; Green tea) Green tea is the oldest of all the teas in
China, with many unfermented subvarieties. The most famous kind of
Green tea is called lóngjîng chá (loong jeeng chah), meaning Dragon Well
tea. You can find it near the famous West Lake region in Hangzhou, but
people in the south generally prefer this kind of tea.
 Hóng chá. (hoong chah; Black tea) Even though hóng means red in
Chinese, you translate this phrase as Black tea instead. Unlike Green tea,
Black teas are fermented and enjoyed primarily by people in the Fujian
Province.
 W∆lóng chá. (oo loong; Black Dragon tea) This kind of tea is semi-
fermented. It’s a favorite in the Guangdong and Fujian provinces and
in Taiwan.
 Mòlì hu≈chá. (maw lee hwah chah; Jasmine) This kind of tea is made up
of a combination of Black, Green, and W∆lóng teas, in addition to some
fragrant flowers like jasmine or magnolia thrown in for good measure.
Most northerners are partial to Jasmine tea, probably because the north
is cold and this type of tea raises the body’s temperature.
Tea is always offered to guests the minute they enter a Chinese home. The
hosts aren’t just being polite; the offering of tea shows respect to the guest
and presents a way to share something that all parties can enjoy together. It
may be considered rude not to at least take a sip. Chinese custom says that a
host only fills the teacup to 70 percent of its capacity. The other 30 percent is
supposed to contain friendship and affection. Isn’t that a nice concept?
You often use the adjective hâo (how; good) with a verb to create an adjec-
tive that means “good to.” Here are a couple of examples:
100
Part II: Chinese in Action 

 hâoh√(how huh; tasty; literally: good to drink)
 hâoch∫(how chir; tasty; literally: good to eat)
 hâowán (how wahn; fun, interesting; literally: good to play)
 hâokàn (how kahn; pretty, interesting; literally: good to look at or watch.
This can apply to people or even movies.)
You may be tempted to ch∫(chir; eat) your soup in a Chinese restaurant, but
you should actually h√(huh; drink) it instead. If it tastes really good, you can
say the soup is hên hâoh√(hun how huh; very tasty), just like anything else
you may have ordered to drink.

George, Susan, and Rhoda are all eating dim sum during their trip

Dim sum wô d∂u xîhu≈n ch∫.
Nah hun nahn shwaw. Boo shir gwaw tyeh jyoe shir
shyah jyaow bah. Deem sum waw doe she hwahn
chir.
It’s difficult to say. If not pork dumplings then defi-
nitely shrimp dumplings. I love all dim sum dishes.
If you want to ask if someone has ever done something, use the word guò
(gwaw) directly after the verb to get your point across. Nî qù guò Mêiguó
méiyôu? (nee chew gwaw may gwaw mayo; Have you ever been to America?)
Nî ch∫guò Yìdàlì fàn ma? (nee chir gwaw ee dah lee fahn ma; Have you ever
eaten Italian food?) So, have you ever used the particle guò?
Some verbs in Chinese have two syllables. Yào (yaow; to want) is not one of
them. Xîhu≈n (she hwan; to like or to want), on the other shôu (show; hand),
is an example. When Chinese people speak quickly, they may leave out the
second syllable in a few bisyllabic verbs and even a few auxiliary verbs the
first time they come up in the “verb-bù-verb” pattern (“bù” between two
verbs automatically creates a question). So instead of saying “T≈xîhu≈n
bùxîhu≈n h√jiû?” (tah she hwan boo she hwan huh jyo; Does he or she like to
drink wine?), you may hear someone say “T≈xî bùxîhu≈n h√jiû?” (tah she
boo she hwan huh jyoe)
Taking Your Chinese to Go
Restaurants are great, but once in a while you may want to mingle with the
masses as people go about buying food for a home-cooked family dinner.
Outdoor food markets abound in China and are great places to see how the
locals shop and what they buy. And what better way to try out your Chinese?
You can always point to what you want and discover the correct term for it
from the vendor.
In addition to clothes, books, and kitchen utensils, outdoor markets may
offer all sorts of food items:
 Ròu (row; meat): niúròu (nyoe row; beef), yángròu (yahng row; lamb), or
j∫ròu (jee row; chicken)
 Yú (yew; fish): xi≈(shyah; shrimp), pángxiè (pahng shyeh; crab), lóngxi≈
(loong shyah; lobster), or yóuyú (yo yew; squid)
 Shuîguô (shway gwaw; fruit): píngguô (peeng gwaw; apples) or júzi (jyew
dzuh; oranges)
102
Part II: Chinese in Action 

Chinese people generally don’t eat any raw food. The idea of a raw salad bar
is truly foreign to them. In fact, sh√ngcài (shung tsye; lettuce) literally trans-
lates as raw food, and the Chinese generally consider it fit only for farm
animals.
Sizing up weights and measures
The metric system is standard in both mainland China and Taiwan. The basic
unit of weight is the g∂ngkè (goong kuh; gram), so you usually buy fruits and
vegetables in multiples of that measure. The standard liquid measurement is
the sh√ng (shung; liter). One liter equals about 1.06 quarts. Table 5-8 gives
you a list of weights and measures.

Chapter 5: Eating and Drinking: G≈nb√i!

Although the Chinese use the metric system, more often than not you
encounter traditional measurement terms that predate the metric system,
such as the words cún (tswun) for “inch” and chî (chir) for “foot.”
Making comparisons
When you want to compare people or objects, you generally put the word bî
(bee; compared to) between two nouns, followed by an adjective: A bî B
(Adjective). This means A is more ____ than B.
Here are a few examples:
 Píngguô bî júzi hâoch∫. (peeng gwaw bee jyew dzuh how chir; Apples are
tastier than oranges.)
 Zhèige fànguâr bî nèige fànguâr guì. (jay guh fahn gwar bee nay guh
fahng gwar gway; This restaurant is more expensive than that one.)
 T≈bî nî niánq∫ng. (tah bee nee nyan cheeng; She’s younger than you.)
How much is that thousand-year-old egg?
When you’re ready to buy some merchandise after making all the necessary
comparisons, here are two simple ways to ask how much the products cost:
 Du∂shâo qián? (dwaw shaow chyan; How much money is it?)
 Jîkuài qián? (jee kwye chyan; literally: How many dollars does it cost?)
The only difference between the two questions is the implied amount of the
cost. If you use the question word “du∂shâo” (dwaw shaow), you want to
inquire about something that’s most likely greater than $10.00. If you use “jî”
in front of kuài (kwye; the term for dollars), you assume the product costs
less than $10.00.
You can also use jî in front of suì (sway; years) when you want to know how
old a child under 10 is. You say, “T≈jî suì?” (tah jee sway; How old is he [or
she]?)

Talkin’ the Talk
At the local open-air market in Kaifeng, Lindsey and Adam eye
some vegetables and discuss the price with the older man selling
them in his stall. Sh∫fu (shir foo) is a term used to indicate someone
providing a service, and indicates more respect due to age than the
term fúwùyuán (foo woo ywan), meaning any kind of attendant.
Lindsey:

Shopping Made Easy
In This Chapter
 Checking out the stores
 Looking for clothes and other items
 Bargaining for a better price
E
ver dreamed of shopping till you dropped in a foreign country where the
rate of exchange is really great? Or in faraway lands where lively outdoor
night markets abound? This chapter helps you navigate both small shops and
fancy department stores; get a handle on prices, colors, and merchandise;
and in general negotiate the best deal wherever possible.
To mâi d∂ngxi (my doong she; buy things) is one of the most enjoyable pas-
times for people the world over. Whether you’re just going guàngsh≈ngdiàn
(gwahng shahng dyan; window shopping) or actually about to mâi d∂ngxi
doesn’t matter. You can still enjoy looking at all the sh≈ngpîn (shahng peen;
merchandise), fantasizing about buying that zuànshí jièzhi (dzwan shir jye jir;
diamond ring), and haggling over the jiàgé (jyah guh; price).
Going to Stores
If you don’t have a clue how to begin shopping in China, much less what you
want to buy, you might want to start off at one of the many bâihuò sh≈ngdiàn
(bye hwaw shahng dyan; department stores) that have sprouted up through-
out China in the last decade. Here you can get almost anything you’re looking
for, from zh∆bâo (joo baow; jewelry) and hu≈píng (hwah peeng; vases) to
y∫fu (ee foo; clothing) and yuèqì (yweh chee; musical instruments).
Department stores aren’t the only places you can shop, but they’re certainly
the easiest because everything is right there within walking distance and you
can browse without fighting off vendors trying to push their wares. Or you
might be someone who actually enjoys all the haggling that goes on at street
fairs and prefers to experience a lively outdoor cài shìchâng (tsye shir
chahng; food market).

Even though traditional alley markets and shop fronts still exist in China,
Western-style shopping malls are quickly putting their imprint on places like
Beijing and Shanghai. You can still get the best prices, though, at the many
open-air markets and street vendors, which sell traditional arts and crafts
and other specialties. Beijing’s #1 shopping area is not far from Ti≈n’≈nmén
Square (tyan ahn mun) Square on Wángfûjîng (wahng foo jeeng) and
D∂ngd≈n (doong dahn) streets. Or on Jiànguóménwài Dàji√(jyan gwaw mun
why dah jyeh).
Here are some types of stores and the things you can find in them:
 Zài yíge sh∆diàn nî kéyî mâi sh∆, zázhì hé bàozhî. (dzye ee guh shoo
dyan nee kuh yee my shoo, dzah jir huh baow jir; In a bookstore, you can
buy books, magazines, and newspapers.)
 Zài yíge wûj∫n diàn nî kéyî mâi zhuânji√qì, ch≈tóu hé y≈nwù bàojîng
qì. (dzye ee guh woo jeen dyan nee kuh yee my jwan jyeh chee, chah toe
huh yan woo baow jeeng chee; In a hardware store, you can buy adap-
tors, plugs, and smoke detectors.)
 Zài yíge y≈ncâo diàn nî kéyî mâi xuêji≈y≈n, xi≈ngy≈n, y≈ndôu hé
gèzhông gèyàng de y≈ncâo. (dzye ee guh yan tsaow dyan nee kuh yee my
shyweh jyah yan, shyahng yan, yan doe huh guh joong guh yahng duh yan
tsaow; In a tobacco shop, you can buy cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and all
kinds of tobacco.)
 Zài yíge zh∆bâo diàn nî kéyî mâi shôuzhuó, êrhuán, xiàngliàn,
xi∂ngzh√n hé jièzhi. (dzye ee guh joo baow dyan nee kuh yee my show
jwaw, are hwahn, shyahng lyan, shyoong juhn huh jyeh jir; In a jewelry
store, you can buy bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pins, and rings.)
When you finally make up your mind about what to shop for, you may want to
call ahead to check out the store’s hours. Here are some questions that can
be of help:
 Nín jî diân zh∂ng k≈i/gu≈n mén? (neen jee dyan joong kye/gwahn mun;
What time do you open/close?)
 Nîmen wûdiân zh∂ng yîhòu hái k≈i ma? (nee men woo dyan joong ee
hoe hi kye mah; Are you open after 5 p.m.?)
 Nîmen x∫ngq∫ti≈n k≈i bùk≈i? (nee mun sheeng chee tyan kye boo kye;
Are you open on Sundays?)
Most stores in China are open quite early, around 8 a.m., and don’t close until
8 p.m. or even later. If you want a less harried shopping experience, avoid
shopping on the weekends, when seemingly a quarter of humanity is out
doing the same thing.

Whenever you see the words “yìdiân d∂u bú___” (ee dyan doe boo ___)
before an adjective, it means not at all (adjective). It’s a great way to empha-
size something. You can say something like Wô yìdiân d∂u búlèi (waw ee
dyan doe boo lay; I’m not tired in the least.) or T≈yìdiân d∂u búpiàoliàng
(Tah ee dyan doe boo pyaow lyahng; She’s not at all pretty.) to get your point

But what if you really do want help? First, you’d better look around for that

You can use two classifiers when it comes to clothing: jiàn and tiáo.
Classifiers are the words used in between a number or the words this or that
and the clothing you’re talking about. Jiàn is used when you’re talking about
clothing worn on the upper part of the body, and tiáo is used for clothes
worn on the lower part. So you’d say yíjiàn chènsh≈n (ee jyan chun shahn;
one shirt) or s≈ntiáo kùzi (sahn tyaow koo dzuh; three pairs of pants).
Shopping for Clothes
Going shopping for clothes is an art — one requiring lots of patience and for-
titude, not to mention lots of new vocabulary if you’re going to do it in
Chinese. You need to know how to ask for your own size, how to see whether
something is available in a different color or fabric, and in general how to
compare apples and oranges (or at least skirts and shirts).
What’s your size?
If you ask for clothing in the dàxiâo (dah shyaow; size) you’re used to quoting
in the United States when you’re in Taiwan or mainland China, you’ll be in for
a surprise. The numbers you generally throw out when talking to salespeople
in the United States are vastly different from the ones you’ll have to get used
to using when dealing with Chinese sizes.

Here are some useful phrases you might want to know:
 Nín chu≈n du∂dà hào? (neen chwan dwaw dah how; What size are you?)
 Dàxiâo búduì. (dah shyaow boo dway; It’s the wrong size.)
 Hên hésh√n. (hun huh shun; It fits really well.)
 Zài Mêiguó wôde chîcùn shì wû hào. (dzye may gwaw waw duh chir
tswun shir woo how; In America I wear a size 5.)
Instead of using the word dàxiâo (dah shyaow; size), you can say things like
 Wô chu≈n s≈nshíq∫hào. (waw chwahn sahn shir chee how; I wear a
size 37.)
 Nín chu≈n jî hào de chènsh≈n? (neen chwahn jee how duh chun shahn;
What size shirt do you wear?)
 Wô chu≈n xiâohào. (waw chwahn shyaow how; I wear a size small.)
Of course, you can always guess your approximate size just by indicating
you’d like to see something in one of the following categories:
 xiâo (shyaow; small)
 zh∂ng (joong; medium)
 dà (dah; large)

Comparing quality: Good, better, best
When you want to let loose with a superlative in order to say something is
absolutely the best — or, for that matter, the worst —always keep this one
little word in mind: zuì (dzway) which means the most (it’s the equivalent of
the suffix -est).
Zuì is a word just waiting for something to follow it; otherwise it won’t have
much meaning. Here are some superlatives you may need to use from time
to time:
 zuì lèi (dzway lay; the most tired)
 zuì màn (dzway mahn; the slowest)
 zuì máng (dzway mahng; the busiest)
 zuì qíguài (dzway chee gwye; the strangest)
 zuì yôumíng (dzway yo meeng; the most famous)
 zuì yôuqián (dzway yo chyan; the richest)
If you just want to say that something is better than something else, or “more”
something, rather than the best necessarily, you use the word gèng (guhng)
before an adjective. You can consider these the equivalent of the suffix -er.
Another word that has the meaning of more or -er is yìdiân (ee dyan; or ee
dyan). While the term gèng comes before an adjective, the term yìdiân must
appear after it. Instead of saying gèng kuài (gung kwye; faster), for example,
you’d say kuài yìdiân (kwye ee dyan) to mean faster.
Here are some examples:
 gèng c∂ngmíng (guhng tsoong meeng; smarter)
 gèng guì (guhng gway; more expensive)
 piány∫yìdiân (pyan yee ee dyan; cheaper)
 gèng kuài (guhng kwye; faster)
 gèng màn (guhng mahn; slower)
 hâo (how; good)
 gèng hâo (guhng how; better)
 zuì hâo (dzway how; best)
 duân yìdiân (dwahn ee dyan; shorter)
 cháng yìdiân (chahng ee dyan; longer)
118
Part II: Chinese in Action 

 xiâo yìdiân (shyaow ee dyan; smaller)
 dà yìdiân (dah ee dyan; larger)
 gèng piányì (gung pyan yee; cheaper)
Comparing two items
The simplest way to compare two items is by using the coverb (the part of
speech akin to a preposition) bî (bee; compared with) in between the two
things you’re comparing, followed by an adjective. If you say A bî B hâo
(A bee B how) you’re saying A is better than B.
Here are some ways to make comparisons with bî:
 T≈bî wô lâo. (tah bee waw laow; She’s older than me.)
 Zhèige w∆zi bî nèige dà. (jay guh woo dzuh bee nay guh dah; This room
is bigger than that one.)
 Hóngde bî huángde hâo. (hoong duh bee hwahng duh how; The red one
is better than the yellow one.)
One way to convey similarity between two things is to use the coverbs g√n
(gun) or hé (huh) in between the two things being compared, followed by the
word yíyàng (ee yahng; the same) and then the adjective. So if you say A g√n
B yíyàng dà (A gun B ee yahng dah), you’re saying that A and B are equally
large or as big as each other. You can also just say A g√n B yíyàng, meaning A
and B are the same. Here are some other things you can say with this sen-
tence pattern:
 G√ge hé dìdi yíyàng g≈o. (guh guh huh dee dee ee yahng gaow; My older
brother is as tall as my younger brother.
 M≈o g√n gôu yíyàng tiáopí. (maow gun go ee yahng tyaow pee; Cats are
just as naughty as dogs.)
 Wô g√n nî yíyàng dà. (waw gun nee ee yahng dah; You and I are the
same age.)
So what if you want to make a negative comparison, such as I’m not as tall as
him? For that you’d have to use the following sentence pattern:
A méiyôu B nèmme adjective
119
Chapter 6: Shopping Made Easy

The means “A is not as (adjective) as B.” You can see this pattern in action in
the following sentences:
 Sh≈yú méiyôu j∫nyú nèmme kê’ài. (shah yew mayo jeen yew nummuh
kuh eye; Sharks are not as cute as goldfish.)
 Y∫ngwén méiyôu Zh∂ngwén nèmme nán. (eeng one mayo joong one
nummuh nahn; English is not as difficult as Chinese.)
 M≈o de wêiba méiyôu tùzi de wêiba nèmme c∆. (maow duh way bah
mayo too dzuh duh way bah nummuh tsoo; Cats’ tails aren’t as thick as
the tails of rabbits.)

What are you wearing? Chu≈n versus dài
Dài (dye) and chu≈n (chwan) both mean to wear, but they’re used for differ-
ent types of things you put on your body. In English, you can say you’re
“wearing” everything from hats to socks to skirts or even a necklace. In
Chinese, though, you can only dài things like màozi (maow dzuh; hats), 
yânjìng (yan jeeng; glasses), and xiézi (shyeh dzuh; shoes) — in other words,
articles more akin to accessories rather than actual clothing, but you chu≈n
things like qúnzi (chewn dzuh; skirts) and dày∫(dah ee; coats).
Here are some things you can chu≈n:
 bèix∫n (bay sheen; vest)
 chángkù (chahng koo; pants; also referred to simply as kùzi)
 chángxiù (chahng shyow; long sleeve)
 chènsh≈n (chun shahn; blouse)

Asking about the color
When you go shopping for y∫fu (ee foo; clothes), you have a chance to com-
pare all the different yánsè (yan suh; colors) they come in and choose the
one that looks the best on you. Do you generally prefer d≈nsè (dahn suh;
solid colors) or hu≈(hwah; patterned) shirts? How about h√i (hey; black)
hats or fênhóng (fun hoong; pink) skirts? Whatever your clothing preferences
are, after you know how to express your heart’s desire with the correct word,
you can be sure to ask for what you like.
The following is a list of handy words the next time you go shopping either
for clothes or for material to create your own. Shénme yánsè (shummuh yan
suh; what color) is your favorite from the list below? Don’t be shy to speak up
about your preferences. If someone wants you to wear pink with purple polka
dots to a wedding, you can always politely just say, “Yánsè búduì” (yan suh
boo dway; the color is wrong) and leave it at that.
 bái (bye; white)
 f√nhóng (fun hoong; pink)
 h√i (hey; black)
 hóng (hoong; red)
 huáng (hwahng; yellow)
 júhóng (jyew hoong; orange)
 lán (lahn; blue)
 zî (dzuh; purple)

 k≈ishìmî (kye shir mee; cashmere)
 liàozi (lyaow dzuh; fabric)

hóngde (hoong duh; the red one), dà de (dah duh; the big one), tián de (tyan
duh; the sweet one), and so on.

Hunting for antiques
One of the best places in the world to go searching for gûdông (goo doong;
antiques) is — you guessed it — China. Gûdông diàn (goo doong dyan;
antique shops) abound in major cities near large stores and in small alley-
ways. You can buy everything from 200-year-old di≈okè pîn (dyaow kuh peen;
carved objects) to 100-year-old bí y≈n hú (bee yan who; snuff bottles). You
can find all sorts of rare things.
After you find the perfect antique item, though, you need to deal with all the
possible export restrictions, like for porcelain that is older than 200 years or
some types of rare wood products. You have to have a red wax seal put on
the item in order to legally take it out of China. The cultural artifacts bureau
of the city in which you buy the item must apply the seal.
Slightly southwest of Ti≈n’≈nmén Square in Beijing lies Liúlìchâng (lyoe lee
chahng), an area considered the best in the city for antiques and other tradi-
tional arts and crafts. In Shanghai, the D∂ngtái (doong tye) antiques market
is the one to look for, not far from Huáihâi Lù (hwye hi loo). There’s even a
Ghost Market in the Old Town Bazaar where folks go for weekend antique
shopping. The Ghost Market is so named because of the ungodly hour the
vendors begin setting up shop — a time before sunrise when only ghosts can
check out what’s on sale. If you purchase antiques in China, you need to have
a red wax seal applied by the local cultural artifacts bureau before you can
legally take it out of the country. Even though you’re dealing with antiques,
you’re still allowed to haggle over the price, so don’t be shy trying to get the
best deal possible.
Here are some words and phrases that should come in handy when hunting
for antiques:
 Zhèi shì nêige cháodài de? (jay shir nay guh chaow dye duh; Which
dynasty is this from?)
 Néng dài ch∆guó ma? (nung dye choo gwaw mah; Can it be taken out of
China?)
 Nîde gûdông dìtân zài nâr? (nee duh goo doong dee tahn dzye nar;

 Kéyî bùkéyî ji≈zhúnxû ch∆guó de huôq∫yìn? (kuh yee boo kuh yee jyah

Getting a Good Price and Paying
Folks the world over want to get good deals on their purchases. At least they
should. This section helps you discover the joys (and pitfalls) of haggling in
Chinese. 
Negotiating prices at the night market
Among the more fun things to do in Taiwan and mainland China is visit one of
the many lively night markets that abound. There, you can find anything from
clothing and jewelry to antiques and food. Because the Chinese love to mâi
d∂ngxi (my doong she; shop) and tâojià huánjià (taow jyah hwahn jyah;
haggle), you’ll have plenty of company on your sojourns.
You should always assume that prices are negotiable in an open air market.
You can always ask one of the following and see what happens:
 Néng bùnéng piányì yìdiâr? (nung boo nung pyan yee ee dyar; Can you
sell it more cheaply?)
 Néng bùnéng shâo yìdiâr? (nung boo nung shaow ee dyar; Can you lower
the price?)
Or you can always play hardball and say something like Zênme zhèmma
guì ah? (dzuh muh juh muh gway ah; Why is this so expensive?) in an exas-
perated voice, start walking away and see what happens. (Bet they come
back with a lower price.)
126
Part II: Chinese in Action 

These haggling-related phrases are also worth knowing:
 Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u Mêiyuán? (nee men show boo show may ywan; Do
you accept U.S. dollars?)
 Zhèige du∂shâo qián? (jay guh dwaw shaow chyan; How much is this?)
 Dâ zhé, hâo bùhâo? (dah juh, how boo how; How about giving me a
discount?)
 Kéyî jiâng jià ma? (kuh yee jyahng jyah mah; Can we negotiate the price?)
If you see something called a Yôuyí Sh≈ngdiàn (yo ee shahng dyan;
Friendship Store) be aware that it is one of the ubiquitous state-run stores in
China, so prices are generally fixed. However, bargaining is the norm every-
where else. Beware of goods with no prices marked on them! If you ask about
them, you’ll probably be quoted a price far different than that charged to the
locals. Often you’ll be able to have 5 to 10 percent taken off any price quoted
verbally, so try to practice bargaining before you set foot in a street market.
Paying for your purchase
(or demanding a refund)
When you finish checking out all the merchandise, haggling (or not) over the
price, and deciding on just what to mâi (my; buy), you’ll probably start reach-
ing for your qiánb≈o (chyan baow; wallet) to see whether you should take out
your xìnyòng kâ (sheen yoong kah; credit card) or some xiànqián (shyan
chyan; cash) or, if you got a really good deal, just some língqián (leeng chyan;
small change). When you fùqián (foo chyan; pay), you might also want to get
a sh∂ujù (show jyew; receipt).
If you end up being bùyúkuài (boo yew kwye; unhappy) about your purchase,
one of these phrases may come in handy when you try to tuì (tway; return)
your huò (hwaw; merchandise):
 Wô y≈oqiú tuìkuân. (waw yaow chyo tway kwahn; I want a refund.)
 Wô yào tuì huò. (waw yaow tway hwaw; I would like to return this.)
 Qîng nî bâ qián jìrù wôde xìnyòng kâ. (cheeng nee bah chyan jee roo
waw duh sheen yoong kah; Please refund my credit card.)
 Wô néng bùnéng jiàn zôngj∫nglî? (waw nung boo nung jyan dzoong
jeeng lee; May I see the manager?)
 Qîng nî b≈o qîlái. (cheeng nee baow chee lye; Please wrap these/this.)
 Duì wô bù hésh√n. (dway waw boo huh shun; It doesn’t fit me.)

when you can sleep late and go see a diànyîng (dyan yeeng; movie) in the
evening with friends? Or is it x∫ngq∫y∫(sheeng chee ee; Monday), when you
have to be at work by jiû diân zh∂ng (jyo dyan joong; 9:00) in the morning to
prepare for a 10 a.m. k≈i huì (kye hway; meeting)? Or maybe it’s x∫ngq∫wû
(sheeng chee woo; Friday) and you already have liâng zh≈ng piào (lyahng
jahng pyaow; two tickets) for the ji≈oxiâng yuè (jyow shyahng yweh; sym-
phony) that begins at wânshàng b≈diân (wahn shahng bah dyan; 8 p.m.).

Talking about days, weeks, 
months, and more
You may not be a big fan of going to work from x∫ngq∫y∫(sheeng chee ee;
Monday) to x∫ngq∫wû (sheeng chee woo; Friday), but when the zh∂umò
(joe maw; weekend) comes, you have two days of freedom and fun. Before
you know it, though, x∫ngq∫y∫comes again.
The days of the week
Although Chinese people recognize seven days in the week just as Americans
do, the Chinese week begins on x∫ngq∫y∫(sheeng chee ee; Monday) and ends
on x∫ngq∫ti≈n (sheeng chee tyan; Sunday). If you’re talking about zhèige
x∫ngq∫(jay guh sheeng chee; this week) in Chinese, you’re talking about any
time between this past Monday through this coming Sunday. Anything earlier
is considered shàngge x∫ngq∫(shahng guh sheeng chee; last week). Any day
after this coming Sunday is automatically part of xiàge x∫ngq∫(shyah guh
sheeng chee; next week). See Table 7-1 for a list of days of the week.

The months and seasons
Days don’t exist in a vacuum — or even just in a week — and weeks exist
within months. So if you don’t just want to say today is Monday, but rather
Monday, June 1st, you have to say the yuè (yweh; month) before the day and
end with the day of the week:
 liùyuè y∫hào, x∫ngq∫y∫(lyo yweh ee how, sheeng chee ee; Monday, 
June 1st)
 sìyuè èr hào, x∫ngq∫ti≈n (suh yweh are how, sheeng chee tyan; Sunday,
April 2nd)
The larger unit of the month always comes before the smaller unit of the date
in Chinese:
 y∫yuè èr hào (ee yweh are how; January 2nd)
 s≈nyuè sì hào (sahn yweh suh how; March 4th)
 shí’èryuè s≈nshí hào (shir are yweh sahn shir how; December 30th)
To ask what today’s date is, you simply say j∫nti≈n jîyuè jîhào? (jin tyan jee
yweh jee how; literally: Today is what month and what day?)
Even though you say each month by adding the number of the month in front
of the word yuè (which means “month”), if you add the classifier ge (guh) in
between the number and the word yuè, you say “one month,” “two months,”
and so on. For example, b≈yuè (bah yweh) means August (which is the 8th
month), but b≈ge yuè (bah guh yweh) means eight months.
The same basic idea goes for saying the days of the week. All you have to do
is add the number of the day of the week (Monday: Day #1), preceded by the
word lîbài (lee bye) or x∫ngq∫(sheeng chee), meaning “week,” to say the day
you mean. The only exception is Sunday, when you have to add the word ti≈n
(tyan; heaven, or day) in place of a number. Wôde ti≈n! (waw duh tyan; My
heavens!) Isn’t this easy?

Telling time in Chinese
All you have to do to find out the shíji≈n (shir jyan; time) is take a peek at your
shôubiâo (show byaow; watch) or look at the zh∂ng (joong; clock) on the wall.
These days, even your jìsuànj∫(jee swan jee; computer) or shôuj∫(show jee;
cell phone) show the time. And you can always revert to that beloved luòdìshì
dà bâizh∂ng (lwaw dee shir dah bye joong; grandfather clock) in your parents’
living room. You no longer have any excuse to chídào (chir daow; be late),
especially if you own a nào zh∂ng (now joong; alarm clock)!
You can express time in Chinese by using the words diân (dyan; hour) and
f√n (fun; minute). Isn’t using f√n fun? You can even talk about time in miâo
(meow; seconds) if you like and sound like a cat. Table 7-4 shows you how to
prounounce all the hours on the clock.
You can indicate the hour by saying 3-diân or 3-diân zh∂ng. Diân (dyan)
means “hour,” but it’s also a classifier, and zh∂ng (joong) means “clock.” Feel
free to use either to say what time it is.

Chapter 7: Exploring the Town

When mentioning 12 o’clock, be careful! The way to say noon is simply
zh∂ngwû (joong woo), and the way to say midnight is bànyè (bahn yeh).
The Chinese are very precise when they tell time. You can’t just say 3-diân
zh∂ng (sahn dyan joong) when you want to say 3 o’clock. Do you mean to say
q∫ngzâo s≈n diân zh∂ng (cheeng dzaow sahn dyan joong; 3 a.m.) or xiàwû
s≈ndiân zh∂ng (shyah woo sahn dyan joong; 3 p.m.)?
The segment of the day that you refer to needs to come before the actual
time itself in Chinese. Here’s a list of the major segments of the day:
 q∫ngzâo (cheeng dzaow; midnight to dawn)
 zâoshàng (dzaow shahng; 6 a.m. to noon)
 xiàwû (shyah woo; noon to 6 p.m.)
 wânshàng (wahn shahng; 6 p.m. to midnight)
Here are some samples of combining the segment of the day with the time 
of day:
 wânshàng q∫diân zh∂ng (wahn shahng chee dyan joong; 7 p.m.)
 xiàwû s≈n diân bàn (shyah woo sahn dyan bahn; 3:30 p.m.)
 q∫ngzâo yì diân yí kè (cheeng dzaow ee dyan ee kuh; 1:15 a.m.)
 zâoshàng b≈diân èrshíwû f√n (dzaow shahng bah dyan are shir woo fun;
8:25 a.m.)
If you want to indicate half an hour, just add bàn (bahn; half) after the hour:
 3-diân bàn (sahn dyan bahn; 3:30)
 4-diân bàn (suh dyan bahn; 4:30)
 11-diân bàn (shir ee dyan bahn; 11:30)
Do you want to indicate a quarter of an hour or three quarters of an hour?
Just use the phrases yí kè (ee kuh) and s≈n kè (sahn kuh) after the hour:
 2-diân yí kè (lyahng dyan ee kuh; 2:15)
 4-diân yí kè (suh dyan ee kuh; 4:15)
 5-diân s≈n kè (woo dyan sahn kuh; 5:45)
 7-diân s≈n kè (chee dyan sahn kuh; 7:45)
136
Part II: Chinese in Action 

Of course, you have other ways to indicate time in Chinese. On the hour, half
hour, and quarter of an hour aren’t the only parts of time which exist, after
all. For example, instead of saying q∫diân wûshí f√n (chee dyan woo shir fun;
7:50), you can say b≈diân chà shí f√n (bah dyan chah shir fun; 10 to 8; liter-
ally: 8 o’clock minus 10 minutes). “Chà” (chah) means “to lack.” Unlike f√n
(fun; minute), kè (kuh; quarter of an hour), and bàn (bahn; half), you can use
chà either before or after diân (dyan; hour).
Here are some other examples of alternative ways to indicate the time:
 chà shí f√n wû diân (chah shir fun woo dyan; 10 to 5)
 wû diân chà shí f√n (woo dyan chah shir fun; 10 to 5)
 sì diân wûshí f√n (suh dyan woo shir fun; 4:50)
 chà yí kè q∫diân (chah ee kuh chee dyan; a quarter to 7)
 q∫diân chà yí kè (chee dyan chah ee kuh; a quarter to 7)
 liù diân s≈n kè (lyo dyan sahn kuh; 6:45)
 liù diân sìshíwû f√n (lyo dyan suh shir woo fun; 6:45)
When talking about time, you may prefer to say before or after a certain hour.
To do so, you use either yîqián (ee chyan; before) or yîhòu (ee ho; after)
along with the time, day, month, or anything else. Here are some examples:
 xiàwû 3-diân zh∂ng yîqián (shyah woo sahn dyan joong ee chyan; before
3:00 p.m.)
 q∫ngzâo 4-diân bàn yîhòu (cheeng dzaow suh dyan bahn ee ho; after 
4:30 a.m.)
 sìyuè yîqián (suh yweh ee chyan; before April)
 xiàge x∫ngq∫yîhòu (shyah guh sheeng chee ee ho; after next week)
 wûyuè s≈n hào yîqián (woo yweh sahn how ee chyan; before May 3rd)

Attending a Performance
Plan on taking in a few yânch∆(yan choo; shows) in the near future? You
have so much to choose from nowadays. You can check out some g√jù (guh
jyew; operas), or, if you prefer, a b≈léi (bah lay; ballet) or a y∫nyuèhuì (yin
yweh hway; music concert).
Shanghai in particular is pretty famous for its zájì tuán (dzah jee twahn;
acrobatics troupes).
138
Part II: Chinese in Action 

Before you can attend any performances, however, or even try to catch a
diànyîng (dyan yeeng; movie), you have to buy a piào (pyaow; ticket) or two.
The following phrases should help you get what you want, or at least under-
stand what you’re being told:
 Zài nâr kéyî mâidào piào? (dzye nar kuh yee my daow pyaow; Where
can I buy tickets?)
 Yôu méiyôu j∫nti≈n wânshàng yânch∆de piào? (yo mayo jin tyan wahn
shahng yan choo duh pyaow; Are there any tickets to tonight’s perfor-
mance?)
 Duìbùqî, j∫nti≈n wânshàng de piào d∂u màiwán le. (dway boo chee, jin
tyan wahn shahng duh pyaow doe my wahn luh; I’m sorry, tickets for

 Wô yào mâi yì zh≈ng dàrén piào, liâng zh≈ng értóng piào. (waw yaow
my ee jahng dah run pyaow, lyahng jahng are toong pyaow; I’d like to buy
one adult ticket and two kid’s tickets.)
If you want to ask a person if he or she has ever done anything, just add the
particle –guò (gwaw) to the verb and use the question word ma (mah) or
méiyôu (mayo) at the end. Here are some examples:
 Nî kànguò J∫ngjù ma? (nee kahn gwaw jeeng jyew mah; Have you ever
seen Peking Opera?)
 Nî ch∫guò xi≈méiyôu? (nee chir gwaw shyah mayo; Have you ever eaten
shrimp?)
 Nî qùguò Mêiguó ma? (nee chyew gwaw may gwaw mah; Have you ever
been to America?)
139
Chapter 7: Exploring the Town
Take a peek at Peking Opera
Have you ever been to J∫ngjù (jeeng jyew;
Peking Opera)? This Chinese opera is one of the
most beloved art forms in China, with a history
of over 200 years. The opera is a great specta-
cle of music, song, and acrobatics, telling and
retelling great works of Chinese history and lit-
erature. Performances abound, especially
during the traditional festivals when everyone
is off of work.
Even though its title is Peking (Beijing) Opera, it
actually originated in the Anhui and Hubei
provinces. Originally staged for the royal family,
it came to Beijing in 1790 and later became
familiar to the general public. Thousands of
local branches of Chinese Opera exist, each
with a unique dialect. Opera is the one art form
in a country of over a billion people that appeals
to every strata of society.

To answer any these questions, you can repeat the verb plus guò if the
answer is yes, or simply say méiyôu, meaning “No, I haven’t.” You can also
say méiyôu — verb — guò if you like.
If you happen to do something chángcháng (chahng chahng; often) or just
yôude shíhòu (yo duh shir ho; sometimes), don’t be shy about saying so. You
can use these adverbs in both the questions and the answers.

Exploring Museums and Galleries
Theatre shows and live musical performances aren’t the only forms of enter-
tainment you can see to get your fill of wénhuà (one hwah; culture). One of
the nicest, calmest activities to do at your own pace is to visit a bówùguân
(baw woo gwahn; museum) or huàláng (hwah lahng; gallery). You can check
out anything from gûdàide yìshù pîn (goo dye duh ee shoo peen; ancient arti-
facts), to sh≈nshuî huà (shahn shway hwah; landscape painting), to xiàndài
yìshù (shyan dye ee shoo; modern art). Sometimes the best reason to go to a
bówùguân is to buy some lîwù (lee woo; gifts) and some cool zh≈oti√(jaow
tyeh; posters) for yourself.
Here are some questions you may want to ask in a museum or gallery:
 Bówùguân jîdiân zh∂ng k≈imén? (baw woo gwahn jee dyan joong kye
mun; What time does the museum open?)

From sex to art: Interesting Chinese museums
The Museum of Ancient Chinese Sex Culture,
which opened in Shanghai in 1999, displays the
private collection of a Shanhghai University pro-
fessor. The collection contains all sorts of
sexual artifacts ranging from ancient tomb
paintings and erotic devices, exhibits dealing
with that old Chinese fetish footbinding, and
even furniture for lovemaking.
The Shanghai Museum, which opened at
People’s Plaza in 1996, is a world-class museum.
Considered China’s top museum, it consists of
four stories of 11 galleries with audiophones
and explanatory signs in English as well as
Chinese — a rare feature in any other Chinese
museum. Arranged by themes rather than
dynasties, it houses everything from ancient
bronzes, to Tang and Ming ceramics, to paint-
ings and calligraphy. It has an impressive jade
gallery as well.

Visiting Historical Sites
You shouldn’t pass up at least one well-coordinated trip to a historical site if
you visit China, even if you have only a week for business. Take the Cháng
Chéng (chahng chung; Great Wall), for example. Just north of Beijing, the wall
is one of the greatest man-made objects on earth.
And while you’re on your way to the Great Wall, you may want to stop off at
the Míng shís≈n líng (meeng shir sahn leeng; Ming Tombs), which contain the
mausoleums of thirteen Ming dynasty (1368-1644) emperors guarded by
stone animals and warrior statues.
By far the easiest way to see the major historical sites in China is to join a
tour. Here are some phrases that may come in handy:
 Lhxíngshè zài nâr? (lyew sheeng shuh dzye nar; Where’s the travel
agency?)
 Yôu méiyôu shu∂Y∫ngwén de dâoyóu? (yo mayo shwaw eeng one duh
daow yo; Are there any English speaking guides?)
 Bàn ti≈n du∂shâo qián? (bahn tyan dwaw shaow chyan; How much for
half a day?)
 Nî yôu méiyôu lhyóu shôucè? (nee yo mayo lyew yo show tsuh; Do you
have a guidebook?)
Some of China’s most-visited historical sites include the Great Wall, the
Forbidden City in Beijing, and the terra-cotta warriors of Xi’an, where an
army of over 6,000 carved warriors and horses stands guard over the tomb of
China’s first Emperor, Qin Shihuang (chin shir hwahng), who dates back to the
third century BCE.

Going to the Movies
After a full day of sightseeing, you may want to relax, kick back, and take in a
movie. At the movies you can sit and watch what’s on the yínmù (yeen moo;
screen) without walking or talking. But what to do when the lights dim and
you suddenly realize the film is completely in Zh∂ngwén (joong one;
Chinese), without any Y∫ngwén zìmù (eeng one dzuh moo; English subtitles)
whatsoever? You read this book, of course!

Listening to a Concert
You often hear that the language of music crosses international boundaries. If
you’re feeling a bit exhausted after practicing Chinese, you can head to a con-
cert in the evening where you can relax. Let the music transport you to
another mental space.
At the end of a concert in China, you don’t hear anyone yelling “Encore!”
What you do hear, however, is “Zài lái yíge, zài lái yíge!” (dzye lye ee guh,
dzye lye ee guh; Bring on one more!)

Hopping Around Bars and Clubs
Are you a night owl who, after a full day of sightseeing and even an evening
concert, still has the energy to go bar hopping and carousing around fun
clubs? If so, you need to know some common barspeak, especially when
you’re on vacation in a toddlin’ town like Shanghai — or Chicago, for that
matter. After all, not everyone you meet or go out with may be fluent in
English.
Before the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949, Shanghai was known
as the Paris of the Orient. It has always been the most delightfully decadent
city in China and continues to live up to its reputation. Bars, clubs, and all
sorts of nightlife abound.
The following phrases may come in handy when you’re out exploring the
local pubs and dance halls:
 Qîng lái yìpíng píjiû. (cheeng lye ee peeng pee jyoe; Please bring me a
bottle of beer.)
 Nî xiâng g√n wô tiàowû ma? (nee shyahng gun waw tyaow woo mah;
Would you like to dance?)
 Wô néng bùnéng qîng nî h√jiû? (waw nung boo nung cheeng nee huh
jyoe; May I get you a drink?)
 Wômen dào nâr qù tiàowû? (waw men daow nar chyew tyaow woo;
Where can we go to dance?)
 Yôu méiyôu rùchâng fèi? (yo mayo roo chahng fay; Is there a cover
charge?)
When you go to a bar with friends, you may ask for some b∫ngzhèn de píjiû
(beeng juhn duh pee jyoe; cold beer) or maybe some hóng (hoong; red) or bái
(bye; white) pútáo jiû (poo taow jyoe; wine). And don’t forget to ask for some
hu≈sh√ngmî (hwah shung mee; peanuts) or tûdòupiàn (too doe pyan; potato
chips) so you don’t get too sloshed with all that píjiû.

A
fter a hard day at work, most people are ready to kick back and relax.
But where to begin? Do you feel so consumed by your g∂ngzuò (goong
dzwaw; work) that you can’t seem to switch gears? Get a life! Better yet, get a
yèyú àihào (yeh yew eye how; hobby). Play some y∫nyuè (yeen yweh; music)
on your xiâotíqín (shyaow tee cheen; violin). Paint a huà (hwah; picture). Kick
a zúqiú (dzoo chyo; football) around. Do whatever it takes to make you relax
and have some fun. Your outside interests will make you more interesting to
be around, and you’ll make new friends at the same time — especially if you
join a duì (dway; team). And if you’re into lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketball), just
utter the name Yao Ming (yaow meeng) and you’ll instantly discover hordes
of potential language exchange partners from among the many fans of this
Shanghai native who made it big as a Houston Rockets superstar.
Yao Ming, the 7-foot 6-inch former Shanghai Mavericks basketball player,
earned fame and fortune as an NBA player with the Houston Rockets. With
the 2008 Olympics set to take place in Beijing, basketball is sure to be of keen
interest to the local spectators. If you find yourself in that city, check out the
Sports Bar at the Gloria International Hotel, where basketball takes center
stage.

Naming Your Hobbies
Are you someone who likes to collect yóupiào (yo pyaow; stamps) from dif-
ferent guóji≈(gwaw jyah; countries)? Or do you prefer to play guójì xiàngqí
(gwaw jee shyahng chee; chess) in your spare time? How about watching
some niâo (nyaow; birds) through a pair of wàngyuânjìng (wahng ywan
jeeng; binoculars) in Zh∂ngy≈ng G∂ngyuán (joong yahng goong ywan; Central
Park)? Whatever you enjoy doing, your hobbies are always a good conversa-
tion piece. Having at least one yèyú àihào (yeh yew eye how; hobby) is
always a good thing. How about getting involved in some of the following?
 kàn sh∆(kahn shoo; reading)
 diàoyú (dyaow yew; fishing)
 yuányì (ywan ee; gardening)
 p√ngtiáo (pung tyaow; cooking)
Some of the things you can dâ (dah; do or play with), which literally means to
strike, hit, or beat, are qiú (chyo; balls), tàijíquán (tye jee chwan; commonly
referred to just as Tai Ji, a slow form of martial arts), and pú kè (poo kuh;
cards). But you can also wán (wahn; play) ball games as well — including
games with little qiú, such as p∫ngp≈ngqiú (peeng pahng chyo; ping pong).
Here are some quick questions using the verb dâ that will help get a conver-
sation started:
 Nî huì búhuì dâ tài jí quán? (nee hway boo hway dah tiye jee chwahn;
Do you know how to do Tai Ji?)
 Nî dâ bùdâ p∫ngp≈ngqiú? (nee dah boo dah peeng pahng chyo; Do you
play ping pong?)
 Nî dâ májiàng ma? (nee dah mah jyahng mah; Do you play mah-jong?)
Both tàijíquán and májiàng are quintessential Chinese pastimes. In addition
to tàijíquán, everyone is familiar with other forms of wûshù (woo shoo; mar-
tial arts), including kung fu — a martial art practiced since the Tang (tahng)
dynasty back in the eighth century. In fact, you can still see kung fu masters
practicing at the Shaolin Temple in Zhengzhou, Henan Province — one great
reason for making a trip off the beaten path if you ever visit China.
Tàijíquán is considered an internal martial art and is the most widely prac-
ticed form throughout the world. The term tài jí (“the Great Ultimate”) 
refers to the interplay between opposing yet complementary forces in the
universe — yin and yang — as the basis of creation. Quán means “fist,”
emphasizing that this art is a kind of unarmed combat. Very early every
morning in China, tons of people flock to local parks to practice this slow-
motion form of exercise together.

Exploring Nature
If you’re working overseas in China and want to get really far from the
madding crowds, or even just far enough away from your bàng∂ngshî (bahn
goong shir; office) to feel refreshed, try going to one of the seven sacred sh≈n
(shahn; mountains) or a beautiful hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach) to take in the
sh≈nshuî (shahn shway; scenery), which is sure to include niâo (nyaow;
birds), shù (shoo; trees), yún (yewn; clouds), and the hâi (hi; ocean). You
may want to qù lùyíng (chyew lyew eeng; go camping) or set up camp on the
beach and have a yêc≈n (yeh tsahn; picnic) before you pá sh≈n (pah shahn;
climb a mountain).
Here are some things you would see along the way if you were to travel
through the Chinese countryside:

 bâotâ (baow tah; pagoda)
 miào (meow; temple)
 fómiào (faw meow; Buddhist temple)
 dàomiào (daow meow; Daoist temple)
 kôngmiào (koong meow; Confucian temple)
 dàotián (daow tyan; rice paddies)
 nóngmín (noong meen; farmers)
If you’re ever exploring dàzìrán (dah dzuh rahn; nature) with a friend who
speaks Chinese, a few of these words may come in handy:
 hé (huh; river)
 hú (hoo; lake)
 chítáng (chir tahng; pond)
 sh≈ndòng (shahn doong; cave)
 hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach)
 àn (ahn; shore)
 sh≈mò (shah maw; desert)
 sh≈n (shahn; mountains)
 xiâo sh≈n (shyaow shahn; hills)
 hâi (hi; ocean)

China’s sacred mountains
Both Buddhists and Daoists have traditionally
built monasteries high on quiet mountaintops or
deep inside lush forests to meditate. Nine 
of China’s mountains — five Daoist and four
Buddhist — are still considered sacred today,
all which remain sites of pilgrimage. Huáng
Sh≈n (hwahng shahn; Yellow Mountain) is per-
haps China’s most famous sacred mountain, 
distinguished by rare pine trees, unusual rock
formations, and hot springs, and surrounded by
lakes and waterfalls.

Tapping into Your Artistic Side
You may pride yourself on having been the biggest jock who ever played var-
sity football, but I bet you still get teary-eyed when you see a beautiful painting
or listen to Beethoven. It’s okay, just admit it. You’re a regular Renaissance
man and you can’t help it. No more apologies. 
Okay, now you’re ready to tap into your more sensitive, artistic side in
Chinese. Don’t be afraid of expressing your gânqíng (gahn cheeng; emotions).
The Chinese will appreciate your sensitivity to their Song (soong) dynasty
sh≈nshuî huà (shahn shway hwah; landscape painting) or the beauty of a
Ming (meeng) dynasty cíqì (tsuh chee; porcelain).
I bet you have tons of chuàngzàoxìng (chwahng dzaow sheeng; creativity). If
so, try your hand at one of these fine arts:
 huà (hwah; painting)
 sùmiáohuà (soo meow hwah; drawing)
 di≈okè (dyaow kuh; sculpting)
 shuîcâihuà (shway tsye hwah; watercolor)
 táoqì (taow chee; pottery)
 sh∆fâ (shoo fah; calligraphy)
Striking Up the Band 
Like kids all over the world, lots of Chinese children take xiâo tíqín (shyaow
tee cheen; violin) and g≈ngqín (gahng cheen; piano) classes — often under
duress. They appreciate the forced lessons when they get older, though, and
have their own kids.

The Shanghai Children’s Palace
If you ever visit Shanghai, make time for a visit
to the Shàoniáng∂ng (shaow nyan goong; the
Children’s Palace), where gifted children take
part in an assortment of extracurricular activi-
ties in areas such as music, art, dance, and sci-
ence. Founded in 1953 by Song Qingling, the
wife of the Republic of China’s founder, Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, the Children’s Palace is in a grand old
building originally known as Marble Hall. It was
built by the Baghdadi Jewish tycoon Elly
Kadoorie in 1924 and still boasts grand marble
hallways, winding staircases, ornate fireplaces,
chandeliers, and French windows. 

Do you play a yuè qì (yweh chee; musical instrument)? It’s never too late to
learn, you know. You don’t have to become a professional y∫nyuèji≈(een
yweh jyah; musician) to enjoy playing an instrument. How about trying your
hand (or mouth) at one of these? 
 xiâo tíqín (shyaow tee cheen; violin)
 zh∂ng tíqín (joong tee cheen; viola)
 dà tíqín (dah tee cheen; cello)
 g≈ngqín (gahng cheen; piano)
 s≈kès∫guân (sah kuh suh gwahn; saxophone)
 chángdí (chahng dee; flute)

 gû (goo; drums)
 shùqín (shoo cheen; harp)
 liùxiánqín (lyo shyan cheen; guitar)
The Chinese language has a couple of different verbs that you can use to indi-
cate the practice of various instruments. Those who play stringed instruments
should use the verb l≈(lah; to draw, as in draw a bow) before the name of the
instrument. For example, you can say that you l≈zh∂ng tíqín (lah joong tee
cheen; play the viola), but you can only tán (tahn; play) a g≈ngqín (gahng
cheen; piano). For wind instruments, you have to chu∫(chway; blow) them.

Traditional Chinese Instruments
If you’ve heard any traditional Chinese music at
a concert or on a CD, you’ve probably heard one
of these Chinese yuè qì (yweh chee; musical
instruments) at one point or another:
 pípa (pee pah; a plucked string instru-
ment with a fretted fingerboard that sits on
your lap)
 gûzh√ng (goo juhng; a long, plucked string
instrument that rests on a large stand in
front of you)
 èrhú (are hoo; a two-stringed bowed 
instrument)

Playing on a Team
No matter where you go in the world, you’ll find a national pastime. In America,
it’s bàngqiú (bahng chyo; baseball). In most of Europe, it’s zúqiú (dzoo chyo;
soccer). And in China, it’s p∫ngp≈ngqiú (peeng pahng chyo; ping pong), although
now that Yao Ming is on the scene, lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketball) is getting
some attention as well. Here’s a list of these and many other popular sports.
 yûmáoqiú (yew maow chyo; badminton)
 bàngqiú (bahng chyo; baseball)
 lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketball)
 shôuqiú (show chyo; handball)
 b∫ngqiú (beeng chyo; hockey)
 p∫ngp≈ngqiú (peeng pahng chyo; ping pong)
 zúqiú (dzoo chyo; football)
 y∫ngshì zúqiú (eeng shir dzoo chyo; soccer (literally, English-style 
football)
 lêiqiú (lay chyo; softball)
 yóuyông (yo yoong; swimming)
 wângqiú (wahng chyo; tennis)
 páiqiú (pye chyo; volleyball)
The Olympics is the best known conglomeration of all sorts of sports. Tîc≈o
(tee tsaow; gymnastics), such as zìyóu tîc≈o (dzih yo tee tsaow; floor exer-
cises), the d≈n gàng (dahn gahng; horizontal bar), the shu≈ng gàng (shwahng
gahng; parallel bars), the g≈o d∫gàng (gaow dee gahng; uneven parallel bars)
and the ≈n mâ (ahn mah; pommelled horse), are all familiar to viewing audi-
ences around the world.
Yóuyông (yo yoong; swimming) is also quite popular. Whether you do the 
dié yông (dyeh yoong; butterfly stroke), the yâng yông (yahng yoong; back-
stroke), the cè yông (tsuh yoong; side stroke), prefer to swim w≈yông (wah
yoong; frog-style or breast stroke) or zìyóu yông (dzuh yo yoong; freestyle
swimming), don’t forget to keep breathing. (And don’t forget to wear your
yóuyông mào (yo yoong maow; swimming cap). And if you’re a tiàoshuî
yùndòngyuán (tyaow shway yewn doong ywan; diver), you’d better not pà
g≈o (pah gaow; be scared of heights).
Some games require the use of p∫ngp≈ngqiú p≈i (peeng pahng chyo pye; ping-
pong paddles); others require wângqiú p≈i (wahng chyo pye; tennis rackets)
or lánqiú (lahn chyo; basketballs). All games, however, require a sense of
g∂ngpíng jìngzh√ng (goong peeng jeeng jung; fair play).

Soccer season in Beijing is from May to October, but in southern China it goes
year-round. As in Europe, soccer is the spectator sport of preference
throughout the country. And just as in Europe, passionate fans sometimes
boil over into brawling hordes. If you ever find yourself in Shanghai, check
out the game at the Hong Kou Stadium. In Beijing, try the Workers’ Stadium
near the City Hotel.
Here are some useful phrases to know, whether you’re an amateur or a pro-
fessional athlete. At one time or another, you’ve certainly heard (or said)
them all.
 Wô xiâng qù kàn qiúsài. (waw shyahng chyew kahn chyo sye; I want to
see a ballgame.)
 Bîf√n du∂shâo? (bee fun dwaw shaow; What’s the score?)
 Nêixie duì c≈nji≈bîsài? (nay shyeh dway tsahn jya bee sye; Which teams
are playing?)
 Wô yíngle. (waw yeeng luh; I won.)
 Nî sh∆le. (nee shoo luh; You lost.)
 Wô zh√n x∆yào liànxí. (waw jun shyew yaow lyan she; I really need to
practice.)
 Wô dâ de bútài hâo. (waw dah duh boo tye how; I don’t play very well.)
Here’s a list of things that happen at sports events. You’ll need to know these
terms if you want to follow the action:
 chu∫shàozi (chway shaow dzuh; to blow a whistle)
 dângzhù qiú (dahng joo chyo; to block the ball)
 dé yì f√n (duh ee fun; to score a point)
 t∫jìn yì qiú (tee jeen ee chyo; to make a goal)
 f≈qiú (fah chyo; to serve the ball)
 méi tóuzhòng (may toe joong; to miss the shot)
Today you can find such sports as hot-air ballooning and gliding in Anyang.
Kind of amazing when you discover Anyang was the capital of China’s very
first dynasty, almost two millennia before the Common Era.You can even
hook up with a hot-air balloon tour of the Great Wall and the Silk Road. These
sports certainly present a good way to cover such great distances without
requiring you to have been a Hun on horseback. Speaking of which, if camel
treks are your thing, Chinese travel agencies can now even arrange for you to
ride with the Mongols, those horsemen who’ve perfected the art of riding
over the centuries.

Talking on the Phone
In This Chapter
 Picking up the phone
 Understanding cell-phone lingo
 Talking for fun and for business
 Dealing with answering machines and voicemail
A
lthough e-mail may be the preferred method of communication these
days, you can’t duplicate hearing your loved one’s sh√ngy∫n (shung
yeen; voice) on the other end of the line or reaching just the right person you
need to begin discussing a merger over the computer. All the more reason to
know how to use the telephone in addition to surfing the Net.
The art of making a phone call in another language, and even in another
country, is just that — an art. To master it, you have to feel comfortable with
such basics as using the diànhuà (dyan hwah; telephone) in the first place.
Be sure to check out a few things beforehand, like what dìq∆hàomâ (dee
chyew how mah; area code) to b∂(baw; dial) first. What do you actually say
when someone picks up on the other end? This chapter helps you navigate
the communication terrain, whether you’re in Idaho or China.
Using a Telephone
Before even going near a diànhuà (dyan hwah; telephone), you may want to
become familiar with some common Chinese words and phrases connected
to using one. In fact, you see so many different kinds of phones nowadays,
you shouldn’t have a problem finding out which one best suits your needs:
 shôuj∫(show jee; cell phone)
 wúxiàn diànhuà (woo shyan dyan hwah; cordless phone)
 g∂ngyòng diànhuà (goong yoong dyan hwah; public telephone)

Sometimes you need the help of a ji√xiànyuán (jyeh shyan ywan; operator)
for things like guójì diànhuà (gwaw jee dyan hwah; international phone calls)
or to help you look up a diànhuà hàomâ (dyan hwah how mah; telephone
number). Of course, you don’t need a ji√xiànyuán to help you make a bênshì
diànhuà (bun shir dyan hwah; local call) or even a chángtú diànhuà (chahng
too dyan hwah; long-distance call). By and large, you can take care of most
anything else on your own. Except, perhaps, a duìf≈ng fùfèi diànhuà (dway
fahng foo fay dyan hwah; collect call).
Here are some other communication tools you may want to use:
 dâ diànhuà (dah dyan hwah; to make a phone call)
 chá diànhuà hàomâbù (chah dyan hwah how mah boo; look a number
up in a phone book)
 diànhuà hàomâ (dyan hwah how mah; telephone number)
 diànhuàkâ (dyan hwah kah; phone card)
If you’re like me, you need to ask plenty of basic questions before you figure
out what you’re doing with a telephone overseas. Here are a couple questions
that may come in handy:
 Zênme dâ diànhuà? (dzummuh dah dyan hwah; How can I place a phone
call?)
 Zài nâr kéyî dâ diànhuà? (dzye nar kuh yee dah dyan hwah; Where can I
make a call?)
 Bênshì diànhuà sh∂ufèi du∂shâo qián? (bun shir dyan hwah show fay
dwaw shaow chyan; How much is a local phone call?)
Going Mobile with a Cell Phone
The majority of folks in the world don’t have telephones in their homes. Can
you imagine? That goes for mainland China as well, where a quarter of
humanity resides. You can find them everywhere in Taiwan, however, as well
as in Singapore and Hong Kong. In big cities across the globe you’re apt to
see a million people (sometimes literally in places like Shanghai) on the
street with their shôuj∫(show jee; cell phone) in tow . . . or, rather, in hand,
right next to their zuîb≈(dzway bah; mouth), yakking away. It’s the preferred
mode of communication these days.
Although the more well-known cell phone brands have tried to make their
mark on the vast Chinese market of cell phone users, home grown brands
such as TCL and Ningbo Bird corner the market on their home turf nowadays.
166
Part II: Chinese in Action 

Here are some words that may come in handy now that everyone’s using a
cell phone or beeper:
 h∆(who; beep)
 h∆j∫(who jee; beeper)
 h∆j∫hàomâ (who jee how mah; beeper number)
 shôuj∫(show jee; cell phone)
 shôuj∫hàomâ (show jee how mah; cell phone number)
Cell phones have become so wildly popular that even as recently as 1998,
over 10,000 phones were confiscated in northern China after officials discov-
ered that members of high government used them as bribes or gifts for
friends and family. They even became the subject of a government anti-
corruption campaign.
So now that you have the lowdown on how crucial cell phones appear to be
in contemporary China, you’re probably itching to make a phone call. On to
the basics. . . .
Making a Phone Call
“Wéi?” (way; hello). You hear this word spoken in the second (or rising) tone
a lot on the other end of the line when you make a phone call. It’s kind of like
testing the waters to see if someone is there. You can reply with the same
word in the fourth (or falling) tone so it sounds like you’re making a state-
ment, or you can just get right to asking if the person you want to speak with
is in at the moment. (For more about the four tones, see Chapter 1.)
A phrase you may hear on the other end of the line in mainland China is “Nî
nâr?” (nee nar; literally: where are you?) It asks what d≈nwèi (dahn way;
work unit) you’re attached to. After these first little questions, you may
finally be ready to ask for the person you intended to call in the first place.
For decades after the Communist rule took over mainland China in 1949, all
Chinese people were assigned a d≈nwèi, which pretty much regulated every
aspect of one’s life — from where one lived, when one married, and even
when one had children. Asking about one’s d≈nwèi is still pretty common
when answering the phone.
167
Chapter 9: Talking on the Phone

Here are some things you can do before, during, or after your call:
 náqî diànhuà (nah chee dyan hwah; pick up the phone)
 dâ diànhuà (dah dyan hwah; make a phone call)
 sh∂udào diànhuà (show daow dyan hwah; receive a phone call)
 ji√diànhuà (jyeh dyan hwah; answer a phone call)
 huí diànhuà (hway dyan hwah; return a phone call)
 liú yíge huà (lyo ee guh hwah; leave a message)
 guà diànhuà (gwah dyan hwah; hang up)
Calling your friends
Feel like getting in touch with a péngyôu (puhng yo; friend) or tóngshì (toong
shir; co-worker) to liáoti≈n (lyaow tyan; chat) after class or work? Want to
confer with your tóngxué (toong shweh; classmate) about tomorrow’s kâoshì
(cow shir; exam)? Maybe you two are planning a wânhuì (wahn hway; party)
over the zh∂umò (joe maw; weekend) and you need to confer about the details.
To get the party started, you have to pick up that phone and start talking.

Ringing hotels and places of business
Calling places of business may be a bit different than the more informal call
to a friend or co-worker. When you call a lhguân (lyew gwahn; hotel),
sh≈ngdiàn (shahng dyan; store), or a particular g∂ngs∫(goong suh; company),
you may be asked what f√nj∫hàomâ (fun jee how mah; extension) you want. If
you don’t know, you can ask for the same:
Qîngwèn, f√nj∫hàomâ shì du∂shâo? (cheeng one, fun jee how mah shir
dwaw shaow; May I ask what the extension number is?)
After you figure out the extension, the ji√xiànsh√ng (jyeh shyan shung; opera-
tor) will hopefully say:
Wô xiànzài jiù gêi nî ji√hào. (waw shyan dzye jyo gay nee jyeh how; I’ll
transfer you now.)
Even after all your work thus far, you may find that you ji√bù t∂ng (jyeh boo
toong; can’t connect) or that méiyôu rén ji√(mayo run jyeh; no one answers).
Maybe the diànhuàxiàn duànle (dyan hwah shyan dwahn luh; the line has
been disconnected). That’s really máfan (mah fahn; annoying), isn’t it? Here
are some other máfan problems you may encounter while trying to make a
phone call:
 méiyôu b∂hàoy∫n (mayo baw how yeen; no dial tone)
 nî b∂cuò hàomâle (nee baw tswaw how mah luh; you dialed the wrong
number)
 záy∫n (dzah yeen; static)
 méi rén ji√diànhuà (may run jyeh dyan hwah; no one answers)

 diànhuà huàile (dyan hwah hwye luh; the phone is broken)
 zhànxiàn (jahn shyan; the line is busy)
 dênghòu (dung ho; be on hold)
If you finally do get through to an employee’s office only to discover the
person isn’t there, you can always leave a yôu sh√ng yóujiàn (yo shung yo
jyan; voicemail). When dealing with voicemail, you may have to deal with the
following kinds of instructions on a recorded message:
 Nín rúguô shîyòng ànjiàn shì diànhuàj∫, qîng àn 3. (neen roo gwaw shir
yoong ahn jyan shir dyan hwah jee, cheeng ahn sahn; If you have a touch-
tone phone, please press 3 now.)
 Nín rúguô shîyòng xuánzhuân b∂hào j∫, qîng bíe guà. (neen roo gwaw
shir yoong shwan jwan baw how jee, cheeng byeh gwah; If you have a
rotary phone, please stay on the line.)
 Yào huí dào zhû mùlù qîng àn jîngzìhào. (yaow hway daow joo moo loo
cheeng ahn jeeng dzuh how; If you want to return to the main menu,
please press # (pound) now.)
Phoning a client
If you want to reach your kèhù (kuh hoo; client) or your sh√ng yì huô bàn
(shuhng yee haw ban; business partner) in today’s business world, you just
have to pick up that phone. Personally connecting with a phone call is a good
way to maintain good gu≈nxi (gwan she; relationships; connections). It’s the
next best thing to being there.
Sometimes you need a little help from the mìsh∆(mee shoo; secretary) to
connect to the person you want to reach.

Using a calling card
Sometimes you may find yourself on the road without a cell phone or yìngbì
(yeeng bee; coins) to make a phone call directly from the nearest g∂ngyòng
diànhuàtíng (goong yoong dyan hwah teeng; public telephone booth).
However, you have a diànhuàkâ (dyan hwah kah; phone card) in your pocket,
so you decide to try it out.
Sorry, I’m Not Home Right Now . . .
Because people lead such busy lives, more often than not you don’t find them
in when you try to gêi t≈men dâ diànhuà (gay tah mun dah dyan hwah; give
them a call). You have no choice but to liúhuà (lyo hwah; leave a message) on
the lùy∫n diànhuà (loo yeen dyan hwah; answering machine). You can always
try to liúhuà with a real rén (run; person), too. Sometimes you have to press
the jîngzìjiàn (jeen dzuh jyan; pound key) before leaving a xìnxi (sheen she;
message). In that case, you have to recognize the jîngzìhào (jeeng dzuh how;
pound sign).
Listening to messages 
that people leave you
If you return home from a long, hard day at work to discover that many
callers have liúle huà (lyo luh hwah; left messages) for you, you may be
tempted to t∫ng (teeng; listen to) them right away rather than bùlî (boo lee;
ignore) them. Relax. Take a hot bath. Have a glass of wine while you cook
dinner. After a break you’ll be ready to tackle all the messages on that ol’
answering machine.
Here’s what a typical message sounds like:
Wéi? Jeremy, zhè shì Jason. Zhèige zh∂umò wômen yìqî qù nèige
wânhuì, hâo bùhâo? Y∫ngg≈i hên bàng. Yôu kòng gêi wô dâ diànhuà.

Understanding other people’s 
greeting messages
Here are some common greetings you may hear if you reach an answering
machine:
 Zhè shì Barry Jones. (jay shir Barry Jones; You have reached Barry
Jones.)
 Wô xiànzài búzài. (waw shyan dzye boo dzye; I’m not in at the
moment/I’m away from my desk.)
 S≈n yuè sì hào zh∫qián wô zài dùjià. (sahn yweh suh how jir chyan waw

 Nín rúguô xiâng g√n wôde zhùshôu t∂nghuà, qîng b∂f√nj∫108. (neen

 Qîng liú xià nínde míngzi, diànhuà hàomâ hé jiânduân de liúyán. Wô

hwah how mah huh jyan dwahn duh lyo yan. Waw hway gay neen hway
dyan hwah; Please leave your name, number, and a brief message. I’ll get
back to you.)
Leaving messages
When you leave a message on an answering machine, be sure to leave clear
instructions about what you want the person to do:
 Wô zài gêi nî dâ diànhuà (waw dzye gay nee dah dyan hwah; I’ll call you
again.)
 Nî huí ji≈zh∫hòu qîng gêi wô dâ diànhuà. (nee hway jyah jir ho cheeng

 Bié wàngle huí wôde diànhuà. (byeh wahng luh hway waw duh dyan
hwah; Don’t forget to return my call.)
If a live person answers and you have to leave a message, be sure to be
polite. Here are some good phrases to keep in mind:
 Qîng gàosù t≈wô gêi t≈dâ diànhuà le. (cheeng gaow soo tah waw gay
tah dah dyan hwah luh; Please tell her I called.)
 Máfan nî qîng t≈huí wôde diànhuà? (mah fahn nee cheeng tah hway waw
duh dyan hwah; May I trouble you to please have him return my call?)

 Qîng gêi wô zhuân t≈de liúyánj∫? (cheeng gay waw jwan tah duh lyo yan

Answering machines are still something of an oddity in China, so many
Chinese don’t know quite what to do when they hear your recorded voice on
the other end of the line. Be clear in your message that the caller should
leave a name and phone number after the h∆(who; beep).

In This Chapter

T
ime to get down to sh√ng yì (shuhng yee; business). Your sh√ng yi, that is.
Want to know how to manage that job in Jiangsu or how to deal with the
head honcho? This chapter will help you do business in Chinese — everything
from making a business appointment to conducting a meeting to checking your
e-mail on the fly. It also tells you how to look for a new apartment and search
for furniture so that you can finally come home and relax after all that work.
Because China has the fastest growing economy in the world, it’s no wonder
you gravitated to this chapter. Think of it. China is the fastest-growing source
of international profits for U.S. companies, with over a billion potential cus-
tomers. The United States is China’s second largest trading partner (after
Japan), and has hundreds of satellite offices everywhere from Shanghai to
Shenzhen. With hundreds of billions (that’s right, billions) of dollars in
exports throughout the world, China is most decidedly making its mark.
Your Office Digs
Whether you’re a mìsh∆(mee shoo; secretary) or the zhûxí (joo she; chair-
man) of the Board, the atmosphere and physical environment of your
bàng∂ngshì (bahn goong shir; office) is pretty important. It can even help get
you through an otherwise tough day. Might as well make it as sh∆fu (shoo

foo; comfortable) as possible. Why not put a zhàopiàn (jaow pyan; photo) of
the family gôu (go; dog) on your bàng∂ngzhu∂(bahn goong jwaw; desk) for
starters? That should put a smile on your face as you start the day.
You don’t even have to get up out of your yîzi (ee dzuh; chair) to notice all
the techie stuff around you. These days, just about any office you work in or
visit has the following basic things:
 diànhuà (dyan hwah; telephone)
 fùyìnj∫(foo een jee; copier)
 diànnâo (dyan now; computer)
 chuánzh√n (chwan jun; fax)
 dâyìnj∫(dah een jee; printer)
Of course, the first thing you might look around for when you get to work in
the morning is the k≈f√ij∫(kah fay jee; coffee machine). In fact, the one part
of the day you may look forward to the most is the xi∆xi (shyo she; coffee
break).
As you look around your xiâogéji≈n (shyaow guh jyan; cubicle), I bet you can
find all these things:
 g≈ngbî (gahng bee; pen)
 qi≈nbî (chyan bee; pencil)
 dâng’àn (dahng ahn; file)
 huíwénzh√n (hway one jun; paper clip)
 dìngsh∆j∫(deeng shoo jee; stapler)
 xiàngpíj∫n (shyahng pee jeen; rubberband)
 bîjìbên (bee jee bun; notebook)
 ji≈o dài (jyaow dye; scotch tape)
If you can’t find some indispensable item just when you need it, you can
always ask someone in the next xiâogéji≈n (shyaow guh jyan; cubicle). The
simplest way to ask is by using the phrase “Nî yôu méiyôu ____?” (nee yo
mayo _______; Do you have any _____?) Use that phrase as often as you like.
Just make sure you can reciprocate whenever your tóngshì (toong shir; co-
worker) needs something as well.
 Nî yôu méiyôu g≈ngbî? (nee yo mayo gahng bee; Do you have a pen?)
 Nî yôu méiyôu dìngsh∆j∫? (nee yo mayo deeng shoo jee; Do you have a
stapler?)

Talkin’ the Talk
Mínglêi and Shirley are co-workers in Xi’an. Shirley is about to go
into a meeting but can’t find her notebook. She quickly checks
with her good friend Mínglêi in the next cubicle.
Shirley:
Mínglêi! Wô jíde yào mìng! Kuài yào k≈ihuì le, kêshì
zhâobúdào wôde bîjìbên.
Meeng lay! Waw jee duh yaow meeng! Kwye yaow
kye hway luh, kuh shir jaow boo daow waw duh bee
jee bun.
Minglei! I’m in such a hurry! We’re about to have a
meeting, and I can’t find my notebook.
Mínglêi:
Wô yôu bîjìbên. Jiè gêi nî.
Waw yo bee jee bun. Jyeh gay nee.
I have a notebook. I’ll loan it to you.
Shirley:
Tài hâo le! Xièxiè.
Tye how luh! Shyeh shyeh.
That’s great. Thanks.
Whenever you add “-de yào mìng” (duh yaow meeng) right after a verb, you
add a touch of drama and emphasize whatever the verb is. For example, if
you say you’re lèi (lay), that means you’re tired. But if you say you’re lèi de
yào mìng (lay duh yaow meeng), that means you’re absolutely exhausted. If
you’re not just máng (mahng; busy), but máng de yào mìng (mahng duh yaow
meeng), you’re extremely busy, running around like a chicken without a head.
Here are some useful phrases to compare:
 Wô lêng. (waw lung; I’m cold.)
 Wô lêng de yào mìng. (waw lung duh yaow meeng; I’m freezing.)
 J∫nti≈n hên rè. (jeen tyan hun ruh; It’s very hot today.)
 J∫nti≈n rè de yào mìng. (jeen tyan ruh duh yaow meeng; It’s a real
scorcher today.)
If you’re going to emphasize a verb by adding -de yào mìng after it, you
can’t also use hên (hun; very) in the same breath. It makes your statement
redundant.

Conducting a Meeting
Congratulations! You’ve finally set up shop in your new office in Beijing or
welcomed your business partners from China and are all set to have your
first business meeting. But just what is the mùdì (moo dee; purpose) of your
huìyì (hway ee; meeting)? Is it to yânshì (yan shir; give a presentation) about
a new chânpîn (chahn peen; product)? Is it to tánpàn (tahn pahn; negotiate) a
hétóng (huh toong; contract)? How about for the purpose of shòuxùn (show
shwun; training) — either you or your Chinese colleagues? Do you have a spe-
cific yìchéng (ee chung; agenda) in mind already? I hope so. You definitely
don’t want to look unprepared.
Scheduling and planning a meeting
You might be one of those people who needs to ≈npái huìyì yìchéng (ahn pye
hway ee ee chung; schedule a meeting) just to prepare for another meeting.
Here are some things you may want to do at such a preliminary meeting:
 zhìdìng huìyì yìchéng (jir deeng hway ee ee chung; set an agenda)
 tâolùn wèntí (taow lwun one tee; discuss problems)
 jiêjué wèntí (jyeh jweh one tee; solve problems)
 tuánduì jiànshè (twan dway jyan shuh; team building)
What will your role be at these meetings? Will you be the one to zhûchí huìyì
(joo chir hway ee; lead the meeting) or just c≈nji≈huìyì (tsahn jya hway ee;
participate in the meeting)? Will you be the xiétiáorén (shyeh tyaow run;
facilitator) of the meeting, trying to elicit as much fânkuì (fahn kway; feedback)

as possible? Or do you always have the unenviable task of contacting everyone
in order to qûxi≈o huìyì (chyew shyaow hway ee; cancel the meeting)?
Suppose you’re the one who’s zhûchí huìyì (joo chir hway ee; leading the
meeting) and you want to make sure everyone has a say in matters. Here are
some phrases you can use to try and include everyone in the process:
 Jack, nî hái yôu shénme x∆yào bûch∂ng ma? (Jack, nee hi yo shummuh
shyew yaow boo choong mah; Jack, do you have anything else to add?)
 Wômen x∆yào duì zhèige xiàngmù biâojué ma? (waw men shyew yaow
dway jay guh shyahng moo byaow jweh mah; Do we need to vote on this
item?)
 Shéi hái yôu shénme yìjiàn huòzhê wèntí? (shay hi yo shummuh ee jyan
hwaw juh one tee; Who still has any comments or questions?)
Making the initial greeting
Suppose you’ve already had some contacts with your business counterparts
on the phone or via e-mail but have never actually met them until now. A
mere “nice to meet you” may not suffice, especially if you want to emphasize
how very glad you are to finally be speaking face to face. Here are a couple of
phrases you can use:
 Zôngsuàn jiàn dào nín le, shízài ràng wô hên g≈oxìng. (dzoong swan
jyan daow neen luh, shir dzye rahng waw hun gaow sheeng; It’s a pleasure
to finally meet you.)
 Hên g≈oxìng jiàn dào nín bênrén. (hun gaow sheeng jyan daow neen
bun run; I’m glad to meet you in person.)
Always greet the person who holds the highest rank first before saying hello
to others. Hierarchy is important to the Chinese, so try to always be con-
scious of this or you may unintentionally cause someone to “lose face” by not
acknowledging his or her importance in the overall scheme of things. This
goes for your side of the equation as well. The leader of your team should
enter the room first and then wait to be seated by the host of the meeting.
And one more thing: Try to get a list of the names of your Chinese counter-
parts in advance so you can practice pronouncing them correctly. That’s sure
to win a few brownie points right there.
The people you meet with may have one of the following titles:
 zhûxí (joo she; chairman)
 zhûrèn (joo run; director of a department)
181
Chapter 10: At the Office and Around the House

 dôngshì (doong shir; director of the board)
 j∫nglî (jeeng lee; manager)
 zôngcái (dzoong tsye; president)
 fù zôngcái (foo dzoong tsye; vice president)
 shôuxí kuàijì (show she kwye jee; chief financial officer)
 chângzhâng (chahng jahng; factory director)
 zûzhâng (dzoo jahng; team leader)
In Chinese, last names always come first. When addressing someone with a
title, always say the last name first, followed by the title. So if you know some-
one’s name is Li Peijie (Li being the surname), and he’s the Director of the
company, you address him as Lî Zhûrèn (lee joo run; Director Li).
Be sure you have business cards ready to give out when you go to China. It is
most appreciated if they are in Chinese as well as English. You should always
hand and receive each business card with two hands. Feel free to lay out the
name cards in the exact same order as those seated so you’ll remember who
is who.
If you are the guest of honor at a dinner banquet, you’re seated facing the
entrance to the room. Don’t worry if you get confused figuring out where to
sit when facing a round table. Your host will make sure to show you to your
seat. (See Chapter 5 for more eating tips.)
Starting the meeting
Here are some things to say when you’re ready to get the business meeting
started:
 Zâoshàng hâo. (dzaow shahng how; Good morning.)
 Hu≈nyíng nín dào wômen de bàng∂ngshì. (hwahn eeng neen daow waw
mun duh bahn goong shir; Welcome to our office.)
 Zài k≈ihuì yîqián, ràng wômen zuò yìge zìwô jièshào. (dzye kye hway
ee chyan, rahng waw men dzwaw yee guh dzuh waw jyeh shaow; Before
the meeting begins, let’s introduce ourselves.)
 Wô xiâng jièshào yíxià huìyì de c≈nji≈zhê. (waw shyahng jyeh shaow ee
shyah hway ee duh tsahn jya juh; I’d like to introduce the conference 
participants.)
 Zánmen k≈ishî ba. (dzah mun kye shir bah; Let’s begin.)
182
Part II: Chinese in Action 

Making a presentation
When it’s time to give a presentation during the meeting, here are some
words that you may want to use:
 bânzi (bahn dzuh; board) and fênbî (fun bee; chalk)
 huàbân (hwah bahn; easel) and câibî (tsye bee; marker)
 caí liào (tsye lyaow; handouts)
 ch≈tú (chah too; illustrations)
 biâogé (byaow guh; charts)
 túbi≈o (too byaow; diagrams)
Planning to go hi-tech instead? In that case, you may want one of these:
 PowerPoint yânshì (PowerPoint yan shir; PowerPoint presentation)
 huángd√ngj∫(hwahn dung jee; slide projector) and píngmù (peeng moo;
screen)
 tóu yîng piàn (toe yeeng pyan; transparency)
If you plan on videotaping your presentation, you need a lùxiàngj∫(loo
shyahng jee; video recorder), and if the room is pretty big, you may also
want to use a màikèf√ng (my kuh fung; microphone).
Ending the meeting
Here are some phrases that may come in handy at the conclusion of the
meeting:
 Gânxiè dàji≈j∫nti≈n ch∆xí huìyì. (gahn shyeh dah jyah jeen tyan choo
she hway ee; Thank you everyone for participating in today’s meeting.)
 Wômen x∆yào zài k≈ihuì tâolùn zhè jiàn shìqíng ma? (waw men shyew

another meeting to continue the discussion?)
 Zài lík≈i zh∫qián, wômen bâ xià cì huìyì de rìq∫dìng xiàlái ba. (dzye
lee kye jir chyan, waw mun bah shyah tsuh hway ee duh ir chee deeng

Discussing Business and Industry
Because China has opened up to the world so quickly since the death of Mao
Zedong in 1976 (the United States established diplomatic relations with the
People’s Republic in 1979), U.S. businesses in many areas have set up shop in
many parts of the country. Whether your company has an office in mainland
China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong, you’re sure to find one or more of the indus-
tries listed in Table 10-1 represented in those places.

Regardless of what industry you’re in, here are some things that you can do
to help you decide how to advertise your company and its products or ser-
vices or to determine how it’s going:

 xiâocèzî (shyaow tsuh dzuh; brochure)
 chânpîn mù lù (chahn peen moo loo; catalogue)
 túbi≈o (too byaow; logo)
Of course, if your product is so good it virtually sells itself, your greatest
source of business is undoubtedly going to come from good ol’ kôuchuán

By the beginning of the 21st century, there were over 10 million PCs and 26
million Internet users in China, even though the government strictly controls
its use. Individuals are charged by the minute if they use their own home
computers, so folks may not be that keen on checking their e-mail too fre-
quently. If something’s really important, you might want to resort to a phone
call so you know they’ll pick up on the other end of the line.

Checking Your E-Mail
These days your diànzî yóuxi≈ng dìzhî (dyan dzuh yo shyahng dee jir; e-mail
address) is as important as your míngzi (meeng dzuh; name) and your diàn-
huà hàomâ (dyan hwah how mah; phone number) when it comes to keeping
in touch. It’s almost indispensable if you want to do business. Just check
your sh∂uxìnxi≈ng (show sheen shyahng; inbox) and you’ll probably have

Hunting for an Apartment
Are you one of the hundreds of people considering making a long-term move
to China for business purposes? Starting to think about purchasing some
fángdìchân (fahng dee chahn; real estate) in the form of a g∂ngyùfáng (goong
yew fahng; condominium) or a hézuò g∂ngyù (huh dzwaw goong yew; co-op)
in Beijing or Shanghai? Just a few decades ago, contemplating such a pur-
chase of cáichân (tsye chahn; property) was unthinkable. These days,
though, with the enormous influx of foreign investment and joint-venture
companies, countless foreigners are beginning to take advantage of the many
reputable fángdìchân j∫ngjìrén (fahng dee chahn jeeng jee run; realtors) to

help them do just that. And if you’ve already purchased some cáichân and
now want to ch∆z∆(choo dzoo; rent) or zhuânz∆(jwan dzoo; sublet) a kòng
g∂ngyù fángji≈n (koong goong yew fahng jyan; vacant apartment) to someone
else, there are services that help you, the wùzhû (woo joo; owner), find a trust-
worthy chéngz∆rén (chung dzoo run; tenant). Here are some terms you might

Be real sure you’re using the correct tone when you pronounce the letters
“m-a-i” (pronounced my) in Chinese. If you say it with a third (dipping) tone,
mâi, it means to buy. If you say it with a fourth (falling) tone, however, mài, it
means to sell. If you’re not careful, you may end up selling something you had
hoped to live in yourself.

The Chinese language is fascinating and incredibly logical. Although mâi
(spoken with a third tone) means to buy and mài (spoken with a fourth tone)
means to sell, if you put them together and add the word zuò (dzwaw; to do)
in front of them, to say zuò mâimài (dzwaw my my), it means to do business.
(To buy and to sell . . . get it?)

(jyah jyew; furniture) or otherwise zhu≈ngshì (jwahng shir; decorate) your
new digs and put your individual stamp on the place.

Chapter 10: At the Office and Around the House
The growth of Pudong
Pudong (“Pu” is short for the Huangpu River and
“dong” means East) is the stretch of land east
of the Huangpu River in the city of Shanghai.
Just a decade ago, this piece of land was indis-
tinguishable from many other backwater Chinese
villages. Today it is a city within a city, boasting
a population of over 1.5 million on a piece of real
estate larger than the entire country of Singapore.
Foreign investment in this part of Shanghai is
enormous. In addition to its claim to fame as the
fastest growing business area in China, it also
boasts Asia’s largest department store, its high-
est TV tower, and, needless to say, the Shanghai
Stock Exchange.

Does your new place have a yu≈nzi (ywan dzuh; backyard) with a pretty
hu≈yuán (hwah ywan; garden), perhaps? How about a yángtái (yahng tye;
balcony) or a more romantic little t∂ngdào (toong daow; veranda)? You can
put some really nice zhíwù (jir woo; plants) out there, or even some hu≈
(hwah; flowers), like júhu≈(jyew hwah; chrysanthemums) or lánhu≈(lahn
hwah; orchids) or even some méihu≈(may hwah; plum blossoms). Wouldn’t
that be nice?
Is there a lóushàng (low shahng; upstairs) as well as a lóuxià (low shyah;
downstairs)? Is there a grand ménkôu (mun koe; entrance) or at least a
diànt∫(dyan tee; elevator) if you’re on the top floor? Are there lots of floor-to-
ceiling chu≈nghu (chwahng hoo; windows) with great views, or do they look
straight into an air shaft, forcing you to cover them with chu≈nglián
(chwahng lyan; curtains) the first chance you get? No matter. At least you
finally have a place you can call your own.
After you finally move in and discover how much empty space there really is,
you probably want to go out and buy at least the bare bones basics as far as
ji≈jù (jyah jyew; furniture) is concerned. How about some of these?
 chuáng (chwahng; bed)
 chuángdiàn (chwahng dyan; mattress)

 cháj∫(chah jee; coffee table)
 sh∆zhu∂(shoo jwaw; desk)
 y∫guì (ee gway; chest of drawers)
 sh≈f≈(shah fah; sofa)
And once you have your bed, you’ll probably want to buy some of the follow-
ing items to put on it. (The list just never ends. Try to make sure you don’t
run up too much of a xìnyòng kâ [sheen yoong kah; credit card] bill too
quickly or you may regret having made that move from Poughkeepsie to
Pudong in the first place.)

The good news, of course, is that after you’ve purchased all the above items,
you can actually sleep on your own new bed in China. The bad news, though,
is that now you have no excuse not to p∆chuáng (poo chwahng; make the bed)
every morning.
Okay, there’s one last thing I almost forgot to remind you to get before you
settle in for the night. Trust me, it will make all the difference in the world
when it comes to your ability to relax and enjoy your new digs. It’s something
that you don’t want to realize you’ve forgotten to stock up on before turning
in for the night. Here’s a hint: It belongs in the yùshì (yew shir; bathroom).

 Understanding Chinese currencies

 Exchanging money at banks and ATMs
 Leaving proper tips
Qián (chyan; money) makes the world go around. Of course, family and
friends are priceless, but you can’t very well support yourself or help
those you love, much less donate to a charity of your choice, unless you have
something to give. And that’s what life is really all about. (Unless, of course,
your main goal in life is to buy a Ferrari, acquire rare works of art, and live in
the south of France . . . in which case you need a LOT of qián. All the more
reason to read this chapter.)
In this chapter, I share with you important words and phrases for acquiring
and spending money — things you can easily do nowadays all over the world.
I give you some banking terms to help you deal with everything from live
tellers to inanimate objects like ATM machines. I even give you tips on tipping.
Staying Current with Chinese Currency
Depending on where in Asia (or any place where Chinese is spoken) you live,
work, or visit, you have to get used to dealing with different types of huòbì
(hwaw bee; currency), each with its own duìhuànlû (dway hwahn lyew; rate
of exchange). See Table 11-1 for the Chinese versions of international cur-
rency and the following sections for the main forms of Chinese huòbì.

Rénmínbì (RMB) in the PRC
In the People’s Republic of China, the equivalent of the Mêiyuán (may ywan;
U.S. dollar) is the yuán (ywan). The yuán is also known as rénmínbì (run
meen bee; literally: the people’s money). As of early 2005, 1 U.S. dollar is
equivalent to about 8.25 (mainland) Chinese dollars. Here’s how you say that
in Chinese:
Yì mêiyuán huàn b≈diân èr wû yuán rénmínbì. (ee may ywan hwahn
bah dyan are woo ywan run meen bee; One U.S. dollar is 8.25 (mainland)
Chinese dollars.)
The Chinese yuán, which is a paper bill, comes in denominations of 1, 2, 5,
10, 20, 50, and 100. You also see coins worth 1, 2, or 5 yuán. In addition to
saying you have yì yuán, you can say you have yí kuài qián (ee kwye chyan),
which means the exact same thing — one Chinese dollar. Over a billion
people around the globe currently use this currency.
Want to know how much money I have right now in my pocket, Nosy? Why
not just ask me?
 Nî yôu jî kuài qián? (nee yo jee kwye chyan; How much money do you
have?)
Use this phrase if you assume the amount is less than $10.00.
 Nî yôu du∂shâo qián? (nee yo dwaw shaow chyan; How much money do
you have?)
Use this phrase if you assume the amount is greater than $10.00.
200
Part III: Chinese on the Go 

One yuán is the equivalent of 10 máo (maow), which may also be referred to
as jiâo (jyaow) — the equivalent of 10 cents. Each máo or jiâo is the equiva-
lent of 100 f√n (fun), which compare to American pennies. Paper bills, in
addition to the yuán, also come in denominations of 2 and 5 jiâo. Coins come
in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 f√n; 1, 2, and 5 jiâo; and 1, 2, and 5 yuán.
The difference between yuán and kuài, and between jiâo and máo, is that
yuán and jiâo are formal, written ways of saying those denominations and
kuài and máo are the more colloquial forms.
X∫n Táibì in the ROC
In Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, or ROC, 1 U.S. dollar equals
about 31.80 x∫n táibì (shin tye bee; New Taiwan dollars).
Here’s how you say that in Chinese:
Yì mêiyuán huàn s≈nshíy∫diân b≈yuán x∫n táibì. (ee may ywan hwahn
sahn shir ee dyan bah ywan shin tye bee; One U.S. dollar is 31.80 New
Taiwan dollars.)
You see bills in denominations of 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 and coins in denomi-
nations of 1, 5, 10, and 50 cents. Coins, or língqián (leeng chyan; small
change), in Taiwan are particularly beautiful — they have all sorts of flowers
etched into them — so you may want to save a few to bring back to the States
or to show friends. Just make sure you keep enough on hand for all the great
items you can buy cheaply at the wonderful night markets.
Here’s how you ask for change:
Nî yôu méiyôu yí kuài qián de língqián? (nee yo mayo ee kwye chyan
duh leeng chyan; Do you have change for a dollar?)
Hong Kong dollars
Xi≈ng gâng (shyahng gahng; Hong Kong; literally: fragrant harbour), the long-
time financial dynamo of Asia, uses the Hong Kong dollar, or the gângbì
(gahng bee). Currently, 1 U.S. dollar is equivalent to 7.65 Hong Kong dollars.
Here’s how you say that in Chinese:
Yì mêiyuán huàn q∫diân liù wû yuán gângbì. (ee may ywan hwahn chee
dyan lyo woo ywan gahng bee; One U.S. dollar is 7.65 Hong Kong dollars.)
201
Chapter 11: Money, Money, Money

Singapore dollars
Singapore is a Mandarin-speaking country in Asia. Its dollars are called x∫ng
bì (sheeng bee) and come in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100. You can
find coins in denominations of 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents,
and 1 dollar.
In Singapore, if you want to say $1.25, you don’t use the number wû (woo;
five) to refer to the final 5 cents in the amount. You use the term bàn (bahn),
which means half: yí kuài liâng máo bàn (ee kwye lyahng maow bahn) rather
than yí kuài liâng máo wû (ee kwye lyahng maow woo). You can definitely
use the number wû in Taiwan, Hong Kong, or mainland China, however.
Making and Exchanging Money
People make their money in all sorts of ways. Most ways are legitimate. (If
you’ve attained yours through nefarious means, I’m not sure I want to know,
so don’t tell me!) You may be one of those lucky people who win the câi juàn
(tsye jywahn; lottery) or receive a large yí chân (yee chahn; inheritance) you
use to traipse to the other side of the world. Or perhaps you have a modest
amount saved up from working hard and paying your bills on time, and you
hope to make it go a long way. However you get your money, you find out
how to change it (and then spend it) with the help of this chapter.
You can always huàn qián (hwahn chyan; exchange money) the minute you
arrive at the f√ij∫châng (fay jee chahng; airport) at the many duìhuànchù
(dway hwahn choo; exchange bureaus), or you can wait until you get to a
major yínháng (een hahng; bank) or check in at your lhguân (lyew gwahn;
hotel). Of course, you can’t make it to a bank or hotel if you don’t have
enough money to hail a ch∆z∆ch√(choo dzoo chuh; taxi) to reach the 
yínháng or lhguân, and you don’t want to find yourself in ji≈nyù (jyan yew;
jail) — where you won’t be able to make bâoshìj∫n (baow shir jeen; bail) —
because you still don’t have any local huòbì (hwaw bee; currency).
The following phrases come in handy when you’re ready to huàn qián:
 Qîng wèn, zài nâr kêyî huàn qián? (cheeng one, dzye nar kuh yee hwahn
chyan; Excuse me, where can I change money?)
 Qîng wèn, yínháng zài nâr? (cheeng one, eeng hahng dzye nar; Excuse
me, where is the bank?)
 J∫nti≈n de duìhuàn lû shì shénme? (jin tyan duh dway hwahn lyew shir
shummuh; What’s today’s exchange rate?)
202

 Qîng nî gêi wô sì zh≈ng wûshí yuán de. (cheeng nee gay waw suh jahng

 Wô yào huàn yì bâi mêiyuán. (waw yaow hwahn ee bye may ywan; I’d
like to change $100.)
 Nîmen sh∂u du∂shâo qián shôuxùfèi? (nee men show dwaw shaow
chyan show shyew fay; How much commission do you charge?)
No matter where you get money or how much money you plan to convert
into local currency, you may have to show your hùzhào (hoo jaow; passport),
so always have that ready to whip out.
Talkin’ the Talk
Jane arrives at the airport in Beijing and needs to change some

Part III: Chinese on the Go 

Spending Money
I don’t think I’ll have trouble selling you on (no pun intended) the thought
of spending money. Whenever you see something you want, whether in a
sh≈ngdiàn (shahng dyan; store), on the ji√shàng (jyeh shahng; street), or at a
yè shì (yeh shir; night market), you may as well give in to temptation and buy
it, as long as you have enough qián. It’s as easy as that. Have money, will
travel. Or, rather, have money, will spend.
When you’re ready to buy something, you can do it with xiànj∫n (shyan jeen;
cash), zh∫piào (jir pyaow; check), or xìnyòng kâ (sheen yoong kah; credit
card). And when traveling overseas, you often use lhxíng zh∫piào (lyew
sheeng jir pyaow; traveler’s checks).
If you end up buying so many items that you can barely hold them all with
both hands, here’s one adverb you should remember. It comes in handy when
you start adding up the cost of everything before you fork over all your
money: I’m speaking of yígòng (ee goong), which means “altogether,” as in
“How much are these 20 toys and 80 sweaters altogether?”
You may overhear the following conversation in a store:
Zhèige hé nèige yígòng du∂shâo qián? (jay guh huh nay guh ee goong
dwaw shaow chyan; How much are this and that altogether?)
Zhèige s≈n kuài liâng máo wû, nèige yí kuài liâng máo, suôyî yígòng sì
kuài sì máo wû. (jay guh sahn kwye lyahng maow woo, nay guh ee kwye
lyahng maow, swaw yee ee goong suh kwye suh maow woo; This is $3.25,
and that is $1.20, so altogether that will be $4.45.)
Before you decide to mâi d∂ngxi (my doong she; buy things), be sure you
have enough money yígòng to buy everything you want so you don’t feel dis-
appointed after spending many hours in your favorite store.
The term d∂ngxi (doong she; things) is literally a combination of “east”
(d∂ng) and “west” (x∫). The Chinese language often combines two such oppo-
site words to come up with various concepts. D∂ngxi always refers to physi-
cal objects.
Cashing checks and checking your cash
I don’t care what anybody tries to tell you, xiànj∫n (shyan jin; cash) in local
currency is always useful, no matter where you are and what time of day it is.
Sometimes you can buy things and go places with xiànj∫n that you can’t
205
Chapter 11: Money, Money, Money

swing with a xìnyòngkâ (sheen yoong kah; credit card). For example, if your
kid hears the ice cream truck coming down the street, you can’t just whip out
your xìnyòngkâ to buy him an ice cream cone when the truck stops in front
of your house. You can’t even try to convince the guy to take a zh∫piào (jir
pyaow; check). For times like these, my friend, you need cold, hard xiànj∫n.
You can use it to buy everything from b∫ngq∫lín (beeng chee leen; ice cream)
on the street to a diànyîng piào (dyan yeeng pyaow; movie ticket) at the the-
ater. Just make sure you put your qián (chyan; money) in a sturdy qiánb≈o
(chyan baow; wallet or purse) and keep it in your front kôudài (ko dye;
pocket) so a zéi (dzay; thief) can’t easily steal it.
When you talk about how much something costs, you put the numerical
value before the word for bill or coin. For example, you can call a dollar yí
kuài (ee kwye; one dollar) or s≈n kuài (sahn kwye; three dollars). You trans-
late 10 cents, literally, as one 10-cent coin — yì máo (ee maow) — or 30 cents
as, literally, three 10-cent coins — s≈n máo (sahn maow).
Here’s how you speak of increasing amounts of money. You mention the
larger units before the smaller units, just like in English:

As useful and convenient as xiànj∫n is, you really have to pay with zh∫piào for
some things. Take your z∆j∫n (dzoo jeen; rent) and electricity bills, for exam-
ple. Can’t use cash for these expenses, that’s for sure. And when you travel
overseas, everyone knows the safest way to carry money is in the form of
lhxíng zh∫piào (lyew sheeng jir pyaow; traveler’s checks) so you can replace
them if they get lost or stolen.
The basic elements of all Chinese currency are the yuán (colloquially
referred to as a kuài), which you can think of as a dollar, the jiâo (colloquially
referred to as the máo), which is the equivalent of a dime, and the f√n (fun),
which is equivalent to the penny.

Paying with plastic
The xìnyòng kâ (sheen yoong kah; credit card) may be the greatest invention
of the 20th century — for credit card g∂ngs∫(goong suh; companies), that is.
The rest of us are often stuck paying all kinds of potentially exorbitant lìlf
(lee lyew; interest rates) if we’re not careful. Still, credit cards do make paying
for things much more convenient, don’t you agree?
207
Chapter 11: Money, Money, Money

To find out if a store accepts credit cards, all you have to say is:
Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u xìnyòng kâ? (nee men show boo show sheen yoong
kah; Do you accept credit cards?)
Overseas, many places accept Mêiguó yùntòng kâ (may gwaw yewn toong
kah; American Express). Closer to America, businesses may only sh∂u (show;
accept) MasterCard or Visa. In some out-of-the-way parts of China, you can’t
use plastic at all, so have plenty of xiànj∫n (shyan jeen; cash) or lhxíng
zh∫piào (lyew sheeng jir pyaow; traveler’s checks) on hand, just in case.
Whether the jiàgé (jyah guh; price) of the items you want to buy is guì (gway;
expensive) or piányì (pyan yee; cheap), the xìnyòng kâ comes in handy.
Read on for a list of credit-card-related terms:
 xìnyòng (sheen yoong; credit)
 xìnyòng kâ (sheen yoong kah; credit card)
 xìnyòng xiàn’é (sheen yoong shyan uh; credit limit)
 sh√zhàng de zuì g≈o é (shuh jahng duh dzway gaow uh; credit line)
Doing Your Banking
If you plan on staying in Asia for an extended time or you want to continue
doing business with a Chinese company, you may want to open a huóq∫
zhànghù (hwaw chee jahng hoo; checking account) where you can both cún
qián (tswun chyan; deposit money) and qû qián (chyew chyan; withdraw
money). If you stay long enough, you should open a dìngq∫cúnkuân hùtóu
(deeng chee tswun kwan hoo toe; savings account) so you can start earning
some lìxí (lee she; interest). Sure beats stuffing dà piàozi (dah pyaow dzuh;
large bills) under your chuáng diàn (chwahng dyan; mattress) for years.
How about trying to make your money work for you by investing in one of the
following:
 gûpiào (goo pyaow; stock)
 zhàiquàn (jye chwan; bond)
 tàotóu j∫j∫n (taow toe jee jeen; hedge fund)
 hùzhù j∫j∫n (hoo joo jee jeen; mutual fund)

Banks in the PRC are generally open at 8:30 a.m. from Monday through
Saturday. They close for two hours from 12-2 p.m. and then reopen from
2-5:30 p.m. Many branches of the Bank of China are open on Sunday morn-
ings, but some close on Wednesday afternoons. In Taiwan, banks close at 3:30
p.m., and in Hong Kong they’re usually open from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. during
the week and from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturdays.
Making withdrawals and deposits
Whether you need to cún qián (tswun chyan; deposit money) or qû qián
(chyew chyan; withdraw money), you need to make sure you have enough
qián in the first place to do so. One way to ensure you don’t overextend is
to make sure you know what your jiéyú (jyeh yew; account balance) is at
any given moment. Sometimes you can check your available balance if you
shàngwâng (shahng wahng; go online) to see which zh∫piào (jir pyaow;
checks) may have already cleared. If someone gives you an yínháng bênpiào
(een hahng bun pyaow; cashier’s check), however, it cashes immediately.
Lucky you!
If you plan to cash some checks along with your deposits, here are a couple
of useful phrases to know:
 Wô yào duìxiàn zhèi zh≈ng zh∫piào. (waw yaow dway shyan jay jahng jir
pyow; I’d like to cash this check.)
 Bèimiàn qi≈n zì xiê zài nâr? (bay myan chyan dzuh shyeh dzye nar;
Where shall I endorse it?)
One of the most convenient ways to access some quick cash is to go to the
nearest zìdòng tíkuânj∫(dzuh doong tee kwan jee; ATM machine).
Accessing an ATM machine
Zìdòng tíkuânj∫(dzuh doong tee kwan jee; ATM machines) are truly ubiqui-
tous these days. Wherever you turn, there they are, on every other street
corner. Sometimes I wonder how we ever survived without them. (Same goes
for the personal computer . . . but I digress.)
In order to use a zìdòng tíkuânj∫, you need a zìdòng tíkuân kâ (dzuh doong
tee kwan kah; ATM card) to find out your jiéyú (jyeh yew; account balance) or
to cún qián (tswun chyan; deposit money) or qû qián (chyew chyan; withdraw
money). And you definitely need to know your mìmâ (mee mah; PIN number);
otherwise, the zìdòng tíkuânj∫is useless.
And one more thing: Make sure you don’t let anyone else know your mìmâ.
It’s a mìmì (mee mee; secret).

Part III: Chinese on the Go 

Tips on Tipping
Píngcháng (peeng chahng; usually) in the United States, a 15 percent tip is
customary at restaurants, and you often give a 10 percent tip to taxi drivers.
Giving xiâo f èi (shyaow fay; tips) is expected everywhere from here to
Timbuktu. In some instances, you should even give xiâo f èi to people setting
up towels in the public xîshôu ji≈n (she show jyan; bathroom). Better to know
in advance of your trip how much (or how little) is expected of you so you
don’t embarrass yourself (and by extension, your countrymen).
In Taiwan, xiâo f èi are generally included in restaurant bills. If not, 10 per-
cent is standard. You can gêi (gay; give) bellboys and porters a dollar (USD)
per bag.
In Hong Kong, most restaurants automatically include a 10 percent tip, but
feel free to give an additional 5 percent if the f úwù (foo woo; service) is good.
Small tips are also okay for taxi drivers, bellboys, and washroom attendants.
Tipping in mainland China used to be rare, but the idea is finally catching on,
especially now that service with a scowl rather than a smile is fast becoming
a thing of the past. (For the longest time, workers simply had no incentive to
work harder or with a more pleasant demeanor after the Cultural Revolution.
Can you blame workers for having no reason to perform their duties with the
idea of customer service in mind?) A 3 percent tip is standard in restaurants
(still low compared to Taiwan and Hong Kong). Bellboys and room service
attendants typically expect a dollar or two (USD). Tipping in Mêij∫n (may
jeen; U.S. currency) is still very much appreciated, because it’s worth about
eight times as much as the Chinese dollar.
If you get a bill and can’t make heads or tails of it, you can always ask the fol-
lowing question to find out if the tip is included:
Zhàngd≈n b≈okuò f úwùf √i ma? (jahng dahn baow kwaw foo woo fay mah;
Does the bill include a service charge/tip?)
In English, when you say “15 percent,” you mean 15 percent out of a total of
100. The way to express bâif √nbî (bye fun bee; percentages) in Chinese is to
start with the larger denomination of bâi (bye; 100) first and then work your
way backwards with the percentage of that amount. Here are some examples:
 bâi f √n zh∫bâi (bye fun jir bye; 100 percent; literally: 100 out of 100
parts)
 bâi f √n zh∫b≈shíwû (bye fun jir bah shir woo; 85 percent; literally: 85 out
of 100 parts)
 bâi f √n zh∫shíwû (bye fun jir shir woo; 15 percent; literally: 15 out of 100
parts)
211
Chapter 11: Money, Money, Money

 bâi f√n zh∫s≈n (bye fun jir sahn; 3 percent; literally: 3 out of 100 parts)
 bâi f√n zh∫líng diân s≈n (bye fun jir leeng dyan sahn; 0.3 percent; liter-
ally: 0.3 out of 100 parts)

Asking for (and Giving) Directions
In This Chapter
 Asking and entertaining “where” questions

 Covering time and distances
 Pointing the way with directional coverbs
E
veryone (yes, even you) has to ask for f≈ngxiàng (fahng shyahng; direc-
tions) at some time or another. Even if you just need to find the cèsuô
(tsuh swaw; bathroom) — when you’ve got to go, you’d better know.
You may find yourself baffled by the boulevards in Beihai or dumbfounded
by directions in Dalian. This chapter helps you figure out exactly how to ask
for directions before you ever mílù (mee loo; get lost). Whether you lose your
bearings in Beijing or wander off the path in Luoyang, this chapter gives you
helpful tips that make it easier to find your way back home. Or at least back
to your hotel.
You definitely need to know how to ask where certain places are in mainland
China, where most people don’t speak English. You have a greater likelihood
of hailing an English-speaking cabbie in Taipei or Kowloon to take you where
you need to go but not in one of the cities or towns in mainland China.

Avoiding 20 Questions:
Just Ask “Where”
Okay, so you’re searching for the closest yóujú (yo jyew; post office) to mail a
package home before your mother’s birthday next week. A passerby tells you
to go right down the ji√dào (jyeh daow; street), but for the life of you, all you
see are a couple of sh∆diàn (shoo dyan; bookstores) and an occasional dìtiê
zhàn (dee tyeh jahn; subway station). Time to ask for directions. But how?
The easiest way to ask where something is in Chinese is to use the question
word nâr (nar). It means “where.” But you can’t just say nâr, or folks still
won’t know what you’re talking about. You have to use the coverb zài (dzye)
in front of nâr (zài nâr), which can be translated as “in” or “at.” Just put the
name of whatever you’re looking for before the word zài to create a complete
question:
 Yóujú zài nâr? (yo jyew dzye nar; Where’s the post office?)
 Sh∆diàn zài nâr? (shoo dyan dzye nar; Where’s the bookstore?)
 Nî zài nâr? (nee dzye nar; Where are you?)
Here are some more places you may be looking for when you lose your way:
 cèsuô (tsuh swaw; bathroom)
 Mêiguó dàshîguân (may gwaw dah shir gwahn; American Embassy)
 xuéxiào (shweh shyaow; school)
 yínháng (een hahng; bank)
 fànguân (fahn gwahn; restaurant)
 g∂nggòngqìch√zhàn (goong goong chee chuh jahn; bus stop)
 huôch√zhàn (hwaw chuh jahn; train station)
 dìtiêzhàn (dee tyeh jahn; subway station)
 ch∆z∆qìch√zhàn (choo dzoo chee chuh jahn; taxi stand)
 jízhênshì (jee juhn shir; emergency room)
 piàofáng (pyaow fahng; ticket office)
When you travel in unknown areas, you may need to determine whether you
can walk or if you need to take a g∂nggòng qìch√(goong goong chee chuh;
bus) or ch∆z∆qìch√(choo dzoo chee chuh; taxi) to reach your destination:
216
Part III: Chinese on the Go 

 Hên jìn ma? (hun jeen mah; Is it near?)
 Hên yuân ma? (hun ywan mah; Is it far?)
Different strokes for different 
folks: nâr versus nâlî
Chinese people immediately know where you’re from, where you’ve studied,
or at least where your Chinese language teacher is from by the way you say
the word “where.” If you say nâr (nahr) with an “r” sound at the end of the
word, you represent a northern Chinese accent commonly found in Beijing. If
you say it with a “lee” sound at the end rather than an “r” sound, as in nâlî
(nah lee), it indicates you’ve probably lived or studied in Taiwan.
When someone gives you a compliment, proper Chinese etiquette dictates that
your response should be a swift and decisive “nâlî, nâlî,” which literally means
“Where? Where?” but translates more loosely into “No, no, you’re too kind.”
When a Chinese person says something nice about you, your clothes, your car,
or your kids, never accept a compliment the way you do in English, which is
with a gracious and accepting “Why, thank you.” Instead, you should insist that
the compliment is undeserved and vociferously disagree with a quick nâlî,
nâlî. In mainland China, the equivalent expression is “nâr de huà.” (nar duh
hwah; literally: where are such words coming from?) Humility about your attrib-
utes, even if you have to feign it, is always well respected in Chinese culture.
The word nâr spoken with a third (low falling and then rising) tone means
“where,” but the same word said with a fourth (falling) tone, nàr, means
“there,” so be particularly careful which tone you use when you ask for direc-
tions. The person you ask may think you’re making a statement, not asking a
question.

Getting direction about directions
Knowing how to ask where you can find a particular place is the first step,
but you also need to know how to get there. (Otherwise, why would you ask
where it is in the first place, right?) Here’s the simplest way to find out:
Qù______zênme zôu? (chyew______dzummuh dzoe; How do I get
to______?)
Here are some examples of how to use this question pattern:
 Qù f√ij∫châng zênme zôu? (chyew fay jee chahng dzummuh dzoe; How
do I get to the airport?)
 Qù túsh∆guân zênme zôu? (chyew too shoo gwahn dzummuh dzoe; How
do I get to the library?)
 Qù xuéxiào zênme zôu? (chyew shweh shyaow dzummuh dzoe; How do I
get to the school?)
Answering “where” questions
Short of using international sign language with a pantomime act, you may
want to get a handle on some basic terms that indicate direction and loca-
tion. Read on for a quick list:
 yòu (yo; right)
 zuô (dzwaw; left)
 qián (chyan; front)
 hòu (ho; back)
 lî (lee; inside)
 wài (why; outside)
 shàng (shahng; above)
 xià (shyah; below)
 duìmiàn (dway myan; opposite)
 kàojìn (kaow jeen; next to)
219
Chapter 12: Taking the Road Less Traveled: Asking for (and Giving) Directions

If you plan to indicate that something is inside, outside, above, below, in front
of, or behind something else, you can use three different, completely inter-
changeable word endings with any of the location words:
 bi≈n (byan)
 mi≈n (myan)
 tóu (toe)
So, for example, if you want to say that the dog is outside, you can say it in
any of the following ways:
 Gôu zài wàimiàn. (go dzye why myan; The dog is outside.)
 Gôu zài wàibi≈n. (go dzye why byan; The dog is outside.)
 Gôu zài wàitóu. (go dzye why toe; The dog is outside.)
Sometimes you may have the need to use a more complex location expres-
sion, such as when you don’t want to simply note where something is. Perhaps
you want to tell someone where a certain action should take place. For exam-
ple, if you want to say “Wait in front of the school,” here’s what you say:
Qîng nî zài xuéxiào qiánmiàn dêng. (cheeng nee dzye shweh shyaow
chyan myan dung; Please wait in front of the school.)
In such cases, the verb dêng (dung; to wait) comes after the specified loca-
tion (xuéxiào qiánmiàn). Here are some other examples:
 Zài xuéxiào hòumiàn dêng. (dzye shweh shyaow ho myan dung; Wait in
back of the school.)
 Zài w∆zi lî ch∫fàn. (dzye woo dzuh lee chir fahn; Eat in the room.)
 Zài túsh∆guân kànsh∆. (dzye too shoo gwahn kahn shoo; Read in the
library.)

Giving Directions
Are you the kind of know-it-all who thinks you’re pretty familiar with a foreign
city by virtue of having pored over a couple of dìtú (dee too; maps) before
arrival? If so, you may want to be the one giving directions on occasion
221
Chapter 12: Taking the Road Less Traveled: Asking for (and Giving) Directions

rather than just asking for them. Knowing your stuff comes in handy when
you think the taxi driver is about to take you for a ride (figuratively, that is)
because he figures you don’t know your way around town.
If you want to jiào (jyaow; hail) a cab, say this to your hotel door attendant:
Wô yào jiào jìchéngch√. (waw yaow jyaow jee chung chuh; I would like
a taxi.)
You can also say:
Wô yào ji≈o ch∆z∆ch√. (waw yaow jyaow choo dzoo chuh; I would like
a taxi.)
The two methods are interchangeable, just like saying “taxi” or “cab.”
If you really do know your way around the city, you can instruct the taxi driver
as to which g≈osùg∂nglù (gaow soo goong loo; freeway), g∂nglù (goong loo;
highway), qiáo (chyaow; bridge), or lù (loo; road) to take; where to turn the
guâijiâo (gwye jyaow; corner); or which xiàngzi (shyahng dzuh; alley or lane)
to travel down. Or perhaps you want to avoid going over a particular ti≈nqiáo
(tyan chyaow; overpass) or under a particular dìxiàdào (dee shyah daow;
underpass).
Wherever you want to go, you need to know a few key verbs to instruct the
cab driver:
 guò (gwaw; to pass)
 shàng (shahng; to go up)
 xià (shyah; to go down)

Expressing Distances (Time 
and Space) with Lí
Even though you can use the cóng . . . dào pattern to literally say “from here
to there” (cóng zhèr dào nàr; tsoong jar daow nar) when you want to indicate
the distance from one place to another, you need to use the “distance from”
coverb “lí” (lee). The general sentence pattern looks something like this:
Place word + lí + place word + description of the distance
For example:
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân hên jìn. (goong ywan lee too shoo gwan hun
jeen; The park is very close to the library.)
 Wô ji≈lí nî ji≈tîng yuân. (waw jyah lee nee jyah teeng ywan; My home is
really far from your home.)
If you want to specify exactly how far one place is from another, you use the
number of lî (lee; the Chinese equivalent of a kilometer) followed by the word
lî and then the word lù (loo; literally: road). Whether you say sì lî lù (suh lee
loo; 4 kilometers), b≈lî lù (bah lee loo; 8 kilometers), or èrshís≈n lî lù (are
shir sahn lee loo; 23 kilometers), people know the exact distance when you
use this pattern. You also have to use the word yôu (yo; to have) before the
number of kilometers. If the answer includes an adjectival verb such as yuân
(ywan; far) or jìn (jin; close) rather than a numerical distance, however, you
don’t need to specify the number of kilometers or use the word yôu.

Check out the following sample questions and answers that use these new
patterns:
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân du∂me yuân? (goong ywan lee too shoo gwahn
dwaw muh ywan; How far is the park from the library?)
 G∂ngyuán lí túsh∆guân yôu b≈lî lù. (goong ywan lee too shoo gwahn yo
bah lee loo; The park is 8 kilometers from the library.)
 Yíngháng lí nî ji≈du∂me jìn? (eeng hahng lee nee jyah dwaw muh jin;
How close is the bank from your home?)
 Hên jìn. Zhî y∫lî lù. (hun jin. jir ee lee loo; Very close. Just 1 kilometer.)
You may have some other questions when you inquire about locations and
distances:
 Yào du∂cháng shíji≈n? (yaow dwaw chahng shir jyan; How long will it
take?)
 Zôu de dào ma? (dzoe duh daow mah; Can I walk there?)
 Zôu de dào, zôu bú dào? (dzoe duh daow, dzoe boo daow; Can one walk
there?)
To indicate whether something is likely to happen or unlikely to be attained,
the pattern you use includes potential complements. You do this by putting
the words de (duh) and bù (boo) between the verb and the complement to
indicate whether a positive or negative potential is involved.
If you say “Nî kànjiàn,” you mean “you see.” If instead you say “Nî kàn de
jiàn ma?” you mean “Can you see?” And if you use the negative “bù” rather
than the positive implication that goes with de to ask “Nî kàn bú jiàn ma?”
you mean “You can’t see?” Finally, if you use both positive and negative
potential forms in the same breath by asking “Nî kàn de jiàn, kàn bú jiàn?”
you mean “Can you see (or not)?”
Here are some other examples of this pattern:
 zuò wán (dzwaw wahn; to finish [doing something])
 zuò de wán (dzwaw duh wahn; can finish)
 zuò bù wán (dzwaw boo wahn; can’t finish)
 zuò de wán; zuò bù wán? (dzwaw duh wahn; dzwaw boo wahn; can you
finish it; can it be finished?)
 xî g≈njìng (she gahn jeeng; to wash [and make clean])
225
Chapter 12: Taking the Road Less Traveled: Asking for (and Giving) Directions

 xî de g≈njìng (she duh gahn jeeng; can be washed)
 xî bù g≈njìng (she boo gahn jeeng; can’t be washed)
 xî de g≈njìng; xî bù g≈njìng? (she duh gahn jeeng; she boo gahn jeeng;
can you wash it; can it be washed?)
When you ask for directions, the following questions may come in handy:
 Wômen zôu de dào, zôu bú dào? (waw mun dzoe duh daow, dzoe boo
daow; Can we walk [to get there]?)
 Wômen lái de jí, lái bù jí? (waw mun lye duh jee, lye boo jee; Will we
make it on time?)
Discovering Ordinal Numbers
Ever tell someone to make a right at the second ji≈ot∂ng d√ng (jyaow toong
dung; traffic light) or that your house is the third one on the left?
You can’t simply use the numeral plus a classifier in Chinese, such as when
you say s≈n ge (sahn guh; three) of something. If you say s≈n ge ji≈ot∂ng
d√ng (sahn guh jyaow toong dung), the person hears “three traffic lights.” If
you want to say “the third traffic light,” you have to add the word “dì” (dee)
before the numeral to create dì s≈n ge ji≈ot∂ng d√ng, which indicates the
third traffic light.
If you use an ordinal number followed by a noun, you must always have a
classifier between them. You can’t combine dì s≈n (dee sahn; the third) with
qìch√(chee chuh; car). You have to put the classifier “ge” in between the
number and the noun to say dì s≈n ge qìch√(dee sahn guh chee chuh), mean-
ing “the third car.”
Creating ordinal numbers (numbers that indicate the order of things) in
Chinese is quite easy. Just put dì in front of the numeral:
 dì y∫(dee ee; first)
 dì èr (dee are; second)
 dì s≈n (dee sahn; third)
 dì sì (dee suh; fourth)
 dì wû (dee woo; fifth)
 dì liù (dee lyoe; sixth)
226
Part III: Chinese on the Go 

 dì q∫(dee chee; seventh)
 dì b≈(dee bah; eighth)
 dì jiû (dee jyoe; ninth)
 dì shí (dee shir; tenth)
You may need to use these examples to give directions:
 dì y∫tiáo lù (dee ee tyaow loo; the first street)
 dì èr ge fángzi (dee are guh fahng dzuh; the second house)
 zuô bi≈n dì b≈ge fángzi (dzwaw byan dee bah guh fahng dzuh; the
eighth house on the left)
Specifying Cardinal Points 
with Directional Coverbs
You can tell someone to go yòu (yo; right) or zuô (dzwaw; left) until you’re
blue in the face, but sometimes the best way to give people directions is to
point them the right way with the cardinal points: north, south, east, or west.
In Chinese, however, you say them in this order:
 d∂ng (doong; east)
 nán (nahn; south)
 x∫(she; west)
 bêi (bay; north)
To give more precise directions, you may have to use the following:
 d∂ng bêi (doong bay; northeast)
 x∫bêi (she bay; northwest)
 d∂ng nán (doong nahn; southeast)
 x∫nán (she nahn; southwest)
When it comes to indicating north, south, east, west, left, or right, you can
use either -bi≈n (byan) or -miàn (myan) as a word ending, but not –tóu (to),
which you can use with other position words such as front, back, inside, and
outside.
227
Chapter 12: Taking the Road Less Traveled: Asking for (and Giving) Directions

Giving directions often entails multiple instructions. You can’t always say
“make a right and you’re there” or “go straight and you’ll see it right in front
of you.” Sometimes you have to use a common Chinese pattern for giving
multiple directions. That pattern is:
xi≈n + Verb #1, zài + Verb #2
This translates into “first you do X, and then you do Y.” Here are some
examples:
 Xi≈n wàng d∂ng zôu, zài wàng yòu zhuân. (shyan wahng doong dzoe,
dzye wahng yo jwan; First walk east, and then turn right.)
 Xi≈n zhí zôu, zài wàng x∫zôu. (shyan jir dzoe, dzye wahng she dzoe;
First go straight, and then turn west.)

If you get lost in any city in mainland China, you can often get back on track
by asking where “Zh∂ngsh≈n Lù” (joong shahn loo) or “Jiêfàng Lù” (jyeh
fahng loo) is. “Zh∂ngsh≈n,” literally meaning the middle mountain, refers to
the birthplace of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the modern Chinese Republic in
1911. “Jiêfàng,” on the other hand, means “liberation,” referring to the “liber-
ation” of the mainland by the Communists in 1949. “Lù” just means “road.”
Generally, these streets are located in the middle of town. They serve as the
Chinese equivalent of “Main Street” in “Anytown, U.S.A.” Always a safe bet.

In This Chapter
 Booking your room reservation

 Packing your bags and paying your bill
T
he right lhguân (lyew gwahn; hotel) can make or break a vacation.
Whether you stay in a capital city or a little backwater town with only
one lhguân to its name, you still need to know how to check in, check out,
and ask for anything you need in between (including the check). This chapter
runs you through the gamut of booking your hotel, checking in at the front
desk, checking out at the designated time, and dealing with all sorts of issues
that may come up in between.
First, however, I have an astounding fact for you: You have not one, not two,
but as many as five ways to say the word “hotel” in Chinese:
 lhguân (lyew gwahn; hotel)
 fàndiàn (fahn dyan; literally: a place for meals)
 jiûdiàn (jyo dyan; literally: a place for wine)
 zh≈odàisuô (jaow dye swaw; literally: a place to receive people)
 b∫nuân (been gwahn; literally: a place for guests)
Making a Room Reservation
Thinking of yùdìng (yew deeng; reserving) a hotel fángji≈n (fahng jyan;
room)? What kind do you want? A d≈nrén fángji≈n (dahn run fahng jyan;
single room) all for yourself? A shu≈ngrén fángji≈n (shwahng run fahng jyan;
double room) for you and your special someone? Or perhaps a penthouse
tàoji≈n (taow jyan; suite) for a special occasion like your 50th wedding
zh∂unián (joe nyan; anniversary)?

Whatever the occasion and whatever kind of room you want, you need to
know how to make a reservation. Just make sure you know your yùsuàn (yew
swan; budget) in advance (and stick to it). You’re sure to find a decent hotel
no matter the price range if you spend some time checking out the competi-
tion. Oh, and when you do finally pick up your phone to reserve a room,
make sure you have your xìnyòng kâ (sheen yoong kah; credit card) in front
of you (see Chapter 11 for more money talk).
Here are some questions you may want to ask over the phone as you begin
the search for your lîxiâng (lee shyahng; ideal) hotel:
 Nîmen hái yôu fángji≈n ma? (nee mun hi yo fahng jyan mah; Do you
have any rooms available?)
 Nîmen fángji≈n de jiàgé shì du∂shâo? (nee mun fahng jyan duh jyah guh
shir dwaw shaow; How much are your rooms?)
 Wô yào yíge fángji≈n zhù liâng ge wânshàng. (waw yaow ee guh fahng
jyan joo lyahng guh wahn shahng; I’d like a room for two nights.)
 Nîmen sh∂u bù sh∂u xìnyòng kâ? (nee men show boo show sheen yoong

 Yôu méiyôu sh≈ngwù zh∂ngx∫n? (yo mayo shahng woo joong sheen; Is
there a business center?)
 Nîmen de fángji≈n yôu méiyôu wângluò liánjié? (nee men duh fahng
jyan yo mayo wahng lwaw lyan jyeh; Do your rooms have Internet
access?)
You have many kinds of rooms to choose from, depending on your budget
and your unique needs:
 yíge ≈njìng de fángji≈n (ee guh ahn jeeng duh fahng jyan; a quiet room)
 yíge gu≈ngxiàn hâo de fângji≈n (ee guh gwahng shyan how duh fahng

 yíge cháo hâi de fángji≈n (ee guh chaow hi duh fahng jyan; a room with
an ocean view)
 yíge cháo yuànzi de fángji≈n (ee guh chaow ywan dzuh duh fahng jyan; a
room facing the courtyard)
 yíge yôu k∂ngtiáo de fángji≈n (ee guh yo koong tyaow duh fahng jyan; a

 yíge dài yángtái de fángji≈n (ee guh dye yahng tye duh fahng jyan; a

 yíge bù x∫y≈n de fángji≈n (ee guh boo she yan duh fahng jyan; a non-

as “with.”
Hotel or apartment?
China’s booming economy has become a magnet
for foreign businesses, and scores of foreign
business people have begun taking up resi-
dence there. Because living in mainland China
can be quite expensive and nice apartments
that don’t come with long waiting lists are hard
to come by, many foreigners opt to stay in a per-
manent hotel room or a serviced apartment
connected to a foreign-run hotel. A friend of
mine in Shanghai rents out his nice-sized apart-
ment for $2,000 U.S. dollars a month, compara-
ble to the rent of major U.S. cities like New York
or Chicago. And you can expect the hotels to
run $150 per night, just like in metropolitan U.S.
cities.

Checking In Before You Hit the Pool
Aaahhh, Yàzh∂u (yah joe; Asia)! Its allure often begins as soon as you pull up
to the front entrance and walk through the hotel door. You may even find
yourself mysteriously lingering a bit in the dàt∫ng (dah teeng; lobby), visually
casing the joint long enough to take in all sorts of amenities. The luxuries at
your disposal may include the following:
 yóuyôngchí (yo yoong chir; swimming pool)
 diànshì (dyan shir; television)
 g≈nxî fúwù (gahn she foo woo; dry cleaning service)
 huíy≈ànm∂chí (hway yah ahn maw chir; jacuzzi)
 tîyùguân (tee yew gwahn; gym)
 sh≈ngwù zh∂ngx∫n (shahng woo joong sheen; business center)
 lhguân fàndiàn (lyew gwahn fahn dyan; hotel restaurant)
Before you can take advantage of these conveniences, however, you have to
officially bànlî rùzhù shôuxù (bahn lee roo joo show shyew; check in). You
don’t want to be caught red handed running in the tîyùguân or relaxing in the
huíy≈ànm∂chí unless you’re a bona fide guest, right? (Don’t answer that.)
When you walk up to the fàndiàn qiántái (fahn dyan chyan tye; reception
desk), you’ll invariably find yourself needing to say one of the following 
sentences:
 Wô yîj∫ng yùdìng le fángji≈n. (waw ee jeeng yew deeng luh fahng jyan;
I already made a reservation.)
 Wô méiyôu yùdìng fángji≈n. (waw mayo yew deeng fahng jyan; I don’t
have a reservation.)
 Nîmen hái yôu fángji≈n ma? (nee men hi yo fahng jyan mah; Do you
have any rooms available?)
If you’re in luck, the hotel will have at least one k∂ng (koong; empty, vacant)
fángji≈n (fahng jyan; room). If the hotel has no available space, you’ll hear
“Duìbùqî, wômen kèmân le.” (dway boo chee, waw men kuh mahn luh; Sorry,
there are no vacancies/we’re full.)
The qiántái fúwùyuán (chyan tye foo woo ywan; front desk clerk) will ask you
to tián (tyan; fill out) a couple of biâo (byaow; forms) to book your room, so
have a g≈ngbî (gahng bee; pen) and some form of zhèngjiàn (juhng jyan; ID)
ready — especially your hùzhào (hoo jaow; passport). Voilà! You’re officially
a hotel kèrén (kuh run; guest).
235
Chapter 13: Staying at a Hotel

After you successfully manage to check in, a xíngliyuán (sheeng lee ywan;
porter/bell boy) immediately appears to help take your xíngli (sheeng lee;
luggage) to your fángji≈n. After he lets you in, he’ll give you the yàoshi 
(yaow shir; key) if you didn’t get it from the qiántái fúwùyuán downstairs.
Now you can finally xi∆xi (shyo she; take a rest) and maybe even fall asleep.
Before you do, however, you may want to put in for a wake-up call. All you
have to say is
Qîng nî jiào wô qîchuáng. (cheeng nee jyaow waw chee chwahng; literally:
Please call me to get out of bed.)

Taking Advantage of Hotel Service
Uh oh . . . you’re finally ensconced in your big, beautiful hotel room when you
discover that the mén suô bú shàng (mun swaw boo shahng; door doesn’t lock)
and the k∂ngtiáo huài le (koong tyaow hwye luh; air conditioning doesn’t
work). To make matters worse, your chu≈nghu dâ bù k≈i (chwahng hoo dah
boo kye; window won’t open). Heat wave! It may be hard to believe, but in
addition to all that, your mâtông dûzhùle (mah toong doo joo luh; toilet is
clogged). Time to call the nearest kèfáng fúwùyuán (kuh fahng foo woo ywan;
hotel housekeeper) and yell for help.
You may want the kèfáng fúwùyuán to sòng (soong; send) the following
items right over:
 chu∫f√ngj∫(chway fung jee; hair dryer)
 máotân (maow tahn; blanket)
 zhêntóu (jun toe; pillow)
 máoj∫n (maow jeen; towel)
 wèish√ngzhî (way shung jir; toilet paper)
Call quick if the following pieces of equipment are huàile (hwye luh; broken)
and need immediate fixing:
 nuânqì (nwan chee; heater)
 k∂ngtiáo (koong tyaow; air conditioner)

 mâtông (mah toong; toilet)
 k≈igu≈n (kye gwahn; light switch)
 ch≈zuò (chah dzwaw; electric outlet)
 yáokòng qì (yaow koong chee; remote control)
Maybe you just need someone to dâsâo fángji≈n (dah saow fahng jyan; clean
the room). Oh well. Even the best hotels need some tweaking every now and
then.
You interact with many different employees on any given hotel stay:
 fúwùtái j∫nglî (foo woo tye jeeng lee; concierge)
 zôngj∫nglî (dzoong jeeng lee; general manager)
 zhùlî j∫nglî (joo lee jeeng lee; assistant manager)
 fúwùyuán lîngb≈n (foo woo ywan leeng bahn; bell captain)
 fúwùyuán (foo woo ywan; attendant)
Hey! I almost forgot one of the best kinds of service you can take advantage
of on occasion . . . room service! Before you decide to order room service 
for food, however, just remember that it’s often guì liâng bèi (gway lyahng
bay; twice as expensive) as dining in the lhguân fàndiàn (lyew gwahn fahn
dyan; hotel restaurant), because the service is more f≈ngbiàn (fahng byan;
convenient).
To make a comparison by saying that something is a number of times more
expensive than something else, you first use the word guì (gway; expensive),
followed by the number of times you think it’s more expensive and the word
bèi (bay; roughly translated as “times”). You can compare the relative cost of
two products or services by using the word bî (bee; compared to) in the fol-
lowing pattern:
X bî Y guì # bèi
Here are some examples:
 Zuò ch∆z∆ch√bî zuò g∂nggòng qìch√guì wû bèi. (zwaw choo dzoo
chuh bee dzwaw goong goong chee chuh gway woo bay; Taking a cab is
five times more expensive than taking the bus.)
 Zhèitiáo qúnzi bî nèige guì shí bèi. (jay tyaow chwun dzuh bee nay guh
gway shir bay; This skirt is 10 times more expensive than that one.)
Every hotel room in China has a large flask of boiling water that you can use
to make tea or for drinking water. Never drink directly from the tap. You can
brush your teeth with tap water, because you just spit it out. Local Chinese
don’t dare drink the tap water either, so you’re in good company.

As you can see in the previous Talkin’ the Talk section, the coverb bâ often
appears right after the subject of the sentence, separating it from the direct
object, which is always something concrete rather than an abstract idea. It
separates the indirect and direct objects.
Instead of having the following sentence pattern:
Subject + Verb + Complement (+ Indirect Object) + Object
You have:
Subject + bâ + Object + Verb + Complement (+ Indirect Object)
Here are some examples:
 Wô bâ sh∆jiè gêi nî. (waw bah shoo jyeh gay nee; I’ll loan you the book.)
 Qîng nî bâ bênzi ná gêi lâosh∫. (cheeng nee bah bun dzuh nah gay laow

Checking Out Before Heading Out

goodbye). Time to téngch∆(tuhng choo; vacate) your hotel fángji≈n (fahng
jyan; room) and tuìfáng (tway fahng; check out).
You may need to say some of the following as you begin the end of your stay:
 Wô yào fù zhàng. (waw yaow foo jahng; I’d like to pay the bill.)
 Nîmen ji√shòu shénme xìnyòng kâ? (nee men jyeh show shummuh

Transportation
In This Chapter
 Traveling by plane
 Surviving customs
 Getting around town
T
raveling halfway around the world to Zh∂ngguó (joong gwaw; China) can
be a long haul. Knowing the magic traveling words and phrases in
Chinese can make your journey as efficient and sh∆fu (shoo foo; comfortable)
as possible. This chapter helps you make your way around the f√ij∫châng 
(fay jee chahng; airport) and the f√ij∫(fay jee; airplane), survive the hâigu≈n
(hi gwahn; customs) experience, and board different types of ji≈ot∂ng (jyaow
toong; transportation) after you reach your destination.
Flying Around the Airport
Consider yourself a veteran traveler just because you’ve been all through
≥uzh∂u (oh joe; Europe) and the Americas? Well, my friend, you’re in for a
rude awakening. When it comes to finding your way around China, English, or
any other Western language, does you little good. You spend a lot of unpro-
ductive time trying to interpret the signs to get some sense of which line to
stand in and where to go next at the airport. You need to at least know the
P∫ny∫n (pin yin; literally: spelled the way it sounds) romanization system, if
not Chinese characters themselves. If you don’t, you’ll be up a creek without
a paddle. You may end up following the guy next to you, even if it takes you
to the bathroom rather than baggage claims. (See Chapter 1 for more about
the p∫ny∫n system of spelling Chinese words.)

Good move to get a head start by reading Chinese For Dummies in advance of
your trip. You can bone up on some essential words and phrases before the
whole airport experience makes you want to get right back on the next plane
bound for home.
Making it past the check-in counter
Ready to bànlî d√ngj∫shôuxù (bahn lee duhng jee show shyew; check in)?
After lugging your bags up to this point, you finally get to tu∂yùn (twaw yewn;
check) your xíngli (sheeng lee; luggage). You receive a d√ngj∫pái (duhng jee
pye; boarding pass) at the check-in counter, at which point you’re ready to
make your way to the appropriate ch∆kôu (choo ko; gate), taking only your
shôutí xíngli (show tee sheeng lee; carry-on luggage).
All sorts of questions may be running through your mind about now. Here are
some basic phrases that may come in handy during check in:
 Wô xiâng yào kào guòdào de wèizi. (waw shyahng yaow cow gwaw
daow duh way dzuh; I’d like an aisle seat.)
 Wô xiâng yào kào chu≈ng de wèizi. (waw shyahng yaow cow chwahng
duh way dzuh; I’d like a window seat.)
 Wô xiâng tu∂yùn xíngli. (waw shyahng twaw yewn sheeng lee; I’d like to
check my luggage.)
 F√ij∫jî diân qîf√i? (fay jee jee dyan chee fay; What time does it depart?)
 Wôde hángb≈n hàomâ shì du∂shâo? (waw duh hahng bahn how mah
shir dwaw shaow; What’s my flight number?)
 Zài jî hào mén hòuj∫? (dzye jee how mun ho jee; Which gate do we leave
from?)
After you check in, you may encounter all sorts of unpleasant surprises.
Perhaps the plane can’t zhèngdiân qîf√i (juhng dyan chee fay; depart on
time) after all and the airline must tu∫chí (tway chir; postpone) your depar-
ture or qûxi≈o (chyew shyaow; cancel) it altogether. Maybe the ti≈nqì (tyan
chee; weather) is causing the problems. Better that than a kôngbù fènzî
(koong boo fun dzuh; terrorist) scare in this day and age, right?

Boarding your flight
Okay! You’re all set to board the plane. Are you lucky enough to sit in the
tóudêngc≈ng (toe duhng tsahng; first class) section, or do you have to sit in
j∫ngjìc≈ng (jeeng jee tsahng; economy class) the whole time? Either way, inter-
national flights no longer have a ch∂uy≈n q∆(cho yan chyew; smoking area),
so if you indulge in that sort of thing, you’ll have to white-knuckle it for the
next 10 hours or so.

In the meantime, here are some people you see get on the plane before you
(at least I hope you do):
 jiàshîyuán (jyah shih ywan; pilot)
 j∫zû (jee dzoo; crew)
 chéngwùyuán (chung woo ywan; flight attendants)
And if you’re like me, you get worried about some things as the plane begins
to taxi down the runway:
 qîf√i (chee fay; take off)
 qìliú (chee lyo; turbulence)
 zhuólù (jwaw loo; landing)
Aaah! I get nervous just thinking about them. It’s okay, though. The chéng-
wùyuán are on to people like you and me. That’s why they make sure to tell
you before takeoff where the jiùsh√ngy∫(jyo shung ee; life vests) and jînjí
ch∆kôu (jin jee choo ko; emergency exits) are located. You may also hear
them bark out the following instructions, if you haven’t already managed to
tune everything out:
 Jìjîn nîde ≈nquándài. (jee jin nee duh ahn chwan dye; Fasten your seat
belt.)
 Bù zhûn ch∂uy≈n. (boo jwun cho yan; No smoking permitted.)
 Bâ zuòyî kàobèi fàngzhí. (bah dzwaw ee cow bay fahng jir; Put your seat
back to the upright position.)
 Bâ tu∂pán c≈nzhu∂sh∂u qîlái. (bah twaw pahn tsahn jwaw show chee
lye; Put your tray table back.)
 Rúguô k∂ngqì y≈lì yôu biànhuà, yângqìzhào huì zìdòng luòxià. (roo
gwaw koong chee yah lee yo byan hwah, yahng chee jaow hway dzuh
doong lwaw shyah; If there’s any change in air pressure, the oxygen mask
will automatically drop down.)
If you’re not a nervous flyer, you’ll probably spend all your time listening to
y∫nyuè (een yweh; music) through the êrj∫(are jee; headset), flipping píndào
(peen daow; dials) on the radio or diànshì tái (dyan shir tye; channels) on the
television, or trying to shuìjiào (shway jyaow; sleep). Hopefully the flight is
showing a good diànyîng (dyan yeeng; movie) on such a long trip. But if the
show is boring, at least it may help you shuìjiào.

Going through customs
If you survive all the tu≈nliú (twan lyo; turbulence) and the boring diànyîng

for you! The next test you have to survive is the hâigu≈n (hi gwahn; customs)

(hi gwahn gwahn ywan; customs officers), none of whom may dông Y∫ngyû

have ready at customs. The following phrases should come in handy, too:
 Nî dông Y∫ngyû ma? (nee doong eeng yew mah; Do you understand
English?)
 Wô shì Mêiguó rén. (waw shir may gwaw run; I’m American.)
 Wô shì Y∫ngguó rén. (waw shir eeng gwaw run; I’m British.)

Navigating Around Town
It’s virtually impossible to rent a car in China. Cars just aren’t available. And
even if you can find a rental, you may not want to, given the bureaucracy and
driving conditions. Signs aren’t printed in English, which is probably the main
reason you shouldn’t even attempt it. Just think of the upside. You don’t have
to suddenly learn how to use a shôupáidâng (show pye dahng; stick shift) or
purchase any extra car bâoxiân (baow shyan; insurance). Take a taxi and
relax. Let the driver worry about how to get you from point A to point B.
No matter what form of transportation you end up taking from the airport,
and later on around town, here are a few crucial words and phrases to know:
 f≈ngxiàng (fahng shyahng; directions)
 dìtú (dee too; map)
 Wô mílù le. (waw mee loo luh; I’m lost.)

Hailing a cab
It’s Friday night, and you just had a pretty successful day doing business with
your Chinese counterparts. You’ve finally mustered the courage to venture
out of your hotel room for a night on the town. You decide to check out a
popular wût∫ng (woo teeng; dance hall), and you begin to determine what
mode of transport can best get you there.
Although zìxíngch√(dzuh sheeng chuh; bicycles), mótu∂ch√(maw twaw
chuh; motorcycles), mâch√(mah chuh; horse-drawn carts), and even niú
(nyo; cows) are still the main forms of transportation for the average individ-
ual in some parts of mainland China, most foreigners take taxis wherever
they go. You can easily find taxis around hotels, and cabs are certainly more
sh∆fu (shoo foo; comfortable) and f≈ngbiàn (fahng byan; convenient) than
having to deal with nonexistent rules of the road, breathing in k∂ngqì w∆rân
(koong chee woo rahn; air pollution) while bicycling, finding your way
through a maze of old alleyways, or, depending on the time of year, leaving
yourself to the mercy of the natural elements.
Here’s what you say to the hotel door attendant if you want help hailing a cab:
Wô yào jiào jìchéngch√. (waw yaow jyaow jee chung chuh; I would like a
taxi.)
After you’re safely ensconced in the cab, you need to know how to say the
following phrases:
 Qîng dài wô dào zhèige dìzhî. (cheeng dye waw daow jay guh dee jir;
Please take me to this address.)
 Qîng dâ biâo. (cheeng dah byaow; Please turn on the meter.)
 Qîng k≈i màn yìdiâr. (cheeng kye mahn ee dyar; Please drive a little
slower.)
 Qîng k≈i kuài yìdiâr. (cheeng kye kwye ee dyar; Please drive a little
faster.)
 Wô dêi gân shíji≈n. (waw day gahn shir jyan; I’m in a hurry.)
 Qîng zôu f√ngjîng hâo de lù. (cheeng dzoe fung jeeng how duh loo;
Please take a scenic route.)
 Zài zhèr guâi w≈r. (dzye jar gwye wahr; Turn here.)
 Nî kéyî dêng jî f√n zh∂ng ma? (nee kuh yee duhng jee fun joong mah;
Can you wait a few minutes?)
Oh, and one more thing. As you ch∆f≈(choo fah; set off) with your taxi s∫j∫
(suh jee; driver), make sure you put on your ≈nquándài (ahn chwan dye; seat
belt).
255
Chapter 14: Transportation

Finally, before you get out of the cab, these phrases may come in handy for
price negotiations:
 Wô g≈i gêi nî du∂shâo qián? (waw guy gay nee dwaw shaow chyan; How
much do I owe you?)
 Wô huì àn biâo fù kuân. (waw hway ahn byaow foo kwahn; I’ll pay what
the meter says.)
 Bié q∫piàn wô. (byeh chee pyan waw; Don’t cheat me.)
 K≈i wán xiào! Wô jùjué fù zhèmme du∂qián. (kye wahn shyaow! waw
jyew jweh foo juhmmuh dwaw chyan; You’ve got to be kidding! I refuse to
pay so much.)
 Bú yòng zhâo le. (boo yoong jaow luh; Keep the change.)
 Qîng gêi wô sh∂ujù. (cheeng gay waw show jyew; Please give me a
receipt.)
Because most people in China don’t speak English, always remember to take
a hotel card when you leave your hotel. Your card has the name and address
in English and Chinese. You can always show the card to a taxi driver when
you want to get back. If you’re walking around town, you may want to take a
dìtú (dee too; map) that shows local landmarks such as pagodas or train sta-
tions near your hotel.

Riding the rails
If you want to get where you need to go really quickly, especially in Hong
Kong or New York, the fastest way to get there may take you below the
ground — to the dìtiê (dee tyeh; subway). Most dìtiê zhàn (dee tyeh jahn;
subway stations) are pretty easy to navigate.
Unlike in Hong Kong, the subway system in mainland China is relatively new,
and you find stations in less than a handful of cities. Above-ground huôch√
(hwaw chuh; train) travel, however, is tried and true — especially because
China is such a huge place and distances between cities are so great. Unlike
the number of subway stations, you can find plenty of huôch√zhàn (hwaw
chuh jahn; train stations) in China. They even come equipped with hòuch√shì
(ho chuh shir; waiting rooms).
February is a particularly risky month to attempt long-distance train travel,
because the shortest month features the Chinese New Year, and you’re bound
to meet what seems like the entire country traveling from one part of China
to another. Make sure you consult a shíkèbiâo (shir kuh byaow; time sched-
ule) in advance and note the correct dàodá shíji≈n (daow dah shir jyan;
arrival time) and k≈ich√shíji≈n (key chuh shir jyan; departure time) of your
train.
If you plan to travel a long distance, be sure to book a ruânwò (rwan waw;
soft sleeper) for such occasions — or at least ask for a ruânzuò (rwan
dzwaw; soft seat) — because they’re the more comfortable accommodations
and not as jam-packed as other parts of the train. Trust me. Soft sleepers are
worth the extra cost. For more on the types of seats in trains, see Table 14-2.

Part III: Chinese on the Go 

Before you shàngch√(shahng chuh; board the train) to enjoy your comfy, soft
seat, you need to go to the shòupiàochù (show pyaow choo; ticket office) to
buy your piào (pyaow; ticket). You use the following words and phrases to
get the job done:
 piào (pyaow; ticket)
 piàojià (pyaow jyah; fare)
 d≈nchéngpiào (dahn chuhng pyaow; one-way ticket)
 láihuípiào (lye hway pyaow; round-trip ticket)
 shòupiàochù (show pyaow choo; ticket office)
 tèkuài (tuh kwye; express train)
 mànch√(mahn chuh; local train)
The following may come in handy at the train station:
 Piàofáng zài nâr? (pyaow fahng dzye nar; Where’s the ticket office?)
Notice the different way of saying ticket office in this question. Options
abound in the Chinese language.
 Wô yào yìzh≈ng yìngwò piào. (waw yow ee jahng eeng waw pyaow;
I’d like a hard-sleeper ticket.)
 Huôch√cóng nêige zhàntái k≈i? (hwaw chuh tsoong nay guh jahn tye
kye; Which gate does the train leave from?)
And when you finally hear the lièch√yuán (lyeh chuh ywan; conductor) say
“Shàng ch√le!” (shahng chuh luh; All aboard!), you can board and ask the fol-
lowing questions:
 Zhèige zuòwèi yôu rén ma? (jay guh dzwaw way yo run mah; Is this seat
taken?)
 C≈nch√zài nâr? (tsahn chuh dzye nar; Where’s the dining car?)

areful planning is the key to a successful vacation or business trip. You
have to keep in mind not only where you want to go, but also the best
time to travel. This chapter tells you how to prepare for a trip abroad and
how to choose the exact day, date, and year you want to travel. When it
comes to making sure your hùzhào (hoo jaow; passport) is still valid and
your qi≈nzhèng (chyan juhng; visa) is in order, however, you’re on your own.
Yí lù píng ≈n! (ee loo peeng ahn; Have a good trip!)
When Do You Want to Travel?
The time of year you choose to travel can make all the difference in the world
for a great (or lousy) vacation. Should you plan it for d∂ngti≈n (doong tyan;
winter), ch∆nti≈n (chwun tyan; spring), xiàti≈n (shyah tyan; summer), or
qi∆ti≈n (chyo tyan; fall)? A trip to Beijing during s≈n yuè (sahn yweh; March),
just when the dust storms are blowing in from the Gobi Desert, for example,
is quite different than a trip during wû yuè (woo yweh; May) or shí yuè (shir
yweh; October), when pollution is at a minimum and sunny skies are at a max-
imum. Of course, wû yuè and shí yuè are peak seasons to travel to China for
exactly these reasons, which means hotel prices are also at their peak. Paris
in the ch∆nti≈n is just as great (and just as expensive) for the same reason.
Can’t do much to help you there. For more on dates, weeks, months, and
years, head to Chapter 7.
Want to find out when friends plan to leave on their vacation? Just ask them
one of these basic questions:

 Nî jî yuè jî hào zôu? (nee jee yweh jee how dzoe; When are you leaving;
literally: What month and day are you leaving?)
 Nî jî yuè jî hào qù Zh∂ngguó? (nee jee yweh jee how chyew joong gwaw;
When will you be going to China; literally: What month and day will you
be going to China?)
If you have to answer the preceding questions, just fill in the month and the
number of the day you plan on leaving and put those words in place of yuè
and hào. Here are some examples:
 Nî jî yuè jî hào zôu? (nee jee yweh jee how dzoe; When are you leaving?)
 Wô wû yuè s≈nshí hào zôu. (waw woo yweh sahn shir how dzoe; I’m
leaving on May 30th.)
 Nî jî yuè jî hào qù Mêiguó? (nee jee yweh jee how chyew may gwaw;
When will you be going to America?)
 Wô s≈n yuè y∫hào qù Mêiguó. (waw sahn yweh ee how chyew may
gwaw; I’m going to America on March 1st.)
Bet you can’t wait to start making those travel plans now. Which brings me to
my next point . . .
Celebrating the Chinese Holidays
You may want to time your trip to mainland China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong to
coincide with certain holidays — or, just as important, to avoid certain days
and weeks.
First you celebrate x∫nnián (shin nyan; New Year’s Day; also known as
yuándàn; ywan dahn) on y∫yuè y∫hào (ee yweh ee how; January 1st), in addi-
tion to a three-day celebration coinciding with the lunar New Year known as
ch∆n jié (chwun jyeh; Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year). Every year the
dates for ch∆n jié change because — you guessed it — it follows the y∫nlì
(yeen lee; lunar calendar) rather than the yánglì (yahng lee; solar calendar).
Ch∆n jié always occurs sometime in January or February.
If you travel to China j∫n nián (jin nyan; this year) during 2005, you arrive
during j∫nián (jee nyan; the Year of the Rooster). Want to travel in the
coming years instead?
 2006: gôu nián (go nyan), Year of the Dog
 2007: zh∆nián (joo nyan), Year of the Pig
 2008: shû nián (shoo nyan), Year of the Rat

The Year of the Rat is actually the beginning of a whole new 12-year cycle of

In mainland China, Láodòng jié (laow doong jyeh; Labor Day) is celebrated on
wû yuè y∫hào (woo yweh ee how; May 1st), and Guó qìng jié (gwaw cheeng
jyeh; National Day) is celebrated on shí yuè y∫hào (shir yweh ee how;
October 1st) in commemoration of the day Mao Zedong and the Chinese
Communist Party declared the founding of Zh∂nghuá rénmín gònghé guó
(joong hwah run meen goong huh gwaw; the People’s Republic of China) in
1949. In Taiwan, Guó qìng jié is celebrated on shí yuè shí hào (shir yweh shir
how; October 10th) to commemorate the day in 1911 when China’s long
dynastic history ended and a new era of Zh∂nghuá mín guó (joong hwah
meen gwaw; the Republic of China) began, under the leadership of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen.
National Day in Taiwan is often referred to as shu≈ng shí jié (shwahng shir
jyeh; literally: double 10 day), because it occurs on the 10th day of the 10th
month.
267
Chapter 15: Traveling Abroad

In Taiwan, you often see years written out that seem to be 11 years short of
what you think is correct. That’s because the founding of the Republic of
China in 1911 is considered the base line for all future years. So 1921 is listed
as mín guó shí nián (meen gwaw shir nyan; “meen gwaw” is the abbreviation
for Zh∂nghuá mín guó [joong hwah meen gwaw], or the Republic of China,
and “shir nyan,” meaning 10 years, refers to 10 years following the founding
of the Republic of China). The year 2005 is noted as mín guó jiûshí sì nián
(meen gwaw jyo shir suh nyan; 94 years after the establishment of the
Republic of China).
In addition to the major public holidays worthy of closing down businesses,
you may want to experience some of the other fun and interesting Chinese
holidays first-hand:
 Yuánxi≈o jié (ywan shyaow jyeh; The Lantern Festival) is celebrated on
the 15th day of the lunar New Year. It marks the end of ch∆n jié (chwun
jyeh; Spring Festival). Folks display colorful and creative lanterns on the
street and eat boiled dumplings with glutinous rice and red bean paste.
 Q∫ngmíng jié (cheeng meeng jyeh; The Clear and Bright Festival) takes
place in April to honor one’s ancestors by sweeping their graves and
burning incense and paper money for their use in the next world. This
holiday is primarily celebrated in Taiwan, where you can still see entire
families having veritable picnics on the graves of their ancestors, which
are often located along the sides of hills and mountains.
 Du≈nwû jié (dwan woo jyeh; The Dragon Boat Festival) occurs on the
fifth day of the fifth lunar month and always features a real dragon boat
race (well, as real as a dragon can be on a boat, that is). It commemo-
rates the life and, more specifically, the death of China’s first great poet,
Qu Yuan, who lived during the Warring States (475–221 BCE) period.
He drowned himself in the Milo River in Hunan Province while exiled
after failing to persuade the king to adequately defend the country.
On Du≈nwû jié, people eat sticky rice wrapped in grape leaves known
as zòngzi (dzoong dzuh).
 Zh∂ngqi∆jié (joong chyo jyeh; The Mid-autumn Festival) is celebrated
on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month as a kind of harvest festival,
when families get together and everyone eats yuèbîng (yweh beeng;
moon cakes) — round pastries with lotus seeds. Everyone takes a
moment to really look at the moon on this evening — the subject of
much Chinese classical poetry.
All sorts of folk festivals take place in villages throughout mainland China and
Taiwan when you least expect them, so if you suddenly find yourself sur-
rounded by a throng of jovial, clapping, and singing people, just follow the
crowd and see where the action takes you. You won’t be disappointed. Even
funeral processions can be the most fascinating and musical of events, with
mourners dressed in white sackcloth playing all manner of wind and percus-
sion instruments.

Chapter 15: Traveling Abroad

Depending on the type of activities you enjoy doing while on vacation, you
may want to consider traveling to a place that has plenty of the following fea-
tures (or at least one special one to make it well worth the trip):
 hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach)
 sh≈n (shahn; mountain)
 sh≈mò (shah maw; desert)
 zhíwùyuán (jir woo ywan; botanical gardens)
 xióngm≈o (shyoong maow; pandas)
 yóuliè (yo lyeh; safari)
 tâ (tah; pagoda)
 fó miào (faw myaow; Buddhist temple)
 móti≈ndàlóu (maw tyan dah lo; skyscraper)
 gûdôngdiàn (goo doong dyan; antique shop)
 mêishùguân (may shoo gwahn; art gallery)
 xìyuàn (she ywan; theatre)
Unless you’re the type who thrives on danger and excitement (or works for a
relief agency), try to avoid places where the following natural phenomena
occur:
 táif√ng (tye fung; typhoon)
 hànz≈i (hahn dzye; drought)
 dìzhèn (dee juhn; earthquake)
 huôz≈i (hwaw dzye; fire)
 shuîz≈i (shway dzye; flood)
 yûjì (yew jee; rainy season)
Planning to travel cóng (tsoong; from) Xi∂ngyálì (shyoong yah lee; Hungary)
dào (daow; to) Xi≈nggâng (shyahng gahng; Hong Kong) anytime soon? How
about cóng Rìbên (tsoong ir bun; from Japan) dào Mòx∫g√(daow maw she
guh; to Mexico) instead? Wherever you travel, you always go cóng one place
dào another. Here are some good phrases to know when you tell people
about your upcoming travel plans, using the cóng . . . dào pattern:
 Wô cóng Niûyu√dào Ji≈zh∂u qù. (waw tsoong nyo yweh daow jyah joe
chyew; I’m going from New York to California.)
 T≈míngti≈n cóng Yîsèliè dào Ruìdiân qù. (tah meeng tyan tsoong ee suh

Passports and visas: Don’t leave home without ’em
Surprise! Actually, it should come as no sur-
prise that you need a valid hùzhào (hoo jaow;
passport) and a qi≈nzhèng (chyan juhng; visa) if
you want to enter mainland China or Taiwan.
(For more on passports, visas, and navigating
your way around airports, see Chapter 14.) And
if you plan on visiting a couple of different coun-
tries in the region for any length of time, you
may need a couple of different qi≈nzhèng to go
with each destination. Check to see what regu-
lations apply before you board your f√ij∫(fay

vacation experience of your life.
Check out Chapter 13 for hotel tips after you get

Packing for Your Trip
Are you the type who likes to zhu≈ngrù (jwahng roo; pack) everything under
the tàiyáng (tye yahng; sun) in three different pieces of oversized xíngli
(sheeng lee; luggage) before a trip? Or are you more the b√ib≈o (bay baow;
backpack) type, content to take only the bare essentials? Either way, you
have to prepare your bags in advance if you want to qualify them as shôutí
xíngli (show tee sheeng lee; carry-on luggage) or tu∂yùn xíngli (twaw yewn
sheeng lee; checked luggage).
What should you pack for a trip to the hâit≈n (hi tahn; beach)? Maybe some
of the following items:
 yóuyôngy∫(yo yoong ee; bathing suit)
 tàiyáng yânjìng (tye yahng yan jeeng; sunglasses)
 duân kù (dwahn koo; shorts)
 liángxié (lyahng shyeh; sandals)
No matter where you plan to go, you should pack some of these items:
 yáshu≈(yah shwah; toothbrush)
 yág≈o (yah gaow; toothpaste)
 huàzhu≈ng pîn (hwah jwahng peen; makeup)
 chúchòu jì (choo cho jee; deodorant)
 shu≈zi (shwah dzuh; brush)
 shùkôu shuî (shoo ko shway; mouthwash)
 nào zh∂ng (naow joong; alarm clock)
 gu≈hú d≈o (gwah hoo daow; razor)
 wèi sh√ng j∫n (way shung geen; sanitary napkins)
 yuèj∫ng yòng miáns≈i (yweh jeeng yoong myan sye; tampons)
 féizào (fay dzaow; soap)
 zhàoxiàng j∫(jaow shyahng jee; camera)
 zhuânji√qì (jwahn jyeh chee; adaptor)
 yùndôu (yewn doe; iron)
 yûsân (yew sahn; umbrella)

Talkin’ the Talk
Chén Xi≈nsh√ng (chun shyan shung; Mr. Chen) and Chén Tàitài
(chun tye tye; Mrs. Chen) are deciding what to pack for a trip to
Hong Kong in October.

Waw men eeng boo eeng guy bah yew sahn

The sentence structure for the verb zhu≈ng (jwahng; to pack) is: bâ A zhu≈ngrù
B, which translates into “pack A into B,” even though the word for “pack”
comes in between what you’re packing (A) and what you pack it into (B).
Enlisting the Help of a Travel Agency
Think you can handle traipsing around the world without an advance plan or
hotel reservations? Think again. China, for example, is one country you
should travel to as part of a gu≈ngu≈ng tuán (gwahn gwahng twahn; tour
group). If you don’t like the idea of group travel, you should at least make
advance reservations for hotels and domestic travel and even for your own
private dâoyóu (daow yo; tour guide) through a lûxíngshè (lyew sheeng shuh;
travel agency). Remember, you generally hear no Y∫ngyû (eeng yew; English)
spoken anywhere in China.

Chapter 16
Handling Emergencies
In This Chapter
 Yelling for help
 Visiting your doctor
 Going to the authorities
 Looking for legal advice
You can easily plan the fun and exciting things you want to experience
while you travel or go out with friends, but you can’t predict needing to
call the police to report a theft or rushing to an emergency room with appen-
dicitis on your trip to the Great Wall. Such things can and do happen, and this
chapter gives you the language tools you need to communicate your prob-
lems during your times of need.
Calling for Help in Times of Need
When you’re faced with an emergency, the last way you want to spend your
time is searching for an oversized Chinese-English dictionary to figure out
how to quickly call for help. Try memorizing these phrases before a situation
arises:
 Jiù mìng! (jyo meeng; Help; Save me!)
 Zhu≈zéi! (jwah dzay; Stop, thief!)
 Zháohuô l≈! (jaow hwaw lah; Fire!)
 Jiào jiùhùch√! (jyaow jyo hoo chuh; Call an ambulance!)
 Jiào jîngchá! (jyaow jeeng chah; Call the police!)
Be careful when you say the words jiào (jyow; to call) and jiù (jyo; to save) in
the phrases above. You don’t want to mistakenly ask someone to save the
police when you want him to call the police.

Sometimes you have to ask for someone who speaks English. Here are some
phrases you can quickly blurt out during emergencies:
 Nî shu∂Y∫ngwén ma? (nee shwaw eeng one mah; Do you speak
English?)
 Wô x∆yào yíge jiâng Y∫ngwén de lfsh∫. (waw shyew yaow ee guh jyahng
eeng one duh lyew shir; I need a lawyer who speaks English.)
 Yôu méiyôu jiâng Y∫ngwén de dàif u? (yo mayo jyahng eeng one duh dye
foo; Are there any English-speaking doctors?)
When you finally get someone on the line who can help you, you need to
know what to say to get immediate help:
 Wô bèi rén qiâng le. (waw bay run chyahng luh; I’ve been robbed.)
 Yôu rén shòu sh≈ng le. (yo run show shahng luh; People are injured.)
 Wô yào huì bào yíge ch√huò. (waw yaow hway baow yee guh chuh
hwaw; I’d like to report a car accident.)
Word to the wise: Chinese people don’t have O-negative blood, so Chinese
hospitals don’t store it. If you have a medical emergency in China that
requires O-negative blood, you should check directly with your country’s
nearest Embassy or Consulate for help. You may need to be airlifted out to
get the appropriate care. You may also want to take your own hypodermic
needles in case you need an injection, because you can’t guarantee that the
needles you may come across are sterilized. Better safe than sorry away from
home.
Receiving Medical Care
It’s everyone’s greatest nightmare — getting sick and not knowing why or
how to make it better. If you suddenly find yourself in the y∫yuàn (ee ywan;
hospital) or otherwise visiting an y∫sh√ng (ee shung; doctor), you need to
explain what ails you — often in a hurry. This may be easier said than done,
especially if you have to explain yourself in Chinese (or help a Chinese-speak-
ing victim who’s having trouble communicating). You may not have the
energy to remember both the pronunciation and the proper tone for the word
you mean to use. You may want to say you’re feeling kind of tóuy∆n (toe
yewn; dizzy), but if it comes out sounding like tu∂yùn (twaw yewn) instead,
you alert your caregiver that you’re sending your luggage on ahead of you.
You don’t want your doctor to move on to the next patient. Use Table 16-1 to
figure out how to say the basic body parts.

When you travel, don’t forget to bring your prescription medicines. Carry
them in a separate carry-on bag or in your purse. You don’t want to pack
them in a piece of check-in luggage, never to be seen again if the luggage gets
lost.
281
Chapter 16: Handling Emergencies

Unless you’re in a big city like Beijing or Shanghai, if you get seriously ill
while staying in mainland China, your best bet is to fly to Hong Kong or back
home for medical care. Don’t forget to check into evacuation insurance
before you go.
Finding a doctor
If your yùnqì (yewn chee; luck) is good, you’ll never need to use any of the
phrases I present in this chapter. If you end up running dâoméi (daow may;
out of luck), however, keep reading. Even if you’ve never ch∂uy≈n (cho yan;
smoked) a day in your life, you can still develop késòu (kuh so; a cough) 
or even qìguânyán (chee gwahn yan; bronchitis). Time to see a y∫sh√ng 
(ee shung; doctor).

Although verbs don’t express tense in Chinese, you often connect them to
things called aspect markers, which come directly after the verb and indicate
the degree of completion of an action. The aspect markers “xiàlái” (shyah
lye) and “xiàqù”(shyah chyew) are two such examples. Xiàlái refers to an
action that slowly turns into a non-action or a calmer state, such as “zuò
(dzwaw) xiàlái” (meaning to sit down and rest) in the previous Talkin’ the
Talk section. Xiàqù refers to continuing action.
Describing what ails you
Did your doctor say those magic words: Méi shénme (may shummuh; It’s noth-
ing)? Yeah, neither did mine. Too bad. Maybe you’re just now checking your
old w√ndùjì (one doo jee; thermometer) and finding out, “Wô f≈sh≈o le!”
(waw fah shaow luh; I have a fever!) ∑iya! (eye yah; Oh my goodness!) Time to
figure out what the problem is. Whether you make a sudden trip to the jízhên-
shì (jee jun shir; emergency room) or take a normal visit to a private doctor’s
office, you’ll probably field the same basic questions about insurance and
your symptoms. Table 16-2 lists some symptoms you may have.

Fighting off air pollution in China
Air pollution is a serious problem in mainland
China, so if you have respiratory conditions
such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, you
should wear a facemask in big cities and dusty
back roads. Although immunizations aren’t
required for travel to China, make sure your
tetanus shots are up to date, and check with
your doctor about a Hepatitis B vaccine if you
plan an extended stay.

I bet you’ve heard stories about how doctors who use traditional medical

immediately know what ails them. The truth is, aside from simple colds and
the flu, most doctors still need to take all kinds of tests to give a proper diag-
nosis. They may even need to perform the following tasks:
 huà yàn (hwah yan; lab tests)
 x∫ndiàntú (shin dyan too; electrocardiogram)

Part III: Chinese on the Go 
In Chinese, you generally put a negative prefix, such as bù (boo), in front of
the verb you’re negating. It sounds redundant in English to literally translate
a response as “not serious” when someone asks about the seriousness of a
situation. It’s more colloquial and appropriate to translate it as “no,” as you
see in the previous Talkin’ the Talk section when Katherine asks the doctor if
her ailment is serious.
When you give approximate numbers or amounts, you don’t need to use the
word “or” (huò zhe), as in “three or four days.” Just say the numbers right
after each other to automatically imply the “or.” For example, wû liù ge rén
(woo lyo guh run) means “five or six people,” and sì wû ti≈n (suh woo tyan)
means “four or five days.”

Treating yourself to better health
Not everything can be cured with a bowl of j∫t≈ng (jee tahng; chicken soup),
despite what my grandmother told me. If your grandmother cooks as well as
mine did, however, the soup couldn’t hurt . . .
Your doctor may prescribe some yào (yaow; medicine) to make you feel
better. After you lîn (leen; fill) your yàof ≈ng (yaow fahng; prescription), you
may find the following instructions on the bottle:

 Mêi sìge xiâoshí ch∫yícì. (may suh guh shyaow shir chir ee tsuh; Take one

Calling the Police
Ever have your pocketbook t∂u le (toe luh; stolen)? Being a victim is an awful
feeling, as I can tell you from experience. You feel sh√ngqì (shung chee;
angry) at such a kêpà (kuh pah; scary) experience, especially if it happens
in another country and the zéi (dzay; thief) táopâo (taow paow; escapes)
quickly.
I hope you’re never the victim of a crime like theft (or something worse). Still,
you should always be prepared with some key words you can use when the
jîngchá (jeeng chah; police) finally pull up in the jîngch√(jeeng chuh; police
car) and take you back to the jîngchájú (jeeng chah jyew; police station) to
identify a potential zéi. Hopefully the culprit will be zhu≈le (jwah luh;
arrested).
You may also find yourself in an emergency that doesn’t involve you. If you
ever witness an accident, here are some phrases you can relay to the police,
emergency workers, or victims:
 T≈bèi qìch√yàzháo le. (tah bay chee chuh yah jaw luh; He was run over
by a car.)
 T≈zài liúxiê. (tah dzye lyo shyeh; He’s bleeding.)
 Bié k∆. Jîngchá hé jiùhùch√láile. (byeh koo. jeeng chah huh jyo hoo
chuh lye luh; Don’t cry. The police and the ambulance have arrived.)

Sticking to acupuncture and herbal remedies
Chinese acupuncture and herbal medicine are
gaining currency in places outside of China.
Little wonder, because these remedies have
proven their efficacy in China for over a thou-
sand years. Herbal medicine remedies from the
jungles and rain forests of rural China have
helped every ailment from rheumatism to
cancer, and healers often use them in conjunc-
tion with Western medicine these days. As for
acupuncture, proper placement of needles in
certain key points of the body has proven so
useful in alleviating pain and in numbing
patients that you can undergo major surgery
without Western anesthesia.

Acquiring Legal Help
Nine out of ten foreigners never need to look for a lawyer during a stay in
China, which isn’t as litigious a society as the United States, to be sure. If you
do need a lfsh∫(lyew shir; lawyer), however, your best bet is to check with
your country’s dàshîguân (dah shir gwahn; Embassy) or língshìguân (leeng
shir gwahn; Consulate) for advice.
It can be very máf an (mah fun; annoying) and stressful to have to deal with
lfsh∫, no matter what country you’re in, but you have to admit — they do
know the fâlf (fah lyew; law). And if you have to go to fâyuàn (fah ywan;
court) for any serious shìjiàn (shir jyan; incident), you want the judge to
pànjué (pahn jweh; make a decision) in your favor. Moral of the story: Good
lfsh∫are worth their weight in j∫n (gin; gold), even if you still consider them
sh≈yú (shah yew; sharks) in the end.

Don’t sweat the Chinese justice
Justice is meted out quickly in the People’s
Republic of China, often without recourse to
appeals. Many times the crime ends in a death
sentence carried out quickly, for everything
from murder and rape to white collar type
crimes and corruption. The flip side of the coin
is that as far as tourism is concerned, foreigners
rarely experience crime. China is considered an
extremely safe place for tourists and business
people alike. Policemen are always willing to
help a lost foreigner in any city.

Ten Ways to Pick Up Chinese
Quickly
In This Chapter
 Practicing by listening
 Speaking while you cook
 Finding practice tools online and on television
 Meeting Chinese friends
 Translating your name with calligraphy
T
his chapter contains ten good activities that can help speed up your
Chinese learning curve. Having useful, easy-to-access, and easy-to-follow
learning tools makes a big difference in your progress. And besides, you can
have fun with them, too.
Listen to Chinese-Language 
Tapes, CDs, and CD-ROMs
Just imagine trying to figure out what Chinese tones sound like without actu-
ally hearing them spoken out loud. Kind of like imagining what Beethoven’s
Fifth sounds like based on a written description. Even if you read this book
cover to cover, you’ll be hard pressed to figure out just what the first, second,
third, and fourth tones actually sound like unless you listen to the accompa-
nying CD. Be creative with your discovery of the language (and your language
listening) by picking up all the language tapes, CDs, and CD-ROMS you can
find out there. Keep mimicking what you hear over and over again so that
your pronunciation and intonation become better with each go-round. Pretty
soon you’ll be able to tell a native Mandarin speaker from a native Cantonese
speaker.

Attend a Peking Opera Performance
Okay, I admit that the first time I attended a performance of Peking Opera, I
wished I had brought a pair of ear plugs. The opera is an acquired taste to be
sure. Kind of like caviar. But I recommend spending time cultivating an appre-
ciation for it. Peking Opera originated in the late 1700s, when opera troupes
originally staged performances for the royal family. Only later did it become
such a public art, and now it’s all the rage for any person who claims to
appreciate Chinese culture. The makeup, costumes, cacophonous music, and
stylized movements are predictable and much treasured by the Chinese
people. Listening to Peking Opera not only helps you develop an appreciation
for a great Chinese art form, but also fine-tunes your recognition of the pro-
nunciation of standard Mandarin. You can even learn a few tunes at the same
time. A win-win situation all around.
Cook with a Wok
You may be surprised what cooking with a wok can do for your Chinese. Not
only do you start eating healthier, but because you’re forced to visit some
Asian food markets to gather the ingredients you need to cook with, you also
soak in Chinese words by osmosis. Ever hear of dòufu (doe foo)? That means
soy bean curd in Mandarin. How about bok choi? Okay, so that’s Cantonese,
but the Mandarin is bái cài (bye tsye; Chinese cabbage). The best traditional
Chinese cooking, all done with a wok, puts you in the proper frame of mind to
want to soak up some more Chinese language. Try following some recipes
from a Chinese cookbook and repeat the names of the ingredients over and
over, a sure fire way to speak more Chinese. And if you’re not a great cook,
get into the habit of eating at Chinese restaurants and mastering the names of
at least ten dishes before the end of the meal.
Shop for Food in Chinatown
Mingle with the Mandarin-speaking masses while you attune your ear to the
sounds and tones of Chinese. This is only one of the fun things to do in
Chinatown, of course, but one worth doing often. Not only do you cultivate a
good ear for Chinese, but you also become privy to the gestures that often go
along with the sounds. (And you thought the Italians had cornered the
market on hand gestures.)
300
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Surf the Net
Tons of information on Chinese language and culture is only a mouse click
away. Now that you’re in the information age, take advantage of it. Everything
from how to write Chinese characters to discovering Peking Opera is out
there. Whatever motivated you to start speaking Chinese in the first place,
the World Wide Web keeps you involved. Just do a quick search for places
like Shanghai, Beijing, or Taipei or cultural keywords like wok or pagoda.
You’ll be amazed at what you can come up with.
Watch Kung-Fu Flicks
Bruce Lee is only the tip of the iceberg. Go to your local public library and
ask to see the list of kung-fu movies. Everything from Hong Kong action films
to mainland martial arts flicks — you should find them all there. Pick what-
ever interests you. Directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige have become
famous around the world. (Okay, so they didn’t direct kung-fu movies . . . but
they’re still worth checking out.)
The best way to grasp Chinese is to watch them over and over to see how
many words and phrases you can pick up in one sitting. You soon become
adept at anticipating which gestures go with which words, and you develop a
great ear for all those tones.
Exchange Language Lessons
Finding a language partner has to be one of the best ways to pick up Chinese.
Not only do you get to learn the language, but you also develop a friendship
along the way. Tons of students come to the States every year from China.
Whether you’re in school at the moment or just live near one, you should
have no problem putting up a sign offering a language exchange. And don’t
forget to ask your language partner to compare notes about Chinese and
American culture. That’s when the real fun begins.
301
Chapter 17: Ten Ways to Pick Up Chinese Quickly

Make Chinese Friends
Possibilities for meeting Chinese-speaking people are endless. Check out the
cubicle next to you at your office or the desk ahead of you in class. Or how
about the mother of the kid who’s in your son’s karate class? Wherever you
go, you have a chance to make a new friend who not only knows Chinese, but
who also can teach you a little about the culture. You may even find a new
friend to see that kung-fu movie with or to help you navigate grocery shop-
ping in Chinatown (not to mention how to use a wok after you buy all your
food).
Study Chinese Calligraphy
Chinese calligraphy is one of the most beautiful art forms in the world. Why
not pick up a brush and create those beautiful strokes yourself on rice paper?
The whole ritual of preparing the ink and paper is an exercise in patience and
meditation, and you get to appreciate the difficulty Chinese school children
have in learning to write Chinese. You can discover how to write your name
in Chinese (have your English name transliterated, because there’s no alpha-
bet in Chinese) and then practice writing those characters over and over
until you can sign your name to a Chinese News Year’s card and mail it to a
friend.
Be Curious and Creative
If you look for opportunities to practice Chinese, I guarantee you can find
them. Be imaginative. And stop worrying about failing. In fact, make as many
mistakes as it takes so that you can make a mental note of what you should
do or say differently the next time around. Give yourself a pat on the back
every time you discover something new in Chinese or figure out a novel way
to discover more about the Chinese language and people. Keep yakking away
with the new words and phrases you find in Chinese For Dummies and enjoy
watching the reactions on people’s faces when you open your mouth.

Chapter 18
Ten Things Never to Do in China
In This Chapter
 Understanding Chinese etiquette
 Being gracious and humble in social situations
T
his chapter may save you from certain embarrassment and possibly even
outright humiliation one day. It gives you ten important tips on what not
to do if you really want to win friends and make a good impression with your
Chinese acquaintances. Take my tips to heart.
Never Accept a Compliment Graciously
You may find yourself at a loss for words when you compliment a Chinese
host on a wonderful meal, and you get in response, “No, no, the food was
really horrible.” You hear the same thing when you tell a Chinese parent how
smart or handsome his son is — he meets the compliment with a rebuff of
“No, he’s really stupid” or “He’s not good looking at all.” These people aren’t
being nasty . . . just humble and polite. Moral of the story here: Feign humil-
ity, even if it kills you! A little less boasting and fewer self-congratulatory
remarks go a long way towards scoring cultural sensitivity points with the
Chinese.
Never Make Someone Lose Face
The worst thing you can possibly do to Chinese acquaintances is publicly
humiliate or otherwise embarrass them. Doing so makes them lose face.
Don’t point out a mistake in front of others or yell at someone.
The good news is that you can actually help someone gain face by compli-
menting them and giving credit where credit is due. Do this whenever the
opportunity arises. Your graciousness is much appreciated.

Never Get Angry in Public
Public displays of anger are frowned upon by the Chinese and are most
uncomfortable for them to deal with — especially if the people getting angry
are foreign tourists, for example. This goes right along with making someone
(usually the Chinese host) lose face, which you should avoid at all costs. The
Chinese place a premium on group harmony, so foreigners should try to 
swallow hard, be polite, and cope privately.
Never Address People by Their 
First Names First
Chinese people have first and last names like everyone else. However, in
China, the last name always comes first. The family (and the collective in gen-
eral) always takes precedence over the individual. Joe Smith in Minnesota is
known as Smith Joe (or the equivalent) in Shanghai. If a man is introduced to
you as Lî Míng, you can safely refer to him as Mr. Lî (not Mr. Míng).
Unlike people in the West, the Chinese don’t feel very comfortable calling
each other by their first names. Only family members and a few close friends
ever refer to the man above, for example, as simply “Míng.” They may, how-
ever, add the prefix lâo (laow; old) or xiâo (shyaow; young) before the family
name to show familiarity and closeness. Lâo Lî (Old Lî) may refer to his
younger friend as Xiâo Chén (Young Chén).
Never Take Food with the Wrong 
End of Your Chopsticks
The next time you gather around a dinner table with a Chinese host, you 
may discover that serving spoons for the many communal dishes are non-
existent. This is because everyone serves themselves (or others) by turning
their chopsticks upside down to take food from the main dishes before
putting the food on the individual plates.
304
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Never Drink Alcohol Without First
Offering a Toast
Chinese banquets include eight to ten courses of food and plenty of alcohol.
Sometimes you drink rice wine, and sometimes you drink industrial strength
Máo Tái, known to put a foreigner or two under the table in no time. One way
to slow the drinking is to observe Chinese etiquette by always offering a toast
to the host or someone else at the table before taking a sip yourself. This not
only prevents you from drinking too much too quickly, but also shows your
gratitude toward the host and your regard for the other guests. If someone
toasts you with a “g≈n b√i,” (gahn bay) however, watch out.
G≈n b√i means “bottoms up,” and you may be expected to drink the whole
drink rather quickly. Don’t worry. You can always say “shuí yì” (shway ee; as
you wish) in return and take just a little sip instead.
Never Let Someone Else Pay the Bill
Without Fighting for It
Most Westerners are stunned the first time they witness the many fairly
chaotic, noisy scenes at the end of a Chinese restaurant meal. The time to
pay the bill has come and everyone is simply doing what they’re expected to
do — fight to be the one to pay it. The Chinese consider it good manners to
vociferously and strenuously attempt to wrest the bill out of the very hands
of whoever happens to have it. This may go on, back and forth, for a good
few minutes, until someone “wins” and pays the bill. The gesture of being
eager and willing to pay is always appreciated.
Never Show Up Empty Handed
Gifts are exchanged frequently between the Chinese, and not just on special
occasions. If you have dinner in someone’s house to meet a prospective busi-
ness partner or for any other pre-arranged meeting, both parties commonly
exchange gifts as small tokens of friendship and good will. Westerners are
often surprised at the number of gifts the Chinese hosts give. The general
rule of thumb is to bring many little (gender non-specific) gifts when you
travel to China. You never know when you’ll meet someone who wants to pre-
sent you with a special memento, so you should arrive with your own as well.
305
Chapter 18: Ten Things Never to Do in China

Never Accept Food, Drinks, or Gifts
Without First Refusing a Few Times
No self-respecting guests immediately accept whatever may be offered to
them in someone’s home. No matter how much they may be eager to accept
the food, drink, or gift, proper Chinese etiquette prevents them from doing
anything that makes them appear greedy or eager to receive it, so be sure to
politely refuse a couple of times.
Never Take the First “No, 
Thank You” Literally
Chinese people automatically refuse food or drinks several times — even if
they really feel hungry or thirsty. Never take the first “No, thank you” literally.
Even if they say it once or twice, offer it again. A good guest is supposed to
refuse at least once, but a good host is also supposed to make the offer at
least twice.

Ten Favorite Chinese Expressions
In This Chapter
 Sounding like a native
 Getting to know the lingo of daily life
S
ome English words and phrases are common expressions you hear
repeatedly during the course of a day. The Chinese language is no 
different. It accommodates this tendency with tons of colorful expressions.
Some expressions are known as chéngyû (chung yew) — four-character 
sayings — which help describe any given situation or put sentiments into
words in a nutshell. Mastering these popular Chinese expressions and know-
ing when to use them helps you put a welcoming smile on the face of the
native speaker when appropriate situations arise.
This chapter offers some idiomatic expressions that make you sound like a
native. You hear these expressions all the time in typical daily situations.
G∂ngxî G∂ngxî
goong-she goong-she; Congratulations!
You say g∂ngxî g∂ngxî for happy occasions when congratulations are in
order.
“My wife just had a baby!” your friend says. “Wow! I didn’t even know she was
pregnant,” you say. “G∂ngxî g∂ngxî!”
Your brother finally passes the Bar Exam (on the third try). G∂ngxî g∂ngxî!
Hey! You just turned 21. Now you can finally go to a bar. G∂ngxî g∂ngxî!
Let’s go!
On the Chinese New Year, you hear not only “g∂ngxî g∂ngxî,” but also
“g∂ngxî f≈cái” (goong she fah-tsye), which means “Congratulations and may
you prosper.”

Yí Lù Píng’≈n
ee loo peeng ahn; Bon Voyage! Have a good trip.
This is a great phrase to use when a friend or acquaintance is about to
embark on a long journey. When you see someone off at the airport, you hear
many people say this. You may want to teach your family and friends yí lù
píng’≈n before you board the plane!
Yì Yán Nán Jìn
ee yan nahn jeen; It’s a long story.
Maybe someone wants to know how you got that black eye. Maybe you don’t
really want to go into the details. Just say yì yán nán jìn to save the blow-by-
blow description for when you’re ready.
Mâmâ H∆h∆
mah mah hoo hoo; So-so.
The phrase mâmâ h∆h∆literally means “horse horse tiger tiger.” You use this
expression when you want to indicate a situation is just okay or mediocre.
Just barely pass that test? You did mâmâ h∆h∆. Slightly under the weather
today? You’re feeling mâmâ h∆h∆. Food at that new restaurant not so great?
It’s just mâmâ h∆h∆.
K≈i Wán Xiào
kye (rhymes with pie) wahn shyaow; Just kidding, or You’ve got to be 
kidding!
You say k≈i wán xiào when you can’t believe your ears. Suppose your co-
worker just told you she’s been fired, even though she was promoted only a
month ago. That definitely calls for a k≈i wán xiào in response. When she
finally tells you it’s not true, she adds k≈i wán xiào at the end. She was just
kidding. (Now you’re really angry.)
308

Máfan Nî
mah fahn nee; Sorry to trouble you.
You say máfan nî when, although you don’t want to put anyone out, you
politely accept an extended offer to do something for you. If you can’t reach
the salt at the other end of the dinner table and someone offers to pass it to
you, you say máfan nî. It means, “So sorry to trouble you, but would you
mind?”
You can also say something (or someone) is a real pain in the neck by pro-
claiming, “T≈hên máfan.” (He’s really a pain, or it’s really an inconvenient
annoyance.)
Zênme Yàng?
dzummuh yahng; How’s it going, or what’s up?
A great catch-all expression when you run into old friends and want to find
out how they’ve been or what they’re up to these days. You just say: Hey!
Zênme yàng?
You don’t say it to a stranger or someone you’ve just met in a more formal sit-
uation, but it’s a great expression to use between friends.
Another way you can use zênme is by adding “le” in place of “yàng” at the
end. (Nî zênme le?) If you do, you say, “Hey, what’s wrong with you?” Kind of
like, “What could you possibly have been thinking when you did such a
stupid thing?”
Qîng Wèn
cheeng one; Please, may I ask; excuse me, but . . .
Before you ask a question, be polite and preface it with qîng wèn. You’re
asking if you can even ask about something. You can use it when you go
shopping and need to address a store clerk:
Qîng wèn (Please, may I ask), how much is that thousand-year-old egg?
309
Chapter 19: Ten Favorite Chinese Expressions

You can also use it when you need directions and have to approach a total
stranger:
Qîng wèn (Excuse me), which bus can take me to the Temple of Heaven?
Zìjî Lái
dzuh jee lye; I’ll help myself, thanks.
The rules of Chinese eating etiquette dictate that you should never start to
fill up your plate before at least attempting to serve someone else first. Zìjî
lái is a polite expression you use to indicate that you can help yourself as
soon as someone starts to serve you. A host always starts to serve the guests
sitting closest, but the guests should always say zìjî lái (and then relent and
let the person serve them anyway) for each and every course. After the host
has started a dish, however, you may indeed begin to serve yourself.
And just as you should never serve yourself first, you should also never take
even a sip of alcohol without at least toasting someone else first (see Chapter
18 for more things you should never do). For that, you can say g≈nb√i! (gahn
bay; bottoms up!)
∑iyà!
eye yah; Oh my!
∑iyàs can be heard all over China whenever people feel frustrated, shocked,
or even just plain old annoyed. You hear it when you show up to your par-
ents’ home for dinner with a friend who looks like he’s in a punk rock band.
You may even say it yourself when you realize you left your briefcase in the
taxi, which is now halfway across town. And you definitely have an ≈iyá
moment when you wonder how to look anything up in a Chinese dictionary
after finding out that there’s no alphabet.

Chapter 20
Ten Phrases That Make You 
Sound Chinese
In This Chapter
 Saying the right things in social situations
 Maintaining your humility and graciousness
T
his chapter gives you phrases that help your conversation for many
social occasions. Knowing these phrases provides you with an authentic
flavor of Chinese culture and hospitality. Use them liberally to fit right in with
any crowd.
As you read this chapter, you may notice that the Chinese often repeat
phrases. Repeating words happens often in spoken Chinese.
Hu≈nyíng Hu≈nyíng!
hwan yeeng hwan yeeng; Welcome!
You use this phrase when guests arrive at your home or in your country to
make them feel right at home. And if you say hu≈nyíng zài lái (hwan yeeng
dzye lye) before they leave, it means you welcome them to come again. A bit
of Chinese hospitality in action.
Bîcî Bîcî
bee tsuh bee tsuh; Same to you; You too.
This little phrase comes in handy when someone wishes you well or gives
you a compliment that merits return so you don’t appear vain. What’s that
you say? Great looking dress I have on? Bîcî bîcî. (Yours looks great, too.)
May you have a long and happy retirement. Bîcî bîcî. (Same to you.)

Jiûyâng Jiûyâng
jyoe yahng jyoe yahng; Pleased to meet you; literally: I have admired you
for a long time.
Saying Jiûyâng jiûyâng when you first meet someone you’ve heard some-
thing about is a polite gesture.
Màn Màn Ch∫!
mahn mahn chir; Bon Appetit!
Be sure to say màn màn ch∫to the others at your table before you take your
first bite. You’ll win hearts all around. It actually means “eat real slowly”;
saying the phrase lets everyone know you hope they take their time and
enjoy the meal.
Wô Qîng Kè
waw cheeng kuh; It’s on me; My treat.
You hear this phrase day in and day out all over China. Everyone wants to be
the one to pay the bill (see Chapter 18), so folks make a big deal out of being
the first person to go to the hip when the check comes. Even if you don’t
mean it, ask for the bill at least once or twice while others protest. Whoever
keeps insisting gets to pay the bill.
Friends often make a joke by adding “nî fù qián” (nee foo chyan) at the end
of this phrase. If you hear someone say “wô qîng kè, nî fù qián,” it means
“I’ll take the bill, but you’ll be the one to pay it.” Only say this when you dine
with a good friend who can take a joke, however, or you’ll be sunk just when
you were starting to impress people with your newly acquired Chinese.
Yôu K∂ng Lái Wán
yo koong lye wahn; Please come again.
Just before guests leave your home, you should always say “Yôu k∂ng lái
wán.” (Literally: When you have time, come back and play.) Sometimes you
also hear people say “màn zôu,” (mahn dzoe) which literally means “walk
312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

slowly” and is loosely translated as “careful going home.” A good host doesn’t
forget to wish his or her guests well as they depart. The saying implies they’ll
be back again anyway. Chinese hospitality at its best.
When you’re in mainland China, you may hear the last word pronounced as
“wahr” rather than “wahn,” which is the way the Taiwanese pronounce it. In
fact, any time you hear a word end in “r,” it indicates the person is speaking a
northern dialect, like Mandarin spoken in Beijing. People in Taiwan speak in
one of the southern dialects, so they invariably pronounce certain words
with an “n” sound at the end rather than an “r” sound.
Láojià Láojià
laow jyah laow jyah; Excuse me; Pardon me.
Ever wonder what to say when you need to pass a person who’s standing in
your way? Especially if you find yourself in busy Shanghai where it often feels
like you’re in a sea of humanity, láojià láojià is exactly the phrase you want to
remember for crowded moments. It offers you a nice way of getting some-
one’s attention without being rude.
Zhù Nî Zâo Rì K≈ng Fú
joo nee dzaow ir kahng foo; Get well soon.
Hopefully you won’t have to use this expression too often, but if you do, at
least the folks hearing it will know your colloquial Chinese is good. You’ll fit
right in with the rest of the well-wishers, and your Chinese friends are sure to
appreciate your good wishes.
Búkèqi
boo kuh chee; You’re welcome; No problem; Don’t mention it.
You say búkèqi as the bookend to xièxiè (shyeh shyeh; thanks). You can’t say
one without expecting to hear the other. Búkèqi represents more than just a
response to “thank you,” however. It’s part and parcel of a larger group of
words that express a humble spirit, which the Chinese always treasure in
friends and acquaintances. If someone thanks you profusely for something
you do, whether big or small, never accept the thanks as something you
agree you deserve. Giving yourself a pat on the back is the opposite of what
313
Chapter 20: Ten Phrases That Make You Sound Chinese

you want to convey. Always make it sound like your deed is no big deal,
something you prefer to downplay. Doing so puts you in the correct frame of
mind for the kind of public humility prized by the Chinese. (See Chapter 18
for more tips on Chinese faux pas.)
Hâo Jiû Méi Jiàn
how jyoe may jyan; Long time no see.
You can use this phrase in all seriousness or in jest if you’ve just seen some-
one an hour before. Either way, it puts people in a good mood to know that
you care about being in their presence again. You can even say it to your
Chinese For Dummies book if it stays on your bookshelf for too long.
