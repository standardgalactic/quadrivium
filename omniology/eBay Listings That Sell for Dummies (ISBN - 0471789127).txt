About the Authors
Marsha Collier spends most of her time on things related to eBay. She’s a
charter member eBay PowerSeller, as well as one of the original instructors
for eBay University. As a columnist, an author of four best-selling books on
eBay, a television and radio expert, and a lecturer, she shares her knowledge
of eBay with millions of online shoppers. Thousands of eBay fans also visit
her Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, to get Marsha’s latest insights on 
e-commerce.
Out of college, Marsha worked in fashion advertising for the Miami Herald
and then as special-projects manager for the Los Angeles Daily News. She also
founded a home-based advertising and marketing business. Her successful
business, the Collier Company, Inc., was featured by Entrepreneur magazine in
1986, and in 1990, Marsha’s company received the Small Business of the Year
award from her California State Assemblyman and the Northridge Chamber of
Commerce.
Bargains drew Marsha to eBay in 1996, but profitable sales keep her busy on
the site now. Marsha applies her business acumen and photography skills to
her eBay business — and in this book, she shares her knowledge about what
makes good, profit-promoting listings on eBay.
Patti “Louise” Ruby, an Indianapolis native, was born to work on a computer.
In junior high, she took a class in the programming language Fortran. She
excelled and enjoyed the class: The die was cast. Patti went through several
jobs as a programmer and then became a consultant.
In the late ’90s, Patti was part-owner of an antique mall, and coincidentally
found a Web site called AuctionWeb (the original eBay). She was fascinated by
the concept, and began selling on the site. She also became an integral part of
the chat rooms, which initially served as loose customer support where users
helped other users. Patti’s ease with computers helped many a new user feel
comfortable on the boards — and with using the AuctionWeb system.
In February 1997, Patti was hired as AuctionWeb’s second Customer Support
Representative. In this position, she became the main interface between the
engineering staff and the user community, where she communicated mem-
bers’ “bug” reports and suggestions for site enhancements. When AuctionWeb
became the new eBay site in the fall of 1997, she headed up a “live” question-
and-answer board that was set up to help members make the transition
between platforms.

In 1999, eBay started a traveling show called eBay University (where Patti
first met Marsha), and she has been a lead instructor since its inception.
Patti “retired” from eBay in February 2002, after five challenging, exciting
years. Being a part of the early eBay years gave her the opportunity to watch
the company grow from a small neighborhood market to the worldwide 
marketplace it is today. She has continued to buy and sell on eBay. She
laughs, “. . .once you’ve discovered eBay, there is no escape!”

Dedication
Marsha and Patti dedicate this book to the thousands of members of the
eBay community who strive for better listings and higher revenues. We know
just how difficult the striving can be and want to help in every way we can.
We hope to meet as many of you as possible at eBay University classes and
eBay Live.
We take our lead from the legions of sellers who continue to inspire us to do
what we can to carry them through the fun, challenging, and profitable jour-
ney we call eBay.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Without the amazing talents of Leah Cameron and Barry Childs-Helton, this
book would not be one iota as good as it is (and it really is darn good). They
are one top-drawer editorial team, and only by working with them can you
possibly know how very talented (and patient) they are. We’d also like to
thank our tech editor, Cindy Lichfield, for going over the book — and check-
ing it twice!
Steven Hayes, thank you. You’re always thinking and working a new angle. Its
part of what makes working with you fun.
Andy Cummings, it’s wonderful that someone as high up on the corporate
food chain as you really cares about the writers. You’re a rarity in the pub-
lishing field.
Patti would like to thank Marsha for sharing this book with her. Patti says, “I
always admired Marsha for what she was able to accomplish; now I know
firsthand what a tremendous job it is she does! I’d also like to acknowledge
my family, who has continued to display their unfailing belief in me, and
David, as always, most of all.”

Introduction
I
f we were to catalog all the misinformation we’ve seen about selling on
eBay, it might take days! We wrote this book to get you started in the right
direction, and even provide some shortcuts.
Marsha has been writing eBay reference books since 1998, selling on eBay
since 1996, tracking the buying trends as they change from year to year, and
keeping her readers clued in about the differences as they crop up. In her
ongoing quest for eBay accuracy in the midst of complexity, she’s joined
forces with Patti Ruby, her ace technical editor on previous books. Result: a
fearless venture into the intricacies of selling, of taming the dreaded HTML,
of attracting more eBay profits!
(By the way: Thank you if you’ve bought eBay For Dummies books before —
and if this is your first one, welcome. We’re sure this book will add some
high-caliber know-how to your eBay selling arsenal.)
There are good ways to display your eBay listings, and there are bad ways.
How many times have you opened an item on eBay and found barely enough
of a description to identify the item — especially if the listing had no picture!
(Let’s see . . . you didn’t buy that item, right? Call it a hunch.) That one exam-
ple is just the tip of the eBay-mistake iceberg. In this book, we set you on the
path to efficient listing content and attractive online appearance for your
item — and we show you how to produce your listings in record time. The
aim, of course, is to beat out your competition and rake in those elusive
bidder-dollars.
The pictures that display your item online are an entirely separate ball of wax
(so to speak). Lots of books supposedly tell you how to take good photos for
eBay auctions, but it seems to me that those books try to teach you how to
take high-quality family pictures instead. They don’t seem to take into
account that photography for eBay has to be rapid-fire and accurate. Your
goal is to produce an image of decent quality that will last for the next 7 to 10
days, maximum. Because your time is valuable, this book doesn’t bog you
down with pages of unnecessary technical garbage. It gives you the informa-
tion you absolutely need to know to produce the right kind of product image,
and nothing more.

The bulk of the information you find in this book is not covered in depth in
any of the other For Dummies books on eBay. Due to the nature of the other
books, there just wasn’t the space to devote to such specifics about HTML
and photography. So this book gives you all the handy, practical information
on these topics that you’ve asked for over the years — and having put it
down here, moves on. Enjoy!
About This Book
This book isn’t written in a linear style, and you don’t have to read it right
through like a novel, either. You can check out the titles of the chapters in the
Table of Contents, and when you find something that interests you, just flip 
to that page and start reading. When you have a question on something

We can help you!
Patti Ruby — or “Louise” as she was known on
the eBay chat boards — was one of the very
first pinks on eBay. (A pink is a customer-sup-
port person whose job includes posting on the
chat and message boards. These posts are
highlighted in pink so eBay members will know
that they come from “official” eBay employees.)
In February 1997, Patti joined eBay as a con-
tractor, handling customer support from her
home in Indianapolis. She was the second
person that Pierre (eBay’s founder) contracted
with to handle the ever-growing chat on the
eBay community boards. The first person in
those trenches was eBay’s indomitable Jim
“Griff” Griffith, who made eBay posts from his
computer in his Vermont studio. Patti “retired”
from her eBay employment in 2002, and Griff still
carries the flag for the rest of us at eBay.
Both Patti and Marsha have spent many hours
buying and selling on eBay. In her mysterious
past, Patti was a coder — one of those wizards
smart enough to write the code that makes
computer programs do their magic. Meanwhile,
Marsha was working in the hustle and bustle of
retail advertising — and as a photo stylist for
retail catalogs, she gleaned arcane tips from
professional photographers (including gurus of
product photography). So you can see why we
wanted to write this book: We wanted to share
some really useful stuff from our earlier careers.
Well, okay, we also had an ulterior motive: To
elevate (in our own little way) the quality of the
item listings on eBay — and to add to the
bottom line of the sellers who heed our advice.
We promise to make things as simple as 
possible — hey, we know you can handle the
complexities, but why bother if you don’t have
to? We’d rather see you spending your time
packing and shipping profitable items!
In our spare time (what’s that?), we teach in var-
ious venues around the country for eBay
University with Griff. We are both “lead”
instructors — which means we don’t ever get
to teach at the same time. But we’ve both
watched eBay change from a homey commu-
nity of friendly collectors to a behemoth Web
site, now teeming with tens of thousands of cat-
egories of items and over 150 million registered
users. Funny, the rules for listing a successful
auction now aren’t much different from what
they were back in the day. People still make
money by following them.

particular, we suggest you slide to the back of the book and visit our very-
nicely-put-together Index. (Our publisher, Wiley Publishing, Inc., does a thor-
ough index, and you should be able to connect to just about anything in this
book from there.)
There’s no need to even take notes when you read this book. Just dog-ear the
corner and use a highlighter. That’s the sign of a well-read, well-studied book.
While you’re folding and marking, you can find answers to lots of important
questions as we take you through the following tracks:
 Seeing what makes eBay photography different from traditional digital
camera work
 Discovering “just-enough” HTML to make an attractive listing and yet
not waste your time
 Designing your own reusable listing templates (or use ours!)
 Setting up for specific, unique photographic situations
 Deciding what additional software you might need for your eBay listings
 Finding and using the right camera and equipment
 Getting what you need to produce quality images for eBay
Our Foolish Assumptions
Anyone who buys this book is either currently selling on eBay or is seriously
planning on making some money online. In our tenure at eBay University, we
have seen documentation stating that the average eBay user takes about 80
minutes to put together an eBay listing. We can hear the chorus now: An hour
and 20 minutes . . . are you kidding? How could anyone possibly list enough
items to run a business if listing one item takes this long?
Our goal is to shave those 80 minutes into a maximum of 5. Five minutes from
start to finish. Time is money, and the more items you can list, the more
money you can make. We assume that making money is a serious goal for you
as well.
Are we right? If it’s time to buckle down and make some serious cash, this is
the book for you. Below are some other foolish assumptions we’ve made
about you:
 You have a computer and an Internet connection.
 You’ve bought and sold at eBay and are fairly familiar with how it works.
 You would like to have nicer-looking listings than you currently have.
 You’ve had an issue or two with taking a good picture.
3
Introduction

 You’d like to doll up your listings and give them some extra, added
punch.
 You feel that working from home in jeans and a sweatshirt is a great
idea.
If you can say yes to our foolish assumptions, we’re off and running! Both
Patti and I are about to flood your head with lots of stuff that can (upon thor-
ough digesting) speed up your day and boost you toward reaching your sales
goals! Take a few moments to read the following section to get a feel for how
we’ve put together this book.
Conventions Used in This Book
Our publisher loves that word conventions, and we like it because it reminds
us of going to parties and collecting free stuff that we can resell on eBay. But
that’s not the type of convention they want us to talk about here. The pub-
lisher’s conventions are consistent ways of presenting the stuff in this book.
So here’s how they work . . .
Tiptoeing through the steps
When faced with a somewhat daunting task, we often take you through it in a
numbered, step-by-step fashion. We separate and number the steps, like this:
1. Acquire a bag of cookies.
2. Carefully tear open the bag.
Make sure that you leave the bag opening in good enough shape that
resealing is possible — assuming, of course, that you don’t plan to eat
all the cookies at once.
3. Insert three fingers and pull out selected cookie.
We like to use three fingers because using more just gets messy and too
much chocolate on your fingers can really be a bother, but you may find
that two will do in some instances.
4. Stuff cookie in mouth and chew.
We like this method! (Of course, we’re talking about the instruction method,
but we like how it works for cookies, too.) And we try to keep the instructions
simple — pretty much because we also prefer easy-to-follow instructions.

eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

Watching the icons, yes, I con . . .
You’re going to see some icons and sidebars in this book; our editors seem to
think that some of this is optional reading material. Harrumph. We want you
to know that we feel every single word is indispensable. (Okay, sure, you may
be more drawn to some topics than to others.) Although the sidebars will be
separate from the text, we put them in to add a little spice — to give you an
extra bit of information to emphasize the current lesson. We write ’em
because we want you to read ’em. Enough said?
You’ll also notice some clever little icons in the margins that point out some
very important facts that you need to know. They’re often the online equiva-
lent of the laws of nature: truths that it would be foolhardy to ignore.
And about that HTML code . . .
If you’ve ever suspected that telling a computer to do something means using
language weirdly, you’re right. So we use a strange font to highlight the HTML
commands that are plentiful in the book. If, for example, you want to tell your
computer to set off type in bold text (with italics for emphasis), the HTML
that does that job looks like this:
<b>My auctions look gud</b>, now all I <i>need</i> is a spell-checker!
How This Book Is Organized
As with all the books in the For Dummies line, the information in this book is
neatly tucked into several different parts. The goal is to make it easier for you
to progress through from the beginning to the advanced information we’re
offering — or, if you jump around in it like a Jack Russell Terrier, to make sure
you always know where to find what you’re jumping to.
We’ve laid out this book in five parts.
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics
We start you off gently with the basics of online presentation, HTML, and
photography — exclusively as they apply to eBay sellers. Remember that
selling is the goal of this book. It’s no accident that we focus these important
topics in that direction.
5
Introduction

Here in this part you find out why our philosophy of “eBay, HTML, and
Photography” is different from everything you may have encountered in
other books. The way we see it, all you want to do is post clean listings that
sell your items for high prices. Okay, that’s our bias as eBay sellers with back-
grounds in marketing and selling. We figured you wouldn’t mind.
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML
Following our theory that “less is more,” here’s where you go to discover how
to set up some good-looking auctions yourself — and move the stuff with
minimum fluff. That means (be brave) venturing into HTML, but the good
news is that some of the best tools for working with it already exist on your
computer. For example, did you know that the Verdana font was developed
exclusively to make video-monitor text easier to read? It was designed by a
world-renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, and Monotype’s Tom Rickner.
In the family of Verdana sans-serif fonts, you can see unique examples of type
design that’s just right for the computer screen.
We show you, step by step, how to gussy up your listings efficiently. As we get
into more and more advanced HTML coding, Patti’s no-baloney approach
speeds up your learning curve to Warp Factor 9. She’ll have you designing
listings with all the cool options you need in no time at all. You’ll be glad to
have her expertise at your side as you design your auctions.
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars
In Part III, we get the benefit of Marsha’s years in professional photography.
We’ve based this part on a pretty safe hunch: that 98 percent of all digital
camera users haven’t a clue about how to use half the options available on
their cameras. This part is where you see how to use your camera to its
fullest — and get the skinny on setting up your own eBay photo studio.
Since lighting is so crucial to tweaking out the details of an item, this part
also gives you the scoop on how lighting affects your final images. It’s almost
scary to know that changing a mere light bulb can mean a big change in the
way your camera (and later, your buyer) sees your merchandise. But it’s true.
We also get into the best ways to photograph metals and gems. Part III shows
you how to get the correct coloring the first time without having to drag your
digital photo into Photoshop for major alterations. The “secrets” are all here.
When you have pondered these matters deeply, grasshopper, you’ll be able
to move from camera to listing in three minutes flat.

eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

Part IV: Advanced Applications 
for Your Newfound Skills
In Part IV, you find out which software programs can help you with your list-
ings with a minimal amount of pomp and circumstance. (Remember that
making money and saving time are our goals — not entering our images in an
art contest.) We point you in the direction of easily available software that
you can use to generate and edit digital images that grab the viewer (figura-
tively) and sell the item (literally). Hey, it’s an art.
We also expand your selling horizons beyond eBay. This part introduces you
to some extended skills that can help you design and open a super eBay
Store (without paying extra for pre-built graphic on-screen nonsense). We
also show you how to get your listings seen on other selling Web sites such
as Amazon.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Tradition dictates that nobody can write a Dummies book without including
the very traditional Part of Tens. (We also get to have some fun in this sec-
tion, but don’t tell our editors we said so.) We debunk some online photogra-
phy myths and show you ten tips for your auction designs.
Icons Used in This Book
If there’s something we really want you to know, we interrupt our (and your)
train of thought with a tip. We’re a very excitable pair when it comes to get-
ting folks up to speed on these subjects — and sometimes things we’ve
learned just bubble up until we can’t hold them in. So here they are, with the
For Dummies Tip icon in the margin next to them. Follow the tip, and you’ll be
right on target!
We think that “senior moment” is an unfair term. We’ve been forgetting things
since the early ’70s (hmmmm, I wonder why?). At any rate, we point out
these important-to-remember ideas with the “finger” (the one with the string
around it), so you won’t forget them.
7
Introduction

Yep, we’ve all become victims of our own foolishness at one time or another.
We put this little bomb icon next to things that can figuratively “blow up in
your face.” (We’ve left out the traditional photos of the guy taking photos of
large polished silver vessels in his underwear — but if we did publish them,
they’d definitely have the Warning icon next to them.)
Occasionally, as memory serves, we’ll throw in an interesting little story that
applies to the current topic. Each story is either something that we’ve done
ourselves, or something we’ve learned from other eBay sellers. Whatever
these stories’ origins are, we promise they’ll be fun (and don’t be surprised if
they’re useful, too).
Where Do You Go from Here?
Take the information we give you in this book and, well, play with it. HTML
coding can be fun (really, we promise) — and so is taking pictures. Play with
our instructions and use the knowledge to post better listings.
Better Listings + Better Photographs = More Money
Isn’t that the goal we’re working toward?
Our goal is to give you a boost toward building your eBay business. Marsha’s
Web site has been garnering good stuff for that purpose for years:
www.coolebaytools.com
CooleBayTools is the Web site for the For Dummies books regarding eBay.
Here you’ll find interesting articles by Marsha and a special area where you
can reach Patti. We also have a monthly newsletter you can sign up for that
(with any luck) arrives every month. (Auction Anecdotes are also gratefully
accepted! Please, send only true ones that we can publish, okay?) Also,
please realize that we read every e-mail — in our (ahem) copious free time.
But because we have our own eBay businesses, teach for eBay U, and try to
have lives, we can’t respond to everyone individually. But we do send out a
newsletter that answers many of questions we get. Like eBay, it’s as much a
life as it is a living.

Part I
Getting Chummy
with the Basics

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you run through a crash course in eBay-
listing essentials that you may already know — or, at
least, kind-of know. The purpose of this part is to get you
grounded with the important how-tos and what-fors. Once
you have this subject matter under your belt, you’ll be
ready to build on that knowledge and become an expert at
creating listings that sell.

Chapter 1
Attracting Buyers with Your 
eBay Listing
In This Chapter
 Matching listings to your goods and your style
 Attracting attention to your listings
 Using the tools and techniques that make catchy listings
 Copywriting, eBay style
W
hy is it that some eBay sellers are successful while others can’t seem
to move their similar items? We get e-mails every day from sellers
who just can’t figure out why their listings aren’t generating sales. For some
reason, they’re not moving items as quickly as they feel they should. And
they sense that other sellers are highly successful despite those sellers’ con-
fusing and overly graphic ads.
This quandary sets the stage for the advice in this chapter and the how-to
information in this book. Your item listings (and more specifically, the text
and images you include there) become your face to the buyers, and your auc-
tions reflect your image. When you walk into a retail store; the décor projects
an image. A visit to K-Mart (with the Blue Light Special blaring from above)
gives you an entirely different feeling than does your stroll into Nordstrom
(and subsequent lull into shopping heaven via the music of a pianist). This is
the goal for your eBay listings: to make prospective customers feel com-
fortable spending their money with you.
Creating Listings That Are Uniquely You
As a seller, you may be tempted to adopt the selling style of other people
whom you perceive as successful (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?).
But have you done the research to see whether the “professional” you’re

tempted to emulate is truly a “success?” Heck, even the pros have been
known to do it; rumor has it that Marsha (early on in her eBay days) tried
copying the style of a seller who sold hundreds of items a day. (Hey, learn by
doing.) But no matter how she tried, no dice — until she did a little home-
work and figured out that there was more to this seller than met the eye.
Sometimes the only way to know the real story is to do some online research.
Marsha looked at the completed listings from the “big-time” seller — and
found that only about 1 in 20 of the listings resulted in the item being sold. So
how on earth could this person be such a huge success on eBay? Here’s the
scoop:
 Quantity does matter: The seller listed hundreds of items per day, and
whatever sold, sold. If it didn’t sell on eBay, the item then came up for
sale in the seller’s retail location.
 Service fees make money, too: This seller was an eBay Trading Assistant
(a seller who sells items on eBay for those who choose not to sell their
own) — and charged clients a minimum fee to cover the time and
expenses for every item listed.
Research — whether it’s for an item you plan on selling or buying, or for just
about any situation you face on eBay — is your number-one tool for success.
If you think that a certain seller is a whiz-bang success, confirm your suspi-
cions by taking a look at that seller’s completed listings.
As sellers, you need to concentrate on what works best for your own style of
listings and the type of items you sell. Learning from other sellers can be
helpful, but copying the look of someone else’s listings is really a waste of
time (not to mention unfair to the person who worked hard to develop his or
her own branded templates).
Oddly enough, whether you sell auto parts or designer dresses, the basic
rules for successful listings (which we outline in this book) are the same. You
may choose different colors for your descriptive text (as an automotive seller
versus a fashion peddler), but all the information this book provides about
the structure and content of your listing still applies. 
A successful listing gives prospective buyers the right information — in a
pleasing manner that entices them to either place a bid or click the Buy It
Now button. It’s as simple as that!

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

Making Your Listing Stand Out 
from the Others
Aside from all the sage advice we give you in this book, eBay — not so sur-
prisingly — offers you a good many options to up the value of your listings.
Prudent use of these options (translation: not spending too much of your
profits on them) can bring greater attention to your listings; Figure 1-1 shows
a typical listing that uses them successfully. Here are a few of the more popu-
lar options:
 Buy It Now (BIN): Gives your buyers the benefit of their two favorite
options: auctions and fixed-price sales. For a fee from 5 to 25 cents
(depending on the BIN price), you can sell your item directly to the first
buyer who meets the fixed price (optional), or if someone places a bid,
the Buy It Now option disappears.
 Subtitle: Wow. When eBay first came out with this option, we thought
that it was a pretty darned expensive tool. Fifty cents is an awful lot of
coin to pay for additional text to appear next to your title — especially
since that text is findable only when a potential buyer searches for title
and description. But (being the open-minded sellers we are) we thought
we’d give it a try. Double wow, son-of-a-gun, it works.
Figure 1-1:

13
Chapter 1: Attracting Buyers with Your eBay Listing

All but a miniscule number of searches for items are run for “title only,”
so the cost of including a descriptive subtitle can be worth it! For exam-
ple, a subtitle works really well when you have a lot of competition
(meaning lots of other sellers are selling the same item). By putting
together a well-phrased, 55-character subtitle, you can pull the buyers’
eyes right off the competition’s listings and onto yours. Figure 1-2 shows
you a listing that takes full advantage of the subtitle option.
 Bold Title: When you select the Bold option, your listing appears in
boldface type in searches, as well as in category browsing. It’s a good
option to use if you’re in competition with other sellers hawking the
same items. But we suggest you use this option only if your item can sell
for a good price; otherwise the $1 bold fee can take a large chunk out of
your profits!
 Highlight: Let’s hear it for the big yellow highlighter! Nothing like it for
getting to the gist of a book. Strangely, however (beats us as to why), the
eBay highlight feature is lilac. Be sure to look at the category in which
you choose to list before selecting this feature. Some categories (such as
Home Page Featured) are overwhelmed with sellers using the highlight
option — the pages look completely shaded in lilac. In these categories,
not using highlight (and using perhaps a bold title instead) might make
your listing stand out even more.

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

Five dollars is a pretty large investment to make in an option, so be sure
that it will really work for you before laying down that kind of scratch.
 Box border: Here’s one of my personal favorites. You can put a box
around your listing to draw the page viewers’ eyes right to your item.
Using a box border is attention-getting — and a real bargain to boot — at
only $3! For some reason, sellers occasionally choose to use this option
in combination with the Highlight option, which hikes their additional
fees to $8. Why use both when the box alone will do the trick for your
item?
 Home Page Featured: Location, location, location is the byword for
prime real estate; the Home Page Featured option gives you the highest
level of visibility at eBay: a spot on the home page. Your listing may
show up in that captivating little box that appears smack dab in the
center of the eBay Home page — although there’s no guarantee that it
will. But since a huge percentage of visitors to the eBay site enter
through — and scour — the home page, they tend to be attracted to this
boxed area, and usually click the See All Featured Items link. This link
leads them to the special Featured Items auction section. When you list
with this option, your item is also featured (at the top of the page) on
the individual category pages of the featured items (kinda hard to miss).
Bidders browse the Featured Items tabs (Auctions, Buy It Now, or All
Items) to see what’s listed in there, just as you might make a beeline to
the New Releases section of your video store. The charges that put your
listing in this special area are $39.95 to list a single Home Page Featured
item and $79.95 for multiple items.
Figure 1-3 shows a typical example from The eBay Home Page Featured
section, featuring some popular options: Bold, Highlight, Box and
Gallery. (And yes, sometimes the Home Page Featured sellers go a bit
overboard on the options!)
 Featured Plus!: To get top billing on an eBay page, you can list your item
with the Featured Plus! option for $19.95. This option puts your listing
on the first page of your item category, as well as at the top of most
search-results pages that find it. This option works well for moving spe-
cial merchandise and setting yourself apart from the competition.
Remember your budget: Will your item bring in enough profit to make it
worth the 20 bucks to list it at the top of the page? If you feel this is the
case, go for it. Figure 1-4 shows how items appear when listed at the top
of the page after they’re “Featured” in Category listings or searches.

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

 Gallery Picture: This is one of the few “musts” in our eBay repertoire.
For only 35 cents, you can display a mini-postage-stamp-size version of
your item’s picture next to its title. This Gallery picture shows up when a
prospective buyer is browsing in a category or performing a search and
perusing the results.
If you don’t use a Gallery picture and just include a picture in your
description, eBay displays a silly green camera icon next to your listing.
There’s no way that the little camera icon can compete with the other
sellers’ appropriately placed Gallery images. Bottom line: If you’re going
to sell, you’d better spend that 35 cents for the extra exposure.
If you’re selling a media product such as a book, CD, or DVD, eBay supplies
the picture for you; it doesn’t get any easier than that. For the same 35 cents,
eBay will show a stock picture (and some pre-filled text) fed in from an online
media library. All you have to do is type in the number below the barcode
(the ISBN or UPC code number) as found on the back of your item in the Pre-
filled information, find your item area, and eBay does the rest. You can also
input the author’s or artist’s name, or the work’s title. If you choose this input
method, eBay presents you with a page of images to select from. eBay also
adds stock information (a prewritten description of the item) about your
media item in the description.
Figure 1-5 shows you the area from the Sell Your Item (SYI) form where you
input your data, and Figure 1-6 shows you how the picture appears in the 
listing.

Chapter 1: Attracting Buyers with Your eBay Listing

Constructing Catchy Listings
You have several things to keep in mind when creating listings that will draw
the eyes (and the wallets) of the buying market. For example, you need a
catchy title and a winning description. Read on to see the ultimate tips to
luring bidders to your sales.
Writing a title that sells
Your title is (next to your Gallery image) the most important way to draw
people to your listing. eBay buyers are search-engine-driven — they find
most of their items by typing selected keywords into the search box and
clicking the Search button. Those keywords should be all your title consists
of. No fancy prose. No silly words that people won’t search for. Here are a few
examples of eBay’s worst title words:
 L@@K
 Nice
 WOW
 RARE
Do yourself a favor — never include these words in your title. No one ever
searches for these words — ever! (For that matter, nobody’s looking for “!!!!!!”
in the title, either. Can’t think why . . . )
Figure 1-6:
Here’s the

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

Okay, we’re gonna say it up front: If you’ve finished writing your item title and
you have spaces left over, please fight the urge to dress it up with lots of
exclamation points and asterisks. No matter how gung-ho you are about your
item, the eBay search engine may overlook your item if the title is encrusted
with meaningless ****, $$$$, and !!!! symbols. If bidders do see your title, they
may become annoyed by their virtual shrillness and ignore them!!!!!!!! (See
what I mean?)
Another distracting habit is overdoing capital letters. To buyers, seeing
everything in caps is LIKE SEEING A CRAZED SALESMAN SCREAMING AT
THEM TO BUY NOW! Using all caps online is considered shouting — it’s
annoying and tough on the eyes. Use capitalization SPARINGLY, and only to
finesse a particular point or name.
Look for keywords that pay off
Hands down, the most valuable real estate on eBay is the 55-character title of
your item. The majority of buyers do title searches, and that’s where your
item must come up if it’s going to be sold!
Here are some ideas to help you fill in the keywords in your item title:
 Use the most common name for the item, and only if there’s room, list
the alternate name. For example, say salt shaker, and if there’s room, add
saltcellar.
 If the item is actually rare or hard to find, okay, mention that. But instead
of the word RARE (so overused it’s practically invisible), include the
acronyms (OOAK, OOP, or HTF) that eBay users have come to rely on.
(No, they aren’t cartoon noises; the table in the next section lists what
they mean.)
 Mention the item’s condition and whether it’s new or old. When applica-
ble (as with gently used items), include the item’s age or date of manu-
facture.
 Mention the item’s special qualities, such as its style (for a handbag),
model (for a camera), or edition (for a book).
 Include brand names, if those names are significant. If you’re selling a
for-real Tiffany lamp, you want people to know it!
 State the size of the item or other descriptive information, such as color
or material content.

eBay lingo at a glance
Here’s a crash course in eBay lingo that can help bring you up to speed on
attracting buyers to your auction. Table 1-1 summarizes some abbreviations
used frequently in eBay auctions; they can do wonders to jump-start your title.
Also, a whole smattering of acronyms that abbreviate item characteristics 
are part of the eBay business experience. As eBay has grown, so has this spe-
cialized lingo. Members use these acronyms as shortcuts to describe their
merchandise.
So here, as promised, is Table 1-1: a handy list of common acronyms and
related phrases used to describe items on eBay. (Hint: Mint means “may as
well be brand new,” not “cool chocolate treat attached.”)

OOAK
One of a kind
You are selling the only one in existence!
NR
No Reserve Price
You can set a reserve price when you
begin your auction. If bids don’t meet
the reserve, you don’t have to sell. Many
buyers are leery of reserve prices
because they’re after a more obvious
bargain. If you’re not listing a reserve
price for your item, let bidders know.

sure that you mean it and that you’re using it accurately. Don’t label something
MIB (Mint in Box) when it looks like it’s been Mashed in Box by a meat-
grinder. You’ll find more abbreviations on Marsha’s Web site at www.cool
ebaytools.com.
Use the spell checker to verify your titling! It bears repeating: Check and
recheck your spelling. Savvy buyers use the eBay search engine to find mer-
chandise; if the name of your item is spelled wrong, the search engine can’t
find it. In addition, poor spelling and incomprehensible grammar reflect badly
on you. If you’re in competition with another seller, the buyer is likelier to
trust the seller hoo nose gud speling.
Adding information with a subtitle
eBay allows you to buy an additional 55-character subtitle, which will appear
under your item title in a search or in a category browse. The fee for this
extra promotion is 50 cents; in a few circumstances, it may be worth your
while. Any text you input will really make your item stand out in the crowd —
but (You knew there would be a but, didn’t you?) these additional characters
don’t come up in a title search. So if you have the same words as your subti-
tle in your description, the words will be found either way with a title and
description search. The benefit of the subtitle is that it makes your listing
stand out when users browse or look up searches.
Gathering the tools you’ll need
Throughout this book, we talk about adding selling power to your listings by
applying your skills with photography and HTML. A little knowledge and a
few tools are all you need to compete with the big guys. As a matter of fact,
you may not need every bit of information in this book. But we want to give
you plenty of options and insight into what you need to know to compete.

Chapter 1: Attracting Buyers with Your eBay Listing

The big guys — Bose, Hewlett Packard (HP), Sony, Disney, all those big-time
merchants that sell on eBay — attract buyers with exactly the same methods
you find in this book. Pick out your chapters and use the information that
applies to your needs, as follows:
 If you’re interested in spicing up the appearance of your listing text, get
yourself a text editor and get ready to brush up on your HTML skills. For
example, you can use Windows Notepad and the free “try before you
buy” version of a major program: CuteHTML 2.3.
 If you want your product photos to do the work, check out the photogra-
phy tricks that you can accomplish with a simple digital camera and
inexpensive accessory equipment. Try a snappy little software called
Fast Photos (there’s a free trial on the coolebaytools.com Web site).
We promise that this book’s advice on improving the text and pictures you
use in your listings will serve you well. Your mission (should you decide to
accept it) is to ease into using them. At first, take baby steps toward enhanc-
ing your item listings. As your online business grows, you can expand your
methods and offerings — but only if you want to.
Copywriting, eBay-style
A fabulous description goes a long way to upping your bottom line. Those
aforementioned big guys don’t leave any details out of their descriptions, so
why should you? Don’t think Hemingway here; think infomercial. Figure 1-7
shows a listing with a great description — and yours can be magnificent. All
you have to do is click in the Description text box of the Sell Your Item form
and start typing — glancing at this book now and then for sage guidance, of
course.

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

Here’s a list of suggestions for writing an effective item description:
 List the item’s benefits. Give the buyer a reason to buy your item and be
enthusiastic when you list all the reasons everyone should bid on it.
Unlike the listing’s title, you can use as much space as you want. Be 
precise in your description: tell how big it is, what color, what kind of
fabric, what design, and so on. Also, mention any alternative uses for the
item — perhaps those pantyhose can also be used for straining yogurt?
 Include the negative. Don’t hide the truth of your item’s condition.
Trying to conceal flaws costs you in the long run — in terms of (for
openers) returned items, bad feedback, or (at very worst) a fraud inves-
tigation. If the item has a scratch, a nick, a dent, a crack, a ding, a tear, a
rip, missing pieces, replacement parts, faded color, dirty smudges, or a
bad smell (especially if cleaning might damage the item), mention it in
the description. If your item has been overhauled, rebuilt, repainted, or
hot-rodded, say so. You don’t want the buyer to flip out because you
weren’t truthful about imperfections or modifications.
 Promote your other listings. The pros always do a little cross-promotion,
and it works. When the hosts on the morning news tell you to tune in 
for something special, they’re trying to prevent you from turning to the
competition. So, a word to the wise: If you’re selling photography equip-
ment and cat toys, be sure to point to both store categories.
 While you’re at it, promote yourself, too. As you build your feedback
rating, point out your terrific track record to potential bidders. Add
statements like “I’m great to deal with. Check out my feedback.” You can
even take it a step farther by inviting prospective bidders to your About
Me page (where you may also include a link to your personal Web site if
you have one).
 Spell out pre-sale details. Occasionally, sellers offer an item as a pre-sell,
or an item that the seller doesn’t yet have in stock but expects to. If
you’re offering this kind of item, make sure that you spell out all the
details in the description. 
eBay policy (and Federal Trade Commission law) states that you must
ship a pre-sell item within 30 days of receiving payment, so be sure you
will have the item within that time span. Also don’t forget to include the
actual shipping date. And don’t forget that putting up an item for sale with-
out actually having it in hand is a practice fraught with risk. The item you
are expecting may not arrive in time, or it may arrive damaged. We’ve
heard too many sad tales of sellers who got caught in this situation — and
had to go out and purchase an item at retail for a buyer in order to pre-
serve their feedback.
 Invite questions. Make the buyer comfortable with the idea of e-mailing
you with a question. Some sellers seem way too busy (or full of them-
selves) in their text to make you want to ask a question. Remember, 
customer service is the key to high bids.
23
Chapter 1: Attracting Buyers with Your eBay Listing

 Wish your potential bidders well. Communication is the key to a good
transaction, and you can set the tone for your auction and post-auction
exchanges by including some simple phrases that show your friendly
side. Always end your description by wishing bidders good luck, inviting
potential bidders to e-mail you with questions, and offering the option of
providing additional photos of the item if you have them.
Like stores that hang signs saying “No shirt, no shoes, no service,” eBay
members can refuse to do business with other members. You have the right
to be selective (within reason and the law, of course) about whom you want
as a prospective buyer for your item. The listing is yours, and you can pro-
tect your investment any way you want. However, you can’t discriminate or
break any state or federal laws in your description. If you’ve had bad experi-
ences with certain members of the eBay community, you may block them as
bidders from your business. Just don’t be rude and negative. There’s no
faster way to turn off a bidder than by having more warnings and rules than
you have description. Take a look at Figure 1-8 for a listing that doesn’t
exactly exude customer service.
Following our tips will go a long way to helping you raise your bottom line.
Since there are two of us, we offer two unique perspectives for enhancing an
item description. Here they are:
 Remember what your English teacher taught you. Make your descrip-
tion like a woman’s skirt: Long enough to cover the subject but short
enough to keep it interesting.
 Write your description as if you didn’t have a picture. Use words to
draw a mental image of your item. That way, your prospective buyer will
know what the item looks like if the photo server fails and the image
doesn’t show up. (“Electric guitar” just doesn’t say much if what you’re
selling is a “near-mint Fender Stratocaster, American Deluxe Series,
maple neck, abalone inlays, Transparent Crimson finish, gold hardware,
in original plush-lined hardshell case.”)
Remember these pearls of wisdom next time you write up a listing.

Chapter 2
Getting a Quick Start with the 
Sell Your Item Page
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Sell Your Item form 
 Carefully filling in the blanks
 Knowing what all the options mean
E
very item listed on eBay has been set up on the eBay Sell Your Item (SYI)
form (or something very similar sent through a third party provider).
However you approach selling an item on eBay, you always have to make the
same decisions, fill in the same blanks, and check the same boxes — kind of.
There are variations. So, in this chapter, we take you step-by-step through the
Sell Your Item page — the page you fill out to get your sales going on eBay.
We explain all the facets of this page, offer some advice that can increase
your odds of making money, and provide pointers on the best way to position
your item so buyers see it and bid on it.
Remember that eBay’s technocoders are constantly changing things (we all
have to justify our paychecks, you know), so perhaps the next time you go to
sell an item on eBay, the form may look a tad bit different. But never mind
this minor inconvenience. The basic questions and decisions will stay the
same.
Understanding the Sell Your Item Area
After you’ve decided you’re ready to list your item, the first order of business
is to sit down and settle on your title and description copy. With this well-
thought-out text in hand, it’s time to face the eBay Sell Your Item form. To
find eBay’s SYI page from the eBay Home page, click the Sell link on the navi-
gation bar at the top of the page, and you’re whisked there immediately.
Every eBay page has a navigation bar at the top, so click the word Sell, as
shown in Figure 2-1.

Now comes decision time. You’re going to have to nail down a slew of details
about how to list your item. Believe it or not, each of these small choices can
have a strong effect on whether your sale is a success. So, pay attention.
Decision #1: Choosing a 
category (or two)
Your first decision is what category you want your item to appear in. 
Figure 2-2 shows you the category-selection page where you find several
useful tools:
 Recently Used Categories link. Clicking this link takes you to another
page, as shown in Figure 2-3, to select a category from among those
you’ve already used for listing items on eBay.
 Browse Category Directory selector. Click this link to get to a Java-
based selection page, as shown in Figure 2-4. When you click Continue at
the bottom of the page, you’re transferred to yet another page where
you can drill down into the sub, sub-sub and sub-sub-sub categories to
list your item (even if it’s a submarine).
 Keyword Finder box. Type the specific name of your item in this box
(see Figure 2-2), and you’re presented with a list of the categories that
have items to match your keywords.
We prefer to run a complete item search with our keywords so we can
see which categories are likely to gross the highest dollar amounts for
our items.

your

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

After you select your category, you have the option to list your item in a
second category. The caveat here: You’re charged double your listing fee if
you list in two categories.

Chapter 2: Getting a Quick Start with the Sell Your Item Page

Here’s how to use eBay’s Enhanced (filmstrip-style) category selector:
1. Select a main category by clicking it.
The appropriate subcategories appear in the next square.
2. Select the most appropriate subcategory.
More subcategories appear in the next square.
3. Continue selecting subcategories until you have narrowed down your
item listing as much as possible.
You know you’ve come to the last available subcategory when you don’t
see any more arrows on the category list.
Most bidders scan for specific items in subcategories. For example, if you’re
selling a Swaroski crystal pin, don’t just list it under Jewelry; keep narrowing
down your choices (fortunately, eBay makes that easy: Just keep clicking
until you hit the end of the line).
Selecting your category can make or break your listing. For more about savvy
category selection and other eBay techniques, check out any of Marsha
Collier’s eBay books in the For Dummies series. And if you’re looking to start
an online business, there’s also a book for that: Starting an eBay Business For
Dummies, 2nd Edition.
Decision #2: Choosing a listing type
Another important decision is what type of listing you want to post on eBay.
As with the dizzying menu at your favorite restaurant, there are three ways to
sell an item on eBay (flip over to the first figure in Chapter 1 for a quick visual
refresher). There is a fourth way — selling real estate — but we’re dealing
with consumer items here. Four ways to list may not seem too dizzying
(unless you’re trying to psychically decide just which format will be the best
for you).
Here are the pros and cons of each type:
 Online Auction. This is the original, traditional sale format on eBay.
This is what those eager new shoppers look for when they come to the
eBay site in search of bargains. Remember that this option is flexible;
you can combine an auction listing with a Buy-It-Now option for those
who want to purchase the item immediately. The Buy-It-Now option will
give the prospective buyer the opportunity to buy the item at the price
you post.
Experience has taught us that when we’re selling a collectible item, let-
ting it go to auction often nets a much higher final selling price.
28
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

 Fixed Price. Fixed-price sales make shopping on eBay as easy as going
to the local mall. It’s an easy transaction for the buyer to complete. The
only problem is that many prospective buyers get confused when they
see this option. (“This is eBay — where’s the auction?”) Also, they may
prefer an auction because of the innocent perception that they may get a
better deal automatically.
 Store Inventory. After you’ve opened your eBay Store, here’s where you
click to list an item in the store. It’s a convenient place to sell items
related to your auctions or your fixed-price sales.
For this stroll through the Sell Your Item form, we want to list an old-fashioned
eBay auction. We might be willing to sell the item for a fixed price, but we’re
also willing to let the item go to auction. After you’ve put a check mark next
to that option, you’re off to the races.
Filling in the Blanks — Carefully
Now is the time to get exacting with your listing. In Chapter 1, we discuss the
pros and cons and the pluses and minuses of your listing’s title, optional sub-
title, and description. Figure 2-5 shows you where to begin in the main part of
the Sell Your Item form.
eBay is constantly working on perfecting the layout of these forms, and when
you look at the SYI page, it may be set up a bit differently than the page
depicted in this book. But regardless of the look, please recognize that you
still have to make all these decisions and fill in the blanks about your item
listing.
If you have an eBay Store, the first thing you do is customize in which store
categories you want your new item to appear. You may select 2 of your possi-
ble 20 custom listing categories from two drop-down menus. Here’s a chance
to get creative — why not list your items in more than one category? And
remember to check out Chapter 5 for instructions on setting up links to your
store on your listings.
Now, if you haven’t set up photo hosting elsewhere, you can list one picture
with eBay’s Picture Service for free; additional pictures will cost you 15 cents
each. Alternatively, you can put all the pictures you want in your auction’s
description — for free. (Chapter 15 gives you the lowdown on how to use
eBay’s Picture Services, list images in your description, and make the most of
third-party photo-hosting services.)
29
Chapter 2: Getting a Quick Start with the Sell Your Item Page

Deciding on your Item Specifics
Every eBay category gives you the opportunity to list Item Specifics (shown 
in Figure 2-6), even if those specifics are as simple as the Item Condition
selection — that is, choosing whether the item is New or Used. Most cat-
egories have a more elaborate setup — and the more complex the item, the
more it needs those extra details (for example, Item Specifics for the Apple
Laptop category tend to be more complicated than those for, say, Jeans).
These specifics are used during an eBay search. Many eBay search pages
show a product finder (at the left of the screen) that helps the shopper
narrow down their choices.
Different categories offer specifics for their unique products. For example:
 Women’s Jeans Finder: Style, Size Type (as in Misses, Juniors,
Maternity, and so on), Size, and Condition. Take a look at how these
filled-in specifics appear in the description shown in Figure 2-6.
 Men’s Shoe Finder: U.S. Size, Type, and Condition.
 Golf Club Finder: Club Type, Brand, Model, Condition, Shaft Material,
Dexterity, and Gender.
 Wristwatches Finder: Gender, Brand, Condition, and Age.
Get the picture? Be prepared to know the answers about your item and fill in
these specifics. You don’t want to loose a sale because you forgot to indicate
that your item was new.

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

Writing up the description
Chapter 1 lays out the basics of item description; here’s where we get down
to the basics of putting the description into the eBay system. If you don’t
want to monkey around with HTML (not just yet, anyway), you can use the
Standard way of inputting your text — which is (blessedly) much like using a
word processor. Figure 2-7 shows you the standard input area for creating
your description.
For those not familiar with the boxes, bars and menus, we list them here
(from left to right):
 Font Name: This is a drop-down menu that will change the type face of
the text on your screen. Merely highly your text to select the text you
want to change, and then use your cursor to select the typeface of your
choice from the drop-down menu. You have choices of Arial, Courier,
Times, and Verdana.
The Verdana font was designed exclusively for legibility on computer
screens.

Chapter 2: Getting a Quick Start with the Sell Your Item Page

 Size: Here’s another drop-down menu that allows you to select the size
of your type. The numbers in the drop-down menu indicate the types
point size. The higher the number, the larger the text.
 Color: Want some fiery red text? Here’s your chance! You can change
your highlighted text to Black, Blue, Brown, Red, or Green.
 B: Stands for Boldface. Clicking the B changes your type from regular
text to bold.
 I: I is for italic. You want to slant the text in part of a sentence for effect?
Just highlight your text and click here.
 Flush Left: When you want your text to align to the left, just highlight it
and click the simulated left-aligned text.
 Centered Text: Sometimes text looks best centered (especially when
your picture is a horizontally-based rectangle). Highlighting the text and
clicking here centers your text perfectly.
 Flush Right: Sometimes the most effective look aligns your text to the
right side of the page. Just click here and voilà!
 Numbered List: Highlight a group of paragraphs and click here for a
nicely ordered, numbered list.
 Bulleted List: We use this one a great deal for listing an item’s features.
Highlight (just as in the numbered list) and eBay’s magic will produce a
cleanly ordered, bulleted list like this one.
 Move Right: This pushbutton command moves the entire selected para-
graph of text to the right.
 Move Left: Surprise! Clicking here will move your block of text to the left.
 Inserts: Here’s a drop-down menu that helps you insert certain pre-
assigned links into your text — or, for that matter, create a link. Figure 2-8
shows the range of choices on this drop-down menu.
After you create a link using eBay’s system, you can choose to save it to
use again.
 Spell Checker: Hallelujah! Finally we’ll be able to check the spelling in
our listing before going live. What we can’t understand is why we still see
plenty of misspellings in eBay listings. Be sure to use this feature — and
check your work carefully! (A word to the wise: Try reading it out loud to
catch some of the embarrassing typos that spell checkers can miss.)
 Help: The question-mark button permits you to access eBay’s help menu
for this form.
32
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

After you’ve input all of your description, you still have to go step-by-step
through the form, indicating some very important essentials: 
1. Pricing and duration: Here’s where the hard part starts again: Think like
a marketer! Can you give the prospective buyer the option of making a
low, low opening bid? (No guts, no glory.) Or do you want to play it safe
with a middle-of-the-road opening bid? (Okay, that’s my usual approach.)
Whatever your strategy, list your opening price here. If you want to
place a reserve or a Buy-It-Now price — well, now’s your chance. 
To list an item with Buy It Now, you must have a feedback of ten or be ID
Verified.
There’s also a drop-down menu where you select the number of days
you want your listing to run. You can choose anywhere from one to ten
days.
2. Start Time: If you’d rather not schedule your listing just now, put it off
till the future. You can schedule a future time for the listing to start;
here’s where you kick in the extra 10¢ fee to do it.
If insomnia has you up in front of the computer listing your auctions at
0-dark-thirty, don’t let your auctions close in the middle of the night —
say, at 2:30 a.m.? Unless you’re prominent in the community of vampires
and werewolves, there aren’t enough bidders around to cause any last-
minute bidding wars that would bump up the price. Of course, if you’re
hoping to get bids from the other side of the globe (which also means
the other side of the clock), that’s a different story.

Chapter 2: Getting a Quick Start with the Sell Your Item Page

3. Charity Auction: If you want to donate a portion (or all) of the money
from your listing to a charity, select one from your pre-registered list
here. To register to sell for a charity, visit the eBay GivingWorks hub
page at www.ebay.com/givingworks.
4. Quantity: Unless you’re planning to sell multiple items, the number of
items is always 1 — which means you’re holding a traditional auction. If
you need to change the quantity number from 1 to something bigger, just
type the number in the box. In this case, the number of items you’re offer-
ing is always 1. (Of course, you could run a Dutch auction or a multiple-
item fixed-price listing — in which case, the quantity would be more
than 1.) You may also indicate a single “lot” of multiple items; say a “lot”
of 5 dolls.
5. Item Location: The region, city, and country from which the item will be
shipped (this is a required field). The usual eBay default is to put your
registered ZIP code and hometown in this field automatically. If you want
to list a larger metropolitan area along with your ZIP code, you can. Just
click the Change link and you can change from the suburb of Encino to
the metropolitan area of Los Angeles.
6. Listing Designer: If you’d like to contribute ten cents to eBay’s coffers to
use one of their pre-designed graphic listing frames, here’s where you
can make your donation. (On the other hand, we show you how to make
your own listing templates in Chapter 8.) Also, you can always drop by
our Web site (at www.coolebaytools.com) for a few free ones that you
can download.
7. eBay’s Options Gallery: Here’s where you get to use all those fancy
options that we talked about in Chapter 1. Make your selections care-
fully and be sure the money you spend has a good chance of coming
back to you in higher bids.
8. Page Counters: If you want to avail yourself of Andale.com’s free page-
view counters, indicate that here.
Using Andale’s counters requires registration on the Andale service.
9. Payment Methods: Here’s the place you the information on what pay-
ment methods you will accept. If you want your buyer to pay with a
PayPal, mention that here. This information appears at the top of your
sale page when the sale is completed, at the bottom of the auction while
it’s active, and in the End of Auction e-mail.
10. Ship-to-Locations: Here’s where you can indicate exactly where you’re
willing and able to ship an item. If you don’t want the hassle of shipping
out of the United States, just check the box that denies this option. You
can individually select different countries, as well. (Sorry, no different
planets. At least not yet.)
34
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

11. Shipping and Sales Tax: Indicate whether you’re charging flat rate for
your shipping (as in Figure 2-9), calculated or calculated freight (for
items over 150 pounds).
There’s also a place for you to input the sales-tax percentage that you
may (or may not, depending on your state) have to charge for purchases
within your own state. eBay keeps this figure in the SYI form as a default
until you decide to change it.
12. Returns Policy: If you accept returns, you can outline your policy here.
Unfortunately, eBay has no way for you to indicate that you do not take
returns, but if that’s the case, just type that message in the refund policy
box and hope people read it.
13. Payment Instructions: If you want to put in a little speil about how fast
you ship — or (ahem) that you don’t take returns — you can do that
here. If you want buyers to pay with a different payment service, men-
tion that as well. This information will appear at the top of your sale
when the sale is completed, at the bottom of the auction while it’s
active, and in the End of Auction e-mail.
14. Buyer Requirements: This is a little-known-but-hugely-important option
for sellers. eBay lets you take the “no shoes, no shirt, no service” philos-
ophy all the way from the ’60s into the new century. If there are some
folks you don’t want to sell to, here’s where you may (within eBay stan-
dards) say so.
When you indicate the folks you’d rather not do business with, it’s good
practice to be businesslike and specific about it. Figure 2-10 (for exam-
ple) shows my choices for bidder blocking.

When you’ve filled out all the blanks on the Sell Your Item page, you are

can review your work before listing. This is the place where you can catch
embarrassing mistakes and take them out before your item is listed. The

lies up how much eBay is charging you (in fees and options) to run this auc-
tion. You also get to see how your action description and pictures will look

Knowing How HTML Works
In This Chapter
 Making sense of confusing HTML-related acronyms 
 Checking out the Web neighborhood
 Examining the parts of an HTML command
 Using easy HTML formatting
A
lthough the title of this chapter might make you think it has more tech-
nical information than you will ever need to know, its purpose is to
demystify the “geek-ness” of HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Starting
with HTML (and all of its confusing permutations), through CSS (Cascading
Style Sheets), and even the term WWW (World Wide Web) itself, the language
of the Internet is a myriad of acronyms and abbreviations. 
But behind all those seemingly unpronounceable words are relatively simple
meanings. By the time you finish reading this chapter, you’ll not only know
what each of these terms mean, but you’ll also know which ones are impor-
tant for you to understand and learn to use. Understanding how HTML works
is like learning to play a musical instrument, programming the time on your
VCR, or becoming a marathon runner: Take it one step at a time, and break it
down into manageable portions.
Getting to Know HTML and the Web
The terms Internet and World Wide Web (Net and Web for short) are often
used interchangeably, but technically, the Internet is composed of the World
Wide Web and many other functions. Here’s a short list of the more com-
monly used Internet features: 
 E-mail: Electronic mail is by far the most popular Internet application.
 Real-time “chat” programs: Advanced far beyond the early days where
only text was used for conversations on the Internet, a plethora of pro-
grams allows conversations between two (or many more) users.

 Telephony: Using the Internet to make phone calls has been around for
a while, but recent advances in hardware and software that use VoIP
(Voice over Internet Protocol) make this one of the fastest-growing
Internet applications.
 File transfers: Huge amounts of data are transferred on a continual basic
through the Internet, independent of information transferred via Web
site links.
The term “World Wide Web” brings to mind, of course, a spider web. Now is
the time to envision a spider web, with all of its intricate intersecting threads.
No matter where you start on the web, you can reach another point by fol-
lowing a path made up of individual strands. The World Wide Web works the
same way; no matter which page you start on, you can reach virtually any
other page by following links, which are the intersections of the individual
strands. These intersections can all be on the same computer, or they can be
on many different computers, anywhere in the world, as long as they are con-
nected to the Internet.
Hypertext
Before the Web became popular, the primary source of information for most
of us was a shelf full of reference books such as dictionaries and encyclope-
dias. Most entries in these references were full of cross-references to other
entries for more information. Researching a subject could become an exer-
cise in futility, flipping back and forth in volume after volume, chasing these
cross-references. The Web has allowed users worldwide to create the ulti-
mate encyclopedia, with more information and more cross-references, but a
much easier way of accessing them.
There’s an amazing amount of information available in the wink of an eye 
on the Web. But remember to take any information you find with a grain of
salt — because bad information can be retrieved just as quickly as good
information. Quantity and speed isn’t always a guarantee of quality, and
“what you see” on the WWW isn’t always “what you want to get.” Anyone can
say anything they want — and they do! — and as my momma always told me,
just because someone says it, doesn’t mean it’s true.
Even more important in the “what you see isn’t what you want to get” line of
thinking is this: The incidence of spoof sites is growing exponentially. Spoof
sites are Web sites whose main goal is tricking you to freely give up your per-
sonal financial information and set yourself up as a target for identity theft.
Always make sure that you know where you are in the cyber universe when
entering sensitive information. And never, ever click on a link in an e-mail that
looks like it came from eBay, PayPal, or any other organization. Go directly to
the Web site in question and sign in to check on the status of your account.

Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

HTML — the language of the World Wide Web — is what makes all those
cross-references work as easily as the click of a mouse. The “HT” in HTML
stands for hypertext, a set of computer instructions that acts like glue to stick
together the individual strands of the Web, creating intersections so you can
navigate from one point on the Web to another. A hypertext link is a portion of
information, usually one or more words, that serves as both a snippet of text
and an active control; it’s linked to another portion of information — on the
same page, the same computer, or another computer somewhere on the
Internet — and when you click the link, you go there.
Markup
The “ML” in HTML stands for markup language — essentially codes or
instructions included in a file of text that indicate how that text should be
displayed by an Internet browser. These codes are invisible when the file is
ultimately displayed, but they are essential to making the screen show more
than just a steady stream of characters. Imagine what trying to read this page
would be like if there were no paragraph breaks, no headings, or no cute little
icons to draw your attention to something important!
Markup languages are used not only for pages on the Web, but also in virtu-
ally any program that handles text (whether it’s e-mail or a word processor)
to make the text readable when displayed, as well as easy to print. Often —
as with the interface between your e-mail program and your printer — your
computer provides the markup language automatically. Understandably, the
commands to display a document on your computer screen are completely
different than those required to print those same words on a piece of paper.
Chapter 19 introduces some programs you can use to automate the markup
language for you — but you might as well know what it is you’re automating,
so for the moment, hang in there. After you get a handle on how these lan-
guages work behind the scenes, you can boss them around more easily.
Browsers
Most of us have a preference for one browser over another; it’s similar to 
our preference for a particular model of car. A car will get us to and from the
grocery store, no matter who made it. There are differences in options, of
course — automatic or a manual transmission, MP3 or CD player (or, for retro
fans, a cassette tape player). Obviously you can’t work the clutch if your car
has an automatic transmission, or play your CDs on that cassette player.
Same deal with Web browsers: They all work similarly, but some commands
work in one browser, but not in the other. We’ll point out some of those com-
mands as we go along.
39
Chapter 3: Knowing How HTML Works

For example, the marquee command, which provides a scrolling message
when viewed using the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, displays only
nonmoving text when viewed with early versions of the Netscape browser.
Conversely, the blink command works only in the Netscape browser
(although, in our quest to reduce irritating distractions, we don’t recommend
using that command in either case).
Okay, back to the automotive analogy. Carmakers bring out a new version of
each model at least once a year; browser manufacturers do the same.
Sometimes these new car models are introduced with great fanfare to tout
major new changes. Other years, only minor changes occur. Similarly, Web
browsers are updated at varying levels on a regular basis.
At this point, it’s worth noting that a Web browser is simply another com-
puter program used to navigate the Web — and computer programs keep
coming out in new versions, normally designated by a number, a decimal
point, and another number. If you see version 7.1 (for example), the first digit
denotes a major version; the second digit indicates only a minor change.
Some browser-savvy Web sites tell you, right up front, which browser (in
which version) will display them best. A typical notice might read, “Best
viewed with Internet Explorer version 6.0 and later.”
As of this writing, the most popular browser is Internet Explorer; throughout
2005, Firefox emerged to take a firm hold on second place.
It’s a good idea to have the top two or three browsers available on your 
computer — after all, you don’t know which one an average visitor to your
site may be using. When you’re testing out new HTML commands you should
be sure to view your listing description using each browser, to make sure the
effect of your careful HTML coding is displayed as planned for the majority of
your customers.
Some of your customers might not always upgrade their Web browsers to the
latest version when it becomes available, especially if the new version
includes major changes. If you decide to try out a fancy new HTML feature,
keep in mind that some of your customers might be using an antiquated ver-
sion of a browser that can’t translate a command it doesn’t know about. For
this reason, avoid using those newer features in order to keep your listing
from displaying improperly. For instance, both the frame attribute of the
table command and the legend command (which you can use to draw bor-
ders around text) don’t work in older browsers.
Web servers
A Web server is a program that runs on a computer connected to the Internet.
Think of the Web server as a restaurant which provides delivery service, and
users on the Web are patrons, or “clients” of the restaurant. The Web server
40
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

is a very specialized program that answers an order submitted by a client
computer for a page to be displayed, or “served.” This order can be a direct
request for a portion of text, HTML, an image, or a sound file (to name a few)
or it can be triggered by the user clicking on a hyperlink. See Chapter 5 for a
detailed explanation of the construction of hyperlink HTML commands.
Deconstructing an HTML Tag
The anatomy of an HTML command isn’t nearly as complex as it may appear
at first glance. Here’s the general parts-is-parts breakdown for an HTML 
command:
 An opening character: This is the trigger to the Web browser (which
will be interpreting the command), telling it not to display the charac-
ters that follow, but to act on them.
 The actual command: This text string defines what to do when the
browser displays the page — and how to make it look the way you
intend.
 Optional attributes: These non-displayed text strings define, in more
detail, how the command is to be executed. (Fuss, fuss, fuss.)
 A closing character: This is the signal to the Web browser that the com-
mand is complete.
Most HTML commands are used as paired tags; one command signals the
start of a change in the way that text is to be displayed, and another com-
mand signals the end of that change. If the ending command is omitted, the
change in display is never turned off, which may provide an interesting,
unwanted effect.
You can use a pair of simple HTML tags to center text on a Web page: The start-
ing command <center> signals the place where the centering is to begin, fol-
lowed by the word (or words) to be centered. This formatting ends with the
ending command </center>, which signals where the centering is to end.
 Opening character: <
 Command: center or /center
 Closing character: >
A more complex pair of commands changes the font size and color of the
text: The starting command <font size=”4” color=”green”> signals
the place where the font change is to begin, followed by the word (or words)
to be displayed in the different size and color. Those are followed by the
ending command </font> — which signals the place where the change is to
end — here’s the rundown:
41
Chapter 3: Knowing How HTML Works

 Opening character: <
 Command: font or /font
 Optional attributes: size=”4” and color=”green”
 Closing character: >
Most ending commands are identical to the associated starting command but
are immediately preceded by the / character.
Cascading Styles Sheets (CSS)
The latest innovation in markup language for the Web is Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS). No, this isn’t the latest fashion in intricately flowing bedcover-
ings; CSS provides you the ability to more precisely define how you want a
page to be displayed. This extra control may be necessary because specific
Web browsers can easily override (or ignore) basic HTML commands.
A major benefit of using CSS is that you can define once (at the top of the
page) the elements that are normally optional attributes for individual com-
mands (such as body, hr, or ul). If you decide later to make a global change
to the look of your page, you will need to change only one portion of the page
(the top).
With Basic HTML, you would need to edit each occurrence of the command
and its attributes. Even better, CSS enables you to create a separate file with
the definition of the entire “style” of a page. You then refer to that same style
from multiple pages. If you decide to make a major change to the look of your
pages, you need to edit only the file that contains the overall style definitions,
rather than every page that refers to the file.
You need to upload (to the Internet) the file containing your CSS style format
information — just as you would upload an image you want to embed in your
listing description. (See Chapter 15 for the scoop on how to get this upload-
ing done.) As with any other critical data, make sure that you have a backup
copy of the file containing your CSS style information. Anytime you make a
change, make a copy of the file and edit the copy for testing your new format-
ting. We recommend you keep the last several versions of your style-file —
just in case!
Okay, it’s true — a simple change to a CSS external style-definition file can
distribute the change to multiple pages that refer to the file. But that conve-
nience comes with an associated danger: If the external file is damaged, or a
change is made incorrectly, the error also gets distributed to all pages that
refer to it. So what if the CSS style-file gets corrupted or you make a change
42
Part I: Getting Chummy with the Basics 

incorrectly? After you scream in despair and before you start pulling out your
hair, remember that you’ve followed the best practices from the preceding
tip. That is, you edited only the copy of your CSS style-file, and you also kept
the last several versions of this file. So the solution to your corrupted file or
incorrect change is a simple file substitution!
Cascading Style Sheets are a relatively new method for defining how content
displays on the Web. Up to now, each browser implements CSS a bit differ-
ently to suit its own features. For this reason, be sure to test your pages in
the most popular browsers to make sure they display your pages correctly.

site www.coolebaytools.com that will help you get started!
Sure and Simple Formatting Tricks
One of the simplest tricks that can make things easy when you’re adding
HTML commands to your text is to put each command on a separate line.
When a Web browser interprets a page that includes HTML commands, it
ignores which lines they’re on, and doesn’t bother to display any extra blank
lines or spaces. That means you can write your HTML so it makes the best
possible sense to you (what a concept!) and still have it work. The following
code, for example, will be interpreted and displayed as shown in Figure 3-1:
<font size=”+1”>
It doesn’t matter whether your text is 
all 
on 
one 
line, or if you have  some     extra     spaces or 
blank lines 
in your text, it will all be formatted 
properly when the HTML commands are interpreted 
and displayed by a web browser.
</font>
<p>
To make it easier on yourself, put each opening and
closing HTML tag on a 
<strong>
separate
</strong>
line.
</p>
43
Chapter 3: Knowing How HTML Works

Want to save your sanity — and maybe keep from pulling your hair out later
when you discover that the formatting doesn’t end where you thought it did?
Always enter the closing tag when you enter the opening tag, and just put
your text between ’em. That way you avoid forgetting to close the tag later.
Uh-oh. We just said that extra blank spaces won’t be displayed. What if you
want more than one space at a time — that is, how do you create an area of
“white space” in your description? Don’t panic; there is a special HTML com-
mand that accomplishes this feat: the non-breaking space. To get one, just
insert &nbsp; in your text for each space you want to include: &nbsp;&
nbsp;& nbsp;& nbsp;& nbsp; will force the display of five blank spaces
in a row.
The non-breaking space comes in handy in several other ways. For instance,
if you have two or more words that should stay together, no matter what, the
&nbsp; can make it happen. Here are some examples of how to use this com-
mand to keep words from being separated:
Los Angeles, CA - Los&nbsp;Angeles,&nbsp;CA
September 4, 1995 - September&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1995
4:00 PM - 4:00&nbsp;PM
Though some browsers recognize and interpret the non-breaking space com-
mand without the semicolon (;) character at the end, not all browsers do. Be
sure to include that semicolon; otherwise the actual characters &nbsp will be
displayed instead of any space at all, making your text messy.
The non-breaking space command stands alone; no need for angle brackets
or a corresponding closing tag.

his is it. Part II is just what you need — especially if
you want to work a little on-screen magic from behind
the scenes. We’re constantly hearing from people who
want to do just that — by learning the ways of HTML
coding. Figuring out the best way to format your listings
can be a challenge at first, but this part helps you bypass
any confusion. We make the most essential HTML easy —
spelling out its syntax in simple terms, offering advice 
on the structures that give you attractive, repeatable
results — and impart just enough HTML know-how to
make your listings stand out from the crowd.

T
hough some eBay pundits would argue that the text description in your
listing isn’t the most important part, we beg to differ. The words you use
to describe the item you have for sale (along with essential information such
as terms and conditions of purchase) are what could make or break the suc-
cess of your sale.
Think of your listing description as a barren plot with nothing showing
but tilled soil. With just a little work and the magic of HTML code, you can
transform your listing into an inviting, beautiful garden — or an eye-jarring,
overwhelming jungle (if you’re not careful)!
Just as a garden benefits from a planned layout and choice flora, your list-
ing’s verbal description benefits from the structure of HTML coding that’s
selectively applied. In this chapter, we show you how to change the color,
size, shape, and look of the words in your description. Also, because one
long, unbroken block of text is difficult to read, we show you how to break up
your description into smaller, attention-getting pieces by using paragraph
breaks, bullets, and centering. We finish up with how to create a template
that can give all your listings a uniform look and feel — a real marketing plus.

Making Text Clear but Catchy 
with HTML
When you get your first look at a page of text that includes HTML tags, you
might be a tad overwhelmed — you’re not alone — but we’ll be taking it
one tag at a time. Each of them is a building block that you can add to your
listing description as you become comfortable with it. You probably won’t
use all the commands we describe in this book, but careful use of the ones
that give you the look you want is a piece of cake — if you take it one layer
at a time. 
Formatting builds strong listings
HTML functions mainly to modify the appearance and the placement of text
in your listing. The appearance of the text can be modified by changing its
size, color, or typeface. The placement of the text can be changed by center-
ing sections of text, creating neatly ordered lists, or breaking up large blocks
of text — either with white space or with an actual drawn line.
Only what you need to know 
about coding HTML
As we explain in the previous chapter, an HTML tag is simply a signal to the
browser to display text in a particular way from a specific starting point to a
specific ending point. In almost all cases, HTML tags come in pairs — one to
mark the beginning and the other to mark the end of the change made to the
displayed text.
HTML tags always start with the < character and always end with the > char-
acter. In between these two characters are an HTML command and, optionally,
some attributes that focus the formatting change.
In the remainder of this chapter, we go over the HTML commands that
give you the biggest bang for the buck. For each one, we provide an expla-
nation of how it works, and how it can be (or not be) used effectively.
The example commands we provide help make clear how the commands
are written.
48
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Getting Bolder (Or Larger, or 
More Colorful) as You Go
Text by itself can be rather blah and not very expressive. You can spruce up
your listing by indicating (via HTML) that you’d like to see your text dis-
played more creatively. For example, consider using HTML to specify a font
(a particular typeface and size) to boost the fun factor of your listing text.
You don’t want your listing to look run-of-the-mill, and a good way to make
your words stand out from other listings is to change the font in which they
appear on the Web page.
Using different fonts can be fun — but as with all other text enhancements,
too much can be, well, too much. Be careful to not blast your reader with a
page full of unrelated fonts that are difficult to read! In general, you rarely
need more than two fonts to get the job done.
Picking fun (but readable) type
You can choose from two categories of typefaces to use for the text in your list-
ing description: those with serifs and those without. Typefaces without serif
are called sans-serif or gothic. (Serif, by the way, means that the typeface has
those small, fine lines that finish the ends of each letter and carry your eye
to the next letter.) The serif typeface was developed with its smooth-flowing
upper- and lowercase letters to make printed text easy to follow. A standard
serif font often used in books is Times New Roman.
A commonly used sans-serif typeface is Arial. In sans-serif type, the letters
don’t have the fine lines that finish the letters, so the letters end abruptly at
the bottom or top. In general, sans-serif letters are easier to read from far
away than serif letters, so it’s pretty commonplace to see road signs done in
sans-serif fonts and book text done in serif fonts. See Figure 4-1 for examples
of these two categories of typefaces.
Figure 4-1:
Serif and
sans-serif
typefaces.
49
Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

Fancy fonts are fun for printing out, but it’s a different ballgame online.
Be sure to select standard typefaces that are available on all computers.
Otherwise your potential customers’ computers may display completely 
different (and perhaps highly unreadable) type when they view your listing.
(Check out the sidebar “Your computer can become a font of fonts” to
find out more about what happens with nonstandard typefaces.) Refer to
Table 4-1 for ideas on choosing a standard typeface and deciding how you
might want to use it.

50
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 
Your computer can become a font of fonts
Each operating system contains a set of stan-
dard fonts (typefaces and sizes) that are
installed on the computer when it’s brand new.
Then, as people install different programs on
their computers — especially word-processing
or desktop-publishing programs — additional
fancy fonts are added.
What can happen then looks like this: You browse
through all the fancy fonts you have available on
your computer, and pick out one that’s easy to
read and has just the right oomph for your listing!
After all, the point is to enhance your description,
not make it difficult to read. Use HTML code to
insert the font to be used in your description,
and then happily submit your listing. So far, so
good! But you then discover, when looking at
your listing on someone else’s computer, that
what you see is not the font you picked at all. It’s
a completely different one! What gives? 
Actually the problem has to do with the other
computer. Either the precise font you selected
isn’t available on that computer, or its browser
settings don’t allow a change of font. So all your
fancy fontwork has gone for naught!

As with most HTML commands, font is one that must be turned off (or closed)
when you’re done with it. Simply place the following command where you
want the special typeface to end (and take special note of the / character):
</font>
font is one of the HTML commands that can have options (called attributes),
and face=”typeface name” is one of those options. You can define all the
attributes together in one command, as we show you in the following sec-
tions. But you can also use separate commands — one font command to
define the face, one to define the size, and yet another to set the color.
Just don’t forget that if you define these attributes independently, you have
to turn off each one independently!
For the main body of your listing, select a font (typeface and size) that’s easy
to read and readily available on all computers. Use only one or two additional
fonts for emphasis. Enlarged titles and separate text blocks with instructions
for international customers are good examples of areas where changing fonts
can be effective.
By and large, resist the urge to use a different font for each paragraph (it
screams “newbie!”) — and don’t use fancy, obscure fonts that are difficult to
read or unavailable on all computers (they may be better for flyers than for
Web pages). Check out Figure 4-2 for a look at some commonly used fonts
that show up well on-screen.
Figure 4-2:

Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

Trying out different sizes
HTML sets up a type-size standard for all Web pages. On the HTML scale
(ranging 1–7), the standard size for text displayed in eBay listings is 2. But as
you notice in this book, or in the newspaper you read with your coffee this
morning, different font sizes make pages more interesting to read and help
set apart different groups of text. You can (and should!) do the same thing
with your listing. At the very least, headings that appear in a different size
help distinguish the different types of information you want your customers
to see. For example, you may need headings to point out your item descrip-
tion, terms of purchase, shipping information, and so on.
You can use several different commands to tell HTML to change your text size:
 <big> tag: Use this tag when you want the enclosed text to appear one
increment larger than the standard text.
<big>The BIG command makes your text larger by one
size.</big>
 <small> tag: Use this tag when you want the enclosed text to appear
one increment smaller than the standard text.
<small>The SMALL command makes your text smaller by
one size.</small>
 size attribute: Use this attribute with the <font> tag when you want to
increase the size of the enclosed text or specify a particular size on the
HTML scale.
<font size=”+1”>Makes your text larger by one size (if
the number is a 3, the text will be 3 sizes
larger).</font>
<font size=”-1”>Makes your text smaller by one size
(if the number is a 2, the text will be 2
sizes smaller).</font>
<font size=”4”>Makes the text a specific size of
4.</font>
To combine the font tag’s size attribute with another optional attribute
(such as the face attribute used in the previous section), try the following
command:
<font face=”Arial” size=”4”>
This command changes the typeface to Arial and makes it size 4 at the
same time. And if you combined these two attributes into one command,
you now need only one command to turn off the text formatting:
</font>
52
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Figure 4-3 shows how the combined command can affect the type in a listing.
Use a larger font to emphasize titles and section headings within your
description, but keep the following guidelines in mind:
 Don’t use a font so huge that the text is wider than your potential cus-
tomers’ screens can handle. You don’t want to make them scroll left and
right just to read your text.
 Don’t use a font so small that the viewers have to put their noses right
on the screen to read it. Some folks would rather go away than squint.
Showing your text in different colors
First, decide what colors you’re going to include on your page. Just as with
a garden, you don’t want to go wild and use all the colors available to you!
A multitude of contrasting colors won’t be easy to read, just as a garden with
many different colors would be difficult to look at for very long. A few subtle
colors that work together well, used with care, can make your point without
being overbearing.
Figure 4-3:
Changing
and sizing
the type in

53
Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

Say you’ve picked out an easy-to-read typeface and decided on the proper
size. Now you get to decide what color(s) you want your text to be! Remember
your excitement when you got a brand-new box of 64 crayons? (Whoa — look
at all the colors to pick from!) Hang on to your hat, because now you have
216 standard colors in your box! There are actually 256 standard on-screen
colors, but only 216 are designated as Web-safe (available on all computers)
because Microsoft and Apple reserved the other 40 colors for use in their
own operating systems. Even though your computer is probably capable 
of displaying millions of colors, 216 should be more than enough for eBay
purposes.
In Chapter 8, we talk about using color in the background and for other
design purposes, but right now we’re talking about changing the colors of
your text. Following are some guidelines for using color in your listing text:
 Decide on a limited set of colors to include in your listing. And then,
stick to your decision! Just as you don’t infuse your garden with plants
in every color of the rainbow, you don’t want to go wild by using all
216 colors available to you! Using a multitude of different colors won’t
make your listing easy to read (quite the opposite), but carefully pulling
in a few colors that work together well can help make your point without
making your readers’ eyes burn.
 While choosing colors for your text, keep in mind whether you plan to
change the background color. You don’t want the background and text
colors to clash with each other! Text will fade into a background color
that’s too similar, but too strong a contrast can bring a viewer to tears.
 Recognize that some potential customers may be colorblind or have
other difficulties with viewing specific colors. Yellow is one color that
many people can’t read easily. Readability is the watchword here!
Once again, HTML comes to your rescue and makes changing your text color
an easy task. Although all 216 colors have designations in HTML, 16 colors
have standard names — which you can specify to select a particular color:
aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red,
silver, teal, white, and yellow. The rest of the 216 available colors are designated
by unique hexadecimal numbers (each using the numeric digits 0 through 9
and including letters A through F).
You can find a handy chart of colors on Marsha’s Web site at coolebaytools.
com/html_hex_colors.html. This chart shows each color around the
number used to select it. To change your font color to bright lime green
(okay, maybe not the most appropriate for readable text, but allow us a
funky example), you can use either of the following commands:
<font color=”lime”>
or
54
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

<font color=”#00FF00”>
As with all other font commands, don’t forget to turn off your color change
by using the </font> command.
Use color changes carefully and only for emphasis. Make sure that the colors
don’t clash, are easy to read, and are limited to no more than two. Don’t use a
white or light-colored text because you’re planning to have a dark background
color or image. If your reader’s browser can’t display the background you’ve
chosen, your white text will appear on a default white background — impossible
to read (think polar-bear-in-a-snowstorm).
There are three different ways of looking at the colors on a color wheel.
Analogous colors sit next to each other, like blue, blue-green, and green.
Complementary colors are opposite each other on the wheel — think red and
green, or blue and orange. Color triads can be made by superimposing an
equal sided triangle on the wheel, and taking the three colors at the points
of the triangle (red/yellow/blue or purple/green/orange). Analogous colors
should be used for the major color scheme of your listings. Complementary
colors and color triads can be used for accents, but should be used very
sparingly.
Drawing attention with bold and italics
You may notice, as you read this book that we use bold or italics to make cer-
tain words or phrases stand out when we have something important to bring
to your attention. Consider doing the same thing in your listings. As with the
enhancements we talk about in prior sections, remember that such treatments
lose their effectiveness when used too often. Think of your HTML commands
as the spices that you add when cooking — you don’t want to be heavy-handed
with the salt (or the italics)!
HTML gives you two ways to define text to be bolded, and both are com-
mands made up of paired tags. The following snippet shows both ways:
To make a word or phrase bold, you can use either the
<b>bold</b> or <strong>strong</strong>
commands.
You also have two ways to define text as italicized, and both also must use
paired tags. Check out the following:
To make a word or phrase italicized, you can use either
the <i>italics</i> or <em>emphasis</em>
commands.
55
Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

For several reasons, the strong and em tags should be used in lieu of the
bold and italics tags. After all, bold and italics are only formatting
commands; the strong and em tags actually define the content. When ana-
lyzing pages, search-engine programs give more weight to content designated
with these two commands. Browsers that “speak” (screen readers) will inter-
pret strong and em tags more appropriately, giving the listener speech
closer to someone talking.
Use bold and italics to make single words, phrases, or short sentences stand
out from the remainder of the text. But don’t make an entire paragraph or
item description bold; this treatment simply has the same visual effect as
putting the paragraph in a different font, and the emphasis gets lost.
. . . etc.
After you change typeface and text size, enhance your text with color, and
format with bold and italics, what’s left? HTML offers tags for many other text
enhancements — but most are either not available in all browsers (such as
flashing text and scrolling marquees) or they’re not appropriate for use in
text descriptions.
We want a word with you about underlining. As with bold and italics, under-
lining is a way of emphasizing text to make it stand out from surrounding
text. We don’t recommend using the HTML underline tag when creating list-
ing descriptions for a good reason. That is, most links (which we discuss in
Chapter 5) are automatically underlined. If you underline some of your text,
many customers will think that text is a link, and you’ll have them click-click-
clicking without any result. Then when you include a link later on — maybe
one that takes them to your eBay Store — they may not click it because the last
“link” they tried didn’t work. It’s like the boy who cried “Wolf!” — if your cus-
tomers don’t believe you, you can’t expect them to buy what you’re offering.
Grouping and Positioning 
Your Listing Text
A second major group of HTML tags can help you spice up your listing text.
These tags help you group and position your text to direct the reader’s eye,
distinguish related information, and draw attention to important points.
Let’s face it: One large block of text is just a bunch of words — and if there
are no breaks in the page, your customer will give up trying to pick out the
56
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

description from the shipping terms. By simply grouping each relevant por-
tion of your description into paragraphs and lists, with headings in appropri-
ate places, you put the right information in the right place.
Centering sometimes fits the bill
You may want to center a small part of your text. The <center> tag, like
most others, requires a paired closing tag to complete it. If you neglect to
include the closing tag, all the remaining text on-screen will be centered.
The following command centers the enclosed text on-screen:
<center>This command will center the text between the left
and right sides of the screen.</center>
Don’t succumb to the temptation to center all your text! Although this treatment
might look all right on your screen, remember that not all your customers’
displays will be set to the same resolution as yours — and they may find your
text hard to read. You can often achieve a nice appearance for your listing by
centering headings, images, or individual items that you specifically want to
stand out. We say again, lest anybody forget — a little goes a long way when
enhancing your text.
Center titles, images, or special instructions. But don’t center large blocks of
text. Doing so makes the left and right edges of the text vary widely, and the
listing becomes much more difficult for your customer to read.
Breaking up large text blocks
Okay, suppose you’ve written a standout item description that answers every
possible question your potential buyers could have about the item you’re
selling — and what they should expect for completing the transaction.
Congratulations — you’re halfway there. Presenting all this information will
require putting a lot of text on-screen — and one large, dense paragraph can
be difficult to read. Fortunately, HTML gives you several commands that can
break up your text into bite-size groups. Breaking up the text not only makes
your listing easier to read, but it also helps your potential customers go back
after reading it and find specific details to review if they have questions.
To ensure that your HTML can be read by the newest versions of all browsers,
review the format of the commands given in the next section. They might be
a little different from the way you learned them; as given here, they’re based
on the most recent definition of HTML.
57
Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

All three HTML commands that we recommend for breaking up large groups
of text are single tags — they don’t require closing tags. (But we also note that
you should close the one that can be closed — and why you should do so!)
The following bullet list gives you the breaking news (so to speak) on these
tags used for structuring your description:
 <br />: This is the Break command that inserts a line break and puts
any following text on the next line without an intervening blank line.
This command is useful when you’re making a list that you don’t want
emphasized with bullet points or numbers. It looks like this:
<br />This text will begin on a new line.
 <p> and </p>: This is the Paragraph command that inserts a line break
and makes any following text appear on the next line, after inserting a
blank line first. This command is useful for separating paragraphs of
text (d’oh!) to make them easier to read. When used without attributes,
this tag doesn’t require a paired closing tag to go with it. Even so, it’s
still a very good idea to get in the habit of closing all your tag pairs.
The </p> tag is only four keystrokes; go ahead and close it! Here’s what
that looks like:
<p>This text will start on a new line, with a blank
line just above it.</p>
 <hr />: This is the Horizontal Rule command — useful for separating
vastly different sections of text by drawing a line horizontally across the
screen. For example, you can use <hr /> to separate the description of
your item from your payment and shipping policies — both sections are
important to the reader, but are vastly different in content. A horizontal
rule, used in conjunction with other text enhancements (such as a cen-
tered header in bold or italic type), can help you effectively distinguish
these sections of your description.
Like the Break and Paragraph commands, the Horizontal Rule command
doesn’t require a paired closing tag. But it does have several optional
attributes you can specify when using it. One such attribute (which you
may use often) is the width option, which defines the span of the line
across the display. If you omit the width option, the horizontal line is
drawn all the way from left to right side across the viewer’s screen.
You may also want to use the align attribute in conjunction with
width. Using align, you can specify whether the less-than-full-length
line displays centered, or to the left or right side of the screen. Here it is:
<hr width=”50%” align=”center” />
Break up large groups of text with the Paragraph command to make your text
easier to read. Use the Horizontal Rule command to separate different sec-
tions of your description. We don’t, however, recommend using the color
attribute as an option with the Horizontal Rule command; not all browsers
58
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

can display this option. Also, don’t use the width attribute without specifying
the percentage (%) to show that you’re defining the line width as a percentage
of the screen width, rather than a specific length of pixels (those little dots
that make up lines and text on the reader’s screen).
Both the br and the hr commands are single tags and must be used inside
two other paired tags such as <p> and </p>. They also have the closing /
inside the brackets, placed at the end (not the beginning) and preceded by
a space.
Emphasizing with bullets
No, we’re not talking about ammunition! (You can’t sell that on eBay anyway.)
Bullets, or bullet points, are those little dots (or sometimes numbers) that
often appear to the left of text that’s arranged in a list. The bullets help the
reader’s eye separate the list items.
Making bulleted lists is a little more difficult than using other HTML com-
mands, if only because it requires two different sets of paired tags. The first
set of tags marks the beginning and ending of the entire list. The second set
separates items in the list by marking the beginning and ending of each one.
(And after you get all these commands in order, you can make sublists inside
your lists — but always remember to keep the tags paired!) Here’s a bulleted
list of things to remember about lists:
 Numbered lists — another way to itemize details in your listing — are
called ordered lists in HTML. And the tags that start and end these lists
are <ol> and </ol>, respectively. 
 Lists that aren’t numbered (just bulleted) are called unordered lists.
You got it: The starting and ending tags are <ul> and </ul>.
 The command that designates each List Item (for either Ordered Lists or
Unordered Lists) starts with <li> and ends with </li>. The following
HTML commands create a numbered list to show the tracks on a CD:
<ol>CD Title
<li>Track 1</li>
<li>Track 2</li>
<li>Track 3</li>
<li>Track 4</li>
<li>Track 5</li>
</li>
Use bullets if you have a list of items that you want to emphasize. Use a
numbered list if the order of the items is important (such as book chap-
ters or CD tracks). But please, don’t use bullets just because you can.

Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

Setting Up Your Own Auction Template
When you enter a store that is part of a chain, did you ever notice that the
store is laid out similarly to other stores in the chain? Retailers do that to
make the surroundings familiar so customers feel comfortable the minute
they enter the store. They know right where to find what they’re looking for:
in the back-left corner (for instance), they’ll find dairy products, and in the
right-front corner will be the fresh produce.
Any chain store worth its salt doesn’t want its customers overwhelmed and
confused when they walk in the door. Consistency encourages a feeling of
familiarity, so customers can easily locate the sections of the store. Time
wasted looking up and down every aisle to locate a specific department is
time that isn’t spent determining which items to purchase.
With all the text enhancements available to you through HTML, you can
design a listing layout that’s easy to read, provides all the information your
customers need, and feels consistent with your other listings. You can care-
fully group and delineate information so your shoppers can easily locate the
information they need to make a decision to purchase your item. As you’re
designing the look of your listings, keep in mind all the different types of
items you sell; format the layout so you can use it for most — if not all — of
your products.
Experiment with HTML formatting and put together the best layout you can;
then save this layout as a template, or a pattern, to use when you create your
listings. Creating an HTML template benefits you in two ways:
 You don’t have to rewrite standard sections of text (such as payment
terms and shipping schedules) that are common to each of your listings.
 The visual consistency creates a “brand” for each of your listings.
Returning customers — or customers who look at several of your items
to take advantage of combined shipping for multiple purchases — will
feel right at home looking at your listings. They’ll know where on the
page to find the information they need, won’t have to scan the entire
page to find a specific detail — and just might end up in more of a mood
to buy what they’re looking at.
When saving your template, use the most elementary text-editing program
you have available. Complex word-processing programs insert additional
commands (similar to HTML commands, but specific to that program) —
which can cause problems when you try to reuse the template to create
other listing descriptions. The Microsoft Notepad program (a classic text
editor included with Windows) works well for eBay purposes; it doesn’t
insert additional commands and it preserves the HTML commands you
used to format the easy-to-read layout you designed.
60
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Follow these steps (on a computer running Windows XP) to create and save a
handy, reusable listing template:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad, or open your
simple text editing program of choice.
2. Start with a blank page, at the top of which you type your listing
header.
3. Include the HTML for at least one picture.
4. Finish with your standard payment and shipping sections.
You might want to review this chapter while you’re at it.
5. Choose File➪Save As to save your completed template.
The Save As dialog box appears.
6. In the Save In drop-down list, choose a location where your template
is readily available for use when creating your listing descriptions;
type a logical name for your template in the File Name text box.
7. Click Save to save your template.
Figure 4-4 shows a template we created with a blank area to be filled in with
the differentiating information for each item.

61
Chapter 4: HTML Text — Formatting Basics

Work up a description layout that you’re comfortable with, and make a tem-
plate of it to use for all your listings. But don’t be so rigid about it that you
feel pressured to use your standard template in every single listing. If the
design doesn’t fit a specific item, then it just doesn’t fit! You wouldn’t try to
squeeze into a pair of pants that don’t fit any more (would you?), and you
shouldn’t try to force every listing you create into a one-size-fits-all template.
Remember, however, that you can still use that lovely (and consistent!) color
scheme you came up with, as well as those fonts you so tastefully selected, to
preserve the familiar look and feel that makes your customer feel welcome.

Playing the (Hyper) Links
In This Chapter
 Directing customers to the right location 
 Linking to your eBay Store — and saving money
 Opening new windows
 Making big pictures from little ones
A
lthough you might never step foot (with or without cleats) on a putting
green, learning how to play the links is essential when designing your
listing description. Links are the HT (the hypertext) in HTML, and you click
links to make something happen. Usually this action displays a different Web
page. Or clicking a link can move you to a different location on the same Web
page. You can also use a link to open an e-mail message and automatically fill
in the send-to e-mail address (and other information, if you’d like).
A link can appear on-screen as text or as an image; you can tell you’ve found
one when your cursor changes to a hand with a pointing finger. Recognizing
text links on a Web page is easy! These links are most often automatically
underlined and displayed in bright blue text.
The code to generate a link may look more complicated than other HTML
commands, but it works essentially the same way. The command starts off
with an opening tag; then you find the hyperlink text (or the HTML coding for
an image), followed by the closing tag. Chapter 3 shows you the basic HTML
command syntax, and this chapter shows how the basics work for adding
links to your listing.
You also find out about the attributes, or options, available to enhance your
linking commands. Although most commands have attributes, not all attributes
are useful when writing listing descriptions. So in this chapter, we discuss only
those attributes that we find especially handy.
As with most other HTML commands, a linking command must end with a
closing tag. If you don’t set the end where you want it, your link will extend
to the end of the page!

Teeing Off with Simple Links
The most common link is one that displays a new Web page when a cus-
tomer clicks it — and for good reason: Why would you want to take your 
customer away from your listing description? The point of linking is not to
take customers off to online limbo-land, but rather to direct them toward
shopping aids or opportunities — including other valuable information,
goods in your eBay Store, or a list showing some (or all) of the items you
have for sale.
You can even link to your own Web site, as long as that link is on your About
Me page. Don’t make the mistake of putting a link to your off-eBay Web site
in your listing description; this is against the eBay Links policy (read it at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-links.html),
and if the link is reported to eBay, your listing will be ended prematurely.
Here’s how to use HTML to construct the most common links:
 To link to another Web page, find out the address, or URL (Uniform
Resource Locator) of the page. After you’ve got the address, create an
href (Hyperlink REFerence) command by including the anchor href tag
(with URL), the hyperlink text (which identifies the link), and the closing
tag. Here’s an example.
<a href=”http://www.yourisp.com”>Hyperlink text</a>
 To jump directly to a specific location on the current page, place a
required matching name tag at the location on the page you’re jumping
to. The name tag is formatted as follows:
<a name=”location_name”></a>
The actual name you give the location is unimportant, but it must exactly
match its reference in the anchor href tag. Although you may wonder
why this command needs a closing tag, don’t leave it out; logical or not,
you have to include it!
After you define the place to jump to, creating the link that jumps you
there is as simple as referring to that same location_name in a standard
anchor href tag. If the name tag is at the top of the listing description
(for example), the following HTML will jump directly there so your cus-
tomer doesn’t need to scroll all the way back to read it again:
<a href=”#location_name”>Return to top of
description</a>
The location_name you use must exactly match the associated name
tag, and you must include the # character, but only in the href tag.
64
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

We don’t recommend putting links near the top of your listing description if
clicking that link could allow your customer to skip past important informa-
tion without reading it! An appropriate position for these location links is at
the bottom of your description, allowing your customers to return easily to
areas they would like to review.
Linking to your eBay Store
You might want to include a direct link to your eBay Store at several places
within your listing. After customers discover an item you have for sale (due
to your outstanding marketing techniques, of course), directing them to your
eBay Store gives your customers a look at your entire array of merchandise
for their shopping pleasure! eBay automatically provides several direct links
to your eBay Store, but you should also provide your own; this is one place
where more is better!
Savvy sellers offer shipping discounts to customers who purchase more than
one item at a time; in these days of rising energy costs, who isn’t looking for a
way to reduce expenses? Be sure to emphasize multiple-purchase shipping
discounts in each of your listing descriptions — and give each one a link to
your eBay Store to make it easier for your potential buyer to find more items
to purchase; that convenience might clinch the deal! Marsha creates a link to
her eBay Store (“Marsha Collier’s Fabulous Finds”) as shown here:
<a href=”http://stores.ebay.com/Marsha-Collier’s-Fabulous-
Finds”>Visit my eBay Store for low prices on
handy seller tools and Cloud Dome Products</a>
You can also provide a link to your eBay Store from your own Web site; it’s
easy, and it might save you money on your eBay fees! As of this writing, if
a customer arrives at your eBay Store from an external site by clicking a 
specially coded link — and then makes a purchase — eBay will reduce the
Final Value Fee (commission) that the seller pays for that sale by 75 percent!
That should be enough of an incentive to learn the simple HTML command to
direct your Web site visitors to your eBay Store.
You can create this money-saving link just like the preceding direct link, but
be sure to add the referral code ?refid=store to the URL. That way eBay
knows the link that sent the customers to your eBay Store came from you.
Here’s what that looks like in practice:
<a ref=”http://stores.ebay.com/yourstorename?refid=store”>
Visit my eBay Store for more fabulous buys</a>

Chapter 5: Playing the (Hyper) Links

Linking to specific items or categories 
in your eBay Store
If your eBay Store is chock-full of wonderful stuff, you might want to link to
only one specific item or category of items. The more merchandise you have
in your store, the more important these directional links are. After all, in the
brick-and-mortar world, the larger the department store, the more store
directories there are to keep shoppers from feeling overwhelmed and leaving
in frustration.
Creating directional links — to either a single item or a category — is easy
and works much the same in either case. Just do the following:
 To link a listing to a single store item, simply view the item in your eBay
Store where you can see its unique item number. This number is part of
the URL that points to the single item. Copy the URL from the location
bar in your Web browser and paste it into the href tag. Your linking
command should look something like this one:
<a href=”http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?
ViewItem&item=7551201712”>eBay For Dummies</a>
URLs can have parameters, and most aren’t necessary for linking
directly to a single eBay item. Parameters in URLs begin with either a ?
(question mark) or & (ampersand) character, and the only parameter
required for linking to a single item is &item=999999999. You can
delete anything in the URL that follows this parameter.
 To link a listing to a specific store category, go to your eBay Store and
select the appropriate category. The URL displayed is the one that you
use in the anchor command’s href attribute, which should look some-
thing like this:
<a href=”http://stores.ebay.com/yourstorename_
W0QQdptZ0QQsclZallQQtZkm”>Need seller’s tools?
Find them in my eBay Store.</a>
Linking to other listed items
If you don’t have an eBay Store, you can link to a single item (or only a subset
of items) you have for sale. Doing this provides the same benefit as linking
directly to a store category: You avoid overwhelming your customer with too
much information at one time. Less confusion makes for easier sales!
To display some (or all) of your listed items, first you need to determine the
URL which will show only those items you want displayed. Follow these steps:
66
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

1. Go to eBay and access any of your item listings.
2. Click the link labeled View seller’s other items (List view) to view all
items you currently have available for sale on eBay.
• If you want to display all of your items, this is the URL to include in
the linking href attribute.
• If you don’t want to display all your items, you need to perform a
search to narrow down the results from the full list.
3. To display a subset of your items, type the appropriate search word(s)
in the Search box at the top of the list (just under the All Items tab)
and then click Search.
Under Search Options at the left, make sure that the check box next to
Items from seller remains checked, and that your eBay user ID is the one
displayed, as shown in Figure 5-1.
4. When you winnow down the search results to exactly the items you
want displayed, copy the URL from the location bar of your browser,
and paste it into the href command.
The resulting HTML linking command looks something like this:
<a href=”http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?
sofocus=bs&sbrftog=1&from=R10&catref=C6&
satitle=%22eBay+For+Dummies%22&sacat=-1%26

Chapter 5: Playing the (Hyper) Links

Linking to related Web sites
You may sometimes have more information about an item you’re selling than
you want to include in your description. For example, if including the extra
info slows down the loading of the page, better trim down that description.
The longer a page takes to load, the greater the chance that your customer
will get tired of waiting and leave to find something else to purchase.
If you run into the too-long-listing situation, you can put the additional informa-
tion on another Web page and link to this page from your listing description.
Extra listing information can include expanded item specifications, additional
detailed images, or a broader description of your payment-and-shipping terms
and conditions.
After you create the page containing the additional information, simply refer
to its URL address in a simple href link like this:
<a href=”http://www.yourisp.com/photos.html”>View
additional pictures!</a>
Providing an e-mail link
You might want to let your potential buyer know how to contact you directly
via e-mail in case they have any questions. You can do this by simply including
your e-mail address as part of your listing description. Or you can give buyers
a better, easier way to send you an e-mail by using an HTML command that
opens their e-mail client programs and fills in your e-mail address automati-
cally. You can even get a little fancier and have the program fill in the subject
line so they don’t have to!
Don’t rely solely on the mailto: command described in this section because
it won’t always work — this is one of those commands that depends on a set-
ting in your customers’ browsers. If they haven’t told their browsers which
e-mail program they’re using (or the browser doesn’t recognize their e-mail
program), this command won’t work! So make sure your e-mail address is vis-
ible in your listing — or that you give your customers another way to contact
you, just in case!
To open an e-mail message automatically, you start with the anchor tag
and the href attribute — but instead of linking to a Web page, filename, or
location marker, you include a special command and your e-mail address,
as follows:
68
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

1. Type <a href= to begin the link for opening an e-mail message.
2. Type mailto: and then your e-mail address, all in quotation marks.
The HTML line you start looks something like this:
<a href=”mailto:seller@yourisp.com”
This command has several attributes available, but the only one we find
convenient is the one that designates the subject line of the e-mail.
3. To define the subject line, type ?subject=Your Desired Subject
Line immediately following your e-mail address, and inside the quo-
tation marks.
4. Type the closing tag > to finish the link.
Usually the text in between the anchor tag and the closing tag (that is,
the text that becomes the hyperlink) is your email address, but you can
also display a message such as Got Questions? as the hyperlink.
5. Type the </a> tag to close the anchor command.
Here’s how a command looks when it includes both a subject line and
hyperlink text:
<a href=”mailto:seller@yourisp.com?subject=I’ve got a
question!”>
Got questions?</a>
If you decide to specify a subject line for the e-mail link, remember that the
sender can change this line. So don’t count on using the words you provide
to filter these e-mails when they arrive in your mailbox!
If you want to get even fancier with your linking, you can use a picture of a
mailbox, a stylish question mark, or some other image in place of the hyper-
link text. Want to know how? Read the next section!
Making a Hole-in-One: 
Linking to an Image
Sometimes it makes more sense to use an image instead of text for your hyper-
link. For example, if you have a logo for your eBay Store (silly comment — of
course you do!), use it as the link to your store. The bigger the target, the
easier it is to click!
You display an image in your links with the help of the img (Image) tag and
several attributes, which we describe in Table 5-1.

attribute doesn’t work in all browsers,
so don’t put any important information
here! If the image won’t load, this text
is what is displayed in its place.
The img command is then surrounded by the href (Hypertext REFerence)
command, and voilà! You have an image that’s also a link!
When you make an image that’s a link, your customers’ cursors change when
passing over the image, indicating that they can click there — but don’t
assume they’ll see that! Be sure to include in your text that the image is 
clickable — say it more than once if necessary.
The following code displays a set of images, each of which takes your cus-
tomer to a different category of your eBay Store. Figure 5-2 shows you how
effective this linking technique can be.

You’ve got lots of other wonderful items available for sale, and you want to
let your customers know what they are! Putting a list of those items in your
description would make you guilty of keyword spamming — a definite no-no
on eBay! There is a way — just make images of the words describe the other
goodies you have. Display those images, making each one a hyperlink to the
appropriate category in your eBay Store, or have each one launch a specific
search of a subset of your listings, as shown in Figure 5-2. Using this approach,
you can provide this essential information to your customers without break-
ing any rules!

The Nineteenth Hole: Using 
Silly Linking Tricks
Actually, the linking tricks we tell you about aren’t all silly, but be careful
when using them. If a link you’re using doesn’t do what a link normally does,
it only makes sense to warn your potential buyer of the different behavior
before it happens. If clicking a link will open a new window (and there are
times when this is a good thing), provide a note that this will happen, and
include a cordial reminder that your customer will need to close the new
window to return to your listing. Clarity is always a good idea online.
Opening a new browser window
Sometimes you want to provide your customers with additional information
that’s hanging around on another Web page, but you don’t want to take them
away from your listing description. The easiest way to do this trick is to have
the new Web page open in its own full-sized browser window. Nearly nothing
to it: Just add the attribute target=”_blank” to the anchor tag.
The target attribute isn’t necessary for the e-mail link, which automatically
opens a new message window in your e-mail program.
The following command opens a page containing additional pictures in a new
browser window (you might want to include the instructions to close the
window to return to the listing description on the page of pictures):
<a href=”http://www.yourisp.com/pictures.html”
target=”_blank”>Click here for additional
images (close the new window to return to this
page)!</a>
Connecting thumbnails and larger images
If you have multiple detailed pictures of your merchandise and don’t want to
load them all in your listing, you can create small versions (called thumbnails)
of your images and make them into links to larger images. That way, your cus-
tomers only have to wait for the detailed images to load if they really want
to view them. Chapter 7 gives you the skinny on how to create a thumbnail
image from a larger one.
72
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

The two images need to have different names, but to makes things easy on
yourself, give the images similar names. If the full-size image name is widget.jpg,
make the name of the thumbnail image widget-tn.jpg to help you remember
which is which.
After you have the two images (the full-size version and the thumbnail), linking
between the two is as simple as linking from an image as described in the sec-
tion “Making a Hole-in-One: Linking to an Image” earlier in this chapter. The
only difference is that instead of the hyperlink leading to another Web page,
it links directly to the location of the larger image. The following command
shows how to link your images:
<a href=”http://www.yourisp.com/image.jpg” width=”400”
height=300” border=”0”><img src=”http://
www.yourisp.com/thumbnail.jpg” width=”40”
height=30” border=”0” /></a>
Don’t forget to explain in the text that clicking the thumbnail images will dis-
play larger, more detailed pictures. Your customers don’t know to click the
thumbnails if you don’t tell them — and why let all your intricate commands
go to waste! Including a note that the browser Back button gets back to the
item page is also a good idea.
Rollovers and other fancy tricks
You can find many other linking tricks to use — such as having the font color
change when the cursor goes over it — but some people find such features
either distracting or confusing. Remember, you want to keep your listings
simple and easy to read. Any time your customer spends figuring out how a
link works is time not used to make a purchase!

In This Chapter
 Figuring out JavaScript advantages
 Finding JavaScript scripts you can use
 Counting down to a special date
JavaScript commands are powerful, but don’t be overwhelmed by the
thought of adding them to your listings. As with Cascading Style Sheets
and HTML, JavaScript commands change the way a page is displayed on the
Internet. JavaScript can be a little more complicated, but with the informa-
tion in this chapter — and yeah, okay, a bit of work — you can include some
JavaScript in your listings and reap the rewards. For example, you can make
your listings more informative, easier to view, and a snap to navigate. Call it
pampering the customer.
In this chapter, you find out how to add helpful JavaScript routines to give
your listing viewers special messages that change as the auction progresses.
We also show you how to use JavaScript to keep your images safe from capture,
and to locate — and insert in your listings — scripts that are ready-to-use
(and free, too). We think it’s just as important to let you know what you can’t
do as well as what you can, so we’ll outline the JavaScript no-no’s for eBay
listings.

Knowing What You Can Do 
with JavaScript
JavaScript, which was originally developed by the Netscape company, is simply
an extension of HTML. Where HTML allows you to change the look of a page and
the way text and images are displayed on a page, JavaScript gives you even
more control over the information that your page displays. With JavaScript,
you can direct the browser to perform one of a set of actions based on criteria
that can be different each time the page is viewed, such as the displaying a
message based on the current date and time — we’ve included a countdown
timer at the end of this chapter that you can use to do just that! A few items
you can accomplish with JavaScript include
 Displaying different text or images based on the current date or other
criterion (such as the browser that’s used to view the listing).
 Changing the appearance or the actual content of text or images based
on the position of the mouse on the page. For example, you can have a
different caption display underneath an image based on which portion
of the picture the mouse cursor hovers over.
 Displaying a message box based on a left- or right- click of the mouse.
Later in the chapter (in the section “Disabling right-click functions”), we
show you a sample script that disables the common options displayed
when a user right-clicks on a Web page.
Don’t confuse JavaScript with Java. Java is an actual computer programming
language that has very powerful features, but requires a separate program (a
Java compiler) to work on a Web page. Specifically, the programmer creates a
file of commands, and this compiler converts the Java commands into a sort
of mini-application (called an applet), which is then saved in another location
to be included as part of the Web page when it is accessed. Most of us never
need to learn how to write code in the Java language, thank goodness!
Finding Ready-to-Use Scripts
The great community that makes up the Internet gives you access to free
graphics, animated images, backgrounds, and a myriad of other things you
can use to spruce up your listings. Not surprisingly, you can find many Web
sites offering JavaScripts that you can use for free. In most cases, the authors
ask only that you be sure to retain the script comment lines, notes tucked in-
between lines of code that give them credit for writing the script.
76
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Searching for scripts online
To find these freebies, point your Web browser to your favorite search
engine, search for free JavaScript, and prepare to be inundated with a multi-
tude of Web sites to choose from. On these sites, you’ll find free scripts that
perform a wide variety of functions, such as
 Telling time via JavaScript clocks, calendars, and timers.
 Scrolling single- or multi-line messages as if they were on a stock
market ticker display.
 Dressing up a page with special effects, such as randomly changing
colors, for your status bar, backgrounds, or on-screen text.
 Adding interest and movement with image slideshows and galleries.
 Playing up on-screen activity, such as highlighting a link on mouse-over
or adding a mouse cursor effect that changes an image that the user sees
when the mouse cursor passes over it.
Figure 6-1 shows the results of incorporating a script that uses an image map
and the location of the mouse cursor to change the caption displayed under-
neath the image.

77
Chapter 6: Brewing JavaScripts (Not the Starbucks’ Kind)

The more movement, animation, and special effects you add to your listings,
the slower the page will load. All these fancy features can also be distracting —
and can slow down the entire computer, so use them judiciously, and only if
the value they provide outweighs the potential side effects.
Copying free scripts for your own use
After you find a script that you want to use, follow the instructions at the free
JavaScript site to get the script onto your computer (so that you can actually
use it). Getting the script’s code may be as simple as copying and pasting from
the Web site, or you may need to download a file to your computer using the
instructions that are available on the site. After you have the script you want
to use saved as a file on your computer, the next step is to incorporate it into
your listing.
You usually place scripts within your listings by opening the file on your 
computer where the script was saved, copying it, and then pasting it in your
listing description. For scripts that don’t display a specific image or text, the
script can be pasted at the very top of the description. If the purpose of the
script is to display an image or text, it should be placed in the exact location
where you want the image or text. As with HTML commands, the JavaScript
commands themselves don’t display on your pages — just the results of the
commands.
JavaScript, like HTML, behaves differently in different browsers. Be sure to
view the results of any script you use in your listings. Try it out in the most
popular browsers to ensure that the resulting display looks the way you
designed it — and that it works.
Some of the flashy tricks you can do with JavaScript — like mouse cursor
trails — can annoy your customers. As with everything else we discuss in
this book, remember that fancier isn’t always better!
Making Sure Your JavaScript 
Is Allowed in Listings
Certain JavaScript (or HTML) commands are potentially malicious to the end
user — there are bad guys out there who would just love to make your com-
puter do things for them automatically — so eBay doesn’t allow the use of
such commands on its site. These forbidden fruits include commands that
78
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

 Drop or read a cookie on any eBay page, including item listing pages.
 Redirect the users from eBay to a page on another site. For example,
scripts such as the replace script that send a user to another auction
site would, understandably, be prohibited.
 Automatically call remote scripts and pages, such as JavaScript
includes or iframes, which could be used to emulate an eBay
page for nefarious reasons, such as collecting personal information.
 Change Windows Registry entries, or otherwise write to another’s com-
puter hard drive. Commands like these could introduce major system
problems for your customers, innocently or not!
 Create automatic pop-ups, or separate windows that appear unexpect-
edly and obscure the window that the user is actually trying to see.
An exception to the no-pop-up rule is the type of link that opens in a
new window when clicked — and gives the user a way to close it.
 Automatically load any binary program on another computer. eBay
makes an exception for Flash content — the only reasons we can come
up with to load a program on customers’ computers wouldn’t be for
their benefit.
 Automatically overwrite any area on the listing outside of the item
description area. eBay doesn’t want you to inadvertently (or purposely!)
cover up any content it generates; eBay considers all information it pro-
vides to be important to your customer.

Handy Scripts for Any Listing
We often include scripts in our listings; disabling the right mouse-click is one
and a countdown clock is another. You can add either of these scripts, or
others that you find online, to your listing by copying the script and then
pasting it at the top of your listing description.
Both of the scripts that we commonly use — and other helpful scripts we’ve
run across — are available to download from Marsha’s Web site at 
www.coolebaytools.com/javascripts
79
Chapter 6: Brewing JavaScripts (Not the Starbucks’ Kind)

Disabling right-click functions
One of the first tricks new Internet users discover is that depressing the right
button on their mouse when viewing a Web page allows them to quickly and
easily pop up a list of commands. And it doesn’t take them long to figure out
that right-clicking an image gives them an option they can select to save that
image to their computer. With a short JavaScript incorporated into your listing,
you can disable customers’ access to the functions that pop up when they
right-click your listing. The idea here is to prevent the less-than-scrupulous
from making off with your image and using it for their own purposes (say, to
sell some other similar item).
When placed right at the beginning of your listing description, the following
script will keep viewers from using the right-click menu to save your product
images for their own use. Figure 6-2 shows the pop-up message that readers
see in place of the menu.
<script language=”JavaScript”>
<!--
var message=”Sorry, that function is

}
//if IE4+
document.onselectstart=new Function (“return false”)
//if NS6
if (window.sidebar){

You can customize the message that appears for your listing viewers by
replacing the following message variable with your own text:
“Sorry, that function is disabled.<br><br>Contents &

be taken from this site.”

81
Chapter 6: Brewing JavaScripts (Not the Starbucks’ Kind)

After all, Marsha’s message isn’t in the public domain, either. (Friendly
reminder.)
Disabling the capability for a customer to use right-click functions will not
harm their computers — or necessarily keep an experienced user from cap-
turing an image. This JavaScript function just makes the capture a little more
difficult, and serves as (yep) a friendly reminder.
Although customers might right-click a listing page to capture an image, that
isn’t always the only reason. They might want to print a page, go back to a
previous page, add a page to their favorites, and so on. So keep in mind that
receiving a pop-up message — instead of the expected behavior — might
frustrate some customers enough to keep them from continuing to browse
your listings.
Displaying a countdown message
If you want to encourage customers to make a quick buying decision by dis-
playing a countdown to a specific date, you can use a script to get that effect;
it’s just a little more complicated than the right-click disabler. Whatever the
date you choose to be your target — whether it’s a specific holiday, the end
of a sale, or a special event — this script displays an appropriate message
based on the current date when the page is viewed. Follow these steps (on a
computer running Windows XP) to add the countdown and customize it for
your listing:
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad, or open your
simple text editing program of choice.
2. At the top of a blank page, type the following script commands
(or copy and paste the script from www.coolebaytools.com/
javascripts).
<script language=”JavaScript”>
//simple countdown script
var leadupdays=” the end of our Clearance Sale! Don’t
wait -- make your purchase today!”
var ontheday=”Final Clearance Sale Day!”
var months=new
Array(“Jan”,”Feb”,”Mar”,”Apr”,”May”,”Jun”,”Jul
”,”Aug”,”Sep”,”Oct”,”Nov”,”Dec”)

Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

function countdown(yy,mm,dd){
var today=new Date()
var thisyear=today.getYear()
if (thisyear < 1000)
thisyear+=1900
var thismonth=today.getMonth()
var thisday=today.getDate()
var todaystring=months[thismonth]+” “+thisday+”,
“+thisyear
var targetstring=months[mm-1]+” “+dd+”, “+yy
var difference=(Math.round((Date.parse(targetstring)-
Date.parse(todaystring))/(24*60*60*1000))*1)
if (difference==0)
document.write(ontheday)
else if (difference>0)
document.write(“Only “+difference+” days left until
“+leadupdays)
}
//target date formatted (yyyy,mm,dd)
countdown(2006,01,31)
</script>
3. Type your changes to customize the script for your listing.
You can change the following elements in this script after pasting it in
your description:
• The leadupdays variable, which contains the end of the message
that viewers see on any date leading up to the target date. The mes-
sage you put in this variable appears after the phrase Only xx days
left until.
• The ontheday variable, which contains the message that appears
on the day you’re counting down to.
• The countdown function (in the next to last line of the script)
that defines the actual target date you’re counting down to, as
in countdown(2006,01,31). The previous line is a comment
(designated by the // at the beginning of the line) and it’s there to
remind you how to format the target date by entering the year first,
then the month, and then the day. All these are numeric and have
leading zeros where necessary.
These dates appear in this script as follows:
April 1, 2006
countdown(2006,04,01)
Christmas Day 2007
countdown(2007,12,25)
January 31, 2006
countdown(2006,01,31)
83
Chapter 6: Brewing JavaScripts (Not the Starbucks’ Kind)

Figure 6-3 shows the message (displayed in a framed table) three
days before the target date, and Figure 6-4 shows the very same
page, with no scripting changes, on the actual target date.
4. Choose File➪Save As to save your completed template.
The Save As dialog box appears.
5. In the Save In drop-down list, choose a location where your count-
down script is readily available for use when creating your listing
descriptions; type a logical name for your script in the File Name
text box.
6. Click Save to save your script.
7. To add the script to a listing description, open the file. Copy the script,
and paste it at the location in the listing description where you want
to display the message box generated by the countdown script.
The date used for the computations in the countdown script is the current
date, taken from the computer belonging to the person viewing your listing.
Obviously, if the date on that computer is incorrect, the viewer won’t see the
proper message. Placing a note above the message stating — in a jesting
manner, perhaps? — that the message is for entertainment purposes only
should avoid any misunderstandings with a customer if their computer date
isn’t set properly or they have turned off JavaScript in their browser.

In This Chapter
 Getting your pictures the right size
 Making sure to cover all the angles
 Inserting a picture in your listing
 Optimizing listing-page download speed
A
picture is worth a thousand words, or so the old saying goes. And when
we’re selling items online, it’s an important saying to keep in mind. Having
a picture — usually more than one — along with your listing description is
essential if you’re going to make sure that potential buyers know everything
they need to make the decision to purchase your merchandise.
In Chapter 4, we cover the mechanics of the HTML commands you use to actu-
ally place the images in your description. This chapter covers some concepts
you’ll need to keep in mind when getting your pictures ready for use in your
listing. We’ve been taking listing pictures for many years, and we still routinely
need to tweak our images before they’re ready to use on eBay. In this chapter,
we share what we’ve found out about making your images the optimum size
and clarity for viewing online, while keeping them small enough to download
quickly. And that means we also have to indulge in a little bit of techno-babble,
but stick with us because we do explain how to have your images show what
they need to — nothing more and nothing less.
Sizing (and Resizing) Your Pictures
Part III gives you the scoop on how to get the best pictures of your merchan-
dise. Whether you use a digital camera or a scanner, you may often find that

the picture you end up with is too big to use with your eBay listing. The image
might take up too much of your computer screen because it has too many pixels
(the dots that make up the picture). Or the image file might take up 500 K —
or more! — and take an eon to load. (We recommend that you keep the size of
your eBay image files around 50 K instead.) If you notice one of these problems,
then you probably have both. And to correct either problem (screen hogging
or file bloat), you need to resize the image.
Most digital cameras and scanners come with an image-processing program.
We encourage you to learn how to use the basic features of this program; it
has what you need for cleaning up your pictures before you use them in your
listings. The most useful functions help you crop and resize pictures that are
too big:
 Cropping is trimming off unnecessary areas around the edges of a pic-
ture. For example, if you have a picture of a lamp that you are selling,
but discover your daughter peeking in on the left side of the picture,
you’ll want to remove that little “extra” from your image before using it
in your listing. We give you step-by-step instruction on how to crop an
image in Chapter 16.
 Resizing is making a big image smaller — or vice versa — so you can
see what it is but still have room for everything else on-screen. Although
digital pictures are rarely too small, re-taking a too-tiny picture is our
usual recommendation. You probably want to resize your picture if it
is larger than 400 x 300 pixels (the recommended size for an image on
eBay). See Chapter 16 for step-by-step instructions on how to resize a
photo.
If your image-processing program has a resample function in addition to resize,
then resampling is the better choice. When the program shrinks a picture by
resizing, it simply removes pixels to bring the image down to the new size.
If the original size is 800 × 600 and the new size is 400 × 300, every other pixel
is discarded. If the same picture is resampled, however, the computer actually
analyzes the surrounding pixels and determines which pixel is the more logi-
cal one to remove. This selective process retains the closest reproduction of
the original image for a crisper, clearer result.
Every time you save a picture in JPEG format, it’s compressed all over again,
in order to make the final size of the file as small as possible without losing
much of the clarity of the image. Be careful when editing pictures that you
intend to save in this format. If you save an image multiple times, each save
takes away just a little of the sharp edges in the picture; eventually the image
quality gets sketchy and muddy.
88
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

For sharpest clarity, try this formula: When resizing or resampling your
photos, make the new size evenly divisible into the old. For example, if your
original image is 1200 pixels by 900 pixels, a good size for the resized image
would be 400 pixels by 300 pixels. This will result in exactly one in every
three pixels being kept for the new, smaller image. If you select a new size
of 500 × 375, one pixel will be kept for each 2.4 pixels in the original image,
resulting in rougher edges throughout.
Zooming in on your subject
In Chapter 13, we talk about zooming in on the subject when taking your 
pictures, but when processing your pictures, zooming takes on a whole new
meaning. Almost any image-processing program you decide to use will have
a Zoom function. When you use this handy-dandy little feature to zoom in
(for a closer look) or out (for an overall look) at your image, you have much
greater control over its details.
Keep this in mind when using your program’s Zoom function: Even though
the picture on your screen appears larger (or smaller, as the case may be),
the actual size of the image has not changed. For a true size change (say, for
an image you want to save and display later in your listing), use the resize or
resample function as noted in the previous section.
Before saving an image you’ve changed, make sure that the Zoom ratio dis-
played in the toolbar of your image-processing program shows the current
viewing ratio as 1:1. A one-to-one ratio means the image you’re viewing is the
actual size of the image that will be saved.
Maintaining your aspect ratio
When resizing your picture, you see one of the following options preceded by
a check box:
Constrain proportions
Maintain aspect ratio
Preserve ratio
These options all do the same thing. Whichever one’s on-screen, make
sure that its check box is checked (selected) before you resize your image.
Otherwise the newly resized image will be distorted in height or width 
(funhouse mirrors, anyone?).
89
Chapter 7: Embedding Images for Flash and Effect

Maintaining the aspect ratio actually makes an image easier to resize. When you
select this check box, you enter either the new height or the new width — and
the computer calculates what the other dimension should be, based on the
original height and width. If the original image is (say) 1200 × 900, you desig-
nate that the aspect ratio should be maintained, enter the new width of 400,
and let the computer figure out that the new height will be 300.
More than you ever wanted to know about
dpi, ppi, pixels, resolutions . . .
If you read avidly about digital images and printers (and who doesn’t?), you
see the terms dpi (dots per inch) and ppi (pixels per inch) bandied about.
Trade secret: These measurements actually have no effect on the size of the
images displayed on your computer screen. Instead, they’re all about how
sharply the details show up.
The dpi specification is normally used only when referring to printers; it
describes how many dots of ink (per inch) can be printed on a page. A dot is
an actual, tiny drop of ink; a pixel is the electronic equivalent — a lit-up “dot”
in an on-screen image. If you look closely at a printed image, you can usually
see the individual dots that make up a picture. Your eyes usually ignore indi-
vidual dots and smooth them together.
An image displayed on a computer screen is completely different than one
printed on a piece of paper, for more than the obvious reason. An image on a
piece of paper is the size that it is, forever and ever. An image on a computer
screen, however, can be many different sizes, based on the display settings of
the screen. A 19-inch monitor screen — like a 19-inch television — is measured
on the diagonal from corner to corner. The actual display area is approximately
15 inches wide by 12 inches high. However, the size of the screen is only one
part of how text and images are displayed. The resolution, or degree of sharp-
ness of displayed text or images, also comes into play.
The power of pixels on-screen
By tweaking the number of pixels used to create an on-screen image, you can
give the image its best possible look on the widest range of monitors. So find-
ing the highest possible resolution (that still lets the image load quickly) means
paying some attention to computer hardware. You define resolution for a 
19-inch monitor, for example, by making settings through the computer’s
operating system; these tell the monitor to display Web pages at resolutions
ranging from 640 × 480 pixels (lower) to 1280 × 1024 pixels (higher).
90
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

What these measurements mean, in essence, is how large and how clear your
image can be. At lowest resolution, an image is made up of 640 pixels (or dots)
spread from left to right across the screen, and 480 pixels from top to bottom.
The highest resolution uses 1280 pixels left to right, and 1024 top to bottom.
Okay, please stop yawning; wrestling with screen resolution is how you get
images that are right-sized for your eBay listings. Here’s why:
 The higher the resolution of an image, the sharper it is within its
patch of precious on-screen space. But all monitors are not created
equal. If you choose a resolution that’s too high, some of your cus-
tomers’ monitors will have to use too much screen space to show your
image, or won’t be able to show it at all. (More about that in a minute.)
 All those resolution numbers affect what your customer actually
sees. eBay recommends an image size of 400 × 300 (that’s pixels, of
course, not inches). On a 15 × 12-inch screen set at its lowest resolution
(640 × 480 pixels), the image would show up as 9.375 inches wide and
7.5 inches tall — and take up approximately 2/3 of the height and
width of the screen. On the same monitor set at the highest resolution
(1280 × 1024), the image would appear approximately 4.7 inches wide
and 3.5 inches tall, about 1/3 of the height and width of the screen.
That’s a big difference!
Table 7-1 shows how much of the available screen space a 400 × 300-pixel
image covers at different resolutions.

So what happens when the images you want to put on-screen are too big?
Even more of the display space is used! Table 7-2 shows what happens when
the image’s pixel size increases by 50 percent in both directions — making
the image 600 × 450 pixels.

Getting your pixels right on eBay
Many of us like to keep up with the latest technology, and so we upgrade to
at least 19-inch display screens. But we might forget that many computer
users still have 15-inch monitors — with an actual display area no more than
12 inches wide by 9 inches high. This scrunches up the area available for dis-
playing the images in your eBay listings. For example, Table 7-3 shows the
percentage of space used by that eBay-recommended image size of 400 pixels
wide by 300 pixels.
Comparing this table with Table 7-1 (for a 19-inch display) shows that
although the percentage of display space used is the same, the image is
smaller.
Table 7-3

6 × 4.5
50 × 50
1024 × 768
4.7 × 3.5
40 × 40
Very few users set their monitors’ display resolution to 640 × 480 (the lowest
available), but many use 800 × 600, so we recommend that you design and
scale your listings and images using this resolution as the baseline. This means
that all your images should be smaller than 800 × 600 (as that would fill up
the screen), and we recommend no larger than 600 × 450.

Placing Your Pictures 
for Maximum Effect
Although it isn’t the most important aspect of your description, the picture of
the item you’re selling is a big part of the first impression it makes. No sur-
prise that the position your pictures take within a description can make a
huge difference in ease of viewing the information about the item. Keep the
following in mind:
 If the item image is wider than it is tall, centering the picture above the
text describing the item is appropriate.
 If the item image is taller than it is wide, placing it on the left (or right)
side of the description text is better.
Placing your images according to these general guidelines helps to keep the
image and the description together on-screen when your customer views
your listing. See Figure 7-1 for an example of both placements.
Figure 7-1:
Proper
placement of
figures with
the descrip-
tive text.
93
Chapter 7: Embedding Images for Flash and Effect

If your image is just about as wide as it is tall, then placement of the picture
with respect to the text isn’t as crucial. You just want to avoid forcing your
customer to scroll up and down too much to view both image and text.
Always use the one-free-picture option that stores an image with your item
listing on eBay. This image can be the same one you embed in your description,
or a different image. This way, if eBay is having problems displaying pictures
stored on its server, odds are that your own picture-hosting service won’t be
having the same problems at the same time (and vice versa). Thus an image
of the item you’re selling is always available.
Embedding the Image in Your Listing
eBay gives you the option to add pictures to your listings, but if you have a
place to host your own images (Chapter 15 tells you how to find an image
host), you can embed one or more images directly in your listing — without
paying any additional fees!
An image can be embedded anywhere within your listing with the help of the
img (Image) HTML tag. This particular tag is one that stands alone — that is,
it has no need for a closing tag. The / just before the ending > (shown in the
follow HTML command) is a signal that the tag closes itself.
<img src=”http://www.yourisp.com/yourimage.jpg” />
Selling Up with Multiple Pictures
Selling items online is, without a doubt, much different from selling the same
merchandise in a brick-and-mortar storefront. One major difference is that
your customer can’t pick up the item to view it more closely, or to look at the
bottom or inside. But here’s the next best thing: to offer potential buyers a
look at multiple pictures of your item.
Take a main picture that shows the entire item, but also take pictures of the
back, sides, top, and bottom. Close-up photos can also be important. Here are
some item-specific examples; if you are selling
94
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

 A painting: Take a close-up picture of the artist’s signature. Apply this
concept to any artwork you have for sale, including pottery, sculpture,
prints — or signed first edition books.
 Silver: If the silver piece has a maker’s mark, take a close-up of the mark
itself.
 A designer dress: Make sure to take a close-up of the tag that shows
size, fabric content — even laundering instructions!
As with other aspects of your listing, put yourself in the position of a poten-
tial buyer. What parts of the item for sale would you like to see in detail?
Make sure that the entire surface of the item is visible in your picture(s).
If you zoom in too close on the item and leave out some of the edges, your
buyer might think you’re hiding something.
With multiple pictures of your merchandise, placement of the images in your
description can become either simpler (or, for that matter, more complex)
depending on the size of the images. If the pictures all have similar widths,
stacking them along the left or right side of your description might be the
most appropriate placement — just be sure to place the appropriate text for
each image right next to it.
Choosing a Main or Dominant Photo
So you’ve followed our instructions and taken multiple pictures of your item —
there will be one that stands out as the main (dominant) photo. This image
might be an overall picture of the item or a close-up of its most important 
element.
Emphasize this main photo in your listing. If you use eBay Picture Services,
this picture will be the first picture your customers encounter — and thus
will be the one displayed at the top of the listing. When you design the layout
of your description, this picture should be the primarily placed image, usu-
ally centered at the top, so that it is the first thing seen by your customer
when viewing the listing.
95
Chapter 7: Embedding Images for Flash and Effect

Saving Space with Thumbnails
One major problem with putting multiple images in your listing is how long
it takes to download them from the Internet. The longer customers have to
wait to see your item information, the greater is the chance that they’ll get
impatient and move on to another seller’s item. One way to avoid this situa-
tion is to use thumbnails — small images your customers can click to see
larger versions.
If you have more than two or three images in your listing, we recommend
using thumbnails that give your customers access to photos with greater
detail if (and only if) they want to see the details.
Selecting the Gallery image
When you list an item for sale at eBay, you have the option of paying a small
additional fee for a Gallery image. The Gallery image is a thumbnail photo,
automatically created by eBay, of a specific photo you designate when creat-
ing your item listing. The Gallery image appears to the left of your listing title
in search and category results — and, by virtue of this location, gives poten-
tial customers an additional incentive to choose your listing to view in more
detail. If you have an eBay Store, the Gallery image appears to the left of the
item title on your Store category pages, which gives customers an experience
similar to catalog shopping.
The Gallery image is a useful marketing tool that provides greater visibility
for your merchandise. Choosing the correct photo for the Gallery image can
have a significant effect on its value as a marketing device — and can help
you get the biggest bang for your buck when you use this feature.
Don’t automatically select the main picture of your item as the Gallery image;
that particular photo might be completely ineffective when reduced to eBay’s
standard thumbnail size (80 pixels wide by 60 pixels high as of this writing).
Do choose an image that, when reduced, will be easy to view and will catch
your potential customer’s eye.
96
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Creating thumbnails in two steps
Chapter 5 explains why you would link thumbnail images to larger images —
primarily to reduce the amount of time required to download your listing.
You can create your own a thumbnail image simply, in either of two ways —
crop the photo to a much smaller size or reduce the entire photo to a small
size (100 ×100 pixels works well) — and save the resulting picture to a sepa-
rate file. 
When you’re deciding how to create thumbnails, keep in mind that a direct
reduction in size can make the thumbnail image detail so small that it’s unrec-
ognizable. Customers who can’t make head nor tail of your item could get
frustrated and skip looking at it — or, if you require that they always click
through to the larger image, there goes the reason for using the thumbnail in
the first place. 
Figure 7-2 shows an example of an effective original image linked to a thumb-
nail image.
Figure 7-2:
Here’s an
original
image to
which a

a thumbnail.
97
Chapter 7: Embedding Images for Flash and Effect

When you create a thumbnail image, we suggest using a two-step process
that involves both cropping and resizing (an earlier chapter section — “Sizing
(and Resizing) Your Pictures” has how-to details). With your picture open in
an image-processing program, follow these steps:
1. Crop the image to eliminate extraneous detail and avoid a too-cluttered
thumbnail.
For example, if you’re selling a matching set of jewelry (necklace, earrings,
and bracelet), crop out the bracelet, earrings, and neck chain and leave
just the pendant, which shows up well in a thumbnail. 
2. Resize the cropped image to scale it down to a smaller size, usually
100 × 100 pixels.
The original photo that’s displayed when you click the thumbnail still retains
all the detail and the overall context. But the thumbnail image you create
with this process makes a clearer initial impression for your potential buyers.
Figure 7-3 shows the image from Figure 7-2 after it has been (first) cropped
and (second) resized.

98
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

If you need a lot of detail in your photos and wind up with image files larger
than the recommended maximum of 50 K — but find that a thumbnail image
simply doesn’t provide enough detail — don’t despair. A standard-size image
can be linked to a larger, higher-resolution photo in just the same way you’d
link a thumbnail to a standard image. In either case, you provide more infor-
mation only when it’s requested by the customer.
Offering a larger view
When you use thumbnail images in your listing, you need to include the
HTML coding that links each thumbnail to an alternative image (as described
in Chapter 5). Using HTML, you can set up this link to allow your customers to
click the thumbnail image and display a larger version of the picture, whether
in the current window or in a new window. If the image opens in a new window,
be sure to provide instructions on how to close the window and return to
your listing (many such temporary windows include a Close button).
When you make a thumbnail image into a link, your customers’ cursors will
change when passing over the thumbnail, indicating that they can click it.
But don’t assume that they’ll notice this nifty feature. In your listing text, be
sure to include a message that the image is clickable; mention it more than
once if necessary. You want to make it easy for your customers.

Chapter 8
Plumping Up Your Description
In This Chapter
 Painting the walls of your online store
 Installing fixtures and shelving
 Determining how detailed to make your description
H
ere, as in other chapters, we ask you to compare the online selling
experience with that of selling similar merchandise in a storefront.
Imagine an empty store, ready for you to move in and start selling your items.
You have (at least) four empty walls, nothing on the floor, and lots of wide
open space. First, you might consider painting the walls and installing some
carpet. Shelving or some type of display case is next, to exhibit your product
attractively. The type of shelving or cases you choose depends on the size
and shape of your merchandise.
The purpose of furnishing your storefront is to give your customers a com-
fortable, efficient shopping experience. We’ve all walked into a store where
there was so much stuffed into every nook and cranny that locating anything
in the mess was an overwhelming task. Likewise, an item listing that has text
and photos scattered haphazardly on the screen without any breaks, head-
ers, or divisions can make your online customers’ shopping trip equally
hairy.
So here we shift the focus: Previous chapters give you multiple ways to
enhance what’s in your item descriptions; this chapter shows how to
present the item, using HTML to create a repeatable structure for your
listing that effectively displays your wares. In particular, we get you started
creating the proper online fixtures — such as horizontal rules and tables, the
virtual equivalent of shelves and display cases for the merchandise in your
listing.

Filling In the Background
Just as you might paint (or otherwise decorate) the walls of your brand
new storefront, you might also fill in the background of your listing with
color, a picture, or a logo. More important than selecting a specific color or
image is remembering this main rule: The background must enhance — not
overwhelm — the item description. As Figure 8-1 shows, if the background is
what the customers notice, then it is too bright, too bold, or too detailed!
The background should complement, but not compete with, your text
description. Figure 8-2 shows how much better a muted background looks.

102
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Also consider the following points when you’re choosing a listing background:
 Coordinate your colors: Keep in mind the colors that appear in your
item pictures. If the usual background color in your product images is
(say) a teal green, the colors you choose for your auction template
should probably be in the blue and green neighborhood, and avoid the
red or yellow palette.
 Use color and images that identify you: As we discuss in Chapter 4, 
creating a unique template that establishes a “brand” for you and your
merchandise is a good marketing technique. The background color
becomes just a part of your entire color scheme.
 Don’t automatically dismiss white: A distinctive background color
(or image) isn’t the be-all and end-all for an effective listing template.
We’ve seen some very effective listings that use a plain white back-
ground as part of the color scheme. If the standard background color in
your item photos is a crisp, clear white that melds with the standard
white background of listing pages, it can help make the items in your
photos quite eye-catching.
The easiest way to change the background color in your listing is by placing the
entire description in an HTML table and defining the color with the bgcolor=
attribute of the table command. (Figure 8-3 shows this technique in action.)
Follow these steps to put a colorful background on your listing description:
1. Type the table command at the start of your listing description.
The command looks something like this:
<table width=100% bgcolor=”color”><tr><td>
And its components do the following:
• width=100% gives you a column width that uses the entire width
of the display screen.
• bgcolor=”color” sets the background to the color you specify;
just put the right code in place of the word color shown here.
Check out Marsha’s Web site (www.coolebaytools.com) for a
chart to help you with the color codes to use in the bgcolor=
attribute. You’ll also find sample HTML and CSS coding you can
use to create simple background colors, textures, or images.
• <tr><td> are the two commands which define table rows and
table columns. In this case, we have the simplest of tables with
only one row and one column. Stay tuned; we have an example of
one row and two columns coming up!
103
Chapter 8: Plumping Up Your Description

2. Follow the opening table command with your formatted listing-
description text.
Check out Chapter 4 to find out about HTML text formatting.
3. At the end of your listing text, type the tags that close the table com-
mand and turn off the background color. 
The closing command looks like this:
</td></tr></table>
Use the following commands to use an image as the background rather than a
simple color. (If you decide to use an image, make absolutely certain that the
image is light and unobtrusive so it doesn’t overwhelm your description text.)
<table width=”100%” cellpadding=20 cellspacing=0 border=1
background=”http://www.yourdomain.com/yourimage
.jpg”>
<tr><td width=”100%”>
Your text description goes here.
</td></tr></table>
Should you decide to use an image — perhaps your logo — as a background
in your listing, make sure that it is subtle! Otherwise your listing could easily
become unreadable, and if your potential customers can’t read the listing,
they’ll take their business elsewhere!

Arranging Stuff by Nesting Tables
In Chapter 7, we explained the importance of providing multiple images of
your items so your customers have all the information that’s pertinent to
their buying decisions. But where you place the images with respect to the
text that describes them is also important.
Have you ever noticed how some people manage to have a photo perfectly
aligned to the right or left of their descriptions? It’s really not that difficult to
do — just add a few HTML commands to the description (the tags themselves
won’t show up on-screen — just the results they create).
For example, Figure 8-4 shows a listing with a picture on the left of an item
description. (By the way, when the full version of this auction ran on eBay,
with the kind cooperation of the people on The View, we raised over $1,000
for UNICEF!)
The HTML coding for the listing shown in Figure 8-4 looks like the following
listing. (The code that does the job is bolded here so you can easily pick it
out, but there’s no need to bold HTML code when you use it.)

Deciding When Enough Is Enough
In this and preceding chapters — and we’re not done yet — we show you many
ways to fancy up the description in your listings. Your mission (should you
choose to accept it) is to pick which enhancements to use. Do yourself (and
your customers) a favor: Don’t try to use all the bells and whistles in one single
listing. A garish, hard-to-read description will, at best, frustrate the readers —
and at worst, drive them away to purchase the item from another, more tasteful
seller. Check out this book’s color insert for an illustration of this point.
The amount of effort — research, development, and testing — you put into
plumping up your description should be directly related to your potential
for profit-making on the sale of the item. If you have only one item and its
expected sales price is less than $20.00, spending hours crafting an intricate
listing description is a less-than-optimal use of your time. But if you have
tens — even hundreds — of a single item, spending a little time creating an
easy-to-read listing is worth the investment. Besides, if you have a deep
inventory of the merchandise, you’ll be using the listing for a long time, so
making it attractive will be easier on your eyes, too!
As with many other aspects of selling online, consider what methods you
would use in a storefront to market each of your products. If you’re only 
selling one type of item — and lots of it — you showcase the product in a
carefully decorated area of the store; a single item, on the other hand, could
go on a shelf without much thought, effort, or money spent on the display —
unless that item has a high dollar value, of course (say, Dorothy’s red shoes
or Toto’s basket). In that case, you’d spend more time and resources to direct
your customers’ attention to the item. Apply these same theories to market-
ing your online merchandise.

Adding Some Bells and Whistles
In This Chapter
 Using multimedia as a listing enhancement
 Not alienating your customer with unwanted sights and sounds
 Locating products that help you add bells and whistles
B
ells, whistles, animation, audio, video . . . the multimedia options 
available for sprucing up your listings are infinite! But they can also
be an embarrassment of riches. In this chapter, we go over many of these
options — and show you how to go about adding them (tastefully!) to your
listings.
Any extras you add to your listings have some looming pitfalls. The first is
that the more complexity you introduce in your listings, the greater the
potential for a problem with the page displaying properly. Additionally, the
multimedia approach can significantly increase the amount of time it takes
for your listing to load. The longer the wait, the greater the chance that your
customer will get tired of waiting (or get annoyed with unwanted details or
frills) and go elsewhere to make the purchase.
Warnings aside, you may have a really good reason to include a video or
audio clip in a listing. For example, if you’re selling a 78 RPM record, the best
way to show off the quality of the sound reproduction is to provide a clip of
what the recording actually sounds like — including all the pops and hisses.
Or if you have a working robot, a video clip of it actually doing what it does
would be invaluable. Because the advantages of including bells and whistles
may outweigh the potential pitfalls, we show you the best way to link to
audio and video clips, or animations in your listings.

Animating Your Graphics
Animated images can be eye-catching for eBay shoppers, but (for the sake of
your sales — and okay, as a public service) consider all the facts about the
impact of including animation in your listings. For example, offering shoppers
a slideshow is an effective way to display multiple images of your merchandise.
But don’t use this feature without understanding that every one of those 
multiple images still has to be downloaded before the slideshow can begin.
In effect, the only real advantage to using a slideshow — versus displaying all
images right in your listing — is to reduce the amount of screen space taken
up by the images. Best solution: Make the slide show optional, as shown in
Figure 9-1.
We strongly suggest that you avoid including animated images if they’re 
unrelated to your merchandise. That is, when you list your jewelry for sale,
don’t include an image of a jaguar doing the jitterbug just because you think
it’s cute and funny. That said, you may decide that an animated graphic is the
very thing to liven up some of your listings. For example, if you want to sell
Olympic memorabilia, an animated image of a speed skater zooming across
the top of your listing may differentiate your listing from the masses of list-
ings out there. To include an animated graphic in your listing, you can use
the same HTML command that you use for a static (nonmoving) image, as 
follows:
<img src=”http://www.yourwebsite.com/animation.gif” />
In this command, http://www.yourwebsite.com/animation.gif is the
location on the Internet of the animated graphic image you’re adding to your
listing. For more details on including images in your listings, see Chapter 7.
And check out Figure 9-1, which shows a listing that offers customers the
opportunity to view a slideshow of product images.
It’s wise to approach the use of animation with some trepidation. Besides the
obvious potential for annoying your customer, there is a small danger that if
your animation uses high contrast or flashing images, it can cause seizures in
users who have photosensitive epilepsy. If you decide to use animation, be
sure that the look is smooth — not flickering — and that the images change
at a slow speed.

Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Playing Some Music
Sometimes providing a sound clip for your customer might help convince
them to purchase your merchandise — especially if you sell (say) music
boxes, CDs, or dolls that sing. Any of these items make good candidates for
providing small sound files (recorded from the item itself) in your listing —
but make sure the customer has the option to listen to them or not. 
(How to suggest this tactfully? Oh well.) Please don’t include a continuously
looping recording of your favorite song as background music for your list-
ings. Another inadvisable use of audio is including a song that is related
in some way to your merchandise. Honestly, a rousing patriotic march
won’t provide additional information about the political buttons you have
for sale — nor will a lullaby be the focal selling point for your handmade
baby items. Customers who get clobbered with unwanted sound are less
inclined to buy.

Chapter 9: Adding Some Bells and Whistles

When you want to include an appropriate sound file in your listing — to be
played on demand — use the following HTML command:
<a href=”http://www.yourisp.com/youraudiofile.wav”>Click
here</a> to listen to the music!
Yep, it’s just an anchor link to an external file location — where you uploaded
the audio file. You can put this link anywhere you’d like in your description.
Telling Your Story with Speech
Lately, we’ve noticed a rash of listings that “talk” to us. Although an overbear-
ing speech can be as irritating as unwanted music, you might want to include
a brief sound bite to emphasize a specific feature of your listing, a special
sale, or your terms and conditions. Avoid including a message that repeats
over and over; this alone can make an otherwise-acceptable recording into a
nuisance that drives your customer out the door!
If you are using a product that offers computer-generated speech, be sure to
listen to the recording before you include it in your listing. We’ve heard some
programs that don’t pronounce the words properly, and others that have an
annoying sound quality.
Any information presented to the customer as an audio file must also be
included in your listing text because some shoppers either don’t have 
speakers or don’t routinely leave them turned on.
Streaming Video to the Bidder
Streaming video is becoming more and more “visible” — not so much in terms
of visual clarity (though that’s usually fine), but rather as a prevalent capabil-
ity on the Web. Recently NBC has begun making its nightly news broadcasts
available online in streaming video format. This probably doesn’t mean we’ll
all start watching television on our computers, but it is an indication of how
common streaming video on the Internet has become.
As with sound clips, providing a video clip for your customers might some-
times help convince them to purchase your merchandise. If you’re selling
(say) a video you produced yourself, a robot, a doll that walks and talks —
any of these would be candidates for putting small video files in your listing.
112
Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

As you can imagine, audio and video files are more than one hundred times
the size of still images. Rather than requiring large files to be downloaded
prior to viewing (or listening), streaming media technology is the best 
solution. When audio, video, or both are streamed, they are retrieved in 
compressed form and viewed as they arrive on the viewer’s computer. 
This is accomplished by a player, which is either integrated into the browser
being used, or an additional program which starts up when the media starts
to download. Most computers come with one or more media players already
installed. Should you decide to use streaming media, one of the factors to
keep in mind is whether it is capable of being played by the most common
of the media players on your customers’ computers.
Finding Third-Party Solutions
New vendors that supply methods for providing rich media content are join-
ing the market with the speed that you’d expect from any growing industry.
For example, you can find software and services that help you add just the
right amount of multimedia flair, give customers the information they need
to be fully informed about your product, or add sound, streaming video, and
functionality to your listings. (We’re still not sure how we’ll feel about aroma-
vision — though it might work if you’re selling designer fragrances!)
When you, as a seller, become a buyer for such a product or service, eBay
provides the Solutions Directory. It’s a handy place to locate and compare
third-party providers in addition to products developed or acquired by
eBay itself.
To access the Solutions Directory, go to http://solutions.ebay.com or
take the following steps:
1. Click the Site Map link at the top of any eBay page.
2. Find the Selling Tools area (about halfway down the page in the
center column).
3. Click the eBay Solutions Directory link.
The Solutions Directory, as shown in Figure 9-2, appears.
When you’ve reached the main Solutions Directory page, you find a list of
main categories of solutions — any of which you can browse by clicking the
link for the category title. You can also use the search box at the top of the
page, and look for providers of solutions by typing in keywords. For example,
you can type audio or video in the search box and click the Search button to
retrieve a list of related solutions.

Chapter 9: Adding Some Bells and Whistles

Checking credentials of solution providers
Whether you browse a solutions category or a search results page (as shown
in Figure 9-3), you can compare the list of solutions. Note that when the Search
Results page first appears, the solutions are sorted in order by Solution Title.
To change the order in which they are displayed, just click any of the column
headers (such as User Rating).

Clicking any of the solution titles takes you to a listing details page where you
find more information about the third-party solution, including:
 Company Name
 Sites Supported, for example, US, Canada, Australia (eBay country-
specific sites)
 Categories Supported, which is a list of the main categories on eBay
where the solution can be used
 Platforms Supported, such as Web Application or Client Application - PC
 Detailed Description of the product or service that outlines the exact
details of the service, its benefits to you (the seller), and the features the
company feels are the most important to their customers
 Pricing Details
 User Ratings, which are similar to feedback ratings for buyers and sellers
on eBay, are displayed at the bottom of the listing details page for each
third-party solution.

Chapter 9: Adding Some Bells and Whistles
Accommodating the visually impaired
Throughout this book we’ve warned against
overusing graphics, color, animated graphics,
and other fancy enhancements that add nothing
to the information about your merchandise for
sale, but (too easily) add the potential for irritat-
ing your customer. Another thing to keep in mind
while designing your listings is that some of the
visitors to your pages might be visually impaired
in some way. Even if it’s just the “long-arm” syn-
drome that aging baby boomers are beginning
to experience (holding the fine print at arm’s
length), keeping your listings easy on the eye —
and not assuming that others see in the same
way you do — is a good habit to develop.
Here are a few things to keep in mind about
visual limitations when designing your listings:
 Colorblindness is not always limited to the
inability to distinguish between red and
green — other colors may be affected by
the condition as well.
 Yellow text is often difficult to read, even
when displayed on a dark background.
 The use of a special browser that renders
Web pages into either Braille or speech due
to the complete inability of the user to see
pages distinctly.
 Small text can be difficult to read — and the
older the user, the bigger the segment of the
population affected by this problem.
 Users may have disabilities such as
dyslexia that prevent them from reading or
comprehending text properly.
Limiting the use of graphics and other bells and
whistles in your listings not only reduces load
time for all your customers, but may also prove
less stressful and distracting to the average
person (as well as the visually impaired).

The eBay Certified Provider icon that you find in the listings in the Solutions
Directory and on many of the third-party provider’s Web sites does not mean
that the company sporting the icon is in any way approved or recommended
by eBay. This mark simply means that eBay reviews the company’s claim to
ensure that it can provide eBay members with services and solutions to grow
their eBay businesses. Among other criteria, participating companies must
have extensive experience with eBay, pass a strict certification exam, and
provide a number of proven customer references — which eBay checks
before granting certification.
Figure 9-4 shows the solutions detail page for eBay’s Selling Manager product.
Note the comment eBay displays at the top of every User Rating page:
“User Ratings are shown with most-recent comments first. Each comment
is attributed to its author who takes full responsibility for the comment.
If you have any questions or concerns about a particular comment, please
contact the author directly by clicking on the author’s User ID and then click-
ing the contact member link.” As with transactional feedback on eBay, the
reputation of the person leaving a comment is almost as important as the
comment itself.

Part II: Lining Your Pockets with HTML 

Letting buyers silence the 
bells and whistles
Any audio or video solution you add to your listing should be optional for the
customer and be provided in a streaming mode if at all possible. That is, any
time you include audio or video in a listing, give your potential customers the
option of not listening or viewing. Customers can view your listings in many
different ways — and places — which raises the possibility that audio or video
would be an unwelcome intrusion. (Think: Employees browsing your store
from their offices during lunch hour, or a mother whose children are napping,
may want to keep things quiet.)
So as you’re evaluating a product that supplies any multimedia content, check
the product specifications to make sure your viewers can easily turn off the
multimedia elements supplied by the product. If you can’t tell whether the
product has this capability, ask the product’s provider this essential question
when evaluating their service and deciding whether to add it to your arsenal
of eBay selling tools.
It’s possible that some of your customers might have their computers’ sound
turned off (for any number of reasons), so be sure that any information you
include as either a sound or video clip is also included in the text of your 
listing.

Turning Pictures
into Dollars

In this part . . .
O
ne of the reasons we wrote this book was to demys-
tify the photography process. So we do that in this
part. And perhaps we go into a bit more detail than you
really need right away, but we know you want your pic-
tures to be, uh, picture-perfect (or is that picturesque?). To
that end, we tell you about the lighting, tools, and tech-
niques you need to prepare images that show off every
item’s good side. We also offer advice on handling the digi-
tal files after you get that great picture. What we won’t 
do is fill your head with lots of jargon and unnecessary
manual adjustments; you just find out how to take good
pictures that picture your goods right — and sell them.

Chapter 10
Choosing and Knowing 
Your Camera
In This Chapter 
 Spending the fewest dollars possible
 Discovering the magic of digital cameras
 Figuring out what the gizmos do
 Working the buttons
Your digital camera is the heart of your eBay operation (okay, maybe your
computer is the heart, but this book is about photography and HTML, so
give us a little leeway here). Without quality photos, your listings end up blah
and unattractive. You need alluring pictures to catch the eye of the buyer.
Your pictures tell the story of your item, and if the item looks off-color or out
of focus, odds are it won’t seem as appealing to your prospective customers.
Retailers — those who know you’re an eBay seller — will play on your goal
of taking appealing photos — and if they think you’re not savvy about digital
cameras, they may steer you toward an omnifunctional, complex (and did we
mention, pricey?) model.
Reading this chapter sets you straight, and helps you save time and money
when you choose and use your digital camera. The decision’s not that hard;
don’t let an overzealous salesperson talk you into spending unnecessary bucks.
You can buy a simple camera that allows minor adjustments. You accomplish
the rest of the photography magic with the proper setup (and we tell you about
setting up in Chapter 13).

Deciding How Much to Spend
Thinking about your target price and how much you want to spend is nice; in
theory. If you’re anything like us, once you’re faced with an array of cameras
(which tend to look all the same — even after first glance) you start to get
picky and look for the one with the most horsepower — or options in this
case. Remember that for eBay photography more horsepower is purely
unnecessary. If you’d like to spend $500 on a camera, you may, but you’ll be
using only a fraction of the camera’s abilities for your eBay pictures. You can
find a perfectly suitable camera for your online photography needs for under
$150. You can use a high-dollar camera for family photos, but a basic one is
all you need for eBay.
Soon-to-be-big-time sellers, just starting out in an eBay business (with no
experience on the site), seem compelled to go out and buy the most expen-
sive digital camera with scads of megapixels (more about those in a minute).
Maybe that’s a macho thing — but realistically, it’s overkill. For eBay images,
there are a few important (and some merely desirable) features to look for
when you’re shopping for a digital camera. Here’s our short list:
 Optical versus digital zoom. Zoom is the feature you need to get close-
ups when you photograph smaller or more detailed items in the macro
setting (say, the fine inlay on that banjo you’re selling). 
• Digital zoom is the latest hocus-pocus from the camera industry.
It simulates what happens when you shoot moving pictures with a
camcorder and zoom in, enlarging a picture in much the same way
as image-editing software: It centers the focus over half the focal
plane (the camera’s focusing area), and uses software interpolation
(computer magic) to enlarge the picture — which may make your
image slightly fuzzy.
• Optical zoom, on the other hand, harkens back to the fine lenses
used in traditional photography. No software tricks here, just 
old-fashioned glass and light: Optical zoom is produced through
magnification from the camera’s lens, using the camera’s internal
lens optics to produce a vivid picture. Professional photographers
spend big bucks on lenses, and the zoom lens is one of the most
important. Select a camera with the highest optical-zoom value
you can afford.
Figure 10-1 shows one place to look to find out whether your camera has
optical zoom.
If you’ve used a regular single-lens reflex camera, you might find it useful
to note that a 3x optical zoom gives you results equivalent to what you’d
get from a 35mm to 105mm zoom lens.
122
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

 Megapixels. A megapixel is a unit of measurement reflecting resolution
when the number of pixels is equal to or greater than one million. For
example, multiply the active horizontal by active vertical pixels in a full
computer display (1280 × 1024) and you get 1,310,720 pixels — basically
a 1.3-megapixel image!
The more megapixels, the more detailed your image will be. Your images
can be enlarged without losing precious detail. Fun, but not always prac-
tical for eBay image photography; we don’t need ’em (mega-megapixels,
that is). Here’s why: If you use a high resolution, multi-megapixel image
on eBay, it will either look huge on your listing page (taking up the entire
screen), or the file size will be so pixel-bloated that it could take several
minutes for the image to load. No point in showing a high-res image to
customers who have already moved on.
For online use, all you need from a camera is 800 × 600 pixels because
the average computer display is incapable of taking advantage of more
pixels.
 Power Supply. When you’re picking out your camera, be sure to check
into the length of time the camera’s battery will hold a charge. The last
thing you want is to run out of juice at the wrong moment. Even though
you may adore having a huge LCD on the back of the camera for image

Chapter 10: Choosing and Knowing Your Camera

preview, those things burn power like there’s no tomorrow! Consider the
following:
• Look for a camera battery with at least three hours of photo-
taking time.
• Keep a spare battery on hand.
Marsha likes to keep a Lithium CR-V3 battery (which substitutes
nicely in many cameras for the two AA batteries) in her purse so
she’ll be prepared if her camera battery runs low while she’s on
the road. CR-V3s seem to last forever!
• Invest in a charger and rechargeable lithium ion batteries.
We recommend that you get rechargeable backup batteries for all your
cameras. These batteries last a long time and are worth the cost
of investment.
 Memory storage. Many cameras have up to 10 megabytes of internal
memory. This means you can store up to that amount, without using any
external removable storage media. You retrieve images held in memory
with a hard-wired connection to your computer. Most cameras also have
removable media. 
Your computer may have appropriate slots for inserting and reading
media, but you may also need an external media-reader if your computer
isn’t so outfitted. Consider it as the equivalent of a teeny disk drive for the
little cards; you insert ’em into the reader to transfer the data into your
computer. You can buy a new USB reader on eBay for as little as $20.00 —
and various removable storage media (as illustrated in Figure 10-2) are
currently available:
• Floppy disks: Sony has a line of Mavica cameras that save images
to a regular 31⁄2-inch floppy disk. After taking your pictures, you just
remove the floppy and put it into your A: drive. Voilà! The pictures
are available to your computer for copying to a directory on your
hard drive, cropping, and uploading.
• CompactFlash memory card: This is a small medium, slightly
smaller than a matchbook. There are also readers for a laptop’s
PCMCIA slot. CompactFlash cards come in different sizes, holding
from 16MB to 2GB of memory capacity.
• Secure digital card: The smallest incarnation of mini-storage is
the secure digital card, an amazing little piece of technology in a
postage-stamp size — and also one of the most durable. It’s encased
in plastic, as are the CompactFlash card and the Memory Stick, and it
uses metal connector contacts (rather than pins and plugs like other
cards) — making it less prone to damage. These cards can be set
to hold up to one gigabyte, but more commonly hold 256 to 512MB.
124
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

• SmartMedia cards: A SmartMedia card — slightly smaller than a
Compact Flash card — is very thin and has no plastic outer case.
It’s only used in a few brands of digital cameras (such as Olympus).
SmartMedia cards come in different data sizes, and hold from 8MB
to 128MB.
• Memory Stick: This tiny media card is about the size of piece of
chewing gum and as long as an AA battery. The Memory Stick — a
Sony device used in most Sony products (cameras, PCs, and video
recorders) — can now hold as much as 2GB of memory. One of the
great things about a Memory Stick is that it can be used in numer-
ous devices.
• Mini CD, CD/RW and DVD: These mini-optical discs hold tons of
images for eBay, as much as 185MB. You can read them right in
your computer’s CD or DVD reader. If you look at the disc platter
of your computer’s CD or DVD drive, you’ll notice a smaller round
indentation. This is to hold the mini-disc format.
You may find that you use more than one type of medium with your 
digital camera. And because you can record any type of digital data on
these removable media, you may find other uses for them. For example,
when you want to back up files or move larger files from a desktop to a
laptop, you can transfer them via your digital media. Simply copy the
files from your desktop computer onto the medium (say, a Sony Memory
Stick), plug the medium into the port or adapter on the laptop, and copy
the files.

125
Chapter 10: Choosing and Knowing Your Camera

 Tripod mount: Have you ever had a camera hanging around your neck
while you’re trying to repackage some eBay merchandise that you’ve
just photographed? Or perhaps you’ve set down the camera for a
minute and then can’t find it? Avoid this hassle by using a tripod to
hold your camera. Tripods also help you avoid the blurry pictures that
result from a shaky grip on the camera. To use a tripod, you need a
tripod mount, the little screw hole that you see at the bottom of some
cameras. (The upcoming section gives you some tips on how to find
the right tripod.)
 Macro-setting capability or threading for a lens adapter: These fea-
tures will come in handy if you plan to photograph coins, jewelry, or
small, detailed items. A camera’s macro setting enables you to get in
really close to items while keeping them in focus. Usually the macro
mode can focus as close as 1 inch and as far away as 10 inches. A small
flower icon in the camera’s menu normally signifies the macro setting.
A threaded lens mount is an alternative that enables you to screw in 
different types of lenses to give the camera macro-focus capability.
The average camera’s focal length (focus range) is from 3 feet to infinity.
If your camera says its macro-focus range is set at 5.1 inches, it means
you can’t focus it clearly on an object any closer than 5.1 inches. Macro
pictures require a steady hand; any vibration can blur your image.
Some of the newest hot-shot, high-dollar cameras have a feature called
image stabilization, which automatically compensates for the shakiest
of hands.
 White-balance setting: Most eBay digital photographers set the camera’s
white balance to Auto and hope for the best. Look for a camera that allows
you to adjust the white balance. (This can be a bit tricky, so we show
you how to make this adjustment later in the chapter.) Keep in mind
that different manufacturers use different presets. The list of options
can include settings for incandescent lights, twilight, fluorescent lights,
outdoor, indoor, or shade. All these lighting situations have different
color temperatures. It’s worthwhile to take the time to play with the vari-
ous white-balance settings of your camera in the different places where
you normally photograph eBay merchandise. While you’re experiment-
ing, always take notes on the settings you use; that way, you can identify
which ones give you the truest colors in your digital images.
At the end of the day, we recommend that you buy a brand-name camera.
Marsha uses a Sony Mavica FD92 mounted to a Cloud Dome (an apparatus
that diffuses light, see Chapter 14 for how to use it) for jewelry and coin pic-
tures. She also keeps a Nikon CoolPix 3200 around for shooting images of . . .
well . . . just about everything else. It turns out that her Sony Mavica DSC-H1
is far, far too much camera for eBay images. The FD92 may be outdated, but it
has all the bells and whistles needed for eBay photos (that is, not too many).
It stores images on a Sony Memory Stick or on a floppy disk, which are
simple to pop out and insert into the computer. 
126
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

127
Chapter 10: Choosing and Knowing Your Camera
An oldie-but-goodie Mavica . . .
Marsha just got off the phone with one of eBay’s
top sellers. She asked him what kind of camera
he uses for his eBay product photography.
Sheepishly, he replied that he uses several cam-
eras from the early Sony Mavica FD series. He
was using the almost-antique FD73 model (vintage
1999) with a 10x optical zoom. Marsha countered
that she loved her FD73, recommended it to every-
one, and finally sold it to another eBay seller who
really wanted one. Marsha recommended that
camera in her books as the best until she snapped
up the Mavica FD92, which came out in 2001.
This model is almost ideally designed for online
photography. Here are some of the features:
Resolution: 1.3-megapixel CCD, 1472x1104 
Zoom: 8x optical, 16x digital 
Media: 3.5’’ Floppy Disk and/or a Memory
Stick 
Auto Contrast Detect, Auto focus: 9.8” to
infinity
Macro Auto focus: 1.2” minimum
Computer connection: Connects with Macs
and PCs via an included USB cable.
All this, plus the FD92 has a crisp, 2.5-inch color
LCD screen for previewing images, a recharge-
able InfoLithium battery, and a quick battery
charger.
Marsha still uses her Mavica, and keeps it per-
manently attached to her Cloud Dome for cap-
turing macro images. (See Chapter 14 for more
on the Cloud Dome tabletop photography studio
for jewelry and tiny items.) How convenient is it
that you can store up to 30 pictures (in Web res-
olution) on a floppy disk and then pop the disk
into your computer to transfer the images with-
out cables or messing with software? And if
your computer has no floppy disk drive, you can
use the camera’s memory-stick slot with a Sony
Memory Stick (which holds so many photos that
Marsha has never filled it up!). 

When budget is also a factor in the purchase decision (and when isn’t it?), savvy
eBay shoppers find deals on lower-resolution cameras (3 megapixels or less).
Because much of the world’s population is upgrading to mucho-megapixel
cameras, the displaced — but still perfectly good — low-resolution cameras
show up for sale on eBay for a pittance. (We bet you could find a camera that
fits your needs right now on eBay for considerably less than $150.) You can
be right there to snap up the deals! And remember that many professional
camera stores also sell used equipment.
Checking Out the Important Parts
Strangely (or not so strangely), digital cameras are pretty much the same
from manufacturer to manufacturer. Take a look at Figure 10-3, which shows
you two of Marsha’s cameras. Notice that several gizmos on the cameras
seem to be the same — whether the camera is a Nikon or a Sony.
Many of the buttons are self-explanatory (Shutter button = push here to take
picture), while others are a bit more esoteric. Figure 10-3 shows a sampling.

128
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

Most digital cameras have the following dials and switches:
 Zoom toggle: These two buttons, generally placed toward the top of the
camera (as shown in Figure 10-4), function very simply: Press one side
and the camera zooms in (gets closer); press the other side, and the
camera zooms out (gets further away).
 Optical viewfinder: Just as on a trusty old (and we mean old) Brownie
camera, you have the option of viewing your subject through a viewfinder
versus using the LCD screen. If you’ve ever tried to look at an LCD screen
in sunny, bright conditions, you’ll know the value of alternative viewing.
LCDs are rendered pretty useless in the sun; they just aren’t bright enough
for accurate viewing.
 Mode dial: Here’s a look (in Figure 10-5) at magically quick tool that
enhances your control over your camera. You can choose from a
plethora of settings that make your camera do technical magic —
for example, portrait mode for taking pictures of your loved ones and
fireworks mode for taking images of nighttime fireworks exhibitions —
although (sadly) very little of this fun stuff is useful for eBay purposes
(where generally you just set your camera on auto and shoot). Have
fun with the various modes when you take your trusty camera out for
a walk — or on vacation!
 Control button: The control button (sometimes more than one) is usu-
ally a quick toggle for five basic functions. Pressing in the center usually
finalizes your selection from among these:
• Flash control: Here you click to force the flash to go off (whether
or not the camera thinks it should) or to turn off the flash. Having
that kind of sayso is often useful when you’re trying not to wash
out details with too much light.

• Macro photography: You can only zoom into your item so far with
the toggle buttons, but when you push this button to set the Macro
mode, you may be able (depending on your camera) to zoom in
your focus as close as a couple of inches — accurately!
• Self-timer: Yawn. Use this when you have the camera set on a
tripod and want to jump into the image with your spouse before
the shutter goes off.
• Image review: Shows you the last image you shot, putting it in the
LCD screen for quality review.
• Menu selectors: Thought you caught us stumped, eh? Well, yeah,
there are only four buttons or directions on this control — but then
there are the menus. When you select the Setup mode from the
Mode dial (or another button on your camera that might say Menu),
you can use these buttons to make selections and go up or down
the menus.

Making the Magic Setting(s) 
for Quality Images
I know, I know, you don’t have a good picture unless it’s in focus. We’ll give
you that. But in our experience, focus isn’t the biggest issue that eBay pho-
tographers have to face. Often a photographed item is masked with too much
shadow or washed out by too much light (we help you resolve both these
excesses in Chapter 12). The complexity of producing accurate colors in your
photos can easily become the more dreaded issue.
Never fear! Chapter 14 shows you how you can control color reproduction in
special situations. But before diving into that topic, consider: You can turn to
one simple-to-set control — White Balance — to improve color right away.
The good news is that most digital cameras have one.
White balance
White balance is sort of the digital equivalent of a good laundry detergent —
it makes sure your whites stay white instead of turning yellow — and that
helps keep the other colors vibrant. Take a look at our color insert to see the
results of setting the white balance in a product photo. You’ll notice that
taking photos with particular light bulbs (and no other ambient lighting)
alters the colors of the resulting pictures. Table 10-1 outlines how different
types of lighting will affect your images.

Incandescent bulb

131
Chapter 10: Choosing and Knowing Your Camera

Most top-name cameras will have a setting to cover all the lighting situations
listed in Table 10-1. These settings work very well, but you have to remember
to set up your camera for each shooting session. (You can find the instructions
for making these settings in your camera’s manual, or online.) We’ve had 
success with all modes except Incandescent. That yellow cast from regular
lighting is a bear to get rid of. If you use regular light bulbs in your lights, we
suggest counteracting the “incandescent yellows” by using a full-spectrum
white-light bulb (such as the GE Reveal) or a halogen-type bulb.
Your camera may also have an “auto” (automatic) White Balance (WB) set-
ting. This setting will work sometimes — when you have perfectly balanced
lighting for your items (sadly, we can’t claim that positive experience). If you
really want best results, set the white balance manually. It’s usually as easy
as pressing the right button to let the camera’s computer take a look at the
ambient lighting and make its own adjustments.

Outfitting Your Studio
In This Chapter
 Setting up your studio
 Getting together the basics
 Considering advanced equipment for specialized tasks
 Gathering the things you need for good pictures
A
bad workman blames his tools — we’ve certainly heard that time and
again. Coincidentally, blaming the tools is also a common phenomenon
amongst eBay sellers who just can’t get a decent photo. Personally, we feel
the problem stems from laziness — on two fronts. Some sellers don’t take
enough time to get the picture quality that’s necessary to display their items.
Nor do they take the time to set up their pictures properly before shooting —
for example, shooting a picture of a crystal vase against a white backdrop
(versus a black one) makes the vase to blend totally into the background
and prevents the viewer from seeing any details.
Simple, small things, such as props and backdrops, can help you build a good
informal photo studio. But don’t go nuts thinking that you need to outfit your
studio all at once — that’s an ongoing venture (at least it is for us — we add
items continually) over many years. A well-stocked studio for shooting online
photos stays current with the latest “tricks of the trade.” This chapter lets you
in on the details of the essential equipment and accessories you need — and
how to use them.
Storing Your Studio Equipment
We realize that the entire population of eBay sellers may not have as much
room as Marsha does for her eBay photo studio. At least that used to be the
case. Marsha used to have an entire room set up just for prepping the merchan-
dise and shooting the pictures. Now most of that room is filled with shelves of
merchandise for eBay — but, oops, that’s a different book!

134
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 
Letting the chips fall where they may
The wonderful (and demanding) thing about
having an eBay business is that you need to be
ready for anything. True entrepreneurs often
find themselves in a situation where they can
make money selling something that’s outside
the realm of their usual items. For example, we
just heard of one such instance from a fellow
eBay-seller friend and his wife. They usually sell
random electronics and computer parts, but
they recently came upon a box of old casino
chips while visiting a local estate sale. Their list-
ing reads, “We acquired this and many other
rare casino chips from an estate sale of an 82-
year-old woman. The chips were stored in a dry
basement in a covered box and were appar-
ently there since the early 1940s.” 
Being true eBay entrepreneurs, these sellers have
two eBay User IDs: one for their regular business
and another for buying and selling the oddball
items they come across. But more to the point of
this story is that they fortunately had a wide array
of tools available in their photography studio, so
they were able to produce a fine photo (shown
in the sidebar) of this prized vintage casino chip.
The bidding started at $9.99 and ended seven
days later at $39,345.00. A record price for a
single casino chip!

Most sellers don’t have a lot of space for a permanent studio — so making
efficient use of the space you have is the name of the game. At the very least,
keep all the supplies for your eBay photo studio in a few boxes that you can
conveniently access at a moment’s notice (no, that doesn’t mean stored in
the rafters of the garage). That way, when you want to start shooting pictures
in the dining room, you can pull out whatever you need from your prepack-
aged boxes.
Many photography and lighting products sold on eBay come with their own
storage boxes, so stowing these items is fairly easy. I suggest that you pack-
age your portable photo studio into several labeled boxes, broken down in
the following manner:
 Lighting and tripods
 Cloud Dome
 Lighting panels and/or tents
 Props (backgrounds, risers)
 Cleaning supplies
 Apparel kit (items you use only when you photograph clothing)
If, due to lack of space, you wind up having to shoot on a usually cluttered
kitchen counter or desktop (where you’ve shoved aside your paperwork
and/or cat food), be sure to acquire and use an inexpensive photo stage,
such as an infinity board — which you can see pictured in Figure 11-1 and
(no surprise) you can find for sale on eBay pretty easily.
Stocking Up on Studio Essentials
At the outset, we want you to know that we’re as cost-conscious as anyone
(especially Marsha, who has been known on occasion to be outright cheap).
In this chapter, we list some items that would help you prepare your online
photo studio for almost any eventuality. But let’s not be chintzy about it.
Many other current books suggest that you put together temporary studio
props out of cardboard and light filters out of cut pieces of shower curtain.
By and large, if you’re serious about your online business, skip the duct-tape
solutions.
135
Chapter 11: Outfitting Your Studio

There are good reasons to purchase substantial, quality products for your
photo studio:
 Durability: Products designed for a photo studio (even if they are entry-
level and not top-dollar) are less likely to get crumpled and trashed.
 Suitability: Products made for a real photo studio are probably made so
they won’t catch on fire from your lights (a significant benefit).
 Resale value: Studio equipment maintains its value while you use it.
Although this may be the least important reason to furnish your studio
with quality products, if you decide that this business isn’t for you, you
can always resell your photo studio equipment to someone else.
In general, don’t buy everything all at once! The exception is, of course, that
rare deal you might find on complete kits — or if you buy a whole used photo
studio from another seller who may be retiring from the online selling game
(although we can’t imagine who might consider retiring)!
Getting the basics
Besides a camera, an effective photo studio needs several basic pieces of light-
ing and background equipment — fortunately, they’re pretty straightforward
and aren’t that hard to find. If you’re selling particular types of merchandise,
you may need, say, a mannequin to display clothing or an easel to display art-
work. If you sell a variety of items, then you can use all such extras you can
lay your hands on. Marsha is a bit of a gadget freak; her photo studio seems
to sprout new ones all the time — Cloud Domes, tripods, light panels — to
make photo-taking easier.
Be sure to double-check with your tax person, but in most cases the money
you spend for photo-studio equipment becomes a write-off for your profitable
eBay business.
There are really only two things you can’t do without — besides your
camera — in your photo studio:
 Lights: You need a floodlight with a reflector — and something to hold
the light in place — either a clamp or a traditional light stand. No need
to spend big bucks here, although it’s best to use lights designed specifi-
cally for photography (lights made to illuminate a garage for nighttime
automotive work are not exactly what you need).
You can also use a small tabletop true-light lamp for illuminating smaller
items. Be sure your bulb is rated at least 5000 K, where K stands for
Kelvin, a measurement of light’s color temperature. See the sidebar,
“Checking out the Kelvin (K) rating” for more on this aspect of lighting.
136
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

 Backgrounds/backdrops: Here’s where you use your imagination. A back-
drop can be almost any solid-color surface (whether painted or draped)
that provides a contrasting background for your image photography.
Remember, your goal is to show the product — not lay out a museum
piece. The only thing you want a picture of is your item; a clean, solid
surface behind it makes the item easy to see but doesn’t call attention
to the background. Here are some suggestions:
• Backgrounds come in many shapes and sizes. You can get paper,
fabric, or use a portable plastic photo stage for smallish items.
• In professional photo-talk, seamless is a large roll of 3-foot (and
wider) paper that comes in various colors and is suspended and
draped behind the model and over the floor so the model seems
to be floating in infinity — and is instantly the center of attention.
Photographers also drape seamless over tabletop shots, or use
fabrics such as muslin instead.
• We recommend using wrinkle-free backdrops in neutral colors —
such as white, light gray, “natural,” and black — for photographing
your merchandise. That way, the color of the paper or fabric doesn’t
clash with or distract from your items.
For taking a picture anywhere, indoors or out, a portable photo stage is a
valuable tool. It’s made of a textured plastic made to be set in a curved
shape; the stage rests on any surface and permits you to take a clean picture
without any extraneous stuff in the background. You can use a photo stage
to achieve an infinity look by curving the background under the item, as
shown in Figure 11-1. Best of all, you can store it flat on a bookshelf until
you need it next.

graphed on

Chapter 11: Outfitting Your Studio

Checking out some common setups
Take a look at Figures 11-2 through 11-4. They show you several of Marsha’s
photo setups — and as you can see, she’s about ready to photograph nearly
anything that comes her way.
The original home photo studio (shown in Figure 11-2), is a super beginner’s
setup. It has a black backdrop, a white backdrop (pictured), and can be set
up anywhere in the house. In the background, notice the light-diffusing device
for specialty photos such as macro jewelry shots (Marsha uses a Cloud Dome
quite a bit for that these days).
Figure 11-3 shows another option: a pure white photo cube, lit with either
small clamp lights (shown) or with tall floodlights. A photo cube works well
for finely detailed and collectible objects — as well as any other object that
will fit in it. Using a translucent white fabric cube, you can fully illuminate
your item without glare, harsh shadows, or detail burnout!
In Figure 11-4, you can see how to change a photo setup to accommodate large
items by placing Lite-Wings(r) light panels on tall floodlights (regular lights
inside hemispherical aluminum reflectors, mounted on adjustable stands).
With a setup like this, you can get close to the same effect as you get when
Figure 11-2:

using a Cloud Cube on a table — but for much larger items! Traditionally 
photographers used expensive, umbrellalike reflectors for this purpose —
but the umbrellas required special mounts for the light stands, and the 
Lite-Wings attach simply with Velcro.

Chapter 11: Outfitting Your Studio

Adding on Other Valuable Equipment
The basics are great, but (as with any venture worth doing right), there will
always be things you can add to your arsenal of tools to improve your pic-
tures. We’re constantly adding new stuff to our photo studios (most recently,
Marsha’s new set of risers — gotta love those gadgets). All professionals have
a bag of tricks, and you might find that the tools in this section are more than
you thought you’d need for photographing your items.
Good photographs can help sell your merchandise, so to take this part of
your business seriously. If you sell only one type of item, you won’t need
such a varied selection of photography tools, but you should have the basic
photo setup and a few extras. 
140
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 
Checking out the Kelvin (K) rating
You can get some good buys in true-color light
bulbs on eBay. Such lights usually have a Kelvin
rating of 5,000 or higher. Kelvin (K) is the stan-
dard unit used to measure color temperature, or
the degree of warmth or coolness of a light
source. Higher Kelvin temperature produces
fuller color spectrum in the light. The higher the
K, the bluer — or cooler — the light appears.
The lower the K, the more red light is present,
and the warmer the lamp appears. Take a look
at the following chart; it gives the various Kelvin
ratings for common everyday light sources.

Tripod
A tripod is an extendable aluminum stand that holds your camera. Look for
one that has a quick release so that if you want to take the camera off the
tripod for a close-up, you don’t have to unscrew it from the base and then
screw it back on for the next picture.
The legs should extend to your desired height, lock in place with clamp-type
locks, and have a crank-controlled, geared center column so you can move
your camera up and down for different shots. Most tripods also have a pan-
ning head for shooting from different angles. You can purchase a tripod from
a camera store, or on eBay for as little as $25.
Power supplies
If you’ve ever used digital cameras, you know that they can suck the life
out of batteries faster than sugar through a five-year-old. A reliable, consis-
tent power supply is a must. You can keep the power flowing in a couple
of ways:
 Rechargeable batteries: Many specialists on eBay sell rechargeable bat-
teries and chargers. Choose quality Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) batteries
because this kind, unlike Ni-Cad (nickel cadmium) batteries, has no
memory effect. That means you don’t have to totally discharge them.
 Lithium-ion batteries: Lithium batteries are the longest-lasting and 
lightest batteries available, but they’re also expensive. Or at least they
were. Then some smart cookie figured out a way to put two batteries
into one unit; considerably cutting the price. This new battery can aver-
age 650 photos before you have to change it. The CR-V3 is a new kind
of battery that takes the place of two standard AA batteries. It is also
available in a rechargeable form, thereby extending the life even further
(and reducing your battery budget significantly).
If your eBay photo studio includes a camera on a tripod (and it should —
basics, right?), then you can use a good old-fashioned AC adapter (you know,
it’s the one that plugs into the wall) to generate low-cost power for your 
battery-powered studio gadgetry. Just be sure to get one that’s compatible
with your devices.
141
Chapter 11: Outfitting Your Studio

Props — for example, a mannequin
To take good photos, you need some props. Although you may think it strange
that a line item in your accounting program will read props, they do qualify as
a business expense. (Okay, you can put it under photography expenses — props
just sounds so Hollywood!)
How often have you seen some clothing on eBay from a quality manufacturer,
but just couldn’t bring yourself to bid more than $10 because it looked like it
had been dragged behind a car and then hung on a hanger before it was pho-
tographed? Could you see how the fabric would hang on a body? Of course
not. But take a look at Figure 11-5 — that dress looks simply fantastic, darling!
If you’re selling clothing, you’d better photograph it on a mannequin. If you
don’t want to dive right in and buy a mannequin, at least get a body form to
wear the outfit. Just search eBay for mannequin to find hundreds of hollow
forms selling for less than $20. If you sell children’s clothing, get a child’s
mannequin form as well. The same goes for men’s clothes. If worst comes to
worst, find a friend to model the clothes. There’s just no excuse for hanger-
displayed merchandise in your auctions.

Mannequin,

142
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

Marsha got her mannequin “Midge” at a department store’s liquidation sale in
Los Angeles — and paid all of $25 for her. Well, okay, maybe her face is a little
bit creepy (the solution is often to crop her head out of the photos), but she
has a great body — and everything she wears sells at a profit. Many stores
upgrade their mannequins every few years or so. If you know people who
work at a retail store, ask when they plan to sell their old mannequins; you
may be able to pick one up at a reasonable price.
Display stands, risers, and more
Jewelry doesn’t photograph well on a human being. Most people’s hands and
necks aren’t exactly works of art (that’s why there are professional “hand
models” and such). Your item will look a lot better when you display it on a
stand (see Figure 11-6) or a velvet pad. 
Figure 11-6:
Various
risers and
stands can

improve your

143
Chapter 11: Outfitting Your Studio

If you’re selling a necklace, display it on a necklace stand (or photograph it flat
using a Cloud Dome — the ultimate light-gadget for jewelry — see Chapter 14).
Marsha bought her necklace-display stand from a manufacturer but had to
wait several months to receive it. Apparently, this type of quality display
stand is made to order, so a more economical way (in both time and money!)
to search for a stand is — you guessed it — on eBay. (You’ll get it sooner and
probably cheaper.)
Risers can be almost anything stairlike that you use to prop up your item to
make it more attractive in a picture. If your riser isn’t all that attractive, put it
under the cloth you use as a background. Keep a collection of risers and
propping materials in your photo area so they’re always close at hand.
You wouldn’t believe what the back of some professional photo setups look
like. Photographers and photo stylists think resourcefully when it comes to
making the merchandise look good — from the front of the picture, anyway!
Throughout years of working with professional photographers, we’ve seen
the most creative things used to prop up items for photography:
 Bottles of mercury or (better yet) sand: Mercury is a heavy liquid metal.
A photographer Marsha once worked with used little bottles of this
stuff to prop up small boxes and other items in a picture. But mercury
is a poison, so we suggest you do your propping up with small bottles
(prescription bottles work well) filled with sand.
 Museum Gel or Quake Hold: These two products are invaluable when
you want to hold small objects like jewelry at unnatural angles for a pho-
tograph. (They’re like beeswax and clay, but cleaner.) Quake Hold is
used by the leading museums in earthquake territory to keep valuable
artifacts from careening off the table when the inevitable earthquake
occurs. The clear version, Museum Gel, is often difficult to remove from
items; we recommend using Quake Hold instead for your eBay items.
A single packet of Quake Hold (that much will last you nearly forever)
is only about $6. Although plain old clay is a cheaper alternative, it can
leave grease spots on paper and fabrics.
 un-du: If your items have stickers or sticker residue on them, the gunk
is bound to show up in the picture — and your customers won’t be too
thrilled with sticker goo on their items. Squirt on a little un-du on the
sticker area and use the included (and patented!) scraper to remove the
sticky stuff and bring back the shine. un-du is getting hard to find, so
we’ve used old-fashioned lighter fluid to accomplish the same task.
(Please be careful if you try that!)
 WD-40: Clean your item’s plastic or cellophane with WD-40 (no kidding);
unbelievably, it takes off any icky smudges. Just spray a tiny bit on
a paper towel, and use the paper towel to polish the plastic surface.
Don’t spray right on the article — it’s an oily mixture and you don’t
want accidental stains on the surrounding cardboard.
144
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

Almost any cleaning solution can help your items (sometimes even a
little 409), but use these chemicals with care so you don’t damage —
or destroy — the item while cleaning it.
 Kneaded-rubber art eraser: Keep one around to clean off small dirt
smudges on paper items. Use it just the way you did in school: rub, rub,
rub then brush off the dirt.
 Clothespins and duct tape: (You know . . . the stuff that holds the uni-
verse together.) These multipurpose items are used in many photo
shoots in some of the strangest places. For example, if your mannequin
is a few sizes too small for the dress you want to photograph, don’t pad
the mannequin; simply fold over the dress in the back and clamp the
excess material with a metal clamp or a bunch of clothespins. You can
also use a small piece of duct tape — or, better, gaffer’s tape — to hold the
fabric taut. (You can find the magic non-sticky, non-glossy gaffer’s tape
at theatrical supply stores — or inquire at your local television station
and find out where it gets its supply.)
Software
You’re also going to need some photo-editing software to use on your com-
puter to touch up your images. We love the Fast Photos program because it’s
quick to master and easy to use, but in Chapter 16, we show you some other
excellent software packages — and show you how to use them.

Chapter 12
Getting the Right Light 
(Or the Light Right)
In This Chapter
 Flashing your subject — or not
 Learning about bulbs
 Deciding what lighting works for you
 Setting up the lights
L
ighting is the key to quality pictures. As you’ve probably already discov-
ered, it can also be your greatest challenge. These days, even the least
expensive digital camera can deliver enough quality to take great pictures.
The problem we really have is with the lighting, and here’s the long and short
of it:
 Lighting is what brings out the best in your item. Look at any catalog.
When a shopper is looking at merchandise that they can’t touch or
look at up close, they must have a good photo to look at to discern
the quality of the item at hand. If you don’t show the details in your
item, chances are your item won’t sell for the highest amount 
possible. 
 Lighting can be as simple as your daughter holding a flashlight on your
item in a fully lit room to pick up extra detail while you take the picture.
(Maybe that sounds clumsy, but Marsha has lived this scenario — and
sometimes a simple solution works best.)

Chapter 11 tells you about light temperature and basic lighting setups — the
building blocks for planning your photographic lighting. In this chapter, we
show you the tools and types of lighting available, and describe how to best
use them. You’ll never really have to worry about photography’s geeky tech-
nical side if you follow the recommendations in this book. And we strongly
encourage you to read and digest the sidebar “Marsha’s philosophy of eBay
photography” to grasp the mindset that will help you crank out the right
photos.
Using the Flash
The most basic, easiest way to light your pictures is with your digital
camera’s built-in flash. It’s bright; usually color-balanced, and will illuminate
your subject. A snap (so to speak), right? Well, as is often the case in life, the
most obvious answer isn’t always the best. Using your camera’s flash can often
flash out important small details in your image by hitting them with too much
light (take a look at Figure 12-1 for a typically awful example). That sudden
burst of light can also cause some wildly nasty shadows. Hmmmmm. Is your
flash even worth using? Well, yes and (mostly) no.
148
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 
Marsha’s philosophy of eBay photography
High-end digital cameras bristle with settings,
for many technical reasons that pro photogra-
phers appreciate. The dazzling array of controls
for aperture, shutter speed, and such are for
using the camera in manual mode instead of
automatic. With study and practice, you can
make some amazing works of art with your dig-
ital camera. If you want to play with all those
buttons — when you have buckets of time —
great. But we’re running a business here . . .
Read this paragraph several times until you
commit its message to memory. Your eBay pho-
tography objective is to take the best images
humanly possible; in the shortest period of time.
And the goal of this book is to help you do that.
Too many eBay sellers spend their time shooting
works of art. A work of art is something that is
supposed to last forever. These pictures are
supposed to last for seven days. You take them
to sell your item and then you disposed of them.
Here’s the one rule to follow when photograph-
ing items for eBay: Take the best picture you
can and move on to the next item so you can list
all the items for you have for sale without taking
forever. Period.
What’s the best way to shoot for eBay? Assembly
line (Henry Ford had it right). Have everything
assembled in one area and the process can go
smoothly and quickly. This sidebar establishes
the mindset, and this chapter tells you how to
prepare your lighting to get the best picture for
the least effort.

A digital camera’s flash has several possible modes, and here are the ones
that affect your online images.
 Auto flash. Cameras today are pretty smart. They know when you need
a flash and when you don’t — at least they think they’re that smart. With
this mode on, you relinquish all judgment to the little chip inside your
camera. This means there’s a good chance that you’ll lose detail in the
shadow areas and your highlights will flash out.
 Forced flash. When you set your camera in this mode, the flash will go
off when you take a picture — even if you’re shooting in bright sun and
the camera wouldn’t ordinarily think you need a flash. Oddly enough,
that may be just when you do need a flash — overly bright outdoor
light can often cause wicked shadows. By setting the flash to go off,
you use it as a fill, illuminating shadowed areas to make a more detailed
picture. Forced flash can be a friend when shooting your pictures in
bright sun.
 No flash. This is the mode you’ll use most often. Although camera
makers try to make flash units that compliment your pictures, nobody
can anticipate every possible lighting situation. If you’ve set up special
lighting, the flash might only get in the way. Also, if you skip using the
built-in flash, you can control a bit more of what appears in the picture.

Seeing the Light about Light Bulbs
Wow. Was this whole topic an education for us! We used to think that to illu-
minate our picture setups, all we needed was a light (remember the flashlight
stunt a few paragraphs back?). But all light is not the same; the type of light
source you use can have considerable impact on how the image of your item
affects a potential customer. The sidebar “How hot is that look (in degrees
Kelvin)?” takes a look at why.
Once you’ve soaked up the available enlightenment in this chapter, you’ll be
able to select bulbs for your photo lights quickly and correctly every time.
We checked out many light bulbs and here’s what we learned.
Getting warmer with incandescent bulbs
Incandescent bulbs are your standard light bulb as invented by Thomas
Edison. Choosing would be simple if there were only one kind of incandes-
cent bulb, but there’s quite a variety.
If you’ve ever wondered what’s special about “tungsten” bulbs, the answer
is — not much. Tungsten is in nearly all incandescent bulbs; it’s the filament
that glows white-hot when the electricity passes through. No surprise that
only about 10 percent of the light they produce is in the visible spectrum —
most of the energy they give off is in infrared (that is, heat)! That’s why bulbs
are often called “hot” lights (we talk about “cold” lights later on).
The average light bulb will last about 750 to 1,000 hours with normal usage.
The heat the electricity generates causes the tungsten filament to evaporate
and deposit bits of itself on the glass (ever notice the black spots on an old
light bulb?).

How hot is that look (in degrees Kelvin)?
For a photographer, the Kelvin scale measures
how “cool” or “warm” a light source appears.
Color temperature isn’t a matter of whether a light
source will scorch your hand, but rather, what
happens to the color of the light at different levels
of energy. Any object will emit light if heated
enough; a black metal, for example changes
color as it’s heated from a cold black to a white-
hot state; as the actual temperature increases,
the color shifts from red (getting hot) to orange
to yellow (hotter) to white, and finally to a blue-
white at its hottest. But color temperature actu-
ally turns that value upside-down, essentially
evaluating light in terms of its esthetic effect:
light from the red/orange/yellow side of the spec-
trum is described as “warm” — and light at the
violet/blue end is referred to as “cool.” In prac-
tical terms, incandescent light sources provide
a “warmer” look than you get with the “cool”
(very blue-white) light of standard fluorescents.

You can find variety in incandescent bulbs (Figure 12-2 shows you an assort-
ment of incandescent bulbs — going from standard to blue photoflood):
 Standard bulb: The plain-vanilla, cheap-as-dirt bulb that you can buy
at the average grocery store is probably the worst choice to illuminate
your pictures. If you have taken online images with regular bulbs, you
may have noticed that your pictures have a yellow tinge. That tinge
takes a lot of tweaking (and time) in an image-editing program to
remove. Not good. Not good at all.
 Professional photoflood bulbs: As an incandescent bulb deteriorates
over time, it loses brightness — which is something a professional pho-
tographer can’t waste time with. Photoflood bulbs are rated in actual
Kelvin temperatures, and are guaranteed to maintain the light for the life
of the bulb. Photoflood bulbs burn at 250 or 500 watts and can be pur-
chased for under $5 each. They also come in a blue tint to produce a
variety of daylight similar to the light you’d get at 3,200 or 4,800 degrees
Kelvin. (The problem with those bulbs is that they can be rated for as
short a life as 3 hours of guaranteed color temperature.)
Speaking of temperature, those babies burn incredibly hot! Remember
that 90 percent of the bulb’s energy goes into heat — and we’re talking
about a 500-watt bulb! Eeeyow! When you put these in the stock flood-
lights, the aluminum reflectors also get very, very hot. To be honest,
we’ve found that we don’t go near most bulbs for at least an hour after
turning them off. When attempting to remove any light bulb, use a paper
towel to grasp it; never touch a potentially hot bulb with your fingers!

 General Electric Reveal bulbs: This is a new and revolutionary type of
bulb that’s physically color-corrected, using the element neodymium in
the glass to filter out the standard bulb’s yellow rays. If all you can get
hold of is a standard bulb, the GE Reveal is your best bet for your images.
It casts a very nice white light and, if you adjust your white balance just
once, you should get some very good online images.
This is a satisfactory and very cost-effective solution. You can buy a
four-pack of GE Reveal bulbs for under $5, and GE projects their stan-
dard life at 1,000 hours.
Cooling it (the light, that is) 
with fluorescent bulbs
This is a horse, er bulb, of a different color. A florescent bulb is the “cool” 
version of the light bulb; it emits much more light than heat. Common fluo-
rescent lamps are the long, tubular kind usually installed in offices, kitchens,
and convenience stores. They’re cheap to operate, but they’re also the worst
lights to use to illuminate your images (note that we’re not referring to com-
pact fluorescents — that’s an entirely different kind of light). Unless your
camera’s white-balance control has a very accurate fluorescent setting, your
images may come out with an annoying sparkly-greenish-blue tinge. There is
no camera on the market today that can reproduce colors correctly under
standard cool white fluorescent lighting. Just don’t use it.
One reason you get such lousy color from a florescent light is the way it
works: When current travels through a filament that goes from end to end
152
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

of the glass tube, it bothers the heck out of inert gases in the tube (argon and
a small amount of gaseous mercury) until they give off photons of ultraviolet
light. The UV light (which normally just hangs around the “cool” end of the
color spectrum being invisible) reacts with the white phosphor coating of the
bulb to produce bright, visible light.
 Compact fluorescent (CF): These bulbs are an economical answer to the
standard incandescent bulb. Many of the compact fluorescents have a
standard, medium-size, screw-in base so they can be used in light fix-
tures that normally take incandescents. Figure 12-3 shows an assortment
of these super CF bulbs.
The energy in compact fluorescents goes directly into light, so you
can have a way lower-wattage bulb that will produce a brighter light.
For example a 13-watt compact fluorescent bulb can be equivalent to a
60-watt incandescent bulb. It also lasts six times as long and uses less
than a quarter of the energy.
When these new designs were introduced in the early 1980s, they revolu-
tionized lighting. A variation on the fluorescent tube, compact fluorescents
work the same way, only the tube has been made smaller and folded over
in a way to make them fit into spaces designed for incandescent bulbs.

Chapter 12: Getting the Right Light (Or the Light Right)

From the reports we’ve read on the Internet, when it comes to compact
fluorescent (and especially full-spectrum compact fluorescent) bulbs, 
you really get what you pay for. Bulbs that cost a bit more will be truer
to their color rendering and color temperature, and will last as long as
they claim.
 Full-spectrum compact fluorescent bulbs: Here’s what we use for our
picture-taking. The full-spectrum light output closely matches natural
daylight. To achieve natural, balanced sunlight indoors, the light from
these bulbs has to contain a full spectrum of color — including the
infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.
One example is the Sunwave Compact fluorescent reading light (in
Figure 12-3, it’s the one on the far right). The bulb was developed with a
special phosphor blend that guarantees full-spectrum color. It will screw
into any medium size screw-in base, and has a CRI of 93, 5500° K. It only
uses 30 watts and gives brightness equal to a 150W bulb. They also have
a 10,000 hour life. Yes, they’re expensive. But they save you a ton of time
by shining the “right light” on your items.
Our tech editor replaced all the bulbs in her office with full-spectrum
compact fluorescent bulbs. By using them, she calculates that she can
save $40.61 over the life of the bulb. Her electric bills have gone down,
and she doesn’t have to worry about the “color” difference of the over-
head bulbs when shooting pictures in her office. Table 12-2 gives you a
look at the potential savings estimate.

 Halogen bulbs: These bulbs are the modern version of Edison’s incan-
descent bulb, and they last longer — 2,250 to 3,500 hours. The ones
we’ve used for eBay photography are PAR 30. They feature a parabolic
aluminized reflector (PAR) to improve the focus of the light, which makes
them look like baby-size floodlights.
These amazing little wonders (second from the right in Figure 12-3) give
off a crisp, very bright, white light — and they maintain their light output
154
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

over time without fading with age, as incandescents do. Because of this
reliability, most automobile headlights are halogen now.
Halogen lamps also use the tungsten filament (encased in a quartz enve-
lope) in a mixed krypton/xenon/halogen gas environment. (In the PAR
type, the halogen lamp is encased in an outer glass bulb). The halogen
gas performs a unique task; it actually recycles the tungsten as it deteri-
orates and the high heat redeposits it back on the filament, meaning the
bulb will last way longer! They average 2,500 to 3,000 hours.
A few warnings to heed should you plan on using halogen bulbs:
• They run hot. Don’t use them in proximity to paper, cloth or other
combustible materials that can catch fire from the heat of the bulb.
• They can break. Some halogen bulbs are very fragile. Do not drop,
crush, bend, or shake them.
• Skin oil damages them. Never touch a regular Halogen bulb with
your bare hands. Oils from your skin can lead to breakage or
shorten the life of the lamp. Use cotton gloves or a lint-free cloth
for installation and removal.
• They stay hot after you turn them off. Not only should you never
touch the lamp when it’s on, but also keep (gloved) hands off for
awhile after you’ve turned off it — it’s still hot enough to cause
serious burns.
155
Chapter 12: Getting the Right Light (Or the Light Right)
Color Rendering Index
Aside from the color-temperature measure,
there is one other standard measurement for
artificial lighting: the Color Rendering Index, or
CRI. The CRI is used by manufacturers of fluo-
rescent, metal-halide, and other non-incandes-
cent lighting equipment to describe the visual
effect of the light on colored surfaces. It shows
how a light source can affect the appearance
of an object’s colors — and how well any subtle
variations in color shades are revealed. The
higher the CRI rating is, the better its color ren-
dering ability. To put it another way, a low CRI
causes colors to appear washed out (and per-
haps even take on a different hue); a high CRI
makes all colors look natural and vibrant.
CRI describes the extent to which an artificial
light source can render true color. True color, as
seen by natural outdoor sunlight has a CRI of
100. The higher the CRI of the light source, the
“truer” the color it renders.
Here are some typical CRI indexes:
Warm White fluorescent tube
55
Cool White fluorescent tube
65
Daylight fluorescent
79
Cool White fluorescent
86
100-watt incandescent
100
Now that you’ve had a close look at color tem-
perature and Kelvin ranking, you should be an
expert. Next time you see an ad like the one for the
true-color task lamp (shown here), and you see
the phrase 95 CRI 5000° K, you’ll know what it
means. (It means you’ve got a rocking bulb for
taking pictures: nice and bright and full-spectrum).

When removing Halogen bulbs, try to hold them only by the edges and be
sure to protect your hands from the heat. Again, give bulbs at least half an
hour to cool before attempting to change the bulb.
Setting Up Your Lighting
Your lighting setup will be a highly personal thing; it depends on not only
your personal preferences, but also on what you sell. Not to worry: Here’s
where we lay out the different types of items and suggest a reasonably priced
lighting setup for each.
The one universal thing about all your lighting arrangements is the position
of your bulbs. You can get a bit fancier (depending on what the item needs
to show it to best advantage), but your basic setup should be consistent:
Camera in the center, positioned in front of your item, with two floodlights at
a 90-degree angle from each other, as in Figure 12-4.
If you don’t have two lights, another standard setup (pictured in Figure 12-5)
uses just one. If you have more than two, you can also combine the arrange-
ments shown in Figures 12-4 and 12-5 into an outstanding setup for your images.
If you don’t have (or don’t want to deal with) big floodlights because all the
items you sell are small, you can use a couple of compact-fluorescent true-
color flip lights with a photo stage, as pictured in Figure 12-6.

Shooting jewelry and coins
When it comes to really small items like jewelry and coins, we recommend
the Cloud Dome. Taking pictures with a Cloud Dome isn’t difficult — and you
can set it up anywhere. For the most natural lighting (and to add just enough
shadow), set the Cloud Dome near a window and use the ambient light. If you
need additional lighting, you can use flip lights (mentioned earlier) along with
your Cloud Dome. (For more information on the Cloud Dome, visit the manu-
facturer’s Web site at www.clouddome.com.)

Chapter 12: Getting the Right Light (Or the Light Right)

To take a picture with the Cloud Dome, follow these steps:
1. Attach your camera to the bracket on top of the Cloud Dome using the
camera’s tripod mount.
2. Select a background for your item: plain white paper, frosted
Plexiglas stands, black velvet, or whatever gets the look you want.
3. Arrange your item against the background, or put it on a riser, or both.
4. Center the dome on top of your object.
5. Set your camera to macro mode and turn off the flash.
6. View the item through your camera’s LCD screen to see whether your
item needs additional lighting. If it does, add that light!
You are now ready to take a nicely lit photograph.
Using light cubes, panels, and umbrellas
A super advantage of these photo accessories is that you can get the benefit
of true-color white light without using special bulbs. When you shine a light
through a high-quality, pure-white fabric, it changes the quality of the light
and you get a near-perfect picture — often the first time. Figure 12-7 shows
the result of using a light cube to photograph a collectible item. Depending
on what we’re shooting, we use different backgrounds in the cube. We find
that white or light gray is best for most items, and black (inside the cube) is
good for making glass and crystal stand out.

Using a mannequin for apparel shots can be a challenge (no offense, Midge)
because it’s so hard to light every part of the apparel properly. The same
problem crops up when you have to lug your lights outside to take pictures
of a car’s interior: Direct lighting will produce some really nasty, unwanted
shadows. But if you attach light-diffusing panels to your floodlights, you have
a cheap, safe way to spread your light around just right. Figure 12-8 shows an
eBay fashion photo taken with these panels.
Umbrella-style diffusers are the true professional solution for diffusing light,
but they’re expensive. By and large, you can simulate them well enough by
using the panels, the light cube, or by even by attaching a 12-inch-by-12-inch
diffusion gel filter (available at your photo dealer, or on eBay for a couple of
dollars) to your floodlight. Nothing fancy needed here; a clothespin works
fine (as in Figure 12-9). You can also do this with a piece of translucent
shower-curtain plastic — but be careful not to get it too close to your lights,
especially if you’re using special bulbs that throw off a lot of heat. You don’t
want to burn down the house when you’re taking picture!

Remember, good lighting is the key to good pictures — and consistent good
lighting can save you time. After you’ve set up your lighting — if at all 
possible — leave it alone until you finish a large group of pictures. Setting
up once and taking pictures of similar-size items can make your image 
assembly line move much faster!

T
his is the part that always amazes us: Why is it that people feel that they
need to add things to “decorate” the listing of their item for sale? Just
check eBay. Every day you can see hundreds of item’s images overshadowed
by the seller’s desire to “doll up” the picture. 
Those items rarely get the highest price they deserve. Why? Because the pur-
pose of our online images is to clearly show the item for sale — not to create
an Ansel Adams work of art.
Clean, clear pictures will get you high bids and fast Buy It Now sales. Period.
No question. No argument. You can decorate your listing with some nice
HTML (that’s what the rest of this book is all about), but your pictures need to
be no-fooling-around representations of your merchandise.
It’s easy to talk the talk, but take a look at Figures 13-1 through 13-4 for
proof of the pudding. They show you some examples from listings with
impeccable illustrations.

Here’s a quick list of really good reasons to use well-made digital images in
your auction pages:
 If you don’t have a picture, potential bidders may wonder whether you’re
deliberately hiding the item from view because you know something is
wrong with it. Paranoid? Maybe. Practical? You bet.

Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Pictures

 Fickle bidders generally don’t even bother reading an item description if
they can’t see the item. (Must be all those years of TV, right?)
 Taking your own pictures shows that you have the item in your posses-
sion. Many scam artists take images from a manufacturer’s Web site to
illustrate their bogus sales on eBay. Why risk being suspect? Snap a
quick picture of the real thing!
 Everyone’s doing it — and in this one case (whatever your mom used
to say), that’s a good reason to do it too. I hate to pressure you, but digi-
tal images are the custom on eBay; if you’re not using them, you’re not
reaching the widest possible number of people who would bid on your
item. From that point of view, you’re not doing the most you can to serve
your potential customers’ needs. Hey, fads are driven by conformity.
You may as well use them to your advantage.
You can successfully use a scanner to get quality images of many paper items.
I use mine as a quick way to get those images up and online — and it works
like gangbusters!
Getting the Cleanest Image Possible
Setting up your merchandise isn’t always an easy proposition. I often use
Quake Hold or clay to balance an item so I can get a special angle to display
in the listing.
You may need to shoot your item from several different angles to show it
fully — not only to show off its hallmarks, but also to acknowledge its chips
and flaws. The more you show, the better!
Point-and-shoot may be okay for a group shot at a historical monument, but
illustrating your listing is a whole different idea. Remember the importance of
setting the White Balance for your images, and set it every time you begin a
merchandise photo session.
Checking your white balance
Nope, this isn’t about untangling errant sheets in the washer. The white 
balance is when a camera adjusts itself to the ambient light so it can give
accurate and true color-rendition to the image of your merchandise. As I rec-
ommend, you need to have a camera that can perform a custom white balance
adjustment. If it can’t, you probably won’t be able to capture very accurate
164
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

colors — especially if you’re taking pictures of your items against a white
background. Adjusting the white balance is incredibly crucial because
if it isn’t adjusted you’ll likely end up with all kinds of color variations.
Your camera will have a list of presettings you can select — usually including
incandescent, twilight, fluorescent, sunlight, cloudy daylight, and shade — all
of which have different color temperatures. (For more about color tempera-
ture, see Chapter 11.)
If your camera’s white balance has a manual setting, you should use it to get
the best quality of white balance reading. Study the manual to learn how to
set up your camera to perform a custom white-balance calibration. Here’s
how it generally goes:
1. Set up your picture and when everything is ready to go (including light-
ing), focus your camera on the merchandise. 
2. Get a piece of white paperboard and put it next to the item.
3. Focus your camera on the center of the white board. If focusing is a prob-
lem, you can put a business card next to the white board and focus on the
writing that appears on it — and remove the card prior to performing
the calibration.
Using the Timer shooting mode
Sometimes it’s very difficult to focus on an item — especially if your camera
is in macro mode — unless you hold the camera very, very still. Keeping your
camera still while shooting your picture will yield the best results. That’s easy
to say — but all I have to do is try to hold the camera steady, and my hands
start to shake like I’m in an earthquake! Luckily my new Sony camera has and
“anti-shake” feature, but most cameras in use now don’t. Anything you can do
to lessen camera shake will improve the quality of your image.
Tripods, copy stands, or even stacks of books may come in handy here as firm,
hands-off places from which to aim your camera at the item you want to shoot.
But there’s also the matter of tripping the shutter without jiggling the camera . . . 
This is where you can use your camera’s timer! (See, it has uses other than
giving you a chance to jump into the family Christmas card picture — after
you’ve composed and focused the shot on your spouse’s nose, of course.)
Mount your camera on a tripod or on a Cloud Dome, select the Timer mode,
and take the picture. Your camera will delay taking the picture for approxi-
mately ten seconds after you activate the timer. Plenty of time to get out of
the way.
165
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Pictures

Here’s a trick that will work for some cameras: When you want to speed up your
camera’s timer, tap the shutter button twice. Depending on the camera, this
move may drop the countdown timer to two or three seconds. The countdown
duration can also be selected in the shooting menu (consult your camera’s
documentation to see how to access that menu).
Shooting for Online: Dos and Don’ts
When it comes to capturing the best pictures for your listings, there’s nothing
like a few basic photographic guidelines. Here are some that can give you
noticeably better results:
 Do take the picture of your item outside, in filtered daylight, whenever
possible. That way the camera can catch all possible details and color.
If you can’t take your images during the day, use a good set of floodlights,
mounted on clamps or stands.
 Do consider investing in quality studio tools: a photo stage, a Cloud Dome,
a photo cube.
 Don’t use fancy backgrounds; they distract viewers from your item.
Put small items on a neutral-colored, nonreflective cloth; put larger
items in front of a neutral-colored wall or curtain. You’ll crop out almost
all the background anyway when you prepare the picture on your com-
puter before you upload the image.
 Do avoid getting yourself in the photo by shooting your pictures from
an angle. If you see your reflection in the item, move around till you 
“disappear,” focus from right there, and try again.
One of my favorite eBay pictures featured a piece of fine silver. Now, silver
and reflective items are hard to photograph because they reflect every-
thing in the room in their reflection — and when the lady selling the
piece on eBay had her husband take the shot, there he was. She got
around it with a little humor, explaining (in her item description) that the
man reflected in the silver coffeepot was not included in the final deal!
To avoid having this problem reflect oddly on you (sorry about that),
take pictures of silvery objects in a photo cube.
 Do use extra lighting. You can do this by using your camera’s Flash
mode judiciously (see Chapter 12), or with extra photo lighting on
stands. Use extra lighting even when you’re taking the picture outside;
the idea is to put some fill light on the item to make shadowed spots
easier to see.
166
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

 Don’t get so close to the item that the flash washes out (overexposes)
the image. The easiest way to figure out the best distance is by trial and
error. Start close and keep moving farther away until you get the results
you want.
 Do take two or three acceptable versions of your image. You can choose
the best one later on your computer.
 Do take a close-up or two of detailed areas that you want buyers to
see (in addition to a wide shot of the entire item), if your item relies
on detail.
 Do make sure that your items are clean. Cellophane on boxes can get
nasty-looking, clothing can get linty, and all merchandise can get dirt
smudges. Not only will your items photograph better if they’re clean,
they’ll sell better, too.
 Don’t get carried away and spend too much time on any one picture
(unless the item will be selling for thousands of dollars). Remember that
time is money!
 Do make sure that you focus the camera; nothing is worse than a blurry
picture. If your camera is a fixed-focus model (it can’t be adjusted), get
only as close as the manufacturer recommends. Automatic-focus cameras
measure the distance and change the lens setting as needed. But just
because a camera has an autofocus feature doesn’t mean that its pic-
tures automatically come out crisp and clear. Low light, high moisture,
and other factors can easily blur an image. Double-check the picture
before you use it.
Some eBay creeps, whether out of laziness or deceit, steal images from other
eBay members. They simply make a digital copy of the image and use it in their
own auctions. This is not only rude, but unethical (you put the work in, and
besides, the copied image doesn’t represent their actual items). This pilfering
has happened to me on several occasions. To prevent picture-snatching, you
can add your user ID to all your photos. The next time somebody lifts one of
your pictures, it has your name on it. If you’re familiar with adding HTML code
to your auctions (and you should be by the time you finish reading this book),
check out the simple Java code on our Web site (www.coolebaytools.com)
or in Chapter 6 that you can use to insert in your auction descriptions to pre-
vent scurrilously lazy users from stealing your images.
Lifting another seller’s photos is against eBay’s rules, so be sure to report the
photo-thieving seller to eBay’s Security Center at 
http://pages.ebay.com/securitycenter/
167
Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Pictures

Avoid using incandescent or fluorescent lighting to illuminate the photos you
take. Incandescent lighting tends to make items look yellowish, and fluores-
cent lights lend a bluish tone to your photos. One exception is GE Reveal
incandescent bulbs, which throw a good natural light. Halogen lights give a
nice bright white, but they also have a tendency to get very hot! (For more
about why light works this way, have a squint at Chapter 12.)
Patti & Marsha’s Gallery of Horrors
This section shows you a bunch of big-time don’ts. We’ve seen images like
these all over eBay at one time or another.
Horror #1
Figure 13-5 shows a nice item, but the picture suffers from two major flaws:
 A glare from the camera’s flash shows in the cellophane on the item.
You can avoid the glare-spot by turning the item slightly at an angle so
the flash bounces away from you rather than back at the camera. 
 The price sticker is smack on the front of the item. Often eBay sellers
buy things for resale that already have stickers in place. Be a pro and
use a commercial product (see Chapter 11) to remove stickers.
Horror #2
Don’t dress your picture with props to decorate the scene. Your photo
should be a crisp, clean image of the product you’re selling, and only that.

Horror #3
I never knew how much colorful upholstery people had in their homes. I’ve
seen items photographed on plaid, floral, and striped fabrics (see Figure 13-7).
It’s a distraction from your item. Don’t do it.

Chapter 13: Setting Up Your Pictures

Horror #4
I’m sure the item in the box shown in Figure 13-8 is desirable, but who can
make that judgment without seeing the item? Take the item out of the box.
If the box is a crucial part of the deal (as in collectibles), be sure to mention
that the box is included in the sale.
Sometimes not removing an item from the box (to maintain its status as mint
or new) is an important selling point. If you can’t open the box without ruin-
ing the value of the item, pull in for a macro close up and photograph the
item at an angle so that your lights won’t glare on the cellophane or other
packaging. When you have a quantity of the item, bite the bullet and open
one up for demo purposes. A good picture gets you higher bids, and perhaps
that loss of one item will be made up by the higher bids on the sales with
good pictures.
Horror #5
Can you say close-up? Figure 13-9 shows a common error made by many sell-
ers: The item is adrift in the wide-open spaces. Use the zoom on your camera
to fill the frame with a full picture of your item. Draw your camera close to
Figure 13-8:

the item so the prospective customer can see some detail. Don’t just rely on
cropping the picture in an image-editing program; that only makes the image
smaller.

Special-Situation Photography
In This Chapter
 Photographing jewelry and coins
 Selling fashion through photos
 Driving home the deal: automotive photography
 Scanning paper goods
U
nfortunately, all items are not the same under the lights: You are going
to have to make some special accommodations when it comes to pho-
tographing certain types of items. It really is a drag for those of us who will
sell anything and everything on eBay; we have to have a bit more knowledge
(and tools) to keep ahead of the competition that sells in each category. We’ll
go over a few of the more common tricks of the trade.
Marsha has been selling on eBay since 1997, and thought she was pretty good
at showing off and selling her wares. But then she purchased a small lot of
Morgan silver dollars to resell. No problem. She figured she’d just take her
standard digital picture and sell away. Oops, not so fast. The first pictures of
the coins bore only the slightest resemblance to the actual coins. The digital
pictures made the beautiful silver coins look gold! Eeyow!
Then came her next challenge: photographing some silvertone and goldtone
costume jewelry. The setup — with its perfect positioning, beautiful lighting,
and black velvet jewelry pads — looked stunning. The pictures should have
been perfect. But NO: Silvertone looked gold, and goldtone looked silver.
What’s the deal?
The deal is lighting — specifically, the need for ambient lighting. Marsha used
to work with catalog photographers who took pictures of jewelry, and she
remembered the elaborate setup they used to produce the sparkling images
you see in the ads. Okay, maybe most of us can’t recreate the experts’ silk
tents, minimalist lighting, and multiple light flashes per exposure — but we
can still set up for some great-looking images that do justice to our wares.
That’s why this chapter shows you how to diffuse, and how to take advantage
of the ambient light you have at home.

Photographing Jewelry and Coins
The first time we all figure out that there must be a “trick” to photography is
when, as sellers, we try to photograph coins or jewelry for online sale. The
novice photographer is, for the most part, totally floored in this situation.
Several things become apparent right away:
 It’s almost impossible to photograph any form of metal in its native
color — silver looks gold — and gold looks silver.
 It’s impossible to photograph the patina (finish) of any metal accurately.
 Gems will often look muddy and pearls will often white out.
 Detail in coins may be too strong or too light to show up to best advantage.
 You may have horrendous shadows.
And that’s the short list of why this type of photography will challenge even
the most seasoned eBay photographer. So this chapter offers a few fixes,
ranging from the most economical (and unfortunately still the most difficult),
to the expensive. At that end of the spectrum, you wind up investing in a seri-
ous piece of equipment — but at least the equipment will last you forever.
Take the pictures outdoors
I know this is going to sound kind of hokey, but most “necessity is the mother
of invention” solutions are hokey, so bear with me. Here are the prehistoric-
and-cheap-outdoor-photo-studio details:
1. Go outside in bright sunlight with your item and a white piece of card-
board to use as your background.
2. Arrange your items on the cardboard so they’re ready to photograph.
3. Have a friend hold an old white sheet (the older and thinner, the
better) between your item setup and the sun.
That way the sunlight has to travel through the sheet, which cuts down
on direct sunshine, diffuses the light, and cuts out harsh shadows. (If
you don’t have a friend to help out, tie the sheet to something stable and
drape it over your shoulder — yes, Marsha has actually done this —
then hold really still while the shutter clicks . . .)
4. Turn off your camera’s flash and take the picture in the ambient light
illuminating your item.
With any luck, you’ll find that the thin-old-white-sheet a fast, cheap way to filter
the sunlight and reduce the glare and shadows. This system really does work,
but we guarantee after doing it long enough, you’re gonna want to upgrade!

Scanning the small stuff
We know that it’s hard to believe, but even as a beginner, you can actually scan
your items on your scanner — and get good images you can use! Scanning an
item is far faster than taking the time to set up, take the picture and down-
load it to your computer. Marsha scans a good many of her paper items (and
more) in her HP All-In-One that sits on the side of her desk. The All-In-One is
her copier, fax, scanner and part-time printer — and it was purchased for
about $200. She used to do all her coins and jewelry that way, but found she
was spending a bit too much time in her image-editing program to get ’em to
look right, and that’s a no-no for a Power Seller. She still uses the scanner
now and then — mainly because it’s easy! If it fits on the scanner — she’ll try
to scan it first rather than taking a picture.
Figure 14-1 shows you a quick and easy scan that was taken of an expensive
gold metal belt. It’s amazing how well it turned out.
Next is a picture from auctions by Cardking4 on eBay. This is a proof set of
coins. They are encased in plastic (which is why they look a tad hazy). If you
took the picture with improper lighting, it would be a nightmare — consider-
ing the amount of glare you’d get from the plastic case!

Here are the steps you need to follow for scanning:
1. Clean your scanner glass. Magnified on a scanner, nothing looks
grosser than a hair or an icky piece of dust.
2. Cover your now-clean scanner glass with a plastic page protector from
the office-supply store. Any piece of crystal-clear plastic will do — the
point is not to scratch up the glass.
3. For jewelry, use a jeweler’s cloth to bring the piece to it most shining
glory. Please leave the coins alone — cleaning only brings down the
value!
4. Arrange your jewelry or coins on the scanner (over the plastic 
protector).
5. Before you bring down the lid, place a small object on the glass so as
to wedge the scanner in an open position so the cover doesn’t squish
your layout.
6. Lay a background over your item and a cloth to prevent light from
leaking in around the side.
We know this seems like a huge hassle, but it really isn’t. You’ll get some per-
fectly good images to use in your listings. 
Although scanning works well, you still may have problems in getting the
right colors. So if you’re in the coin or jewelry business in earnest, it’s time to
climb up to the next step.
Going pro with the Cloud Dome
Ambient light, light that occurs naturally, is the best light for photographing
many types of items (especially shiny items). Problems start when you use
flash or flood lighting alone (without a Cloud Dome) for pictures of metallic
objects, Common lighting problems that affect the quality of your pho-
tographs include shiny spots from reflections (off walls and ceilings), washed
out areas from the glare of the lights and loss of proper color. 
Enter the Cloud Dome to offer your at-home photos the ability to take advan-
tage of natural, ambient light. The Cloud Dome looks like a giant bowl that
you place upside-down over the object you want to photograph. This bowl
evenly diffuses ambient room light over the surface area of the object. This
way, you can produce quality digital images in average room lighting.
A fellow eBay University instructor introduced Marsha to the Cloud Dome —
it’s an amazing tool. You can purchase the Cloud Dome and its accessories at
many professional camera shops, from the Web site at www.clouddome.com,
or (you guessed it) on eBay.
177
Chapter 14: Special-Situation Photography

Shooting pictures with the Cloud Dome
The Cloud Dome looks like a giant inverted salad bowl with a camera mount
attached. Figure 14-4 shows a Cloud Dome being set up to photograph jew-
elry. Follow these steps to take a picture with the dome: 
1. Attach your camera to the Cloud Dome’s mount with the lens posi-
tioned so that it peers into the hole at the top of the dome.
2. Place your item on top of a contrasting background.
See the sidebar “Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures,” later in this chap-
ter for ideas on choosing a background.
3. Place the dome with camera attached over your item.
4. Check the item’s position through your camera’s viewfinder or 
LCD screen. 
If it’s not in the center, center it. If you feel you still need added lighting
to bring out a highlight, position another lamp outside the dome.
5. Focus your camera and shoot the picture.
The ideal subjects for Cloud Dome photos
Many items benefit from being photographed through a Cloud Dome, especially:
 Jewelry: We’ve found that taking pictures with the Dome keeps the gold
color gold and the silver color silver. Also, using the Cloud Dome helps
your camera pick up details such as engraving and the metal surround-
ing cloisonné work. It also gives pearls their unique luster and soft
reflection, as in Figure 14-5. Much of the detail that the Cloud Dome
helps capture can be washed out when you apply enough light to take
the picture without it.

 Gems and stones: We’ve seen some beautiful pictures taken of gems and
stones with the Cloud Dome. You may also want to focus a floodlight or
lamp on the outside of the dome for extra sparkle. Take a look at Figure
14-6: on the left is a lovely ruby-slippers pin photographed under the
Cloud Dome. On the right is the same pin, taken without the dome —
notice the glare.
 Coins and stamps: The Cloud Dome allows you to hold the camera
steady for extreme close-ups — and when you photograph coins, it
helps you leave out any coloration that is not on the coins. For small
detailed items such as coins and stamps, the Cloud Dome helps you
achieve sharp focus and true color.

Chapter 14: Special-Situation Photography

 Holographic or metallic-accented items: If you’ve ever tried to photo-
graph collector cards, you know that the metal accents glare and the
holograms are impossible to capture. 
Also, the glossy coatings confuse the camera’s light sensors, causing
overexposed highlights. Check out the before-and-after images in Figure
14-7 and see how clear the hologram on the credit card appears after
shooting through the Cloud Dome.
 Reflective objects: Items like silverware — or even computer chips —
reflect a lot of light when lit properly for photos. The Cloud Dome dif-
fuses the light so that the pictures become clear. Check out the before
and after in Figure 14-8.

Selling Fashion through Pictures
A simple truth of eBay: Nothing gets less bids than a photograph of a pair of
jeans (or a dress) folded up on a table (or hanging on a hanger). Take a look
at Figure 14-9 and look at the Gallery thumbnails. Notice which dresses look
desirable and which seem less so. (Some droop from hangers — but that
cocktail party dress looks like it’s already at a party!)
Gathering fashion photography tools
Photographing fashion right takes a little time, but the right tools make the
project easier. Here’s a list of some of the items you’ll need when photograph-
ing clothing.
 Mannequin body double: You don’t want to deal with supermodels and
their requirements for non-fat, sugar-free vanilla lattes, so you have to
find someone who will model the garments and not give you any grief.

Tips for taking Cloud Dome pictures
Surprisingly, there’s very little learning curve to
using a Cloud Dome. (Hey, how about those
simple steps? Doesn’t get much simpler than
that.) What may take you more time is discov-
ering the tips and tricks that help you achieve
professional-looking results. Not to worry:
Reading this section will kick-start your discov-
ery process. While that’s going on, here are a
few things to keep in mind when taking photos
with the Cloud Dome:
 Focus, focus: Due to the focus limitations of
many of today’s digital cameras, we found it
best to use the Cloud Dome with the exten-
sion collar (often sold along with the dome),
which allows you to put your camera 17
inches away from the item you’re pho-
tographing on a flat surface.
 Close-ups: When attempting macro(extreme
close-up) photography, the Cloud Dome
holds your camera still while shooting the
picture. If you prefer, after you’ve centered
your item, stand away use your camera’s
self-timer to take the picture.
 Fine upstanding items: If your item is verti-
cal and doesn’t lend itself to being pho-
tographed flat, use the optional angled
extension from Cloud Dome, which allows
you to shoot the item from an angle instead
of from the top. An angled collar is also sold
separately, or in a package deal with a
Cloud Dome.
 Keeping background where it belongs:
When selecting a background for your item,
choose a contrasting background that
reflects the light properly for your item.
Make it a solid color; white is always safe
and black can add dramatic highlights.

Full-body mannequins can be purchased on eBay for about $200. Marsha
bought Midge the Mannequin from a local store that was updating their
mannequins. Major department stores often liquidate their display mer-
chandise in auctions, so keep your eyes peeled in your local newspaper
for auctions of store fixtures.
Keep in mind that you needn’t spend a mint on a brand-new model. If
your mannequin is used and has a few paint chips — so what?
Following are some less expensive alternatives to a mannequin:
• Molded body form: Before you decide to jump in with both feet,
you might want to try using a hanging body form. These are
molded torsos that have a hanger at the top. You can find molded
styrene forms on eBay for as little as $20. If you decide to stay in
the apparel-vending business, you can always upgrade to a full-size
mannequin.
• Dressmaker’s adjustable form: You can also use a dressmaker’s
form to model your eBay clothing. The best part about using these is
that you can adjust the size of the body to fit your clothing. You can
often find new or good-condition used ones on eBay for under $100.
 Vertical photo lights on stands: Check Chapter 12 to get the lowdown
on lighting your apparel. Here’s a quick description of what you need. To
light your merchandise, you’ll do best to invest in some floodlights —
and to prevent glare you could use some diffusing elements. You don’t
have to spend a mint, but (as you’ll see when you start taking pictures),
the little flash on your camera just can’t bring out the really good parts
of your apparel.
You may want to prevent the flash on your camera from going off alto-
gether when you take pictures of clothes; too much light coming from
the front will wash out the detail in the fabric.
 Clothespins: To fit your clothing on the mannequin, use clothespins to
take up any slack in the garment (be sure to place the clothespins where
camera won’t see them). Before you think I’m crazy, I’ll have you know
that clothespins were used in almost every apparel photo that I’ve par-
ticipated in. Think about it: The clothing you’re selling will come in dif-
ferent sizes and may not always hang right on your mannequin.
Cleaning and pressing essentials
Before you photograph your clothing items, make sure each one imparts the
image you want your buyers to see. For example, remove any loose threads
and lint that may have accumulated on the fabric.
183
Chapter 14: Special-Situation Photography

Have the following items handy to help you with the cleaning and pressing
chores:
 Garment rack: When you unpack your merchandise from the carton it
was shipped in, the items can look pretty ragged. And if you’ve purchased
some hanging merchandise and it’s in tip-top shape, you’ll want to keep it
that way. Hanging the merchandise on a garment rack (see Figure 14-11)
keeps it fresh-looking so it looks great when you get ready to ship.
 Steamer: Retail stores, clothing manufacturers, and drycleaners all use
steamers. Why? Because steaming the garment with a steam wand is
kinder to the fabric and takes wrinkles out in a hurry. Steam penetrates
the fabric (not crushing it, as does ironing) and seems to make the fabric
look better than before.
Steaming is also five times faster than ironing — and not as backbreaking —
which is why it’s truly the professional’s choice. Steaming garments is a
breeze; see for yourself in Figure 14-12.
A handheld travel steamer will work well enough if you’re selling only
one or two apparel items a month — and that’s fine for beginners, but
the time can add up. While a professional-style steamer gets a garment
done in a minute or two, you might have to work on the same garment
with a travel steamer for 15 minutes to get usable results. If you’re think-
ing about selling any significant quantity of clothes on eBay, then a 
professional-style, roll-base steamer is what you should look for.
Figure 14-11:

Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

As Marsha says, “I use a Jiffy Steamer that I’ve had for quite a while. 
(I even bought it on eBay and got a great deal.) It’s the same kind they
use in retail stores, only slightly smaller.”
 Dryel: This is a popular, reasonably priced, home-dry-cleaning product
you use in your dryer. Dryel can be used with almost any type of gar-
ment (be sure to double-check the packaging before you use it). After
going through a Dryel treatment, clothes come out of the dryer sweet
and clean. The starter kit even comes with a spot remover. You can buy
Dryel at your local supermarket.
According to eBay rules, all used clothing must be cleaned before it’s
sold on the site. Even if the vintage garment you have up for sale is
clean, it can always benefit by a roll in the dryer with Dryel. New gar-
ments, too, benefit; Dryel removes any smells that have clung to the gar-
ment during its travels.
 Spot cleaners: We recommend that you use spot cleaners only if you
know what you’re doing. Some really great ones out there will remove a
small spot, but you’d best practice on items that you’re not selling first.
Turning Cars into Dollars
Cars can turn into quite a few dollars. Based on sales in the first quarter of 2005,
$12.9 billion- (that’s with a b, followed by nine zeros)-worth of merchandise

Chapter 14: Special-Situation Photography

sold in a year on the eBay Motors site. Is that huge enough to make you want
to sell a vehicle? We’d think so, but photographing cars for eBay auctions is a
bit . . . involved. Typically a successful vehicle auction shows at least ten pic-
tures of the vehicle:
 Pictures of the car from all four sides
 The driver’s-side interior through open door
 Passenger’s-side interior with open door
 Driver’s side of the vehicle from the back seat
 Close-up of the dashboard
 Back-seat photo taken from the front seat
 Pictures of tires and fenders (make sure that all are visible)
 All documentation that comes with the car
 Picture of the engine
Take your pictures outside, on a nice sunny day. A car is one thing that looks
good with a reflection! To see what we mean, take a look at these shots (Figures
14-13 through 14-16) of a used Chrysler Town and Country Van sold by e.vehi-
cles. They’re fine examples of some types of images you’ll need if you’re going
to sell a car successfully on eBay. You can see why John Rickmon, the owner of
e.vehicles, has been making a good living selling automobiles on eBay for many
years — as these pictures attest, he really knows his stuff!

Steaming hot tips
Keep these tips in mind when steaming the
clothes you sell on eBay:
 Always keep the steam head in an upright
position so the condensation inside the
hose drains back into the steamer.
 Run the steam head lightly down the fabric.
 Don’t let the steam head come directly in
contact with velvet or silk; otherwise you
may spot the fabric.
 Steam velvet (or any fabric with a pile) from
the reverse side.
 Hang pants by the cuff when steaming.
 Heavy fabrics may respond better to steam-
ing from the underside of the fabric.
 When you’re through steaming your clothes
for eBay, try steaming your mattresses and
furniture. Steaming has been proven to kill a
majority of dust mites and their accompa-
nying nastiness.

Chapter 15
Getting the Pictures from 
Your Camera to eBay
In This Chapter
 Squeezing the pictures out of your camera
 Naming your images
 Uploading images to a server
 Uploading and managing images on eBay
W
e know that some of you may look at this chapter and wonder why 
we wasted the space, but we also know two of the most common
questions we hear:
“How do I get my pictures up on eBay?”
and
“How do I get my pictures out of my camera?”
So if you’ve ever asked yourself those questions, look to this chapter for the
answers. Not only do we guide you step by step — until you’re an expert
uploading your pictures to eBay — but we also advise you on best practices
for storing and safeguarding any pictures you take.
A good way to start developing your picture-handling skills is by understand-
ing how your camera stores its images. And then you’ll recognize that storing
your images in the camera is a waste of precious picture-taking space. But
never fear; this chapter shows you how to get those pictures out of your
camera, store them on your computer, and safeguard your artistry with regu-
lar appropriate backups.

Finding the Pictures in Your Camera
As we discuss in Chapter 10, digital cameras can store your images on vari-
ous types of removable media. The industry refers to these media types as
flash media. Why, you ask? We hear that the flash part has something to do
with how quickly the media can be erased, but we advise you to just hum
along and go with it. To recap the media types, you can find Smart Digital,
Secure Digital, Memory Sticks, Compact Flash, DVDs, and floppy disks all
used in digital cameras. And you also discover that the storage media comes
in lots of sizes — all the way up to 1GB (gigabyte) of storage space!
Your camera’s manufacturer decides which media type your camera takes
but the size of the storage space you choose is up to you. Most newer cam-
eras also have an internal memory where they can store images. So you’ve
got plenty of ways to store pictures and three ways to retrieve them. We go
over your options, one by one.
Your camera names your images in a random manner — and in a language
that makes sense only to your camera. The language dubs your images with
names like MVC-015F.jpg or DSCN0237.jpg, and odds are that those strange
names will make recognizing your images of choice difficult (to say the least).
So getting the images onto your computer where you can view them — and
rename them into something more sensible — becomes quite important.
Retrieving images from 
your camera’s memory
Surprisingly, some digital cameras can even store your pictures without
removable media! Marsha (who’s been known to be a bit ditzy at times)
bought a new Nikon digital camera and started snapping away happily until
she realized when hadn’t inserted a memory card! Yikes, had she lost all her
images? Nope, most of the newer cameras have their own internal memory
that can hold many images in temporary storage. This memory is also useful
when you want to do some in-camera photo editing. (See Chapter 16 for info
on how to do this.)
You can transfer images held in your camera’s internal memory to your com-
puter through a direct cable connection. In some cases, the camera has a dock-
ing station (as is the case with the Nikon Cool-Station or the Kodak EasyShare).
Kodak has been the leader in offering cameras that depend on a docking sta-
tion to retrieve the images (see Figure 15-1). With its cameras, Kodak includes
its own EasyShare software, which makes downloading and editing images in
one place uber-easy. The camera dock connects to your computer and allows
you to download pictures with the push of a button. Once the images are on
your computer, you can edit and rename them easily.
190
Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

Older digital cameras come with a cable that connects directly to your com-
puter’s USB port. When you connect your camera and computer via the
cable, your computer treats the camera as if it were a hard drive. You can
then pull up a folder window and download the images as if you were copying
files from one drive to another. EasyShare software works on PCs or MACs.
On a PC running Windows XP, the process goes something like this:
1. Right-click in your computer’s My Pictures folder and selecting New➪
Folder from the resulting menu.
2. Type a logical name for your new folder (something like My Camera)
when prompted and click OK.
3. Plug your camera’s cable into the computer’s USB port.
If you’re lucky, your computer has the USB port on the front. After you
make the connection, your computer should confirm that a new device
is attached to your computer and will ask what you’d like to do, as
shown in Figure 15-2.
4. Click a folder that selects your camera as a device. When you see the
memory folder in your camera (the folder’s name depends on the type
of camera you have), select the option to Open Folder and View Files.
Selecting this option allows your computer to access the memory in
your camera.

We prefer to view the files in a folder before doing anything to them —
and we suggest this strategy for preparing to transfer your image files
because it’s as a good way to organize them prior to transferring!
5. Click individual files, Ctrl+click to select multiple files, or Ctrl+A to
select all files in the folder.
6. Drag the selected file or files over to the My Camera folder on your
computer.
Alternatively, you can right-click and choose Copy from the resulting
menu to copy all the highlighted files. Then right-click on your My
Camera folder and choose Paste. In either case, the images files will be
copied to your computer.
You can create subfolders in your My Camera folder to store images from dif-
ferent photo shoots. You can also (as we do) have separate folders — with
names like Jewelry, Shoes, and Collectibles — for storing your sales items by
category.
Mounting the flash media card
To retrieve the digital pictures from your flash media, you first need to find the
media in your camera. Think back to where you found a tiny trap door in your
camera — the one you opened when you put the media card in the camera in
the first place. When you’ve scratched your head a few times and found the
trap door, open it and remove the media card, as shown in Figure 15-3.
Figure 15-2:

(such as a

to do.

Part III: Turning Pictures into Dollars 

When you pull out the camera’s media card, you’ve got a handful of pictures
in a tiny piece of plastic. What to do now? If your computer doesn’t have a
bay of media card readers, you may need to go out and buy a media reader. A
media reader is a small, portable device that sports slots for many types of
flash media (as shown in Figure 15-4). If you need to buy one, we recommend
that you get a media reader that reads as many different media types as pos-
sible. That way, when something goes wrong (you know it will) and the new
camera you have to buy uses different media, your media reader can still
have you covered.
After you find a place to stick the card that will permit your computer to read
it, stick it there, and a small window — similar to the one shown in Figure
15-2 — should pop up. You can follow the same procedure to extract files
from the camera’s media card as you would for getting pictures from the
camera’s memory (see the section “Retrieving images from your camera’s
memory,” earlier in this chapter). Unless your camera comes with some fancy
downloading software, the procedure to copy images onto your computer
works the same in either case.

Chapter 15: Getting the Pictures from Your Camera to eBay

Removing the media
No, you don’t just yank the camera’s media card out of your computer when
you’re through copying over the files. (Okay, we admit to doing so several
times ourselves. But we felt awful about it.)
If you don’t follow your computer’s unmounting procedure, it’s very possible
that you can mung up the files on your media card so the pictures residing on
it become unreadable — potentially a very, very bad thing. You never know
when you might need a backup copy of an image — which you won’t have
until you backup your images elsewhere (for instance, on a CD).
For Windows XP users, it’s best to look in the lower-right corner of your
taskbar at the bottom of your screen to find a small icon like the one shown
in the margin. If you don’t see this Safely Remove Hardware icon, click the
chevron-shaped icon to reveal your hidden icons. When you see the right
one, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the Safely Remove Hardware icon.
A small list (such as the one shown in Figure 15-5) appears.
2. Click to highlight the media you want to remove.
Your computer will chug and grind a bit, and soon a bubble appears to
let you know it’s okay to remove your flash media.

3. Remove the media from your computer’s slot and insert it back in
your camera’s little trap door.
Uploading Your Images to a Server
Unless you use eBay’s Picture Services (see the upcoming section, “Uploading
your picture to eBay”), you will need to upload your images to a server some-
where on the Internet. By doing so, your images will have an address, or URL,
which you insert into your HTML coding or on eBay’s sell your item form. This
address allows the eBay Web site to display the picture in your listings. To get
such an address for your pictures, you have several options:
 Your ISP (Internet service provider): All the big ISPs — AOL, AT&T,
Road Runner, and Earthlink — give you space to store your Internet
stuff. You’re already paying a monthly fee to an ISP, and you can park
pictures there at no extra charge.
 An image-hosting Web site: Web sites that specialize in hosting pictures
are popping up all over the Internet. Some charge a small fee; others are
free. The upside here is that these specialized sites usually have upload-
ing software built in, which makes them extremely easy to use.
 Your server: If you have your own server (those of you who do know
who you are), you can store those images in your own home base.
To many eBay users, uploading pictures to space provided by their ISPs
seems to remain a major mystery. And so many users are still convinced that
they have to pay for an image-hosting service — but that’s rarely the case
these days.
Using your free ISP space
Most major ISPs give you a minimum of 5MB of space to put a personal home
page on the Internet. You can usually store your images for your eBay sales
there — unless your provider has some strict rules about not doing that (it’s
a good idea to check first).

Name size does matter
After you get your digital images onto your com-
puter, you might want to take a quick look at
them and then name them appropriately. You
can also use this quick-look time to delete the
truly awful pictures with those random, letter-
and-number-based nightmare names before
you rename the keepers. Go to the folder that
holds your images, and if you’re using Windows
XP, choose View➪Filmstrip to get a display sim-
ilar to the one shown in the sidebar figure.
Viewing your images in the filmstrip mode gives
you a good idea of how they came out.
Going with our For Dummies philosophy of
naming a subfolder with the category of the
items in it, we usually name our images so 
we know exactly what the image portrays —
without having to open it. For example, we might
name the image in Figure 15-3 pearl_cz_
earring.jpg.
Here’s an important thing to keep in mind: Some
file-naming conventions apply specifically to
files that will be used on the Internet. Although
your computer (MAC or PC) may permit other
naming options, the interoperable nature of the
Internet (everything has to work with everything
else) means following this short list of rules:
 Use only letters, numbers, underscore (_),
and hyphen (-) as characters in filenames.
 Leave no spaces between characters.
 Use mostly lowercase letters; uppercase
letters may be used to distinguish words, for
example, STBirthdayParty.jpg.
 When separating words, use the under-
score mark (_), as in green_earring.jpg.
 Use a period (.) only to separate the exten-
sion from the rest of the filename, as in
dome.jpg. 
 Use a maximum of 16 characters when
naming an image.

Internet service providers may supply you with an image upload area, but
they may require you to use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program. You may
also be able to find a free or shareware (requiring a small fee) FTP program
on sites such as the following:
 www.tucows.com
 www.download.com (formerly cNet)
 www.shareware.com
If you use the image editing program, Fast Photos (described in Chapter 16)
you will get an FTP program as part of the software at no extra charge!
To upload a file to your ISP’s server with a popular FTP program, Cute FTP
(available at www.tucows.com), follow these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Connection Wizard from the Cute FTP main menu.
The Cute FTP Connection Wizard appears.
2. Click the down arrow by the Choose Your ISP drop-down list, and
select your ISP. Then click Next.
3. Type the user name and password that you use to log on to your
Internet account. Then click Next.
4. Click the Browse button (shown in Figure 15-6) to locate the folder on
your computer where you store your eBay images. Then click Next.
5. If you want to log on to your FTP space upon opening the Cute FTP
program, click the Connect to This Site Automatically check box.
If not, don’t change anything on this screen.
6. Click Finish.
Figure 15-6:
Selecting
your default

197
Chapter 15: Getting the Pictures from Your Camera to eBay

From this point on, every time you open the program (provided you selected
the automatic connection in Step 5), Cute FTP logs on to your Web space and
displays the screen shown in Figure 15-7. Notice that the left side of the program
is open to the folder you selected as the default for your eBay images. The right
side of the screen shows what is currently on your ISP-provided home page.
To upload an image, double-click it. Faster than we could take a screen shot
(okay, we took it anyway, and it’s Figure 15-8), the image is uploaded to our
Web space!

Uploading images to AOL
AOL handles image uploads a bit differently from other ISPs. (But those of
you on AOL knew that already.) Many people love AOL because it provides an
easy, step-by-step interface. As you probably imagine, uploading pictures is
handled in that same AOL style.
To upload pictures to AOL, follow these steps:
1. Sign on to your AOL account.
2. Display the FTP area of AOL:
For users of AOL 5.0: Select Keywords, type my ftp space in the
text line, and click GO.
For users of later versions of AOL: Search keywords for ftp-click
go by typing it in the text line. On the next page, click members
ftp space. Then double-click members.aol.com.
3. Click See My FTP Space.
You’re sent to your AOL storage area.
4. Click Upload.
A screen appears so you can name the file you want to upload, which is
called the remote file.
5. In the Remote Filename box (see Figure 15-9), type a name for your
picture.
Use all-lowercase letters — and no more than eight characters.
Figure 15-9:

Chapter 15: Getting the Pictures from Your Camera to eBay

6. Click Continue.
A window opens so you can locate the file on your computer, as shown
in Figure 15-10.
7. Locate the file, click its filename, and then click Open.
Your file will whiz through the wires to the server at AOL, as shown in
Figure 15-11.
You can now double-check that your file arrived safely by typing its URL in
your browser (as follows) and pressing Enter:
http://members.aol.com/yourscreenname/picturename.jpg
You use the URL when you insert the picture into your eBay item description,
as follows

Uploading your picture to eBay
eBay offers two versions of Picture Services. The basic version, which is shown
in Figure 15-12, allows you to upload eBay-ready images as they appear on 
your computer. If you want to rotate or crop the picture, you need the more
advanced picture service. We use the advanced version in the steps that follow.
When you reach the part of the Sell Your Item form that allows you to add
pictures, does the screen look like Figure 15-12? If so, scroll down and click
the Upgrade to eBay Enhanced Picture Services link. This sends you to eBay’s
Enhanced Picture Services install screen, which is shown in Figure 15-13. If
you’ve never used eBay’s Enhanced Picture Services before, you’ll be asked
for permission to install a small program on your computer. This is safe (and
the only way you can use eBay’s Picture Service features), so click Yes.

To complete the installation, here’s the drill:
1. Click the Set Up Picture Services bar.
On the resulting page, you’re informed about accepting some security
warnings and about the timeframe required to complete the installation
process (which is just a few minutes).
2. Click the Install Now bar when you’re ready.
3. Okay the security warning, as shown in Figure 15-14.
4. When the installation is complete, click Finished.
Then, to upload your pictures, follow these steps:
1. In the Enhanced Picture Services screen (refer to Figure 15-15), click
the Add Picture button.
A window pops up, prompting you to open an image file on your 
computer. 
2. Navigate to the folder that holds your eBay images on your computer. 
3. Click the image you want to upload in the browsing window.
The image name appears in the Filename box.
4. Click the Open button.
The selected image appears in the picture frame.
If you accidentally select the wrong picture to upload, click the X in the
lower-left corner of the thumbnail version to make the picture disappear
so you can select a different one.

5. To rotate the image, click the circular arrow (at the upper right of the
main image box).
6. To crop the image:
a. Click the crop box in the right corner of the larger image.
Two squares appear at opposite corners of your main image. 
b. Click the frame on the outside of your image, and move the bar
until the offensive area is cropped out. 
You can do this from the sides, top and bottom of the picture.
7. To make further edits (such as adjusting brightness or contrast), click
the Advanced Edit button (shown in Figure 15-15) and another
window pops up.
8. When you’re finished doing your edits, click Continue. 
A pop-up window notifies you that your picture is being uploaded to
eBay’s picture server.
Using your hosted images
When you’re filling out the Sell Your Item form on eBay, click the Your Web
Hosting link and type in the URL, or address, for the image on your ISP or
image-hosting server. We recommend that you use eBay’s Picture Service for
the first picture (because it’s free), and you can insert more than one URL for
the images in your description, also at no extra charge.

Using eBay’s Picture Manager
If you really can’t find a place to host your own pictures, you can store them
with eBay’s Picture Manager. Go to your My eBay page and click the Picture
Manager link. The screen shown in Figure 15-16 appears.
In the Picture Manager, you’ll see any pictures you have uploaded, plus these
four buttons: 
 Add Pictures: Click this button to display the basic uploader. (Find more
on the basic and full-featured uploaders at the end of this bullet list.)
 Move: Move a picture into another folder.
 Rename: If you don’t like the name your camera gave the picture (and
who would), you can rename the image here.
 Copy Web Links: When you put a check mark in the corner of one of
your images and click this button, the Picture Manager gives you the
HTML code to copy and paste into your auction description, as shown in
Figure 15-17. From the Picture Dimensions drop-down list, you can
choose HTML code for three picture sizes:
Standard: 400 x 300 (bottom of the page size)
Header: 200 x 150 (header image size)
Thumbnail: 96 x 72 (gallery size)
 Delete: Clicking here will send your images out into hyperspace forever.

I
f there’s one huge myth about taking photos for eBay, it’s that you need to
use a mammoth photo-editing software program. It’s simply not true. In
this chapter we’re going to show you a few simple tips and tricks — but
believe us, that’s all you need. If you have to do any more editing, there’s
something major wrong with your image to start with. Get up from your
cushy computer chair and take another picture. It’s simple as that.
No eBay seller should spend hours playing with and perfecting images for
eBay listings (although some very foolishly do). One pass through a simple
image-editing software program gets any reasonable picture Internet-ready.
Then, after your pictures are, well, picture-perfect, look to Chapter 5 for some
easy ways to upload your images to the Web.
Sizing for Dollars — and 
Quick Load Times
So many sellers ignore this — but it’s one of the most crucial issues in eBay
photography. Keep your file size small — that’s right, in this case, size does
matter, and small is beautiful. Limiting your image’s file size means you don’t
bog down the prospective buyer’s computer screen when somebody’s trying
to view your item page (especially if you’re using multiple pictures in the item
description). Why? It’s simple mathematics: The larger your item’s image files,
the longer the viewer’s browser takes to load the listing page. Most eBay users
will click back out of a listing to avoid a long page load. We’re looking for eyes
on our items — we don’t want to turn away the curious!

There are a few utilities on the Internet that you can use to measure how fast
your page loads once you’ve completed your listing. Just search Google.com
for page load timer and you should come up with a few services. One we tried
out was at www.numion.com/Stopwatch. When you’re viewing your listing,
just copy its URL from the address line at the top of the browser into the timer
page. Click Start Stop Watch and the program will load your requested page
and tell you how long that loading takes. But realize that in this instance, the
listing is loading at your computer’s speed.
Pathetically, the United States (maybe because our country is so big?) lags
behind the rest of the world in its percentage of broadband users. Without
going into a political discussion of the high costs here in the U.S., let’s just
say that over 50 percent of users still dial up. Dialing up (if you broadband
folks can remember back that far) means excruciatingly slow page loads.
To get a better idea of the size for the images you use online, remember that
no matter which camera setting you choose, your image should be designed
to be viewed on a monitor. Low resolution is just fine because the average
computer monitor isn’t an HDTV.
Don’t confuse a printer’s dots-per-inch with a monitor’s pixels-per-inch. They
are two different things. Check out Chapter 7 to get the full explanation.
Computer monitors measure resolution in pixels (tiny squares of on-screen
light) per inch. The average monitor can only produce 72 pixels (some upper-
end models can produce 96 pixels and better). This means that regardless of
your vision, if an image exceeds 72-pixel resolution, you won’t be able to tell
by looking at the monitor. (The average printer can produce 600 dpi or better.)
All you get for your effort is a huge file that takes forever to load.
To get a clearer picture (sorry) of why this matters, consider these average
monitor-resolution settings (in pixels):
 640×480 (VGA)
 800×600 (Super VGA)
 1024×768 (XVGA)
These settings determine the actual number of pixels that will be viewed on
the screen. No matter how large your monitor is (whether 15, 17, or even 21
inches), it shows only as many pixels as you determine in its settings. On
larger screens, the pixels just get larger — which makes your pictures fuzzy.
That’s why most people with larger screens set their monitors for a higher
resolution.
210
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

Higher-resolution monitors make the screen images smaller — but a lower
resolution, bigger image works better for most users. Also consider the aging
baby boomers — they have become huge spenders these days (prime eBay
customers), and they don’t want to squint! Many of today’s users keep their
displays set to the 800×600 size for eye comfort, regardless of monitor size.
Of course, if you use eBay’s Picture Services for your all eBay items, setting
your image size is not a big issue. eBay Picture Services applies a compres-
sion algorithm that forces your pictures into eBay’s prescribed size.
The more compression applied to computer images, the less sharp they
appear. So you’re ahead of the game if you select your image size in your
camera or set your image-editing program to a monitor-friendly size.
Here’s a checklist of tried-and-true techniques for preparing elegant, fat-free,
fast-loading images to display on eBay:
 Set your image resolution at 72 pixels per inch. You can do this with
the settings for your scanner. Although 72 ppi may seem a low resolu-
tion, it merely nibbles computer memory, shows up fast on a buyer’s
screen (even over a dial-up connection), and looks great on eBay.
 When you’re using a digital camera, set its resolution to no higher
than the 800×600 format. That’s custom-made for a VGA monitor. You
can always crop the picture if it’s too large. You can even save the image
at 640×480. It will display well on eBay but take up less space — so you
can add more pictures!
 Make the finished image no larger than 480 pixels wide. When you
size your picture in your image software, it’s best to keep it no larger
than 300×300 pixels or 4 inches square. These dimensions are big
enough for people to see the image without squinting, and the details of
your item show up nicely.
 Crop any unnecessary areas of the photo. Show only your item; every-
thing else is a waste.
 Use your software to darken or change the photo’s contrast. When the
image looks good on your computer screen, the image also looks good
on your eBay auction page.
 Save your image as a .JPG file. When you finish editing your picture,
save it as a .JPG. (To do this, follow the instructions that come with your
software.) .JPG is the best format for eBay; it compresses information
into a small file that loads fast and reproduces nicely on the Internet.
 Check the total file size of your image. After you save the image, make
sure it takes up no more disk space than about 40K (if it’s too much
211
Chapter 16: Making Perfect Pictures

bigger than that, see if you can crop judiciously — or compress your
JPEG to reduce total size). That way eBay users will see the image
appear on-screen in a reasonable amount of time.
 If your image is larger than 50K, reduce it. Small is fast, efficient, and
beautiful. Big is slow, sluggish, and dangerous to your sales. Impatient
eBay users will move on to the next listing if they have to wait to see
your image.
Editing for Perfection (or Close Enough)
Pictures don’t always come out of the camera in perfect form. However, you
can make a few tweaks to bring them into near-perfection range:
 Alter the size: Reduce or increase the size or shape of the image.
 Change the orientation: Rotate the image left or right; flip it horizontally
or vertically.
 Crop the background: Sometimes there’s a little too much background
and not enough product. Don’t waste precious bandwidth on extraneous
pixels. To crop your image means to cut away the unnecessary part of
the picture.
 Adjust the brightness and contrast: These two functions usually work
together in most photo programs. By giving your picture more bright-
ness, you make the picture look brighter (duh) but too much brightness
can obscure details. Raising contrast brings out detail; lowering it dulls
the difference between light and dark. 
No one brightness or contrast setting works equally well for all photo
shoots. Experimentation is the name of the game here.
 Sharpen: If your camera was not perfectly in focus when you took the
picture, applying a photo-editing program’s sharpening feature can help.
But easy does it. Sharpening too much can destroy the smoothness of
the image.
If your image needs any more help other than these alterations, retake the
picture. It’s probably easier and faster.
Employing Image-Editing 
Software and Services
eBay sellers use a wide array of image-editing software. As a matter of fact,
some listing software has built-in mini-editing capabilities. Choosing software
212
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

for your images is like choosing an office chair: What’s right for some people
is dreadful for others. 
When you buy a digital camera, it will no doubt arrive with a CD that includes
some variation of image-editing software. Give it a try. If it works well for you,
keep it. If not, check out the two options we mention further on in this chapter.
Every image-editing software program has its own system requirements and
capabilities. Study the software that comes with your camera or scanner. If
you feel that the program is too complicated (or doesn’t give you the editing
tools you need), investigate some of the other popular programs. You can get
some excellent shareware (software that you can try before you buy) at
www.tucows.com and www.shareware.com.
Just because a program is elaborate (and pricey) doesn’t always mean it’s
better for your purposes. Marsha used to be happy using Adobe Photoshop,
but it’s a large, expensive program — and it’s overkill for eBay images. Stay
tuned for two simple, low-cost solutions: Fast Photos and eBay’s own
Enhanced Photo Services.
Quick touch-up and FTP in Fast Photos
If budget is a consideration (and it should be in any business), you might be
happy giving Fast Photos by Pixby Software a try. It’s a simple, all-in-one
photo-editing program designed especially for e-commerce and eBay sellers.
The developer of the software knew exactly what capabilities online sellers
need for their images — and included just those — nothing else: cropping,
JPEG compression, sharpening, resizing, enhancing, rotating, and adding
watermark text and borders. 
The software is a PC application that runs on Windows XP, 2000, ME, and 98
SE. For a 21-day free trial, visit their Web site at 
www.pixby.com/marshacollier
We call Fast Photos an all-in-one tool for eBay sellers because it not only
allows you to touch up your images quickly, but also has a built-in FTP pro-
gram so you can upload your images immediately after editing them.
Editing an image for eBay in Fast Photos is simple:
1. Open the program.
2. Click Browse and find the directory containing your image.
This location can be a floppy disk (as it is for images from the Sony
Mavica FD series), a Memory Stick, a CompactFlash card, or an area on
your hard drive that you’ve set aside for storing your images.

Rotate: If you’ve shot your picture sideways or upside down, you
can rotate it here.
Crop: In Crop mode, a gray rectangle appears with corner dots.
Click a corner dot, hold, and drag the rectangle until it closes in on
your item. If you want to adjust your cropping area, click and drag
an edge or corner handle to adjust the rectangle’s size. When
you’re satisfied with the cropping, double-click Apply. Poof! It
crops itself and appears at your new size.
Enhance: Brighten, darken, increase or decrease the contrast, and
work with image gamma (how it appears on a monitor) and color. If
you feel that the color of your image isn’t vibrant enough or is too
dark, adjust the brightness and contrast. Moving the sliders to the
left or to the right will (respectively) increase and or decrease

these values. The image in the main window will change as you
perform your alterations, so you know what your image will look
like before you save your changes. When you’re happy with the
image results, feel free to click Apply.
Don’t worry, everything you do is visible on-screen — and it can be
undone if you mess up.
Resize: You can resize your image to the standard eBay sizes or
make the image a custom size.
Sharpen: Is your image a little fuzzy? Click here to bring out the
details. You can apply 3 different strengths of sharpening to your
pictures. 
Add border: If you want a border or a drop shadow on your image,
you can apply it here.
Add text: Type your user ID so you can watermark your images
(add distinctive text in a see-through font that can help dissuade
those who might try to use your images as their own).
JPEG compress: By moving a sliding bar, you can compress the
image as much as you dare. The more you compress, the less
detailed the image will be. Find a workable balance between clear
detail and compact file size.
Create gallery thumbnail: You can create a perfect 192×192 thumb-
nail of your image on a white background for use in the eBay Gallery.

6. To save the changes you’ve made to your image, click Save As, give
your file a name, and press Enter.
Now you can upload your newly edited image to the Web. Those steps are
just as fast:
1. Choose Publish (on the toolbar).
2. Go to the Publish screen and click the Add button under the FTP
accounts box.
This is the procedure for adding (setting up) an FTP account for upload-
ing. The box shown in Figure 16-3 appears. 
Not to brag, but we can send 5MB worth of pictures to our ISP for free!
Check to see what your ISP offers. You might want to check out
mpire.com in Chapter 19 — they also have free image hosting.
3. Input the data required for your FTP server and click OK.
Your image is ready to upload.
4. Highlight the image(s) you want to upload and then click the Publish
button.
You can upload your images to the Web space individually or in a batch —
with the same single mouse click. Once an image is uploaded, you’ll see
the word done appear in the status box at the top of the page. Notice
that it showed up after we uploaded the image in Figure 16-4. You also
see the URL suffix to call up the picture from your Web space.

Using eBay’s Enhanced Picture Services
Free tools — that actually work. How nice is that? eBay’s Picture Services are
now far more than a fancy FTP program. Now you can upload your images and
perform minor editing right on your screen without and additional software.
The Enhanced Picture Services are great for quick one-off items and for
beginners — but if you’re selling many items on eBay, especially over the
long term, you might want to invest in a more robust editing program like
Fast Photos.
The Sell Your Item form is where you find the area that requests your images.
Click the tab for Enhanced Picture Services. If you’ve never used this feature
before, you may have to download a small program (see Chapter 15 for details).
To use this wonderful tool, follow these steps:
1. Click the small Add Picture button.
Doing so opens a directory on your computer, as in Figure 16-5.

4. Apply the appropriate controls to your picture, as follows:
• You can click the little circle if you want to rotate your image (as in
Figure 16-7).
• To crop your picture, click the crop marks. You can now drag the
corners inward or outward to make your picture its best size for
eBay (as in Figure 16-8).
• You can use AutoFix to let eBay’s server decide what’s best for
your picture — but we don’t recommend it. For more satisfying
results, click the Advanced Edit button (as in Figure 16-9) so you
have control over the changes made to your images.
• In Advanced Edit mode you can adjust contrast and brightness,
along with the previously mentioned features. Thankfully, there is
also the Undo button, to whisk away any overaggressive changes
you may have made to your image.
5. When you’ve made all your changes, click Continue in the Sell Your
Item form.
Your image is uploaded to eBay’s server for use in your listing.

Chapter 17
Dolling Up Your eBay Store
In This Chapter
 Adding optional custom pages
 Branding your store with themes and headers
 Promoting sales and special items
W
hen eBay Stores were first introduced, they were severely limited in
their features. At the time, they provided a simple way for sellers to
have all their listings displayed in one place, and that was about it . . .
They’ve come a long way since then! Features have burgeoned. These days
eBay Store owners can choose quite an array of features to make their eBay
Stores into online selling environments. Try these on for size:
 Selling Manager: This program keeps your sales ordered and tracked,
adding professionalism even if you’ve never been to business school.
 Phone support: If you need help with your eBay Store and want to give
eBay a phone call, this feature’s got you covered.
 Traffic reports: Online visitors are the lifeblood of your eBay business;
see how many folks have dropped by for a look at your wares, and how
they got there. 
 E-mail newsletters: Staying in touch with your customers — new, repeat,
or regular — has never been easier.
 Cross-merchandising: If you have (say) a line of perfectly extreme guitar
straps to go with those hot electric guitars you’re selling, get those
goods to help sell each other!
 Custom non-inventory pages: Here’s where you can expand on your
policies or terms and conditions, share your expertise — any non-
inventory information you need to share.
 Custom headers: These give your store’s Web pages a look that is 
consistent — but uniquely yours — that makes customers feel welcome.
 Promotion boxes: Catch that trend and ride it by calling attention to
your latest hot item, or get that special sale up and running in no time.

Should you decide to open an eBay Store, you have three different levels you
can choose: Basic, Featured, or Anchor. The Featured and Anchor levels have
all of the same features of a Basic store, along with additional merchandising
exposure and traffic reporting. To give you the big picture, this chapter
covers the features that can help all eBay store owners enhance the look of
their stores and their listings.
Deciding on Custom Pages
With each eBay Store, the seller can create a specific number of optional
custom pages with additional information about the seller, the store, or the
merchandise available for sale. A Basic store can have up to five custom
pages. These pages provide a virtual blank slate for the seller to provide
more information to their customers about their business and items for sale.
Follow these steps to create custom pages for your eBay Store:
1. Go to your eBay Store.
2. Click the Seller, manage Store link at the bottom-right corner of the page.
3. Click the Custom Pages link on the left side of the page under Store
Design.
4. Click the Create new page link to create a new custom page.
For sellers who create an optional custom page, eBay offers a choice of lay-
outs which include promotion boxes, item showcases, text sections, item
lists, and picture placements.
How many custom pages you can create depends on the level of your eBay
Store; the higher the level, the more custom pages you are allowed. When
you’ve created the maximum number of custom pages, you have to delete an
existing page before you can create a new one.
Setting Up a Theme
Chapter 4 makes the case that the best way to get return customers is for you
to create a consistent look for your listings — a style or “brand” that sticks in
your visitors’ minds. The trick is to work up a standard color scheme, logo,
and overall on-screen look that works for any and all of your merchandise. A
perfect place to start is the look of your eBay Store.
224
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

eBay provides features you can use to define a theme for your eBay Store —
using standard colors, fonts, and layouts, or customizing the colors and fonts
you use — and you can choose from a virtual wonderland of possibilities —
but here’s a word to the wise . . . 
If you have a logo, make sure its color scheme is made up of complementary
shades. Garish, clashing colors are one way to drive your customers’ eyes
away from your listings. Who wants to buy what’s hard to look at?
Follow these steps to customize the look of your eBay Store:
1. Go to your eBay Store.
2. Click the Seller, manage Store link at the bottom-right corner of 
the page.
3. Click the Display Settings link on the left side of the page under Store
Design.
4. Click the Edit current theme link on the right side of the page in the
Theme and Display section of the page.
Customizing Your Store Header
The workhorse of the theme for your eBay Store is the header — a distinct,
consistent, on-screen area that includes the seller’s logo, store name, a brief
description of the store, and a summary of the merchandise for sale. eBay
recently provided the capability to expand the standard header with text, pic-
tures, and links — which then appears on-screen below the standard header
on every page of the eBay Store.
eBay offers several different ways to format the expanded header — and you
can view current choices by going to the following page:
http://pages.ebay.com/storefronts/headerdesign.html
These options include
 One Main Featured Item and Two Sub-Featured Items
 Two Featured Items and Six Promotional Links
 Three Featured Items
 Four Featured Items
225
Chapter 17: Dolling Up Your eBay Store

When you choose the link for the layout you prefer and fill in the options,
eBay generates a paragraph of HTML commands, which you can then copy
and paste when you create an expanded header. Speaking of which . . .
Follow these steps to create an expanded header:
1. Go to your eBay Store.
2. Click the Seller, manage Store link at the bottom-right corner of 
the page.
3. Click the Display Settings link on the left side of the page under Store
Design.
4. Near the bottom of the page in the Theme and Display section, click
the Change link to the right of the Store page header designation.
5. Enter the text or HTML commands to be included in the new
expanded header.
Figure 17-1 shows an example of an expanded header that uses the Three
Featured Items layout.

226
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

The expanded Store header appears on every page in an eBay Store, includ-
ing any custom pages you’ve created.
Using eBay Store Promotion Boxes
One of the most flexible features that eBay offers its Store owners is the pro-
motion box — which puts your hottest item right out front, calls attention to
special sales, and adds some zip to your eBay Store. Promotion boxes come
in various pre-designed formats that are seriously easy to use; they take you
step-by-step through a guided setup process. The only limit on how to use a
promotion box is the seller’s imagination — imagine these uses, for example:
 Providing an alternative method for navigating through the store
 Highlighting specific listings
 Displaying a banner that calls attention to special information
 Promoting accessory items
 Announcing special sales
When you create a promotion box, you start by defining several parameters.
Some of these work only with a specific type of promotion box (we get into
the different types of promotion boxes later in this chapter). But several
parameters are common to all promotion boxes.
 Unique name: You give a name to every promotion box you create. The
name can be anything you want, but make sure it helps you identify the
purpose of the promotion box. The box’s name is never displayed in
your eBay Store — your customers never see it.
 Consistent colors: The colors used for the promotion boxes are pre-set;
they’re the same ones you defined when you chose or created the theme
for your eBay Store. If you want to get especially creative, you can rede-
fine these colors (or not) for each promotion box you create.
 Location: You define where to put the promotion box on-screen as you
create it. There are five different possible locations for promotion boxes
(as detailed in the upcoming sections).
Follow these steps to create a new promotion box:
1. Go to your eBay Store.
2. Click the Seller, manage Store link at the bottom-right corner of 
the page.
227
Chapter 17: Dolling Up Your eBay Store

3. Click the Promotion Boxes link on the left side of the page under Store
Design.
4. Click the Create New Promotion Box button to create a new promo-
tion box.
Promotion-box placement and size
Hey, even virtual real estate is valuable. So you get two standard, on-screen
locations for the placement of promotion boxes on inventory pages — each
of which has specific size limitations (summarized in Table 17-1).
If you want to use a promotion box on a custom (non-inventory) eBay Store
page (as mentioned earlier in this chapter), all you have to do is choose one
of the two promotion-box layouts while you’re creating the custom page.
Each Store page gives you two places to put a promotion box:
 The upper area of each Store page: This area is just above the list of
items for sale, and directly below the header. It’s pretty handy — you
can place two small promotion boxes there, side by side; these locations
go by the names Top Left and Top Right (as shown in Figure 17-2). If you
want to use this entire space for one double-wide promotion box, how-
ever, no problem.
Figure 17-2:
Top Left and
Top Right
promotion
boxes.
228
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

 Below the left Store Navigation bar: Same deal here — you can put one
or two promotion boxes in this area (depending on what does the job
best for you), and they’ll show up on every page in your eBay Store that
shows a left navigation bar, as shown in Figure 17-3.
If you use eBay Store categories (if? but of course you do!), you can specify
different Top promotion boxes for every separate store category page — and
you can make them different from the Top Left and Top Right (or Single) pro-
motion boxes you create for the All Categories page.

Chapter 17: Dolling Up Your eBay Store

Choosing a type of promotion box
eBay really started something when it introduced promotion boxes. They
were so popular with eBay Store owners that many different formats were
designed and made available. Customizing the look of an eBay store became
as common as it was easy. The reason is simple: Most promotion-box formats
are not only predefined, eBay guides you automatically through the setup
process as you create them.
Custom Links
Using the Custom Links promotion box, you can display from four to ten cus-
tomized links that take customers to specified pages within your eBay Store
(or elsewhere on eBay). This promotion box has a border; the seller defines
the border color and the words displayed in the title bar.
You can display no more than four links in either of the Upper promotion
boxes. If you initially define a promotion box for one of the Left locations with
more than four links, but later change the box’s location to one of the Upper
positions, only the first four links are displayed; the rest are hidden and not
displayed.
Be sure that any links included in this promotion box are in compliance with
the eBay Links policy — which (don’t panic) you can find by going to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/listing-links.html
Custom Text/HTML
Among promotion boxes, this one is the superhero of versatility. It allows the
seller to enter virtually any text, HTML commands, or images (subject to the
limitations outlined in Table 17-1). The border and title bar are optional; if
you choose the border/title bar option when you create the box, you can
enter the desired title — and change the color scheme if you want to.
A link to the eBay Stores HTML Builder is ready to hand just above the text-
entry box for the Custom Text/HTML promotion box. See Chapter 19 for more
information about HTML Builder — it’s way too handy not to.
Ending Soon
The Ending Soon promotion box is predefined with a border and title bar; if
you don’t like the color scheme and the words in the title as supplied by
eBay, you can change ’em. This box shows a picture and the title of an item
whose auction is ending soon — followed by a link that the customer can use
to see more listings that will be ending in the near future. (When you create
230
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

this promotion box, you can define the store category and/or the time period —
from one hour to one week — to determine which of those listings are dis-
played.) The Top Right box in Figure 17-2 is an example of the Ending Soon
promotion box.
If more than one listing will be ending in the time period defined for the
Ending Soon promotion box, it rotates the displayed listings randomly, and
shows them whenever the promotion box is included on a page viewed by a
customer.
Generic (Featured Listings)
The Generic promotion box features one or two individual listings. If a single
listing is featured, a link is displayed with the item’s title and picture. If two
listings are featured, the box shows only the titles of the items — no pictures —
as links. Figure 17-2 shows what the box looks like for a single featured listing
(at Top Left) and for two separate featured listings (at Top Right).
When you create a Generic promotion box, you can choose the listings to be
featured — either manually or by defining specific criteria — say, listing
format, store category, keyword, price range. Either way, the featured listings
will be selected and updated automatically whenever a customer views any
page containing this promotion box.
Graphic
The Graphic promotion box displays an image, whether a custom picture
(supplied by the seller) or a predefined image supplied by eBay. You can
define this image as a link for the customer to click (gotta love that HTML!)
that displays a specific set of search results from listings in your eBay Store.
Using keywords and/or specific eBay Store categories, you can define exactly
which listings are displayed when a customer clicks this link.
If you define an image for use in the Graphic promotion box without making it
the exact size allowed for the location (as defined in Table 17-2), your image
is resized to fit that location — and the quality of the picture may suffer. For
example, if you supply a square image and the promotion box is rectangular,
the resulting graphic will show up distorted on-screen.

Item Showcase
You can use the Item Showcase promotion box to highlight one to four spe-
cific listings at the top of category pages — and even display different listings
on different category pages — either a horizontally or vertically. You can
specify the listings you want displayed, or you can designate criteria that
determine which items show up on-screen. And you can look ahead: If you
defined your starting listings specifically, you can change them by setting cri-
teria that pick out replacement listings when those listings end — all in the
course of creating this promotion box.
The Item Showcase promotion box cannot be displayed in either the Upper
or Lower locations below the left navigation bar. It won’t fit.
If you’ve already defined the Top Left and or Top Right promotion boxes and
you create an Item Showcase to put there, it’ll go there but those previously
defined promotion boxes change to Inactive status. You don’t need to deacti-
vate them yourself; eBay does that automatically for you when you place the
Item Showcase.
Newly Listed
The Newly Listed promotion box is pre-defined with a border and title bar,
although the seller may change the color scheme and the words in the title if
they don’t care for the title supplied by eBay. Links to two items recently listed
by the seller are displayed in this promotion box, followed by a link to see
more newly listed items. When creating this promotion box, you can set the
store category and/or the time period — from twelve hours to one week — that
determines which listings are displayed. The Top Left promotion box in
Figure 17-2 is an example of the Newly Listed promotion box.
If you listed more than two items in the time period defined for the Newly
Listed promotion box, it displays and randomly rotates those listings when-
ever it’s included on a page being viewed by a customer.
232
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

Shipping & Payment Information
The Shipping & Payment Information promotion box highlights payment and
shipping information for the customer. It’s a predefined box with a border
and title bar, although you can change the color scheme and the words in the
title if eBay’s defaults strike you as less than inspiring. The Upper promotion
box on the left side of Figure 17-3 is an example of this promotion box.
Initially the text for this promotion box is the same as the settings defined on
the Sell Your Item page (used when listing an item on eBay — see Chapter 2).
Of course, you can change this information if you really want to, but keep in
mind that if you change it for this promotion box, you don’t change the set-
tings for the Sell Your Item page for any subsequent new listings. (Chapter 2
also includes details on how to do that.)
Store Newsletter
The Store Newsletter promotion box displays a message about your eBay
Store’s e-mail-marketing mailing lists. This is a pre-defined box with a border
and title bar; you can change the color scheme and the words in the title if
you like. You type your promo information into a text-entry box, and if you
want to work up a long-term, happy relationship with your customer (and
what seller doesn’t?), you can crate a Sign Up button. When the customer
clicks that button, it adds your Store’s owner (yep, that’s you) to the cus-
tomer’s Favorite Sellers list on eBay, and to your mailing list. The Lower pro-
motion box on the left side of Figure 17-3 is an example of this promotion box.

wax. For the latest how-to for this powerful feature of your eBay Store, check

Porting Your Listings to Other Sites
In This Chapter
 Moving out into the browser battlefield
 Staying compatible with your customers’ browsers
 Expanding your selling beyond eBay
 Setting up your own Web site and finding a host
“D
on’t put all your eggs in one basket unless you want a sudden
omelet.” There’s a reason those old sayings keep being repeated
from one generation to another — they keep turning up true! There’s more to
eBay than just the auction site; you might lose a selling opportunity if you
overlook the other available selling areas. And there’s more to selling online
than just selling on eBay (for openers, there’s a whole Internet out there . . . ).
So here’s where we discuss a few other sites to broaden your customer base,
point out several other solutions provided by eBay the company — and
maybe help you put a lot more eggs in a lot more baskets.
Selling on venues in the eBay community — or on your own Web site — is
another reason to create a standard look (a.k.a. brand) for your listings (as
discussed in Chapter 17). If a previous customer should recognize your list-
ing layout on another Web site, it could be an incentive to purchase from 
you rather than from another seller.
Understanding Browser Compatibility
Before we talk about selling in different venues, we need to touch on making
sure that your listings are compatible with multiple browsers. A browser,
after all, is a program used to view Web sites on the Internet — not just eBay.
If you’re like most people, your first adventures with accessing the Internet
probably got you used to the browser that was provided with your computer.
Most probably, this browser was Microsoft Internet Explorer (call it a hunch).
More experienced users learn that other browsers are available, and wind up
using several. They settle on one specific browser that they prefer for most

uses, but keep one or two other browsers installed for use when those are
required by specific sites.
In a galaxy far, far away . . . 
In the early days of the Internet, there were only a few browser options. In the
late 1990s, the first of the “browser wars” began between Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Since Internet Explorer came already
installed on any computer with a Windows-based platform, it became the 
de-facto standard browser, winning that war.
Recently, however, another browser war has begun — primarily due to the
widespread use of Internet Explorer. Unfortunately, as the use of the Internet
became more widespread, miscreants started spreading their own brand of
trouble in this new landscape — creating viruses, computer worms, and mal-
ware targeted at Internet Explorer. Some even used Internet Explorer itself to
spread malicious programs by taking advantage of its security flaws. Out of
sheer self-defense, users have begun to explore other browsers.
Viewing a listing in various browsers
Virtually all Web pages look at least a bit different when viewed in different Web
browsers. Sometimes the apparent difference is minor, such as a change in the
spacing between sections of a page. But in other instances, the differences can
be major — even to the point of a page that’s perfectly legible in one browser
being unreadable in another. This can occur because one browser might not be
able to perform an HTML formatting command that the other browser handles
easily.
Figure 18-1 shows the home page of Marsha’s Web site (www.coolebaytools.
com), viewed using Internet Explorer 6.0. Figure 18-2 is the same page viewed
using Netscape Navigator 7.1. 
And finally, Figure 18-3 is the very same page displayed in Firefox 1.5. The
major difference in the three is that both Netscape Navigator and Firefox add
a line break both above the header, and also between the header and the nav-
igation bar. The border lines also appear bolder in Internet Explorer.
Although these differences in browser display appear to be minimal, there
are occasions when a page viewed in a browser will look not at all like you
expected, so it is very important to view all your listing pages in the
browsers you expect your customers to be using.

Chapter 18: Porting Your Listings to Other Sites

We recommend that you test out your listing in at least these three browsers
commonly used by eBay customers: 
 Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1: If you don’t have it, you can down-
load it at microsoft.com/downloads.

Checking Out Half.com, 
an eBay Company
Half.com, founded in July 1999, was the brainchild of Half.com’s President
Joshua Kopelman. He observed the insufficiencies of retailing in the area of
used mass-market merchandise and went to work on developing a new outlet
for second-hand merchandise. Kopelman’s site was so successful that eBay
bought out Half.com after its first year of business.

Selling at Half.com differs from selling in your eBay (or other online) personal
store because you’re selling in a fixed-price marketplace. Your item is listed
head-to-head against more of the exact same item that other sellers are sell-
ing. Half.com isn’t a home for your store; you might say that each item has its
own store, complete with competing sellers.
The what and how of selling on Half.com
You can sell a variety of goods at Half.com (see its home page in Figure 18-4).
Half.com currently lists millions of items, including books, music CDs, DVDs
and VHS video tapes, video games, and video game systems.
From a seller’s point of view, the best features of Half.com are
 The item listing is free.
 The item stays on the site until the item is sold or until you remove it.
Half.com charges a commission after your item sells. Commissions for items
sold in the Books, Music, Movies, and Games categories are a percentage of
the selling price of the item only; the shipping cost is not added to the selling
price when this commission is determined. For the most current commission
rate, go to

Chapter 18: Porting Your Listings to Other Sites

You’ll find that some of the standard features you use at eBay — for example,
feedback — also show up at Half.com. Although payments are processed via
PayPal, this is transparent to both the buyer and the seller. Half.com collects
the payment from the buyer, deducts the commission, and sellers get paid on
a monthly basis — no worries about non-paying bidders here! And no need 
to determine shipping costs either; Half.com had a standard shipping reim-
bursement amount for each product type. For the latest on shipping costs,
review the information at
http://pages.half.ebay.com/help/seller/fulfill.html
Listing your items at Half.com
To list an item for sale at Half.com, you first need to locate the item’s Universal
Product Code (UPC) or a book’s International Standard Book Number (ISBN). In
case you’re wondering what an ISBN is, turn this book over and find the bar
code on the back.
If you don’t want to bring all your books, CDs, movies, or games to your 
computer, you can use an inexpensive hand-held scanner (one that holds
memory) and take it over to your stacks of items. Scan all the ISBN or UPC
numbers until the scanner memory fills up. Go back to your computer and
download the data to input for sale.
When someone searches for an item, a book for example, at Half.com, a list-
ing of all sellers who are selling that book appears. The listings are classified
by the condition of the book — categorized as “Like New” or “Very Good” —
depending on what the seller entered. The original list price of the book is
included, as well as other descriptive information, and identical items listed
on eBay. Other points to know about listing at Half.com include the following:
 When you enter the UPC or ISBN, Half.com comes up with a stock photo
and description of your item, so you don’t even have to take a picture
for your sale. When an item is out-of-print, Half.com may not have an
image to upload with the listing. In this case, a generic image appears in
the area where the picture would appear. 
 In addition to Half.com’s stock description, you can also enter a short
description of your item — plain text only — of up to 500 characters. It’s
where you tell buyers about the condition of your item. Up to 75 charac-
ters of this description display on the main product page, along with a
link to display the full text.
 You can also add an optional expanded description of your item in
either plain text or HTML. This expanded description appears on your
item page underneath your comments.
240
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

The expanded description area, which allows you to enter HTML, is
where you can provide an image of the item you have for sale. This fea-
ture is especially handy when Half.com doesn’t have a stock photo avail-
able. (See Chapter 7 for the scoop on inserting a picture using HTML.)
As does eBay, Half.com has specific guidelines concerning what you can (and
can’t) include in your item description. Be sure you get up to speed on these
guidelines by reviewing the Half.com policies, which you can find at
http://pages.half.ebay.com/help/seller/list.html
Trading Space on Amazon.com
Another online alternative is Amazon.com, where you’ll find multiple options
for selling your merchandise. We won’t go into the specific details about how
to list items on these alternative sites, but if you’ve listed items on eBay or
Half.com, you’ll find the listing pages on the other selling sites to be very sim-
ilar. In fact, you can probably port your titles and descriptions to the other
sites with very little modification.
As on eBay, Amazon.com gives you specific guidelines concerning what can
be included in your item description. Check out Amazon’s policies (so you
can comply with them) by going to
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/1161232/
103-0118635-1456656
Similar to Half.com, Amazon.com has an area (called the Marketplace) where
sellers can sell books, movies, music and associated items easily by simply
entering the ISBN or UPC code. If the number is in the Amazon.com database, a
stock photo and/or description is provided, and the seller needs to enter only a
fixed price and the condition of the item they are selling. Amazon then pro-
vides a link to these fixed price items from their product information pages.
In addition, Amazon.com has a feature like eBay Stores, but only for fixed
price listings. These listings (and any Marketplace listings the seller has) are
included in the seller’s zShop. And last but not least, Amazon.com has an
area of its Web site where a seller can list items for auctions, just as at eBay.
To find out about selling on Amazon.com, just point your browser to the fol-
lowing Web page:

Selling Your Wares at Overstock.com
Overstock.com began its life as a Web site where consumers could buy (what
else?) overstock items at a deep discount from the company itself. In 2005,
Overstock.com opened an auction marketplace, which provides yet another
outlet for selling your merchandise. 
We won’t cover the specific details about how to list items and sell at
Overstock.com, but if you’ve listed items on eBay or Half.com, you’ll no
doubt find the selling process and format for listing items familiar, and 
you may be able to reuse many of the titles and descriptions you already
have in place.
We advise you to look for and respect any specific guidelines that Overstock.
com gives you concerning the information that’s appropriate and necessary
to include in your item descriptions. You can find out about its policies 
by following this link: http://auctions.overstock.com/cgi-bin/

To get started selling on Overstock.com, just point your browser to the fol-
lowing Web page and let Overstock.com guide you from there: http://
auctions.overstock.com/cgi-bin/auctions.cgi?PAGE=FAQ.
Selling on Your Own Web site
Although your eBay Store can function as your sole online presence, you
might at some point consider opening up your own Web site. There are 
literally hundreds of options available, with a wide, sometimes confusing
array of options. The following bullet list highlights some of the things you
need to consider when evaluating potential companies to host your Web site:
 Cost
• What is the basic cost per month?
• Is there an additional fee based on completed transactions?
• Is there a sign-up discount available?
 Disk Space
• Is there a limit for the amount of information transferred? (This
limit is often based on thousands of megabytes per month)
• Will you be able to upload audio, video, and/or flash if necessary? 
• Is there a limit to the number of pages, subdirectories, or sub-sites
you can have?
242
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

 Password protection can be applied at several different levels; it’s espe-
cially useful if more than one person will have access to the Web-site-
building area.
 Site statistics or traffic reports should provide information about the
number of visitors to your site and when they are visiting — the more
detail the better.
 A Photo/File Manager will help with uploading, deleting, and relocating
images, inventory, and text files.
 An HMTL Editor will make the task of maintaining the pages of your Web
site a breeze.
 E-mail marketing tools can help you stay in contact with your 
customers — essential to garnering repeat business!
 Blogging Tools can put you on the cutting edge by helping you communi-
cate with your customers via your very own blog — Weblogs are the
latest thing!
 PayPal Payment Processing can ease the payment process for both
buyer and seller.
 A Secure Payment Gateway is essential if you have your own merchant
account for credit card payments.
 Is your own Domain name (www.yourWeb site.com) included, or will
you need to get that yourself?
 E-mail addresses (How many do you need?)
 E-mail and/or phone support, tutorials, and setup wizards provided in a
convenient and efficient form are essential in setting up and maintaining
your Web site.
 Gift Certificate and Web Coupon Builders can help you create additional
income sources quickly and easily.
 Automatic backup by the hosting company of your Web site — all of it —
on a regular basis can assist in your peace of mind. (But you’ll still need
to make copies of essential information yourself!)
Choosing a Web-hosting company
Of course, not all these features are strictly necessary for the success of your
Web site — and not all Web-site-hosting companies provide the same fea-
tures. You have to determine which features are most important to you and
your business, do your own comparison of several different hosting compa-
nies, and then decide which company offers the best place to set up your
own online store.
243
Chapter 18: Porting Your Listings to Other Sites

One of the most important things to look for is sample Web sites that the
company hosts — or you can ask the company for referrals to folks who use
their service successfully (they won’t mind referring you — call it a hunch). 
A current customer’s evaluation can be very helpful when you’re determining
which Web-site-hosting service to use.
Checking out eBay’s ProStores
eBay now provides a way for you to create your own Web site apart from
your regular eBay Store: ProStores. Figure 18-5 shows the ProStores home
page. If that looks intriguing, you can find more information about ProStores
via a link at the bottom-left corner of the eBay home page (in the More eBay
Sites block), or you can go directly to www.prostores.com.
As with most companies that provide Web-hosting services, ProStores has sev-
eral levels of Web hosting available: ProStores Express, ProStores Business,
ProStores Advanced, and ProStores Enterprise. Each level provides increas-
ingly elaborate services — for an associated increase in cost.
As with any other Web-site-hosting company, be sure to evaluate all of the
features available and estimate the expected total cost of a solution as you
evaluate a potential host’s services — before you sign up. Don’t be afraid to
shop around; the pros do.

Chapter 19
Automating with HTML
Generators
In This Chapter
 Automating your listings
 Turbo Listing your items
 Using third-party HTML generators to generate parties (uh, listings)
O
kay, by the time you’ve thoroughly used and dog-eared this book, you’ll
be champing at the bit to extend your eBay-listing mastery (call it a
hunch) — so we’ll just mention a few free HTML generators. Just remember
that fancy auctions are nice to look at, but fancy doesn’t make the item sell
any better. Competitive pricing and low shipping rates — those are the prac-
tical nuts and bolts that work in your favor. 
A clean, efficient listing with as many photos as necessary goes a long way to
sell your product. The use of simple HTML doesn’t slow the loading of your
page, but if you dump in a lot of miscellaneous images (decorative back-
grounds, animations, and other claptrap), viewing your auction becomes a
chore for those who dial up. And forget the background music — that really
slows things down (and it’s so, well, ’90s)!
Luckily, you don’t have to know any highfalutin computer code to use these
generators. So if you’re stuck in a time constraint — or perhaps just like to
automate your work, we found some excellent tools for you to use. These
HTML generators can really help.
HTML Generator Symbols
When you use HTML generators, you will come across some universal sym-
bols. Mostly they appear at the top of the text-input box — or in the design
area. To save you confusion, here are the most common symbols and what
they stand for:

Boldface text
Italicize text
Underline text
Align text to the left
Center text
Align text to the right
Create a numbered list
Create a bulleted list
“Deindent” (Say what?) — that is, move indented text back to the left (Oh.)
Indent text to the right
Check the spelling in your description
You may also come to some other mysterious HTML symbols — well, okay,
not so mysterious — as quests go, this one’s pretty easy: 
 A double ring that looks like two chain links. Clicking this enables you
to set up a Web link.
 The letters ABC with a check mark. Clicking here will double-check the
spelling in your text.
 A bucket spilling paint. (No, it isn’t time to redo the living room.)
Clicking the bucket brings out a color palette. Just click the color you
want — and watch it will fill in the background.

Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

Using eBay’s Turbo Lister
Not much in this world is free, but (for now, anyway) eBay offers you a free,
convenient tool you can use to list your items for sale: Turbo Lister. This
powerful software helps you organize your items for sale, design your ads,
and list them. It organizes your items for future relisting as well, saving your
initial item input and allowing you to create folders for storage. Your items
disappear from the program only if you delete them.
We like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use, with a built-in WYSI-
WYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editor that makes preparing your
eBay listings offline a breeze. After you’ve input your items and are ready to
list, you can just click a button and they’re all listed at once. You can also stag-
ger listings and schedule them for a later date (for a fee). Sound intriguing?
Read on: This chapter gives you an inside look at how Turbo Lister works.
Although Turbo Lister is free, you’re still responsible for any fees you incur
by listing an item on the site.
Features and minimum requirements
eBay created a winner in Turbo Lister. It’s robust software with the following
seller-friendly features:
 Self-updates: Turbo Lister automatically updates itself regularly from
the eBay site, and pops in any new eBay enhancements so your listings
always take advantage of eBay’s latest features. Whenever you invoke
the program, it loads — and then immediately checks with the eBay
server for updates. Well, okay, sometimes this can be a bit laborious
(especially if the servers are busy or you have a slow Internet connec-
tion), so if you plan to list your items at a particular time, be sure to
open Turbo Lister earlier so you can give it a few minutes to work its
updating magic.
 HTML templates: Predesigned HTML templates are built into the pro-
gram’s Listing Designer. If you use one of eBay’s multitude of colorful
themes or layouts, you’re charged an additional ten cents (horrors!) on
top of your listing fees unless you’re a subscriber to Selling Manager 
Pro — in which case, you can use the Designer for free — but what else
can you get for a dime these days? You can use a template of your own
design to jumpstart your ad design without incurring extra charge by
pasting it into the HTML view. You can even use templates from other
sources (such as those in Book V), as long as they are in HTML format.
 WYSIWYG interface: If you choose to design your own ads from
scratch, you can do it with Turbo Lister’s easy-to-use WYSIWYG (what
you see is what you get) layout design.
247
Chapter 19: Automating with HTML Generators

 Bulk listing tool: Prepare your listings whenever you have the time.
When you’re ready to launch a group of them, just transfer them to the
upload area and — go for it — upload them.
 Item preview: You can preview your listings to be sure they look just as
you want them to.
 All item listing capabilities are available offline: By using Turbo Lister
(and its constant auto-upgrading), you won’t sacrifice any of the features
available to you when you list on the site using the Sell Your Item form.
Although this software is hugely useful, you have to decide whether it’s really
for you. The first order of business is to check whether your computer meets
Turbo Lister’s minimum requirements.
 Your computer must be a PC, not a Mac (sorry, Mac users). You have to
have the Windows 98, 98 SE, ME, NT 4+SP6, 2000, or XP operating system.
 The processor must be at least a Pentium II. The faster your processor,
the better.
 You must have at least 64MB of RAM (and that’s a bare minimum).
The more RAM you have, the better things work.
 You should have at least 20MB of free space on your hard drive to run
the installation.
 Minimum monitor setting of at least 800×600 resolution, 256 colors (8-
bit). Keep in mind the software interface looks a lot better with 16-bit
color and 1024×768 resolution. (All recent monitors these days have this
capability, so you should be just fine there.)
 Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 or later.
To check your version of Internet Explorer with the browser open, click the
Help menu and then click About Internet Explorer command. On the top line,
your Internet Explorer version number is listed.
Downloading Turbo Lister
Of course, to use Turbo Lister, you have to get hold of it first. Go to the down-
load page at
pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister/download.html
After you install Turbo Lister on your computer, you can list auctions on the
easy-to-use form. What could be simpler?
248
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

After you get to download page, follow these steps:
1. Read the system Requirements.
The requirements for using Turbo Lister appear above the two links for
downloading. Things change quickly in the eBay world and you need to
be sure your computer is prepared for the installation.
2. Click the Turbo Lister Web Setup link.
The Windows Security warning appears, cautioning that you’re about to
download something foreign to your computer.
3. Click Yes.
Clicking Yes downloads Turbo Lister; clicking No doesn’t. Just trust us
(and eBay) and click Yes.
From this point on, installation is automatic. Voilà! Turbo Lister is on your
computer!
Note that this procedure first downloads a small setup version of the pro-
gram that checks your computer for preinstalled files. When that task is fin-
ished, Turbo Lister checks back with mothership eBay and automatically
downloads any files it needs.
After you’ve installed the program, you’ll see a new icon on your desktop — a
little green man juggling magic pixie dust over his head. This is the icon for
Turbo Lister. Double-click it and you’ll see the Turbo Lister splash screen,
which pops up every doggone time you open the program — which can get
annoying. It doesn’t do anything for you and wastes precious seconds of your
time. If you want to avoid it, click the check box labeled Do not show me this
screen again, and then click Start Here. The little green man will be forever
banished.
When the program is open, the first thing you do is to set up a new Turbo
Lister file, like this:
1. Select the Start option from the opening screen, and click Next.
2. Fill in your eBay user ID and password, and then click Next.
Turbo Lister now wants to connect back to eBay to retrieve your eBay
account information.
3. Make sure your Internet connection is live, and then click the Connect
Now button.
In a minute or so, a small window opens with your eBay registration
information (your name, address, and e-mail address). Click Next.
249
Chapter 19: Automating with HTML Generators

4. Click the button next to one of the three offered choices:
a. Create a new item: Click this one if you’d like to create a new list-
ing item immediately.
b. Import Items from my eBay Selling Account: This option allows
you to prepopulate the program with your existing listings.
c. No Action: The program does nothing until you give it a command.
We like this option because — due to many disasters over the
years — we’ve learned to “think first, then click.”
5. Click Finish.
The program awaits and you’re ready to list.
Listing with Turbo Lister
Now that you have Turbo Lister at hand, you can prepare hundreds of eBay
listings in advance and launch them with a single mouse click. Or, if you want
to start your auctions at a particular date and time, you can select a sched-
uled item launching format.
Assuming you told the program to do nothing upon startup, we suggest that if
you currently have items up for sale on eBay (and who doesn’t?), you import
your existing eBay listings into the program. If you have multiple stock items
listed on eBay (that you’ve listed through the Sell Your Item page or with
eBay’s relist feature), you can import those listings into Turbo Lister for future
use and relisting. Just choose File➪Import Items➪From eBay Listings, as we
have in Figure 19-1.
Then you have choice to make about what to download:
 Your active listings: The items that you currently have up for sale on the
site, whether they are in your store or on the auction site
 Your ended listings: Here you can download — by indicating ’em in the
drop-down menu — your ended items from the past 24 hours, 7 days, 14
days, 31 days and All. Clicking All permitted us to download everything
back to 90 days! The whole thing came to 321 items, so we backed off
and only took 7 days’ worth!
Click the Show Preview link (as in Figure 19-2) before you download your
items. That’s the way we found out that we didn’t need all those 321 items
eBay was ready to send to us!
250
Part IV: Advanced Applications for Your Newfound Skills 

If you sell individual items and have no repeat stock, don’t bother taking the
time to download your old listings. We do suggest that you indicate that you
want all Unsold items for the past 90 days. That way you won’t have to rein-
put them when it’s time to resell.
Behold: In a moment or two, you’re presented with a complete listing of every-
thing you’ve asked for. (What a concept.) You can then save your listings as
templates or for uploading at a later date. If you have duplicate of any items,
you can highlight the ones you wish to remove; hit your Delete key and bid
them begone. You can also highlight the items you want to remove and go to
Edit➪Delete Items, as in Figure 19-3.

Here’s the heart of the matter. Follow these steps to list an auction:
1. Click the New button (the one with the starburst symbol) in the upper-
left corner.
You see a menu where you can either Create a New Item or Create
Multiple Items with Pre-filled Item Information.
a. Creating Multiple items is handy if you are listing many items that
are type of media, like CDs, DVDs or books. Selecting Multiple
items gets you a screen like the one in Figure 19-4. You can also
select whether you want to run these listings as Auctions, Fixed
Prices, or as Store Listings.
At this point, the items we asked for will show up in the Item
Inventory box with our other items we’ve downloaded from eBay.
(As Figure 19-5 shows, you can even edit those listings.)
b. Selecting Create a New Item brings you to a screen where you
decide the type of listing you want. 
From here on, let’s assume we want an Auction format for our 
listing.
2. Click the Auction option, and then click Next.
A page appears, waiting for you to enter all your listing information,
including your title (and subtitle if you want).

3. In the Item Title box, enter the title.
If you want to use a subtitle, type that as well. Subtitles are handy for
adding selling points that accompany your title in search results.
(Entering a subtitle for your auction costs an additional fifty cents.)
4. Select your category by clicking the Select box.
You are presented with a screen that lists all eBay categories in a hierar-
chal format. The main categories are listed with a plus sign next to them.
When you find your main category, click the plus sign, and subcate-
gories are displayed, as shown in Figure 19-6. To drop even lower into
the world of nether-categories, keep clicking the plus signs next to
subtopics. You know you’ve hit the bottom rung of the category ladder
when you see only a minus sign.
5. If you have an eBay Store, select a category for the item in your store
from the next drop-down list.
This list is automatically populated from your eBay store with your
custom categories when eBay updates your Turbo Lister installation.
Select your desired Store category (if any) and click Next.
6. Get Item Specifics. 
Many products will have pre-filled data supplied by the manufacturer. In
Figure 19-7, we searched and found the item we wanted to list by using
the online Item Finder. You’re now presented with some data to confirm,
as well as a drop-down menu that offers three options: New, Refurbished,
or Used. Note that this information may vary to match your item.

Once you’ve gone through the details given here, you’ll be presented with
listing software that closely mirrors the HTML capabilities of the Sell Your
Item form (which we outline in Chapter 2).
Using Third-Party HTML Generators
It’s (third-) party time! In addition to what you can get from eBay, there are
plenty of software packages on the market that allow you to produce some
amazing HTML designs. We actually found a couple of genuinely good HTML
generators online. Have a look.
Mpire.com Launcher
We were blown away when we saw the quality of this tool — especially when
we found out it was free! You can design and list your items right from the
Mpire Web site. The point of Launcher is to familiarize you with Mpire.com’s
other services, but using Launcher is completely free. From here you get
some pretty neat capabilities:
 You can host up to 10MB of images at no charge. (That’s FREE, gratis, no
dinero!!)
 You can schedule your listings for free. Mpire will launch them on eBay
on a time schedule for you.
Figure 19-7:

255
Chapter 19: Automating with HTML Generators

 You get to use a small, but nice, selection of templates. Over and over, in
fact. You can put in your regular text just once — and use it again and
again.
This is all pretty amazing! Take a look at Figure 19-8 to see Mpire Launcher’s
Sell Your item form.
Once you’ve filled in your title and sub-title (if you wish) you can select one
of Mpire’s many colorful templates (check out the one in Figure 19-9) — or
you can select a generic one that has no extra graphics and your own images
can take center stage.
You can then input your text in an HTML generator and doll it up using the
standard buttons. At the bottom of Mpire’s form will be all your listing 
details — you can edit the items here in one swoop — then you’ve got a beau-
tiful listing ready to upload to eBay.

Debunking the Ten (or so) Online
Photography Myths
In This Chapter
 How not to mess up your pictures with bad advice
 Don’t waste your time on dressing up the picture
 Getting creative with manual camera settings
 Setting up your photo studio cheaply and reasonably
W
e began this book with the reference to “all the misinformation we’ve
seen about selling on eBay.” This chapter carries on with that theme
and plays mythbuster with some of the most common (and upsetting) selling
myths passed around by the “experts.” We’d like to take a shot at the
“experts” right here: There are “experts,” and there are experts. Just because
you are an expert writer, an expert businessman, or even an expert photogra-
pher, it does not mean that you are also an expert eBay seller. Just ask
anyone who sells products for a living on eBay.
Sellers pick up 1,001 selling nuances over time, and we like to include some 
of these as insights in our books. The “experts” who don’t sell on eBay have
to rely — not on experience — but on the truthfulness of people who inform
them. And face it: No seller ever wants to give away his or her real trade
secrets!
We put together this chapter’s list of no-nos after reading several “expert”
books about taking pictures for use on eBay (which were written by writers
and photographers, but not sellers!). Please remember that we do not recom-
mend the ideas put forth in any of these headings below. Don’t e-mail us to
complain that we told you to do any of this stuff. We didn’t. We don’t. Read
on for the reasons why.

Putting together a makeshift photo
studio from household items
Huh? Using a makeshift studio for photography makes about as much sense
to us as using newspapers for baby diapers. If you shop with a keen eye for
bargains (on eBay, of course), you can assemble a low-cost home version of 
a small professional photo studio. 
People who decide that selling online isn’t for them close out their busi-
nesses and sell perfectly good, gently-used photography tools. That’s not to
mention the individuals who understand eBay photography and make their
business selling these items. (We like to do business with little guys like us —
just be sure to check their feedback.) Be sure to shop smart and weigh the
prices against the seller’s feedback. A low-priced item plus a low-feedback
seller could equal disaster.
Note some accessories suggested in other books and our offering of reason-
ably priced alternatives: 
 Metal Clamps. Instead of using metal clamps to pull back fabric or to affix
things to your lights, why not use clothespins? Marsha bought a bunch of
them at the 99-cents store and has more than she can ever use for about
a buck! By the way, when you use clothespins to affix diffusion material
to a flood light, be sure to use wooden clothespins. Plastic clothespins
may melt, and although there’s a remote chance that wooden ones could
catch fire, there’s far less chance of self-immolation than you’d get from
melted plastic when you’re using a 100-watt bulb!
 Clear plastic shower curtains. In lieu of jury-rigging diffusion material
from a snipped-out portion of a clear plastic shower curtain affixed to
your flood light with metal clamps, why don’t you just use what the pros
use? Go online and buy a 10” x 10” or 12” x 12” diffusion gel (eBay sellers
sell them). Although these items are considered disposable by profes-
sional cameramen and photographers, Marsha has used the same lowly
piece of diffusion gel paper for months — and it shows no signs of self
destructing. 
You can buy these diffusion-gel squares for around $2 apiece, and we
think that’s a way better deal than slicing up a shower curtain! 
 Poster board. It’s been suggested that you use poster board as a back-
ground for your pictures. And it is a good idea, but only if you’re pho-
tographing a few items. Marsha used poster board when she first started
photographing items for eBay, and it worked well. But before long, the
board starts to curl or get dirty, which necessitates replacement. If you’re
shooting enough pictures you might have to replace the board every
other day or so, and that’s not very cost effective. Foamboard may be
more durable, but it isn’t bendable — and it’s quite expensive!
264
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Why not save a piece of poster board for reflecting emergency accent
light — and purchase a portable backdrop stage for your background?
Made of ABS plastic, backdrop stages are incredibly easy to clean and
always stay their true color.
 Beeswax. Nope! None of their beeswax! Some sellers use beeswax to
secure items in an irregular position for photography. For instance, when
you want to hold a piece of jewelry or a gem at a specific angle, beeswax
may be great. But we’ve found that it can often be very difficult to remove
from the object we’re photographing. Using museum putty (not the gel,
the putty!) works much better; it holds even tighter, and is so very easy
to remove from the item once we’re finished taking its picture.
You can buy a package of museum putty for about $6 on eBay, and it will
last you virtually forever.
Dressing up your pictures for 
more appealing images
Yeah, well . . . no. Although dressing up items for a picture may sound like a
great idea, it’s not even a good one. In her early days working on retail holi-
day catalogs, Marsha thought that “dolling up the shot” with some decorative
gewgaw was a great idea, too — until one day a photographer actually ques-
tioned what it was she was supposed to photograph. From that point, extra-
neous photo décor became limited to minimal greenery in the backgrounds.
Take a look at the picture shown in Figure 20-1. A prospective buyer might
think that the background decorations are also part of the item for sale. Not
dolling up your photo means this:
 No filling the wine glasses you’re selling because it looks cute: When
you do so, the buyer can’t see whether there’s any damage in the glass.
 No putting flowers in the vase because they’re pretty: Again, you’d be
obscuring important parts of the vase itself.
 No clumsy accessories in the picture: This is true no matter how homey
you think they make your picture look.
These photos are quick pictures of merchandise for sale — not works of art.

Chapter 20: Debunking the Ten (or so) Online Photography Myths

Saving time by taking a 
picture of one in a set
We found this one-in-a-set advice to be particularly offensive. The advice
seemed to say that if you have a set of six items, why photograph all six?
Instead, just shoot a picture of one and tell prospective buyers that there are
six because “they all look the same.”
So why is photographing just one item in a set not a good idea? Think about
it: The buyer needs to know that all the items included in the package are for
sale, and that they are all flawless and in perfect condition. You might get
around not demonstrating the items’ condition buy stating that the items are
new and in a manufacturer’s box — but why tempt fate? Shoot a picture of
the whole shebang. Figure 20-2 shows the difference in the results.

Adding fancy camera attachments 
to make up for bad lighting
Hello? If you read Part III, you know that lighting your images is not the big
deal you once thought it was. Why spend lots of money on extra camera
attachments when you can use some of the great tools we use to prevent
glare and color shifting?
At the very least, go for a full-spectrum light bulb that takes advantage of the
camera’s automatic white balance; it results in crisp, bright colors.
Using fancy backgrounds to make 
a “more interesting shot”
We swear — taking “interesting” shots is not the right idea. Looking at an
item against a busy background can be like taking an eye test: Your prospec-
tive customer needs to see the item and understand immediately what they
are looking at, without distractions. The photographic message must be
simple and clear, not complicated like the scene depicted in Figure 20-3.

Saving your image without compression
Yes, we know that if we don’t compress JPG photo files, they’ll have more
data and will also be very large. When you save your JPGs — as in the pro-
gram Fast Photos (see Chapter 16) — be sure to compress the photo to the
smallest size that still gives you an acceptable image.
If you do use image-editing programs, be sure to do any editing before com-
pressing your image. Why? Because the more pixels you have to play with
while editing, the better job you can do. Compressing a JPG should always 
be your last step.
Figure 20-4 shows you two images placed side by side for viewing online: One
image was compressed mightily and the other not so much. We challenge you
(without the obvious labels, of course) to tell which image is which. Pictures
viewed on a computer screen — especially small photos like those you find
on eBay — don’t need tons of data and high resolution.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Adjusting the f-stops and shutter speed
Using the manual settings of your camera to get a perfect shot may seem like
a peachy idea, and it really may get you a better image. But hold on a minute:
Tinkering with the manual settings is going to seriously eat into the time you
have to devote to your eBay activities.
We advocate using your time differently — for example, use it to post your
sales receipts and deposit your profits from your PayPal account. the idea is
to make the best use of your eBay-selling time.
Using bright white bulbs 
for your lighting
All we need do with this “bright white” myth is point you to the images in the
color section of this book. There you find one simple answer: Hands down,
the winner for best lighting is a full-spectrum or true-color bulb with a tem-
perature of 5000° or 5500° K and a brightness — or color-rendering index
(CRI), as noted in Chapter 12 — in the 90s.

Ten Tips for Your Auction Design
In This Chapter
 Writing your description as if there were no pictures
 Taking pictures as if there were no description
 Using color to your advantage
 Placing your pictures and text effectively
T
hroughout this book, we give you many options for making your displays
more effective — from designing your auctions (and other listings) to pre-
senting the necessary information about your merchandise and offering cus-
tomers a compelling first look at it. In this chapter, we give you our top ten
tips for designing the perfect listing.
Writing a Detailed Description
One of the most important recommendations we can give you is to write the
description for your listings as if there were no pictures. Describe your mer-
chandise in detail, noting the size of the item, the color of the item, any flaws
it may have — and don’t forget to include its uses and benefits. If you write
the description as if the pictures were not present, you probably won’t leave
out any important details — such as whether the box is included, or the
actual dimensions of the item.
Additionally, there is a technical reason for writing a detailed description of
your merchandise. Even the most reliable of services for hosting images —
including eBay Picture Services — has short-term outages. (We’ve noted that
such outages invariably happen in the last few hours of a listing’s duration,
thanks to Murphy’s Law!) Words back up pictures.
Speaking of effective backups, let’s hear it for the free picture eBay provides
when you list an item for sale! Always use it — even if you host your images
on another site and embed them in your listing description (as described in
Chapter 7). If either hosted picture suddenly becomes temporarily inaccessi-
ble for technical reasons, your customer can still view at least one of the

images. The odds are in your favor that either the hosted images or the free
picture will still be available — and that could save a sale.
In the early days of eBay (which was then called Auction Web), few listings
actually included digital pictures of the item for sale because widespread use
of digital cameras among consumers was still years away. The most success-
ful sellers were those who could write a description that painted a mental
picture with such vivid clarity that the potential buyers had no question in
their minds about what they were purchasing. Even though the tables have
turned — now the majority of listings have at least one picture — the impor-
tance of writing a detailed description has not diminished. Doubt it? Ask any
copywriter for an ad agency.
Taking Sufficient Pictures
A significant portion of this book discusses taking good pictures for your auc-
tion listings, sure — but just once more, we’d like to touch on the importance
of taking enough pictures of your items. After all, shopping online isn’t as tan-
gible as shopping in a local department store — your customer can’t pick 
up your merchandise to examine it closely. Therefore make sure that your
images make a strong enough impression to make the customers forget 
they can’t reach into the screen and pick up the item.
The task of taking multiple pictures from many different angles takes on more
importance when your merchandise is an antique or collectible item. The
condition of the item has a significant effect on the final selling price, and
though your description plays an important part in conveying the condition
of an item, multiple pictures can do the majority of the job for you.
In an earlier tip in this chapter, we suggest writing your description as if there
were no pictures. Here’s the flipside of the same idea: Take your pictures as if
there were no description. Imagine that your pictures are the only informa-
tion available for your customer to use when making their buying decision —
and take enough pictures so they have no doubt about what they are pur-
chasing, or its condition.
Using Color Only to Enhance
Color can provide a soothing break from the stark black and white of an
unenhanced listing description. But avoid overuse of color. When new sellers
first learn to change the color of their text with HTML commands, they often
go wild and change colors every sentence. (Ow. Pass the aspirin.) Severely
contrasting colors are the biggest problem, distraction, and (ultimately) turn-
off — so make sure that your colors blend smoothly subtly enough that
they’re almost not noticeable.
272
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t overuse color to the extent that the resulting description puts up a
glare that hurts your customers’ eyes when they view the page! There are far
more effective ways to convey your enthusiasm (well-crafted descriptions,
for example).
Keeping Your Customer Informed
One of the biggest mistakes new sellers make in their item descriptions is not
including all the information a customer needs. In addition to every signifi-
cant detail about the item you have for sale, each listing should include exact
shipping costs. When viewing your item, the customer should know right up
front what the final cost of the item will be, including shipping.
Although offering to provide a shipping quote is admirable, there is an inher-
ent danger in doing so. Many buyers simply move on to another listing where
all of the information is provided for them, rather than spend time haggling
about shipping and waiting for a response from the seller. Even if some
buyers do e-mail for a shipping quote, more often than not they continue to
shop in the meantime — which increases the likelihood that they’ll purchase
from another seller who specifies the shipping costs.
Be sure to include other important information for your customers, including
 What payment methods you accept
 When they can expect their item to be shipped
 What guarantees you provide
 Your return policy
Establishing Your Brand Identity
After you determine a listing layout you like — one that works for virtually all
your merchandise — use it consistently for all your listings. Doing so helps
establish a brand identity for you and the items you sell. It’s a proven tech-
nique; chain stores use the same look and layout for the items they sell. The
idea is to make return customers comfortable so they know where to go to
find exactly what they’re looking for with minimum effort. Creating a stan-
dard layout for your online listings provides the same kind of comfort for
your return customers.
273
Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Your Auction Design

Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity
A common mistake new sellers make is to include animated figures they’ve
run across that they think are cute — or include a sound file that repeats
their favorite song as long as a customer is viewing the listing. (Consider:
Does a singing plastic trout in a store make you want to buy the things right
next to it?) Remember the KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid! — principle and
don’t plaster your listings with unneeded gewgaws. After all, if you include 
all of the other practical things we’ve told you are important, your listing will
be complicated enough — but won’t come across that way. Providing infor-
mation about your merchandise is a better use of your customer’s time (and
yours).
Encouraging Multiple Purchases
If selling one item is a good thing, selling more than one to the same cus-
tomer is even better. Here are some advantages for you when a customer
makes multiple purchases:
 You can send a single, combined invoice.
 You have to prepare just one package for shipment
 You clear out more inventory with less effort.
There are several ways to encourage a customer to purchase more than one
item. The first and most effective is to provide a discount on shipping for
multiple purchases. Buyers love this option, and will often look at your other
items for sale when they notice you offer a shipping discount, even if they
were originally only interested in purchasing one item.
You can indicate any shipping discounts for multiple purchases when you 
list your item for sale on eBay. If you take advantage of this feature, eBay dis-
plays a special icon to call attention to your shipping discount, as shown in
Figure 21-1.
Including links to your other listings is a good way of encouraging a customer
to make a multiple item purchase. If you have an eBay Store, a built-in cross-
promotion feature automatically displays other items available for purchase
in your eBay Store. Which items are displayed is defined by the seller, and
using this feature wisely will also encourage your customers to consider pur-
chasing more than one item before leaving your store. Figure 21-2 shows how
the cross-promotion box displays additional items.
274
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Be sure that any links you include in your listings adhere to eBay’s Links
policy, which can be found on the following Web page:

Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Your Auction Design

If Chapter 17 hasn’t yet convinced you to open an eBay Store, perhaps you’ll
reconsider opening one, if only for the additional merchandise exposure
options that eBay automatically provides for eBay Store owners. The most
effective of these is the listing header option. This option provides a header in
each of your listings that, among other things, includes a search box that
searches only the items in your eBay Store. What better way to encourage
your customers to view other items you have available? Figure 21-3 shows an
eBay Store header embedded in a listing. (See Chapter 17 for detailed instruc-
tions on how to add this feature to your listings after you open your eBay
Store.)
Using HTML to Your Advantage
Employing HTML commands to fluff up your listings makes them look nicer,
perhaps even more colorful. But the most important reason for using HTML
in your listings is to make them more readable for your customer. 
Oddly enough, the most basic of HTML commands — the paragraph break 
( <P> ) — can have the greatest effect on the look of your listings. Take a look
at the listing shown in Figure 21-4, where no text breaks are provided.
Difficult to read, isn’t it?
Figure 21-3:

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Now look at the listing in Figure 21-5, where the information is separated by
paragraph breaks. What an improvement in readability! Remember, the goal
is twofold:
 To provide your customers with all the information they need to know
about your merchandise and your policies.
 To provide that information in the most straightforward manner.
Making the text in your listing description easy to read is a good start. Just as
important is proper placement of that information in your listing. The idea is
to take full advantage of the space available.

appropriate

277
Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Your Auction Design

Though the commands you use to ensure proper placement are a little more
complex, using tables to position images with the associated text aligned
next to them can make a big difference. This technique is especially useful
when you have multiple pictures — to show all sides of your merchandise (or
several pieces of a multi-item lot). As shown in Figure 21-6, having the pic-
tures and text interwoven (without tables) makes for a very long description
that requires the customer to scroll up and down.
Figure 21-7 shows that, with tables, the information can appear directly
beside the picture it describes, which keeps the description compact and
easy-to-read.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

We can’t emphasize this enough: Don’t forget to check your listing in multiple
browsers to be sure that the presentation in each one looks as you intend it
to look. Some browsers are more forgiving of HTML errors than are others;
what may look correct in one browser might not work at all in another.
Keeping an Eye on the Competition
Be sure to set time aside in your busy schedule to browse around the eBay
site and view other sellers’ listings. Call it research; you not only find out
what your competition is doing, but you also get ideas about what works
(and doesn’t work) in their listing descriptions.
Don’t copy another seller’s listings, or any part of them, word for word. This
sort of thing is against eBay’s rules.
The first listings you should keep an eye on are those that offer items similar
to yours (yep, your competition). In addition to making the obvious compar-
isons — such as purchase price and shipping costs — be sure to review what
may seem less-significant details. Do they charge more for shipping, or offer
only one method of shipment (and is it slower than yours)? If so, then empha-
size your preferred shipping policy in your listings.
Review your competition’s feedback; are there comments about poor packag-
ing or slow shipment? If your packages can withstand a fall down a flight of
stairs, make sure to state that in your description. What words do your com-
petitors use in their titles? Are your listings showing up at the same time as
their listings when customers search for items to purchase?
Don’t forget to look at listings other than those of your direct competitors.
Review other sellers’ listings to see what works — and (more importantly)
what doesn’t!
You can learn as much from a bad listing as you can from a good listing. For
example, watch for other sellers’ listings that use animation, audio, or video.
Take note on how long that listing page takes to load, and whether the whiz-
bang stuff comes across as annoying. The longer a page takes to load, the
greater the chance that the customer will go to another listing rather than
wait. Just as you wouldn’t put barricades around the entrance to a real-world
store, don’t put similar barricades in the way of customers who are viewing
your listings — and take note of competitors who make this mistake.
279
Chapter 21: Ten Tips for Your Auction Design

Reviewing Your Listings
After you’ve designed dozens of listings, you might start to become compla-
cent about the way they look. Don’t fall prey to this!
At first, you find yourself reviewing every listing after it’s submitted in order
to be sure that it looks the way you designed it — and okay, you should. You
should also view it in the top browsers your customers might use, to make
sure that all your information looks correct (as described in Chapter 18). But
don’t stop there . . . 
After a while, the temptation is to not review your listings after submitting
them. After all, they’ve looked fine for weeks, and you’ve not made any signifi-
cant changes to your listing format, so why waste the time checking the look
of final listing? Well . . . mistakes will happen. Easy-to-miss goofs affect your
listing layout. When editing your description, you might have accidentally
deleted one part of a pair of HTML tags. Even worse, you might have removed
a part of your shipping or payment policies. So every few weeks, take a close
look at a few of your listings to make sure they still display all the information
as you designed them to.
Last but far from least, every so often you should go to the eBay home page,
pretend you’re a buyer looking for one of the items that you’re selling, and
see what your imaginary shopping experience is like. Ask yourself what
words you would use to search for your merchandise, and then do a search
and make sure that your merchandise is displayed. Click one of your titles,
and imagine you’re viewing it for the first time. Is all the information available
that you need before you can make a decision to purchase the item? Putting
yourself in the shoes of a customer is an invaluable final step in making sure
that your listings are visible and readable.

Appendix
Mechanizing Your Sales with
Third-Party Management Tools
In This Appendix
 Deciding among the available tools
 Checking out auction-management services
 Figuring out what tasks you can automate
W
hen you get to the point of running up to 20 auctions at a time, we
highly recommend that you begin to also use a management tool. At
this level of activity, using eBay’s Selling Manager will suit you nicely, but
when your eBay business begins to push 100 listings a week, we recommend
that you get additional help in the form of auction-management services or
software — capabilities designed to handle multiple auctions efficiently.
Whether you use an online service or have software residing on your own
computer is a personal decision. Keep these overall ideas in mind as you
make that decision:
 With an online service: You may find it easier to use an online system
because you can log on to your selling information at any time from 
any computer. But if you have a slow Internet connection or pay usage
fees by the hour, managing your eBay business online can become
impractical.
 With computer-based software: You may find features that enable you
to do your work on your computer and then upload (or download) your
data when you go online. If having multiple locations to work from is not
important, and you run your eBay business from a single computer in
your office, you may feel more comfortable with a desktop-based soft-
ware product.
In either case, if your business has reached a level that cries out for an 
auction-management tool — congratulations! In this appendix, we want to
save you some time finding the service or software that’s right for you. We
outline some tasks that an auction-management product should provide, and
we compare prices of several services.

Choosing Your Auction-Management
Tools
If you searched the Internet for auction-management services and software,
you’d come up with a bunch. For simplicity’s sake, we’ve chosen to cover just
a few of these services in this appendix. After speaking to many sellers, we
found online services that offer two must-have features:
 Uptime reliability: Time, specifically uptime, is money; you don’t want
the server that holds your photos going down or mislaunching your 
auctions.
 Update reliability: Software that’s continually updated to match the
changes made to eBay keeps you current.
Using a site or software program to run your auctions takes practice, so we
suggest that you try any that appeal to you and offer free preview trials. For
each of these different applications, we provide a description and include a
link so you can check them out further.
Some software and services work on the basis of a monthly fee; others use a
one-time purchase fee. If a one-time-purchase software application is truly to
benefit you, it must have the reputation for updating its software each time
eBay makes a change in its system. The programs we discuss in this appen-
dix have been upgraded continually to date.
Most services have a free trial period. Be sure that you don’t spend a bunch
of your precious time inputting your entire inventory, only to discover you
don’t like the way the service works. Instead, input a few items to give the
service a whirl.
There’s a huge difference between auction listing software and sites and auc-
tion management products. For many a seller, listing software like eBay’s
Turbo Lister may just do the trick. Combine that with eBay’s Selling Manager
(a management program) and your eBay business will be humming along 
just fine.
When your business activity increases and you turn to an auction-management
solution for your eBay business, you should look for certain standard features
(described next). Also consider what information-management features you
currently have through your bookkeeping program. You have the data there,
regardless of whether you use it in a management solution.

Many of the products listed have several pricing tiers, so Table A-1 shows the
link to each product’s pricing page. We’ve also listed minimum price for each
company’s management products. Some offer less expensive options for list-
ing your auctions (complete with templates and all kinds of swell bells and
whistles), but the price shown in the table is for the minimum management
product.

Never choose auction-management tools by price alone. Go to the various
Web sites and take a look at everything you get for the price stated. You may
find that a service charging a bit more may just be worth it because of all the
extra tools it offers.

Appendix: Mechanizing Your Sales with Third-Party Management Tools

Looking for essential features
Here are some of the must-have features to look for when you evaluate the
offerings of auction management services and products:
 Image hosting: Some Web sites dazzle you with high-megabyte storage
numbers. But keep one thing in mind: If your average eBay image takes
up around 40 KB, you could store 128 pictures in a 5MB storage space
and about 2500 images in a 100MB storage space. Unless you’re a mega-
big-time seller, you really don’t need that much space. Your eBay images
should be archived on your computer (how about in a folder called eBay
Images). Images for current listings should be on the hosted site only
while the transaction is in progress. After the buyer has the item and all
is well, you can remove the images from the remote server.
You most likely already have free image hosting on your ISP’s Web site.
 Designing listings: The basis of most of these products is a good listing
function. You’ll be able to select from supplied templates or design your
own and store them for future use. An important feature now coming
into use is a spell checker. There’s nothing worse than a misspelling in a
listing!
 Uploading listings: Most products have a feature that launches a group
of listings to eBay all at once. They may also allow you to schedule auc-
tions to get underway at a prescribed time.
You can also expect to be able to put together your listings offline — at
your leisure — and upload them to your service when they’re ready.
Most products archive your past listings so you can relist at any time.
Many services also offer bulk relisting.
 E-mail management: You can expect to be provided with sample e-mail
letters (templates) that you can customize with your own look and feel.
The services should also offer auto-generated end-of-auction, payment
received, and shipping e-mail services.
 Feedback automation: Post feedback in bulk to a number of your com-
pleted listings, or leave predesigned feedback one by one. Some prod-
ucts support automatic feedback when a buyer leaves you positive
feedback.
 Sales reports: Some services (even the least expensive) offer you some
sort of sales analysis. Be sure to take into account how much you really
need this feature, based on data that you may already receive from
QuickBooks, PayPal, eBay Stores, or SquareTrade.
284
eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

Exploring advanced features
Depending upon the type of business you run, you may need some more
advanced features offered by management products:
 Inventory tools: Management products may allow you create inventory
records for your different products, permitting you to click a bunch to
list automatically. When an item is sold, they will deduct the items from
your inventory.
 Sales-tax tracking and invoicing: With full management, you can expect
your sales tax to be calculated into your invoices and complete line-item
invoices to be sent automatically. Multiple items, when purchased by
the same buyer, will be combined.
 Consignment tracking: If you’re a Trading Assistant, be sure to look for
a product that enables you to separately track the products you sell for
different clients. You should also be able to produce reports of consign-
ment sales by customer.
 Shipping: Most of the services will give you the option of printing your
packing lists and shipping labels directly from the product. Some of the
larger services integrate with the major shippers, allowing you to go
directly to the particular shipper’s site and ship from their software.
Table A-2 gives you the dollars and cents of subscribing to the various online
and offline services. To put together this table, we disregarded lower sub-
scription levels, where companies offered only listing products. These are the
lowest prices for products that are truly management tools.

Online or Offline Management?
You may want to run your business from any computer, anywhere in the
world. If that’s the case, you might do best with an online service. But if you
want to run your business from a fixed location, you might feel more comfort-
able with downloadable software that will handle most of the chores on your
own computer.
Online auction management sites
Auction management Web sites handle almost everything, from inventory
management to label printing. Some sellers prefer online (or hosted) manage-
ment sites because you can access your information from any computer. You
might use every feature a site offers, or you might choose a bit from column
A and a bit from column B and perform the more personalized tasks manu-
ally. Read on to determine what service might best suit your needs.
Although quite a few excellent online services for automating sales are avail-
able, we have room here to show you only a few. Many services are similar in
format, so in the following sections we point out some of the highlights of a
few representative systems. Remember that by using an online service, your
286
eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

information resides on a server out there in cyberspace; if you’re a control
freak, it may be a bit much to bear.
When selecting a service, look for a logo or text indicating that the service is
an eBay Certified Developer, Preferred Solution Provider, or API licensee. These
people have first access to eBay’s system changes and can implement them
immediately. Others may have a day or so lag time to update their software.
ChannelAdvisor
ChannelAdvisor’s founder Scot Wingo got into the auction business around
the turn of the century. His first foray into the eBay world was AuctionRover,
a site that had tools to perform an extensive eBay search, list auctions, and
check pricing trends. The company’s cute Rover logo was fashioned after
Wingo’s Border Collie, Mack.
Fast forward to today. ChannelAdvisor is a highly popular management ser-
vice for all levels of eBay sellers. They supply listing and management ser-
vices to everyone from Fortune 1000 companies to the little old lady next
door. How? They offer three levels of software: Enterprise for large busi-
nesses who want to outsource their online business, Merchant for midsized
businesses and higher-level PowerSellers, and Pro for small businesses and
individuals. These powerful software suites help eBay sellers successfully
manage and automate the sale of their merchandise.
Starting at the entry level, you can get the Pro version of ChannelAdvisor for
$29.95 a month. Here’s what they offer the beginning level seller:
 Listing design and launching: Create your listings with their standard
templates or use your own HTML to design auction descriptions. List
your items immediately or schedule a listing. ChannelAdvisor will
launch the auction when you tell them to.
 Item and inventory management: If you want to keep your inventory
online, you can create it on their system. If you want to input your inven-
tory offline, you can import it from their Excel template. You can also
import open auctions or store listings to your ChannelAdvisor account
for relisting or servicing.
 Image hosting: You get 250MB of space to host your images. You can
upload images to the site four at a time, or use FTP to upload a large
quantity.
 Post-auction management: This function merges your winning auction
information and generates customized e-mail and invoices to your
buyers. You can print mailing labels too.

MarketWorks
A group of collectors who saw the need for power tools for PowerSellers devel-
oped this highly graphical site (www.MarketWorks.com). We think they’ve
succeeded. (They were known in the eBay community as AuctionWorks, but
changed their name in June 2004.) A high percentage of eBay PowerSellers use
the site. They launch approximately two million listings on eBay every month.
MarketWorks offers help links at every turn, a first-rate online tutorial, free toll-
free support (that’s a free phone call and free support), and free interactive
training classes for registered users. Here are just a few features:
 Item and inventory management: Features the ClickLaunch Single 
Step Launcher, which launches individual items to auction while adding
them to inventory. (The site also has bulk item-launching capability.)
LaunchBots provides automated launching of your listings. You can
import existing auctions from eBay and import them with their bulk
inventory upload form in Excel and MS Access.
 Image hosting: Enables you to bulk upload 15 images at a time to their
servers. The basic account allows 100MB of storage. If your images aver-
age 30K each, you should be able to upload almost 3500 images into the
100MB image hosting space.
 Auction reporting: Generates accounts receivable, item history, and
post-sales reports from the Reports area. MarketWorks has its own
Traction System for sales and item tracking. Reports include customiz-
able views of your sales data; item and auction data; accounts receiv-
able, and sales tax by state!
 Templates and listing: MarketWorks uses their own trademarked
Ballista template listing system. You can use their predefined color tem-
plates or use their macros with your own predefined HTML template,
substituting the macros for stock areas in your template. By using their
custom ad template option and well-thought-out macros, you can take
your own HTML and make a MarketWorks template.
 Post-auction management: Sends out automated e-mail to your winners,
linking them to your own branded checkout page. If customers want to
pay with PayPal or your own merchant account, they have to link from
there. MarketWorks combines multiple wins for shipping and invoicing.
You have the option to set six different feedback comments, which you
choose at the time of posting.
MarketWorks offers all their users a StoreFront with its own URL at no addi-
tional charge. If an item sells from your StoreFront, you pay the usual 2%
commission. When you load items into inventory, you have the choice of
immediately listing them in your StoreFront. All your items are seamlessly
integrated. To get current information and sign up for a free trial, go to
www.MarketWorks.com

Dek AuctionManager
Dek was developed by eBay Titanium Power Seller David Hardin. Through his
company’s experience on eBay, he developed this service to fulfill all the
needs of a high volume eBay seller, at a flat price of $50 a month.
 Item and inventory management: Includes calendar- and time-based
(dates and times for launching) auction scheduling, automated auction
launching and relisting, the ability to import past or current auctions,
and the ability to import auction data from a spreadsheet or database.
 Image hosting: Offers space for storing pictures. You can upload bulk
images to its Web site or FTP your images directly.
 Auction reporting: Generates current running auction statistics — the
total number and dollars of current and past auctions — and an itemized
report of each auction.
 Post-auction management: Allows you to send (manually or automati-
cally) a variety of customized e-mails to winners and nonpaying bidders.
Your invoices can link directly to PayPal.
The post-auction management features also include the capability to send
automatic feedback — and to create mailing labels for each sale. If you want
to make sure that feedback isn’t posted until you’re sure the transaction is
successfully completed (wise move), you have the option of disabling the
automatic feedback feature.

Auction-management software
Many sellers prefer to run their auction businesses from their own comput-
ers. (Marsha happens to like the option of being able to reference old auc-
tions on her backups.) Luckily, some valuable auction software programs are
available to perform all the tasks you get from the online services. To those
who would rather have the software at home, there are some solid choices
other than the ones we examine in this section. You might also want to visit
these other sites for their quality auction-management software.
You can accomplish almost all the same tasks on your own computer as you
can with online services — except online auction checkout. (You can always
use eBay’s checkout as your final stop or include a link in your end-of-auction
e-mail.) If you want, you can always set up a checkout page on your own Web
site that gathers your auction information. If auction-management software
sounds like the ticket to you, here’s a quick tour of a few leading products.
289
Appendix: Mechanizing Your Sales with Third-Party Management Tools

Auction Wizard 2000
Way back in 1999, Standing Wave Software developed a product that would
handle large inventories and meet the needs of the growing eBay population.
Enter Auction Wizard. In 2000, the company introduced a more robust ver-
sion, Auction Wizard 2000, to meet the challenges presented by changes hap-
pening on eBay itself.
This software is a tour-de-force of auction management, whose pieces are
integrated into one program. Some of its special features enable you to
 Handle consignment sales. Handy way to keep track of consignment
sales by consignees, including all fees.
 Edit your images before uploading. The software allows you to import
your images, and crop, rotate, or resize those images for your auctions.
 Upload your pictures with built-in FTP software while you’re working
on your auctions. This feature eliminates the need for another piece of
auction-business software.
The program interface is straightforward. If you follow Marsha’s style (always
plunging into new programs without reading the instructions), we think you’ll
be able to use the program successfully right off the bat. It’s okay if you don’t
make it do acrobatics in the first five minutes; Auction Wizard 2000 has so
many features that not many sellers have time to study them all.
To begin using the software, simply download your current eBay auctions
directly into the program. When your auctions close, send customized
e-mails (the program fills in the auction information) and manage all your
end-of-auction business. Some sellers launch their auctions using Turbo
Lister, and then retrieve them and handle the end-of-auction management
with Auction Wizard 2000. For a 60-day free trial, go to their site at
www.auctionwizard2000.com
eBay’s Turbo Lister
We like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use. It has a built-in
WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) HTML editor and makes preparing
listings offline easy. So, when you’re ready, you can just click a button and
they’re all listed at once. You can also stagger listings and schedule them to
launch at a later date for a fee.
Finding More to Automate
Now that eBay has become a world marketplace, a single-page auction or
item listing is becoming an increasingly valuable piece of real estate. Millions
290
eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

of potential buyers view your sale — and the more auctions and fixed-price
items you can list, the better your chance to make a good living. Time is
money: You need to post your auctions quickly and accurately.
Auction posting, record keeping, inventory cataloging, photo managing, and
statistic gathering are all tasks that you can automate. The more your busi-
ness grows, the more confusing things can become. Automated tools can
help you keep it all straight. But remember that the more paid tools you use,
the more expense you may be adding to your business. Always keep your
bottom line in mind when evaluating whether to use fee-based software and
services.
You’ll have to perform certain office tasks, no matter how few or how many
auctions you’re running. Depending on your personal business style, you may
want to automate any or all of the following tasks. You may choose to use a
single program, a manual method, or some features from one program and
some from others. For folks who aren’t ready for the automated plunge, we
offer alternatives.
Setting up an auction photo gallery
Until you get your own eBay store, setting up a photo gallery is a great alter-
native. If your customers have a high-speed connection, they can browse
your auctions through photographs. Some auction-management sites host
your gallery. Some charge for this service; others do not. The best part is that
you can produce your own gallery without any fancy programs or auction-
management software — at no additional cost to you.
To make your own gallery on eBay without installing fancy scripts in your
listings, you need to do two things: test your browser, and add a bit of HTML.
So here goes: Test the following URL in your browser, substituting your own
user ID where indicated in bold italics (Figure A-1 shows you a sample of
what you will see).
http://search-desc.ebay.com/search/search.dll? MfcISAPI
Command=GetResult&query=YoureBayUserID&ht=
1&srchdesc=y&SortProperty=MetaEndSort&st=1
Now that you’ve seen a sample of your gallery, insert the following HTML into
your auction to include a link to your gallery:
291

YoureBayUserID Gallery</B> <img src=”http://
pics.ebay.com/aw/pics/ebay_my_button.gif”
alt=”My Gallery on eBay”></a>
As you can see in Figure A-2, this HTML snippet also inserts the custom eBay
button.
Sorting auction e-mail
A vital function of any auction software or system is the ability to customize
and send e-mails to your winners. Many sellers use the default letters, which
Figure A-2:
A link from
your auction
to your
gallery.
Figure A-1:
A
homemade
gallery-
linked page.
292
eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

tend to be a bit — no, incredibly — impersonal and uncaring. You must
decide whether you want the program to receive e-mail as well.
Most auction-management programs that are computer-resident (installed on
your own computer instead of requiring that you go online to do your busi-
ness) have their own built-in e-mail software. When you download your
winner information from eBay, the program automatically generates invoices
and congratulatory e-mails.
How you handle your auction-related e-mail is a personal choice. Although
Marsha currently uses eBay’s Selling Manager to send auction related e-mails,
she receives auction e-mail through Outlook, using a separate folder titled
Auctions that contains subfolders named eBay Buy and eBay Sell.
Automating end-of-auction e-mail
If you want to set up e-mails to be sent automatically after an auction ends,
you must use a software application. The software should download your
final auction results, generate the e-mail, and let you preview the e-mail
before sending it out. Many of the online sites discussed previously in this
appendix send out winner-confirmation e-mails automatically when an auc-
tion is over. That can work fine, but if you want to use this option, be sure
you set your preferences to let you preview the e-mail before sending.
Keeping inventory
Many eBay PowerSellers depend on the old clipboard or notebook method —
crossing off items as they sell them. If that works for you, great! Others prefer
to use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of inventory.
Most of the auction-management packages detailed in this appendix handle
inventory for you. Some automatically deduct an item from inventory when
you launch an auction. You have your choice of handling inventory directly
on your computer or keeping your inventory online with a service that’s
accessible from any computer, wherever you are.
Marsha handles inventory on a desktop computer through QuickBooks.
When she buys merchandise to sell and posts the bill to QuickBooks, it auto-
matically puts the merchandise into inventory. Then, when she inputs a sale,
QuickBooks deducts the items sold from standing inventory. This process
lets her print a status report whenever she wants to see how much inventory
she has left — or how much she needs to order.
293
Appendix: Mechanizing Your Sales with Third-Party Management Tools

One-click relisting or selling similar
Using auction software or an auction service speeds up the process of posting
or relisting items. After you input your inventory into the software, posting or
relisting your auctions is a mouse click away. All the auction management
software packages detailed previously in this appendix include this feature.
If you buy your items in bulk, you might want to take advantage of eBay’s free
relisting tool. By clicking the Sell Similar link (see Figure A-3) on any success-
ful listing, you can automatically relist your items. Sell Similar starts the list-
ing as new, so if it doesn’t sell, you can avail yourself of the Relist feature.
This way, if the item sells the second time, your listing (insertion fees) for 
the first listing will be credited.
Although eBay says that Sell Similar is for relisting items, it works also when
listing a duplicate of an item that has sold successfully. The only difference is
that you aren’t credited for the unsold item’s auction-listing fee.

294
eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies 

One savvy seller we know uses the eBay Sell Similar feature to post new auc-
tions. She merely clicks the Sell Similar link, and then cuts and pastes her
new information into the existing HTML format. That’s why her auctions all
have the same feel and flavor.
Scheduling listings for bulk upload
If you want to schedule the unattended launch of your auctions without
incurring eBay’s 10-cent fee, you must use an online management service
(check out the “Online auction management sites” section). If you can be at
your computer to send your auctions up to eBay singly or in bulk, you can
use the Turbo Lister application, which eBay offers at no charge.
Hosting photos
If all you need is photo-hosting, and you’ve checked out your ISP and it won’t
give you any free Web space to use (are you sure??), you can always use
eBay’s picture services to host an additional picture in each auction at 15
cents an image.
Checking out
When someone wins or buys an item, eBay’s checkout integrates directly
with PayPal and also indicates your other preferred forms of payment. If
you’re closing more than a hundred auctions a day, that’s all you need. eBay
and PayPal will also send an e-mail to you and the buyer so you can arrange
for payment.
Some online auction management services offer your own private checkout
area that costs you a percentage of your sale, so you must decide whether
your business warrants this option. A personalized winner’s notification
e-mail can easily contain a link to your PayPal payment area, making a check-
out service unnecessary.
Printing shipping labels
Printing shipping labels without printing postage can be the beginning of a
laborious two-step process. Two companies, Endicia.com and.Stamps.com,
print your labels and postage all in one step.
295
Appendix: Mechanizing Your Sales with Third-Party Management Tools

Some sites, as well as eBay’s Selling Manager, print your winner’s address
label without postage. That works well if you don’t mind carrying your pack-
ages to the post office for postage. (Why would you do that? A burning need
to stand in line?)
Tracking buyer information
Keeping track of your winners isn’t rocket science. You can do it in an Excel
spreadsheet or a Word document, both of which are exportable to almost any
program for follow-up mailings promoting future sales. If you choose to have
an online management service do this for you, be sure that you can download
the information to your computer (in case you and the online service part
ways someday).
Generating customized reports
Sales reports, ledgers, and tax information are all important reports that you
should have in your business. Online services and software supply different
flavors of these reports.
PayPal allows you to download your sales data into a format compatible with
QuickBooks, a highly respected and popular bookkeeping program. You can
also choose to download your data in Excel spreadsheet format (the down-
loads also work in Microsoft Works). PayPal reports are chock-full of intensely
detailed information about your sales and deposits. Putting this information in
a standard accounting software program — on a regular basis — makes your
year-end calculations easier to bear.
Submitting feedback
If you’re running a lot of auctions, leaving feedback can be a chore. One solu-
tion is to automate the submission of feedback through an online service or
via software. But timing the automation of this task can be tricky.
We use eBay’s Selling Manager Pro, which permits us to leave feedback auto-
matically after a positive feedback has been left for us.
Don’t leave feedback for an eBay transaction until after you’ve heard from the
buyer that the purchase is satisfactory. Leaving positive feedback immedi-
ately after you’ve received payment from the buyer is too soon. After you
receive an e-mail assuring you that the customer is satisfied, manually leav-
ing feedback by going to the feedback forum (or the item page) can be just 
as easy as bulk-loading feedback — if not easier.
