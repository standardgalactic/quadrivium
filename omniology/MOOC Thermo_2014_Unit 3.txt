Unit 3 – segment 1 

2D phase diagrams: isobars and isotherms 
Draw on a P-v diagram condensation from a superheated vapor to a 
subcooled liquid. 
 
Trickier than you thought??  What process connects the two states? 
 

P-v-T surfaces or diagrams are used in graphical, tabulated and the 
form of relations.  
The most common working fluids are water (steam), air, nitrogen, 
refrigerants, etc.  
Saturation tables only include the saturated liquid and saturated gas 
data.  You need to determine the actual state conditions for any 
quality where 0<x<1. 
Let’s look at specific volume… 
 

Unit 3 – segment 2 

Now let’s consider internal energy and enthalpy! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All thermodynamic property data are relative to a reference state.  
Since we are taking the difference between state conditions, the 
reference state cancels.   More on this later. 

But wait, there’s more! 
Introducing the specific heats, cp and cv. 
The specific heats, or heat capacities, are intensive properties of simple 
compressible substances. 
 

If you have T and P, can you fully define the state of a system if you are 
in the superheat region? 
If you have P and u, can you fully define the state of a system if you are 
in the saturation region? 
 
 

Unit 3 – segment 3 

If you have T and P, can you fully define the state of a system if you are 
in the superheat (SH) region? 
Yes!  temperature and pressure are independent in the SH region. 
If you have P and u, can you fully define the state of a system if you are 
in the saturation region? 
Yes!  pressure and internal energy are independent in the saturation 
region. 
 
 
 

Let’s follow up on those state relations for heat capacity. 
Introducing the incompressible substance model – for liquids 
and solids: 
v = constant and u = f(t) only 
 

Introducing the ideal gas model – for gases only: 
Pv = RT and u = f(T) only 
 

The compressibility factor tells us how close we are to an ideal gas. 
Z = Pv/(RT) 

By intuition, what pressure and/or temperature conditions would you 
expect the ideal gas law to fail? 

Unit 3 – segment 4 

By intuition, what pressure and/or temperature conditions would you 
expect the ideal gas law to fail? 
 
The ideal gas law fails when the conditions are close to phase change, 
or close to the dome.  That would indicate conditions of high 
pressures and low temperatures are when you should check Z. 

What does the ideal gas model tell us about the behavior of u and h? 

Polytropic processes revisited! 

Back to the conservation of energy… Now let’s consider control 
volumes where mass can pass the system boundaries. 

What is the simplified conservation of mass equation for a hose being 
used to water a garden? 

Unit 3 – segment 5 

What is the simplified conservation of mass equation for a hose being 
used to water a garden? 
 
Since the hose is being used to water the garden, we assume the system 
is steady (unvarying with time) and there is only one entrance and 
exit to the hose.   

We will assume 1D flow for all our work. 
1) All flow is normal to the boundaries at the inlet and exits 
2) All intensive properties are uniform across the inlet and exit areas. 
 
The conservation of mass is therefore: 

Let’s do an example.  Consider steam that enters a turbine at 69 bar, 538 oC with a 
velocity of 64 m/s.  The turbine is operating at steady state conditions and the 
steam leaves the turbine as a dry saturated vapor at 10 bar.  The inlet diameter 
of the turbine is 0.45 m and the outlet diameter is 3.6 m.   
Do you have enough information to determine the mass flow rate of steam through 
the turbine? 

Unit 3 – segment 6 

Let’s do an example.  Consider steam that enters a turbine at 69 bar, 538 oC with a 
velocity of 64 m/s.  The turbine is operating at steady state conditions and the 
steam leaves the turbine as a dry saturated vapor at 10 bar.  The inlet diameter 
of the turbine is 0.45 m and the outlet diameter is 3.6 m.   
Do you have enough information to determine the mass flow rate of steam through 
the turbine?  Sure! 

Let’s do an example.  Consider steam that enters a turbine at 69 bar, 538 oC with a 
velocity of 64 m/s.  The turbine is operating at steady state conditions and the 
steam leaves the turbine as a dry saturated vapor at 10 bar.  The inlet diameter 
of the turbine is 0.45 m and the outlet diameter is 3.6 m.

of the turbine is 0.45 m and the outlet diameter is 3.6 m.   
b) What is the exit velocity? 

Let’s do an example.  Consider steam that enters a turbine at 69 bar, 538 oC with a 
velocity of 64 m/s.  The turbine is operating at steady state conditions and the
