Deleting, Moving  
And Copying

We use the remove (rm) command to remove files from
our machine.
For example, rm app.js would remove the app.js file.
Note: rm DELETES FILES, there is no undo or recycling
bin to retrieve them from!  They are gone!
rm
rm <filename>
❯

To delete empty folders, we need to use the -d option
with rm.  For example, rm -d cats would remove the
cats directory (only if it's already empty)
To delete folders that are NOT empty, use the -r option.  
For example, rm -r chickens would delete the chickens
directory whether it's empty or not.
You definitely want to be careful when deleting
directories! 
deleting folders
rm -r <foldername>
❯

Use the move command (mv) to move files and
directories from one location to another.
When we specify a file or files as the source and a
directory as the destination, we are moving the files
into the directory.  
For example, mv app.css styles/  will move the app.css
file into the styles directory.
moving stuff
mv <source> <destination>
❯

Use the move command (mv) to move files and
directories from one location to another.
When we specify a file or files as the source and a
directory as the destination, we are moving the files
into the directory.  
For example, mv app.css styles/  will move the app.css
file into the styles directory.
moving stuff
mv <source> <destination>
❯

We can also use the move command to rename files
and folders.
If we specify a single file as the source and a single file
as the destination, it will rename the file. For example,
to rename the chickens.txt file to roosters.txt, we could
run mv chickens.txt roosters.txt
If we specify a single folder as the source and the
destination doesn't yet exist, it will rename the folder.
If the destination folder does exist, it will move our
source folder into the destination.
renaming
mv <current> <newname>
❯

We can use the copy command to create copies of
files and folders. 
To create a copy of sheep.txt called dolly.txt, we could
run cp sheep.txt dolly.txt 
To copy multiple files into another directory, use cp file1
file2 directory.
copying
cp <source> <destination>
