Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hat was once a consumer-grade, low-level program for beginning image
editors and a junior cousin to the powerful Adobe Photoshop pro-
gram has evolved and matured to stand on its own merits now in version 4.0.
You won’t find much comparison between Adobe Photoshop Elements and
Adobe Photoshop in this book, nor will you see any suggestions that you should
consider using Photoshop for one thing or another. We don’t make suggestions
simply because Photoshop Elements is a powerful tool that satisfies many
needs of amateurs and professionals alike.
Who should buy Elements (and ultimately this book)? The range of people
who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a vast audience.
From beginning image editors to intermediate users to more advanced amateurs
and professionals, Elements has something for everyone. We’ll even stick our
necks out a little and suggest that many Photoshop users can benefit greatly
by adding Elements to their software tool cabinet. Why? Because Elements
offers you some wonderful creation tools that Photoshop hasn’t yet dreamed
of supporting. For example, you can create postcards, greeting cards, calendars,
and photo albums with just a few mouse clicks. You can place orders with
online service centers that professionally print your photo creations. All these
opportunities are available in Elements, and we cover these and many more
creation ideas in Chapters 15 and 16.
We have to make one exception here and say that Elements is not for everyone.
The down side to the program is that version 4 is supported only on Windows.
Adobe is no longer releasing a Macintosh version, so the poor Mac users
can’t explore all the power available in this new release. Our suggestion to
the Mac users: buy a second computer. None of the Mac programs gives you
the power that you find in Elements when it comes to image editing and pack-
aging creations.
To set your frame of mind to thinking in Photoshop Elements terms, don’t
think of Elements as a scaled-down version of Adobe Photoshop. Those days
are past. If you’re a digital photographer and you shoot your pictures in JPEG
and/or camera RAW, Elements has the tools for you to open, edit, and mas-
sage your pictures into professional images. If you worry about color-profile
embedding, forget it; Elements can handle the task, as we explain in Chapter 4
(where we talk about Camera Raw format) and Chapter 14 (where we talk about
color profiling and printing). For the professional, Photoshop Elements has
just about everything you need to create final images for color printing and
commercial printing.

Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
For the beginning and intermediate users, you’ll find some of Photoshop
Elements’ quick fix operations a breeze to use to help you enhance your
images, as we explain in Chapters 9 and 10. And when it comes time to print
some homemade greeting cards, calendars, and photo albums, Elements 
provides beginners, intermediate users, and professionals easy-to-follow
steps to package your creations, as we cover in Chapters 15 and 16.
About This Book
Elements is a feature-rich program, and this book is an effort to provide a
comprehensive introduction. So although we may skip over a few little things,
all you need to know about using Photoshop Elements for designing images
for print, sharing, Web hosting, packaging in many different ways, e-mailing,
and more is covered in the pages ahead. If you’re ready to go a bit further, we
also included Bonus Chapters on this book’s Web site at www.dummies.com/
go/elements4.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone.
Hence, we know our audience is large, and not everyone will use every tool,
command, or method described in this book. Therefore we added a lot of
cross-references in the text in case you want to jump around. You can just
about go to any chapter and start reading; if some concept is dependent on
more explanation, we point you in the right direction to get some background
when it’s necessary.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are accessed.
A couple things to remember are the references for where to go when we detail
steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu command, you might see some-
thing like this:
Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
When you see commands like this, we’re asking you to click the File menu
to open the drop-down menu and then click the menu command labeled
Get Photos to open a submenu. Then, in the submenu, select the command
From Files and Folders.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, just

click the right mouse button, or as we like to say, right-click the object in
question.
Finally, a third item to remember relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard.
When we mention that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the
text looks like this:
Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S
In this case, you hold down the Alt key, Shift key, and Ctrl key and then press
the S key. Then release them all together.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into logical parts in which related features are nested
together in chapters within six different parts. The parts of the book are as
follows:
Part I: Getting Started 
If you just bought a digital camera and you’re new to image editing in a pro-
gram like Photoshop Elements, you’re probably tempted to jump into fixing
and editing your pictures. The essentials are usually not the most exciting
part on any program or book. That’s true with this book. The more mundane
issues related to understanding some basics are assembled together in the
first three chapters. Although not as exciting as many other chapters, there
are some bits of information that are critical to understand before you start
editing images. Be sure to review the first three chapters before you dive into
the other chapters.
In Part I, we talk about the tools, menus, commands, preferences, work-
spaces, and some features to help you move around easily in the program.
The more you pick up in the preliminary chapters, the easier you will adapt
to the Elements way of working. 
Part II: Getting Organized
In Part II, we talk about getting photos in Elements, organizing your files, search-
ing for files, grouping your photos, and much more information related to the
Photoshop Elements Organizer. The Organizer is your central workplace, and
knowing a lot about using the Organizer window helps you move around much
faster in the program.

Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos
This part relates to creating and manipulating selections. There’s a lot to making
selections in photos, but after you’ve figured it out (by reading Chapter 7), you
can cut out a figure in a picture and drop it into another picture, drop in differ-
ent backgrounds, or isolate an area that needs some brightness and contrast
adjustment. In Chapter 8, we talk about layers and how to create and manage
them in Elements. In many other chapters, we refer you back to the layers chap-
ter because so many of the things you do in Elements are done on layers.
In Chapter 9, we talk about fixing image flaws and problems. That picture you
took with your digital camera may be underexposed, overexposed, or may
need some work to remove dust and scratches, need a little sharpening, or
have some other imperfection that requires editing. All the know-hows and
how-tos are in this chapter.
In Chapter 10, we cover correcting color problems, brightness, and contrast.
We show you ways to quickly fix photos as well as some methods for custom
image corrections.
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist
This part is designed to bring out the artist in you. With Elements’ easy appli-
cation of filter effects, you can turn a photo image into a drawing or apply a
huge number of different effects to change the look of your image. 
In Chapter 12, we talk about drawing and painting, so you can let your artistic
expression run wild. We follow up in Chapter 13 by talking about adding text
to photos so you can create your own layouts, posters, cards, and so on.
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing
One of the most critical chapters in the book is Chapter 14, in which we talk
about printing your pictures. If your prints don’t look the way they do on your
monitor, you need to read and reread this chapter.
If screen viewing is of interest to you, we cover a number of different options
for viewing your pictures on-screen in Chapter 15. For slide shows, Web-hosted
images, animated images, viewing your photos on your TV, and even creating
movie files, this chapter shows you the many ways you can view your Elements
images on-screen.
We wrap up this part with Chapter 16, in which we cover making creations and
sharing files. You have a number of different options for making creations to
share or print.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
We wrap up the book with the Part of Tens chapters. We offer ten tips for
composing better images and ten other fun, interesting creations that you
can make with Elements, but that didn’t fit in elsewhere in the book.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you’ll see icons that indicate that some-
thing important is stated in the respective text:
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop
Elements 4.
Tips tell you about an alternate method for a procedure, a shortcut, a
workaround, or other helpful information related to working on tasks in
the section being discussed.
Pay particular attention when you see the warning icon. This information
informs about when you may experience a problem performing your work
in Elements.
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory.
Usually it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remembering
a procedure can save you time.
After all, Elements is a computer program. No matter how hard we try to 
simplify explaining features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical. When we
cover technical details that are interesting (to some) but not essential to
know, we use this icon to alert you.
Where to Go from Here
As we said before, the first part of this book is like a foundation for all the
other chapters. Try to spend a little time going through the first three chap-
ters in Part I. After that, feel free to jump around based on what you want to
accomplish, and pay special attention to the cross-referenced chapters if you
get stuck on a concept.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
H
ere you have it . . . a computer book speciﬁ-
cally designed to help you get the most out
of a computer software program — and not just
any software program, but a powerful one with
many complicated features. You probably want to
jump in and perform some spiffy editing opera-
tions to get that prize photo looking the best you
can. But there are a few basics that need to be
understood when editing your photos. 
In this ﬁrst part, we talk about some essentials to
help you fully understand all the parts ahead. We
ﬁrst talk about your Photoshop Elements working
environment and describe the many tools and fea-
tures you can use for all your Elements sessions.
We also cover the very important task of getting
color set for optimum viewing on your computer
monitor and describe some essentials you need to
know about color as it relates to photo images.
This ﬁrst part of the book contains some impor-
tant information that you should plan to carefully
review and understand before going too far into
all the Elements features. Don’t pass it up. Turn
the page and start getting acquainted with Adobe
Photoshop Elements basics.

I
n Elements’ work areas, you find quite a collection of tools, palettes, but-
tons, and options. Just a quick glance at the Elements workspace when you
enter the Standard Edit mode shows you some of the power that Elements
offers with just a click of your mouse. With all the possibilities, the Elements
workspace can be intimidating. To ease your introduction to the many options
for editing your pictures, we break them down for you in this chapter.
Elements has several work areas, and we start off by 
introducing you to the one you’ll likely use most often,
Standard Edit mode. This is the mode in which you can
be creative with all the tools and features Photoshop
Elements is known for, such as filters, drawing tools,
layers, and more. We then introduce other work areas
and tools you may not be as familiar with — Quick
Fix mode for making common corrections to photos,
Creation Setup mode for collecting your photos into
creations such as calendars, and the Photo Bin for
navigating among all your open images.
Before you start working in Elements, you’ll find it helpful
to know how to undo edits so you can start over easily and
where you can find additional sources of help within Elements.
We also explain one of the handiest ways to select tools and enter
common commands — keyboard shortcuts.

10
Part I: Getting Started 
Elements also includes the Organizer, a powerful tool for acquiring your images
and keeping them organized. The Organizer includes features that help you
view and search for images, too. We introduce the Organizer in Part II.
Getting Around in Standard Edit Mode
Standard Edit mode offers bundles of tools for editing your images, from cor-
rection tools for fixing color and clarity to filters, layers, and more for creating
entirely original images either from existing photos or from scratch. But all
these tools also make Standard Edit mode complex.
Figure 1-1 shows Elements in Standard Edit mode, highlighting all the tools
and features we discuss in the sections that follow.
Jumping to Standard Edit mode
You can move into Standard Edit mode in a couple of ways:
 From the initial Welcome screen, click Edit and Enhance Photos and
open a photo. Your Elements window appears in Standard Edit mode,
as shown in Figure 1-1.
 From the Organizer, click Edit in the Shortcuts Bar and select Go to
Standard Edit from the drop-down menu. 
Examining the Image window
Not surprisingly, the Image window’s tools and features are most useful when
an image is actually open in the window. To get an image into the image window
(refer to Figure 1-1), follow these steps:
1. Click the Open tool in the Shortcuts bar.
The standard Open dialog box appears. It works like any ordinary Open
dialog box you find in other applications.
2. Move around your hard drive by using methods you know to open
folders and select a picture.
If you haven’t yet downloaded digital camera images or acquired scanned
photos and want an image to experiment with, you can use an image
found in your My Pictures folder that was installed with Windows.
3. After selecting a picture, click Open.
The photo opens in a new image window in Elements.

Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements workspace shown when you open a file in Standard Edit mode.
You can open as many image windows in Elements as your computer memory
can handle. As each new file is opened, a thumbnail image is added to the
Photo Bin at the bottom of the screen, and the image windows are stacked,
with the current active image on the topmost window. To bring another open
file to the foreground and make it active, click the respective thumbnail in the
Photo Bin.

Part I: Getting Started 
Here’s a quick look at important
items in the image window, shown
in Figure 1-2:
 Scroll bars become active
when you zoom in on an image.
You can click the scroll arrows,
move the Scroll bar, or grab the
Hand tool in the Tools palette
and drag within the window to
move the image around.
 The Magnification box shows
you at a glance how much you’ve
zoomed in or out.
 The Information box shows
you a read-out for a particular
tidbit of information. You can
choose what information you
want to see in this area by
choosing one of the options
from the pop-up menu, which
we discuss in more detail later in this section.
When working on an image in
Elements, you always want to
know the physical image size,
the image’s resolution, and the
color mode (these terms are
explained in more detail in
Chapters 3 and 4). Regardless of
which menu option you choose
in the status bar, you can get a
quick glimpse at these essential
stats by clicking the Information
box, which displays a pop-up
menu like the one shown in
Figure 1-3.
 The Size box enables you to resize the window. Move the cursor to the
box and a diagonal line with two opposing arrows appears. When the
cursor changes, drag in or out to size the window smaller or larger.
You can also resize the window by dragging any of the other corners in
or out.
 Click the Minimize button (the _ button in the upper-right corner of the
image window) and the window hides from view. It’s still open; you just
click the image in the Photo Bin to maximize the window.

Figure 1-2: The image window displays an open
file within the Elements workspace.
Figure 1-3: Click the readout in the status bar
and a pop-up menu shows you important
information about your file.

 If you click the Maximize button (the button with the box-shaped icon),
the Title bar shown at the top of the window disappears and provides
you a little more room for viewing images in the window.
 You can click the Close button (it’s shaped like an X) to close the active
image window and keep Elements open. Alternatively, you can use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+W or menu command File➪Close to close the
active window.
Now that you’re familiar with the
image window overall, we want to
introduce you to the Information
box’s pop-up menu, which enables
you to choose the type of information
you want to view in the Information
box. Click the right-pointing arrow
to open the menu, as shown in
Figure 1-4. Here’s the lowdown on the
options you find in the pop-up menu:
 Document Sizes: Shows you the saved file size.
 Document Profile: Shows you the color profile used with the file.
 Document Dimensions: Shows you the physical size in your default unit
of measure, such as inches.
 Scratch Sizes: As shown in Figure 1-4, displays the amount of memory
on your hard drive that is consumed by all documents open in Elements.
For example 20M/200M indicates that the open documents consume
20 megabytes, and a total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements
to edit your images. As you add more content to a file — such as adding
new layers, the first figure grows while the second figure remains static.
 Efficiency: This indicates how many operations you are performing in
RAM as opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%,
you are working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you are
using the scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good
indication that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency.
 Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
 Current Tool: Shows the name of the current tool selected from the
Tools palette.
 32-bit Exposure: This menu command provides you an option for adjust-
ing the preview image for viewing a High Dynamic Range (HDR) document
on your monitor.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing
to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at will
during your editing sessions.

Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area
Figure 1-4: From the pop-up menu in the status
bar, you select commands that provide
information about your file.

14
Part I: Getting Started 
Moving through the Menu bar
Like just about every program you launch in Windows, Elements supports
drop-down menus. The menus are logically constructed and identified to 
provide commands for working with your pictures (commands that you
don’t find supported in tools and palettes). A quick glimpse at the menu
names gives you a hint of what might be contained in a given menu list.
The ten different menus are as follows:
 File menu: Just as you might suspect, the File menu contains commands
for working with your picture as a file. You find commands for saving,
opening, processing, importing, exporting, and printing in the menu list.
We cover saving files in Chapter 3 and printing or exporting for other
output in Part V.
 Edit menu: As you might guess, the old-fashioned Copy/Cut/Paste 
commands are located here. Additionally, you have some important
file settings commands in the menu, including preferences, which we
cover in more detail in Chapter 2.
 Image menu: You find yourself in the Image menu when you want to affect
changes to the entire image, such as changing a color mode or cropping,
rotating, and resizing images. For details about sizing and color modes,
check out Chapter 3. For more about cropping and rotating images, flip
to Chapter 9.
 Enhance menu: Just the name of this menu should tell you what 
commands to expect here. This is where you go to change image 
appearances, such as changing the brightness and contrast, adjusting
color and lighting, and doing some smart fix-up work to improve image
appearance. In Chapters 9 and 10, you find out how to use correction
tools so your images look their best.
 Layer menu: As we describe in great detail in Chapter 8 (a whole chapter
just about layers), most kinds of editing you do in Elements are best han-
dled using layers. Elements neatly tucks away all the relevant commands
associated with working in layers right here.
 Select menu: Of just about equal importance to layers is working with
selections. Whereas the Image menu contains commands that are applied
to the entire image, you can edit isolated areas of images by using the
commands in the Select menu. In order to isolate an area, you need to
create a selection, as we explain in Chapter 7. This menu contains com-
mands to help you with all the essential tasks related to working with
selections.
 Filter menu: The Filter menu is where you leave the world of photogra-
phy and explore the world of a fine artist. With tons of different filter
commands, you can create some extraordinary effects. Find out all
about filters in Chapter 11.

 View menu: Zooming in and out of images, turning on a grid, exposing
horizontal and vertical rulers, adding annotations, and checking out the
print size of your pictures are handled in the View menu. Chapter 5
unearths secrets of the Zoom tool, rulers, and more.
 Window menu: Elements supports a number of different palettes, as we
explain later in this chapter. Elements has so many palettes, keeping them
all open at one time is impractical. Thanks to the Window menu, you can
easily view and hide palettes, reopen the Welcome window, tile and cas-
cade open windows, and bring an inactive window to the foreground.
 Help menu: Hopefully, you get all you need right here in this book; but
just in case we miss something (or the neighbor has borrowed it, fine
book that it is), you have some interactive Help right at your mouse-tip
in the Help menu. The menu also offers links to Adobe’s Web site for
more information and a little assistance, courtesy of the tutorials acces-
sible in this menu. (Find a little more detail about accessing help later in
this chapter.)
Uncovering the context menus
Context menus are common to many programs, and Photoshop Elements
is no exception. They’re those little menus that appear when you right-
click, offering commands and tools related to whatever area or tool you 
right-clicked.
The context menus are your solution when you may be in doubt about where
to find a command in a menu. You just right-click an item, and a pop-up menu
opens. As you become familiar with 
Photoshop Elements and you find 
yourself struggling to find a menu 
command, always try to first open 
a context menu and look for the 
command you want in the menu list.
Because context menus provide 
commands respective to the tool 
you’re using, the menu commands 
change according to what tool or 
feature you are using at the moment 
you open a context menu. For exam-
ple, in Figure 1-5, you can see the 
context menu that appears after 
we create a selection marquee and 
right-click that marquee in the Image 
window. Notice that the commands 
are all related to selections.

16
Part I: Getting Started 
Using the Tools palette
Elements provides a good number of palettes for 
different purposes. The one you’ll find you use most
is the Tools palette. In palette hierarchy terms, you
typically first click a tool in the Tools palette and
then use another palette for additional tool options or
use the Options bar for fine-tuning your tool instru-
ments. More often than not, clicking a tool in the
Tools palette is your first step in most editing 
sessions.
Tools can be easily accessed in Elements by pressing
shortcut keys on your keyboard. For a quick glance at
the Tools palette and the keystrokes needed to access
the tools, look over Figure 1-6.
If you accidentally press the Tab key on your key-
board, the Tools palette hides from view. Press Tab
again and the Tools palette reappears.
Notice in the Tools palette that several tools appear
with a tiny arrow pointing right and downward on
the lower-right corner of each tool. Whenever you
see this arrowhead, remember that more tools are
nested within that tool group. Click a tool with an
arrowhead and hold the mouse button down. A pop-
up toolbar opens, as shown in Figure 1-7, and offers
you more tool selections within that group.
To select tools within a tool group by using key-
strokes, press the Shift key and strike the respective
key (shown in Figure 1-6) to access the tool. Keep the
Shift key down and repeatedly press the shortcut key
to scroll through all tools in a given group.
The shortcuts work for you at all times except when
typing text. Be certain to click in the Tools palette to
select a tool if your last edit was made with one of
the Type tools.
The tools are varied, and you may find that you won’t use all the tools in the
Tools palette in your workflow. Rather than describe the tool functions here,
we address the tools in the remaining chapters in this book as they pertain to
the respective Elements tasks.

a tool that has a tiny arrowhead, and a pop-up

Playing with palettes
Elements provides you with a bunch of palettes that contain settings and
options used to refine the tools you select in the Tools palette and tasks you
perform to edit images. As an example of how a palette is used, assume for a
moment that you want to let your creative juices loose and create a Picasso-
esque painting — something that you can easily do in Photoshop Elements.
You first click the Brush tool and then click a color in the Color Swatches
palette. On a new canvas, you begin to paint. When you want to change color,
you click again in the Color Swatches palette on a different color. This kind of
interactivity between the Tools palette and another palette is something you
will frequently use in Elements.
Palettes are accessed from either the Palette Bin or from the Window menu.
Many options in palettes are intuitive. To become familiar with various palette
options, just poke around a little, and most of the options will become famil-
iar to you.
Selecting tool options from the Options bar
When you click a tool in the Tools palette, the Options bar offers you choices
specific to a selected tool. Figure 1-8 shows the options available when the
Clone Stamp tool is selected.
Figure 1-8: The Options bar provides attribute choices for a tool selected in the Tools palette.

Part I: Getting Started 
Juggling all your interface options
With all the settings you can use for any given tool, it can become downright
frustrating trying to figure out exactly where to select an option for the edit
you want to make. To help simplify the process of using tools and selecting
options for the tools, here’s what you might do in a normal workflow:
1. Select a tool in the Tools palette.
Obviously, you need to know what task you want to perform, so select-
ing the proper tool to complete the task is important to know up-front.
2. Take a quick look at the Options bar.
Before moving to other options choices, be certain you look over the
choices in the Options bar. If you want to use a tool like the Brush tool or
the Clone Stamp tool, perhaps you want to make a decision about what
size brush tip you want to use. This choice is specific to the selected
tool and therefore appears as an Options bar choice.
3. Open a palette for more options.
If you, for example, want to use the Brush tool to apply some color to an
image, after selecting the Brush tip in the Options bar, open the Color
Swatches palette and select a color.
4. Open the More menu.
Maybe the color you want to use doesn’t appear in the Color Swatches
palette. Your next stop is the More menu. From the menu choices, you
can load different swatch libraries that provide more color options.
Try following the same sequence when you want to edit images in Elements
by first selecting a tool, then checking out the Options bar, opening palettes
related to providing choices for the task at hand, and finally clicking the More
button for additional choices in the palettes.
Looking at the Shortcuts bar
You find the Shortcuts bar just above the Options bar and below the Menu
bar. The Shortcuts bar, shown in Figure 1-9, serves two purposes. Tools in the
Shortcuts bar are available for quick access to some of the most common
tasks you perform in Elements. Secondly, buttons appear for quick access
to Elements’ other functions that involve organizing documents, browsing
photos, or viewing a calendar.

Figure 1-9: In Standard Edit mode, the Shortcuts bar provides tools and viewing options.
Depending on your editing mode, such as Standard Edit, Quick Fix, or one of
the other viewing modes, the Shortcuts bar changes to provide different tools
and buttons. Figure 1-9 shows how the Shortcuts bar appears when viewed in
Standard Edit mode.
The Shortcuts bar contains tools and buttons grouped together as follows:
 The first group offers quick access to file management commands. You
can create a new file, open a file, or save a file by clicking one of the first
three tools in the Shortcuts bar.
 Click the Print tool to print a file or the Attach to E-mail tool to attach
an open document to a new e-mail message in your default e-mail 
program.
 Click Undo to undo an edit and Redo to redo an undone edit.
 For a quick jump to all the wonderful organizing features provided in
Elements, such as creating slide shows, calendars, and postcards or
writing to video discs, click the Create button. Click Photo Browser to
open the Photo Browser window, where you can easily manage your 
pictures. The Date View shows you a calendar, where you can add
thumbnails of your pictures.
Changing Workspaces
When you’re in Standard Edit mode, discussed in preceding sections, you can
apply any kind of edits to a picture, improve the appearance, and apply all
that Elements offers you. This mode is the richest editor in Elements in terms
of accessing all features. Because Elements has so many different kinds of edit-
ing opportunities, the program offers you other workspace views, tailored to
the kinds of tasks people typically want to perform.

Using Quick Fix mode
The Quick Fix mode is designed to provide you with just those tools that are
needed to prepare a picture for its intended destination, whether it be print-
ing, on-screen viewing, or one of the other organizing items. Use this mode to
make your pictures look good. You won’t find tools for adding text, painting
with brushes, or applying gradients in Quick Fix mode. Rather, what you find
is a completely different set of palettes for balancing contrast and brightness,
lighting, sharpening, and so on. This mode is like having a digital darkroom
on your desktop, where you take care of perfecting an image like you would
in analog photography darkrooms.
To enter the Quick Fix mode while you are in Standard Edit mode, click the
Quick Fix button adjacent to the Shortcuts bar; the view changes, as shown
in Figure 1-10.
If you want to start up Elements in Quick Fix mode, click the Quick Fix button
in the Welcome screen when you first launch the program.
There are several differences between Standard Edit mode and Quick
Fix mode:
 Completely different sets of palettes are docked in the Palette Bin.
All the palettes in Quick Fix mode are related to adjusting brightness
controls and are designed to improve the overall appearance of your 
pictures. In addition, all the Window menu commands for accessing
palettes are grayed out. While you work in Quick Fix mode, Elements is
insistent on limiting your use of palettes to just those palettes docked in
the Palette Bin. Moreover, you cannot undock palettes from the Palette
Bin by dragging them out, as you can in other modes.
 The Tools palette disappears. Quick Fix mode offers you only the Zoom
tool, Hand tool, Genie Brush tool, Crop tool, and Red Eye Removal tool
in the Tools palette. None of the other Elements tools are accessible
while you work in this mode.
 Multiple viewing options are available. Notice in Figure 1-10 that there
are two views of the same image. One view displays the raw, unedited
image. The After view shows you the results of changes you make with
palette options and menu commands.
If you want to return to the Standard Edit mode, click the Standard Edit
button.

Figure 1-10: Click Quick Fix in Standard Edit mode, and the workspace changes.
Using Creation Setup
To organize your pictures for display in a variety of different ways, you begin
by accessing the Creation Setup window. While in either Standard Edit or
Quick Fix mode, click the Create button on the Shortcuts bar. The Creation
Setup window opens, as shown in Figure 1-11.
We cover each option available in the Creation Setup window in greater detail
in Chapter 16.

Figure 1-11: Click Create in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode to open the Creation Setup window.
Using the Photo Bin
The Photo Bin displays thumbnail views of all your open images. Regardless
of whether you work in Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode, you can immedi-
ately see a small image of all the pictures you have open at one time, as
shown in Figure 1-12. You can also see thumbnail views of all the different
views you create for a single picture. Find out all the details in the sections
that follow.

Figure 1-12: All open pictures and new views are displayed as thumbnails in the Photo Bin.
If you want to rearrange the thumbnails in the Photo Bin, just click and drag
horizontally to reorganize the order of the thumbnails.
Creating different views of an image
What? Different views of the same picture, you say? Yes indeed. You might
create a new view when you want to zoom in on an area for some precise
editing and then want to switch back to a wider view. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click an image’s thumbnail in the Photo Bin.
The respective photo appears in the image window as the active 
document.
2. Choose View➪New Window for <filename>.
Note that <filename> is the name of the file in the image window.
3. Zoom to the new view.
A new view appears for the active document, and you see another
thumbnail image added to the Photo Bin.
To zoom quickly, click the Zoom tool and click a few times on the picture
in the image window to zoom into the photo.
4. Toggle views of the same image.
Click one thumbnail and you see the opening view; click the other
thumbnail and you see the zoomed view.
Hiding the Photo Bin
The Photo Bin takes up a lot of room at the bottom of the image window,
and you’re not likely to want it open all the time while editing some pictures.
Fortunately, Elements provides you with two methods for hiding the Photo
Bin when you want to create a little more editing real estate.
23
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

24
Part I: Getting Started 
To temporarily hide the Photo Bin, do one of the following:
 Place the cursor over the separator bar between the Image window
and the Photo Bin. When the cursor changes to two horizontal lines
with vertical opposing arrowheads, drag down to collapse the Photo Bin.
When the bin is collapsed, drag the separator bar up to open the bin.
 To auto-hide the Photo Bin, open a context menu (right-click inside the
Photo Bin) and select Auto-hide from the menu choices. (Alternately,
you can just click the separator bar where you see the tiny arrowhead
to show/hide the bin.) When you use Auto-hide, the Photo Bin automati-
cally hides when the cursor appears in the image window. The Photo Bin
automatically opens when you move the cursor below the separator bar.
Retracing Your Steps
Ever since Apple Macintosh brought a windows interface to the masses, the
Undo command has been one of the most frequently used menu commands
in every program developed. You make a change to your document, and if you
don’t like it, you simply choose Edit➪Undo or press the keyboard shortcut,
Ctrl+Z.
In Elements, your options to undo your work have expanded, as we explain in
the following sections.
Using the Undo History palette
Elements takes the Undo command to new levels by offering you a palette in
which all your changes (well, almost
all) in an editing session are recorded
and available for undoing at any step
in an editing sequence.
Each edit you make is recorded in
the Undo History palette. To open
the palette, choose Window➪Undo
History. Make changes to your docu-
ment, and each step is recorded in
the palette, as you see in Figure 1-13.
If Elements slows down, and you’re
moving along at a snail’s pace, open
the More drop-down menu in the
History palette and select Clear
Undo History. Elements flushes all
the recorded history and frees up
some precious memory that often
enables you to work faster.
Figure 1-13: The History palette records steps
in an editing session.

We said almost all steps are recorded because the number of steps the
History palette can record is controlled by a preference setting that tops
out at 1,000 steps. If you choose Edit➪Preferences and look at the General
preferences, as we explain in more depth in Chapter 2, the number of
history states defaults to 50. You can change the number to the maximum
of 1,000 if you like. But realize that the more history states you record, the
more memory Elements requires.
To undo the last edit, you can use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl+Z. When you
want to undo multiple edits, open the Undo History palette and click any item
listed in the palette. Elements takes you to that last edit while scrubbing all the
edits that follow the selected item. If you want to bring them back, just click
again on any step appearing grayed out in the palette to Redo up to that level.
All your steps are listed in the Undo History palette as long as you remain in
Elements and don’t close the file. When the file is closed, all the history infor-
mation is lost.
Reverting to the last save
As you work away in Elements, you should always plan on saving your work
regularly. Each time you save in an editing session, the Undo History palette
preserves the list of edits you made prior to the save and up to the maximum
number of history states defined in the General preferences.
If you save, then perform more edits, and then want to return to the last
saved version of your document, Elements provides you a quick, efficient
way to do so. Choose Edit➪Revert, and Elements eliminates your new edits
and takes you back to the last time you saved your file.
When you choose Revert, the word Revert appears in the Undo History palette.
You can eliminate the Revert command from the Undo History palette by right-
clicking Revert in the Undo History palette and choosing Delete from a context
menu. This returns you to the edits made subsequent to the last save.
Getting a Helping Hand
You can reach for this book when you want some details about accomplishing
a task while working in Elements. However, for those little annoying moments,
and just in case some coffee stains blot out a few pages in this book, you may
want to look for an alternative feature description from another source. 
Rather than accumulate a library of Elements books, all you need to do is look
at Elements itself to find some valuable help information quickly and easily. If
you’re stuck on understanding some feature, you’ll find ample help documents
a mouse click away that can help you overcome some frustrating moments.
25
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

26
Part I: Getting Started 
Using Help
Your first stop for exploring the helpful information Elements provides you
is in the Help menu. Here, you find several menu commands that offer you
information:
 Photoshop Elements Help: Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or
press the F1 key to open the Elements Help file. You can type in a search
topic and press Enter to open a list of items that provide helpful infor-
mation on the searched words.
For quick access to the Help document, type the text you want to search
into the text box on the right side of the menu bar in Standard Edit or
Quick Fix mode.
 Glossary of Terms: As you read this book, if we use a term that you
don’t completely understand, open the Photoshop Elements glossary.
Here, you find definitions of terms commonly used in photography and
image editing, as well as terms related specifically to Elements.
 Tutorials: If you want to explore some advanced learning, check out the
online tutorials provided by Adobe Systems.
 Photoshop Elements Online: This menu command launches your default
Web browser and takes you to Adobe’s Web site, where you can find
information about Elements, problems reported by users, and some
workarounds for getting a job done.
Using PDFs from the installation CD
A number of bonus files are stored in PDF form on your installation CD.
PDF files require the free Adobe Reader program or one of the commercial
Acrobat viewers. Adobe Reader can be installed from the CD during your
installation process.
Depending on when you purchased your Elements installer CD, the version of
Adobe Reader on the CD might be outdated. If you want to stay with the latest
upgrade of Adobe Reader, open your Web browser and type this address in
the Location bar: 
www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html
Adobe Systems provides easy, step-by-step instructions for downloading the
most current, free Adobe Reader program and installing it on your computer.

Using ToolTips
As you move your cursor around tools and palettes, pause a moment before
clicking the mouse. A slight delay in your actions produces a ToolTip, as
shown in Figure 1-14. Elements provides you this sort of dynamic help as you
move the cursor around the workspace and pause before moving to another
location.
Figure 1-14: Place the cursor over a tool and pause a moment to open a ToolTip.
Using the How To palette
The default Palette Bin in Standard Edit mode contains the How To palette at
the top of the bin. The How To palette lists some of the more common tasks
you are likely to perform in Elements. Click the right-pointing arrowhead to
expand a list and then click an item to open help information in the palette.
You can scroll pages by clicking the arrows, return to the opening How To
page by clicking the house icon, and print a topic by clicking the printer icon
if you want to create hard copy of some help information.
Taking Charge with Shortcuts
As Emeril says, “It’s time to kick it up a notch.” Kicking it up a notch in
Elements terms means leaving the pick and poke editing methods of the
novice and graduating to techniques used by the swift keyboard master.
Using keyboard shortcuts greatly reduces your time in Elements and makes
you much more proficient. The up side is that most of what you can do by
moving the mouse and clicking a tool or menu command can be performed
right from your keyboard by using combinations of keystrokes. The down
side is that, because there are so many keyboard shortcuts to remember,
learning all of them is nearly impossible.
The best way to remember keyboard shortcuts is to practice using them. After
that, you might want to browse the resources where shortcuts are defined.
27
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the Work Area

28
Part I: Getting Started 
Here are some considerations to help you remember shortcuts and find more
information about them:
 For common tasks, always take special note of ToolTips and com-
mands in a menu. ToolTips provide a description of what a tool does,
and they often display the keyboard shortcuts used to access the tools.
Menu commands that support keyboard shortcuts list the shortcut keys
to the right of command names.
 Look over all the tips and alternate methods for performing an action
that we describe throughout this book. As you are introduced to more
features in Elements, we try to offer you the keyboard shortcut options
as well as tools and commands. Instead of giving you a list here, we pro-
vide keyboard shortcuts when explaining a feature.
 Search the Help document. Open the Elements Help document (Help➪
Photoshop Elements Help or press F1) and search for keyboard shortcuts.
The Help document provides a comprehensive list of all the keyboard
shortcuts you can use in Elements.
 Stick with the essentials. Try to commit to memory only those short-
cuts that produce actions for your most common editing tasks.
The Cheat Sheet at the front of this book lists some common keyboard short-
cuts so that you can reference them quickly and easily.
Memorizing keyboard shortcuts is not critical to your work in Photoshop
Elements. You can do everything the program was designed for without ever
using a shortcut. However, when you become familiar with keyboard short-
cuts, you’ll find yourself zooming through editing sessions with much more
speed and efficiency. As a matter of fact, many advanced and professional
users often forget where a menu command is contained because they rely
so much on shortcut keys.

A
lthough not as exciting as firing up Elements and working on your pre-
cious pictures, customizing Elements for your personal work habits and
properly setting up color management is critical to everything else you do in
the program. This chapter explains how to take charge of Elements and 
customize your work environment by adjusting preference settings and 
setting up a color management system. If you’re new to Elements or
image editing in general, you might not know just how you want
to set up certain features right away. However, you can
always refer to this chapter and review and update set-
tings and options later as you become familiar with
other features in Elements.
Controlling the Editing Environment
Opening Elements for the first time is like moving
into a new office. Before you begin work, you need to
organize the office. At a minimum, you need to set up
the desk and computer before you can do anything. In
Elements terms, the office organization is specifying
Preference settings. Preferences are settings that provide a
means to customize your work in Elements and to fine tune the
program according to your personal work habits.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
What we offer here is a very brief description of what preference options are
available to you. When you need some detail regarding one preference option
or another, look at the help documents we discuss in Chapter 1. Use the help
documents as a reference and you won’t need to memorize the vast number
of settings Elements provides you.
Launching and navigating Preferences
Preferences are all contained in a dialog box that’s organized into ten panes.
By default, when you open the Preferences dialog box, the opening pane is the
General pane. To open the Preferences dialog box, do one of the following:
 Choose Edit➪Preferences.
 Press Ctrl+K.
Using either method opens the dialog box to the General preferences pane, as
shown in Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: The General preferences dialog box.
In Figure 2-1, you see a number of items that are common to all preference
panes. Here’s a quick introduction to what these items are and how they work:
 Drop-down pane menu: Click the topmost downward-pointing arrow and
you see all the individual panes listed. You can select from the menu to
jump to another pane.
 OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane.

 Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the same settings as when you opened
a pane. If you hold down the Alt key, the Cancel button changes to Reset
and performs the same action as clicking the Reset button.
 Reset: If you change the settings options and click Reset, the action takes
you back to the same settings as when you opened the Preferences
dialog box. 
 Learn about Preferences: Click the blue text and the Adobe Help Center
opens where you find help information that’s specific to this dialog box.
 Prev: Switches to the previous pane.
 Next: Switches to the next pane.
You can also press Ctrl+(1 through 0 keys) to jump to another pane.
All these options are available regardless of the pane in view.
Checking out all the Preferences panes
The settings in the Preferences dialog box are organized into different panes,
that reflect key categories of preferences. The following list briefly describes
the types of settings you can adjust in each of the Preferences panes:
 As the name implies, General preferences apply to overall general set-
tings you adjust for your editing environment.
 Saving Files preferences relate to options available for saving files. You
can choose to add extensions to filenames, save files with layers or flat-
ten layers when saving a file (as we explain in Chapter 8), save files with
image previews that appear when viewing files as icons on your desktop,
and save with some compatibility options.
 Display and Cursor preferences offer options for how certain tool cursors
are displayed and how you view the Crop tool when cropping images.
 Working with the Transparency preferences requires an understanding
of how Elements represents transparency. Imagine painting a portrait
on a piece of clear acetate. The area you paint is opaque and the area
surrounding the portrait is transparent. To display transparency in
Elements, you need some method to represent transparent areas
(Chapter 7 has more details). Open the Transparency preferences and
you make choices for how transparency is viewed in your 2-D Elements
environment.
 Units and Rulers preferences let you specify settings for ruler units,
column guides, and document preset resolutions.
31
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

32
Part I: Getting Started 
 The Grid preferences offer options for gridline color, divisions, and 
subdivisions. A grid shows you nonprinting horizontal and vertical lines.
You use a grid to align objects, type, and other elements. You can snap
items to the gridlines to make aligning objects much easier.
 The Scratch Disks preferences contains options for selecting scratch
disks. Assume you have 100MB of free RAM (your internal computer
memory), and you want to work on a picture that consumes 200MB of
hard disk space. Elements needs to load all 200MB of the file into RAM.
Therefore, an auxiliary source of RAM is needed in order for you to work
on the image; Elements uses your hard drive. When a hard drive is used
as an extension of RAM, we call this source a scratch disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connected to your computer, you
can instruct Elements to use all hard drives, and you can select the order
of the hard drives Elements uses for your extension of RAM. All disks and
media sources appear in the drop-down menus you see for First, Second,
Third, and Fourth.
Don’t use USB external hard drives or other drives with connections
slower than FireWire. Using slower drives will actually slow the perfor-
mance of Elements.
 Memory — and the need to conserve and manage it well — is important
to Elements. Yet another preference item for managing memory is the
Memory & Image Cache settings.
Cache is a memory location on your hard drive that Elements uses to
remember things like image levels, screen redraws, and histogram dis-
plays. (We explain more about using histograms in Chapters 4 and 10.)
When one of these items is loaded in memory, it is stored in a cache
location. The next time you use the same operation, Elements pulls
the item from the cache. The result is much faster access to frequently
used items.
You can set the cache level from 0 to 8 by typing a number in the text
box. Setting the number to a lower value can help you free up memory
so you can work on large images. If you have a lot of RAM and hard-drive
memory to work with, caching is not a concern; you can set the cache to
8 for faster operations.
 Type preferences provide options for setting text attributes. You have
options for using different quote marks, showing Asian characters, show-
ing font names in English, and previewing font sizes.
 When you open the Organize & Share preferences pane, you lose the
Preferences dialog box, and another Preferences dialog box opens, in
which choices are made for the organizing environment itself. Because
this set of preferences is handled in a completely different dialog box,
we describe it in the next section.

Controlling the Organizing Environment
A whole different set of Preferences appears when you select Organize and
Share in the Preferences dialog box. Initially, it may be confusing to you because
the dialog box that opens when you select Organize and Share is also called
Preferences. However, a quick glance at the dialog box shows you a different
set of preference choices. In the following sections, you find a brief introduc-
tion to the Organizer and discover all the different organization preferences
that Elements has to offer.
Understanding the Photoshop 
Elements 4.0 Organizer
We cover all you need to know about a wonderful tool called the Adobe
Photoshop Elements 4.0 Organizer in Chapter 6. Rather than describe all that
the Organizer offers you here in this chapter, we just want you to be aware
that when setting the Organize & Share preferences, you’re setting preference
options for the Organizer.
To take a quick peek at the Organizer, click the Photo Browser button while in
Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. 
Launching and navigating Organize 
& Share preferences
You can open the Organize & Share Preferences dialog box directly from the
Edit menu while in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. Choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Organize & Share. Doing so bypasses the Editing Preferences
dialog box and takes you directly to the dialog box shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2: Choose Edit➪Preferences➪Organize & Share, and a new, 
different Preferences dialog box opens.
33
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

34
Part I: Getting Started 
The Organize & Share Preferences dialog box uses the same metaphor to
toggle through a number of panes that the main Preferences dialog box uses.
However selecting the individual panes is handled by clicking the names in
the list on the left side of the dialog box instead of selecting panes from a
drop-down menu. Options common to all preference panes include:
 Restore Default Settings: Click Restore Default Settings to change all
panes to the original defaults.
 OK: Click OK to accept new changes.
 Cancel: Click Cancel in any pane, and any changes made are not 
registered.
 Help: Click Help to open the Help window and find information about
Organize & Share preferences.
Setting preferences in all the panes
With the Organize & Share Preferences dialog box open, here’s a quick
overview of what you find there:
 The items in the General preferences pane affect a miscellaneous group
of settings applied to files when using the Create tool. Chapter 16 explains
this tool in detail.
 Files preferences offer options for managing file data, connecting to miss-
ing files, prompting for backing up your data, saving catalogs, file and
folder locations for saved files, and adjusting proxy file (a low-resolution
display of a higher resolution image) sizes.
 Folder Location View preferences provide options for showing files and
folders in groups and selected folders.
 With the Editing preferences, you can enable another application that
provides some editing features not found in Elements to edit an image
based on its file type. One good example for adding another editor is
when editing video clips. If you have Adobe Premiere Elements, you can
add Premiere as another editor. If you don’t have Premiere installed, you
can use another editor like Microsoft Media Maker.
 The Camera or Card Reader preferences handle acquiring images from
digital cameras and media storage cards. Your computer may have built-
in card readers in which you can insert a media card, such as Compact
Flash or Smart Media, or a USB card reader that supports a media card.
In other cases, you may have a cable that connects from your camera to
a USB port on your computer. These preference options are used with
media cards and camera connections.

 If you scan images with a scanner connected to your computer (as
opposed to downloading them from your camera), the Scanner pref-
erences hold all the options you may want to set.
 Calendar preferences relate to calendar creations. You have several
options from which to choose for your calendar design. In Chapter 16,
we cover creating calendars and explain a little more about these pref-
erence options.
 Tags and Collections preferences help you find and sort your images,
as we explain in much more detail in Chapters 5 and 6. Tag preferences
offer options for sorting tags and icon views for tags.
 If you have a mobile phone capable of taking pictures, you’ll want to
check out the Mobile Phone preferences. You can copy pictures from
your phone to your computer, as we explain in Chapter 4. These prefer-
ences offer options for a folder location where mobile phone files are
stored and an option for correcting red-eye automatically as files are
opened. See Chapter 10 for more information on red-eye correction.
 Sharing preferences relate to sharing files in e-mail and online. Options
are available for setting e-mail and sharing settings.
 Services preferences offer choices for handling program updates and
online service orders. You can choose to check for program updates
automatically or manually, choose options for printing and sharing
images, and update creations, accounts, and more.
Customizing Presets
Part of the fun of image editing is choosing brush tips, swatch colors, gradient
colors, and patterns to create the look you want. To get you started, Elements
provides you with a number of different preset libraries that can be loaded
and used at your will. So, for example, you can load a Brushes library to acquire
different brush tips you use with the Brush tool. But you’ll likely want to cus-
tomize the preset libraries at least a little bit, too.
You can change libraries individually in respective palettes where the items
are used. For example, you can change color swatch libraries in the Color
Swatches palette, brush tips from Options bar choices, and so on. Another way
you can change libraries is to use the Preset Manager, shown in Figure 2-3.
We cover using the presets in Chapter 12, which is where you can find out
how to use the many different presets Elements provides you. The important
thing to note here is that you can change the presets according to your edit-
ing needs.
35
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit

36
Part I: Getting Started 
To open the Preset Manager dialog box, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. The
options you have available include the following:
 Preset Type: Open the drop-down menu to choose from Brushes,
Swatches, Gradients, and Patterns.
 More: The More drop-down menu lists different viewing options. You can
view the library items as text lists or as thumbnail views.
 Done: Any changes you make in
the Preset Manager are recorded
and saved when you click Done.
 Load: Click this button to open
another library. Elements pro-
vides you with several libraries
from which to choose for each
Preset Type.
 Save Set: Any changes you make
in the Preset Manager can be
saved as a new library. Use this
option if you make a change so
you don’t disturb the original
presets.
 Rename: Each item in a library has a unique name. If you want to rename
an item, click the thumbnail in the Preview window, click Rename, and
type a new name in the dialog box that appears.
 Delete: Click an item in the Preview window and click Delete to remove
the item from the library.
 Help: Click Help to open the Help document and find out more about
managing presets.
Getting Familiar with Color
We could spend a whole lot of time and many pages in this book delving into
the complex world of color theory and definitions. You wouldn’t likely read
it, and we’re not so inclined to reduce this book from a real page-turner to
something that’s likely to sedate you. Rather, in the following sections, we
offer some fundamental principles to make your work in Elements easier
when editing color images.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of understanding color is to understand what RGB is and how
it comes about. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue. These are the primary
colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about primary
colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
Figure 2-3: The Preset Manager dialog box
provides a central area where libraries can be
changed.

RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ-
ual channels in Elements, you still need to understand just a little about color
channels.
When you see a color pixel (a tiny square dot), the color is represented as 
different levels of gray in each channel. This may sound confusing at first,
but stay with us for just a minute. When you have a color channel, like the
red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up with
a bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less light
pass through, thereby diluting the red color. This is how channels work.
Individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256 levels
of light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of light in the
different channels, you ultimately change the color.
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. The total
number of possibilities for creating color in an RGB model is achieved by
multiplying the values for each channel together (256 x 256 x 256). The result
is more than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer moni-
tor can display in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as theory goes, but what does that mean in
practicality? Actually, you see some of this information in tools and dialog
boxes you work with in Elements. As an experiment, open a file in Elements
and choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels; the dialog box shown in
Figure 2-4 opens.
Notice that the Channel drop-down
menu shows you Red, Green, and
Blue as individual channels as well as
a composite RGB selection. Further-
more, the Output Levels show you
values ranging from 0 on the left to
255 on the right. Considering that 0 is
a number, you have a total of 256 dif-
ferent levels of gray.
What’s important is that you know
that your work in color is related to
RGB images that comprise three dif-
ferent channels. There are 256 levels
of gray that can let through or hold back light and change brightness values
and color. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more on using tools like Levels to adjust
color in this way.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit holds
one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you have
37
Chapter 2: Getting Ready to Edit
Figure 2-4: Select Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog box.

38
Part I: Getting Started 
256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image — 8 bits
with 2 possible values each = 28 = 256 possible levels of gray. Multiply 8 bits
per channel times your 3 channels and you get 24 bits, which is the common
bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.
Now, take a look at the Image➪
Mode menu. You should see a menu
selection that says 8 Bits/Channel,
as shown in Figure 2-5. When you
open an image in Elements, if this
menu command is grayed out, you
are working with a 24-bit image, or
an image of 8-bits per channel.
But what does it mean when you can
select the 8 Bit/Channel menu com-
mand? You can be certain that your
image is not an 8-bit-per-channel
image. This command may be selec-
table because some digital cameras
and most low-end consumer-grade
scanners can capture images at
higher bit depths. You can scan a photo on a scanner at 16 bits per channel.
When you do, you end up with 4,096 levels of gray. When you take a picture
with a quality digital camera, you can capture 32-bit-per-channel images, and
you end up with a file containing 32,768 levels of gray. That’s a lot!
Now here’s the catch. All files need to be reduced to 8 bits per channel before
you print them because that’s all the information any printer uses. In addition,
many tools, commands, and palette options work only with 8-bit-per-channel
images. So you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at higher bit depths
than I can print them?”
If you attempt to adjust brightness and contrast or other image enhance-
ments in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can
get some noticeable image degradation if moving adjustment sliders too far
while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit and
32-bit images, you don’t destroy data. You simply inform Elements which
256 of the total available levels of gray you want to use. The end result is an
image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-per-
channel images. (For more information on image bit-depth, see Chapter 3.)
Getting Color Right
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your

computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. Output can be a
printout from a color printer or a screen view on a Web page.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can never expect to achieve
a perfect match. There are far too many printer and monitor variables to deal
with. The best you can hope for is a very close match.
In order to match color between your monitor and your output, you need to
first calibrate your monitor and then choose a color profile. In the following
sections, you find all the details.
Calibrating your monitor
Adobe Gamma is a Control Panel device installed with Photoshop Elements.
You use Adobe Gamma to adjust your monitor brightness and correct for
any colorcasts or tints. The idea behind using Adobe Gamma is that it makes
your monitor reflect to a close approximation of the overall brightness of your
output. If your monitor displays a dark image and your printer prints a lighter
image, something is out of sync. To correct the problem, start with the Adobe
Gamma Control Panel device.
Here’s what you do to set up your monitor using Adobe Gamma:
1. Choose Start➪Settings➪Control Panel.
The Control Panel folder opens on your desktop.
2. Double-click the Adobe Gamma item in the folder.
The Adobe Gamma Control Panel opens.
3. Click Wizard at the bottom of the control panel to open the Adobe
Gamma Wizard.
4. Type a name in the Description text box to name your calibration.
Click Next to advance to the next pane.
Two squares appear, which help you adjust brightness and contrast. The
large outer square should appear rich black, and a smaller square inside
the larger one should appear charcoal black.
5. Squint your eyes and adjust the hardware controls on your monitor for
brightness and contrast until you can see no difference in the colors.
Click Next to advance to the next pane.
6. When the Select Phosphors pane appears, leave this pane alone unless
you know that the default phosphors are incorrect.
In almost all cases, you see the correct selection in the drop-down menu.
7. Click Next to show the Gamma settings.
The Gamma settings determine how your monitor defines how bright
image midtones appear.

8. Deselect the View Single Gamma Only check box.
You see three individual grid boxes representing the red, green, and blue
colors in your monitor. A slider appears below each grid.
9. Squint your eyes and move a slider until the outer horizontal lines
look like the solid inner square. Move the sliders back and forth for
each grid box.
10. Click Next to advance to the next pane in the wizard: Set the
Hardware White Point.
Adjusting for proper hardware white point takes care of any colorcast on
your monitor.
11. Click the Measure button and click OK in the next dialog box until
you see three squares. Then do one of the following, depending on
what you see:
The center square represents the current setting. On the left and right,
you see slight tonal differences in the color of the squares.
• If the center square looks like a neutral gray with no colorcast,
press Esc and click Next. 
• If one of the other squares on the left or right side of the center
square appears more neutral, click it so that it moves to the center.
Keep clicking additional squares until you feel you have a neutral
gray with no colorcast. Press Enter when finished and click Next.
12. Leave the Adjust White Point setting at the default option (Same as
Hardware) and click Next.
The final pane provides you an option to compare your new settings
with the settings in place before you opened the Adobe Gamma Control
Panel device.
13. Click the Before and After radio buttons back and forth several times
to see the original default compared to the new setting reflected on
your monitor. If everything looks OK, click Finish.
14. In the Save As dialog box that appears, click Save to save your moni-
tor profile.
The target folder is the Color folder; the path is Windows\system32\
spool\drivers\color. Be certain to save your profile to this folder.
By default, Elements looks to this folder when you want to load a color
profile. After you click Save, the name you provided in Step 4 appears
as the profile name.
There’s much more to getting color right than setting up your monitor. For
more information on handling color, read through Chapter 3.

Choosing a color profile
When you work in Elements and print files to color printers, your colors are
much truer when using color profiles. Color profiles contain information about
the color reproduction capabilities of a device, such as a scanner, a digital
camera, a monitor, or a printer. Using color profiles ensures that you get better
color matches between these devices. So, for example, if you see green trees in
a photo on your monitor, with the help of a color profile for your printer, the
same green color values are output to the printer. Without the help of color
profiles, you can experience tremendous shifts in color between devices.
You access your color profile settings
by choosing Edit➪Color Settings.
The color settings dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 2-6.
The options you have in the Color
Settings dialog box include the 
following:
 No Color Management: If you
find that the files you print to
your desktop printer are true to
the color you see on your moni-
tor when No Color Management
is selected, leave it alone and
consider yourself lucky. If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it.
 Always Optimize Colors for
Computer Screens: Check this
radio button (new in Elements
4.0) when you work with images
you intend to e-mail, to host on Web sites, or to use with one of the
Organize options for producing creations like videodiscs and slideshows
that are intended for screen viewing. The profile used for this setting is
sRGB, which is a default color profile developed by Microsoft that
assumes most monitors are likely to see the same color.
 Always Optimize for Printing: Choose this option (also new) when you
intend to print your pictures to desktop color printers. The profile used
is AdobeRGB, developed by Adobe Systems. Adobe developed this pro-
file to optimize output to all kinds of printing devices.
 Allow Me to Choose: This is yet another new option. When you choose
it, Elements prompts you for a profile assignment when you open images
containing no profile. This setting is handy if you work back and forth
between screen and print images.

Part I: Getting Started 
When you select your color settings and use a profile, or when you are
prompted to use a profile, you can embed the profile in the images you save.
Embedding a profile occurs simply when you select a check box in the Save
or Save As dialog box, as we explain in more detail in Chapters 4 and 15. This
means that anyone else opening your image can honor the profile you used
when you last edited your file.
Only some file formats support profile embedding. When you choose File➪
Save or File➪Save As, look at the Color area in the dialog box. If you can
check the box for ICC Profile: AdobeRGB (1998), then the format selected
in the Format drop-down menu supports profile embedding. If the check
box is grayed out, you need to select a different profile from the Format 
drop-down menu.

hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you are looking at
a huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny colored squares, and
the number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This
relationship between pixels and resolution is important for you to
understand in all your Elements work. It relates to creating
selections (as we explain in Chapter 7), printing files
(Chapter 14), and sharing files (Chapter 16).
Color modes are also represented as collections of
pixels. Color modes are also important when using
tools and when printing and sharing files.
This chapter explains some essential points about
resolution, color modes, and the file formats you use
to save your Elements images. We talk about changing
resolution by resizing images, converting color modes,
and saving the results in different file formats.
The Ubiquitous Pixels
Files you open in Elements comprise thousands or maybe millions of tiny
square pixels. Each pixel has one and only one color value. The arrangement
of the pixels of different shades and colors creates an illusion to your eyes
when viewing an image on screen. For example, you may have black and white
pixels arranged in an order that creates the impression that you’re looking at
something gray — not at tiny black and white squares.

44
Part I: Getting Started 
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels.
You surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects
in your image, you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and
brightness, you change shades and tints of pixels for color correction, and
you perform a host of other editing possibilities.
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and
Elements files. Your pictures are called raster images. When you have pixels,
you have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that was not made up of
pixels, Elements rasterizes the data. In other words, Elements converts other
data to pixels if the document was not originally composed of pixels.
In addition to raster data, there’s also vector data, which we talk more about
in Chapter 13. But for this chapter, you just need to focus on raster data.
In order to use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be
working on a raster image file. If your data is not rasterized, many tools and
commands are unusable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines your image resolution. If you have
72 pixels across a one-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch
(ppi). If you have 300 pixels in one inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files:
 When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing
all the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
 When you show images on screen: Just as images have resolution
inherent in the files, your computer monitor displays everything you
see on it in a fixed resolution. Computer monitors display images at
72 ppi. That’s all you get. What’s important to know is that your best
viewing of your photos on your computer monitor is always when 
viewing images at a 72 ppi image size. 
As an example, take a look at Figure 3-1. You see an image reduced to 50%
and then at different zoom sizes. As the sizes change, the resolution dis-
play on your monitor changes. At a 100% size, you see the image exactly
as it will print. The 100% size represents the image displayed on your
monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of the resolution of the file.

Figure 3-1: The same image is viewed at different zoom levels.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing at different zoom
levels is an important concept to grasp. If you grab an image off the Web and
zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800% view in Figure 3-1. If you acquire
a digital camera image, you may need to zoom out to a 16% view to fit the
entire image in the Image window.
The reason these displays vary so much is all due to image resolution. That
Web page image you grabbed off the Web might be a 2-inch-square image
at 72 ppi, while that digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image at
240 ppi. To fill the entire window with the Web image, you need to zoom in
on the file. As you zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you zoom,
the lower the resolution on your monitor.
As you zoom in or out of an image, you change the resolution as it appears on
your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The image resolu-
tion remains the same until you use one of Elements’ tools to reduce or add
to image resolution.

Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5 inches,
the file can be any number of different resolution values. After the file is
opened in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an image, the reso-
lution, or both.
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of
pixels it contains), there’s an inverse relationship between the physical
size of your image and the resolution. As image size is increased, resolution
decreases. Conversely, as you raise resolution, you lower image size. 
The Art of Resampling
In some cases, images are too large, and you need to reduce their resolution
and physical size. In other cases, you may need higher resolution to output
your images at larger sizes. This method of sizing — changing both the size
as well as the number of pixels — is referred to as resampling an image.
Specifically, reducing resolution is called downsampling, and raising resolu-
tion is known as upsampling.
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you toss away
pixels or manufacture new pixels. I discuss the details later in this section.
Changing image size and resolution
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple of different ways.
One method is cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or without
resampling images. For more informa-
tion on using the Crop tool, see
Chapter 9. Another method is to use
the Image Size dialog box, which
you’ll find yourself using in many of
your editing sessions in Elements. 
To resize an image with the Image
Size dialog box, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪
Image Size. 
Alternatively, you can use the
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I.
The Image Size dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 3-2.
Figure 3-2: Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size
to open the Image Size dialog box.

The Pixel Dimensions area in the Image Size dialog box shows the file size
(such as 46.8M). This number is the amount of space the image takes up
on your hard drive. The width and height values are fixed unless you
click the Resample Image check box at the bottom of the dialog box.
2. In the Document Size area, you can redefine dimensions and resolu-
tion. The options include:
• Width. Type a value in the text box to resize the image’s width and
tab out of the field to implement the change. From the drop-down
menu to the right of the text box, you can choose a unit of measure:
percent, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or columns.
• Height. The Height options are the same as the Width options with
the exception of no column setting. If you keep the sizing propor-
tional, you typically edit either the Width or Height text box, but
not both. As you size either Width or Height, the resolution sizes
inversely.
• Resolution. Edit the text box to change resolution and press the
tab key to change the value. As resolution is edited, the Width and
Height are changed inversely.
3. If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size,
select the Resample Image check box.
With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of
pixels. When the box is unchecked, the values for dimensions are linked
together. Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the sec-
tion, “Understanding the results of resampling,” later in this chapter.
4. If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a resam-
pling method as well as other resample options.
In the drop-down list, you find choices for choosing a resampling method.
See Table 3-1 for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image
check box become active when you check the Resample Image box.
Here’s what they do:
• Scale Styles. Elements has a Styles palette from which you add
a variety of different style effects to images (see Chapter 11 for
details). When you apply a style, like a frame border, the border
appears at a defined width. When you check the box for Scale
Styles and then resize the image, the Styles effect is also resized.
Leaving the check box unchecked keeps the style at the same size
while the image is resized.
• Constrain Proportions. By default, the box is checked, and you want
to keep it that way unless you want to intentionally distort an image.
5. When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your image.

Understanding the results of resampling
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution isn’t.
If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the original
source, like rescanning the image or reshooting a picture, then always favor
creating a new file using the resolution you want over resampling in Elements.
In many cases, images can be severely degraded when upsampling an image.
If you take a picture with a digital
camera and you want to add the pic-
ture to a Web page, the image needs
to be sampled at 72 ppi. In most
cases, you’ll visit the Image Size
dialog box, check the box for
Resample Image, add a width or
height value, and type 72 in the
Resolution text box. What you end
up with is an image that looks great
on your Web page. In Figure 3-3 you
can see an image that was downsam-
pled in Elements from over 14 inches
horizontal width.

you want to print a large poster, you can forget about using Elements or any

other image editor. Upsampling low-
resolution images often turns them
to mush, as you can see in Figure 3-4.
Can upsampling be used for any pur-
pose, you may ask? In some cases,
yes, you can upsample with some sat-
isfactory results. You can experience
better results with higher resolutions
of 300 ppi and more if the resample
size is not extraordinary. If all else
fails, try applying a filter to a grainy,
upsampled image to mask the prob-
lem. Chapter 11 has the details.
Choosing a Resolution for Print or On-Screen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount to printing
files. Good ol’ 72 ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many of your
large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slide shows. With output
to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many different printing
output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ-
ent resolutions. You can quickly determine the best file attributes by running
tests. When you send files to service centers, ask the technicians what file
attributes work best with their equipment.
For a starting point, look over the recommended resolutions for various
output devices in Table 3-2.

Part I: Getting Started 
Go Ahead . . . Make My Mode!
Regardless of what output you prepare your files for, you need to consider
color mode and file format. In Chapter 2, we talk about RGB color mode.
This color mode is what you use to prepare color files for print on your 
desktop color printer or when preparing files for photo service centers.
But you can also use color modes other than RGB. If you start with an RGB
color image and you want to convert to a different color mode, you have
menu options for converting color. Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm
(a mathematical formula) to convert pixels from one mode to another. In some
cases, the conversion via a menu command produces good results, and in
other cases, you can use some different options for converting modes.
In the following sections, we introduce the modes that are available in Elements
and explain how to convert from RGB to the mode of your choice: bitmap,
grayscale, or indexed color.
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although the CMYK mode is
not available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of what it is and
the purposes of CMYK images. CMYK is commonly referred to as process
color and contains percentages of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black colors.
This mode is used for commercial printing. If you design a magazine cover in
Elements and send the file off to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted
to CMYK.
Converting to bitmap mode
The bitmap mode is most commonly used when printing line art, such as
black-and-white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects you create
from your RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap
image and import it into other programs, such as the Microsoft Office pro-
grams. For the creative among us, you can combine bitmap images with RGB
color to produce many interesting effects.
Elements’ bitmap mode is not the same as the Windows .bmp file format.
In Elements, bitmap mode is a color mode. A .bmp file can be an RGB color
mode image, a grayscale color mode image, or a bitmap color mode image.
One important thing to keep in mind is that, when you combine images into
single documents, as we explain in Chapter 8, you need to convert bitmap
files to grayscale or color if you want to merge the images together with an
RGB image. If you convert to grayscale, Elements takes care of converting
grayscale to RGB mode. 

As an example of an effect resulting
from combining grayscale and color
images, look over Figure 3-5. The orig-
inal RGB image was converted to a
bitmap and then saved as a different
file. The bitmap was converted to
grayscale and dropped on top of the
RGB image. After adjusting the opac-
ity, the result is a grainy effect with
desaturated color.
You can acquire bitmap (.bmp) mode
images directly in Elements when you
scan images that are black and white.
Illustrated art, logos, your signature,
a copy of a fax, and so on might be
the kind of files you scan directly in
bitmap mode. Additionally, you can
convert your images to bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a
two-step process. You need to first
convert to grayscale, and then from
grayscale, you convert to bitmap. If
you select the bitmap menu command
while in RGB color, Elements prompts
you to convert to grayscale first.
To convert RGB mode to bitmap, do the following:
1. Open an image that you want to convert to bitmap in either Standard
Edit or Quick Fix mode.
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to grayscale.
3. Click OK, and the Bitmap
dialog box opens.
The Bitmap dialog box provides
options for selecting the output
resolution and a conversion
method.
4. Select a Resolution.
By default, the Output dialog box
shown in Figure 3-6 displays the
current resolution. You can edit
the text box and type a new resol-
ution value or accept the default.

effects by combining the same image from a

5. From the Method drop-down menu, you can choose from the follow-
ing settings:
• 50% Threshold
• Pattern Dither
• Diffusion Dither
Look over Figure 3-7, and you can see a comparison of the different
methods used in converting RGB images to bitmaps.

Converting to grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a
black-and-white photo.
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of two ways, but remember that
one of these methods isn’t as good as the other. We recommend that you avoid
converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. When Elements
performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the pixels, so you
loose some precious data during the conversion and can’t regain the color
after conversion. If you convert an image to grayscale, save the file, and
delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the color image is
lost forever. You could save a secondary file, but this can add a little confu-
sion and require some more space on your hard drive.
As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to
grayscale, try the following method:
1. Open an RGB image in Elements.
2. Duplicate a layer.
The default Palette Bin contains the Layers palette. In this palette, you
find a pop-up menu when you click More in the top-right corner. From
the menu commands, select
Duplicate Layer. (For more infor-
mation on working with layers,
see Chapter 8.)
3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation
(or press Ctrl+U) to open the
Hue/Saturation dialog box.
4. Drag the Saturation slider to the
far left, as shown in Figure 3-8,
to desaturate the image.
All color disappears, but the
brightness values of all the
pixels remain unaffected. (For
more information on using the
Hue/Saturation dialog box and
the other Adjust Color com-
mands, see Chapter 10.)
5. Turn off the color layer by clicking the eye icon.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-8: Open the Hue/Saturation dialog box
and move the Saturation slider to the far left to
eliminate color.

54
Part I: Getting Started 
In the Layers palette, you see two
layers, as shown in Figure 3-9.
You don’t need to turn the color
layer off to print the file in
grayscale, but turning it off can
help you remember which color
layer you used the last time you
printed or exported the file.
Following the preceding steps pro-
vides you a file that contains both
RGB and grayscale. If you want to
print the color layer, you can turn 
off the grayscale layer. If you need 
to exchange files with graphic 
designers, you can send the layered
file, and the design professional can
use both the color image and the grayscale image.
The other advantage of converting RGB color to grayscale by using the Hue/
Saturation dialog box is that you don’t affect any changes in the brightness
values of the pixels. Moving the Saturation slider to desaturate the image
affects only the color. The luminance and lightness values remain the same.
In Figure 3-10, you can see an RGB image as it appears in an unedited RGB
mode. In Figure 3-11, you can see the results of the RGB image converted to
grayscale using the Image➪Mode➪Grayscale menu command, and the same
image converted to grayscale using the Hue/Saturation dialog box. The image
converted with the Hue/Saturation dialog box contains a little more detail in
the highlights (light areas of the image) and in the shadow areas.

grayscale and color layer. You can turn layers
on or off by clicking the eye icon.

Figure 3-11: The top image was converted to grayscale with a menu command, and the bottom image was
converted to grayscale using the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
Converting to indexed color mode
Indexed color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics. When saving
indexed color images, you can, at times, create smaller file sizes than RGB that
are ideal for using in Web site designs.
RGB images in 24-bit color (8-bits/channel) are capable of rendering colors from
a palette of 16.7 million colors, as we explain in Chapter 2. An indexed color
image is an 8-bit image with only a single channel. The total number of colors

Part I: Getting Started 
you get with indexed can be no more than 256. When you convert RGB images
to indexed color, you can choose to dither the color, which displays the image
with a dither effect much like we see with bitmapped images. This dithering
effect makes the file appear as though it has more than 256 colors, and the
transition between colors appears smoother than if no dithering were applied.
Upon occasion, index color images have an advantage over RGB images when
hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, the smaller the
file size. When you prepare images for Web hosting, you can choose to use
indexed color or RGB color. Whether you choose one over the other really
depends on how well the image appears on your monitor. If you have some
photos that you want to show on Web pages, you’re best off using RGB images
and saving in a format appropriate for Web hosting, as we explain a little later
in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork such as logos, illustrations, and draw-
ings, you may find that the appearance of index colors is no different than
viewing the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the index
color image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color;
the Indexed Color dialog box opens. A number of different options are available
to you, and, fortunately, you can preview the results as you make choices.
Get in, poke around, and you can see the options applied in the image window.
Saving Files with Purpose
Photoshop Elements files are saved in a variety of different formats. Some of
the format types require you to convert a color mode before the format can
be used. Therefore, you have a relationship between formats and saving files.
Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file formats you
can use when saving files. 
Before you go too far in Elements, you’ll want to become familiar with file 
formats and the conversions that need to be made to save in one format
or another. If you do nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or
changing bit depth, you can save a file after editing in the same format that
the file was opened. In many circumstances, you’ll want to open an image and
prepare it for some form of output, which requires more thought about the
kind of file format you use when saving the file.
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save and Save As dialog boxes are familiar places
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. Using Save As, you

can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy while retaining
the original file.
To use the Save or Save As dialog box, choose File➪Save, for files to be saved
the first time, or File➪Save As for any file, and a dialog box opens.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in
the Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Some standard options you find in the
Elements Save or Save As dialog box include:
 File name: This item is common to all Save dialog boxes. Type a name
for your file in the text box.
`
 Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain
the formats supported by Elements later in this chapter.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ-
ent from other Save dialog boxes you may be accustomed to using. The Save
Options area in the Save As dialog box provides the following choices:
 Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer,
check this box. (For more information about using the Organizer, see
Chapter 6.)
 Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a version
of your image, but only in Quick Fix mode. When you save the file from
the Quick Fix mode, this check box is active. Check the box and a version
of the original is saved and appears in the Organizer.
 Color: Check the box for ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile.
Depending on which profile you are using, the option appears for sRGB
or Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is checked, the profile is
embedded in the image. See Chapter 2 for more information on profiles.
 Thumbnail: This option relates to your Saving Files preferences, which
we discuss in Chapter 2. If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see
a mini representation of your image when viewing in folders or on the
desktop. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files preferences,
the check box can be checked or disabled. If choosing an option for
Never Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is
checked or unchecked for you and is grayed out. You need to return to
the Preferences dialog box in order to change the option.
 Use Lower Case Extension: File extensions give you a clue as to what file
format was used when a file was saved. Elements automatically adds the
extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use uppercase or
lowercase letters for the extension name. Check the box for Use Lower
Case Extension for lowercase, or uncheck the box if you want to use
uppercase characters in the filename.

Part I: Getting Started 
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than when saving files
for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web, and the Save for Web dialog box
opens. We explain all you need to know about how to use the Save for Web
dialog box in Chapter 15. If you’re in a hurry to understand how Web images
are saved, jump over to Chapter 15.
Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you need to pick a file format in the
Format drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
As you choose from the different format options, keep the following in mind:
 File formats are especially important when you exchange files with other
users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept or
reject files depending on the format you choose.
 Whether you can select one format or another when you save a file is
dependent on the color mode, the bit depth, and whether layers are 
present. If a format is not present in the Format drop-down menu when
you attempt to save a file, you need to return to one of the edit modes and
perform some kind of edit, such
as changing a color mode or flat-
tening layers, in order to save
the file in your chosen format.
For a glimpse at all the file formats
available to you, open a standard
RGB color image in Standard Edit
mode, choose File➪Save As, and
click the down arrow to open the
Format drop-down menu. As you can
see in Figure 3-12, you have many
options for choosing a format.
We explain most file formats sup-
ported by Elements and the purpose
for each format in the following 
sections.
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format for both Photoshop and Photoshop
Elements. The format supports saving all color modes and bit depths, and
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native
format or when exchanging files with Photoshop users. Also use it when saving
files that you need to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any
text you add to layers is editable when you return to the file. (See Chapter 13
for more information on adding text to an image.)
Figure 3-12: Open the Format drop-down menu
in either the Save or Save As dialog box, and
the formats supported by Elements appear.

BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a format type that is
bitmap and a color mode that is also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. The bitmap
format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. The bitmap color
mode, which we cover earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black and white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources,
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program documents,
try to save as BMP.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Barb was a college coed and Ted had a moustache and wore a green leisure
suit when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts. We exchanged
files and mail on 300-baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe developed
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between mainframe
computers and the ever-growing number of users working on Osbornes,
Kaypros, Apples, and Radio Shack TRS 80s.
Today, GIF is a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be
indexed color or animated images and support the smallest file sizes. Use
this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and when you want to
create animation in your images. To find out how to create animated GIFs,
see Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site. (The Introduction has details
about the Web site.)
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by graphic
artists when designing jobs for commercial printing. The more popular format
for creative professionals is TIFF, but
Photoshop EPS has some advantages
not found in other formats.
Depending on the color mode of your
image, you have different options
when using the Photoshop EPS file
format. Select the format in the Save
or Save As dialog box and click Save.
If you’re working on a bitmap image
(1-bit), the EPS Options dialog box
shown in Figure 3-13 opens.
Notice the check box for Transparent Whites. You might have a circular logo for
which you want the area around the circle to appear transparent. If you import
the graphic in another program, you can see the black in the image while all the
white area is transparent and shows any background through what was white
in the original bitmap image. If you save a file in a higher bit depth, the EPS
Options dialog box doesn’t provide an option for making whites transparent.

Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Figure 3-13: When working on 1-bit bitmap
images, the EPS options dialog box offers an
option to save transparency where white
appears in the document.

Part I: Getting Started 
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file
format in use today. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments, can be
viewed in JPEG viewers and directly in Web browsers, and are used by many
photo labs for printing files. Just about every program capable of importing
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of
using JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format for all
kinds of documents.
You need to exercise some caution when using the JPEG format. JPEG files are
compressed to reduce file size. You can take an image of several megabytes
and scrunch it down to a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with
JPEG compression, you experience data loss. You may not see this on your
monitor or have it appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low 
compression while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with
maximum compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely will
notice image degradation.
As you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, each new save degrades
an image more. If you need to submit JPEG images to photo labs for printing
your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format until you’re ready to
save the final image. Save as JPEG when you want to save the final file for
printing and use a low compression with high quality.
When you select JPEG for the format
and click Save, the JPEG Options
dialog box shown in Figure 3-14 opens.
You choose the amount of compres-
sion by typing a value in the Quality
text box or by moving the slider below
the Quality text box. The acceptable
ranges are from 0 to 12, where 0 is
the lowest quality and results in the
highest compression, and 12 is the
highest quality that results in the
lowest amount of compression.
Notice that you also have choices in
the Format area of the JPEG Options
dialog box. The Progressive item cre-
ates a progressive JPEG file commonly
used with Web browsers. This file
type shows progressive quality as
the file downloads from a Web site.
The image first appears in a low-quality view and shows higher resolution
views until the image appears at full resolution when completely downloaded
in your browser window.
For a peek at how the different compression levels appear in printed images,
take a look at Figure 3-15.
Figure 3-14: When saving in JPEG format, you
make a choice for the amount of compression
to apply to the saved image.

Figure 3-15: Depending on the amount of compression applied to an image, the print results can show some
file degradation.
JPEG 2000 (*.JPF, *.JPX, *.JP2, *. J2K, *.JPC)
JPEG 2000 is a newer JPEG file format. This format offers you the same qual-
ity modes as the JPEG format and an option to save the file with compression
without tossing away pixels, in which case you get what is called a lossless
compression. The JPEG 2000 dialog box shows you the results of the options
choices you make in terms of the resulting file size right in the dialog box
before you save the image.
If you need to save images in JPEG format for your commercial photo lab,
check with the technicians and ask if they support JPEG 2000. If so, then save
your files in this format with a lossless compression. When files are com-
pressed with lossless compression, you can expect to lose about two-thirds
of the original file size. For example, a 6MB file can be reduced to about 2MB
when saved as JPEG 2000 in a lossless compression format. Note that if you
save files with JPEG 2000 format for the Web, Web browsers need to have a
plug-in to see the images.
Quality = 12

Part I: Getting Started 
PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs today
support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX format.
If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in Elements,
edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) was designed to maintain document
integrity and exchange files between computers. PDF is one of the most popu-
lar formats used today and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program
available for installation on your Elements CD installer or by downloading from
Adobe’s Web site.
PDF is all over the place in Elements. When you jump into the Organize mode
and create slide presentations, cards, calendars, and so on, you can export
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you
can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other
Acrobat viewers) and can be searched using Reader’s Find and Search tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users of
Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for all
the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transparency,
and when you want to exchange files with users who don’t have Elements
or Photoshop.
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This format is used to exchange files between Windows and Mac users and
mainframe computers. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes,
don’t bother saving in this format.
PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is Apple’s answer to PCX on Windows. This format 
originated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the MacPaint 
program. PICT files are great when creating slides and video files on the
Macintosh and when printing your images on film recorders that don’t
use PostScript. You might use the format when requested by a Mac user
or when sending files that need to be printed as slides on a non-PostScript
film recorder.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages. PNG
supports all the color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some browsers,
however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages. One disadvantage
you have with PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the images, as
they can with JPEG.

TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic
designers. TIFF is generally used when importing images in professional
layout programs like Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker and when com-
mercial photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports downloading
TIFF files directly to their devices.
(Note: Direct downloads are used in
lieu of opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals
have used TIFF for so long, a better
choice for designers using a program
like Adobe InDesign is saving in the
native Photoshop PSD file format.
This requires a creative professional
to save only one file in native format
without bothering to save both
native and TIFF formats.
TIFF, along with Photoshop PSD
and Photoshop PDF, supports saving
layered files and works in all color
modes. When you save in TIFF
format, you can also compress files
in several different compression
schemes.
When you select TIFF for the format
and click Save in the Save or Save As
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog
box shown in Figure 3-16 opens.
In the Image Compression area, you have choices for:
 NONE: Selecting this option results in no compression. You use this option
when sending files to creative professionals for creating layouts in pro-
grams like Adobe InDesign. None of the compression schemes below is
recommended when printing files to commercial printing devices.
 LZW: This is a lossless compression scheme and results in much lower
file sizes without destroying data.
 ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compression scheme. You can favor ZIP compres-
sion over LZW when you have large areas of the same color in an image.
 JPEG: JPEG is lossy and results in the smallest file sizes. Use JPEG here
the same as when you apply JPEG compression with files saved in the
JPEG format.

Wireless BMP (*.WBM, *.WBMP)
This file format is used when saving files that will ultimately appear on cell
phones, PDAs, and other small electronic devices. This format supports only
1-bit bitmap mode images.
File formats at a glance
We’ve been working with Photoshop, which saves in the same formats listed
here, since 1989. At no time during the past 16 years have we used all the 
formats available to you in Photoshop Elements. At most, you’ll use maybe
three or four of these formats.
You don’t need to remember all the formats and what they do. Just pick the
ones you use in your workflow, mark Table 3-3 for reference, and refer to it
from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how files need
to be prepared to save in your desired formats. If you happen to receive a file
from another user in one of the formats you don’t use, come back to the
description in this chapter when you need some detail on what the format is
used for.

* Embedding profiles is limited to embedding either sRGB IEC61966-2.1 or AdobeRGB (1998).
** CompuServe GIF doesn’t support saving layers, but it does support saving layers as frames. You
use the frames when creating an animated GIF file used for Web pages.
Audio and video formats supported in Elements
In addition to the image formats listed in Table 3-3, Elements also supports
audio and video files. The support is limited to adding and viewing audio and
video files in the Organizer and printing the first frame in a video file. Other
kinds of edits made to audio and video files require special software for
audio/video editing.
Audio files can be imported in slide shows, as we explain in Chapter 15. The
acceptable file formats for audio files include MP3, WAV, and WMA. If you have
audio files in another format, you need to convert the file format. For these
kinds of conversions, you can search the Internet for a shareware audio con-
version program.

Part I: Getting Started 
Video files can also be imported in slide shows, as we discuss in Chapter 15.
Elements supports the WMV video format. Like audio files, if videos are
saved in other formats, such as Apple’s QuickTime, you need to convert
the QT video format to WMV. For video conversion utilities, you can also
find shareware programs to do the job. Search the Internet for a video 
converter. If you’re interested in showing your photos on a TV, see Bonus
Chapter 3 on this book’s Web site for detailed steps.

Part II
Getting Organized

In this part . . .
T
he ﬁrst thing you’ll want to do after opening
the Photoshop Elements program is to access
your pictures either from a digital camera, some
photos you have on your hard drive, or by scan-
ning photos with your scanner. In this part, we talk
about how to access your pictures and get them
into Elements for editing. We talk about organizing
your pictures by using many impressive organiz-
ing features you have in the program as well as
searching for photos, labeling them, and creating
different versions of the same picture. When it
comes to organizing pictures, Elements is one of
the best tools you can ﬁnd to keep your precious
photos neatly cataloged and accessible.

You have so many different sources to work with for getting a picture into
Elements, where you can play with it, experiment on it, and edit it. If you
have a digital camera, you’re in the right place; we walk you through all
kinds of different options for getting the shots you took with
your camera into Elements.
If you have a digital scanner, you’re in the right place,
too! We talk about scanning photos as well. If you have
some CDs, sources of files on the Internet, some mas-
sive collection of images written to a DVD, or even a
picture or two you took with your cell phone, you’re
still in the right place!
In previous chapters, we flirt with opening files. If
you followed some of the steps outlined for opening
images up to this point, you should have a feel for using
the Open tool and Open command. But there’s more to
acquiring images than just using the Open command, as
you find out in this chapter.
This chapter covers all you need to know about getting images from all kinds
of sources into Elements. This chapter answers all your questions about how
to move around the workspaces to get your files into Elements.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Digital Cameras versus Scanners
If you don’t have a digital camera, we encourage you to buy one as soon as
you can. Digital cameras and Photoshop Elements were made to work together.
If you’ve spent any time scanning images on a digital scanner, you’ll appreciate
the speed a camera offers you compared to a scanner when it comes time to
get your images into Elements.
“But I can do more with my scanner than with a digital camera,” you say?
“Not really,” we say. Just for starters, here are some of the benefits you have
with digital cameras:
 Faster access to files. Copying images from a digital camera media card
is much faster than scanning images from prints and film.
 Higher-quality images. Comparing costs of medium to higher-end scan-
ners, you can shoot much better pictures with a good-quality SLR (Single
Lens Reflex) camera with a quality lens than you can scan film or prints
with a good-quality consumer-grade scanner.
 OCR and text recognition. Unless you have industrial-strength needs for
scanning reams of text documents that need to be interpreted by optical
character recognition (OCR) software, which converts images to editable
text, you’ll do just fine with a digital camera. If you scan individual pages
on a scanner, shooting pages with a camera is much faster and can pro-
duce the same results when pages need to be converted to text.
 3-D objects. With digital cameras, you can shoot 3-D objects. Try scan-
ning a pair of shoes on a scanner bed sometime — well, maybe some
other three-dimensional object. The experiment isn’t worth getting dirt
all over your scanner.
 Reduced costs. With digital cameras, you eliminate film and film-
processing costs. You can order photo prints in superstore outlets,
at less than 10 cents apiece, that are printed on the same photo paper
you get with prints from film. What’s more, you can order prints of only
the pictures that you want to keep instead of developing an entire roll
to have just that one good photograph.
 Organizing and archiving. Digital images can be saved to DVD-ROMs,
where you can add information for every image to keep them easily orga-
nized, as we explain in Chapter 5. Searching a DVD is much faster than
searching through photo books of slides, film, or prints. Archiving digital
images is fast and easy, and you don’t need to worry about scratches,
faded colors, or damaged originals.
 Control over image processing. With film, you’re stuck with the pro-
cessing time and temperature the photo lab uses to process your film.
With some digital cameras, you can post-process images after shooting
the image, as we explain in the last section of this chapter.
 Video clips. Many digital cameras provide you a video-shooting mode so
you can shoot video.

These are some of the benefits you find with using a digital camera over using
a scanner. Scanners do have their place, and some of the benefits you have
with a scanner that you don’t have with cameras involve
 Auto document feeders. You can buy scanners with automatic document
feeders, where pages of documents can be scanned unattended. If you
need to scan large volumes of pages to recognize text, this operation is
much more practical than using a camera.
 Legacy pictures. You can shoot photo prints with digital cameras and,
depending on the camera, you can produce images equal to or better
than using a scanner. Filmstrips and slides, however, require using a
scanner to acquire a digital image. You won’t find a digital camera help-
ing out here.
71
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
Digital SLRs: Should you give 
point-and-shoot the boot?
Digital cameras generally fall into one of two
categories: 
 Point-and-shoot cameras have fixed lenses,
and the bulk of the cameras range in price
from less than $200 to over $800. These cam-
eras are suitable for shooting pictures for
screen output and photo prints up to about
8 x 10 inches or more. (For details on taking
pictures with point-and-shoot models, Digital
Photography For Dummies, 5th Edition, by
Julie Adair King, or Digital Photography All-
in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, by
David D. Busch, can help.)
 Single lens reflex (SLR) cameras use inter-
changeable lenses and have a whole bunch
of options for how pictures are taken in terms
of lighting, resolution, file formats, and more.
These cameras cost from below $1,000 to sev-
eral thousand dollars. (For an in-depth look
at taking pictures with digital SLRs, check
out Digital SLR Cameras & Photography For
Dummies, by David D. Busch.)
As is the case in analog photography, after you get
beyond the bells and whistles a camera body
offers you, the quality of the lens often determines
how good your images turn out. The lowest-priced
single lens reflex cameras typically produce much
better image quality than the highest-priced point-
and-shoot cameras. Why? The quality of the lens
on the SLR is much higher compared to the fixed
lens on the point-and-shoot camera.
When choosing a digital camera, don’t be
fooled into thinking that more megapixels makes
for a better camera. A good-quality SLR camera
of 4 or 5 megapixels can produce images of
much greater quality than an 8-megapixel point-
and-shoot camera. The difference lies in lens
quality and the camera’s electronics. There are
a number of other variables to consider, such as
file formats, image sensors, options for lighting,
film speed, and more.
If you’re in the market for a digital camera,
spend time studying camera attributes, reading
reviews, and browsing manufacturer Web sites.
As a general rule, if you’re serious about your
photography, a few more dollars spent on a
single lens reflex camera provides you with

Grabbing Images from Your Camera
Copying photos from your digital camera to your computer so that you can
work with them in Elements is simple if you’re familiar with your camera and
the tools at your disposal. In this section, you find some points to consider
about choosing a resolution when you shoot your pictures as well as how to
use the Microsoft Camera and Scanner Wizard and Adobe Photo Download
Manager after you hook up your camera to your computer.
Choosing a file format
When you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your images
is an important point to consider. You choose this format before you take your
pictures, and the format is carried over to your computer when you pull images
off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer you are JPEG and
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer you other options, but these two formats
are the most common. Low-cost point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the
JPEG format, while the more expensive cameras and the SLR types offer you
both JPEG and Camera Raw.
 JPEG: Cameras that produce JPEG images process images with JPEG com-
pression before saving them. It’s as if your camera performs a darkroom
method of film processing when the shot is taken.
We describe the JPEG file format in Chapter 3.
 Camera Raw: This format provides you with an optimum image for editing
in Elements. When a Camera Raw image is saved to a media source, all
the information the sensor captured is saved with the file. These images
are post-processed when you open them (see the “Everything You Want
to Know about Camera Raw” section, later in this chapter, to find out about
opening Camera Raw images). For example, you can open a Camera Raw
image, and before the image opens in Elements, you can adjust temper-
ature, exposure, and a bunch of other settings. You can return to the
original Camera Raw file and change the temperature, exposure, and so
on to open the file with different settings. Just like chemical temperature
and development time affect analog film processing, similar options affect
post-processing Camera Raw images. The difference between analog film
and Camera Raw is that after your analog film is processed, you can’t
change the processing attributes. With Camera Raw, you can go back
and post-process the image a hundred times, changing the processing
attributes each time.
Camera Raw also supports higher bit depth images than JPEG files do.

If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw,
always choose the latter. You’ll have much more editing control over your
images, and ultimately you will get better results.
Using the Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard
Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard may automatically be launched when
your computer is connected to a media source. You can use the wizard to
download images from your media source to your computer.
To copy images from a media source or when your camera is connected to
your computer, follow these steps:
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
Connect your computer and your camera or external media reader, or
insert a media source into a port or drive on your computer. The meth-
ods available to you should be detailed in the user’s guide that shipped
with your camera.
When you connect your media to your computer, a dialog box opens,
providing options for how to handle the media.
2. Select Copy Pictures to a Folder on My Computer Using Microsoft
Scanner and Camera Wizard and click OK.
3. Click Next in the opening pane in the wizard and you arrive at a pane in
which you see thumbnail images of the pictures on your media source,
as shown in Figure 4-1.
73
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images
Choosing camera media
When buying a digital camera, consider the media
type supported and the connection ports. There
are a number of different storage sources for
digital cameras. You can purchase cameras with
various types of cards, such as CompactFlash
II, SmartMedia, memory sticks, and the like, or
cameras with mini hard drives, CDs, and floppy
disks. With storage media, everything relates to
capacity and speed. How many images a source
holds, how fast the storage source writes the
saved files, and how fast you can pull the images
off the card are some things to consider. With
some cards, you have choices for buying the
media in different speeds.
As you narrow down your options, read reviews,
search the Internet, and look over the options
provided by manufacturers.

74

Figure 4-1: Click Next to see thumbnails of your images in a scrollable window.
4. If you want to copy all images on the media source to your computer,
click Next. If you want selected images copied to your hard drive,
click the Clear All button to remove the check marks below each
thumbnail. After the check marks are removed, check the pictures
you want to copy and click Next.
5. In the next pane in the Wizard, browse your hard drive to locate a
folder where you want to copy your pictures. Then click OK.
The images are copied to the target folder.
Using Adobe Photo Download Manager
The Adobe Photo Download Manager (Photo Downloader) is installed with
your Elements program. Photo Downloader acquires images from digital cam-
eras connected to your computer, from card readers, and from card reader
ports on your computer. Photo Downloader is an alternative application to
Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard.
To use the Adobe Photo Download Manager:
1. Hook up the media to your computer.

2. Cancel out of the Microsoft Scanner and Camera Wizard.
Because the wizard auto-launches, the opening pane appears when you
make a connection between your camera media source and your com-
puter. To bail out of the wizard, click Cancel.
3. Launch Adobe Photo Download Manager by choosing Start➪
All Programs➪Adobe➪Adobe Download Manager➪
Adobe Download Manager.
Alternately, you can launch Elements and click the View and Organize
button in the Organizer or click the Photo Browser button when in either
Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
4. Select Photos to download.
The Photo Downloader program displays thumbnail images, much like
Microsoft’s wizard. The Photo Downloader offers a few more options for
acquiring your images, though, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2: The Photo Downloader enables you to rotate images and fix red eye.

5. Rotate when applicable by clicking the rotate images buttons.
6. On the right, follow the steps to identify the source, browse for a loca-
tion folder, add a subfolder if you like, and then rename the files, if
desired.
7. Click the Get Photos button to commence copying files from the
source to your hard drive.
When the photos complete the downloading process, a dialog box
opens and asks if you want to delete the original photos from your
media source.
8. Click Yes to delete or No to retain the originals.
Immediately after making your selection, the Organizer window opens.
All the photos downloaded to your hard drive appear in a new Organizer
window, as you see in Figure 4-3.
To simplify the process, stick with using one tool to acquire your digital
camera images — either the Microsoft Wizard or the Adobe Photo Download
Manager.
Figure 4-3: After downloading, thumbnail images of the copied files appear in a new Organizer
window.

Resizing images from digital cameras
Depending on your camera and the camera settings you use, you may need to
resize your images after you download them. 
Camera image resolution, which is measured in megapixels (millions of pixels),
is a factor in image size. If you have a 6-megapixel camera, the full-resolution
images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 pixels. The file size for a 
6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On screen, the resolution of all digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels per inch).
Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at 72 ppi produces
an image a little more than 41 x 27 inches. Regardless of whether your camera
takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 megapixels, the images are all captured at 72 ppi,
but the dimensions vary according to the total number of pixels captured.
Invariably, you always visit the Image Size dialog box, deselect Resample
Image, and edit the resolution text box when preparing images for print.
(See Chapter 3 for more information on using the Image Size dialog box.)
If your color printer requires 150 ppi, changing a 6-megapixel image from
72 ppi at 41 x 27 inches produces an image of a little more than 20 x 13 inches.
Using a Scanner
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers.
Unless you have a SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) device, which is
yet another type of connection port, you’ll be using either USB or FireWire.
Most low-end scanners sold today are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little
more data in the shadows and highlights. As with digital cameras, a scanner’s
price is normally in proportion with its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you would clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selec-
tions before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things ahead
of time before scanning:
 Connect the scanner properly. Make sure you have all connections
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts
and remove them according to the user’s manual instructions.
 Clean the scanner platen. Try to use a lint-free cloth and some glass
cleaner and remove all dust and particles on the glass. The more dust
particles you remove, the easier job you’ll have editing your image in
Elements.
77
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

78
Part II: Getting Organized 
 Clean the source material. Be certain the print or film you want to scan
is free from dust and spots.
If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or debris
that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film in photo
flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo reseller). Be certain your hands
are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fingers to remove the
excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with hot water only and hang
film nearby to dry it. Remove when dry and you should see a surprisingly
clean filmstrip compared to your soiled original.
 Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the soft-
ware supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the options
choices in this software before it finally drops into an Elements Image
window.
 Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pamphlet,
remove the pages or try to make photocopies so the piece you scan lays
flat on the scanner platen. Make sure you observe copyright laws if you’re
scanning printed works. For faxes and photocopies, try to improve origi-
nals by recopying them on a photocopier with darker settings.
 Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you can
acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To find
the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet spot is
the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be darker.
The sweet spot is most often in the top-left quadrant, the lower-right
quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan to place
your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you options for determining resolution and
color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output you
intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accommo-
date a given output. Some considerations include
 Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final output.
If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a Web page,
scan the original with a 50% reduction in size at 72 ppi. (See Chapter 3
for information about resizing images.)
 Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 inches,
scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200% for a
300 dpi image).
 Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only. When
you print line art on laser printers or when preparing files for commercial
printing, the line art resolution should match the device resolution. For
example, printing to a 600 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer requires 600 ppi

for a 1-bit line-art image. When printing to an image setter at a print shop
or going direct to plate or press, the resolution should be 1200 dpi.
 Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases it won’t matter, but with
some images and scanners, you can get better results scanning in RGB
color and converting to grayscale using the Hue/Saturation dialog box,
as we explain in Chapter 3.
 Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16- or
32-bit, by all means scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most data.
See Chapter 3 for more information about working with higher-bit images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a stand-alone application and
a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins are designed
to work inside other software programs like Photoshop Elements. When using
the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to do all your scanning. Here’s how
it works:
1. The first thing to do after installing a new scanner and the accompa-
nying software is to launch Elements and then open the Organizer by
clicking View and Organize Photos in the Welcome Screen. 
2. From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing
Ctrl+K.
3. Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences,
as we describe in Chapter 2.
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know the connection
is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Here’s how to complete your scan:
1. To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪
Get Photos➪From Scanner (you must be in the Organizer window
to access this menu command).
Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software appears
atop the Organizer window, as you see in Figure 4-4. The window is the
scanner software provided by your scanner manufacturer. (Your window
will look different unless you use the same scanner I use.) Regardless of
which software you use, you should have similar options for creating a
preview; selecting resolution, color mode, and image size; scaling; and
other options.
2. Adjust the options according to your output requirements and recom-
mendations made by your scanner manufacturer.
3. When everything is ready to go, click the Scan button, and the final
image drops into an Elements Image window.
79
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

80
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 4-4: When you scan from within Elements, your scanner software 
loads on top of the Elements workspace.
Scanning many photos at once
If you have several photos to scan, you can lay
them out on the scanner platen and perform 
a single scan to acquire all images in one pass.
Arrange the photos to scan on the glass and 
set up all the options in the scanner window for
your intended output. When you scan multiple
images, they form a single scan, as you can see 
in Figure 4-5.
After you scan multiple images, Elements makes it
easy for you to separate each image into its own
Image window, where they can be saved as sepa-
rate files. Choose Image➪Divide Scanned Pictures,
and Elements magically takes each image and
opens it in a separate window, while your original
scan remains intact. The images are neatly tucked
away in the Photo Bin, where you can select them
for editing, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-5: You can scan
multiple images with one pass.

Figure 4-6: After choosing Image➪Divide Scanned Pictures, the scan is split into separate
Image windows.
Getting Files from Storage Media
When you acquire images in Elements from media sources such as CD-ROMs,
DVDs, external hard drives, and your internal hard drive, the process is very
similar to opening files from digital cameras, which we explain earlier in this
chapter. Insert a CD or DVD into the CD/DVD drive and the Windows Wizard
opens just like when inserting a media cartridge or connecting a cable from
your camera to your computer.
Likewise, you can also open these files in the Organizer. Just cancel out of the
Wizard and follow these steps:
1. Open the Organizer window from the Welcome screen or click Photo
Browser from one of the editing modes.
2. When the Organizer window opens, choose File➪Get Photos➪From
Files and Folders.
Alternately, you can click the Open tool or press Ctrl+O. The Get Photos
from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-7.
81
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

82
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 4-7: Use the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box to open 
images stored on CDs, DVDs, external drives, and your hard drive.
3. Open the source drive from the listed drives and you see the photos
stored on the media.
4. Select images and click the Get Photos button to open them in the
Organizer, where they can be edited in Elements or saved to your
hard drive.
Using Online Services
Online printing and sharing services require you to set up an account with 
a service. You can access services provided by Adobe and Kodak from the
Preferences dialog box. To use a service, you begin by setting up an account
with the Organize and Share Preference settings in the Organizer, as we
explain in Chapter 2.
You can create digital photo albums from your images and share them with
friends, family, and coworkers. To initiate a sharing service, you send an e-mail
invitation to others. Each member of your sharing group needs to set up an
account individually. After everyone has an account, you and your friends can
then order prints that are mailed from the online service center. All the kinds
of prints you might order from a local superstore or photo lab are available
from online services, including specialty items, like calendars.
After setting up an account and adjusting your preferences, open the Organizer
and choose File➪Get Photos➪From Online Sharing Service. An Online Sharing
Service Wizard opens, in which you step through an order process. (For more
information about online sharing services, see Chapter 16.)

Phoning In Your Images
At first blush, you may get excited thinking you can just hook up your phone
to your computer, like you can hook up a digital camera, and import your
camera photos directly in the Organizer. Unfortunately, this technology is not
available to Elements as of this writing. To get photos from your cell phone,
you need to follow these steps:
1. Copy photos from your phone to your computer either through a
cable connection or via e-mail.
You use another utility, not Elements, to copy the pictures. Check your
cell phone manual to find out how to transfer files from your phone to
your computer.
Where Elements comes in is simply identifying the folder where you
copy your mobile phone images.
2. In the Organizer, open the Specify Mobile Phone Folder by choosing
File➪Get Photos➪From Mobile Phone.
The Specify Mobile Phone Folder dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8: Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Mobile Phone in 
the Organizer.
3. Click Browse and locate the folder where you copied your mobile
phone images.
After locating the folder, Elements loads all photos in the folder in a new
Organizer window.
4. From the folder, you can select images to edit and print.
Sometimes you can look at existing features in a program and get a clue for
what may be coming in the next version or in a later release. As an example,
look at the menu options for acquiring mobile phone images. There really isn’t
a reason for having this menu command in its current state because you can
just as easily use many other methods for opening files. However, thinking
83
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

84
Part II: Getting Organized 
ahead a little about the future of Photoshop Elements, this feature leads us 
to believe that, as mobile phones become more sophisticated in capturing
images, you will eventually be able to capture images directly from your
phone to the Photoshop Elements Organizer. Keep your eye on Elements and
be certain to participate in regular upgrades to take advantage of new fea-
tures as they are released.
Creating Images from Scratch
You may want to start from scratch by creating a new document in Elements.
New blank pages have a number of uses. You can mix and merge images in a
new document, as we explain in Chapter 8; create a canvas where you can draw
and paint, as we explain in Chapter 12; or use the New dialog box to get some
feedback on file sizes, dimensions, and resolution.
You can create new blank documents by using one of several options. On the
Welcome screen, which appears when you first launch Elements, click Start
from Scratch and the New dialog box opens, in which you choose the docu-
ment size, resolution, and other attributes. Likewise, you can create new files
while working in either editing mode or in the Organizer.
Here’s how you create a new document while working in any editing mode:
1. Open Elements and select an editing mode.
Click either Quick Fix Photos or Edit and Enhance Photos in the Welcome
screen or select View and Organize Photos to open the Organizer.
2. Open the New dialog box by
choosing File➪New➪Blank File
in any workspace. Alternately
you can press Ctrl+N.
Either way, the New dialog box
opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.
3. Select file attributes.
Select the attributes for the new
file. There are several options
from which to choose:
• Name. Type a name for
your file.
• Preset. You can select a preset size from a long drop-down list.
This is optional because you can change the file attributes in the
other text boxes and drop-down menus.
Figure 4-9: Regardless of the method used to
create a new blank document, the New dialog
box opens.

• Units. Units come in handy when you want to examine dimensions
in another unit of measure. If, for example, you have digital camera
images at 3000 pixels by 2000 pixels, that number may not mean
much. You can quickly select inches in either the Width or Height
drop-down menu and the values in the text boxes convert to
inches.
• Dimensions. Values in the Width and Height text boxes are inde-
pendent. Either box can be edited without affecting the other.
• Resolution. Resolution here is similar to editing the resolution
value in the Image Size dialog box when the Resample check box 
is checked. The resolution is an independent value and is not
linked to the dimensions. If you want to know how resolution
changes dimensions without resampling, create a new blank file 
at the known values and click OK. Then choose Image➪Resize➪
Image Size and change values in the Image Size dialog box, which
we discuss in Chapter 3. 
• Color Mode. Your choices are bitmap, grayscale, and RGB. (See
Chapter 3 for more information about color modes.)
• Background Contents. You have three choices: White, Background
Color, and Transparent. The selection you make results in the color
of the blank image. If you choose Background Color, the current
background color assigned in the Tools palette is applied to the back-
ground. See Chapter 12 for information on changing background
color. If you choose Transparent, the image is created as a layer,
as we explain in Chapter 8.
• Image Size. This value dynamically changes as you change Width,
Height, and/or Resolution. The reported value is how much file
size is required to save the uncompressed file.
4. Click OK after setting the file attributes to create the new document.
In addition to creating new blank files, the New dialog box can be a helpful
source of information for all your work in Elements. Suppose you want to
know how many images you can copy to a 128MB USB storage device, or how
large your digital camera files will print with a 150-ppi resolution. All you have
to do is press Ctrl+N to open the New dialog box, plug in the values, and read
the Image Size number or examine the file dimensions. If your files are going
to be converted to grayscale, select Grayscale from the Color Mode drop-
down menu to see how much your file size is reduced by checking out the
Image Size number. This number is dynamic and changes with each change
you make to the file attributes.

Everything You Want to Know about Camera Raw
We added this more elaborate description of Camera Raw in this part of the
chapter after sharing with you all the other options you have for getting images
in Elements. We recognize that not all of our readers have digital cameras
capable of capturing Camera Raw images, so it may not be of much interest
to you now.
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you
might want to look over this section to understand how this file format can
benefit you. When you purchase a camera equipped with Camera Raw sup-
port, you’ll have some understanding of the advantages of using the format.
Understanding Camera Raw
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you take
a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sensor
records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file in
Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose you have your camera set for exposure in tungsten lighting. Tungsten
lighting would be used with tungsten flash photography in a studio. If you take
this camera outside in daylight and shoot an image, all your images appear
with a blue cast. This happens because tungsten lighting requires a cooler
temperature than daylight. See Figure 4-10, later in this chapter, for an exam-
ple of an image taken outdoors with settings for tungsten lighting.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you need to do a lot of
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in
Camera Raw, you just process the image with a warmer temperature (consis-
tent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color correction in
Elements is a fraction of what it would be to fix a JPEG image.
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that is installed with
Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera Raw
plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements editors.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through the first part of this chapter, you know how to acquire
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We won’t bother
going through those steps again; we’ll just assume you have some Camera Raw
images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them, anyway. Opening
files from your hard drive is much faster than working off media cards.

To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:
1. Open the image by pressing Ctrl+O and selecting it in the Open
dialog box.
If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl-click each image.
2. Click Open in the Open dialog box, and all the selected images open
in the Camera Raw window.
If selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the foreground
(Figure 4-10) while the other images appear behind the foreground image.
As you can see, you can use a vast number of options to post-process
your image before you drop it into Elements. This window is like a digital
darkroom where you can process the film and see what you’re doing to
the image before you accept the changes.
Figure 4-10: Open a Camera Raw image and the image opens in the Camera Raw plug-in
window.
87
Chapter 4: Getting Your Images

88
Part II: Getting Organized 
3. Choose from the options to post-process your images.
If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we explain in Chapter 2,
all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw are dynamically updated
in the Image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around and adjust settings to
see the results in the preview area. The more you play with the settings,
the more you will learn about how to get the best out of Camera Raw.
You have a large number of settings in the Camera Raw window, as the follow-
ing list shows. We suggest that you mark this section to refer back to when
you work with Camera Raw images. The options you have are as follows:
 Tools: Five tools appear in the window:
• Use the Zoom tool to zoom in and out of the image preview.
• The Hand tool is used to move the image around like you do in the
Elements image window.
• The Eyedropper tool samples color in the image. We cover using
Elements’ Eyedropper tools in Chapter 12, and that information
also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw window.
After the Eyedropper tool, you find two self-explanatory rotation
tools.
• Rotate Left appears first, and Rotate Right is the last tool you see
below the Title bar.
 Image Preview: The Image Preview shows you all the changes you make
before you eventually open the image in an Elements editor.
 Preview: Notice the Adjust and Details tabs. All adjustments you make in
the tabs can be previewed when this box is checked. Unchecking the box
shows you the image as you first opened it in the Camera Raw window.
 Shadow/Highlight: The Shadow and Highlight check boxes show clipping
in the shadows (dark areas of the image) and highlights (light areas of the
image). Clipping means that, in a certain area, data, and ultimately detail,
has been lost in an image. Think of clipping as something you don’t want
to appear in your pictures. When you make adjustments with these two
check boxes checked, shadow clipping is shown in blue and highlight clip-
ping is shown in red in the image preview. Take a look at Figure 4-11, in
which we exaggerated clipping to show how the clipping preview appears.
 RGB values: When you first open an image, you won’t see any values in
the RGB area. Click the Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper tool
and move the cursor over the image preview. As you move any of these
tools around the image, the RGB values corresponding to the point below
the cursor are reported in this area.

Figure 4-11: Shadow clipping appears in red and highlight clipping 
appears in blue.
 Histogram: The Histogram is a graph displaying all three channels (red,
green, blue) in an image simultaneously. The Histogram changes as you
change other options in the Camera Raw window.
The histogram graphs how pixels in an image are distributed. The distri-
bution includes the number of pixels at each color intensity level (one of
the 256 levels you find out about in Chapter 3).
If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you’ll see the
Histogram skewed to the left. Conversely, images with pixels concen-
trated in the highlights reveal a Histogram skewed to the right.
As you begin to understand histograms more, you can develop your skill
to the point where a quick glance at the histogram will provide you a
clue as to what adjustments you need to make to improve images.
 Settings: From this drop-down menu, you have choices for applying 
settings to the open image. If you change any setting, the menu option
changes to Custom. If you previously made settings choices on a Camera
Raw image and you want to return to the shot as it was taken by the
camera, open the image and select Camera Raw Defaults. Another option
you have is Previous Conversion. This selection is handy if you have a
collection of images that all require the same settings. After adjusting
the first image, open additional images and select Previous Conversion.
The Camera Raw plug-in applies the last settings you made to a Camera
Raw image to the current open file.

the Adjust tab. Click the Details
tab and the options change, as
shown in Figure 4-12. Here you
have three items to adjust by
either dragging the sliders or
typing values in the text boxes. 
Sharpness sharpens images.
You can choose to sharpen
images in the Camera Raw
window or in Elements. Try to
avoid sharpening here and use the sharpening tools in Elements, as we
explain in Chapter 9.
Luminance Smoothing is actually a noise reduction tool. You’ve probably
seen images with a lot of noise. In extreme cases, they look like the 
pictures were printed on sandpaper. Noise in an image is okay if that’s
an effect you intentionally apply to a picture. However, if you want a
smooth-looking image, you’ll want to eliminate any noise introduced by
the camera. Luminance Smoothing reduces grayscale noise. The next
setting is Color Noise Reduction, which is used to reduce color noise.
 White Balance: White Balance settings are used to adjust the color bal-
ance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions under which the shot
was originally taken. Think of the sensor in a digital camera capable of
capturing the entire range of white balance the sensor can see. Here you
make a choice not necessarily for what you see, but for the white balance
for the shot you took. Therefore, if your camera is set for taking pictures
under one set of lighting conditions, and you move to another set of
lighting conditions and forget to change the settings, you can let the
Camera Raw plug-in make a correction for the white balance because the
sensor picked up the entire range and the necessary data are contained
in the file.
In Figure 4-13, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung-
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. The white 
balance options selected in the Settings drop-down menu are listed in
the figure.
 Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite
do the job, you can move the Temperature slider or edit the text box to
settle on values between one White Balance choice and another. Use this
item to fine-tune the White Balance.
 Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance.
This slider and text box are used to correct any green or magenta tints
that may appear in a photo.
Figure 4-12: Click the Details tab to open the
options for sharpness and noise reduction.

Figure 4-13: From the Settings drop-down menu, you have several choices for white balance.
 Brightness adjustments. You have several adjustment sliders and text
boxes for controlling the image brightness and tonal range. Notice the
Exposure setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at the wrong
exposure. In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to push or pull
film during processing, which results in longer and shorter processing
times. Changing exposure times compensates for under- and over-exposing
film. A nice advantage when using Camera Raw is that you can change
exposure for one image and then later open the original Raw image and
change to a different exposure value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed,
but with Camera Raw, you can reprocess over and over again.
Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the
choices you have in the Elements Standard Editing mode. For more 
information on these adjustments, see Chapter 10.

 Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button you
see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt key, and the button changes to Reset.
If you want to scrub all the settings you made and start over, press Alt
and click Reset.
 Open/Update/Skip: This one button has three different purposes.
• The default button is Open. Click Open after you choose all your
settings to process the photo and open it in Elements. 
• Press the Alt key, and the button changes to Update. If you click
Update and then cancel out of the dialog box, the next time you
open the file in the Camera Raw window, you’ll see the changes
you made before the Update button was clicked. This action lets
you change a bunch of settings on several images that you intend
to open and edit later in Elements. 
• Press the Shift key and you see the Skip button. If you open several
images at once, press Shift, and click Skip, the current active window
is dismissed and you move to the next document.
 Save: Clicking Save merely saves your current settings. You can eliminate
the settings saved with the file by selecting Camera Raw Defaults in the
Settings drop-down menu.
 Help: Clicking this button opens a Help document to assist you in under-
standing more about Camera Raw.
 Bit Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths, they
are listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing, you
can select the option from the drop-down menu.
 Zoom: From this drop-down menu, you can choose from several zoom
presets. You can also edit the text box or click the minus (-) button to
zoom out or the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option zooms the
Image preview.

In This Chapter
 Viewing photos in the Organizer
 Navigating the image window
 Sorting photos
 Searching for photos
T
he Organizer is a powerful tool that helps you locate files and keeps your
photos arranged and organized. You can easily access the Organizer by
clicking the Photo Browser button in the Shortcuts bar while you’re in one of
the editing modes. Or, when you open the Welcome screen, click the View
and Organize Photos button.
In this chapter, you discover how to view and organize your pictures in
the Organizer and the Image window and how the many options
help speed up your work in Photoshop Elements.
The Many Faces of the Organizer
The default Organizer view is like a slide sorter,
and this view is one you’re likely to use in all your
Elements work sessions. The Organizer makes
accessing photos an efficient means for opening a
picture in one of the editors. Just double-click a
photo in the Organizer, and you see the image zoom in
size to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully exam-
ine the photo to be certain it’s the one you want and then
just select which editor you want to use from the Edit drop-
down menu.

94
Part II: Getting Organized 
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you have some other oppor-
tunities for examining your pictures. You can view pictures in a slide show, or
you can view pictures side-by-side to compare them.
Adding files to the default Organizer view
Before you explore alternate viewing options in the Organizer, take a look
at how you add photos to the thumbnail images you see in the Organizer
window.
After copying the photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Chapter 4, here’s
how you go about adding those files to an existing group of images in the
Organizer:
1. View photos to add to the Organizer window.
Be certain you have photos in the Organizer window.
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1: The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box.

3. In the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box, choose Thumbnails
from the View menu (the icon with the down arrow, to the far right of
the Look In drop-down menu).
In Thumbnails view, thumbnail images of most of your files appear in a
scrollable window. (Note: you may not see Camera Raw files and some
files saved in different formats.) This view makes it easy to locate the
files you want to add to the Organizer.
4. Select files to add to the Organizer window.
Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl key to select
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos
between the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift-click are selected.
When Ctrl-click, you can select a series of noncontiguous photos.
5. Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer 
window.
6. Add the new photos to the Organizer window you originally opened
by clicking the Back button in the Shortcuts bar.
The photos you add to the Organizer may appear out of order when
viewing the Organizer. Depending on the sort order we explain later in
this chapter, the additional photos you added to the Organizer can appear
before, after, or integrated within the original photos. Use the scroll bar
in the Organizer to view the added photos.
Viewing photos in a slideshow 
(Full Screen View)
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? As an 
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (Full Screen View), complete with transition effects and
background music. Full Screen View takes you to a slide show view. For the
purposes of clarity, think of Full Screen View and viewing a slide show as the
same thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools and
menus and gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see your 
pictures.
Viewing files in a slide show mode can be helpful for taking a quick preview
of the files you want to edit for all kinds of output as well as previewing
photos that you might use for an exported slide show, which we explain in
Chapter 15.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Setting up your images for viewing
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen View, follow these steps:
1. Click the Photo Browser button to open the Organizer and navigate to
a folder of images you want to view.
2. Select individual images to see in a slide show or use all the images
currently in the Organizer for your slide show.
If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen View, all photos in
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen View.
3. Choose View➪View Photos in Full Screen.
The Full Screen View Options dialog box shown in Figure 5-2 opens.
Figure 5-2: Choose View➪View Photos in Full Screen to open the Full Screen 
View Options dialog box, where full-screen viewing options are selected.
4. Choose the options for your slide show in the dialog box.
The Full Screen View Options dialog box offers a number of choices
for viewing a slide show in Full Screen View. Table 5-1 explains each
option.
5. After you determine the attributes for full-screen viewing, click OK.
You enter a full-screen mode. For a moment the Full Screen View toolbar
appears at the top of the window. This toolbar hides automatically after
a few seconds. I explain in Table 5-1 how, if you check the box for Show
Filmstrip, the full-screen view appears as shown in Figure 5-3.

Figure 5-3: When Show Filmstrip is checked, the full screen view shows thumbnail images of
the files selected for viewing on the right side of the image window.

only the first four tools (and this one). When the toolbar is collapsed,
click the arrow again to expand to the default toolbar.
Moving around the Image Window
When you edit images in either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, you continu-
ally interact with the image window. Whether you’re zooming in and out of a
single window or viewing multiple windows, you need to comfortably work
in this area for all your editing tasks. To help you move around the image
window, Elements provides a rich set of tools. Try to become familiar with the
many viewing options and keyboard shortcuts available in Elements, and all
your editing jobs will be much easier. The following tools, menu commands,
and palettes are essential tools for just about everything you do in Elements.
Zooming in and out of images
Zooming in and out of images is a task you perform routinely while editing
images in the image window and also when working in other windows, such
as the Camera Raw window and the Full Screen View window. Zooming in is
necessary when you want to precisely edit a section of an image or examine
detail in a small area. You then need to zoom out to see the edits as they com-
pare to the entire image.

Zoom by clicking
The Zoom tool appears on the Tools palette. To use the tool for zooming in
and out, take a look at how it all works:
1. Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette to select it (or simply press Z).
2. Move the cursor, now loaded with the Zoom tool, to the image window
and click the place where you want to zoom.
To zoom in more, click again; keep clicking until you zoom far enough in.
3. To zoom out of an image, keep the Zoom tool selected, hold down the
Alt key, and click.
The cursor changes to a magnifying glass tool with a minus (-) symbol
when you hold down the Alt key.
Zoom to a selection
Another way to change a view is to zoom to a target area in an image.
Here’s how:
1. Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette.
2. Drag a box around the area you want to zoom.
A dashed rectangle marquee appears as shown in Figure 5-6.
Figure 5-6: Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette and drag around an area you want to zoom.
101
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

102
Part II: Getting Organized 
3. Move the rectangle marquee if you need to adjust the selection.
Now it’s time to get fancy. If you have a marquee drawn with the Zoom
tool and the size appears just right, but you want to move just the rec-
tangle, press the Spacebar while you keep the mouse button pressed.
You can drag the marquee rectangle anywhere in the image to zoom to
the area defined by the rectangle boundary.
4. Release the mouse button. 
The view zooms to fit the space defined by the marquee rectangle.
Using the Options bar
Above the image window and below the Shortcuts bar, you find the Options
bar. The Options bar is ever-changing, offering different options as you
select different tools in the Tools palette. When you click the Zoom tool,
the Options bar changes, as shown in Figure 5-7. You have many similar
choices for zooming in and out of images and a few options unique to the
Options bar:
Figure 5-7: Click the Zoom tool in the Tools palette, and the Options bar changes to reflect choices for
zooming in and out of images.
a Zoom In/Zoom Out tools: You can choose zoom in or zoom out as sepa-
rate tools to avoid using the Alt key to toggle between the two.
b Zoom percentage: This figure shows you the current zoom level as a
percentage. You can edit the text by typing values between 1 and 1600.
c Zoom slider: Click the right-pointing arrow and a slider bar opens. Drag
the slider left to zoom out or right to zoom in.
d Resize Windows To Fit: Check this box to resize the window along with
the image zoom. Uncheck the box to zoom in and out of an image while
the Image window remains at a fixed size.
e Ignore Palettes: This check box is selected when you check the Resize
Windows To Fit checkbox. Checking this box ignores palettes when using
the Zoom tool so you can zoom to an area covered by the palettes. If you
uncheck the box, you can’t zoom to an area beneath the Palette Bin.

f Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple images open and check
this box, zooming with the Zoom tool zooms all open documents 
simultaneously.
g Actual Pixels/Fit Screen/Print Size: The same options are available as
discussed earlier, in the “Working with the toolbar” section.
Viewing multiple documents
When you need to view two or more images at once, choose Window➪Images to
open a submenu of viewing options used for viewing multiple files. The Window
menu also provides a list of all your open documents. Here’s a list of options
you find on the submenu:
 Maximize Mode: While in Maximize Mode, you see only one image
window and lose the option for resizing the window by dragging the
lower right corner in or out. If you want to bring back the title bar and
the resizing options, return to the Window➪Images➪Maximize Mode
command. Notice the check box next to Maximize Mode; click the check
box to remove the check mark in the submenu and you minimize the
Image window.
 Tile: Tiling images reduces Image window sizes to a size that accommo-
dates viewing all images in scrollable windows within the Elements
workspace. Choose Window➪Images➪Tile when multiple images are
open to get a view similar to Figure 5-8.
 Cascade: Choose Window➪Images➪Cascade and the image windows
overlap each other in a cascading view.
 Match Zoom: Set the zoom level for one of several images open in
Elements and choose Window➪Images➪Match Zoom. All open docu-
ments are zoomed to the same level as the foreground image.
 Match Location: If you zoom into, for example, the top-right corner and
then select Match Location, all open images zoom to the same location
in the respective photos.
 Bring image to foreground: As you open photos, the open documents
are listed by name in the Window menu. The current active document is
the foreground image. If you want to edit another image, choose Window
and select the image you want to edit, and that image comes to the fore-
ground as the active image.
Although you have a menu command to bring images to the foreground
and make them active, you can perform the same action by clicking an
image thumbnail in the Photo Bin.
103
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

104
Part II: Getting Organized 
Figure 5-8: Open several images in one of the editing modes and choose Window➪Images➪Tile to show all
image windows.
Using Pan and Zoom
When you zoom in on a document larger than the image window can accom-
modate, scroll bars provide a means for moving the image inside the window.
Moving the image around a window is panning the image.
You can also use the Hand tool to pan the image. Zoom into an image and
click the Hand tool. Click and drag the image around the window. If you want
to zoom in or out while the Hand tool is selected, hold down the Ctrl key and
the Hand tool temporarily changes to the Zoom In tool. Hold down Ctrl+Alt
and the Hand tool temporarily changes to the Zoom Out tool.

Using the Navigator palette
The Navigator palette affords you
several different options for both
zooming and panning an image.
To open the Navigator palette, choose
Window➪Navigator. The Navigator
palette, shown in Figure 5-9, opens
as a floating palette in the Elements
workspace. (For more information
on floating palettes, see Chapter 1).
While you select options for zoom-
ing in the Navigator palette, the
image preview in the palette window
stays fixed to show you the entire
image. As you zoom in and out inside
the palette, the corresponding zoom
is applied to the active document.
Either use the zoom tools in the palette or drag the slider left and right to
zoom in and out. If you place the cursor inside the image preview thumbnail,
you can drag a rectangle and zoom into the image.
Using the Navigator palette can be particularly helpful if you use two moni-
tors. Just drag the Navigator palette to your second monitor where you can
change zoom levels without having the palette obscure the background
image.
Sorting Your Photos
With all of Photoshop Elements’ modes and workspaces, you need a consis-
tent starting place to handle all your editing tasks. Think of the Organizer
as Grand Central Station, and from this central location, you can take the
Long Island Railroad to any destination you desire. In Elements terms,
instead of heading out to Port Washington, you travel to an editing mode.
Instead of going to the Hamptons, you journey through all the creation
areas. In short, the Organizer is the central depot on the Photoshop
Elements map.
105
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Figure 5-9: The Navigator palette.

106
Part II: Getting Organized 
In addition to being a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the Organizer 
is a management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and describe
photos with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing files,
Elements provides many different options, and we cover them all in the fol-
lowing sections.
Using sort commands
In the lower-left corner of the Organizer window
is a pop-up menu that provides some sorting
options, as shown in Figure 5-10. Alternatively,
you can choose View➪Arrangement, and a sub-
menu providing the same commands opens.
The sorting options available to you are
 Date (Newest First): Select this option to
view images according to the date you
took the photos, beginning with the most
recent date.
 Date (Oldest First): This option displays photos in chronological order
starting with the oldest file.
 Import Batch: You may import a batch of photos in one Photoshop
Elements session and import another batch in the same session or in
another session. When you select Import Batch, the images appear 
organized in groups, according to the date the batch was created.
In Figure 5-11, you can see several batches imported and added as
Collections, which we describe in Chapter 6.
 Folder Location: Click Folder Location and you see an Explorer pane on
the left side of the Organizer window. You can browse your hard drive for
folder locations and select a folder containing images you imported into
the Organizer.
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according to media type. Elements supports view-
ing photos, video files, audio files, creations, and PDF files. To select different
media types, choose View➪Media Types, and the Items Shown dialog box
opens. Check the boxes for the media types you want to display in the
Organizer window.
Figure 5-10: The Organizer’s sort
options.

Figure 5-11: When importing photos in batches, you can sort files according to batch import dates.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching photos. From the
Find menu, you can locate photos in collections, catalogs, and the Organizer
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
In order to use the commands in the Find menu, you need to have photos
loaded in the Organizer window or create Collections or Catalogs, which we
explain in Chapter 6. The following categories can be searched in the Organizer.
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window from
photos shot at different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos,
and all other types of files supported by Elements, through a date search.
To search files by date, do the following:
107
Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images

108
Part II: Getting Organized 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files. 
To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and
Folders submenu command.
2. Select a date range by choosing
Find➪Set Date Range.
The Set Date Range dialog box,
shown in Figure 5-12, opens.
3. Specify the dates.
Type a year in the Start Date
Year text box. Select the month
and day from the Month and
Day drop-down menus. Repeat
the same selections for the End Date.
4. Click OK.
The thumbnails shown in the Organizer window include only files cre-
ated within the specified date range.
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain in Chapter 6.
When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels. We
cover sorting by tag labels in Chapter 6, too. For now, take a look at the Find
menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you haven’t added tags to
some items and you want to show only the untagged files so you can begin to
add tags, choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl+Shift+Q. Elements displays
all files without tags in the Organizer window.
Searching collections
Collections are another item we address in Chapter 6. You can create collections
and then select a collection in the Collections palette. Selecting a Collection
is like having a first level of sorting. You can then search by date or other sort
options discussed here to narrow down the choices.
Searching captions and notes
In Chapter 6, we talk about adding captions and notes to your files. When
captions and/or notes are added to files, you can search on the caption
name, contents of a note, or both. To search caption names and notes, do
the following:
Figure 5-12: Open the Set Date Range dialog
box and specify the start and end dates.

1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
If you’re opening files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files
and Folders submenu command.
2. Choose Find➪By Caption
or Note.
The Find by Caption or Note
dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 5-13. Options in the
dialog box are
• Find Items with Caption
or Note: In the text box,
type the word(s) you want
to search.
• Match Only the Beginning
of Words in Captions and
Notes. Click this radio button when you know your caption or note
begins with words you type in the text box.
• Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes. Check this box
if you’re not sure if the text typed in the box is used at the begin-
ning of a caption or note or if it is contained within the caption
name or note text.
3. Click OK.
The Results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do with your photos, such as printing,
e-mailing, sharing, and a number of other tasks. You can search for files
based on the file history by choosing Find➪By History. Selecting options
in the By History submenu reports files found on date searches meeting the
history criteria. The By History submenu options are as follows:
 Imported on: Select this option when you want to search files you
imported in the Organizer.
 Received from: Select this option to find files e-mailed to you from other
users.
 E-mailed to: Use this option when you want to search for files you
e-mailed to other users.

 Printed on: Use this option when you want to search for files you printed.
 Exported on: Use this option for searching files exported to your com-
puter or mobile phone.
 Ordered Online: Use this option to search for files that were ordered
online.
 Shared Online: Use this option to find files you shared with other users
online.
 Used in Creations: Use this option for searching files you used in
Creations.
 In HTML Photo Galleries: Use this option to find files you used in Web
galleries, which we explain in Chapter 15.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes both information about your images that is supplied by
digital cameras and custom data you add to a file. Metadata contains descrip-
tions of the image, such as the camera settings you used to take a picture,
copyright information, and much more. We cover searching metadata in
Bonus Chapter 3 on this book’s Web site so that you can get a feel for how
metadata is added to a file and how to view it. 
Searching faces
If there is a magical method available to you for searching files in Elements, it
has to be searching for faces. When you choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging,
Elements searches through files you select in the Organizer window and exam-
ines each image for a face — Homo sapiens faces to be exact.
Note that you must first select image thumbnails in the Organizer window
and then choose Find➪Find Faces for Tagging. If you want to search through
all files in the Organizer, press Ctrl+A or choose Edit➪Select All. Be aware
that if you search through a large catalog, Elements will take some time to
complete the search.
The results of the search magically include all photos containing faces in a
new Organizer window. Although the command is intended to identify images
you can tag, you can use the command for invoking a search and choose to
view all files containing faces.

D
ownloading a bunch of media cards filled with photos and
leaving them in folders distributed all over your hard
drive is like having a messy office with papers stacked all
over your desk. Trying to find a file, even with all the
great search capabilities we cover in Chapter 5, can
take you as much time as sorting through piles of
papers. What you need is a good file-mangement
system.
In this chapter, we talk about organizing and anno-
tating files and the important task of backing up files.
Be certain to take a little time to understand the orga-
nization methods that Elements provides and keep
your files organized as you copy them to your hard drive
and back up files to CD-ROMs or DVDs. Time you invest in
organizing your pictures will help you quickly locate files when
you need them.

112
Part II: Getting Organized 
Organizing Groups of Images with Collections
Elements provides you a great opportunity for organizing files in the form of
collections. After you acquire your images in the Organizer, as we discuss in
Chapter 4, you’ll want to sort them out and add them to some permanent col-
lections according to the dates you took the pictures, the subject matter, or
some other categorical arrangement.
In the Organizer window, two palettes help you sort your pictures and keep
them well organized. You use the Tags palette, which we talk about in the next
section, to identify individual images by using a limitless number of options
for categorizing your pictures. The second palette is the Collections palette.
Here you can create collections and collection groups to neatly organize files.
Collections are handy when you want to use the many different creation
options that we explain in Chapter 16. You create a collection from files
stored in various folders on your hard drive and preview the images to be
used in a creation. Select the images you want to use when creating slide
shows, photo albums, and so on. When you finish with the creations, go
back and delete the collection.
In the following sections, you find out how to create and manage collections.
Creating a new collection
To create a new collection and add photos to the collection, do the following:
1. Open photos in the Organizer.
Open the Organizer window by clicking the Photo Browser button in an
editing mode or selecting View and Organize
Photos on the Welcome screen. Choose
File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
Note that you should have copied some
photos to your hard drive, as we explain in
Chapter 4.
2. If you don’t see the Collections tab and 
the Organize Bin open, choose Window➪
Organize Bin.
By default, the Organize Bin should be open
to the Collections tab.
3. To create a new Collection, choose New➪
New Collection on the Collections tab.
The Edit Collection dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1: The Edit Collection
dialog box.

4. Type a name for the Collection in the Name text box and add a note to
describe the collection.
You might use the location where you took the photos, the subject
matter, or other descriptive information.
5. Click OK in the Edit Collection dialog box.
You return to the Organizer window.
6. In the Organizer window, select the photos you want to add to your
collection.
Click a photo and Shift-click another photo to select photos in a group.
Click a photo and Ctrl-click different photos scattered around the
Organizer window to select photos in a nonconsecutive order.
7. To add the selected photos to the new col-
lection, click one of the selected photos in
the Organizer window and drag the photo
thumbnail to the new collection icon in the
Organize Bin.
When you release the mouse button, the
photos are added to the new collection.
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create collec-
tions for all the images you want to organize.
9. To view one or more collections, click the
empty square(s) adjacent to a collection
icon to show the photos within that collec-
tion in the Organizer window.
When you click the empty square, an icon in
the shape of a pair of binoculars appears
inside the square, as shown in Figure 6-2.
Working with collections
You can manage collections by using menu commands from the New drop-down
menu and other commands from a context menu opened by right-clicking a
collection in the Collections tab.
From the New drop-down menu, you have commands for
 New Collection: Create a new collection, as described in the steps ear-
lier in this chapter.
 New Collection Group: You can group several collections in a collection
group and share your files with a sharing service. Select multiple collec-
tions and select New Collection Group to open the Create Collection Group
dialog box.
113
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-2: Click the empty square
adjacent to the collection icon.

114
Part II: Getting Organized 
 Save Collections to a File: You can save collections to a file that can be
retrieved using the From File command. This option is handy when you
open a different catalog file and you want to import the same collection
names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See “Cataloging
Files,” later in this chapter.)
 From File: Import a saved collection.
Right-click the mouse button on a collection name and the following menu
commands appear:
 Edit <collection name> Collection: Select Edit <collection name>
Collection and the Edit Collection dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 6-1. You can use this command to rename a collection or change
the note. Alternatively, you can click the Pencil tool in the palette to
open the same dialog box.
 Delete <collection name> Collection: Select a collection and click this
menu option to delete a collection. Alternatively, click the Trash icon in
the palette to delete a collection. Note that deleting a collection does not
delete files.
 Find Items in <collection name> Collection: Opening a context menu
on a collection not visible in the Organizer window and selecting this
option is the same as when you click the empty square adjacent to a 
collection icon. All the photos in the collection appear in the Organizer
window.
 Add <number> Items to <collection name> Collection: If you select one
photo in the organizer, the number is one. Selecting more than one photo
changes the number to the total number of selected images. When you
open a context menu, the selected image(s) is added to the collection
where the context menu is opened.
Collections are automatically saved with the Catalog you work with. By default,
Elements creates a Catalog and auto-saves your work to the Catalog. If you
happen to create another Catalog, as we explain next in this chapter, your
collections disappear. You need to be aware of what Catalog is open when
you create collections in order to return to them.
Cataloging Files
As you open files in the Organizer, all your files are automatically saved to a
catalog. The files themselves are not really saved to the catalog, but rather
links from the catalog to the individual files are saved. Links are like pointers
that tell the catalog where to look for a file. As you add and delete files, the
catalog is constantly updated.

As you open more files in the Organizer, the default catalog file grows, and
the maximum size of the catalog file is limited only by your available hard
drive space. Working with a single catalog file has some disadvantages.
For example, if your catalog file becomes corrupted and unrecoverable, you
lose all the work you’ve done organizing files into collections. If you work
with many files, the Organizer performance slows down.
Rather than work with a single catalog file, you can fine-tune your file organi-
zation by creating several catalogs. You might want to organize files according
to subject matter, dates, locations, or some other division of categories and
create separate catalogs for each category. You find all the details in the sec-
tions that follow.
Splitting a big catalog into smaller catalogs
Here’s how you go about breaking up a large catalog into a smaller one:
1. Open files in the Organizer.
If you have a large collection of files, say 100 images or more, open in an
Organizer window, you can start with your open files. If you don’t yet
have files open, use the File➪Get Photos menu command and get photos
from one of the submenu commands to load up the Organizer window.
2. Open the Catalog dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-3, by choos-
ing File➪Catalog.
Here’s something to keep in mind
when working with catalogs:
You don’t create or access cata-
logs by using menu commands.
All the aspects of working with
a catalog are handled in the
Catalog dialog box.
3. Duplicate the catalog file by
clicking the Save As button in
the Catalog dialog box.
The Save Catalog As dialog box
opens. By using Save As, you
are duplicating the current Organizer window and saving it as a new cat-
alog file.
4. Type a descriptive name for the catalog in the File Name text box and
click OK.
When you’re done, you return to the Organizer window.
115
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-3: Choose File➪Catalog to open the
Catalog dialog box.

116
Part II: Getting Organized 
5. Add and delete files in the Organizer.
You can delete files that don’t belong to your newly created catalog topic
and add additional files by using the File➪Get Photos menu command.
Furthermore, you can add or delete collections, as described in the pre-
ceding section in this chapter. The view you create in the Organizer is
automatically saved to your new catalog file.
When you delete a file from a catalog, Elements prompts you in a dialog
box to confirm the deletion. Also in the dialog box is a check box for
deleting files from your hard disk. If you check the box, the file is deleted
from your hard disk. Be certain to exercise caution so you don’t inadver-
tently delete your only copy of a photo.
Importing photos to a new catalog
To keep your photos organized and your catalog files smaller, you can start a
completely new catalog before you import photos. Follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and click New in the Catalog dialog box.
2. When the New Catalog dialog box opens, type a name for the new cat-
alog in the File Name text box and click Save.
3. If you want to add free music files installed with Elements, check the
box for Import Free Music into All New Catalogs.
4. You can use the File➪Get Photos menu commands to add files to the
new catalog.
When the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, a list
of media files appears in the dialog box when the Import Free Music
into All New Catalogs checkbox is enabled. You can select the free
music files to add to your collection; then navigate your hard drive
and check the photos you want to add. After you’ve identified all files,
click Open and the selected music files and photos are added to your
new collection.
Switching to a different catalog
When you need to open a different catalog file, choose File➪Catalog and click
Open. All your catalogs appear in the default folder where the catalogs are
saved. Click a catalog and click Open and the Organizer window changes to
reflect files contained in the respective catalog.
Note in Figure 6-3 the Recover button. If you can’t see thumbnail previews of
images or open them in one of the editing modes, your catalog file may be
corrupted. Click the Recover button to try to fix the problem.

117
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Tag — You’re It!
If you want to sort files into subcategories, Elements provides tags for identi-
fying common files.
Think of a catalog as being a parent item and collections as its children.
Within collections, you can sort files according to date by using sort options
discussed in Chapter 5. If you still have a number of files in an Organizer
window that are hard to manage, you can create tags that form subcategories
within the collections. These tags can be 
 Ratings you assign to files, such as five stars down to one star in the
Favorites area of the Tags palette.
 Groups like family, friends, and places.
 Some other custom category you want to define by tagging files with
these items.
After creating tags and applying the tags to files in a catalog, clicking the box
adjacent to a tag name in the Tags palette in the Organize Bin shows you all
files assigned to the given tag. You can further sort the tagged files according
to date, as described in Chapter 5.
Tags are handled with menu commands from the Tags drop-down menu.
Click the Tags tab in the Organize Bin and click the down arrow adjacent to
the New button to open the menu. Menu options associated with tags are
 New Tag: Click this menu command to open the Create Tag dialog box,
where new tags are added to the Tags palette.
 New Subcategory: Select this menu command to create a new 
subcategory.
 New Category: Select this menu command to create a new tag category.
 From File. Select this menu command to load tags that were saved using
the Save Tags to File command.
 Save Tags to File. Select this menu command to save tags to an XML
(eXtensible Markup Language) file. XML files can be exported and
imported in various ways in Elements, such as when using Collections
and Tags. You can then open a different catalog, use the From File com-
mand, and all the new tags created in another catalog are imported into
the current open catalog. This feature can save you a lot of time organiz-
ing files.

118
Part II: Getting Organized 
As an example, suppose you’re a wedding photographer and you create
catalogs for each individual wedding you shoot (if you combine a few
weddings in one catalog, you can create separate collections for each
individual wedding). You can create tags for the pre-ceremony shots of
the bride dressing, the groom dressing, another set of tags for the cere-
mony, and another set of tags for the reception. After you create your
first catalog and identify the tags, export the file by using the Save Tags
to File command. Each time you shoot a new wedding, you load the tags
into a new catalog file by using the From File menu command.
Creating new tags
New tags can be added as subsets to existing tags. You can create new tags,
add icons for the appearance of tags, and assign tags to selected files in a 
catalog file.
Here’s how you go about creating tags:
1. Choose File➪Catalog and open a catalog you created for a particular
category.
If you haven’t created a catalog, use files you open in the Organizer
window.
2. On the Tags tab in the Organize Bin, choose New➪New Tag.
The Create Tag dialog box opens.
3. To add an icon appearance, click the Edit
Icon button.
The icon you add appears in the Tags palette
to help you easily identify tags. The Edit Tag
Icon dialog box shown in Figure 6-4 opens.
4. Click the Import button.
The Import Image for Tag Icon dialog box
opens.
5. Locate an image you want to use, select it,
and click Open.
You can use any photo saved in .jpg, .bmp,
.png, or .gif format. (See Chapter 3 for
more information on file formats.) When
the image is imported, an image preview is
displayed in the dialog box, as shown in
Figure 6-4.
6. If the image preview is what you want, click OK in the Edit Tag Icon
dialog box. If not, click the Import button and select another image.
Figure 6-4: Click Edit Icon in the
Create Tag dialog box to open
the Edit Tag Icon dialog box.

You return to the Create Tag dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-5, after importing an icon.
7. The Category drop-down menu identifies all
the categories currently in the Tags palette.
Select the category where you want your
new tag to appear as a child to the category.
8. Type a name for your tag in the Name
text box.
9. Add a note to describe the tag.
10. Click OK when finished.
Your new tag is added to the Tags palette.
Creating new categories
In the Create Tag dialog box, the categories in the Category drop-down menu
come from the category list in the Tags palette. If you want to use a category
not available among the default tags, you can create your own new custom
category by following these steps:.
1. Choose File➪Catalog and open a catalog you created for a particular
category.
If you haven’t created a catalog, use files you open in the Organizer
window.
2. On the Tags palette, choose New➪
New Category.
The Create Category dialog box shown in
Figure 6-6 opens.
3. Click the Choose Color button in the Create
Category dialog box and select a color from
the color palette that opens.
4. Type a name for the category in the
Category Name text box.
5. Select an icon in the Category Icon list by
clicking it. 
You can scroll the list of icons by dragging the slider bar back and forth
or click the left and right arrows. All icons you can assign to a category
are available from this list. Elements doesn’t provide an option for creat-
ing custom icons for categories.
6. Click OK.
The category is added to the Tags palette.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Creating new subcategories
When you open the Organizer and click the Tags palette, you see several tag
categories that Elements provides you by default. Categories such as Hidden,
People, Places, Events, and Other are tags that always appear when you create
any new collection. If you want to add custom subcategories to these default
tags, Elements offers you a menu command to do so.
Do the following to create a subcategory:
1. In the Organizer window, open a catalog in which you created a
custom category.
2. On the Tags palette, choose New➪
New Sub-Category.
The Create Sub-Category dialog box opens,
as shown in Figure 6-7.
Alternatively, you can right-click a tag in
the Tags palette and select Create New 
Sub-Category in <category or subcategory
name> Category.
3. Type a name for the subcategory in the
Sub-Category Name text box.
4. Select a parent category from the Parent Category or Sub-Category
drop-down list.
Subcategories appear as children below parent categories or below
other subcategories. You can see all the categories and subcategories
created in the open catalog.
5. Click OK.
The subcategory is added below the category or subcategory in the
Tags palette.
Assigning and managing tags
After creating categories and subcategories in the Tags palette, you’ll want to
assign tags to files. Once the tags are assigned, you can further manage the tags.
To assign tags to a file, do any of the following:
 Drag and drop files to a tag. You can drag one or more files shown in
the Organizer window and drop the file(s) on top of a tag in the Tags
palette. The file(s) is then tagged.
 Drag and drop a tag to a file. You can tag files by dragging and dropping
a tag from the Tags palette to a file in the Organizer window or to a group
of selected files.
Figure 6-7: The Create Sub-
Category dialog box.

 Tag categories. Drag a file to a category name or drag the category name
in the Tags palette to the selected file(s). The tag appears at the root of a
category and does not appear in any subcategories.
 Tag subcategories. Drag a file to a subcategory name or drag the sub-
category name in the Tags palette to the selected file(s). The tag appears
in the subcategory and does not appear in the root category.
 Use a menu command. Select a file or files in the Organizer and then
right-click a category or subcategory name. From the context menu that
appears, select Attach <category name> to <number> Selected Item(s).
Using a context menu opened by right-clicking a category or subcategory,
you have menu options for managing files. The menu commands include the
name of the category from which you open the context menu. The options in
a context menu are
 Create New Tag in <category name> Category: Creates a new tag as if
using the New Tag command from the New drop-down menu in the Tags
palette.
 Create New Sub-Category in <category name> Category: Creates a new
subcategory as if using the New Sub-Category command in the New drop-
down menu in the Tags palette.
 Edit <category name> Category: Use this command when you want to
edit a category name, icon appearance, or parent/subcategory.
 Delete <category name> Category: Select a category or subcategory
and choose this menu command to delete it. Alternatively, you can click
the Trash icon in the Tags palette.
 Expand All Tags in <category name> Category: Child subcategories can
be either hidden or in view below a category name. Select this menu
command to show the subcategories in the Tags palette.
 Collapse All Tags in <category name> Category: Select this command
to hide subcategories in the Tags palette.
 New Search Using <category name> Category: Selecting this menu item
results in the same view as when clicking the square in the Tags palette
adjacent to a tag name. Only files with the selected tag are viewed in the
Organizer.
 Add Photos with <category name> Category to Search Results: You can
search for photos in the Organizer by using the search options discussed
in Chapter 5. Use this menu item to add tagged files to the search results.
 Exclude Photos with <category name> Category from Search Results:
Use this command to exclude tagged items from search results.
Note that if you open a context menu on a category name versus opening a
context menu on a subcategory name, the menu items change. If you don’t
see an option that’s listed here when opening a context menu on a category,
open a context menu on a subcategory and you’ll find the command.

Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

122
Part II: Getting Organized 
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so you can keep your images orga-
nized and easy to find.
The hidden tag is in the Tags palette. This tag hides files in the Organizer
window. You might use the hidden tag to hide similar images or one image
with different variations while keeping only one image in view in the Organizer
window. (You can tag files with the hidden tag by using any of the methods for
tagging files that we discuss in the preceding section.) Files remain hidden
when you check the box adjacent to the Hidden tag.
Other ways to hide images are to create stacks and versions. Again, thinking
about an image with several different variations or versions, you can create a
stack in which the best image is displayed in the Organizer window and all
members of the stack group are hidden behind that foreground image. Addi-
tionally, you can create a version set, in which different versions of the same
image are hidden while one version remains in view in the Organizer. In the fol-
lowing sections, we explain in more detail how you create stacks and versions.
Stack ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards face-up. You see only the front card, and
all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the same way:
You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any time, you can
sort the images or display all images in the stack in the Organizer window.
To create a stack, follow these steps:
1. In the Organizer, select several photos.
You can select any number of photos. You cannot stack audio or movie files.
2. Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
Elements stacks your photos. The first image you
select remains in view in the Organizer window. In
the upper right, an icon that looks like a stack of
cards appears on the image thumbnail, as shown in
the nearby figure. The thumbnail itself appears as
though it sits atop a stack of other thumbnails.
After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu commands
to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose Edit➪Stack.
The submenu commands available include
 Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you
have several photos selected to create a stack.
 Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and select this command
to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the stack.

 Reveal Photos in Stack: This command opens a new Organizer window
and shows you all the individual images contained in a stack.
 Flatten Stack: After stacking some photos, this command becomes 
available. 
Be careful with this option. When you flatten a stack, all photos but the
top photo are deleted from the catalog (not from your hard disk).
 Remove Photo from Stack: Selecting this command removes the selected
photo(s) from the stack. The menu item is available only after you choose
Reveal Photos in Stack. In the new Organizer window that appears, you
can then select this menu command.
 Set as Top Photo: You also need to first Reveal Photos in Stack before
accessing this command. If you don’t like the topmost photo, select
another and choose this menu command to move the selected photo
to the top of the stack.
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in an expanded form,
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command does not require you
to individually select stacks in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file.
You can edit an image and save the edited version and the original as a ver-
sion set. Additional edits can be made in either editing mode and saved to a
version set.
To create a version set, do the following:
1. Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.
2. Apply an edit.
For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness
in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast and 
brightness. See Chapter 10 for more details on adjusting contrast
and brightness.
3. View the items in the Version Set by clicking the image in the Organizer
and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Reveal Items in Version Set.
Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply the
Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and shows two
thumbnail images — one representing the original image and the other
representing the edited version.
4. To open the original in Standard Edit mode, select the original image
and choose Edit➪Go to Standard Edit from the drop-down menu in
the Organizer Shortcuts bar.
123
Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos

124
Part II: Getting Organized 
5. Edit the image in Standard Edit mode.
You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image.
As an example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Chapter 3.
6. Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
7. In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, check the boxes
for Include in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with Original.
8. Click Save.
The edit made in Standard Edit mode is saved as another version in your
version set.
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu and
select menu commands that are similar to commands available with stacks
(see the preceding section for details). 
Sticking Digital Notes on Your Photos
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities discussed earlier
in this chapter is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption and/or
note, you can search captions and notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or
Note menu command. Captions and notes are
also helpful when creating different collections —
like slide presentations and photo albums — by
using the Create command, as we explain in
Chapter 16.
Text captions are easy to create. Although you can
select a thumbnail image in the Organizer window
and select Edit➪Add Caption, a better way is to
use the Properties palette. Just follow these steps:
1. To open the palette, select a thumbnail
image in the Organizer, right-click it, and
choose Show Properties from the context
menu that appears.
Alternatively, you can select Window➪
Properties. In either case the Properties
palette opens, as shown in Figure 6-8.
2. Type a caption by adding text to the Caption text box.
3. Type text in the Notes area in the palette to add a note.
That’s all there is to it. You can also record audio notes about an image.
Find out how in Bonus Chapter 1 on this book’s Web site. (See the
Introduction for details about the Web site.)
Figure 6-8: The Properties palette
docked in the Organize Bin.

Automating Your Organization
If you have a number of common edits you want to make on a collection of
photos, Elements lets you perform common changes to multiple files.
In earlier versions of Elements, you used the Process Multiple Files command
for some of the features that have now been moved to the Export command
in Photoshop Elements 4. Other features that were once in the Process Multiple
Files dialog box, such as adding captions, have been moved to the Properties
palette. File renaming can be part of the Export command, or you can use a
menu option for renaming files in the Organizer.
Automating common tasks when you export
You may use the Export Selected Items dialog box frequently when acquiring
images from digital cameras. What you may not know is that this dialog box
can automate other common tasks, too: 
 Add common base names for the filenames (for example, change names
like DSC000001, DSC000002, and so on, to more descriptive filenames,
like Budapest 001 and Budapest 002).
 Change file format.
 Change file size and quality.
Here’s how you go about using options in the Export dialog box:
1. Select files and open the Export Selected Items dialog box by choosing
File➪Export➪To Computer.
The Export Selected Items dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-9.
It’s not critical to select files beforehand. You can identify files in another
dialog box accessible from within the Export Selected Files dialog box.
If you know ahead of time which files you want to export, go ahead and
select them in the Organizer window.
2. Select a file type.
From the File Type options, choose the format you want to use for the
exported images. For more information on file formats, see Chapter 3.
3. Select a size and quality.
If you select Original Format, resizing options are grayed out. You use
this setting when you want to retain original size when you rename files.
If you select JPEG, you can move the quality slider, as we explain in
Chapter 3, for setting image quality of JPEG images. All other format
options don’t provide a quality option.

1. Select the files you want to rename.
2. Choose File➪Rename.
The Rename dialog box opens.
3. In the text box, type a base name for the files and click OK.
The selected files are renamed using a common base name. You’ll find
this a quick and easy way to rename those digital camera images.

Protecting Your Photos
The lesson most often learned the hard way by computer users is backing
up a hard drive and the precious data you spent time creating and editing.
We’ll save you some aggravation right now before you spend any more time
editing your photos in Elements.
Routine backup is critical for any kind of work you perform on computers.
We authors are so paranoid when writing a book that we back up our chap-
ters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs as chapters are written. The standard
rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets to the
point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s time to
back up files.
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately,
Elements makes the pains of finding files to back up a breeze.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your precious data:
1. Choose File➪Backup to open the Burn/Backup Wizard.
This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through to pain-
lessly create a backup of your files.
2. Select the source to backup.
The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
• Copy/Move Files: Use this option to copy files to the target media
or hard disk location.
• Backup the Catalog: Use this option to copy the catalog file.
3. Click Next and select a backup method.
Depending on what you chose in the first pane, you have different
options in the second pane. The options include
Options for Copy/Move Files: If you select Copy/Move Files in the first
pane, you can choose from the following:
• Move Files: Check this box to move files to another media source
and delete the files from your hard drive after moving them. Elements
retains a file on your hard drive for identifying the source where
files are copied. If you open the Organizer and attempt to edit a
file, Elements prompts you to insert the media where the moved
files are stored.
• Copy/Move All Files in the Stack: Check this box to copy/move all
files in Stacks.
• Copy/Move All Files in the Version Set: Check this box to include all
files in Version Sets.

Part II: Getting Organized 
Options for Backup the Catalog: If you select Backup the Catalog in the
first pane, the options in Step 2 are
• Full Backup: Select this radio button to perform your first backup
or when writing files to a new media source.
• Incremental Backup: Use this option if you have already performed at
least one backup and you want to update the backed up files.
4. Click Next and select the destination source.
Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer, appear
in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 6-11. Select a drive,
and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and identifies a pre-
vious backup file if one was created. The total size of the files to copy is
reported in the wizard. This information is helpful so you know whether
more than one CD or DVD are needed to complete the backup.
5. If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard
drive attached to your computer, click the Browse button and
identify the path.
If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
6. Click the Back button if you need to revisit the first two steps and
modify the options. When you’re satisfied, click Done and the backup
commences.
Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It may take some time, so just let
Elements work away until you are notified that the backup is complete.
Figure 6-11: Step 3 in the wizard provides options for selecting the 
destination media for the backup.

Selecting and
Correcting Photos

In this part . . .
T
he wide array of editing features in Elements
permit you to change, optimize, perfect, and
combine images into composite designs. In this
part, you ﬁnd out how to select image content
and later how to alter that content for a variety of
purposes such as correcting color, changing the
appearance, and extracting the content so you can
introduce it in other photos. Because photos com-
prise many thousands of tiny pixels, you need to
develop some skill in selecting just the pixels you
want to use for any given editing task. 
In addition to creating image selections, this part
also covers correcting photos for image contrast
and brightness, color correction, and color con-
versions from one color mode to another. Rarely
will you ever encounter digital images that won’t
require some kind of correction. In the chapters
ahead, you discover how to quickly master some
powerful correction techniques.

f all you want to do is use your photos in all their unedited glory, then feel
free to skip this chapter and move onto other topics. But if you want to
occasionally pluck an element out of its environment and stick it in another,
or apply an adjustment on just a portion of your image, then this chapter is
for you.
Learning how to make accurate selections is one of those skills
that is well worth the time invested. In this chapter, we cover
all the various selection tools and techniques. We give you
tips on which tools are better for which kinds of selec-
tions. But remember, you usually have several ways to
achieve the same result. Which road you choose is
ultimately up to you.
Defining Selections
Before you dig in and get serious about selecting, let us
clarify for the record what we mean by defining a selec-
tion. By defining a selection, you specify which part of an
image you want to work with. Everything within a selection is
considered selected. Everything outside the selection is unselected.
After you have a selection, you can then adjust just that portion, while the
unselected portion remains unchanged. Or you can take the selected area and
copy it into another image altogether. Want to transport yourself out of your
background and onto a white sandy beach instead? Select yourself out of that
backyard BBQ photo, get a stock photo of the tropical paradise of your choice,
and drag and drop yourself onto your tropics photo with the Move tool. It’s
that easy.

134
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
When you make a selection, a dotted outline — variously called a selection
border, an outline, or a marquee — appears around the selected area. Elements,
being the sophisticated imaging program that it is, also allows you to partially
select pixels, which allows for soft-edged selections. You create soft-edged
selections by feathering or anti-aliasing the selection or by using a mask.
Don’t worry, we cover these techniques later in this chapter.
For all of the selection techniques described in this chapter, be sure that your
image is in the Editor, in Standard Edit mode, and not in the Organizer.
Creating Rectangular and Elliptical Selections
If you can drag a mouse, you can master the Rectangular and Elliptical
Marquee tools. These two tools are the easiest selection tools to use, so if
your desired element is rectangular or elliptical, then by all means, grab
one of these tools.
The Rectangular Marquee tool, as its moniker states, is designed to select
rectangular or square selections. This is a great tool to use if you want to
home in on the pertinent portion of your photo and eliminate unnecessary
background.
Here’s how to make a selection with
this tool:
1. Select the Rectangular
Marquee tool from the
Tools palette.
It looks like a dotted square.
You can also press M to access
the tool.
2. Drag from one corner of the
area you want to select to the
opposite corner.
As you drag, the selection
border appears. The marquee
follows the movement of your
mouse cursor.
3. Release your mouse button.
You now have a completed rec-
tangular selection, as shown in
Figure 7-1.
Figure 7-1: Use the Rectangular Marquee tool
to create rectangular selections.

The Elliptical Marquee tool, which shares the same flyout menu as the
Rectangular Marquee tool, is designed for elliptical or circular selections. This
is the perfect tool for selecting balloons, clocks, and other rotund elements.
Here’s how to use the Elliptical Marquee:
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee tool from the Marquee flyout menu in
the Tools palette.
Again, you can also use the keyboard short-
cut. If the Rectangular Marquee is still visible,
you need to press Shift+M. If the Elliptical
Marquee tool is showing, press M. 
2. Position the crosshair near the area you
want to select and then drag around your
desired element.
With this tool, you don’t drag from corner to
corner. Instead, you drag from a given point
on the ellipse. As you drag, the selection
border appears.
3. When you’re satisfied with your selection,
release your mouse button.
Your elliptical selection is done, as shown in
Figure 7-2. If your selection isn’t quite cen-
tered around your element, simply move
the selection border by dragging inside the
border.
You can move a selection while you’re making it with either of the Marquee
tools by pressing the spacebar while you’re dragging.
Perfecting squares and circles with Shift and Alt
Sometimes you need to create a perfectly square or circular selection. To do
so, simply press the Shift key after you begin dragging. When you have your
desired selection, release the mouse button first and then release the Shift key.
When making an elliptical selection, making your selection from the center out-
ward is often easier. To draw from the center, first click the mouse button and
then, before you move the mouse, press Alt and drag. When you have your
desired selection, release your mouse button first and then release the Alt key.
If you want to both draw from the center out and create a perfect circle or
square, press the Shift key as well. After you have your desired selection,
release your mouse button and then release the Shift+Alt keys.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Applying marquee options
The Marquee tools offer additional options when you need to make precise
selections at specific measurements. You also find options for making your
selections soft around the edges.
The only thing to remember is that you must select the options in the
Options bar, shown in Figure 7-3, before you make your selection with the
Marquee tools. They cannot be applied after the selection has already been
made. The one exception is that you can feather a selection after the fact by
choosing Select➪Feather.
Figure 7-3: Apply marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here are the various marquee options available to you:
 Feather: Feathering creates soft edges around your selection. The amount
of softness depends on the value, from 0 to 250 pixels, you enter. The
higher the value, the softer the edges, as shown in Figure 7-4. Very small
amounts of feathering can be used to create subtle transitions between
selected elements in a collage. Larger amounts are often used when com-
bining multiple layers so that one image gradually fades into another. If
you just want a selected element to have a soft edge without the back-
ground, simply choose Select➪Inverse and delete the background. See
more on inversing selections in the “Modifying Your Selections” section,
later in this chapter. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
Don’t forget that those soft edges represent partially selected pixels.
 Anti-alias: Anti-aliasing barely softens the edge of an elliptical or irregu-
larly shaped selection so that the jagged edges aren’t quite so obvious.
An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide. We recommend leaving
this option checked for your selections. It can help to create natural
transitions between multiple selections when creating collages.
 Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
• Normal is the default setting, which allows you to freely drag a
selection of any size.
• Fixed Aspect Ratio lets you specify a fixed ratio of width to height.
For example, if you enter 3 for width and 1 for height, you get a selec-
tion that’s three times as wide as it is high, no matter what the size.

• Fixed Size lets you specify desired values for the Width and Height.
This setting can be useful when you need to make several selections
that must be the same size.
 Width and Height: When you select a Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed
Size from the Mode drop-down list, you must also enter your desired
values in the Width and Height text boxes. To swap the Width and
Height values, click the double-headed arrow button between the two
measurements.
The default unit of measurement in the Width and Height text boxes
is pixels (px). But that doesn’t mean you’re stuck with it. You can 
actually enter any unit of measurement that Elements recognizes —
pixels, inches, centimeters, millimeters, points, picas, or percents.
Type your value and then type the word or abbreviation of your unit of
measurement.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Making Freeform Selections with Lasso Tools
As we all know, you can’t select everything with a rectangle or ellipse. Life is
just way too freeform for that. Most animate, and many inanimate, objects
have undulations of varying sorts. Luckily, Elements anticipated the need to
capture these and provided the Lasso tools.
The Lasso tools enable you to make any freehand selection you can think of.
Elements generously provides three types of lasso tools: the Lasso tool, the
Polygonal Lasso tool, and the Magnetic Lasso tool. While all three tools are
designed to make freeform selections, they differ slightly in their methodol-
ogy, as we explain in the sections that follow. 
To use these tools, all that’s really required is a steady hand. You’ll find that the
more you use the Lasso tools, the better you become at your tracing tech-
nique. Don’t worry if your initial lasso selection isn’t super accurate. You can
always go back and make corrections by adding and deleting from your selec-
tion. To find out how, see “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this chapter.
If you find you really love the Lasso tools, you might want to consider investing
in a digital drawing tablet and stylus. This makes tracing, and also drawing and
painting, on the computer more comfortable. It better mimics pen and paper,
and many users swear they will never go back to a mouse after trying it out.
Selecting with the Lasso tool
Using the Lasso tool is the digital version of tracing an outline around an
object on a piece of paper. It’s that easy. And you have only two choices on
the Options bar — Feather and Anti-alias. To find out more about these
options, see “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter. 
Here’s how to make a selection with the Lasso tool:
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
It’s the sixth tool from the top and looks like a rope. You can also just
press the L key.
2. Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the object you want to
select.
The leading point of the cursor is the protruding end of the rope, as shown
in Figure 7-5. Don’t be afraid to zoom into your object if you need to see

the edge more distinctly. In my figure, I started at the top-left corner of
the butterfly’s wing.
3. Hold down the mouse button and trace around your desired object.
Try to include only what you want to select.
As you trace around your object, an outline follows your mouse cursor.
Try not to release your mouse button until you return to your starting
point. When you release your mouse button, Elements assumes you’re
done and closes the selection from wherever you released the mouse
button to your starting point, creating a diagonal line across your image.
4. Continue tracing around the object and return to your starting point;
release the mouse button to close the selection.
You see a selection border that matches your lasso line.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Getting straight with the Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool has a very specific mission in life: to select any 
element whose sides are straight. Think pyramids, stairways, skyscrapers,
barns. You get the idea. It also works a tad differently than the Lasso tool.
You don’t drag around the element with the Polygonal Lasso. Instead, you
click and release the mouse button at the corners of the element you’re
selecting. The Polygonal Lasso tool acts like a stretchy rubber band.
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you get the
Polygonal Lasso tool.
2. Click and release at any point to start the Polygonal Lasso selection line.
We usually start at a corner.
3. Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click at the next corner of the
object. Continue clicking and
moving to each corner of your
element.
Notice how the line stretches
out from each point you click.
4. Return to your starting point
and click to close the selection.
Be on the lookout for a small
circle that appears next to your
lasso cursor when you return
to your starting point. This is
an indication that you are
indeed closing the selection
at the right spot. 
Note that you can also double-
click at any point and Elements
will close the selection from
that point to the starting point.
Upon closing the polygonal
lasso line, a selection border
should appear, as in Figure 7-6.

Snapping with the Magnetic Lasso tool
The third member of the Lasso team is the Magnetic Lasso. We aren’t huge
fans of this Lasso tool, which sometimes can be hard to work with. But we
show you how it works so you can decide for yourself whether to use it. The
Magnetic Lasso tool works by defining the areas of the most contrast in an
image and then snapping to the edge between those areas, as if the edge had
a magnetic pull.
You’ll have the most success using the Magnetic Lasso tool on images that have
a well-defined foreground object and high contrast between that element and
the background — for example, a dark mountain range against a light sky.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings, which you can adjust
on the Options bar before you start selecting:
 Width: Determines how close to the edge (between 1 and 256 pixels)
you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to
that edge. Use a lower value if the edge has lots of detail or if the con-
trast in the image is low. Use a higher value for high-contrast images or
smoother edges.
 Edge Contrast: Specifies the amount of contrast (from 1 to 100) that is
required before the Magnetic Lasso snaps to an edge. Use a higher per-
centage if your image has good contrast between your desired element
and the background.
 Frequency: Specifies how many points (from 1% to 100%) to place on
the selection line. The higher the percentage, the greater number of
points. As a general rule, if the element you want to select has a smooth
edge, keep the percentage low. If the edge has a lot of detail, try a higher
percentage.
 Tablet Pressure (pen icon): If you are the proud owner of a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus
pressure cause the edge width to decrease.
Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you get the
Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a straight-sided lasso with a
little magnet on it.
2. Click the edge of the object you want to select to place the first fasten-
ing point.
141
Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

142
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Fastening points anchor down the selection line, as shown in Figure 7-7.
You can start anywhere; just be sure to click the edge between the ele-
ment you want and the background you don’t want.
3. Continue to move your cursor around the object, without clicking.
As the selection line gets pinned down with fastening points, only the
newest portion of the selection line remains active.
If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the desired edge of your
object, back up your mouse and click to force down a fastening point.
And, conversely, if the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a fastening point where
you don’t want one, press your Backspace key to delete it.
If the Magnetic Lasso isn’t cooperating, you can temporarily switch to the
other Lasso tools. To get the Lasso tool, press Alt and press the mouse
button and then drag. To get the Polygonal Lasso tool, press Alt and click.
4. Return to your starting point and click the mouse button to close the
selection.
You will see a small circle next to your cursor indicating that you’re at
the right spot to close the selection. You can also double-click, whereby
Elements closes the selection from where you double-clicked to your
starting point. The selection border appears when the selection is closed.

points to anchor the selection.

Working Wizardry with the Magic Wand
The Magic Wand tool is one of the oldest tools in the world of digital imaging.
This beloved tool has been around since both Photoshop and Elements were
in their infancies. It’s extremely easy to use, but a little harder to predict what
selection results it will present to you. 
Here’s how it works: You click inside the image, and the Magic Wand tool
makes a selection. This selection is based on the color of the pixel you clicked.
If there are other pixels that are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements
includes them in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, is
how to determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand tool
to select it. Fortunately, that’s where the tolerance setting comes in. In the
sections that follow, we first introduce you to this setting and then explain
how to put the Magic Wand to work. 
Talking about tolerance
The tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand
tool selects. It’s based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255. That
being said:
 Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors, or the whole image.
The default setting is 32. This means that when you click a pixel, Elements
analyzes the value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose bright-
ness levels are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker. 
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? Not a huge prob-
lem. You can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand to pick up additional
pixels you want to include in the selection. You can find out how in the sec-
tion, “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this chapter. Or you can try a
higher tolerance setting. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, you
can also lower your tolerance setting. 
So you can see by our talk on tolerance that the Magic Wand tool works
best when you have high-contrast images or images with a limited number
of colors. For example, the optimum image for the Wand would be a solid
black object on a white background. Skip the wand if the image has a ton of
colors and no real definitive contrast between your desired element and the
background.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Wielding the Wand 
to select
To use the Magic Wand tool and
adjust tolerance settings, follow
these steps:
1. Select the Magic Wand tool
from the Tools palette.
You can’t miss it. It looks like a
wand, or maybe a fuzzy lollipop.
You can also just press W.
2. Click anywhere on your
desired element, using the
default tolerance setting of 32.
Remember, the pixel that you
click determines the base color.
If the pixel gods are with you,
and you selected everything
you wanted on the first click,
you’re done. If your selection
needs further tweaking, like the
top image in Figure 7-8, continue
to the next step.
3. Specify a new Tolerance set-
ting in the Options bar.
If the Magic Wand selected more than you wanted, lower the tolerance
setting. If it didn’t select enough, increase the value. While you’re poking
around the Options bar, here’s a couple more options to get familiar with:
• Contiguous: Forces the Magic Wand to select only pixels that are
adjacent to each other. Without this option, the tool selects all pixels
within the range of tolerance, whether or not they’re adjacent to
each other.
• Sample All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this 
option, the Magic Want selects pixels from all visible layers.
Without this option, the tool selects pixels from the active layer
only. For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
4. Click again on your desired element.
Unfortunately, the Magic Wand tool isn’t magical enough to modify your
first selection automatically. Instead, it deselects the current selection
and makes a new selection based on your new Tolerance setting. If it still
isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. Try, try again.

Modifying Your Selections
It’s time for a seventh-inning stretch in this chapter on selection tools. In this
section, you find out how to refine that Marquee, Lasso, or Magic Wand selec-
tion to perfection. Although these tools do an okay job of capturing the bulk
of your selection, if you take the time to add or subtract from your selection
border a bit, you can ensure that you get only what you really want. 
You’re not limited to the manual methods described below, or even to key-
board shortcuts. You can also use the four selection option buttons on the
right side of the Options bar to create a new selection (the default), add to a
selection, subtract from a selection, or intersect one selection with another.
Just choose your desired selection tool, click the selection option button you
want, and drag (or click if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso
tool). The add and select button are also available when using the Selection
Brush. When adding to a selection, a small plus sign appears next to your
cursor. When subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign appears. When
intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign appears. 
Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all of the elements you wish to cap-
ture, you need to add those portions to your current selection border. To add
to a current selection, simply press the Shift key and drag around the area
you want to include. If you are using the Polygonal Lasso, click around the
area. And if you’re wielding the Magic Wand, just press the Shift key and click
the area you want.
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used to
create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you think
can get the job done. For example it is very common to start off with the Magic
Wand and fine-tune with the Lasso tool.
Subtracting from a selection
Got too much? To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt key and
drag around the pixels you want to subtract. With the Alt key, use the same
method for the Magic Wand and Polygonal Lasso as you do for adding to a
selection.
Intersecting two selections
Get your fingers in shape. To intersect your existing selection with a second
selection, press the Shift and Alt keys together and drag with the Lasso tool.
Or if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso, press and click instead
of dragging.

Avoiding key collisions
If you read the beginning of this chapter, you found out that by pressing the
Shift key, you get a perfectly square or circular selection. We just told you
that if you want to add to a selection, you press the Shift key. What if you
want to create a perfect square while adding to the selection? Or what if you
want to delete part of a selection while also drawing from the center out?
Both require the use of the Alt key. How in the heck does Elements know
what you want? Here are a few tips to avoid keyboard collisions. Grab your
desired Marquee tool.
 To add a square or circular selection, press Shift and drag. As you
drag, keep your mouse button pressed, release the Shift key for just a
second, and then press it down again. Your added selection area will
suddenly snap into a square or circle. You must then release the mouse
button first, then release Shift key last. 
 To delete from an existing selection while drawing from the center
outward, press Alt and drag. As you drag, keep your mouse button
pressed, release the Alt key for just a second, and then press it down
again. You will now be drawing from the center outward. Again, release
the mouse button first, then release the Alt key last.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If you like the more organic feel of painting on a canvas, you’ll appreciate the
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to
select. This great tool also lets you make a basic, rudimentary selection with
another tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing
additional pixels into or out of the selection.
Here is the step-by-step process of selecting with the Selection Brush:
1. Select the Selection Brush from the Tools palette, or simply press the
A key.
This tool works in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
2. Specify your Selection Brush options in the Options bar. Here’s the run
down on each:
• Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down palette.
To load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to
the left of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your
choice. You can select the Load Brushes command from the palette
pop-up menu.

• Brush Size: Specify your desired brush size, from 1 to 2500 pixels.
Enter the value or drag the slider.
• Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to add
to your selection, and choose Mask to subtract from your selection.
If you choose Mask mode, you must choose some additional Overlay
options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows onscreen only)
that hovers over your image, indicating protected or unselected
areas. You must also choose an Overlay Opacity between 1 and
100% (described in a Tip, later in this section). You can also choose
to change the Overlay Color from the default red to another color.
This can be helpful if your image contains a lot of red. 
• Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100%.
3. If your mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you wish to select.
You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you inad-
vertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt key and
paint over the undesired area. After you finish painting what you want,
your selection is ready to go.
4. If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas you do not want to
select.
This mode does the opposite of the Selection mode. When you’re done
painting your Mask, choose Selection from the Mode drop-down menu,
or simply choose another tool from the Tools palette, in order to convert
your mask into a selection border.
As you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds more
to the overlay area, as shown in Figure 7-9. When working in Mask mode,
you are essentially covering up, or masking, the areas you wish to pro-
tect from manipulation. That manipulation can be selecting, adjusting
color, or any other Elements command. Again, if you want to remove
parts of the masked area, press Alt and paint.
Don’t forget: If you painted your selection in Mask mode, your selection
border is around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want,
choose Select➪Inverse.
Which mode should you choose? Well, it’s up to you. But one advantage
to working in Mask mode is that you can partially select areas. By paint-
ing with soft brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges
result in partially selected pixels. If you set your Overlay Opacity to a
lower percentage, your pixels will be even less opaque, or “less selected.”
If this partially selected business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because
this is also what happens when you feather selections, as we discuss
earlier in this chapter.

Painting with the Magic Selection Brush
The word “Magic” in front of any noun usually makes us think we are in for an
especially beneficial payoff. So when you see the Magic Selection Brush, you’re
probably thinking, “Whoa, Nelly, it’s new, it’s magic . . . this has gotta be good.”
Theoretically speaking, this new tool makes a selection when you simply
draw, scribble, add a brush dot, or otherwise casually mar the area you wish
to select. And what’s more, theoretically speaking, you don’t even have to
precisely trace the object. Elements selects the object you want based on
your brush stroke!
Okay, we’ll cut the sarcasm and get to the point. While this tool has some
potential, it really works the best when you provide it with as much data as
possible. This means that rather than just adding a dot or scribble on your
desired element, if you take a few seconds longer to paint at least a rudimen-
tary outline around the element, you’ll end up with a more accurate selection.
By making a decent outline, you provide data for the tool’s algorithm to figure
out what it is you want to select. Similarly, if you further refine that initial selec-
tion by deleting and adding areas, you provide even more data, and the tool

rewards you with an even more accurate selection. Unlike the Magic Wand,
which allows you to add and delete incrementally to an existing selection, the
Magic Selection Brush redraws your selection from scratch each time you
modify it. It also differs from the Magic Wand in that it doesn’t only analyze
color to make the selection, but relies even more on texture.
By the way, this tool works in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode.
Now that you understand the mechanical reasoning behind the Magic Selection
Brush, here’s how to select with this new tool:
1. Select the Magic Selection Brush tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the F key.
2. Specify the options in the Options bar. Here is a description of the
options:
• New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new
selection.
• Indicate Foreground (+ icon): Allows you to add to an existing
selection.
• Indicate Background (– icon): Enables you to subtract from an
existing selection.
• Overlay Color: As with the Selection brush, you can change the color
of your overlay from the default red to the color of your choice.
• Brush Size: Choose a brush size, from 1 to 100 pixels, from the Size
menu. If you want to try to make a more precise outline, we suggest
using a smaller brush.
3. Select an area by clicking your mouse on it, dragging a brush stroke
around it, or painting over it. When you’re done, release your mouse
button.
Upon releasing the mouse, your selection border should appear. If the
Magic Selection Brush gave you what you wanted, you’re done. If your
selection needs refinement, go to Step 4. (Most likely, we’ll be seeing
you at Step 4.)
4. To add to your existing selection, activate the Indicate Foreground
option in the Options bar. Click, drag, or paint over the areas you
want to add. To delete from your existing selection, activate the
Indicate Background option in the Options bar. Click, drag, or paint
over the areas you want to remove from your existing selection.
Note that if your object is fairly detailed, like my Lacy Seahorse, you may
even need to break out the Lasso or another selection tool to make some
final clean-ups. Eventually, you should arrive at a selection you’re happy
with, as shown in Figure 7-10.

Using the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. You can think
of it as a Custom Shape tool for images. But while the Custom Shape tool cre-
ates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the Cookie Cutter
actually crops away everything outside the shape. The preset libraries offer
you a large variety of interesting shapes, from talk bubbles to Swiss cheese.
(I’m not being funny here, check out the food library.)
Here’s the lowdown on using the Cookie Cutter:
1. Choose the Cookie Cutter tool from the Tools palette.
There’s no missing it; it looks like a heart. You can also press the Q key.
2. Specify your options in the Options bar. Here’s the list:
• Shape: Choose your desired shape from the preset library. To load
other libraries, click the palette pop-up menu and choose one from
the submenu.
• Shape Options: These options let you draw your shape with certain
parameters, as follows. Unconstrained, the default, enables you to
draw freely. Defined Proportions enables you to keep the height
and width proportional. Defined Size crops the image to the origi-
nal, fixed size of the shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or

smaller. Fixed Size allows you to enter your desired width and
height. And From Center allows you to draw the shape from the
center out.
• Feather: This creates a soft-edged selection. See “Applying mar-
quee options,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.
• Crop: Click this option to crop the image into the shape. Figure 7-11
shows an image cropped to the shape of an elephant.
3. Drag your mouse on the image to create your desired shape. Size
your shape by dragging one of the handles of the bounding box.
Position your shape by placing your mouse cursor inside the box
and dragging.
You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Chapter 9.
4. Click the Commit button in the Options bar or press Enter to finish the
cropping.
If you want to bail out of the bounding box and not crop, you can always
press the Cancel button in the Options bar or press Esc.

Eliminating with the Eraser Tools
The eraser tools let you erase areas of your image. There are three eraser
tools — the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser.
The eraser tools look like those pink erasers you used in grade school, so
you can’t miss them. If you can’t locate them, you can always press E and
then Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
When you erase pixels, those pixels are history, meaning they’re gone. So
before using the eraser tools, you should probably have a backup of your
image stored somewhere. Think of it as a cheap insurance policy in case
things go awry.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool enables you to erase
areas on your image to either your
background color or, if you’re working
on a layer, to a transparent back-
ground, as shown in Figure 7-12. For
more on layers, check out Chapter 8.
To use this tool, simply select it, drag
through the desired area on your
image, and you’re done. Because it
isn’t the most accurate tool on the
planet, remember to really zoom in
and use smaller brush tips to do
some accurate erasing.
There are several Eraser options to specify on the Options bar:
 Brush Presets: Click the drop-down palette to access the Brush presets.
Choose the brush of your choice. Again, additional brush libraries are
available from the Brushes pop-up menu.
 Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Block,
you’re stuck with one size (a 16-x-16-pixel tip) and are not able to select
other preset brushes.
 Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for your erased areas.
The lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. Opacity isn’t available
for the Block mode. 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-12: Erase either to your background
color (left) or to transparency (right).

The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool is more savvy than the Eraser tool. It erases the
background from an image while being mindful of leaving the foreground
untouched. The Background Eraser tool erases to transparency on a layer.
If you drag an image with only a background, Elements converts the back-
ground into a layer.
The key to using the Background
Eraser is to carefully keep the hot
spot, the crosshair at the center of the
brush, on the background pixels as
you drag. The hot spot samples the
color of the pixels and deletes that
color whenever it falls inside the
brush circumference. But, if you 
accidentally touch a foreground
pixel with the hot spot, it’s erased
as well. And the tool won’t even be
sorry about it! This tool works better
with images that have good contrast
in color between the background
and foreground object, as shown in
Figure 7-13. Also, if your image has
very detailed or wispy edges (such as
hair or fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor command, described
in the next section. 
Here’s the rundown on the Background Eraser options:
 Brush Preset picker: Provides settings to customize the size and appear-
ance of your brush tip. The size and tolerance settings at the bottom are
for pressure-sensitive drawing tablets. 
 Limits: Discontiguous erases all similarly colored pixels wherever they
appear in the image. Contiguous erases all similarly colored pixels that
are adjacent to those under the hot spot.
 Tolerance: Like the Magic Wand and the Magic Eraser, the Background
Eraser uses a tolerance setting. The value determines how similar the
colors have to be to that of the color under the hot spot before Elements
erases them. A higher value picks up more colors, whereas a lower value
picks up fewer colors. See “Talking about tolerance,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for more details.

Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

spot of your brush cursor.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
The Magic Eraser tool
You can think of the Magic Eraser tool as a combo Eraser and Magic Wand tool.
It both selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. Unless
you are working on a layer with the transparency locked (see Chapter 9 for
more on locking), the pixels are erased to transparency. If you are working
on an image with just a background, Elements converts the background into
a layer.
The Magic Eraser shares most of the same options with the other erasers.
Here are the unique options:
 Anti-alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 Sample All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers, but
erases pixels on the active layer only.
Using the Magic Extractor Command
The last selection tool in the Elements repertoire is the new Magic Extractor
command. This command enables you to make selections based on your
identification of the foreground and background portions of your image.
This command is similar in methodology to the Magic Selection Brush tool.
You specify your foreground and background by simply clicking these areas
with the brush tool and “marking” them. Click the magic OK button, and your
object or objects are neatly and painlessly extracted.
Though it isn’t mandatory, you can make a rough selection first before select-
ing the Magic Extractor command. This obviously restricts what is extracted
and could result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
1. Choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
The huge Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
2. Grab the Foreground Brush tool and click or drag to mark your fore-
ground areas — or the areas you want to select.
The default color of the Foreground Brush is red.
Again, like the Selection brush, the more accurate the data you provide
to the command’s algorithm, the more accurate your extraction will be.
Be sure and use the Zoom and Hand tools to help magnify and move
around your image as needed. For more on these tools, see Chapter 5. 

You can also change the size of your Brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels)
under the Tool Options on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary,
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
3. Select the Background Brush tool and click or drag to mark the back-
ground area or the portions you don’t want to select.
The default color of the Background Brush is blue, as shown in Figure 7-14.
4. Click Preview to view your extraction.
Elements churns for a few seconds before presenting you with a look at
your extraction. You can change the Preview by choosing either Selection
Area or Original Photo from the Display pop-up menu.
If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose
one, such as black matte for a black background, from the Background
pop-up menu.

Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
5. If you aren’t happy with the preview of your selection, you can refine
the selection by doing the following:
• To erase any markings, select the Point Eraser tool and click or
drag over the offending areas.
• To add areas to the selection, click or drag over your desired areas
with the Add to Selection tool.
• To delete areas from the selection, drag with the Remove from
Selection Tool.
• Drag over the edges with the Smoothing Brush tool to smooth the
edges of your foreground selection.
• To soften the edges of your selection, enter a value in the Feather
option. Remember, the higher the
value, the softer the edge.
• Click the Fill Holes button to do
just that.
• Click Defringe to remove that halo of
pixels between the foreground and
background areas. Enter a value in the
Defringe Width option.
If things start to get messy, you can always
start over by clicking Reset at the bottom of
the dialog box.
6. When you’re pleased with the results, click
OK to finish the selection process, as
shown in Figure 7-15, and close the Magic
Extractor dialog box.
Your newly extracted image appears as a
new file.
Using the Select Menu
In this section, we breeze through the Select menu. Along with the methods
we describe in the “Modifying Your Selections” section, you can use this
menu to further modify selections by expanding, contracting, smoothing,
softening, inversing, growing, and grabbing similarly colored pixels. And if
that won’t satisfy your selection needs, nothing will.
Figure 7-15: A rose selected
with the Magic Extractor.

Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect commands are no-brainers. To select everything
in your image, choose Select➪All or press Ctrl+A. To deselect everything,
choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D. Remember, you usually don’t have
to Select All. If you don’t have a selection border in your image, Elements
assumes the whole image is fair game for any manipulation.
Reselecting a selection
If you have sacrificed that second cup of coffee to steady your hand and
taken the time to carefully lasso around your desired object, you don’t want
to lose your selection before you’ve had a chance to perform your next move.
But all it takes is a mere inadvertent click of your mouse while you have an
active selection border to completely obliterate your selection. Fortunately,
Elements anticipated such a circumstance and offers a solution. If you choose
Select➪Reselect, Elements retrieves your last selection.
One caveat: The Reselect command works only for the last selection you
made, so don’t plan to reselect a selection you made last Tuesday, or even
just 5 minutes ago if you selected something else after that selection. If you
want to reuse a selection for the long term, you need to save it, as we explain
in “Saving and loading selections,” later in this chapter.
Inversing a selection
You know the old adage: If you can’t be with the one you love, love the one
you’re with. Well, Elements is kind of like that. Sometimes it’s just easier to
select what you don’t want rather than what you do want. For example, if
you’re trying to select your beloved in his or her senior photo, it’s probably
easier to just click the studio backdrop with the Magic Wand and then inverse
the selection by choosing Select➪Inverse.
Feathering a selection
In the “Applying marquee options” section, we describe how to feather a
selection when using the Lasso and Marquee tools by entering a value in the
Feather box on the Options bar. Remember that this method of feathering
requires that you set your Feather value before you create your selection.
What we didn’t tell you is that there is a way to apply a feather after you’ve
made a selection. 
157
Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections

158
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Choose Select➪Feather and enter your desired amount from .2 to 250 pixels.
Your selection will be subsequently softened around the edges.
This method is actually a better way to go. Make your selection and fine-tune
it by using the methods described earlier in this chapter. Then apply your
feather. The problem with applying the feather before you make a selection is
when you want to modify your initial selection. When you make a selection
with a feather, the marquee outline of the selection adjusts to take into account
the amount of the feather. That means that the resulting marquee outline
doesn’t resemble your precise mouse movement, making it harder to modify
that selection.
Using the Modify commands
Although they definitely won’t win any popularity contests, the commands
under the Modify submenu may occasionally come in handy. Here is the
scoop on each command:
 Border: Selects the area, from 1
to 200 pixels, around the edge of
the selection border. By choos-
ing Edit➪Fill Selection, you can
fill the border with color, as
shown in Figure 7-16. 
 Smooth: Select this command
to try to round off any jagged,
raggedy edges. Enter a value
from 1 to 100 pixels, and
Elements looks at each selected
pixel and then includes or 
deselects the pixels in your
selection based on your value.
Start with a low number, like
1–3 pixels. Otherwise, it may make your selection worse.
 Expand: Enables you to increase the size of your selection by a given
number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This command is especially useful if you
just barely missed getting the edge of an elliptical selection and need it a
little larger.
 Contract: Decreases your selection border by 1 to 100 pixels. When com-
positing multiple images, it’s often beneficial to slightly contract your
selection if you plan on applying a feather. That way, you avoid picking
up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-16: Fill a border with color to create a
stroke around your object.

Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often used in tandem with the Magic
Wand tool. If you’ve made an initial selection with the Magic Wand but didn’t
quite get everything you wanted, try choosing Select➪Grow. The Grow com-
mand increases the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall
within the range of tolerance value. The Similar command is like Grow, except
that the pixels don’t have to be adjacent to be selected. The command searches
throughout the image and picks up pixels within the tolerance range.
These commands don’t have their own tolerance options. They use whatever
tolerance value is displayed on the Options bar when the Magic Wand tool is
selected. You can adjust that tolerance setting to include more or fewer colors.
Saving and loading selections
Finally, there may be times when you toiled so long over a complex selection
that you really want to save it for future use. This is not only possible, but
highly recommended. And it’s also a piece a cake. Here’s how:
1. After you’ve perfected your selection, choose Select➪Save Selection.
2. In the Save Selection dialog
box, leave the Selection option
at New and enter a desired
name for your selection, as
shown in Figure 7-17.
The Operation is automatically
set to New Selection.
3. Click OK.
4. When you want to access the
selection again, choose Select➪
Load Selection and choose
your desired selection from
the Selection pop-up menu.
To inverse your selection, click the Invert box. You’ll notice that you
now have available options to add to, subtract from, or intersect with
your selection. These can come in handy if you want to modify your
existing selection. For example, say you selected the center and petals
of a flower but not the stem and leaves. You later decide you really need
the whole flower. Rather than making a whole new selection, you can
select just the stem and leaves and then choose Add to Selection, and
you’ve got your whole flower. If you want, you can then save the flower
as a new selection for later use.

U
sing Elements without ever using layers would be like typing a book
on an old IBM Selectric typewriter. Sure, you could do it, but it wouldn’t
be fun. But an ever bigger issue would be when it came time to edit that book
and make changes. Correction tape, white out, and erasers would make that
task downright tedious, not to mention messy. The benefit of using
layers is that you have tremendous flexibility. You can quickly
make as many edits as you want for as long as you want,
provided you keep your composite image in layers.
Layers make working in Elements a lot more produc-
tive. Don’t give a darn about productivity? Well,
let’s just say layers also make it a breeze for you to
dabble in your more artsy side. This chapter gives
you everything you need to know about layers.
After you try them out, you’ll wonder how you ever
lived without them.
Getting to Know Layers
Think of layers as sheets of acetate or clear transparency film.
You have drawings or photographs on individual sheets. What you
place on each sheet doesn’t affect any of the other sheets. Any area on the
sheet that doesn’t have an image on it is transparent. You can stack these

162
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
sheets one on top of the other to create a combined image, or composite
(or collage if you prefer). You can reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new
sheets, and delete old sheets.
In Elements, layers are essentially a digital version of these clear acetate
sheets. You can place elements such as images, type, or shapes on separate
layers and create a composite, as shown in Figure 8-1. You can hide, add,
delete, or rearrange layers. Being digital, layers of course have some added
functionality. You can adjust how opaque or transparent the element on the
layer is. You can also add special effects and change how the colors interact
between layers.
When you create a new file with background contents of white or a back-
ground color, scan an image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your
digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background. There are
no layers yet.
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it besides
paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t move the background or
change its transparency or blend mode. How do you get around all of these
limitations? Convert your background into a layer by following these easy
steps: 
Corbis, PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 8-1: Layers enable you to easily create composite images.

1. Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers palette.
The Layers palette is explained in detail in the next section.
2. Double-click Background in the Layers palette.
Or you can choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background.
3. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
You can also adjust the Blend Mode and Opacity of the layer in this
dialog box if you need to. You can also do it via the Layer palette com-
mands later.
4. Click OK.
Elements converts your background into a layer, known also as an image
layer.
When you create a new image with transparent background contents,
the image doesn’t contain a background but instead is created with a
single layer. 
Anatomy of a Layers palette
Elements keeps layers controlled in their own palette called, not surprisingly,
a Layers palette. To display the Layers palette, shown in Figure 8-2, choose
Window➪Layers in the Editor in Standard Edit mode.
The order of the layers in the Layers palette represents the order in the image.
We refer to this in the computer graphics world as the stacking order. The top
layer in the palette is the top layer in your image, and so on. Depending on
what you are doing, you can either work on a single layer or on multiple
layers at once. Here are some tips on working with the Layers palette:
 Select a layer: Click its name or thumbnail. Elements highlights the
active layer in the palette.
 Select multiple contiguous layers: Click your first layer and then
Shift+click your last layer.
 Select multiple noncontiguous layers: Ctrl+click your desired layers.
 View and hide layers: To hide the layer, click the eye icon for that layer
so that the eye disappears. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space
in the eye column. You can also hide all the layers but one by selecting
your desired layer and Alt+clicking the eye icon for that layer. Redisplay
all the layers by Alt+clicking the eye icon again. Hiding all the layers
except the one you want to edit can be helpful in allowing you to focus
without the distraction of all the other imagery.
Only layers that are visible will print. This can be useful if you want to
have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a pro-
ject within the same file.

nontransparent pixels) on the
layer: Ctrl+click the layer’s
thumbnail (not the name) in the
palette. 
 Create a new blank layer: Click
the Create a New Layer icon at
the top of the palette.
 Create an adjustment layer:
Click the Create Adjustment
Layer icon at the top of the
palette. Adjustment layers are
special layers that correct con-
trast and color in your image.
You can also add fill layers —
layers containing color, gradi-
ents, or patterns — via this
command. We give you more
details on adjustment and fill
layers in upcoming sections.
 Duplicate an existing layer:
Drag the layer to the Create a
New Layer icon at the top of the
palette.
 Rearrange layers: To move a
layer to another position in the
stacking order, drag the layer up
or down in the Layers palette.
As you drag, you see a fist icon.
Release your mouse button
when a highlighted line appears
where you want to insert the
layer.
If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost
layer. If you need to move the background, convert it to a layer by
double-clicking the name in the Layers palette. Enter a name for the
layer and click OK.
 Rename a layer: When you create a new layer, Elements provides
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename
a layer, double-click the layer name in the Layers palette and enter the
name directly in the Layers palette. 
 Determine what layer holds the element you want to edit: Right-click
the element. A context menu informs you what layer the element resides
on and enables you to select that layer.

 Adjust the interaction between
colors on layers and adjust the
transparency of layers: You can
use the blend modes and the
opacity options at the top of
the palette to mix the colors
between layers and adjust the
transparency of the layers, as
shown in Figure 8-3.
 Link layers: Sometimes you
want your layers to stay grouped
as a unit to make your editing
tasks easier. If so, link your
layers by selecting the layers in
the palette and then clicking the
Link Layers icon at the top of the palette. A link icon appears to the right
of the layer name. To remove the link, click the Link Layers icon again.
 Lock layers: Select your desired layer and then click one of the two lock
icons at the top of the palette. The checkerboard square icon locks all
transparent areas of your layers. This prevents you from painting or
editing any transparent areas on the layers. The lock icon locks your
entire layer and prevents it from being changed in any way, including
moving or transforming the elements on the layer. You can, however,
still make selections on the layer. To unlock the layer, simply click the
icon again to toggle off the lock.
By default, the background is locked and cannot be unlocked until you
convert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer
from Background. 
 Delete a layer: Drag it to the trash can icon.
Using the Layer and Select Menus
As with many features in Elements, there is usually more than one way to
do something. This is especially true when it comes to working with layers.
Besides the commands in the Layers palette, you also have two layer menus —
the Layers menu and the Select menu, both of which you can find in the main
menu bar at the top of the application window.
The Layers menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers palette icons, you can also do by
using the Layers menu in the Menu bar and the Layers pop-up menu con-
nected to the Layers palette (click the More button in the top-right corner).
Commands such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename are omnipresent
throughout. But you will find commands that are exclusive to the palette, the
main Layers menu, and the Layers pop-up menu. So if you can’t find what you’re
looking for in one area, just go to another. Some of the commands require an
165

expanded explanation and are described in sections that follow. But here’s a
quick description of most of the commands: 
 Delete Linked and Delete Hidden: These commands delete only those
layers that have been linked or hidden from display in the Layers palette.
 Layer Style: These commands manage the styles, or special effects, you
apply to your layers. Find more on layer styles in an upcoming section.
 Change Layer Content: Depending on the type of layer you have selected,
this command enables you to change or adjust the contents of your layer.
For example, you can change the contents of a shape layer from a solid
color into a pattern.
 Arrange: Enables you to shuffle your layer stacking order with commands
like Bring to Front and Send to Back. Reverse, a new command, switches
the order of your layers if you have two or more layers selected.
 Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates what
is called a clipping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the
boundaries of a base layer. Find more details in an upcoming section.
 Type: The commands under the Type menu control the display of type
layers. For more on type, see Chapter 13.
 Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill layer
into a regular image layer. Briefly, a shape layer is a layer that contains
a vector object, whereas a fill layer is a layer containing a solid color, a
gradient, or a pattern.
 Merge and Flatten: The various merge and flatten commands combine
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, all of your
layers into a single background.
 Palette Options: You can choose display options and choose to use a
layer mask on your adjustment layers. Leave this option checked and
read more about it in the upcoming section.
The Select menu
While the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and refining
your selections, it does offer a few handy layer commands, all of which are
new additions to the menu. Here’s a quick introduction to each command:
 Select all layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose
Select➪All Layers.
 Select layers of similar type: This command is helpful if you have differ-
ent types of layers in your document, such as regular layers, type layers,
shape layers, and adjustment layers, and you want to select just one type.
Select one of your desired layers and then choose Select➪Similar Layers.
For details on different types of layers, see the upcoming section.
 Deselect all layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.

Working with Different Layer Types
There is layer life beyond just converting an existing background into a layer,
which we describe earlier. In fact, Elements offers five kinds of layers. You’ll
probably spend most of your time creating image layers, but just so you’re
familiar with all types, the following sections describe each one.
Image layers
The image layer, usually just referred to as a layer, is the type of layer we were
referring to when we gave the analogy of acetate sheets earlier in this chap-
ter. You can create blank layers and add images to them, or you can create
layers from images themselves. You can have as many image layers as your
computer’s memory will allow. Just keep in mind that the more layers you
have, the larger your file size and the slower your computer will behave.
Each layer in an image can be edited without affecting the other layers. You can
move, paint, size, apply a filter, and so on without disturbing a single pixel on
any other layer, or the background for that matter. And when an element is
on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection to select it (see Chapter 7
for selection info). Just drag the element with the Move tool.
We work more with image layers later in
this chapter.
Adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind of
layer used for correcting color and con-
trast. The advantage of using adjustment
layers for your corrections, rather than
applying them directly on the image layer,
is that you can apply the corrections with-
out permanently affecting the pixels. They
are totally non-destructive. And because
the correction is on a layer, you can edit,
or even delete, the adjustment at any time.
Adjustment layers, shown in Figure 8-4,
apply the correction only to all the layers
below them, without affecting any of the
layers above them.
Another unique element to adjustment
layers is that when you create one, you
also create a layer mask on that layer at the
same time. A layer mask is like a second
sheet of acetate that hovers over the
underlying layers. The layer mask allows
167

color and contrast in your image.

168
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
you to selectively apply the adjustment
to the layers below it by applying shades
of gray — from white to black — on the
mask. For example, by default, the mask is
completely white. This allows the adjust-
ment to be fully applied to the layers. If you
paint on a layer mask with black, the areas
under those black areas will not show the
adjustment. If you paint with a shade of
gray, those areas will partially show the
adjustment. The darker the shade of gray,
the less it will show the adjustment, as
shown in Figure 8-5. Note that if you have
an active selection border in your image
before you add an adjustment layer, the
adjustment is applied only to that area
within the selection border. Your resulting
layer mask also reflects that selection:
The selected areas are white, while the
unselected areas are black.
You can also use just the layer mask to
creatively blend two layers together.
Create an adjustment layer and just don’t
make any adjustment settings. Then use
the layer mask to blend two layers. Be sure
to sandwich the layer mask between your
two layers. Then, select the topmost layer
and choose Layer➪Group with Previous.
Paint on your layer mask, as described
earlier in this chapter, to selectively hide and show portions of your topmost
layer.
Elements has eight kinds of adjustment layers, and you can use as many as
you want. These adjustments are the same adjustments you find on the
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting and Adjust Color and Filter➪Adjustments sub-
menus. For specifics on each adjustment, see Chapters 9 and 10. Here’s how
to create an adjustment layer:
1. Open an image that needs a little contrast or color correction.
Note that you don’t need to convert your background into a layer to
apply an adjustment layer.
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon in the Layers palette.
3. From the drop-down list at the top of the Layers palette, choose your
desired adjustment.
The dialog box specific to your adjustment appears.
Adjustment layer

Figure 8-5: Layer masks control the
amount of adjustment applied to your
layers.

4. Make your necessary corrections and click OK.
After you close the dialog box, the adjustment layer appears in the
Layers palette. The adjustment layer icon and a thumbnail appear
on the adjustment layer. The thumbnail represents the layer mask
described above.
You can paint on the layer mask to selectively allow only portions of
your image to receive the adjustment. Use the Brush or Pencil tool to
paint. Or you can also make a selection and fill that selection with any
shade of gray, from white to black. And finally, you can use the Gradient
tool on the mask to create a gradual application of the adjustment.
Like image layers, you can adjust the opacity and blend modes of an
adjustment layer. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer reduces
the effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
Here are a few last tips on using adjustment layers:
 If you want to view your image without the adjustment, click the eye
icon in the left column of the Layers palette to hide the adjustment layer. 
 To delete the adjustment layer, drag it to the trash can icon in the
Layers palette.
 To edit an adjustment layer, simply double-click the adjustment layer in
the Layers palette. You can also choose Layer➪Layer Content Options.
In the dialog box that appears, make any edits and then click OK. The
only adjustment layer that you cannot edit is the Invert adjustment. It is
either on or off.
 To switch to a different adjustment layer, choose Layer➪Change Layer
Content and select a different adjustment layer from the submenu. 
Fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern.
Like adjustment layers, fill layers also include layer masks. You can edit,
rearrange, duplicate, delete, and merge fill layers similarly to adjustment
layers. You can blend fill layers with other layers by using the opacity and
blend mode options in the Layers palette. Finally, you can restrict the fill
layer to just a portion of your image by either making a selection first or by
painting on the mask later.
Follow the steps below to create a fill layer:
1. Open an image.
Use an image that will look good with a frame or border of some kind.
Remember that if you don’t have a selection, the fill layer covers your
whole image.
169
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
2. Click the Create adjustment layer icon in the Layers palette. From the
drop-down list, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern. 
The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
3. Specify your options, depending on the fill type you chose in Step 2:
• Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the Color Picker. See
Chapter 12 for details on choosing colors and also on gradients
and patterns.
• Gradient: Click the down-pointing arrow to choose a preset gradient
from the drop-down palette or click the gradient preview to display
the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient.
• Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down palette. Enter a value
to scale your pattern if desired. Click Snap to Origin to make the
origin of the pattern the same as the origin of the document. Select
the Link with Layer option to specify that the pattern moves with
the fill layer if you move it. 
4. Click OK.
The fill layer appears in the Layers palette, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Notice the layer mask that was created on the fill layer.

Shape layers
If you haven’t made your way to Chapter 12 yet, you may be surprised to dis-
cover that Elements also lets you draw shapes with six different drawing tools.
These shapes also have the added bonus of being vector-based. This means
the shapes are defined by mathematical equations, which create points and
paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage of vector-based objects is that
you can freely size these objects without degradation. In addition, they will
always print with smooth edges, not with the jaggies you’re familiar with
seeing in pixel-based elements.
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools palette and drag on
your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own unique shape
layer, as shown in Figure 8-7. As with other types of layers, you can adjust the
blend modes and opacity of a shape layer. You can edit, move, and transform
the actual shapes. However, to apply filters, you must first simplify the shape
layer. This converts the vector paths to pixels.

Type layers
To add words to your images, as shown in Figure 8-7, click your canvas with
the Type tool and just type. It’s really as easy as that. Well, you can specify
options, such as a font family and size, in the Options bar, but when you click
the Commit button on the Options bar, you create a type layer. In the Layers
palette, you’ll see a layer with a T icon. For details on working with type,
check out Chapter 13.
Tackling Layer Basics
Image layers are the heart and soul of the layering world. You can create multi-
ple image layers within a single image. Even more fun is taking several different
images and creating a composite. Add people you like; take out people you
don’t. Pluck people out of boring photo studios and put them in exotic locales.
The creative possibilities are endless. So in this section, we cover all the vari-
ous ways to create image layers. We’ve already covered how to convert a
background into a layer earlier in the chapter (see “Getting to Know Layers”).
These next few sections describe how to create an image layer by using vari-
ous other methods.
Creating a new layer from scratch
If you are creating a new blank file, you can select the Transparent option for
your Background contents. Your new file is created with a transparent layer
and is ready to go. If you have an existing file and want to create a new blank
layer, here are the ways to do so:
 Click the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the Layers palette.
 Choose New Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
 Choose Layer➪New➪Layer. Note that if you create a layer by using
either of the menu commands, you are presented with a dialog box with
options. Here you can name your layer and specify options for grouping,
blending, and adjusting opacity. Provide a name for your layer and click
OK. You can always adjust the other options directly in the Layers palette
at a later time.
You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without even creating a
blank layer first. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank
layer, Elements automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection.
A better method of copying and pasting between multiple images, however,
is to use the drag-and-drop method described later in this section.

The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all
the visible layers within the selection.
After you create your layer, you can put selections or other elements on that
layer by doing one or more of the following:
 Grab a painting tool, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint on the layer.
 Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the same
document or from another image entirely and then choose Edit➪Copy.
Select your new blank layer in the Layers palette and then choose
Edit➪Paste. You can also
choose Select➪All and then
copy and paste to transfer an
entire image to the new layer.
 Make a selection on another
layer or on the background
within the same document or
from another image and then
choose Edit➪Cut. Select your
new blank layer and then
choose Edit➪Paste. Be aware
that this action removes that
selection from its original loca-
tion and leaves a transparent
hole, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy and Layer via
Cut commands under the Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or back-
ground and choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut. Elements
automatically creates a new layer and puts the copied or cut selection on
the layer. Again, remember that if you use the Layer via Cut command, your
selection is deleted from its original location layer, and you are left with a
transparent hole. If you use the background for the source, your background
color fills the space. One final reminder: You can use these two commands
only within the same image. You cannot use them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
Duplicating layers can be helpful if you want to protect your original image
while experimenting with a technique. If you don’t like the results, you can
always delete the duplicated layer. No harm, no foul.

layer, take note of the resulting hole left in the
original location.

174
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
To duplicate an existing layer, select it in the Layers palette and do one of
three things:
 Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the palette.
Elements creates a duplicate layer with Copy appended to the name of
the layer.
 Choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers palette pop-up menu.
 Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer. If you use the menu methods, a dialog
box appears, asking you to name your layer and specify other options.
Provide a name for your layer and click OK. You can specify the other
options later if desired. 
Dragging and dropping layers
The most efficient way to copy and paste layers between multiple images is
to use the drag-and-drop method. Why? Because it bypasses your clipboard,
which is the temporary storage area on your computer for copied data. Storing
data, especially large files, can bog down your system. By keeping your clip-
board clear of data, your system operates more efficiently. If you’ve already
copied data and it is lounging on your clipboard, choose Edit➪Purge➪
Clipboard to empty your clipboard.
Here’s how to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers palette.
2. Grab the Move tool (four headed arrow) from the Tools palette.
3. Drag and drop the layer onto your destination file.
The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the
image. You don’t need to have a selection border to copy the entire layer.
But, if you want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your selection
before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you want the selected
element to be centered on the destination file, press the Shift key as you
drag and drop. 
Here’s a handy tip. If you have several elements (but not touching one another)
on one layer and want to select only one of the elements to drag and drop, use
the Lasso tool to make a crude selection around the object without touching
any of the other elements. Then press the Ctrl key and press the up-arrow
key once. The element then becomes perfectly selected. Drag and drop with
the Move tool as described in Step 3 above.

Using the Paste Into Selection command
The Paste Into Selection command lets you put an image on a separate layer
while also inserting that image into a selection border. For example, in Fig-
ure 8-9, we used this command to make it appear as if our surfer is in the water. 
Figure 8-9: Use the Paste Into Selection command to make one element 
appear as though it is coming out of another element.
You can do the same by following these steps:
1. Make your desired selection on the layer in your destination image.
In our figure, we selected the area in the water where the surfer would
be positioned.
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
The image can be within the same file or from another file. Our surfer
was in another file.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste Into
Selection.
Elements converts the selection border on the layer into a layer mask.
The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection border. In our
example, the surfer only shows inside the selected area. His ankles and
feet are outside the border and therefore are hidden. 
175
Chapter 8: Working with Layers

176
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Moving a Layer’s Content
Moving the content of a layer is a piece of cake. Grab the Move tool from the
Tools palette, select your layer in the Layers palette, and drag the element on
the canvas to your desired location. You can also move the layer in 1-pixel
increments with the keyboard arrow keys. Press Shift with the arrows to
move in 10-pixel increments.
The Auto-Select Layer option in the Options bar enables you to switch to a
layer when you click any part of that layer with the Move tool. But be careful
if you have a lot of overlapping layers because this can sometimes be more
trouble than it’s worth.
Transforming Layers
When working with layers, you may find the need to scale or rotate some
of your images. You can do so easily by applying the Transform and Free
Transform commands. The methods to transform layers and transform 
selections are identical. 
Here’s how to transform a layer:
1. Select your desired layer. 
You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously
by linking the layers first.
2. Choose Image➪Free Transform.
A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer. Drag a corner handle
to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging to constrain the proportions.
To rotate your contents, move your mouse cursor just outside a corner
handle until it turns into a curved arrow and then drag. To distort, skew,
or apply perspective to the contents, right-click and choose the desired
command from the context menu. If you would rather enter your trans-
form values numerically, you can do so in the fields in the Options bar.
If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose
the individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from the
Image➪Transform menu. Or to rotate, you can choose Image➪Rotate.
3. When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the
bounding box or click the Commit button in the options bar.
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Each time you
transform pixels, you put your image through the interpolation process
(see Chapter 3 for more on interpolation). If done to the extreme, it can
degrade the quality of your image. This is why it is prudent to use the

Free Transform command rather than individual commands, so that all 
transformations can be executed in one fell swoop.
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing
a command. Select the Show Bounding Box option on the Options bar.
This option surrounds the layer, or selection, with a box with handles.
Drag the handles to transform the layer or selection.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Layers are fun and fantastic, but they can quickly chew up your RAM and
bloat your file size. And sometimes, to be honest, having too many layers
can start to make your file tedious to manage, thereby making you less 
productive. Whenever possible, you can merge your layers to save mem-
ory and space. Merging combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into a
single layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is
retained.
In addition, if you need to import your file into another program, certain pro-
grams do not support files with layers. Therefore you may need to flatten your
file before importing it. Flattening an image combines all the visible layers
into a background. Hidden layers are discarded, and any transparent areas
are filled with white. We recommend, however, that before you flatten your
image, you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and save it as a
native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any edits, you have
that added flexibility of having your layers.
By the way, the only file formats that support layers are native Photoshop
(.psd); Tagged Image File Format, or TIFF (.tif); and Portable Document
Format, or PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements
automatically flattens your layers down into a background. 
Merging layers
You can merge your layers in a couple of ways. Here’s how:
 Display only those layers you want to merge. Click the eye icon
in the Layers palette to hide those layers you don’t want to merge.
Choose Merge Visible from the Layers palette pop-up menu or
Layer menu. 
 Arrange the layers you want to merge adjacent to each other in
the Layers palette. Select the topmost layer of that group and choose
Merge Down from the Layers palette pop-up menu or Layer menu.
Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer directly
below it.

Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
1. Make certain that all layers you want to retain are visible because any
hidden layers will be discarded.
2. Choose Flatten Image from the Layers palette pop-up menu or
Layer menu.
All your layers are combined into a single background. Any transparent
areas are filled with the background color, as shown in Figure 8-10.
If you mistakenly flatten your image, choose Edit➪Undo or use your
Undo History palette. (If you’re not familiar with the History palette,
see Chapter 1 for details.)

 Cropping and straightening images
 Employing one-step auto fixes
 Editing with Quick Fix mode
 Fixing small imperfections
F
ixing images quickly without pain or hassle is probably one of the most
desirable features you’ll find in Elements and one we’re sure you’ll want
to embrace frequently. Whether you’re an experienced photographer or an
amateur shutterbug, cropping away unwanted background, tweaking the light-
ing or color of an image, or erasing away the minor blemishes of a loved one’s
face are all editing tasks you’ll most likely tackle. With these simple image
makeover tools in Elements, these tasks are as easy as clicking a single
button or as difficult as a few swipes with a brush.
Cropping and Straightening Images
Cropping a photo is probably one of the easiest
things you can do to improve the composition of
your photo. Getting rid of the unnecessary back-
ground around your subject creates a better focal
point. Another dead giveaway of amateurish pho-
tography is crooked horizon lines. Not a problem.
Elements gives you several ways to straighten those
images after the fact. So after your next photo shoot,
launch the Elements Editor and get in there and crop and
straighten your images before you show them off. No one
will be the wiser that the images were digitally doctored.

180
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most common way to crop a photo is by using the Crop tool. Simple,
quick, and easy, this tool gets the job done. Here’s how to use it:
1. Select the Crop tool from the Tools palette in either Standard Edit or
Quick Fix modes.
You can also press the C key. For details on the different workspaces,
see Chapter 1. For full details on Quick Fix mode, see the upcoming 
section.
2. Specify your Aspect Ratio options in the Options bar. Here are your
choices:
• No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size. 
• Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image
when you crop.
• Preset sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes.
When you crop, your image then becomes that specific dimension. 
When cropping an image, Elements retains the original resolution of
the file. What this means is, in order to keep your image at the same
resolution while simultaneously eliminating portions of your image,
Elements must resample the file. Therefore, it is important that you
have sufficient resolution so that the effects of the resampling aren’t
as noticeable. This is especially true if you are choosing a larger
preset size. If all this talk on resolution and resampling is fuzzy, be
sure to check out Chapter 3. 
• Width and Height: Enables you to specify a desired width and
height to crop your image.
3. Drag around the portion of the image you want to retain and release
your mouse button.
As you drag, a crop marquee bounding box appears. Don’t worry if
your cropping marquee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in the
next step.
The area outside the cropping marquee appears darker (called a shield)
than the inside in order to better frame your image, as shown in Figure 9-1.
If you want to change the color and opacity of the shield, or if you don’t
want it at all, change your Crop preferences (Edit➪Preferences➪Display &
Cursors). 

4. Adjust the cropping marquee by drag-
ging the handles of the crop marquee
bounding box.
To move the entire marquee, position
your mouse inside the marquee until
you see a black arrowhead cursor and
then drag. 
If you move your mouse outside the mar-
quee, your cursor changes to a curved arrow.
Drag with this cursor to rotate the marquee.
This allows you to both rotate and crop your
image simultaneously — handy for straight-
ening a crooked image. Just be aware that
rotation, unless it’s in 90-degree increments,
also resamples your image.
5. Double-click inside the cropping marquee. 
You can also just press Enter or click the
green Commit button next to the marquee.
Elements then discards the area outside the
marquee. To cancel your crop, click the red
Cancel button.
Cropping with a selection border
You can also crop an image by using the
Image➪Crop command in either Standard Edit or
Quick Fix mode. First, make a selection with any
of the selection tools and then choose the command. You can use this tech-
nique with any selection border shape. That is, your selection doesn’t have to
be rectangular. It can be round or even freeform. Your cropped image won’t
take on that shape, but Elements will crop as close to the boundaries of the
selection border that it can, as shown in Figure 9-2. For details about making
selections, see Chapter 7.
Straightening images
There may be times when you just didn’t quite get that horizon straight when
taking a photo of the beach. Or maybe you scanned a photo and it wasn’t quite
centered in the middle of the scanning bed. Not a big deal. Elements gives
you several ways to straighten an image.

Using the Straighten tool
This new tool enables you to specify a new straight edge and then rotates the
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
1. Select the Straighten tool from the Tools palette (or press the P key) in
Standard Edit mode only.
2. Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options in the Options
bar. Here are your choices:

• Grow Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases the size of
the canvas to fit the image area.
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas out-
side the image area. This is helpful if you have scanned an image
and have white areas around your photo that you want removed.
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming off
any background canvas.
3. Select Rotate All Layers if desired.
If you have an image with layers and you want all of them rotated, check
this option.
4. Draw a line in your image to represent the new straight edge.
Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop
options in Step 2, also cropped.
Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to the Straighten tool, you can also straighten your images by
using two commands in the Image menu, in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix
modes, as follows:
 To automatically straighten an image without cropping, which will leave
the canvas remaining around the image, choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten
Image.
 To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously, choose
Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.
Using the Divide Scanned Photos command
The Divide Scanned Photos command is great if you want to save time by
scanning multiple photos into one document. Cram all the photos you can
on your scanning bed and get one initial scan. Just make sure there is a clear
separation between each of the images. Then choose Image➪Divide Scanned
Photos in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix mode. Elements divides the
images and places each one in a separate file, as shown in Figure 9-3. Note
that if you have images with a lot of white in them, such as snow, you should
cover the scanner with a piece of dark paper to better delineate the bound-
aries of each image.

Employing One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting, contrast, and color correction tools that
can improve the appearance of your images with just one menu command.
These commands are available in either the Standard Edit or Quick Fix modes,
and they’re all in the Enhance menu. For more on Quick Fix mode, see the
upcoming section. 
The advantage of these one-step correctors is that they are extremely easy to
use. You don’t need to have one iota of knowledge about color or contrast to
use them. The downside to using them is that sometimes the result isn’t as
good as you could get via a manual color correction method. And sometimes
these correctors may even make your image look worse than before by giving
you weird color shifts. But because they are quick and easy, give them a try
on an image that needs some help. Usually, you won’t want to use more than
one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your image, undo and try another.
If you still don’t like the result, then move on to one of the manual methods
described in Chapter 10.

Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command is touted to adjust it all. It is designed to improve
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the
color balance, as shown in Figure 9-4. The overexposed image on the left was
improved quite nicely with the Auto Smart Fix command.
The Auto Smart Fix command is available in the Organizer, where you can
apply this command to several selected images simultaneously. It is also
now available in the Slide Show editor as well.
If the Auto Smart Fix was just too “auto” for you, you can crank it up a notch
and try Adjust Smart Fix. This command is similar to the Auto Smart Fix, but
gives you a slider where you, not Elements, controls the amount of correction
applied to the image.
Figure 9-4: In a hurry? Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This com-
mand works best on images that have pretty good contrast (detail in the
shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with and need just a minor
amount of adjustment. Auto Levels works by mapping, or converting, the
lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and white, thereby making
highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker, as shown in Figure 9-5.
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t improve
the contrast, it’s time to bring out the big guns. Try the Levels command
described in Chapter 10.

186
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 9-5: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job at
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does do a better job
at retaining the color balance of an image. It usually doesn’t cause the funky
colorcasts that can occur when using Auto Levels. This command works
great on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 9-6.
PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 9-6: The Auto Contrast command works wonders on hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast of an
image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the image
and a default set of values. These values adjust the amount of black and white
pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas of the image.
You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to balance the color
in your image, as shown in Figure 9-7. Occasionally, this command can also
be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated colors.

Figure 9-7: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a colorcast.
Auto Red Eye Fix
This new command is pretty self-explanatory. The Auto Red Eye Fix com-
mand automatically detects and eliminates red eye in an image. Red eye 
happens when the person or animal looks directly into the flash. Many cam-
eras have a red-eye prevention mode, which is a pre-flash that causes the
subjects’ irises to contract, making their pupils smaller when the real flash
goes off. Other cameras mount the flash high or to side of the lens, which
also reduces the chance of red eye. But if you have neither of these camera
options, or if it just happened, it isn’t difficult to rectify demonic red eye after
the fact.
The Auto Red Eye Fix command is also available in the Organizer, where you
can apply this command to several selected images simultaneously. You can
also automatically apply this fix when you acquire your images. Check the
Automatically Fix Red Eyes option in the File➪Get Photos dialog box. And
like Auto Smart Fix, you can now access this tool in the Slide Show editor
as well.
If for some reason, the Auto Red Eye Fix didn’t quite do the trick, you can
always reach for the Red Eye Removal tool in the Tools palette. Here’s how
to remove red eye manually:
1. Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools palette.
Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your image.
This one-click tool darkens the pupil, while retaining the tonality and
texture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 9-8.
187
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

188
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 9-8: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect and destroy dreaded 
red eye.
2. If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of the following
options:
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the
pupil.
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the
pupil.
Editing with Quick Fix
If you use the Auto Fixes we cover in the preceding section while in Quick Fix
mode, you may find all you need to repair and enhance your images and rarely
visit Standard Edit mode. And so in this section, we offer a closer look at Quick
Fix mode.
Quick Fix mode is a pared-down version of Standard Edit mode that conve-
niently provides basic fixing tools, plus tosses in a few unique features as
well, such as a before and after preview of your image.
Here is a step-by-step workflow that you can follow in Quick Fix mode to
repair your photos:
1. Select one or more photos in the Organizer and then choose Go to
Quick Fix from the Edit menu or the Shortcuts bar. Or if you are in

Standard Edit mode, click the Quick Fix button in the top right of the
application window.
If you happen to be in Standard Edit mode with an image already open,
this image will be transported into the Quick Fix mode. Note that you
can also open images by simply using the File➪Open menu command.
2. Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the
bottom of the application window. 
You choose to view just your original image (before), your fixed image
(after), or both side by side in either portrait or landscape orientations,
as shown in Figure 9-9.
3. Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your
image. See Chapter 5 for more on these tools. 
You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at
the bottom of the application window.
4. Crop your image by using the Crop tool in the Tools palette. 
You can also use any of the methods described earlier, in the “Cropping
and Straightening Images” section, except for the Straighten tool, which
is exclusive to Standard Edit mode.
Figure 9-9: Quick Fix mode enables you to view before and after previews of your image.
189
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
5. To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the application window.
6. Use the Red Eye tool to remove the red from your subjects’ eyes. 
Note that you can also automatically fix red eye by clicking the Auto
button under Red Eye Fix in the General Fixes palette on the right side of
the application window. Both of these methods are described earlier, in
the section, “Auto Red Eye Fix.”
7. Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels,
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction. 
All these commands are found under the Enhance menu or in the General
Fixes, Lighting, and Color palettes on the right side of the application
window.
Each of these fixes is described in detail earlier in this chapter. Remember,
usually one of the fixes is enough. Don’t stack them one onto another. If
one doesn’t work, click the Reset button near the image preview and try
another. If you’re not happy, go to Step 8.
8. If the auto fixes didn’t quite cut it, you’ll get more control by using the
sliders available for Smart Fix, Contrast, and Color, located in the
palettes on the right of the application window. If auto fixes did create
a result you’re happy with, skip to Step 9.
Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
• Lighten Shadows: Drag the slider to the right to lighten the darker
areas of your image without adjusting the highlights. 
• Darken Highlights: Drag the slider to the right to darken the lighter
areas of your image without adjusting the shadows. 
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values,
while leaving the highlights and shadows as is.
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
• Hue: Changes all the colors in an image. Make a selection first to
change the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use
restraint with this adjustment. 
• Temperature: Adjusts the colors warmer (red) or cooler (blue).
This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones or to correct
overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or overly warm
images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
• Tint: Adjust the tint after you have adjusted temperature to make
the color more green or magenta. 
If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more
manual adjustments, described in Chapter 10.
Note that you can also apply fixes to just selected portions of your image.
Quick Fix mode offers the Selection Brush and Magic Selection Brush tools
for your selection tasks. For details on using these tools, see Chapter 7. 

9. Finally, sharpen your image either automatically, by clicking the Auto
button, or manually, by dragging the slider in the Sharpen palette. 
Sharpening gives the illusion of increased focus by increasing the contrast
between pixels. This fix should always be the last adjustment you make
on your image.
Cloning with the Clone Stamp Tool
Elements enables you to clone elements without the hassle of genetically engi-
neering DNA. In fact, the Clone Stamp tool works by just taking sampled pixels
from one area and copying, or cloning, them onto another area. The advan-
tage of cloning over making a selection and copying and pasting is that it is
easier to realistically retain soft-edged elements such as shadows, as shown
in Figure 9-10.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-10: The Clone Stamp tool enables you to realistically 
duplicate soft-edged elements, such as shadows.
The Clone Stamp doesn’t stop there. You can also use this tool when fixing
flaws, such as scratches, bruises, and other minor imperfections. Although
the birth of the healing tools (discussed later in this chapter) has somewhat
pushed the Clone Stamp tool out of the retouching arena, it can still do a
good repair job in many instances.
191
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

192
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Here’s how to use the Clone Stamp tool:
1. Choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools palette in Standard
Edit mode.
You can also press the S key.
2. In the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Presets drop-
down menu. Use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size slider. 
Keep in mind that the size of the brush you specify should be appropri-
ate for what you are trying to clone or retouch. If you are cloning a large
object, use a larger brush. For repairing small flaws, use a smaller brush.
Cloning with a soft-edged brush usually produces more natural results.
For details on brushes, see Chapter 12.
3. Choose your desired blend mode and opacity percentage.
For more on blend modes, see Chapter 11. To make your cloned image
appear ghosted, use an opacity percentage of less than 100 percent. 
4. Select or deselect the Aligned option.
With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from
the same location, leave the Aligned option deselected. 
5. Select or deselect the Sample All Layers option.
This option enables you to sample pixels from all the 
visible layers for the clone. If deselected, the Clone 
Stamp tool clones only from the active layer. Check out
Chapter 8 for details about working with layers.
6. Alt-click the area of your image that you want to clone
to define the source of the clone. 
7. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone
to appear, as shown in Figure 9-11.
As you drag, Elements displays a crosshair icon along
with your Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair is the source
you are cloning from, while the Clone Stamp cursor is
where the clone is being applied. As you move the mouse,
the crosshair moves as well. This provides a continuous 
reference to the area of your image that you’re cloning.
Watch the crosshair, or you may clone something you
don’t want. 
If you’re cloning an element, it’s best to try and clone it without lifting your
mouse. Also, when retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. One or two clicks
on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-handed with the Clone Stamp,
you’ll get a blotchy effect that is a telltale sign that something has been
retouched. 
Figure 9-11: The
crosshair and
Clone Stamp
cursor in action.

You can also clone patterns by using the Pattern Stamp tool, which shares a
flyout menu with the Clone Stamp tool. Select a pattern from the Pattern picker
drop-down palette in the Options bar. Drag with the tool to clone a pattern
onto your image.
Retouching with the Healing Brush 
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool in that you clone
pixels from one area onto another area. But the Healing Brush is superior in
that it takes into account the tonality (highlights, midtones, and shadows) of
the flawed area. The Healing Brush clones by using the texture from the sam-
pled area (the source) and then using the colors around the brush stroke as
you paint over the flawed area (the destination). The highlights, midtones,
and shadow areas remain intact, making the repair more realistic and natural
and not as blotchy or miscolored as the Clone Stamp tool. 
Here are the steps to heal a photo:
1. Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush
tool from the Tools palette in Standard Edit mode.
You can also heal between two images, but be sure that they have the
same color mode, for example, both RGB. We chose a guy who looks
like he might like to lose a few years, as shown in Figure 9-12.
2. Specify a diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the Brush
picker drop-down palette in the Options bar.
You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on
these options, see Chapter 12. Don’t be shy. Be sure and adjust the size
of your brush as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw
you are retouching is critical to creating a realistic effect.
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
For most retouching jobs, you’ll probably want to leave it on Normal.
The Replace mode preserves textures, such as noise or film grain,
around the edges of your strokes. 
4. Choose one of the following Source options:
• Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. This is your choice for
the majority of your repairs.
• Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern chosen from the Pattern picker
drop-down palette.
5. Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
For most retouching tasks, you’ll probably want to leave it on Aligned.
• If Aligned is selected: When you click or drag with the Healing Brush,
Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing Brush cursor.
The crosshair represents the sampling point, also known as the
193
Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers

194
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
source. As you move the Healing Brush tool, the crosshair also moves,
providing a constant reference to the area that you are sampling. 
• If you deselect the Aligned option: Elements applies the source
pixels from your initial sampling point, no matter how many times
you stop and start dragging. 
6. Select the Sample All Layers option to heal an image using all visible
layers.
If this option is unselected, you heal only from the active layer. 
To ensure the maximum editing flexibility later on, select the Sample All
Layers option and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to
heal. When you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and
not on the image itself. This enables you to adjust opacity and blend
modes and to make other adjustment to the healed layer.
7. Establish the sampling point by Alt-clicking. Make sure to click on the
area of your image you want to clone from.
In our example, we clicked a smooth area of the forehead.
8. Release the Alt key and click or drag over a flawed area of your image.
Make sure to keep an eye on the crosshair because that’s the area you
are healing from. We brushed over the wrinkles under and around the
eyes and on the forehead, as shown in Figure 9-12. This guy never looked
so good, and there was absolutely no recovery time.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-12: Wipe out ten years in two minutes with the Healing Brush tool.

Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot
Healing Brush is great for smaller imperfections. The Spot Healing Brush
doesn’t require you to specify a sampling source. It automatically takes a
sample from around the area to be retouched. It’s quick and easy and often
effective. But it doesn’t give you control over the sampling source, so keep an
eye out for less-than-desirable fixes. 
Here’s how to quickly fix small flaws with the Spot Healing Brush tool:
1. Open your image and grab the Spot Healing Brush tool in Standard
Edit mode.
The moles on this guy’s face, shown in Figure 9-13, are no match for the
Spot Healing Brush.
2. In the Options bar, click the Brush Preset picker and select a desired
diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the drop-down palette.
It’s best to select a brush that is a little larger than the flawed area
you’re fixing.
3. Choose a blend mode from the Options bar.
As with the Healing Brush, the most likely mode is Normal.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-13: Now you see it (left), and now you don’t (right).

4. Choose a type from the Options bar:
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selec-
tion to fix the flawed area. 
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a tex-
ture to fix the flaw. 
Try Proximity Match first, and if it doesn’t work, undo and try Create
Texture.
5. Choose Sample All Layers to heal an image using all visible layers. 
If left unselected, you heal only from the active layer.
6. Click or drag on the area you want to fix.
We clicked on the moles with the Spot Healing Brush. But for the wrin-
kles around the eyes, we broke out the Healing Brush. We needed more
control of the sampling source to achieve realistic results.
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
The techniques of dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where
photographers fixed negatives that had overly dark or light areas by adding
or subtracting exposure, using holes and paddles as an enlarger made prints.
The Dodge and Burn tools in Elements are even better than their analog
ancestors in that they’re more flexible and a lot more precise. In Elements, you
can specify the size and softness of your tool by simply selecting from one of
the many brush tips. You can also limit the correction to various tonal ranges
in your image — shadows, midtones, or highlights. And finally, you can adjust
the amount of correction applied by specifying an exposure percentage.
Use these tools only on small areas, such as the girl’s face in Figure 9-14, and
in moderation. Also keep in mind that you can’t add detail that isn’t there to
begin with. If you try to lighten extremely dark shadows that contain little
detail, you will get gray areas. If you try to darken overly light highlights,
you’ll just end up with white blobs. 
Follow these steps to dodge or burn an image:
1. Choose either the Dodge or Burn tool (or press O) from the Tools
palette in Standard Edit mode. 

2. Select a brush from the Brushes preset picker drop-down palette and
also adjust the Brush size if necessary.
Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging or burning effect over a larger
area, making blending with the surrounding area easier.
3. From the Range pop-up menu, select Shadows, Midtones, or
Highlights. 
Use Shadows to darken or lighten the darker areas of your image. Use
Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. Choose Highlights to
make the light areas lighter or darker. 
In Figure 9-14, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged
the shadows.
Figure 9-14: Use the Dodge and Burn tools to lighten and darken small areas.
4. Choose the amount of correction you want to apply with each stroke
by adjusting the Exposure setting in the Options bar. 
Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount of darkening
or lightening. Exposure is similar to the Opacity setting you use with the
regular Brush tool. We used a percentage of 10 percent.
5. Paint over the areas you want to lighten or darken.
6. If you overdo it, press Ctrl+Z to undo the stroke.

Smudging Away Rough Spots
The Smudge tool, one of the focus tools, pushes your pixels around using the
color that is under the cursor when you start to drag. Think of it as dragging
a brush through wet paint. You can use this tool to create a variety of effects.
When it’s used to the extreme, you can create a warped effect. When it’s used
more subtly, you can soften the edges of objects in a more natural fashion than
with the Blur tool. Or you can create images that take on a painterly effect, as
shown in Figure 9-15. Keep an eye on your image as you paint, however, because
you can start to eliminate detail and wreak havoc if you’re not careful with the
Smudge tool.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-15: The Smudge tool can make your images appear to be painted.
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Smudge tool from the Tools palette in Standard Edit mode. 
You can also press the R key (press Shift+R to cycle through the avail-
able focus tools).

2. Select a brush from the Brushes presets drop-down palette. 
Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger brushes
produce more extreme effects.
3. Choose a blending mode from the Mode pop-up menu.
4. Choose the strength of the smudging effect with the Strength slider or
text box. 
The lower the value, the lighter the effect. 
5. If your image has multiple layers, select Sample All Layers, and Elements
will use pixels from all the visible layers to produce the effect. 
The smudge still appears only on the active layer, but the look is a bit
different, depending on the colors of the underlying layers.
6. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge using the fore-
ground color. 
Instead of using the color under your cursor, this option smears your
foreground color at the start of each stroke. If you want the best of both
worlds, you can quickly switch into Finger Painting mode by pressing
the Alt key as you drag. Release Alt to go back to Normal mode.
7. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z to undo and then
lower your Strength percentage even more.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used both for repair and for more artistic endeavors.
You can use the Blur tool to soften a small flaw or part of a rough edge. You
can add a little blur to an element to make it appear as if it were moving when
photographed. You can also blur portions of your image to emphasize your
focal point, as shown in Figure 9-16, where we blurred everything but the
girl’s face. The Blur tool works by decreasing the contrast among adjacent
pixels in the area blurred.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and its options are similar to those of
the Smudge tool, described earlier in this chapter. You obviously just won’t
find the Finger Painting option with the Blur tool. When using the Blur tool,
be sure to use a small brush for smaller areas of blur.

Focusing with the 
Sharpen Tool
If the Blur tool is Yin, then the Sharpen
tool is Yang. The Sharpen tool
increases the contrast among adja-
cent pixels to give the illusion that
things are sharper. This tool needs
to be used with restraint, however.
Sharpen can quickly give way to
overly grainy and noisy images if
you’re not cautious. 
It is best to use a light hand and
keep the areas you sharpen small.
Sometimes, the eyes in a soft portrait
can benefit from a little sharpening,
as shown in Figure 9-17. You can
also slightly sharpen an area to
emphasize it against a less than
sharp background.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-17: Reserve the Sharpen tool for small
areas, such as eyes.

To use the Sharpen tool, grab the tool from the Tools palette and follow the
steps provided for the Smudge tool. In addition, here are some tips for using
the Sharpen tool: 
 Use a lower value, around 25 percent or less. 
 Remember that you want to gradually sharpen your element to avoid the
nasty noisy grain that can occur from over sharpening. 
 Because sharpening increases contrast, if you use other contrast adjust-
ments, such as Levels, you will boost the contrast of the sharpened area
even more.
If you need to sharpen your overall image, try using the Unsharp Mask filter
instead. It offers more options and better control.
Sponging Color On and Off
The Sponge tool soaks up color or squeezes it out. In more technical terms, this
tool reduces or increases the intensity, or saturation, of color in both color
and grayscale images. Yes, the Sponge tool also works in grayscale mode by
darkening or lightening the brightness value of those pixels.
As with the Blur and Sharpen tools, you can use the Sponge tool to reduce
or increase the saturation in selected areas in order to draw attention to or
away from those areas. 
Follow these steps to sponge color on or off your image:
1. Choose the Sponge tool from the Tools palette in Standard Edit mode. 
Press the O key or press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge,
and Burn tools.
2. Select a brush from the Brushes preset drop-down palette.
Use large, soft brushes to saturate or desaturate a larger area. 
3. Choose either Desaturate or Saturate from the Mode pop-up menu to
decrease or increase color intensity, respectively.
4. Choose a Flow rate with the Flow slider or text box.
The flow rate is the speed with which the saturation or desaturation
effect builds as you paint.
5. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with
color. 
In our example in Figure 9-18, we saturated one of the kids to make her
more of a focal point and desaturated the others.

Replacing One Color with Another
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an image
with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a multitude of ways:
 Colorize a grayscale image to create the look of a hand-painted photo.
 Completely change the color of an element, or elements, in your image,
as shown in Figure 9-19. 
 Eliminate red eye if other, more automated methods don’t work to your
satisfaction. 
What we particularly like about the Color Replacement tool is that it preserves
all the tones of the image. The color applied is not like the opaque paint that

is applied when painting with the Brush tool. When you are replacing color,
the midtones, shadows, and highlights are retained. The Color Replacement
tool works by first sampling the original colors in the image and then replac-
ing those colors with the foreground color. By specifying different sampling
methods, limits, and tolerance settings, you can control the range of colors
that Elements replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing color with your foreground color:
1. Select the Color Replacement tool from the Tools palette in Standard
Edit mode. It shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools.
Alternatively, press the B (or Shift+B) key.
2. Specify your desired brush tip diameter and hardness from the Brush
preset picker drop-down palette.
3. Choose your desired blend mode. Here is a brief rundown of each:
• Color: The default, this mode works well for most jobs. This mode
works great when eliminating red eye.
• Hue: Similar to color, this mode is less intense and provides a 
subtler effect.
• Saturation: This is the mode to use to convert your color image
to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black in the Tools
palette.
• Luminosity: This is the opposite of Color and doesn’t provide
much of an effect.
4. Choose your sampling method (represented by the icons):
• Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously as you drag
your mouse.
• Once: Replaces colors only in areas that contain the color you first
sampled when you initially clicked.
• Background Swatch: Replaces colors only in areas containing your
current Background color.
5. Select your limits mode:
• Contiguous: Replaces the color of adjacent pixels containing the
sampled color.
• Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the sam-
pled color, whether or not they are adjacent.

6. Set your tolerance percentage.
Tolerance refers to a range of
color. The higher the value, the
broader range of color that will
be sampled, and vice versa.
7. Select anti-aliasing.
Anti-aliasing slightly softens the
edges of the sampled areas.
8. Click or drag on your image.
The foreground color replaces
the original colors of the sam-
pled areas. In our example,
shown in Figure 9-19, we used
a foreground color of black.

f you’ve tried the quick and easy automatic fixes
on your images and they didn’t quite do the job,
you’ve come to the right place. The great thing about
Elements is that it offers multiple ways and multiple
levels of repairing and enhancing your images. If an
auto fix didn’t cut it, then move on to a manual fix. If
you’re still not happy, you could consider shooting in
Camera Raw format, provided your camera is able to
do so. Elements has wonderful Camera Raw support,
enabling you to process your images to your exact specifi-
cations. Chances are that if you can’t find the tools to correct
and repair your images in Elements, they’re probably beyond
salvaging.
That being said, and with information in Chapter 9 and this chapter at your
fingertips, you’ll want to try and employ some kind of logical workflow when
tackling the correction and repair of your images:

206
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
1. Make sure and first crop, straighten, and resize your images if necessary. 
2. After you have them in their proper physical state, then correct the
lighting and establish good tonal range for your shadows, highlights,
and midtones in order to display the greatest detail possible. 
Often just correcting the lighting will solve minor color problems. If not,
move on to adjusting the color balance. 
3. Eliminate any color casts and adjust the saturation if necessary. 
4. Then grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters,
to retouch any flaws. 
5. Finally, sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clar-
ity and sharpness. 
By following these steps and allocating a few minutes of your time, you
should be able to get all your images in shape to print, post, and share
with family and friends.
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the Auto
tools, described in Chapter 9, didn’t work or were just too, well, automatic, for
you. You’ll find that the manual tools offer more control over adjusting over-
all contrast as well as bringing out details in shadow, midtones, and highlight
areas of your images. 
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadow/Highlight command offers a quick and easy method of correcting
over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well with images
shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back (backlit).
These images usually suffer from having the subject partially or completely
enveloped in shadows, such as the original image (left) in Figure 10-1. 
To use the Shadow/Highlight adjustment, follow these steps:
1. In Standard Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Shadows/Highlights. Make sure that Preview is checked.
In either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, when the dialog box appears,
the correction is automatically applied in your preview. 
2. If the automatic adjustment doesn’t quite do the job, move the sliders
(or enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your Shadows
(dark areas), Highlights (light areas), and Midtones (middle toned areas).
Remember that you want to try and reveal more detail in the dark and
light areas of your image. If after you do so, your image still looks like it
needs more correction, add or delete contrast in your midtone areas. 

Figure 10-1: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/Highlights adjustment.
3. Click OK to apply the adjustment and exit the dialog box.
If you want to start over, press Alt and click the Reset button (previously
the Cancel button).
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its aptly descriptive moniker, the Brightness/Contrast command
doesn’t do that great of a job brightening (making an image darker or lighter)
or adding or deleting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this 
command because of its appropriate name and ease of use. But once users
realize its limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls such
as Shadows/Highlights and Levels. 
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the
adjustment equally to all areas of your image. For example, you may have a
photo that has some highlights that need darkening but all the midtones and
shadows are perfect. The Brightness slider isn’t smart enough to recognize
that. So when you start to darken your highlights, your midtones and shad-
ows also become darker as well. To compensate for the unwanted darkening,
you try and adjust the Contrast, which won’t fix the problem.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
The moral is if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select only
the areas that need the correction (for more on selections, see Chapter 7), as
shown in Figure 10-2. Then choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/
Contrast.
Figure 10-2: The Brightness/Contrast adjustment is best reserved for correcting selected areas
(left), rather than the entire image (right).
Pinpointing proper contrast with Levels
If you want real horsepower when it comes to correcting the brightness and
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than what you find
with the other lighting and color adjustment commands, but when you under-
stand how it works, it can be downright user friendly. 
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, detailed in
Chapter 9. The Levels command, its manual cousin, offers much more con-
trol. And unlike the primitive Brightness/Contrast control, Levels enables you
to darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that Levels can be used
on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. You can also apply the
Levels command by using an adjustment layer, as described in Chapter 8.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you
want to seriously figure out how to use. Here’s how it works:
1. In Standard Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels.
The Levels dialog box appears, displaying a graph called a histogram. The
histogram displays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of
the 256 available brightness levels. Shadows are shown in the left of the
histogram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right.
Note that, in addition to viewing the histogram of the composite RGB chan-
nel (the entire image), you can view the histogram of just the Red, Green,
or Blue channel by selecting one of them from the Channel pop-up menu.

Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using
the RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s com-
ponent color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel
pop-up menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected areas.
This can be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting, while
others don’t.
2. In Standard Edit mode, choose Window➪Info to open your Info palette.
3. Set the black and white points manually using the Eyedroppers in the
dialog box. Select the White Eyedropper tool and move the cursor
over the image.
4. Look at your Info palette and try to find the lightest white in the
image. Select that point by clicking.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to
find the darkest black in the image.
By setting the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels will
be redistributed between those two points. 
You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position of the
white and black triangles on the input sliders (just under the histogram).
Or you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three boxes repre-
sent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use the numbers 0
to 255 in the white and black boxes.
6. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts. Select a neu-
tral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info palette shows
equal values of red, green, and blue.
If your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper tool.
If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a
color cast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu
and doing one of the following:
• Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to
add cyan or to the left to add red.
• Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right
to add magenta or to the left to add green.
• Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right
to add yellow or to the left to add blue.
7. If your image requires it, adjust the output sliders at the very bottom
of the Levels dialog box. 
Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shadows
and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces the
contrast in the highlights and darkens the image. 
209
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

210
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
8. Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input
slider.
The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle left to lighten mid-
towns, drag right to darken them. You can also enter a value. 
9. Click OK to apply your settings and exit the dialog box.
Your image should be greatly improved, as shown in Figure 10-3.
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as
the Auto Levels command, explained in Chapter 9. Note the changes, and
subsequent pixel redistribution, made to the histogram after clicking. 
Figure 10-3: Improve the contrast of an image with the intelligent Levels command. 
Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as unattainable as winning
the state lottery. Sometimes unexpected color casts (a shift in color) can be
avoided at the shooting stage, for example by using (or not using, in some
cases) a flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually do a pretty good job
correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments. Occasionally,
you may want to change the color of your images to create a certain special
effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip the color out of your image alto-
gether to create a vintage feel. Remember that all these color adjustments can
be applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just a selection. Whatever
your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Chapter 4.

Removing color casts automatically
If you’ve ever taken a photo in an office or classroom and got a funky green
tinge in your image, it’s probably the result of the overhead fluorescent lighting.
To eliminate this green color cast, you can apply the Color Cast command.
This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color and remove the cast.
Follow the short steps below to correct your image:
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Quick
Fix or Standard Edit mode.
The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to
better view your image.
2. Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral
gray, as shown in Figure 10-4. In our example, we clicked the sky in
the image on the left.
The colors in the image will adjust according to the color you choose.
Which color should you choose? This depends on the subject matter of
your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely a preview
at this point and won’t be applied until you click OK. If you really goof
up, click the Reset button, and your image will revert back to its unad-
justed state.
3. If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and exit
the dialog box.
If the Remove Color Cast command didn’t cut it, try applying a photo filter
(described in the later section, “Adjusting color temperature with photo 
filters”). For example, if your photo has too much green, try applying a
magenta filter.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image.
Saturation is the intensity or richness of that color. And Lightness controls
the brightness value.
Follow these steps to adjust color using the Hue/Saturation command:
1. In either Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust
Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation. 
The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure and check the Preview
button so that you can view your adjustments.
2. Select all the colors (Master) from the Edit pop-up menu, or choose
one color to adjust.
3. Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust
the colors as described:
• Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclock-
wise (drag left) around the color wheel. 
• Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich-
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives
you the appearance of a grayscale image.
• Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white
(drag right) or decreases the brightness values by adding
black (drag left).
The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors
in their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The lower
color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted.
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
The Hue/Saturation dialog box also lets you colorize images, a useful
option for creating sepia colored images.
4. (Optional) Check the Colorize option to change the colors in your
image to a new, single color. Drag the Hue slider to change the color
to your desired hue.
The pure white and black pixels will remain unchanged, while the inter-
mediate gray pixels will be colorized.

Use the Hue/Saturation command, with the Colorize option, to create tinted
photos, such as the one shown in Figure 10-5. You can also take a grayscale
image, make selections, and apply a different tint to each selection. This can
be especially fun with portraits. Tinted images can create vintage or moody
feels and can transform even mediocre photos into something more special.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
With all this talk about color, we real-
ize that there may be times when
you don’t want any color at all. With
Element’s Remove Color command,
you can easily eliminate all the color
out of an image, layer, or selection. In
Figure 10-6, we made a selection on
the right side of the image and applied
the Remove Color command. To use
this one step command, simply
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Remove Color.
Sometimes stripping away color with
this command can leave your image
flat or low in contrast. If this is the
case, adjust the contrast using one of
Element’s many lighting fixes such as
Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, or Levels.
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors in
your image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to replace
by creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white (selected),
black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. See Chapter 7 for
more details on masks. You can then adjust the hue and or saturation of
those selected colors.
Follow these steps to get on your way to replacing color:
1. In Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Replace Color.
The Replace Color dialog box appears. Make sure to check Preview.
2. Choose either Selection or Image:
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview window. The unselected
areas are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected areas
are white.
• Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview window.
3. Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview
window.
4. Press the Shift key and click, or use the plus (+) Eyedropper tool, to
add more colors.

Remove Color command.

5. Press the Alt key or use the minus (–) Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider to
fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection based
on the Fuzziness value.
7. Move the Hue and or Saturation sliders to change the color or color
richness, respectively.
8. View the result in your image window. If you’re satisfied, click OK to
apply the settings and exit the dialog box.

Adjusting skin tones
Occasionally, you may find that the loved ones in your photos have taken on
a rather sickly shade of green, red, or some other non-flesh colored tone.
To rectify that problem, Elements has come up with a command specifically
designed to adjust the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to a
natural shade.
Here’s how to use this new feature:
1. Open your image in Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, check Preview,
and do one or both of the following:
• Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you do not have any
layers, your entire image will be adjusted.
• Select your desired areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the
selected areas will be adjusted. This is a good way to go if you’re
happy with the color of your other elements and you just want
to tweak the skin tones. For more on selection techniques, see
Chapter 7.
215
Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity

216
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-8.
3. In the image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be 
corrected. 
The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected
in Step 1. 
4. If you’re not satisfied with the results, click on another area or fiddle
with the Skin and Ambient Light sliders, as follows: 
• Tan: Adds or removes the amount of brown in the skin.
• Blush: Adds or removes the amount of red in the skin.
• Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it
warmer (right towards red) or cooler (left towards blue).
5. When you’re happy with the correction, click OK to apply the adjust-
ment and exit the dialog box.
To start anew, click the Reset button. And of course, to bail out completely,
click Cancel.

Defringing layers
A tell-tale sign of haphazardly com-
posited images is selections with
fringe. I don’t mean the cute kind
hanging from your leather jacket or
upholstery. I mean the unattractive
kind that consists of those back-
ground pixels that surround the
edges of your selections, as shown
in Figure 10-9. Inevitably, when you
move or paste a selection, some of
the background pixels are bound to
go along for the ride. These pixels
are referred to as a fringe or halo. Luckily, the new Defringe command
replaces the color of the fringe pixels with the colors of neighboring pixels that
do not contain the background color. In our example, we plucked the boat out
of a white studio background and placed it on an image of water. Some of the
background pixels were included in our selection and appear as a white fringe.
When we apply the Defringe command, those white fringe pixels are changed
to colors of nearby pixels, such as blue or red, as shown in Figure 10-9.
Here are the steps to defringe your selection:
1. In Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode, Copy and Paste a selection onto 
a new or existing layer, or drag and drop a selection onto a new 
document.
For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
The Defringe dialog box appears.
3. Enter a value for the number of pixels that need to be converted. 
Try 1 or 2 at first to see if that does the trick. If not, you may need to
enter a slightly higher value.
4. Click OK to accept the value and exit the dialog box.
Correcting with Color Variations
Although we’ve already given you several ways to eliminate color casts in
an image, we are going to throw in one more. The Variations command is a
digital color correction feature that has been around for years and is largely
unchanged. That’s probably because it is one of those great features that is
easy to use, easy to understand, and works. The command works by enabling
you to make corrections by visually comparing thumbnails of color variations
of your image. You might use this command when you’re not quite sure what’s
wrong with the color or what kind of color cast your image has.
Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:

1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Quick Fix or
Standard Edit mode.
The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in
Figure 10-10.
2. Select your desired tonal range or color richness. If you’re unsure
which range to select, start with the Midtones. Options are as follows:
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light
areas in the image, respectively.
• Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your image
is faded from time, be sure and increase the saturation after you’ve
corrected any color cast issues.
Usually, just correcting the Midtones will be enough to get your image’s
color in order, but if not, you can always adjust the Shadows and Highlights
as well.
3. Specify how much adjustment you want with the Adjust Color slider. 
PhotoSpin

4. If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust your
color by clicking on the various Increase or Decrease (color) buttons.
Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to
correct the problem.
Be sure to keep an eye on the After thumbnail, which reflects your cor-
rections as you make them. 
5. Click the Darken or Lighten buttons to make the colors a little darker
or lighter.
6. If you selected Saturation in Step 2, click the Less Saturation or More
Saturation buttons.
7. If you’ve made a mistake, or several mistakes for that matter, click the
Undo button. 
The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you’ve
really botched it, you can always click the Reset Image button to start
again. Keep in mind that you cannot undo the Reset Image command
after you’ve clicked it. Click Cancel to bail out entirely.
8. To apply your color adjustments and exit the dialog box, click OK.
The Variations command is a great tool to correct those old, faded, green (or
some other unwanted color) tinted circa yesteryear photos. Variations allows
you to easily correct the color and saturation of these precious, but damaged,
images. Remember to either decrease the offending color or add the color
that is the opposite of the cast in the image. If it is too red, add green and vice
versa.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color temperature
of light makes an image blue. Conversely, an image shot in a lower color tem-
perature makes a photo yellow. In the old days, photographers used to place
a colored glass filter in front of their camera lens to adjust the color tempera-
ture of the light. This would be done to either warm up or cool down a photo,
or to just add a hint of color for a subtle special effect. Elements gives you
the digital version of these filters with the Photo Filter command.
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
1. Choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter in the Standard Edit mode. 
The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by
creating a photo filter adjustment layer. For details, see Chapter 8. 
219

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
2. In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the drop-
down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the Color
Picker.
Here is a brief description of each of the preset filters:
• Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjusts the white balance in
an image to make the colors warmer, or more yellow. Filter (81) is
like (85) and (LBA), but is best used for minor adjustments. In our
example in Figure 10-11, we used the Warming Filter (85) to warm
up an overly cool winter shot.
• Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjusts the white balance,
but instead makes the colors cooler, or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80)
and (LBB), but is designed for slight adjustments.
• Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try and eliminate
a color cast or for a special effect. 
3. Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to
your image. 
4. Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening
your image. 
5. Click OK to apply your filter and exit the dialog box.

Mapping your colors
Elements provides some commands referred to as color mappers, which change
the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. The color map-
pers are found under the Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 10-12 shows
an example of each command, which is also briefly described in the following
subsections.

This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remaining
pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your individ-
ual image.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega-
tive. Black reverses to white, colors convert to their complementary hues
(blue goes to yellow, red goes to green, and so on).
Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are brighter
than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that are darker
than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to achieve differ-
ent high-contrast effects.
The Threshold command can come in handy when you need to clean up
scans of line art, such as hand-drawn sketches, people’s signatures, pages
from a book, or even sheet music. Often when scanning things on paper, the
slight color from the paper appears as a dull gray background in the scan.
By applying the Threshold command, you can adjust the tones in your image
to black and white and drop out the gray. Simply move the slider to get your
desired balance of white and black areas.
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster look,
while higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.
Adjusting Clarity
After your image has the right contrast and color, and you’ve fixed any flaws, as
described in Chapter 9, you’re ready to finally work on the overall clarity of
that image. Although you may have fixed the nitpicky little blemishes with the
healing tools, if your image suffers from an overall problem like dust, scratches,
or artifacts (blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the help of a filter.
After you’ve totally cleaned up your image, the last chore is to give it a good
sharpening. Why wait until the bitter end to do so? That’s because sometimes,
while you’re improving the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws, you can
reduce the clarity and sharpness of an image. So you want to be sure that your
image is as soft as it’s going to get before you tackle your sharpening tasks. 
On the other hand, also be aware that sharpening itself increases contrast,

so depending on how much of your image you are sharpening, you may need
to go back and fine-tune your image using the lighting adjustments described
previously in this chapter. 
Finally, with all this talk about sharpening, we know you might find it strange
when we say you may also need to occasionally blur your image. Blurring can
be done to eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during scanning, soften
distracting backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even to create the illu-
sion of motion. 
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
Surprisingly, the tools you want to use to eliminate junk from your images are
found in the Filter➪Noise filter submenu in Standard Edit mode. With the
exception of the Add Noise filter, the others help to hide noise, dust, scratches,
and artifacts. Here’s the list of junk removers:
 Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blurring
of your image (that’s what’s hiding the junk), but hopefully, the edges
are still sharp.
 Dust & Scratches: The name says it all. This filter hides dust and scratches
by blurring those areas of your image that contain the nastiness (it looks
for harsh transitions in tone). Specify your desired Radius value, which
is the size of the area to be blurred. Also specify the Threshold value,
which determines how much contrast between pixels must be present
before they are blurred. 
Use this filter with restraint, because it can obliterate detail and make
your image go from bad to worse.
 Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter
goes through is rather technical, so suffice it to say that the light spots
darken, the dark spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed.
Specify your desired Radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
 Reduce Noise: This filter, which we used to correct the original image (left)
in Figure 10-13, is designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from
your images. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes images look
overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in your image:
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction. 
• Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details
but reduces the amount of noise removed. 
• Reduce Color Noise: Removes random colored pixels.
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Removes the blocks and halos that can
occur from low-quality JPEG compression.

Figure 10-13: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts. 
Blurring when you need to
It may sound odd that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image. But
if you have a photo that is overly grainy or suffers from a nasty moiré pattern
(described in the following list), you may need to blur the image to correct
the problem. And occasionally, you may even want to blur the background of
an image to deemphasize distractions or to make the foreground elements
appear sharper and provide a better focal point.
All your blurring tools are found in the Filter➪Blur menu in Standard Edit
mode, with the exception of the Blur tool, which is explained in Chapter 9:
 Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image
or selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image. 
 Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring
to the whole image.
 Blur More: The last one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but
more intensely. 
 Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects.
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure and
check Preview to see the effect as you enter your values.
 Radial Blur: Need to simulate a moving Ferris wheel or some other round
object? This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the amount of
blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along concentric circular
lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or choose Zoom to blur along radial
lines and mimic the effect of zooming into your image. Specify your desired
Quality. Because the Radial Blur filter is notoriously slow, Elements gives

you the option of Draft (fast but grainy) or Good and Best (slower but
smoother). The difference between Good and Best is only evident on
larger, higher-resolution images. Finally, indicate where you would like
the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram thumbnail.
 Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the Radius and Threshold,
both defined later in the “Sharpening for better focus” section. Start with
a lower value for both and adjust from there. Choose a quality setting
from the pop-up menu. Choose a mode setting. Normal blurs the entire
image or selection. Edge Only blurs only the edges of your elements and
uses black and white in the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just
the edges, but it applies only white to the blurred pixels.
 Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter to discuss is probably the one you’ll
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of
blurring you desire. 
Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camouflage moiré patterns on scanned
images. A moiré pattern is caused when you scan halftone images.
A halftone is created when a continuous tone image, such as a photo,
is digitized and converted into a screen pattern of repeating lines (usually
between 85 and 150 lines per inch) and printed. When you then scan that
halftone, a second pattern results and is overlaid on the original pattern.
These two different patterns bump heads and create a nasty moiré pat-
tern. The Gaussian Blur filter doesn’t eliminate the moiré, it simply
merges the dots and reduces the appearance of the pattern, as shown in
Figure 10-14. Play with the Radius slider until you get an acceptable trade
off between less moiré and less focus. If you happen to have a descreen
filter built into your scanning software, you can use that as well during
the actual scanning of the halftone image.

Sharpening for better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need any contrast, color, and flaw fixing, feel
free to jump right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a scanner
or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments.
Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area in your image
just so that it stands out more.
First, let us say that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s
captured. But you can do a pretty good job faking it. All sharpening tools work
by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased contrast
causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion that the
focus is improved, as shown in Figure 10-15.
Elements provides several sharpening tools all found in the Filter➪Sharpen
menu. You can also use the Sharpen tool for small areas, as described in
Chapter 9. Here’s a description of each of the sharpen filters:
Figure 10-15: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing contrast between
adjacent pixels. 
 Sharpen: This one-step filter increases the contrast between all the pixels
in the image or selection. It’s best reserved for small areas because it
has a tendency to make solid-colored areas that aren’t part of the edges
appear grainy. 
 Sharpen Edges: Another one-step filter that focuses on the edges of
the elements in your image, adding sharpness while avoiding adding
grain. It’s better than Sharpen and Sharpen More, but not as good as
Unsharp Mask.

 Sharpen More: The last one-step filter is similar to Sharpen but increases
the contrast between pixels even more. Again, use it for minor touch ups
and avoid it for large areas.
 Unsharp Mask: This filter, which gets its odd name from a darkroom tech-
nique, is your sharpening tool of choice. Unsharp Mask gives you several
options that enable you to control the amount of sharpening and the
width of the areas to be sharpened. Use them to pinpoint your desired
sharpening:
• Amount: Specify your desired amount (from 1 to 500%) of edge
sharpening. The higher the value, the more contrast between pixels
around the edges. Start with a value of 100% (or less), which usually
gives good contrast without appearing overly grainy.
• Radius: Specify the width (from .1 to 250 pixels) of the edges that
the filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the edge.
The value you use is largely based on the resolution of your image.
Low-resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-resolution
images require a higher value. 
Be warned that specifying a value that is too high will overempha-
size the edges of your image and make it appear too contrasty or
even goopy around the edges.
A good guideline in selecting a starting radius value is to divide
your image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300 ppi
image, set the radius at 2 and then adjust by your eye from there.
• Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255)
that must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is
sharpened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast
difference. Higher values only sharpen when adjacent pixels are
very different in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at
0 unless your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too high
can cause unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharp-
ened areas. 
Occasionally, the values you enter in the Amount and Radius may
sharpen the image effectively, but in turn create excess grain, or noise,
in your image. You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the
Threshold value.

n addition to correcting photos to improve
their appearance, you can delve into the world
of the Photoshop Elements artist, where you can 
use tools to draw and paint on existing photos 
or create new blank documents and create your
own drawings. The tools available to you rival 
an artist’s analog tools, and Photoshop Elements’
capabilities are limited only by one’s imagination.
In this part, you discover how to apply different
artistic effects by using many tools and how to
customize tools for your own use, and you get
some helpful tips to create some dazzling images.
In addition to the artistic effects you can apply to
your photos, this section also handles working
with text. When it comes time to create a poster,
an advertisement, or some Web icons, the text 
features in Elements offer you many options for
creating headline type, body copy, and special
type effects.

fter giving your images a makeover — cropped, color cor-

get them all gussied up for a night out on the town. You
can do just that with filters, effects, Layer Styles, and
Blend Modes. These tools enable you to add that touch
of emphasis, drama, whimsy, or just plain goofy fun.
I’ll be the first to admit that often the simplest art
(and that includes photographs) is the best. That gor-
geous landscape shot or the portrait that perfectly
captures the expression on a child’s happy face is
something you may want to leave unembellished.
But for the times when a little artistic experimenta-
tion is order, turn to this chapter as your guide.
Having Fun with Filters
Filters have been around since the early days of digital imaging, when
Elements was just a little bitty program. Filters, also called plug-ins because
they can be installed or removed independently, change the look of your

232
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
image in a variety of ways, as shown in Figure 11-1. They can correct less-
than-perfect images by making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws,
as described in Chapter 10. Or they can enhance your images by making
them appear as though they were painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spot-
lights. Just make sure to create a backup of your original image if you plan on
saving your filtered ones. This section gives you the basics on how to apply a
filter and gives a few filtering tips.
Figure 11-1: Use filters to correct image imperfections or to completely transform them.
Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
 In either Standard Edit or Quick Fix modes, go to the Filter menu, choose
your desired filter category, and then select a specific filter.
 In Standard Edit mode only, choose Window➪Styles and Effects to open
the palette. Choose Filters from the drop-down list in the top-left corner
of the palette. Choose your filter category from the drop-down list in 
the top-right corner of the palette. Double-click the thumbnail of your
desired filter or drag the filter onto your image window.
 In either Standard Edit or Quick Fix modes, choose Filter➪Filter Gallery 
to apply one or more filters in a flexible editing environment. The Filter
Gallery is described later in this chapter.

Note that you cannot apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color
mode. And some filters don’t work on images in Grayscale mode. For a
refresher on color modes, see Chapter 3.
Corrective or destructive filters
Although there are no hard and fast rules, most digital-imaging folks classify
filters into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:
 Corrective filters usually fix some kind of image problem. They adjust
color, improve focus, remove dust or artifacts, and so on. Don’t get me
wrong — pixels are still modified. It’s just that the basic appearance of
the image remains the same, albeit hopefully improved. Two of the most
popular corrective filters, Sharpen and Blur, are covered in Chapter 10. 
 Destructive filters are used to create some kind of special effect. Pixels
are also modified, but the image may look quite a bit different than its
original. These kinds of filters create effects such as textures, brush
strokes, mosaics, lights, and clouds. They can also distort an image with
waves, spheres, and ripples.
One-step or multistep filters
All corrective and destructive filters are either one-step filters or multistep 
filters. One-step filters have no options and no dialog boxes; select the filter
and watch the magic happen. Multistep filters act almost like mini-applications.
Choose the filter and you are presented with a dialog box with options to spec-
ify. The options vary widely depending on the filter, but most come equipped
with at least one option to control the intensity of the filter. Multi-step filters
appear in the menus with an ellipsis following their names, indicating that a
dialog box follows the execution of the command.
Giving a filter an encore
If you like the filter you applied so much that you want to reapply it, either to
the same image or to a different one, all you have to do is either press Ctrl+F
or choose the name of the filter from the Filter menu. Either way, your last
filter, with the same settings, is reapplied to your image. You might want to
reapply a filter to make the effect more pronounced. Or maybe you want to
apply the same filter with the same settings to a series of different images. If
you want to reapply the filter, but need to tweak the settings, press Ctrl+Alt+F,
which brings up the last applied filter’s dialog box.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Fading a filter
Sometimes you don’t want the full effects of a filter applied to your image.
Sometimes fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less 
“computer-ish.” Here’s what you can do:
1. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.
Click OK when the dialog box
appears.
2. Apply your desired filter to the
duplicate layer.
3. Use the blend modes and opac-
ity settings located in the
Layers palette to merge the fil-
tered layer with the original
unfiltered image.
4. (Optional) Using the Eraser
tool, selectively erase portions
of your filtered image to enable
the unfiltered image to show
through.
For example, if you applied a
Gaussian Blur filter to soften a
harshly lit portrait, try erasing
the blurred portion that covers
the subject’s eyes to let the
unblurred eyes of the layer
below show through, as shown
in Figure 11-2. The sharply
focused eyes provide a natural
focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
Up to this point, we’ve been referring to applying filters to your images. But
really, we’ve been using this word rather loosely. You don’t necessarily have
to apply filters to your entire image. You can apply filters to individual layers,
or even to selections. You can often get better effects when you apply a filter
just to a portion of an image or layer. For example, you can blur a distracting
background so the person in your image gets due attention. Or, as shown in
Figure 11-3, you can apply an Ocean Ripple or Wave filter to the ocean, leav-
ing your surfer unfiltered to avoid that overly “Photoshopped” effect. 
Exercising a little restraint when applying filters usually produces a more
attractive image.

the filtered and unfiltered images.

Working in the Filter Gallery
Don’t be surprised if, when you apply a filter, you are presented with a 
gargantuan dialog box. This editing window, as it’s officially called, is the
Filter Gallery. You can also access it by choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In 
the flexible Filter Gallery, you can apply multiple filters as well as edit them 
ad nauseum.
Even when using the Filter Gallery, remember to make a backup copy of your
image or at least create a duplicate layer before you apply filters. Filters
change the pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter
Gallery, the filters that are applied can’t be removed.

Follow these steps to work in the Filter Gallery:
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix modes.
The Filter Gallery editing window appears, as shown in Figure 11-4.
2. In the center of the editing window, click your desired filter category
folder.
The folder expands and shows the filters in that category. A thumbnail
displays each filter’s effect.
3. Select your desired filter.
You get a large dynamic preview of your image on the left side of 
the dialog box. To preview a different filter, just select it. Use the 
magnification controls to zoom in and out of the preview. To hide the
Filter menu and get a larger preview box, click the arrow to the left of
the OK button.

4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.
The preview updates accordingly.
5. When you are happy with the results, click OK to apply the filter and
exit the editing window.
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button
at the bottom of the editing window.
This duplicates the existing filter.
7. Choose your desired new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in
the applied filters area of the dialog box.
Each of the filters you apply is displayed in the bottom right of the Filter
Gallery dialog box. To delete a filter, select it and click the Delete Effect
Layer button. To edit a filter’s settings, select it in the list and make any
changes. Keep in mind that when you edit a filter’s settings, that edit
may affect the look of any subsequent filters you have applied. Finally,
you can rearrange the order of the applied filters. But doing so changes
the overall effect.
8. When you’re completely done, click OK to apply the filters and exit
the editing window.
Distorting with the Liquify filter
The Liquify filter is really much more than a filter. It’s a distortion that 
allows you to manipulate an image as though it were warm taffy. You can
interactively twist, pull, twirl, pinch, and bloat parts of your image. You can
apply this distort filter on the entire image, on a layer, or on a selection. This
über-filter comes equipped with a mega dialog box with its own set of tools
(on the left) and options (on the right), as shown in Figure 11-5.
Follow these steps to turn your image into a melted Dalí-esque wannabe:
1. Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify in either Standard Edit or Quick Fix
modes.
Your image appears in the preview area.
2. Choose your distortion weapon of choice.
You also have a number of tools to help zoom and navigate around your
image window.

Figure 11-5: The Liquify filter enables you to interactively distort your image. 
Here is a description of each tool to help you decide. See Figure 11-6 to
get a visual look at the effect of each distortion tool (the letter in paren-
theses is the keyboard shortcut):
• Warp (W): Pushes pixels forward as you drag, creating a stretched
effect. Use short strokes or long pushes.
• Turbulence (T): Drag to randomly jumble your pixels. Use this 
tool to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds,
flames, and waves. Adjust how smooth the effect is by dragging 
the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the
value, the smoother the effect.
• Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): Rotates pixels
either clockwise or counterclockwise. Place the cursor in one spot,
hold down the mouse button, and watch the pixels under your
brush rotate, or drag the cursor to create a moving twirl effect.
• Pucker (P): Press and hold or drag to pinch your pixels toward the
center of the area covered by the brush. To reverse the pucker
direction (bloat), press the Alt key as you hold or drag.
• Bloat (B): Press and hold or drag to push pixels toward the edge of
the brush area. To reverse the bloat direction (pucker), press the
Alt key as you hold or drag.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-6: The Liquify filter can transform a clock into something far from ordinary.
• Shift Pixels (S): Moves pixels to the left when you drag the tool
straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag clockwise
to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counter-
clockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any of the directions,
press Alt as you hold or drag.
• Reflection (M): Drags a reversed image of your pixels at a 90-degree
angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt key to force
the reflection in the direction opposite the motion of the brush.
Great for making reflections on water.
• Hand (H): Works like the Hand tool in the Elements Tools palette.
Drag with the Hand tool to move the image around the preview
window.
• Zoom (Z): Works like the Zoom tool in the Elements Tools palette.
Zooms you in and out (hold down the Alt key) so you can better
see your distortions. You can also zoom by choosing a magnifica-
tion percentage from the pop-up menu in the bottom-left corner

3. Specify your options in the Tool Options area as follows:
• Brush Size: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to
600 pixels to specify the width of your brush.
• Brush Pressure: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to
100 to change the pressure. The higher the pressure, the faster the
distortion effect is applied.
• Turbulent Jitter: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to
100 to adjust the smoothness when using the Turbulence tool.
• Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet
and stylus, click this option to select the pressure of your stylus.
4. Got a little carried away? Select the Reconstruct tool (R) and hold
down or drag the mouse on the distorted portions of the image you
want to reverse or reconstruct.
Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure
and watch closely as your mouse drags across the distorted areas.
5. Click OK to apply the distortions and exit the dialog box. 
However, if you mucked things up and want to start again, click the
Revert button to get your original, unaltered image back. This also
resets the tools to their previous settings. 
Dressing Up with Effects
In addition to the multitude of filters at your disposal, Elements also provides
lots of different effects that you can apply to enhance your photos. Effects are
unique in that, depending on the specific effect, each effect can be applied only
to a selection, layer, or type. The names of those effects are followed by labels,
as follows: (Selection), (Layer), or (Type). To compound the confusion,
some effects automatically create a duplicate of the selected layer, whereas
other effects can work only on flattened images. (See Chapter 8 for details on
layers.) Finally, unlike filters, you cannot preview how the effect will look on
your image or type, nor do you have any options to specify.
Here are the very short steps to apply an effect:
1. Select your desired image or type layer in the Layers palette. Or if you
are applying the effect to just a selection, make the selection prior to
applying the effect.
2. Choose Window➪Styles and Effects.
3. Choose Effects from the drop-down list at the top left of the palette.
4. Choose your desired category of effects from the drop-down list at the
top right of the palette:

• All: Shows all the effects described in this list.
• Frames: Includes effects that enhance the edges of the layer or
selection.
• Image Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to make your
image appear as though it were snowing, made of lizard skin or
neon tubes, or painted with oil pastels.
• Text Effects: These effects enhance your type with outlines, shad-
ows, spray paint, metal, confetti, or wood, as shown in Figure 11-7.
Note that when an effect is applied to type, it becomes simplified
and looses its editability. For more on type, see Chapter 13.
• Textures: Includes textured effects such as bricks, wood, rust, and
even slime.
5. In the Effects palette, double-click your desired effect or drag the
effect onto the image.
Note that you can view your styles and effects by thumbnails or by list.
To change the view, click More at the top-right corner of the palette.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Adding Shadows, Glows, and More
Going hand in hand with filters and effects are Layer Styles. Also designed to
enhance your image and type layers, Layer Styles range from simple shadows
and bevels to the more complex styles, such as buttons and patterns. The
wonderful thing about Layer Styles is that they are completely nondestruc-
tive. Unlike filters, Layer Styles don’t change your pixel data. You can edit
them or even delete them if you’re unhappy with the results.
Here are some important facts about Layer Styles:
 Layer Styles can be applied only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in
your image is a background, be sure and convert it to a layer first.
 Layer Styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
 When you apply a Layer Style to a layer, a florin symbol (which looks
like a fancy letter f) appears next to the layer’s name in the Layers
palette. Double-click the florin to bring up the Styles Settings dialog box
and perform any editing that’s necessary to get the look you want.
Applying Layer Styles
Layer Styles fall into a few different libraries. You can add shadows, glows,
beveled and embossed edges, and more complex styles such as neon, plastic,
and chrome, as well as various image effects. A sampling of styles is shown in
Figure 11-8. Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of
the style libraries.
1. Select your desired image or type layer in the Layers palette.
2. Choose Window➪Styles and Effects.
3. Choose Layer Styles from the drop-down list at the top left of the
palette. 
4. Choose your desired library of styles from the drop-down list at the
top right of the palette:
• Bevels: Bevels add a three-dimensional edge on the outside or
inside edges of the contents of a layer, giving the element some
dimension. Emboss styles make elements appear as though they
are raising off or are punched into the page. You can change the
appearance of these styles by adjusting the lighting angle, shadow

distance (how close the shadow is to the layer contents), size of
the outer glow and bevel, and bevel direction. The Use Global Light
option applies the same lighting angle for all styles and ensures
consistency in the light source.

• Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a
layer. Choose from the garden-variety shadow or one that includes
noise, neon, or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle and
shadow distance as desired.
• Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the out-
side or inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance
of the glow by changing lighting angle, shadow distance, and the
size of the glow.
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to either display, hide, or
partially show the layer contents. The Layer Style remains fully 
displayed.
• Complex and others: The remaining Layer Styles are a cornucopia of
different effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more exotic
effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can customize
all these Layer Styles to a certain extent by adjusting the various
settings, which are similar to those for other styles in this list.
5. In the Layer Styles palette, double-click your desired effect or drag
the effect onto the image.
The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles, specifically one
style from each library, to a single layer.
To edit the style’s settings, either double-click the florin in the Layers
palette or choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings.
Working with Layer Styles
Here are a few last tips for working with Layer Styles:
 Delete a Layer Style(s): Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer Style or
drag the florin in the Layers palette to the trash can icon.
 Copy and paste Layer Styles onto other layers: Select the layer contain-
ing the Layer Style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style.
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. Easier, you can also just
drag and drop an effect from one layer to another while holding down
the Alt key.
 Hide/show Layer Styles: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects or
Show All Effects.
 Scale a Layer Style: Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This allows you
to scale the style without scaling the element.

Mixing It Up with Blend Modes
Elements sports a whopping 23 blend modes. Blend modes affect how colors
interact between layers and also how colors interact when you apply paint
onto a layer. Not only do blend modes create interesting effects, but you can
easily apply, edit, or remove blend modes without touching your image
pixels. 
The various blend modes are located under a pop-up menu at the top of your
Layers palette in Standard Edit mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect
of blend modes is not to memorize the descriptions we give you in the follow-
ing section. Instead, grab an image with some layers and apply each of the
blend modes to one or more of the layers and see what happens. The exact
result will vary depending on the colors in your image layers. Combine these
blend modes with varying Opacity settings and who knows what amazing
images can materialize?
General blend modes
The Normal blend mode needs no introduction. It’s the one you probably use
the most. Dissolve is the next one on the list and, ironically, is probably the
one you will use the least. Both blend modes are illustrated in Figure 11-9.
 Normal: The default mode lets each pixel display unadjusted.
 Dissolve: This mode can only be seen on a layer with an opacity setting
of less than 100%. It allows some pixels from lower layers, which are ran-
domized, to show through the target (selected) layer.

from one layer to peek randomly through another.

Darken blend modes
These blend modes produce effects that darken your image in various ways,
as shown in Figure 11-10:
 Darken: If the pixels on the target layer are lighter than those below, 
the lighter pixels turn transparent. If the pixels are darker, they are
unchanged.
 Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby
darkening all colors where they mix. When painting with the Brush 
or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker color, as if drawing with
markers.
 Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns
them with color, creating a contrast effect, like applying a dark dye to
your image.
 Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas-
ing the brightness. It’s like Multiply but often makes parts of your image
black.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-10: These blend modes darken your image layers.
Lighten blend modes
The lighten blend modes are the opposite of the darken blend modes. All
these blend modes create lightening effects on your image, as shown in
Figure 11-11:
Darken
Multiply
Color Burn
Linear Burn

 Lighten: If the pixels on the target layer are darker than those below, 
the darker pixels turn transparent. If the pixels are lighter, they are
unchanged. The opposite of Darken.
 Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under-
neath. The opposite of Multiply.
 Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. Like applying a
bleach to your image. 
 Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by
increasing the brightness. Like Screen but often makes parts of your
image white. 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-11: These blend modes lighten your image layers.
Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers, as shown in
Figure 11-12:
 Overlay: Multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and screens the
light pixels in the underlying layers. Enhances the contrast and satura-
tion of colors.
 Soft Light: Darkens the dark (greater than 50% gray) pixels and lightens
the light (less than 50% gray) pixels. Like shining a soft spotlight on the
image.

Figure 11-12: Some blend modes adjust the lighting between your image layers.
 Hard Light: Multiplies the dark (greater than 50% gray) pixels and screens
the light (less than 50% gray) pixels. Like shining a bright, hard spotlight
on the image. 
 Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, this
mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the pixels on the
top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by
decreasing the contrast.
 Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50% gray, the
mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the pixels on
the top layer are lighter than 50% gray, the mode lightens the colors by
increasing the brightness.

Hard Mix

 Pin Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent gray,
the mode replaces pixels darker than those on the top layer and doesn’t
change lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 
50 percent gray, the mode replaces the pixels lighter than those on the
top layer, and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. Usually reserved
for special effects.
 Hard Mix: Similar to Vivid Light, but reduces the colors to a total of
eight — Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, Red, Green, Blue, and White.
Creates a posterized effect.
Inverter blend modes
The Inverter blend modes invert your colors and tend to produce some
pretty radical effects, as shown in Figure 11-13:
 Difference: Produces a negative effect according to the brightness
values on the top layers. If the pixels on the top layer are black, there is
no change on the underlying layers. If the pixels on the top layer are
white, the mode inverts the colors of the underlying layers. 
 Exclusion: Like Difference, but less contrast and saturation. If the pixels
on the top layer are black, there is no change on the underlying layers.
If the pixels on the top layer are white, the mode inverts the colors of
the underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create gray.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
HSL blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model to
mix colors, as shown in Figure 11-14:
 Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
 Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with
the saturation of the top layer.
 Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation
and hue of the top layer. Enables you to paint color while preserving the
shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
The Color mode is a great tool for colorizing images. If you’ve ever admired
those hand-tinted black-and-white photos used in greeting cards and
posters, you can create the same effect fairly easily. First, make sure your
black-and-white image is in RGB mode so it is able to accept color. Create a
new layer in the Layer palette and set it to the Color blend mode. Grab the
Brush tool (with a soft-edged tip), choose your desired color, and paint over
your image. Adjust your opacity to less than 100% to create a softer effect.
 Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and sat-
uration of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer.
Preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top layer and
mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.

Using Photomerge Panorama
This awesome tool enables you to combine multiple images into a single
panoramic image, as shown in Figure 11-15. From skylines to mountain ranges,
you can take several overlapping shots and stitch them together into one.

PhotoSpin
Figure 11-15: Combine multiple images into a single panorama with Photomerge. 
To be successful at merging photos into a panorama, you need to start with
good source files. First of all, make sure that when you shoot your photos,
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 
50 percent. Then, avoid using distortion lenses (such as fish-eye) and your
camera’s zoom setting. Also try to keep the same exposure settings for even
lighting. Lastly, try to stay in the same position and keep your camera at the
same level for each photo. Using a tripod and rotating the head can help you
get shots at the same camera level.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Panorama image:
1. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Panorama in Standard Edit mode.
Note that you can also select this command in the Organizer.
2. In the first Photomerge dialog box, choose your source files. Click the
Browse button and navigate to where your files are located. 
3. After you have selected all applicable images, click OK.
Elements opens and automatically assembles the source files to create
the composite panorama in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks
good, skip to Step 6.
251
Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More

252
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Elements alerts you if it cannot automatically composite your source
files. You then have to assemble the images manually.
4. To manually assemble your panorama, drag the image thumbnails
from the lightbox area onto the work area with the Select Image tool
(the arrow) or simply double-click the lightbox thumbnail to add it to
the composition.
5. Arrange and position your images:
• Position the images by using the Select Image tool.
• Use the Rotate Image tool to make rotations.
• Use the Zoom and Move View tools to help view and navigate
around your panorama. 
You can also use the Navigator view box to zoom in and out of
your composition by dragging the slider. 
• Select the Snap to Image option to enable overlapping images to
automatically snap into place.
6. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in the
Settings area. Click your desired image with the Set Vanishing Point tool.
Elements changes the perspective of the composition. By default, Elements
selects the center image as the vanishing point. If necessary, you can move
the other images.
Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links non-
Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break the link,
click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the work area. 
7. Adjust the blending of the composition.
Select the Perspective setting first and then choose Cylindrical Mapping
to reduce the bowed distortion you can get when you add perspective
to your composition.
If you have some color inconsistencies from having photos with different
exposures, select Advanced Blending to blend the different colors and
tones.
Click Preview to view your settings. Click Exit Preview to return to the
Edit mode. 
8. Select the Keep as Layers option to save each image in the composite
as an individual layer.
9. Click OK to create the panorama.
It opens as a new Photoshop Elements (.psd) file.

E
lements is such a deluxe, full-service image editing program that it doesn’t
just stop at giving you tools to select, repair, organize, and share your images.
It figures you may need to add a swash of color, either freeform with a brush
or pencil or in the form of a geometric or organic shape. Don’t worry,
this drawing and painting business isn’t just for those with
innate artistic talent. In fact, Elements gives you plenty of
preset brushes and shapes that you can use. If you can pick
a tool and drag your mouse, you can draw and paint.
Choosing Color
Before you start drawing or painting, you may want
to change your color to something other than the
default black. By now, I’m sure you’ve checked out the
Elements Tools palette and noticed the two overlapping
color swatches at the bottom of the palette. These two
swatches represent two categories of color — foreground
color and background color. Here’s a quick look at how they work
with different tools:
 When you add type, paint with the Brush tool, or create a shape, you are
using the foreground color. 
 When you erase with the Eraser tool, or when you increase the size of
your canvas, you are accessing the background color. 

254
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 And when you drag with the Gradient tool, provided your gradient is set
to the default, you are laying down a blend of color from foreground to
the background. 
Elements gives you three ways to choose your foreground and background
colors — the Color Picker, the Color Swatches, and the Eyedropper tool, which
samples color in an image. In the following sections, we explore each one.
Working with the Color Picker
By default, Elements uses a black foreground color and a white background
color. If you’re experimenting with color and want to go back to the default
color, press the D key. If you want to switch between foreground and back-
ground colors, press the X key. If you want any other color of the rainbow,
click your desired swatch to change either the foreground or background
color. This action transports you to the Color Picker, shown in Figure 12-1.
Here are the steps to choose your color via the Color Picker:
1. Click either the Foreground or Background color swatch in the Tools
palette.
The Color Picker appears.

2. Drag the color slider or click in the color bar to get close to the gen-
eral color you desire.
3. Choose the exact color you want by clicking in the large square,
called a color field, on the left.
The circle icon targets your selected color. The two swatches in the top-
right corner of the dialog box represent your newly selected color and
the original foreground or background color.
The numeric values on the right side of the dialog box also change
according to the color you have selected. If you happen to know the
values of your desired color, you may also enter them in the text boxes.
Remember, RGB values are based on brightness levels, from 0 (black) to
255 (white). You can also enter HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) values
or the hexadecimal formula for Web-safe colors.
4. When you’re happy with your color, click OK.
Dipping into the Color Swatches palette
Another way Elements enables you to choose a
foreground or background color is by selecting
a color in the Swatches palette. The Swatches
palette is a digital version of the artist’s paint
palette. In addition to the preset colors, you can
mix and store your own colors for use now and
later. You can have several palettes for certain
types of projects or images. For example, you
might want a palette of skin tones for retouching
portraits. Choose Window➪Color Swatches to
bring up the palette, shown in Figure 12-2.
To grab a color from the Color Swatches palette,
just click the color swatch you want. By the way,
it doesn’t matter which tool you currently have.
As soon as you move the tool over the palette, it
temporarily converts to an eyedropper that sam-
ples the color and makes it your new foreground
or background color. 
Although the Color Swatches palette is a breeze
to use, here are a few tips to help you along:
 Change the background color. Either first select the background swatch
in the Tools palette or Ctrl+click a swatch.
 Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, choose it
from the Color Swatches palette drop-down list. Elements offers libraries
specific to Web graphics, photo filters, and Windows systems.
255
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Figure 12-2: The Swatches
palette.

256
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 Add a color to the Color Swatches palette. To add a color to the
Swatches palette, choose New Swatch from the More pop-up menu.
Name your swatch and click OK.
 Save swatches. Choose Save Swatches from the More pop-up menu in
the top-right corner of the palette. We recommend saving the swatch
library in the default Color Swatches folder in the Presets folder. If 
by chance this folder doesn’t come up by default, just navigate to 
the Color Swatches folder by following this path: Adobe Elements
4.0\Presets\Color Swatches.
The Save Swatches for Exchange command enables you to save swatch
libraries that can be shared with other Adobe applications, such as
Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator.
 Load swatches. If you want to load a custom library created by you or
by someone else, choose More➪Load Swatches. In the dialog box, select
your desired library from the Color Swatches folder. The new library will
be appended (added) to your current library.
You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. For more
on the Preset Manager, see Chapter 2.
 Delete swatches. To delete a swatch, drag it to the trash can at the
bottom of the palette or Alt+click the swatch.
 Change the palette’s appearance. Click the More button in the upper
right to choose from Small or Large Thumbnail (swatch squares) or
Small or Large List (swatch squares with a name).
 Replace your current swatch library with a different library. Choose
Replace Swatches from the More pop-up menu. Choose a library from
the Color Swatches folder.
Sampling with the Eyedropper tool
The last way that Elements enables you to choose color is via the Eyedropper
tool. The Eyedropper tool comes in handy when you want to sample an exist-
ing color in an image and use it for another element. For example, let’s say we
want our text to be the same color as the green background in our image,
shown in Figure 12-3. We grab the Eyedropper tool (or press I) and click a
shade of green in the background. The tool samples the color and makes it our
new foreground color. We then create the type with our new foreground color. 
Here are few things to remember when using the Eyedropper tool:
 Sample a new foreground or background color. Obviously, you can
select either the foreground or background swatch in the Tools palette
before you sample a color. But if the foreground color swatch is active,
pressing the Alt key will sample a new background color, and vice versa.
 Choose a color from any open image. If you have multiple images open,
you can even sample a color from an image that you’re not working on!

 Choose your sample size in the Options bar. You have the option of
selecting the color of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample), or
Elements can average the colors of the pixels in a 3-x-3- or 5-x-5-pixel area.
 Make colors Web safe. If you right-click your image to bring up the context
menu, you have a hidden option — Copy Color as HTML. This option
provides the Web-safe hexadecimal color formula for that sampled color
and copies it to the Clipboard. You can then paste that formula into an
HTML file or grab the Type tool and choose Edit➪Paste to view the for-
mula in your image.
 Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. Elements, being
the multitasker that it is, enables you to temporarily access the
Eyedropper tool when you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color
Replacement, Gradient, Paint Bucket, Cookie Cutter, or Shape tools.
Simply press the Alt key to access the Eyedropper. Release Alt and
you’re back to your original tool.
Figure 12-3: The Eyedropper tool enables you to sample color from your image to 
use with other elements, such as type.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Getting Artsy with the Pencil and Brush Tools
Now that you’ve been thoroughly doused with every way to choose a color,
you probably want to find out how to paint and draw with that color. The
Pencil and Brush tools give you the power to put your creative abilities to
work, and the following sections show you how.
These are two tools that benefit immensely from the use of a pressure-sensitive
digital drawing tablet. The awkwardness of trying to draw or paint with a
mouse disappears and leaves you with tools that behave much closer to their
analog ancestors.
Drawing with the Pencil tool
Drawing with the Pencil tool creates hard edges.
You can’t get the soft, feathery edges that you can
with the Brush tool. In fact, the edges of a pencil
stroke cannot even be anti-aliased (for more on
anti-aliasing, see the section, “Painting with the
Brush tool”). So keep in mind that if you draw any-
thing other than vertical or horizontal lines, your
lines will have some jaggies when viewed up
close. But hey, don’t diss the Pencil just yet.
Those hard-edged strokes can be perfect for Web
graphics. And what’s more, the Pencil tool has the
ability to erase itself, and it’s great for digital
sketches, as shown in Figure 12-4.
Follow these steps to become familiar with the
Pencil tool:
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the N key. By default, the Pencil tool’s brush tip is the
1-pixel brush. Yes, even though the Pencil tip is hard-edged, we still refer
to it as a brush.
2. On the Options bar, choose your desired pencil options, beginning
with a brush preset. Click the arrow and select your desired brush
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette.
To load another preset library, click the Brushes menu at the top of the
palette.
Figure 12-4: The Pencil tool can
be used for digital drawings.

Remember, you aren’t limited to the standard old brush strokes. Check
out the Assorted and Special Effects brushes. You’ll be surprised at
some of the interesting brushes lurking in these palettes. Use them to
create stand-alone images or to enhance your photographic creations.
Access the pop-up menu on the drop-down palette to save, rename, or
delete individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries.
For more on these operations, see the upcoming section, “Painting with
the Brush tool.”
3. Choose your brush size.
A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail
image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size of that brush
tip, drag the slider or enter a value.
4. Select a blending mode.
You can find more about blend modes in Chapter 11.
5. If you want the background to show through your strokes, adjust the
Opacity by dragging the slider or entering an opacity percentage less
than 100 percent.
The lower the percentage, the more the background images show through.
Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you’ve drawn them.
For more on layers, see Chapter 8.
6. Select Auto Erase if you want to enable that option.
This option removes portions of your pencil strokes. For example, if my
foreground color is black and my background color is white and I apply
some black strokes, with Auto Erase enabled, if I drag back over my black
strokes, I apply white. If I drag over my white background, I apply black.
7. Click and drag with the mouse to create your freeform lines.
To draw straight lines, click at a starting point, release the mouse
button, and then Shift+click at a second point.
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool creates soft-edged strokes. How soft those strokes are depends
on what brush you use. By default, even the hardest brush has a slightly soft
edge because it is anti-aliased. Remember, anti-aliasing creates a single row of
partially filled pixels along the edges to produce the illusion of a smooth edge.
You can also get even softer brushes, which employ feathering. For details on
feathering, see Chapter 7.
259
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

260
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
The Brush tool shares most of the options found in the Pencil tool, except the
Auto Erase feature isn’t available. Here is the lowdown on the unique Brush
options:
 Airbrush: Click the Airbrush button on the Options bar to apply the
Airbrush mode. In this mode, the longer you hold down the mouse
button, the more paint pumps out of the Brush, and the wider the 
airbrush effect spreads.
 Tablet Options: If you’re using a pressure-sensitive digital drawing tablet,
check the settings you want the tablet to control, including size, scatter,
opacity, roundness, and hue jitter. The harder you press with the stylus,
the greater the effect of these options.
 More Options: Click the brush
icon to the right of the More
Options label to access the addi-
tional options below. These
options, referred to as brush
dynamics, change while you
apply your stroke. See Fig-
ure 12-5 for an example of each.
• Spacing: The higher the
number, the more space
between marks.
• Fade: The lower the value,
the quicker the stroke
fades. Zero, however, 
creates no fade.
• Hue Jitter: Varies the
stroke between the fore-
ground and background
colors. The higher the
value, the more frequent the variation.
• Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.
• Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush
marks and the farther apart they are.
• Angle: If you have created an oval brush by adjusting the round-
ness (see the next bullet), this option controls the angle of that
oval brush stroke. It’s so much easier to drag the points and the

arrow on the diagram rather than guesstimating values in the text
boxes.
• Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower
the percentage, the more oval your brush becomes. 
• Keep These Settings for All Brushes: You can lock in these brush
dynamics by checking this option. This ensures that every brush
you choose adopts these settings. 
Like the Pencil tool, additional features for the Brush tool appear under the
pop-up menu on the Brush Preset Picker drop-down palette. Here’s a quick
description of each:
 Save Brush: This command allows you to save a custom brush as a
preset. See “Creating your own brush” for details.
 Rename Brush: Don’t like your brush’s moniker? Change it with this
option.
 Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library back to the default.
 Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library. 
 Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library.
 The display options: This isn’t a single command but rather a set of
commands that enable you to change the way your brush tips are dis-
played. These commands include Text Only and Small Thumbnail. 
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See
Chapter 2 for information on using the Preset Manager.
Creating your own brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the Franken-
brush that you have created, feel free to save it as a preset that you can
access again in the future. Choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu on the
Brush Preset Picker palette. Name the Brush and click OK. Your new custom
brush will show up at the bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down
palette.
There is one additional way to create a brush. Elements allows you to create
a brush from all or part of your image. The image could be a photograph or it
could be something you have painted or drawn.
261
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
1. Select part of your image with any of the selection tools. If you want
to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
2. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
3. Name the brush and click OK.
The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker
drop-down palette. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color
you have selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 12-6.

Using the Impressionist Brush
In this section, we introduce the Impressionist Brush. This tool is designed to
paint over your photos in a way that makes it look like a fine art painting. You
can set various options that change the style of the brush strokes.
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:

1. Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools palette.
It looks like a brush with a curly q next to it.
2. Set your brush options. 
The Brushes, Size, Mode, and Opacity options are identical to those
found with the Brush tool, described in “Painting with the Brush tool,”
earlier in this chapter. You can
also find some unique options
in the More Options palette:
• Style: This drop-down list
contains various brush
stroke styles, such as dab
and tight curl.
• Area: Controls the size 
of your brush stroke. The
larger the value, the larger
the area covered.
• Tolerance: Controls how
similar color pixels have
to be before they are
changed by the brush
stroke.
3. Drag on your image and paint
with your brush strokes, as
shown in Figure 12-7.
The best way to get a feel 
for what this tool does is to
open your favorite image, grab
the tool, and take it for a test
drive.
Filling and Outlining Selections
There may be times when you want to create an element on your canvas that
can’t quite be created with a brush or pencil stroke. Maybe it’s a perfect
circle or five-pointed star. Elements offers a couple of other ways to create
these objects. If you have a selection, you can fill or stroke that selection to
create that element, rather than drawing or painting it on. The Fill command
adds a color or a pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke com-
mand applies the color to the edge of the selection border only.

Fill ’er up
You won’t find a Fill tool in the Tools palette. Elements decided to avoid the
overpopulated palette and placed the Fill and Stroke commands under the
Edit menu. Here are the simple steps to fill a selection:
1. Grab the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on a
new layer. 
Although it isn’t mandatory that you create a new layer to make a selec-
tion to fill, we recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the filled selection,
you can delete the layer, and your image or background below it remains
safe. See Chapter 7 for more on selections and Chapter 9 for details on
working with layers.
2. Select either the foreground or background color and then choose a
fill color.
See “Choosing Color,” earlier in this chapter, if you need a refresher.
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
The Fill Layer dialog box, shown in Figure 12-8, appears.
Figure 12-8: Fill your selection or layer with color or a pattern.
If you want to bypass the Fill dialog box (and the rest of these steps),
you can use these handy keyboard shortcuts instead: 
• To fill it with the foreground color, press Alt+Backspace.
• To fill the selection with the background color, press
Ctrl+Backspace.
4. Choose your desired fill from the Use pop-up menu.
You can select whether to fill with the foreground or background color.
You also can choose Color, Black, 50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If you

select Color, you are transported to the Color Picker. If you choose
Pattern, you must then choose a Pattern from the Custom Pattern 
drop-down palette. For more on patterns, see the upcoming section.
If you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the command
will say Fill Layer, and your entire layer will be filled with your color or
pattern.
5. In the blending area, you can choose whether to Preserve Transparency,
which enables you to fill the whole selection or only portions of the
selection that contain pixels (the nontransparent areas). 
Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts
with colors below it) and opacity percentage, we urge you not to adjust
your blend mode and opacity in the Fill Layer dialog box. Make those
adjustments on your layer later via the Layer palette commands, where
you have more flexibility for editing.
6. Click OK.
The color or pattern fills the selection.
Outlining with the Stroke command
Stroking a selection enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of
selections or layers. You can put this border inside, outside, or centered on
the selection order. 
Here are the steps to stroke a selection:
1. Choose a foreground color and make a selection.
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
The Stroke dialog box opens.
3. Select your desired settings.
Many settings are the same as those found in the Fill dialog box,
explained in the preceding section. Here is a
brief rundown of those options unique to
strokes:
• Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels
for the stroke.
• Location: Specify how Elements should
apply the stroke: outside the selection,
inside the selection, or centered on the
selection. 
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
I gave a 30-pixel centered stroke to my selec-
tion, shown in Figure 12-9.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Splashing On Color with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool has been a long-time occu-
pant of the Tools palette. This tool, whose icon
looks just like a bucket, behaves like a combina-
tion of the Fill command and the Magic Wand
tool. This means that it makes a selection based
on similarly colored pixels and then immediately
fills that selection with color or a pattern. Just
like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is the most
successful when you have a limited number of
colors, as shown in Figure 12-10.
To use the Paint Bucket tool, simply click inside
the selection you want to fill. Before you click,
however, specify your options:
 Fill: Choose between a fill of the foreground
color or a pattern.
 Pattern: If you choose pattern, select a
preset pattern from the drop-down palette.
For more details on patterns, see the upcoming section.
 Mode: Select a blending mode to change how your fill color interacts
with the color below it.
 Opacity: Adjust the opacity to make your fill more or less transparent.
 Tolerance: Choose a tolerance level that specifies how similar in color a
pixel must be before it is selected and then filled. The lower the value,
the more similar the color must be. For more on tolerance, see the sec-
tion on the Magic Wand in Chapter 7. 
 Anti-alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled
and unfilled areas. 
 Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are
touching within your selection. If unselected, pixels will be selected and
filled wherever they lie within your image.
 All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels in all layers that are within
your tolerance level.
Working with Multi-Colored Gradients
If one color isn’t enough for you, you’ll be pleased to know that Elements
enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is a blend 
of two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one to another. Elements
provides a whole slew of various preset gradients. But creating your own
custom gradient is also fun and easy.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-10: The Paint Bucket
tool makes a selection and fills
it at the same time.

Applying a preset gradient
Similar to colors, patterns, and brushes, gradients have a whole slew of pre-
sets that you can apply to your selection and layers. You can also load other
libraries of gradients from the Gradient palette pop-up menu. 
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
1. Make the selection you want to fill with a gradient. 
We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can edit
the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer
or background.
2. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette or press the G key.
3. In the Options bar, click the downward-pointing arrow in the
Gradient Picker drop-down palette and choose a preset gradient.
Remember, you can choose other preset libraries from the palette pop-
up menu. Libraries like Color Harmonies and Metals contain interesting
presets.
4. Next, choose your desired gradient
type by clicking one of the icons.
See Figure 12-11 for an example of
each type.
5. Choose from the following addi-
tional options on the Options bar:
• Mode: Choose a blending mode
to change how the color of the
gradient interacts with the
colors below it.
• Opacity: Choose how opaque or
transparent the gradient is.
• Reverse: Reverse the order in
which the colors are applied.
• Dither: Add noise, or random
information, to produce a
smoother gradient that prints
with less banding (weird stripes
due to the printing limitations).
• Transparency: Deselect this
option and Elements ignores
any transparent areas in the
gradient and makes them
opaque instead.

6. Position your gradient cursor at your desired starting point within
your selection or layer.
7. Drag in any direction to your desired end point for the gradient.
Longer drags result in a subtler transition between colors, whereas
shorter drags result in a more abrupt transition. Hold down the Shift key
to restrain the direction of the gradient to a 45-degree angle.
8. Release the mouse button to apply the gradient.
We applied an Orange Yellow radial gradient from the Color Harmonies 2
preset library to a selection of a sun in Figure 12-12. We selected the
Reverse option and dragged from the center of the sun to the tip of the
top ray.
Figure 12-12: We filled our sun selection with a radial Orange 
Yellow gradient.
Customizing gradients
If you can’t find the exact gradient you need, you can easily create your own.
The Gradient Editor lets you create your own custom gradient, using as many
colors as you want. After you create a custom gradient, you can save it as a
preset to reuse in the future. 

Follow these steps to create a custom gradient:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
2. Click the Edit button in the Options bar.
The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, shown in Figure 12-13.
3. Pick an existing preset to use as the basis for your new gradient.
Figure 12-13: Use the Gradient Editor to edit and customize gradients.
4. Choose your Gradient Type, either Solid or Noise, from the 
pop-up menu.
A Noise gradient contains random colors. Interestingly, each time you
create a Noise gradient, the result is different. 
Note that as soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of
the gradient changes to Custom.

5. Choose your options for either a Solid or Noise gradient, depending
on what you chose in Step 4.
• If you chose Solid: Adjust the Smoothness percentage to deter-
mine how smoothly one color blends into another.
• If you chose Noise: You can choose which Color Model to use to
set the color range. You can also adjust the Roughness, which
affects how smoothly or abruptly the color transitions from one to
another. Click Restrict Colors to avoid oversaturated colors. The
Add Transparency option adds transparency to random colors.
Click the Randomize button to randomly generate a new gradient.
You can then skip down to Step 15 to finish your gradient-making
process.
6. If you are creating a Solid gradient, begin choosing the first color of
your gradient by first clicking the left color stop under the gradient
bar, shown in Figure 12-13.
The triangle on top of the stop turns black to indicate you are working
with the starting point of the gradient. 
7. Then, choose the starting color by double-clicking the left color stop
and selecting a color from the Color Picker.
In the Stops area, you can also click the Color Swatch or choose Fore-
ground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up menu. If you
select color with the Foreground or Background option when you change
either of those colors, the color in the gradient changes automatically
for gradients you make. However, when you open the Gradient Editor
again, you can revert to your original foreground or background color by
selecting the User Color option.
8. Select the ending color by clicking the right color stop. Repeat Step 7
to define the color.
9. Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other by
moving the starting or ending point’s color stop to the left or right.
Drag the midpoint slider (a diamond icon) to adjust where the colors
mix equally, 50-50.
You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value into
the Location box.
10. To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the position 
you want to add the color. Define a color in the same way you did
in Step 7.
11. Repeat Step 10 to add additional colors.
12. To add transparency to your gradient, select an opacity stop, shown 
in Figure 12-13, and adjust the Opacity slider to specify the amount of
transparency you desire.

By default, a gradient has colors that are 100 percent opaque. You can
fade a gradient to transparency so that the portion of the image under
the gradient shows through. 
You can also add additional opacity stops in the same way you add color
stops.
13. Adjust your color and opacity stops and their midpoint sliders to vary
the percentages of each color.
14. You can also redefine any of the colors. To delete a color stop, drag it
up or down off of the gradient bar.
15. When you’re done, name your gradient and click the New button.
Your gradient is added to the Presets menu. 
After all that work, you may want to consider saving your gradients for later
use. To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog
box. Save the current presets, with your new gradient, under the current
library’s name or a new name altogether. You can then later load that preset
library. You can also manage your gradient presets with the Preset Manager,
explained in Chapter 2.
Working with Patterns
If you’ve ever seen someone wearing leopard-print pants with an argyle
sweater and a plaid blazer, then you’re familiar with patterns. Not always
pretty when used without restraint, patterns can be used to occasionally fill
selections or layers. You can also stamp your image by using the Pattern
Stamp tool. You can even retouch by using a pattern with the Healing Brush
tool. Elements offers lots of preset patterns to keep you happy. And if you’re
not, you can, of course, create your own.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset
pattern, follow these steps.
1. Choose the layer or selection you want to fill with a pattern.
Again, we recommend making your selection on a new layer above your
image for more flexible editing later on.
2. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or Fill Layer and select Pattern from the
Use pop-up menu.
271
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

272
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
3. Click the downward-pointing arrow and select a pattern from the
Custom Pattern drop-down palette, as shown in Figure 12-14.
If you don’t see a pattern to your liking, choose another preset library
by clicking the palette pop-up menu and selecting another preset library
at the bottom of the sub-menu. 
Figure 12-14: Fill your selection with one of Elements’ many preset 
patterns.
4. Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode,
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
For details on these options, see the section “Filling and Outlining
Selections,” earlier in this chapter.
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Creating a new pattern
You may someday want to create your own pattern. Patterns can be easily
created from any existing photo or painting you’ve created in Elements. You
can even scan your signature or logo, define it as a pattern, and use it with
the Pattern Stamp tool to sign all your work. 
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
1. Open the photographic, painted, or scanned image that contains the
area you want to use as a pattern.

2. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern. Make sure that your Feather option is set to 0.
If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire layer as a basis
for the pattern.
3. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
4. Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box.
Your new pattern will now appear in every Pattern palette, wherever it
may lurk in Elements.
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can also stamp on a
pattern with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Chapter 9.
Creating Shapes of All Sorts
In this section, we leave the land of pixels and head into uncharted territory —
Vectorville. Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a
little overview that explains the difference between pixels and vectors:
 Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to
look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing
pixel-based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Chapter 3.
 Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are
math-based, you can resize them without any loss of quality whatsoever.
In Figure 12-15, you can see both types of images.
Figure 12-15: Elements images can be vector-based (left) or 
pixel-based (right).
273
Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting

274
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
When you create a shape in Elements, you are creating a vector-based ele-
ment. Shapes reside on a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a
shape layer. Use shapes to create simple logos, Web buttons, and other
small spot illustrations.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for you to choose from. Follow
these steps to draw a shape in your document:
1. Choose your desired shape tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the U key and choose the shape tool from the Options
bar. All the following tools have associated geometry options, which are
described in an upcoming section. Here are the tools that are available:
• Rectangle and Ellipse: Like their Marquee counterparts, you can
hold down the Shift key while dragging to produce a square or
circle; hold down the Alt key to draw the shape from the center
outward. 
• Rounded Rectangle: Works like the regular Rectangle but with 
the addition of a radius value used to round off the corners of the
rectangle.
• Polygon: Creates a polygon with a specified number of sides, from
3 to 100. 
• Line: Draw a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You can also
add arrowheads at either end.
• Custom: The most varied shape tool of all. You have numerous
preset custom shapes to choose from. As with any shape, hold
down Shift to constrain proportions or Alt to draw from the 
center out. 
2. Select your desired color from the Color drop-down palette in the
Options bar.
Click the More Colors button to access the Color Picker for additional
color choices.
3. Select a style from the Style drop-down palette.
To jazz up the shape with bevels and other fancy edges, choose a style
from the palette. For more on styles, see Chapter 11.
4. Click the downward-pointing arrow just to the right of the Shape tools
to specify your geometry options.

For detailed explanations on the various geometry options, see the
upcoming sections.
If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the downward-
pointing arrow to access the drop-down
shapes palette and choose your desired
shape. You can access more preset shape
libraries via the pop-up menu at the top of
the palette.
5. Drag in the document to draw the shape
you’ve defined.
The shape appears in the image window on
its own shape layer. Check out the Layers
palette to see this phenomenon. Figure 12-16
shows our shape, a Japanese hairstyle, which
we add to in the next section.
Drawing multiple shapes
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes to that layer.
You can add, subtract, overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way
you do with selections (see Chapter 7). Just follow these steps:
1. Select your desired state button in the Options bar. You can choose
from the following options:
• New Shape Layer: Creates your initial shape layer.
• Add to shape area: Combines and joins
two or more shapes.
• Subtract from shape area: Subtracts
one shape from another shape.
• Intersect shape areas: Creates a shape
only from the areas that overlap.
• Exclude overlapping shape areas:
Creates a shape only from the areas
that do not overlap.
2. Choose your desired Shape tool and draw
the next shape.
I completed my shape by adding the face,
shown in Figure 12-17.

Specifying geometry options
Geometry options help define how your shapes look. Click the downward-
pointing arrow on the Options bar to access the geometry options described
in the sections that follow.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the rectangle and rounded rectangle
shapes:
 Unconstrained: Enables you to have free reign to draw a rectangle at any
size or shape.
 Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square. 
 Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles in fixed sizes, as specified by your
width and height values. 
 Proportional: Allows you to define a proportion for the rectangle. For
example, specifying 2W and 1H makes a rectangle twice as wide as it 
is high.
 From Center: Enables you to draw from the center out.
 Snap to Pixels: Aligns the shape to the pixels on your screen.
 Radius: For Rounded Rectangles, you can enter the radius of a circle
used to round off the corners.
Ellipse geometry options
The ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles except
for the Snap to Pixels option. The only differences are instead of being able to
create a perfect square, you can create a perfect circle. 
Polygon geometry options
The geometry options for the Polygon shape are as follows:
 Radius: Enter the radius of a circle used to round off the corners of a
polygon when you have the Smooth Corners option selected.
 Smooth Corners: Round off the corners.
 Star: Creates an inward-pointing polygon called a star.
 Indent Sides By: Determines the amount the sides indent inward.
 Smooth Indents: Rounds off the inner corners of indented sides.
 Sides: Specifies the number of sides for your polygon or the number of
points for your star.

Line geometry options
The line’s geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start
and/or end of the line. You can also adjust the width, length, and concavity
settings to change the arrowhead shapes.
Custom shape geometry options
The custom shape options are similar to those you find for the other shapes,
but with a couple unique options: 
 Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions
you used when you created it.
 Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you 
created it.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes you create by using a variety of tools and techniques.
Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
 Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in
their layers. This tool shares a flyout menu with the Shapes tools.
 Move: Choose the Move tool (press V) to move the entire contents of
the shape layer.
 Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
 Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and choose your desired 
transformation.
 Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer in the
Layers palette. This transports you to the Color Picker, where you can
choose a new color.
 Clone a shape: Press Alt and move the shape with the Move tool.
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the
Simplify button in the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note that
you cannot edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels.

lthough we’ve spouted on about how a picture says a thousand words,
we’d be terribly negligent if we didn’t at least give a nod to the power 
of the written word as well. You may find that you never need to go near
the type tools. That’s fine. We won’t be offended if you skip right
past this chapter. 
But then again, you may have an occasional need to add
a caption or headline or maybe even a short para-
graph to an image. Although it is by no means a
word-processing or even page-layout program,
Elements does give you ample tools for creating,
editing, stylizing, and even distorting type.
Understanding Type Basics
Elements has four type tools. Two of them are for entering
horizontally oriented type, and two are for entering verti-
cally oriented type. Don’t worry about the vertical type tools.
Although you can use them, they are really designed for the Asian

280
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
market, to enter Chinese and Japanese characters. The horizontal and ver-
tical type tools are identical in their attributes, so we just cover the two 
horizontal type tools from here on, and, for the sake of simplicity, we just
call them the Type and Type Mask tools:
 Type tool: Use this tool to enter type. This type is created on its own
type layer except when used in Bitmap or Indexed Color modes, which
don’t support layers.
We refer to layers a lot in this chapter, so if your layer knowledge is
rusty, check out Chapter 9.
 Type Mask tool: This tool does not create actual type; instead, it creates
a selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selec-
tion border is added to the currently active layer. You can do anything
with a type selection that you can do with any other selection.
We also talk more about selections in this chapter, so for more details on
selections, see Chapter 7.
You can enter text in Elements in two different modes: point type and para-
graph type. Both the Type and Type Mask tools can enter either. Here is a
brief description of each. For the step-by-step process of creating the text,
see the following sections.
 Point type: Use this mode if all you want to enter is a few words or so.
To create point type, select the Type tool, click in your image, and . . .
well . . . type. The text appears as you type and continues to grow. In
fact, it will even continue past the boundary of your image! Remember
that point type never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next
line, you must press Enter.
 Paragraph type: Use this mode to enter longer chunks of text on an
image. To create paragraph type, click and drag your type tool to create
a text bounding box and then type. All the text is entered in this resizable
bounding box. If a line of text is too long, Elements automatically wraps
it around to the next line.
Elements is capable of displaying and printing type in two different formats.
Each format has its pros and cons, and which format you use depends on
your needs. Here’s the lowdown on each format:
 Vector type: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. Vector
type provides scalable outlines that you can resize without producing
jaggy edges in the diagonal strokes. Vector type remains fully editable
and always prints with optimum quality, appearing crisp and clean.
Vector type is the default type format in Elements.

 Raster type: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, the text 
is rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying.
When text is simplified, it is no longer editable but is converted into a
graphic image. You usually simplify your vector type when you want to
apply filters to the type to produce a special effect or when you want
to merge the type with the image. You can’t resize simplified type with-
out losing some quality or risking jagged edges. For more details, see
“Simplifying Type,” later in this chapter.
Creating Point Type
The majority of your type entry will most likely be in point type mode. Point
type is great for short chunks of text like headlines, labels, logos, and head-
ings for Web pages.
Point type is so called because it is preceded by a single anchor point.
Remember, point type lines don’t wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1: Point type doesn’t wrap automatically, but instead can run off your image into a
type neverland.
Follow these steps to create point type:
1. Open an image or create a new blank Elements document.
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette.
You can also press the T key.
3. On the image, click where you want to insert your text.
Your cursor is called an I-beam. When you click, you make an insertion
point.
A small horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows
the baseline (the line on which the text sits) for horizontal type.
281
Chapter 13: Working with Type

282
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
All the options are described in detail in the section, “Specifying Type
Options,” later in this chapter. 
5. Type your text. Press Enter to begin a new line.
When you press Enter, you insert a hard return that doesn’t move.
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit button (check
icon) on the Options bar.
You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad
or by clicking any other tool in the Tools palette. A new type layer with
your text is created. Type layers appear in your Layers palette and are
indicated by the T icon.
Creating Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, it is more practical to enter the text as 
paragraph type. Entering paragraph type is similar to entering text in a 
word-processing or page-layout program, except that it’s contained inside
a bounding box. As you type and come to the end of the bounding box,
Elements automatically wraps the text to the next line.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
1. Open an image or create a new blank Elements document.
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette or press the T key.
3. On the image, insert and size the bounding box by using one of two
methods:
• Drag to create a bounding box close to your desired size. After you
release the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the
corners and sides of the box to resize the box.
• Hold down the Alt key and click the image. The Paragraph Text
Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact dimensions of your
desired bounding box. When you click OK, your specified box
appears, complete with handles for resizing later, if necessary.
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
Options are described in detail in the “Specifying Type Options” section,
later in this chapter.

5. Enter your text. To start a new paragraph, press Enter.
Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as you can see in
Figure 13-2.
If you type more text than can squeeze into the text box, an overflow
icon appears. Just resize the text box by dragging any of the bounding
box handles.
6. Click the Commit button (check icon) on the Options bar or press
Enter on the numeric keypad.
Elements creates a new type layer.
Figure 13-2: Paragraph type automatically wraps to fit within your bounding box.
Specifying Type Options
You can find several character and paragraph type settings in the Options
bar, shown in Figure 13-3. Although you don’t have some of the more special-
ized options, such as small caps and superscript, you do have access to the
most commonly used options, and they should be more than sufficient if all
you want to do is pair a small amount of type with your images.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Figure 13-3: Specify your type options, such as font family and size, before you type.
Here is an explanation of each available option on the Options bar, from left
to right:
 Type tools: You can choose your flavor of type tool from the Options bar
as well as from the Tools palette.
 Font family: Select the font you want from the drop-down list. Elements 4.0
provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) font menu. After
each font name, the word Sample is rendered in the actual font — no more
choosing a font without knowing what it really looks like. You also find
one of these abbreviations before each font name to let you know what
type of font it is: 
• a for Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
• TT for TrueType fonts
• O for OpenType fonts
• Those with no abbreviation are Bitmapped fonts.

 Font style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or
condensed. Only the styles available for a particular font appear in the
list. This is also now a WYSIWYG menu.
 Font size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a
size in the text box. Note that type size is most commonly measured in
points (72 points equals about 1 inch at a resolution of 72 ppi). You can
switch to millimeters or pixels by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and
Rulers.
 Anti-aliasing: Select Anti-aliasing to slightly smooth out the edges of
your text. Anti-aliasing softens that edge by 1 pixel, as shown in Fig-
ure 13-4. For the most part, you want to keep this option on. The one
occasion in which you may want it off is when you are creating small
type to be displayed on-screen, such as on Web pages. The soft edges
can sometimes be tough to read easily.
 Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold
style (which you would choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be warned
that although the sky won’t fall, applying faux styles can distort the pro-
portions of a font. It’s best to use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t
exist, oh well.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same
warning as the Faux Bold option.
 Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
 Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to 
your text.
 Text alignment: These three options align your horizontal text on the
left, center, or right. If you happen to have vertical text, these options
rotate 90 degrees clockwise and change into Top, Center Vertical, and
Bottom settings.
 Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space between
the baselines of lines of type. A baseline is the imaginary line on which a
line of type sits. You can choose Auto Leading or you can specify the
amount of leading to apply. When you choose Auto Leading, Elements
uses a value of 120 percent of your type point size. Therefore, 10-point
type gets 12 points of leading. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so
that the bottoms of the lowest letters don’t crash into the tops of the
tallest letters on the line below them.
 Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches palette.
 Style: Click this option to access a drop-down palette of preset styles
that you can apply to your type. For more on this option and the next
one, see “Stylizing and Warping Type,” later in this chapter.
 Create Warped Text: This fun option lets you distort type in more than a
dozen ways.
 Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer and then click this
option to switch between vertical and horizontal type orientations. 
 Cancel: Click this button (or press Esc) to cancel the type from being
entered. You only use this option, and the Commit option, after you have
clicked the type tool on your canvas.
 Commit: Click this button to apply the type onto your canvas.
Editing Text
Now that we’ve slogged through all the available options for type in Elements,
just remember that you can apply these settings before you enter your text or
after. To correct typos, add and delete type, or change any of the type options,
simply follow these steps:

1. Select the Type tool from the Tools palette.
2. Select your desired type layer in the Layers palette or click within the
text to automatically select the type layer.
3. Do one of the following:
• To change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you
want to change all the text, simply select that type layer in the
Layers palette. To select only portions of the text, highlight the
text by dragging across it with the I-beam of the Type tool. 
• To delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the 
I-beam of the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key.
• To add text: Make an insertion point by clicking your I-beam within
the line of text. Then type your new text.
4. When you’re done editing your text, click the Commit button.
You may also occasionally need to transform your text. To do so, make sure the
type layer is selected in the Layers palette. Then choose Image➪Transform➪
Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and drag to rotate or scale.
Press Ctrl and drag a handle to distort. When you’re done, double-click inside
the bounding box to commit the transformation. For more details on transfor-
mations, see Chapter 9.
Simplifying Type
As we explain way back in the section “Understanding Type Basics,” Elements
can display and print type in two different formats — vector and raster.
Remember that as long as you keep type in a vector format in a type layer, you
can edit and resize that type all day long.
Occasionally, however, you may find the need to simplify your type — to con-
vert your type into pixels. After they’re simplified, you can apply filters, paint
on the type, and apply gradients and patterns. If you’re working with layers
and you flatten your image (merge your layers into a single background image),
your type layer is also simplified and merged with the other pixels in your
image. By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a type layer, Elements barks at
you that the type layer must be simplified before proceeding and gives you
the opportunity to click OK (if you want to simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the type layer in the Layers palette and choose
Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your type layer is then converted (the T icon disappears)
287
Chapter 13: Working with Type

288
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
into a regular layer on which your type
is now pixels against a transparent
background, as shown in Figure 13-5. 
To avoid re-creating your type from
scratch, be sure to make all your nec-
essary edits prior to simplifying. This
includes sizing your text. After you sim-
plify your type, you cannot resize your
text without risking the dreaded jag-
gies. The other down side to remember
about simplified type is that, although
it looks identical to vector type on-
screen, it will never print as crisply and
cleanly as vector type. Even at higher
resolution settings, there will always be
a slight jagged edge to simplified type.
So if you’re experimenting with paint-
ing or filters on your type, just make a
duplicate of your type layer prior to
simplifying it and then hide that layer.
Masking with Type
Using the Type Mask tool epitomizes the combination of type and image.
Unlike its conventional cousin, the Type Mask tool doesn’t create a new layer.
Instead, it creates a selection on the currently active layer. This is the tool of
choice for filling text with an image or cutting text out of an image so the
background shows through, as shown in Figure 13-6. 
Remember, a selection is a selection, no matter how it was created. So even
though they look like letters, they act like selections. You can move, modify,
and save them.
Here are the steps to create a type mask:
1. Open the image of your choice.
We selected a stone texture.
2. Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word
Background in the Layers palette. Click OK.
This enables us to jazz up the type with styles later on.

3. Choose the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools palette and then
click on the image where you would like your text.
4. Specify your type options, such as font family, style, and size, in the
Options bar.
5. Type your desired text, and when you’re done, click the Commit
button on the Options bar.
A selection border in the shape of your type appears on your image.
6. Choose Select➪Inverse, which deselects your letter selections and
selects everything else.
7. Press the Backspace key to delete everything outside your selection
border.
Your type is now filled with your image.
8. Choose Select➪Deselect.
9. Experiment with applying Layer Styles to your type.
If the Layer Styles palette isn’t visible, choose Window➪Styles and Effects.
Choose Layer Styles from the drop-down list in the palette. Choose 
the style of your choice. We used a drop shadow and inner bevel in Fig-
ure 13-7. You can find more details about Layer Styles in Chapter 11.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 13-7: Fill type with imagery by using the Type Mask tool.
If you want to admire your type against a solid background, as we did,
create a new layer and then choose Edit➪Fill Layer and choose your
desired color from the Use pop-up menu.

Stylizing and Warping Type
If you tried your hand at creating a type mask in the preceding section, you
know that Elements is capable of much more than just throwing a few black
letters at the bottom of your image. With a few clicks here and there, you can
warp, distort, enhance, and stylize your type. If you’re not careful, your cre-
ative typography could outshine your image.
Adjusting type opacity
If you checked out Chapter 9 before you came here, you know that layers are
a digital version of the old analog transparency sheets. You can change the
opacity of elements on layers to enable the underlying layer to show through
in varying degrees. This is also possible on a type layer. Peek at Figure 13-8 to
see how varying the percentage of opacity of our type layer makes more of
the underlying layer of water show through. 
To change the opacity of a type layer, simply select the layer in the Layers
palette, click the arrow to the right of the Opacity setting, and drag the slider.
The lower the percentage, the less opaque the type (and the more the under-
lying layer shows through).

the underlying layer to peek through.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Applying filters to your type
One of the most interesting things you can do with type in Elements that you
can’t do in a word-processing or page-layout program is apply special effects,
such as filters. You can make type look like it’s on fire, underwater, or on the
move, as shown in Figure 13-9, where we’ve applied a motion blur. The only
caveat, as we mention earlier, is that type has to be simplified first before a
filter can be applied. So be sure you do all your text editing before you get to
the filtering stage. Actually applying the filter is as easy as just selecting the
simplified type layer in the Layers palette and selecting a filter from the Filter
menu. For more on filters, see Chapter 11.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 13-9: Applying a Motion Blur to type can make it appear as fast as the car.
Painting your type with color and gradients
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and choosing a color
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more
unconventional, like apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the type,
like we did in the first image in Figure 13-10? It’s really easier than it looks.
Again, like with applying filters to text, the only criterion is that the type has
to be simplified first. After that’s done, choose a color, grab the Brush tool
with settings of your choice, and paint. In our example, we used the Granite
Flow brush found under the Special Effect Brushes presets. We used a diame-
ter of 39, 15, and 6 pixels and just swiped our type a few times.

Figure 13-10: Bring your type to life with color (left) or a gradient (right).
If you want the color or gradient to be confined to the type area only, you can
either select the text by Ctrl+clicking the layer containing the text or by lock-
ing the transparency of the layer in the Layers palette.
You can also apply a gradient to your type. Here are the steps to follow after
simplifying your type:
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools palette.
2. In the Options bar, click the downward-pointing arrow next to the
Gradient Picker to access the Gradient Picker drop-down palette.
3. Choose your desired gradient.
If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Chapter 12.
4. Position your gradient cursor on the text where you want your gradi-
ent to start and drag to where you want your gradient to end.
Don’t like the results? Drag again until you get the look you want.
Remember, you can drag at any angle and to any length, even outside
your type. In the second image in Figure 13-10, we used the copper 
gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the bottom.
Warping your type
If horizontal or vertical text is just way too regimented for you, try out some
of the distortions you can apply to your type with the Warp feature. The best
part about the distortions you apply to the type is that the text remains fully
editable. This feature is fun and easy to use. Click the Create Warped Text
button at the far left of the Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line under it.)
This opens the Warp Text dialog box, where you’ll find a vast array of distor-
tions under the Style pop-up menu with descriptive names like Bulge, Inflate,
and Squeeze.
293
Chapter 13: Working with Type

294
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
After choosing a warp style, you can adjust the orientation, amount of bend,
and degree of distortion by dragging the sliders. The Bend setting affects the
amount of warp and the Horizontal and Vertical Distortions apply perspective
to that warp. Luckily, you can also view the results as you adjust. We could
give you technical explanations of these adjustments, but really the best way
to see what they do is to just play with them. See Figure 13-11 to get a quick
look at a few of the warp styles. The names speak for themselves.

In this part . . .
I
f you learn much of what is contained in the
ﬁrst four parts of this book, this last part ﬁn-
ishes up with photo output and deployment. As is
the case with so many other editing features, you
have an abundance of opportunities for outputting
your ﬁles. Beginning with the most familiar, which
is simply printing to your desktop color printer,
we talk about how to get the best results on your
printed images. We start with printing to your per-
sonal desktop printer and then cover issues related
to submitting photos to commercial photo labs
and service centers.
In addition to printing, you have a number of dif-
ferent options for sharing images, and these are
all covered in the ﬁnal chapters, where you ﬁnd
out about slide shows, videodiscs, Web hosting, 
e-mailing, and sharing via online services. The
opportunities are enormous, and you’ll want to
look over all Photoshop Elements has to offer
related to photo output and ﬁle sharing.

P
erhaps the greatest challenge to individuals using programs like Photo-
shop Elements, and even the professionals who use its granddaddy
Adobe Photoshop, is getting what you see on your monitor to render a rea-
sonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books on color
printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your equipment, and how
to create and use color profiles — all for the purpose of getting a
good match between your computer monitor and your printer.
It’s downright discouraging to spend a lot of time tweaking
an image so that all the brilliant blue colors jump out of
your computer monitor only to find that all those blues
turn to murky purples when the photo is printed.
If you’ve already read Chapters 2 and 3, you’re
ahead of the game because you know a little bit
about color management, color profiles, and printer
resolutions. After you check out those chapters,
your next step is to get to know your printer or your
print service center and understand how to correctly
print your pictures.
To reliably print files on your personal desktop printer or
on commercial printing machines at service centers, there is
no magic formula we can give you. If you want to produce the cor-
rect print the first time and every time, you need to prepare yourself for test-
ing, testing, and more testing. If you’re satisfied with much less, then you can
visit the print dialog box, click a few buttons, and be done with it. But if you

298
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
take the time to look over some of the options we talk about in this chapter
and run some tests, you can be certain that your final printed images will look
much better than if you had just pushed a few buttons in the Print dialog box.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many options — for setting print
attributes for printing to your own color printer, and we toss in some tips 
on how to get better results when using print service centers. If you need to,
reread this chapter a few times just to be certain you understand the process
for printing good-quality images. A little time spent here will hopefully save
you some headaches down the road.
Setting Up Your Printer
Setting up your printer is your first step toward good-looking printouts. To
set up your printer within Elements, you need to complete a few tasks before
you ever launch the program:
 Hook up your desktop color printer to your computer and turn it on.
 Make sure the computer sees the printer. To be sure, open the Printers
and Faxes area of Windows and see if your printer appears. If not, click
Add a Printer and follow the wizard.
 Remove the shrink-wrap from the printer’s user manual and browse
through it. 
 If you have it, install your printer software on your computer. 
With all these bases covered, you’re ready to set up your printer in Elements.
Just follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Print or press Ctrl+P. 
The Print dialog box opens. We
talk about that dialog box a little
later. 
2. For now, click the Page Setup
button. 
3. Click the Printer button. 
When you do, another Page
Setup dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 14-1. You use
this Page Setup dialog box to
select your printer. 
Figure 14-1: Click Printer in the Page Setup
dialog box to open another Page Setup dialog
box where you can select your target printer.

4. Look for your printer in the Name drop-down list and select the printer
you intend to print your files to. Click OK when you’re done.
If you have only one printer installed on your computer, you may see
only one choice in the Name drop-down menu. If you don’t see your
printer, you need to go back to the printer installation guide and retrace
the steps required to setup your printer. 
Printing from the Organizer
Although you can print files from the Organizer or the editing modes, we rec-
ommend you stick with the Organizer. Wherever you print, you can access
all the print options, but in the Organizer, the options are easier to navigate:
You can easily select one or more files to print and simply follow the steps. 
In addition to setting all the print options for printing a photo, you need to
prepare your images properly before printing. With all your options, it’s easy
to get confused and not know where to start. What you need is a procedure
to follow consistently each time you want to print your photos to your desk-
top printer. Here’s a procedure we recommend you follow when printing
photos:
1. Set your color management preferences to Adobe RGB (1998).
2. Edit your photos.
3. Save your edits.
4. Click the Photo Browser button to switch to the Organizer.
5. Tag images for printing.
6. Select the files you want to print.
7. Choose File➪Print in the Organizer.
8. Click Page Setup and select your page setup options.
9. Set your print options in the Print Selected Files dialog box.
10. Click More Options to select the correct color profile, among other
options.
11. Click Print in the Print Selected Files dialog box.
In the sections that follow, we introduce the interface and break down these
steps to explain each in detail. Refer back to this section every time you print
to make sure you don’t miss a step. Doing so will help you get stellar-looking
prints every time — and avoid wasting expensive photo paper.

Checking out Elements’ print shop
Elements offers so many options for printing, it’s like having a mini print shop
that you operate from your computer (although the pros obviously can do a lot
more than a consumer inkjet printer can). If you select one or more files and
choose File➪Print in the Organizer, the Print Selected Files dialog box pops
onto the screen, looking something like Figure 14-2. Before you get started
printing, here are some basics to help familiarize you with this dialog box:
 Image thumbnails: The left pane shows thumbnail images of the photos
selected for printing.
 Scroll selected images: Click the left and right arrows to scroll the
selected photos and see print previews in the Print Preview area. Note
that changing the Print Preview can only be accomplished by clicking
the arrows. Selecting thumbnails in the Image thumbnails pane won’t
change the Print Preview.
Figure 14-2: Open the Organizer and select one or more files. Choose File➪Print to open the
Print Selected Files dialog box.

 Paper size: Below the arrows, you see the current selected paper size.
 Print preview: The window shows you how your photo will print on the

Stepping through a print job with Print Selected Files
You have your images loaded into Elements and are ready to get them on
paper. As we mention earlier in this chapter, this is the section that breaks
down the standard procedure for printing into all the details. Read through
the following sections to find out what you need to know to print your
photos.
Steps 1–3: Prepping a photo for printing
These steps involve all the things you do before you print so that your print-
outs look their best:
1. Set your color management preferences to Adobe RGB (1998) by
choosing Edit➪Color Settings in any workspace.
Alternatively, you can press Shift+Ctrl+K or (Ctrl+Alt+G if printing from
the Organizer). The Color Settings dialog box opens.
2. Select the Always Optimize for Printing radio button.
See Chapter 2 for more information on Color Management.
3. Open the photos you want to print in Standard Edit mode and apply
image enhancement edits according to the needs of each individual
image, as we describe in Chapter 10. 
Edit image brightness, color balance, clarity, and sharpness as needed.
4. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
The Image Size dialog box opens, where you can set the resolution to the
optimum printer resolution and type the width or height that matches
the output dimensions in the respective text boxes. 
Be certain you only downsample images and do not upsample them in
the Image Size dialog box. (See Chapter 3 for more information about
resolution, resampling, and resizing images.)
You can size images freely in the Print Selected Files dialog box. However,
doing so puts an extra burden on your computer and printer. You’ll find
printing is much faster when you size images in Standard Edit mode to a
1:1 ratio between the image size and the print size.
301
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

302
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
5. If you need to crop the image, use the Crop tool. 
You may find it easier to use the Crop tool either before or after visiting
the Image Size dialog box, depending on the photo and what needs to be
cropped. (See Chapter 9 for more information on cropping images.)
6. Save your edits by choosing File➪Save or File➪Save As to overwrite
the existing file or save a copy of the file, respectively. Be certain to
check the box for Include in the Organizer when saving the files so
the edited photos will be added to the current catalog.
Anything you do to a photo should be saved before printing the image.
If Elements quits unexpectedly, you’ll loose all the edits you made if you
don’t first save the file. 
Steps 4–6: Selecting photos you want to print
With your edited files ready to go, it’s time to select them for printing. Here
are the details:
1. If you’re not already in the Organizer, click the Photo Browser button
to open it.
2. Tag images (optional). 
If you have few images in an Organizer window, you can skip this step.
If you have a large number of files, you might find it easier to locate your
files to print if you tag them. 
a. Open the Tags palette, create a new tag, and name the tag — 
something like Files to Print. (See Chapter 6 for more information
on creating tags and tagging files.)
b. Drag the tag to the files you edited for printing. 
c. Click the square adjacent to the tag name, and the Organizer
window changes to show only your tagged photos.
3. Select the files you want to print.
If you want to print all the tagged files, press Ctrl+A or use the Edit➪
Select All menu command. If you want to eliminate files from the selected
group, press the Ctrl key and click the selected images to deselect them.
Steps 7–8: Choosing your Page Setup options
With your files selected, you’re ready to choose all the Page Setup options.
You can do this in a number of ways, but sticking to one area for all your
printing options simplifies the process and helps ensure that you don’t miss
any important steps. The following steps walk you through all the options
available and explain what they mean:

1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print Selected Files dialog box.
2. At the bottom of the Print Selected Files dialog box, click Page Setup.
The Page Setup dialog box opens.
This dialog box will be different
for each printer because the
properties are choices you make
for your specific printer. For
example, in Figure 14-3, the
printer is an Epson desktop
color printer. Most Epson print-
ers have similar settings
options. If you use a printer
from a different manufacturer,
you may see some different
choices, but the important
attributes for selecting a paper
type and variations of color
printing choices are fairly stan-
dard among all desktop color
printers.
3. Select the quality type, based
on the paper you use and the
image content. 
In Figure 14-3, you could choose either Photo or Best Photo for printing
photo images. If using a photo-quality paper, you want to select the Best
Photo option.
4. Select a paper type. 
This option is found with most desktop color printers, and it’s one of the
most critical choices you need to make. Be certain the paper type selec-
tion from a radio button, check box, or drop-down menu matches the
paper you use to print the file. You’ll see noticeable differences in prints
if the proper paper selection is not made.
5. Depending on your printer and the recommendations made in the
user manual, make any other necessary adjustments.
For example, you may have many other options for photo enhance-
ments, sharpening, reversing print order, checking ink levels, running
routine maintenance, and so on. Be certain to refer to the user guide to
become familiar with other options.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
6. After you gain a little experi-
ence, check out advanced
options if your printer sup-
ports them. 
You may include adjustments
for brightness and color render-
ing, such as those found with
the Epson printer shown in
Figure 14-4. If your printer con-
sistently prints with a color shift
(changing color from your moni-
tor appearance to the printed
piece), you may be able to 
make some corrections in the
advanced settings. Don’t attempt
this until you are completely
familiar with your printer. When
you feel you’re ready, experi-
ment and play with the settings
after thoroughly reviewing the
printer’s user guide.
7. Click OK in the Page Setup dialog box to return to the Print Selected
Files dialog box.
Step 9: Selecting your print options
After choosing your Page Setup options, you jump back to the Print Selected
Files dialog box (refer to Figure 14-2), where you can choose print options.
You may want to review the images you selected on the left side of the dialog
box to double-check that you’re printing all the images you want, no more
and no less:
 To add more photos to the Image thumbnails, click the Add (+) symbol
for additional files to print.
 To delete a file from the list, select a thumbnail and click the minus (–)
symbol. Deleting a file here does not delete the file from the Organizer.
On the right side of the Print Selected Files dialog box, you see a set of steps
that walk you through all the print options — well, sort of. Some of the
options are more self-explanatory than others. The following steps mirror
the steps you’ll find in the dialog box, but with a bit more explanation of the
options:
Figure 14-4: Open an advanced properties
dialog box and look over options choices
available for advanced settings.

1. Select Printer.
Select your target printer from the drop-down menu. This option is the
same as selecting your printer in the Page Setup dialog box.
Other options you can choose from in this area include: 
• Check or adjust your printer preferences: Click the icon adjacent
to the Select Printer drop-down menu and you open the Printer
preferences, the same as when selecting Properties in the Page
Setup dialog box.
• Select Print Image Matching (P.I.M.): Print Image Matching
ensures that a P.I.M.-enabled digital camera and printer work
together to produce the best possible color. Check this box if your
camera supports P.I.M. To learn more about P.I.M., click the light
bulb icon to the right of the check box.
• Select Exif Print: This option is available only if your photos have
Exif data. Exif Print is a format that allows additional information
to be recorded with digital camera data. Among the data recorded
by the camera are color profile and print optimization information.
If your digital camera supports Exif Print, check this box. Note that
this option is not available for files in which Exif data was not
recorded.
A lot of information on Print Image Matching technology and Exif Print is
available. To find out more about getting your camera and printer in sync
using P.I.M., check out a Web site dedicated to providing information on
this technology. Open your Web browser and browse to www.printimage
matching.com. For more information on Exif Print, search the Internet
and locate information on the current version of the Exif Print format.
2. Select Type of Print.
From the drop-down menu, select the type of prints you want. When
printing individual images on your printer, use the Individual Prints
menu command. You also have options for Contact Sheets, Picture
Package, and Labels (see sections later in this chapter for printing with
these other options).
3. Select Print Size and Options.
From a drop-down menu, you have options for the image size printed on
paper. You can select from fixed print options common for photo print
sizes, such as 31⁄2 × 5, 4 × 6, 8 × 10, and so on, or you can edit the width
and height dimensions of the final print to create a custom size.
You must have sufficient resolution to produce quality prints. Therefore,
you can’t size a small 2-×-3 photo to an 11-×-17-inch print size. For more
information on printing and resolution, see Chapter 3.
305
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

306
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
You also find a few other options in this area:
• One Photo Per Page: If this check box is checked, only a single
photo in the selected group prints to a page. Uncheck the box and
you can print as many selected photos as you can fit on one page.
• Use each photo __ times: If you want multiple copies of the same
image, type a value in this text box.
• Crop to fit: This option is grayed out if you select Actual Size from
the Select Print Size and Options drop-down menu. For all other
sizes you select from the menu commands, you can check the box
to crop images to fit the selected print size. When the check box is
checked, the print fits the paper at the horizontal or vertical size
(whichever is smaller) and the excess (horizontal or vertical) is
cut off.
Step 10: Working in the More Options dialog box
Opening the More Options dialog box and making some choices before print-
ing files to your printer is critical. This dialog box contains choices for some
optional items and a selection for using a color profile.
Click More Options in the Print
Selected Files dialog box, and the
More Options dialog box, shown in
Figure 14-5, opens. Choices in the
More Options dialog box include:
 Label: Check the boxes for
labels you want printed outside
the image area.
 Other: If you want to print 
iron-on transfers for T-shirts
and other types of items that
accept transfer material, check
the box for Invert Image
(Transfer Printing).
Crop marks are lines that iden-
tify where a print is cut when
printing images on paper larger
than the image size. Check the
box if you have some white area
on the edges of an image and
your print doesn’t show you a
clear area where a print needs
to be cut. Using crop marks
Figure 14-5: Click More Options in the Print
Selected Files dialog box to open the More
Options dialog box.

shows you where to cut a print to eliminate any white border that may
appear on the final print.
 Border: Select a size from the drop-down menu or edit the text box to
determine the line width for a border. If you don’t want a border printed
around the image, uncheck the box for Add a Border.
Click the color swatch to open the Color Picker, where you can select a
color for a border.
 Color Management: The Print Space drop-down menu lists a number of
different color profiles. If you have a color profile that was installed with
your printer software, the profile is listed in this menu. Be certain to use a
printer profile when printing to your printer. When you select a profile, the
color from your monitor viewing color space is converted to the printer
color space. Without getting too technical, you generally see much better
prints when using a color profile designed for your printer. (For more
information on color profiles and color management, see Chapter 2.)
After making choices in the More Options dialog box, click OK and you return
to the Print Selected Files dialog box.
Step 11: Sending images to your printer
This last step is easy. After you’ve selected all your options, click the Print
button and your file is printed using all the choices you made.
Consistency is your best means for committing complex procedures to
memory. If you prefer printing from one of the edit modes, then by all means,
do it. Just be certain you are consistent in using the same mode and the same
dialog boxes for printing until you’ve mastered all the options and you can
predict the print results before exploring different alternatives.
Printing a video image
If you have video clips in your Organizer window, you can print the first
frame in a video image. The video frame must be printed from the Organizer
window. You cannot open audio files, video frames, or Creations in either
editing mode.
Select a video clip and choose File➪Print. The same Print Selected Photos
dialog box opens as when selecting photos for printing. Choose the same
options for printing the file as you do for printing photos and click the Print
button.
Note that video frames are low resolution, and the quality is likely to be poor
when printing the first frame in a video clip at full size. If you want to print
thumbnail images, you can reduce the image size in the Print Selected Files
dialog box, and the quality will improve as the image size is reduced.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Printing a contact sheet
In the same way that you can get contact sheets from photo labs when sub-
mitting film-processing orders, Elements provides you a means for printing
contact sheets from selected photos:
1. Select the photos you want to print as a contact sheet and choose
File➪Print.
2. Make all the choices discussed earlier for printing selected photos.
3. From the Select Type of Print drop-down menu in the Print Selected
Files dialog box, select Contact Sheet.
4. Use the check boxes to add labels.
When printing a contact sheet, it’s helpful to add label information. As
soon as you select the Contact Sheet menu option, check boxes appear
for adding labels, as you see in Figure 14-6.
Figure 14-6: Select Contact Sheet from the Select Type of Print drop-down menu, select the number of
columns, and check the boxes for label information.

5. If you like, edit the Columns text box to select the number of columns
you want to appear on the contact sheet.
As fewer columns are selected, the resultant image sizes become larger.
The Print Preview area shows you a preview of the contact sheet.
6. After setting the print attributes, click Print.
The images are printed on individual sheets of paper according to the
number of selected files and the number of pages required to print
all files.
Packaging pictures
Picture packages are also similar to orders you can place at photo labs; a pack-
age might include one photo in several different sizes printed on one piece
of photo paper or multiple images printed at different sizes on one piece of
photo paper.
In addition to the choices you have for print sizes, Elements offers you many
choices for framing images. In Figure 14-7, you can see a choice made for
printing two 3-×-5 prints, and an Antique Oval was selected as the frame.
Figure 14-7: Picture packages offer options for image sizes and frame choices.
309
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

310
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Like printing contact sheets, you make the Picture Package selection in the
Select Type of Print drop-down menu. Frame options are selected from the
Select a Frame drop-down menu.
If you want the same image printed at different sizes, select an option for the
size from the Select a Layout drop-down menu and check the Fill Page With
First Photo box. If this check box is checked, each image is printed at differ-
ent sizes on the same sheet of paper. Unchecking the box prints selected
images distributed at different sizes on the same sheet of paper.
In Figure 14-8, multiple image sizes appear on one sheet of paper, and with
the Fill Page With First Photo check box checked, the same image is set to
print on the same sheet of paper. Note that the frame option Antique
Rectangle 1 is selected from the Select a Frame drop-down menu.
Figure 14-8: Check Fill Page With First Photo and the same image prints on one sheet of paper at sizes
determined by the selection made in the Select a Layout drop-down menu.

Printing Avery label sizes
Elements provides you an option for printing Avery labels at preset sizes.
Open the Select Type of Print drop-down menu and select Labels. The Select
a Layout drop-down menu lists four label sizes and the Avery label code for
each size.
When you purchase labels at your local office supply store, be certain to jot
down the codes and sizes on a piece of paper. Purchase the label sizes
according to the product code, and you’re ready to print labels from
Elements.
Printing Creations with Adobe Reader
In Chapter 16, we talk about making creations in Photoshop Elements. All 
the to-dos and know-hows are addressed in that chapter. However, because
we’re talking about printing in this chapter, we thought you might like to
know how to print creations, such as photo albums, greeting cards, and 
calendars.
The reason printing creations is different from printing your photos is that
many creations are exported to Adobe PDF format. After your creation is
packaged for output as a PDF, you can’t use the print options in Elements to
print your creation files. You need to use Adobe Reader instead.
Adobe Reader is installed with your Elements installation, but you may want
to check the version of the Reader program and upgrade your free Adobe
Reader to the most current version. The Elements 4 CD installer provides you
with Adobe Reader 7. Be certain to install this version if you have an older
version installed on your computer.
Adobe Reader offers two ways to go about printing your creations, each with
its own advantages:
 The Print and Page Setup dialog boxes offer a multitude of options that
you can tweak to your heart’s content. In particular, the Page Scaling
options enable you to customize the layout of the printed page.
 The Picture Tasks bar doesn’t have all the options of the Print dialog
box but does offer a wizard that walks you through the print setup and
includes templates you can use for quick and easy page layout. For
example, one template sets up a page of wallet-size prints.
311
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

312
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Printing with the dialog boxes
Printing from the Adobe Reader Page Setup and Print dialog boxes is much
like printing with similar dialog boxes in Elements or even other programs.
But some of the options are unique to Adobe Reader, and this section walks
you through all of them. When you use this method, you will find that you
have lots of options to choose from.
To print using these dialog boxes, follow these steps: 
1. Launch Adobe Reader, choose File➪Open, and open the PDF creation
that you want to print.
Adobe Reader has a Full Screen mode much like the Elements Full Screen
View mode. Many creations you make with Elements that get exported to
Adobe PDF open in Adobe Reader’s Full Screen Mode. 
2. Bail out of Full Screen Mode by pressing the Esc key.
Now you can see the Reader toolbars, which were hidden while in Full
Screen Mode. You’ll want to use these toolbars when printing files.
3. Choose File➪Page Setup and select the paper size and orientation in
the Page Setup dialog box.
Adobe Reader has a nasty habit of returning to default options in the
Page Setup dialog box and doesn’t remember the last settings you made
for printing a file. Make a habit of always opening the Page Setup dialog
box and selecting the correct paper size and orientation before opening
the Print dialog box each time you print a new file.
4. Choose File➪Print.
The Print dialog box, shown in Figure 14-9, opens. Alternatively, press
Ctrl+P.
Note that the slider at the bottom of the preview image scrolls pages in
the PDF file. Move the slider right to advance pages. Note in Figure 14-9
that the preview shows page 5 of 19 pages.
5. Select your target printer from the Name drop-down menu if it’s not
already selected.
6. Click Properties to open your printer’s Properties dialog box, where
you can make the same choices covered in “Stepping through a print
job with Print Selected Files,” earlier in this chapter. Then click OK.
7. Back in the Print dialog box, choose Document from the Comments
and Forms drop-down menu.
The creations you produce in Elements won’t have comment notes or
form fields. Printing Comments and Form Fields are used with other
types of PDF documents, not those created in Elements.

Figure 14-9: After you choose your options in the Page Setup dialog box, use the Print dialog
box to adjust the settings for your printer.
8. Select a print range by typing in the From and To text boxes the page
numbers you want to print. If you want to print all pages, select All.
9. In the Page Handling area, select the number of copies you want to
print.
10. Be certain to choose an appropriate page scaling.
• Fit to Printer Margins makes pages fit on the selected page size.
• Multiple Pages per Sheet enables you to design your custom
layout. In the text boxes that appear, type the number of columns
in the first text box and the number of rows in the second text box. 
Using the Multiple Pages per Sheet option is a great way to print cards for
CD and DVD jewel cases. You can write your creations to CD-ROMs and
DVDs and then print a card that fits nicely inside the CD/DVD jewel case.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
11. Select or deselect the following check boxes, depending on your 
circumstances:
• If the Auto Rotate and Center check box is checked, Reader auto-
matically rotates pages to fit on the paper and centers the page on
the paper. Auto rotation is handy if you have both Portrait and
Landscape images in the same PDF document.
• Choose Paper Source by PDF Page Size is an option you use when
you have different page sizes in a single document. In most cases,
you won’t use this option, so leave it unchecked.
• Selecting Print to File sends your file to your hard drive and not to
the printer. It can be helpful for those printing to PostScript print-
ers, but for your color desktop printer, make sure this check box
remains unchecked.
12. Click OK and the file is sent to your target printer.
Be patient and let the printer do its work. Depending on the number of
pages, it may take a little time to complete the print job.
If you can’t print the PDF file to your
printer, go back through all the
options in the preceding list, but
before you click OK, click the
Advanced button to open the
Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
Here, check the Print as Image check
box, as shown in Figure 14-10.
Sometimes PDF documents can over-
load a printer’s memory — especially
if it uses a lot of fonts. The Print as
Image option rasterizes all the page
data (see Chapters 3 and 13 for more
information on rasterizing data) and
simplifies the printing. However, the
down side to Print as Image is that the image quality is likely to be notice-
ably degraded. Use this option only if you cannot print a PDF file on your
printer.
Printing with the Picture Tasks tool
The Picture Tasks tool offers an alternative way to print with Adobe Reader.
One advantage of using this tool is that you can choose from templates that
Figure 14-10: Check Print as Image in the
Advanced Print Setup if you can’t print a PDF
document to your printer.

set up the page in a certain way for you. Here’s how you can use the Picture
Tasks tool to print a creation you made in Elements:
1. Export a PDF from one of Elements’ creation options and open the
creation in Adobe Reader.
The Picture Tasks tool is loaded in the Reader Toolbar Well at the top of
the Reader window.
2. Open the drop-down menu from the Picture Tasks tool and select
How To . . . Picture Tasks.
This menu command opens the How To pane that appears on the right
side of the Adobe Reader workspace, as shown in Figure 14-11. 
Figure 14-11: Use the Picture Tasks How To pane to select different tasks and find help information.
315
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

316
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
In the How To pane, you have links that open dialog boxes for perform-
ing the various tasks listed. You can also find brief help information
that describes what each task does. For printing creations, you click
Print Pictures; see the nearby sidebar for more details about all the
tasks.
3. Click Print Pictures in the
How To pane.
Alternatively, you can open
the Picture Tasks drop-down
menu and select Print Pictures.
The Picture Tasks Print Wizard
opens after clicking in the
How To pane or selecting
the menu command. Note in
Figure 14-12 that the Print
Wizard from Picture Tasks 
is different than the Print
dialog box you open when
choosing File➪Print in Adobe
Reader.
4. Select the pages to print.
Click Select All in the Print
Wizard to select all pages to print or individually check and uncheck the
boxes to mark those pictures you want to print.
5. Click Next and select a printing template.
You have many options for using a printing template. Notice in Figure 14-13
that the Wallet template is selected, and the preview shows all pages
as they will print in wallet sizes. Click a Radio button to select the tem-
plate you want.
Although Picture Tasks printing offers you an option to create a picture
package like picture packages created in Elements, you have more
options available in Elements. You’re better off using Elements for this
task. However if you lose your original images after making a creation,
you can use the option in Adobe Reader.
6. Click Print to print the pages.
You may not be familiar with the Picture Tasks tool because it isn’t avail-
able in a plain PDF document you might download from a Web site or a
help file on the Elements installer CD. Only PDF documents that are created
from image files — including your Elements creations — support Picture
Tasks.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Getting Professional
Although you have the tools to create great professional-quality prints, you
also have many options for printing your pictures at service centers and dis-
count stores. There are many reasons why turning to a service center may be
better than printing photos yourself:
 Cost: In some cases, purchasing photo prints at discount stores is
cheaper than buying the materials for your desktop printer.
 Printing capabilities: You may find printing on different kinds of papers
and sizes to be more within the capabilities of a service center than you
have available using your own equipment.
 Longer-lasting prints: Photo labs and service centers can use different
materials and processes than you can use with an inkjet desktop printer.
Inasmuch as there have been great advances in printer technology, you
still wind up with prints that are ink-based, which can lead to more pro-
gressive fading and shorter life expectancies than the prints you order
from photo labs. If you take a roll of film to a photo lab or photo service,
the film is chemically processed, and the prints are output on machines
that use a photo chemical process, exposing the paper and running it
through a developer, fixer, and wash. If you take digital-camera images to
a photo lab or service center, you get exactly the same kinds of prints as
you get from film. 
The one disadvantage of ordering prints from a photo service center is that
you lose control over the printing process. If you shop at the bargain centers,
your images are printed without the intervention of a qualified technician.
The average mega-store employee knows very little about color management,
profiles, and printing options other than the automated runs they perform on
their photo equipment. Therefore, you need to be certain to prepare your
files properly before sending them to a service center, and this section shows
you how. You also find a handy checklist that can help you make sure your
photos are in good shape before you send them off to a photo lab or service
center.
Using color profiles with service centers
Although we cover color profiles in detail in Chapter 3, here are some things
you should know about color profiles and printing:
 Elements can embed one of two color spaces. When saving a file, you
can use sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) and embed the color profile in your
files. These color spaces are monitor color working spaces and are used
when you edit files in Photoshop Elements.
 When printing to a color printer, you get best results when printing
with a printer color profile. The color profile you use with printing

equipment is a printer’s profile. When you print a picture to a printing
device, your monitor color profile is converted to the printer’s color 
profile.
 When you print files to your desktop printer, you select your printer’s
profile when you print the file. In the More Options section of the Print
Selected Files dialog box, you select your printer’s color profile and
print the job. Your monitor color is then converted to the printer color
during the print process.
Okay, so all the above is related to what you can control on your printing
equipment. If you take your files to a custom photo-finishing lab, the qualified
technicians may print your files using their equipment’s color profiles. It’s all
well and good so far.
Now here comes the problem. Your most economical avenue for getting
photo prints from a service center is to use a mega-store like Costco, Sam’s
Club, and FedEx Kinko’s. These outlets offer the best prices because they
don’t use $100-an-hour experienced color technicians, and they don’t give
you custom printing services. Their service is as automated as possible.
Rather than opening a file in Photoshop Elements or Adobe Photoshop and
selecting a color profile before printing, the technicians usually download
your pictures with a downloader utility, and the file is printed using an
embedded color profile. You can’t blame the stores. They’re offering a prod-
uct at a very low cost, like less than 10 cents a print for standard 4 × 6 photo
prints.
Your problem, then, is embedding the right profile in your pictures. You know
you can’t use Elements because Elements can’t embed profiles other than
sRGB and Adobe RGB (1998). Well, with a little help from some free down-
loads, you can edit your pictures for the best possible printing, and here’s
how you do it:
1. Make all the necessary edits you need to make in Elements and save
your files in TIFF format.
You must use TIFF format to use the converter we mention in Step 6.
2. Download color profiles from your providers’ Web sites.
Almost all service centers post color profiles for their printing equip-
ment. You can visit the Costco Web site at www.costco.com, click the
Services link on the home page, and click Photo Center on the next page.
You are prompted to set up an account, and then you come to a page
where profiles are listed. Costco makes the profiles available for stores
in their geographic regions, and usually you find profiles for printing 
on their equipment and profiles best suited for different papers. This 
is something you need to observe. If several profiles are available for
downloading, be certain to use the right profile for the paper you want
your pictures to be printed on.
319
Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper

320
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
If you use a photo lab that wants you to embed profiles, you can visit
independent lab Web sites and download profiles as well.
3. Copy the profiles to your system color folder: C:\WINDOWS\system32\
spool\drivers\color.
This is the folder where all your color profiles are stored.
4. Download a converter by going to http://drycreekphoto.com/
tools/profile_converter and clicking the link for
ProfileConverterSetup.zip.
You need a utility to convert your files that use the Adobe RGB (1998)
color space to the color space used by machines at your service center.
Fortunately, the Dry Creek Photo converter is a great free tool.
In addition, the Dry Creek Photo Web site is one of the best sources of
information available for color management and color profiling. In addi-
tion to offering custom color profiling services, Dry Creek Photo hosts 
a number of different color profiles for many different commercial 
printers.
5. After downloading the file to your hard drive, double-click the Setup
file and follow the brief steps in the install wizard.
6. Choose Start➪Programs➪
Dry Creek Photo➪Profile
Converter➪ICC Profile
Converter.
The simple program interface
opens, as you see in Figure 14-14.
7. Click the Source Image ellipsis
(. . .) and select the source file.
The source file is the file you
want to print, saved in TIFF
format.
8. Click the Source Color Profile ellipsis and select the source color 
profile.
This is the color profile that is currently embedded in your source file.
9. Click the Destination Image ellipsis and select the folder where you
want to save your file. 
10. Click the Destination Color Profile ellipsis and select the color profile
used by the equipment where you place your order.
You saved your color profiles to the Windows Color folder, so be certain
to look in this folder for the target printer color profiles.
Figure 14-14: Select the options for converting
the color profile and check the box for Embed
Profile before clicking the Convert button.

11. If you want to process multiple files, check the box for Process
Multiple Files. 
12. Be certain to check the box for Embed Profile in Image and then click
the Convert button when all the options have been selected.
After you click Convert, the profile converter handles the profile conver-
sion and saves your files to the target folder.
Submitting files to service centers
On provider Web sites, you can usually find guidelines for the file formats
acceptable and the recommended resolution and dimensions of your images.
If you don’t see these guidelines on Web sites, be sure to call and inquire as
to what file attributes are acceptable.
As a general rule, here are some things you should consider when submitting
files if guidelines are not provided:
 Resolution: For photo printing machines, be certain to submit files at
300 ppi (pixels per inch). See Chapter 3 for more information on image
resolution.
 Dimensions: As a general rule, size images to the print size. For exam-
ple, if you want 4-×-6-inch prints, be certain your images are sized to 
4 × 6 inches at 300 ppi.
 File format: Some centers may
take only JPEG images. If TIFF is
not acceptable, open the con-
verted images you saved from
Dry Creek ICC Profile Converter.
Open the TIFF file(s) in
Photoshop Elements and
choose File➪Save As. Be certain
the check box is checked for
ICC Profile in the Save Options
in the Save/Save As dialog box. Select JPEG for the format and click Save.
Notice that the profile used with the Dry Creek ICC Profile Converter is
listed as the ICC Profile. In Figure 14-15, you can see a profile embedded
for a Costco print center.
 Media storage: If you walk into a FedEx Kinko’s store and go to the self-
serve photo printing machines, you won’t see support for any external
USB hard drives or removable USB drives. All the print centers support a
wide range of media cards used by digital cameras. Be certain to use
your memory cards and not USB devices when placing orders. If you use
Compact Flash II, memory sticks, or other media sources used by digital
cameras, copy your files to these sources when you place orders as a
walk-in customer.

Vendors that host Web sites with downloadable profiles and order informa-
tion are likely to accept file uploads online. This saves you the time fighting
crowds when placing orders. In some cases, you can have service centers
mail your images back to you so you won’t need to wait when picking up
orders either — but this online ordering stuff is another matter that we talk
about in the next section.
Using Online Printing Services
Photoshop Elements supports the Adobe Photoshop Services program that is
a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Kodak EasyShare (formerly Ofoto),
a division of Kodak. The Services program offers online ordering of prints,
sharing of photos and projects, and a huge array of different print products
for consumers and professionals.
As of this writing, you get 10 free prints, so it’s worth taking a little time to
check out the service — especially if you want to order prints and have them
mailed directly to your home or office. No lines, no hassles, no fighting high-
rising gasoline costs — this service offers great prints and an abundance of
convenience.
To use the service, follow these steps:
1. Select files in the Organizer much like you would select files for printing.
2. In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 14-16. The first
screen you come to in the wizard is a form for you to create an account.
If you try to place an order from your office where your IT department
prevents connecting to some external sources, you may need to have
your firewall settings adjusted. Talk to your IT department to help you
make a connection. 
3. If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and
step through the wizard by clicking the Next button on each page 
in the wizard. If you have set up an account, supply your logon 
information.
The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of
the wizard order page. 
4. You can modify your order by deleting files from the order and speci-
fying different print sizes and quantities of prints.

Figure 14-16: Choose File➪Order Prints and the Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens.
One nice feature in the service is the option for sending duplicate prints
to another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web
site and specify whom you want to receive an order. This is a nice fea-
ture if you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean
cruise and want to send all the kids photos of the great time you’re
having. Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load up the digital
camera images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you return
to Buffalo in mid-winter with a suntan, your kids will be frowning as they
fan through the prints they received a week earlier.
5. Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and con-
firm your order. Click the Finish button on the last pane and your
order is complete.

E
lements is a great packaging tool you can use to deploy your photos and
creations for screen viewing. And that’s not just your computer monitor.
You can edit photos or assemble creations that are exported for Web viewing,
too, and you can even prepare files to show on your television.
In Chapter 3, you find out about resolutions and color modes. The output
requirements for printing files, which we cover in Chapter 14, are much 
different than what you use for images output for screen viewing.
In this chapter, we cover the options for Web and screen view-
ing that get you started with basics, including saving images
for the Web (or screen viewing), setting up a slideshow,
and burning your images on CDs or DVDs. If you’re
looking to take your Elements projects a step further,
check out Bonus Chapters 1 and 2 on this book’s
Web site. Bonus Chapter 1 explains how to create
GIF animations and show your images on a TV.
Bonus Chapter 2 walks you through the steps for
creating a simple photo gallery where you can share
your pictures on the Web. (You can find details about
the book’s Web site in this book’s introduction.)
Optimizing Images for the Web
When you show images on the Web, you want the images to look good, but
you also want them to download before your visitors lose interest (or patience).
Elements makes striking a balance between the two easy.

326
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
You may already know that file formats come into play when saving images
for the Web. (You can find an overview of file formats in Chapter 3.) The two
standard formats for Web images are JPEG and GIF. But if your first inclina-
tion is to choose File➪Save As and select either of these formats, stop!
There’s a better way.
First, do a little prep work on your files. Then, you get best results if you use
Photoshop Elements’ special command for saving files for Web images. More
options are available to you when using the File➪Save for Web command
than when using other save options. We explain just what you need to know
in the sections that follow.
Preparing files for Web hosting
Before you save a file for Web hosting, you need to make some edits and save
your file by using the Save or Save As menu command. A few edits made in the
Standard Edit mode can save you some time and get the file properly set up
before saving in the JPEG or GIF format with the Save for Web menu command.
Here are the edits you need to consider when preparing files for Web viewing:
 Adjust dimensions and resolution. Use the Image Size dialog box we
discuss in Chapter 3 to resample images to the dimensions and resolu-
tion needed for Web viewing. Resolution should be sampled to 72 ppi,
and the dimensions should equal the size you want the image to appear
on a Web page.
 Change the bit depth to 8-bit. If you capture images with a digital camera
or scan photos in 16- or 32-bit depth, be certain to change the bit depth
to 8-bit by choosing Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel, as we explain in
Chapter 3.
 Consider transparency. You can save files with transparency for Web
viewing. If you want to preserve transparent areas in an image, be cer-
tain to save files without flattening layers, as we explain in Chapter 8.
You can use the Save for Web dialog box to resample images and make some
adjustments that prepare the image for saving for a Web file. However, if your
file has a higher bit depth or resolution than is acceptable for Web graphics,
a warning dialog box informs you that the image exceeds the size Save for
Web was designed for and that you may run out of memory. Therefore, follow
the guidelines here and plan on preparing files for Web requirements before
you attempt to save a file through the Save for Web command.
Using the Save for Web command
After you prepare an image for Web use, it’s time to save the file in either
JPEG or GIF format. Because the Save for Web dialog box is loaded with fea-
tures, here’s a quick preview of the more helpful ones:

 Tools: You can select the Hand tool, the Zoom tool, the Eyedropper tool,
or the Eyedropper Color tool from the top-left corner. Use the Hand tool to
move the image around when zoomed in. Use the Zoom tool to zoom the
preview image, the Eyedropper tool to sample color, and the Eyedropper
Color tool to open the color picker.
 File information at a glance: Information is reported dynamically in the
dialog box below the two previews. The image on the left in Figure 15-1
shows the default image size below the image preview. The image on the
right side shows the new file size according to the options selected in
the Preset area. As you change file attributes, the file size is reported
as well as how long the image will take to download on a 28.8 Kbps
(Kilobytes per second) modem.
The best thing about saving files for Web and screen views is that what you see
is what you get. There’s no guesswork when saving files for screen. If the set-
tings you apply in the Save for Web dialog box don’t look good on the resultant
images, just open the original and save with different settings. You can test
and play with the options to determine settings that work best for you and
immediately preview your results.
Figure 15-1: Choose File➪Save for Web to save files for Web use.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
To finish getting your images ready for the Web with the Save for Web com-
mand, follow these steps:
1. Open your image in either the Quick Fix or Standard Edit mode.
2. Choose File➪Save for Web.
Alternatively, you can press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S. The Save for Web dialog
box opens (refer to Figure 15-1).
3. Below the Preset drop-down menu (where you see GIF appear in
Figure 15-1), select GIF or JPEG.
Because both of these formats are acceptable for Web viewing, the ques-
tion arises: “What format is best for uploading my photos to a Web site?”
Fortunately, you can use a few simple guidelines for deciding which
format to choose:
• Photos: If you’re saving a photo for Web display, use JPEG as your
file format. Continuous-tone images such as photographs appear
best when saved as JPEG. Whereas GIF images support a maximum
of 256 colors, JPEG supports 24-bit images in which a maximum of
16.7 million colors can be seen.
• Artwork: Artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and designs, that
has fewer colors than you see in continuous-tone images is best
saved in GIF format. The reason is simple: The fewer colors you save,
the smaller the file sizes. You want your images to load quickly in
Web browsers, so file size is always a consideration. When saving
in JPEG format, you don’t have the option for saving fewer colors
that the GIF format provides you.
• Animation: If you animate an icon or image, then GIF is your choice
for preserving the animated features. See Bonus Chapter 1 for details.
I’ve been told PNG works
Yes, PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a format
that was designed specifically for Web use. The
limitation is that not all Web browsers support
PNG by default. Some browsers need a special
plug-in to support viewing PNG files. 
Although there are some advantages to saving
in PNG format, such as the ability to save 24-bit
images (see Chapter 3 for more information on
24-bit images) and support for transparency,
you may want to stay away from this format until
you are certain that all Web browsers are
upgraded to support PNG. For safe distribution
of files to display on the Web and to be certain
that all your family and friends can see the
images, use either JPEG or GIF — especially if
Aunt Sara is still using Windows 98 and an old
version of Internet Explorer.

You can also choose one of two PNG formats, but we suggest reading the
nearby sidebar “I’ve been told PNG works” before you go this route.
Alternatively, you can choose a preset for GIF, JPEG, or PNG from the
Preset drop-down menu. The Custom option enables you to choose the
attributes you want.
4. If you chose Custom from the Preset drop-down menu, choose the
format attributes for whichever format you chose in Step 3 (JPEG
or GIF).
If you chose JPEG, you have the following format attributes to choose
from, as shown in Figure 15-2:
• Quality: Select image compression and a setting for quality consis-
tent with the options we discuss in Chapter 3.
• ICC Profile: This check box enables you to embed a color profile.
See Chapter 14 for more information on using color profiles.
Figure 15-2: JPEG options are different than options you use for GIF images.
329
Chapter 15: Showing It on Screen

330
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
If you chose GIF, you can adjust the following attributes instead:
• Color intents: You have options for Selective, Adaptive, and
Restrictive (Web). Use the Restrictive (Web) option (refer to Fig-
ure 15-1) to reduce colors to a Web-safe palette, as we describe in
Chapter 3. This reduces colors to 216 compatible colors when
saving in GIF format.
• Interlaced: Use this option to interlace the image, so it appears on
a Web page in a slow progression from a faded graphic to the full-
resolution image.
• Colors: Use the slider to adjust the number of colors in a GIF image.
If you have only eight colors shown on a piece of artwork, this text
box and slider let you reduce the colors from 256 to 8.
• Dither: For best quality, leave the default at 100%. Dithering helps
create smooth transitions between colors.
• Matte: If you save a file on a layer and don’t preserve the trans-
parency, the matte setting turns the transparent areas to the color
selected for the matte. You can choose from black, white, a color
in the image you sample with the eyedropper tool (seen in the top-
left corner of the dialog box), or a custom color you select from
the Color Picker. (See Chapter 12 for more information on selecting
colors in the Color Picker.)
5. For either GIF or JPEG, check the Transparency box to preserve trans-
parency. (For JPEG you also have an option for Progressive. Check the
Progressive checkbox to save a file that progressively appears in a
Web browser as the file downloads from the Web.)
6. Click OK to save the file.
Another dialog box opens where you can make choices for filename and
location.
Although you also have an area for outputting different dimensions in the
New Size area, it’s better to do your sizing before you use Save for Web. In
“Preparing files for Web hosting,” earlier in this chapter, we explain how
you prepare images at the correct size and resolution before accessing the
Save for Web command.
Creating a Slide Show
This Million Dollar Baby is no Mystic River; it’s simply Absolute Power! Well . . .
maybe you won’t travel the same path from Rowdy Yates to multiple Academy
Award–winning director and filmmaker Clint Eastwood, but even Mr. Eastwood
might be impressed with the options for movie making with Photoshop
Elements’ slide show creations. When he’s not rolling out the Panaflex camera,
Mr. Eastwood might just want to take photos of the grandkids and do the
directing and producing as well as the editing right in Photoshop Elements.

For the rest of us, we can be our own Clint Eastwood wannabes by using the
powerful features of the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor to create PDF
slide shows and movie files. It’s so easy, Elements promises you won’t be
Unforgiven.
Creating a project
You create a project file in the Slide Show Editor and can then export it for a
number of different uses. In this section, you find out how to create and save
your project. In the next section, you dive into exporting.
Here’s how you create a slide show project that you can edit and export at a
later time:
1. Open the Organizer and select the pictures you want to use in your
slide show.
2. Click the Create button in the Shortcuts bar and select Slide Show
when the Creation Setup window opens. Click OK.
The Slide Show Preferences dialog box opens. Just about everything in
the dialog box can be adjusted in the Slide Show Editor, so don’t worry
about making choices here. If you want to keep the Slide Show Preferences
dialog box from reappearing when you make slide creations, remove the
check mark from the Show This Dialog Each Time a New Slide Show Is
Created option. 
3. Click OK in the Slide Show Preferences dialog box.
The Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor opens, as shown in
Figure 15-3.
4. If your Slide Show Editor doesn’t show you a screen similar to 
Figure 15-3, maximize the window by clicking the Maximize button
in the top-right corner of the Editor window.
This way, you can see the Storyboard at the bottom of the screen and
the Palette Bin on the right side of the editor.
5. (Optional) Create a Pan & Zoom view.
As slides are shown, you can zoom and pan a slide. Click the check box
marked Enable Pan and Zoom and click the Start thumbnail. A rectangle
appears in the preview area. Move any one of the four corner handles in
or out to resize the rectangle. Moving the cursor inside the rectangle and
clicking the mouse button enables you to move the rectangle around the
preview.
For the end zoom position, click the End thumbnail and size the rectangle
to a full view or a view you want to stop the zoom. Notice in Figure 15-3
that the Start thumbnail is selected and the rectangle is sized to about
50% in the center of the first slide.

Figure 15-3: Open the Slide Show Editor and choose your options for a slide show. 
6. (Optional) Add a graphic.
A library of graphics appears in the Extras pane in the Palette Bin. Drag
a graphic to a slide. If you want a blank slide to appear first and add text
and graphics to the blank slide, click the Add Blank Slide in the Shortcuts
Bar at the top of the editor.
7. (Optional) Add text.
Click the Text tool in the Extras pane in the Palette Bin and drag a text
style to the blank slide or the opening slide in the slide show. After you
drag text to a slide, the Text Properties pane opens in the Palette Bin.
The text you drag to the slide is placeholder text. To edit the text, click
Edit Text in the Properties pane. You can also select a font, a font point
size, a color for the text, text alignment, and a font style. After setting
the type attributes, click inside the text and move it to position.

8. (Optional) Set transitions.
The icons between the slides in the Storyboard (at the bottom of the
Slide Show Editor) indicate a default transition applied to the slide show.
You can change transition effects for each slide independently or to all
the slides in the show. Click the right-pointing arrow on the right side of
a transition icon to open a pop-up menu containing a number of different
transitions. If you want to apply the same transition to all slides, select
Apply to All from the menu commands.
9. (Optional) Add audio and media.
You can add audio to the slide show by choosing Add Media➪
Audio from Organizer (or from Folder). Select an audio file and click OK.
You can also add movie files to your slide show. A movie file can be added
on top of a slide or on a new slide. When the slide show is played, the
video file plays. Choose Add Media➪Photos and Media from Organizer
(or from Folder).
This same set of commands can also be used to add additional pictures
to the slide show.
10. (Optional) Record your own sounds.
If you want to add narration, click the Narration tool in the Palette Bin,
and the Extras pane changes to provide you with tools to record a sound
or import a sound file. Note that this option requires you to have a micro-
phone properly configured on your computer.
11. (Optional) Fit slides to the audio.
If you have 3 minutes of audio and the slide duration is 2 minutes 30 sec-
onds, you can, with a single mouse click, fit the slide duration uniformly
to fit the 3-minute audio time. Just click the Fit Slides to Audio tool below
the preview image.
If you want to manually adjust time for slide durations, click the down
arrow on the time readout below the slide thumbnails in the Storyboard.
12. Click Save Project in the Shortcuts Bar and, in the dialog box that
opens, type a name and click Save.
Your project is added to the Organizer and is available for further editing
at a later time. Or you can open it to save in a number of different output
formats, as we explain in the next section.
13. Preview the slide show.
Before exporting the slide show, you can see a preview by clicking the
buttons directly below the image preview area. If you want a full-screen
preview, click the Preview button in the Shortcuts Bar and click the play
button.

Exporting to slides and video
After creating a project, you have a number of different output options. You
can write a project to disc for archival purposes and include slide shows on a
video disc or a DVD. You can e-mail a slide show to another user, share a proj-
ect online, write a project compatible for display on a TV, or save to either a
PDF slide show or a Windows movie file.
We talk about e-mailing and sharing projects in Chapter 16. For now, we
describe how you create slide shows and movie files and write your crea-
tions to a CD or DVD.
To write a PDF slide show or a movie file, do the following:
1. In the Organizer window, double-click the project thumbnail.
The project opens in the Adobe Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor.
2. Click the Output tool in the Shortcuts bar.
The Slide Show Output Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 15-4.
Figure 15-4: Select Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show 
Editor and the Slide Show Output Wizard opens.
3. Select the type of file you want to export to.
Select Movie File (.wmv) to export a Windows media video file. Your
exported video can be viewed in Elements or viewed in the Windows
Media Player. You can import the video in all programs that support
.wmv files.

Select PDF File (.pdf) if you want to create a PDF slide show. If you create
a PDF slide show, some of the animation features, such as zooming slides
and transition effects, won’t be shown in the resultant PDF document.
4. In the dialog box that opens, prompting you to add your output file to
the Organizer, click Yes.
You can now easily view the file by double-clicking it in the Organizer
window.
Opening multi-page PDF files in Elements
If you create a slide show and export the slide show to a PDF document, you
can open individual PDF pages in Elements. Elements can open any PDF docu-
ment created from any PDF producer. Here’s how:
1. In the Organizer, select a file to open and click the Standard Edit
option in the Shortcuts bar.
Remember to select the file and click Standard Edit. Don’t double-click
the file in the Organizer; that action opens the file in Adobe Reader.
When the file is opened in Standard Edit mode, the Import PDF dialog
box opens, as shown in Figure 15-5.
2. In the dialog box, you can select one or more pages and specify the
resolution and color mode.
3. Click OK to open the PDF pages in individual Image windows.
Figure 15-5: Select a PDF file to open in Elements and the Import PDF 
dialog box opens.

Writing Creations to CDs and DVDs
You can output creations, such as slide shows and images you’ve optimized
for TV, to a CD or DVD by using the Slide Show Output Wizard. If you have a
movie but don’t have a DVD burner, most DVD players sold today enable you
to view videodiscs written to CDs. The CDs just won’t hold as much content
as a DVD can.
For writing to a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
1. Open a project in the Slide Show Output Wizard by choosing File➪
Open Creation in the Organizer window.
2. Click Output in the Slide Show Editor.
3. Click Burn to Disc in the Slide Show Output Wizard.
4. Select an option for the type of output you want to use — VCD or DVD
(Figure 15-6).
Figure 15-6: Type a name and select the format to export in the Slide Show Output Wizard.

• If you’re creating a CD, select VCD (Lower Quality; Works on TV
or Computer). When you select this option, your project is con-
verted to a movie file (.wmv) during the write process. If you want
additional files added to the CD, check the box for Include
Additional Slide Shows I’ve Made on This Disc.
• To burn a DVD, check the option DVD (Higher Quality; Works on
TV or Computer) in the Slide Show Output window. Using this
option requires you to have Adobe Premiere Elements installed on
your computer.
5. Click OK and the Burn dialog
box opens, as shown in Fig-
ure 15-7.
6. Select a CD or DVD drive if you
have more than one drive
installed on your computer.
DVD drives can often write in
CD format as well. By default,
the AUTO selection is often your
best choice for the write speed.
7. Click the video format (either
NTSC or PAL) and click OK.
The status bar shows the writ-
ing progress.
After the CD or DVD finishes writing,
pop open your CD/DVD drive and
remove the disc. Place the disc in
your DVD player and press Play. The
movie automatically starts playing
like any commercial videodisc.

Making Creations
In This Chapter
 Understanding common output characteristics for creations
 Creating photo album pages
 Constructing greeting cards and postcards
 Creating calendars
 Using sharing services
A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can be
shared onscreen or in print. In the Creation Setup window, which is fea-
tured throughout this chapter, you have options for creating greeting cards,
photo albums, and calendars. 
In this chapter, we talk about these creations and all the output options
available to you (PDFs, prints, e-mail, and more). It’s all here in
Elements; but shhhhh . . . don’t tell the Photoshop people
because Photoshop doesn’t have all these wonderful cre-
ation features.
Getting a Grip on Common 
Output Methods
In Chapter 15, we talk about slide shows, videodiscs,
and HTML Photo Galleries. These creations offer dif-
ferent output options, such as e-mailing, burning files to
disc, and creating HTML documents, as well as printing
and PDF creation.
The remaining creations you work with in the Creation Setup window
include Album Pages, Bound Photo Albums, Four-Fold Greeting Cards, Photo
Greeting Cards, Calendar Pages, and Bound Calendars. All these creations can
be output to PDF files, to your printer, and sent via e-mail. The two bound
items (photo books and calendars) can also be output to a sharing service.

340
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
For a quick glimpse at what options are available for
each type of creation, select Create in the Organizer
and click items in the left pane of the Creation Setup
window. In the lower-right portion of the window, you
see icons for Adobe PDF, a printer, an online sharing
service, and e-mail, like those shown in Figure 16-1.
As you look over the creations discussed in this
chapter, realize that these are the output methods
supported by projects discussed here.
Creating the Family Photo Album
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album.
Album Pages support all output formats except sharing services. Elements
offers options for printing pages that look just like pages in a fancy photo
album you might purchase at the local drug store.
Follow these steps to create Album Pages:
1. Select files in the Organizer and click Create.
The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the
Organizer (or an editing mode) and then click the Create button in the
Shortcuts bar. If you forget files you want to add to a creation, the cre-
ation wizards provide options for adding photos.
2. Select Album Pages in the Creation Setup window and click OK.
The Create Album Pages Wizard opens.
3. Select a template in the right pane of the wizard and click Next Step.
Another feature common to these creations is a list of templates from
which to choose. From a vast number of predesigned templates, pick the
style you want to use and a preview is shown in the window, as you can
see in Figure 16-2.
4. Using the options for arranging photos, you can add, duplicate,
and delete photos in the album. When you’re done (or if the photos
look okay), click the Next Step button to advance to the next pane.
Step 3 in the wizard shows you the title page.
5. Click the placeholder text and type a title.
6. From the drop-down menu at the top of the pane, select additional
pages to edit the caption on each page.
7. Click Next Step when you finish editing your page captions.
8. In the next pane, type a filename, check the box for showing the
photos in the Organizer, and click Save to save the project.

Figure 16-2: Almost all creations offer you templates that you can use 
with your creations.
The final step is the Share pane (Step 5).
9. Decide what output you want (PDF, print, or e-mail) by clicking the
related button.
Although you can’t share Album Pages online, you can place an online
order by clicking the Order Online button.
If you want to update your project, you can open the saved project and add
more photos at a later date. A new PDF file should be generated if outputting
to PDF. However, if you’re printing pages, you can print just the new pages
added to the updated file.
Another type of photo album is available in the Creation Setup window — the
Bound Photo Album. Although this creation offers the same output options as
photo album pages, the bound album is a creation you more likely order from
an online service provider, which we explain how to do later in this chapter.
The photo album pages we explain how to create in this section, however, are
easier to output yourself.
Greetings!
You can create one of two types of cards with the Creation Setup window.
Both the Four-Fold Card and the Photo Greeting Card follow similar paths
through the creation process — that is, you select photos in the Organizer,
choose a template, add text, and choose an output format. Both these cre-
ations support output for PDF, printing, and e-mailing.

 The Four-Fold Card is a design that is similar to greeting cards folded
twice, creating four panels. On your final design, the folds are marked
with dotted lines.
 Photo Greeting Cards are similar to postcards you pick up at travel 
destinations — the designs are not intended to be folded. Figure 16-3
shows the results of creating a Photo Greeting Card.
Figure 16-3: Photo Greeting Cards are designed like postcards you pick 
up at the airport.
Calendars
Create your own personal calendar in Photoshop Elements, and you won’t buy
any more calendars as each new year rolls around. This is a great tool for cre-
ating calendars for the kids — using pictures of their soccer team, the group
at the boys and girls club, the 4-H club, that great vacation you took with the
family last year — or even for satisfying your own ego by passing out your
creations at the office. The calendar options have many uses, limited only by
your imagination.
The procedure for making calendars is similar to creating cards:
1. Select 13 images in the Organizer and click Create.
When creating calendars, the first image appears on a title page, and the
remaining 12 images appear for each month in the year.
2. Select either Calendar Pages or Bound Calendar in the Creation Setup
window and click OK.
Bound Calendars support sharing services, whereas Calendar Pages do not.

Figure 16-4 shows a Calendar Pages creation shown in Adobe Reader
with a facing pages view.
3. Select a template in the right pane of the wizard and click Next Step.
You see image thumbnails for the photos that appear according to title

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Spreading the Love through Sharing
Two methods of sharing your creations are available in Elements. You can
place orders with online services, specifically the Kodak EasyShare service
we talk about in Chapter 14, or you can e-mail your creation to others.
Ordering bound books and calendars online
Using the Kodak EasyShare service makes ordering and distribution very
easy. You can place orders for photo books and calendars, and the service
takes care of mailing and distributing your creation to friends and family
spread around the country or the world.
With both the Bound Photo Book and the Bound Calendar creations, you have
options for clicking the Order Online button in the Share step (the last step)
in the creation wizards. To set up these creations, you follow the same proce-
dures for selecting photos, templates, adding text, and so on that you can
find in “Creating the Family Photo Album,” earlier in this chapter. When you
get to the last step in the creation wizard, follow these steps to place your
online order:
1. Click Order Online.
You need to have an account to place an order.
2. When you select the online service for the first time, you are prompted
to set up an account. After your account is set up or if you already
have an account, enter your login information.
You find more details about setting up an online account in Chapter 14.
3. On the order page for the item, make sure you use one of the tem-
plates recommended on the help screen.
Figure 16-5 shows a help screen for placing an order for Photo Books.
4. Click Edit Book on the help screen if you need to change the template.
When you’re ready to proceed, click Purchase Book.
5. On the order screen, make some choices, such as book color, for the
product you are ordering; set the quantity that you want to purchase;
and review the total cost. Click Next when you’re finished.
6. If you want to share your creation with other users, you can identify
users’ names and addresses in the Recipients pane in the Order
Wizard. Click Next when you’re done.
7. Follow any remaining steps in the wizard to complete your order.

Figure 16-5: The Kodak EasyShare help screen provides recommendations 
for the design of your project.
E-mailing creations
After you put together a creation with the creation wizard, you can e-mail the
creation to your friends, family, or whomever you like by clicking the E-mail
button in the Share pane in the creation wizard. (We introduce this and other
ways to share creations in “Getting a Grip on Common Output Methods,” ear-
lier in this chapter.) 
When you want to e-mail a creation, follow these steps:
1. Click E-mail in a creation wizard.
The Attach Creation Item to E-mail dialog box opens, as shown in
Figure 16-6.
2. Click the Edit Contacts button.
3. In the window that opens, add any contacts you like. Click OK when
you’re done.
You can add a long list of contacts.

converted to a PDF document and downsampled when the PDF is created.
6. Click Next.
A dialog box opens, informing you of the file size and how long the recip-
ient’s e-mail will take to download your file, as measured on a 56Kbps
(Kilobytes per second) modem.
Be certain your recipients can receive large file sizes before sending the
creation via e-mail. 
7. Click OK in the dialog box that shows file information.
Your PDF file is sent to all the recipients you selected.
By default, Elements uses your primary e-mail client application, which may or
may not be the e-mail program you use. You can change the default e-mail client
by pressing Ctrl+K to open the Preferences dialog box when in the Organizer,
and clicking Sharing in the left pane. From a drop-down list in the Sharing
preferences, select the e-mail client application you want Elements to use.

Ten Tips for Composing 
Better Photos
In This Chapter
 Finding a focal point and using the Rule of Thirds
 Cutting the clutter and framing your shot
 Employing contrast, leading lines, and viewpoints
 Using light
 Giving direction
 Considering direction of movement
A
few things have to come together to make a great photograph. One
is being in the right place at the right time. Another is the
ability to tell a story. And yet another is excellent composi-
tion. Unfortunately, we can’t help with your schedule or
storytelling, but we can give you several easy tips on
how to take photographs that are interesting and well-
composed. Some of these tips overlap and contain
common concepts. But they’re all free; they don’t
require any extra money or equipment. All they take
are an open mind and an eye that is willing to be
trained over time.
Find a Focal Point
One of the most important tools for properly composing a
photo is establishing a focal point — a main point of interest. If
too many elements are competing for attention, a photo probably
doesn’t have a clearly defined focal point. Your eye, therefore, doesn’t know
where to look. Too many images without a focal point cause the viewer to tire
quickly or lose interest. The eye wants to be drawn to a subject.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Excessive background elements, like furniture, walls, tables, fences, build-
ings, and even random bystanders, don’t add much to the compositional or
emotional value of your shot. What you really want to capture are the smiles
and expressions of your family and friends.
Keep these tips in mind to help find your focal point:
 Pick your subject and then get close to it.
 Include a point of interest in scenic shots. Sunrises and sunsets are
pretty, but after you’ve seen a few, you’ve seen them all. Try to capture
an early morning fisherman casting his line off the pier or a child check-
ing out a rogue hermit crab at dusk. That once-ho-hum scenic shot now
has some visual punch.
 When appropriate, try to include an element in the foreground, middle
ground, or background to add depth and a sense of scale, as shown in
Figure 17-1. Just make sure it is a meaningful element and not random
clutter.
Brand X Pictures
Figure 17-1: Including elements in the foreground adds depth to a photo.

Use the Rule of Thirds
After you’ve found a focal point for
your shot, the next step is to try to
put that focal point, or subject, 
in a prime location within your
viewfinder or LCD display. Those
prime locations are based on a pho-
tographic principle called the Rule of
Thirds. If you divide an image into
a grid of nine equal segments, as
shown in Figure 17-2, the elements
most appealing to the eye and most
likely to be noticed first are those
that fall close to one of the four
intersections of the dividing lines. 
When composing your shot, try to mentally divide your frame into vertical
and horizontal thirds and position your most important visual element at any
intersecting point. When shooting landscapes, remember a low horizon cre-
ates a dreamy and spacious feeling, while a high horizon gives an earthy and
intimate feeling. For close-up portraits, try putting the face or eyes of a
person at one of those points.
If the Rule of Thirds is too hard for you to remember or employ, when you
look through the viewfinder, just repeat this mantra, “move from center.”
We all have a natural tendency to want to center everything. Get it nice and
orderly. But centered subjects are often static and boring. Asymmetry often
gives us more dynamic and interesting images.
If you have an autofocus camera, you’ll need to lock the focus when moving
from center because the autofocus sensor locks onto whatever is in the
center of the viewfinder — not on your point of interest. Autofocus can also
be problematic when trying to do something as simple as photographing
two people (in this case, you may want the two people in the center), and
your camera keeps focusing on the space in the distance between them.
Center your subject in the viewfinder and apply slight pressure to your 
shutter release button to lock the focus. Then, reposition your subject at
an intersecting point on the Rule of Thirds grid and press down all the way
to snap the photo.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Cut the Clutter
Contrary to supermarket tabloid covers, those telephone poles, branches, car
antennas, and other everyday objects do not naturally grow out of people’s
heads. Although these mergers, as photographers call them, are good for a
laugh, they’re not good enough to make it into picture frames and scrapbooks.
Here are some ways you can cut the clutter from your background:
 Get up close and personal. Most people worry about getting their
heads cut off when they get their photos taken. But more often than
not, people tend to capture too much boring or distracting background.
Fill your viewfinder frame with your subject. Although you can always
crop your image later, it’s better to try to get your subject to fill the
frame when you take the photo. 
 Shoot at a different angle. Yes, you can turn your camera! Most photos
are horizontal just for the mere fact that it is easier to hold the camera
that way. That’s fine for a lot of shots (such as the requisite group photo
and some landscape shots). But other subjects — buildings, trees, water-
falls, mountain peaks, giraffes, Shaquille O’Neal — lend themselves to a
vertical format.
 Move around your subject. Moving around may help eliminate unwanted
clutter. Shoot from below or above your subject if necessary.
 Move your subject, if possible, to get the optimum background.
Although there are exceptions, an ideal background is usually free
from distracting elements like tree branches, poles, wires, chain-link
fences, signs, bright lights, lots of loud colors, busy wallpaper, and so
on. Only include what complements your subject.
 Use background elements to
enhance, not distract. On the
other hand, if your background
is interesting and can make your
photo stronger, then include it.
You can use famous landmarks,
props, and even decorations in
the background to give context
to images, as shown in
Figure 17-3.
 Use space around a subject to
evoke a certain mood. A lot of
space around a person can give
a sense of loneliness, just as a
closely cropped portrait can
create a feeling of intimacy. Just
make sure the space is inten-
tionally used in the shot.
Figure 17-3: Use background elements, like
decorations, to help define an event and add
ambience to the subject.

 If you’re stuck with a distracting background, you can try blurring
it by using a wider aperture (like f/4 instead of f/11 or f/16) on your
camera. This makes the depth of field (areas of sharpness in relation to
your focal point) shallower so your subject is in focus, but the back-
ground isn’t.
Because consumer digital cameras use image sensors that are typically
one-third the size of a 35mm frame, the lens is very close to the sensor,
which really increases the depth of field. This can make it hard to blur
the background. Not a problem — you can also blur the background by
making a selection and using the Blur filter in Elements. See Chapters 7
and 10 for more on selections and the Blur filter.
Frame Your Shot
When appropriate, use foreground elements to
frame your subject. Frames lead you into a photo-
graph. You can use elements like tree branches,
windows, archways, and doorways to frame a wide
or long shot, add a feeling of depth, and create a
point of reference, as shown in Figure 17-4. You
don’t have to reserve the use of framing for wide
and long shots, however. Close-ups can also be
framed. Your framing elements do not always have
to be sharply focused. Sometimes, if they’re too
sharp, they distract from the focal point. And
remember to avoid mergers!
Employ Contrast
Just remember “light on dark, dark on light.” 
A light subject will have more impact
and emphasis if it is shot against a
dark background, and vice versa, as
shown in Figure 17-5. When viewing
an image, our eyes go to the area of
the most contrast first. Obviously,
sometimes finding contrast in the
environment is beyond your control.
But when setting up a shot, you can
certainly try to incorporate this tech-
nique. Keep in mind, however, that
contrast needs to be used carefully.
Sometimes it can be distracting, espe-
cially if the high-contrast elements
are not your main point of interest.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Using Leading Lines
Leading lines are lines that, either by
the actual elements in the image or by
the composition of those elements,
lead the eye into the picture and
hopefully to a point of interest.
These lines add dimension, depth
and perspective by carrying the eye
through the photo:
 Diagonal lines are dynamic and
evoke movement.
 Curves are graceful and 
harmonious.
 Horizontal lines are peaceful
and give a feeling of balance.
 Vertical lines are direct and
active.
The best leading lines are those that
enter the image from the lower left
corner. Many elements provide nat-
ural leading lines, especially in scenic
or landscape photos such as roads,
walls, fences, rivers, shadows, sky-
scrapers, and bridges. The photo in
Figure 17-6 of the Great Wall of China
is an example of curved leading lines.
Experiment with Viewpoints
Not much in the world looks fascinating photographed from a height 
of 5 to 6 feet off the ground. Unfortunately, this is the viewpoint of
“Snapshotville.” Try to break out of this mode by taking photos from
another vantage point. Experiment with taking a photo from above (bird’s-
eye view) or below (worm’s-eye view) the subject. A different angle may 
provide a more interesting image:
 Unexpected angles can exaggerate the size of the subject. The subject
may appear either larger or smaller than normal, as shown in Figure 17-7.
Try extreme angles with scenic shots, which otherwise can tend to be
rather static or boring.
Flat Earth
Figure 17-6: You don’t have to trek to China to
find leading lines, although you may not find a
longer unbroken curve than the Great Wall.

 Changing your viewpoint can
change the mood of the image. If
the photo in Figure 17-7 had been
taken from a front angle, it would
have been pretty dull. Taken from
below, looking up, exaggerates
the height and makes for a
stronger and more exciting com-
position, making the cactus
seem like nature’s skyscraper.
 Use direct eye contact when
photographing people. It pro-
vides a sense of realism and
makes the image more intimate
and warm, pulling you into the
photo. But remember that chil-
dren are not at the same eye
level as adults. We often shoot
down at them, making them
appear smaller than they really
are. Try kneeling or sitting on
the floor and getting down to
their level. You will also find
that you get a less distracting
background in the frame, and
the lighting from your flash will
more evenly cover the face.
Do the same for pets and other
short stature subjects, such as flowers.
Use Light
When we think of light in regards to photography, the first thing that comes to
mind are all those photos that we’ve taken in the past that are either overex-
posed (too light) or underexposed (too dark). With lighting, you have to not only
consider whether you have the right amount of lighting, but also these factors:
 The direction of the light
 The intensity of the light
 The color of the light
 Whether you’re shooting in natural light (outdoors) or artificial light
(indoors)
 How to use lighting creatively to lead the eye and create a certain mood

angles can exaggerate size, resulting in a more

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If the light isn’t right for your shot, you have quite a few choices — hurry up
and wait, move yourself, move the subject, add more light with a flash, or dif-
fuse light. Of course, which you choose depends on the circumstances of the
shot and what’s convenient or most productive. Here are a few tips to remem-
ber about light:
 The best light for photographs is in the early morning and later after-
noon. The light is warmer and softer and the shadows are longer and
less harsh.
 Avoid taking portraits at midday. The overhead sun causes ugly shadows
and makes people squint. If you must shoot then, use a reflector to block
some of the sunlight or fill in the shadow areas. Or you can use a scrim
(white translucent fabric stretched across a frame) to diffuse the light.
 Cloudy or overcast days can be great for photographing, especially
portraits. The light is soft and diffused and flatters the face.
 Shooting subjects with backlighting (where the lighting comes from
behind the subject) can produce very dramatic results. Figure 17-8
shows an example. If you want to see the details of the subject, and
not just a silhouette, use a fill flash to lighten the shadow areas.
 Watch that the brightest light source isn’t directed right into the lens.
This will cause lens flare, those strange light circles that appear in the
photo.
 Take into account the color of the light. The light at noon is white, the
light at sunset is orange, and the light at twilight is blue. The color of the
light can make an image feel warm or cool.

Figure 17-8: Backlighting can yield dramatic images.

 Use a flash when necessary. Use a flash in
low-light conditions. If your built-in flash
isn’t cutting the mustard, you may want to
invest in an accessory flash. 
 Finally, get creative with light. Look for
those unique compositions created by the
interplay between light and shadow areas or
how the light illuminates a particular sub-
ject. Lighting by itself can make or break
a certain mood or emotion. Think of a simple
beam of light coming through the roof of an
old barn. Even in the lousiest weather, the
most beautifully lit images can emerge.
When wet objects are lit, they seem to shim-
mer, as shown in Figure 17-9.
Giving Direction
When you look at magazines that feature the year’s best photos, they all
appear as instances of pure serendipity. Sometimes that’s the case, but more
often than not, the photographer arranged the shot or waited for the right
light or a special moment.
As a photographer, you also shouldn’t be afraid to play photo stylist:
 Give directions on where you
want people to stand, how to
stand, and so on. For example,
tell people to touch each other,
bring their heads towards
each other or put their arms
around each other, as shown
in Figure 17-10.
 Designate the location.
 Use props, such as trees or cars,
to arrange people around.
 Use a variety of poses. Have
some people sit and others
stand.
 If you are dealing with a large group of people, rambunctious kids,
or excited pets, get someone to help direct. Just make sure that the
parties being photographed pay attention and look at the camera.
 Try and get people to relax. While spontaneity can yield great images,
you can still get good photos from posed subjects if they aren’t hating
the experience.

Consider Direction of Movement
When the subject is capable of move-
ment, such as a car, person, or animal,
make sure you leave more space in
front of the subject than behind it,
as shown in Figure 17-11. Otherwise
the viewer may subconsciously 
experience a feeling of departure or
discomfort. You want to try to give
the person or object room to move
into the frame. Likewise if a person is
looking out onto a vista, make sure
you include that vista so the person
is given a point of view and the scene
is given context.

S
o you’ve posted all your holiday and vacation photos in a Web Gallery and
made enough albums, slide shows, and cards to keep your family and
friends content for months to come? Sounds like you may be ready to take a
crack at some other projects. In this chapter, you’ll find some ideas
on how you can use your inventory of digital images to make
your life more productive, more organized, and more fun.
Remember, this just scratches the surface. With a little
imagination, before you know it, there won’t be anything
left in your life that doesn’t include your photos.
Wallpaper and Screen Savers
If you like an image so much that you want to gaze at
it while you’re toiling away at your computer, why not
use that image for the background of your computer,
better known as the desktop wallpaper. If you can’t choose
just one favorite image, you can use several to create a multi-
image screen saver.

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
As we mention in Chapter 2, if you are serious about image editing, you really
should have a neutral gray background. But as long as your wallpaper isn’t
showing while you do your color corrections, feel free to decorate your desk-
top with your favorite colorful photo. You use just two easy steps to turn a
photo into wallpaper:
1. From the Organizer, select the photo you want to use.
2. Choose Edit➪Set As Desktop Wallpaper.
That’s all there is to it! Your photo has now been transformed into desk-
top wallpaper.
If you have two or more photos you want to use, you can create a Windows XP
screen saver. Here’s how to create a screen saver in Windows XP:
1. Select the desired photos from the Organizer.
2. Choose File➪Export.
3. Choose JPEG for your file type, select your photo size, and choose a
quality setting.
We recommend using a size that matches the resolution setting you’re
using for your monitor. Use a quality setting of 12 for maximum quality.
4. Click the Browse button.
5. Click the Make a New Folder button and save the photos as JPEGs to
that folder. Name the folder something appropriate, like screen saver.
6. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪Display.
Depending on how your computer is set up, you might have to double-
click Display to open it.
Sharing projects
Not into killing trees? Not to worry. You don’t have
to print every project you make. Any file you create
can be left as a purely digital file and e-mailed to
other users. From the Organizer or either Editor
mode, you can select files that you want to send
to recipients and choose File➪Attach to E-mail.
A dialog box opens, similar to the Attach Creation
Item to E-mail dialog box described in Chapter
16, but with some additional options.
From the Format menu, you have options for
sending your file as Photo Mail (HTML), Simple
Slide Show (PDF), or Individual Attachments.
The first option saves the file as HTML that
might be used for a Web page design. Other
options are to send the photos as a PDF file or
as a file attachment to an e-mail message.
Additionally, you have options for editing your
address book, selecting image quality, and
downsampling. You can add a message here, or
you can choose to type text in your new e-mail
message.
Click the Next button, and the file (according to
the format you choose) is attached to a new
e-mail message in your default e-mail program.

7. Click the Screen Saver tab and choose My Pictures Slideshow from the
pop-up menu under Screen Saver.
8. Click Settings and choose the folder you created in Step 5 that contains
your photos. Define the photo size and specify all your other options.
9. Click Preview to see how it will appear on your monitor.
Move your mouse or press a key to end the preview.
10. Click Apply and then OK to close the Display window.
Flyers, Ads, and Online Auctions
Everyone knows a picture is worth a thousand words. Whether you’re selling
puppies or advertising an open house, adding a photo to an ad or flyer really
helps to drive your message home.
Here are the abbreviated steps to quickly create an ad or flyer.
1. Choose File➪New➪Blank File.
2. In the New Document dialog
box, enter your desired docu-
ment specifications.
We recommend entering the
final dimensions and resolution
for your desired output. If you
want to print your ad or flyer on
your desktop printer or at a ser-
vice bureau, a good guideline for
resolution is 300 pixels per inch.
For more on resolution and
sizing images, be sure and check
out Chapter 3. If you want to fill
your background with color, as
we did in Figure 18-1, choose
Edit➪Fill Layer and choose
Color from the Contents pop-up
menu. Choose your desired
color in the Color Picker.
3. Open your photo or photos and
drag and drop it/them onto
your new canvas with the
Move tool.
Your image is automatically put on a separate layer. For more on layers,
see Chapter 8. If you want to use only a portion of the image, as we did
with the puppy in Figure 18-1, then use your favorite selection method to
pluck out your element. For more on selections, see Chapter 7.

4. Select the Type tool, click the canvas, and add your desired type.
5. When you’re done, choose File➪Save.
6. Choose Photoshop (.PSD) from the Format pop-up menu, make sure
the Layers option is checked, and click Save.
If you want to take your document to a service bureau or copy shop, like
FedEx Kinko’s, you should save your document as a Photoshop PDF (.PDF).
That way, you don’t have to worry about compatibility issues or printing
snafus.
If you’re preparing photos for online auction sites like eBay or Yahoo! Auctions,
be sure and keep your images low resolution — 72 ppi, to be exact — and at
100% scale. Save the file as a JPEG to ensure that your file stays lean and
mean while preserving colors. Be sure and check the image specifications
posted on your online auction site.
CD Labels and Jewel Case Covers
If you are burning a CD of images or a creation, why not also create a custom
label and/or jewel case cover that features a photo or two? There are many
inexpensive CD-labeling packages, which you can purchase at computer and
office supply stores, that come equipped with templates to use with a variety
of programs. If none of the templates works in Elements, try this workaround:
1. Take one of the label sheets and, with a black marker, draw around
the label areas.
2. Scan the sheet and save it as a Photoshop (.PSD) file.
3. Open the file in Elements and use it as your template by dragging and
dropping images onto your file.
4. Add your text on another layer.
5. When you’re done, simply drag the template layer to the trash and
print your file.
Clothes, Hats, and More
Many local copy shops, retail stores, and Web sites enable you to add photos
to T-shirts, hats, buttons, tote bags, ties, mouse pads, and many other items.
If you can produce it, they can put a photo on it. But it is easy, and less expen-
sive, to tackle this project yourself.
Buy plain white T-shirts at your local discount store or plain aprons and tote
bags at your craft or fabric store. Then buy special transfer paper at your

office supply or computer store. Print your photos on the transfer paper
(be sure and flip the images horizontally first), iron the print onto the fabric,
and you’ve got yourself a personalized gift for very little cash.
What do you get for the person who has everything? How about a blanket of
memories? You can transfer photos onto patches of fabric and create unique
memory quilts. What grandparent wouldn’t love a quilt with photos of her
children and grandchildren? 
Posters
For special events, important announcements, or maybe just your favorite
family photo, you can get posters and large-size prints at many copy shops
and service bureaus. Call and talk to a knowledgeable rep at your copy shop
or service bureau so you know exactly how to prep your file. Here are a few
questions to ask:
 What file format and resolution should the file be?
 What size prints do you offer?
 Do you provide mounting and lamination services?
In addition to printing large prints, many service bureaus will mount
prints on foam core or a sturdier material called gator board. These ser-
vice bureaus also can laminate prints to protect them from scratches
and UV rays. 
Household and Business Inventories
Don’t wait for a natural disaster or theft to get
you motivated to prepare an inventory of your
household or business assets. Take your digital
camera and shoot pictures of your items. Add
text to describe the items in the caption section
of the Organizer. Be sure and include makes,
models, purchase dates, and dollar values of
each piece. Then create a single PDF document
from those multiple files either by creating a slide
show or album, as shown in Figure 18-2. Upload
the PDF to a Web storage site or burn a CD or
DVD and place it off-site in a safety deposit box
or other secure location. If the need arises, the
PDF can be viewed by your insurance agent using
the free Adobe Reader software.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Project Documentation
Nothing helps to document a process like images. The spoken and written
word is great, but showing how something comes together is even more 
effective. Consider using your photographs to help document your projects
from beginning to end. Whether it is a project involving home improvement,
furniture building, crafts, or cooking, take photos at each stage to record
the project. If you are taking a class
or workshop and the instructors
don’t mind, take your camera to
class. Documenting the positions or
steps of that new yoga, pottery, or
gardening class will help you prac-
tice or recreate it on your own later,
either for yourself or to teach some-
one else.
Import the photos into the Organizer
and create notes on each step of
the project, either on the canvas
itself or in the caption area. Output
the images to a PDF slide show or
a PDF of album pages, as shown in
Figure 18-3.
School Reports and Projects
There’s nothing like some interesting photos to jazz up the obligatory
school report. Doing a botany report? Include some close-ups of a flower
with text labels on the parts of the flower. Have to write a paper on the
habits of the lemurs of Madagascar? Trek down to your local zoo and have
a photo shoot. Create a simple collage of lemurs eating, sleeping, and doing
the other things that lemurs do. In fact, buying your children their own inex-
pensive point-and-shoot cameras may give them a little more enthusiasm for
school work.
Wait, There’s More
Before we leave you to take your photos to the next dimension, here are a
few extra ideas: Make fun place cards for dinner party guests, create your
own business cards if you need only a few, design your own gift wrap and
tags, or label storage boxes with photos of their contents. The possibilities
are endless.

Exploring Audio and 
Video in Elements
In This Chapter
 Recording audio notes about your images
 Creating animated GIFs
 Setting up images for display on a television
F
or audio- and videophiles, this chapter is for you. We start off with
simple section about adding audio captions to your images. This is a
great feature for anyone who prefers a microphone to a keyboard or when
you want people you share your images with to hear your comments rather
than read them. (Chapter 6 is where we explain how to add text captions to
your images.)
If animation is more your thing, check out the section on
creating animations from GIF images. Elements make
creating animations easy to do: just assemble your
series of images onto layers and follow the steps in
this chapter to save your file.
Elements can also help you prepare your images to
display on a television. Because images display differ-
ently on a TV screen than your computer monitor, we
show you how to set up template to help you fine-tune
how your images look on the television screen — and
avoid any frustrating surprises. With your images ready
to go, all you need to do is follow the steps for outputting
your images in a TV-safe format. 

BC2
Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
Adding Audio Notes to Images in the Organizer
If you want to add an audio caption, you must have a microphone hooked up
to your computer and properly configured. When you’re ready, follow these
steps:
1. Open the Properties palette
and click the Audio icon in the
lower-left corner.
The Select Audio File dialog 
box opens, as shown in
Figure BC1-1.
2. To begin recording, click the
red circle and speak into your
microphone.
3. When you finish recording,
click the square button to stop.
4. You can use the controls to
move back and forth and hear
the audio before you decide to
add it as a caption.
5. To attach the audio file as a
caption, click the close box in
the Select Audio File dialog
box, and you are prompted to
save the file.
6. If you want to save the file as a caption, click Yes. Clicking No dis-
misses the dialog box without saving the audio as a caption.
You can also add audio files stored on your hard drive as captions with
images. In the Select Audio File dialog box, open the File menu and select
Browse. A dialog box opens, and you can browse your hard drive and select
a file to attach as an audio caption.
Adding Animation to Your Images
In Elements, you can create animations for rotating logos, changing faces or
scenes, or other effects. The only requirement is that the image must be a
multilayered single file.
To create an animation effect and save it as an animated GIF, you need to
work with layers, as we explain in Chapter 8. If you don’t know how to work
with layers in Elements, review Chapter 8 before creating the animation. After
Figure BC1-1: Click the Audio icon in the
Properties palette to open the Select Audio File
dialog box.

you understand how to work with layers, follow these steps to save a file as
an animated GIF.
1. In the Standard Edit mode, create a separate layer for each movement
in an animation.
For example, if you want to revolve a logo, add a new layer for each rota-
tion increment.
2. Choose File➪Save for Web.
The Save for Web dialog box opens (see Chapter 15 for more details about
Save for Web). For an animated GIF, you need to save in GIF format.
3. In the Preset area, select GIF and choose the number of colors to
appear in the image. 
4. Click the Animate check box in the Preset area.
5. In the Animation area of the Save for Web dialog box, select Loop to
play the animation in a continuous loop.
6. Set the interval in seconds for the delay between the layer views by
editing the Frame Delay text box.
7. To preview the layer view,
click the Selects next frame
button below the Frame Delay,
as shown in Figure BC1-2.
The Selects next frame button
appears with the vertical bar
and right pointing arrow.
8. Click OK.
The Save as Optimized dialog
box appears.
9. Select a target folder and name the file.
The file you save is an animated GIF. You can preview the animation by open-
ing the file directly in your Web browser. To add the GIF file to a Web page,
use a Web-authoring tool, like Adobe GoLive.
The Elements Soap Opera
Photoshop Elements provides you all the tools you need to create CDs or DVDs
of movie files. You can shoot still images with a digital camera, add some back-
ground music, make some fancy titles, and end up with a professional-looking
project. You can use the marvelous tools in Elements to create a great TV movie
as long as you follow some guidelines for preparing images.

Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
After spending a lot of time in Photoshop Elements editing and sizing images,
creating a slide show movie file, and writing the movie to a DVD, one of the
most discouraging situations you can find yourself in as a first-time filmmaker
is spending a lot of time in Photoshop Elements editing and sizing images,
creating a slideshow movie file, writing the movie to a DVD and then popping
that DVD in your DVD player only to find everyone’s head is cut off and half
the text missing. Fortunately, this section is here to help you avoid such a
problem.
Creating files for TV viewing
Before you start showing images on your television, you need to know some
specific details about images projected on TV screens. First off, images
shown on standard TV screens use a 1.33 aspect ratio, which means that
an image is 1.33 times wider than it is tall. If you intend to design files for
widescreen TVs, both standard and high definition, the ratio is 1.78; the
image should be 1.78 times wider than it is tall, such as a 16-x-9-inch image.
In addition to image dimensions, here are some key tips for making sure your
images look good on TV:
 Use TV-safe colors. Overly saturated colors display poorly on TV
screens. You need an NTSC (National Television System Committee) or
PAL (Phase Alternation by Line) color-safe palette. NTSC is used in
North America, Central America, and Japan. Most other countries
around the world use PAL.
To create a black
border for a TV-safe
template, be certain
to use RGB color
values less than 230
and greater than 16.
For RGB color values
that you want to
apply to text and
graphics, set the 
saturation to 17 in
the Color Picker
when selecting
colors, as shown in
Figure BC1-3. See
Chapter 12 for more
information on
selecting color.
Figure BC1-3: When selecting color for text and illustrations,
use a saturation amount no greater than 17 for an NTSC-safe
color.

The colors may look pale on your computer monitor, but they’ll look
much better on a TV screen than overly saturated colors.
 Choose a TV-friendly font for text. Avoid using serif fonts, especially
fonts with tiny serifs such as Times. You’ll find that fonts like Arial,
Helvetica, MS Sans Serif, and Lucida Sans, among others, work well. For
point sizes, don’t use a font size less than 18 points, with 24 to 32 points
being optimal.
 Avoid using thin horizontal lines. They’ll jump around on your TV.
 Pick the right resolution. Images shown on TVs won’t appear any
better than 72 ppi can deliver. Movie files can be large, so be certain
to downsample images to 72 ppi. (See Chapter 3 for more information
on downsampling images.)
Creating a TV-safe template
The best way to be certain your images fall within the TV-safe viewing area is
to create a template and use the template to size all your images. For a stan-
dard TV screen, you need a 4:3 image or multiple thereof with a 1.33 aspect
ratio.
To create and use a template, follow these steps:
1. In Standard Edit mode, choose File➪New➪Blank Image to open the
New dialog box.
2. Set the width to 8 inches and the height to 6 inches (this size is twice
the 4:3 ratio).
3. Set the resolution to 72 and the color mode to RGB color. (See Chapter 3
for details.)
4. Select Transparent from the Background Contents drop-down menu
and click OK.
The new document is created on a layer with transparency.
5. To create a border, choose Edit➪Select All to create a selection mar-
quee. Then choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
The Stroke dialog box opens.
6. Click the color swatch and select Black for the color. Click Center in
the Location area. Click OK.
A black stroke appears around the image.
BC5
Bonus Chapter 1: Exploring Audio and Video in Elements

BC6
Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
7. Choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size.
8. In the Canvas Size dialog box, be certain the center icon is selected
and add 10 for the width and 7.5 for the height. Click OK.
The canvas is resized.
9. To fill the border black, click the Magic Wand tool in the Tools palette
and click outside the border line you created in Step 6. 
The outside area becomes selected. 
10. Select Edit➪Fill Layer.
The Fill Layer dialog box opens.
11. Select Black for the Contents and click OK to create a template like
the one shone in Figure BC1-4.
12. Choose File➪Save to save the template.
Choose a filename like TVtemplate so you remember what this file is
for. To use the template with images you want to show on a TV, see the
next section.
Figure BC1-4: Keep the border in the image to show where the TV-safe 
area is and use the border as a reference for where you can place 
other images and text.

Prepping files for TV with the template
After you create the TV-safe template, which we explain in the preceding sec-
tion, getting your images ready to show on a TV is easy. Here are the steps for
using the template:
1. Open the template file.
2. Open an image in Standard Edit mode that you want to use as a slide.
3. Position the image windows so you can see both the template and the
image to be copied.
4. Select the Move tool in the Tools palette and drag the image to the
template.
The image appears on a new layer above the black border.
5. Open the Layers palette and drag the template layer up on top of the
image layer.
See Chapter 8 for details about working with layers.
6. Size the image to fit the canvas area.
If your image is much larger, you need to size the image down. Click the
image layer in the Layers palette to select that layer. Press Ctrl+T to
transform the image, as we discuss in Chapter 9. Press the Shift key and
drag a corner handle in to resize. Size the image so the image is a little
larger than the black border to avoid any empty space between the
image edge and the border edge.
7. Click More in the Layers palette and select Flatten Image.
8. Choose File➪Save As and save the file with a new name.
When you drag and drop files to the template, be certain that you size the
images with a little space between the important image content and the border.
For example, don’t place people’s heads at the edge of the border. Try to leave
about one-half to three-fourths inch between the border edge and where the
text and content appear.
Export a creation to a TV format
After creating a project designed for TV viewing, it’s time to output the file for
a TV screen. Outputting to TV creates a file similar to when you select Movie
File (.wmv) from the Save File option in the Slide Show Output Wizard. The
file eventually ends up as a movie file, but the file’s size is optimized for TV
viewing.
BC7
Bonus Chapter 1: Exploring Audio and Video in Elements

BC8
Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
To output to a TV file, do the following.
1. Open a project from the Organizer by double-clicking the file 
thumbnail.
2. Click Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor.
The Slide Show Output Wizard appears.
3. Type a name for
your TV file in the
Name text box
shown in Figure
BC1-5.
4. Select a file format
from the Settings
drop-down menu.
If you need help
deciding which
format to use, click
the Details button.
A dialog box opens,
showing information
on the format and
output size. If you
intend to export in
NTSC Standard or
PAL Standard, select
either Standard Definition (NTSC) or Standard Definition (PAL).
NTSC is the format used on video players in North America, Central
America, and Japan. All other countries use PAL video systems.
5. Click OK and Elements creates a movie file (.wmv).
After completion, you are prompted to add the video file to the
Organizer.
6. Click Yes and the file is added to the Organizer window and is ready
to write to a CD or DVD.
If you’re not sure how to burn files to CD or DVD, turn to Chapter 15 for
the details.

Making professional movies
Photoshop Elements does a great job of creat-
ing some quick videos using the creation
options. However, if you get serious about video
editing, you’ll want another tool designed specif-
ically for editing movie files. You have much
more editing opportunities for combining differ-
ent videos, editing audio, creating special
effects, and producing high-quality DVDs in pro-
grams designed for video editing.
Adobe makes a great offer in packaging
Elements with Adobe Premiere Elements.
Premiere Elements can be purchased for an
extra $50 when you buy Photoshop Elements.
Premiere Elements is a powerful editing tool for
creating professional-quality movies.
To add a little flair to your videos, you can create
CD/DVD labels in Elements and print them to
your desktop printer by using a low-cost CD
labeling kit that you can purchase at a computer
store or discount store. You can also purchase
DVD cases like those used in packaging com-
mercial DVDs. In Elements, you can create a
DVD sleeve to insert in the case, such as the
example shown here.
When you attend family weddings, bar or bat
mitzvahs, sporting events, or family reunions,
you can make videodiscs and distribute them as
gifts to friends and family, all for a few dollars
apiece for the material costs.

Setting Up a Web Photo Gallery
In This Chapter
 Setting up the gallery
 Uploading the gallery to the Web
You’ve seen Web sites that display small thumbnail images of photos. You
click a thumbnail image, and the respective photo opens on another Web
page in a larger view. What a great way to show your pictures to the world!
If you’re not an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) programmer or profes-
sional Web designer, you probably don’t have a clue as to how to create a
Web page with thumbnail images and link the thumbnails to larger pictures on
different Web pages. If this is true for you, don’t worry; Photoshop Elements
comes to the rescue.
Creating Your Web Gallery
Creating a Web Gallery in Photoshop Elements is an
extraordinary feature that completely automates the
process of creating Web pages of your images with-
out you having to know a single thing about Web
page design.
It’s wonderful, it’s simple, and here’s how you do it:
1. Load up the Organizer with a bunch of photos.
See Chapter 6 for creating Collections and Tags to
identify photos or just select the images you want to
use for your Web Gallery in the Organizer window.

BC12
Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
2. Click the Create
button in the
Shortcuts bar and
select HTML Photo
Gallery.
The Adobe HTML
Photo Gallery Wizard
opens, as shown in
Figure BC2-1.
3. Choose a Gallery
Style.
Look at the wonder-
ful styles you have
available from the
Gallery Style drop-
down menu. You can
select different styles
and see a preview
below the drop-down
menu to find the best
style for the selected
pictures that appear
as thumbnails in the left pane.
4. Fill in the text boxes for the banner information that will appear on
your Web page, including your e-mail address.
5. Click the Thumbnails tab and select the size you want the thumbnail
images to appear.
6. Add caption information by selecting check boxes to include the file-
names and captions.
For more information on creating captions, see Chapter 6.
7. Click the Large Photos tab to select the size and quality of the photos.
The large photos are the images that display on another Web page when
you click a thumbnail image. 
8. Click the Custom Colors tab and select the colors you want for the
Web page background, the banner color, the link colors (both active
links and visited links), and the text color for filenames and captions.
9. Click the Browse button to select a folder on your hard drive. Type a
name in the Site Folder text box for a new folder that Elements will
create. The new folder will be created inside the folder you select in
the Browse dialog box.
Figure BC2-1: Click the Create button in the Shortcuts bar
and select HTML Photo Gallery.

10. Click the Save button.
Elements automatically saves thumbnail images, large images, and
HTML documents to your selected folder.
Immediately after saving the creation, the HTML Photo Gallery Browser
opens, showing you the thumbnails page.
11. Preview the links by
clicking the differ-
ent thumbnails.
The respective
images are shown in
another window, as
you see in Figure
BC2-2.
12. Preview the images
in your Web
browser.
The files saved by
Elements include an
HTML document
saved as index. This
file is the first page
of your creation and
shows all the thumb-
nail images with the
links to the pages where the larger images appear. In addition to this
HTML document, Elements saves three folders for images, pages, and
thumbnails. To preview the Web pages, be certain to leave all files in
their respective folders and open the index file in your Web browser. In
the browser window, click the links to be certain they all work properly.
Uploading the Gallery to the Web
When your Web gallery is done, you need to upload the creation to your Web
site. To do so, you can use a utility for FTP (file transfer protocol). Here are a
few points to keep in mind:
 Be certain the path remains the same between the index file and the 
subfolders. 
 Note that you may want to put the index file and the folders all together
in a new folder. 
 If you upload the files to the root of your public_html directory, the
index file will overwrite your home page index file.

Viewing and Searching Metadata
In This Chapter
 Viewing metadata
 Searching metadata
M
etadata is information added to images by other devices, such as digi-
tal cameras. The information is recorded and written to a file when the
file is created. When you open the file, you typically don’t see the metadata
unless you have a program like Elements that can open the door to see what’s
behind the pixels and display information such as what camera took a picture,
what exposure was used, the date and time the picture was taken, aperture
values, whether the flash fired or not, and a good number of other metadata
information.
In Elements, you can view metadata in your photos, and you can also
sort files on metadata. We didn’t cover the sorting options for
metadata in Chapter 5 because we needed to give a little
more detail on what metadata is before you can get used
to searching metadata fields.
Viewing Metadata
Because metadata is unique to each image, you can
view the metadata for only one file at a time in the
Organizer. After selecting a file, open the Properties
palette either by choosing Window➪Properties or by
right-clicking a selected image and selecting Show
Properties. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard short-
cut Alt+Enter.

BC16
Photoshop Elements 4 For Dummies 
Metadata can be substan-
tial, and the tiny little
space you see in the 
document properties in
the Properties palette
requires you to scroll the
small space unless you
remove the palette from
the Organize Bin. When
viewing metadata, plan on
choosing Window➪Dock
Properties in Organize Bin
to remove the check mark
and release the palette
from the Organize Bin.
This frees the palette from
the docked position and
makes it a floating palette
in the Organizer work-
space. You can then resize
the palette by dragging
the lower-right corner out
to see more information,
as shown in Figure BC3-1.
(For more information on
floating palettes and resiz-
ing them, see Chapter 1.)
When the Properties palette is undocked from the Organize Bin, scroll the
window and observe the various items listed in the palette. Notice the camera
EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) format data. EXIF data describes information
about your camera and the settings used when a picture was taken. You see
items such as shutter speed, f-stop, focal length, camera type, and more. As
you scroll through the other areas in the Properties dialog box, you can see
information about the image, such as color profile used, filename, file size, bit
depth, and more.
Searching Metadata
All the information you see in the Properties dialog box is interesting but
doesn’t have much utilitarian value until you look at what you can do with
the data. Searching metadata helps you find pictures in large catalogs. With
metadata, you can do more than a simple search. Metadata searches can be
pretty complex, involving many variables.
Figure BC3-1: Choose Window➪Dock Properties in Organize
Bin to free the palette and then drag the lower-right corner
to expand the size.

To search metadata, do the following:
1. Open a catalog with a number of different photos taken with a digital
camera or scanned with your scanner.
You can acquire images in the Organizer window or use a catalog you
saved containing pictures taken with a digital camera or scanned with
your scanner. In this example we use pictures taken with a digital
camera.
2. Choose Find➪By Details (Metadata).
The Find by Details (Metadata) dialog box opens.
3. Select the first set of criteria.
From the Criteria drop-down menu, select an item to search. The second
menu offers options such as is, is not, and contains. Select the appropri-
ate choice from the menu commands.
The third drop-down menu offers options dependent on the search crite-
ria. For example, if you’re searching for a filename, the drop-down menu
changes to a text box in which you can type a filename. Other search cri-
teria provide menu choices for different options.
4. Add more sets of criteria.
Click the plus (+)
symbol and another
row is added, in
which additional cri-
teria can be selected
for searching. Notice
in Figure BC3-2 that
three rows of criteria
are specified for the
search.
5. Click the Search
button to start the
search.
If you want hidden files to be shown, check the box for Show Hidden
Photos. All photos meeting the criteria in the dialog box are returned in
a new Organizer window.
