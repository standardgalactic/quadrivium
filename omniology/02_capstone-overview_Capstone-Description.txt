In this lecture we will...
• Describe the various components and tasks of the 
capstone project

Capstone tasks
The Capstone project requires you to:
1. Harness your knowledge of machine 
learning, evaluation, and feature design
2. Implement four practical tasks on a real-
world dataset

Data to Products: Course 4: Implementing and Deploying data-driven predictive systems
Capstone tasks
The dataset you are given is a relatively large set of Amazon 
musical instrument reviews
•
The code stub already separates the data into “training” and “test 
portions”
•
You have to implement techniques that lead to good performance on 
the test set, but which are based only on data from the training set
•
In other words, you have to implement your own 
training/validation/test pipeline

Capstone tasks
The four tasks consist of the following:
1.
A basic data processing task
2.
A Classification task
3.
A Regression task
4.
A Recommender Systems task

Data to Products: Course 4: Implementing and Deploying data-driven predictive systems
Task 1: Data processing
For the data processing task, you must implement a variety of 
simple functions to compute basic statistics of the data. E.g.:
•
How many unique users are there in the dataset?
•
What is the average rating?
•
What fraction of reviews are verified?
•
For each of these tasks you must fill in a function stub

Task 2: Classification
For the classification task, you must predict whether an 
Amazon review corresponds to a verified purchase.
•
This is a binary classification task
•
The main challenge in this task is that the data are imbalanced – i.e., 
most reviews correspond to verified purchases
•
Thus we will use a balanced evaluation metric (the BER)
•
So, you must select classification techniques that lead to good 
performance on this evaluation metric
•
Your method should beat a simple baseline that performs logistic 
regression based on the length and rating of the review

Data to Products: Course 4: Implementing and Deploying data-driven predictive systems
Task 3: Regression
For the regression task, you must use word features (and 
other features) to perform sentiment analysis
•
This is a regression task (rating prediction)
•
The main challenge in this task is to properly avoid overfitting, 
since you will be using high-dimensional features
•
To do this, you will have to carefully implement a train/validation/test 
pipeline
•
You will also have to carefully engineer your features to consider the 
different choices when pre-processing text
•
You should beat a simple baseline that considers the 100 most 
popular words only

Data to Products: Course 4: Implementing and Deploying data-driven predictive systems
Task 4: Recommendation
For the recommendation task, you must predict ratings that 
users will give to items
•
This is a recommender systems task (predict a rating given a user 
and an item)
•
The main challenge in this task is to correctly implement a 
complex model
•
Again you will have to be careful about overfitting, as well as 
initialization
•
Your solution should outperform a simple bias-only model

Capstone project: evaluation
For all tasks, your goal is to beat the baselines given on the 
test set
•
Beating these solutions on the training set should be easy – you can 
make small modifications to the existing techniques.
•
However these performance gains may not translate well to the test 
set unless you are careful about overfitting and correctly 
implementing a validation pipeline
•
To do so will require leveraging several ideas from throughout this 
Specialization
