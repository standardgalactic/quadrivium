About the Author
Dan Gookin has been writing about technology for 20 years. He
has contributed articles to numerous high-tech magazines and
written more than 100 books about personal computing technol-
ogy, many of them accurate.
He combines his love of writing with his interest in technology to
create books that are informative and entertaining, but not boring.
Having sold more than 14 million copies translated into more than
30 languages, Dan can attest that his method of crafting computer
tomes does seem to work.
Perhaps Dan’s most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies,
published in 1991. It became the world’s fastest-selling computer
book, at one time moving more copies per week than the New York
Times number-one best seller (although, because it’s a reference
book, it could not be listed on the NYT best seller list). That book
spawned the entire line of For Dummies books, which remains a
publishing phenomenon to this day.
Dan’s most recent titles include Troubleshooting Your PC For
Dummies, 2nd Edition; C All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies;
PCs For Dummies, 9th Edition; Buying a Computer For Dummies,
2005 Edition; Dan Gookin’s Naked Windows XP; and Dan Gookin’s
Naked Office. He also publishes a free weekly computer newsletter,
“Weekly Wambooli Salad,” full of tips, how-tos, and computer news,
and he maintains the vast and helpful Web page www.wambooli.com.
Dan holds a degree in communications and visual arts from the
University of California, San Diego. He lives in the Pacific Northwest,
where he enjoys spending time with his four boys in the gentle
woods of Idaho.

PCs For Dummies Quick Reference, 3rd Edition

Part II
The Big Picture
The Personal
Computer
I
n the 1960s, you could stun guests in your home with a color
television set, but they would experience apoplexy at the sight
of a computer there. Even in the 1980s, the appearance of a
home computer was often met with a head-shaking “Whatever”
by anyone you tried to impress. Yes, at one time, it was easy
to pluck the PC out of the big picture. It was unusual. It was
unexpected.
Today, the PC is as much a part of the big picture as a paper
shredder in a law office. Yet, despite its ubiquity, the PC main-
tains an air of mystery and the scent of fear.
In this part, I pull together the pieces parts of a PC and give you
a visual tour, some basic understanding, and some examples of
what a computer can do. It’s your preview of coming attractions
to a device that’s useful, fun, and even (dare I say?) friendly.
In this part . . .

The Basics

The Big Picture: The PC
BP-2
What You See: Basic Hardware
A computer isn’t really a single thing. It’s a collection of things all clustered
together and connected by various ugly cables. Each of these separate compo-
nents makes up your computer system.
The central item in the computer system is the console, which is the main box
that just about everything else plugs into. Other items surrounding the con-
sole are referred to as peripherals. Some are required, some are optional.
There’s enough variety and potential so that just about every computer
system can be unique, customized for the needs of each computer owner.
Though the computer system you have, or may be looking at, is unique to you,
all computer systems have a basic set of peripherals and options attached, as
illustrated in the nearby figures. Here are the basic components you should
recognize and know by their official names:
Console: See Part I
Keyboard: See Part XI
Monitor
Mouse: See Part XII
Speakers (2)
Ugly cables
(’round back)

BP-3
The Big Picture: The PC

Console: The centerpiece of any computer system, which houses the
main circuitry board, microprocessor, memory (RAM), disk drives, plus
lots of connectors for everything else. It’s the box-o-guts! Also called the
system unit and often mistakenly referred to as the CPU. See also Part I.

Monitor: The computer’s display. It can sit on top of or to the side of the
console. This part of the basic computer system is necessary because
it’s how you see the information the computer displays.

Keyboard: The thing you type on, and one method for you to send infor-
mation to the computer. Despite all its graphics, most of the time you
spend using the computer involves typing. See also Part XI.

Mouse: The gizmo that helps you work with graphical images that the
computer displays on the screen. It’s the second method you use for
entering information (next to the keyboard). See also Part XII.

Speakers: The PC speaks! And squawks, and plays music, and often
talks. To hear that stuff, you need speakers. These can be either external
or part of the monitor. See also Part I.

Printer: The device that puts your work down on paper — documents,
copies of e-mail messages, charts, graphics, photos, or anything else
your creative heart desires. See also Part VIII.

Lots of ugly cables: Rarely seen in the showroom and never in ads,
although they exist! Cables! Lots of ugly cables keep everything con-
nected. They’re usually found ’round back of the console and other
components. Yes, even on wireless systems, there are still lots of cables.
See also Part I.
Printer: See Part VIII

The Big Picture: The PC
BP-4
A computer system can include a variety of other devices and gizmos beyond
the basic items mentioned here. These peripherals include scanners, digital
cameras, external disk drives, modems, and a host of other gadgets various
and sundry.
What You See: Console — the Front
The console is the star in your computer’s solar system, the central hub of
activity. Every other device, gizmo, or gadget in the computer system plugs
into the console in one way or another. The console is also home to many of
your PC’s most important parts.
The illustration shows important items on the front side of the console. These
are things you should be able to locate and identify on your own computer,
though their specific locations may be different from what you see here.

The Big Picture: The PC

CD-ROM or DVD drive: This is one of your computer’s disk drives,
designed for CD or DVD disks. Note that you may have more than one of
these drives, such as both a CD and DVD drive. The drive may also be
hidden behind a panel or door.

Future expansion: You can add additional disk drives or devices to the
console. They may be obvious or well-hidden by using the console’s
design.

Floppy drive: Not every PC sold today has a floppy drive, but if yours
does, it appears somewhere on the front of the console. This drive is
designed to accept floppy disks.

Air vents: The thing’s gotta breathe!

Secret door/connectors: Many consoles have special connectors on the
front for USB devices, digital video (IEEE 1394), and audio connectors.
These may be obvious on the front of the console or hidden behind a
door or panel, or they may not exist at all.

Buttons and lights: The console has at least one button and some lights.
Additional buttons may appear on some consoles, as with additional
lights. The following list highlights some of the more common buttons
and lights:
• Power button: This button is used to start up the computer,
turn the computer off, or do any of a number of other things.
See also Part III.
• Reset button: This button lets you take control during times
of woe, by essentially forcing the computer to stop and start
in one swift punch. It’s a powerful button, though not every
console has one.
• Sleep button: This button appears mostly on laptop PCs and
is used to put the system into a special sleep, or Stand By,
mode. Few consoles have such a button, yet the sleep icon
may appear as a light on the console, to indicate that the
computer is not off, but, rather, “asleep.”
• Hard drive light: This light flashes as the hard drive is being
accessed. Because hard drives are often buried internally,
the light provides a visual clue to whether the drive is alive
or dead.
• Power light: This is merely a light on the console that is on
when the computer is on. If your computer doesn’t make
much noise, this light is often your only clue that the sucker
is turned on.

BP-6
This list doesn’t cover everything you could possibly find on the front of your
computer. For example, your console may also have an Infrared port for com-
municating with a laptop or handheld computer. Even so, become familiar
with those few items mentioned in the list. Many computer manuals and soft-
ware instructions assume that you know where everything is and what it’s
called.
What You See: Console — the Back
When it comes to the computer console, the back is definitely more important
than the front, and also far uglier. That’s where most of the computer’s compo-
nents connect to the console. But other things are worth noting as well:

Power connector: The power cord that plugs into the wall gazinta here.

Fan: Air gets sucked into here, to keep the insides of the console cool.

Voltage switch: Some power supplies have two operating frequencies.
This switch needs to be set only once to match the proper voltage for
your country.

Expansion slots: These are where add-on components and options are
installed inside the console. You cannot see them directly, though the
slot covers are visible on the back of the console, as shown nearby.

Expansion cards: These items plug into the expansion slots and reveal a
part of themselves on the console’s rump, such as the DVD expansion
card shown in the illustration.

Vents: That breathing thing again.

I/O Panel: Modern PCs put all their connectors in one central location,
called the I/O panel. It contains holes for plugging in a variety of good-
ies. See also Part I to find out what the holes are called and what plugs
into them.
The I/O panel may be in one location, as shown in the illustration, or it may be
split up into separate areas. For example, you may have one location for the
mouse and keyboard connectors, plus another location for other items that
attach to the console.
Note that the video connector (for the monitor) is found on either the I/O
panel or an expansion card. If it’s found in both places, use the connector on
the expansion card.
What You See: Console — the I/O Panel
I/O is computer-talk for input and output. The computer’s world is all about
input and output, and because the console is the center of your computer’s
world, it plays a major role in that input/output thing. Primarily, the other
devices that communicate with the console, to provide it with input or offer it
a spot for output, connect to the console, on the console’s rear, in a location
referred to as the I/O panel.
Here are few of the items you can find on the I/O panel:

Keyboard connector: Where the keyboard plugs into the console. USB
keyboards can plug into the USB port as well.

Mouse connector: Where the mouse plugs into the console, though USB
mice can plug directly into the USB port.

USB port: The ever-versatile USB port for the multitude of USB devices
to connect to your computer. See also Part II.

COM (or serial) port: This once highly versatile connector is now used
primarily for external modems and some computer mice. Some consoles
may have two COM ports, labeled COM1 and COM2. In the olden days, it
was called the RS-232C port. This port’s connector has nine pins.

Video connector: This is where the monitor connects to the console. It’s
the same size as the COM port, but sports up to 15 holes. Note that a
secondary video connector may be on the back of an expansion card. If
so, use that one instead.

S-Video out: This connector is used for video output, primarily on PCs
with DVD drives or high-end video. You would use the S-View out port to
connect the PC to a TV set. (This port isn’t shown in the illustration.)

SPDIF In/Out: These ports are used to connect the console to high-end
audio devices, such as an external sound processor or a stereo system.
The connectors use fiber optics to carry the sound signal, which is less
susceptible to outside noise than traditional wire connectors. SPDIF
stands for Sony/Philips Digital Interconnect Format.

Microphone jack: You can plug an optional microphone into this jack for
recording your voice or using voice control software.

Line In jack: This audio input is used for connecting the PC’s sound
system to your stereo or VCR, for capturing audio and other sounds.

Headphones/speaker jack: This is where you plug in a set of head-
phones, to listen privately to your computer, or plug in a set of speakers,
for more public listening.

Modem: This hole is where you plug a standard phone cord, to connect
your computer to the phone jack in the wall. That way, the computer’s
internal modem can use the telephone to contact the Internet. Modem
holes can also be found on expansion cards in some PCs.

Phone: This hole is usually found next to the modem jack. It’s where you
can connect a standard telephone so that you can use a real phone on
the same line as the computer. This jack isn’t available on every console.
Consider it a bonus.

Ethernet: This is where the computer connects to a network, or where
you connect the computer to a cable or DSL modem. (Networking and
the Internet are very similar things.) This hole for this port, also known
as an RJ-45, may also appear on the back of an expansion card. See also
Part IX.

Printer port: The printer plugs in here. This port is also called an LPT,
or Centronics, port. That’s for the old-timers.

IEEE 1394 ports: These ports are similar to USB ports in that they
accept a variety of high-speed add-ons, such as external disk drives,
scanners, and videocameras. The smaller of the IEEE 1394 ports, called a
1394 “mini,” is used primarily to connect digital video. These ports may
also be known as FireWire.

Joystick port: This port can be found on some older PCs, used primarily
to connect the old-style joysticks or MIDI musical devices. Today, most
of those gizmos are connected by using USB ports.
For more information on plugging stuff in, see also Part I.

I/O Symbol Table
Connectors, connectors everywhere! They can look similar, or they can be
confusing as all get-out. Fortunately, the computer industry understands how
confusing connectors can be. To make things easier, many connectors on a PC
console not only have unique shapes, but are color coded and often flagged
with a specific icon, as shown in the handy nearby table.
Note that the colors aren’t an established standard, so some PCs may sport a
different color scheme than what’s indicated. Also, not every connector is
color coded.
Also note that different icons or symbols may be used on different PCs.

The Basics: What Is a PC?
PC is an acronym for Personal Computer, so any type of personal computer,
from a handheld or palm computer to a laptop to a desktop and, yes, even the
Apple Macintosh, is a personal computer. As long as one person is using the
computer, it’s a personal computer, or PC.
Specifically, the type of computer now labeled a PC is the direct ancestor of
the original IBM PC, introduced back in the early 1980s. Though there were
other personal computers at that time, they were referred to as microcomput-
ers and were used mostly by computer enthusiasts and home hobbyists.
When IBM introduced its own microcomputer, it legitimized the microcom-
puter and made it “safe” for use in a business environment. Because of the
IBM PC’s tremendous popularity, it became the standard for all microcomput-
ers. Eventually, any computer that was compatible with the original IBM PC
(the computer could use the same hardware and run the same software) also
was dubbed a PC.
The PC is now the standard computer platform around the world, so much so
that being PC or IBM compatible is no longer an issue. Unless the computer
says Macintosh or Sun on its case, it’s a PC.
Internally, the computer is really nothing more than a very fast, expensive cal-
culator with a larger display and far more buttons. The computer system is
composed of two main parts: hardware and software.
Hardware
Hardware is the physical part of the computer. If you can touch it, it’s
hardware.
The main piece of hardware is the computer’s microprocessor, also called the
central processing unit, or CPU. All other hardware inside the computer (the
console) is designed to support and serve the microprocessor.
The current type of microprocessor used in the typical PC is the Pentium.
There are other variations of this chip as well, given other names depending
on the manufacturers and the chips’ ability, but Pentium is the big name.
Supporting the Pentium is more hardware. For storage, there’s computer
memory, or RAM, as well as disk drives. There’s also a chipset, which consists
of various support hardware that helps control the computer’s monitor,
networking, power management, and other hardware. All this stuff exists
inside the console and lives on a large sheet of green fiberglass called the
motherboard.

BP-13
The Big Picture: The PC
Software
Hardware by itself is dumb. That’s because computer hardware must be con-
trolled by software. Contrary to popular myth, the computer’s microprocessor
(hardware) isn’t the computer’s “brain.” The computer’s brain (if any) is the
software that controls and runs the hardware.
The main piece of software in a computer is its operating system. That’s the
main control program. For most PCs, the operating system is Windows, pro-
duced by Microsoft Corporation. Other operating systems can also be used on
a PC, such as Linux and others, but Windows is by far the most popular PC
operating system.
Other software comes in the form of applications or programs that carry out
specific tasks. By using various programs, you can direct the computer to per-
form a variety of services. Indeed, it’s this versatility that has kept the PC pop-
ular and useful over the past 25 years or so.

Computer software is nothing more than instructions that tell the hard-
ware what to do, how to act, or when to lose your data.

Although computer software comes on disks (CDs or floppy disks), the
disks aren’t software. Software is stored on disks just as music is stored
on cassettes and CDs.

You never have to learn about programming to use a computer.
Someone else does the programming; then, you buy the program (the
software) to get your work done.
You
That last part of your computer system is you, the computer operator.
Though software controls the hardware, it’s you who controls the software, by
telling it what you want done.
The computer does whatever you want it to do. Its flexibility and potential is
really unlimited. If you want a system to help you compose music, you can
assemble the proper hardware and software to make that happen. If you want
to run a business, that can be done too. The flexibility and configuration pos-
sibilities of the PC are endless, which is why the PC has remained the best-
selling, most useful computer platform in the universe.

BP-14
The Basics: Types and Models of PCs
There’s no such thing as the typical PC. Not only does each manufacturer add
its own touches of design and style, but different and various configurations
are available. They’re all PCs, but how they look and — most importantly —
how they sit on your desk divides them into various subclasses. Here’s the
rundown:

Desktop: The original IBM PC sat flat and square on top of a desk, which
is why that and similar modes are referred to as desktop computers.
Typically, the monitor is set right on top of the slablike console.

Desktop (small footprint): This is basically the same arrangement as the
traditional desktop, though the console is considerably smaller — often,
too small to set the monitor atop the console. The footprint refers to
how much desk space the console occupies.

Minitower: This is the most popular PC configuration, which is essen-
tially a small-footprint desktop on its side, though the PC isn’t really
sideways. The console is small enough to sit on top of your desk, with
the monitor sitting right next to it.

Notebook or laptop: This is a portable version of the PC, usually the
size of a typical three-ring binder or coffee-table book. Yes, they manage
to squeeze everything in a desktop PC into a portable, battery-powered,
convenient unit. Despite their heftier price tags, laptops are very popu-
lar and often outsell desktop PCs.

Towers: An older style of PC that can still be found is the tower unit,
which is like the minitower, but considerably taller and with more room
inside the console. These boxes are mostly found in the “back office” of
businesses, where they control the network or are used to prop up one
end of a wobbly table.
The Basics: Inside the Console
You find nestled inside the console the core elements of a computer. These are
the basic elements of the computer system, the electronic orchestra through
which the PC plays its tune. The location of these gizmos varies from com-
puter to computer, but, if you’re curious, the following list details some of the
more important elements:

Power supply: This item serves two purposes. First, it converts the AC
current from the wall into DC current to drive the motherboard and
devices inside the console. Second, the power supply houses the fan
that keeps the console’s insides cool. The power supply connects to
each internal disk drive as well as to the motherboard. It also connects
to the power button.

BP-15
The Big Picture: The PC

Motherboard: This is the main circuitry board inside the console, the
home base for the PC’s microprocessor, memory, chipset, and other
vital components.

Disk drive cage: This metal structure is used to hold the various disk
drives installed in the console as well as provide space for more disk
drives.

CD-ROM/DVD drive: The drive is installed in the disk drive cage, but in
one of the places where the drive can be accessed from outside the
console (so that you can insert and remove CDs or DVDs). The drive
also connects to the power supply and to a special connector on the
motherboard.


Hard drive: This drive lives inside the console’s drive cage, but doesn’t
need to have access to outside the case. The hard drive is connected to
the power supply and the motherboard.

Floppy drive: Like the CD-ROM/DVD drive, this drive is installed in the
console’s drive cage with outside access. The floppy drive is connected
to the power supply and the motherboard.

Memory: The computer’s memory, or RAM, is installed into a series of
banks on the motherboard. Memory comes in tiny expansion card
modules, called DIMMs. These plug into corresponding slots on the
motherboard.

Microprocessor: This is the main chip. The boss. The CPU. All the other
electronics inside the console are designed to work well with and serve
the microprocessor. Today’s PCs come with high-speed, high-power
microprocessors that require extra cooling; the microprocessor wears a
special little fan like a hat, which helps keep it cool.

Chipset: One or more computer chips on the motherboard supply
the computer’s basic personality (so to speak). These chips control
input/output (I/O) as well as the basic configuration of the computer’s
monitor, keyboard, mouse, networking, and other main components.

Expansion slots: Designed for internal expansion of the computer,
expansion slots aren’t as plentiful as in years past. This is because most
of the features previously added via expansion cards (networking,
modem, more memory) are now part of the chipset on the motherboard.
Even so, expansion slots remain inside the console and allow you to fur-
ther add to or configure your PC. Expansion cards plug into expansion
slots, like adding new shelves inside a cupboard.
There are three types of expansion slots:
• ISA: The traditional type of expansion slot of ancient design (avail-
able on the first IBM PC, 25 years ago), and still used today for many
simple hardware add-ons. ISA stands for Industry Standard
Architecture. A typical PC has at least one of these slots available.
• PCI: A more advanced type of expansion slot than ISA. PCI stands
for Peripheral Component Interconnect. Most PCs have at least one
of these slots, if not more. (It depends on the size of the console.)
• AGP: An expansion slot designed specifically for advanced, high-end
graphics cards. AGP stands for Accelerated Graphics Port. Not every
motherboard has this slot. (Lesser graphics adapters plug into a PCI
slot or are included in the chipset.)

BP-17
The Big Picture: The PC

I/O: The motherboard’s reach extends beyond the console’s physical
space, thanks to a host of I/O ports and connectors, located on the back
and often the front of the console. These connectors are plugged into
the motherboard via special cables.
There are many more technical details about your console’s innards and the
motherboard specifically, most of which aren’t really necessary to know for
the casual computer operator.
Be aware of your computer’s microprocessor and its name and horsepower.
Often, this information is displayed when the computer first starts — though
you have to be quick to catch it.
It also helps to know the quantity of RAM installed in the console. Computers
crave RAM, especially when they’re running high-end graphics programs or
complex computer games.
The expansion slots provide a way to add more internal components to your
PC, though for starting out, the motherboard contains just about everything
you need. Still, be aware that it’s possible to add more features and abilities by
simply purchasing and installing a new expansion card. See also “The Basics:
Adding Hardware.”
It isn’t necessary to open your PC. Please do not do so unless directed to by
tech support or when you’re installing or upgrading your computer. When
doing so, be sure to turn off and unplug the console before opening it up and
looking inside.
The Basics: Adding Hardware
The beauty of the computer is that it can be endlessly expanded or upgraded.
The computer you own today probably won’t look the same a month or a year
down the road. It’s the PC’s ability to be expanded and improved on that has
made it one of the most successful computer hardware designs ever.
There are two ways to add new hardware to your computer system: internally
or externally.
Internal expansion
Internal hardware is added to the PC by plugging an expansion card into one
of the expansion slots on the console’s motherboard. At one time, this was
about the only way you could add more memory, better video, networking, or
a special modem. Today, however, most of that stuff is included with the
chipset on the motherboard. Even so, expansion slots remain for many pur-
poses, which allows you to customize your PC any way you want.

The Big Picture: The PC
BP-18
Popular expansion cards let you add video support for a second monitor, a
more advanced video adapter, a secondary network adapter, a satellite
modem card, custom sound cards, cards to support more disk drives, cards
to add more ports (USB/IEEE) — the variety is almost endless.
Beyond expansion cards, your console may have extra room for more memory
or disk drives inside its drive cage. It may even be possible to replace the
microprocessor with a better, faster version (though such an upgrade is often
financially impractical).
Before going nuts, however, ensure that your PC has ample internal expansion
options. The drive cage must have room for an extra hard drive, for example.
And, you need to ensure that you have open expansion slots — and slots of
the right type — for whatever expansion card options you crave.
If expansion is your goal, get a minitower or full-size tower PC. Those models
often come with more expansion slots and drive cage “bays” than the smaller-
format PCs.
External expansion
Everything that plugs into the console can be considered external expansion,
though certain key parts of the PC aren’t really expansion “options.” The key-
board, mouse, and monitor are necessary to the PC’s basic operations. Even
the printer and modem can arguably be considered basic PC components and
not expansion options.
Generally speaking, true expansion options plug into the PC via one of the
ports — usually, the USB port. The IEEE port is also popular. Once upon a
time, the COM, or serial, port was popular as well, but these days external
expansion of your PC system is most likely done by adding a device, or a
number of devices, to the USB or IEEE ports.
The most popular external expansion options are as follows:

Scanners: The scanner lets you create a graphical image for the com-
puter by using anything that’s flat. You can scan old photographs or
your kid’s artwork or even use the scanner with special software to
read text.

Digital cameras: You can connect a digital camera to your computer for
copying, or downloading, images. After they’re in the computer, you can
photo-edit those images, e-mail them, create a slideshow, print them, or
do a number of miraculous things.

Videocameras: You can connect a videocamera to your PC directly for
use in online chats or for online meetings, by creating your own
webcam. You can also connect a videocamera to transfer your home
movies. Special software can be used to edit those movies and create
your own DVDs.

BP-19
The Big Picture: The PC

External hard drives: This is possibly the most popular external expan-
sion item to add to a PC, because adding the extra storage doesn’t
involve opening the console’s case. By using the USB or IEEE port, you
can add one or several external hard drives to your PC, to make more
storage available for your videos, music, photographs, or anything you
create with your PC.

External CD and DVD drives: Another popular item to add is another
CD or DVD drive, especially one that can record CDs or DVDs. Adding
these drives externally is much easier than adding one internally, espe-
cially for the beginner.
Numerous other expansion options exist. In fact, the list is long enough that it
would make quite a thick book by itself. For the variety, simply check a com-
puter catalog, online store, or retail computer store near you. See also Part I
for information on connecting things to the console.
The Basics: Windows
The computer’s operating system, Windows, is in charge of the entire com-
puter. It does things you would never imagine, menial tasks and duties that are
obscure yet necessary. Fortunately, Windows has been honed over the years,
and, despite the complexity of the PC, with Windows in charge, your duties as
a computer operator aren’t really that complex or involved.
Basically, Windows has four duties:

Present an interface for you, the human, to use the computer. This
interface is the desktop, used to display information and graphically rep-
resent things inside the computer.

Manage the computer’s hardware. This is pretty much an automatic
chore, though Windows lets you manipulate certain hardware settings,
such as the monitor’s resolution or whether your stuff is printed long-
ways or tallways on the printer. But most of the mundane things — keep-
ing the time, fetching information from disk, performing minor
maintenance — are done in the background automatically.

Manage software. The applications you install rely on Windows as a
bridge between what they do and the hardware inside the PC that makes
all that stuff possible. Windows also prevents programs from running
amok and, when they do, keeps them contained as best it can so that the
system doesn’t come crashing down.

Manage the files and stuff you create. Windows helps you store infor-
mation on your computer so that you can find it again later when you
need it. It helps you keep track of things and provides tools to help you
organize and order all your stuff.

The Big Picture: The PC
BP-20
Most of the time you use Windows, you work in your applications programs
and process words, work a database, send e-mail, and do other typical com-
puter tasks. You use Windows occasionally to set up or reconfigure your com-
puter’s hardware, add new software, or work with the files you create. Beyond
that, Windows is simply the program in charge. See also Part IV, which tells
you where important things are located in Windows.
The Basics: The Internet
Once upon a time, the Internet was considered a minor part of the PC’s exis-
tence. Today, PCs and the Internet walk hand-in-hand. Using the Internet, par-
ticularly e-mail, is the number-one reason that most people buy a new PC.
Because of this, all new PCs come equipped with all the hardware you need to
access the Internet. All the software (or most of the important programs) also
comes with the operating system, Windows.
The Internet itself isn’t a computer. The Internet is not a program or any soft-
ware you can own. Instead, the Internet is hundreds of thousands of comput-
ers all over the world. They’re connected together and they share, store, and
swap information.
You can use your PC to access the Internet, where your computer joins the
thousands of others already on the Internet. After it’s connected, you use vari-
ous software programs to access information on the Internet. These are the
most common programs or things accessed on the Internet:

The World Wide Web: This is a convenient way to view information
stored on computers all over the world. The Web displays information
the same as you would read text in a newspaper or magazine: very
friendly with pictures. The various Web pages also contain links to other,
related information or similar Web pages. Visiting those pages is as easy
as clicking the links.

E-mail: Everyone using the Internet can send or receive messages by
using electronic mail, or e-mail. Accounts are available all over, and
many at no charge. By using e-mail, you can send messages to other
Internet users as well as send files, photos, music, videos, and just about
any type of information imaginable.

File transfer: The Internet is a vast library of stored files and informa-
tion. You can access those files by transferring them from the Internet
into your computer. Some of the files are free programs you can use to
further expand the abilities of your PC.
You use a modem — either a dial-up modem or a high-speed cable, DSL, or
satellite modem — to gain access to the Internet. You can also get on the
Internet through a local-area network, as long as the network is connected to
the Internet. (This is how you get on the Internet at large companies or at
school.)

BP-21
The Big Picture: The PC
For most individuals and home users, you need to sign up for Internet service
with an ISP. These are local or national companies whose purpose is to con-
nect folks to the Internet — like a cable company offers you cable TV. (In fact,
most cable TV companies also offer Internet access.) ISPs are listed in the
Yellow Pages.
The only other thing you need to access the Internet is money; ISPs, like the
cable company, require a monthly fee. (It’s possible to use the Internet for free
at a public library, but that’s not this book’s subject.)
The Basics: Your Stuff
Having a PC is about Windows, the Internet, and software, but all that really
boils down to you and the stuff you create or collect. That information is
stored on the computer in the form of files.
A file can contain any type of information. For example, a file can be a simple
text document. It can be a list of folks you want to invite to a party. A file can
also be a graphical image, a song, a movie. Programs are files. This chapter is
a file on my computer. Files are chunks of information stored in a computer.
Files are created in the computer’s memory. (They can also be retrieved from
the Internet or copied from other computers, but even then the files origi-
nated in some computer’s memory bank somewhere.) From memory, files are
saved on a computer’s hard drive, which is the most reliable location for the
safe, long-term storage of computer information.
Windows helps you keep track of your files in several ways. First, you give a
file a name when it’s saved to disk. Windows also gives the file an icon, or tiny
picture, that helps you associate the type of file you created. Special icons
exist for documents, music files, videos, and other types.
The date and time the file was saved to disk are also included with the file
information, along with how much disk space the file occupies. Windows
keeps all this information, but you can use it as well.
Windows helps you keep your files organized by using folders. Folders contain
files, so files relating to the same project or files of a similar type can be kept
together. And, the folders can contain even more folders, so you can be seri-
ously organized if that’s your goal. See also Part VII.

Connecting Stuff
I
f your life’s technical experience includes only plugging some-
thing into the wall, boy, are you in for a surprise!
Yes, computers do plug into the wall — several times and in several
ways. More than that, computer gadgets and gizmos plug into each
other. Unlike your stereo system, where most of the cables look
alike, on the computer just about every cable is different: different
shape, different color, different way to plug it in. This chapter
covers the basics of plugging stuff in.

Part I

About Computer Cables
A computer cable is described by which port it plugs into and its
length.
For example, to connect a printer to the console, you use a printer
cable. A USB device (including printers) connects by using a
USB cable. A monitor uses a monitor cable.
One exception is networking, which is done by using Cat-5 cable,
though you can say “networking cable” and the guy in the com-
puter store won’t mock you. The connector on the console is called
an RJ-45, but networking cable isn’t “RJ-45 cable.” It’s Cat-5.
Some cables are permanently attached to their devices: The mouse
and keyboard have such cables, for example. Other cables are sep-
arate. That just means that you must remember to plug in both
ends.
Cable length is measured in feet or meters. USB, IEEE, networking,
printer, and serial cables all come in varying lengths.
Good news: Nearly all computer cables are what they call idiot-
proof. That means you can plug them in only one way. You cannot
plug in a computer cable backward or incorrectly or in any manner
that may damage your computer or the device being plugged in.
But, unless the hardware documentation says so otherwise, it’s
okay to plug in most computer gizmos while the computer is on.
There are some exceptions to this rule, so carefully read through
the other sections in this part of the book!
Some computer devices plug right into the wall. Some don’t plug
into the wall at all. And some devices use what’s called a power
brick, or transformer, which is either part of the plug itself or living
on the cable between the device and the wall socket.
Audio
PCs have built-in sound, and the console has a teensy, crappy
speaker. What you really need are external speakers. Plus, you can
use a microphone or headphones or attach an audio cable to any
sound-producing device and record that sound on your PC. This is
all done thanks to the PC’s audio connectors.
All PC audio connectors are of the mini-DIN design. That’s a
common connector-hole combination used on many audio devices.
If your audio device doesn’t use mini-DIN (for example, standard
headphones, which use a much larger connector), you can buy an
adapter at any electronics or music store.
2
Part I: Connecting Stuff

 PC speakers connect to the Line Out, speaker, or headphone
jack on the console.
 Microphones connect to the microphone connector.
 The Line In connector is used to connect any nonamplified
sound source, such as your stereo, VCR, phonograph, Victrola,
or other sound-generating device.
Yes, the difference between the Line In and microphone jack is that
Line In devices aren’t amplified.
Your console may have multiple sets of audio connectors: three on
the front, three on the back, three on the DVD adapter card. If so,
use the sound connectors on the DVD card first because they’re
the best. Otherwise, when audio connectors are on the front and
back of the PC, the front set is simply a copy or spare (designed for
easy hookup of the mic or headphones).
To record sound, you need software that lets you convert audio
input into digital storage inside the computer.
Digital Camera
Your digital camera may connect to the console in one of three
ways:
 Through the USB port
 Through the mini-IEEE port
 Through its own, special cable
The connection used by your camera depends on the camera’s
manufacturer, not on the PC.
Note that it’s also possible to use a media card reader on your PC
to directly read the camera’s digital “film.” For example, you can
get a CompactFlash memory reader, which you connect to your PC
by using the USB port (see also “USB Port”).
See also “Optical Audio,” for information on using that specialized
connector.
IEEE
The IEEE port allows you to use high-speed external devices with
your PC. This port isn’t as common as the USB port, though the
IEEE port behaves in much the same way, and for some devices
(external disk drives, digital video, high-end scanners), it’s better
than USB.
IEEE
3

IEEE devices require an IEEE cable, which may or may not come
with the device.
The cable’s ends are identical. It matters not which end of the cable
goes into the device or which end plugs into the console.
As with USB, it’s possible to daisy-chain IEEE devices, by plugging
one into another, into another, and finally into the console. Note
that certain IEEE gadgets prefer to be connected to the console
directly.
Also like USB is the IEEE hub, which allows you to expand the
number of IEEE ports.
Some devices, particularly digital videocameras, use the mini-IEEE
connector. This connector requires a unique cable. (It uses only
four wires, whereas the standard IEEE cable has six.)
IEEE is also known as 1394. The two names are often used
together, as in IEEE 1394. On Apple computers, the IEEE inter-
face is referred to as FireWire. No matter what the name, the
standard symbol is shown in the margin.
Most PCs don’t come with IEEE ports, though they can be added
easily by installing inexpensive expansion cards.
Joystick
An older PC may sport a unique joystick port. It’s a 25-pin, D-shell
connector, found on the rumps of older-model computers. The joy-
stick port can also be used to connect the MIDI adapter for playing
musical instruments with your PC.
Today’s joysticks plug into the USB port (see also “USB Port”).
The joystick port may also be referred to as the A/D port, where
A/D stands for analog-to-digital.
Keyboard
The PC keyboard plugs into the keyboard port on the back of the
console.
Note that the keyboard port looks amazingly similar to the mouse
port. Despite their visual similarity, they’re two different ports.
Your keyboard (or mouse) doesn’t work when it’s plugged into the
wrong port.
A USB keyboard can plug into any USB port.
4
Part I: Connecting Stuff

Some USB keyboards come with lime green adapters, designed to
convert the USB ports into keyboard port connectors. Using this
type of adapter is optional.
Don’t plug the keyboard into the keyboard port while the computer
is on. It’s okay to plug in a USB keyboard, but don’t plug anything
into the keyboard port when the computer is on. It may damage
the keyboard, the computer, or both.
Microphone
To use a microphone with your PC, plug it into the microphone
port. See also “Audio.”
Modem
Most PCs are sold with internal modems. In that case, all you see
on the back of the console is a standard phone jack. Take a phone
cord, plug it into the modem’s phone jack, and then plug the other
end of the phone cord into the telephone company’s jack on the
wall. The modem is connected.
If the modem has a second phone jack, one designed for a tele-
phone, you can plug a telephone’s cord into that jack as well. You
can use the phone any time the computer isn’t using the modem to
make a call.
External modems also have phone jacks and need to be plugged in
the same way as internal modems. Additionally, the external
modem needs to plug into the console. This is done by either using
a serial cable and plugging the modem into the console’s COM port
or using a USB cable. External modems must also be plugged into
the wall for power.
Don’t plug the modem into the network’s RJ-45 jack. Although that
hole looks the same, it’s slightly larger and the phone jack doesn’t
stay put.
Monitor
The monitor plugs into the VGA, or graphics adapter, jack on the
back of the console. It goes in only one way.
If the console has two VGA connectors, you probably want to use
the one on an expansion card rather than the one on the console’s
I/O panel. (See also the “Big Picture.”)
Monitor
5

Mouse
Your computer’s mouse plugs into the mouse port on the back of
the console. This port looks exactly like the keyboard port, but be
sure that you plug the mouse into the right port. The mouse doesn’t
work otherwise.
USB mice need to connect to the USB port, though many mouse
manufacturers also include an adapter that lets you convert the
USB connector to a PC mouse port connector. Either way works.
Turn your computer off before you connect or disconnect the
mouse to the mouse port.
Network
To connect your PC to a network, or to a networklike device, such
as a cable or DSL modem, plug the cable’s plastic connector into
the console’s RJ-45 jack.
The RJ-45 jack looks exactly like a telephone connector, though it’s
more squat (wider and shorter).
When the network cable is fully inserted, you feel or hear it snap
into place.
To remove the network cable, press the tab on the narrow end, and
then slide the cable out of the hole — just like you disconnect a
phone cord.
Optical Audio
If you’re a high-end audio snob, you can use optical audio to con-
nect the PC to your high-end optical audio sound equipment. Both
devices, input and output, must have optical audio. And, you must
obtain special (and not cheap) fiber-optic cable to connect the
toys.
Optical audio isn’t a must.
Be careful not to bang, touch, or taunt the clear glass ends of the
optical cable. Better cables come with little protective caps that
you can keep on the ends when the cable isn’t connected.
Optical Audio Out ports connect to optical Audio In, and vice
versa.
6
Part I: Connecting Stuff

Power
Cinchy: The plug goes into the wall socket.
Some power cables are affixed to the device they power. Others
must be plugged in at both ends. Oftentimes, it’s that second 
end disconnecting that’s the source of endless computer angst 
and woe.
You may want to use a power strip or UPS. See also Part III for infor-
mation on turning on your PC.
Printer
The printer plugs into the console’s printer port. Nothing could be
more “duh.”
The standard PC printer cable has two different ends. One is
designed to plug into the printer; the other, into the console. It’s
impossible to confuse the two.
USB printers plug in by using a USB cable. For printers with both
printer and USB options, use the USB option.
Printers don’t come with cables! You must buy the cable — USB or
standard printer cable — separately.
Another name for the printer port is LPT1. Another name for the
printer cable is Centronics. Another name for the port is parallel
port, with the corresponding parallel cable.
Avoid inexpensive printer cables because they aren’t bidirectional.
You should ensure that you get a printer cable that talks both
ways. That way, you can use all your printer’s features.
It’s trivial, but printer cables should be no more than about 10 feet
long. The signal may degrade over longer distances. Well, and you
get tired of walking over to a printer set far away.
Printers can also be connected to computers over the network, in
which case the printer is connected by using a networking cable
only.
S-Video
S-Video connectors allow you to send your computer’s video
output to a standard television set, or to any video gizmo that has
S-Video input.
S-Video
7

S-Video output provides higher-quality images than other types of
video output. You typically find this type of connector only on the
rumps of PCs with high-end video adapters.
S-Video is typically output only. To read video input on your PC,
you need a special video adapter that accepts input.
The final thing to remember about S-Video is that it’s video only; it
doesn’t transmit any audio. To get the sound over to your televi-
sion, you have to string some wires from the Line Out, speaker, or
headphone jacks or use the optical audio connections (if your tele-
vision supports that).
Scanner
Most scanners connect to the console by using the USB port. In
fact, they don’t even require a power cable; the scanner draws its
power from the USB port itself. Amazing.
High-end scanners use the IEEE port rather than, or in addition 
to, USB.
Serial
Today, the most common device to plug into the console’s serial, or
COM, port is an external dial-up modem. There are also serial mice
as well as a few serial printers.
At one time, a serial port was the most versatile type of connector
on your PC. Today, however, it’s kept around mostly for compatibil-
ity with older devices.
On consoles with more than one serial port, they’re named COM1,
COM2, and so on.
COM is short for communications.
Another term for the serial port is RS-232.
Speakers
Speakers plug into the speaker or headphone jack (see also
“Audio”).
Note that speakers can also be a part of the monitor. Even so, a
separate cable is required in order to plug the speakers into the
speaker or headphone jack on the console.
8
Part I: Connecting Stuff

USB Port
USB devices plug into the USB port — any USB port, though some
devices specifically want to be connected to the console or to a
powered USB port.
Newer USB devices are generally faster and better than the original
USB standard. These newer devices are referred to as high-speed
or USB 2.0 devices, and they require a USB 2.0 port. Most PCs come
with this port, though older PCs can add the port by adding an
internal expansion card.
USB cables have two different ends, dubbed A and B. The A end is
flat and exists on the console or the back of any USB hub. The B
end is trapezoidal in shape and plugs into the USB device.
USB extension cables are available, but be sure that the extension
cable’s ends match what you’re plugging into: A to A or B to B.
USB hubs allow you to further expand the number of USB devices
your computer can use. The hub connects to the console (or to
another hub) by using a standard A-B USB cable. The hub itself
contains more USB ports, from two to four, on up to a dozen or
more.
Some hubs must be plugged in to help supply external USB devices
with power. These are known as powered hubs.
Many USB devices act as hubs and provide even more USB connec-
tors for even more gizmos.
USB cables come in a variety of lengths, but the cables are never
longer than 3 or 4 feet. Any longer and the signal may be compro-
mised.
USB devices can be connected or disconnected whether the power
is on or off. If the power is on, the computer instantly recognizes
the device and makes it available. But note that some USB devices,
particularly external disk drives and other storage devices, cannot
be removed unless you first use the PC’s operating system to dis-
connect, or unmount, the device.
Wireless Gizmos
Yes, even wireless devices require some type of wired connection.
For example, a wireless keyboard and mouse require you to con-
nect the transmitter to the keyboard and mouse ports or to a USB
connector on the console. Beyond that point, however, the key-
board and mouse aren’t tethered to the console by wires.
Wireless Gizmos
9

Wireless networking is generally wire-free. The network card’s
antenna sticks out of the console’s rump. (On a laptop, the antenna
may be internal.) Despite the term wireless, at some point the
system uses wires. For example, a wireless hub needs to connect to
the Internet, and that’s done by using a wire.

elieve it or not, you are the master of your PC’s domain. You
control what goes into the computer system, whether it’s hard-
ware or software. You get to not only choose which hardware or
software to add, but also install it all by yourself. This isn’t as crazy
as fixing your toaster or as delicate as brain surgery. In fact, it’s
deceptively easy — but don’t tell that to the overpriced computer

The Add Hardware Icon
The Control Panel’s Add Hardware icon seems like it should be
used to help add new hardware to your computer. That’s only half
true. You need to use the Add Hardware icon only when the com-
puter poops out and fails to recognize newly installed hardware. As
PCs become more sophisticated, those instances are fewer.
To access the Add Hardware icon, heed these steps:
1. Click the Start button to display its menu.
2. Choose Control Panel from the menu.
3. If Category view is being used, click the text labeled Switch to
Classic View.
Classic view displays all the Control Panels’ icons, which may
be confusing, but it’s more useful than Category view. This
figure shows an example of Classic view.
4. Double-click the Add Hardware icon.
Opening the Add Hardware icon runs the Add Hardware
Wizard.
5. Read the wizard’s instructions and click the Next button to
continue.
6. Work through the wizard.

Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

Heed the instructions that are offered, and make selections
and click the Next button as required.
7. Click the Finish button when you’re done.
See also “Adding New Hardware.”
The Add or Remove Programs Icon
Most software comes with its own install or uninstall programs.
When those don’t work, or they aren’t obvious, you can use the
Windows Control Panel and its Add or Remove Programs icon for
your software installation and removal chores.
Here’s how to access the Add or Remove Programs icon:
1. Open a Windows Explorer window; from the desktop, open the
My Computer icon.
Or, you can press Win+E.
2. From the Address bar drop-down list, choose Control Panel.
3. Ensure that Classic view is chosen.
Refer to the preceding section.
4. Open the Add or Remove Programs icon.
Opening the icon displays the Add or Remove Programs
window, which can be used in several ways, depending on
which of the buttons on the window’s left side are selected.
The Add or Remove Programs Icon
13

There can be as many as four buttons, depending on your version
of Windows XP:
 Change or Remove Programs: This option lists all installed
software in your computer and allows you to select one to
remove. Options to change installed programs are also avail-
able, depending on the program. See also “Software Installation
and Removal” and “Uninstalling software.”
 Add New Programs: This is the item to choose when you need
extra help in finding and installing new software.
 Add/Remove Windows Components: Choose this item to
install or remove programs that come with Windows. See also
“Adding Windows Components.”
 Set Program Access and Defaults: These advanced options
control access to certain programs.
You can close the Add or Remove Programs window when you’re
done messing around.
Adding New Hardware
The best way to add new hardware is to follow the instructions
offered with the hardware. The instructions tell you what to do,
and in what order, and perhaps offer helpful suggestions.
Read through the instructions once before installing or adding the
new hardware. Then, read through them a second time as you go
through the steps.
Windows instantly recognizes most new PC hardware you shove
into or attach behind the console. Read the instructions anyway.
When you plug in new USB or IEEE devices, you may hear the com-
puter beep and see a pop-up message where the PC tells you how
excited it is about the new device.
Hardware requires software in order to run. In some cases, the soft-
ware could just be Windows itself, but, many times, additional
software is required in order to power the new hardware, and it
must be installed. It’s important to follow the software installation
instructions properly; sometimes, the new hardware must be
installed before the software, and sometimes it works the other way.
Before adding internal components, such as an expansion card
or more memory, be sure to turn off and unplug the computer’s
console.
14
Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

After adding some new hardware devices, it’s necessary to restart
Windows.
If Windows fails to recognize the new hardware, use the Add
Hardware icon in the Control Panel (see also “The Add Hardware
Icon”). Note that modems and non-USB joysticks must be installed
by using other icons in the Control Panel:
 To add a new external modem to your PC, use the Phone and
Modem Options icon in the Control Panel.
 To add a non-USB joystick to your PC, use the Game Controllers
icon in the Control Panel.
Adding new hardware may force Windows XP to require reactiva-
tion. Microsoft does this to ensure that all the new hardware is
compatible with Windows XP, and also to thwart sneaky software
pirates. You must contact Microsoft, either by phone or via the
Internet, to reactivate your copy of Windows XP. Obey the instruc-
tions on the screen, if any.
Adding Windows Components
Windows comes with a host of optional programs, utilities, and
stuff, all of which you can add or remove as you wish. These
include programs like Paint, Notepad, WordPad, all those games,
and other random software.
Adding more programs gives you more options and things to do in
Windows.
Removing programs, especially those you seldom use, frees up disk
space.
To add or remove these Windows components, use the Add or
Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel. See also “The Add or
Remove Programs Icon.”
After the Add or Remove Programs window is open, click the
Add/Remove Windows Components button. It runs a wizard that
helps you install or remove the various programs that come
with Windows.
The wizard displays various categories of programs. To view the
contents of a category, select the category and click the Details
button. For example, to view the Accessories and Utilities category,
click to select it and then click the Details button, as shown in the
figure. Then, to view the contents of the Games category, select it
and click the Details button.
Adding Windows Components

To add a program, place a check mark by its name.
To remove (uninstall) a program, remove its check mark.
Check marks in gray boxes indicate that not every program in that
category has been installed.
Keep an eye on the Total Disk Space Required value.
After making your selections, click the Next button. Wait as the
options are installed or removed. Click the Finish button when
you’re done.
In some instances, you need to restart Windows after clicking the
Finish button.
Removing a game
As an example of removing a Windows component, here are the
steps you would take to remove the Solitaire game:
1. Open the Windows Components Wizard.
2. Click to select Accessories and Utilities.
3. Click the Details button.
4. Click to select Games.
5. Click the Details button.
6. Click to remove the check mark by Solitaire.
7. Click OK once to close the Games window. Click OK again to
close the Accessories and Utilities window.
8. Click the Next button.
Windows removes the game.

Adding Fax Services
As an example of adding a Windows component, the following
steps describe how to install the Windows Fax tool. This tool may
not be available in all versions of Windows.
1. Open the Windows Components Wizard.
2. Click to put a check mark by the Fax Services item.
This item is at the main level. Note that for other items you
may have to click to select an item and then click the Details
button — perhaps twice or more — to get to the specific com-
ponent you want.
3. Click the Next button.
Windows installs the necessary files.
You may be asked to insert the original Windows CD to com-
plete installation. If you don’t have this CD, you’re stuck.
4. Click the Finish button.
You’re done.
Inserting an Expansion Card
Anyone who is good with Legos or Tinker Toys can add an expan-
sion card to a PC. The specific steps for each card vary, and you
should follow the directions included with the card. I’ve listed
these steps as a general outline:
1. Turn off and unplug the PC’s console.
2. Open the PC’s console.
Use a screwdriver to remove the screws on the back of the
console. Note that some consoles don’t have screws, and the
screws aren’t always on the back. Good luck!
3. Locate the proper expansion slot.
The expansion card is an ISA, PCI, or AGP card. You must find
the corresponding slot on the motherboard for that card.
Inserting an Expansion Card
17

Yes, you may have to move some cables out of the way. This is
okay, as long as you don’t disconnect any of the cables — or as
long as you remember to reconnect any you’ve disconnected.
Some PCI or ISA slots may not be available because of other
items inside the console blocking them. Make sure that you
choose a slot that has enough room around it to accommodate
your expansion card.
4. Remove the ISA/PCI slot’s back cover.
This small metal cover is just behind the slot. It’s where an
expansion card’s rump is accessible to the world. Remove the
slot cover and toss it out — but keep the tiny screw (if a screw
is used).
PCI slot

18
Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

5. Remove the expansion card from its sealed bag.
Carefully handle the card! Try to touch it only by the edges.
Don’t touch the components or any metal part of the card.
It helps if you can keep one hand on the console’s metal case
while you’re handling the expansion card. This precaution
zeroes the electrical potential between you, the case, and the
card and reduces the chance of that evil static electricity dam-
aging something.
6. Set any options on the card.
Some cards have tiny switches that must be set in order to
preconfigure the card — though this isn’t as common as it
once was.
7. Insert the card into the slot.
Be firm, but gentle. The card can go in only one way. It also has
to seat itself on the back of the computer, where you removed
the slot’s back cover in Step 4.
Expansion slots

8. Optionally, connect any cables or wires that the expansion
card needs.
9. Screw down the expansion card’s back cover.
Use the screw you took from Step 4. Or, if a clamping or non-
screw system is used, do whatever it takes to firmly secure
the card.
10. Double-check everything.
Are all the cables connected? Everything in snug? No loose
items rattling about? No screwdriver left on the motherboard?
No flashlight lurking inside the case?
11. Close up the console.
12. Reconnect the power cord.
13. Turn on the console and the computer.
Adding an expansion card could trigger the reactivation of
Windows XP. See also “Adding New Hardware.”
Installing Memory
Adding more memory to your PC is one great — and inexpensive —
way to boost your system’s performance. It’s simple. Follow these
general steps, though if any specific steps come with your com-
puter’s memory, be sure to follow them instead:
20
Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

1. Turn off and unplug the PC’s console.
2. Open the PC’s console.
Remove the screws from the back of the console, or use what-
ever clever method is required in order to open that sucker up.
3. Locate the memory banks.
There should be a collection of them, usually two or four
grouped side-by-side.
4. Remove any old memory, if necessary.
Hopefully you just have to add your new memory cards, or
DIMMs, into empty slots. But you may have to remove older
memory to make room for the new DIMMs. If so, see the follow-
ing section. Then, come back here to finish installation.
5. Move aside the connectors on the side of the memory slot.
Two plastic arms swing up to help hold down the DIMM. Swing

6. Remove the new memory from its sealed bag or tube.
Be careful with those DIMMs! Touch them only by their edges.
It helps if you use one hand to hold the DIMM and keep the
other hand touching the console’s metal case. This precaution
zeroes the electrical potential between the memory, the case,
and yourself. By doing so, you reduce the chance of generating
static electricity and damaging the delicate memory chips.
7. Line up the DIMM with the slot.
The DIMM and the slot are keyed so that you can insert the
memory only one way. Try to line up the DIMM so that it’s
properly positioned over the slot.

8. Plug the DIMM into the slot.
Firmly, but gently. Do not force! If the thing doesn’t seat prop-
erly, it’s most likely oriented improperly. Turn it around and
try again.
9. Double-check everything.
Are all the cables connected? Everything in snug? No loose
items rattling about? No screwdriver left on the motherboard?
No flashlight lurking inside the case? Your fly zipped up?
10. Close up the console.
11. Reconnect the power cord.
12. Turn on the console and the computer.
The computer instantly recognizes new memory when the PC next
starts up.
You may see an error message. Relax! This is normal. Follow the on-
screen instructions to adjust the PC’s BIOS to update the new total
amount of memory. Save the changes. Then, restart the computer.

I recommend using the online Web site www.crucial.com for
buying new memory for your computer. When you know the com-
puter’s make and model, you can work the “memory configurator”
on that Web site and figure out exactly how much of what kind of
memory your computer needs. It may not be the least expensive
memory on the Internet, but the service and support make the
price worth it.
Adding more memory may trigger Windows XP to yearn for reacti-
vation. See also “Adding New Hardware.”
Removing Memory
It’s best to install computer memory into open or available
memory slots. Then again, you probably weren’t thinking about
upgrading when you first bought your PC, so all the memory banks
are full. To add new memory, you need to remove all or some of the
old memory. Here’s how to yank out those memory DIMMs:
1. Turn off and unplug the PC’s console.
Keep the plug well away from the console, in case it suddenly
becomes animated and desires to plug itself in again under its
own power.
2. Open the PC’s console.
Lay aside that can opener: Use a screwdriver to remove screws
from the rear of the case. Note that some newer PC cases don’t
have screws and it’s quite easy to open the console.
3. Locate the memory banks.
They’re found on the motherboard in groups of two or four.
4. Push aside the clips on the short ends of the memory card or
DIMM.
The clips keep the DIMM snug in its socket. By pushing them
aside, you free up the DIMM. Notice that the DIMM is pushed
up a tad out of its socket. Handy.
5. Set the DIMM aside.
6. Proceed with installing any new memory, as covered in the pre-
ceding section.
There’s little value in old computer memory. You can try to sell it
on eBay, if you like. I don’t recommend throwing it out; instead,
keep it in a safe, dry place where it won’t get stepped on or come
into contact with any metal or anything that can cause sparks or
static electricity.
24
Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

If you do plan on selling the old memory on eBay, repackage it in
the container that your new memory came in. That keeps it safe for
shipping.
Removing USB Storage Devices
Although you can easily attach and remove USB devices, those USB
storage devices must be properly removed, or ejected, by Windows.
Failure to do so properly may result in missing or damaged files.
To properly remove the device, locate the Safely Remove Hardware
icon in the system tray. Click that icon.
Choose the removable USB device from the pop-up list; click it with
the mouse.
When the computer tells you that it’s okay to remove the disk or
device, you can do so.
If the disk is in use, meaning that there are open files on the disk or
programs using the disk, you see a warning dialog box. Click the
Cancel button in that case.
Removable USB devices include flash memory drives; media cards;
external hard drives and CD-ROM/DVD drives; and any other USB
device that is used to store information. You can see the lot listed
in the My Computer window.
Software Installation and Removal
For the most part, adding new software to your computer is cinchy:
Simply insert the new software’s CD or DVD disc into the CD or
DVD drive. Installation should proceed automatically after that;
follow the instructions or directions on the computer screen.
When inserting the disk does nothing, which is always the case
with software that comes on a floppy disk, you need to manually
run the Install or Setup program. The easiest way to do that is by
using the Control Panel’s Add or Remove Programs icon. See also
“The Add or Remove Programs Icon.”
Software Installation and Removal
25

Installing software you downloaded 
from the Internet
Programs downloaded from the Internet come in one of two types:
EXE, or program files that install automatically, or ZIP files, which
you must decompress and then install.
Installing an EXE file is easy: Simply locate the downloaded file by
using Windows Explorer. Double-click to open and run the program
file. Obey the instructions on the screen.
Most downloaded programs don’t come in the EXE format, which is
sad. The main reason is to protect against viruses; you shouldn’t
wantonly download EXE program files.
To install software from a ZIP file, you must first remove the files
from the zip archive and then run any special Install or Setup pro-
gram. These steps overview the operation:
1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file.
In Windows XP, ZIP files appear as compressed folders. The
icon is shown in the margin. If you’ve installed special ZIP file-
management software, such as WinZip, that ZIP file icon is
used instead.
2. Open the downloaded ZIP file folder.
3. In the panel on the left side of the window, in the Folder Tasks
area, choose Extract All Files.
The Extraction Wizard starts.
4. Click the Next button once, and then click it again. Then click
the Finish button.
After you complete these steps, a new folder is created. The
new folder shares the same name as the compressed folder,
but it’s not a compressed folder. The new folder’s window
opens immediately after you click the Finish button, which
saves you lotsa steps.
5. Locate the installation program, named either Setup or Install.
At this point, installation should proceed as it would for any
program you install in Windows.
When there’s no Setup or Install program, you have to see the
downloaded program’s instructions for further information. Try to
find a file named Readme or Readme.Doc. Open that file for more
instructions.
26
Part II: Installing Hardware and Software

I recommend keeping the original ZIP or EXE file so that you can
reinstall the program later, if you desire. You can delete the extra
folder that’s created by extracting files from the zip (compressed
folder) archive (refer to Step 4).
Uninstalling software
Removing software is much easier now than it was in the old days.
Even so, you must use the proper methods for removing a program.
The first thing to try is to visit the Add or Remove Programs icon in
the Control Panel. Locate the program on the list and click the
Remove button to properly uninstall the program. See also “The
Add or Remove Programs Icon.”
The second thing to try is to locate the program’s submenu entry
on the Start button’s Programs menu. Usually included on the pro-
gram’s submenu is an Uninstall option.
The last thing you want to do is manually delete the program from
your computer. Although that rids you of the program’s main file, it
doesn’t completely uninstall the program. Remnants and pieces of
the program continue to lurk on your computer’s hard drive and
eventually cause you much woe. Because of that, I don’t recom-
mend manually deleting programs.

The On–Off Thing
S
ome devices run all the time — a refrigerator, for example. Other
devices must be turned on and off, which is done easily by using
a common switch: The toaster’s large handle turns the thing on and
automatically turns it off after producing toast of the desired toasti-
ness. The oven, the dishwasher, the dryer, and other devices have
dials and timers to turn themselves on and off. The water heater
heats water automatically and turns itself on and off as needed.
With a computer, you can just toss out the window all the on–off
knowledge you’ve gained throughout your life. Although nothing
could be simpler than flipping a light switch, few things in this life
are as complex as turning a computer on — and fewer things are
more daunting than turning the blasted computer off!

Changing the Power Button’s Function
It’s not an on–off switch any more. No, it’s a power button. That’s
because you can change its function and make the computer do dif-
ferent things when you press that button. Here’s how to set the
power button’s function just so:
1. Open the Control Panel.
You can get there from the Start button’s menu; choose the
Control Panel item.
2. Open the Power Options icon.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
The drop-down list in the Power Buttons area controls the PC’s
power button behavior. You may see as many as five options,
depending on what your PC’s hardware is capable of:
• Ask me what to do. Pressing the power button displays the
Turn Off Computer dialog box, where you can choose vari-
ous options for shutting down the computer, entering Stand
By mode, Hibernating, and so forth.
• Do nothing. Pressing the power button doesn’t do squat.
• Hibernate. The computer enters hibernation mode.
• Shut down. The computer shuts down.
• Stand by. The computer enters Stand By (sleep or sus-
pended) mode.
4. Select an option from the list to indicate what you want the
power button to do.
5. Click OK.
Normally, pressing the power button causes Windows to shut down
(see also “Turning the Computer System Off”).
See also the next section.
Forcing the Computer Off
After you’ve abandoned all hope of properly shutting down your
PC, you can try this one simple trick to turn the thing off: Press and
hold the power button. Keep holding it for about five seconds or
so. Eventually, the console turns off.
30
Part III: The On–Off Thing

Well, you can also try unplugging the thing or turning off the UPS.
Nothing wrong with that — as long as the computer is locked up
and you have tried properly shutting down first.
Hibernation
As an alternative to turning your computer off, you can use the
faster Hibernation option. What it does is to save the PC’s current
state: the open files, information in memory, and all that stuff. Then
the computer is turned off, like a bear sleeping out the winter in a
cave. The next time you turn the computer on, it starts up and
loads everything back into memory, and you’re ready to go.
Unlike turning the computer off, when the PC hibernates, open pro-
grams and files stay open. In fact, it’s as though nothing was really
shut down; the computer saves and restores everything. So, after
you log on, your computer is just as you left it.
To hibernate your computer, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button.
2. From the Start menu, choose the item labeled Turn Off
Computer.
Look in the lower-right corner of the Start menu.
The Turn Off Computer window appears.
3. Press the Shift key on the keyboard.
Either Shift key works. Note that the Stand By button changes
its label to read Hibernate. Keep the Shift key down!
4. Click the Hibernate button.
You can release the Shift key now.
The computer turns itself off. But, unlike in a normal shutdown,
you’re not prompted to save things or close programs. Instead,
everything is saved to disk and the system shuts down.
Hibernation
31

To unhibernate, just turn the computer on as you normally would.
The system revives from Hibernation mode and returns to the way
it was before you hibernated, open programs and everything.
Not every computer has the Hibernation option. If pressing the
Shift key in Step 3 doesn’t change the Turn off Computer window,
your PC cannot be put into hibernation.
If you’re required to log on to Windows, you have to log on after
the computer starts again, just as you do when you first turn on
the PC.
You can configure the computer to automatically hibernate after a
given period of inactivity. See also “Automatically going into Stand
By mode.” The instructions there also apply to hibernation.
Logging On and Off
Windows requires you to identify yourself properly before you can
use the PC. This is true for most computer operating systems. It’s
done for security reasons, to ensure that you are who you say you
are. That way, you and only you can access your own files. Also,
the computer can remember any personal settings or foofoo you’ve
set up inside Windows.
Log, or logging, is an ugly term, but it’s the most accurate. The term
log goes back years. It helps to think of a ship’s log, where the cap-
tain would write down information about the vessel and its travels.
For a computer, a user must log in to identify himself to the system.
Log in and log on mean the same thing: to identify yourself to the
computer system.
Log off is the term that’s used when you’re done with the computer
and sign out for the day.
A login is the name you use to identify yourself to the computer
system. This unique name identifies you and your account on
that PC.
Log on is a verb, meaning to log on or log in to a computer system.
Logging on and off are necessary for security, but useful only when
more than one person is using the same computer.
Logging in
To log in to Windows XP, click the picture or name associated with
your account. Optionally, type a password, and then press Enter.
32
Part III: The On–Off Thing

After a few moments, Windows completes its startup and you can
begin using the computer.
Logging off
To log off Windows, obey these steps:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Click the Log Off button.
It’s down toward the lower center of the Start menu.
Windows desires to know whether you want to log off or just
switch users.
Logging On and Off
33

3. Click the Log Off button.
Windows proceeds just as it would for shutting down the com-
puter, but rather than complete the job, it merely pauses and
redisplays the logon screen while it waits for someone else to
use the computer.
If you choose the Switch User option (in Step 3), Windows doesn’t
bother to shut down your programs. Instead, those programs and
windows stay open, and Windows merely allows another user to
log in at that point. The other user who logs in can work on the PC,
but Windows still remembers what the first user was doing.
By switching users, you can have one person quickly use the com-
puter while the other waits. This saves time over logging out all the
way or turning the computer off and then on again.
You don’t need to log off the computer if you’re done for the day.
Instead, simply shut down Windows or hibernate the computer.
Quitting Windows
When you’re done using Windows, you need to quit, or shut down,
the operating system. Because Windows is the same program that
runs the computer, quitting Windows is the same thing as turning
the computer off. In fact, on modern PCs, quitting Windows also
turns off the console. (But it doesn’t turn off the rest of the com-
puter system; see also “Turning the Computer System Off.”)
To quit Windows, pursue these steps:
1. Save your stuff! Close open programs!
Windows prompts you to save if you forget, but I recommend
starting out the shutdown procedure by saving and closing first.
2. Click the Start button.
3. From the Start menu, choose the item labeled Turn Off
Computer.
The Turn Off Computer window appears.
4. Click the Turn Off button.
The computer shuts itself down.
Modern PCs go so far as to turn off the console as well. For turning
off additional things, see “Turning the Computer System Off.”
If the computer immediately restarts, you have a problem —
typically, a hardware problem. Refer to my book Troubleshooting
Your PC For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for more information.
34
Part III: The On–Off Thing

Restarting Windows
Sometimes, it’s necessary to start over again with a clean slate. For
example, after installing some new hardware or new software or
performing a Windows update, it’s necessary to restart Windows.
Here’s how it’s done:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose the item Turn Off Computer.
It’s located in the lower-right part of the Start menu.
Selecting the Turn Off Computer item doesn’t turn off the com-
puter. Instead, it displays a Turn Off Computer window.
3. Choose Restart from the Turn Off Computer menu.
Windows begins shutting down, and then the computer
restarts.
If any unsaved documents are open, you’re prompted to save them
before the computer restarts.
The keyboard shortcut for restarting Windows is Win, U, R. For key-
boards without a Windows key, use Ctrl+Esc, U, R.
Restarting Windows is just like turning the computer off and on
again, though you don’t need to use the power button. The com-
puter shuts down and closes all programs and, eventually,
Windows itself. Then, the computer immediately restarts, just as
though it were turned on.
Restarting Windows can also be referred to as resetting the
computer.
Old-timers refer to restarting Windows as a warm boot.
If your console sports a Reset button, don’t use it to restart
Windows. Follow the instructions in this section instead.
Stand By Mode
All modern PCs are equipped with energy-saving hardware and
software. One of the energy-saving features gives the computer the
ability to go to sleep, or to be put into Stand By mode where the
computer is still on but consumes less power.
You can configure your PC to enter Stand By mode after a given
period of inactivity, immediately, or never, depending on your whim
and how much you enjoy saving energy.
Stand By mode is also known as Suspended mode or Sleep mode.
Stand By Mode
35

Putting your PC into Stand By mode
To manually put the computer into Stand By mode, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose the item Turn Off Computer.
3. Choose Stand By from the Turn Off Computer menu.
The computer enters its power-saving mode.
The screen goes dark, and you may hear the hard drive warble
down to a stop. The computer is asleep. Shhhh!
The computer isn’t really totally turned off (not like Hibernation
mode). Some functions are still working. But most of the power-
draining things that the computer does are halted.
Automatically going into Stand By mode
You can configure the PC to automatically enter Stand By mode
after a period of inactivity, such as an hour or so after any key on
the keyboard was pressed or the mouse was moved. The Power
Options icon in the Control Panel is where you need to go:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Power Options icon.
The Stand By options are listed in the lower part of the 
Power Schemes tab. There are separate settings for the hard
monitor and hard drive as well as for the entire system.
36
Part III: The On–Off Thing

3. Set a timeout value for the monitor.
After that period of inactivity, the PC’s display adapter stops
sending a signal, which places the computer’s monitor into
Sleep mode.
4. Set a timeout value for the hard disks.
After the specified period of inactivity occurs, the computer
powers down the hard drives.
5. Set a timeout value for the entire system to enter Stand By
mode.
This value overrides the individual settings for the monitor
and hard drives.
6. Click OK to lock in your settings.
Optionally, close the Control Panel window as well.
I don’t recommend setting a timeout for your computer’s hard
drives. Doing so makes the computer act sluggish because it takes
a while for the hard drives to spin back up to speed.
If you’re using a screen saver, note that the timeout value for the
monitor in Stand By mode overrides the screen saver’s timeout set-
ting. For example, if the screen saver comes on after 45 minutes but
the monitor goes into Stand By mode after 30 minutes, you never
see your screen saver.
Waking up from Stand By mode
To rouse the computer from its Stand By mode slumber, press any
key on the keyboard or jiggle the mouse. The computer wakes up
after a moment.
The best “any key” to press is the Ctrl key on the keyboard.
If the PC doesn’t wake up, it may have gone comatose. This hap-
pens sometimes; PCs can crash in their sleep. See also “Forcing 
the Computer Off.” See also Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies,
which I wrote (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Turning the Computer System Off
If you want to be good to your PC, and have your computer system
last a good long time, pay attention to shutting it down properly.
Too many people ignore this good advice, and their PCs suffer for
it. Don’t be one of them. Instead, turn off your computer system
like this:
Turning the Computer System Off
37

1. Quit Windows.
See also “Quitting Windows.”
2. Turn off the console if it doesn’t turn itself off automatically.
3. Turn off the monitor plus any other peripherals attached to
the PC.
You’re done. Walk away.
The key is to turn off the console first and then turn off other
things connected to the console: the monitor, printer, scanner, and
external disk drives.
Not every external device has a power switch; some external disk
drives and scanners have no on–off switch. Just let them be.
If everything is plugged into a power strip, you can turn off every-
thing by turning off the power strip.
Likewise, you can turn off things by turning off the UPS. (But don’t
unplug the UPS because that could run down the battery.)
The worst thing to do is simply unplug the computer to turn it off.
Sometimes that’s necessary in instances of dire need. But don’t
make it a habit.
Turning the Computer System On
The best way to turn on your computer system is in this order:
1. Turn on the computer’s peripherals first: monitor, printer,
external disk drives, and scanner, for example.
2. Turn on the console last.
The reason for turning on the console last is that it’s in charge. If
everything else is on and up to speed, the console can easily and
quickly recognize it. Otherwise, for example, if you neglect to turn
on an external hard drive, the computer doesn’t recognize it right
way (though modern PCs recognize an external hard drive when-
ever you turn the drive on).
If you’re using a power strip or UPS, the procedure works the same:
peripherals first and then the console, though it really doesn’t
matter if everything is turned on all at once.
After the computer comes to life, you need to log in to Windows.
See also “Logging On and Off.”
38
Part III: The On–Off Thing

The Uninterruptible Power Supply
One of the best things you can buy for your PC is a UPS, or uninter-
ruptible power supply. That’s a gizmo that’s essentially a large bat-
tery inside a power strip. The battery supplies power so that any
gizmos plugged into the UPS don’t suffer instant death after a
power outage.
Many UPSs are also equipped with special electronic filters and
noise protection, which further insulates your delicate electronic
equipment from various electrical evils.
Connect only the console and the monitor to the UPS. Specifically,
connect them to the battery-backed-up sockets on the UPS. You
can connect your other peripherals to the non-battery-backed-up
sockets or to a regular power strip.
The idea here is to keep the console and monitor active during a
power emergency. That way, you can save your stuff and properly
shut down. Printing, scanning, and using the Internet can wait until
the power comes back on.

The Uninterruptible Power Supply
39

You can get a UPS at any office supply or computer store. They’re
rated by how long they can keep things going after a power outage,
and also by how many sockets they have, how many are battery-
powered, and other features.
Note that having a UPS isn’t your ticket to computing in the dark.
When the power goes out, you should immediately save your stuff
and shut down the computer safely and properly.
The UPS beeps when there’s a power disruption or beeps con-
stantly when the power is out. That’s your signal to save your stuff,
quit Windows, and shut down the PC.
The time rating on a UPS is for comparison purposes only. In my
experience, most UPS batteries give up only a few minutes after the
power goes out — even though the UPS may be rated for 30 or 45
minutes. Be safe: Save your stuff, power down, turn off. Wait for the
power to come back on. (Go read a book . . . by candlelight!)

W
indows covers a vast expanse of territory. It has to. A com-
puter’s operating system has many tasks, duties, and respon-
sibilities. To avoid chaos and confusion, Windows itself is
composed of many smaller locales — like outposts on the territory.
These are places you may visit all the time to do common things,
or locations you may not need to visit that often. Regardless, those
places exist, and they help you and Windows keep your computer

All Programs Menu
Software installed on your computer can be accessed through the
All Programs menu. That’s where you can go to start just about any
program installed on your computer.
Here’s how you can access the All Programs menu:
1. Click the Start button.
This step pops up the Start menu.
2. Choose All Programs.
The All Programs main menu is displayed.
From the menu, you can choose a program to run.
Selecting a submenu displays that submenu’s contents, from which
you can choose a program or select yet another submenu to
peruse.
Not all programs are listed on the All Programs menu. Some of the
more obscure Windows utilities aren’t listed. Some programs you
download from the Internet aren’t listed either.
42
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

The keyboard shortcut to access the All Programs menu is Win, P,
Enter. If your keyboard lacks a Win (Windows) key, try Ctrl+Esc, P,
Enter. Use the keyboard’s arrow keys to navigate the menus;
press Enter to select and run a command.
If you’re using Windows XP in the “classic” visual mode, the name
of the menu is Programs and not All Programs.
Starting a program
You use the All Programs menu to start a program. For example, to
start the Notepad text editor, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button to display the Start menu.
2. Choose All Programs.
3. Choose Accessories.
4. Choose Notepad.
The Notepad program starts and opens its window.
These instructions can also be written this way:
1. Click the Start button to display the Start menu.
2. Choose All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad.
The Notepad program starts and opens its window.
You can close Notepad: Choose File➪Exit from its menu.
Popular menus on the All Programs menu
Windows preconfigures a few submenus on the All Programs menu,
places you may find yourself visiting from time to time. Here are a
few of the more popular All Programs submenus and what you may
find there:
Games: This is where the Windows games are! Note, though, that
other games are installed on their own, separate submenus (usu-
ally named after the game developer or distributor).
Accessories: Many of the smaller Windows assistant programs
appear on the Accessories menu: Calculator, Command Prompt,
Notepad, Paint, Windows Explorer, and WordPad are among the
more popular.
Accessories➪System Tools: This sub-submenu contains lots of
handy Windows utilities and programs, including Backup, Disk
Cleanup, Disk Defragmenter, and System Restore.
All Programs Menu
43

The Startup submenu
A special menu on the All Programs menu is named Startup. Any
programs placed on this submenu start automatically when
Windows starts.
Some applications automatically put their programs on the Startup
submenu when they’re installed.
To prevent a program from starting, move it from the Startup sub-
menu to another submenu. Just drag the item with the mouse or
edit the menu (see also “Organizing the All Programs menu”).
Creating a desktop shortcut to a program
Navigating the menus and submenus of the All Programs menu can
be tricky. For programs you use often, consider creating a desktop
shortcut icon to the program instead of having to use the All
Programs menu.
To copy a program from the All Programs menu to a shortcut icon
on the desktop, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button to display the Start menu.
2. Choose All Programs and find your program on the menu.
For example, choose Accessories and then locate WordPad.
3. Right-click the program’s command.
So, rather than left-click the command, which would start the
program, you right-click. This step displays a pop-up menu.
4. Choose Send To➪Desktop (create shortcut).
The program’s icon appears on the desktop as a shortcut file.
5. Press the Esc key on the keyboard to back up out of the sub-
menus and hide any menus that are displayed.
The shortcut icon on the desktop can be double-clicked to run the
program. Many PC users find this easier than wading through the
All Programs menu. But do this trick for only those programs you
use most often, lest the desktop get cluttered.
See also Part VI for information on shortcut icons.
Organizing the All Programs menu
Just about any new program you install creates its own menu on
the All Programs menu. This leads to a messy situation after a
while. I’ve seen some All Programs menus that are so tall they
cannot fit on the screen. That’s not very organized.
44
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

You can organize programs and menus on the All Programs menu
easily. The idea is to create main folders and then organize the pro-
grams and submenus into those folders.
As an example, here are some ideas for the main folders on the All
Programs menu:
 Internet
 Utilities
 Games
 Microsoft Office
 Accessories
 Misc
There’s no definitive list; you can create and use whichever folders
you believe would best keep you organized.
To do the organization, you need to move around the various exist-
ing menus and commands. Right-click the Start button and choose
Open from the pop-up menu. Creating and arranging the items is
done in a manner similar to managing folders. See also Part VII.
(Remember that folders are submenus and that shortcut icons are
commands.)
Control Panel
Windows uses a central location, called the Control Panel, to help
you manage many aspects of your computer. Most hardware
adjustments and modifications take place by using one of the 
many icons appearing on the Control Panel.
To display the Control Panel, click the Start button and choose
Control Panel from the menu.
You can also see the Control Panel from any Windows Explorer
window: Click the down arrow on the Address bar and select
Control Panel from the list.
In Windows XP, the Control Panel has two modes of operation:
Classic and Category. Classic view displays all the icons in one
window.
Control Panel
45

Category view displays only the most popular icons. Other icons
are accessed in subcategories.
To change views, use the task pane, on the left side of the window,
in the Control Panel area.
If the Control Panel isn’t available as an item on the Start menu,
follow these steps to make it so:
1. Right-click the Start button.
46
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. In the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box, click the
Customize button.
The Customize Start Menu dialog box appears.
4. Click the Advanced tab.
5. Locate Control Panel on the scrolling list.
It should be the first item.
6. Choose the option below Control Panel that reads Display As a
Link.
7. Click OK to close the various open dialog boxes.
The Control Panel now appears as a command on the main Start
menu.
To make the Control Panel appear as a menu, with its icons show-
ing up as submenu commands, choose the option Display As a
Menu in Step 6.
Desktop
The desktop is the main interface Windows provides. It’s what you
see when you first start Windows — home plate, as it were.
Desktop
47

The desktop is where various program windows appear as you use
Windows.
The desktop is also home to numerous icons. The icons are consid-
ered to be “on the desktop.” That keeps them handy.
The desktop can have a background, or wallpaper, image, or it can
be a solid color. You make that choice in the Display Properties
dialog box, on the Desktop tab.
Summon the Display Properties dialog box by right-clicking the
desktop and choosing Properties from the pop-up menu. (Right-
click the desktop, or background, not an icon on the desktop.)
The size of the desktop can be adjusted in the Display Properties
dialog box as well, on the Settings tab.
48
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

The taskbar appears on the desktop, though it’s not a part of the
desktop. (See also “Taskbar.”)
The term desktop has little to do with the thing today. On an older
computer, the desktop appeared as a graphical representation of a
desktop, complete with a pad of paper, a calendar, a glue pot, scis-
sors, and other items commonly found on a real desktop.
My Computer
My Computer is the name of an icon and a window where informa-
tion about your computer and its storage devices can be found.
To access the My Computer window, open the My Computer
icon on the desktop. The My Computer window lists the stuff
that exists inside your computer, primarily the disk drives but
also any digital cameras or scanners attached to your computer.
You can also access the My Computer window by choosing My
Computer from the Address bar’s drop-down list in any Windows
Explorer window.
The My Computer window may also be available as a command on
the Start button’s menu.
This window is often used as a starting place when navigating
through various disk drives and when file hunting.
The My Computer window allows you to quickly access information
about your computer’s disk drives. Right-clicking a drive and choos-
ing the Properties command displays information about that drive.
My Computer
49

You can eject removable disks in the My Computer window. Click to
select a disk, and then choose File➪Eject from the menu.
My Documents
My Documents is the name of an icon that appears on the desktop,
as well as the name of the folder that the icon represents. The
folder is the home for all the documents, files, and whatnot you
create on your computer. Indeed, it’s a home for your documents.
To view the contents of the My Documents folder, open the My
Documents icon the desktop. The contents of the window list
any files you’ve created or saved in that folder:
You may also see other folders in the My Documents folder
window, such as the My Music and My Pictures folders, which are
used in Windows and by various applications to store music and
graphics files, respectively.
Other folders in the window are created to help keep your stuff
organized. (See also Part VII.)
You can get to the My Documents folder from the Address bar in
any Windows Explorer window: Select the Address bar and choose
My Documents from the drop-down list.
There may be a command to open the My Documents folder on the
Start button’s menu as well.
50
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

Each user on the PC has his own My Documents menu. What you
see in Windows as My Documents is unique for your own account.
When another user logs on to Windows, he has his own, distinct
My Documents folder and does not see or have access to the files
in your account’s My Documents folder or its contents.
My Network Places
My Network Places is the name of an icon on the desktop that
opens a window listing various locations on the local network or
the Internet.
Opening the My Network Places icon reveals a window that lists
any shared folders or resources on other computers on the local
network — if any.
Opening the folders listed in the My Network Places window allows
you to access files on other computers.
You can also access this window by choosing My Network Places
from the drop-down list on any Address bar in any folder’s window.
The My Network Places window may also be available from a My
Network Places command on the main Start menu.
The My Network Places icon may appear on the desktop, even if
your computer isn’t on a local-area network. The icon’s appearance
is optional. You can remove the icon by following these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
See also “Control Panel.”
My Networking Places
51

2. Open the Display icon.
3. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Desktop tab.
4. Click the Customize Desktop button.
The Desktop Items dialog box appears.
5. Click to remove the check mark by My Network Places.
Removing the check mark removes that item from the desktop.
Likewise, you can remove check marks by other icons (My
Documents, My Computer, Internet Explorer) to remove
those icons from the desktop.
6. Click OK when you’re done.
7. Click OK in the Display Properties dialog box as well.
You can also close the Control Panel if you’re done with it.
Recycle Bin
The Recycle Bin is a storage location for files you delete on your
computer. It’s there because many folks often delete files and then
change their minds. By storing those “deleted” files in the Recycle
Bin, Windows gives you a chance to recover the files later.
Opening the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop displays the con-
tents of the Recycle Bin folder, a collection of all the files you’ve
deleted on your computer.
52
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

To see the most recently deleted files listed first, choose View➪
Arrange Icons By➪Date Deleted from the menu.
Files stay in the Recycle Bin until they’re removed. Files are
removed automatically over time as the Recycle Bin is being used.
You can also manually remove or empty the Recycle Bin.
Removing files from the Recycle Bin helps improve the amount of
disk storage space available. But, sadly, removing files from the
Recycle Bin means that there’s no way to recover them if you want
them.
Start Button
The Start button is the key you turn to start just about anything in
Windows: programs, activities, adjustments, fine-tuning — even
stopping the computer is done through the power of the Start
button.
The Start button lives on one end of the taskbar. Normally, the
taskbar sits on the bottom of the screen (though it can be moved),
and the Start button dwells in the screen’s lower-left corner.
Activating the Start button pops up the Start menu. You can acti-
vate the Start button by clicking it with the mouse. Or, you can
press the Win key on the keyboard, which also pops up the Start
button’s menu.
If your keyboard lacks a Win key, pressing the Ctrl+Esc key combi-
nation pops up the Start button’s menu.
Start Button
53

Press the Esc key, or Win key, to make the Start button’s menu go
away.
Start button menu
The Start button’s menu contains many shortcuts for getting to
other places in Windows, as well as accessing commonly used pro-
grams and the powerful All Programs menu.
The top of the menu lists your user ID and picture. (Windows refers
to the logon ID or login ID as a user ID.)
You can change the picture by clicking it with the mouse. That
opens the User Accounts icon from the Control Panel, where user
accounts are messed with.
The left side of the Start menu lists popular programs. The top half
of the menu is the pin-on area, where certain popular programs
can be placed. The bottom part of the left side lists recently used
programs.
The right side of the Start menu contains three different areas. At
the top are popular places and folders to visit in Windows. The
middle contains places to visit for changing settings in Windows.
The bottom area is for help and other commands.
Changing the Start menu’s look
There are two ways to view the Start menu in Windows: the new
way and the boring classic way. To choose one or the other, follow
these steps:
54
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box appears,
with the Start Menu tab forward.
3. Choose Classic Start Menu.
You can preview in the dialog box what the classic Start menu
looks like. It’s more reminiscent of the old Windows
98/Me/2000 Start menu. Boring.
4. Click OK to change the Start menu, or click the Cancel button
to keep it as is.
Adding or removing items 
from the Start button menu
The Start button’s menu is customizable. You can change just
about any aspect of the menu, from what appears and how it
appears to where specific things go. To wield such might, mind
these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
I assume that you’re using the Windows XP Start menu and not
the Classic Start menu.
3. Click the Customize button.
The Customize Start Menu dialog box lets you control what
does and what doesn’t show up on the Start button’s menu.
Start Button
55

The General tab controls how many programs appear on the
recently used programs list (on the left side of the menu, at the
bottom).
4. Click the Advanced tab.
The Advanced tab contains a scrolling list of items you can
select to display or not display on the right side of the Start
menu.
5. Click the OK button after making your choices.
Close any other open dialog boxes or windows.
I call the upper-left part of the Start button’s menu the “pin-on”
area. You can attach any program icon to this area by right-clicking
that icon and choosing the Pin to Start Menu command.
56
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

Icons can be removed from the pin-on area by right-clicking them
and choosing the Unpin from Start Menu command from the pop-
up menu.
System Tray
The system tray sits on the opposite end of the taskbar from the
Start menu. If the taskbar is on the bottom of the screen, the
system tray is on the right side of the taskbar.
The system tray normally displays the time of day as well as the
day of the week.
You may also see a volume control on the system tray.
The system tray also displays other icons. Those icons represent
various running tasks or programs, many of which monitor things
that go on in the computer “in the background.” For example, an
antivirus program may have its icon appear on the system tray.
Icons on the system tray may display messages from time to time
that alert you to certain changing conditions in the computer.
You can control the icons on the system tray by using the mouse.
Clicking, double-clicking, or right-clicking the icons controls their
behavior, making them pop up a menu, display a window, or do
something else (though some icons don’t do anything). Sometimes,
merely pointing the mouse at an icon does the job. What the icon
does, of course, depends on which program the icon represents.
The system tray is also known as the notification area, though most
manuals and documentation refer to it as the system tray.
You can eliminate many of the things displayed on the system tray,
but you cannot fully eliminate the system tray from the taskbar.
Displaying the time on the system tray
You can turn the time display on or off by following these steps:
1. Right-click the time display on the system tray.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. In the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box, locate the
Show the Clock item.
System Tray
57

4. Remove the check mark to hide the clock display; place a
check mark in the box to show the clock.
5. Click OK.
Displaying the volume icon on the system tray
The volume icon is displayed on the system tray courtesy of the
Control Panel’s Sounds and Audio Devices icon. Here’s how to turn
that display off or on:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Sounds and Audio Devices icon.
3. On the Volume tab, locate the item labeled Place Volume Icon
in the Taskbar.
4. Place or remove the check mark to show or hide the volume
display on the system tray.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
You can optionally close the Control Panel’s window as well.
Controlling the visibility of system tray icons
You can elect to show or hide some or all of the icons on the
system tray. Your first tool is the Show/Hide chevron, located on
the left end of the system tray. To show all the icons, click that
button when it’s pointing left.
Click the button when it’s pointing right to hide some or all of
the icons.
If you would rather show all the icons all the time, follow these
steps:
1. Right-click a blank spot on the system tray.
Or, you can right-click the time.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box is
displayed.
58
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

3. Remove the check mark by the item Hide Inactive Icons.
4. Click OK.
The taskbar now shows all its icons.
Notice that the Show/Hide chevron is missing. To reenter that
mode, repeat the preceding steps and replace the check mark in
Step 3 (rather than remove it).
You can also control which icons individually appear or hide.
Here’s how:
1. Right-click a blank spot on the system tray.
2. From the pop-up menu, choose the command named
Customize Notifications.
If you don’t see this command or it appears dimmed, you must
repeat the preceding set of steps to hide inactive items on the
system tray. Otherwise, the Customize Notifications dialog box
appears.
3. Click to select the name of an icon that you want to either hide
or display all the time.
After you select the name, the text in the Behavior column
changes to a drop-down menu.
4. Use the Behavior drop-down menu to select how the icon is
displayed.
System Tray
59

You have three options:
• Hide when inactive: The icon shows up when its program
is being used or when the icon thinks that it’s active.
• Always hide: The icon is always hidden.
• Always show: The icon is always shown.
5. Repeat Step 4 for each icon you want to control.
6. Click the OK button when you’re done showing or hiding indi-
vidual icons.
Note that changing how individual icons show up may or may not
work for all the teensy icons on the system tray.
Taskbar
The taskbar exists as a strip, usually found along the bottom of the
desktop (though it can move). On the left end of the taskbar is the
Start button. The right end of the taskbar is the system tray.
In the middle, the taskbar displays buttons, one for each running
program or open window on the desktop.
Clicking a button on the taskbar instantly switches attention to that
button’s window and brings the window up front and ready for
action. Other windows, if any, are shuffled behind the open
window. The open window is then said to be “on top.”
The taskbar is also host to various toolbars, which appear on the
taskbar between the Start button and system tray. Yes, it’s possible
for the taskbar to be a very crowded place.
Moving the taskbar
The taskbar can be relocated to any edge of the screen: top,
bottom, right, or left. Here’s how to move the taskbar:
1. Point the mouse at a blank part of the taskbar.
Find a spot in the middle, away from other buttons or graphi-
cal whatnot.
2. Drag the mouse to another edge of the screen.
The taskbar doesn’t move as much as it “snaps” into position
when you have the mouse pointer in the proper location.
60
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

3. Release the mouse button to drop the taskbar into its new
position.
Be aware that most documentation assumes that the taskbar is at
the bottom of the screen. That affects the position of the Start
button and system tray.
You can use these instructions to move a wayward taskbar back to
the bottom of the screen if it goes AWOL. (See also “Locking the
taskbar.”)
Resizing the taskbar
The taskbar can be made fatter to accommodate more buttons, or
made so thin as to be only a small line on the edge of the screen.
To resize the taskbar:
1. Position the mouse on the taskbar’s outer edge, between the
taskbar and the desktop.
When you find the sweet spot, the mouse pointer changes to a
this-way-that-way arrow (as shown in the margin).
2. Drag the mouse inward, toward the desktop, to make it thicker.
Or, drag the mouse outside, toward the edge of the screen, to
make it thinner.
3. Release the mouse.
The taskbar assumes the new size.
To prevent the taskbar’s size from being changed, see the later sec-
tion “Locking the taskbar.”
Automatically hiding the taskbar
You can elect to have the taskbar automatically shy away, to pro-
vide more room for windows on the desktop. This is known as the
Auto-hide feature, and here’s how you activate it:
1. Right-click the time in the system tray part of the taskbar.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
Taskbar
61

This step displays the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties
dialog box. The top part of the Taskbar tab deals with how the
taskbar appears.
3. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Auto-hide the
Taskbar.
4. Click OK.
Locking the taskbar
To prevent the taskbar from being moved or resized, you can lock
it. This action not only prevents the taskbar from wandering to
another edge of the screen, but also prevents you from moving or
resizing any other toolbars on the taskbar. So, this may be an
option you often turn off and on. Here’s how:
1. Right-click the time in the system tray part of the taskbar.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Lock the Taskbar.
4. Click OK.
A locked taskbar has a slightly different look to it. It appears nar-
rower; the top “lip” is missing. And, the dimple areas, used to move
toolbars on the taskbar, disappear.
Other toolbars
The taskbar is also home to other toolbars. In fact, you can stack
the taskbar with an endless number of toolbars, which seems
impractical, although it’s possible.
62
Part IV: Popular Places in Windows

Add a toolbar like this:
1. Right-click a blank part of the taskbar.
Don’t click a button or icon.
2. Choose a new toolbar from the Toolbars submenu.
The number and variety of toolbars that appear depends on
what features and applications you have installed in Windows.
After you choose a toolbar, the menu goes away and the new tool-
bar appears on the taskbar.
For example, adding the Address toolbar provides the taskbar with
an Address text box, just like a Windows Explorer or Internet
Explorer window.
You can type the name of a Web page to visit, or you can type the
name of a program to run — all from the taskbar’s Address toolbar.
Yes, adding toolbars can make the taskbar a busy place. See also
“Moving a toolbar.”
When a toolbar is cut off and buttons or options are hidden, the
toolbar grows a Show More button on its right end. Clicking this
button (see the margin) displays the hidden toolbar options as a
pop-up menu.
Quick Launch bar
A special toolbar is the Quick Launch bar, which appears on most
new Windows computers. This toolbar contains buttons showing
icons that represent popular programs. To run a program, click the
button. That’s how the toolbar gets its name — clicking a button
quickly launches that program.
To display the Quick Launch bar, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the time in the system tray part of the taskbar.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Show Quick
Launch.
4. Click OK.
Taskbar
63

To add a new icon to the Quick Launch bar, simply drag a program’s
icon from the desktop or any window to the Quick Launch bar.
(Note that this is a copy operation; the original icon isn’t moved.)
To remove an icon from the Quick Launch bar, drag it up and to the
desktop. That moves the icon to the desktop, and you can delete it
from there.
You can also right-click an icon on the Quick Launch bar and
choose the Delete command from the pop-up menu.
If you want to see smaller or larger icons on the Quick Launch bar,
right-click the left end of the Quick Launch bar (on the dimple bar)
and choose View➪Large Icons or View➪Small Icons from the pop-
up menu.
Moving a toolbar
Toolbars can be moved or rearranged, though it’s not the easiest
thing in the world to do.
First, the taskbar must not be locked.
Second, you must grab the toolbar by its left edge, on the dimple
bar. Just point the mouse at the dimple bar — the mouse pointer
spot.
Third, drag the toolbar either left, right, up, or down. Where you
drag the toolbar depends on how big the taskbar is and how many
other toolbars there are. It’s really more of a trial-and-error thing;
there are no solid or consistent instructions that can be relied on
to move a toolbar.
Finally, when you have the toolbar positioned just right, let go of
the mouse! The toolbar should stick where you left it. You can
optionally lock the taskbar at this point.
Note that it’s very easy to accidentally move toolbars on the
taskbar.
Removing a toolbar
The easiest way to zap a toolbar from the taskbar is to right-click
its dimple bar area. This action produces a pop-up menu from
which you can choose the Close Toolbar command.
If you don’t see the Close Toolbar command on the pop-up menu,
you’ve clicked in the wrong place. Try again.
Note that you cannot close the last toolbar, which is the taskbar
itself (the part that displays the window buttons).

Disk Drives
A
computer is a creative tool. You use a computer to create or
collect stuff. Applications and software programs on the com-
puter help you to create stuff. You use the Internet to collect stuff
that other folks create: pictures, videos, music, and other Web
whatnot. You can include among all that stuff the programs you
install and run on your computer. For all that stuff, the computer
must have ample, reliable, and secure storage. On the PC, that stor-
age is provided in the form of disk drives.

About Disk Drives
As computers evolved, it became obvious to computer users and
scientists that people didn’t enjoy re-creating everything on a com-
puter each time they turned the thing on. Yet, re-creating stuff was
necessary because computers of the day had no long-term storage.
Now, things are different. Now, computers have long-term storage.
Types of storage
Inside a computer are three types of storage, found in the micro-
processor, RAM, and disk drives.
First, the microprocessor itself has some storage, but only a small
amount, hardly enough to do anything more than basic math.
Second, the computer’s RAM provides good storage, to supplement
what the microprocessor has. Sadly, computer memory is tempo-
rary. Therefore, a third form of storage is needed, something long-
term. That’s the third form of storage: disk drives.
Disk drives are known as long-term storage.
Another term for disk storage is disk memory. Although technically
accurate, the term disk memory is misleading; disk storage isn’t
memory, like RAM is.
Saving and loading
To transfer information from memory to disk, you save that infor-
mation. Indeed, the information is saved from the certain peril of
short-term memory to the long-term safety of a disk drive.
To transfer information from a disk drive to memory, you open that
information. (Open is the common term used in Windows, though
some documentation uses the term load instead.)
Bits and Bytes
Computer storage is measured by the byte, just as distances are
measured in miles or kilometers — or inches or centimeters —
and weight is measured by the ounce or gram. In computers, it’s
the byte.
A byte is a single character of information. The letter A can be
stored in a byte, as can any letter, number, or symbol. For many
bytes, common abbreviations are used, as described in this table:

CD-ROM and DVD Drives
For high-capacity (meaning “lots of room”) storage, your PC uses
a CD-ROM or DVD drive, or sometimes one of each! These drives
eat the shiny media, those 5-inch plastic discs. For your CD music
player or DVD movie player, the discs contain music or videos,
respectively. They can contain that information for your computer
as well, but they can also contain data that the computer can use.
You can also use your computer to play music CDs or view DV
videos.
CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc, Read-Only Memory. The CD-ROM
drive reads CD-ROM discs. These discs cannot be written to; you
cannot save information to a CD-ROM as you can to a hard drive.
But the computer can read CD-ROM discs (hence, the read-only
part of the acronym). Most new software you install on your PC
comes on CD-ROM discs.
DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc, or sometimes the V means
Video. (The standards people called an early lunch before the exact
acronym was agreed upon.) The drives read DVD-ROM discs, simi-
lar in appearance to CDs, but can store much more information.
Otherwise, beyond the disc’s capacity, a DVD drive is very similar
to a CD drive on a computer.
DVD drives can also read (or play) CDs.
It’s often hard to tell which drive is a CD or DVD drive. Generally
speaking, CD drives have a CD logo on them, and DVD drives sport
the DVD logo.
CD-ROM and DVD Drives
67

Note that CDs typically have a headphone jack and maybe a
volume control, which DVDs lack.
CD-ROM or DVD discs may be referred to as CDs, DVDs, disks, or
discs. Physically, all the discs look alike. Some discs may be labeled
as CDs or DVDs, or you may see CD or DVD specified in the tiny
text around the disc’s center hole.
A typical computer CD stores anywhere from 650MB of data on up
to about 720MB.
A typical computer DVD stores up to 4.7GB of information.
Inserting a CD or DVD
CDs and DVDs are removable. They can be inserted or removed as
needed.
Inserting a CD or DVD is done differently, depending on the design
of the drive. There are two types: slot and tray.

Part V: Disk Drives

 Slot: The drive has a narrow slot into which you insert the disc.
About 1⁄3 to halfway in, the drive’s mechanism grabs the disc and
pulls it in the rest of the way.
 Tray: The disc sits in a tray that slides in and out of the drive.
To extend the tray, press a button on the front of the drive.
When the tray is fully extended, drop the disc into the round
holding area atop the tray. When the disc is centered, push the
button again to retract the tray.
The button to extend or retract the tray is often labeled with the
universal symbol for eject, as shown in the margin.
You can also retract the tray by gently pushing it back into the
drive. Gently!
Discs are inserted label side up.
If the disc lacks a label, it may be double-sided. In any case, nothing
bad happens when you insert the disc upside down. Just eject the
disc, flip it over, and try again.
Ejecting a CD or DVD
Removing a disc involves not only mechanically removing it, but
also ensuring that Windows is done using the disc. You don’t want
to remove a disc that is in use; doing so causes various and ugly
error messages to be displayed. It’s embarrassing.
When you’re done with a DVD or CD , eject it as follows:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Click to select the CD-ROM or DVD drive icon.
3. Choose File➪Eject from the menu.
If the disc is still in use, Windows lets you know by displaying an
error message. Heed that message to fix things (such as to quit a
program or close an open program window). Then, try again.
Put the disc back into its protective envelope or container and
store it in a proper place.
It’s bad to leave discs lying about, where they can be scratched and
damaged permanently.
For tray-type drives, you need to press the drive’s Eject button to
retract the tray after the computer ejects the disc.
When the disc is stuck or the power is off and you need to eject 
it, use the dimple or small hole near the tray or insertion hole.
Sticking a straightened paper clip into the hole and pushing gently
pops the disc out of the drive.

Playing a music CD or movie DVD
To play a musical CD or movie on a DVD, simply insert the disc into
your computer’s CD or DVD drive. The music or movie should play
automatically. If not, see the next subsection.
To play a music CD or DVD, you need proper media software. On
your PC, that software is provided by Windows Media Player, which
is included with Windows — unless you live in a place where
Microsoft has been sued over that, in which case you’re free to
choose your own media player.
AutoPlay programs
When you insert a removable disc, it may automatically run a pro-
gram, known as the AutoPlay program. For example, a CD contain-
ing a new program may run the Install or Setup procedure for that
program after you insert the CD into your computer.
To disable AutoPlay, press and hold the Shift key while inserting a
removable disc.
See also the next subsection.
Controlling the AutoPlay notice
Sometimes when you insert a removable disc, Windows may try to
guess what action to take with the disc, or a dialog box may appear
and prompt you to tell Windows what to do.
From the list, you can direct what Windows does with the disc.
To not do anything, choose the option labeled Take No Action.
70
Part V: Disk Drives

Whether or not Windows displays the AutoPlay notice is up to you.
The window is controlled from the removable drive’s Properties
dialog box:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the removable drive’s icon.
A pop-up menu appears.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. Click the AutoPlay tab.
5. To disable AutoPlay, choose the item labeled Select an Action
to Perform, and then choose the item labeled Take No Action.
6. Click OK.
You can also close the My Computer window.
The removable drive’s Properties dialog box can also be used to
preset what action to take or in what manner you would prefer that
Windows deal with removable disc. In Step 5 in the preceding
steps, simply choose the general disc type from the drop-down list
or select a program to take over when any disc is inserted.
Types of shiny discs
There exists a variety of CDs and DVDs. Originally, there were just
CD-ROM and DVD-ROM. (Often, the “ROM” part isn’t used when
describing the disc.) Beyond those two read-only formats are CDs
and DVDs that can be written to, by saving information similar to
other disk drives in your computer system.
To use recordable CDs and DVDs , your PC must be equipped with
the proper CD or DVD drive, one that can record information as
well as read it from the disc. The type of drive you have determines
which type of disc you can record to. Plus, you need special soft-
ware that controls the recording process.
Here are the currently popular types of recordable CDs and DVDs:
CD-R: This type of CD can be written to, but only once. After the CD
is burned, it can be used in any computer and read just like any CD.
Data and music CDs can be created by using CD-Rs. Note that some
CD-Rs are specifically manufactured for music and others are made
for data. The label on the CD-R package tells you which is which.
CD-RW: This type of CD can be written to just like a CD-R. Unlike a
CD-R, however, this disc can be completely erased and used again,
if needed. These discs are slightly more expensive than regular
CD-Rs and can be played only on CD-RW-compatible CD players.
CD-ROM and DVD Drives
71

DVD-R: The most compatible format, DVD-R can be played on 
most computer DVD players as well as on video DVD players. If you
want to make “home movie” DVDs, this is the format you want.
DVD-RW: This format is the same as DVD-R, though the discs can
be completely erased and used again.
DVD+R: A write-once version of the DVD+RW format. This format 
is more efficient than the DVD-R format, though it’s not widely 
supported.
DVD+RW: In this DVD-writing format, the disc can be erased and
used over again. This format is very efficient, but it’s not fully com-
patible with all DVD drives.
DVD-RAM: The oldest writeable DVD format is completely incom-
patible with all other DVD formats and is rarely used any more.
Some DVD discs allow recording on both sides of the disc. These
double-sided discs sport a capacity of 9.4GB, which is simply
double the 4.7GB you get on the single side of a DVD.
Turning on recording
You must ensure that recording is enabled on a CD or DVD drive.
For some reason, some PCs come with recording disabled. To
quickly check, follow these steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the removable drive’s icon.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. Click the Recording tab.
If there is no Recording tab, the drive is most likely a plain CD
or DVD drive; you cannot use the drive to make your own CDs
or DVDs .
5. Ensure that there is a check mark by the item labeled Enable
CD Recording on This Drive.
6. Click the OK button.
You can optionally close the My Computer window.
See also Part X for more information on creating your own CDs.
72
Part V: Disk Drives

Drive Icons
Windows assigns unique icons to different types of disk drives.
These can be seen in the My Computer window, as well as in other
locations in Windows where disk drives are referenced:
The floppy drive icon is used only with Drive A, though other
floppy drives that are added to the system share this icon.
This is the hard drive icon.
The CD/DVD drive icon is the same for both CD and DVD drives.
But whenever you stick a CD or DVD disc into the drive, the icon
changes. It’s labeled either CD or DVD, or it may take on a new
appearance based on the contents of the disc.
The music CD icon replaces the standard CD or DVD icon when-
ever a musical CD is inserted into the drive.
All removable drives, such as flash memory drives, share this
icon.
Zip disks appear with their own, unique icon — unless the Zip
software isn’t running, in which case the generic “removable
drive” icon appears instead.
Some disk icons have special attachments underneath. The two
most popular deal with networking:
A shared drive on the network available to others on a computer
network. (This addition may also appear beneath a folder icon.)
The icon in the margin shows a network drive. When your com-
puter accesses a disk drive or folder available on the network,
that drive or folder’s icon appears with pipes beneath it. That’s
your clue that the disk drive really lives elsewhere on the
network.
Drive Letters
Disk drives in your PC are assigned famous letters of the alphabet,
starting with A and moving on from there. This is a historical thing
with PCs, dating back to the first PC, which lacked a hard drive.
That explains why the drive letter assignment isn’t exactly logical.
 Drive A: Drive A is reserved for the PC’s floppy drive, even if
your PC doesn’t have a floppy drive.
 Drive B: Drive B isn’t used on modern PCs. Originally, it was
assigned to the PC’s second floppy drive.
Drive Letters
73

 Drive C: Drive C is the first hard drive. This is the PC’s main
hard drive, the one on which the operating system (Windows)
is found.
 Drive D: Drive letters D and up are assigned to any additional
hard drives and then to removable drives inside the PC. They’re
assigned in sequence as the computer’s software recognizes the
drives when the PC first starts.
 Drive Z: The highest letter allowed for any disk drive on your
PC is drive letter Z.
It’s important to remember that not every PC uses the same letter
for the same types of drives. Just because drive D is the CD-ROM
on your computer doesn’t mean that drive D is always the CD-ROM
drive on every PC.
Flash Memory Drives
The PC is designed to instantly recognize any flash memory drive
attached to a USB port. Some drives may be plugged in directly,
such as the USB jump drive. Other drives may require a card
reader, such as a CompactFlash card reader, into which the
memory card is plugged.
One big advantage to the flash memory drive is that you can use
the drive to move information between computers. That was once
the floppy disk’s job, but flash memory drives hold far more infor-
mation than floppy disks. They’re also compact and portable and
don’t require batteries or other nuisances.
Another advantage: Your digital camera most likely stores images
on a flash memory drive or media card. As long as your PC has a
compatible card reader, you can easily transfer the images from
your camera to the computer.
Several things may happen when a flash memory drive is plugged
into the computer:
 A dialog box appears, asking what you want to do with the disk.
See also “Controlling the AutoPlay notice.”
 An icon for the disk appears in the My Computer window.
 A program may automatically run.
 The disk is assigned a drive letter.
Programs can access the disk and its files after Windows has suc-
cessfully mounted the disk, or added it to your computer system.
74
Part V: Disk Drives

Do not remove a flash memory drive while the computer is still
using it!
See also Part II for information on removing, or unmounting, flash
memory drives.
The Floppy Drive
The former king of removable disk storage was the floppy drive
and its floppy disk.
For years, the development of the floppy disk paralleled the devel-
opment of the PC. Floppy disks grew from storing only 180KB of
information on a single-sided 51⁄4-inch disk (that was really floppy),
to storing 1.44MB of information on a double-sided 31⁄2-inch disk.
But there the floppy disk development stopped.
Computer memory capacity increased. Hard drive storage capacity
increased. Combine that with the coming of the computer CD, and
the floppy drive’s future was doomed from the early 1990s. Even
so, many PCs still come with floppy disks, mostly for compatibility.
Sadly, the typical floppy disk still holds only a paltry 1.44MB of
information — hardly enough.
The future of the floppy disk is certain: It’s doomed. Already, PCs
are being sold without those drives. If your computer has a floppy
drive, you may never use it.
The PC’s one and only floppy drive is labeled Drive A. This is con-
sistent with all PCs.
The floppy drive consumes a standard PC floppy disk. The disk is
composed of iron-oxide-coated Mylar, similar to the stuff that cas-
sette and videotape is made of, but of a much higher quality, to
store computer data.
The floppy disk is contained inside a hard-plastic, 31⁄2-inch shell.
The shell has a sliding door to protect the disk.
Don’t touch the floppy disk itself, although you can freely handle
the outer shell.
Floppy disks can be purchased at any computer or office supply
store. Buy the disks labeled IBM PC-compatible. Avoid disks for the
Macintosh or other computers.
To save time, buy floppy disks that are preformatted.
The Floppy Drive
75

Inserting a floppy disk
Floppy disks must be inserted into the floppy drive in order for
them to be useful. Stick the disk into the drive with the label side
up and the metal cover in first.
After you push the disk in almost all the way, the drive mechanism
grabs the disk and quickly pulls it in the rest of the way. This makes
a pleasing “thunk” sound.
Ejecting a floppy disk
Don’t eject any floppy disk you’re still using. Be certain that all the
files you’ve opened are saved and closed. Be certain that any open
window displaying the floppy disk’s contents is closed.
To eject the disk, push the ejection button by the floppy disk’s
hole. This pushes the disk out of the drive just a tiny bit. Pinch the
disk with your fingers and remove it the rest of the way.
Formatting floppies
Unlike with any other type of disk, a floppy disk must be formatted
before you can use it. This formatting is merely a technical process
that prepares the disk for use, for storing information.
Formatting can also be done to completely erase a disk and start
over afresh. In this case, it’s also referred to as reformatting.
Here’s how you format or reformat a floppy disk:
1. Insert the floppy disk into Drive A.
Any information already on the disk is erased by formatting.
Do not format any disk you do not want to fully erase.
2. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
3. Select Drive A, the floppy drive.
4. Choose File➪Format.
There’s no need to mess with any of the settings in the Format
dialog box. If you’re merely reformatting a disk, however, you
can click the Quick Format option, which saves some time.
5. Click the Start button.
6. If a warning dialog box appears, click the OK button to con-
tinue with the format operation.
7. Wait and watch; this takes some time.
76
Part V: Disk Drives

If the disk fails to format, you can try again: Start over with
Step 2. Or, you can try formatting the disk on another PC. The
tolerances of floppy drives varies from PC to PC. Or, you can
just toss the floppy disk out.
8. Click OK to confirm that formatting is complete.
You can optionally remove the disk here, insert another floppy
disk, and click the Start button to format the disk.
9. When you’re done, click the Close button to dismiss the
Format dialog box.
10. Use your floppy disk.
Copying a file to Drive A
A floppy disk is used just like any other disk in your computer
system. You merely choose that disk from a window or from the
Address bar’s drop-down list. Then, you can start using the files
stored on a floppy disk.
To copy a file to Drive A, regard these steps:
1. Ensure that a formatted floppy disk is in Drive A.
2. Select the file or group of files.
3. Choose File➪Send To➪31⁄2 Floppy (A:) from the menu.
To copy files from Drive A, follow these steps:
1. Insert the floppy disk into Drive A.
2. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
3. Open the floppy drive (A) icon.
4. Select the files to copy.
5. Choose Edit➪Copy to Folder.
6. Use the Copy Items dialog box to locate a destination for the
files you want to copy.
You can choose another disk drive from the list, or a specific
folder on a disk drive.
7. Click the Copy button to copy the files from Drive A.
Remember to remove the floppy disk from Drive A when you’re
done with it.
See also Part VI, for more information on working with files.
The Floppy Drive
77

Floppy do’s and don’ts
Don’t save information directly to a floppy disk. Save to the hard
drive first; use the floppy disk only for copies of information.
Don’t download information from the Internet directly to a floppy
disk. Someone somewhere offered this as a “tip” once, but it’s not a
tip. It’s a gross mistake because the floppy disk cannot handle most
downloads. Download to the hard drive, which is why your PC has
a hard drive.
Remember to remove the floppy disk when you’re done with it. If
you forget, the PC may try to start itself from the floppy disk, which
results in an error message. (Remove the disk in that case, and
then press the Enter key to continue starting the PC.)
Don’t try to eject or remove a floppy disk when the floppy drive’s
light is on. The light indicates that the computer is reading the
disk. It’s a bad thing to remove a floppy disk while the computer is
reading from that disk.
Floppy disks come with labels. Use them! Peel and stick the label
on the disk and give the disk a descriptive name.
Don’t use a sticky note as a floppy disk’s label. Those notes can
peel off and get stuck inside the drive.
Don’t insert a floppy disk into a Zip disc or CD-ROM drive.
Likewise, don’t try to wedge a floppy disk into one of the PC’s cool-
ing vents.
Don’t remove a floppy disk from the drive until you’re done with it.
That means that any open window referring to the floppy disk is
closed and that any files you’ve opened from the floppy disk are
saved and closed.
Avoid getting a floppy disk wet.
Don’t leave a floppy disk in direct sunlight because it will warp and
damage the disk.
Don’t leave the floppy disk around magnets, which erases the
disk’s contents. Magnets can be found in speakers, so don’t leave a
floppy disk on or near your PC’s speakers.
Avoid the temptation to use a floppy disk as a drink coaster.
Floppy disks go bad over time. That’s because the disk itself is
being rubbed by the drive as information is written to and read
from the disk. Therefore, don’t keep any valuable information on
the floppy disk only.
78
Part V: Disk Drives

Hard Disks and Drives
This is the skinny on the hard disk/hard drive puzzle: The hard
drive is the physical unit. It’s the whole enchilada. A hard disk lives
inside the hard drive. So, unlike a floppy drive, where the floppy
disk can be removed from the floppy drive, the hard disk inside
the hard drive isn’t going anywhere.
Technically, you should use the term hard drive to refer to the
main source of long-term storage inside your PC: Drive C, Drive D,
and so on.
Another term for a hard drive is a fixed disk because the disk
cannot be removed. It’s “fixed” inside the hard drive. (In this sense,
fixed means immobile, not repaired.)
All PCs have at least one hard drive, which is called Drive C.
Your PC can have additional hard drives, given letters D and higher.
External hard drives can also be added to the system.
It’s possible for one physical hard drive to be split up into separate
or logical hard drives. For example, a 100GB hard drive can be par-
titioned into two 50GB hard drives. This partitioning is usually done
at the factory or when the disk is first installed.
Putting a Drive’s Shortcut Icon 
on the Desktop
One way to make a disk drive handy is to put a shortcut to that
drive on the desktop. Here are those all-important steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Click to select the drive icon you want to place on the desktop.
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
4. Close the My Computer window.
5. Right-click the desktop.
6. Choose Paste Shortcut from the pop-up menu.
The drive’s icon now appears as a shortcut on the desktop for
handy access.
You can rename the icon by using the standard file-renaming com-
mand (see also Part VII).
Putting a Drive’s Shortcut Icon on the Desktop
79

You can also put shortcuts to folders on the desktop (see also
Part VII).
It’s okay to delete a shortcut icon, even a shortcut icon for a disk
drive. This doesn’t erase the drive or remove the drive from your
system; you can always access the drive from the My Computer
window.
Types of Drives
There are many things a PC can use that fall under the general term
drive or disk drive. The bottom line is that these things are all
media, or permanent storage.
Most PCs come with the three standard types of permanent stor-
age, or disk drives:
 Hard drive: Primary storage. Pluses: Fast, cheap, high capacity.
Minus: Not removable.
 Floppy drive: Secondary storage. Pluses: Widely used, remov-
able. Minuses: Very low capacity, unreliable.
 CD-ROM drive: Massive storage and distribution of new soft-
ware. Pluses: Removable, widely used, reliable. Minuses: Read-
only, slow.
These types of disk drives or permanent storage are also popular:
 DVD drive: The super CD; stores almost seven times what a CD
can hold. Pluses: Widely used, removable. Minuses: Read-only,
slow.
 Recordable CD/DVD drives (of various types): An outstanding
choice for removable, recordable media. Pluses: Recordable,
removable. Minuses: Confusion over DVD recordable formats,
some incompatibilities.
 Flash memory: Another handy form of removable storage.
Pluses: Inexpensive, common, easy to use. Minuses: Relatively
low capacity, slow.
 Zip disc: A great floppy disk replacement. Pluses: Easy to use,
high-capacity compared to floppies, good support. Minuses:
Not universally used, disks are expensive, slow.
80
Part V: Disk Drives

There are even more forms of permanent storage. At one time or
another, these were various disk drives you could have attached
to a PC:
 WORM drive: The Write-Once Read Many removable drive was
popular in the early 1990s, but never really gained wide use. It’s
really not necessary now that recordable CDs and DVDs are
used.
 MO drive: The magneto-optical drive was a removable disk
format that recorded multiple megabytes on a single disk. As
with the WORM drive, recordable CDs and DVDs have made
this drive obsolete.
 Bernoulli drive: A high-capacity removable disk system of the
early 1990s; it eventually evolved into the Zip disc system.
 Tape backup or DAT drive: These drives were once popular for
PC backups, but are now found only in use on high-end servers.
 Removable hard drive: A temporary solution for folks who
wanted removable information in high capacities; it was
replaced by recordable CDs and DVDs, though various remov-
able hard drive systems are still available and in use.
 Super floppy drive: A one-time solution for the obsolete floppy
drive, the SuperDrive ate floppy disks as well as its own high-
capacity disks.
 Jaz drive: The Zip disc’s big brother is capable of holding giga-
bytes of information.
Some of these more esoteric drives may still be available; I believe
Iomega (the Zip disc people) still makes the Jaz drive. Others were
temporary solutions to problems long since solved in the technical
arena.

The Stuff
You Create
T
he list of things a computer can do grows longer every year, as
PCs become more powerful and people discover new and crazy
things that they can do with computers. One of the things you do a
lot on your PC is create stuff. Or, maybe you collect stuff, such as
programs, videos, music, and other whatnot from the Internet.
On the computer, the stuff you create is stored in a compact unit
called a file. A file is nothing more than a collection of stuff — data,
information, text, music, and graphics, for example — stored in a
compact unit. On your CD player, stuff comes on a CD. In a library,
stuff is stored in books. On your PC, stuff is stored in files. And, you
can do many things with files, mostly to keep them organized and
keep yourself from going insane.

About a File
The file itself is a collection of stuff on disk. The contents can be
anything, thanks to the versatility of the computer. Even so, the
contents are the most important part about the file, just as the con-
tents of a container are more important than the container itself.
The file is merely a bunch of binary digits — raw computer infor-
mation. In fact, the file really doesn’t know what its contents are.
Other things tell the operating system about what’s in a file, but on
a basic level, all files are merely digital information stored inside
the computer.
Files are stored on disk. They are created in memory, but then that
information is saved into the file “unit” on a disk drive.
On the PC, files are stored primarily on the hard drive.
Files can also be stored on removable disks, floppy disks, or flash
drives and burned onto CD or DVD recordable discs.
Another term for the stuff inside a file is data. Data is just the fancy
computer term for “stuff” or “information.”
Describing a file
As with other things that exist, there are various ways to describe a
file. These ways are called file attributes. Here are just a few of the
attributes used to describe a file stored on your computer, as well
as to tell the operating system about the file’s contents:
 Filename: The name used to identify the file. The name is given
when the file is first saved to disk. Hopefully, the name is
descriptive and not too long.
 Filename extension: The last part of the filename, in which a
one- to-four-character code gives a hint about the file’s contents
or the type of file.
 File type: A term related to the filename extension. It gives a
clue to the file’s contents or the program that created it.
 Icon: In the Windows graphical environment, the tiny pictures
given to files to represent their presence. The icon that appears
depends on the file type, which the computer knows by reading
in the filename extension.
 File size: The number of bytes, or characters, that the file
occupies.
84
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

 File creation date: The date that the file was first created and
saved to disk.
 File modified date: The date the file was last written to,
changed, or modified.
 Attributes: Determines whether the file is hidden (invisible), is
a system file, is compressed, has been backed up, is read-only,
or has a number of other interesting effects or conditions.
Even more tidbits of information are available about a file, but
those are too technical to bother with here.
Common file icons
There are zillions of icons for the zillions of types of files that exist.
Even so, certain files are common and identified by common icons.
Here’s a small sampling:

About a File
85

The Generic icon is assigned to files that don’t have a specific type.
After all, every file must have an icon.
Viewing file details in Windows Explorer
The best way to get more information about a file is to view it, to
locate that file by using the Windows Explorer program (see also
Part VII) and look at the file.
Immediately, the file’s icon tells you a bit about the file, especially if
you can recognize the file’s icon. Otherwise, to see more informa-
tion, you have two options.
First, use the Details information panel on the left side of the
window. This area displays brief file details on any individual icon
selected.
Second, you can choose to view the folder window in Details view.
Choose View➪Details from the menu. This action changes the
window’s display to show files in a list, with columns describing
further information.
The columns display various attributes about the file: name, size,
file type, date, and other optional information.
You can adjust the columns, and the window’s display, in many
ways:
 The list of files can be sorted based on any column; simply click
the column header. Click the same column header again to sort
the list in reverse order.
 The column used to sort the list has a triangle by its name. The
triangle points up or down, depending on how the column is
sorted (in ascending or descending order).
 Columns can easily be rearranged. Use the mouse to drag a
column heading left or right. This action changes the column
order. For example, to put the Type column before the Size
column, drag the Type column heading to the left of the Size
column.
 Columns can be resized by dragging the right edge of the
column’s heading left or right. Double-clicking the right edge
resizes the column’s width to match the widest item in that
column.
86
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

You can add or remove columns from the Windows Explorer win-
dows, in Details view: Right-click the mouse on any header. This
action displays a menu full of optional headers. Selected headers
have check marks by them.
If you choose the More option from the header menu, a Choose
Details dialog box appears. That’s a more manageable place to
choose which details to hide or show in Windows Explorer, in
Details view.
Not every potential column applies to every file. Most columns
describe attributes of music files.
A file’s Properties dialog box
Information about any file can be discovered by viewing the file’s
Properties dialog box. To see it, right-click the file’s icon and
choose the Properties command from the pop-up menu.
A file’s Properties dialog box has two or more tabs. The first one is
the General tab, which offers lots of descriptive information about
the file.

The other tabs offer further descriptive information about the file
or, depending on the type of file, can be used to modify settings or
control certain specifics of the file.
Creating Files
Files come into existence in one of three ways:
 You use software on your computer to create something and
save that stuff to disk as a file.
 You copy a file from another computer, either over a network or
from a removable disk.
 You download a file from the Internet.
No matter what, all files are created on some computer somewhere.
The file starts out as something in memory, which is then saved to
a disk somewhere as a file. From there, it can go anywhere, by
moving to other computers across a network or the Internet or
being transferred between two computers on a removable disk.
The operating system, as well as other programs, creates files as
needed. These are typically temporary files. The temporary files
are deleted when they’re no longer needed.

Part VI: The Stuff You Create

Finding Lost Files
Files get lost all the time. They’re misplaced or they’re copied or
saved into the wrong folder, or you may just forget whatever crazy
names you assigned to them. Lost files happen to beginners and
experienced users and organized and unorganized users alike.
The following sections are specific to Windows XP. (The methods
for finding files in earlier versions of Windows are radically
different.)
Summoning the Search Companion
In Windows XP, it’s the Search Companion that helps you locate
long-lost files. The Search Companion is a special task pane on the
left side of the Windows Explorer window. It can be summoned in
several ways:
 Click the Search button.
 Choose View➪Explorer Bar➪Search.
 Press Ctrl+E.
 Press the F3 key.
 Choose the Search command from the Start button’s menu.
This section assumes that you know how to summon the Search
Companion window.
Yes, you can mix and match options. The more information you
can provide about a missing file, the easier (and faster) Windows
finds it.
When the Search Companion finds files, they’re listed in the
window, similar to the way Windows Explorer displays files in
Details view. After the files are listed, you can click to select a file
and then manipulate it however you want. To open the folder
window where the file lives, click to select the file and choose
File➪Open Containing Folder.
Finding a file when you know its name
Summon the Search Companion and follow these steps:
1. Choose the item labeled All Files and Folders.
2. Type the name into the text box labeled All or Part of the File
Name.
As it says, you can type part of the name, all of the name, or
even something remotely close to the name.
Finding Lost Files
89

3. Choose where to look for the file from the drop-down list
labeled Look In.
You can limit the search to the My Documents folder (and its
subfolders) or search other disk drives or other parts of Drive
C. The more places you search, the longer the search takes.
4. Click the Search button.
Finding a file when you just created it recently
Beckon forth the Search Companion and pursue these steps:
1. Choose the item labeled All Files and Folders.
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow by the item labeled When
Was It Modified?
3. Select a duration, either by choosing from the list or entering
specific dates where prompted.
4. Click the Search button.
Finding a file when you know 
what type of file it is
Muster the Search Companion and heed these steps:
1. Choose the item labeled All Files and Folders.
2. Click the downward-pointing arrow by the item labeled More
Advanced Options.
3. Choose the application that created the file, or the file type,
from the drop-down list labeled Type of File.
4. Click the Search button.
Finding a file when you know that it 
contains a specific word
Conjure up the Search Companion and incant these steps:
1. Choose the item labeled All Files and Folders.
2. Type the text to find into the box labeled A Word or Phrase in
the File.
3. Because this search tends to be the most time-consuming type
that Windows does, any further information you can specify
is useful.
4. Click the Search button.

Part VI: The Stuff You Create

Managing Files
To help keep your files organized, Windows supplies you with a
host of file-manipulating tools. You can copy, move, delete, and
undelete files.
Copying files
When you copy a file, you create a duplicate of that file — an exact
copy — in another folder or on another disk drive. In Windows,
there are many ways to do this. Here are the most popular ways to
copy a single file or group of select files:
Copy and paste. Select the files to be copied and choose Edit➪
Copy from the menu. Open the folder or disk drive window where
you want to place the copies. In that window, choose the Edit➪
Paste command.
Copy to folder. Select the files to be copied and choose Edit➪Copy
to Folder from the menu. Use the Copy to Folder window to locate
the disk drive or folder for the file copies. Click to select that folder,
and then click the Copy button.
Dragging to copy. You need to have two windows open and visible
on the desktop: the folder containing the original file and the folder
to which you want to copy the file. Press and hold the Ctrl key on
the keyboard, and then use the mouse to drag the file from one
window to the other. (Pressing the Ctrl key ensures that the file is
copied and not moved.)
You can use these techniques to copy a file to another folder on the
same hard drive or to another disk drive.
Duplicating files
A file duplicate is merely a copy of a file made in the same folder:
1. Select the file to be duplicated.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The file is duplicated in the same folder, but with the text “Copy of”
prefixed to its name. The duplicate has the same contents, is the
same size, and is the same type of file as the original.
See also “Making file shortcuts.”
Managing Files
91

Moving files
When you move a file, you create a duplicate of that file — just like
a file copy, but the original is then destroyed. Windows has many
commands for moving a file or group of selected files, and these are
the most popular:
Cut and Paste. Select the files you want to move and then, from the
menu, choose Edit➪Cut. The file isn’t deleted at this point, but is
ready to be moved. Next, open the folder or disk drive window
where you want to move the files. Choose the Edit➪Paste com-
mand from that window’s menu. The file is then moved; the original
is deleted.
Move to Folder. Select the files you want to move and choose
Edit➪Copy to Folder. In the Move to Folder window, choose the
disk drive or folder where you want to move the file. Select that
folder, and then click the Move button.
Dragging to Move. Open two folder windows on the desktop. The
first window contains the file to be moved. The second window is
the folder or disk drive to where you want the file moved. Use the
mouse to drag the file from the first window to the second. If you’re
dragging the file to another disk drive, press and hold the Shift key
while you drag the mouse; that action ensures that the file is
moved and not copied.
Making file shortcuts
A shortcut is the same thing as a file copy, but without all the bulk
of making a file copy. In a way, the shortcut is simply a placeholder
icon. Internally, the icon references the original file so that when
you open the shortcut, the original file opens instead.
Creating a shortcut works just like copying a file with the Edit➪
Copy command. The difference is that you make the shortcut by
using Edit➪Paste Shortcut.
A shortcut icon is flagged by a tiny arrow in its lower-left corner.
You can move, copy, rename, or delete a shortcut icon. Doing so
doesn’t affect the original file.
Moving, renaming, or deleting the original icon doesn’t update the
shortcut icon. In this case, the shortcut may get “lost.” When you
try to open the shortcut, Windows attempts to locate the original
for you.
It’s important to remember that a file shortcut works only on your
computer. You cannot e-mail a file shortcut to another computer
and have it work. If you need to send a copy of a file to another
computer, send a copy of the original; don’t create a shortcut.
92
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

Deleting files
To delete a file, click to select the file’s icon and choose File➪Delete
from the menu. You can also use the Delete key on the computer’s
keyboard as a shortcut.
A warning may appear when you delete a file, to confirm that you
really want to delete it.
Deleting a file sends it to the Recycle Bin, where it sits and awaits
undeleting. But, note that after a while, all files are purged from the
Recycle Bin; therefore, don’t be casual when you’re deleting files
you may want to recover later.
Permanently deleting files
If you want to delete a file permanently, select the file’s icon and
press Shift+Delete on the keyboard. This action doesn’t transfer the
file to the Recycle Bin, but instead utterly removes it from your
computer system. This type of deleted file cannot be recovered by
using Windows.
Undeleting files
To recover a file you deleted, you must rescue it from the
Recycle Bin:
1. Open the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop.
2. Choose View➪Details.
This step arranges the items in the bin by columns, which
makes it easier to sort and sift through them for what you
want.
3. If you know the filename, click the Name column heading to
sort the deleted files by name; if you know the date the file
was deleted, click the Date Deleted column head.
4. Click to select the files you want to undelete.
5. Choose File➪Restore from the menu.
The file is returned to the folder from which it was deleted.
6. Close the Recycle Bin window.
Note that you cannot preview or open files stored in the
Recycle Bin.
If you want to put the file in another folder, follow the preceding
steps to restore it to its original folder, and then move it to the
folder you want after it has been restored.

93

Naming and Renaming Files
All files in the computer need to be given a name. Here are the
official rules:
 Filenames can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and most of
the symbols you find on the computer keyboard.
 A filename must be at least one character long.
 Filenames can be up to 254 characters long.
 Filenames cannot contain these specific characters:
“  *  /  :  ?  \  |  <  >
 Contrary to popular myth, you can start a filename with a
number or punctuation symbol.
 Two files in the same folder cannot have the same name.
Short, descriptive filenames are best. (As filenames get longer, it’s
more difficult to see their full names displayed in a folder window.)
Windows isn’t case sensitive when it comes to filenames. You can
use upper- or lowercase letters, but internally Windows sees all
files as uppercase. Note that other operating systems, as well as
many Web page addresses, are case sensitive.
Although spaces are allowed in a filename, many users opt to use
underlines instead. For example:
Special_Finance_Report
The filename extension
A very special and important part of a filename is its extension.
This is the last part of a filename, which begins with a period and is
followed by up to four characters. Those characters are used in
Windows to identify the file type.
See also “Common file icons” for a sample list of filename
extensions.
Renaming a file
You can change the name of a file by using the Rename command:
1. Select the file or icon you want to rename.
2. Choose File➪Rename from the menu.
94
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

3. Type the file’s new name.
4. Press the Enter key to lock in the new name.
If Windows doesn’t let you rename a file, you’re probably using a
forbidden character in the name or trying to use the name of a file
already in the folder. Try again.
When you rename a file, don’t rename its extension. Doing so
changes the file type, which isn’t correct because renaming a file
doesn’t change the file’s contents. (The extension may or may not
be visible in the folder window; see also Part VII.)
You can use the standard Windows editing keys when you rename a
file. You can move the cursor left or right, select text, delete or
insert text, and do just about anything else that you can do with
regular text when you rename a file.
Filename wildcards
Windows uses two characters, * and ?, as wildcards when specify-
ing filenames. These wildcards can be used when you’re searching
for files, to help narrow or expand the search when you may not
know all of a file’s name.
The ? character is used to represent any single character in a
filename.
The * character is used to represent a group of characters in a
filename. Or, the * can be used by itself to represent all files.
Two other wildcards exist: . (dot) and .. (dot-dot). The single dot
represents the current folder, or all the files in the current folder.
The double dot represents the parent folder. See also Part VII for
more information on folders and parent folders.
Opening Files
To work on a file — a document, graphical image, music file, or any-
thing you have created or collected — you need to open that file on
disk. There are several ways to do this:
 Locate the file’s icon somewhere in a folder window. Double-
click the icon to open it, which also starts the program that
created the file.
 Locate a shortcut icon to the file. Opening the shortcut opens
the original file itself.
Opening Files
95

 Open the application that you will use to work on the file.
Choose File➪Open from the menu and use the Open dialog box
to locate the file on whatever disk drive or whatever folder the
file was last saved. The keyboard shortcut for File➪Open is
Ctrl+O.
 From the Start button’s menu, locate the My Recent Documents
submenu and choose the file from there (only recently opened
files appear on the list).
Opening a file opens the application that created that file — unless
another application has priority. For example, opening a Paint doc-
ument (graphical image) in Windows XP displays the image in the
Windows Picture and Fax Viewer program, not Paint.
When Windows cannot locate a program to open a file, it displays
an Open With dialog box. The best thing to do in this case is click
the Cancel button. Windows cannot open the program, or the appli-
cation that created the program isn’t available.
To open a file in a specific program, right-click the file’s icon and
choose Open With from the pop-up menu. Then, you can select a
specific program from the Open With submenu, and the file is
opened by that program.
Pathnames
A pathname is like an address. This is easy to understand if you use
the Internet; a pathname is similar to a Web page address except
that the pathname refers to locations on your computer and not on
the Internet.
A pathname has several parts, some of which are optional:
 Drive letter. The drive letter is always followed by a colon.
 Folders. Starting with the root folder, represented by a single
backslash, the pathname lists each folder up to the specified
location. Each folder name is separated by a backslash
character.
 Filename. After the last backslash comes an optional filename,
complete with extension.
A full pathname contains all these elements. It starts with a drive
letter and colon, and then it lists folders down to a filename. For
example:
C:\Windows\System32\Restore\rstrui.exe
96
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

The full pathname starts with a drive letter, colon, and folders sep-
arated by backslashes, and then ends with a filename. To get to
that file, you follow the path: Change to Drive C; change to the
Windows folder, the System32 folder, and then the Restore folder;
and then you can locate the RSTRUI.EXE program.
A full pathname can be used to run or open any program or file.
The full pathname is merely a specific name telling the computer
where to find a file.
A partial pathname may be used to give the location for some files.
For example, you may tell a co-worker to find the graphics files on
this path on your computer:
My Documents\Projects\2005\Summer\2341\Images
Using the path, you know to start in the My Documents folder and
then open the following folders: Projects, 2005, Summer, 2341, and,
finally, the Images folder.
The drive letter can be replaced by the name of another computer
on the network. In this case, the pathname becomes a network
path. For example:
\\MING\Shared\current
The two backslashes at the start of the path identify a network
pathname. The network computer is named MING. The folder being
shared by MING is named Shared. The subfolder named current
is the location the network pathname refers to.
You often see pathnames specified on the Windows Explorer
Address bar.
Saving Files
Files are created by saving your stuff to disk. You work in a pro-
gram. You make something. To keep it, you save it to disk.
Saving is simple: The computer does all the hard work. But the idea
is important. You must save your stuff to disk so that you can have
it later, just to keep, to modify, to print, or to do whatever you will.
But, to do all that stuff, you have to save your stuff in the first place.
Saving for the first time
Saving is a very common task, so it has a universal command:
File➪Save. From the keyboard, the shortcut is Ctrl+S. This is con-
sistent for just about every program in Windows.
Saving Files
97

When you save something for the first time, a special Save As
dialog box appears. It allows you to do up to four things:
 Assign a descriptive name to the file.
 Choose a location for the file.
 Create a new folder for the file (if necessary).
 Save the file as a special type (if necessary).
You don’t have to type the filename extension when you’re saving a
file. The application automatically adds the proper extension for
the type of file being saved.
Saving after the first time
After the file is saved for the first time, it’s associated with the file-
name and location you specified in the Save As dialog box. To save
the file again, which updates the file already on disk, you choose
File➪Save or use the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.
Saving a file after the first time is easy. By using the Save command,
you simply update the existing file on disk with any updates you
have made to the document or image you’re working on.
Save often.
Closing a document
The last thing you do with a document is close it. When you’re
done working on the document, or when you’re done with the pro-
gram, you can choose File➪Close from the menu. If the document
needs to be saved, you’re asked to save it one last time. Then, the
document is closed, safely saved on disk.
The keyboard shortcut for the Close command is Ctrl+W. This is
common to most, but not all, programs.
If you just plan on quitting a program (you’re done for the day),
you can use the File➪Exit command to both close the document
(saving it to disk) and quit the program. The keyboard shortcut for
closing a program is Alt+F.
Selecting Icons
To work with more than one file at a time, you must select multiple
files. These selected files can then be manipulated as a group,
which saves time over repeatedly issuing commands on single files.
File commands in a folder affect all selected files.
98
Part VI: The Stuff You Create

Files can be selected in only one folder at a time. If you need to
work with files in multiple folders, you must do so one folder
window at a time.
You can do anything to a group of files that you can do to a single
file — delete, copy, or move, for example. An exception is renaming
a group of files. In that case, the group is given the same name, fol-
lowed by a sequential number.
This section discusses the many techniques for selecting a group
of files.
Selecting a single icon
To select a single icon, click it with the mouse. The icon is then
highlighted, indicating that it has been selected for action.
Selecting all icons in a window
To select all the icons in a folder window, choose Edit➪Select All
from the menu. The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+A.
Selecting two or more individual icons
To select individual icons, it’s best to use the Ctrl+click technique:
1. Press and hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard.
Either Ctrl (control) key works.
2. Click each icon that you want selected.
Each icon you click becomes selected, as long as you keep the Ctrl
key down while clicking with the mouse.
Note that an icon stays selected even if you need to scroll around
the window to search for new icons.
If you click the mouse (no Ctrl key) anywhere in the window, all
selected files become deselected and you have to start over again.
Lassoing a group of icons
To select a group of icons, drag the mouse over them. This is best
done in Icon view: Choose View➪Icons from the menu. Then, point
the mouse above and to the left of the icons to be selected. Drag
the mouse down and to the right to “lasso” them, or select a chunk
of them at once.
Selecting all but one icon
There are two quick ways to select all but one icon in a window.
Selecting Icons
99

The first method is to choose Edit➪Select All to select all icons on
the menu. Then, press and hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and
click the mouse on the sole icon you want unselected. Release the
Ctrl key.
The second method is to select the one icon you do not want to
select. Then, choose Edit➪Invert Selection from the menu.
Selecting all but a few icons
Start by selecting all the icons you don’t want selected. Use
Ctrl+click to pick those out. Then, choose Edit➪Invert selection to
select every other icon in the window.
Selecting icons in a range
To choose icons in a range, you first need to create the range.
Choose View➪List from the menu to display the icons in a list.
Then, you can choose View➪Arrange Icons By and choose a
method to list the icons from the submenu: by date, size, name, or
type, for example.
Click the mouse to select the first icon in the range. Then, press
and hold the Shift key and click the last icon in the range. This
action selects all icons between the first click and the Shift+click.
Selecting two ranges of icons
To select multiple ranges of icons, follow the instructions in the
preceding subsection. To select the second range, press and hold
the Ctrl key. Keep the Ctrl key down and click the first icon in the
range. Release the Ctrl key. Press and hold Ctrl+Shift and click the
last icon in the second range. Release Ctrl+Shift.
Deselecting an icon from a group
Pressing and holding the Ctrl key while you click a selected icon
unselects that icon. Release the Ctrl key when you’re done
deselecting.

Part VI: The Stuff You Create

Organizing Your
Stuff
A
s you use your computer, you collect and create stuff. Windows
provides you with a few handy tools to help keep that stuff
organized. Sadly, there are no suggestions or even tight rules for
using those tools. Organization, it seems, is up to you.
On the whole, organization is a good thing. The more organized you
keep your stuff, the better you can find it when you need it. That’s
the important part. Being organized makes your computer experi-
ence all the better. And, who wouldn’t be thankful for that?

Part VII

About Folders
Folders are containers for files — just like in the real world.
In a computer, a folder can hold a huge, virtually unlimited, number
of files. Of course, you don’t want to pack zillions of files into a
single folder. That would defeat the purpose. Instead, folders are
used to keep like files together.
A folder in Windows is flagged with a folder icon.
Opening the folder icon displays a window. The window lists the
contents of, or files that live inside, the folder.
Folders can also contain other folders — folders within folders —
just to keep things organized.
About Windows Explorer
Windows uses a program named Windows Explorer to display the
contents of folders and to list files (icons) in a window. It’s a
Windows Explorer window you see whenever you open a folder.
To start Windows Explorer, you simply find a folder and open it.
To manually start Windows Explorer, from the Start button’s menu,
choose All Programs➪Accessories➪Windows Explorer.
The keyboard shortcut for Windows Explorer is Win+E. If your
computer keyboard lacks a Windows key, there is no keyboard
shortcut.
The left side of the window thing
In Windows XP, the left side of a Windows Explorer window shows
three different things:
 The tree structure
 The Search Companion
 Various task panes
One of these is always showing; unlike previous versions of
Windows, the dang thing will not go away.
To switch to the tree structure, click the Folders button or
choose View➪Explorer Bar➪Folders from the menu.
To switch to the Search Companion, click the Search button or
choose View➪Explorer Bar➪Search. The keyboard shortcut is
Ctrl+E.
102
Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

To see the task panes, click the X in the upper-right corner of the
Folders or Search Companion thing.
The tree structure
The tree structure lists the contents of your computer, beginning
with the desktop and then going “down” from there. The purpose
of the tree structure is to help you navigate through disk drives
and the folders on those drives to help find the location you want.
It’s a shortcut.
An item in the tree structure has a plus or minus button by it if that
item contains more information, such as a folder containing a sub-
folder.
Clicking the plus button opens a folder to reveal its contents.
Clicking the minus button closes a folder.
You can also use the keyboard to navigate through the tree
structure:
Key

The Search Companion
The Search Companion is used to find wayward files. This subject
is covered in detail in Part VI.
The task pane
The task pane shows several areas of interest with shortcuts to
common commands, links to other places, and detailed information
about whatever is selected in the Windows Explorer window.
File and Folder Tasks. This pane lists common commands or
actions to take, depending on what is selected in the Windows
Explorer window.
Other Places. This pane lists other locations in Windows related to
whatever item is selected.
About Windows Explorer
103

Details. This pane shows information about the selected files —
even a preview if a graphics file is selected.
Each of the panes can be open or shut by clicking the chevrons
in their upper-right corners.
The Address bar
The Address bar is an optional toolbar you can use to help 
increase the power of the Windows Explorer window. The Address
bar displays the name of the current folder and the path to the cur-
rent folder, or it can be used to enter a Web page address. And, if
you know a pathname to a folder, you can type it on the Address
bar, though that’s a rather geeky thing to do.
To view the Address bar, choose View➪Toolbars➪Address Bar
from the menu.
To see full pathnames displayed on the Address bar, obey these
steps:
1. In Windows Explorer, choose Tools➪Folder Options.
2. Click the View tab.
3. Put a check mark by the item labeled Display the Full Path in
the Address Bar.
4. Click OK.
Compressed (ZIP) Folders
A special type of folder in Windows is the compressed folder, also
known as a ZIP file. This folder holds other files (and folders), just
like any other folder in Windows. But the files inside it are com-
pressed and take up less disk space.
Compressed folders aren’t really used like regular folders for stor-
ing files. Instead, they work like shipping containers: You put into a
compressed folder any stuff that you want to store or perhaps ship
via e-mail elsewhere. The compressed folder keeps the various files
together, plus it takes up less space, which makes the file-sending
task take less time.
In Windows XP, compressed folders have their own, special
zipper icon.
Note that the contents of compressed folders aren’t usually
searched when Windows performs a file search.
104
Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

Making a compressed folder
To create a compressed folder, choose File➪New➪Compressed
(zipped) Folder. The new folder appears with the name New
Compressed (zipped) Folder.zip.
Yes, you can rename the compressed folder, just as you would any
other file or folder.
You can also create a compressed folder by first selecting one or
more files in a window. To place those selected files into a com-
pressed folder, choose File➪Send To➪Compressed (zipped) Folder.
The files are packed into the compressed folder and given the
name of the first file selected (but with the ZIP file extension).
Adding files to a compressed folder
Adding files to a compressed folder works just like adding files to
any other folder: You can drag and drop, open the window, and
copy and paste.
You cannot, however use the Move This File or Copy This File com-
mand. Remember that compressed folders aren’t real folders, and,
therefore, you cannot access them from a tree structure.
Extracting files
Most files cannot be accessed inside a compressed folder. Although
you can view the file’s icon, you cannot open the file. That’s
because it’s compressed and needs to be decompressed before it
can be useful.
To extract, or decompress, a file, open the compressed folder and
select the file or group of files. Then, you can choose either Copy
This File or Move This File from the File and Folder Tasks pane on
the left side of the window.
To quickly extract all files from a compressed folder, choose File➪
Extract All. The files are extracted completely and placed into a
folder that’s given the same name as the compressed folder — but
it’s a real folder with real files.
Applying a password
Unlike with other types of files in Windows, you can apply a pass-
word to your compressed folders. To do so, open the compressed
folder window and choose File➪Add a Password from the menu.
Note that you cannot open the compressed folder again without
that password. If you lose the password, the contents of the com-
pressed folder are gone forever.
Compressed (ZIP) Folders

Directories
The old, original term for a file folder was directory.
Folder is simply a newer term for directory.
A subfolder is the same thing as a subdirectory.
The root folder can also be called the root directory.
Although Microsoft shuns the term directory, occasionally you still
see it used in documentation and bandied about by old-timers who
refuse to change with the times.
Folder Options
The way folders look and behave in Windows is controlled via
the Folder Options icon in the Control Panel. Opening that icon
displays the Folder Options dialog box, which you can also dis-
play by choosing Tools➪Folder Options from any Windows
Explorer window.
Two tabs in the Folder Options dialog box control how a folder
behaves: General and View.
On the General tab, you can control how folder windows work.
To show or hide the task pane in a folder window, select an option
in the Tasks area. When you select Use Windows Classic Folders,
for example, the task pane no longer shows up.
To open one window for every folder, use the Browse folders area.
There, you can choose whether opening a new folder also opens a
window or whether things stay in the same window.
Finally, the Click Item area lets you set whether one click or two
does the job of opening things.
On the View tab, you can control various details about what shows
up and what doesn’t show up in a folder window.
One item worth noting is the display of hidden files. If you want
hidden files to appear in a window, put a check mark by the item
labeled Show Hidden Files and Folders. The folders appear as
faded, ghost icons, but they show up nonetheless.
You can also elect to show all filename extensions, by removing the
check mark by the item labeled Hide Extensions to Known File
Types.
106
Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

Choosing a folder template
If you know that a specific folder will be used to hold a specific
type of file — music, graphics, text — you can customize that
folder with a template, which makes Windows really shine and
offers you the best way to view certain types of files.
To modify a folder with a template, follow these steps:
1. Locate the folder, but don’t open its window; just select the
folder icon.
2. Choose File➪Properties.
3. Click the Customize tab.
4. Select a template from the drop-down list.
You can find different templates for pictures, music, and
videos.
5. Click the OK button.
Adding an image to a folder
To put a picture on a folder icon, supposedly to remind you of the
folder’s contents, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the folder you want to modify.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. In the folder’s Properties dialog box, click the Customize tab.
4. Click the Choose Pictures button.
5. Use the Browse dialog box to locate a suitable graphical image
for the folder’s face.
6. Click the Open button when you have found and selected an
image.
7. Click the OK button.
Note that you can click the Restore Default button to remove the
picture, in case you tire of it later.
Also note that the picture shows up only in Thumbnails view.
Changing a folder icon
Rather than put a silly thumbnail picture on a folder, you can
change the folder’s icon to anything you please — or to any icon
supplied with Windows. Here’s how:
Folder Options
107

1. Right-click the folder you want to change.
2. From the pop-up menu, choose File➪Properties.
3. Click the Customize tab.
4. Click the Change Icon button.
5. Browse in the Change Icon dialog box for a new icon.
You can also use the Browse button there to locate another
icon file on the hard drive, or an icon file you may have created
yourself by using some graphics program.
6. Click OK when you have found a better icon.
7. Click the OK button.
The new icon shows up in all window views — except Thumbnail!
Managing Folders
Folders can be tossed about, battered, and bruised, just like any
file. Yet, it’s important to remember that a folder isn’t just a file; it’s
a location for other files. So, when you mess with a folder, you also
mess with the folder’s contents. Beware!
Making a new folder
Open the folder window where you want to create the new folder.
For example, to create a new folder in the My Documents folder,
open the My Documents window.
Choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu. The new folder appears
in the window, given the name New Folder. The name is selected, so
you can immediately type a new name for the folder, something
short and descriptive.
See also Part VI for file-naming rules, which also apply to folders
(though folders don’t normally have filename extensions).
Removing a folder
To remove a folder, click to select it. Then, press the Delete key on
your keyboard or choose File➪Delete from the menu.
Deleting a folder removes all the folder’s contents — files and sub-
folders. Don’t use this command casually. Never delete any folder
you did not create yourself, such as any of the Windows folders or
folders for programs.
108
Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

You can recover a deleted folder from the Recycle Bin. See also Part
VI for information on recovering a deleted file; the same directions
can be used to restore a deleted folder.
To permanently delete a folder, press Shift+Delete on the keyboard.
Renaming a folder
Folders can be renamed just like files: Click to select the folder and
choose File➪Rename from the menu. The keyboard shortcut is the
F2 key.
See also Part VI for information on renaming files, all of which
applies to folders as well.
Folders don’t need filename extensions. Even if you apply an exten-
sion to a folder, it doesn’t change the folder to a specific file type.
Copying or moving a folder
To copy or move a folder, click to select it. Then, choose Edit➪
Copy from the menu to duplicate the folder or Edit➪Cut to move it.
Open the destination folder window — the place where you want
the folder copied or moved. Then, choose Edit➪Paste from the
menu.
To create a shortcut to the folder, choose Edit➪Paste Shortcut. See
also Part VI.
Note that moving folders tends to confuse programs that try to
remember where your files are located. Don’t move folders that
contain programs because this action may render the programs
unusable.
My Downloads Folder
I recommend, as a tip, that you create a special folder for the files
you download from the Internet. This includes programs and com-
pressed folders — all that stuff should find its own, special place. I
suggest the My Downloads folder:
1. Open the My Computer folder.
2. Choose File➪New➪Folder.
3. Press the F2 key to rename the new folder.
4. For the new name, type My Downloads.
Or, you can type Downloads, though the My prefix seems to be
popular in Windows.
5. Press the Enter key to lock in the new name.
My Downloads Folder
109

Now you can use the My Downloads folder whenever you’re
prompted to save a file when you’re using Internet Explorer.
From the My Downloads folder, you can run installation programs
or extract files from compressed folders.
I recommend keeping the original files in your My Documents
folder, even after you have installed programs. That way, you can
keep a spare copy, in case you want to reinstall the program later.
The “My” Folders
Windows helps you along by doing a bit of folder organization for
you. In this case, it creates what I call the My series of folders.
Other programs may create other folders, but there are three key
My Folders:
 My Documents
 My Pictures
 My Music
The My Documents folder is the home folder for all the stuff you
create or collect. My Documents is where you should start creating
other folders as the base for organizing your stuff.
The My Pictures folder is a home base for your graphics and picture
files. It’s a subfolder of the My Documents folder.
The My Music folder is a home base for all the music files on your
computer. This folder is used by Windows Media Player, but you
can put your own files there as well.
Feel free not to use the My Pictures or My Music folders. You can
create your own folders and organize your stuff however you see
fit. But don’t bother deleting those folders. Windows own programs
assume that the folders exist — and may even re-create them if
needed.
The Root Folder
There has to be a name for the main folder on a hard drive, and
that name is root. The root folder is considered the first folder, or
occasionally the only folder, on a disk. It’s called the root because
all other folders on that drive branch out from that folder, like the
root of a tree.
The root folder is specified by a single backslash character, \.
110
Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

Don’t save any files directly in the root folder. Instead, create other
folders in which you can place your files. If you use the root, the
disk quickly becomes too crowded and confusing. Also, Windows
places restrictions on files that are allowed to be in the root folder
of Drive C.
An exception to the no-files-in-the-root-folder rule is for floppy
disks. For those disks, as well as Zip disks and most other remov-
able media, it’s okay to put files in the root. But, for long-term stor-
age, use folders instead.
Subfolders
A subfolder is merely one folder inside another folder. So, when you
create a folder named My Downloads inside the My Documents
folder, the My Downloads folder is said to be a subfolder of the My
Documents folder.
The opposite of a subfolder is a parent folder. Using the preceding
example, the My Documents folder would be the parent folder of
the My Downloads folder.
The root folder has no parent folder.
Subfolders

Part VII: Organizing Your Stuff

Printing
T
hough a printer is considered an important part of the basic
computer system, it’s really more like a separate, customized
computer all its own — complete with its own set of puzzlements
and problems. You can put in effort all day long, and even save
your stuff for good, but until it’s printed, your efforts remain
ambiguously digital. Only with that final printing duty can you
really share your work with others. The proof is in the printing.

Part VIII

Adding a Printer
As with most computer hardware, adding a printer to your com-
puter system involves both hardware and software steps.
Setting up a printer
Place the printer relatively close to your computer — within arm’s
reach so that you can pull out any paper or easily add paper.
Despite the printer’s small size, remember that it may need extra
space in front or behind to make room for paper trays that pop out
or slide open.
Don’t place the printer in direct sunlight. That may heat the printer
up and make it woefully unhappy.
Printers don’t come with cables! You must buy a cable separately.
See also Part I.
See also “Adding paper to the printer” and “Ink and Toner.”
Attaching the printer hardware
Printers plug into the wall, which is how they get their power.
Furthermore, the printer must be connected to the computer via a
printer cable. The printer cable attaches to both the printer and
the computer.
There are two types of printer cables:
 The traditional printer cable
 The USB cable
Both types of cable have two unique ends, so you cannot plug the
cable in backward.
If you attach the printer by using the traditional printer cable,
ensure that both the printer and computer are off. You can keep
either the printer or computer on when using a USB cable.
See also “Turning the Printer On and Off.”
Printer software setup
See your printer’s setup manual for specific instructions that may
be necessary to set up your printer’s software. For example, the
instructions may direct you to install special software before turn-
ing on the printer for the first time.
114
Part VIII: Printing

Some USB printers may install themselves automatically when
they’re first connected and turned on.
To confirm that a printer is installed, look for an icon representing
that printer in the Printers and Faxes window.
To manually install a printer, follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Printers and Faxes icon.
3. Choose File➪Add Printer.
This step starts the Add Printer Wizard.
4. Click the Next button.
5. Choose the option labeled Local Printer Attached to This
Computer, and don’t check the option labeled Automatically
Detect and Install My Plug and Play Printer.
If you truly have a Plug and Play printer, it would have been
installed already.
6. Click the Next button.
7. Select the proper printer port.
LPT1 is selected. This option is standard and probably the
best.
8. Click the Next button.
9. Select your printer’s manufacturer from the scrolling list on the
left, and then select the specific printer from the scrolling list
on the right.
If you cannot find your printer, the best thing to do is to try to
locate the manufacturer on the Web. From that Web page,
download the proper printer drivers for Windows XP so that
you can use the manufacturer’s printer.
10. Click the Next button.
11. Optionally, type a new name for the printer.
12. Click the Next button.
13. Click the Next button again; the sharing options aren’t impor-
tant now.
14. To print a test page, click the Yes option and then the Next
button.
15. Click the Finish button.
Adding a Printer
115

In a few seconds, you can observe the test page that’s printed. If
the test page doesn’t print, check the connection and ensure that
the printer is on-line or selected and ready to print. Try again. Or,
click the Troubleshoot button in the dialog box to begin a trou-
bleshooting session.
Adding a printer elsewhere on the network
Windows XP is very smart about networking and shared printers. If
any printers are available for use on the network, they automati-
cally show up in the Printers and Faxes window. Software to control
those printers is also automatically installed on your computer.
Using a second printer
Windows allows you to use any number of printers, printers either
directly connected to your computer or to computers on a net-
work. You can easily attach a second printer to your computer by
using a second LPT port (LPT2 — if the console has one), or multi-
ple printers by using the USB port and USB expansion hubs.
The Default Printer
Though you can use multiple printers in Windows, one of the print-
ers must be set up as your main printer. This is what Windows calls
the default printer.
The default printer is the one that Windows uses to print when you
don’t select another printer or when printing is automatic and you
have no opportunity to select another printer.
The default printer is identified in the Printer and Faxes window
with a small black circle and a check mark by its icon.
You can have only one default printer at a time, but you can change
the default printer. To set a default printer, click the printer’s icon
in the Printer and Faxes window and then choose File➪Set As
Default Printer from the menu.
Envelopes
You can print envelopes just as you print any other piece of paper
by using your computer and printer. The trick is to think of the
envelope as nothing more than a specially sized sheet of paper.
When you get that down, printing on an envelope is easy.
116
Part VIII: Printing

Configuring your document as an envelope
To set up a document as an envelope, you use the common
File➪Page Setup command, or whichever command the application
uses to format a page in a document.
The File➪Page Setup command summons a Page Setup dialog box.
In that or a similar dialog box, choose Envelope #10 as the paper
size. Usually, this option is found on a drop-down list. (Note that
you can select other special paper sizes as well, and perhaps even
enter custom envelope sizes.) Click OK and the document is prop-
erly set up to be printed as an envelope.
Printing on an envelope on the printer
Most printers have a special location to input an envelope. On
some printers, it may be a special slot. On other printers, you may
simply adjust the paper input guides to a very narrow setting to
accommodate the envelope. Regardless, most printers have mark-
ings on them to indicate where and how the envelope must be
inserted.
Be careful to note the envelope’s orientation. Because it’s easy to
improperly insert an envelope, I recommend doing a test printing
first. That way, you can determine whether to insert the envelope
face up or face down, and which edge of the envelope goes in first,
long or short.
When you have determined which way to insert the envelope, I 
recommend that you attach a note to the printer or draw on the
printer directly with a Sharpie or other pen, to remind you of which
way the envelope goes. You can use one of the icons in the follow-
ing figure as a guide.
Choose one of the icons to represent how your printer accepts
envelopes, and then draw something similar in the proper location
on your printer (if such a thing doesn’t already exist).

Part VIII: Printing

Ink and Toner
Two consumable items required by your computer’s printer are ink
and paper. Ink is necessary to throw the image down on the paper.
A pencil without lead is a stick. A printer without ink is an expen-
sive door stop.
 Inkjet printers need ink cartridges.
 Laser printers need toner cartridges.
 Older-style printers required printer ribbons.
You have to refer to your printer’s manual for specifics on remov-
ing and adding ink or toner. Note that sometimes the instructions
are easily found right under the printer’s lid.
Ink cartridges
Inkjet printers use from one to six ink cartridges, depending on the
type of printer. Ink cartridges come in these types:
 Black ink only
 Multicolor: yellow, blue, and red ink
 Multicolor: two yellow inks, two red inks, and blue or cyan ink
 Individual colors
How your inkjet printer uses ink cartridges depends on the
printer’s price and purpose. For example, professional color-photo
printers use six ink colors (including black). Some cheaper ink
printers just use three colors and no black ink.
When a color cartridge is empty — even if it’s just one color in a
multicolor cartridge — the entire thing must be replaced. That’s
why it’s better to get an ink printer that has separate cartridges,
one for each color.
Yes, ink cartridges are expensive!
Toner
Just like copy machines, laser printers use toner cartridges as their
inky substance. The toner cartridges aren’t cheap! Fortunately, you
can get more pages of paper from a single laser printer toner car-
tridge than an inkjet printer gets from a single thimble of ink.
Color laser printers require up to five toner cartridges, one each
for black, magenta, cyan, and yellow, plus an extra black toner car-
tridge just because.
Ink and Toner
119

Ink and toner tips
 Remember the cartridge or toner part number for your
printer! Not all ink or toner cartridges are alike; they’re not
interchangeable.
 I recommend buying the brand-name ink cartridges, despite
their extra cost.
 Keep spare toner or ink cartridges available. Whenever I buy a
new cartridge, I buy two. That way, when I run out, I don’t need
to rush to the store right away.
 Change the ink or toner when it gets low. Do not delay. Do it at
once. Failure to do so can damage your printer.
 When you first see the toner-low signal from your laser printer,
you can squeeze a few more pages from it (an exception to the
preceding rule). Remove the toner cartridge from the printer
and gently rock it back and forth to redistribute the ink powder.
Reinsert the cartridge into the printer. The next time the toner-
low signal appears, however, you must replace the toner; this
trick works only once.
 Yes, you can use those toner-recharging places, which is
cheaper than buying new toner from the manufacturer. Ditto for
ink refilling, but ensure that it’s quality stuff you’re getting.
 You don’t always have to print in color. You can save ink on an
inkjet printer by printing test images in grayscale rather than
full color all the time.
Paper
After ink, the second replaceable item you need in order to keep
your printer happy is paper. Printers eat paper. You need to be sure
that you buy your printer the proper types of paper to keep it
happy — and there are several types of paper you can use, and
many types to avoid.
Buying paper
The best kind of paper for your printer is sold with the printer type
right on the paper package. For example, inkjet printer paper says
“Inkjet printer paper” right on the package. Ditto for laser printer
paper, though for a laser printer any photocopier paper does just
as well.
Specialty papers abound for computer printers, from high-quality
ink paper that really absorbs inkjet printer ink to photo and glossy
photo paper to transparencies and even iron-on transfers. Always
ensure that the specialty paper works with your printer.
120
Part VIII: Printing

Adding paper to the printer
Computer printers accept paper in one of two ways: The paper is
either stacked up inside a tray, similar to a copy machine, or set in
a feeding bin.
When the printer runs out of paper, it lets you know, either via a
message on the computer screen or some message on the printer’s
control panel.
Yes, there’s a face-up and face-down way of inserting paper into a
printer. This distinction is important only when the paper manufac-
turer recommends that you print on one side of the paper first, or
when you’re printing on both sides of a sheet of paper. Directions
on the printer should tell you which side of the paper is printed
first. If not, feel free to borrow the icons in the following figure.
Paper tips
 Keep your printer supplies, including the paper, near your
printer for easy access.
 Buy plenty of paper for your printer! Stock up! Paper is cheaper
by the box. Try to find a discount, bulk-paper dealer near you.
 Be careful to note which side of the paper needs to be printed
on first — if that’s the case.
 Not all inkjet printer paper works in laser printers. For example,
if the photo paper says that it’s for a color laser printer, it prob-
ably works just fine. But, if the paper doesn’t say that it’s okay
for a color laser printer, it doesn’t work.
 Avoid using powdered or erasable bond paper in your com-
puter printer. The powder gums up the works.
 Paper stock that’s too thick may not be able to wend its way
through your printer’s internals. I generally stick with 25-pound
stock as the thickest paper to use in a computer printer.
 For the best printing on a laser printer, I recommend getting
laser paper.
 That continuous fanfold paper you may have seen in old
movies or photos is for older impact (dot-matrix) printers that
you will probably never use.
 Some printers are capable of handling larger-size paper, such as
legal or tabloid. If yours can use these sizes, make sure that you
load the paper properly and tell Windows or your software
application that you’re using a different size of paper.

Part VIII: Printing

The Printer’s Control Panel
The printer is really a computer all its own. Some printers have full-
on microprocessors and their own memory. Other printers —
cheap ones — use the computer for most of the computing horse-
power, but printers still remain complex and interesting gizmos. As
such, each printer has a control panel.
On some printers, the control panel is a small LCD screen with
buttons to scroll through various menus and select options.
Other printers may have just one or two buttons that control
everything — beyond the basic power button.
Here are a few key things to locate on the printer’s control panel:
 Power button and light.
 Paper-out light. This may also appear as a warning on the
printer’s LCD screen.
 Ink/toner out/low light. This message may also appear on the
LCD screen. There may be different lights for the different ink
cartridges.
 The on-line or select button. Some printers require that an on-
line or select button be pressed before the printer communi-
cates with the computer. This button isn’t used to turn the
printer off and on, but rather open or close communications
with the printer. For example, you deselect or take the printer
off-line to change ink cartridges or eject a page or fix a misfeed.
 Stop or Cancel. This button is used to immediately halt print-
ing. Consider yourself fortunate if your printer sports one of
these babies.
 The form-feed button. This button ejects a sheet of paper from
the printer.
Printing
In the computer world, printed material is called hard copy, and it’s
often the last step in creating something with the computer. The
hard copy is pass-around proof of your efforts, the paper you turn
in, a list to take shopping, sheet music for others to play, pictures
to look at — you name it. Getting it on paper is what the printer is
all about.
Printing
123

The Print command
Printing is the same in nearly every Windows application. Here are
the steps I recommend that you take to print your creation:
1. Save your stuff!
Always save before you print. It’s a good habit.
2. Turn on the printer (if necessary).
Or, take whatever steps to ensure that the printer is on-line
and ready to print.
3. Choose File➪Print.
The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+P.
4. Make any necessary adjustments in the Print dialog box.
The majority of these adjustments are covered in the remain-
der of this section.
5. Click the Print button to print the document.
6. Remove the document from the printer.
You can also print by clicking a Print toolbar button. Note that
the button often just prints the document immediately without
first displaying a Print dialog box.
Choosing a printer
When your computer is connected to multiple printers, such as
printers on a network, you select a printer inside the Print dialog
box. There, you see either a list of icons or a drop-down list of
printer descriptions.
When you don’t choose a printer, such as when you click the Print
toolbar button, Windows uses the default printer.
Selecting paper size
Paper size is sometimes chosen in the Print dialog box, but most
often a File➪Page Setup command is used to set the paper size
instead. The paper size is set by either selecting from a list of
preset sizes or manually entering a new size — depending on the
program being used.
Choosing new paper in the program also requires that you feed the
proper paper size into your printer. Some printers have a wide slot
available to accommodate just about any size of paper. Otherwise,
the paper must fit into a special tray, such as with a laser printer.
124
Part VIII: Printing

Remember to load the printer with the proper size of paper before
you print!
Printing in color or grayscale
One way to save on color ink is to print test documents using
grayscale, or shades of gray (black ink), rather than color. This set-
ting is made in different places, depending on the printer.
Depending on your printer setup or the application you’re using,
you may have to summon the Print dialog box and click an
Advanced, Effects, or Properties button. Then, you must hunt
through the various dialog boxes for a Grayscale command or
option that sets the output to use black ink only.
For example, you may have to click the Properties button in the
Print dialog box to display the Printer’s Properties dialog box.
Then, click a Color tab. Then, put a check mark by the Use
Grayscale option. Click OK to set up the printer, and then click the
Print button to print.
The grayscale setting typically works only once; you have to make
that setting or change it again to print the next document in
grayscale as well.
Printing one page from many
Some Print dialog boxes allow you to specify which pages of a doc-
ument to print. There may be buttons to select all odd pages, all
even pages, or the entire document. Or, there may be a text box
where you can enter individual pages or a range of pages.
To print an individual page, simply specify that page in the text box:
5
To print a range of pages, use the hyphen to separate the first and
last pages in the range:
2-10
To print a smattering of pages, separate them with commas:
5, 13-15, 19, 23-30
Printing sideways
The official lingo involved with printing sideways is landscape
mode. Normally, printing is done in portrait mode, where the paper
is short on top and long on the sides. Landscape mode is where the
printing goes longways on a page.
Printing
125

The option to set Portrait or Landscape is usually found in the
Page Setup dialog box, not in the Print dialog box. To make that
setting, choose File➪Page Setup. Sometimes, the command is in the
main part of the dialog box, or you may have to click a Layout or
Paper tab.
It’s best to choose Landscape mode before you start creating your
document because other commands — margins, graphics size, and
position — are affected by this change.
Note that printing sideways is done by the printer’s software. You
don’t need to load the paper sideways for it to work.
Print Preview
To help save paper, and to give you a good idea of what the printed
document will look like, most applications come with a Print
Preview command. This command simply shows you onscreen
exactly what the printed document looks like, all the way up to the
edge of the paper.
The Print Preview command is commonly found on the File
menu. A Print Preview toolbar button can also be used.
Most applications don’t let you edit text or modify your document
in Print Preview mode. You must first close the Print Preview
window or somehow return to editing mode to continue working
on the document.
Printing the Screen
It’s possible to get a printed copy of what you see on the screen, or
of a single window. This trick is complicated, but it can be done.
Pay close attention:
1. Arrange the screen so that it looks the way you want to see it
printed, or ensure that the single window you want to capture
is “on top of” all other windows.
2. Press the Print Screen key to capture the entire screen, or
press Alt+Print Screen to capture just a window.
The image is now copied into the Windows Clipboard. From
there, you can paste it into any program that accepts graphics.
3. From the Start button’s menu, choose All Programs➪
Accessories➪Paint to start the Windows Paint program.
126
Part VIII: Printing

4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The screen image is now pasted into the Paint program, from
which you can print.
You can optionally save the image at this point, if necessary.
5. Choose File➪Print.
Make necessary adjustments in the Print dialog box, and
ensure that the printer is ready to print.
6. Click the Print button to print the screen.
7. Quit Paint when you’re done.
Printing a Test Page
One way to ensure that the printer is working and on speaking
terms with the computer is to print a test page. This is done ini-
tially when you set up any printer for the first time, but Windows
lets you print a test page again, just to ensure that everything is
working:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes window.
This window can be found by opening the Printers and Faxes
icon in the Control Panel.
2. Right-click the printer’s icon.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. Click the button labeled Print Test Page.
Stopping the Printer
In those moments when your patience flits away, or when some-
thing trots off to the printer before its time, you need to stop print-
ing, by canceling the printing jobs before paper spews all over the
place.
The easiest way to stop printing is to locate a Cancel or Stop
button on the printer’s control panel. That generally stops the
printing, by canceling the current page and halting any further
information from coming into the printer.
If your printer lacks a Cancel or Stop button, or if you’re printing a
large document and you want to ensure that it’s fully purged from
memory, take these steps:
Stopping the Printer
127

1. Locate the tiny printer icon in the system tray.
If you can see this guy, great. Otherwise, you have to open the
Printers and Faxes window and locate your printer’s icon.
2. Open the printer icon.
The printer’s queue dialog box is displayed and lists the docu-
ment that’s currently printing plus any documents waiting to
be printed.
3. Choose Printer➪Cancel All Documents.
This step stops everything. That’s probably what you want. Fix
the problem, and then print again.
Turning the Printer On and Off
Like other computer peripherals, printers have an on–off switch.
Unlike the console, it’s a real on–off switch, not a power button;
clicking the off button really does turn the printer off, and right
away.
Most modern printers can be left on all the time. The printers have
a special sleep, or standby, mode, just like computers do. After a
while, printers enter this mode, where they use little or no power
and essentially turn themselves off. When the signal comes in to
start printing, the printer automatically wakes itself up and prints.
Then, it goes back to sleep after a period of inactivity.
You can turn your printer off, if you like. Just flip the switch. But,
remember to turn the printer on again before printing.
Types of Printers
All printers serve the job of giving you a hard copy. Specifically,
two popular types of computer printers are available on the
market: inkjet printers and laser printers.
You can still find the old dot-matrix, or impact, printers. They’re
used for high-speed operations, such as printing invoices or filling
in forms. Individual computer users don’t need them, mostly
because they’re very slow when printing graphics and everything
in Windows is graphics.
Inkjet printers
The inkjet printer uses literally a jet of ink to create an image on
paper. A tiny ink ball is lobbed from the inkjet nozzle directly onto
the paper. The ball is small enough that it’s nearly instantly
128
Part VIII: Printing

absorbed by the paper (though better paper absorbs the ink more
efficiently).
Inkjet printers take advantage of several different inks, up to six in
a single printer. The more ink, the more realistic the images. For
example, special color-photo ink printers use up to six ink colors to
create near-photographic-like quality in their output.
The chief advantage of inkjet printers is that they’re relatively inex-
pensive and they generate cheap color output.
The main disadvantage of inkjet printers is that the replacement
cost of the ink cartridges is not cheap. In fact, it’s often said that
manufacturers give away the printer and make up the cost by sell-
ing you ink.
Laser printers
The technology behind the laser printer is the same as is found in a
photocopier. But, rather than create an image by reflecting light off
an original, a laser beam etches the printed image on a magnetic
drum, which then sucks up toner dust and literally fuses the toner
dust to the paper to create an image.
Laser printers are generally more expensive than inkjet printers,
but then again, they’re the workhorses of the modern computer-
ized office. They’re faster than inkjet printers, and the quality is
higher.
Though color laser printers are available, the quality and cost of
ink printers make them more attractive for individuals.
Uninstalling a Printer
Removing a printer from your computer system involves both
hardware and software duties.
On the hardware side, simply disconnect the printer from the con-
sole; unplug the printer or USB cable.
On the software side, open the Printers and Faxes window. Select
your printer’s icon, and then choose File➪Delete from the menu. If
you’re prompted, I recommend that you leave the printer’s soft-
ware installed on your computer. That way, if you need to use the
printer later, you don’t have to reinstall the software.
You cannot remove a network printer. For that printer to be
removed, it must be uninstalled on the computer to which it’s con-
nected, or it must be disconnected from the network.

Networking
N
etworking was once a complex and detailed thing, found exclu-
sively in large businesses or universities and under the control
of immortal computer experts and other high deities. That same
complex and detailed networking is now available for computers in
your own home or small office. Nothing much has changed, other
than a lack of immediate access to the networking deities. Yep:
Networking is possible, and very useful, but taming the network is
now a job done by mere mortals. The information in this part
should help.

About Networking
Networking allows multiple computers to share resources, such as
files, printers, and modems. If you have more than one computer,
you can network them. That way, you can share information
between them, share a single printer, or share a high-speed Internet
connection.
Like everything else in a computer, networking is accomplished by
a combination of hardware and software.
Networking hardware requires a NIC, or network information card,
which is an Ethernet hardware adapter. This item comes either as
an expansion card or as part of the motherboard. Most new PCs,
and all laptops, come with networking hardware.
Windows provides all the networking software you need. (You 
may need a specific software driver for the NIC, but beyond that,
Windows does just about everything.)
Accessing Another Computer
Windows XP is good about listing all of a computer’s shared
resources on the network. You find shared folders in the My
Network Places window and shared printers in any Printer dialog
box. Yet, if you still want to access another computer on the net-
work directly, or just see a list of all computers in your workgroup,
follow these steps:
1. Open the My Network Places icon on the desktop to display
the My Network Places window.
2. From the Network Tasks pane (on the left), click the item
labeled View Workgroup Computers.
3. Double-click a computer’s icon to view any shared resources
on that computer.
Not every computer on the network is sharing resources.
Linux and Mac computers on the network must be configured prop-
erly before you can access those systems from your PC.
Only computers in your workgroup are shown in the window. To
see other workgroups, and view computers belonging to those
workgroups, click the Up button or press the Backspace key on
your keyboard.
132
Part IX: Networking

Accessing a Shared Folder
Shared folders are listed in the My Network Places window.
Windows XP automatically searches for any folder on any other
Windows computer that is “up for grabs.” That folder is then listed
in the My Network Places window in the Local Network area.
To view the My Network Places window, open the My Network
Places icon on the desktop. This window’s contents can also be
accessed from any folder list or Address bar drop-down list.
There’s a shortcut to the My Network Places window in every
Save As or Open dialog box. Click the My Network Places button
on the left side of the window.
Shared folder icons appear with “plumbing” beneath them. The
folder name also tells you on which computer the folder is located.
In this figure, the folder named prog is being shared on the net-
working computer named Test Monster. The computer’s network
name is Vishnu.
Adding a Shared Folder to Your Disk System
For convenience, Windows lets you access, or map, a shared folder
from another computer to a disk drive letter on your own com-
puter system. That makes accessing the folder work just like
accessing another disk drive on your computer. Windows even
remembers mapped folders and reassigns them when you restart
your computer.
Mapping a folder to a disk drive
To add a shared folder on the network to your PC’s disk drive
system, follow these steps:
1. Open any Windows Explorer window, such as the My Network
Places window.
2. Choose Tools➪Map Network Drive.
The Map Network Drive dialog box appears.
Adding a Shared Folder to Your Disk System
133

3. Choose a drive letter from the Drive drop-down list.
Try to make the letter memorable, such as Drive R for an
archive folder, or drive P for shared photos.
4. Click the Browse button to locate a shared folder on the 
network.
The folders appear on the scrolling list, near the bottom. You
can choose those folders specifically or choose any subfolder
inside a shared folder.
5. Select a folder and click the OK button.
The folder’s officially cryptic network name appears in the
Folder box.
6. Click to put a check mark by the box labeled Reconnect at
Logon.
7. Click the Finish button to add the folder as a mapped disk
drive.
The shared folder or disk drive window then appears. (You can
close it.)
The mapped drive also appears in the My Computer window.
Some firewalls disable access to folders shared on the local net-
work. If you’re using a firewall, be sure to allow access through the
firewall (both in and out) from computers on your network.
Unmapping a folder
When you tire of having the convenience of a network drive, you
can unmap it. It’s cinchy:
1. Open the Windows Explorer window or any folder window.
2. Choose Tools➪Disconnect Network Drive.
3. Select the icon of the mapped drive you want to disconnect.
4. Click OK.
You may be warned if the connection is still active. If so, stop
using the mapped drive, and then try again.
Checking the Network Connection
There are several ways you can confirm that your PC is actively
connected to the network and things are set up properly.
134
Part IX: Networking

Checking the My Network Places window
Opening the My Network Places icon displays a list of shared
resources that are accessible over the network. If you open that
icon and the window is empty, it means either that networking isn’t
working or that there just aren’t any resources to be shared.
Checking the Network Connections window
The Network Connections window displays a list of networking
hardware available to your computer. See also “The Network
Connections Window.”
In the Network Connections window, locate the icon represent-
ing the local-area connection. Open that icon to display a dialog
box listing the status of the connection. The Status should read
“Connected,” and the Activity area of the dialog box should list a
goodly amount of bytes both sent and received.
You can also click the Support tab to ensure that a valid IP address
has been issued. (A valid IP address consists of some numbers
other than all zeroes.) Note that a Repair button is located on the
Support tab, to help troubleshoot the network connection.
Using the little networking guys
When your PC is actively connected to a network, the little 
networking-guys icon appears in the system tray, to tell you that
the networking is happening.
Double-clicking the networking guys displays the network status
dialog box, which can also be displayed from the Network
Connections window, as covered in the preceding subsection.
Displaying the little networking guys
To ensure that the little networking guys appear in the system tray,
follow these steps:
1. Click to select the Local Area Connection icon in the Network
Connections window.
See also “The Network Connections Window.”
2. Choose File➪Properties to display the connection’s Properties
dialog box.
3. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Show Icon in
Notification Area When Connected.
4. Click OK.
Checking the Network Connection
135

Connecting to the Network
The only good news about connecting to a computer network is
that after you get it right, you never really have to do it again. It’s
getting to that point that causes the most frustration among PC
users.
The NIC
On the hardware side of connecting the network, your PC needs a
NIC, or network interface card. This item is an adapter that plugs
into one of the expansion slots on your PC, or the hardware can be
included on the motherboard. Either way, the result is an RJ-45
jack, or network hole, on the console’s rump.
You may also need to install software for your NIC. This isn’t net-
working software, but rather a software driver that controls the NIC
and interfaces it with the rest of your PC’s hardware.
The network cable
Physically connecting the network is networking cable, also known
as Cat-5 cable. This cable connects each computer on the network
to a central router, switch, or networking hub.
The ends of the cable are RJ-45 jacks, one of which plugs into the
NIC on your PC and the other of which plugs into the router,
switch, or hub.
You can also network two PCs directly, by connecting a network
cable between each computer’s NIC.
Configuring the network
After making the hardware connection, your next step is to prop-
erly configure Windows to understand and obey the network. This
is best done by running the Network Setup Wizard:
1. Open the My Network Places icon on the desktop to display
the My Network Places window.
2. From the left side of the window, choose the task labeled Set
Up a Home or Small Office Network.
3. Answer the questions given by the Network Setup Wizard, and
click the Next button after each choice.
4. Click the Finish button when the wizard is done.
136
Part IX: Networking

Connecting to a Wireless Network
Wireless networking is all the rage. As long as your PC is equipped
with a wireless networking adapter and a broadcast networking
signal is available, you too can do the networking thing without
wires.
The best way to connect to a wireless network is to have your net-
working manager set things up for you. This strategy is ideal for sit-
uations in which your computer is permanently located. For
cybercafés or airports or other locations you may visit, use the
instructions in this part of the book.
The networks are out there! To find them, do this:
1. Open the Network Connections icon in the Control Panel to
display the Network Connections window.
2. Right-click the Wireless Network Connection icon.
3. Choose View Available Wireless Networks.
4. Click to select a name, or SSID, from the list of available wire-
less networks.
5. Enter the WEP, or wireless network’s password, in the Network
Key box.
The password must be typed exactly! Upper- and lowercase are
different! Note that some passwords can be quite long.
6. Retype the same password into the Confirm Network Key box.
7. Click the Connect button.
If the connection is made, a pop-up bubble appears and informs
you of the wireless networking status, speed, and other stuff.
Not every network has a password, but I highly recommend using
only those networks that are password protected. When you use a
non-password-protected network, Windows complains often and
occasionally disconnects you from the network, just to spite you.
Getting Your PC’s IP Address
Every computer on the network has its own, unique network ID
number, known as an IP address. IP stands for Internet Protocol, the
same rules and directions for connecting computers on the
Internet. It’s pronounced “I pee” as in “I am urinating.”
Getting Your PC’s IP Address
137

You may be asked to report your PC’s IP address for troubleshoot-
ing purposes or to tech support. When asked, here’s how you can
report that information:
1. Display the networking status dialog box by double-clicking
the networking guys in the system tray or by opening the con-
nection’s icon in the Network Connections window.
2. Click the Support tab in the dialog box.
The IP address is listed, along with the cryptic values of the
subnet mask and default gateway — which should be more
than enough for tech support to chew on.
3. More detailed (and scary) information can be obtained by
clicking the Details button.
Most networks assign IP addresses to all the computers on the net-
work. This is done by using a networking program named DHCP. If
your network uses a router or one computer is using Internet
Connection Sharing, it provides the IP addresses to all other com-
puters on the network by using DHCP. If not, IP addresses must be
manually assigned.
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, if that
makes you feel any better.
Most IP addresses for the local network start with either 10.0.x.x or
192.168.x.x.
Getting Your PC’s MAC Address
The MAC address is a unique number given to your PC’s Ethernet
hardware. It’s different from the IP address in that the MAC address
is encoded in hardware and cannot be changed. Many wireless net-
works use the MAC address as a form of security; no two MAC
addresses are identical and it’s difficult to fake a MAC address.
To discover your PC’s MAC address, follow the steps in the preced-
ing section and click the Details button in Step 3. The MAC address
appears as the first item on the list, labeled Physical Address.
If your PC has more than one NIC, each one has its own, distinct
MAC address.
MAC stands for Medial Access Control. Say “mack,” not the letters.
138
Part IX: Networking

The My Network Places Window
My Network Places is the name of an icon and a window in
Windows where shared resources on the network are all listed.
To open the window, double-click the My Network Places icon
on the desktop. You may also find a link to this folder on the
Start button’s menu.
Any folder available for sharing elsewhere on the network
appears in the My Network Places window.
The task pane (on the left) of the My Network Places window lists
common networking tasks as well as links to other networking loca-
tions on your computer.
In previous versions of Windows, My Network Places was named
Network Neighborhood.
The Network Connections Window
Windows keeps your networking hardware, as well as various net-
work connections that are made, in one location, known as the
Network Connections window.
This window can be handy to get to if a link to it appears on the
Start button’s menu. Otherwise, you get there from the Control
Panel’s Network Connections icon.
The Network Connections window lists the available networking
hardware as well as other connections, split up into different areas,
similar to how the My Computer window lists storage devices in
categories. The task pane on the left side of the window also con-
tains handy links for adding new network hardware, software, and
other networking options.
The PC’s Network Name
All PCs connected to the network make themselves known in vari-
ous ways:
 The computer’s IP address
 The networking hardware’s MAC address
 The computer’s networking name
 The computer’s description
 Any shared resources on the computer
The PC’s Network Name
139

The computer’s networking name is used by Windows to name the
computer system as well. So, if Windows knows your computer as
Daisy, it also appears on the network as Daisy. This nonsense,
along with the computer’s description, is changed in the System
Properties dialog box:
1. Open the System icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click the Computer Name tab.
3. The text description of your computer is entered in the box
labeled Computer Description.
This text is optional, but the description appears in the My
Network Places window.
4. To change the computer’s name, click the Change button.
5. Type the name in the Computer Name text box.
Try to keep the name to fewer than 15 characters, with no
spaces. No two computers on the network can share the same
name.
6. Click OK to set the new computer name.
The name appears in the My Network Places window by any
shared folders. It also becomes the root name of the computer
in a network pathname.
7. Click OK to close the System Properties dialog box and accept
your changes.
Restart Windows if you’re prompted to do so.
The My Network Places window lists shared resources on other
computers by using this format:
shared resource name on Computer description 
(Computer name)
You also see network paths beginning with two backslashes, fol-
lowed by the computer name and then the path of the shared
resource.
Sharing a Folder
To make a folder on your computer available to other computers
on the network, heed these steps:
1. Click to select the folder.
That folder and its contents — including any and all subfolders
and their contents — are shared on the network.
140
Part IX: Networking

2. Choose File➪Sharing and Security.
3. In the folder’s Properties dialog box, click to put a check mark
by the option labeled Share This Folder on the Network.
You cannot select this item if the folder is private or one of its
parent folders is private.
4. Optionally, enter a Share name.
This is the folder’s name as it appears to others on the net-
work. By specifying a share name, you can apply a more
descriptive name to the folder and its contents than the name
given the folder on your PC.
5. Optionally, click to put a check mark by the item labeled Allow
Network Users to Change My Files.
If you check this item, others on the network can delete,
modify, or add to any files inside the shared folder or any of its
subfolders.
6. Click the OK button to share the folder.
I don’t recommend that you share the root folder of any hard drive;
likewise, don’t share any of Windows own folders or folders con-
taining programs you have installed on your computer. Such a
thing proves to be a major security risk. (Windows warns you
when you try.)
Shared folders appear with the “serving hand” icon beneath
them.
No, you cannot share individual files, only the folders that contain
the files. Likewise, compressed folders — which are really only
files — cannot be shared individually.
Sharing an Internet Connection
There’s no reason that only one computer in your house should
have the high-speed Internet connection. That’s just rude! Instead,
that single computer can use Windows to share the Internet con-
nection with other computers on the network.
Ideally, what you want is to have the high-speed modem connect to
a router, which then connects the rest of the computers on your
network. This situation is the best and avoids having to deal with
sharing an Internet connection. But, if you’re stubborn, you can do
this instead:
1. Open the Network Connections icon in the Control Panel to
display the Network Connections window.
Sharing an Internet Connection
141

2. Click to select the high-speed Internet connection.
Or, you can select a modem or an ISP’s icon from the list.
3. Choose File➪Properties.
4. Click the Advanced tab in the connection’s Properties dialog
box.
5. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Allow Other
Network Users to Connect Through This Computer’s Internet
Connection.
6. Click OK.
Other computers can now find the Internet connection available in
their Network Connections window.
To unshare the connection, repeat these steps, but remove the
check mark in Step 5.
Sharing a Printer
To make your printer available for use by others on the network,
follow these steps:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click to select the printer attached to your computer that you
want to share.
3. Choose File➪Sharing.
4. In the printer’s Properties dialog box, click to select the option
labeled Share This Printer.
5. Optionally, give the printer a name.
I recommend naming the printer after the type of printer or its
location, such as Color Laser in the Den or Photo Printer in
Production.
6. Click OK.
Printers you’re sharing appear with the serving-hand icon
beneath their icon, just like shared folders on your computer.
Unsharing a Folder
Folders remain up for grabs as long as you want, or until you elect
to unshare them. This is cinchy:
1. Click to select the shared folder.
142
Part IX: Networking

2. Choose File➪Sharing and Security.
3. In the folder’s Properties dialog box, click to remove the check
mark by the option labeled Share This Folder on the Network.
4. Click OK.
If someone else on the network is using the folder, you’re warned
about breaking the connection.
Unsharing a Printer
To keep that printer all for yourself — indeed, to hide its usefulness
from the rest of the dweebs on the network — do this:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes icon in the Control Panel to dis-
play the Printers and Faxes window.
2. Click to select the shared printer.
3. Choose File➪Sharing.
4. Click to select the option labeled Do Not Share This Printer.
5. Click OK.
Using a Network Printer
See Part VIII for more information about printing over the network.
Workgroups
The simplest type of network is the peer-to-peer network. In this
setup, the network lacks a central powerful computer, such as a file
server. Instead, each computer can access any other computer on
the network directly. To help keep the network organized, it can
further be broken up into smaller units, called workgroups.
A workgroup is nothing more than a collection of computers on the
network. By isolating larger networks into workgroups, it makes
accessing other computers with similar needs and resources
easier. But, on a small office or home office system, workgroups are
still necessary, even though the system doesn’t have that many
computers.
Your computer must belong to a workgroup so that you can easily
access other computers in the workgroup. For a small office or
home office, I recommend that all computers belong to the same
workgroup.
Workgroups
143

Only resources from the workgroup appear in the My Network
Places window.
Creating and joining a workgroup
To join a workgroup, you simply specify its name:
1. Open the System icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click the Computer Name tab in the System dialog box.
3. Click the Change button to display the Computer Name
Changes dialog box.
4. In the Member Of area, choose the option labeled Workgroup.
5. Type the name of the workgroup.
Either enter the name of an existing workgroup or create a
new name for your workgroup here. For example, my comput-
ers are on a workgroup named CAT. All the computers specify
CAT as the workgroup name; therefore, they all belong to that
workgroup.
The workgroup name should be short, with no spaces.
6. Click OK to close the Computer Name Changes dialog box.
7. Click OK to dismiss the System Properties dialog box.
Restart Windows if you’re prompted to do so.
Viewing the workgroup computers
To view all computers belonging to the workgroup, open the My
Network Places window. Then, choose the task (on the left side of
the window) labeled View Workgroup Computers.
When a computer is turned off, disconnected from the network, or
not a member of the workgroup, it doesn’t show up in the window.
When the workgroup window is empty, it means that your com-
puter is the only member of its workgroup. Otherwise, you have
misspelled the workgroup name or have some other network
problem.
If you click the Up arrow when you’re viewing the workgroup,
you display another window, which lists all workgroups on the
network. Click the Up arrow again, and you see any networks
available to your computer displayed in the window.

Creating Your 
Own CDs
I
t has been a tradition that folks want to both read from and
write to their removable computer media. Blame it on the floppy
disk. So, when CDs first started holding computer data, folks won-
dered why they couldn’t write data to the disk. Alas, it was a
CD-ROM, where the RO means Read-Only. Writing to a CD just
wasn’t happening. That was more than ten years ago.
Many PCs are now blessed with a CD drive that both reads from
and writes to CDs. By using such a drive, you can create your own
data or music CD. Windows comes with all the software you need.
You just buy the right kind of discs, and soon you’ll be a CD-
burning fool.
(Many PCs also come with DVD drives that can read and write
information to DVD discs. This book doesn’t cover that topic
because the software required in order to record on a DVD is
unique to the drive. When Windows itself has the ability to write
to a DVD disc, this book will be updated to cover writing to DVD
discs as well as to CDs.)

CD Types
There are two types of CDs on which you can record information:
 CD-R, or CD recordable
 CD-RW, or CD rewriteable
Be careful to note that some CD drives record only CD-Rs. Even so,
most modern PCs have CD-R drives that can record on both types
of discs, CD-R and CD-RW.
Like a CD, both disc formats can store from 640MB to 720MB of
information, depending on the disc.
The CD-R
You can write information only once to a CD-R disc. After the disc is
full, it cannot be written to again, although it can be read from.
Nearly all computers recognize the CD-R format and can read from
that type of disc, even if the drive is a standard (not recording) CD.
Data is burned to the CD-R before the disc is ejected. But, in
Windows, that doesn’t mean that you’re done with the disc. You
can reinsert the disc and continue to add information until it’s full.
Information can be written to the CD-R in short spurts or in one
long burst.
There are specialized CD-R discs for data and for music. Be sure
that you buy the proper type! Buying the discs in bulk (on a spool)
is the least expensive way to go.
The CD-RW
CD-RW discs work exactly like CD-R discs. The main difference is
that you can completely erase the disc and use it all over again, as
though it were new or empty.
Note that CD-RW discs don’t allow you to delete information from
the disc in small chunks or individually. Instead, the whole disc
must be erased at one time. Aside from that, the CD-RW works
exactly like a CD-R disc.
CD-RW discs aren’t well-suited for recording music. Not all audio
CD players are compatible with the CD-RW format.
Finally, CD-RW discs are more expensive than CD-Rs, which makes
their usefulness questionable. After all, it’s cheaper to buy a few
CD-Rs and use them than to keep reusing a CD-RW.
146
Part X: Creating Your Own CDs

Checking to See Whether You 
Have a CD-R/RW Drive
Examining your PC’s CD drive solves the mystery of whether you
can create your own CDs. The drive itself says “Recordable,” plus
maybe “Rewriteable,” right on the front.
Some customized computers may not have CD drives with text on
them. In that case, you can check the My Computer window to see
whether the drive is listed as a CD-R or CD-RW.
Finally, you can check the CD drive’s Properties dialog box for a
Recording tab. See also “Enabling a CD-R/RW Drive.”
Creating a Musical CD
You can use the Windows Media Player program to create musical
CDs. The music can come from the Internet or from other CDs you
own. The Media Player program lets you build collections of music
in playlists. You can then burn the playlists to CDs for playback in
any CD player.
Other programs exist that let you burn music CDs, but the Windows
Media Player comes standard with Windows. The following sections
are specific to Windows Media Player; other programs use similar
steps, so you can follow along here if you’re using one of the many
CD-music-creation programs.
Building a playlist
The first step to create a musical CD is to build a playlist, or a col-
lection of songs grouped together so that they can all be written to
a single CD. These steps are for the Windows Media Player; the
steps in other media programs should be similar:
1. Press Ctrl+N to create a new playlist.
2. Type a name for the new playlist.
3. Click OK.
4. Select your playlist beneath the My Playlists heading, on the
left side of the Media Player window.
You may need to click the + (plus sign) by the My Playlists
heading to display all your playlists.
5. Choose All Music from the left side of the Media Player
window.
Creating a Musical CD 147

6. Drag songs from the right side of the window to your playlist
on the left side.
Repeat Step 6 as you build the playlist.
Remember that there’s a size limit on how much music fits on a CD.
Depending on the CD, it can be 70 minutes or more. Every so often,
select all the songs in your playlist and look at the Total Time
value, near the bottom of the window.
Burning a playlist
The Windows Media Player creates music CDs by burning a playlist
to the CD. You must first create a playlist, or a collection of music,
and then insert a blank CD-R — preferably one specially created for
holding music, into the CD drive. Then, follow these steps in Media
Player after inserting the disc:
1. Click the button on the left labeled Copy to CD or Device.
2. Choose your playlist from the drop-down menu atop the left
side of the window.
The playlist menu button is located beneath the text Items to
Copy.
3. Click the Copy button in the upper-right part of the window.
The songs are converted in the proper format for a music CD
and then burned to the CD-R. The time taken depends on the
speed of the CD-R drive.
After the last song is written, Windows closes the disc, which
means that no more files or music can be written to it. The disc,
however, can be played in any CD player or computer CD drive.
Destroying a CD
CD-Rs can be thrown away, but that means not only that anyone
can still read the data, but that there may also be rules in your
community about disposing of CDs.
CDs can be considered as hazardous waste because when they
burn, they emit noxious fumes. Don’t burn your CDs to destroy
them!
If you really want to properly dispose of a CD or CD-R disc, obtain a
CD shredder. It works like a paper shredder — and may indeed
double as a paper shredder — effectively rendering CDs into small
enough bits that only the most diehard spy would be willing to
reassemble the thing.
148
Part X: Creating Your Own CDs

Enabling a CD-R/RW Drive
You need to tell Windows that the CD-R drive is available and ready
for recording CDs. This is done in the drive’s Properties dialog box:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop, to display the My
Computer window.
2. Select your PC’s CD-R drive.
CD-R drives sport no special icon and look just like regular CD
drives in the My Computer window.
3. Choose File➪Properties from the menu.
4. In the drive’s Properties dialog box, click the Recording tab.
Having no Recording tab means that your PC doesn’t have a
CD-R drive. Or, your drive manufacturer may have its own tab
specific to recording on that one drive.
5. Click to put a check mark by the option labeled Enable CD
Recording on This Drive.
6. Click OK.
Optionally, close the My Computer window as well.
Erasing a CD-RW
The only advantage of a CD-RW over a CD-R is that you have the
option of completely erasing the disc and starting over. Yes, erasing
the disc utterly deletes any files, folders, programs, and whatnot on
that disc. But you get to start over again, with a fresh, blank CD-RW,
which is the selling point.
To utterly zap a CD-RW, open the disc’s window; use the My
Computer window to locate the CD drive icon, and open that icon
to display the window.
To erase the disc, choose File➪Erase This CD-RW. This action runs
a wizard; click the Next button. That’s it.
Windows keeps the disc in the drive, and presents the disc’s folder
window again, ready for new files to be added.
Erasing a CD-RW
149

Importing Music
In Windows, the Media Player program can be used to read a musi-
cal CD. The music can be played, but it can also be imported into
the computer, for storage or for later burning to create a custom
CD. (Other programs can be used as well, but Media Player is
included with Windows.)
The easiest way to import music is to simply stick a musical CD
into the computer’s CD drive. If the Autoplay window appears,
choose the option that reads Copy Music from CD. That automati-
cally imports all the songs from all the tracks on the CD into
Windows Media Player.
When the Autoplay option isn’t working, you can do this:
1. Insert the music CD into the computer’s CD drive.
It can be a CD or CD-R drive or even a DVD drive.
2. Start the Windows Media Player program.
Its icon dwells on the desktop, Quick Launch bar, or 
Start menu, or it can be found by choosing All Programs➪
Accessories➪Entertainment➪Windows Media Player.
3. Click the item labeled Copy from CD.
It’s on the left side of the Media Player window. Or, if you can
see the menu, choose File➪Copy➪Copy from Audio CD and
then choose the name of the CD from the submenu.
4. Click the Copy Music button, located at the top of the Media
Player window.
The music is copied one track at a time, and the speed
depends on the speed of the CD drive.
The songs that are copied are stored in the Media Player Media
Library. Click the Media Library link or choose View➪Go To➪Media
Library from the menu to see the imported songs as well as all
other media stored and managed by Windows Media Player.
Using a CD-R/RW in Windows
Windows is keenly aware of and understands CD-R and CD-RW
discs. If you have the right hardware, Windows lets you add files to
those discs in a simple, straightforward manner. Generally, the
steps go like this:
150
Part X: Creating Your Own CDs

 Insert the CD-R or CD-RW into the drive.
 Direct Windows to open the CD as a writeable folder.
 Copy files to the writeable folder.
 Burn and eject the CD-R or CD-RW.
Windows uses a special writeable folder to which you can copy —
and delete — files. The files sit there until they’re written to the 
CD-R in one blast. That saves on CD disc space.
Mounting a CD-R or CD-RW
To begin using the CD-R/RW, stick the disc into the drive. Windows
recognizes it and asks what to do. Choose the option labeled Open
Writeable CD Folder Using Windows Explorer, and click OK. A
window for the CD-R/RW disc’s drive appears on the screen. The
drive is ready for writing.
If Windows doesn’t recognize the disc or an error occurs, toss the
CD-R/RW out. Bum discs happen. There’s nothing you can do, other
than throw the turkey away.
Using a writeable folder
Files aren’t written directly to the CD-R/RW. Instead, Windows 
uses a preparatory window where files sit and wait. That window
appears just after you mount the CD-R/RW disc. It also shows up
when you open the CD’s icon in the My Computer window.
To copy a file to the CD-R, it must first be copied to the writeable
folder. Do this as you would copy any file from another drive:
Choose Edit➪Copy, Edit➪Copy to Folder, drag and drop, or any of
the file actions covered in Part VI of this book.
There’s also a link labeled Copy to CD, which can be found in the
task pane of any folder window. You can use that link to copy any
selected files to the CD’s writeable folder.
Put only copies on the CD-R/RW! Don’t use the Save As command
to save original work there. Use the CD-R/RW disc for archiving or
keeping only copies. You want to use the hard drive for your origi-
nals; that’s what it’s there for.
Files sitting in the writeable folder haven’t yet been written to the
CD-R/RW. To show that they’re waiting, those files appear with a
tiny download arrow on their ghosty icon.
Using a CD-R/RW in Windows
151

If the icon doesn’t have the download arrow, the file already has
been written to the CD.
Burning a CD-R/RW
To burn files to the CD, open the CD’s writeable folder and choose
File➪Write These Files to CD. This action displays the CD Writing
Wizard:
1. Type a name for the CD.
2. Click the Next button.
Watch as the progress meter keeps you from being bored out
of your skull.
The disc is automatically ejected when the writing is complete. It
can now be read by any computer with a CD drive.
If there’s an error, eject the disc, toss it out, and try with another
disc per the directions on the screen.
Writing to a CD-R/RW a Second 
(Or Third) Time
You can continue to write to a CD-R or CD-RW until the disc is full.
When Windows ejects the disc, it’s readable by other computers,
although the disc itself has not been “closed” and isn’t protected
from being written to again. (This may not hold true for other,
third-party CD-writing programs.)
To continue writing to a partially written CD-R disc, just stick that
disc back into your CD-R drive. Open the drive’s window and you
see any files already burned to the disc. To add new files, copy
them on over.
New files added to the disc appear with the download graphic on
their icon. They’re sitting in the writeable folder and awaiting burn-
ing to the CD. See also “Using a writeable folder.”
You can continue to write files to a CD-R or CD-RW until the disc
is full.
To get the most from your CD-R, try to write to it all at once.
Writing to the disc in small spurts wastes disc space.

The Keyboard
H
ey, that’s key-board, not key-bored! How can a computer key-
board be anything but boring, especially with all those but-
tons? Your PC uses a keyboard as its primary input device. In a
way, the keyboard is like the computer’s ears. So, forget shouting
at your computer — use the keyboard instead!

Part XI

Accessing Menus with the Keyboard
You can do many things with the keyboard that you can also do
with the mouse. Specifically, some folks are keyboard nuts when it
comes to accessing menu commands. Although the mouse may
seem obvious, those folks argue that the keyboard method is much
faster.
To use the keyboard to access menus in Windows, you start by
pressing the Alt key. This key displays underlines in the menu
names (if they aren’t there already). The underlines indicate which
keys on the keyboard activate those menu items. From that point
onward, it’s a matter of pressing the proper keys to match the
menu commands.
For example, to access the File➪Page Setup command in Microsoft
Word, you press Alt, F, U. That’s Alt to activate the underlines, F for
File, and U for Page Setup.
Some manuals and documentation even underline the commands
for you to help identify the keys: File➪Page Setup.
The first step can also be combined: Alt+F, U. In this case, Alt+F
immediately accesses the File menu.
Press the Esc key to cancel and back out of the menus.
The Any Key
The Any key is more of a relic from the computer’s text-based past.
Oftentimes, a program would prompt you (in what the programmer
believed to be a friendly manner) to “Press any key to continue.”
The idea was to give you a choice: Press any old key on the key-
board, just like a rap on the door to know that things are okay.
Sadly, many beginners would scour the keyboard in futile frustra-
tion for a single key labeled Any. There is no such key.
Today, such a message is often more precise: “Press the Enter key
to continue.” The Enter key is the Any key. (Well, and so is the
spacebar.)
Controlling a Window with the Keyboard
The keyboard can be used to manipulate windows on the desktop,
though, unlike accessing menus (see the preceding section), this
shortcut isn’t really faster than using the mouse.
154
Part XI: The Keyboard

The key to using the keyboard to manipulate a window is under-
standing the Control menu. All windows have a Control menu,
flagged by a tiny icon in the window’s upper-left corner. Clicking
that icon with the mouse, or pressing Alt+spacebar, displays the
Control menu.
Not all Control menus are the same. Some programs have special
items, but a few common items are on the Control menu. Some
items let you manipulate the window by using the keyboard:
Restore: The window is restored to its previous size and location
after being maximized.
Move: The window can be moved by using the four arrow keys on
the keyboard. Simply press an arrow key to move the window in
that direction. Press Enter or Esc when you’re done moving the
window.
Size: The window’s size can be changed. First, press an arrow key
to indicate which side of the window you want to move: right, left,
top, or bottom. Then press the corresponding arrow keys to move
that side of the window in or out. Press Enter or Esc when you’re
done.
Minimize: The window is minimized and becomes a button on the
taskbar.
Maximize: The window is maximized to fill the entire screen.
Close: The window is closed. If the window is a program, the pro-
gram quits. The keyboard shortcut to directly access this com-
mand is Alt+F4.
Dead Keys
Certain legacy keys are left over on the PC’s keyboard from days
gone by. Although some programs may use these, most don’t. They
exist on the PC’s keyboard for compatibility with older programs.
SysRq. The System Request key was once considered the important
operating system key. Sadly, that time never came to pass,
although the key has remained on the keyboard, albeit tucked
under the Print Screen key.
Pause. This key was once used to pause the text display, which was
necessary when the PC was an all-text computer. Today, the key
may still be used to pause the action in some games, but otherwise
it has lost its function.
Dead Keys
155

Break. This key was used in the old DOS application to cancel a
program, often in conjunction with the Ctrl key. Today, it hides
below the Pause key, out of sight and out of mind.
The Help Key
No Help key is on the PC’s keyboard. Instead, in Windows the F1
key is used to summon help. Press F1 in most applications or in
Windows itself to bring up a Help window, often specific to what-
ever action you’re doing in a program.
(Help keys were once common on computer keyboards. In fact, the
Macintosh computer keyboard sports a key labeled Help.)
Keyboard Basics
Computer keyboards have evolved through the years, from primi-
tive teletypes to terminals to the standard PC keyboard of today.
Even then, the current PC keyboard model, the 104-key keyboard, is
only a few years old. And, variations on that keyboard exist from
manufacturer to manufacturer, especially on laptop PCs.
Keyboard layout
Keyboards include these four main areas:
 Function keys: These keys, on the top row of the keyboard, are
labeled F1 through F12.
 Typewriter keys: These are the alphabet and number keys,
plus a smattering of punctuation and other symbols — the main
part of your computer’s keyboard.
 Cursor-control keys: Just to the right of the typewriter keys,
these keys are used to move a cursor or insertion pointer on
the screen, as well as for general editing. The keys are dupli-
cated on the numeric keypad. Some manuals refer to these as
the arrow keys.
 Numeric keypad: This area contains duplicates of the number
keys, 0 through 9, along with a period and various mathemati-
cal symbols. This area is designed for quick number entry. Also,
the numeric keypad doubles as a secondary location for the
cursor-control keys. The Num Lock key determines which set of
keys — numeric or cursor — are in use. When the Num Lock
light is on, the numeric keys are used.
156
Part XI: The Keyboard

Note that the mathematical symbols surrounding the numeric
keypad aren’t exactly the ones you learned about in grammar
school. Here’s a quick translation:
 + is for addition.
 – is for subtraction.
 * is for multiplication.
 / is for division.
Shift keys
Unlike a typewriter, the computer keyboard has three sets of Shift
keys. These keys are used in combination with other keys to dis-
play interesting characters on the screen, control the cursor, or
give commands to the computer:
 Alt: Short for Alternate Shift key, this key is used in combina-
tion with other shift keys or with letter keys to carry out com-
mands or functions in Windows.
 Ctrl: Also called the Control key, this key is used in combination
with various letter keys to issue command shortcuts, such as
Ctrl+P (“Control pee”) to print.
 Shift: This key works just like the Shift key on a typewriter. Shift
is used primarily with the letter keys to produce uppercase
text. Shift can also be used with other keys and in combination
with other shift keys.
When these keys are used in combination with other keys, a plus
sign joins them. For example, Shift+S means to press the Shift and S
keys, to yield a capital S on the screen. Ctrl+S is the Save command
in many programs. And, a command can even use multiple shift
keys, such as Ctrl+Alt+Q.
The Win, or Windows, key can also be used as a shift key.
Occasionally some programs may direct you to press the Shift, Ctrl,
or Alt key alone. For example, you press the Alt key alone to acti-
vate the menu bar.
Yes, there are two sets of Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys. You can use
either one unless an application directs you to use the left or right
key specifically.
Lock keys
Three Lock keys are on the PC’s keyboard, which are also associ-
ated with three Lock lights, either above the numeric keypad or on
the Lock keys themselves:
Keyboard Basics
157

 Caps Lock: Used like Shift-Lock on a typewriter. When this key
is active, and the Caps Lock light is on, all alphabet keys on the
keyboard generate uppercase letters. But, note that unlike a
typewriter, Caps Lock doesn’t shift the number keys to their
symbols.
 Num Lock: When this key is active, and the Num Lock light is
on, the numeric keypad generates numbers. Otherwise, the
numeric keypad is used as a cursor keypad.
 Scroll Lock: This locking key isn’t used in Windows. Only a few
spreadsheet programs use it. When Scroll Lock is on, and its
light is on, using the cursor keys moves the entire worksheet,
not just the cell selector.
See also “Special Keys.”

various shortcut keys in Windows because your hands are often
resting on the keyboard anyway.

Keyboard Types
There is really only one type of keyboard for the PC: the standard
104-key keyboard. It’s called 104-key because it really does have
104 keys. That’s three more keys than the old 101-key keyboard,
which was a standard for about 15 years. (Before that, the original
IBM PC used an 83-key keyboard.)
The extra three keys on the 104-key keyboard are the two Windows
keys and the Application key. See also “Special Keys.”
There are variations on the standard keyboard, including wireless
keyboards, ergonomically designed keyboards, and keyboards with
specialty buttons on them for doing things like sending e-mail,
searching the Web, scanning documents, setting the speaker
volume, and other tasks. Note that those keyboards and their 
special buttons are nonstandard.
Keys for Editing Text
Windows uses a common set of keyboard commands to edit,
change, or modify any text just about anywhere in Windows:
Key
Function
←
Move the text cursor left (back) one character.
→

Setting the Repeat Delay and Repeat Rate
Yes, there is a Keyboard icon in the Control Panel. The icon doesn’t
do much, however, unlike the Mouse icon (see also Part XII). But it
does let you control two important keyboard settings: the repeat
delay and the repeat rate.
The repeat delay is the length of time the keyboard waits while you
press a key before that key starts repeating. So, press and hold the
D key, and eventually the computer repeats the letter: DDDDDD.
The pause before it goes nuts like that is the repeat delay.
The repeat rate is how quickly the characters appear after the
repeat delay time has elapsed.
You use the Keyboard icon in the Control Panel to set the repeat
delay and the repeat rate. There’s a text box where you can check
your settings before clicking the OK button to lock them in.
Special Keys
A few keys carry more weight than others. These keys are impor-
tant to know:
The Windows key: This key is used primarily to pop up the
Start button’s menu, though the key can be used in combination
with other keys to do various and interesting things. It’s often
abbreviated Win.
The Application key: This key exists to the left of the second
Windows key on the standard 104-key PC keyboard. This key is
rarely used, though when you select an icon or item and press
this key, that item’s Properties dialog box is displayed. Yawn.
The Fn key: This key is found mostly on laptop PCs. It’s used in
combination with other keys on a laptop to produce key combina-
tions not normally available on the smaller, laptop keyboard.
Special Keys
163

The Enter key: This key must be important because two of them
are on the keyboard. Relax! Both Enter keys do the same thing.
Enter is commonly used as a command key to signal to Windows
that you’re done typing a command or have finished making selec-
tions in a dialog box. It’s also used when writing text to mark the
end of a paragraph.
The Tab key: In Windows, you press Tab to move between fields in
a dialog box. This is important to remember because pressing the
Enter key is like clicking the OK button.
The Esc key: This key, also called escape, is used to cancel certain
operations. It can also be used to close some windows.
The Print Screen key: This key is used to take a snapshot of the
desktop (see also Part VIII). But, note that the key may also be
labeled PrtSc or Pr Scr or some other cryptic combination. They’re
all Print Screen keys.

The Mouse
C
omputers didn’t always have mice, but back then computers
weren’t exactly that easy to use. You can thank all those
graphics up on the screen for the necessity of a computer mouse.
The mouse makes working with graphics — and even manipulating
text — much easier. After all, computers don’t live by keyboard
input alone.

Part XII

Basic Mouse Actions
You can do only a few things with a computer mouse. Basically, you
can roll it around and click the buttons. But doing that in various
ways and in various combinations is given specific terms and
jargon:
Pointing: The most basic mouse command is “point,” as in “Point
the mouse at the circle.” This instruction requires you to move the
mouse around on your desk, which controls the mouse pointer on
the screen by moving it in a similar manner. You move and maneu-
ver the mouse until the mouse pointer on the screen is pointing at
some specific or interesting object.
Clicking: Pressing and releasing the mouse’s button is known as
clicking. But — aha! — the mouse has more than one button.
Therefore, the plain click is a quick press (and release) of the
mouse’s main button, the one under your index finger. For right-
handed people, that’s the left mouse button.
Clicking the mouse is done in combination with pointing.
Clicking may also be done in combination with pressing a shift key
on the keyboard: Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or a combination of these.
Clicking the mouse does indeed make a clicking noise. The com-
puter may also be programmed to play a sound when you click the
mouse, such as a squishing noise or painful little yelp.
Right-clicking: Pressing and releasing the right mouse button —
the one not normally pressed — is a right-click. This is important
to remember: A regular click is a click of the left button, and a right-
click is specifically the right button.
Double-click: Two quick clicks in a row is a double-click. For exam-
ple, a single click may merely select an object, to make it ready for
manipulation. But a double-click does something more powerful,
such as open an item or just cause it twice as much pain as a single
click.
Double-clicking must be done quickly; if you take too long, the com-
puter assumes that you have made two single clicks and not a
double click. See also “Changing the Double-Click Rate.”
There are also triple, quadruple, and quintuple clicks, depending
on the program.
Dragging: The drag operation involves pointing the mouse at some
object and then pressing and holding down the mouse’s (left)
button. You then move the mouse while keeping the button held
down. Releasing the mouse button ends the drag operation.
166
Part XII: The Mouse

Dragging is used to select groups of objects, an area, or a swath of
text, or to move things around. The key is to keep the mouse
button down.
Selecting: The mouse is often used to select an object or text on
the screen. This is done by using a number of mouse techniques,
depending on what is being selected.
For example, to select a graphical object or icon, you click the
mouse on the object. That highlights the object, indicating that it’s
selected and ready for action.
To select a group of items or a span of text, you drag the mouse
over the items or text. You can also select text by double-clicking
the mouse on the text, or by triple-clicking or using a shift key
while clicking. (It depends on the application.)
Selected objects and text appear highlighted on the screen.
The best way to get familiar with using the mouse is to play one of
the many games included with Windows, such as Solitaire, FreeCell,
or Minesweeper. These games help you practice the basic mouse
movements just described, as well as kill some time and have fun.
Changing the Double-Click Rate
A double-click is defined as two clicks in rapid succession at the
same location. The location can vary slightly; the mouse program-
ming forgives a few pixels on the screen one way or the other. But
the “rapid succession” part can vary, and can be controlled:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Mouse icon to display the Mouse Properties dialog
box.
3. Click the Activities tab.
The tab may be different; because many types and brands of
mice are available for computers, not every Mouse Properties
dialog box is alike.
4. Use the slider in the Double-Click Speed area to adjust the
double-click speed slower or faster. Test the speed by double-
clicking the mouse in the Test Area display.
5. Click OK to set the new double-click speed.
Changing the Double-Click Rate

Connecting a Mouse
Connecting a mouse to the console is easy: Basically, you just plug
the thing in.
For a mouse plugged into the console’s mouse port, first turn off
the console and then plug the mouse in. Turn the computer on
after the mouse is connected. Likewise, turn off the console when
you’re disconnecting the mouse from the mouse port.
For USB and serial mice, you can connect or disconnect the mouse
while keeping the console on.
Serial mice traditionally plug into the COM1 port. (COM2 is used
internally by the dial-up modem.)
See also Part I.
Extra Mouse Buttons
The standard PC mouse has three buttons:
 The left button, which is the main button
 The right button
 A center wheel, which is also a button
Some mice may have even more buttons. Windows doesn’t offi-
cially use those buttons for anything, so you can use the Mouse
icon in the Control Panel, on the Buttons tab, to assign functions to
those extra buttons.
For example, the IntelliMouse Explorer has two bonus buttons on
the left side, which can be manipulated with your right thumb.
These buttons can be mapped to any key combination or assigned
commands that do things in Windows. For this to work, you must
install the specific software that comes with your computer mouse.
Increasing the Mouse Pointer Visibility
It’s easy to lose a mouse on the desktop. To help find the wayward
little guy, you can activate some bonus pointer features:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Mouse icon in the Control Panel to display the Mouse
Properties dialog box.
168
Part XII: The Mouse

3. Click the Pointer Options tab.
Several options are available to increase mouse visibility,
depending on the type of mouse you have. The two common
options are
• Pointer Trails. This option causes multiple pointers to
“comet tail” after the mouse pointer.
• Show Location. This option causes a ring of concentric cir-
cles to appear around the pointer when either Ctrl key is
pressed.
4. Make your selection, and then click OK.
You can also increase the pointer’s size by choosing a larger
pointer, or an animated pointer, or even an inverse color pointer.
See also “Mouse Pointers.”
Left-Handed Mouse
Not everyone is right handed. There’s hope for you southpaws, and
for other folks who prefer to hold the mouse in their left hand.
Windows lets you reassign the mouse buttons, left and right, so
that you can use the right mouse button with your left hand —
which makes sense and is quite a kind gesture to the left-handed
part of the population:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Mouse icon in the Control Panel to display the Mouse
Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Buttons tab.
4. Change the function of the Left button to Right-Click.
Use the drop-down list to assign the new button function.
5. Change the function of the Right button to Click.
6. Click OK.
Remember that you have a left-handed mouse! Most computer doc-
umentation assumes that the mouse is right-handed. So whenever
you see a “right-click” direction, remember to click your left mouse
button.
Left-Handed Mouse

The Mouse Pad
A mouse pad is merely a small piece of foam rubber on which a
computer mouse can roll very well. This is an optional item to pur-
chase for a computer; in fact, optical mice don’t need a mouse pad,
although mechanical, or “ball,” mice can really benefit from the tex-
tured surface a mouse pad offers.
Mouse pads are often covered in special designs or with pictures of
something pleasing or inspiring.
Just about anything can be used as a mouse pad, but textured sur-
faces work best. Avoid slick mouse pads.
A mouse pad also ensures that you will have at least one clean area
on your desk to roll the mouse around!
Mouse Pointers
The graphical doohickey that the mouse manipulates on the desk-
top is the mouse pointer. Some may call it a mouse cursor or just
cursor, but that’s easy to confuse with the text cursor. To avoid con-
fusion, and because the thing looks like a pointer anyway, I use the
term mouse pointer.
Making the pointer go faster or slower
The mouse pointer can be geared to go faster or slower, which is
controlled from the Mouse Properties dialog box, on the Pointer
Options tab:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Mouse icon in the Control Panel to display the Mouse
Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Pointer Options tab.
4. Adjust the pointer speed slider slower or faster.
5. Click OK.
A faster pointer is easier to use when you have a larger screen or
high screen-size setting. Slower pointers are better when you’re
working with graphics or other things that require precise mouse
movement.
If the Mouse Properties dialog box sports an acceleration option
for the mouse pointer, I highly recommend that you use it. The
acceleration option directs the pointer to move in greater dis-
tances when you move the mouse faster and to move the pointer
more precisely when the mouse is moving slowly.
170
Part XII: The Mouse

Choosing a new pointer
The mouse pointer can be replaced with just about any graphical
image, from a real arrow to a pointing hand to a tomahawk. This is
done by using the Pointers tab in the Mouse Properties dialog box:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Mouse icon in the Control Panel to display the Mouse
Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Pointers tab.
4. In the scrolling list of pointers, click to select the Normal Select
pointer.
5. Click the Browse button.
A special type of Open dialog box appears, listing a cartload of
various pointers available in Windows. Notice the special pre-
view area in the lower-left corner of this dialog box.
6. Click to select a new pointer from the many options listed.
The files beginning with the name arrow are all pointing
arrows, though you’re not limited to that selection for replac-
ing the Normal Select pointer.
7. Click the Open button to choose the highlighted pointer.
8. Click OK.
You can use these steps to replace any of the various mouse point-
ers. Note that there are different pointers for different activities.
There are no rules for what is or isn’t a proper pointer — but keep
in mind that all Windows documentation assumes that you’re using
the standard set of pointers.
Yes, it’s okay to have fun here.
Using an animated pointer
Many of the optional mouse pointers are animated. For example,
you can use spinning barber polls, lumbering dinosaurs, and snap-
ping fingers. To select one of these animated cursors, after Step 5
in the preceding subsection, choose Animated Cursors (*.ani) from
the Files of Type drop-down list in the Browse dialog box.
Loading a set of pointers
Windows comes with preset groups, or themes, of mouse pointers.
You can choose one of these themes by using the Scheme drop-
down list at the top of the Pointers tab in the Mouse Properties
dialog box. By choosing a theme or scheme, you can quickly
replace the whole set of mouse pointers at one time.
Mouse Pointers
171

Saving your own set of pointers
After customizing your mouse pointers, you can save your collec-
tion as a scheme, which saves time in case you need to reset all
the mouse pointers at some later point. To save a scheme on the
Pointers tab of the Mouse Properties dialog box, first set each indi-
vidual mouse pointer, and then click the Save As button. Use the
Save As dialog box to save your scheme just as you would save
any file.
I have a whole collection of personal schemes. For them, I created
a My Schemes folder inside my My Documents folder.
Mouse Types
There is really no such thing as a standard PC mouse. All mice have
left and right buttons, and most of them now have a wheel button
or similar gizmo between the buttons. But that’s where the similari-
ties stop.
This section covers various mouse options. Some mice may have
most or all of the options, and some may have none. The variety is
endless.
Air mouse
The very peculiar air mouse can be held up, off the desktop. In a
way, it kind of works like a TV remote control. That’s good for
demonstrations and perhaps some games, but, otherwise, mice work
best next to the keyboard, where they remain handy and accessible.
Mechanical, or ball, mouse
The traditional computer mouse uses a round ball on its underside
to detect movement. In fact, the very first mouse, pioneered in the
1960s, used such a ball to detect movement, though today the balls
(and the mouse) are much smaller. This type of mouse is known as
a mechanical mouse.
Optical mouse
The optical mouse uses a special light sensor to detect movement.
This mouse has, aside from the buttons, no moving parts, which
makes it extremely reliable. Also, unlike the mechanical mouse, the
optical mouse doesn’t require a mouse pad or textured surface —
though it doesn’t work on smooth, reflective surfaces.
Trackball mouse
The trackball is often called the upside-down mouse. With a track-
ball, the mouse is stationary and the mouse pointer is moved by
172
Part XII: The Mouse

rotating a large ball atop the mouse with your fingers. The mouse
also sports buttons and, often, a scroll ring around the ball, used
like the wheel button on a regular mouse.
Wheel button
The wheel button mouse has a wheel, or scroll, button between its
two regular buttons. The wheel can be clicked, just like a regular
button, and it’s known as a wheel-click.
The wheel button can also be pressed and held, which on most
wheel mice lets the mouse pan or scan the document, by scrolling
it up, down, left, or right or in whatever direction the mouse is
being dragged.
The wheel is primarily rolled back or forth, which has the effect of
scrolling the contents of whatever window the mouse is pointing
at — similar to using the up or down arrows on the keyboard. In
fact, the amount of scroll can be adjusted in the wheel mouse’s
Properties dialog box.
In some applications, pressing the Ctrl key on the keyboard while
scrolling the wheel button zooms in or out on the document.
The latest rage in computer mouse wheels is the tilting wheel: You
can tilt the wheel to the left or right to pan a long document left or
right.
Wireless mouse
A wireless mouse requires no wires to connect to the desktop,
which is great if you have a cluttered desk already. There are two
types of wireless mice:
 Radio frequency (RF): This mouse uses an electronic signal to
connect to the base station.
 Infrared (IR): This mouse uses an infrared light to connect to
the base station. The path between the mouse and base station
must not be obscured or else the IR mouse doesn’t work.
Wireless mice require batteries, which I recommend that you 
keep on hand in abundance. Either that, or the mouse must be
recharged. I recommend getting a rechargeable mouse base station,
which not only keeps the wireless mouse in a convenient place, but
also recharges the mouse when it’s docked.
Eventually, wires come into play with wireless mice. The base sta-
tion, or receiving unit, must be connected to the console somehow,
either directly to the mouse port or into a USB port.

board, often used in combination
with some other key, though it
can be used by itself.
application: Another name for a com-
puter program, though usually
describing a major software cate-
gory, such as word processing,
spreadsheet, or e-mail.
Apply button: Used like the OK button
in a dialog box, in that it accepts
any changes. Unlike clicking 
the OK button, clicking the 
Apply button doesn’t close the
dialog box.
arrow keys: Another term for the
cursor keys on the keyboard.
There are four basic arrow keys:
up, down, left, and right.
asterisk: The * symbol on the key-
board. Used to represent multipli-

recordable.
CD-ROM: Acronym for Compact
Disc–Read-Only Memory.
CD-ROMs are discs that contain
megabytes of information.
CD-RW: A CD that can have informa-
tion written to it, and can also be
erased and used again. RW stands
for rewriteable.
Celeron: Another popular type of
