A Language of Forms
We deﬁne the formulas of our language like this:

A Language of Forms
We deﬁne the formulas of our language like this:
▶Atoms (e.g. p, q, r, s, x, y, r3, s15, p1, p0, . . .) are formulas.

▶If A and B are formulas,
then so are (A & B), (A ∨B), (A ⊃B) and (A ≡B).

Showing that something is a formula
(∼p ⊃(q & r))

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)
∼∼((p ∨∼q) ≡∼r)

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)
∼∼((p ∨∼q) ≡∼r)
(((p ⊃q) & (q ⊃r)) ∨(p ⊃r))

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)
∼∼((p ∨∼q) ≡∼r)
(((p ⊃q) & (q ⊃r)) ∨(p ⊃r))
These are not formulas:
p∼

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)
∼∼((p ∨∼q) ≡∼r)

(p & q ∨r)

Examples of Formulas and Non-Formulas
These are formulas:
((p & q) ⊃r)
∼∼((p ∨∼q) ≡∼r)
(((p ⊃q) & (q ⊃r)) ∨(p ⊃r))
These are not formulas:
p∼
(p & q ∨r)
p ≡(q ⊃∼r)

An Exercise: A Tiny Langauge
Consider a tiny language which contains only two Atoms—p and q.
And suppose we form all the formulas of our baby language just
using these two atoms.
Which of these following are formulas of this little language?
▶⊃p
▶((p ∨q) ⊃q)
▶(p ∨r)
How many formulas in this baby language contain just 2 symbols?
How about 3? Or 4? Or more?
