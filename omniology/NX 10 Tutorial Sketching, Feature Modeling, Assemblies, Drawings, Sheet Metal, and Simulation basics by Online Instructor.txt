approach.
Chapter 4 teaches you to generate drawings of the models constructed in the earlier
chapters. You will also learn to generate exploded views, and part list of an assembly.
Chapter 5: In this chapter, you will learn the tools needed to create 2D sketches.
Chapter 6: In this chapter, you will learn additional modeling tools to construct complex
models.

Chapter 7: This chapter helps you to create, edit, and use expressions in your designs.
Chapter 8: introduces you to NX Sheet Metal design. You will construct a sheet metal
part using the tools available in the NX Sheet Metal environment.
Chapter 9: teaches you to create an assembly using Top-down design approach.
Chapter 10: teaches you to add dimensions and annotations to your drawings.
Chapter 11: introduces you to Finite Element Analysis.

Chapter 1: Getting Started
In this chapter, you will learn some of the most commonly used features of NX. Also, you
will learn about the user interface.
In NX, you construct 3D parts and use them to generate 2D drawings and 3D assemblies.
NX is Feature Based. Features are shapes that are combined to build a part. You can
modify these shapes individually.
Most of the features are sketch-based. A sketch is a 2D profile and can be extruded,
revolved, or swept along a path to construct features.
NX is parametric in nature. You can specify standard parameters between the elements
of a part. Changing these parameters changes the size and shape of the part. For example,
see the design of the body of a flange before and after modifying the parameters of its
features

constraint the sketch.
As you add dimensions, the sketch can attain any one of the following three states:
Fully Constrained sketch: In a fully constrained sketch, the positions of all the entities

are fully described by dimensions or constraints or both. In a fully constrained sketch, all
the entities are dark green color.
Under Constrained sketch: Additional dimensions or constraints or both are needed to
completely define the geometry. In this state, you can drag the sketch elements to modify
the sketch. An under constrained sketch element is in maroon color.
Over Constrained sketch: In this state, an object has conflicting dimensions or relations
or both. An over constrained sketch entity is grey. The over constraining dimensions are in
red color.
. Double-click on the dimension displayed on the sketch; the Dimension edit box
appears.
2. To change the dimension to 100 mm, type a new value, and then press Enter.

 Touch Align: Using this constraint, you can make two faces coplanar to each other.
Note that if you set the Orientation to Align, the faces will point in the same direction.
You can also align the centerlines of the cylindrical faces.
 Concentric: This constraint makes the centers of circular edges coincident. In
addition, the circular edges will be on the same plane.
 Distance: This constraint provides an offset distance between two objects.
 Fix: This constraint fixes a component at its current position.
 Parallel: This constraint makes two objects parallel to each other.
Perpendicular: This constraint makes two objects perpendicular to each other.
 Fit: This constraint brings two cylindrical faces together. Note that they should have
the same radius.
 Bond: This constraint makes the selected components rigid so that they move
together.
 Center: This constraint positions the selected component at a center plane between
two components.
 Angle: Applies angle between two components.
