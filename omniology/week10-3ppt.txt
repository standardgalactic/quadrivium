1. Explain the importance of the peritubular capillary of 
the kidney cortex.   
2. Describe the cellular mechanism for transport of glucose 
and bicarbonate by the proximal convoluted tubule 
(PCT).   
3. Contrast the transcellular and paracellular pathways for 
movement of water across the renal tubular 
epithelium and explain solvent drag of K+. 
4. Define maximal transport rate and transport threshold. 
5. Explain secretion of organic compounds in the PCT.  
6. Explain the factors that increase K+ secretion in the 
collecting duct.   
Learning Objectives 

PROXIMAL CONVOLUTED 
TUBULE (PCT) FUNCTIONS    
•
Filtration (F) moves solutes and water into the  
      lumen of the tubule.  
•
Reabsorption (R) moves solutes from the lumen  
      of the tubule to the blood. 
•
Secretion (S) moves solutes from the blood to the  
      lumen of the tubule. 

PORTAL SYSTEM &  
PRESSURE GRADIENTS 

REABSORPTION IN 
PROXIMAL TUBULE (PCT)  
•2nd active transport uses Na+ for  
co-transport of many solutes such as  
glucose and amino acids. 
• Water follows Na+ to enter the blood. 
 
• HCO3 is impermeable. HCO3 combines   
with H+ to form H2O and CO2 in the lumen  
in presence of carbonic anhydrase (c.a.).  
H+ and HCO3 are generated inside the PCT 
cells by c.a. reaction. HCO3- exits the basal 
side. H+ exits the luminal side . 

RATE OF TRANSPORT  
Why is glucose found in the urine of patients 
with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus?  

TRANSCELLULAR  MOVEMENT  
 
Solutes cross epithelial cells via secondary active 
transport coupled to Na+ movement.  
 
Others (e.g., urea, Cl-) cross by facilitated 
diffusion.   
  
PARACELLULAR MOVEMENT 
 
Water moves between the renal tubular 
epithelium cells.  
 
SOLVENT DRAG 
 
K+ moves between the PCT tubular epithelial 
cells following water.  
TERMS 

SECRETION IN PROXIMAL 
CONVOLUTED (PCT) TUBULE  
• Movement of organic compounds (toxins, 
metabolic waste products) from blood 
(peritubular capillary) into the renal tubule 
occurs by secondary active transport. 
 
• Transporters are located in the basal surface 
of the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) 
epithelial cells.   
 
• Transport is saturable.   

SECRETION IN 
COLLECTING DUCT (CD) 
•
Principal cells reabsorb Na+  
    
      and secrete K+. 
 
•
K+ secretion is increased by 
increased Na+ delivery to CD and 
by increased filtrate flow in CD.   
 
•
K+ secretion can be increased by  
      aldosterone. 

1. Reabsorption moves filtered solutes from the renal  
       tubule to the blood.  
2. Reabsorption of solutes occurs predominantly within  
       the PCT.  
3. Most solutes cross the epithelium in a transcellular  
       manner by secondary active transport.  
4. Reabsorption within the PCT occurs isosmotically.  
       Water crosses this epithelium via aquaporin and in  
       a paracellular manner.  K+ moves by solvent drag.  
5. Secretion is the movement of solutes from the blood  
       to the lumen. This occurs in the PCT by secondary  
       active transport.  
6. Secretion of K+ occurs in the CD in response either to  
       increased Na+ delivery or to high filtrate flow.   
       Aldosterone acts here to increase K+ secretion.
