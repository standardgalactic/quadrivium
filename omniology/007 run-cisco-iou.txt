Cisco IOU
●
IOU means IOS on Unix and it’s  a modiﬁed IOS used by Cisco for CCIE labs and virtual 
lab pods used in Cisco Learning Center.
●
There are both a L3 and L2 IOU versions .
●
IOU is resource friendly and can be run smoothly on a normal laptop or PC .
Note: Unfortunately due to legal requirements, I am unable to provide  IOS images or any 
other Cisco images like IOU (IOS os Unix). You will need to provide your own images to use 
them with GNS3.
