Introduction
The idea of this book started when I was traveling without my camera and wanted to take 
photos in Paris. So, I just grabbed my iPhone and started taking shots of the amazing 
sightseeing there. That’s when I discovered that the iPhone is a powerful photography 
tool with a high-quality camera lens, stabilization capabilities, and small form factor. 
The numerous photography and photo-editing apps on the App Store make it even more 
powerful.
Therefore, this book aims to help both professional and nonprofessional 
photographers start using their iPhones as a photography tool. It contains dozens of tips 
that start by helping you understand the core photography features on your iPhone and 
how to get the most out of them. Then, it moves on to tips that will help you use your 
iPhone to create photography projects that you used to create using your DSLR camera. 
These tips cover basic photo-editing skills such as adjusting colors, fixing issues, and 
replacing the background.
The tips then cover more photography techniques such as creating double-exposure 
effects, low-light photos, and high-key photos. These tips simulate the techniques 
that can be done using the existing light in the scene of the shot. The later chapters 
give you more photo-editing tips, such as creating a composition of different photos, 
manipulating photos to create dramatic scenes, creating digital artwork, and more.
During these tips, you will explore how to use a number of apps that can help you 
extend your iPhone’s photography capabilities. This includes the Adobe mobile apps 
for Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom that simulate the desktop-based photo-editing 
versions. Most of the other apps in the book can be easily grabbed from the Apple App 
Store. Some are free, and others include trial versions to try before buying.
Later in the book, the tips explore how to organize your work on your iPhone and 
how to handle the space issues using the different cloud technologies including iCloud. 
Then you will explore how to start your work on your iPhone and then take it back to 
your computer to add even more effects to the shot.
All the photos in this book were taken with an iPhone by my wife, Radwa Khalil, and 
me in different countries. The only photo that was not taken by an iPhone device is the 
Earth photo that was grabbed from Wikipedia under the public domain copyright.

How to Use This Book
Each chapter in this book includes a number of tips that cover skills related to mastering 
iPhone photography. Each tip stands alone, so you can start the book with any of these 
tips and try them individually. If you are a newbie at using your iPhone as a photography 
tool, you can start with the first tip and move forward from there. If you have some 
knowledge, reviewing the first tips will help you to organize your photos and find hidden 
features on your iPhone.
Each tip gives an example of the workflow to create a specific effect. So, you need to 
read each tip and follow its steps and then try to apply it using your own photos. You may 
need to explore different values and options to create the most effective output with your 
own photographs. At the end of each chapter, there is a practice task that you can use to 
apply the effects used in the chapter to a photo and share it on different social networks; 
just use the hashtag #iPhonePhotography or mention me (@rafiqelmansy) on Facebook, 
Twitter, or LinkedIn. I will be checking your work and commenting on it.
Practice, Practice, and Practice
The more you practice with your iPhone, the more you will improve your skills. This 
book will start you on your journey, but further practice is important. Use the steps and 
figures to guide you to create effects based on each tip. Once you feel confident with 
these tips, you can move forward and explore other effects and techniques using the 
different photo apps available on the App Store to create even more fantastic iPhone 
photography projects.

CHAPTER 1
Unleash Your iPhone 
Camera’s Capabilities
While the camera doesn’t make the photographer, a good camera can definitely take 
your creative shots to another dimension and extend your ability to apply different 
techniques, especially with the evolving technologies related to digital photography 
cameras. The same rule applies to phone photography. The excellent camera in your 
iPhone allows you to take photos for both professional and personal purposes without 
the need to hold heavy photography gear. The Apple iPhone’s camera is one of the 
features that sets the phone above the competitors.
To get the most of your iPhone camera, it is crucial to understand the camera’s 
capabilities and the different features that can help you take good photos using both the 
default and third-party photography apps. In this chapter, you’ll explore the capabilities 
of the default camera and the Photos app before moving on to different photography 
techniques in the remaining chapters.
Mastering Your iPhone Camera
Your iPhone camera has hidden features that can help you open the Camera app quickly. 
You can also improve your photo’s composition by applying a grid system to align your 
scene.

2
Get Easy Access to Your Camera
One of the iPhone’s advantages is the ability to quickly take photos anywhere and 
anytime. All you need to do is grab the phone out of your pocket or bag, open the 
Camera application, and take the shot. However, you need to know how to quickly access 
the Camera app in order to catch those special moments, such as your kids playing or 
your favorite team winning the game. The iPhone gives you three main ways to access 
the Camera app quickly.
Swipe to Open
The first method is to swipe through your screen. This allows you to open the Camera 
app while the phone is locked, which is considered the quickest way to access the 
camera. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 If your iPhone is asleep, press the home button once to open the 
display.
	 2.	 While you are on the lock screen, swipe from the right side of the 
screen toward the left side to open the Camera app, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

Camera app

Use the Phone Control Center 
The second method can be used while the phone is locked or unlocked; you just go 
through the phone’s Control Center.
	 1.	 If your iPhone is asleep, press the home button once to open the 
display.
	 2.	 Swipe with your figure from the home button toward the top of 
your phone, as shown in Figure 1-2.
	 3.	 Tap the Camera app in the Control Center.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

5
Figure 1-2.  Swipe from the bottom of the screen toward the top to open the 
Control Center
These two methods are helpful when you need to easily access the camera when the 
phone is locked, while the next method allows you to access the camera quickly while 
you are using other applications on the phone.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

6
Add the Camera App to the Dock
The third method is to add the Camera app to the dock of your phone. This helps you 
easily find the camera among the other applications installed on your mobile device. You 
can add the camera to the dock as follows:
	 1.	 Press your phone’s home button twice to access the main screen 
(use a fingerprint or passcode if needed).
	 2.	 Tap and hold slightly on the Camera app icon; you will see it 
vibrate to indicate it can be repositioned, as shown in Figure 1-3.
	 3.	 Drag it to the screen dock next to your most used applications 
such as the Mail app and the Safari browser. If the dock is full, you 
can add it by removing the least used application from the dock.

Take Your Shot in Multiple Ways
The iPhone helps you to take your photo through three different methods based on 
different situations. The default method is to tap the camera button once to take the shot, 
as highlighted in Figure 1-4.
You can also press the volume button up or down to take the shot, also shown in 
Figure 1-4. This option helps you to hold your phone properly while taking the shot. It 
works similarly to the shutter button on your digital camera if your phone is in landscape 
position. Finally, if you are using a wired headset, you can use the volume buttons on 
your headset to take your shot. This helps you to take photos stealthily. For example, you 
can capture natural moments of your children playing without them noticing to produce 
spontaneous photos. Using the headset buttons can help you avoid shaking the phone 
while taking the picture.

Enable the Grid Guides
As you probably know, the composition of a photo plays an essential role in making a 
great shot. The Camera app provides grids that can guide you while taking your shot to 
ensure that the composition is visually appealing. The Grid option divides the screen 
into three columns and three rows. This can help you to place the elements exactly 
where you want them in the photo. Follow these steps to enable the Grid feature:
	 1.	 Tap the Settings icon on your phone.
	 2.	 Scroll down and tap Photo & Camera.
	 3.	 Activate the Grid feature in the Camera section, as shown in 
Figure 1-5.

Shoot in Burst Mode
For fast-moving events such as sports or children playing, you may need to take multiple 
shots of the same event so you can pick the best shot later. While tapping the camera 
button repeatedly would be too slow, the iPhone’s Burst mode can help. It allows you to 
take multiple photos almost instantly by simply tapping and holding the camera button. 
The longer you hold the button, the more photos are taken in burst mode.
Once you release the button, the photos are saved in a special folder in the Camera 
Roll called the Burst folder. To see the photos in the Burst folder, you can follow these 
steps:
	 1.	 In the Photos app, tap the Burst folder to select it.
	 2.	 Tap Select in the middle-bottom toolbar.
	 3.	 Navigate through the different photos in the burst set, as shown in 
Figure 1-6.

14
To select one photo in the folder, you can do the following:
	 1.	 Select the image and tap Done at the top right of the screen, as 
shown in Figure 1-6.
	 2.	 Either tap Keep Everything to keep the folder and save the 
selected image (or images) as a separate image or tap Keep One 
Favorite to keep the selected image only and delete the rest.
Once either of the options is selected, the selected image (or images) is separated 
from the Burst folder and added to your photos as a normal photo.
Set Up Manual Focus and Exposure 
By default, the iPhone camera sets the focus in your photo automatically toward the 
nearest object in the composition. However, you may need to change this such as 
when you want to focus on a far object in the shot. The iPhone gives you the option 
to manually set the focus and exposure of the photo by simply tapping the object you 
would like to focus on; the camera will shift the focus in the shot to the selected object, as 
shown in Figure 1-7.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

15
Figure 1-7.  Tap the object to manually set the focus and exposure
After setting up the focus to the selected element, the exposure of the photo may 
change based on the light conditions in the image. If you want to modify the exposure, 
tap and drag up and down to open the exposure slider, which allows you to increase or 
decrease the exposure in the photo.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

16
Lock the Exposure and Focus 
Even though the iPhone gives you the flexibility to set the exposure and the focus in a 
shot, it has a drawback, especially when you are taking a photo where the elements may 
move. Or you might want to take multiple images of the same scene without changing 
the focus each time you take the shot.
To lock the focus and exposure, you can do the following:
	 1.	 Wait for the camera to optimize the photo exposure and photo.
	 2.	 Tap and hold on the screen until the yellow AE/AF Lock label 
appears at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 1-8.
	 3.	 Tap the screen and drag up and down to change the shot 
brightness.

Note that if you close the Camera app and open it again, you need to set the lock 
again on the new shot.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

18
Take HDR Photos
High dynamic range (HDR) photos are a combination of photos of the same shot taken 
using different exposure values. Merging between these photos creates a dramatic effect 
in the photos that is known as the HDR photo effect. Unlike normal images, HDR photos 
include more contrasting colors and variations of shades and light.
You can activate the HDR photo effect by simply tapping the HDR icon at the top 
of the screen to activate it, as shown in Figure 1-9. Note that taking photos of moving 
subjects using this technique may cause distorted images because the tool allows you 
to take three images with different exposures and merge them together. So, it is better to 
use this effect with still subjects.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

19
Figure 1-9.  Tap the HDR icon at the top of the screen
While you take the HDR photos, you may like to keep the normal images for further 
work. To do this, you need to change the HDR setting.
	 1.	 Select Settings ➤ Photos & Cameras.
	 2.	 In the HDR section, turn on the Keep Normal Photo option.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

20
Take Live Photos
A feature that was added to the iPhone camera starting in iPhone 6s/6s Plus is Live 
Photos. As you take pictures, the Live Photos feature records a small segment of video 
associated with the image. When you tap and hold on the image, the image starts to 
move, showing how the elements were moving while taking the shot. Live Photos also 
supports audio, so it is like having an image with a small video associated with it.
To activate the Live Photos feature, tap the Live Photos icon at the top of the camera 
screen before taking your shot. When you tap the camera button, iPhone records 1.5 
seconds before and after the shot, which creates a total of three seconds of video with 
audio.
To play the video, you need to open the photo and then tap and hold on it to start 
the video. This type of photo is supported in desktop viewers such as the Photos app on 
Apple computers.
Quickly Access Different Photo Types
The iPhone camera allows you to take a variety of photos including regular, square, 
panorama, video, slow motion, and time lapse. The default method to switch between 
these modes is to access the Camera app and slide above either shutter button to select 
the photo or video type you would like to take. The quickest way to access these types is 
through 3D touch (available in iPhone 6s and 6s Plus and newer). Tap and hold firmly on 
the Camera app icon on your phone; the quick actions appear, and you can choose the 
type of photo you would like to take, as shown in Figure 1-10.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

22
Getting the Most Out of the Photos App
The default application that allows you to manage your photos on the iPhone and on 
Mac computers is the Photos app. It helps you to save, import, and manage photos taken 
using the iPhone. It also allows you to organize photos in albums, share photos, and save 
them on cloud services such as Apple iCloud, Dropbox, and others.
While many of the iPhone photography applications allow you to store photos in the 
application itself, saving the photos in the Photos app allows you to easily move between 
applications to apply different photo effects. Therefore, it is important to learn how to 
effectively use the Photos app.
Use the Moments and Collections Views
By default, when you open the Photos app, it displays the recent photos, but you 
can also review the photos based on the timeline of when you took them using the 
Collections view.
When you are in the Moments view (the default view), tap Collections at the top left 
of the screen, as shown in Figure 1-11. This will display the photos based on the month 
and where you took the photos. You can tap the months in order to zoom back to the 
Moments view. When the Collections view is active, tap the Years view to display the 
photos based on the year they are taken in. Then, you can tap each year to access the 
Collections view.

Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

24
Find Photos on Your Mobile Device
When your phone is full of photos, you need a way to find specific photos other than 
scrolling between them. The search feature in the Photos app provides a smart way to 
search for photos using different keywords including the following:
•	
The time when the photo was taken, such as the year or the month.
•	
The place where the photo was taken in. This can be a city, a country, 
or a specific location.
•	
An element placed inside the photo that can be named, such as a 
dog, a car, a beach, and so on.
•	
A person’s name in the photo based on the people saved in the 
People folder, as you will see in the following tip.
Save People’s Faces
By default when you take a photo and save it in the Photos app, the app tries to identify 
the people in the photo and saves the faces in the People folder. To take advantage 
of the face recognition feature in the Photos app, you need to assign a name for each 
recognized person in the People folder as follows:
	 1.	 Open the People folder in the Photos app’s Albums folder.
	 2.	 Select one of the identified faces and tap it; the face will be 
displayed along with the photos that include it.
	 3.	 In the name field at the top of the screen, add the name of the 
person, as shown in Figure 1-12. A drop-down list shows the 
names in the contact list. Select a name from the list.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

25
Figure 1-12.  Add the name of the person in the name field
If the photo of a person is displayed more than one time, this means the application 
couldn’t identify that those are actually one person. So, you can apply these same 
steps with the second face photo for the same person and include the same name. The 
application will ask you to merge the two data to unify all the images of the selected person.
After applying these steps, use the search feature as highlighted earlier to search for the 
person’s name; you will notice all the person’s photos are displayed in the search results.
Chapter 1  Unleash Your iPhone Camera’s Capabilities

26
Add Photos to Your Favorites and Create Albums
Sometimes you take a number of shots of the same scene and want to “favorite” one of 
these shots to be able to filter or use it later in photo editing. You can add photos to the 
Favorite folder with these steps:
	 1.	 Tap the photo to open it. Note that you don’t need to open it full-screen.
	 2.	 Tap the Favorite icon in the bottom bar, as shown in Figure 1-13.
Figure 1-13.  Tap the Favorite icon to save an image as a favorite

27
You can also organize photos by adding them to new albums; you can create a new 
album by doing the following:
	 1.	 Tap the Albums icon on the bottom right of the screen.
	 2.	 Tap the plus icon on the top right side of the screen.
	 3.	 Add the new album name and tap Save, as shown in Figure 1-14.

CHAPTER 2
Photo Retouching 
Techniques
In the previous chapter, you learned how to efficiently use the Photos app and the 
Camera app on your iPhone to take photos and organize them into albums. In many 
situations, taking photos using an iPhone is spontaneous: you notice an interesting 
scene or an action, so you grab your phone and take the shot. Unfortunately, the  
spur-­of-­the-moment nature of taking photos using mobile devices increases the 
chances of having problems related to colors, light, and composition. These problems 
can be frustrating, but you can fix them using the default Photos app or a wide range of 
apps that can be downloaded (either for free or a cost) from the Apple App Store. This 
chapter’s tips go through the steps to make these types of basic modifications on images.
Fix a Photo’s Colors
Tools used: Photos app, Adobe Lightroom app
A common problem when taking photos is poor lighting, which can cause bad color 
conditions. This is something that can’t be easily overcome when taking photos with 
your phone because you would need to carry external light sources and gear to fix the 
issues. So, when you take photos using your phone, you may have to modify the colors. 
You can do this by changing a photo’s properties such as the hue, saturation, contrast, 
temperature, and so on.
Many photo-editing applications can help you to modify the photo’s color settings. 
Here, you will explore how to modify the image colors using the Photos app on your 
mobile device and the Adobe Lightroom app that you can download for free from the 
App Store.

32
Modify Colors Using the Photos App
With the recent updates of the iPhone’s iOS, the Photos app has offers basic photo 
modification tools that can help you modify your photos without the need to install any 
third-party applications. These tools work fine, and you don’t have to fill your phone 
with many applications, especially if your phone has limited storage capacity. To edit a 
photo’s colors using the Photos app, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Photos app and tap the photo you want to edit to display 
it full size.
	 2.	 Tap the adjustment icon at the bottom of the screen (Edit in 
previous versions). This allows you to access photo-editing mode, 
as shown in Figure 2-1.

33
	 4.	 Tap the Color item to expand it.
	 5.	 Drag the Saturation slider to the left (moving the saturation red 
line to the right) to increase the saturation of the colors.
	 6.	 Tap the icon at the top right of the slider, and select Contrast in the 
Color section, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	 7.	 Drag the Contrast slider to the left (moving the contrast red line to 
the right) to increase the contrasted colors.
Figure 2-2.  The editing icon allows you to access the Light, Color, and B&W settings
	 3.	 Tap the editing icon, as shown in Figure 2-2, to access the edit 
options for Light, Color, and B&W. The Light options allow you 
to modify the light in the image, Color lets you modify the color 
properties, and B&W lets you convert the photo to black and white.
Chapter 2  Photo Retouching Techniques

Remove Photo Casting
Sometimes when you take photos in certain light conditions such as on cloudy days, in 
fluorescent light, or in warm light, the photo’s colors get affected with the surrounding 
light conditions, which creates a color casting effect. This effect can spoil the natural 
colors in an image. In other cases, you’ll want to add a cast color to create a special effect 
on the image, for instance, when adding a warmer effect to the image. To remove or add 
a color cast, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Tap the editing icon, and select the Color section.
	 2.	 Tap the icon at the top right of the color slider.
	 3.	 Tap Cast in the Color section, as shown in Figure 2-4.

Make a Color Adjustment Using Adobe Lightroom
Adobe Lightroom is the most powerful application for photo managing and editing. It 
gives you advanced capabilities for modifying a photo and its details. It is commonly 
used by professional photographers and photo editors. A “lighter” version of the 
application is available to download on your iPhone from the Apple App Store. To use 
the application, you need to create a free Adobe ID. The free version allows you to 
capture, organize, and share photos from your mobile device. If you have an Adobe 
Creative Cloud membership, you have access to the extended features of the application; 
you can save source formats and integrate between both the mobile and desktop 
Chapter 2  Photo Retouching Techniques

37
applications. If you signed up with Adobe with the free account, you will only have 
access to the basic main adjustment functions in the Lightroom mobile app.
In this tip, you will use the Lightroom mobile app to edit a photo’s colors. You can 
use similar steps to adjust the light in the Photos app.
	 1.	 Install Adobe Lightroom from the Apple App Store, and open the 
app after installing it.
	 2.	 Choose a photo from the existing Lightroom library or tap the 
Camera Roll button to open images from the phone’s existing 
albums. Also, you can tap the Camera icon on the bottom right of 
the screen to take a photo using the phone’s camera and add it to 
the Lightroom library. The photo opens on the screen, as shown in 
Figure 2-6.
Figure 2-6.  Tap the photo to open it in Adobe Lightroom
Chapter 2  Photo Retouching Techniques

38
	 3.	 Tap the Color icon at the bottom of the screen to open the Color 
adjustment options.
	 4.	 Use the White Balance drop-down list to change the color tone in 
the photo based on the surrounding colors, as shown in Figure 2-7.  
You can choose from the existing options, or you can choose a 
custom white balance using both the Temperature and Tint values.
Figure 2-7.  Adjusting the white balance in the Color setting
	 5.	 Use the Vibrance and Saturation sliders to affect the color 
intensity and vibrancy in the photo. Increasing the Vibrancy value 
creates brighter colors. Saturation sets the amount of color in the 
photo; for example, reducing the Saturation to -100 absorbs all the 
light from the photo and creates a black-and-white photo effect, as 
shown in Figure 2-8.
Chapter 2  Photo Retouching Techniques

39
Figure 2-8.  Reduce Saturation to -100 to create a black-and-white effect
You can also convert the photo to black and white by simply tapping the B&W button 
at the top left of the color adjustment panel. This option allows you to only modify the 
temperature and tint of the photo after converting it to black and white.
Perform Advanced Color Modifications
The color adjustment panel in Adobe Lightroom gives you even more advanced features 
to modify an image’s color. You can change the color based on a specific area in the 
photo or by selecting a color range to be modified without affecting the rest of the colors 
in the shot.
Chapter 2  Photo Retouching Techniques

40
To modify an image’s colors based on a specific spot in the photo, follow these 
steps:
	 1.	 In the Adobe Lightroom app, tap the Color icon at the bottom of the 
screen.
	 2.	 Tap the eyedropper icon at the top right of the color adjustment 
values in the panel. The magnifier will appear on the photo, as 
shown in Figure 2-9.

41
	 3.	 Drag the magnifier to the area where you want to change the color 
tones. You will notice that the colors in the photo change based on 
this sample.
	 4.	 You can modify the color using the sliders in the panel and 
customize your color tone.
In this example, you’ll modify an image’s color based on a specific area, which may 
include a number of colors. Additionally, you can modify the image based on a specific 
selected color or number of colors, which can be selected and modified individually as 
follows:
	 1.	 From the color adjustment panel, tap the Mix icon at the top right 
of the panel.
	 2.	 The colors that are included in the photo will appear as swatches 
at the top of the panel. From this color range, pick the color that 
you want to modify; you can change its properties such as Hue, 
Saturation, and Luminance, as shown in Figure 2-10.

Remove Backgrounds
Tools used: Photoshop Mix app
To merge between a number of photos, you may need to remove the background 
from an image to make it transparent to be able to add it to another image. There are a 
number of applications that allow you to remove backgrounds such as TouchRetouch, 
Eraser, and Photoshop Mix. If you are familiar with the desktop version of Adobe 
Photoshop, you will find yourself familiar with most of the Photoshop Mix app features. 
In this section, you will explore how to remove the background from one photo and 
place it in front of another background.
	 1.	 Open Adobe Photoshop Mix.
	 2.	 Log in with your Adobe ID (free or paid subscription). Tap the plus

This tool helps you to make a smart selection while dragging over the 
parts you would like to select. It uses the color similarity as a guide to 
select and remove parts.
•	
The Basic icon lets you drag to select the areas in the image. Unlike 
the Smart selection, this icon lets you manually define the areas that 
need to be removed.
•	
The Lasso tool lets you create a selection about specific areas in the 
photo as you draw with your finger or use the drawing pen around 
the area you would like to select.
•	
The Shape selection lets you make a selection based on a shape such 
as a rectangle, a circle, a triangle, or a square.
•	
Use the Refine icon to modify the smoothness of the selected area 
and how it blends with the background. You can also tap the Reset 
icon to return to the original version.
Remove Elements from a Photo
Tools: Photoshop Fix
Adobe Photoshop Mix allows you to manipulate images, but Photoshop Fix includes 
tools that allow you to fix issues that may appear in the photos. In this section, you will explore 
how to remove the unwanted parts from an image using Photoshop Fix. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Photoshop Fix app and log in with your Adobe ID.

Many applications can help you to edit and modify photos on the iPhone. These 
applications vary based on their capabilities. The mobile versions of Adobe apps provide 
a number of applications that can help you to edit photos in an environment similar 
to the desktop applications. You can use Adobe Lightroom to adjust the color and light 
in a photo to create a professional-looking outcome. You can use Photoshop Mix to 
merge different photos and select specific parts in a photo. To fix a photo, for instance, 
removing unwanted parts of the image, you can use Photoshop Fix.
Practice Exercise
In this practice exercise, take a photo using your iPhone and use Photoshop Fix to 
remove an object from the photo. Save the photo and use Photoshop Mix to blend it with 
another photo and then adjust the colors in the final composition.

CHAPTER 3
Working with  
Photography Projects
The newest DSLR cameras allow you to create different photography techniques easier 
than before. You can simply apply effects such as shallow depth of field and double 
exposure directly in your DSLR camera without the need to use computer applications 
such as Photoshop or Lightroom. While an iPhone camera doesn’t give you the same 
tools you have in your DSLR, the good news that there are tons of applications that can 
help you to achieve similar effects.
In this chapter, you will go through a number of the photography techniques that 
you have probably used with a professional digital camera. You will try to create similar 
techniques using different iPhone apps. Remember to read through the steps first and 
then try them with your own photos.

Creating Advanced HDR Photos
Tools used: Snapseed
Figure 3-1 shows the original photo I used for this example. You can work through 
the same steps using your own photo.

Figure 3-2 shows my final result.
The high dynamic range (HDR) effect increases the contrast between the light and 
shadows in your photos by presenting a greater range of luminance levels compared 
to traditional images. This enables you to create photos with dramatic effects. As you 
explored earlier in this book, you can create HDR photos directly from your Camera app 
while taking your shot. However, the iPhone feature is still basic and doesn’t give you full 
control over the effect. For example, you can’t control the density or the style of the HDR 
effect applied.
Figure 3-2.  The final result
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

64
HDR photos are usually created by merging a number of photos with different 
exposure levels to produce a wider range of luminance in the scene. Meanwhile, to 
reach a good result with the HDR effect, the photo needs to include colorful elements 
with high-contrast light and shadows. I took the photo in this tip while I was visiting the 
Louvre Museum in Paris a couple of years ago; I want to give its color more depth and 
drama. So, I used the HDR feature in the Snapseed app.
Step 1: Prepare the Photo
Before applying the HDR effect, you need to make sure that the photo colors are vibrant 
enough and contrasted to get better final results. To increase the brightness, contrast, 
and saturation in the shot, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Snapseed app. Tap Open and open an image on your 
iPhone.
	 2.	 Tap the Tools button on the bottom right, and choose Tune Image. 
Tap the Adjustment icon, and choose Brightness. Drag the  
slider on the top to +20 to increase the brightness of the photo  
(see Figure 3-3).

Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

66
	 5.	 Tap the Apply icon on the bottom right to apply the effect.
	 6.	 Tap the Tools button on the bottom right, and choose White 
Balance. You will give the colors in the photos a warmer effect  
(see Figure 3-5).
	 7.	 Tap the Adjustment icon, and choose Temperature. Set it  
to a warmer level, for example, +10. Tap the Apply icon  
(see Figure 3-­6).
Figure 3-5.  Tap the White Balance setting
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

67
Step 2: Apply the HDR Effect
You should choose an HDR effect that is suitable for the photo you have. Follow these 
steps:
	 1.	 Tap the Tools icon, and choose HDR Scape from Filters.
	 2.	 Choose the Strong mode, and increase its strength to +50  
(see Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-6.  Adding a warm effect by increasing the Temperature setting
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

68
	 3.	 Tap the Adjustment icon, choose Brightness, and set it to be a little 
brighter by dragging the slider to +10.
	 4.	 Tap the Apply icon.
Step 3: Apply the Vignette Effect 
To add more focus to the center of the photo and the glass pyramid, I will add a vignette 
effect to create darker edges for the shot. You can use your own photo to create a similar 
effect. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In the Tools list, choose Vignette. Drag the slider to the left to 
create darker edges in the photo (see Figure 3-8).
	 2.	 Tap the Apply icon.
Figure 3-7.  Applying the HDR Scope effect
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

69
Step 4: Add the Blur Effect
In addition to the vignette effect, you will add a blur effect to increase the focus on the 
center of the photo. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 In the Filters list, choose Lens Blur. Increase the blur strength, for 
example, to +30.
	 2.	 With two fingers, drag to adjust the size and shape of the blur 
applied to the photo. Try to make the blur on the edges only so 
that the center point of the photo is in focus.
	 3.	 Tap the Apply icon (see Figure 3-9).
Figure 3-8.  Applying the vignette effect to the photo
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects

Creating a Shallow Depth of Field
Tools Used: Tadaa
Figure 3-10 shows the original photo I used for this example.
Figure 3-10.  Original image (© Radwa Khalil)
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

72
Figure 3-11 shows my final result.
The term depth of field refers to the focus range in the shot. If the photo’s focused 
area is limited to the near objects while the far elements appear blurry, it is called a 
shallow depth of field. On the other hand, if the focused area includes a large area of the 
photo, it is called a deep depth of field. The depth of field in a DSLR camera is controlled 
by the camera aperture (f-stop), which is related to the diameter of the lens opening, and 
it is represented as a fraction of one (1/F). So, if the lens opening is large, the number 
becomes small, which results in a shallow depth of field.
Figure 3-11.  Final result
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

73
On the iPhone, the aperture control is limited while taking a photo because you are 
only able to tap the object you would like to focus on. Sometimes you need to have more 
control over the shot’s depth of field. In the following example, I took the shot but later 
decided to tweak the depth of field. There are many apps that can help you manually 
apply a shallow depth of field on the photo such as Camera+ and Tadaa.
In the following example, I wanted to give more focus to the near chess pieces while 
blurring the far objects. Also, I wanted to apply darker edges to the photo to focus on the 
main objects in the shot. Find a similar photo to follow along with the example.
Step 1: Protect the Main Objects
Before applying the blur effect, you should protect the main objects in the shot to keep 
them sharp. You can use a mask effect as follows:
	 1.	 Open a photo in the Tadaa app, and tap the Blur icon in the 
bottom toolbar.
	 2.	 Tap the Edit Mask icon at the top.
	 3.	 Zoom in the objects and start to paint a mask over them. Here, I 
painted the pieces near the camera (see Figure 3-12).
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

74
	 4.	 Tap the Apply icon at the top right.
Step 2: Apply the Blur Effect
Now, I will apply the blur effect to the far objects in the shot. You can follow along with 
your own photo.
Figure 3-12.  Applying a mask over the elements near the camera
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

75
	 1.	 Tap the Blur icon. You may need to drag the toolbar right or left to 
reveal the rest of the tools (see Figure 3-13).
	 2.	 Set the blur type to Circular.
	 3.	 Drag with your fingers to resize and position the protected area 
above the near objects in the photo.
Figure 3-13.  Drag the toolbar to reveal the Blur icon
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

76
	 4.	 Drag the Blur slider to increase the blur effect on the far objects. 
The amount of blur varies based on visual distance between the 
near objects and the far objects.
	 5.	 Reduce the Range value to start the blur effect from a proper 
distance from the in-­focus objects (see Figure 3-14).
Figure 3-14.  Apply the blur effect on the far objects in the photo
	 6.	 Tap the Apply icon.
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

77
Step 3: Apply the Vignette Effect
Now, you will darken the edges of the photo to focus on the main objects as follows:
	 1.	 Tap the Vignette icon in the bottom toolbar.
	 2.	 Drag Intensity to the left side to create a proper frame around the photo.
	 3.	 Drag the Range slider to a middle point (see Figure 3-15).
Figure 3-15.  Applying the vignette effect
	 4.	 Tap the Apply icon at the top right.
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

78
Step 4: Apply a Final Filter 
After adding the vignette effect, you will add a filter to the photo to give it a dramatic 
mono color effect, as follows:
	 1.	 Tap the Filter icon, and choose Charleston filter.
	 2.	 Drag the slider under the filter a middle point to soften the effect 
of the filter (see Figure 3-16).

	 3.	 Tap the App icon, and tap the Share icon to save the photo to your 
Camera Roll.
Creating a Low-Light Black-and-White Photo
Tools: Adobe Lightroom app, Adobe Photoshop Mix
Figure 3-17 shows the original photo I used for this example. Choose a similar photo 
to follow along with the example.
Figure 3-17.  The original photo (© Radwa Khalil)
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

80
Figure 3-18 shows my final result.
A low-light effect allows you to create a dramatic effect on a photo by having viewers 
focus on the lit part of the photo. Usually, it works well with portrait photography as it 
emphasizes the facial expressions. To ensure high contrast in a low-light photo, you need 
to consider the following tips:
•	
Take your photo against a dark background, such as solid black. You 
can use a black wall or paper in the background of your object.
•	
Limit the number of objects in the photo to one object or person to 
ensure precise focus and the ability to control the photo’s light and 
dark areas while editing.
•	
Try to use a soft low-light source facing the person or the object in the shot.
•	
Try to use a tripod to ensure a steady shot with your iPhone.
Figure 3-18.  The final result
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

81
In the following example, the photo was taken with a soft light on a black 
background, which makes it suitable for a low-light effect. I used Photoshop Mix to 
improve the white areas using layers and blending modes.
Step 1: Convert a Photo to Black and White
First, bring a photo to the Lightroom app to convert it to black and white and then adjust 
the overall exposure, contrast, light, and shadows.
	 1.	 Open a photo in the Adobe Lightroom app.
	 2.	 Tap the Color icon. Tap the B&W icon on the top left of the menu. 
This will convert the image to black and white.
	 3.	 Set the temperature to +40 and the tint to +45 (see Figure 3-19).

	 4.	 Tap the Apply icon on the bottom right.
	 5.	 Tap the Share icon, and tap Save to Camera Roll.
	 6.	 Set the quality to the maximum available.
Step 3: Improve Highlights 
You might want to improve the highlighted part of the photo to increase its emphasis on 
the face. To do so, you can use Photoshop Mix to set the blending modes, as follows:
	 1.	 Tap the plus icon in Photoshop Mix. Choose Image, and navigate 
to the Camera Roll for the photo you just saved.
	 2.	 Tap once on the layer on the left to open its Properties panel.

Creating High-Key Photos
Tools: Adobe Lightroom app, Photoshop Mix app, Blur app
Figure 3-24 shows my original photo.
Figure 3-24.  Original photo (© Radwa Khalil)
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

87
Figure 3-25 shows my final result.
In contrast to low-light photos, high-key photos reduce the lighting ratio and 
contrast level in a photo to create more natural lighting. The technology was originally 
developed for screens that couldn’t display contrast ratios, but now it is used to create a 
minimal and stylish effect on photos.
To take a good high-key photo, the shot should include a minimal number of objects 
so you can easily modify them using different applications. Try to take the shot in natural 
surroundings with a bright background in order to minimize the shadows in the photo.
Figure 3-25.  Final result

The double exposure, also known as multiple exposures, effect allows you to 
combine two or more photos into single manipulated one. It allows you to merge 
between the photos to display details from each one, using a photo to mask another one. 
Basically, the light and shadows in one image are used to display the details in the other 
image (or images). The technique has become popular in the last few years with the 
dramatic evolution of digital camera capabilities that allow photographers to create the 
double-exposure technique directly in their DSLR cameras.
The double-exposure technique also can be created after the fact using photo-­
editing applications such as Adobe Photoshop, which creates very good results like the 
ones created through a camera. Furthermore, it gives you more control over the effects 
and style used in the final result.
In addition, there are many iPhone apps that can help you take double-exposure 
photos such as Union, MultiExpo, Superimpose, Pic Blender, Pixlr, Fused, and 
Snapseed. In this tip, you will use the Pic Blender app to combine two photos to build 
the double-­exposure effect. To create a good effect, make sure to select a base photo 
with contrasting colors and low details and pick a second one with details such as 
trees, buildings, and so on.
Step 1: Prepare the Base Photo
Before applying the double-exposure effect directly, you will adjust the photo to increase 
the contrast between the light and shadows in the photo.
	 1.	 Open the Pic Bender app, and choose a high-contrasted photo as 
the base one.
	 2.	 Tap the Adjustment icon and then tap the Contrast icon. Drag the 
slider to the right to increase it. This will increase the shadows and 
light areas in the photo and reduce the midtones (see Figure 3-35).
Chapter 3  Working with Photography Projects 

97
Step 2: Combine Photos
Now, you will use one of the photos in the app as a second image to blend with the base 
one. Then, you will modify the second image to fit with the original one.
	 1.	 Tap the Photos icon on the left of the toolbar to add the second 
photo.

Summary 
While the iPhone camera doesn’t include advanced features such as low-light, high-­
light, HDR, and double-exposure effects like a professional DSLR camera does, you 
can still achieve these techniques using the large variety of free and paid apps that you 
can download from the App Store. You can also extend these features by using multiple 
applications to improve the final results. The tips in this chapter covered some of the 
photography effects that you can apply using your iPhone.
Practice Exercise
Start by taking photos that can be used in this chapter’s tips. You can also use photos 
from your iPhone library. Start by applying the effects and practice the different settings 
and styles.

CHAPTER 4
Mastering Photo Editing 
and Applying Effects
In the previous chapter, you learned how to create effects such as HDR photos and 
shallow depths of field. Those tips were just the beginning. You can use apps from the 
Apple App Store to add filters, frames, and styles to your photos. You can also manipulate 
multiple photos to create a specific scene. Each tip in this chapter lists the apps that I 
used; you can use either use the same apps or choose similar ones.

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, a photo collage can 
tell even more. Arranging photos in a collage or a grid allows you to tell a story; it’s a 
great way to show different photos with the same theme to emphasize your point. While 
there are many applications that can help you to create a photo collage, it is important 
to prepare for your project even before taking your shots. Each collage should have a 
theme; in other words, the photos should be related in a specific way. Here are some 
examples:
•	
Color theme collage: In this theme, the photos may vary in subjects 
and location yet they are unified with the same color such as a blue 
sea, blue sky, and blue stones.
•	
Object theme collage: All the photos in this type of collage are 
displaying the same or related objects such as fruits, tree leaves, 
flowers, or people.
•	
Storytelling collage: This collage is used to tell a story or show 
sequenced photos of the same scene. For example, it may include 
kids playing a specific game and show four or more shots of their 
reactions while playing.
In this example, I will show how to organize a series of photos from a food 
photography session into a collage style. You will learn how to modify the colors of the 
photos in the Adobe Lightroom app first and then move to the Moldiv app to create the 
final collage effect.
Step 1: Modify the Photo Colors
In the Lightroom app, you will increase the vibrancy of your photos and increase their 
clarity to align the level of colors in all shots.
	 1.	 In the Adobe Lightroom app, tap the Camera Roll icon, and select

Vintage photos are a great way to evoke a nostalgic feeling when looking at them. 
While you can’t create a vintage effect directly on your DSLR camera, it can be created on 
a desktop computer using photo-editing applications such as Adobe Photoshop. On your 
iPhone, you can create the vintage effect using various apps. Instagram, for example, 
allows you to apply a vintage filter after you take a photo and before sharing it with your 
followers.
In this tip, you will explore how to convert a photo to a vintage style using various 
applications. I used a photo of my daughter that was taken during our last trip to the

Sometimes you need to emphasize an object based on the photo’s composition. This 
can be achieved using different methods such as color. One of the effects that can help 
you to focus on a specific element in the shot is colorizing an object while converting the 
rest of the photo to black and white. In this tip, I have a photo of a King Tut Ankamoun 
poster, and I would like to highlight the mask in the shot.
Unfortunately, the left side of the wall in the photo has very exposed light compared 
to the right side. So, I will show how to use Photoshop Mix to replace the left wall with a

CHAPTER 5
Integrating with Adobe 
Lightroom on the Desktop 
To expand your iPhone’s photography capabilities, you can take the photos you 
have edited on your phone and integrate them with the Adobe Lightroom desktop 
application. One of the advantages of using the Adobe Lightroom mobile app is that it 
allows you to go from your phone to the desktop version of the same application. This 
allows you to continue modifying your photos but on a larger screen, which can help you 
to see more details in a photo.
In this chapter, you will explore how to extend your iPhone’s photography 
capabilities using the integration between the Adobe Lightroom mobile app and desktop 
application. You’ll take photos using the Camera Raw technology.
Rate, Flag, and Organize Photos
Before starting to integrate your files from your phone to the desktop version of Adobe 
Lightroom, you need to organize and filter the images so you can easily identify the best 
shots to use in further photo-editing steps.
The Lightroom app provides a comprehensive way to organize and arrange photos. 
In the Lightroom app on your phone, you can review and rate your photos in order to 
easily identify them for photo-editing projects. You can review the photos in Lightroom 
and rate them as follows:
	 1.	 Open the Lightroom app.
	 2.	 Select an image from the library or from the Camera Roll.
	 3.	 In the top menu, set the mode to Rate & Review.

150
	 4.	 Swipe up and down on the left side of the screen to display the 
rating stars. You can give a rating to a selected image by dragging 
up and down. You can also use the stars at the bottom of the 
image to give it a rating, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1.  Swipe up or down on the left side of the photo to add a rating
Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

151
	 5.	 Swipe up and down on the right side of the screen to open the 
flagging option. This allows you to choose between flagged, 
unflagged, or rejected. Drag up or down to choose between the 
three options. You can also use the flag icon at the bottom right of 
the image to flag the image, as shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-2.  Swipe up or down on the right side of the photo to add a rating
Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

152
Additionally, you can organize photos by giving them titles, captions, and copyright 
information using the Info section.
Once the photos are rated, you can display them in the Lightroom app library 
organized by rating. Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Lightroom app library.
	 2.	 Tap the Lightroom Photos drop-down list.
	 3.	 Select the Segmented tab. This allows you to filter the photos 
based on their ratings, flagging, likes, and comments, as shown in 
Figure 5-3.

	 5.	 Remove the rating filter to display all the photos again.
Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

155
Work with Collections
Adobe Lightroom also allows you to organize the photos into collections. For instance, you can  
group all the related photos in one easily accessed collection. When you open the Lightroom 
app, can view either all the collections or the specific collection. If you can’t see all the collections, 
simply tap the Back arrow at the top of the screen to get back to the Collections view.
You can create a new collection by tapping the plus icon at the top right of the screen.

Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

158
Take Raw Photos in Lightroom
The common photo formats that you probably use every day such as JPG, PNG, and 
GIF are called processed formats, which means the camera processor combines the 
information related to the photo, such as the colors, exposure, and white balance, 
with the photo’s grayscale data to produce the final image. While there are a variety 
of applications and tools that can help you edit processed photos, the capabilities are 
limited because of the processing that takes place on the images.
Unlike those formats, the Camera Raw technology maintains the picture 
unprocessed, which means when you take the photo using your camera or iPhone, the 
grayscale information of the image is saved separated from the image information. This 
information is known as the metadata XML file. This technology helps you extend your 
editing capabilities because you can simply change the metadata of the image instead of 
the image itself. This means you can modify an image multiple times.
The Camera Raw technology is available in many cameras, and each brand has its 
own Camera Raw format. However, DNG is a universal format that works on multiple 
devices and with Camera Raw plug-ins. iPhone supports the Camera Raw format via the 
Lightroom app.
Note that Camera Raw images have a very large size; they can fill up your phone’s 
storage space. So, try to use this feature carefully and with a selected number of images. 
You can activate this option only when needed. In the Lightroom app, you can take 
photos in DNG Camera Raw format as follows:
	 1.	 Open the Lightroom app.
	 2.	 Log in with your Adobe ID.
	 3.	 Tap the camera icon at the bottom right of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 5-8.

Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

161
After setting up the photo format, Lightroom gives you three modes to take the photo, 
which are Automatic, Professional, and High Dynamic Range, as shown in Figure 5-10. The 
Automatic mode allows you to take quick Camera Raw photos without worrying about the 
different camera settings. Professional mode lets you control the image properties including 
the shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. When choosing the third method, High Dynamic Range 
(HDR), you can tap and hold to have the phone take photos with multiple exposure values. 
Then, the phone processes all the photos to create an HDR photo effect automatically.
Figure 5-10.  The Professional photography mode in the Lightroom app
Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

162
In the following steps, you will explore how to take a Camera Raw photo using the 
Professional mode:
	 1.	 From the options on the left of the shutter button, set the mode to 
Professional.
	 2.	 Use the Exposure value to change how the photo exposes to light. 
A higher exposure value means more light in the photo, while a 
lower value means a low-light photo.
	 3.	 The shutter speed (Sec) lets you determine the speed of opening 
and closing the camera shutter. A high shutter speed means less 
light and a more stable shot; it is suitable for moving shots such 
as kids playing. A low shutter speed means more light and less 
stability; it is suitable for taking still photos or nature photos. 
However, it is advised that you to use a tripod to ensure a steady 
shot. If you are not sure about the best shutter speed for you, you 
can just set it to Auto by dragging the slider to the far left.
	 4.	 The ISO value determines the sensitivity for the light. High ISO 
means high sensitivity to light; however, it can cause “noise” in the 
image. Therefore, it is advised not to use a very high ISO value.
	 5.	 The white balance (WB) lets you choose between different white 
balances such as Tungsten, Fluorescent, Daylight, and Cloudy.
	 6.	 The Focus value lets you determine the field of focus in the photo. 
A low value represents a shallow depth of field. It displays the near 
objects in focus while the far objects look blurry. A high value 
creates a clear scene without my blurry effects.

Integrate Files with Lightroom on the Desktop 
One of the major advantages of using the Lightroom app on your iPhone to take and edit 
photos is the ability to integrate your photos with the desktop version of the application. 
Through this integration, you can take photos using your phone, edit them, and then 
transfer them to the desktop app for more advanced modifications and editing features. 
There are two main ways to integrate photos between the Lightroom app on the iPhone 
and the desktop version: by using cloud storage and by importing the photos from the 
mobile app.
Integrate Photos Through the Cloud
This method allows you to sync between the Lightroom app on your phone and the 
desktop application through an Adobe Creative Cloud membership. If you are doing 
photography projects and photo editing, you can sign up for the photography Creative 
Cloud membership, which allows you to use the photo-editing desktop applications 
such as Lightroom and Photoshop in addition to the mobile apps.
Once your phone’s photos are synced, they will be available from Adobe Lightroom 
on the desktop, including all the modifications applied to the images.
	 1.	 Open the Lightroom app on your phone, and log in with your 
Adobe ID.
	 2.	 From the Lightroom library, tap the cloud icon at the top left. This 
will sync all the photos through the cloud.

Chapter 5  Integrating with Adobe Lightroom on the Desktop 

168
Note  To use the sync feature, you need to have Adobe Lightroom CC or a later 
version installed on your computer.
Import Photos from Your iPhone
Sometimes you have photos that are saved in your phone’s photo albums rather than 
the Lightroom app itself. These photos may be taken or modified using other mobile 
apps. In this case, you can import the photos directly to the Lightroom application on 
your computer by linking the photo and the computer using a USB cable. This method 
is also helpful if you’re not subscribed to any of the Adobe Creative Cloud memberships 
because this feature can work with the free Adobe ID without the need to pay for any 
membership packages.

Use Other Raw Photo Apps
Adobe Lightroom is not the only mobile app that allows you to take Camera Raw 
photos. The RAW app by 500px is a free application that you can download and use to 
take Raw photos; you can also modify these photos and upload them to your profile on 
www.500px.com, a social network for photographers to showcase their photography work. 
You can save the photos in your iPhone’s Camera Roll for further modifications. To take 
Raw photos using the RAW app, you can follow these steps:
	 1.	 Install the RAW app from the App Store.
	 2.	 Log in using your 500px free account.
	 3.	 Drag the left slider next to the shutter button to the right side to 
activate advanced mode. In this mode, you can use the left slider 
to control the depth of field in the photo. The right slider allows 
you to modify the exposure of the photo, as shown in Figure 5-17.

Summary
You can extend your iPhone photography skills by taking Camera Raw photos, which 
are unprocessed images that maximize your ability to modify the photos after taking 
them. This can help you to create professional photos even if the circumstances you 
took the photos in were not helpful (such as bad light conditions). You can also extend 
your photography skills by integrating your mobile apps with their desktop photography 
versions to be able to reach more advanced features.
Adobe Lightroom is one of the top photography and photo-editing applications for 
photographers. It can help you take photos using your iPhone and then integrate them 
with its desktop version so you can apply more accurate and intensive photo-editing 
techniques. This can help you to produce professional photo results.
In addition to the Lightroom app, there are other applications that can help you to 
take Camera Raw images such as the RAW app provided by 500px. It allows you to take 
Raw photos, modify them, and save them on the iPhone in the Camera Raw format. You 
can also share the photos through your profile on the 500px web site.
Practice Exercise
For this exercise, take some photos using the Camera Raw technology via the Lightroom 
app or any Raw-supporting app. Then use this app to modify your photos, share them to 
the Facebook group, and discuss the results with your peers.

CHAPTER 6
Integrating Your Photos 
with Adobe Photoshop 
on the Desktop
As you learned in the previous chapter, integrating your photo-editing tasks between 
your iPhone and your computer helps you create even better photos. You can use the 
computer’s full-featured photo-editing applications such as Photoshop and Lightroom 
to enhance and manipulate your photos. When you send the photo from your Adobe 
mobile app to the desktop application, you can preserve the layers, effects, and 
adjustments.
Prepare Your iPhone for Integration
To integrate between the Adobe apps on your iPhone and the desktop versions, you 
need to be signed in to the Creative Cloud from the app. This will allow you to share files 
with your computer through the Creative Cloud. In fact, you can integrate all the Adobe 
mobile apps through the Creative Cloud. These steps show you how to connect to the 
cloud from the Lightroom app:
	 1.	 Open the Adobe Lightroom app. If you are not signed in, you will 
see a “Sign in” button; tap it.
	 2.	 On the “Sign in” screen, enter your Adobe ID username and 
password, and tap “Sign in” (see Figure 6-1).

176

	 3.	 Click the Lightroom logo icon at the top left to open the app menu 
(see Figure 6-2).
Figure 6-2.  Creative Cloud sync settings
Chapter 6  Integrating Your Photos with Adobe Photoshop on the Desktop

178
	 4.	 Activate Sync Only Over Wi-Fi to avoid draining your mobile 
Internet data and keep the syncing only when you have access to a 
Wi-Fi connection.
	 5.	 Deactivate Prevent from Sleep to allow your phone to go to sleep 
while doing the sync. This can save the battery.
	 6.	 Activate Load Full Resolution to use the highest resolution 
possible for photos.
	 7.	 Activate Auto Add Photos to sync photos automatically.
	 8.	 Deactivate Auto Add Videos to avoid syncing videos.
To review the synced documents, you need the Adobe Creative Cloud app installed 
on both your iPhone and your computer. When you log into your cloud app from 
your iPhone, you will be able to check the synced documents based on their type (see 
Figure 6-3).
Chapter 6  Integrating Your Photos with Adobe Photoshop on the Desktop

179

On your desktop computer, the Creative Cloud console allows you to view the cloud 
documents, find applications to download, find fonts, and see your follower updates 
(Community). You can also access the documents you saved from your iPhone to the 
cloud storage as follows:
	 1.	 Open the Creative Cloud console. If it is not downloaded, you can 
download it from Adobe.com.
	 2.	 Click the Assets tab and then choose Files. Here, you can learn 
about your storage, the type of subscription (either free or paid), 
and the file update status.
	 3.	 Click Open Folder to open the local folder where you can find the 
synced files from your iPhone (see Figure 6-4).

Integrate Files with Desktop Photoshop
Once you log into the iPhone Adobe apps and prepare to sync photos between the 
app and desktop applications, you can send the files from these apps to the desktop 
version, where they are synced in the cloud. Then the files will be opened automatically 
in the associated application. In the following example, you will send a document from 
the Photoshop Fix app to Photoshop on the desktop and explore how the sent file has 
preserved its structure:
	 1.	 Make sure that the Creative Cloud console app is installed on the 
desktop computer and that both the computer and the iPhone are 
connected to the Internet.
	 2.	 Open the Photoshop Fix app on the iPhone.
	 3.	 Select one of the existing projects or create a new one. Make sure 
that the file is optimized and doesn’t have any unwanted layers 
to avoid slow syncing between the app and the desktop version of 
Photoshop (see Figure 6-5).

CHAPTER 7
Turning Photos into  
Fine Art
Both photography and fine art are considered art. While photography depends on the 
camera to create the visual artwork, fine art uses different tools such as brushes, drawing 
pens, pastels, and others. Digital applications can help you to simulate the effect of 
the fine art tools and apply them to your photos to create what looks like a painting or 
drawing. There are many apps that help you create fine art effects on the iPhone, and you 
can even use multiple apps to improve the final result of your art piece.
The tips in this chapter show how to turn some of your iPhone photos into fine art 
pieces.

198
Create Pop Artwork
Tools used: Prisma app, Lightroom app
Figure 7-1 shows the original photo that I used in this example. You can use a similar 
photo to follow along with the exercise.

Chapter 7  Turning Photos into Fine Art 

199
Figure 7-2 shows the final result.
In this example, I have a photo of some urban architecture that I want to convert to 
“pop” artwork. To do this, first you open a photo in the Lightroom app to modify its color 
to be more vibrant and contrasted. Then, you open it in the Prisma app to apply the 
artwork. Since there is not much control over the colors in the Prisma app, you can take 
the artwork back to Lightroom to modify the color combination.

The oil painting has an amazing artistic effect, especially with how the brush adds 
the “paint” on the canvas to form the whole picture. Actually, there are many apps that 
can help you create artistic effects to look like oil paintings. In this tip, you will learn 
how to apply the oil painting effect to a photo of an old car. Then, you will apply color 
gradients over the photo to give it a more impressionist feel.
Specifically, I will show how to modify the photo in Lightroom to give it more vibrant 
colors so the applied painting effect uses the bright colors in the photo. Then, I will show 
how to use the Glaze app to apply the effect on the photo. After applying the effect, the 
photo will be returned to the Lightroom app to apply a selective mask effect on some 
parts of the photo to give it more artistic colors.

Add a Foggy Winter to Your Photo
Tools used: Tadaa app, Repix app
In this example, I wanted to convert a photo into a hyper-realistic painting. So, I 
picked a photo that I took in Paris a few years ago with my iPhone and will show how 
to add a foggy effect to it. I used the Tadaa app or any app that can create blur effect 
to add the fog to the window. Then, I used the Repix app to add small water drops on 
the window. The final effect should seem like you are looking at a building through a 
window that is covered by fog and mist drops.

Summary
Fine art has a special look, especially with the brush touches and expressive colors. You 
can easily convert your photo into a piece of artwork by applying different effects to look 
like oil painting, watercolor, and others. All you need to do is to find the proper app that 
can help simulate the touch of the brush or the effect you want to achieve. Apps such 
as Deep Art Effect, Photo Splash, and Glaze can help you turn your photos into fine art 
pieces. Using techniques from more than one app can produce even more interesting 
results. In these tips, I depended on the Lightroom app to adjust the color and light 
in the photos and Photoshop Fix to remove the unwanted elements in the shot before 
applying any effect.
Practice Exercise
To practice the tips in this chapter, you can use any photo of your choice that you would 
like to convert into fine art. Then, decide which effect you want to apply. Use the tips as 
a guide to reach the same effects as in this chapter and explore what other fine art results 
you can produce.

CHAPTER 8
Photo Manipulation 
Projects
In addition to editing photos on your iPhone, you can also create larger projects that 
involve multiple apps. The most challenging part is to come up with an idea and 
visualize the creative artwork that you will create on your iPhone. Then, you need to 
select other photos that can be merged with the original to form the final composition. 
The number of apps you use depends on the effect you want to create. I like to build the 
composition in one app such as Photoshop Mix and use other apps to apply filters and 
effects on the shot.
In this chapter, you will explore the workflow of merging photos together to create a 
mystic scene. You’ll take elements from different photos and use the blending mode to 
mix between the colors to create your digital art.
Create a Fantasy Scene

In this project, I will show how to merge a number of photos to create a fantasy scene 
of kids playing on a strange planet. So, I will start with a photo I took on my iPhone of 
my kids on a beach and a photo of the sunset and merge them with an Earth photo that 
I saved from the Internet to my iPhone. This is the only time I’m using a photo that was 
not taken using an iPhone because of the nature of the photo I want to create. The photo 
was grabbed from Wikipedia under the copyright of public domain.

You can combine multiple photos to create mystic and unnatural compositions. 
While the photo manipulation on a computer may be done using one application such 
as Adobe Photoshop, on the iPhone, you are likely to use more than one app to create the 
effect you need.
During my trip to the pyramids, I took some photos of the grand pyramid of Khufu. 
To create a mystic composition, I used three photos to build the composition. I started by 
improving the shot color and light and then created a duplicated one with a transparent 
background to represent the pyramid reflection from the sky. Then, I added a mystic 
blue sky to cover the shot.
Step 1: Optimize the Photo Color and Light
To optimize the photo color and light, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the pyramid photo in Adobe Lightroom.
	 2.	 Tap the Share icon, choose Edit In, and select Maximum available. 
Choose Healing in Photoshop Fix to remove the car from the 
photo (see Figure 8-21).

Summary 
In this chapter, you explored how to combine photos to create magical scenes. The tips 
provided a number of examples of how to use applications to apply filters, add frames, 
and manipulate between photos. You can use different apps to apply the steps in this 
chapter to your own photos and adjust the settings according to the nature of your shot.
Practice Exercise
Start by thinking of a photo that can you can use to build a mystic or dramatic effect. 
Then, prepare the photos to fit with your idea. For example, remove the background and 
adjust the colors. Once done, you can build the composition in a layer-based application 
such as Photoshop Mix and Photofox.

CHAPTER 9
Shooting and Editing 
Video
When you want to record movement and sound, you can use your iPhone to capture 
video footage. With the proper tools, you can even extend this capability. Similar to 
photography and photo editing, there are numerous apps that can help you take, edit, 
and apply video effects. These apps allow you to make basic video modifications  
(as advanced video effects require) a special software and hardware setup.
Shoot and Trim Videos
Tools used: Camera app, Photos app
In this section, you will learn about the following:
•	
Different types of video shooting using the Camera app
•	
Taking still photos while shooting video
•	
Trimming videos using the Photos app
The Camera app allows you to take different types of video via different modes, 
including normal video (Video), slow motion (Slo-Mo), and high-speed video (Time-­
lapse). After taking the video, you can crop out any unwanted footage at the beginning or 
end using the Photos app’s editing features.

260
Set Up the Video Quality
By default, the iPhone isn’t set up to take videos with the highest quality (4K) because 
this can dramatically consume your storage space. Every minute of 4K video takes 
about 350MB of your storage, and 1080p HD video at the 60 frames per second (fps). In 
addition, high-quality video can slow down your editing speed comparing to editing 
lower-quality video, so you need to pick the video quality that best meets your needs.
	 1.	 Open Settings ➤ Photos & Camera.
	 2.	 In the Camera section, you can set the quality of the Record Video 
and Record Slo-Mo features. In each section, you can find a guide 
to the amount of storage that will be consumed with each one 
minute of recording (see Figure 9-1).
Chapter 9  Shooting and Editing Video

262
Take Still Photos While Shooting Videos
Sometimes you want to take a still photo of a scene while you are shooting video footage. 
This feature is available in two modes: Video and Slo-Mo.
	 1.	 Open the Camera app, and select the Video mode.
	 2.	 Press the home button or one of the volume keys to start the video.
	 3.	 Tap the white button on the top left of the screen to take a still 
photo while shooting your video (see Figure 9-2).
	 4.	 Press the home button again to stop the recording.
	 5.	 Tap the preview next to the home button to preview the video and 
still photos.

Create a Hyperlapse Video
Tools used: OSnap
In this section, you will learn about the following:
•	
Creating a hyperlapse project
•	
Shooting a hyperlapse video
•	
Applying soundtracks to video
Hyperlapse is a time-lapse technique that lets you create video frames by taking a 
single photo and organizing them together to create a motion sequence. While you can 
create time-lapse video using the Camera app by switching to the Time-lapse mode, you 
don’t have control over the speed of the motion or the frames in it. Using hyperlapse 
apps such as OSnap, you can convert a sequence of photos to a hyperlapse or time-lapse 
video. Then, you can have control over the speed of the video and the frames included 
in it.
Step 1: Create a Hyperlapse Project
To create a hyperlapse project, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Osnap app, tap the plus icon, and choose New Project.
	 2.	 In the New Project dialog box, set up the project name, the 
orientation, and the camera. Then tap Create (see Figure 9-4).

•	
Cropping parts from the middle of the video footage
•	
Applying transition between video sections
•	
Converting a video to black and white
•	
Applying filters to video
•	
Adding audio tracks to video
Although the Photos app doesn’t enable you to apply modifications to the video 
other than removing footage at the beginning or end, there are apps that can fill this 
gap. You can use apps such as iMovie, Adobe Premier Clip, and others to extend your 
phone’s video abilities. In this tip, I had a video of the Louvre Museum where there are 
two people in front of the camera. So, I want to remove them, apply a transition between 
the different parts of the video, and apply a black and white filter that makes the video 
look old.

Summary
You don’t need an expensive video camcorder to take HD videos or complex software to 
edit your videos anymore. The iPhone allows you to take videos with different qualities 
based on your needs. Although the Photos app doesn’t include many video-editing tools 
compared with its still photo-editing tools, such as cropping, color adjustment, and light 
adjustment, you can use different apps to edit your videos, apply effects, and add audio 
to them. While some apps give you full editing capabilities such as iMovie and Adobe 
Clip, other apps give you basic custom effects to apply directly to a video such as Video 
Toolbox. Therefore, you need to choose the app that fits well with your needs.
Practice Exercise
Think of a hyperlapse project idea, such as taking a sequence of photos of a playing 
kid and turn it into a time-lapse video. You can use the OSnap app for this. Then, use 
applications such as iMovie or Clipper to add filters and audio to the video.

CHAPTER 10
Storing Your Photos
When it comes to working with photos and video, running out of storage is one of my 
worst fears. It’s a tough spot to be in because taking photos in the high-quality HDR or 
Raw format can quickly eat up the storage space of your device because of the large file 
sizes used. When taking photos, I usually like to take a number of shots from different 
angles and zoom levels, which helps when editing the photos later or deciding to use 
them in photo manipulation artwork. That can also take up space on the iPhone.
Unlike other mobile phones, the iPhone doesn’t have the option to add a memory 
card to extend its storage capabilities. Therefore, you need a good plan to ensure that 
your device always has space for your next shots. This can be achieved by managing your 
storage and taking advantage of the different cloud services such as iCloud, Dropbox, 
Google Drive, and others. The tips in this chapter aim to explore the different hacks that 
you can use to manage iPhone storage.
Manage Your iPhone Storage
The first step to managing your overall storage is to make sure that you only keep what 
you what on your device and leave enough space for your photos. While removing 
unnecessary apps from your device can help you save space, this may not be enough of 
a solution, especially when you work with different photo-editing apps and need to have 
the frequently used apps installed on your device. Therefore, you can change the settings 
of your device to ensure that you save only the necessary documents and photos. By 

288
default, the settings on your iPhone are not configured to aggressively save the space on 
your device; actually, some settings should be switched as soon as you get your device 
to ensure that space is consumed for only the important things. The following are some 
of the things that you can do to help to empty the iPhone storage space for your next 
photography project.
Don’t Duplicate Saved Photos
When taking HDR photos, you may notice that the iPhone keeps a copy of the original 
shot before converting it to an HDR photo. While this is meant to save your original shot, 
you don’t need to have a duplicated version of each photo. Therefore, you can choose to 
stop this duplicate copy and use this setting only when needed. To control this feature, 
follow these steps (see Figure 10-1):
	 1.	 Open Settings ➤ Photo & Camera.
	 2.	 Scroll down to Keep Normal Photo and untick the toggle next to it.
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

289

Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

290
Some applications such as the Instagram have a similar feature that duplicates 
photos. You can switch it off by opening the Instagram app, choosing the Profile tab, and 
selecting the Settings icon. Then, you can deselect Save Original Photos.
Stop Storing the Text Message History
By default, iPhone stores all your sent and received messages forever. Obviously, this will 
consume space over time, especially if you send a lot of text message. You probably don’t 
need those old messages, so you can limit the storage for messages to a specific amount 
of time and let the device delete the old ones (see Figure 10-2). Follow these steps:
	 1.	 Choose Setting ➤ Messages ➤ Messages History ➤ Keep 
Messages.
	 2.	 Set the time to 1 Year if you want to keep messages for that long, or 
set the time to 30 Days if you are fine with a shorter period.
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

292
Delete Downloaded Podcasts and Music
Downloaded podcasts and music can consume a lot of your iPhone’s space because of their 
size. Sometimes you download a music track because it sounds interesting but then should 
remove it from your device. Keeping only the tracks that you frequently listen to can help you 
free some of your device space. You can do this by following these steps (see Figure 10-3):
	 1.	 Tap Settings ➤ General ➤ Storage & iCloud Usage ➤ Manage Storage.
	 2.	 Scroll down to the Music app. You can delete individual songs or 
all of them by swiping on All Songs.
Figure 10-3.  Deleting the unwanted music
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

293
Unlike with music, you usually listen to a podcast only once and don’t need to retain 
each one. Therefore, it is good advice here to remove the downloaded podcasts to free 
some of the space on the iPhone. You can manually remove the unwanted podcasts  
(see Figure 10-4).
	 1.	 Tap Settings  General ➤ Storage & iCloud Usage ➤ Manage 
Storage.
	 2.	 Scroll down to Podcasts and start deleting them one by one.

Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

294
Remove the Browser History and Reading List
If you use Safari on your iPhone frequently to navigate the Internet and save pages in 
your reading list, you may notice that the browsing history and the saved reading list 
cache consume part of your storage space. You can remove the Safari’s browser cache by 
opening Settings ➤ Safari and tapping Clear History and Website Data.
The reading list can take up some other unnecessary space because Safari keeps 
an offline reading list. Removing this offline reading list doesn’t affect the items in the 
reading list on your iPhone or other devices. So, it can be a good way to free some more 
space.
	 1.	 Tap General ➤ Storage & iCloud Usage ➤ Storage.
	 2.	 Scroll down and tap Safari.
	 3.	 Swipe left over the Offline Reading List item, and tap Delete to 
clear the cache (see Figure 10-5).
	 4.	 Tap Website Data, scroll down, and tap Remove All Website Data.

296
Save and Manage Photos Using iCloud
The world is now shifting to cloud solutions and ditching the traditional local storage 
memory cards and hard drives. Cloud solutions give you flexible storage and reachability 
because you can access your resources from any device. You can use the iCloud service 
to store your photos and important documents, which frees up some space on your 
device. It also allows you to access your resources from your other devices such as an 
iPad, a Mac computer, or a Windows PC.
Activate Saving Photos to iCloud
When joining iCloud, you get a 5GB free plan to store your information. Obviously, this 
is not enough space to store files, especially if you are using multiple devices. Therefore, 
you need to decide which application is able to save files to the iCloud. You can activate 
saving photos to iCloud, as follows (see Figure 10-6):
	 1.	 Tap Settings ➤ Photos & Camera.
	 2.	 Swipe next to iCloud Photo Library to toggle it on.
	 3.	 Choose Optimize iPhone Storage to automatically manage your 
photo storage. Instead of keeping the originals on your device, the 
original photos are saved on iCloud instead.
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

297

Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

298
Manage iCloud Storage and Apps
You can review your iCloud status directly from your iPhone to see the available space 
and the applications that are allowed to save documents to iCloud (see Figure 10-7).
	 1.	 In the Settings app, tap your Apple ID name, and tap iCloud to 
view the storage status.
	 2.	 Scroll down to review the applications that are allowed to use iCloud.
Figure 10-7.  Allow or disallow apps from using iCloud
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

299
If you decided to switch off the sync process between one of the apps and the iCloud, 
you may notice a message that tells you that the documents associated with this specific 
app will be removed from iCloud storage.
You can also access iCloud using a web browser to see the different applications in 
the cloud and access the Photos storage area. Once you activate the iCloud Photo Library 
from the Photos app settings, you can see the photos uploaded to iCloud and manage 
them by adding photos, deleting photos, or organizing them into folders (see Figure 10-­8). 
To access iCloud from your browser, you can follow these steps:
	 1.	 In your browser, type www.icloud.com.
	 2.	 Log in using your Apple ID and password.
	 3.	 Select photos from the Dashboard.
Figure 10-8.  Managing the iCloud service using a web browser
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

300
On the left side, you can find the different folders that your iPhone uses and navigate 
to the uploaded photos. From the top right icons, you can upload photos, create new 
folders, share photos, download photos, or delete them.
Use Other Cloud Services
iCloud is not the only cloud service you can use to store photos and documents from 
your iPhone. Although the iPhone is highly integrated with iOS, there are other services 
that you can download and use such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and One Drive. All these 
services provide a free plan where you can enjoy free storage. For example, Dropbox 
provides 2GB of free storage before you need to upgrade. If you invite others to use 
the app, you get extra space as a reward. Google Drive provides the largest free storage 
space; it gives you 17GB. Additionally, it lets you create documents and photos using 
different apps such as Google Docs and Google Slides and save them to Google Drive 
automatically.
If you are not sure if the iCloud free space could save all your photos, you can use any 
of the other cloud services to save your photos by simply uploading photos to the cloud 
using these apps (see Figure 10-9). Dropbox gives you the ability to upload your camera 
photos to its storage, as follows:
	 1.	 Open the Dropbox app, and log in with your username and 
password.
	 2.	 Tap the top-left Settings icon.
	 3.	 Tap Camera Uploads and swipe the toggle to On. This will upload 
the photos to the Camera Uploads folder on Dropbox.
	 4.	 Toggle the Upload Video item to upload the videos in the same 
folder.
	 5.	 Make sure that Use Cellular Data is off to allow you to upload 
through a Wi-Fi connection only.
	 6.	 Toggle Background Uploading to On and then choose Enable. This 
will let Dropbox upload photos when you move from one place to 
another.

Sync Raw Files Using the Lightroom App
You may notice that the photos taken or modified inside the Adobe Lightroom app are 
saved by default in a separate location other than the Camera Roll, with the ability to 
share the images with the Camera Roll. These saved photos preserve the editing applied 
to them inside the Lightroom app so you can open them again and modify or change 
the effects applied. You can also take Raw photos using the Lightroom app if you want 
unprocessed photos that can give you a lot editing capabilities. However, saving the Raw 
file and the file modifications can consume a huge portion of your iPhone space due to 
the large file size of these photos.
Adobe Lightroom provides cloud storage for Adobe Creative Cloud members; you 
can save photos from both your desktop and mobile applications to the Adobe cloud 
services. The free subscription gives you 2GB of free storage, while the paid membership 
gives you 20GB of storage. You can activate the Adobe Creative Cloud in your Adobe 
Lightroom app by simply logging into your account from the app. It will automatically 
upload the photos in the Lightroom library and update the modifications applied to any 
of the photos.
You can sync the photos from the Lightroom app library and the Adobe cloud service 
as follows (see Figure 10-10):
	 1.	 Open the Lightroom app on your iPhone.
	 2.	 Tap the Cloud icon on the top left, and sign in with your Adobe ID 
and password.
	 3.	 Tap the icon to sync the photos with the online storage.

You can also manage the photos on the online cloud storage through your browser as 
follows (see Figure 10-11):
	 1.	 In your browser, go to https://lightroom.adobe.com/.
	 2.	 Log in with your Adobe ID and password.
	 3.	 Click the Add Photos icon to add photos from your computer to 
the cloud.
	 4.	 Click the Select icon on the photo to delete, share, or change the 
location.
Sync Files with Your Computer
Many people love a big screen; I know it helps me to see the details of a photo and pick 
out the little issues that need to be fixed. You can sync photos from your iPhone to your 
computer to modify, store, or share with others. Also, you can sync between your Photos 
folder on your computer and your iPhone to be able to have a copy of your photos and 
special memories on your phone.
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

305
Import iPhone Photos to Your Computer
You can easily import iPhone photos to your computer using the Photos app on a Mac 
and a USB cable to connect your device to the computer. Once it’s connected, you may 
receive a message to ask you if you trust the computer to connect with your device. 
Once you accept that setting, you will be able to see the iPhone photos listed in the left 
navigation pane.
You can import the photos from your iPhone to the Photos app on a Mac computer 
as follows (see Figure 10-12):
	 1.	 Open the Photos app on your Mac computer.
	 2.	 Select the iPhone in the left Import pane.
	 3.	 Select the photos you want to import.
	 4.	 From the top control bar, choose either Import All New Items or 
Import Selected. You can select Delete Items After Importing to 
remove the original photos to save space.
Figure 10-12.  Importing iPhone photos using a Mac’s Photos app
Chapter 10  Storing Your Photos

306
If you are using a Windows PC, you can import the photos by simply plugging in the 
iPhone to the computer and waiting for the AutoPlay window to open; then choose to 
import photos. You can also use applications such as AnyTrans.
When you import the photos, they are saved inside the Photos app folder where 
you can share, adjust, or make them favorites from inside the app. To save the photos in 
the Finder to be able to open them in photo-editing applications such as Photoshop or 
Lightroom, you need to export them as follows (see Figure 10-13):
	 1.	 Select the photo you need to export.
	 2.	 Choose File ➤ Export ➤ Export Photo.
	 3.	 In the Export dialog box, choose the export format, color profile, 
and size; click Export.
	 4.	 Save the photo to your local machine.

Sync Photos from the Computer to Your iPhone
You can easily sync the photos you have on your computer and your iPhone using 
the iTunes app, which is available on both Mac and Windows. This can help you sync 
photos, music, books, apps, and podcasts. To sync the photos, you can follow these steps 
(see Figure 10-14):
	 1.	 Open the iTunes app.
	 2.	 Click the iPhone icon at the top left.
	 3.	 In the Settings section, click Photos.
	 4.	 Select the Sync Photos check box.
	 5.	 In “Copy Photos from,” select the folder of the photos you would 
like to sync.
	 6.	 Choose to sync either all the folders or selected folder.
	 7.	 Click Apply at the bottom right.

Summary
While the iPhone storage space may not help you to save an endless number of photos 
and projects, cloud technology helps you overcome this barrier by giving you the chance 
to save photos in different cloud services such as iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, One 
Drive, and Adobe Cloud. You can use these services to efficiently manage the space on 
your device to make sure you are not out of space when taking the next shot. You can 
either use the free version of different applications to get a small amount of storage 
space or subscribe to one service to get enough storage for all your projects. You can 
also save photos on your computer by importing them using the Photos app on a Mac or 
applications such as AnyTrans on Windows.
Practice Exercise
Use the techniques in this chapter to reduce the consumed storage space on your device. 
Download one or more of the cloud service applications and use it to save your photos. 
Notice how much space you can free up on your device.

CHAPTER 11
Photo Editing for Social 
Networks
Social networks play an essential part not only in your own Internet social life but in 
the photography profession. Many photographers depend on their social profiles on 
Facebook, Instagram, 500px, Pinterest, and other platforms to present and promote their 
work. This helps their work get seen by a massive number of visitors to these networks 
every day. Your iPhone makes it easy to share your work on these networks. All you need 
is to take the shot, edit it if needed, and upload it directly from any photo-editing app.
Online tools such as Adobe Spark also provide features and tools that can help you 
edit photos. You can use their tools to create dynamic photo projects and show your 
work to your clients, as you will explore in this chapter’s tips.
Create an Attractive Photo Presentation with Adobe 
Spark
Tools used: Adobe Spark Page
Adobe Spark is a group of mobile apps that help you create different social content 
with your photos. Adobe Spark Page helps you create dynamic pages that can include 
photos, videos, and text, and then you can share them your clients. Spark Video allows 
you to merge a number of videos and add text transitions between them. The Smart Post 
feature lets you edit photos and add text to them to create eye-catching social posts.
The photos and text you create with Spark Page can be accessed either through a 
desktop computer or mobile device. In the following steps, I will show how to create a 
Spark page for my trip to Paris. Follow along with your own photos.

Create Instagram Grid Photos
Tools used: Pic Splitter, Moldiv
If you’re a photography buff, you’ve probably used Instagram. You can use Instagram 
to split a photo into multiple parts and post them on Instagram in a grid or as separate 
posts.
You can use the grid feature to split panorama photos so that they fit onto some 
social networks that have limitations on the viewable size of photos. For example, 
uploading a panorama photo (nonsquare size) to Instagram may affect how the photo is 
viewed. In the following example, I will use a photo of a street in Paris; I will show how to 
split it into multiple photos, apply a filter to them, and post them to Instagram as a grid 
of posts.
Step 1: Split a Photo into Multiple Parts
To split a photo into multiple parts, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Pic Splitter app.
	 2.	 Tap the Load Image icon in the top bar, and select an image from 
the Camera Roll.
	 3.	 At the bottom, select the first grid, which splits the photos into 
nine parts (see Figure 11-7).
	 4.	 Tap Save Tiles to save the images to the Camera Roll.

Step 3: Share the Photos
To share the photos, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open Instagram and start by posting the photos starting from the 
bottom left to the top right to fit with the layout of the Instagram 
profile. So, the photos will be displayed in the form of a grid  
(see Figure 11-9).

Turn Photos into Social Branding Images
Building powerful social profiles requires an attractive look for your pages or portfolios. 
As you take photos and modify them using your iPhone, you’ll want to manage the 
layout of your different social profiles and display your photos on them in attractive 
ways. However, it is hard to manage the different standard sizes related to each profile 
such as the banner image size. A handy app that can help you take your photos to 
another level is Canva.
Canva is a web-based photo-editing and template creator application with a mobile 
app that you can use on your iPhone to access all the web features. Canva allows you to 
create and edit photos for use on different social networks for promotion and branding 
purposes. For example, you can use it to create posts, posters, and business cards using 
your photos. Canva is helpful especially when you don’t have design experience to set up 
the size of the banner, choose the right font, or add a special effect. In the following steps, 
I will use Canva app to convert one of my photos to a Facebook banner for my page. 
Then, I will use it to create a business card that can be printed and given to clients.

Summary
Not only does your iPhone allow you to take great shots, but it also helps you share 
them through different social networks. You can even use apps on your iPhone to 
integrate your photos with the different social networks you are on. For example, you 
can use the Instagram layout to display photos on a grid view, display your photos in a 
presentation mode using Spark Pages, or turn them into a creative Facebook banner for 
your Facebook page. The tips in this chapter covered different apps that can help you 
integrate your photos with social network profiles.
Practice Exercise
Start by selecting a project that includes a number of photos for a specific theme or 
location. Then, build a presentation with a description. You can use Spark Page to create 
this presentation and share it with your friends. Then, select one of the photos and share 
it on Instagram using a grid. Also, you can use this image to create a Facebook banner or 
a business card.

CHAPTER 12
Marketing and Selling 
Photos Like a Pro
Mastering the artistic and technical sides of iPhone photography is clearly not enough to 
build a professional photography business that can return profits and accolades. While 
there are numerous talented iPhone photographers, few are able to turn their talent into 
a professional career. To do so, you must understand the marketing and business sides 
of the job, including how to market your social profile and make it visible for the world to 
see. With today’s technology and social networks, it is easier than ever to do this.
There are apps for your iPhone that extend your capabilities on the business side; 
they will help you to manage the paperwork associated with your projects such as 
contacts, forms, and model releases. You can also use your iPhone to give feedback, 
comment on documents, sign forms, and send contracts.
Managing Contracts and Forms
Tool used: Adobe Acrobat mobile
Adobe Acrobat is one of the most powerful tools in document management on a 
desktop. The mobile version includes many of the desktop version features that can help 
you to easily manage your documents related to photography projects, such as model 
releases and contracts. You can scan documents, add comments to them, sign them, and 
share them with your team.
Scanning Documents
One of the recently added features to the Acrobat mobile app (see Figure 12-1) is the ability 
to scan a paper document and modify it to enhance the scanned version of the document. 
Once you are done, you can edit it, share it, and save it to the Adobe Cloud service.

332
Figure 12-1.  Adobe Acrobat mobile app main interface
While Acrobat allows you to use the flash on your camera and set it to either on, off, 
or auto by clicking the flash icon on the bottom left of the screen, it is advised to scan 
your document in good light conditions such as with ample daylight. This will ensure a

333
clear and good-quality scanned image. Additionally, try to avoid any shadows that may 
appear when you hold the camera in your hand; you can try changing your position or 
the position of the scanned image.
Step 1: Set Up the Document and Scan
To set up the document and scan it, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open Adobe Acrobat.
	 2.	 Tap Acrobat’s left menu icon and choose Scan (see Figure 12-2).
Figure 12-2.  Acrobat app’s left menu
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

334
When you scan a document, Acrobat allows you to crop the scanned photo to display 
only the required area. To make sure that Auto Crop is on, tap the right-bottom icon.
	 3.	 Point your camera to the document’s first page. Acrobat detects 
the page by displaying a blue rectangle around it. Once you are 
satisfied with the results, press the Camera button to take the shot 
(see Figure 12-3).
Figure 12-3.  The Acrobat Scan feature detects the paper borders and highlights 
the detected area in blue

335
Step 2: Add and Modify the Scanned Document
To add and modify the scanned document, follow these steps:
	 1.	 On the Review screen, you will find the scanned photo. You can 
add more photos by clicking the Add Photo icon, whether you can 
choose Take Another Photo or Select from Photos.
	 2.	 Tap the Reorder icon to rearrange the pages’ order in the document 
by simply dragging a photo into the preferred order (see Figure 12-4).

336
	 3.	 Click the Crop tool to modify the cropping area. Use the rectangle 
to define the area to crop and click Done. You can click the Rotate 
icons to change the rotation of the page.
	 4.	 You may notice that the colors on the page are not the same as the 
original document. You can determine the color type for the image 
by tapping the Color Edit icon, which allows you to choose between 
Original Photo, Auto Color, Grayscale, and Whiteboard (see Figure 12-5).
Figure 12-5.  Choose the color setting for the final document

337
Step 3: Share Documents
You can save a document and share it with others by tapping the Save PDF button at the top 
right of the screen. You will need to add the name of the document. If you have a free Adobe 
Document Cloud membership, the document will automatically be saved to the cloud. You 
can also tap Save to Cloud to save it manually. You can tap Share to send the document to 
people through e-mail, Skype, WhatsApp, and other applications. When you tap the Share 
icon, you will get the choice to share a link to the document, share the document itself, save 
it to Adobe Document Cloud, save it to Dropbox, or open it in other applications. You can 
also print the document if you have a supported printer (see Figure 12-6).

applications

338
Step 4: Comment on Documents
When someone sends you a document such as an invoice or contract to review, you can 
use Acrobat on your iPhone to add your comments and feedback before a final signature. 
You can also send it back for modifications.
	 1.	 Tap the Comments icon in the bottom toolbar to activate the 
comments mode. You can also access the comments mode by 
clicking Comment in the left menu of Acrobat (see Figure 12-7).

339
	 2.	 Click the Note icon on the bottom toolbar. Click the point where 
you want to add a comment on it. In the pop-up dialog box, type 
your name and then type your note. You can also use other tools 
to highlight text, add strikethrough, underline text, add text, free 
draw, and add a signature (see Figure 12-8).

Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

340
	 3.	  Click Save at the top-right side of the screen. Once the app closes, 
you can click and drag the note to any part of the page.
Step 5: Fill in and Sign a Document
Tool used: Adobe Fill and Sign
If you have a contract, a form, or an invoice to fill in and sign, Adobe provides a free 
application, Adobe Fill and Sign, that allows you to do this directly from your iPhone. 
Adobe Fill and Forms saves you time by keeping a record of the basic information that 
you frequently use to fill in forms such as your name, address, e-mail, telephone, and 
more. Also, it stores your digital signature and initials to easily and quickly fill in forms.
Step 6: Fill in Your Profile
To fill in your profile, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open the Fill and Sign app.
	 2.	 Click the Profile icon in the bottom toolbar, and fill in your 
personal information that you may use in forms such as your 
name, address, e-mail, and so on (see Figure 12-9).
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

341

Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

342
Step 7: Add Your Signature and Initials
To add your signature and initials, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Tap the Signature icon and choose to add either a signature or 
your initials. The window allows you to draw your signature with 
your finger or using a stylus pen. I suggest using a stylus pen if you 
can’t create an accurate one with your finger (see Figure 12-10).
Figure 12-10.  Creating a digital signature using the Fill & Sign app
	 2.	 You can also click the Camera icon on the bottom right to take a 
photo of your hard-copy signature and use it. If you already have a 
signature image, you can click the image icon to navigate to your 
Camera Roll and use that signature image.
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

343
Step 8: Fill in Forms
To fill in forms, follow these steps:
	 1.	 After setting up your profile information and signature, you can 
start filling in forms. Click the field you want to fill in, such as the 
name. A text field appears to let you fill the form by typing the 
information (see Figure 12-11).

344
	 2.	 If the information is already saved in your profile, click the Profile 
icon and click the piece of information you want to insert to find it 
added to the form.
	 3.	 If the text is longer than the form field, you can click the added text 
to display the resizing rectangle that allows you to click and drag 
to reposition the text or drag the edges to resize the text.
	 4.	 At the end of the form, you can apply the same steps as earlier. 
Click the Signature icon to choose to add either a full signature 
or just your initials; once you’ve done that, you can reposition or 
resize what you added (see Figure 12-12).

Build a Photography Portfolio
As a photographer, your profile is crucial to show your work to your clients and followers, 
get feedback, and engage with the photographer community. If you want to be a 
professional photographer, your portfolio and your résumé ensure that your client can 
learn more about your experience and talent.
There are various ways to create your online presence such as personal web sites, 
portfolio web sites, and social network pages. Each of these types has its pros and cons.
Personal Photography Web Site
Having your own web site with your own URL gives you a professional look and ensures 
followers and clients see you as an established business. However, it requires a lot of 
effort and knowledge to register a domain name, a reliable server to host your web site, 
and administration time to upload and maintain the web site content. Or, you can pay 
money to a company to handle this all for you.
Portfolio Web Sites
For beginner photographers who want to focus on their work, hosting their own web site 
is a time-consuming and expensive choice. Therefore, many photographers use portfolio 
web sites that allow them to create a free account (sometimes with paid upgrades). 
These web sites include the following:
•	
500px.com
•	
Behance.net
•	
1x.com
•	
Flickr.com
Some portfolio web sites cater to all art fields such as Behance.net (see Figure 12-13), 
and others focus on photography such as 500px.com (see Figure 12-14). While these web 
sites don’t allow you to have your own URL and the freedom to design your own web site, 
they offer numerous advantages. Specifically, portfolio web sites save you lots of effort 
and cost related to creating a professional web site. All you need to do is to create a free 
account and start uploading your photos.
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

Figure 12-14.  500px is an online profile web site that focuses on photography
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

348
Additionally, many of these portfolio web sites include a social networking feature 
that allows you to follow other photographers, rate their work, and comment on their 
activities.
Social Network Pages
Another way to build a portfolio is to use social networking sites such as Facebook, 
Instagram, and Pinterest. These sites are great for social interaction and promoting your 
work. However, these sites are not designed to display your work as a true portfolio. 
Followers see notifications once you upload a new photo, and if they need to see your 
previous work, they have to scroll through your past posts or go to the Photos section.
Based on this, the portfolio web sites can be a good start for both amateur and 
professional photographers to build their portfolios. Some portfolio web sites, such as 
500px, even have mobile applications so that you can directly upload the photos you 
take from your iPhone after modifying them. The 500px app allows you to take photos 
and upload them, and the Raw app allows you to take Raw photos and upload them to a 
marketplace to sell.
Making Your Photos Searchable
If you have an online presence, through either a portfolio site or a social network, 
you need to make your photos searchable where people can find them, buy them, or 
download them. When clients search for a specific photo or a photography service, they 
type what they need in the search field on Google, Bing, or Yahoo.
Search engines don’t see images like we do; they see the metadata associated with 
an image, such as the image title, description, and keywords. When uploading a photo 
to your portfolio, it is important to add this metadata to increase the chance that your 
clients can find you while searching for photos to buy or a photographer to hire.
Thankfully, the portfolio web sites allow you to easily insert this information while 
uploading your photos. In the following steps, I will walk you through uploading a photo 
from your iPhone to your 500px.com profile using the 500px app:
	 1.	 Open the 500px app on your iPhone.
	 2.	 Tap the Camera icon on the bottom toolbar. This will allow you 
either to take a photo or to select a photo from your device.
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

349
	 3.	 Tap the Camera Roll to access your photo album and select the 
photo that you want to upload to your profile (see Figure 12-15).
Figure 12-15.  Capture a photo or choose one from your Camera Roll to upload to 
your 500px profile
	 4.	 In the description field, type descriptive information about your 
photo, such as what it is, its category, its location, and other 
photography specifications.
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

350
	 5.	 In the Category section, you can select the category of your photo.
	 6.	 In the keywords section, you will notice that the app has added 
keywords based on the photo content; you can add more 
keywords or remove the nonsuitable keywords (see Figure 12-16).
Figure 12-16.  Add the photo description, category, and keywords before 
uploading it
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

351
	 7.	 Click Upload.
	 8.	 Once your photo is uploaded, you can share it with your followers 
on different social networks.
If you used any of the Adobe apps to modify your photo, you can directly upload it to 
your Behance.net account from in that app, as follows:
	 1.	 Open one of the projects you created previously in this book in the 
Photoshop Mix app.
	 2.	 Click the Share icon at the top right of the screen and choose 
Behance (Figure 12-17).
Figure 12-17.  In Photoshop Mix, choose Behance from the Share menu
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

352
	 3.	 Tap the Text icon in the bottom toolbar to add a description for the 
photo, and tap Save. You can tap the Reorder link to change the 
order of the text and image. Once done, click Next (see Figure 12-­18).

bottom images. Tap Next.
	 5.	 On the Info page, fill in the project information (see Figure 12-19).
	 6.	 Tap Advanced to add more details about the project.
	 7.	 Tap Publish.

Selling Photos Online
It is time to make some money from your iPhone photos. With the advanced camera 
features, tools, and techniques you learned, you can make money from your beautiful 
iPhone photos. Although the photo market is competitive, good photos can make an 
impact. Before starting to upload your photos to sell, there are some general guidelines 
that you need to consider to professionally brand your work. These guidelines include 
the following:
•	
You need to have a professional profile on the web sites that sell 
photos. When someone buys your photo, there is a higher chance 
they will visit your profile or see your other photos. So, it is important 
to keep it professional. You can easily learn about professional 
profiles by visiting the top profiles on each web site to see how they 
look and try to get inspiration from them.
•	
You need to understand the market demand. What are the photos 
that people most want to buy? Actually, the answer to this question 
varies from one web site to another, as you will see later. Therefore, 
you need to do some research about the most downloaded photos, 
their themes, and the categories they’re in. This can help you to learn 
which photos to upload to specific platforms. Additionally, many of 
the current photo-selling web sites give you a higher rate for exclusive 
photos that you don’t upload to other web sites. Accordingly, you can 
determine which photos are suitable for each web site.
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

355
Where to Sell Your Photos?
When it comes to selling your photos, there are different platforms where you can 
create a photography profile and sell your photos. Usually, they are commission-based 
platforms, where you get a percentage of each sale. The more sales you achieve, the more 
percentage you get. This model encourages photographers to promote their photos and 
upload more photos to increase their sale percentage.
There are many stock photograph web sites, and you can try them all; however, it is 
probably good to focus on the popular web sites because you will have a better chance to 
sell your photos there. Sadly, the competition on these web sites is also high. These web 
sites include the following:
•	
Pond 5: https://www.pond5.com
•	
Adobe Stock: https://stock.adobe.com
•	
Shutter Stock: https://www.shutterstock.com
•	
iStockphotos: www.istockphoto.com
•	
500px Marketplace: https://marketplace.500px.com
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

356
Some of these applications such as Adobe Stock and 500px allow you to submit your 
photos to their marketplace directly from your iPhone. In Adobe Stock, you can open 
an Adobe mobile app such as Photoshop Mix and click the Share icon, where you can 
choose Adobe Stock (see Figure 12-20).
Figure 12-20.  You can upload your photos to the Adobe Stock marketplace from 
Photoshop Mix
Chapter 12  Marketing and Selling Photos Like a Pro

357
For 500px, you can download the Raw app, which allows you to take Camera Raw 
photos directly from your iPhone. After modifying the image, you can choose to submit it 
to their marketplace.
Also, you can sell your photos on arts-and-crafts web sites such as Easy, which allows 
you to sell any physical and digital artwork by opening a store. Then you can provide 
your photos, which customers can either download or print it, or you can deliver them 
as a printed physical product. While Etsy does not focus exclusively on selling photos, it 
allows you to provide your photos in both digital and printed formats. This can maximize 
your revenues.
Finally, you can sell your photos on your own web site if you create an online store 
on a web site such as Shopify, which maximizes your revenues per photo because there 
is no commission charged for the stock photo web site. However, you need to heavily 
market your web site to find clients, which is not an easy job.
Summary
You can take your mobile photography hobby to a new professional level by mastering 
the business-related tips in this chapter. The new iPhone versions have dramatically 
improved the camera and photography features, which allows you to take professional 
photos that you can sell online or add to your professional portfolio. The iPhone 
also allows you to manage your photography business by giving you access to your 
documents, where you can review, comment, sign, and share them with your peers. Also, 
you can upload our photos directly from your phone to your online profile and submit it 
to marketplaces.
Practice Exercise
The exercise in this chapter is a little different from the previous ones as it doesn’t 
involve any photo editing. Find a paper document or a contract you have in your desk 
and try to digitalize it by scanning it with the Acrobat app. Then, start using the comment 
tools to add your notes to the document. In addition, choose a photo from the previously 
covered projects and upload it to your profile on 500px or Behance directly from your 
iPhone. Don’t forget to add the necessary information to make your work searchable and 
visible.

Amo Passicos is self-taught. Even though her pictures might suggest she is short-­
sighted, chaotic, and family-driven, they simply display the serious disorder of scattered 
reminiscences she tries to keep before memory escapes her.
Attracted by technological novelty and its spin-off, Amo has peppily tested the 
hundreds of apps her iPhone offers, with a “first mover” approach. Seduced by the 
immediacy of images, she shoots her photos by game and with a genuine desire to 
contribute to the emergence of a new artistic form.
She currently lives in the south of France and manages female rock bands.

Michael began communicating as an iPhoneographer in late 2011 when he 
discovered the power wrapped inside his tiny telephone camera. As a professional 
photographer, he began to explore the limitations of the iPhone (and thus learned its 
strengths) and soon began to exploit various facets of his creativity with the device. 
He credits Instagram as the artistic sharing community where iPhoneography and art 
have flourished, giving him inspiration toward new opportunities and new discoveries. 
Michael is also a published author and often writes about and teaches iPhoneography 
and creative editing.
