Objectives of 
This Textbook
The Shelly Cashman Series® offers the finest textbooks in computer education. We are 
proud that since Microsoft Office 4.3, our series of Microsoft Office textbooks have 
been the most widely used books in education. With each new edition of our Office 
books, we make significant improvements based on the software and comments made 
by instructors and students. For this Microsoft Office 2013 text, the Shelly Cashman 
Series development team carefully reviewed our pedagogy and analyzed its effectiveness 
in teaching today’s Office student. Students today read less, but need to retain more. 
They need not only to be able to perform skills, but to retain those skills and know 
how to apply them to different settings. Today’s students need to be continually 
engaged and challenged to retain what they’re learning.
With this Microsoft Office 2013 text, we continue our commitment to focusing 
on the users and how they learn best.

xvi   Preface    Microsoft Office 2013 Introductory
The Shelly Cashman Approach 
A Proven Pedagogy with an Emphasis on Project Planning
Each chapter presents a practical problem to be solved within a project planning 
framework. The project orientation is strengthened by the use of the Roadmap, which 
provides a visual framework for the project. Step-by-step instructions with supporting 
screens guide students through the steps. Instructional steps are supported by the 
Q&A, Experimental Step, and BTW features.
A Visually Engaging Book that Maintains Student Interest
The step-by-step tasks, with supporting figures, provide a rich visual experience for the 
student. Call-outs on the screens that present both explanatory and navigational infor-
mation provide students with information they need when they need to know it. 
Supporting Reference Materials (Capstones, Quick Reference)
With the Quick Reference, students can quickly look up information about a single 
task, such as keyboard shortcuts, and find page references to where in the book the task 
is illustrated. The Capstone Projects allow students to demonstrate mastery of skills 
across the Introductory content for Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and Outlook.
Integration of the World Wide Web
The World Wide Web is integrated into the Office 2013 learning experience with 
(1) BTW annotations; (2) BTW, Q&A, and Quick Reference Summary Web pages; 
and (3) the Learn Online resources for each chapter.
End-of-Chapter Student Activities
Extensive end-of-chapter activities provide a variety of reinforcement opportunities 
for students to apply and expand their skills through individual and group work. To 
complete some of these assignments, you will be required to use the Data Files for 
Students. Visit www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed access instructions 
or contact your instructor for information about accessing the required files.
New to this Edition 
Enhanced Coverage of Critical Thinking Skills
A New Consider This element poses thought-provoking questions throughout each 
chapter, providing an increased emphasis on critical thinking and problem-solving 
skills. Also, every task in the project now includes a reason why the students are 
­performing the task and why the task is necessary.
Enhanced Retention and Transference
A new Roadmap element provides a visual framework for each project, showing 
­students where they are in the process of creating each project, and reinforcing the 
context of smaller tasks by showing how they fit into the larger project.
Integration of Office with Cloud and Web Technologies
A new Lab focuses entirely on integrating cloud and web technologies with Office 2013, 
using technologies like blogs, social networks, and SkyDrive.
More Personalization
Each chapter project includes an optional instruction for the student to personalize his 
or her solution, if required by an instructor, making each student’s solution unique.
More Collaboration
A new Research and Collaboration project has been added to the Consider This: Your 
Turn assignment at the end of each chapter.

WD 14   Word Chapter 1   Creating, Formatting, and Editing a Word Document with a Picture
Font, Font Sizes, and Themes
Characters that appear on the screen are a specific shape and size. The font, or 
typeface, defines the appearance and shape of the letters, numbers, and special characters. 
In Word, the default font usually is Calibri (shown in Figure 1 – 14 on 15). You can leave 
characters in the default font or change them to a different font. Font size specifies the size 
of the characters and is determined by a measurement system called points. A single point is 
about 1/72 of one inch in height. The default font size in Word typically is 11 (Figure 1 – 14). 
Thus, a character with a font size of 11 is about 11/72 or a little less than 1/6 of one inch in 
height. You can increase or decrease the font size of characters in a document.
A document theme is a set of unified formats for fonts, colors, and graphics. 
Word includes a variety of document themes to assist you with coordinating these 
visual elements in a document. The default theme fonts are Calibri Light for headings 
and Calibri for body text. By changing the document theme, you quickly can give your 
document a new look. You also can define your own document themes.
How do I know which formats to use in a flyer?
In a flyer, consider the following formatting suggestions.
• Increase the font size of characters. Flyers usually are posted on a bulletin board or in a window. Thus, the font 
size should be as large as possible so that passersby easily can read the flyer. To give the headline more impact, its font size 
should be larger than the font size of the text in the body copy. If possible, make the font size of the signature line larger 
than the body copy but smaller than the headline.
• Change the font of characters. Use fonts that are easy to read. Try to use only two different fonts in a flyer; for 
example, use one for the headline and the other for all other text. Too many fonts can make the flyer visually confusing. 
• Change the paragraph alignment. The default alignment for paragraphs in a document is left-aligned, that is, flush 
at the left margin of the document with uneven right edges. Consider changing the alignment of some of the paragraphs to 
add interest and variety to the flyer.
• Highlight key paragraphs with bullets. A bulleted paragraph is a paragraph that begins with a dot or other symbol. 
Use bulleted paragraphs to highlight important points in a flyer.
• Emphasize important words. To call attention to certain words or lines, you can underline them, italicize them, or bold 
them. Use these formats sparingly, however, because overuse will minimize their effect and make the flyer look too busy.
• Use color. Use colors that complement each other and convey the meaning of the flyer. Vary colors in terms of hue and 
brightness. Headline colors, for example, can be bold and bright. Signature lines should stand out more than body copy but 
less than headlines. Keep in mind that too many colors can detract from the flyer and make it difficult to read.

Formatting Marks
With some fonts, the 
formatting marks will not 
be displayed properly on 
the screen. For example, the 
raised dot that signifies a 
blank space between words 
may be displayed behind a 
character instead of in the 
blank space, causing the 
characters to look incorrect.

Correcting Errors in the Table Structure
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Instructions:  Analyze SciFi Movies is a database containing information on classic science 
 fiction movies that your film professor would like to use for teaching. The Movie table shown in 
 Figure 1–85 contains errors to the table structure. Your professor has asked you to correct the 
 errors and make some improvements to the database. Start Access and open the Analyze SciFi 
Movies database from the Data Files for Students.
1. Correct Movie Number should be the primary key for the Movie table. The ID field should 
not be a field in the table. The Rating field represents a numerical rating system of one to four to 
indicate the quality of the movie. Your instructor wants to be able to find the average rating for 
films directed by a particular director. Only integers should be stored in both the Rating and the 
Length (Minutes) fields.
2. Improve The default field size for Short Text fields is 255. Changing the field size to more 
accurately represent the maximum number of characters that can be stored in a field is one way to 
improve the accuracy of the data. The Movie Number, Director Number, and Awards fields should 
have a maximum size of 3 characters. The Year Made field should have a maximum field size of 4. 
The Movie Name and Studio fields should have a maximum field size of 50. If instructed to do 
so by your instructor, rename the Movie table as Movie Last Name where Last Name is your last 
name. Submit the revised database in the format specified by your instructor.
3. 
 The Awards field currently has a data type of Short Text, but the only values that will be 
stored in that field are Yes and No to indicate whether the movie won any awards. What would be a 
more appropriate data type for this field?

Problem:  Dartt Offsite Services is a local company that provides offsite data services and  solutions. 
The company provides remote data backup, disaster recovery planning and services, website backup, 
and offsite storage of paper documents for small businesses and nonprofit organizations. Service rep-
resentatives are responsible for communicating data solutions to the client, scheduling backups and 
other tasks, and resolving any conflicts. The company recently decided to store its  client and service 
rep data in a database. Each client is assigned to a single service rep, but each  service rep may be 
assigned many clients. The database and the Service Rep table have been  created, but the Monthly 
Salary field needs to be added to the table. The records shown in Table 1–6 must be added to the 
Service Rep table. The company plans to import the Client table from the Excel worksheet shown in 
Figure 1–86. Dartt would like to finish storing this data in a database and has asked you to help.

1: Design and Create a Photography Club Flyer
Personal
Part 1: As secretary of your school’s Photography Club, you are responsible for creating and distribut-
ing flyers announcing the club. The flyer should contain two digital pictures appropriately resized; the 
Data Files for Students contains two pictures called Photography 1 and Photography 2, or you can use 
your own digital pictures if they are appropriate for the topic of the flyer. The flyer should contain the 
headline, Photography Club, and this signature line: Questions? Call Emily at (883) 555-0901. The 
body copy consists of the following text, in any order: Do you love photography? This is the club for 
you! All skill levels are welcome. Meetings every Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. in the Student Center (room 232). 
Bring your camera. We look forward to seeing you at our next meeting!
Use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter to create and format this flyer. Be 
sure to check spelling and grammar. Submit your assignment and answers to the critical thinking 
questions in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the flyer in this assignment: where to place 
text, how to format the text (i.e., font, font size, paragraph alignment, bulleted paragraphs, under-
lines, italics, bold, color, etc.), which graphics to use, where to position the graphics, how to format 
the graphics, and which page enhancements to add (i.e., borders and spacing). What was the ratio-
nale behind each of these decisions? When you proofread the document, what further revisions did 
you make and why? How would you recommend distributing this flyer?
2: Design and Create a Hot Air Balloon Rides Flyer

Hot Air Balloon 2, or you can use your own digital pictures if they are appropriate for the topic of 
the flyer. The flyer should contain the headline, Hot Air Balloon Rides, and this signature line: For 
reservations, call (485) 555-2295. The body copy consists of the following text, in any order: Amaz-
ing sights from incredible heights! The experience of a lifetime. Fun for the whole family. No pets.

A World of Technology
In the course of a day, you may . . . complete a homework assignment and watch a streaming video on 
your laptop, flip through news headlines and refill a prescription on your tablet, search for directions 
and the local weather forecast on your smartphone, book a flight and create a shipping label using 
your office computer, and listen to your favorite songs on a portable media player. These and many 
other technologies are an integral part of everyday life: at school, at home, and at work (Figure 1).
Technology can enable you to more efficiently and effectively access and search for 
­information; share personal ideas, photos, and videos with friends, family, and others; 
communicate with and meet other people; manage finances; shop for goods and services; play 
games or access other sources of entertainment; keep your life and activities organized; and 
complete business activities.
Because technology changes, you must keep up with the changes to remain digitally literate. 
Digital literacy involves having a current knowledge and understanding of computers, mobile 
devices, the Internet, and related technologies. This chapter presents some of the knowledge 
you need to be digitally literate today. As you read this chapter, keep in mind it is an overview.

Introduction to Technology  IT 3
Computers
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in 
its own memory, that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, 
produce information (output), and store the information for future use. Computers contain 
many electric, electronic, and mechanical components known as hardware.
Electronic components in computers process data using instructions, which are the steps that 
tell the computer how to perform a particular task. A collection of related instructions orga-
nized for a common purpose is referred to as software or a program. Using software, you can 
complete a variety of activities, such as search for information, type a paper, balance a budget, 
create a ­presentation, or play a game.
One popular category of computer is the personal computer. A personal computer (PC) is 
a computer that can perform all of its input, processing, output, and storage activities by itself 
and is intended to be used by one person at a time. Most personal computers today also can 
­communicate with other computers and devices. 
Types of personal computers include 
laptops, tablets, and desktops, with the 
first two sometimes called mobile com-
puters. A mobile computer is a portable 
personal computer, designed so that a user 
can carry it from place to place. A user is 
anyone who interacts with a computer or 
mobile device, or utilizes the information 
it generates.
Laptops
A laptop, also called a notebook 
­computer, is a thin, lightweight mobile 
computer with a screen in its lid and a 
keyboard in its base (Figure 2). Designed 
to fit on your lap and for easy transport, 
laptops weigh up to 10 pounds (varying 
by manufacturer and specifications). A 
laptop that is less than an inch thick and 
weighs about 3 pounds or less sometimes 
is referred to as an ultrathin laptop. Most 
laptops can ­operate on batteries or a 
power supply or both.
Tablets
Usually smaller than a laptop but larger 
than a phone, a tablet is a thin, lighter-
weight mobile computer that has a touch 
screen. A popular style of tablet is the slate, 
which does not contain a physical keyboard 
(Figure 3). Like laptops, tablets run on bat-
teries or a power supply or both; however, 
batteries in a tablet ­typically last longer than 
those in laptops.

IT 4   Introduction to Technology
CONSIDER THIS
If the slate tablet has no keyboard, how do you type on it?
You can use your fingers to press keys on a keyboard that appears on the screen, called an on-screen keyboard,  
or you can purchase a separate physical keyboard that attaches to or wirelessly communicates with the tablet.
Mobile Computer  
Buyer’s Guide
If you need computing capability while traveling and during lectures 
or meetings, you may find a laptop or tablet to be an appropriate 
choice. With the abundance of mobile computer manufacturers, 
research each before making a purchase. The following are 
purchasing considerations unique to mobile computers.
1.	 Determine which mobile computer form factor fits your needs. 
Consider a tablet or netbook if you primarily will use the device 
to access the Internet and email. If you will use the computer to 
create and edit documents, work on spreadsheets, play graphic 
intensive games, or use other software that requires greater 
processing power, consider purchasing a traditional or ultrathin 
laptop.
2.	 Consider a mobile computer with a sufficiently large screen. 
Laptops and tablets are available with various screen sizes. For 
example, most traditional and ultrathin laptop screens range in size 
from 11 to 18 inches, while most tablet and netbook screens range 
in size from 7 to 10 inches.
3.	 Experiment with different keyboards and pointing devices. Mobile 
computers often vary in size, and for that reason have different 
keyboard layouts. Familiarize yourself with the keyboard layout of the 
computer you want to purchase, and make sure it is right for you. 
If you have large fingers, for example, you should not purchase a 
computer with a small, condensed keyboard. Laptops typically include 
a touchpad to control the pointer. Tablets have a touch screen and an 
on-screen keyboard. 
4.	 Consider processor, memory, and storage upgrades at the time 
of purchase. As with a desktop, upgrading a mobile computer’s 
memory and disk storage may be less expensive at the time of 
initial purchase. Some disk storage is custom designed for mobile 
computer manufacturers, meaning an upgrade might not be 
­available in the future. 
5.	 The availability of built-in ports and slots is ­important. Determine 
which ports and slots (discussed later in this chapter) you require 
on the mobile computer. If you plan to transfer photos from a 
­digital camera using a memory card, consider a mobile computer 
with a built-in card slot compatible with your digital camera’s 
memory card. If you plan to connect devices such as a printer 
or USB flash drive to your mobile computer, consider ­purchasing 
one with one or more USB ports. In addition, ­evaluate mobile 
­computers with ports enabling you to connect an external monitor.
6.	 If you plan to use your mobile computer for a long time without 
access to an electrical outlet, or if the battery life for the mobile 
computer you want to purchase is not sufficient, consider pur-
chasing a second battery. Some mobile computers, such as most 
tablets, have built-in batteries that can be replaced only by a 
qualified technician. In that case, you might look into options for 
external battery packs or power sources. 
7.	 Purchase a well-padded and well-designed carrying case. An amply 
padded carrying case will protect your mobile computer from the 
bumps it will receive while traveling. A well-designed carrying case 
will have room for accessories such as USB flash drives, pens, and 
paperwork. Although a mobile computer may be small enough to 
fit in a handbag, make sure that the bag has sufficient padding to 
protect the computer.
8.	 If you plan to connect your mobile computer to a video projector, 
make sure the mobile computer is compatible with the video 
projector. You should check, for example, to be sure that your 
mobile computer will allow you to display an image on the 
screen and projection device at the same time. Also, ensure 
that the mobile computer has the ports required or that you 
have the necessary dongle and cables to connect to the video 
projector.
  Based on your current computing needs, should you purchase a 
traditional laptop, ultrathin laptop, netbook, or tablet? What are the 
specifications of the mobile computer you would purchase?

Introduction to Technology  IT 5
Desktops
A desktop, or desktop computer, is a personal computer designed to be in a stationary 
­location, where all of its components fit on or under a desk or table. On many desktops, the 
screen is housed in a device that is separate from a tower, which is a case that contains the 
­processing circuitry (Figure 4a). Other desktops, sometimes called all-in-one desktops, do not 
contain a tower and instead use the same case to house the screen and the processing circuitry 
(Figure 4b). Some screens for desktops support touch. 
Desktop Computer  
Buyer’s Guide
Desktops are a suitable option if you work mostly in one place and 
have plenty of space in a work area. Today, desktop manufacturers 
emphasize desktop style by offering bright colors, trendy displays, and 
theme-based towers so that the computer looks attractive if it is in 
an area of high visibility. If you have decided that a desktop is most 
suited to your technology needs, the next step is to determine specific 
software, hardware, peripheral devices, and services to purchase, as 
well as where to buy the computer. The following considerations will 
help you determine the appropriate desktop to purchase.
1.	 Determine the specific software to use on the desktop. Decide 
which software contains the features necessary for the tasks you 
want to ­perform. Your hardware requirements depend on the 
minimum requirements of the software you plan to use on the 
desktop.
2.	 Know the system requirements of the operating system. Determine 
the operating system you want to use because this also dictates 
­hardware requirements. If, however, you purchase a new desktop, 
chances are it will have the latest version of your preferred operating 
system ­(Windows, Mac OS, or Linux).
3.	 Look for bundled software. Purchasing software at the same time 
you purchase a desktop may be less expensive than purchasing the 
software at a later date. At the very least, you probably will want word 
processing software and an antivirus program.
4.	 Avoid purchasing the least powerful desktop ­available. Computer 
technology changes rapidly, which means a desktop that seems 
powerful enough today may not serve your computing needs in the 
future. Purchasing a desktop with the most memory, largest hard disk, 
and fastest processor you can ­afford will help delay obsolescence.
5.	 Consider upgrades to the keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, 
microphone, and speakers. You use these peripheral devices to 
interact with the desktop, so make sure they meet your standards.

CONSIDER THIS
Which type of computer — laptop, tablet, or desktop — is best?
It depends on your needs. Because laptops can be as powerful as the average desktop, more people today choose 
laptops over desktops so that they have the added benefit of portability. Tablets are ideal for those not needing 
the power of a laptop or for searching for information, communicating with others, and taking notes in lectures, at 
meetings, conferences, and other forums where a laptop is not practical.

IT 6   Introduction to Technology
Mobile and Game Devices
A mobile device is a computing device small enough to hold in your hand. Because of their 
reduced size, the screens on mobile devices are small — often between 3 and 5 inches. 
Some mobile devices are Internet capable, meaning that they can connect to the Internet 
wirelessly. You often can exchange information between the Internet and a mobile device or 
between a computer or network and a mobile device. Popular types of mobile devices are  
smartphones, digital cameras, portable media players, and e-book readers.
BTW
Online
When a computer or device 
connects to a network, it is 
online.
6.	 Consider a touch screen monitor. A touch screen monitor will 
enable you to interact with the latest operating systems and apps 
using touch input.
7.	 Evaluate all-in-one desktops. All-in-one desktops may be less 
expensive than purchasing a system unit and monitor separately. 
In addition, all-in-one desktops take up less space and often 
look more attractive than desktops with separate towers.
  8.	If you are buying a new desktop, you have several purchasing options: 
buy directly from a school bookstore, a local computer dealer, or a 
large retail store, or order from a vendor by mail, phone, or the web. 
Each purchasing option has its advantages. Explore each option to 
find the best combination of price and service.
  9.	Be aware of hidden costs. Along with the desktop itself, you also 
may need to make additional purchases. For example, you might 
purchase computer furniture, an uninterruptable power supply 
(UPS) or surge protector (discussed later in the chapter), an external 
hard disk, a printer, a router, a USB flash drive, or computer 
­training classes.
10.	Consider purchasing an extended warranty or ­service plan. If you 
use your computer for business or require fast resolution to major 
computer problems, consider purchasing an extended warranty or 
a service plan through a local dealer or third-party company. Most 
extended warranties cover the repair and replacement of computer 
components beyond the standard warranty. 
  Shop around for a desktop that meets your current needs. Which 
desktop would you purchase? Why?

Servers
A server is a computer dedicated to 
providing one or more services to other 
computers or devices on a network. A network 
is a collection of computers and devices con-
nected together, often wirelessly. Services 
provided by ­servers include storing content 
and controlling access to hardware, software, 
and other resources on a network.
A server can support from two to several 
thousand connected ­computers and devices 
at the same time. Servers are available in 
a variety of sizes and types for both small 
and large business applications (Figure 5). 
Smaller applications, such as at home, some-
times use a high-end desktop as a server. 
Larger corporate, government, and Internet 
applications use powerful, expensive servers 
to support their daily operations.

Introduction to Technology  IT 7
CONSIDER THIS
Are mobile devices computers?
The mobile devices discussed in this section can be categorized as computers because they operate under the control 
of instructions stored in their own memory, can accept data, process the data according to specified rules, produce or 
display information, and store the information for future use.
Smartphones
A smartphone is an Internet-capable phone that usually also includes a calendar, an 
appointment book, an address book, a calculator, a notepad, games, and several other apps 
(which are programs on a smartphone). Smartphones typically communicate wirelessly 
with other devices or computers. With several smartphone models, you also can listen to 
music and take photos.
Many smartphones have touch screens. Instead of or in addition to a touch screen, some 
smartphones have a built-in mini keyboard on the front of the phone or a keyboard that 
slides in and out from behind the phone (Figure 6). Others have keypads that contain both 
numbers and letters.

Instead of calling someone’s phone to talk, you can send messages to others by pressing 
images on an on-screen keyboard, keys on the mini keyboard, or buttons on the phone’s 
keypad. Three popular types of messages that you can send with smartphones include text 
messages, ­picture messages, and video messages.
•	A text message is a short note, typically fewer than 300 characters, sent to or from a 
smartphone or other mobile device.
•	A picture message is a photo or other image, sometimes along with sound and text, sent 
to or from a smartphone or other mobile device. A phone that can send picture messages 
sometimes is called a camera phone.
•	A video message is a short video clip, usually about 30 seconds, sent to or from a smartphone 
or other mobile device.
Read Ethics & Issues 1 on the next page to consider whether sending text messages affects 
writing skills.

IT 8   Introduction to Technology
Digital Cameras
A digital camera is a device that allows you to take 
photos and store the photographed images digitally 
(Figure 7). While many digital cameras look like a tra-
ditional camera, some are built into smartphones and 
other mobile devices.
Digital cameras typically allow you to review, and some-
times modify, images while they are in the camera. You also 
can transfer images from a digital camera to a computer, 
so that you can review, modify, share, organize, or print the 
images. Digital cameras often can connect to or communi-
cate wirelessly with a computer, a printer, or the Internet, 
enabling you to access the photos on the camera without 
using a cable. Some also can record videos. Many digital 
devices, such as smartphones and tablets, include an inte-
grated digital camera.
Portable Media Players
A portable media player, sometimes called a 
­personal media player, is a mobile device on which 
you can store, orga-
nize, and play or 
view digital media 
(Figure 8). Digital media includes music, photos, and videos. 
Portable media ­players enable you to listen to music, view 
photos, and watch videos, movies, and television shows. With 
most, you transfer the digital media from a computer (or the 
Internet, if the device is Internet capable) to the portable 
media player.

       Ethics & Issues 1
Do Text Messages Affect  
Writing Skills?
When you send text messages, the goal is to 
communicate the most amount of informa-
tion using the fewest words and characters. 
This type of rapid-fire communications places 
a higher priority on brevity and speed than 
spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. 
Educators wonder about the effect that text 
messages might have on the writing habits 
and grammar skills of today’s students. Their 
use of text acronyms such as LOL (laugh out 
loud) and text abbreviations that include 
numbers, such as gr8 (for great) or 2 (for 
to, too, or two), is working its way into their 
­formal writing. While adults also use text 
acronyms and abbreviations, the concern is 
that teens and young adults use them so 
often before developing formal writing skills. 
The result could be students who are less 
able to use formal language when needed. 
Research indicates that the more text 
messages students send, the more likely 
it is that they may have difficulty with 
formal writing. On the positive side, by 
reducing a message to as few words as 
possible, students learn to present the most 
important content first, without rambling or 
exaggeration. The downside is this can lead to 
short, choppy sentences that do not connect 
with each other and a lack of supporting 
details, which are essential in formal 
writing. Other positives are that students 
are writing more than ever, and that this 
type of writing can be considered a form of 
journaling, or recording of thoughts, activities, 
and opinions. Some educators argue that rather 
than worrying about the writing style that 
students use in their text messages, they should 
focus on helping students distinguish between 
formal and informal communications, and what 
is appropriate in each.
Does the use of text messages make 
­students less likely to perform well in ­formal 
writing assignments? Why or why not? 
Should teachers allow students to use text 
acronyms and abbreviations in formal writ-
ing? Why or why not? Do text messages 
have any positive impact on communica-
tions skills? Why or why not?

E-Book Readers
An e-book reader (short for electronic book 
reader), or e-reader, is a mobile device that is 
used ­primarily for reading e-books (Figure 9). 
An e-book, or digital book, is an electronic 
version of a printed book, readable on com-
puters and other digital devices. In addition 
to books, you typically can purchase and read 
other forms of digital media such as newspa-
pers and magazines.
Most e-book reader models have a touch 
screen, and some are Internet capable. These 
devices usually are smaller than tablets but 
larger than smartphones.
Game Devices
A game console is a mobile computing 
device designed for single-player or multi-
player video games. Gamers often connect 
the game console to a ­television so that they can 
view their gameplay on the television’s screen 
(Figure 10). Many game console models are Internet capable and also allow you to listen 
to music and watch movies or view photos. Typically 
weighing between three and eleven pounds, the compact 
size of game consoles makes them easy to use at home, 
in the car, in a hotel, or any location that has an electri-
cal outlet and a television screen. 
A handheld game device is small enough to fit in one 
hand, making it more portable than the game console. 
Because of their reduced size, the screens are small — 
­similar in size to some smartphone screens. Some hand-
held game device models are Internet capable and also 
can communicate ­wirelessly with other similar devices for 
­multiplayer gaming.

CONSIDER THIS
Are digital cameras, portable media players, e-book readers, and handheld game devices  
becoming obsolete because more and more smartphones and tablets include their functionality?
True, many smartphones and tablets enable you to take and store photos; store, organize, and play or view your 
digital media; read e-books; and play games. This trend of computers and devices with technologies that overlap, 
called convergence, means that consumers may need fewer devices for the functionality that they require.
Still, consumers often purchase separate stand-alone devices (i.e., a separate digital camera, portable media 
player, etc.) for a variety of reasons. The stand-alone device (i.e., a digital camera) may have more features and 
functionality than the combined device offers (i.e., a smartphone). You might want to be able to use both devices at 
the same time, for example, send text messages on the phone while reading a book on an e-book reader. Or, you 
might want protection if your combined device (i.e., smartphone) breaks. For example, you still can listen to music on 
a portable media player if your smartphone becomes nonfunctional.
Data and Information
Computers process data (input) into information (output) and often store the data and ­resulting 
information for future use. Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, 
numbers, images, audio, and video. Information conveys meaning to users. Both business and 
home users can make well-informed decisions because they have instant access to information 
from anywhere in the world.
Many daily activities either involve the use of or depend on information from a computer. 
For example, as shown in Figure 11, computers process several data items to print information 
in the form of a cash register receipt.
CONSIDER THIS
Can you give another example of data and its corresponding information?
Your name, address, term, course names, course sections, course grades, and course credits all represent data that 
is processed to generate your semester grade report. Other information on the grade report includes results of 
calculations such as total semester hours, grade point average, and total credits.

Input
Users have a variety of input options for entering data into a computer, many of which 
involve using an input device. An input device is any hardware component that allows you to 
enter data and instructions into a computer or mobile device. The following sections discuss 
common input methods.
Keyboards  A keyboard contains keys you press to 
enter data and instructions into a computer or mobile 
device (Figure 12). All desktop keyboards have a typ-
ing area that includes letters of the alphabet, numbers, 
punctuation marks, and other basic keys. Some users 
prefer a wireless keyboard because it eliminates the 
clutter of a cord. 
Keyboards for desktops contain more keys than 
keyboards for mobile computers and devices. To provide 
the same functionality as a desktop keyboard, many of the 
keys on mobile computers and devices serve two or three 
purposes. On a laptop, for example, you often use the 
same keys to type numbers and to show various areas on 
a screen, switching a key’s purpose by pressing a separate 
key first.

Mobile Computer Input
If you prefer a desktop 
keyboard to a laptop’s 
keyboard or a tablet’s 
on-screen keyboard, 
you can use a desktop 
keyboard with your 
mobile computer. 
Likewise, if you prefer 
using a mouse instead 
of a touchpad, you can 
use a mouse with your 
mobile computer.

Instead of a physical keyboard, users also can enter data via an on-screen 
keyboard or a virtual keyboard, which is a keyboard that projects from a device 
to a flat surface.
Pointing Devices 
A pointing device is an input device that allows a user to 
control a small symbol on a screen, called the pointer. Desktops typically use 
a mouse as their pointing device, and laptops use a touchpad (Figure 13). 
A mouse is a pointing device that fits under the palm of your hand 
­comfortably. With the mouse, you control movement of the pointer and send 
instructions to the computer or mobile device. Like keyboards, some users 
­prefer working with a wireless mouse. 
A touchpad is a small, flat, rectangular pointing device that is ­sensitive 
to pressure and motion. To control the pointer with a ­touchpad, slide your 
­fingertip across the surface of the pad. On most touchpads, you also can tap 
the pad’s surface to imitate mouse ­operations such as clicking.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Voice and Video Input  Some mobile devices and computers enable you to speak data 
­instructions using voice input and to capture live full-motion images using video input. With your 
smartphone, for example, you may be able to use your voice to send a text message, schedule 
an appointment, and dial a phone number. Or, you may opt for video calling instead of a tra-
ditional phone call, so that you and the person you called can see each other as you chat on a 
computer or mobile device. As in this example, video input usually works in conjunction with 
voice input. For voice input, you use a microphone, and for video input you use a webcam 
(Figure 14).

A microphone is an input device that enables you to speak into 
a computer or mobile device. Many computers and most mobile 
devices contain built-in microphones. You also can talk into a 
headset, which contains both a microphone and a speaker. Many 
headsets can communicate ­wirelessly with the computer or mobile 
device. A webcam is a digital video camera that allows you to cap-
ture video and usually audio input for your ­computer or mobile 
device. 
Scanners 
A scanner is a light-sensing input device that converts 
printed text and images into a form the computer can process 
(Figure 15). A popular type of scanner works in a manner similar 
to a copy machine, except that instead of ­creating a paper copy of 
the document or photo, it stores the scanned document or photo 
­electronically. 
Output 
Users have a variety of output options to convey text, graphics, audio, and video — many 
of which involve using an output device. An output device is any hardware component that 
­conveys information from a computer or mobile device to one or more people. The sections on 
the next page discuss common output methods.

Displays  A display is an output device that visually conveys text, graphics, and video 
­information. Displays consist of a screen and the components that produce the information 
on the screen. The display for a desktop typically is a monitor, which is a separate, physical 
device. Mobile computers and devices typically integrate the display in their same physical case 
(Figure 17). Some displays have touch screens.

Printers 
A printer is an output device that produces text and graphics on a physical 
medium such as paper. Printed content sometimes is referred to as a hard copy or printout. 
Most printers today print text and graphics in both ­black-and-white and color on a variety of 
paper types (Figure 16). Some printer models also can print lab-quality photos. A variety of 
printers support wireless printing, where a computer or other device communicates wirelessly 
with the printer.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Speakers  Speakers allow you to hear audio, that is, music, voice, and other sounds. Most 
­personal computers and mobile devices have a small internal speaker. Many users attach 
­higher-quality speakers to their computers and mobile devices, including game consoles. 
So that only you can hear sound, you can listen through earbuds (shown in Figure 8 on 
page IT 8) or headphones, which cover or are placed ­outside of the ear (Figure 18). Both 
earbuds and headphones usually 
include ­noise-cancelling technol-
ogy to reduce the interference of 
sounds from the surrounding envi-
ronment. To eliminate the clutter 
of cords, users can opt for ­wireless 
­speakers or wireless headphones.
Memory and Storage 
Memory consists of electronic 
components that store instructions 
waiting to be executed and the 
data needed by those instructions. 
Although some forms of memory 
are permanent, most memory keeps 
data and instructions temporarily, 
which means its contents are erased 
when the computer is shut off. 
Storage, by contrast, holds data, 
instructions, and information for future use. For example, computers can store hundreds or 
millions of student names and addresses permanently.  
A computer keeps data, instructions, and information on storage media. Examples of stor-
age media are hard disks, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, memory cards, and optical 
discs. The amount of storage for each type of storage media varies, but hard disks, solid-state 
drives, and optical discs usually hold more than USB flash drives and memory cards. Some 
storage media are portable, meaning you can remove the medium from one computer and 
carry it to another computer. 
A storage device records (writes) and/or retrieves (reads) items to and from storage 
media. Storage devices often also function as a source of input and output because they 
transfer items from storage to memory and vice versa. Drives and readers/writers, which are 
types of ­storage devices, accept a specific kind of storage media. For example, a DVD drive 
(storage device) accepts a DVD (storage media). 
Hard Disks 
A hard disk is a storage device that contains one or more inflexible, ­
circular platters that use magnetic particles to store data, instructions, and information. 
The entire device is enclosed in an airtight, sealed case to protect it from contamination. 
Desktops and laptops often contain at least one hard disk that is mounted inside the  
computer’s case, called a fixed disk because this hard disk is not portable (Figure 19a on the 
next page). External hard disks are separate, portable, ­freestanding hard disks that usually 
­connect to the computer with a cable (Figure 19b on the next page).

CONSIDER THIS
What can you do to ease eyestrain while using a computer or mobile device?
Position the display about 20 degrees below eye level. Clean the screen regularly. Blink your eyes every five seconds. 
Adjust the room lighting. Face into an open space beyond the screen. Use larger fonts or zoom the display. Take an 
eye break every 30 minutes. If you wear glasses, ask your doctor about computer glasses.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Solid-State Drives 
A solid-state drive 
(SSD) is a storage device that typically uses 
flash memory to store data, instructions, 
and information. Flash memory contains no 
moving parts, making it more durable and 
shock resistant than other types of media. For 
this reason, some manufacturers are using 
SSDs instead of hard disks in their desktops, 
­laptops, and tablets (Figure 20). 
Usb Flash Drives 
A USB flash drive is a 
­portable flash ­memory storage device that you 
plug in a USB port, which is a ­special, ­easily 
accessible opening on a computer or mobile 
device (Figure 21). USB flash drives are conve-
nient for mobile users because they are small 
and lightweight enough to be transported on a 
keychain or in a pocket.
Memory Cards  A memory card is removable 
flash memory, ­usually no bigger than 1.5 inches 
in height or width, that you insert in and remove 
from a slot in a computer, mobile device, or  
card reader/writer (Figure 22). With a card 
reader/writer, you can transfer the stored items, 
such as digital photos, from a memory card to a 
computer or printer that does not have a built-in 
card slot.

CONSIDER THIS
What is the general use for each type of storage media?
Hard disks and SSDs store software and all types of user files. A file is a named collection of stored data, instructions, 
or information and can contain text, images, audio, and video. Memory cards and USB flash drives store files you 
intend to transport from one location to another, such as a homework assignment or photos. Optical discs generally 
store software, photos, movies, and music.
Cloud Storage  Instead of storing data, instructions, and information locally on a hard disk or 
other media, you can opt for cloud storage. Cloud storage is an Internet service that provides 
­storage to computer users (Figure 24). 
Types of services offered by cloud storage providers vary. Some provide storage for specific 
types of media, such as photos, whereas others store any content and provide backup services. 
A backup is a duplicate of content on a storage medium that you can use in case the original 
is lost, damaged, or destroyed. Read Secure IT 1 on the next page for suggestions for backing 
up your computers and mobile devices.

Optical Discs 
An optical 
disc is a type of storage media 
that ­consists of a flat, round, 
portable metal disc made of 
metal, plastic, and lacquer 
that is written and read by a 
laser. CDs (compact discs) and 
DVDs (digital ­versatile discs) 
are two types of optical discs 
(Figure 23).

The Internet
The Internet is a worldwide collection of computer networks that connects millions of 
­businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and individuals (Figure 25). The 
Internet provides society with access to global information and instant communications. 
Businesses, called Internet service providers (ISPs), offer users and organizations access to 
the Internet free or for a fee. By subscribing to an ISP, you can connect to the Internet through 
your computers and mobile devices. 
Today, more than two billion home and business users around the world access a variety of 
services on the Internet. The World Wide Web is one of the more widely used Internet services. 
Other popular services include email, instant messaging, VoIP, and FTP (all discussed later in 
this chapter).

Backing Up Computers and Mobile 
Devices
Many factors, including power outages and 
hardware failure, can cause loss of data, 
instructions, or information on a computer 
or mobile device. To protect against loss, you 
should back up the contents of storage media 
regularly. Backing up can provide peace of 
mind and save hours of work attempting to 
recover important material in the event of loss.
A backup plan for computers could include 
the following:
•	 Use a backup program, either included 
with your computer’s operating system or 
one that you purchased separately, to copy 
the contents of your entire hard disk to a 
separate device.
•	 Regularly copy music, photos, videos, 
­documents, and other important items to a 
USB flash drive, external hard disk, or DVD.
•	 Subscribe to a cloud storage provider.
•	 Schedule your files to be backed up ­regularly. 
Backup plans for mobile devices are less 
specific. Apps for backing up your smartphone 
or tablet’s content are available. You also can 
back up a mobile device to your computer’s 
hard disk using synchronization software that 
runs on your computer. Some mobile device 
manufacturers, such as Apple, provide cloud 
storage solutions to owners of their devices. 
Other services allow subscribers to use a 
friend’s computer as a backup storage location. 
Overall, the best advice is to back up often 
using a variety of methods.
  Do you back up files regularly? If not, 
why not? What would you do if you had 
no backup and then discovered that your 
computer or mobile device had failed?

How To 1
Use a Browser to Display a Webpage
The following steps describe how to use a 
browser to display a webpage on a computer 
or mobile device:
1.	 Run the browser. (For instructions on 
­running programs and apps, see How To 3  
and How To 4 on page IT 27.)
2.	 If necessary, tap or click the address bar 
to select it and any previously ­displayed 
web address it may contain. (A web 
address is a unique address that identifies 
a webpage.)
3.	 In the address bar, type the web address 
of the webpage you want to visit and then 
press the enter key or tap or click the Go 
(or similar) button to display the webpage. 
For example, www.cengagebrain.com is 
a valid web address, which displays the 
CengageBrain webpage shown in the figure 
below. 
4.	 If necessary, scroll to view the entire webpage. 
You can scroll either by sliding your finger 
across a touch screen or by using a pointing 
device, such as a mouse, to drag the scroll bar.
5.	 Tap or click links on the webpage to 
­navigate to the link’s destination.
  What should you do if the web address 
you enter does not display a webpage or you 
receive an error message?
Webpages often contain links. A link, short for hyperlink, is a built-in connection to other 
­documents, graphics, audio files, videos, webpages, or websites. To activate an item ­associated 
with a link, you tap or click the link. In Figure 26 on the previous page, for example, tapping or 
clicking the audio link connects to a live radio show so that you can hear the broadcast. A text 
link often changes color after you tap or click it to remind you visually that you previously have 
visited the webpage or downloaded the content associated with the link.
Links allow you to obtain information in a nonlinear way. That is, instead of accessing topics 
in a specified order, you move directly to a topic of interest. Some people use the phrase surfing 
the web to refer to the activity of using links to explore the web.
A website is a collection of related webpages, which are stored on a web server. A web server 
is a computer that delivers requested webpages to your computer or mobile device.
Web Browsing
A browser is software that enables users with an Internet connection to access and view 
­webpages on a computer or mobile device. Some widely used browsers include Internet 
Explorer, Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. Read How To 1 for instructions about using a 
browser to display a webpage on a computer or mobile device.

How To 2
Perform a Basic Web Search
The following steps describe how to use 
a search engine on a computer or mobile 
device to perform a basic web search:
1.	 Run a browser. (For instructions on 
­running programs and apps, see How To 3  
and How To 4 on page IT 27.)
2.	 If the browser does not contain a ­separate 
Search box near the address bar, display 
the search engine’s webpage on the 
screen by entering its web address in the 
address bar. For example, you could type   
google.com   to display the Google 
search engine,   bing.com    to display 
the Bing search engine, or   yahoo.com   
to display the Yahoo! search engine.
3.	 Tap or click the Search box and then type 
the desired search text in the Search box. 
The more descriptive the search text, the 
easier it will be to locate the desired search 
results. As the figure shows, the search 
engine may provide search text suggestions 
as you type search text in the Search box.
4.	 To display search results based on your 
typed search text, press the enter key 
or tap or click the Search button.  
To display search results based on one of 
the ­suggestions ­provided by the search 
engine, tap or click the desired search text 
suggestion.
5.	 Scroll through the search results and then 
tap or click a search result to display the 
corresponding webpage.
6.	 To return to the search results, tap or click 
the Back button in your browser, which 
­typically looks like a left-pointing arrow.

locate the admission criteria for your school? 
Web Searching
A primary reason that people use the web is to search for specific information, including text, 
­photos, music, and videos. The first step in successful searching is to identify the main idea or 
concept in the topic about which you are seeking information. Determine any synonyms, alternate 
spellings, or variant word forms for the topic. Then, use a search engine, such as Google, to help 
you locate the information. A search engine is software that finds websites, webpages, images, 
­videos, news, maps, and other information related to a specific topic. Read How To 2 for instruc-
tions about how to perform a basic web search using a search engine on a computer or mobile 
device.
Online Social Networks
An online social network, also called a social networking site, is a website that ­encourages 
members in its online community to share their interests, ideas, stories, photos, music, and 
videos with other registered users (Figure 27 on the next page). Popular social networking sites 
include Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. 
Some social networking sites have no specialized audience; others are more focused. A photo 
sharing site, for example, is a specific type of social networking site that allows users to create an 
online photo album and store and share their digital photos. Similarly, a video sharing site is a 
type of social networking site that enables users to store and share their personal videos.

CONSIDER THIS
How do Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn differ?
With Facebook, you share messages, interests, activities, events, photos, and other personal information — called  
posts — with family and friends. You also can ‘like’ pages of celebrities, companies, products, etc., so that posts on these 
pages appear on your Facebook page. With Twitter, you ‘follow’ people, companies, and organizations in which you have 
an interest. Twitter enables you to stay current with the daily activities of those you are following via their Tweets, which 
are short posts (messages) that Tweeters broadcast for all their followers. 
On LinkedIn, you share professional interests, education, and employment history, and add colleagues or coworkers 
to your list of contacts. You can include recommendations from people who know you professionally. Many employers 
post jobs using LinkedIn and consider information in your profile as your online resume.
Read Ethics & Issues 2 to consider whether employees should be held accountable for their social 
networking posts.
       Ethics & Issues 2
Should Employees Be Held Accountable 
for Their Social Networking Posts?
Companies no longer solely rely on a resume 
and interview to consider you as a potential 
employee. At a minimum, the hiring man-
ager may search the web to find out any 
information readily available about you. This 
includes your use of social networking or 
blogging sites, such as Facebook or Twitter. 
Once employed, your manager still may track 
and review your online presence. You might 
believe your posts and photos should be your 
own business. Some companies, however, 
feel that what you say and do online, as well 
as what others say about you, could reflect 
poorly on them and, thus, should affect your 
employment. These companies are worried 
not only about their reputations but also 
potential red flags. For example, companies 
may be on the lookout for employees who 
discuss company sales activity on their blogs, 
gripe about their managers on Twitter, or 
have Facebook photos that show them taking 
part in unethical, illegal, or unsavory activities. 
Social network-related firings have made 
headlines. Two examples include a CFO (chief 
financial officer) fired for blogging details 
about his publicly traded company and a 
teacher fired for making disparaging remarks 
on her Facebook page about students and 
their parents. Accessing an employee’s or 
a potential employee’s social networking 
profile also could have consequences for the 
company. For example, if a company realizes 
that a person is a member of a minority group 
or has a disability, the company could face 
discrimination charges if it does not hire or 
later fires the employee. Debate regarding 
what falls under free speech is ongoing. 
Remember that what you post online is not 
deleted easily. Whether or not you currently 
are searching for a job, online posts you make 
now can damage your future employment 
opportunities. 
What are the results when you search for 
yourself online? What steps can you take 
to clean up and protect your online repu-
tation? Would you share social networking 
accounts or passwords with an employer 
or potential employer? Why or why not? 
Should companies be allowed to view and 
monitor employees’ accounts? Why or 
why not?

Internet Communications
The web is only one of the services on the Internet. Some of the other services on the 
Internet facilitate communications among users:
•	Email allows you to send messages to and receive messages and files from other users via a 
computer network.
•	With instant messaging (IM), you can have a real-time typed conversation with another 
connected user (real-time means that both of you are online at the same time). 
•	VoIP enables users to speak to other users over the Internet.
•	With FTP, users can transfer items to and from other computers on the Internet.
Digital Security and Safety
People rely on computers to create, store, and manage their information. To safeguard this 
information, it is important that users protect their computers and mobile devices. Users also 
should be aware of health risks and environmental issues associated with using computers and 
mobile devices.
Viruses and Other Malware
Malware, short for malicious software, is software that acts without a user’s knowledge and 
deliberately alters the computer’s and mobile device’s operations. Examples of malware include 
viruses, worms, ­trojan horses, rootkits, spyware, adware, and zombies. Each of these types of 
malware attacks your computer or mobile device differently. Some are harmless pranks that 
temporarily freeze, play sounds, or display messages on your computer or mobile device. 
Others destroy or corrupt data, instructions, and information stored on the infected computer 
or mobile device. If you notice any unusual changes in the performance of your computer or 
mobile device, it may be infected with malware. Read Secure IT 2 for ways to protect comput-
ers from viruses and other malware.
Secure IT 2
Protection from Viruses 
and Other Malware
Although it is impossible to ensure a virus or 
malware never will attack a computer, you 
can take steps to protect your computer by 
following these practices:
•	 Use virus protection software. Install 
a reputable antivirus program and then 
scan the entire computer to be certain 
it is free of viruses and other malware. 
Update the antivirus program and the virus 
­signatures (known specific patterns of 
viruses) regularly.
•	 Use a firewall. Set up a hardware firewall 
or install a software firewall that protects your 
network’s resources from outside intrusions.
•	 Be suspicious of all unsolicited 
email attachments. Never open an 
email ­attachment unless you are expect-
ing it and  it is from a trusted source. 
When in doubt, ask the sender to confirm 
the ­attachment is legitimate before you 
open it. Delete or quarantine flagged 
­attachments immediately.
•	 Disconnect your computer from the 
Internet. If you do not need Internet 
access, disconnect the computer from the 
Internet. Some security experts recommend 
disconnecting from the computer network 
before opening email attachments.
•	 Download software with caution. 
Download programs or apps only from 
websites you trust, especially those with 
music and movie sharing software.
•	 Close spyware windows. If you suspect 
a pop-up window (rectangular area that 
suddenly appears on your screen) may be 
spyware, close the window. Never click 
an Agree or OK button in a suspicious 
window.
•	 Before using any removable media, 
scan it for malware. Follow this procedure 
even for shrink-wrapped software from major 
developers. Some commercial software has 
been infected and distributed to unsuspecting 
users. Never start a computer with removable 
media inserted in the computer unless you 
are certain the media are uninfected.
•	 Keep current. Install the latest updates 
for your computer software. Stay informed 
about new virus alerts and virus hoaxes.
•	 Back up regularly. In the event your 
computer becomes unusable due to a virus 
attack or other malware, you will be able 
to restore operations if you have a clean 
(uninfected) backup.
  What precautions do you take to prevent 
viruses and other malware from infecting your 
computer? What new steps will you take to 
attempt to protect your computer?

Privacy
Nearly every life event is stored in a computer somewhere . . . in medical records, credit 
reports, tax records, etc. In many instances, where personal and confidential records were not 
protected properly, individuals have found their privacy violated and identities stolen. Some 
techniques you can use to protect yourself from identity theft include shredding ­financial 
­documents before discarding them, never tapping or clicking links in unsolicited email 
­messages, and enrolling in a credit monitoring service.
Adults, teens, and children around the world are using online social networks to share 
their photos, videos, journals, music, and other personal information publicly. Some of these 
­unsuspecting, innocent computer users have fallen victim to crimes committed by dangerous 
strangers. Protect yourself and your dependents from these criminals by being cautious in 
email messages and on websites. For example, do not share information that would allow oth-
ers to identify or locate you and do not disclose identification numbers, user names, passwords, 
or other personal security details. A user name is a unique combination of characters, such 
as letters of the alphabet or numbers, that identifies one specific user. A password is a private 
combination of characters associated with a user name. Read Secure IT 3 for tips on creating 
strong ­passwords.
Internet Research
What are other techniques  
that deter identity theft?
Search for: prevent 
identity theft
Secure IT 3
Creating Strong Passwords
A good password is easy for you to remember 
but difficult for criminals and password- 
breaking software to guess. Use these guide-
lines to create effective, strong passwords:
•	 Personal information: Avoid using 
any part of your first or last name, your 
family members’ names, phone number, 
street ­address, license plate number, Social 
­Security number, or birth date.
•	 Length: Use at least eight characters.
•	 Difficulty: Use a variety of uppercase and 
lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, 
and symbols. Select characters located on 
different parts of the keyboard, not the ones 
you commonly use or that are ­adjacent 
to each other. Criminals use software that 
converts common words to symbols, so 
changing the word, two, to the numeral, 2, 
or the word, and, to the ampersand  
symbol, &, is not likely to foil a thief.
•	 Modify: Change the password frequently, 
at least every three months.
•	 Variation: Do not use the same password 
for all accounts. Once criminals have stolen 
a password, they attempt to use that 
password for other accounts they find on 
your computer or mobile device, especially 
banking websites.
•	 Passphrase: A passphrase, which is 
similar to a password, consists of several 
words separated by spaces. Security  
experts recommend misspelling a few of 
the words and adding several numerals. 
For example, the phrase, “Create a strong 
password,” could become the passphrase, 
“Creaet a strang pasword42.”
•	 Common sequences: Avoid numbers or 
letters in easily recognized patterns, such 
as “asdfjkl;,” “12345678,” “09870987,” 
or “abcdefg.” Also, do not spell words 
backwards or use common abbreviations.
•	 Test: Use online tools to evaluate 
­password strength.
  How strong are your passwords? How 
will you modify your passwords using some 
of these guidelines?
Health Concerns
Prolonged or improper computer use can lead to injuries or disorders of the hands, wrists, 
elbows, eyes, neck, and back. Computer users can protect themselves from these health risks 
through proper workplace design, good posture while at the computer, and appropriately 
spaced work breaks.
Two behavioral health risks are technology addiction and technology overload. Technology 
addiction occurs when someone becomes obsessed with using technology. Individuals suffering 
from technology overload feel distressed when deprived of computers and mobile devices. Once 
recognized, both technology addiction and technology overload are treatable disorders.
Environmental Issues
Manufacturing processes for computers and mobile devices along with e-waste, or discarded 
computers and mobile devices, are depleting natural resources and polluting the environ-
ment. When computers and mobile devices are stored in basements or other locations, dis-
posed in landfills, or burned in incinerators, they can release toxic materials and potentially 
dangerous levels of lead, mercury, and flame retardants.

Green computing involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste 
generated when using a computer. Strategies that support green computing include recycling, 
using energy efficient hardware and energy saving features, regulating manufacturing processes, 
extending the life of computers, and immediately donating or properly disposing of replaced 
computers. When you purchase a new computer, some retailers offer to dispose of your old 
computer properly.
CONSIDER THIS
How can you contribute to green computing?
Some habits you can alter that will help reduce the environmental impact of computing include the following:
  1.	 Do not leave a computer or device running overnight.
  2.	 Turn off your monitor, printer, and other devices when you are not using them.
  3.	 Use energy efficient hardware.
  4.	 Use paperless methods to communicate.
  5.	 Recycle paper and buy recycled paper.
  6.	 Recycle toner, computers, mobile devices, printers, and other devices.
  7.	 Telecommute.
  8.	 Use videoconferencing and VoIP for meetings.
Programs and Apps
Software, also called a program, consists of a series of related instructions, organized for a 
­common purpose, that tells the computer what tasks to perform and how to perform them. 
Two categories of software are system software and application software. System software 
­consists of the programs that control or 
maintain the operations of the computer 
and its devices. Operating systems are 
a widely recognized example of system 
software. Other types of system soft-
ware, sometimes called tools, enable you 
to perform maintenance-type tasks usu-
ally related to managing devices, media, 
and programs used by computers and 
mobile devices. The next sections dis-
cuss operating systems and application 
software.
Operating Systems
An operating system is a set of 
­programs that coordinates all the 
­activities among computer or mobile 
device hardware. It provides a means 
for users to communicate with the 
computer or mobile device and other 
software. Many of today’s comput-
ers and mobile devices use a ­version 
of Microsoft’s Windows, Apple’s Mac 
OS, Apple’s iOS, or Google’s Android 
(Figure 28). 
To use application software, your 
computer or mobile device must be 
running an operating system.

Applications
Application software, usually simply called an application (or app for short), consists of 
­programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal tasks. 
Browsers, discussed in an earlier section, are an example of an application that enables users 
with an Internet connection to access and view webpages. Table 1 identifies the categories of 
­applications with samples of ones commonly used in each category.
Applications include programs stored on a computer, as well as those on a mobile device or 
delivered to your device over the Internet. The term, desktop app, often is used to describe 
applications stored on a computer. The term, web app is an application stored on a web server 
that you access through a browser. A mobile app is an application you download from a mobile 
device’s application store or other location on the Internet to a smartphone or other mobile 
device. Some applications are available as both a web app and a mobile app.

Installing and Running Applications
Installing software is the process of setting up software to work with a computer, printer, 
and other hardware. When you buy a computer, it usually has some software such as an 
operating system preinstalled on its hard disk so that you can use the computer the first time 
you turn it on. Installed operating systems often include other programs such as a browser, 
media player, and calculator. To use additional desktop apps on a computer, you usually need 
to install the software. Mobile apps typically install automatically after you transfer the app’s 
files to your device from its website. You usually do not need to install web apps before you 
can run them. 
Once installed, you can run an application so that you can interact with it. When you instruct 
a computer or mobile device to run an application, the computer or mobile device loads its 
software, which means the application is copied from storage to memory. Once in memory, the 
computer or mobile device can carry out, or execute, the instructions in the application so that 
you can use it. 
You interact with a program or application through its user interface. The user interface 
­controls how you enter data and instructions and how information is displayed on the screen. 
Often, you work with icons or tiles (shown in Figure 28 on page IT 25), which are ­miniature 
images that link to programs, media, documents, or other objects. Read How To 3 for 
­instructions about locating, downloading, and installing applications; and read How To 4 for 
­instructions about ­locating, installing, and running mobile apps.
How To 3
Install, Run, and Exit  
an Application
The following steps describe how to install, 
run, and exit an application on a computer.
Locate the Application
•	 Locate the application to install. 
­Applications are available from retail stores, 
websites, and from other services such as 
Apple’s App Store or Google Play.
Download and/or Install the Application
•	 If you are installing an application from 
physical media such as a CD or DVD, 
insert the media in your computer. If the 
­installation does not start automatically, 
locate the installation program on the 
media and then double-tap or double-click 
the installation program.
•	 If the application is available from a 
­website or online store, download the 
­application to your computer. Once the 
download is complete, if the ­installation 
does not start automatically, locate and 
then double-tap or double-click the 
­downloaded file to begin the installation.
Run the Application
•	 You have various options for running an 
application:
’	 Tap or click the application’s tile 
or ­double-tap or double-click the 
­application’s icon in the desktop.
’	 Display a list of all applications on 
your computer and then tap or click 
the icon representing the application 
to run (some computers may require 
you to double-tap or double-click  
the icon).
’	 Use the search feature in the operating 
system to locate the newly installed 
application and then tap or click the 
search result to run the application.
Exit the Application
•	 Locate and tap or click an Exit or Close button 
or an Exit or Close command, which often can 
be found on an application’s File menu.
•	 Locate and tap or click the Close button on 
the application’s title bar (horizontal space 
at top of window).
  If you run a second application without 
first exiting the one you are using, how can 
you return to the first application?
How To 4
Locate, Install, and Run  
a Mobile App
The following steps describe how to locate, 
install, and run an app on a mobile device:
1.	 Navigate to the online store for your device. 
Common stores used to obtain apps include 
Apple’s App Store and Google Play.
2.	 Use the search feature to browse for the 
type of app you would like to download 
and install. If the app is not free, follow 
the payment instructions.
3.	 Tap or click the appropriate button to 
download the desired app. Depending 
on your device, you may need to enter 
additional information, such as a 
password, to download the app. Once 
the app downloads, it should install 
­automatically.
4.	 Locate the app’s icon on your device and 
then tap or click the icon to run the app. 
Depending on the app, you may have to 
­create a profile, which contains personal data 
about a user, or enter your email address.
  After installing an app on your device, 
what are some locations you might look to 
find the new app’s icon or tile?

CONSIDER THIS
How do you know if a program will run on your computer?
When you buy a computer, the box, the manufacturer’s website, or the order summary will list the computer’s 
specifications. Similarly, when you buy software, the software box or the product’s website will list specifications and 
minimum requirements for memory, speed, and more. Your computer’s specifications should be the same as or greater 
than the software specifications. Ensure the software will run on your computer before making a purchase, because 
many retailers will not allow you to return software. 
Developing Programs and Apps
A software developer, sometimes called an application developer or computer programmer, is 
someone who develops programs and apps or writes the instructions that direct the computer 
or mobile device to process data into information. When writing instructions, a developer must 
be sure the program or app works properly so that the computer or mobile device generates the 
desired results. Complex programs can require thousands to millions of instructions. 
Software developers use a programming language or program development tool to ­create 
computer ­programs and apps. Popular programming languages include C++, Java, JavaScript, 
Visual C#, and Visual Basic. Figure 29 shows some of the Visual Basic instructions a 
­programmer may write to create a simple payroll program.

Communications and Networks
Communications technologies are everywhere. Many require that you subscribe to an Internet 
service provider. With others, an organization such as a business or school provides communi-
cations services to employees, students, or customers. 
In the course of a day, it is likely you use, or use information generated by, one or more of 
the communications technologies in Table 2.
NOW YOU KNOW
Be sure you understand the material presented in the sections titled The Internet, Digital Security and Safety, and 
Programs and Apps, as it relates to the chapter objectives.
You now should know . . .
•	 Why webpages use links (Objective 5)

Wired and Wireless Communications
Computer ­communications describes a ­process 
in which two or more computers or devices 
transfer (send and receive) data, instructions, 
and ­information over transmission media via a 
­communications device(s). A ­communications 
device is ­hardware capable of ­transferring items 
from ­computers and devices to transmission media 
and vice versa. Examples of ­communications devices 
are modems, wireless access points, and routers. As 
shown in Figure 30, some communications involve 
cables and wires; others are sent wirelessly through 
the air.
Wired communications often use some form of 
telephone ­wiring, coaxial cable, or fiber-optic cables 
to send communications signals. The wiring or 
cables ­typically are used within buildings or under-
ground between buildings.
Because it is more convenient than installing 
wires and cables, many users opt for wireless 
communications, which sends signals through 
the air or space. Examples of wireless commu-
nications technologies include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular radio:
•	 Wi-Fi uses radio signals to provide high-speed Internet and network connections to computers 
and devices capable of communicating via Wi-Fi. Most computers and many mobile devices, 
such as smartphones and portable media players, can connect to a Wi-Fi network.
•	Bluetooth uses short-range radio signals to enable Bluetooth-enabled computers and devices 
to communicate with each other. For example, Bluetooth headsets allow you to connect a 
Bluetooth-enabled phone to a headset wirelessly.

•	 Cellular radio uses the cellular network to enable high-speed Internet connections to devices 
with built-in compatible technology, such as smartphones. Cellular network providers use the 
categories 3G, 4G, and 5G to denote cellular transmission speeds, with 5G being the fastest.
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both hot spot technologies. A hot spot is a wireless network that 
­provides Internet connections to mobile computers and devices. Wi-Fi hot spots provide ­wireless 
network connections to users in public locations such as airports and airplanes, train stations, hotels, 
convention centers, schools, campgrounds, marinas, shopping malls, bookstores, libraries, restau-
rants, coffee shops, and more. Bluetooth hot spots provide location-based ­services, such as sending 
coupons or menus, to users whose Bluetooth-enabled devices enter the coverage range. Read Secure 
IT 4 for tips on protecting your personal data while using a ­public hot spot.
Secure IT 4
Using Public Wi-Fi Hot Spots Safely
Connecting wirelessly to a public hot spot 
at your local coffee shop or at the airport 
can be convenient and practical. Using this 
free service can be risky, however, because 
cybercriminals lurk in these areas hoping 
to gain access to confidential ­information 
on your computer or mobile device. Follow 
these guidelines for a safer browsing 
­experience:
•	 Avoid typing passwords and 
­financial information. Identity thieves 
are on the lookout for people who sign 
in to accounts, enter their credit card 
account numbers in shopping websites, 
or conduct online banking transactions. If 
you must type this personal information, 
be certain the web address begins with 
“https,” not “http.” If the web address 
changes to “http,” sign out of (end your 
Internet session) immediately.
•	 Sign out of websites. When finished 
using an account, sign out of it and close 
the window.
•	 Disable your wireless connection. If 
you have finished working online but still 
need to use the computer, disconnect from 
the wireless connection.
•	 Do not leave the computer 
­unattended. It may seem obvious, but 
always stay with your computer or mobile 
device. Turning your back to talk with a 
friend or to refill your coffee gives thieves 
a few seconds to steal sensitive informa-
tion that may be displayed on the screen.
•	 Beware of over-the-shoulder 
snoopers. The person sitting behind you 
may be watching or using a camera phone 
to record your keystrokes, read your email 
messages and social networking posts, 
and view your photos and videos.
  How will you apply these precautions 
the next time you use a public Wi-Fi hot 
spot? Should businesses post signs alerting 
customers about Wi-Fi security issues?

Networks
A network is a collection of computers and 
devices connected together, often wirelessly, via 
­communications devices and transmission media. 
Networks allow computers to share resources, such as 
hardware, software, data, and information. Sharing 
resources saves time and money. In many ­networks, 
one or more computers act as a server. The server 
controls access to the resources on a network. The 
other computers on the network, each called a client, 
request resources from the server (Figure 31). The 
major differences between the server and client com-
puters are that the server typically has more power, 
more storage space, and expanded ­communications 
capabilities. 
Many homes and most businesses and schools 
­network their computers and devices. Most allow users 
to connect their computers wirelessly to the network.

A server manages the resources on a network, and 
clients access the resources on the server. This network enables three 
separate computers to share the same printer, one wirelessly.

Users often are required to sign in to, or log on, a network, which means they enter a user 
name and password (or other credentials) to access the network and its resources. 
Home Networks  Home networks save the home user money and provide many conveniences. 
Each networked computer or mobile device on a home network has the following capabilities:
•	 Connect to the Internet at the same time
•	 Share a single high-speed Internet connection
•	 Access photos, music, videos, and other content on computers and devices throughout the house
•	 Share devices such as a printer, scanner, or external hard disk
•	 Play multiplayer games with players on other computers and mobile devices in the house
•	 Connect game consoles to the Internet
•	 Subscribe to and use VoIP
Home networks usually are small, existing within a single structure, and use wireless ­technologies 
such as those shown in Figure 30 on page IT 29. You do not need extensive ­knowledge of ­networks 
to set up a home network. You will need a communications device, such as a router, which ­usually 
includes setup instructions. Most operating systems also provide tools enabling you easily to 
­connect all the computers and devices in your house.
Business Networks 
Business and school networks can be small, such as in a room or 
building, or widespread, connecting computers and devices across a city, country, or the 
globe. Some reasons that businesses network their computers and devices together include 
the following:
•	Facilitate communications. Using a network, employees and customers communicate 
efficiently and easily via email, instant messaging, blogs, online social networks, video calls, 
online meetings, video conferencing, VoIP, wireless messaging services, and more.
•	Share hardware. In a networked environment, each computer on the network can access the hardware 
on the network, instead of providing each user with the same piece of hardware. For example, computer 
and mobile device users can access the laser printer on the network, as they need it.
•	Share data, information, and software. In a networked environment, any authorized 
computer user can access data, information, and software stored on other computers on the 
network. A large company, for example, might have a database of customer information that 
any authorized user can access.
Uses of Technology in Society
Technology has changed society today as much as the industrial revolution changed society in 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. People interact directly with technology in fields such 
as education, government, finance, retail, entertainment, health care, travel, science, publishing, 
and manufacturing. 
Education
Educators and teaching institutions use technology to assist with education. Most equip labs 
and classrooms with computers. Some even provide computers to students. Many require ­students 
to have a mobile computer or mobile device to access the school’s network or Internet wirelessly, 
or to access digital-only content provided by a textbook publisher. To promote ­education by 
­computer, vendors often offer substantial student discounts on hardware and ­software.
Educators may use an interactive whiteboard, which is a touch-sensitive device resembling 
a dry-erase board, that displays images on a connected computer screen. They also may use a 
course management system, sometimes called a learning management system, which is software 
that contains tools for class preparation, distribution, and management. Read Ethics & Issues 3 
on the next page to consider issues related to schools integrating technology into the classroom.
Many schools offer distance learning classes, where the delivery of education occurs at one 
place while the learning occurs at other locations.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Government
Most government offices have websites to provide citizens with up-to-date information. 
People in the United States access government websites to view census data, file taxes, apply for 
permits and licenses, pay parking tickets, buy stamps, report crimes, apply for financial aid, and 
renew vehicle registrations and driver’s licenses. 
Employees of government agencies use computers as part of their daily routine. 
North American 911 call centers use computers to dispatch calls for fire, police, and medical 
assistance. Military and other agency officials use the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security’s network of information about domestic security threats to help protect against 
terrorist attacks. Law enforcement officers have online access to the FBI’s National 
Crime Information Center (NCIC) through in-vehicle laptops, fingerprint readers, and 
mobile devices.
Finance
Many people and companies use online banking or finance software to pay bills, track 
­personal income and expenses, manage investments, and evaluate financial plans. The difference 
between using a financial institutions’ website versus finance software on your computer is that 
all your account information is stored on the bank’s computer instead of your computer. The 
advantage is you can access your financial records from anywhere in the world. 
Investors often use online investing to buy and sell stocks and bonds — without using a 
­broker. With online investing, the transaction fee for each trade usually is much less than when 
trading through a broker.
Retail
You can purchase just about any product or service on the web, including groceries, 
­flowers, books, computers and mobile devices, music, movies, airline tickets, and concert 
tickets. To ­purchase from an online retailer, a customer visits the business’s storefront, 
which contains ­product descriptions, images, and a shopping cart. The shopping cart 
allows the customer to collect purchases. When ready to complete the sale, the customer 
enters personal data and the method of payment, which should be through a secure 
Internet connection. Figure 32 ­illustrates the steps involved when a customer purchases 
from an online retailer.
Ethics & Issues 3
Does Technology Create  
a Divide between the More  
and Less Fortunate? 
A teacher assigns a research paper that 
requires students to read several articles on 
the web. A school requires that all students 
type papers on a computer and submit 
the papers using email. While these may 
be valid ways to integrate technology in a 
curriculum or to help instructors manage 
their classroom, they assume all students 
have ample access to technology outside 
of school. School districts that assume all 
students have computers at home place less 
fortunate students at a further disadvantage. 
These students may have to stay after school 
to use a computer or study at the local 
library to access the Internet. Students at 
school districts in disadvantaged areas may 
fall further behind if the school is unable to 
provide access to the technology taken for 
granted at other schools, including interactive 
whiteboards and ­dedicated technology spe-
cialists. These discrepancies are known col-
lectively as the digital divide, a term used 
to illustrate the gap between those with 
and without access to technology. 
With the recent widespread growth of 
mobile device users, some aspects of the 
digital divide are closing. Students can email 
and do research on Internet-capable mobile 
devices, as well as access education-related 
apps. Mobile device capabilities, however, 
are limited. You cannot use a mobile device 
to write a research paper, prepare a resume, 
or submit a college application. Some 
companies and organizations are trying to 
provide better access. One cable company 
provides low-cost Internet access to families 
who receive free or reduced school lunches. 
Schools can apply for technology grants to 
purchase classroom computers. These grants 
may be able to provide access to students, 
but if no one can teach the students or their 
teachers how to use the technology, it may 
not solve the problem. 
Is it the school’s responsibility to provide 
an even playing field regarding technology 
access? Why or why not? Should schools 
be allowed to require students to use tech-
nology? Why or why not? What steps can 
­society take to narrow the digital divide?

Purchasing from an Online Retailer
Step 3
The customer enters 
payment information
on a secure website. 
The online retailer 
sends ﬁnancial 
information to a bank.
Step 4
The bank performs 
security checks and 
sends authorization 
back to the online 
retailer.
Step 5
The online retailer’s web server
sends conﬁrmation to the customer, 
processes the order, and then sends
it to the fulﬁllment center.
Step 6
The fulﬁllment center packages the 
order, prepares it for shipment, and 
then sends a report to the server where 
records are updated.
Step 7
While the order travels to the customer,
shipping information is posted on the web.
Step 8
The order is delivered to the 
customer, who may be required
to sign a handheld computer or 
document to acknowledge receipt.
Step 2
The customer 
collects 
purchases in
a shopping cart.
Step 1
The customer 
displays
the online
retailer’s 
storefront.
Many mobile apps make your shopping experience more convenient. Some enable you to 
manage rewards, use coupons, locate stores, or pay for goods and services directly from your 
phone or other mobile device. Other mobile apps will check a product’s price and availability at 
stores in your local area or online.
Entertainment
You can use computers and mobile devices to listen to audio clips or live audio; watch video clips, 
television shows, or live performances and events; read a book, magazine, or newspaper; and play a 
myriad of games individually or with others. In some cases, you download the media from the web to 
a computer or mobile device so that you can watch, listen to, view, or play later. Some websites support 
streaming, where you access the media content while it downloads. For example, radio and televi-
sion broadcasts often use streaming media to broadcast music, interviews, talk shows, sporting events, 
news, and other segments so that you can listen to the audio or view the video as it downloads to your 
computer. You also can create videos, take photos, or record audio and upload (transfer) your media 
content to the web to share with others, such as on an online social network.
CONSIDER THIS
Can I make copies of songs or other media that I have purchased and downloaded from a 
­legitimate website, such as iTunes?
You typically can make a copy as a personal backup, but you cannot share the copy with others in any format unless 
you have legal permission from the copyright owner to do so. That is, you cannot give someone a CD copy, nor can 
you share a digital file by posting it on the web or sending it in an email attachment.

Health Care
Nearly every area of health care today uses computers. Whether you are visiting a family 
­doctor for a regular checkup, having lab work or an outpatient test, filling a prescription, or 
being rushed in for emergency surgery, the medical staff around you will be using computers 
for various purposes:
•  Maintain and access patient records.
•  Monitor patients’ vital signs and manage health conditions, such as diabetes.
•  Deliver medication to nurses’ stations in hospitals.
• Assist doctors, nurses, and technicians with medical tests.
• Assist with researching and diagnosing health conditions.
•  Communications services to correspond with patients.
•  Refill and file insurance claims.
•  Implanted computerized devices, such as pacemakers, allow patients to live longer.
•  Computer-controlled devices to provide surgeons with greater precision during operations.
Travel
Whether traveling by car or plane, your goal is to arrive safely at your destination. As you 
make the journey, you may interact with a navigation system or GPS, which uses satellite sig-
nals to determine a geographic location. GPS technology also assists people with creating maps, 
determining the best route between two points, locating a lost person or stolen object, monitor-
ing a person’s or object’s movement, determining altitude, calculating speed, and finding points 
of interest.
In preparing for a trip, you may need to reserve a car, hotel, or flight. Many websites offer 
these services to the public where you can search for and compare flights and prices, order 
airline tickets, or reserve a rental car. You also can print driving directions and maps from 
the web.
Science
All branches of science, from biology to astronomy to meteorology, use computers to 
assist them with collecting, analyzing, and modeling data. Scientists also use the Internet to 
communicate with colleagues around the world. Breakthroughs in surgery, medicine, and 
treatments often result from scientists’ use of computers. Tiny computers now imitate functions 
of the central nervous system, retina of the eye, and cochlea of the ear. A cochlear implant 
allows a deaf person to listen. Electrodes implanted in the brain stop tremors associated with 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Publishing
Many publishers of books, magazines, newspapers, music, film, and video make their works 
available online. Organizations and individuals publish their thoughts and ideas using a blog, 
podcast, or wiki.
•	 A blog is an informal website consisting of time-stamped articles (posts) in a diary or journal 
format, usually listed in reverse chronological order. 
•	A podcast is recorded media that users can download or stream to a computer or portable 
media player.
•	A wiki is a collaborative website that allows users to create, add to, modify, or delete the 
content via their browser. Read Ethics & Issues 4 for an issue related to using wikis as a 
source for research.

Manufacturing
Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) refers to the use of computers to assist with 
manufacturing processes such as fabrication and assembly. Industries use CAM to reduce 
product development costs, shorten a product’s time to market, and stay ahead of the 
competition. Often, robots carry out processes in a CAM environment. CAM is used by a 
variety of industries, including oil drilling, power generation, food production, and auto-
mobile manufacturing. Automobile plants, for example, have an entire line of industrial 
robots that assemble a car. 
Technology Users
Every day, people around the world use various technologies at home, at work, and at school. 
Depending on the hardware, software, and communications requirements, these users generally 
can be classified in one of five categories. Keep in mind that a single user may fall into more 
than one category.
• A home user is any person who spends time using technology at home. Parents, children, 
teenagers, grandparents, singles, couples, etc., are all examples of home users.
• A small/home office user includes employees of companies with fewer than 50 employees, 
as well as the self-employed who work from home. Small offices include local law practices, 
accounting offices, travel agencies, and florists.
• A mobile user includes any person who works with computers or mobile devices while away from 
a main office, home, or school. Examples of mobile users are sales representatives, real estate 
agents, insurance agents, meter readers, package delivery people, journalists, consultants, and 
students. 
•  A power user is a user who requires the capabilities of a powerful computer. Examples 
of power users include engineers, scientists, architects, desktop publishers, and graphic 
artists. 
•  An enterprise has hundreds or thousands of employees or customers who work in or 
do business with offices across a region, the country, or the world. Each employee or 
customer who uses computers, mobile devices, and other technology in the enterprise is 
an enterprise user.
Ethics & Issues 4
Should Wikis Be Allowed as Valid 
Sources for Academic Research? 
As wikis have grown in number, size, and 
popularity, many educators and librarians 
have shunned the sites as valid sources of 
research. While some wikis are tightly con-
trolled with a limited number of contributors 
and expert editors, these usually focus on 
narrowly defined, specialized topics. Most 
large online wikis, such as Wikipedia, often 
involve thousands of editors, many of whom 
remain anonymous. 
Critics of wikis cite the lack of certified 
academic credentials by the editors, as well 
as political or gender bias by contributors. 
Wikis also are subject to vandalism. Vandals’ 
motives vary; some enter false information to 
discredit the wiki, and others for humorous 
results. On occasion, rival political factions 
have falsified or embellished wiki entries in an 
attempt to give their candidate an advantage. 
Some wiki supporters argue that most wikis 
provide adequate controls to correct false 
or misleading content quickly and to punish 
those who submit it. One popular wiki now 
requires an experienced editor to verify 
changes made to certain types of articles. 
Other wiki protection methods include 
locking articles from editing, creating a list of 
recently edited articles, enabling readers to 
report vandalism, and allowing people to be 
notified about changes to a wiki page that 
they have edited or that is about them. Some 
proponents propose that people should use 
wikis as a starting point for researching a 
fact, but that they should verify the fact using 
traditional sources. 
Should instructors allow wikis as valid sources 
for academic research? Why or why not? 
Would you submit a paper to your instructor 
that cites a wiki as a source? Why or why not? 
What policies might wikis enforce that could 
garner more confidence from the public? If a 
wiki provided verification of the credentials 
of the author, would you trust the wiki more? 
Why or why not?

 Chapter Summary
This chapter introduced you to basic computer concepts. You learned about laptops, tablets, 
­desktops, servers, smartphones, digital cameras, portable media players, e-book readers, and 
game devices. The chapter introduced various methods for input, output, memory, and storage. 
It discussed the Internet, browsing and searching the web, and online social networks. Next, the 
chapter introduced digital security and safety risks and precautions, along with various types of 
programs, applications, communications, and networks. The many different uses of technology 
applications in society also were presented, along with types of users. 
Health Care
During an intramural volleyball game, you 
suffer an injury that requires a trip to an emer-
gency room, which is extremely crowded. Upon 
check-in, the employee at the front desk uses 
a computer to record your personal data and 
symptoms. She also uses the computer to verify 
that your insurance coverage is current and 
informs you of your co-payment amount. After 
waiting several minutes, a triage nurse takes 
your temperature and blood pressure and then 
asks a series of questions about your symp-
toms. The nurse also records this data in a tab-
let and asks you to remain in the waiting room 
until someone from the radiology department 
is available to perform a CT scan. The radiology 
department is located in a different area of the 
hospital, so the technicians watch a computer 
screen that displays a list of patients who cur-
rently are waiting for their services.
About 30 minutes later, a technician calls 
your name and escorts you to the radiology 
department for your CT scan. As she is 
performing the scan, a computer records 
the images that later will be reviewed by a 
physician. When the CT scan is complete, you 
return to the waiting room until a physician 
reviews the results. Once he receives the 
results and reviews them, a hospital employee 
takes you to a consultation room. 
The physician informs you that other than a 
few bumps and bruises, he believes that you 
have sustained no permanent damage and 
prescribes medication to help ease the pain. 
He then returns to a computer at the nurses’ 
station and adds his diagnosis to the database 
that stores your medical records. He also sends 
your prescription electronically to the hospital’s 
pharmacy. Once discharged, 
you visit the cashier to pay 
the bill. You then use a tablet 
to sign an electronic version 
of your discharge paperwork 
so that the hospital can 
store it electronically. The 
hospital bills your insurance 
company electronically. If 
you owe a balance after the 
insurance company pays 
its portion, a computer at 
the hospital will generate 
a bill that will be mailed 
to you. After purchasing your medication and 
leaving the hospital, you realize that despite the 
hospital being busy, computers decreased the 
time of your visit by automating processes that 
otherwise would have been performed manually 
and reduced possible errors by storing all of your 
personal information centrally.

Secure It 1 on page 18 discusses the benefits of 
creating a backup plan for computers and mobile 
devices. One backup method is subscribing to a cloud 
storage provider. Consumer subscriptions to cloud 
storage services are experiencing double-digit growth 
each year, with an estimated 1.3 billion users predicted 
by 2017. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple are 
among the many ­companies offering cloud storage 
­services.  
   Locate ­information about two of these ­services 
and review the features. Then, locate at least 
two independent cloud service providers, such as 
JustCloud, and read about accounts. How much free 
storage is available? What is the charge for additional 
storage? Are both limited and unlimited storage plans 
available? What is the maximum individual file size 
allowed? What methods do these companies take to 
secure the files? For example, how do they check the 
authenticity of the person ­signing in to the account? 
How do they monitor suspicious activity? Do they 
allow users to review all the ­sign-ins within a set 
period of time? Do they require account holders to 
modify their passwords occasionally? Is live customer 
support available 24 hours each day at no charge? In 
which country is the company and server located?

The Problem Solving exercises extend your 
knowledge of chapter concepts by ­seeking solutions 
to practical problems with technology that you may 
encounter at home, school, or work.
Instructions: You often can solve problems with technology in 
multiple ways. Determine a solution to the problems in these 
exercises by using one or more resources available to you (such 
as a computer or mobile device, articles on the web or in print, 
blogs, podcasts, videos, ­television, user guides, other individu-
als, electronics or computer stores, etc.). Describe your solution, 
along with the resource(s) used, in the format requested by your 
instructor (brief report, presentation, discussion, blog post, video, 
or other means).
	 1.	Shopping for Software  You are shopping for 
software that will assist you with your home’s 
interior design. The package for the program you 
would like to purchase states that it was designed for 
the most recent version of Windows, but an older 
version is installed on your computer. How can you 
determine whether the program will run on your 
computer?
	
2.	Bad Directions  You are driving 
to your friend’s house and are 
using your smartphone for 
directions. While approaching 
your destination, you realize that 
your smartphone app instructed 
you to turn the wrong way on your 
friend’s street. How could this have 
happened?
	
3.	Problematic Camera  After 
charging your digital camera 
battery overnight, you insert the 
battery and turn on the camera 
only to find that it is reporting 
	 	  a low battery. Seconds later, the camera shuts off 
automatically. What might be wrong?
	 4.	Discarding Old Computer Equipment  Your 
company has given you a new laptop to replace your 
current, outdated desktop. Because of the negative 
environmental impact of discarding the old computer 
in the trash, your supervisor asked you to suggest 
options for its disposal. How will you respond?
	 5.	Dead Battery  While traveling for business, you 
realize that you forgot to bring the battery charger for 
your laptop. Knowing that you need to use the laptop to 
give a presentation tomorrow, what steps will you take 
tonight to make sure you have enough battery power?
 Critical Thinking
The Critical Thinking exercises challenge your assessment 
and decision-making skills by presenting real-world  
situations associated with chapter concepts.
Instructions: Evaluate the situations below, using personal 
experiences and one or more resources available to you (such as 
articles on the web or in print, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, 
user guides, other individuals, electronics or computer stores, etc.). 
Perform the tasks requested in each exercise and share your deliver-
ables in the format requested by your instructor (brief report, presen-
tation, discussion, blog post, video, or other means). 
1. Research and Share 
Energy Efficiency  Increases in energy prices lead 
many individuals to look at purchasing energy-efficient 
computers. Energy-efficient computers often look and 
perform similarly to equivalent computers that use more 
energy. Find two computers of identical configuration, 
where the only difference is energy consumption. How 
much energy does the energy-efficient computer save? 
Are energy-efficient computers more or less expensive? 
Will the difference in cost (if any) affect your purchasing 
decision? How else might you be able to change your 
computer to save energy? Use the web to locate articles 
that recommend energy efficient products and that 
provide tips about additional ways to save energy. Compile 
your findings and then share them with the class.
2.	Case Study 
Farmers’ Market  You are the new manager for a 
group of organic farmers who have a weekly market in 
season. The previous manager tracked all of the data on 
paper. You realize that using technology will increase 
your efficiency and enable you to communicate better 
with the board of directors, vendors, and customers. 
At the board’s next meeting, you will share ideas of 
how you will use technology. Before the meeting, 
you compile the following: differences between input 
and output, a list of the types of data you can use 
as input, and a list of the 
types of information you 
can produce as output. 
You include the types of 
computers, mobile devices, 
and other technologies you 
will use to enter data and 
produce the information. 
Incorporate your own 
experiences and user 
reviews of the devices. 
Compile your findings.

Introduction to the Windows 8 
Operating System
Windows 8 is the newest version of Microsoft Windows, which is a popular and 
widely used operating system. An operating system is a computer program (set 
of computer instructions) that coordinates all the activities of computer hardware,

such as memory, storage devices, and printers, and provides the capability for you to 
communicate with the computer. 
The Windows operating system simplifies the process of working with 
documents and apps by organizing the manner in which you interact with the 
computer. Windows is used to run apps. An app (short for application) consists of 
programs designed to make users more productive and/or assist them with personal 
tasks, such as word processing or browsing the web. 
The Windows 8 interface begins with the Start screen, which shows tiles 
(Figure 1). A tile is a shortcut to an app or other content. The tiles on the Start screen 
include installed apps that you use regularly. From the Start screen, you can choose 
which apps to run using a touch screen, mouse, or other input device. 
Using a Touch Screen and a Mouse
Windows users who have computers or devices with touch screen capability can 
interact with the screen using gestures. A gesture is a motion you make on a touch 
screen with the tip of one or more fingers or your hand. Touch screens are convenient 
because they do not require a separate device for input. Table 1 on the next page presents 
common ways to interact with a touch screen.
Figure 1
Start screen
app tiles
If you are using your 
finger on a touch screen 
and are having difficulty 
completing the steps in 
this chapter, consider 
using a stylus. Many 
people find it easier to 
be precise with a stylus 
than with a finger. In 
addition, with a stylus 
you see the pointer. 
If you still are having 
trouble completing the 
steps with a stylus, try 
using a mouse.

Will your screen look different if you are using a touch screen?
The Windows and Microsoft Office interface varies slightly if you are using a touch screen. For this reason, you might notice 
that your screen looks slightly different from the screens in this chapter. 
CONSIDER THIS
Windows users who do not have touch screen capabilities typically work with a 
mouse that has at least two buttons. For a right-handed user, the left button usually is 
the primary mouse button, and the right mouse button is the secondary mouse button. 
Left-handed people, however, can reverse the function of these buttons. 
Table 2 explains how to perform a variety of mouse operations. Some apps also 
use keys in combination with the mouse to perform certain actions. For example, when 
you hold down the ctrl key while rolling the mouse wheel, text on the screen may 
become larger or smaller based on the direction you roll the wheel. The function of 
the mouse buttons and the wheel varies depending on the app.

Keyboard Shortcuts
In many cases, you can use the keyboard instead of the mouse to accomplish 
a task. To perform tasks using the keyboard, you press one or more keyboard keys, 
sometimes identified as a keyboard shortcut. Some keyboard shortcuts consist of a 
single key, such as the f1 key. For example, to obtain help in many apps, you can press 
the f1 key. Other keyboard shortcuts consist of multiple keys, in which case a plus 
sign separates the key names, such as ctrl+esc. This notation means to press and 
hold down the first key listed, press one or more additional keys, and then release all 
keys. For example, to display the Start screen, press ctrl+esc, that is, hold down the 
ctrl key, press the esc key, and then release both keys.
Starting Windows
It is not unusual for multiple people to use the same computer in a work, 
educational, recreational, or home setting. Windows enables each user to establish a 
user account, which identifies to Windows the resources, such as apps and storage 
locations, a user can access when working with the computer. 
Each user account has a user name and may have a password and an icon, as 
well. A user name is a unique combination of letters or numbers that identifies a 
specific user to Windows. A password is a private combination of letters, numbers, and 
special characters associated with the user name that allows access to a user’s account 
resources. An icon is a small image that represents an object, thus a user icon is a 
picture associated with a user name. 
When you turn on a computer, Windows starts and displays a lock screen 
consisting of the time and date (Figure 3a). To unlock the screen, swipe up or click the 
lock screen. Depending on your computer’s settings, Windows may or may not display 
a sign-in screen that shows the user names and user icons for users who have accounts 
on the computer (Figure 3b). This sign-in screen enables you to sign in to your user 
account and makes the computer available for use. Tapping or clicking the user icon 
begins the process of signing in, also called logging on, to your user account.
At the bottom of the sign-in screen is the ‘Ease of access’ button and a Shut 
down button. Tapping or clicking the ‘Ease of access’ button displays the Ease of 
access menu, which provides tools to optimize a computer to accommodate the needs 
of the mobility, hearing, and vision impaired users. Tapping or clicking the Shut down

Microsoft Office 2013 Suites
A suite is a collection of individual apps available together as a unit. Microsoft 
offers a variety of Office suites, including a stand-alone desktop app (boxed software), 
Microsoft Office 365, and Microsoft Office Web Apps. Microsoft Office 365, or 
Office 365, provides plans that allow organizations to use Office in a mobile setting 
while also being able to communicate and share files, depending upon the type of plan 
selected by the organization. Microsoft Office Web Apps, or Web Apps, are apps that 
allow you to edit and share files on the web using the familiar Office interface. Table 3 
on the next page outlines the differences among these Office suites.

During the Office 365 installation, you select a plan, and depending on your plan, 
you receive different apps and services. Office Web Apps do not require a local installation 
and are accessed through SkyDrive and your browser. SkyDrive is a cloud storage service

•	Sign in to SkyDrive using your new account or use it in Office to save your files on SkyDrive.
CONSIDER THIS
Apps in a suite, such as Microsoft Office, typically use a similar interface and 
share features. Once you are comfortable working with the elements and the interface 
and performing tasks in one app, the similarity can help you apply the knowledge and 
skills you have learned to another app(s) in the suite. For example, the process for saving 
a file in Word is the same in PowerPoint, Excel, and the other Office apps. While briefly 
showing how to use several Office apps, this chapter illustrates some of the common 
functions across the apps and identifies the characteristics unique to these apps.
Running and Using an App
To use an app, you must instruct the operating system to run the app. Windows provides 
many different ways to run an app, one of which is presented in this section (other ways to 
run an app are presented throughout this chapter). After an app is running, you can use it 
to perform a variety of tasks. The following pages use Word to discuss some elements of 
the Office interface and to perform tasks that are common to other Office apps.
Word 
Word is a full-featured word processing app that allows you to create many types 
of personal and business documents, including flyers, letters, memos, resumes, reports, 
fax cover sheets, mailing labels, and newsletters. Word also provides tools that enable 
you to create webpages and save these webpages directly on a web server. Word has 
many features designed to simplify the production of documents and add visual appeal. 
Using Word, you easily can change the shape, size, and color of text. You also can include 
borders, shading, tables, images, pictures, charts, and web addresses in documents.

To Run an App from the Start Screen
The Start screen contains tiles that allow you to run apps, some of which may be stored on your computer. 
Why? When you install an app, for example, tiles are added to the Start screen for the various Office apps included in the suite.
The following steps, which assume Windows is running, use the Start screen to run an Office app based on 
a typical installation. You may need to ask your instructor how to run an Office app on your computer. Although 
the steps illustrate running the Word app, the steps to run any Office app are similar. If you are using Windows 7, 
skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

Why does my Start screen look 
different? 
It may look different because of 
your computer’s configuration. 
The Start screen may be 
customized for several reasons, 
such as usage requirements or 
security restrictions.
What if the app I want to run is 
not on the Start screen? 
You can display all installed apps 
by swiping up from the bottom of 
the Start screen or right-clicking 
an open space on the Start screen 
and then tapping or clicking the 
All apps button on the App bar.

Windows Desktop
When you run an app in Windows, it may appear in an on-screen work area app, 
called the desktop (shown in Figure 8). You can perform tasks such as placing objects in 
the desktop, moving the objects around the desktop, and removing items from the desktop. 
Some icons also may be displayed in the desktop. For instance, the icon for the 
Recycle Bin, the location of files that have been deleted, appears in the desktop by 
default. A file is a named unit of storage. Files can contain text, images, audio, and 
video. You can customize your desktop so that icons representing apps and files you use 
often appear in the desktop. 
To Switch between an App  
and the Start Screen
While working with an app or in the desktop, you easily can return to the Start screen. The following 
steps switch from the desktop to the Start screen. Why? Returning to the Start screen allows you to run any of your 
other apps. If you are using Windows 7, read these steps without performing them because Windows 7 does not

Word Document Window, Ribbon,  
and Elements Common to Office Apps
The Word window consists of a variety of components to make your work more 
efficient and documents more professional. These include the document window, 
ribbon, mini toolbar, shortcut menus, Quick Access Toolbar, and Microsoft Account 
area. Most of these components are common to other Microsoft Office apps; others 
are unique to Word.
You view a portion of a document on the screen through a document window 
(Figure 12). The default (preset) view is Print Layout view, which shows the 
document on a mock sheet of paper in the document window.
Scroll Bars  You use a scroll bar to display different portions of a document in the 
document window. At the right edge of the document window is a vertical scroll bar. 
If a document is too wide to fit in the document window, a horizontal scroll bar also 
appears at the bottom of the document window. On a scroll bar, the position of the 
scroll box reflects the location of the portion of the document that is displayed in the 
document window. 
Status Bar  The status bar, located at the bottom of the document window above 
the Windows taskbar, presents information about the document, the progress of 
current tasks, and the status of certain commands and keys; it also provides controls for 
viewing the document. As you type text or perform certain tasks, various indicators and 
buttons may appear on the status bar.

To Maximize a Window
Sometimes content is not visible completely in a window. One method of displaying the entire contents 
of a window is to maximize it, or enlarge the window so that it fills the entire screen. The following step 
maximizes the Word window; however, any Office app’s window can be maximized using this step. Why? 
A maximized window provides the most space available for using the app.

Word and other Office apps determine when tool tabs should appear and disappear 
based on tasks you perform. Some tool tabs, such as the TABLE TOOLS tab, have 
more than one related subordinate tab.
Items on the ribbon include buttons, 
boxes, and galleries (shown in Figure 13 
on the previous page). A gallery is a set of 
choices, often graphical, arranged in a grid or 
in a list. You can scroll through choices in an 
in-ribbon gallery by tapping or clicking the 
gallery’s scroll arrows. Or, you can tap or click 
a gallery’s More button to view more gallery 
options on the screen at a time.
Some buttons and boxes have arrows that, 
when tapped or clicked, also display a gallery; 
others always cause a gallery to be displayed 
when tapped or clicked. Most galleries support 
live preview, which is a feature that allows you 
to point to a gallery choice and see its effect 
in the document — without actually selecting 
the choice (Figure 15). Live preview works 
only if you are using a mouse; if you are using 
a touch screen, you will not be able to view live 
previews.

A ScreenTip is an on-screen note that provides the name of 
the command, available keyboard shortcut(s), a description of 
the command, and sometimes instructions for how to obtain

Mini Toolbar  The mini toolbar, 
which appears automatically based 
on tasks you perform, contains 
commands related to changing the 
appearance of text in a document 
(Figure 18). If you do not use the 
mini toolbar, it disappears from

Touch mode versus mouse mode. If 
you press and hold or right-click an 
item in the document window, Word 
displays both the mini toolbar and a

To Collapse and Expand the Ribbon  
and Use Full Screen Mode
To display more of a document or other item in the window of an Office app, some users prefer to collapse 
the ribbon, which hides the groups on the ribbon and displays only the main tabs, or to use Full Screen mode, 
which hides all the commands and just displays the document. Each time you run an Office app, the ribbon appears 
the same way it did the last time you used that Office app. The chapters in this book, however, begin with the 
ribbon appearing as it did at the initial installation of the software.
The following steps collapse, expand, and restore the ribbon in an Office app and then switch to Full 
Screen mode. Why? If you need more space on the screen to work with your document, you may consider collapsing the 
ribbon or switching to Full Screen mode to gain additional workspace.
1
•	Tap or click the ‘Collapse the Ribbon’ button on the ribbon (shown in Figure 20) to collapse the ribbon  
(Figure 21).
What happened to the groups on the ribbon?
When you collapse the ribbon, the groups disappear so that the ribbon does not take up as much space on the 
screen.
What happened to the ‘Collapse the Ribbon’ button? 
The ‘Pin the ribbon’ button replaces the ‘Collapse the Ribbon’ button when the ribbon is collapsed. You will see the 
‘Pin the ribbon’ button only when you expand a ribbon by tapping or clicking a tab.

To Enter Text in a Document
The first step in creating a document is to enter its text by typing on the keyboard. By default, Word 
positions text at the left margin as you type. The following steps type this first line of a flyer. Why? To begin 
creating a flyer, for example, you type the headline in the document window.
1
•	Type   SEE THE ELEPHANT 
HABITAT   as the text (Figure 30).
What is the blinking vertical bar 
to the right of the text?
The blinking bar is the insertion 
point, which indicates where text, 
graphics, and other items will be 
inserted in the document. As you 
type, the insertion point moves to 
the right, and when you reach the 
end of a line, it moves down to 
the beginning of the next line.
What if I make an error while 
typing?
You can press the backspace key 
until you have deleted the text 
in error and then retype the text 
correctly.
Why does a circle appear below the insertion point?
If you are using a touch screen, a selection handle (small circle) appears below the text 
so that you can format the text easily.

•	Press the enter key to move the 
insertion point to the beginning 
of the next line (Figure 31).
Why did blank space appear 
between the entered text and the 
insertion point?

Word creates a new paragraph 
and inserts blank space between 
the two paragraphs. Depending 
on your settings, Office may or 
may not insert a blank space 
between the two paragraphs.

Saving and Organizing Files
While you are creating a document, the computer stores it in memory. When you save 
a document, the computer places it on a storage medium such as a hard disk, solid state 
drive (SSD), USB flash drive, or optical disc. The storage medium can be permanent in 
your computer, may be portable where you remove it from your computer, or may be 
on a web server you access through a network or the Internet.

How often should you save a document?
It is important to save a document frequently for the following reasons:
•	The document in memory might be lost if the computer is turned off or you lose electrical power while an app is running.
•	If you run out of time before completing a project, you may finish it at a future time without starting over. 
CONSIDER THIS
Organizing Files and Folders
A file contains data. This data can range from a research paper to an accounting 
spreadsheet to an electronic math quiz. You should organize and store files in folders to 
avoid misplacing a file and to help you find a file quickly.
If you are taking an introductory computer class (CIS 101, for example), you may  
want to design a series of folders for the different subjects covered in the class. To accomplish 
this, you can arrange the folders in a hierarchy for the class, as shown in Figure 32.
The hierarchy contains three levels. The first level contains the storage medium, 
such as a hard disk. The second level contains the class folder (CIS 101, in this case), 
and the third level contains seven folders, one each for a different Office app that will be 
covered in the class (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Outlook, Publisher, and OneNote).
When the hierarchy in Figure 32 is created, the storage medium is said to contain 
the CIS 101 folder, and the CIS 101 folder is said to contain the separate Office folders 
(i.e., Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.). In addition, this hierarchy easily can be expanded 
to include folders from other classes taken during additional semesters.
The vertical and horizontal lines in Figure 32 form a pathway that allows you to 
navigate to a drive or folder on a computer or network. A path consists of a drive letter 
(preceded by a drive name when necessary) and colon, to identify the storage device, 
and one or more folder names. A hard disk typically has a drive letter of C. Each drive 
or folder in the hierarchy has a corresponding path. 
By default, Windows saves documents in the Documents library, music in the 
Music library, photos in the Pictures library, and videos in the Videos library. A library 
helps you manage multiple folders stored in various locations on a computer and 
devices. It does not store the folder contents; rather, it keeps track of their locations so 
that you can access the folders and their contents quickly. For example, you can save 
pictures from a digital camera in any folder on any storage location on a computer. 
Normally, this would make organizing the different folders difficult. If you add 
A saved document is referred to as a file. A file name is the name assigned to a 
file when it is saved. When saving files, you should organize them so that you easily can 
find them later. Windows provides tools to help you organize files.

the folders to a library, however, you can access all the pictures from one location 
regardless of where they are stored. 
The following pages illustrate the steps to organize the folders for this class and 
save a file in one of those folders:
1.	 Create the folder identifying your class.
2.	 Create the Word folder in the folder identifying your class.
3.	 Create the remaining folders in the folder identifying your class (one each for 
PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Outlook, Publisher, and OneNote).
4.	 Save a file in the Word folder.
5.	 Verify the location of the saved file.
To Create a Folder
When you create a folder, such as the CIS 101 folder shown in Figure 32, you must name the folder. 
A folder name should describe the folder and its contents. A folder name can contain spaces and any uppercase 
or lowercase characters, except a backslash (⁜\), slash (⁜/⁜), colon (:), asterisk (*), question mark (?), quotation 
marks (“), less than symbol (<), greater than symbol (>), or vertical bar (|). Folder names cannot be CON, AUX, 
COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, PRN, or NUL. The same rules for naming folders also 
apply to naming files.
The following steps create a class folder (CIS 101, in this case) in the Documents library. Why? When 
storing files, you should organize the files so that it will be easier to find them later. If you are using Windows 7, skip 
these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

The Documents window (shown in Figure 36) is called a folder window. Recall that a 
folder is a specific named location on a storage medium that contains related files. Most users 
rely on folder windows for finding, viewing, and managing information on their computers. 
Folder windows have common design elements, including the following (shown in Figure 36).
•	The address bar provides quick navigation options. The arrows on the address bar 
allow you to visit different locations on the computer. 
•	The buttons to the left of the address bar allow you to navigate the contents of the 
navigation pane and view recent pages. 
•	The Previous Locations arrow displays the locations you have visited. 
•	The Refresh button on the right side of the address bar refreshes the contents of 
the folder list. 
•	The search box contains the dimmed words, Search Documents. You can type a 
term in the search box for a list of files, folders, shortcuts, and elements containing 
that term within the location you are searching. A shortcut is an icon on the desktop 
that provides a user with immediate access to an app or file.
•	The ribbon contains five tabs used to accomplish various tasks on the computer 
related to organizing and managing the contents of the open window. This ribbon 
works similarly to the ribbon in the Office apps.
•	The navigation pane on the left contains the Favorites area, Libraries area, 
Homegroup area, Computer area, and Network area. 
•	The Favorites area shows your favorite locations. By default, this list contains only 
links to your Desktop, Downloads, and Recent places. 
•	The Libraries area shows folders included in a library.
To Create a Folder Using Windows 7
If you are using Windows 7, perform these steps to create a folder instead of 
the previous steps that use Windows 8.
1.	 Click the Windows Explorer button on the taskbar to run Windows Explorer.
2.	 Click the Documents library in the navigation pane to display the contents 
of the Documents library in the file list.
3.	 Click the New folder button on the toolbar to display a new folder icon 
with the name, New folder, selected in a text box.
4.	 Type   CIS 101   (or your class code) in the text box to name the folder.
5.	 Press the enter key to create the folder.

To Create a Folder within a Folder
With the class folder created, you can create folders that will store the files you create using each Office 
app. The following steps create a Word folder in the CIS 101 folder (or the folder identifying your class). Why? 
To be able to organize your files, you should create a folder structure. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and 
instead perform the steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

To Expand a Folder, Scroll through  
Folder Contents, and Collapse a Folder
Folder windows display the hierarchy of items and the contents of drives and folders in the file list. 
You might want to expand a library or folder in the navigation pane to view its contents, slide or scroll through 
its contents, and collapse it when you are finished viewing its contents. Why? When a folder is expanded, you can see 
all the folders it contains. By contrast, a collapsed folder hides the folders it contains. The following steps expand, slide or 
scroll through, and then collapse the folder identifying your class (CIS 101, in this case).

To Save a File in a Folder
With the folders for storing your files created, you can save the Word document. Why? Without saving a 
file, you may lose all the work you have done and will be unable to reuse or share it with others later. The following steps 
save a file in the Word folder contained in your class folder (CIS 101, in this case) using the file name, Elephant 
Habitat.

•	Tap or click the Save button 
(shown in Figure 44) on the 
Quick Access Toolbar, which 
depending on settings, will 
display either the Save As gallery 
in the Backstage view (Figure 45) 
or the Save As dialog box  
(Figure 46 on the next page).
What is the Backstage view? 
The Backstage view contains a 
set of commands that enable 
you to manage documents and 
data about the documents.
What if the Save As gallery is 
not displayed in the Backstage 
view?
Tap or click the Save As tab to

Why does a file name already 
appear in the File name box?
Word automatically suggests 
a file name the first time you 
save a document. The file name 
normally consists of the first few 
words contained in the document. 
Because the suggested file name 
is selected, you do not need to 
delete it; as soon as you begin 
typing, the new file name replaces 
the selected text.

Navigating in Dialog Boxes
Navigating is the process of finding a location on a storage device. While saving 
the Elephant Habitat file, for example, Steps 4a and 4b on the previous page navigated 
to the Word folder located in the CIS 101 folder in the My Documents folder in the 
Documents library. When performing certain functions in Windows apps, such as 
saving a file, opening a file, or inserting a picture in an existing document, you most 
likely will have to navigate to the location where you want to save the file or to the 
folder containing the file you want to open or insert. Most dialog boxes in Windows 
apps requiring navigation follow a similar procedure; that is, the way you navigate to 
a folder in one dialog box, such as the Save As dialog box, is similar to how you might 
navigate in another dialog box, such as the Open dialog box. If you chose to navigate to 
a specific location in a dialog box, you would follow the instructions in Steps 4a and 4b.

To Minimize and Restore a Window
Before continuing, you can verify that the Word file was saved properly. To do this, you will minimize the 
Word window and then open the CIS 101 window so that you can verify the file is stored in the CIS 101 folder 
on the hard disk. A minimized window is an open window that is hidden from view but can be displayed quickly 
by clicking the window’s app button on the taskbar. 
In the following example, Word is used to illustrate minimizing and restoring windows; however, you 
would follow the same steps regardless of the Office app you are using. Why? Before closing an app, you should 
make sure your file saved correctly so that you can find it later.
The following steps minimize the Word window, verify that the file is saved, and then restore the 
minimized window. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow box 
that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

To Save a File on SkyDrive
One of the features of Office is the capability to save files on SkyDrive so that you can use the files on multiple 
computers without having to use external storage devices such as a USB flash drive. Storing files on SkyDrive also 
enables you to share files more efficiently with others, such as when using Office Web Apps and Office 365. 
In the following example, Word is used to save a file to SkyDrive. Why? Storing files on SkyDrive provides 
more portability options than are available from storing files in the Documents library.
You can save files directly to SkyDrive from within Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. The following steps save the 
current Word file to the SkyDrive. These steps require you have a Microsoft account and an Internet connection.

To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are using a public computer or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft 
account, you should sign out of the account from the Accounts gallery in the Backstage 
view. Signing out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can 
access online files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. Why? For security reasons, 
you should sign out of your Microsoft account when you are finished using a public or shared 
computer. Staying signed in to your Microsoft account might enable others to access your files.

Screen Resolution
Screen resolution indicates the number of pixels (dots) that the computer uses to 
display the letters, numbers, graphics, and background you see on the screen. When you 
increase the screen resolution, Windows displays more information on the screen, but the 
information decreases in size. The reverse also is true: as you decrease the screen resolution, 
Windows displays less information on the screen, but the information increases in size. 
Screen resolution usually is stated as the product of two numbers, such as  
1366 3 768 (pronounced “thirteen sixty-six by seven sixty-eight”). A 1366 3 768 
screen resolution results in a display of 1366 distinct pixels on each of 768 lines, or

about 1,050,624 pixels. Changing the screen resolution affects how the ribbon appears 
in Office apps and some Windows dialog boxes. Figure 59 shows the Word ribbon 
at screen resolutions of 1366 3 768 and 1024 3 768. All of the same commands are 
available regardless of screen resolution. The app (Word, in this case), however, makes 
changes to the groups and the buttons within the groups to accommodate the various 
screen resolutions. The result is that certain commands may need to be accessed 
differently depending on the resolution chosen. A command that is visible on the ribbon 
and available by tapping or clicking a button at one resolution may not be visible and 
may need to be accessed using its Dialog Box Launcher at a different resolution.
Comparing the two ribbons in Figure 59, notice the changes in content and layout 
of the groups and galleries. In some cases, the content of a group is the same in each 
resolution, but the layout of the group differs. For example, the same gallery and buttons 
appear in the Styles groups in the two resolutions, but the layouts differ. In other cases, 
the content and layout are the same across the resolution, but the level of detail differs 
with the resolution.

To Change the Screen Resolution
If you are using a computer to step through the chapters in this book and you want your screen to match 
the figures, you may need to change your screen’s resolution. Why? The figures in this book use a screen resolution 
of 1366 3 768. The following steps change the screen resolution to 1366 3 768. Your computer already may be 
set to 1366 3 768. Keep in mind that many computer labs prevent users from changing the screen resolution; in 
that case, read the following steps for illustration purposes.

To Exit an Office App  
with One Document Open
When you exit an Office app, such as Word, if you have made changes to a file since the last time the file 
was saved, the Office app displays a dialog box asking if you want to save the changes you made to the file before 
it closes the app window. Why? The dialog box contains three buttons with these resulting actions: the Save button saves 
the changes and then exits the Office app, the Don’t Save button exits the Office app without saving changes, and the Cancel 
button closes the dialog box and redisplays the file without saving the changes. 
If no changes have been made to an open document since the last time the file was saved, the Office app 
will close the window without displaying a dialog box.
The following steps exit an Office app. In the following example, Word is used to illustrate exiting an 
Office app; however, you would follow the same steps regardless of the Office app you were using.

•	If necessary, drag the resolution

What if my computer does

resolution?
Some computers do not support 
the 1366 3768 resolution. 
In this case, select a resolution 
that is close to the 1366 3 768 
resolution.
What is a slider?
A slider is an object that allows 
users to choose from multiple 
predetermined options. In most cases, 
these options represent some type of 
numeric value. In most cases, one end of the slider (usually the left or bottom) represents 
the lowest of available values, and the opposite end (usually the right or top) represents 
the highest available value.

To Copy a Folder to a USB Flash Drive
To store files and folders on a USB flash drive, you must connect the USB flash drive to an available USB 
port on a computer. The following steps copy your CIS 101 folder to a USB flash drive. Why? It often is good practice 
to have a backup of your files. Besides SkyDrive, you can save files to a portable storage device, such as a USB flash drive. If you 
are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these 
Windows 8 steps.

•	Insert a USB flash drive in an 
available USB port on the computer 
to connect the USB flash drive.
How can I ensure the USB flash 
drive is connected?
In File Explorer, you can use the 
navigation bar to find the USB 
flash drive. If it is not showing, 
then it is not connected properly.

PowerPoint 
PowerPoint is a full-featured presentation app that allows you to produce 
compelling presentations to deliver and share with an audience (Figure 68). A PowerPoint 
presentation also is called a slide show. PowerPoint contains many features to design, 
develop, and organize slides, including formatting text, adding and editing video and audio 
clips, creating tables and charts, applying artistic effects to pictures, animating graphics, 
and collaborating with friends and colleagues. You then can turn your presentation into a 
video, broadcast your slide show on the web, or create a photo album.

To Run an App Using the Search Box
The following steps, which assume Windows is running, use the search box to run the PowerPoint app 
based on a typical installation; however, you would follow similar steps to run any Office app. Why? Sometimes an 
app does not appear on the Start screen, so you can find it quickly by searching. You may need to ask your instructor how 
to run apps for your computer. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the 
yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

Ribbon  The ribbon in PowerPoint is similar to the one in Word and the 
other Microsoft Office apps. When you run PowerPoint, the ribbon displays nine main 
tabs: FILE, HOME, INSERT, DESIGN, TRANSITIONS, ANIMATIONS, SLIDE 
SHOW, REVIEW, and VIEW. 
To Enter Content in a Title Slide
With the exception of a blank slide, PowerPoint assumes every new slide has a title. Many of PowerPoint’s 
layouts have both a title text placeholder and at least one content placeholder. To make creating a presentation easier, 
any text you type after a new slide appears becomes title text in the title text placeholder. As you begin typing text in 
the title text placeholder, the title text also is displayed in the Slide 1 thumbnail in the Thumbnail pane. The title for 
this presentation is Kelitestone Crafts. The steps on the next page enter a presentation title on the title slide. Why? In 
general, every presentation should have a title to describe what the presentation will be covering.

The basic unit of a PowerPoint presentation is a slide. A slide may contain text and 
objects, such as graphics, tables, charts, and drawings. Layouts are used to position this 
content on the slide. When you create a new presentation, the default Title Slide layout 
appears (shown in Figure 72). The purpose of this layout is to introduce the presentation 
to the audience. PowerPoint includes several other built-in standard layouts.
The default slide layouts are set up in landscape orientation, where the slide 
width is greater than its height. In landscape orientation, the slide size is preset 
to 10 inches wide and 7.5 inches high when printed on a standard sheet of paper 
measuring 11 inches wide and 8.5 inches high.
Placeholders  Placeholders are boxes with dashed or solid borders that are 
displayed when you create a new slide. All layouts except the Blank slide layout contain 
placeholders. Depending on the particular slide layout selected, title and subtitle 
placeholders are displayed for the slide title and subtitle; a content placeholder is 
displayed for text or a table, chart, picture, graphic, or movie. The title slide in Figure 
73 has two text placeholders for the main heading, or title, and the subtitle.

To Create a New Office Document  
from the Backstage View
As discussed earlier, the Backstage view contains a set of commands that enable you to manage documents 
and data about the documents. Why? From the Backstage view in PowerPoint, for example, you can create, open, print, 
and save presentations. You also can share documents, manage versions, set permissions, and modify document properties. In 
other Office 2013 apps, the Backstage view may contain features specific to those apps. The following steps create a file, 
a blank presentation in this case, from the Backstage view.

Excel
Excel is a powerful spreadsheet app that allows users to organize data, complete 
calculations, make decisions, graph data, develop professional-looking reports 
(Figure 82), publish organized data to the web, and access real-time data from websites. 
The four major parts of Excel are:
•	Workbooks and Worksheets: A workbook is like a notebook. Inside the workbook 
are sheets, each of which is called a worksheet. Thus, a workbook is a collection of 
worksheets. Worksheets allow users to enter, calculate, manipulate, and analyze data 
such as numbers and text. The terms worksheet and spreadsheet are interchangeable.
•	Charts: Excel can draw a variety of charts such as column charts and pie charts.
•	Tables: Tables organize and store data within worksheets. For example, once 
a user enters data into a worksheet, an Excel table can sort the data, search for 
specific data, and select data that satisfies defined criteria.
To Exit an Office App
You are finished using PowerPoint. Thus, you should exit this Office app. 
The following steps exit PowerPoint.
	1	
If you have one Office document open, tap or click the Close button on the right side 
of the title bar to close the document and exit the Office app; or if you have multiple 
Office documents open, press and hold or right-click the app button on the taskbar 
and then tap or click ‘Close all windows’ on the shortcut menu, or press alt+f4 to close 
all open documents and exit the Office app.
If I am using a touch screen, could I press and hold the Close button until all windows 
close and the app exits?
Yes.

To Run an App from File Explorer  
and Open a File
Previously, you learned how to run an Office app using the Start screen and the Search charm. The steps on the 
next page, which assume Windows is running, use File Explorer to run the Excel app based on a typical installation. 
Why? Another way to run an Office app is to open an existing file from File Explorer, which causes the app in which the file was 
created to run and then open the selected file. You may need to ask your instructor how to run Office apps for your computer. 
If you are using Windows 7, follow the steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

Unique Features of Excel
The Excel window consists of a variety of components to make your work more 
efficient and worksheets more professional. These include the document window, 
ribbon, mini toolbar and shortcut menus, Quick Access Toolbar, and Microsoft 
Account area. Some of these components are common to other Office apps; others are 
unique to Excel.
Excel opens a new workbook with one worksheet. If necessary, you can add 
additional worksheets as long as your computer has enough memory to accommodate 
them. 
Each worksheet has a sheet name that appears on a sheet tab at the bottom of 
the workbook. For example, Sheet1 is the name of the active worksheet displayed in 
the Iverstonit Electronics workbook. You can add more sheets to the workbook by 
clicking the New sheet button. 
The Worksheet  The worksheet is organized into a rectangular grid containing 
vertical columns and horizontal rows. A column letter above the grid, also called the 
column heading, identifies each column. A row number on the left side of the grid, 
also called the row heading, identifies each row. With the screen resolution set to 
1366 3 768 and the Excel window maximized, Excel displays 20 columns (A through T) 
and 23 rows (1 through 23) of the worksheet on the screen, as shown in Figure 87.
The intersection of each column and row is a cell. A cell is the basic unit of 
a worksheet into which you enter data. Each worksheet in a workbook has 16,384 
columns and 1,048,576 rows for a total of 17,179,869,180 cells. Only a small fraction 
of the active worksheet appears on the screen at one time.
A cell is referred to by its unique address, or cell reference, which is the 
coordinates of the intersection of a column and a row. To identify a cell, specify the 
column letter first, followed by the row number. For example, cell reference E2 refers 
to the cell located at the intersection of column E and row 2 (Figure 87).
One cell on the worksheet, designated the active cell, is the one into which you 
can enter data. The active cell in Figure 87 is A1. The active cell is identified in three 
ways. First, a heavy border surrounds the cell; second, the active cell reference shows 
immediately above column A in the Name box; and third, the column heading A and 
row heading 1 are highlighted so that it is easy to see which cell is active (Figure 87).
The horizontal and vertical lines on the worksheet itself are called gridlines. 
Gridlines make it easier to see and identify each cell in the worksheet. If desired, you 
can turn the gridlines off so that they do not show on the worksheet. While learning 
Excel, gridlines help you to understand the structure of the worksheet.
To Run an App from Windows Explorer and Open a File Using Windows 7
If you are using Windows 7, perform these steps to run an app from Windows 
Explorer and open a file instead of the previous steps that use Windows 8.
1.	 Display the file to open in the folder window in Windows Explorer.
2.	 Right-click the file icon or file name (Iverstonit Electronics, in this case) to 
display a shortcut menu.
3.	 Click Open on the shortcut menu to open the selected file in the app used 
to create the file, Excel in this case.
4.	 If the app window is not maximized, click the Maximize button on the title 
bar to maximize the window.
BTW
The Worksheet Size 
and Window
The 16,384 columns and 
1,048,576 rows in Excel  
make for a huge worksheet 
that — if you could imagine — 
takes up the entire side of 
a building to display in its 
entirety. Your computer screen, 
by comparison, is a small 
window that allows you to 
view only a minute area of the 
worksheet at one time. While 
you cannot see the entire 
worksheet, you can move the 
window over the worksheet 
to view any part of it.
BTW
Customizing the 
Ribbon
In addition to customizing 
the Quick Access Toolbar, you 
can add items to and remove 
items from the ribbon. To 
customize the ribbon, click 
FILE on the ribbon to open 
the Backstage view, click 
Options in the Backstage 
view, and then click 
Customize Ribbon in the left 
pane of the Options dialog 
box. More information about 
customizing the ribbon is

OFF 60   Office 2013 and Windows 8 Chapter   Essential Concepts and Skills
The pointer in Figure 87 on page OFF 58 has the shape of a block plus sign. 
The pointer appears as a block plus sign whenever it is located in a cell on the 
worksheet. Another common shape of the pointer is the block arrow. The pointer turns 
into the block arrow when you move it outside the worksheet or when you drag cell 
contents between rows or columns. The other pointer shapes are described when they 
appear on the screen.
Ribbon  When you run Excel, the ribbon displays eight main tabs: FILE, HOME, 
INSERT, PAGE LAYOUT, FORMULAS, DATA, REVIEW, and VIEW. The 
FORMULAS and DATA tabs are specific to Excel. The FORMULAS tab allows 
you to work with Excel formulas, and the DATA tab allows you to work with data 
processing features such as importing and sorting data.
Formula Bar   As you type, Excel displays the entry in the formula bar, which 
appears below the ribbon (Figure 88). You can make the formula bar larger by dragging 
the sizing handle at the bottom of the formula bar or tapping or clicking the expand 
button to the right of the formula bar. Excel also displays the active cell reference in 
the Name box on the left side of the formula bar.

To Enter a Worksheet Title
To enter data into a cell, you first must select it. The easiest way to select a cell (make it active) is to tap the 
cell or use the mouse to move the block plus sign pointer to the cell and then click. An alternative method is to 
use the arrow keys that are located just to the right of the typewriter keys on the keyboard. An arrow key selects 
the cell adjacent to the active cell in the direction of the arrow on the key. 
In Excel, any set of characters containing a letter, hyphen (as in a telephone number), or space is 
considered text. Text is used to place titles, such as worksheet titles, column titles, and row titles, on the 
worksheet. The following steps enter the worksheet title in cell A1. Why? A title informs others as to the contents 
of the worksheet, such as information regarding a company.

To Save an Existing Office File  
with the Same File Name
Saving frequently cannot be overemphasized. Why? You have made modifications to the file (spreadsheet) since 
you created it. Thus, you should save again. Similarly, you should continue saving files frequently so that you do not lose 
the changes you have made since the time you last saved the file. You can use the same file name, such as Iverstonit 
Electronics, to save the changes made to the document. The step on the next page saves a file again with the 
same file name.

Access
The term database describes a collection of data organized in a manner that 
allows access, retrieval, and use of that data. Access is a database management system. 
A database management system is software that allows you to use a computer to 
create a database; add, change, and delete data in the database; create queries that allow 
you to ask questions concerning the data in the database; and create forms and reports 
using the data in the database.
To Run an App
The following steps, which assume Windows is running, run the Access app 
based on a typical installation. You may need to ask your instructor how to run apps for 
your computer. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the 
steps in the yellow box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

Unique Elements in Access
You work on objects such as tables, forms, and reports in the Access work area. 
Figure 94 shows a work area with multiple objects open. Object tabs for the open 
objects appear at the top of the work area. You select an open object by tapping or 
clicking its tab. In the figure, the Asset List table is the selected object. To the left of 
the work area is the Navigation Pane, which contains a list of all the objects in the 
database. You use this pane to open an object. You also can customize the way objects 
are displayed in the Navigation Pane.
Because the Navigation Pane can take up space in the window, you may not have as 
much open space for working as you would with Word or Excel. You can use the ‘Shutter 
Bar Open/Close Button’ to minimize the Navigation Pane when you are not using it, 
which allows more space to work with tables, forms, reports, and other database elements.
Ribbon  When you run Access, the ribbon displays five main tabs: FILE, HOME, 
CREATE, EXTERNAL DATA, and DATABASE TOOLS. Access has unique 
groupings such as Sort & Filter and Records that are designed specifically for working 
with databases. Many of the formatting options are reserved for the tool tabs that 
appear when you are working with forms and reports.

To Create an Access Database
Unlike the other Office apps, Access saves a database when you first create it. When working in Access, 
you will add data to an Access database. As you add data to a database, Access automatically saves your changes 
rather than waiting until you manually save the database or exit Access. Recall that in Word and Excel, you 
entered the data first and then saved it.
Because Access automatically saves the database as you add and change data, you do not always have to 
click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar. Instead, the Save button in Access is used for saving the 
objects (including tables, queries, forms, reports, and other database objects) a database contains. You can use 
either the ‘Blank desktop database’ option or a template to create a new database. If you already know the

organization of your database, you would use the ‘Blank desktop database’ option. If not, you can use a template. 
Templates can guide you by suggesting some commonly used database organizations.
The following steps use the ‘Blank desktop database’ option to create a database named Rimitoein 
Construction in the Access folder in the class folder (CIS 101, in this case) in the Documents library. Why? You 
have decided to use Microsoft Access to maintain large amounts of data.
1
•	Tap or click the ‘Blank desktop 
database’ thumbnail (shown in 
Figure 93 on page OFF 63) to 
select the database type.
•	Type   Rimitoein 
Construction   in the File 
Name box to enter the new file 
name. Do not press the enter key 
after typing the file name because 
you do not want to create the 
database at this time (Figure 95).
3
•	Tap or click the OK button 
(File New Database dialog box) 
to select the Access folder as the 
location for the database and 
close the dialog box (Figure 97).
2
•	Tap or click the ‘Browse for a 
location to put your database’ 
button to display the File New 
Database dialog box.
•	Navigate to the location for the 
database, that is, the Documents 
library, the My Documents folder, 
then to the folder identifying 
your class (CIS 101, in this 
case), and then to the Access 
folder (Figure 96). For specific 
instructions, perform the tasks 
in Steps 5a through 5e on page 
OFF 51, replacing the PowerPoint 
folder with the Access folder.
Why does the ‘Save as type’ box 
say Microsoft Access 2007-2013 
Databases?
Microsoft Access database formats 
change with some new versions of 
Microsoft Access. The most recent format is the Microsoft Access 2007-2013 Databases 
format, which was released with Access 2007 and Access 2013.

Outlook
Outlook is a powerful communications and scheduling app that helps you 
communicate with others, keep track of contacts, and organize your calendar. Apps 
such as Outlook provide a way for individuals and workgroups to organize, find, view, 
and share information easily. Outlook allows you to send and receive email messages and  
provides a means to organize contacts. Users can track email messages, meetings, and 
notes related to a particular contact. Outlook’s Calendar, People, Tasks, and Notes 
components aid in this organization. Contact information readily is available from 
the Outlook Calendar, Mail, People, and Task components by accessing the Search 
Contacts feature. 
Email is the transmission of messages and files over a computer network. 
Email has become an important means of exchanging information and files between 
business associates, classmates and instructors, friends, and family. Businesses find 
that using email to send documents electronically saves both time and money. Parents 
with students away at college or relatives who live across the country find that 
communicating by email is an inexpensive and easy way to stay in touch with their 
family members. Exchanging email messages is a widely used service of the Internet.
The Outlook Window  Figure 100 shows an Outlook window, which is divided into 
three panes: the Folder pane, the Inbox message pane to the left of center, and the 
Reading Pane to the right of center.
When an email message is open in Outlook, it is displayed in a Message window

Publisher
Publisher is a powerful desktop publishing (DTP) app that assists you 
in designing and producing professional-quality documents that combine text, 
graphics, illustrations, and photos. DTP software provides additional tools beyond 
those typically found in word processing apps, including design templates, graphic 
manipulation tools, color schemes or libraries, advanced layout and printing tools, and 
web components. For large jobs, businesses use DTP software to design publications 
that are camera ready, which means the files are suitable for outside commercial 
printing. In addition, DTP software can be used to create webpages and interactive 
web forms.
Publisher is used by people who regularly produce high-quality color 
publications, such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, logos, signs, catalogs, cards, and 
business forms. Saving publications as webpages or complete websites is a powerful 
component of Publisher. All publications can be saved in a format that easily is viewed 
and manipulated using a browser.
Publisher has many features designed to simplify production and make 
publications visually appealing. Using Publisher, you easily can change the shape, 
size, and color of text and graphics. You can include many kinds of graphical objects, 
including mastheads, borders, tables, images, pictures, charts, and web objects in 
publications, as well as integrate spreadsheets and databases.
The Publisher Window   Publisher initially displays a list of publication types. 
Publication types are typical publications used by desktop publishers. The more 
popular types are displayed in the center of the window. 
Once you select a publication type, a dialog box is displayed to allow you to 
create the publication (Figure 102 on the next page). Some templates are installed with 
Publisher, and others are available online. In Figure 102, the Brochure publication 
dialog box is displayed.

OneNote
OneNote is a note taking app that assists you in entering, saving, organizing, 
searching, and using notes. It enables you to create pages, which are organized in 
sections, just as in a physical notebook. In OneNote, you can type notes anywhere on 
a page and then easily move the notes around on the page. You can create lists and 
outlines, use handwriting to enter notes, and create drawings. If you use a tablet to add 
handwritten notes to a document, OneNote can convert the handwriting to text. It also 
can perform searches on the handwritten entries. Pictures and data from other apps 
easily are incorporated in your notes.
In addition to typing and handwriting, you can take audio notes. For example, 
you could record conversations during a meeting or lecture. As you record, you can take 
additional notes. When you play back the audio notes, you can synchronize the additional 
notes you took; that is, OneNote will show you during playback the exact points at which 
you added the notes. A variety of note flags, which are symbols that call your attention to 
notes on a page, enable you to flag notes as being important. You then can use the Note 
Flags summary to view the flagged notes, which can be sorted in a variety of ways.
OneNote includes tools to assist you with organizing a notebook and navigating 
its contents. It also includes a search feature, making it easy to find the specific notes 
in which you are interested. For short notes that you always want to have available 
readily, you can use Side Notes, which are used much like the sticky notes that you 
might use in a physical notebook.
OneNote Window  All activity in OneNote takes place in the notebook (Figure 104). 
Like a physical notebook, the OneNote notebook consists of notes that are placed 
on pages. The pages are grouped into sections, which can be further grouped into 
folders. (No folders are shown in the notebook in the figure.) You can use the Search 
box to search for specific text in your notes.
You can add pages to the notebook using the Add Page button in the Page Tabs 
pane. If Page Tabs are displayed, you can switch to a page by tapping or clicking its tab.

Renaming, Moving, and Deleting Files
Earlier in this chapter, you learned how to organize files in folders, which is part of 
a process known as file management. The following sections cover additional file 
management topics including renaming, moving, and deleting files. 
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. To resume at a later time, continue to follow the steps 
from this location forward.
To Rename a File
In some circumstances, you may want to change the name of, or rename, a file or a folder. Why? You may 
want to distinguish a file in one folder or drive from a copy of a similar file, or you may decide to rename a file to better 
identify its contents. The Word folder shown in Figure 67 on page OFF 44 contains the Word document, Elephant 
Habitat. The following steps change the name of the Elephant Habitat file in the Word folder to Elephant 
Habitat Flyer. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow box that 
immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.
1
•	If necessary, tap or click the 
File Explorer app button on 
the taskbar to make the folder 
window the active window.
•	Navigate to the location of the 
file to be renamed (in this case, 
the Word folder in the CIS 101 
[or your class folder] folder in 
the My Documents folder in the 
Documents library) to display the 
file(s) it contains in the file list. 
•	Press and hold or right-click the 
Elephant Habitat icon or file 
name in the file list to select the 
Elephant Habitat file and display 
a shortcut menu that presents a 
list of commands related to files 
(Figure 105).
1 sign in | 2 use windows | 3 use apps | 4 file management | 5 switch apps | 6 save files
7 change screen resolution | 8 exit apps | 9 use additional apps | 10 use help

•	Tap or click Rename on the 
shortcut menu to place the 
current file name in a text box. 
•	Type   Elephant Habitat 
Flyer   in the text box and then 
press the enter key (Figure 106).
Are any risks involved in renaming 
files that are located on a hard disk?
If you inadvertently rename a 
file that is associated with certain 
apps, the apps may not be able to find the file and, therefore,  
may not run properly. Always use caution when renaming files.
Can I rename a file when it is open?
No, a file must be closed to change the file name.

make the folder window the active window.
2.	 Navigate to the location of the file to be renamed (in this case, the Word

the Elephant Habitat file and display a shortcut menu that presents a list 
of commands related to files.
4.	 Click Rename on the shortcut menu to place the current file name in a 
text box.
5.	 Type   Elephant Habitat Flyer   in the text box and then press the 
enter key.
To Move a File
Why? At some time, you may want to move a file from one folder, called the source folder, to another, called the 
destination folder. When you move a file, it no longer appears in the original folder. If the destination and the 
source folders are on the same media, you can move a file by dragging it. If the folders are on different media, 
then you will need to press and hold and then drag, or right-drag the file, and then click Move here on the 
shortcut menu. The following step moves the Iverstonit Electronics Rental Summary file from the Excel folder 
to the OneNote folder. If you are using Windows 7, skip these steps and instead perform the steps in the yellow 
box that immediately follows these Windows 8 steps.

To Delete a File
A final task you may want to perform is to delete a file. Exercise extreme caution when deleting a file 
or files. When you delete a file from a hard disk, the deleted file is stored in the Recycle Bin where you can 
recover it until you empty the Recycle Bin. If you delete a file from removable media, such as a USB flash 
drive, the file is deleted permanently. The next steps delete the Elephant Habitat Opening file from the 
PowerPoint folder. Why? When a file no longer is needed, you can delete it to conserve space in your storage location.

Microsoft Office and Windows Help
At any time while you are using one of the Office apps, you can use Office Help to 
display information about all topics associated with the app. To illustrate the use of Office 
Help, this section uses Word. Help in other Office apps operates in a similar fashion. 
In Office, Help is presented in a window that has browser-style navigation 
buttons. Each Office app has its own Help home page, which is the starting Help page 
that is displayed in the Help window. If your computer is connected to the Internet, 
the contents of the Help page reflect both the local help files installed on the computer 
and material from Microsoft’s website. 
To Delete a File Using Windows 7
If you are using Windows 7, perform these steps to delete a file instead of the 
previous steps that use Windows 8.
1.	 In Windows Explorer, navigate to the location of the file to be deleted 
(in this case, the PowerPoint folder in the CIS 101 folder [or your class 
folder] in the Documents library).
2.	 Right-click the Elephant Habitat Opening icon or file name in the right 
pane to select the file and display a shortcut menu.
3.	 Click Delete on the shortcut menu to delete the file.
4.	 If a dialog box appears, click the Yes button to delete the file.

Moving and Resizing Windows
At times, it is useful, or even necessary, to have more than one window open and 
visible on the screen at the same time. You can resize and move these open windows 
so that you can view different areas of and elements in the window. In the case of the 
Help window, for example, it could be covering document text in the Word window 
that you need to see.
1
•	Run an Office app, 
in this case Word. 
•	Tap or click the 
Office app’s Help 
button near the 
upper-right corner 
of the app window 
(the ‘Microsoft Word 
Help’ button, in this 
case) to open the 
app’s Help window 
(Figure 109).

To Move a Window by Dragging
You can move any open window that is not maximized to another location on the desktop by dragging the title 
bar of the window. Why? You might want to have a better view of what is behind the window or just want to move the window 
so that you can see it better. The following step drags the Word Help window to the upper-left corner of the desktop.

•	Drag the window title 
bar (the Word Help 
window title bar, in this case) so 
that the window moves to the 
upper-left corner of the desktop,

To Resize a Window by Dragging
A method used to change the size of the window is to drag the window borders. The following step 
changes the size of the Word Help window by dragging its borders. Why? Sometimes, information is not visible 
completely in a window, and you want to increase the size of the window.

•	If you are using a mouse, point 
to the lower-right corner of the 
window (the Word Help window, 
in this case) until the pointer 
changes to a two-headed arrow.
•	Drag the bottom border 
downward to display more of the 
active window (Figure 111).
Can I drag other borders on the 
window to enlarge or shrink the 
window?
Yes, you can drag the left, right, 
and top borders and any window 
corner to resize a window.
Will Windows remember the new 
size of the window after I close it?
Yes. When you reopen the 
window, Windows will display it 
at the same size it was when you 
closed it.

Using Office Help
Once an Office app’s Help window is open, several methods exist for navigating 
Help. You can search for help by using any of the three following methods from the 
Help window: 
1.	 Enter search text in the ‘Search online help’ text box.
2.	 Click the links in the Help window.
3.	 Use the Table of Contents.
1 sign in | 2 use windows | 3 use apps | 4 file management | 5 switch apps | 6 save files
7 change screen resolution | 8 exit apps | 9 use additional apps | 10 use help
To Obtain Help Using the  
‘Search online help’ Text Box
Assume for the following example that you want to know more about fonts. The following steps use the 
‘Search online help’ text box to obtain useful information about fonts by entering the word, fonts, as search text. 
Why? You may not know the exact help topic you are looking to find, so using keywords can help narrow your search.
1
•	Type   fonts   in the ‘Search 
online help’ text box 
at the top of the Word 
Help window to enter 
the search text. 
•	Tap or click the ‘Search online 
help’ button to display the search 
results (Figure 112). 
Why do my search results differ?
If you do not have an Internet 
connection, your results will 
reflect only the content of the 
Help files on your computer. 
When searching for help online, 
results also can change as material 
is added, deleted, and updated on 
the online Help webpages maintained by Microsoft.
Why were my search results not very helpful?
When initiating a search, be sure to check the spelling of the search text; also, keep your search specific to 
return the most accurate results.

Obtaining Help while Working  
in an Office App
Help in the Office apps provides you with the ability to obtain help 
directly, without opening the Help window and initiating a search. For 
example, you may be unsure about how a particular command works, or 
you may be presented with a dialog box that you are not sure how to use.
Figure 116 shows one option for obtaining help while working in 
an Office app. If you want to learn more about a command, point to its 
button and wait for the ScreenTip to appear. If the Help icon appears in 
the ScreenTip, press the f1 key while pointing to the button to open the 
Help window associated with that command.
Figure 117 shows a dialog box that contains a Help button. Pressing 
the f1 key while the dialog box is displayed opens a Help window. The 
Help window contains help about that dialog box, if available. If no help 
file is available for that particular dialog box, then the main Help window 
opens.

What guidelines should you follow to plan your projects?
The process of communicating specific information is a learned, rational skill. Computers and software, especially Microsoft 
Office 2013, can help you develop ideas and present detailed information to a particular audience and minimize much of the 
laborious work of drafting and revising projects. No matter what method you use to plan a project, it is beneficial to follow 
some specific guidelines from the onset to arrive at a final product that is informative, relevant, and effective. Use some aspects 
of these guidelines every time you undertake a project, and others as needed in specific instances.
1.  Determine the project’s purpose.
a)  Clearly define why you are undertaking this assignment.
b)  Begin to draft ideas of how best to communicate information by handwriting ideas on paper; composing directly 
on a laptop, tablet, or mobile device; or developing a strategy that fits your particular thinking and writing style.
2.  Analyze your audience.
a) Learn about the people who will read, analyze, or view your work.
b) Determine their interests and needs so that you can present the information they need to know and omit the 
information they already possess.
c)  Form a mental picture of these people or find photos of people who fit this profile so that you can develop a 
project with the audience in mind.
3.  Gather possible content.
a) Locate existing information that may reside in spreadsheets, databases, or other files.
b) Conduct a web search to find relevant websites.
c)  Read pamphlets, magazine and newspaper articles, and books to gain insights of how others have approached your topic.
d) Conduct personal interviews to obtain perspectives not available by any other means.
e) Consider video and audio clips as potential sources for material that might complement or support the factual data 
you uncover.

Office 2013 and Windows 8 Chapter
STUDENT  ASSIGNMENTS
Essential Concepts and Skills   Office 2013 and Windows 8 Chapter   OFF 83
4.  Determine what content to present to your audience.
a)  Write three or four major ideas you want an audience member to remember after reading or viewing 
your project.
b)  Envision your project’s endpoint, the key fact you wish to emphasize, so that all project elements lead to 
this final element.
c)  Determine relevant time factors, such as the length of time to develop the project, how long readers will 
spend reviewing your project, or the amount of time allocated for your speaking engagement.
d)  Decide whether a graph, photo, or artistic element can express or enhance a particular concept.
e)  Be mindful of the order in which you plan to present the content, and place the most important material 
at the top or bottom of the page, because readers and audience members generally remember the first 
and last pieces of information they see and hear.
How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require 
you to think beyond the assigned file. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your 
instructor. Possible formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that 
contains the answer; present your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio 
or video using a webcam, smartphone, or portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.

1: Creating Beginning Files for Classes
Personal
You are taking the following classes: Introduction to Sociology, Chemistry, Calculus, and 
­Marketing. Create folders for each of the classes. Create a folder structure that will store the 
­documents for each of these classes. Use Word to create a Word document with the name of 
each class and the class meeting locations and times. Use PowerPoint to begin creating a simple 
lab ­presentation for your chemistry class. It should begin with a title slide containing the text, 
­Chemical Reactions. ­Create and save a database named Companies for your marketing class. The 
database does not need to contain any data. In the Calculus folder, create an Excel spreadsheet with 
the text, Excel Formulas, in cell A1. Use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter to 
create the folders and files, and store the files in their respective locations. Submit your assignment 
in the format specified by your instructor.
 You made several decisions while determining the folder structure in this assignment. What was 
the rationale behind these decisions? Are there any other decisions that also might have worked?

Professional
Your boss at the music store where you work part-time has asked for help with organizing his files. 
After looking through the files, you decided upon a file structure for her to use, including the fol-
lowing folders: CDs, DVDs, and general merchandise. Think about the different types of CDs, 
DVDs, and general merchandise that might be sold at your store, and create a folder structure that 
will be used to store information about the three types of items (CDs, DVDs, and general mer-
chandise), and also can organize the different types of each item. For example, general merchandise 
might include items such as clothing, portable media players, and accessories. Use the concepts and 
techniques presented in this chapter to create the folders. Submit your assignment in the format

Introduction to Office 365
Microsoft Office 365 uses the cloud to deliver a subscription-based service offering the 
newest Office suite and much more. The Microsoft cloud provides Office software and 
information stored on remote servers all over the world. Your documents are located 
online or on the cloud, which provides you access to your information anywhere using 
a PC, Mac, tablet, mobile phone, or other device with an Internet connection. For 
businesses and students alike, Office 365 offers significant cost savings compared to the 
traditional cost of purchasing Microsoft Office 2013. In addition to the core desktop 
Office suite, Office 365 provides access to email, calendars, conferencing, file sharing, 
and website design, which sync across multiple devices.
Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to a collection of computer servers that house 
resources users access through the Internet (Figure 1). These resources include email 
messages, schedules, music, photos, videos, games, websites, programs, apps, servers, 
storage, and more. Instead of accessing these resources on your computer or mobile 
device, you access them on the cloud.

Office 365
CLD 3
Cloud computing can help businesses be more efficient and save them money by 
shifting usage and the consumption of resources, such as servers and programs, from 
a local environment to the Internet. For example, an employee working during the 
day in California could use computing resources located in an office in London that is 
closed for the evening. When the company in California uses the computing resources, 
it pays a fee that is based on the amount of computing time and other resources it 
consumes, much in the same way that consumers pay utility companies for the amount 
of electricity they use. 
Cloud computing is changing how users access and pay for software applications. 
Fading fast are the days when software packages were sold in boxes at a physical 
store location with a one-time purchase software license fee. Instead, the new pricing 
structure is a subscription-based model, where users pay a monthly or annual fee for 
the software that you can use on multiple devices. The cloud-based Office 365 offers 
the Office suite with added features that allow you to communicate and collaborate 
with others in real time.
When you create a free Microsoft account, do you get free cloud storage space?
Yes, when you create a free Microsoft account at Outlook.com, you have access to 7 GB of cloud 
storage for any type of files.

What Is Office 365?
Office 365 (Office365.com) is a collection of programs and services, which 
includes the Microsoft Office 2013 suite, file storage, online collaboration, and 
file synchronization, as shown in Figure 2 on the next page. You can access these 
services using your computer, browser, or supported mobile device. For example, a 
business has two options for providing Office to their employees. A business could 
purchase Office 2013 and install the software on company computers and servers; 
however, this traditional Office 2013 package with perpetual licensing does not 
include the communication and collaboration tools. Employees could not access 
the Office software if they were not using their work computers. In contrast, if 
the business purchases a monthly subscription to Office 365, each employee has 
access to the Office suite on up to five different computers, whether at home 
or work; company-wide email; web conferencing; website creation capabilities; 
cloud storage; and shared files. For a lower price, Office 365 provides many more 
features. In addition, a business may prefer a subscription plan with predictable 
monthly costs and no up-front infrastructure costs.

Office 2013 and Office 365 Features Comparison
Office 2013 is the name of the perpetual software package that includes 
individual applications that can be installed on a single computer. An Office 365 
subscription comes with a license to install the software on multiple PCs or Macs at 
the same time, giving you more flexibility to use your Office products in your home, 
school, or workplace, whether on a computer or a mobile device. Office 365 provides 
the Office 2013 programs as part of a subscription service that includes online storage, 
sharing, and syncing via Microsoft cloud services as shown in Table 1. 
Office 365 is available in business, consumer, education, and government 
editions. Office 365 combines the full version of the Microsoft Office desktop suite 
with cloud-based versions of Microsoft’s communications and collaboration services. 
The subscription package includes: 
•	 Microsoft Exchange online for shared email and calendars
•	 Microsoft SharePoint Online for shared file access and public website creation
•	 Microsoft Office Web apps for browser viewing
•	 Microsoft Lync Online for communication services

Subscription-Based Office 365 Plans
Microsoft provides various subscription plans for Office 365 with different 
benefits for each individual or organization. Subscription plans include Office 365 
Home Premium for home users, Office 365 University for students, Office 365 
Small Business, Office 365 Small Business Premium, Office 365 Midsize Business, 
and Office 365 Enterprise and Government. During the Office 365 sign-up process, 
you create a Microsoft email address and password to use on your multiple devices. 
A single subscription to an Office 365 Home Premium account can cover an entire 
household. The Office 365 Home Premium subscription allows up to five concurrent 
installations by using the same email address and password combination. This means 
that your mother could be on the main family computer while you use your tablet 
and smartphone at the same time. You each can sign in with your individual Microsoft 
accounts using your settings and accessing your own documents using a single 
Office 365 subscription.
The Office 365 University subscription plan is designed for higher-education 
full-time and part-time students, faculty, and staff. By submitting the proper 
credentials, such as a school email address, students and faculty can purchase Office 365 
University, including Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Outlook, Publisher, and 
OneNote. A one-time payment covers a four-year subscription. In addition, Office 365 
University provides users with 27 GB of SkyDrive cloud storage rather than the free 
7 GB provided by a Microsoft account, and 60 Skype world minutes per month for 
videoconferencing. Students have the option of renewing for another four years, for  
a total of eight years. The Office 365 University edition is limited to two computers 
(PC or Mac).

CLD 6   Office 365   Essentials
The Microsoft Office 365 Business Plans can provide full support for employees 
to work from any location, whether they are in their traditional business office, 
commuting to and from work across the country, or working from a home office. 
Office 365 small business plans (Small Business and Small Business Premium) are best 
for companies with up to 10 employees, but can accommodate up to 25 users. Office 
365 Midsize Business accommodates from 11 to 300 users. Office 365 Enterprise Plan 
fits organizations ranging in size from a single employee to 50,000-plus users. Each 
employee can install Microsoft Office 365 on five different computers.
First Look at Office 365
Microsoft Office 365 subscription plans offer all the same applications that are 
available in the Microsoft Office Professional 2013 suite in addition to multiple 
communication and collaboration tools. With Office 365 you can retrieve, edit, and 
save Office documents on the Office 365 cloud, coauthor documents in real time 
with others, and quickly initiate computer-based calls, instant messages, and web 
conferences with others.
Productivity Tools
Whether you are inserting audio and video into a Word document to create a 
high-impact business plan proposal or utilizing the visualization tools in Excel to chart 
the return on investment of a new mobile marketing program, Office 365 premium plans 
deliver the full Office product with the same features as the latest version of Microsoft 
Office. Office 365 uses a quick-start installation technology, called Click-to-Run, that 
downloads and installs the basics within minutes, so that users are able to start working 
almost immediately. It also includes Office on Demand, which streams Office to 
Windows 7- and Windows 8-based PCs for work performed on public computers.  
The single-use copy that is installed temporarily on the Windows computer does not 
count toward the device limit. No installation is necessary when using Office on Demand, 
and the applications disappear from the computer once you are finished using them. If 
you have a document on a USB drive or on SkyDrive that you need to edit on another 
PC, you can use Office on Demand to get the full version of Word in just a few minutes.
In effect, the Office 365 subscription provides access to the full Office 
applications wherever you are working. When you access your Office 365 account 
management panel, three choices are listed: 32- and 64-bit versions of Office 2013, and 
Office for Mac. Selecting the third option will initiate a download of an installer that 
must be run in the standard OS X fashion. When you install Office 365 on a Mac, the 
most current Mac version of Office is installed. 
Unlike Google, which offers online documents, spreadsheets, and presentations called Google 
Docs, Microsoft Office 365 installs locally on your computer in addition to being available online. 
Google Docs is entirely browser based, which means if you are not connected to the Internet, 
you cannot access your Google Docs files.

Essentials   Office 365   CLD 7
Email and Calendars
In business, sharing information is essential to meeting the needs of your 
customers and staff. Office 365 offers shared access to business email, calendars, and 
contacts using Exchange Online from a computer, tablet, phone, and browser. The 
cloud-based Exchange Online enables business people to access Outlook information 
from anywhere at any time, while eliminating the cost of purchasing and maintaining 
servers to store data. If you need to meet with a colleague about a new project, you 
can compare calendars to view availability, confirm conference room availability, 
share project contacts, search email messages related to the project, and send email 
invitations to the project meeting. Exchange Online also allows you to search and 
access your company’s address list.
Online Meetings
When you are working with a team on a project that 
requires interaction, email and text communications can slow the 
communications process. Microsoft Lync connects you with others 
by facilitating real-time, interactive presentations and meetings 
over the Internet using both video and audio calling. As shown in 
Figure 3, you can conduct an online meeting with a team member 
or customer that includes an instant messaging conversation, audio, 
high-definition video, virtual whiteboards, and screen sharing. If the 
customer does not have an Office 365 subscription, they still can 
join the meeting through the invitation link, which runs the Lync 
Web App.
Skype is another tool in the Office 365 subscription, which 
enables users to place video calls to computers and smartphones 
and voice calls to landlines. Skype also supports instant message 
and file sharing to computers and mobile devices. While Skype may 
be adequate for simple communication, Lync provides for more 
robust, comprehensive communications. These robust features 
include high-definition (HD) videoconferencing capabilities, a 
whiteboard, and a larger audience. Using Lync, meeting attendees 
simultaneously can view up to five participants’ video, identify the 
active speaker, and associate names with faces. Lync supports up to 
250 attendees per meeting. Unlike Skype, Lync meetings can be 
recorded for replaying at a later time. This enables businesses and 
schools to schedule meetings or organize online classes using Lync 
capabilities. 
File Sharing
Office 365 includes a team site, which is a password-protected 
portal that supports sharing of large, difficult-to-email files and 
provides a single location for the latest versions of documents. In 
business, for example, colleagues working on common projects can 
save valuable time by being able to access instantly the latest master 
copy of each document. Security can be managed through different

levels of user access so that users see only what they are supposed to see. Office 365 
provides access to shared files using the cloud, making writing, editing, and sharing 
documents easier. If a construction company creates a commercial bid for a building 
project, the customers can be invited to view an Excel spreadsheet bid, construction 
timetable with a shared calendar, and an Access database of all the materials needed 
using the file sharing feature online.
Website Creation
Office 365 business plan subscriptions include a built-in hosted public website, 
where customers and clients can find an online storefront of a company. This public 
website, called the Website, can be customized to market a company by using various 
templates within the Office 365 cloud. The website creation tools include those for 
adding a theme, graphics, fonts, maps, directions, blogs, stock tickers, slide shows, 
PayPal, weather, and videos to interact with the website’s visitors.
Synchronization
Office 365 subscription plans provide a central place to store and access your 
documents and business information. A feature of Office 365 ensures the original 
and backup computer files in two or more locations are identical through a process 
called Active Directory Synchronization. For example, if you open a PowerPoint 
presentation on your smartphone while you are riding a city bus and then add a new 
slide as you head to school, the PowerPoint presentation automatically is synced with 
Office 365. When you arrive on campus and open the PowerPoint presentation on a 
school computer, your new slide already is part of the finished slide show. By storing 
your files in Office 365, you can access your files on another computer if your home 
computer fails, with no loss of time or important information. When using your 
mobile phone’s data plan, you do not need to search for a Wi-Fi hot spot to connect 
to the Office 365 cloud. Computer labs in schools can be configured to synchronize 
automatically all student files to Office 365 online. 
Multiple Device Access to Office 365
With a single sign-in process, Office 365 provides access to multiple computers 
and mobile devices, including Android smartphones and tablets, Apple iPhones and 
iPads, Windows phones, and Blackberry phones. After you configure your devices’ 
email settings, you can view your Microsoft account calendar, contacts, and email. Your 
personalized settings, preferences, and documents can be synchronized among all the 
different devices included in your Office 365 premium subscription. With the mobility 
of Office 365, students and employees can work anywhere, accessing information and 
responding to email requests immediately. If you lose your phone, Office 365 includes 
a feature that allows you to remotely wipe your phone clean of any data. By wiping 
your phone’s data, you can prevent any unauthorized access to sensitive information, 
such as your banking information, passwords, and contacts, as well as discourage 
identity theft. Because your phone contacts and other information are stored on the 
Microsoft cloud, damaged or lost equipment is never a problem.

A thief can be quite resourceful if he or she steals your phone. Before you can alert your parents 
or spouse to the theft, they might receive a text from “you” asking for your ATM or credit card 
PIN number. Your parents or spouse might then reply with the PIN number. Your bank account 
could be emptied in minutes.

Teams Using Office 365 in Business
In the business world, rarely does an employee work in isolation. Companies need 
their employees to collaborate, whether they work in the same office or in locations 
around the world. Telecommuters working from home can communicate as if they 
were on-site by using a common team website and conferencing software. SharePoint 
Online and Lync Online provide seamless communication. 
Small business subscription plans as low as $6.00 per user per month allow 
employees to create and store Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint 
presentations online and communicate with one another via email, instant messaging, 
or video chat as they work on projects together. As shown in Figure 4, a team portal 
page is shown when you subscribe at https://portal.microsoftonline.com. Larger 
companies and those requiring more features can take advantage of the Office 365 
business premium package, which, in addition to the features listed above, provides 
access to the Office 365 portal website and eliminates the effort and cost of the users 
maintaining their own costly computer servers.

Office 365 provides the tools to plan meetings. Users can share calendars side 
by side, view availability, and suggest meeting times from shared calendars. Typically, 
a SharePoint team administrator or website owner establishes a folder structure to 
share and manage documents. The team website is fully searchable online, making 
locating and sharing data more efficient than using a local server. With a team website, 
everyone on the team has a central location to store and find all the information for a 
project, client, or department, as shown in Figure 5.

Real-Time Communications Using Lync
Lync Online is Microsoft’s server platform for online team communications 
and comes bundled with Office 365 business subscriptions. As shown in Figure 7, 
Lync connects in real time to allow instant messaging, videoconferencing, and voice 
communications; it also integrates with email and Microsoft Office applications. 
Website Design Using SharePoint
SharePoint provides templates to create a professional looking, public website 
for an online presence to market your business. As shown in Figure 6, a local pet 
sitting business is setting up a business website by customizing a SharePoint template. 
SharePoint Public Website includes features within the Design Manager that you use 
to customize and design your website by adding your own images, forms, style sheets, 
maps, themes, and social networking tools. When you finish customizing your business 
site, you can apply your own domain name to the site. A domain is a unique web 
address that identifies where your website can be found. Office 365 SharePoint hosts 
your website as part of your subscription. Your customers easily can find your business 
online and learn about your services.

Lync allows you to connect with staff at remote locations using instant messaging 
capabilities, desktop sharing, videoconferencing, and shared agendas or documents. Lync 
is integrated into Office 365, which allows staff to start communicating from within the 
applications in which they currently are working. For example, while an employee is 
creating a PowerPoint presentation for a new product line, as shown in Figure 8, Lync 
enables him or her to collaborate with the entire team about the details of the product 
presentation. The team can view the presenter’s screen displaying the PowerPoint 
presentation. The presenter can share control with any member of the team and can share 
his or her screen at any time during the Lync meeting.

Users can send a Lync meeting request to schedule a team meeting, or an 
impromptu conversation can be started immediately using the Meet Now feature. 
Participants receive a Lync meeting request link via an email message, and when 
they click the meeting request link, Lync automatically connects them to the 
online conference. If the participant does not have Lync installed, the Lync Web 
App automatically connects to the Lync meeting through the user’s PC or Mac 
OS X browser. If a participant is away from his or her computer, he or she still can 
participate using the Lync Mobile apps for Windows Phone, iOS, and Android. 
As shown in Figure 9, Lync utilizes instant messaging (IM), allowing two or 
more people to share text messages. They can communicate in real time, similar 
to a voice conversation. In addition to a simple instant message, Lync provides a 
feature called persistent chat, which allows end-users to participate in a working 
session of instant messages that is persistent or sustained over a specified amount 
of time in a moderated chat room. Consider having an instant messaging session 
with a group of colleagues in different parts of your organization, regardless 
of geographic region, where you all are working on the same project. Over the 
course of the project, different people post questions and concerns, and others are 
able to respond to all those who have subscribed to your topic or been admitted 
to the chat room. Instead of a long trail of email messages, a team can keep 
information in a controlled environment with a full history of the discussion in 
one location.
Figure 9
© 2014 Cengage Learning
Lync also delivers support for full high-definition (HD) videoconferencing, 
so that a team can have a clear view of the participants, products, and demos. 
Before you join the video feed, you can preview your video feed to make sure your 
video camera is at the correct angle, your image is centered within the video frame, 
and that your room lighting provides for a clear image. The Lync preview option 
is important in creating a positive first impression over video. Your audio devices 
can be tested for clarity to make sure your headset, microphone, and speakers are 
functioning properly.

CLD 14   Office 365   Essentials
Finally, by enabling the recording feature, Lync meetings and conversations 
can be captured for viewing at a later time. For instance, you can capture the audio, 
video, instant messaging (IM), screen sharing, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, 
whiteboard, and polling portions of the Lync session and then play them back just 
as they transpired during the live Lync event. The meeting recordings can be made 
available to others so that they can view all or part of the Lync event. Instructors can 
record Lync online class sessions for students who were unable to attend the original 
presentation. The recording starts in Microsoft Lync; recordings then can be viewed 
within the Recording Manager feature.
Lync provides a polling feature that presenters can use to ask the participants’ 
opinions during a meeting (Figure 10). The poll question can consist of up to seven 
possible choices. The presenter has the option to view the results privately or share the 
results with the entire group.

Introduction
To advertise a sale, promote a business, publicize an event, or convey a message to 
the community, you may want to create a flyer and hand it out in person or post 
it in a public location. Libraries, schools, religious organizations, grocery stores, 
coffee shops, and other places often provide bulletin boards or windows for flyers. 
You also see flyers posted on webpages or as email messages.
Flyers announce personal items for sale or rent (car, boat, apartment); garage 
or block sales; services being offered (animal care, housecleaning, lessons, tours); 
membership, sponsorship, or donation requests (club, religious organization, charity); 
and other messages, such as a lost or found pet.
Project — Flyer with a Picture
Individuals and businesses create flyers to gain public attention. Flyers, which usually 
are a single page in length, are an inexpensive means of reaching the community. Many 
flyers, however, go unnoticed because they are designed poorly.
The project in this chapter follows general guidelines and uses Word to create 
the flyer shown in Figure 1 – 1. This colorful, eye-catching flyer announces tour 
adventures. The picture of the tour group on the mountain trail, taken with a digital 
camera, entices passersby or viewers to stop and look at the flyer. The headline on 
the flyer is large and colorful to draw attention into the text. The body copy below 
the picture briefly describes the tours, along with a bulleted list that concisely 
highlights important tour information. The signature line of the flyer calls attention 
to the contact phone number. The word, breathtaking, and the signature line are 
in a different color so that they stand apart from the rest of the text on the flyer. 
Finally, the graphical page border nicely frames and complements the contents of 
the flyer.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the flyer shown in Figure 1 – 1. 
The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform as you progress 
through this chapter:
1.	 enter text in a new document. 
2.	 format the text in the flyer.
3.	 insert a picture, called Mountain Trail, in the flyer.
4.	 format the picture in the flyer.
5.	 enhance the page with a border and spacing.
6.	 correct errors and revise text in the flyer.
7.	 print or read the flyer.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 2 FORMAT TEXT activity.

Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter. 
To Run Word and Create a Blank Document
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the Search box to run Word based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Word on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter. 
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for a Word 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains a Word 2013 
tile, tap or click it to run Word and then proceed to Step 5; if the Start screen does not 
contain the Word 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search for the Word app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of the 
screen to display the Charms bar and then tap or click the Search charm on the Charms 
bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   Word   as the search text in the Search box and watch the search results appear 
in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click Word 2013 in the search results to run Word.
	5	
Tap or click the Blank document thumbnail on the Word start screen to create a blank 
document and display it in the Word window.
	6	
If the Word window is not maximized, tap or click the Maximize button on its title bar 
to maximize the window.
For an introduction to 
Windows and instruction 
about how to perform 
basic Windows tasks,

where you can learn 
how to resize windows, 
change screen resolution, 
create folders, move 
and rename files, use 
Windows Help, and 
much more.
One of the few 
differences between 
Windows 7 and 
Windows 8 occurs in the 
steps to run Word. If you 
are using Windows 7, 
click the Start button,  
type   Word   in the 
‘Search programs and 
files’ box, click Word 
2013, and then, if 
necessary, maximize

To Display Formatting Marks
1 enter text | 2 format text | 3 insert picture | 4 format picture
5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
You may find it helpful to display formatting marks while working in a document. Why? Formatting marks 
indicate where in a document you press the enter key, spacebar, and other nonprinting characters. A formatting 
mark is a character that Word displays on the screen but is not visible on a printed document. For example, the 
paragraph mark (¶) is a formatting mark that indicates where you pressed the enter key. A raised dot (·) shows 
where you pressed the spacebar. Formatting marks are discussed as they appear on the screen.
Depending on settings made during previous Word sessions, your Word screen already may display 
formatting marks (Figure 1 – 4). The following step displays formatting marks, if they do not show already on 
the screen.

•	Press the enter key to move the insertion point 
to the beginning of the next line (Figure 1 – 3).
Why did blank space appear between the 
headline and the insertion point? 
Each time you press the enter key, Word 
creates a new paragraph and inserts blank 
space between the two paragraphs. Later in 
this chapter, you will learn how to increase and 
decrease the spacing between paragraphs.
Q&A

screen (Figure 1 – 4).
What if I make an error while typing? 
You can press the backspace key until you have deleted the text in error and then retype the text correctly. 
What is the purpose of the Spelling and Grammar Check icon on the status bar? 
The Spelling and Grammar Check icon displays either a check mark to indicate the entered text contains no spelling 
or grammar errors, or an X to indicate that it found potential errors. Word flags potential errors in the document 
with a red, green, or blue wavy underline. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to fix flagged errors.

In the flyer, the digital picture of the mountain trail appears between the headline and body copy. You will 
not insert this picture, however, until after you enter and format all text. Why? Although you can format text and 
insert pictures in any order, for illustration purposes, this chapter formats all text first before inserting the picture. Thus, you 
leave a blank line in the document as a placeholder for the picture. 
To enter a blank line in a document, press the enter key without typing any text on the line. The 
following step inserts one blank line below the headline.

What if I do not want formatting marks to show on the screen? 
You can hide them by tapping or clicking the ‘Show/Hide ¶’ button (HOME tab | Paragraph group) again. It is 
recommended that you display formatting marks so that you visually can identify when you press the enter key, 
spacebar, and other keys associated with nonprinting characters. Most of the document windows presented in this 
book, therefore, show formatting marks.

Wordwrap
Wordwrap allows you to type words in a paragraph continually without pressing 
the enter key at the end of each line. As you type, if a word extends beyond the right 
margin, Word also automatically positions that word on the next line along with the 
insertion point.
Word creates a new paragraph each time you press the enter key. Thus, 
as you type text in the document window, do not press the enter key when the 
insertion point reaches the right margin. Instead, press the enter key only in these 
circumstances:
1.	 To insert a blank line(s) in a document (as shown in the previous steps)
2.	 To begin a new paragraph
3.	 To terminate a short line of text and advance to the next line
4.	 To respond to questions or prompts in Word dialog boxes, task panes, and other

To Wordwrap Text as You Type

5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
The next step in creating the flyer is to type the body copy. Why? In many flyers, the body copy text appears 
below the headline. The following steps illustrate how the body copy text wordwraps as you enter it in the 
document.
1
•	Type the first sentence of the body copy:   Explore scenic trails with breathtaking views 
as you travel through meadows, forests, streams, and mountains in an off-road 
vehicle.
Why does my document wrap on different words?
The printer connected to a computer is one factor that can control where wordwrap occurs for each line in a 
document. Thus, it is possible that the same document could wordwrap differently if printed on different printers. 
Q&A
2
•	Press the enter key to 
position the insertion 
point on the next 
line in the document 
(Figure 1 – 8).
Spelling and Grammar Check
As you type text in a document, Word checks your typing for possible spelling 
and grammar errors. If all of the words you have typed are in Word’s dictionary and 
your grammar is correct, as mentioned earlier, the Spelling and Grammar Check icon 
on the status bar displays a check mark. Otherwise, the icon shows an X. In this case, 
Word flags the potential error in the document window with a red, green, or blue wavy 
underline. A red wavy underline means the flagged text is not in Word’s dictionary 
(because it is a proper name or misspelled). A green wavy underline indicates the 
text may be incorrect grammatically. A blue wavy underline indicates the text may 
contain a contextual spelling error, such as the misuse of homophones (words that are 
pronounced the same but that have different spellings or meanings, such as one and 
won). Although you can check the entire document for spelling and grammar errors at 
once, you also can check flagged errors as they appear on the screen.
A flagged word is not necessarily misspelled. For example, many names, 
abbreviations, and specialized terms are not in Word’s main dictionary. In these cases, 
you can instruct Word to ignore the flagged word. As you type, Word also detects 
duplicate words while checking for spelling errors. For example, if your document 
contains the phrase, to the the store, Word places a red wavy underline below the 
second occurrence of the word, the.

How should you organize text in a flyer?
The text in a flyer typically is organized into three areas: headline, body copy, and signature line. 
•	The headline is the first line of text on the flyer. It conveys the product or service being offered, such as a car for sale, 
personal lessons, or sightseeing tours, or the benefit that will be gained, such as a convenience, better performance, greater 
security, higher earnings, or more comfort, or it can contain a message, such as a lost or found pet.
•	The body copy consists of text between the headline and the signature line. This text highlights the key points of the 
message in as few words as possible. It should be easy to read and follow. While emphasizing the positive, the body copy 
must be realistic, truthful, and believable.
•	The signature line, which is the last line of text on the flyer, contains contact information or identifies a call to action.

To Save a Document
You have performed many tasks while creating this document and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the document on 
your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation.
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your 
files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains a Word folder (for 
your assignments). Thus, these steps save the document in the Word folder in the

Navigating a Document
You view only a portion of a document on the screen through the document 
window. At some point when you type text or insert graphics, Word probably will scroll 
the top or bottom portion of the document off the screen. Although you cannot see the 
text and graphics once they scroll off the screen, they remain in the document.
You can use touch gestures, the keyboard, or a mouse to scroll to a different 
location in a document and/or move the insertion point around a document. If you 
are using a touch screen, simply use your finger to slide the document up or down to 
display a different location in the document and then tap to move the insertion point 
to a new location. When you use the keyboard, the insertion point automatically moves 
when you press the desired keys. For example, the previous steps used the end key 
to move the insertion point to the end of the current line. Table 1 – 1 outlines various 
techniques to navigate a document using the keyboard.
With the mouse, you can use the scroll arrows or the scroll box on the scroll bar 
to display a different portion of the document in the document window and then click 
the mouse to move the insertion point to that location. Table 1 – 2 explains various 
techniques for using the scroll bar to scroll vertically with the mouse.

BTW
Minimize Wrist 
Injury
Computer users frequently 
switch among touch 
gestures, the keyboard, and 
the mouse during a word 
processing session; such 
switching strains the wrist. 
To help prevent wrist injury, 
minimize switching. For 
instance, if your fingertips 
already are on the screen, 
use your finger to slide the 
document to a new location. 
If your fingers are already on 
the keyboard, use keyboard 
keys to scroll. If your hand 
already is on the mouse, use 
the mouse to scroll.

Formatting Paragraphs and Characters
With the text for the flyer entered, the next step is to format, or change the 
appearance of, its text. A paragraph encompasses the text from the first character in 
the paragraph up to and including its paragraph mark (¶). Paragraph formatting is 
the process of changing the appearance of a paragraph. For example, you can center 
or add bullets to a paragraph. Characters include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, 
and symbols. Character formatting is the process of changing the way characters 
appear on the screen and in print. You use character formatting to emphasize certain 
words and improve readability of a document. For example, you can color, italicize, 
or underline characters. Often, you apply both paragraph and character formatting to 
the same text. For example, you may center a paragraph (paragraph formatting) and 
underline some of the characters in the same paragraph (character formatting).
Although you can format paragraphs and characters before you type, many Word 
users enter text first and then format the existing text. Figure 1 – 13a on the next page 
shows the flyer in this chapter before formatting its paragraphs and characters. Figure 
1 – 13b on the next page shows the flyer after formatting. As you can see from the two 
figures, a document that is formatted is easier to read and looks more professional. The 
following pages discuss how to format the flyer so that it looks like Figure 1 – 13b.
BTW
Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 
101, a good practice would 
be to save all Word files in 
a Word folder in a CIS 101 
folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of 
this book.
If you are using your 
finger on a touch screen 
and are having difficulty 
completing the steps in this 
chapter, consider using a 
stylus. Many people find it 
easier to be precise with a 
stylus than with a finger. 
In addition, with a stylus 
you see the pointer. If you 
still are having trouble 
completing the steps with a 
stylus, try using a mouse.

WD 14   Word Chapter 1   Creating, Formatting, and Editing a Word Document with a Picture
Font, Font Sizes, and Themes
Characters that appear on the screen are a specific shape and size. The font, or 
typeface, defines the appearance and shape of the letters, numbers, and special characters. In 
Word, the default font usually is Calibri (shown in Figure 1 – 14). You can leave characters 
in the default font or change them to a different font. Font size specifies the size of the 
characters and is determined by a measurement system called points. A single point is about 
1/72 of one inch in height. The default font size in Word typically is 11 (Figure 1 – 14). 
Thus, a character with a font size of 11 is about 11/72 or a little less than 1/6 of one inch in 
height. You can increase or decrease the font size of characters in a document.
A document theme is a set of unified formats for fonts, colors, and graphics. 
Word includes a variety of document themes to assist you with coordinating these 
visual elements in a document. The default theme fonts are Calibri Light for headings 
and Calibri for body text. By changing the document theme, you quickly can give your 
document a new look. You also can define your own document themes.
How do I know which formats to use in a flyer?
In a flyer, consider the following formatting suggestions.
•	Increase the font size of characters. Flyers usually are posted on a bulletin board or in a window. Thus, the font 
size should be as large as possible so that passersby easily can read the flyer. To give the headline more impact, its font size 
should be larger than the font size of the text in the body copy. If possible, make the font size of the signature line larger 
than the body copy but smaller than the headline.
•	Change the font of characters. Use fonts that are easy to read. Try to use only two different fonts in a flyer; for 
example, use one for the headline and the other for all other text. Too many fonts can make the flyer visually confusing. 
•	Change the paragraph alignment. The default alignment for paragraphs in a document is left-aligned, that is, flush 
at the left margin of the document with uneven right edges. Consider changing the alignment of some of the paragraphs to 
add interest and variety to the flyer.
•	Highlight key paragraphs with bullets. A bulleted paragraph is a paragraph that begins with a dot or other symbol. 
Use bulleted paragraphs to highlight important points in a flyer.
•	Emphasize important words. To call attention to certain words or lines, you can underline them, italicize them, or bold 
them. Use these formats sparingly, however, because overuse will minimize their effect and make the flyer look too busy.
•	Use color. Use colors that complement each other and convey the meaning of the flyer. Vary colors in terms of hue and 
brightness. Headline colors, for example, can be bold and bright. Signature lines should stand out more than body copy but 
less than headlines. Keep in mind that too many colors can detract from the flyer and make it difficult to read.
CONSIDER THIS

Formatting Marks
With some fonts, the 
formatting marks will not 
be displayed properly on 
the screen. For example, the 
raised dot that signifies a 
blank space between words 
may be displayed behind a 
character instead of in the 
blank space, causing the 
characters to look incorrect.

The headline in the flyer currently is left-aligned (Figure 1 – 14). Why? Word, by default left-aligns text, 
unless you specifically change the alignment. You want the headline to be centered, that is, positioned horizontally 
between the left and right margins on the page. Recall that Word considers a single short line of text, such as 
the one-word headline, a paragraph. Thus, you will center the paragraph containing the headline. The following 
steps center a paragraph.

•	Tap or click HOME on the ribbon 
to display the HOME tab.
•	Tap or click somewhere in the 
paragraph to be centered (in this 
case, the headline) to position the 
insertion point in the paragraph 
to be formatted (Figure 1 – 14).

5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
The default font size of 11 point is too small for a headline in a flyer. To increase the font size of the 
characters in the headline, you first must select the line of text containing the headline. Why? If you increase font 
size of text without selecting any text, Word will increase the font size only of the word containing the insertion point. The 
following steps select a line.
Formatting Single versus Multiple Paragraphs  
and Characters
As shown on the previous pages, to format a single paragraph, simply move the 
insertion point in the paragraph to make it the current paragraph, and then format the 
paragraph. Similarly, to format a single word, position the insertion point in the word 
to make it the current word, and then format the word.
To format multiple paragraphs or words, however, you first must select the 
paragraphs or words you want to format and then format the selection. 
1
•	If you are using a mouse, move 
the pointer to the left of the 
line to be selected (in this case, 
the headline) until the pointer 
changes to a right-pointing block 
arrow (Figure 1 – 16).
2
•	If you are using a touch screen, 
double-tap to the left of the line 
to be selected to select the line; if 
you are using a mouse, while the 
pointer is a right-pointing block 
arrow, click the mouse to select 
the entire line to the right of the 
pointer (Figure 1 – 17).
Why is the selected text shaded 
gray? 
If your screen normally displays 
dark letters on a light background, 
Q&A
which is the default setting in Word, then selected text displays with a light shading color,  
such as gray, on the dark letters. Note that the selection that appears on the text does not print.

5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
When you shade text, Word colors the rectangular area behind any text or graphics. If the text to shade is 
a paragraph, Word shades the area from the left margin to the right margin of the current paragraph. To shade a 
paragraph, place the insertion point in the paragraph. To shade any other text, you must first select the text to be 
shaded. 
This flyer uses green as the shading color for the headline. Why? To make the headline of the flyer more 
eye-catching, you shade it. The following steps shade a paragraph.
1
•	Tap or click 
somewhere in the 
paragraph to be 
shaded (in this 
case, the headline) 
to position the 
insertion point in 
the paragraph to be 
formatted.
•	Tap or click the 
Shading arrow (HOME 
tab | Paragraph group) 
to display the Shading 
gallery (Figure 1 – 26).
If I am using a mouse, what if I click the Shading button by mistake? 
Click the Shading arrow and proceed with Step 2. If you are using a touch screen, you 
may not have a separate Shading button. 
 Experiment
•	If you are using a mouse, point to various colors in the Shading gallery and watch the 
shading color of the current paragraph change.

dark shading color 
to dark text?

The selected buttons and boxes on the HOME tab show formatting characteristics of the location of the insertion point. 
With the insertion point in the word, breathtaking, the HOME tab shows these formats: 24-point Calibri italic font. 
Why did the appearance of the Redo button change?

To Use the Mini Toolbar to Format Text
1 enter text | 2 format text | 3 insert picture | 4 format picture
5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
Recall from the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book that the mini toolbar 
automatically appears based on certain tasks you perform. Why? Word places commonly used buttons and boxes on the 
mini toolbar for your convenience. If you do not use the mini toolbar, it disappears from the screen. All commands on the 
mini toolbar also exist on the ribbon. 
The following steps use the mini toolbar to change the color and font size of text in the signature line of 
the flyer.
1
•	If you are using a 
touch screen, double-
tap to the left of the 
line to be selected 
to select the line, 
and then tap the 
selection to display 
the mini toolbar; 
if you are using a 
mouse, move the 
pointer to the left 
of the line to be 
selected until the 
pointer changes to a 
right-pointing block 
arrow and then click 
to select the line 
and display the mini 
toolbar (Figure 1 – 37).

Why does my mini toolbar look different than the one in Figure 1 – 37? 
If you are using a touch screen, the buttons and boxes on the mini toolbar differ. For example, it contains a ‘Show 
Context Menu’ button at the far-right edge, which you tap to display a shortcut menu.

To Select a Group of Words
1 enter text | 2 format text | 3 insert picture | 4 format picture
5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
To emphasize the contact phone number (555-8928), this text is underlined in the flyer. Because the 
phone number is separated with a hyphen, Word considers it a group of words. To format a group of words, you 
first must select them. Why? If you underline text without selecting any text first, Word will underline only the word 
containing the insertion point. The following steps select a group of words.
1
•	If you are using a touch screen, 
tap to position the insertion point 
in the text you want to select; if 
you are using a mouse, position 
the pointer immediately to the 
left of the first character of the 
text to be selected, in this case, 
the 5 in 555 (Figure 1 – 40).
Why did the shape of the pointer change? 
The pointer’s shape is an I-beam when positioned in unselected text in the document window. 
Q&A
2
•	If you are using a touch screen, 
drag the selection handle(s) to 
select the text to be formatted; if 
you are using a mouse, drag the 
pointer through the last character 
of the text to be selected, in this 
case, the 8 in the phone number 
(Figure 1 – 41).
Figure 1 – 41
Why did the pointer shape change again? 
When the pointer is positioned in selected text, its shape is a left-pointing block arrow.

Underlined text prints with an underscore (_) below each character. In the flyer, the contact phone 
number, 555-8928, in the signature line is underlined. Why? Underlines are used to emphasize or draw attention to 
specific text. The following step formats selected text with an underline.

Bold characters appear somewhat thicker and darker than those that are not bold. The steps on the next 
page format the text, off-road, in bold characters. Why? To further emphasize this text, it is bold in the flyer. Recall 
that if you want to format a single word, you simply position the insertion point in the word and then format the 
word. To format text that consists of more than one word, as you have learned previously, you select the text first.

position the insertion point in the text you want to select and then drag the selection handle(s) to select the text

What colors should I choose when creating documents?
When choosing color, associate the meaning of the color with your message:
•	Red expresses danger, power, or energy and often is associated with sports or physical exertion.
•	Brown represents simplicity, honesty, and dependability. 
•	Orange denotes success, victory, creativity, and enthusiasm. 
•	Yellow suggests sunshine, happiness, hope, liveliness, and intelligence.
•	Green symbolizes growth, healthiness, harmony, blooming, and healing and often is associated with safety or money.
•	Blue indicates integrity, trust, importance, confidence, and stability.
•	Purple represents wealth, power, comfort, extravagance, magic, mystery, and spirituality. 
•	White stands for purity, goodness, cleanliness, precision, and perfection.
•	Black suggests authority, strength, elegance, power, and prestige.
•	Gray conveys neutrality and, thus, often is found in backgrounds and other effects.

To Change Theme Colors

5 enhance page | 6 correct & revise | 7 print or read
A color scheme in Word is a document theme that identifies 12 complementary colors for text, 
background, accents, and links in a document. With more than 20 predefined color schemes, Word provides a 
simple way to coordinate colors in a document.
The default color scheme is called Office. In the flyer, you will change the color scheme from Office 
to Green. Why? You want the colors in the flyer to suggest growth, harmony, blooming, trust, and stability, which are 
conveyed by shades of greens and blues. In Word, the Green color scheme uses these colors. The following steps change 
theme colors.

Flyer (refer to page WD 47 for instructions), and continue following the steps from this location forward.
CONSIDER THIS
How do I locate a graphic file to use in a document?
To use a graphic in a Word document, the image must be stored digitally in a file. Files containing graphics are available from a 
variety of sources:
•	Microsoft has free digital images on the web for use in a document. Other websites also have images available, some of 
which are free, while others require a fee.
•	You can take a picture with a digital camera or camera phone and download it, which is the process of copying the digital 
picture from the camera or phone to your computer.
•	With a scanner, you can convert a printed picture, drawing, or diagram to a digital file.
If you receive a picture from a source other than yourself, do not use the file until you are certain it does not contain a virus. A 
virus is a computer program that can damage files and programs on your computer. Use an antivirus program to verify that 
any files you use are virus free.
Inserting and Formatting a Picture  
in a Word Document
With the text formatted in the flyer, the next step is to insert a digital picture in the 
flyer and format the picture. Flyers usually contain a graphical image(s), such as a 
picture, to attract the attention of passersby. In the following pages, you will perform 
these tasks:
1.	 Insert a digital picture into the flyer and then reduce its size.
2.	 Enlarge the size of the picture.
3. 	Change the look of the picture.

How do you know where to position a graphic on a flyer?
The content, size, shape, position, and format of a graphic should capture the interest of passersby, enticing them to stop and 
read the flyer. Often, the graphic is the center of attention and visually the largest element on a flyer. If you use colors in the 
graphical image, be sure they are part of the document’s color scheme.

Resizing includes both increasing and reducing the size of a graphic. The next step is to resize the picture 
so that it is larger in the flyer. Why? You want the graphic as large as possible on a single page flyer to draw the attention 
of passersby. The following steps resize a selected graphic.

A style is a named group of formatting characteristics. Word provides more than 25 picture styles. Why? 
Picture styles enable you easily to change a picture’s look to a more visually appealing style, including a variety of shapes, 
angles, borders, and reflections. The flyer in this chapter uses a style that applies a drop shadow to the picture. The 
following steps apply a picture style to a picture.

Word provides a variety of picture effects, such as shadows, reflections, glow, soft edges, bevel, and 3-D 
rotation. The difference between the effects and the styles is that each effect has several options, providing you 
with more control over the exact look of the image. 
In this flyer, the picture has a slight green glow effect and beveled edges. The following steps apply picture 
effects to the selected picture. Why? Picture effects enable you to further customize the a picture.

Enhancing the Page
With the text and graphics entered and formatted, the next step is to look at the page 
as a whole and determine if it looks finished in its current state. As you review the page, 
answer these questions:
•	Does it need a page border to frame its contents, or would a page border make it 
look too busy? 
•	Is the spacing between paragraphs and graphics on the page adequate? Do any 
sections of text or graphics look as if they are positioned too closely to the items 
above or below them?
•	Does the flyer have too much space at the top or bottom? Should the contents be 
centered vertically?
You determine that a graphical, color-coordinated border would enhance the 
flyer. You also notice that the flyer would look better proportioned if it had a little 
more space above and below the picture. You also want to ensure that the contents are 
centered vertically. The following pages make these enhancements to the flyer.

•	Tap or click ‘Turquoise, 5 pt glow, Accent color 6’ in the Glow gallery to apply the selected picture effect.
What if I wanted to discard formatting applied to a picture?
You would tap or click the Reset Picture button (PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT tab | Adjust group). To reset formatting and 
size, you would tap or click the Reset Picture arrow (PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT tab | Adjust group) and then tap or click

The default spacing above (before) a paragraph in Word is 0 points and below (after) is 8 points. In the 
flyer, you want to increase the spacing below the paragraph containing the headline and above the signature line. 
Why? The flyer spacing will look more balanced with spacing increased above and below these paragraphs. The following 
steps change the spacing above and below a paragraph.

to be adjusted, in this case, the paragraph 
containing the headline.

To Save an Existing Document with the Same File Name
You have made several modifications to the document since you last saved it. 
Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the document again. For 
an example of the step listed below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Document Properties
Word helps you organize and identify your files by using document properties, 
which are the details about a file such as the project author, title, and subject. For 
example, a class name or document topic can describe the file’s purpose or content.
Why would you want to assign document properties to a document?
Document properties are valuable for a variety of reasons:
•	Users can save time locating a particular file because they can view a file’s document properties without opening the document.
•	By creating consistent properties for files having similar content, users can better organize their documents.
•	Some organizations require Word users to add document properties so that other employees can view details about these files.
CONSIDER THIS
The more common document properties are standard and automatically updated 
properties. Standard properties are associated with all Microsoft Office files and 
include author, title, and subject. Automatically updated properties include file system 
properties, such as the date you create or change a file, and statistics, such as the file size.
To Change Document Properties
To change document properties, you would follow these steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view and then, if necessary, 
tap or click the Info tab in the Backstage view to display the Info gallery.

2.	 If the property you wish to change is displayed in the Properties list in the right 
pane of the Info gallery, try to tap or click to the right of the property. If a text box 
appears to the right of the property, type the text for the property in the text box, 
and then tap or click the Back button in the upper-left corner of the Backstage view 
to return to the Word window. Skip the remaining steps.
3.	 If the property you wish to change is not displayed in the Properties list in the right 
pane of the Info gallery or you cannot change it in the Info gallery, tap or click the 
Properties button in the right pane to display the Properties menu, and then tap or 
click ‘Show Document Panel’ on the Properties menu to close the Backstage view 
and display the Document Information Panel in the Word document window.
Why are some of the document properties in my Document Information Panel already 
filled in? 
The person who installed Office 2013 on your computer or network may have set or 
customized the properties. 
4.	 Type the desired text in the appropriate property text boxes.
What if the property I want to change is not displayed in the Document Information Panel?
Tap or click the Document Properties button in the Document Information Panel and 
then tap or click Advanced Properties on the menu to display the Properties dialog box. 
If necessary, tap or click the Summary tab (Properties dialog box) to display the Summary 
sheet, fill in the appropriate text boxes, and then tap or click the OK button.
5.	 Tap or click the ‘Close the Document Information Panel’ button at the right edge 
of the Document Information Panel so that the panel no longer appears in the 
Word document window.
To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of the 
account from the Account gallery in the Backstage view before exiting Word. Signing 
out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can access SkyDrive 
files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following steps sign out of a 
Microsoft account from Word. For a detailed example of the procedure summarized 
below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
	1	
If you wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open 
the Backstage view and then tap or click the Account tab to display the Account gallery.
	2	
Tap or click the Sign out link, which displays the Remove Account dialog box. If a Can’t 
remove Windows accounts dialog box appears instead of the Remove Account dialog 
box, tap or click the OK button and skip the remaining steps.
Why does a Can’t remove Windows accounts dialog box appear? 
If you signed in to Windows using your Microsoft account, then you also must sign out 
from Windows, rather than signing out from within the Word. When you are finished 
using Windows, be sure to sign out at that time. 
	3	
Tap or click the Yes button (Remove Account dialog box) to sign out of your Microsoft 
account on this computer.
Should I sign out of Windows after signing out of my Microsoft account? 
When you are finished using the computer, you should sign out of your account for 
maximum security.

Q&A
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. To resume at a later time, continue following the steps from 
this location forward.
Correcting Errors and Revising a Document
After creating a document, you may need to change it. For example, the document may 
contain an error, or new circumstances may require you to add text to the document.
Types of Changes Made to Documents
The types of changes made to documents normally fall into one of the three 
following categories: additions, deletions, or modifications.
Additions Additional words, sentences, or paragraphs may be required in a 
document. Additions occur when you omit text from a document and want to insert 
it later. For example, you may want to add your email address to the flyer.
Deletions Sometimes, text in a document is incorrect or no longer is needed. For 
example, you may discover that the tours no longer provide gear. In this case, you would 
delete the words, and gear, from the flyer.
Modifications If an error is made in a document or changes take place that affect the 
document, you might have to revise a word(s) in the text. For example, the tours may 
start in April instead of March.
To Run Word
Once you have created and saved a document, you may need to retrieve it from 
your storage medium. For example, you might want to revise the document or print 
it. The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the Search box to run Word based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Word on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter.

Word inserts text to the left of the insertion point. The text to the right of the insertion point moves to the 
right and downward to fit the new text. The following steps insert the word, today, to the left of the word, with, 
in the flyer. Why? These steps illustrate the process of inserting text.
1
•	Scroll through the 
document and then 
tap or click to the 
left of the location 
of text to be inserted 
(in this case, the w 
in with) to position 
the insertion 
point where text 
should be inserted 
(Figure 1 – 64).

To Move Text

An efficient way to move text a short distance is drag-and-drop editing. With drag-and-drop editing, 
you select the item to be moved, drag the selected item to the new location, and then drop, or insert, it in the 
new location. Another technique for moving text is the cut-and-paste technique, which is discussed in the next 
chapter. 
The following steps use drag-and-drop editing to move text. Why? While proofreading the flyer, you realize 
that the body copy would read better if the last two bulleted paragraphs were reversed.
Other Ways
1.	 Press and hold or right-click selected item, tap 
Cut on mini toolbar or click Cut on shortcut menu
2.	 Select item, press backspace to delete to left of insertion 
point or press delete to delete to right of insertion point
3.	 Select item, press 
ctrl+x
1
•	If you are using a mouse, position 
the pointer in the paragraph to 
be moved (in this case, the last 
bulleted item) and then triple-
click to select the paragraph.
•	If you are using a mouse, with the 
pointer in the selected text, press 
and hold down the mouse button, 
which displays a small dotted box 
with the pointer (Figure 1 – 67).
2
•	If you are using a mouse, drag 
the insertion point to the location 
where the selected text is to be 
moved, as shown in Figure 1 – 68.

Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Printing or Reading a Document
After creating a document, you may want to print it or read it on-screen. Printing a 
document enables you to distribute it to others in a form that can be read or viewed 
but typically not edited. It is a good practice to save a document before printing it, in 
the event you experience difficulties printing. Some users prefer reading a document 
on-screen instead of on paper.
Paste Options

appears when you 
drag and drop

What if I am using a touch screen? 
If you have a stylus, you can follow Steps 1 through 3 using the stylus. If you are using your finger, you will need 
to use the cut-and-paste technique: tap to position the insertion point in the text to be moved and then drag the 
selection handles as necessary to select the text that you want to move; tap the selection to display the mini toolbar 
and then tap the Cut button on the mini toolbar to remove the text; tap to position the insertion point at the 
location where you want to move the text; display the HOME tab and then tap the Paste button on the HOME tab 
to place the text at the location of the insertion point. The next chapter discusses this procedure in more depth.

•	Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to 
open the Backstage view.
•	Tap or click the Print tab in the 
Backstage view to display the 
Print gallery (Figure 1 – 70).
How can I print multiple copies of 
my document? 
Increase the number in the Copies 
box in the Print gallery. 
What if I decide not to print  
the document at this time? 
Tap or click the Back button in the 
upper-left corner of the Backstage 
view to return to the document 
window.

•	Verify that the printer listed on 
the Printer Status button will  
print a hard copy of the  
document. If necessary, click the 
Printer Status button to display a list 
of available printer options and then 
click the desired printer to change 
the currently selected printer.
Q&A
What is the best method for distributing a document?
The traditional method of distributing a document uses a printer to produce a hard copy. A hard copy or printout is information 
that exists on a physical medium such as paper. Hard copies can be useful for the following reasons:
•	Some people prefer proofreading a hard copy of a document rather than viewing it on the screen to check for errors and 
readability.
•	Hard copies can serve as a backup reference if your storage medium is lost or becomes corrupted and you need to recreate 
the document. 
Instead of distributing a hard copy of a document, users can distribute the document as an electronic image that mirrors 
the original document’s appearance. The electronic image of the document can be sent as an email attachment, posted on a 
website, or copied to a portable storage medium such as a USB flash drive. Two popular electronic image formats, sometimes 
called fixed formats, are PDF by Adobe Systems and XPS by Microsoft. In Word, you can create electronic image files through 
the Save As dialog box and the Export, Share, and Print tabs in the Backstage view. Electronic images of documents, such as 
PDF and XPS, can be useful for the following reasons:
•	Users can view electronic images of documents without the software that created the original document (e.g., Word). 
­Specifically, to view a PDF file, you use a program called Adobe Reader, which can be downloaded free from Adobe’s website. 
Similarly, to view an XPS file, you use a program called XPS Viewer, which is included in the latest versions of Windows and 
Internet Explorer.
•	Sending electronic documents saves paper and printer supplies. Society encourages users to contribute to green computing, 
which involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste generated when using computers, mobile devices, 
and related technologies.

Introduction
In both academic and business environments, you will be asked to write reports. 
Business reports range from proposals to cost justifications to five-year plans to 
research findings. Academic reports focus mostly on research findings.
A research paper is a document you can use to communicate the results of 
research findings. To write a research paper, you learn about a particular topic from a 
variety of sources (research), organize your ideas from the research results, and then 
present relevant facts and/or opinions that support the topic. Your final research paper 
combines properly credited outside information along with personal insights. Thus, 
no two research papers — even if they are about the same topic — will or should be 
the same.
Project — Research Paper
When preparing a research paper, you should follow a standard documentation 
style that defines the rules for creating the paper and crediting sources. A variety of 
documentation styles exists, depending on the nature of the research paper. Each style 
requires the same basic information; the differences in styles relate to requirements 
for presenting the information. For example, one documentation style uses the 
term bibliography for the list of sources, whereas another uses references, and yet 
a third prefers the title works cited. Two popular documentation styles for research 
papers are the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) and American 
Psychological Association (APA) styles. This chapter uses the MLA documentation 
style because it is used in a wide range of disciplines.
The project in this chapter follows research paper guidelines and uses Word 
to create the short research paper shown in Figure 2 – 1. This paper, which discusses 
biometric devices, follows the MLA documentation style. Each page contains a page 
number. The first two pages present the name and course information (student name, 
instructor name, course name, and paper due date), paper title, an introduction with 
a thesis statement, details that support the thesis, and a conclusion. This section of 
the paper also includes references to research sources and a footnote. The third page 
contains a detailed, alphabetical list of the sources referenced in the research paper. 
All pages include a header at the upper-right edge of the page.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the research paper shown in 
Figure 2 – 1 on the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities 
you will perform as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 change the document settings. 
2.	 create the header for each page of the research paper. 
3.	 type the research paper text with citations.
4.	 create an alphabetical works cited page.
5.	 proofread and revise the research paper.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 2 CREATE HEADER activity.
1 change document settings | 2 create header | 3 type research paper with citations
4 create alphabetical works cited | 5 proofread & revise research paper
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter. 
MLA Documentation Style
The research paper in this project follows the guidelines presented by the MLA. 
To follow the MLA documentation style, use a 12-point Times New Roman or similar 
font. Double-space text on all pages of the paper using one-inch top, bottom, left, 
and right margins. Indent the first word of each paragraph one-half inch from the left 
margin. At the right margin of each page, place a page number one-half inch from the 
top margin. On each page, precede the page number with your last name.
The MLA documentation style does not require a title page. Instead, place your 
name and course information in a block at the left margin beginning one inch from the 
top of the page. Center the title one double-spaced line below your name and course 
information.
In the text of the paper, place author references in parentheses with the page 
number(s) of the referenced information. The MLA documentation style uses in-text 
parenthetical references instead of noting each source at the bottom of the page 
or at the end of the paper. In the MLA documentation style, notes are used only for 
optional content or bibliographic notes.
If used, content notes elaborate on points discussed in the paper, and 
bibliographic notes direct the reader to evaluations of statements in a source or provide 
a means for identifying multiple sources. Use a superscript (raised number) both to 
signal that a note exists and to sequence the notes (shown in Figure 2 – 1). Position 
notes at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the end of the paper as endnotes. 
Indent the first line of each note one-half inch from the left margin. Place one space 
following the superscripted number before beginning the note text. Double-space the 
note text (shown in Figure 2 – 1). 
The MLA documentation style uses the term, works cited, to refer to 
the bibliographic list of sources at the end of the paper. The works cited page

APA Documentation 
Style
In the APA style, a separate 
title page is required instead 
of placing name and course 
information on the paper’s 
first page. Double-space 
all pages of the paper with 
one-inch top, bottom, left, 
and right margins. Indent the 
first word of each paragraph 
one-half inch from the 
left margin. In the upper-
right margin of each page, 
including the title page, 
place a running head that 
consists of the page number 
preceded by a brief summary 
of the paper title.

alphabetically lists sources that are referenced directly in the paper. Place the list of 
sources on a separate numbered page. Center the title, Works Cited, one inch from 
the top margin. Double-space all lines. Begin the first line of each source at the left 
margin, indenting subsequent lines of the same source one-half inch from the left 
margin. List each source by the author’s last name, or, if the author’s name is not 
available, by the title of the source. 
Changing Document Settings
The MLA documentation style defines some global formats that apply to the entire 
research paper. Some of these formats are the default in Word. For example, the 
default left, right, top, and bottom margin settings in Word are one inch, which meets 
the MLA documentation style. You will modify, however, the font, font size, and line 
and paragraph spacing.
To Run Word and Create a Blank Document
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the Search box to run Word based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Word on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter. 
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for a Word 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains a Word 2013 
tile, tap or click it to run Word and then proceed to Step 5; if the Start screen does not 
contain the Word 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search for the Word app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of the 
screen to display the Charms bar and then tap or click the Search charm on the Charms 
bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   Word   as the search text in the Search box and watch the search results appear 
in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click Word 2013 in the search results to run Word.
	5	
Tap or click the Blank document thumbnail on the Word start screen to create a blank 
document and display it in the Word window.

To Display Formatting Marks
As discussed in Chapter 1, it is helpful to display formatting marks that indicate 
where in the document you press the enter key, spacebar, and other keys. The 
following steps display formatting marks.
	1	
If the HOME tab is not the active tab, tap or click HOME on the ribbon to display the 
HOME tab.
	2	
If the ‘Show/Hide ¶’ button (HOME tab | Paragraph group) is not selected already, 
tap or click it to display formatting marks on the screen.
Styles
When you create a document, Word formats the text using a particular style. 
A style is a named group of formatting characteristics, including font and font size. 
The default style in Word is called the Normal style, which most likely uses an 
11-point Calibri font. If you do not specify a style for text you type, Word applies 
the Normal style to the text. In addition to the Normal style, Word has many other 
built-in, or predefined, styles that you can use to format text. Styles make it easy to 
apply many formats at once to text. You can modify existing styles and create your 
own styles. Styles are discussed as they are used in this book.
To Modify a Style
The MLA documentation style requires that all text in the research paper use a 12-point Times New 
Roman or similar font. If you change the font and font size using buttons on the ribbon, you will need to make 
the change many times during the course of creating the paper. Why? Word formats various areas of a document 
based on the Normal style, which uses an 11-point Calibri font. For example, body text, headers, and bibliographies all 
display text based on the Normal style. 
Thus, instead of changing the font and font size for various document elements, a more efficient technique 
is to change the Normal style for this document to use a 12-point Times New Roman font. Why? By changing 
the Normal style, you ensure that all text in the document will use the format required by the MLA. The following steps 
change the Normal style.

Adjusting Line and Paragraph Spacing
Line spacing is the amount of vertical space between lines of text in a paragraph. 
Paragraph spacing is the amount of space above and below a paragraph. By default, 
the Normal style places 8 points of blank space after each paragraph and inserts a 
vertical space equal to 1.08 lines between each line of text. It also automatically adjusts 
line height to accommodate various font sizes and graphics.
The MLA documentation style requires that you double-space the entire 
research paper. That is, the amount of vertical space between each line of text and 
above and below paragraphs should be equal to one blank line. The next sets of steps 
adjust line spacing and paragraph spacing according to the MLA documentation style. 
To Change Line Spacing
The following steps change the line spacing to 2.0 to double-space lines in a paragraph. Why? The lines of 
the research paper should be double-spaced, according to the MLA documentation style.

•	Tap or click the 
‘Line and Paragraph 
Spacing’ button 
(HOME tab | 
Paragraph group) to 
display the Line and 
Paragraph Spacing 
gallery (Figure 2 – 5).
What do the 
numbers in the 
Line and Paragraph 
Spacing gallery 
represent?
The options 1.0, 
2.0, and 3.0 set 
line spacing to 
single, double, and 
triple, respectively. 
Similarly, the 1.15, 
1.5, and 2.5 options 
set line spacing to 
1.15, 1.5, and 2.5 lines. All of these options adjust line spacing  
automatically to accommodate the largest font or graphic on a line.
2
•	Tap or click 2.0 in the Line and Paragraph Spacing gallery to change the line spacing at  
the location of the insertion point.
Can I change the line spacing of existing text?
Yes. Select the text first and then change the line spacing as described in these steps.

To Switch to the Header
The following steps switch from editing the document text to editing the header. Why? To enter text in the 
header, you instruct Word to edit the header.
1
•	Tap or click INSERT 
on the ribbon to 
display the INSERT 
tab.
•	Tap or click the ‘Add 
a Header’ button 
(INSERT tab | Header &  
Footer group) to 
display the Add

•	Tap or click the 
down scroll arrow 
in the Add a Header 
gallery to see the 
available built-in 
headers. 
Can I use a built-in 
header for this 
research paper?
None of the built-in 
headers adheres to the 
MLA documentation style. Thus, you enter your own header content  
instead of using a built-in header for this research paper.
How would I remove a header from a document?
You would tap or click Remove Header in the Add a Header gallery. Similarly,  
to remove a footer, you would tap or click Remove Footer in the Add a Footer gallery.
Q&A
Creating a Header
A header is text and/or graphics that print at the top of each page in a document. 
Similarly, a footer is text and/or graphics that print at the bottom of every page. In 
Word, headers print in the top margin one-half inch from the top of every page, and 
footers print in the bottom margin one-half inch from the bottom of each page, which 
meets the MLA documentation style. In addition to text and graphics, headers and 
footers can include document information such as the page number, current date,

WD 78   Word Chapter 2   Creating a Research Paper with References and Sources
Typing the Research Paper Text
The text of the research paper in this chapter encompasses the first two pages of 
the paper. You will type the text of the research paper and then modify it later in the 
chapter, so that it matches Figure 2 – 1 on page WD 67.
What should you consider when writing the first draft of a research paper?
As you write the first draft of a research paper, be sure it includes the proper components, uses credible sources, and does not 
contain any plagiarized material. 
•	Include an introduction, body, and conclusion. The first paragraph of the paper introduces the topic and captures 
the reader’s attention. The body, which follows the introduction, consists of several paragraphs that support the topic. The 
conclusion summarizes the main points in the body and restates the topic.
•	Evaluate sources for authority, currency, and accuracy. Be especially wary of information obtained on the web. 
Any person, company, or organization can publish a webpage on the Internet. Ask yourself these questions about the source:
•	Authority: Does a reputable institution or group support the source? Is the information presented without bias? Are the 
author’s credentials listed and verifiable?
•	Currency: Is the information up to date? Are dates of sources listed? What is the last date revised or updated?
•	Accuracy: Is the information free of errors? Is it verifiable? Are the sources clearly identified?
•	Acknowledge all sources of information; do not plagiarize. Sources of research include books, magazines, 
newspapers, and the Internet. As you record facts and ideas, list details about the source: title, author, place of publication, 
publisher, date of publication, etc. When taking notes, be careful not to plagiarize. That is, do not use someone else’s work 
and claim it to be your own. If you copy information directly, place it in quotation marks and identify its source. Not only is 
plagiarism unethical, but it is considered an academic crime that can have severe punishments such as failing a course or 
­being expelled from school.
When you summarize, paraphrase (rewrite information in your own words), present facts, give statistics, quote exact words, 
or show a map, chart, or other graphic, you must acknowledge the source. Information that commonly is known or accessible 
to the audience constitutes common knowledge and does not need to be acknowledged. If, however, you question whether 
certain information is common knowledge, you should document it — just to be safe.
CONSIDER THIS
To Enter Name and Course Information
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the MLA documentation style does not 
require a separate title page for research papers. Instead, place your name and course 
information in a block at the top of the page, below the header, at the left margin. The 
following steps enter the name and course information in the research paper.
	1	
Type   Teddy Bailey   as the student name and then press the enter key.
	2	
Type   Ms. Pedro   as the instructor name and then press the enter key.
	3	
Type   English 101   as the course name and then press the enter key.
	4	
Type  October 15, 2014   as the paper’s due date and then press the enter key 
(Figure 2 – 14).
If requested by your instructor, enter your name and course information instead of the 
information shown above.
Why did the word, October, appear on the screen as I began typing the month name?
Word has an AutoComplete feature, where it predicts some words or phrases as you 
are typing and displays its prediction in a ScreenTip. If the AutoComplete prediction 
is correct, you can tap the ScreenTip or press the enter key to instruct Word to finish 
your typing with the word or phrase that appears in the ScreenTip.
Q&A
BTW
Date Formats
The MLA style prefers the 
day-month-year (15 October 
2014) or month-day-year 
(October 15, 2014) format.

To Click and Type
The next task is to enter the title of the research paper centered between the page margins. In Chapter 1, 
you used the Center button (HOME tab | Paragraph group) to center text and graphics. As an alternative, if you 
are using a mouse, you can use Word’s Click and Type feature to format and enter text, graphics, and other items. 
Why? With Click and Type, you can double-click a blank area of the document window and Word automatically formats 
the item you type or insert according to the location where you double-clicked. If you are using a mouse, the following 
steps use Click and Type to center and then type the title of the research paper. If you are using a touch screen, 
you will use a different method.

•	If you are using a touch screen, 
tap the Center button (HOME 
tab | Paragraph group) and then 
proceed to Step 3 because the 
Click and Type feature does not 
work with a touch screen. 
 Experiment
•	If you are using a mouse, move 
the pointer around the document 
below the entered name and 
course information and observe 
the various icons that appear with 
the I-beam.
•	If you are using a mouse, position 
the pointer in the center of the 
document at the approximate 
location for the research paper 
title until a center icon appears 
below the I-beam (Figure 2 – 15).
What are the other icons that 
appear in the Click and Type pointer?
A left-align icon appears to the right of the I-beam when the Click and Type pointer is in 
certain locations on the left side of the document window. A right-align icon appears to 
the left of the I-beam when the Click and Type pointer is in certain locations on the right 
side of the document window.

To Format Text Using a Keyboard Shortcut
The paragraphs below the paper title should be left-aligned, instead of centered. 
Thus, the next step is to left-align the paragraph below the paper title. When your 
fingers are already on the keyboard, you may prefer using keyboard shortcuts to format 
text as you type it. 
The following step left-aligns a paragraph using the keyboard shortcut ctrl+l. 
(Recall from Chapter 1 that a notation such as ctrl+l means to press the letter L on 
the keyboard while holding down the ctrl key.)
	1	
Press ctrl+l to left-align the current paragraph, that is, the paragraph containing the 
insertion point (shown in Figure 2 – 17 on the next page).
Why would I use a keyboard shortcut instead of the ribbon to format text?
Switching between the mouse and the keyboard takes time. If your hands are already 
on the keyboard, use a keyboard shortcut. If your hand is on the mouse, use the ribbon.
To Save a Document
You have performed many tasks while creating this research paper and do 
not want to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the 
document. The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing 
your files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains a Word folder 
(for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the document in the Word folder in the 
CIS 101 folder using the file name, Biometric Devices Paper.

Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, which depending on 
settings, will display either the Save As gallery in the Backstage view or the Save As 
dialog box.
	2	
To save on a hard disk or other storage media on your computer, proceed to Step 2a. 
To save on SkyDrive, proceed to Step 2b. 
	 2a	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on storage media on 
your computer, tap or click Computer in the left pane, if necessary, to display options 
in the right pane related to saving on your computer. If your screen already displays 
the Save As dialog box, proceed to Step 4.
	 2b	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on SkyDrive, tap or click 
SkyDrive in the left pane to display SkyDrive saving options or a Sign In button. If your 
screen displays a Sign In button, tap or click it and then sign in to SkyDrive.
	3	
Tap or click the Browse button in the right pane to display the Save As dialog box 
associated with the selected save location (i.e., Computer or SkyDrive).
	4	
Type   Biometric Devices Paper   in the File name box to change the file name. 
Do not press the enter key after typing the file name because you do not want to 
close the dialog box at this time.
	5	
Navigate to the desired save location (in this case, the Word folder in the CIS 101 folder 
[or your class folder] on your computer or SkyDrive).
	6	
Tap or click the Save button (Save As dialog box) to save the research paper in the 
selected folder on the selected save location with the entered file name.

Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called 
CIS 101, a good practice 
would be to save all Word 
files in a Word folder in 
a CIS 101 folder. For a 
discussion of folders and 
detailed examples of creating 
folders, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

To Display the Rulers
According to the MLA documentation style, the first line of each paragraph in the research paper is 
to be indented one-half inch from the left margin. Although you can use a dialog box to indent paragraphs, 
Word provides a quicker way through the horizontal ruler. This ruler is displayed at the top edge of the 
document window just below the ribbon. Word also provides a vertical ruler that is displayed along the left 
edge of the Word window. The following step displays the rulers. Why? You want to use the horizontal ruler to 
indent paragraphs. 
1
•	If necessary, scroll the document so that the research paper title is at the top of the document window.
•	Tap or click VIEW on the ribbon to display the VIEW tab.
•	If the rulers are not displayed, tap or click the View Ruler check box (VIEW tab | Show group) to place a check mark 
in the check box and display the horizontal and vertical rulers on the screen (Figure 2 – 17).
What tasks can I accomplish using the rulers?
You can use the rulers to indent paragraphs, set tab stops, change page margins, and adjust column widths.
Q&A
Figure 2 – 17
To First-Line Indent Paragraphs
If you are using a mouse, you can use the horizontal ruler, usually simply called the ruler, to indent just the 
first line of a paragraph, which is called a first-line indent. The left margin on the ruler contains two triangles 
above a square. The ‘First Line Indent’ marker is the top triangle at the 0" mark on the ruler (Figure 2 – 18). 
The bottom triangle is discussed later in this chapter. The small square at the 0" mark is the Left Indent marker. 
The Left Indent marker allows you to change the entire left margin, whereas the ‘First Line Indent’ marker 
indents only the first line of the paragraph. 
The next steps first-line indent paragraphs in the research paper. Why? The first line of each paragraph in the 
research paper is to be indented one-half inch from the left margin, according to the MLA documentation style.

Will I have to set a

To AutoCorrect as You Type
Word has predefined many commonly misspelled words, which it automatically corrects for you. Why? 
As you type, you may make typing, spelling, capitalization, or grammar errors. Word’s AutoCorrect feature automatically 
corrects these kinds of errors as you type them in the document. For example, if you type ahve, Word automatically changes it 
to the correct spelling, have, when you press the spacebar or a punctuation mark key such as a period or comma.
The following steps intentionally misspell the word, that, as taht to illustrate the AutoCorrect feature.

•	Tap or click the OK button (AutoCorrect dialog box) to close the dialog box.
•	Tap or click the OK button (Word Options dialog box) to close the dialog box.
The AutoCorrect Dialog Box
In addition to creating AutoCorrect entries for words you commonly misspell or 
mistype, you can create entries for abbreviations, codes, and so on. For example, you 
could create an AutoCorrect entry for asap, indicating that Word should replace this 
text with the phrase, as soon as possible.
If, for some reason, you do not want Word to correct automatically as you 
type, you can turn off the Replace text as you type feature by tapping or clicking 
Options in the Backstage view, tapping or clicking Proofing in the left pane 
(Word Options dialog box), tapping or clicking the AutoCorrect Options button 
in the right pane (Figure 2 – 27), removing the check mark from the ‘Replace text 
as you type’ check box, and then tapping or clicking the OK button in each open 
dialog box.
The AutoCorrect sheet in the AutoCorrect dialog box (Figure 2 – 27) contains 
other check boxes that correct capitalization errors if the check boxes are selected:
•	If you type two capital letters in a row, such as TH, Word makes the second letter 
lowercase, Th. 
•	If you begin a sentence with a lowercase letter, Word capitalizes the first letter of 
the sentence. 
•	If you type the name of a day in lowercase letters, such as tuesday, Word 
capitalizes the first letter in the name of the day, Tuesday. 
•	If you leave the caps lock key on and begin a new sentence, such as after, 
Word corrects the typing, After, and turns off the caps lock key. 
If you do not want Word to automatically perform any of these corrections, simply 
remove the check mark from the appropriate check box in the AutoCorrect dialog box.
Sometimes you do not want Word to AutoCorrect a particular word or 
phrase. For example, you may use the code WD. in your documents. Because Word 
automatically capitalizes the first letter of a sentence, the character you enter following 
the period will be capitalized (in the previous sentence, it would capitalize the letter i 
in the word, in). To allow the code WD. to be entered into a document and still leave 
the AutoCorrect feature turned on, you would set an exception. To set an exception to 
an AutoCorrect rule, tap or click Options in the Backstage view, tap or click Proofing 
in the left pane (Word Options dialog box), tap or click the AutoCorrect Options 
button in the right pane, tap or click the Exceptions button (Figure 2 – 27), tap or click 
the appropriate tab in the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box, type the exception entry 
in the text box, tap or click the Add button, tap or click the Close button (AutoCorrect 
Exceptions dialog box), and then tap or click the OK button in each of the remaining 
dialog boxes.

To Enter More Text
The next task is to continue typing text in the research paper up to the location 
of the in-text parenthetical reference. The following steps enter this text.
	1	
With the insertion point positioned at the end of the first paragraph in the paper, as 
shown in Figure 2 – 25 on page WD 85, press the spacebar and then type these two 
sentences, intentionally misspelling the word readers as raders:   If the digital 
code in the computer matches the personal characteristic code, 
the computer grants access. Examples of biometric devices 
include fingerprint raders and face recognition systems.
Why is the word, readers, misspelled?
Later in this chapter, you will use Word’s check spelling and grammar at once feature 
to check the entire document for errors.

Press the enter key to start a new paragraph.

Type   A fingerprint reader, or scanner, captures curves and 
indentations of a fingerprint. Organizations use fingerprint 
readers to secure doors, computers, and software. For example, 
a fingerprint reader can be set up to authenticate users before 
they can access a computer   and then press the spacebar (Figure 2 – 28).
Q&A
Citations
Both the MLA and APA guidelines suggest the use of in-text parenthetical 
references (placed at the end of a sentence), instead of footnoting each source of 
material in a paper. These parenthetical references, called citations in Word, guide the 
reader to the end of the paper for complete information about the source.
Word provides tools to assist you with inserting citations in a paper and later 
generating a list of sources from the citations. With a documentation style selected, 
Word automatically formats the citations and list of sources according to that style. 
The process for adding citations in Word is as follows:
1.	 Modify the documentation style, if necessary.
2.	 Insert a citation placeholder.
3.	 Enter the source information for the citation.
You can combine Steps 2 and 3, where you insert the citation placeholder and 
enter the source information at once. Or, you can insert the citation placeholder as 
you write and then enter the source information for the citation at a later time. While 
creating the research paper in this chapter, you will use both methods.

Spacing after 
Punctuation
Because word processing 
documents use variable 
character fonts, it often is 
difficult to determine in a 
printed document how many 
times someone has pressed 
the spacebar between 
sentences. Thus, the rule is to 
press the spacebar only once 
after periods, colons, and 
other punctuation marks.

Why is the month abbreviated?
The MLA documentation style abbreviates all months, except May, June, and July, when they appear in a source.
What does the n. pag. entry mean in the Pages text box?
The MLA documentation style uses the abbreviation n. pag. for no pagination, which indicates the source has no 
page references. This is common for web sources.

To Save an Existing Document with the Same File Name
You have made several modifications to the document since you last saved it. 
Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the document again. For 
an example of the step listed below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Footnotes
As discussed earlier in this chapter, notes are optional in the MLA documentation 
style. If used, content notes elaborate on points discussed in the paper, and bibliographic 
notes direct the reader to evaluations of statements in a source or provide a means for 
identifying multiple sources. The MLA documentation style specifies that a superscript 
(raised number) be used for a note reference mark to signal that a note exists either at 
the bottom of the page as a footnote or at the end of the document as an endnote.
In Word, note text can be any length and format. Word automatically numbers 
notes sequentially by placing a note reference mark both in the body of the document and 
to the left of the note text. If you insert, rearrange, or remove notes, Word renumbers any 
subsequent note reference marks according to their new sequence in the document.
To Insert a Footnote Reference Mark
The following step inserts a footnote reference mark in the document at the location of the insertion 
point and at the location where the footnote text will be typed. Why? You will insert a content note elaborating on 
fingerprint reader functions, which you want to position as a footnote.
1
•	With the insertion point 
positioned as shown in 
Figure 2 – 35 on the previous 
page, tap or click the Insert 
Footnote button (REFERENCES  
tab | Footnotes group) to 
display a note reference mark 
(a superscripted 1) in two places: 
(1) in the document window at 
the location of the insertion point 
and (2) at the bottom of the 
page where the footnote will be 
positioned, just below a separator 
line (Figure 2 – 36). 
What if I wanted notes to be 
positioned as endnotes instead of 
as footnotes?
You would tap or click the Insert 
Endnote button (REFERENCES tab | Footnotes group), which places the separator line and the endnote  
text at the end of the document, instead of the bottom of the page containing the reference.

To Insert a Citation Placeholder
Earlier in this chapter, you inserted a citation and its source at once. In Word, you also can insert a citation 
without entering the source information. Why? Sometimes, you may not have the source information readily available 
and would prefer to enter it at a later time. 
The following steps insert a citation placeholder in the footnote, so that you can enter the source 
information later.

What is a tag name?
A tag name is an 
identifier that links 
a citation to a source. Word automatically creates a tag name when you enter a source. 
When you create a citation placeholder, enter a meaningful tag name, which will appear

which does not adhere to the MLA documentation style. For example, notice in 
Figure 2 – 37 on the previous page that the footnote text is single-spaced, left-aligned, 
and a smaller font size than the text in the research paper. According to the MLA 
documentation style, notes should be formatted like all other paragraphs in the paper.
You could change the paragraph formatting of the footnote text to first-line 
indent and double-spacing and then change the font size from 10 to 12 point. If you 
use this technique, however, you will need to change the format of the footnote text for 
each footnote you enter into the document.
A more efficient technique is to modify the format of the Footnote Text style so 
that every footnote you enter in the document will use the formats defined in this style. 
To Modify a Style Using  
a Shortcut Menu
The Footnote Text style specifies left-aligned single-spaced paragraphs with a 10-point font size for text. 
The following steps modify the Footnote Text style. Why? To meet MLA documentation style, the footnotes should be 
double-spaced with a first line indent and a 12-point font size for text. 
1
•	If you are using a touch screen, 
press and hold the note text in the 
footnote and then tap the ‘Show 
Context Menu’ button on the 
mini toolbar; if you are using a 
mouse, right-click the note text in 
the footnote to display a shortcut 
menu related to footnotes 
(Figure 2 – 39).

To Edit a Citation
In the MLA documentation style, if a source has page numbers, you should include them in the citation. 
Thus, Word provides a means to enter the page numbers to be displayed in the citation. Also, if you reference 
the author’s name in the text, you should not list it again in the parenthetical citation. Instead, just list the page 
number(s) in the citation. To do this, you instruct Word to suppress author and title. Why? If you suppress the 
author, Word automatically displays the title, so you need to suppress both the author and title if you want just the page 
number(s) to be displayed. The following steps edit the citation, suppressing the author and title but displaying the 
page numbers.

•	If necessary, tap or click 
somewhere in the citation to be 
edited, in this case somewhere in

Working with Footnotes and Endnotes
You edit footnote text just as you edit any other text in the document. To delete or 
move a note reference mark, however, the insertion point must be in the document text 
(not in the footnote text). 
To delete a note, select the note reference mark in the document text (not in the 
footnote text) by dragging through the note reference mark and then tap or click the Cut 
button (HOME tab | Clipboard group). Or, tap or click immediately to the right of the 
note reference mark in the document text and then press the backspace key twice, or tap 
or click immediately to the left of the note reference mark in the document text and then 
press the delete key twice.
To move a note to a different location in a document, select the note reference 
mark in the document text (not in the footnote text), tap or click the Cut button (HOME 
tab | Clipboard group), tap or click the location where you want to move the note, and 
then tap or click the Paste button (HOME tab | Clipboard group). When you move or 
delete notes, Word automatically renumbers any remaining notes in the correct sequence.
If you are using a mouse and position the pointer on the note reference mark in the 
document text, the note text is displayed above the note reference mark as a ScreenTip. 
To remove the ScreenTip, move the pointer.
If, for some reason, you wanted to change the format of note reference marks 
in footnotes or endnotes (i.e., from 1, 2, 3, to A, B, C), you would tap or click the 
Footnote & Endnote Dialog Box Launcher (REFERENCES tab | Footnotes group) 
to display the Footnote and Endnote dialog box, tap or click the Number format arrow 
(Footnote and Endnote dialog box), tap or click the desired number format in the list,

To Enter More Text
The next task is to continue typing text in the body of the research paper. The 
following steps enter this text.
	1	
Position the insertion point after the note reference mark in the document and then 
press the enter key.
	2	
Type the first three sentences in the third paragraph of the research paper (shown 
in Figure 2 – 50):   A face recognition system captures a live face 
image and compares it with a stored image to determine 
if the person is a legitimate user. Some buildings use 
face recognition systems to secure access to rooms. Law 
enforcement, surveillance systems, and airports use face 
recognition systems to protect the public.
To Count Words
Often when you write papers, you are required to compose the papers with a minimum number of words. 
The minimum requirement for the research paper in this chapter is 275 words. You can look on the status bar 
and see the total number of words thus far in a document. For example, Figure 2 – 50 shows the research paper 
has 214 words, but you are not sure if that count includes the words in your footnote. The following steps 
display the Word Count dialog box. Why? You want to verify that the footnote text is included in the count.

•	Tap or click the Word Count indicator on the status bar to display the Word Count dialog box.
•	If necessary, place a check mark in the ‘Include textboxes, footnotes and endnotes’ check box (Word Count dialog 
box) (Figure 2 – 50).
Why do the statistics in my Word Count dialog box differ from those in Figure 2 – 50?
Depending on the accuracy of your typing, your statistics may differ.

Q&A
Automatic Page Breaks
As you type documents that exceed one page, Word automatically inserts page 
breaks, called automatic page breaks or soft page breaks, when it determines the 
text has filled one page according to paper size, margin settings, line spacing, and other 
settings. If you add text, delete text, or modify text on a page, Word recalculates the 
location of automatic page breaks and adjusts them accordingly.
Word performs page recalculation between the keystrokes, that is, in between 
the pauses in your typing. Thus, Word refers to the automatic page break task as 
background repagination. An automatic page break will occur in the next set 
of steps.
To Enter More Text and Insert a Citation Placeholder
The next task is to type the remainder of the third paragraph in the body of the 
research paper. The following steps enter this text and a citation placeholder at the end 
of the paragraph.
	1	
With the insertion point positioned at the end of the third sentence in the third 
paragraph, as shown in Figure 2 – 50, press the spacebar.
	2	
Type the rest of the third paragraph:   Some mobile devices use face 
recognition systems to unlock the device. Face recognition 
systems are becoming more sophisticated and can recognize 
people with or without glasses, hats, facial hair, makeup, 
or jewelry, and with new hairstyles   and then press the spacebar.
Why does the text move from the second page to the first page as I am typing?
Word, by default, will not allow the first line of a paragraph to be by itself at the 
bottom of a page (an orphan) or the last line of a paragraph to be by itself at the top 
of a page (a widow). As you type, Word adjusts the placement of the paragraph to 
avoid orphans and widows.
	3	
Tap or click the Insert Citation button (REFERENCES tab | Citations & Bibliography 
group) to display the Insert Citation menu. Tap or click ‘Add New Placeholder’ on the 
Insert Citation menu to display the Placeholder Name dialog box.

Type   Allensmith   as the tag name for the source.

To Hide and Show White Space
With the page break and header, it is difficult to see the entire third paragraph at once on the screen. 
With the screen in Print Layout view, you can hide white space, which is the space that is displayed at the top 
and bottom of pages (including headers and footers) and also the space between pages. The following steps hide 
white space, if your screen displays it, and then shows white space. Why? You want to see the as much of the third 
paragraph as possible at once, which spans the bottom of the first page and the top of the second page.

Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the document again. 
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Word now (refer to page WD 46 for instructions). 
To resume at a later time, run Word (refer to page WD 46 for instructions), open the file called Biometric Devices Paper (refer to page 
WD 47 for instructions), and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Creating an Alphabetical Works Cited Page
According to the MLA documentation style, the works cited page is a list of sources 
that are referenced directly in a research paper. You place the list on a separate 
numbered page with the title, Works Cited, centered one inch from the top margin. 
The works are to be alphabetized by the author’s last name or, if the work has no 
author, by the work’s title. The first line of each entry begins at the left margin. Indent 
subsequent lines of the same entry one-half inch from the left margin.

CONSIDER THIS
What is a bibliography?
A bibliography is an alphabetical list of sources referenced in a paper. Whereas the text of the research paper contains brief 
references to the source (the citations), the bibliography lists all publication information about the source. Documentation styles 
differ significantly in their guidelines for preparing a bibliography. Each style identifies formats for various sources, including 
books, magazines, pamphlets, newspapers, websites, television programs, paintings, maps, advertisements, letters, memos, and 
much more. You can find information about various styles and their guidelines in printed style guides and on the web.
To Page Break Manually
The next step is to insert a manual page break following the body of the research paper. Why? According to 
the MLA documentation style, the works cited are to be displayed on a separate numbered page. 
A manual page break, or hard page break, is one that you force into the document at a specific location. 
Word never moves or adjusts manual page breaks. Word, however, does adjust any automatic page breaks that 
follow a manual page break. Word inserts manual page breaks immediately above or to the left of the location of 
the insertion point. The following step inserts a manual page break after the text of the research paper.
1
•	Verify that the insertion point is 
positioned at the end of the text 
of the research paper, as shown in 
Figure 2 – 54.
•	Tap or click INSERT on the ribbon 
to display the INSERT tab.
•	Tap or click the ‘Insert a Page 
Break’ button (INSERT tab | Pages 
group) to insert a manual page 
break immediately to the left of 
the insertion point and position 
the insertion point immediately 
below the manual page break 
(Figure 2 – 55).

To Apply a Style
The works cited title is to be centered between the margins of the paper. If you simply issue the Center 
command, the title will not be centered properly. Why? It will be to the right of the center point because earlier you set 
the first-line indent for paragraphs to one-half inch. 
To properly center the title of the works cited page, you could drag the ‘First Line Indent’ marker back 
to the left margin before centering the paragraph, or you could apply the Normal style to the location of the 
insertion point. Recall that you modified the Normal style for this document to 12-point Times New Roman 
with double-spaced, left-aligned paragraphs that have no space after the paragraphs. 
To apply a style to a paragraph, first position the insertion point in the paragraph and then apply the style. 
The step on the next page applies the modified Normal style to the location of the insertion point.

To Create a Bibliographical List
While typing the research paper, you created several citations and their sources. The next task is to use 
Word to format the list of sources and alphabetize them in a bibliographical list. Why? Word can create a 
bibliographical list with each element of the source placed in its correct position with proper punctuation, according to the 
specified style, saving you time looking up style guidelines. For example, in this research paper, the book source will list, in 
this order, the author name(s), book title, publisher city, publishing company name, and publication year with the correct 
punctuation between each element according to the MLA documentation style. The next steps create an MLA-styled 
bibliographical list from the sources previously entered.

To Format Paragraphs with a Hanging Indent
Notice in Figure 2 – 58 on the previous page that the first line of each source 
entry begins at the left margin, and subsequent lines in the same paragraph are 
indented one-half inch from the left margin. In essence, the first line hangs to the left 
of the rest of the paragraph; thus, this type of paragraph formatting is called a hanging 
indent. The Bibliography style in Word automatically formats the works cited 
paragraphs with a hanging indent. 
If you wanted to format paragraphs with a hanging indent, you would use one of 
the following techniques.
•	 With the insertion point in the paragraph to format, drag the Hanging Indent 
marker (the bottom triangle) on the ruler to the desired mark on the ruler (i.e., .5") 
to set the hanging indent at that location from the left margin.
or
•	 Tap the ‘Show Context Menu’ button on the mini toolbar or right-click the 
paragraph to format, tap or click Paragraph on shortcut menu, tap or click the 
Indents and Spacing tab (Paragraph dialog box), tap or click the Special arrow, tap 
or click Hanging, and then tap or click the OK button.
or
•	 Tap or click the Paragraph Dialog Box Launcher (HOME tab or PAGE LAYOUT

Proofreading and Revising the Research Paper
As discussed in Chapter 1, once you complete a document, you might find it necessary 
to make changes to it. Before submitting a paper to be graded, you should proofread 
it. While proofreading, ensure all the source information is correct and look for 
grammatical errors and spelling errors. Also ensure that transitions between sentences 
flow smoothly and the sentences themselves make sense. 
To assist you with the proofreading effort, Word provides several tools. You can 
go to a page, copy text, find text, replace text, insert a synonym, check spelling and 
grammar, and look up information. The following pages discuss these tools.

What should you consider when proofreading and revising a paper?
As you proofread the paper, look for ways to improve it. Check all grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Be sure the text is 
logical and transitions are smooth. Where necessary, add text, delete text, reword text, and move text to different locations. 
Ask yourself these questions: 
•	Does the title suggest the topic? 
•	Is the thesis clear? 
•	Is the purpose of the paper clear? 
•	Does the paper have an introduction, body, and conclusion? 
•	Does each paragraph in the body relate to the thesis? 
•	Is the conclusion effective? 
•	Are sources acknowledged correctly?
•	Are all sources acknowledged?
CONSIDER THIS
To Modify a Source 
While proofreading the paper, you notice an error in the magazine title; specifically, the first word 
(Understanding) should be removed. If you modify the contents of any source, the list of sources automatically 
updates. Why? Word automatically updates the contents of fields, and the bibliography is a field. The following steps 
delete a word from the title of the magazine article.

•	Tap or click the 
Manage Sources 
button (REFERENCES

to display the

Copying, Cutting, and Pasting
While proofreading the research paper, you decide it would read better if 
the word, biometric, in the second sentence of the last paragraph also appeared 
in front of the word, devices, in the same sentence. You could type the word 
at the desired location, but because this is a difficult word to spell and type, 
you decide to use the Office Clipboard. The Office Clipboard is a temporary 
storage area that holds up to 24 items (text or graphics) copied from any Office 
program. The Office Clipboard works with the copy, cut, and paste commands:
•	Copying is the process of placing items on the Office Clipboard, leaving 
the item in the document.
•	Cutting removes the item from the document before placing it on the 
Office Clipboard.
•	Pasting is the process of copying an item from the Office Clipboard into 
the document at the location of the insertion point.
To Go to a Page
The next task in revising the paper is to modify text on the second page of the document. Why? You want 
to copy text from one location to another on the second page. You could scroll to the desired location in the document,

To Display the Paste Options Menu
When you paste an item or move an item using drag-and-drop editing, which was discussed in the previous 
chapter, Word automatically displays a Paste Options button near the pasted or moved text (Figure 2 – 65). Why? 
The Paste Options button allows you to change the format of a pasted item. For example, you can instruct Word to format 
the pasted item the same way as where it was copied (the source), or format it the same way as where it is being pasted (the 
destination). The following steps display the Paste Options menu.

•	Tap or click the Paste Options 
button to display the Paste 
Options menu (Figure 2 – 66).
What are the functions of the 
buttons on the Paste Options 
menu?
In general, the left button 
indicates the pasted item should 
look the same as it did in its 
original location (the source). 
The second button formats the pasted text to match the rest of the item where it was pasted (the destination). 
The third button removes all formatting from the pasted item. The Set Default Paste command displays the Word 
Options dialog box. Keep in mind that the buttons shown on a Paste Options menu will vary, depending on the 
item being pasted.

You decide to change all occurrences of element to identifier. Why? The text, biometric identifier, is a better 
description than biometric element. Word’s find and replace feature locates each occurrence of a word or phrase and 
then replaces it with text you specify. The following steps find and replace text.

Find and Replace Dialog Box
The Replace All button (Find and Replace dialog box) replaces all occurrences of 
the Find what text with the Replace with text. In some cases, you may want to replace 
only certain occurrences of a word or phrase, not all of them. To instruct Word to 
confirm each change, tap or click the Find Next button (Find and Replace dialog box) 
(Figure 2 – 70), instead of the Replace All button. When Word locates an occurrence 
of the text, it pauses and waits for you to tap or click either the Replace button or the 
Find Next button. Tapping or clicking the Replace button changes the text; tapping or 
clicking the Find Next button instructs Word to disregard the replacement and look 
for the next occurrence of the Find what text.
If you accidentally replace the wrong text, you can undo a replacement by 
tapping or clicking the Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you used the 
Replace All button, Word undoes all replacements. If you used the Replace button,

you used was not quite appropriate, which is the case here. In these instances, you will want to look up a synonym, or 
a word similar in meaning, to the duplicate or inappropriate word. A thesaurus is a book of synonyms. Word 
provides synonyms and a thesaurus for your convenience. The following steps find a suitable synonym.

The Main and Custom Dictionaries
As shown in the previous steps, Word may flag a proper noun as an error because 
the proper noun is not in its main dictionary. To prevent Word from flagging proper 
nouns as errors, you can add the proper nouns to the custom dictionary. To add a 
correctly spelled word to the custom dictionary, tap or click the Add button (Spelling 
task pane) or press and hold and then tap ‘Show Context Menu’ button on mini 
toolbar or right-click the flagged word and then tap or click Add to Dictionary on the 
shortcut menu. Once you have added a word to the custom dictionary, Word no longer 
will flag it as an error. 
To View or Modify Entries in a Custom Dictionary
To view or modify the list of words in a custom dictionary, you would follow 
these steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon and then tap or click Options in the Backstage 
view.
2.	 Tap or click Proofing in the left pane (Word Options dialog box).
3.	 Tap or click the Custom Dictionaries button.
4.	 When Word displays the Custom Dictionaries dialog box, place a check mark next 
to the dictionary name to view or modify. Tap or click the ‘Edit Word List’ button 
(Custom Dictionaries dialog box). (In this dialog box, you can add or delete entries 
to and from the selected custom dictionary.)
5.	 When finished viewing and/or modifying the list, tap or click the OK button in the 
dialog box.
6.	 Tap or click the OK button (Custom Dictionaries dialog box). 
7.	 If the ‘Suggest from main dictionary only’ check box is selected in the Word 
Options dialog box, remove the check mark. Tap or click the OK button (Word

If you have multiple custom dictionaries, you can specify which one Word 
should use when checking spelling. To set the default custom dictionary, you would 
follow these steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon and then tap or click Options in the Backstage 
view.
2.	 Tap or click Proofing in the left pane (Word Options dialog box).
3.	 Tap or click the Custom Dictionaries button.

BTW
Readability Statistics
You can instruct Word to 
display readability statistics 
when it has finished a 
spelling and grammar check 
on a document. Three 
readability statistics presented 
are the percent of passive 
sentences, the Flesch Reading 
Ease score, and the Flesch-
Kincaid Grade Level score. 
The Flesch Reading Ease 
score uses a 100-point scale 
to rate the ease with which 
a reader can understand the 
text in a document. A higher 
score means the document 
is easier to understand. The 
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 
score rates the text in a 
document on a U.S. school 
grade level. For example, 
a score of 10.0 indicates 
a student in the tenth 
grade can understand the 
material. To show readability 
statistics when the spelling 
check is complete, open the 
Backstage view, tap or click 
Options in the Backstage 
view, tap or click Proofing in 
the left pane (Word Options 
dialog box), place a check 
mark in the ‘Show readability 
statistics’ check box, and 
then click the OK button. 
Readability statistics will be 
displayed the next time you 
check spelling and grammar 
at once in the document.

What decisions will you need to make when creating your next research paper?
Use these guidelines as you complete the assignments in this chapter and create your own research papers outside of this class.
1.	Select a topic. 
a)	Spend time brainstorming ideas for a topic. 
b)	Choose a topic you find interesting. 
c)	For shorter papers, narrow the scope of the topic; for longer papers, broaden the scope. 
d)	Identify a tentative thesis statement, which is a sentence describing the paper’s subject matter.
2.	Research the topic and take notes, being careful not to plagiarize.
3.	Organize your notes into related concepts, identifying all main ideas and supporting details in an outline. 
4.	Write the first draft from the outline, referencing all sources of information and following the guidelines identified in the

Inserting Missing Elements in an MLA-Styled Research Paper
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Instructions:  Run Word. Open the document, Analyze 2 - 1 Internet Filters Paper Draft, from the 
Data Files for Students. The document is a research paper that is missing several elements. You are 
to insert these missing elements, all formatted according to the MLA documentation style: header 
with a page number, name and course information, paper title, footnote, and source information for 
a citation.
1. Correct  In the research paper, correct the following items: 
(a)	 Insert a header with a your own last name and page number and then type the course 
information (your name, your instructor’s name, your course name, and today’s date), and an 
appropriate paper title, all formatted according to the MLA documentation style. 
(b)	 The Clark citation placeholder is missing its source information (shown in Figure 2 – 82 
on the next page). Use the following information to edit the source: book titled Internet 
Protection, written by Addison Lee Clark, publication year is 2014, publication city is New 
York, publisher is Journey Press, medium is Print. Edit the citation so that it displays the 
author name and the page numbers of 35–37 for this reference.
(c)	 Modify the website author name to include his middle name: Robert Timothy Lane. Also, 
change the medium in this same source from Print to Web.
(d)	 Use the Navigation Pane to display page 2. Insert a page break before the Works Cited 
heading. Use Word to insert the bibliographical list (bibliography) below the Works Cited 
heading.
2. Improve  Enhance the paper by inserting a footnote with the note reference at an appropriate 
place in the paper, formatted according to the MLA documentation style, that gives a statistic 
about spam. (You will need to do research to obtain this statistic.) Change the Footnote Text style 
to 12-point Times New Roman, double-spaced paragraphs with a first-line indent. Add a citation 
and source for your new footnote. Be sure to update the works cited page after you add the citation 
and source. Save the modified document with the file name, Analyze 2 - 1 Internet Filters Paper 
Modified, and then submit it in the format specified by your instructor.
3. 
 In this assignment you inserted a statistic from a web source. Why did you select that website?

Introduction
In a business environment, people use documents to communicate with others. 
Business documents can include letters, memos, newsletters, proposals, and resumes. 
An effective business document clearly and concisely conveys its message and has a 
professional, organized appearance. You can use your own creative skills to design and 
compose business documents. Using Word, for example, you can develop the content 
and decide on the location of each item in a business document. 
Project — Business Letter  
with a Letterhead and Table
At some time, you more than likely will prepare a business letter. Contents of 
business letters include requests, inquiries, confirmations, acknowledgements, 
recommendations, notifications, responses, thank you letters, invitations, offers, 
referrals, complaints, and more.
The project in this chapter follows generally accepted guidelines for writing 
letters and uses Word to create the business letter shown in Figure 3 – 1. This business 
letter is a thank you letter from a volunteer applicant to a volunteer organization 
(Washington Volunteer Foundation). The letter includes a custom letterhead, as well 
as all essential business letter components: date line, inside address, salutation, body, 
complimentary close, and signature block. To easily present his volunteer service 
background, the candidate presents this information in a table. His availability appears 
in a bulleted list.

To Change Margin Settings
Word is preset to use standard 8.5-by-11-inch paper, with 1-inch top, bottom, left, and right margins. The 
business letter in this chapter uses .75-inch left and right margins and 1-inch top and bottom margins. Why? You 
would like more text to fit from left to right on the page. 
When you change the default (preset) margin settings, the new margin settings affect every page in the 
document. If you wanted the margins to affect just a portion of the document, you would divide the document 
into sections (discussed in a later chapter), which enables you to specify different margin settings for each 
section. The next steps change margin settings.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the letter shown in Figure 3 – 1 on 
the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform 
as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 create and format a letterhead with graphics. 
2.	 specify the letter formats according to business letter guidelines. 
3.	 insert a table in the letter.
4.	 format the table in the letter.
5.	 insert a bulleted list in the letter.
6.	 address an envelope for the letter.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 2 SPECIFY LETTER FORMATS activity.

Creating a Letterhead
The cost of preprinted letterhead can be high. An alternative is to create your own 
letterhead and save it in a file. When you want to create a letter at a later time, you can 
start by using the letterhead file. The following pages create a letterhead and then save 
it in a file for future use.

What is a letterhead?
A letterhead is the section of a letter that identifies an organization or individual. Often, the letterhead appears at the top of a 
letter. Although you can design and print a letterhead yourself, many businesses pay an outside firm to design and print their let-
terhead, usually on higher-quality paper. They then use the professionally preprinted paper for external business communications.
If you do not have preprinted letterhead paper, you can design a creative letterhead. It is important the letterhead 
appropriately reflect the essence of the organization or individual (i.e., formal, technical, creative, etc.). That is, it should use 
text, graphics, formats, and colors that reflect the organization or individual. The letterhead should leave ample room for the 
contents of the letter. 
When designing a letterhead, consider its contents, placement, and appearance.
•	Contents of letterhead. A letterhead should contain these elements:
–	Complete legal name of the individual, group, or company
–	Complete mailing address: street address including building, room, suite number, or post office box, along with city, state, 
and postal code
–	Phone number(s) and fax number, if applicable
–	Email address
–	Web address, if applicable
–	Many letterheads also include a logo or other image; if an image is used, it should express the organization or individual’s 
personality or goals

To Insert a Shape
Word has a variety of predefined shapes, which are a type of drawing object, that you can insert in 
documents. A drawing object is a graphic that you create using Word. Examples of shape drawing objects 
include rectangles, circles, triangles, arrows, flowcharting symbols, stars, banners, and callouts. The following 
steps insert a rectangle shape in the letterhead. Why? The individual’s name is placed in a rectangle for emphasis and 
visual appeal. 
1 create & format letterhead with graphics | 2 specify letter formats
3 insert table | 4 format table | 5 insert bulleted list | 6 address envelope
The letterhead for the letter in this chapter consists of the individual’s name, 
appropriate graphics, postal address, phone number, and email address. The name and 
graphics are enclosed in a rectangular shape (Figure 3 – 1 on page WD 139), and the 
contact information is below the shape. You will follow these general steps to create 
the letterhead in this chapter:
1.	 Insert and format a shape.
2.	 Enter and format the individual’s name in the shape.
3.	 Insert, format, and position the images in the shape.
4.	 Enter the contact information below the shape.
5.	 Add a border below the contact information.
•	Display the INSERT tab.
•	Tap or click the ‘Draw a Shape’ 
button (INSERT tab | Illustrations 
group) to display the Draw a 
Shape gallery (Figure 3 – 3).

•	Placement of elements in the letterhead. Many letterheads center their elements across the top of the page. Others 
align some or all of the elements with the left or right margins. Sometimes, the elements are split between the top and bot-
tom of the page. For example, a name and logo may be at the top of the page with the address at the bottom of the page. 
•	Appearance of letterhead elements. Use fonts that are easy to read. Give the organization or individual name impact 
by making its font size larger than the rest of the text in the letterhead. For additional emphasis, consider formatting the 
name in bold, italic, or a different color. Choose colors that complement each other and convey the goals of the organization 
or individual.
When finished designing the letterhead, determine if a divider line would help to visually separate the letterhead from the 
remainder of the letter.

groups and buttons within 
the groups appear on the 
ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution.

To Change an Object’s Position
You can specify that an object’s vertical position on a page (top, middle, bottom) and its horizontal position 
(left, center, right). The following steps change the position of an object, specifically, the rectangle shape. Why? 
You want the shape to be centered at the top of the page in the letterhead. 
1 create & format letterhead with graphics | 2 specify letter formats
3 insert table | 4 format table | 5 insert bulleted list | 6 address envelope
Floating versus Inline Objects
When you insert an object in a document, Word inserts it as either an inline object or a floating 
object. An inline object is an object that is part of a paragraph. With inline objects, you change the 
location of the object by setting paragraph options, such as centered, right-aligned, and so on. For 
example, when you inserted the picture in Chapter 1, Word inserted it as an inline object. A floating 
object, by contrast, is an object that can be positioned at a specific location in a document or in a layer 
over or behind text in a document. The shape you just inserted is a floating object. You have more 
flexibility with floating objects because you can position a floating object anywhere on the page.
In addition to changing an object from inline to floating and vice versa, Word provides several 
floating options, which along with inline, are called text wrapping options because they affect how 
text wraps with or around the object. Table 3 – 1 presents the various text wrapping options. 
What is the purpose of the rotate handle?
When you drag an object’s rotate handle, which is the white circle on the top of the object, Word rotates the object 
in the direction you drag the mouse.
What if I wanted to delete a shape and start over?
With the shape selected, you would press the delete key.

To Change an Object’s Text Wrapping
When you insert a shape in a Word document, the default text wrapping is In Front of Text, which means 
the object will cover any text behind it. The previous steps, which changed the shape’s position, changed the text 
wrapping to Square. In the letterhead, you want the shape’s text wrapping to be Top and Bottom. Why? You want 
the letterhead above the contents of the letter when you type it, instead of covering the contents of the letter. The following 
steps change an object’s text wrapping.

3 insert table | 4 format table | 5 insert bulleted list | 6 address envelope
•	With the shape still selected, 
tap or click the Layout Options

•	Tap or click ‘Top and Bottom’ 
in the Layout Options gallery so 
that the object does not cover 
the document text (shown in 
Figure 3 – 9 on the next page).
How can I tell that the text 
wrapping has changed?
Because the letter has no 
text, you need to look at the 
paragraph mark, which now 
is positioned below the shape 
instead of to its left.

To Change the Document Theme
A document theme is a coordinated combination of colors, fonts, and effects. The current default 
document theme is Office, which uses Calibri and Calibri Light as its font and shades of grays and blues 
primarily. The following steps change the document theme to Organic for the letter in this chapter. Why? You 
want to use shades of greens, browns, and blues in the letterhead because those colors are associated with growth, honesty, 
dependability, and integrity. You also want to use a serif font, which is a font that has short decorative lines on some 
characters. The Organic theme meets both of these requirements.

To Insert Clip Art
Files containing graphics are available from a variety of sources. In the Chapter 1 flyer, you inserted a 
digital picture taken with a camera phone. In this project, you insert clip art, which is a predefined graphic. 
Microsoft Office applications can access a collection of royalty-free clip art, photos, and animations.
The letterhead in this project contains clip art of books (Figure 3 – 1 on page WD 139). Why? Because the 
writer of the letter enjoys reading and teaching, he selects an image of books for his letterhead. The following steps insert 
clip art in the document.

To Resize a Graphic  
to a Percent of the Original
Instead of dragging a sizing handle to change the graphic’s size, as you learned in Chapter 1, you can 
specify that the graphic be resized to a percent of its original size. In this project, the graphic is resized to 
14 percent of its original size. Why? The original size of the clip art is too large for the letterhead. The following 
steps resize a graphic to a percent of the original.
•	With the graphic still selected, tap or click the Advanced Layout: Size Dialog Box Launcher (PICTURE TOOLS 
FORMAT tab | Size group) to display the Size sheet in the Layout dialog box.
What if the graphic is not selected or the PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT tab is not on the ribbon?
Tap or click the graphic to select it or double-tap or double-click the graphic to make the PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT 
tab the active tab.
•	In the Scale area (Layout dialog box), double-tap or double-click the current value in the Height box to select it.
•	Type   14   in the Height box and then press the tab key to display the same percent value in the Width box (Figure 3 – 17).
Why did Word automatically fill in the value in the Width box?
When the ‘Lock aspect ratio’ check box (Layout dialog box) is selected, Word automatically maintains the size 
proportions of the graphic.
How do I know to use 14 percent for the resized graphic?
The larger graphic consumed too much room on the page. Try various percentages to determine the size that works 
best in the letterhead design.

To Change an Object’s Text Wrapping
The books graphic is to be positioned to the right of the shape. Clip art, 
by default, is formatted as an inline graphic, which cannot be moved to a precise 
location on a page. Recall that inline graphics are part of a paragraph and, thus, can 
be positioned according to paragraph formatting, such as centered or left-aligned. 
To move the graphic to the right of a shape, you format it as a floating object with  
‘In Front of Text’ wrapping. The following steps change a graphic’s text wrapping.

Q&A
To Save a Document
You have performed many tasks while creating this letterhead and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the document. 
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your files, 
for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains a Word folder (for your 
assignments). Thus, these steps save the document in the Word folder in the CIS 101 
folder using the file name, Samaras Letterhead. 
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, which depending on settings, 
will display either the Save As gallery in the Backstage view or the Save As dialog box.

Organizing Files  
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 
101, a good practice would 
be to save all Word files in 
a Word folder in a CIS 101 
folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of 
this book.

Word provides a method of inserting dots and other symbols, such as letters in the Greek alphabet and 
mathematical characters, that are not on the keyboard. The following steps insert a dot symbol, sometimes called 
a bullet symbol, in the letterhead. Why? You want a visual separator between the postal address and phone number in 
the letterhead, and also between the phone number and email address.

To Bottom Border a Paragraph
In Word, you can draw a solid line, called a border, at any edge of a paragraph. That is, borders may be 
added above or below a paragraph, to the left or right of a paragraph, or in any combination of these sides. 
The letterhead in this project has a border that extends from the left margin to the right margin 
immediately below the address, phone, and email address information. Why? The horizontal line separates the 
letterhead from the rest of the letter. The following steps add a bottom border to a paragraph.

To Clear Formatting
The next step is to position the insertion point below the letterhead, so that you can type the contents of 
the letter. When you press the enter key at the end of a paragraph containing a border, Word moves the border 
forward to the next paragraph. The paragraph also retains all current settings, such as the center format. Instead, 
you want the paragraph and characters on the new line to use the Normal style: black font with no border. 
Word uses the term, clear formatting, to refer to returning the formats to the Normal style. The 
following steps clear formatting at the location of the insertion point. Why? You do not want to retain the current 
formatting in the new paragraph.

and if I am using a 
mouse, can I click

instead of using the

Yes.
How would I remove 
an existing border 
from a paragraph?
If, for some reason, 
you wanted to

Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Word now. To resume at a later time, run Word, 
open the file called Samaras Letterhead, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Creating a Business Letter
With the letterhead for the business letter complete, the next task is to create the 
remainder of the content in the letter. The following pages use Word to create a 
business letter that contains a table and a bulleted list.
What should you consider when writing a business letter?
A finished business letter should look like a symmetrically framed picture with evenly spaced margins, all balanced below an attractive 
letterhead. The letter should be well written, properly formatted, logically organized, and use visuals where appropriate. The content 
of a letter should contain proper grammar, correct spelling, logically constructed sentences, flowing paragraphs, and sound ideas. 
Be sure to include all essential elements, use proper spacing and formats, and determine which letter style to use. 
•	Include all essential letter elements. All business letters contain the same basic elements, including the date line, 
inside address, message, and signature block (shown in Figure 3 – 1 on page WD 139). If a business letter does not use a let-
terhead, then the top of the letter should include return address information in a heading.
•	Use proper spacing and formats for the contents of the letter below the letterhead. Use a font that is easy 
to read, in a size between 8 and 12 point. Add emphasis with bold, italic, and bullets where appropriate, and use tables to 
present numeric information. Paragraphs should be single-spaced, with double-spacing between paragraphs.
•	Determine which letter style to use. You can follow many different styles when creating business letters. A letter 
style specifies guidelines for the alignment and spacing of elements in the business letter.
If possible, keep the length of a business letter to one page. Be sure to proofread the finished letter carefully.

folder [or your class folder] on your computer or SkyDrive).
	6	
Tap or click the Save button (Save As dialog box) to save the letter in the selected 
folder on the selected save location with the entered file name.
To Apply a Style
Recall that the Normal style in Word places 8 points of blank space after each paragraph and inserts a vertical 
space equal to 1.08 lines between each line of text. You will need to modify the spacing used for the paragraphs in 
the business letter. Why? Business letters should use single spacing for paragraphs and double spacing between paragraphs. 
Word has many built-in, or predefined, styles that you can use to format text. The No Spacing style, for 
example, defines line spacing as single and does not insert any additional blank space between lines when you 
press the enter key. To apply a style to a paragraph, you first position the insertion point in the paragraph. The 
following step applies the No Spacing style to a paragraph.
1 create & format letterhead with graphics | 2 specify letter formats
3 insert table | 4 format table | 5 insert bulleted list | 6 address envelope
•	With the insertion point positioned 
in the paragraph to be formatted, 
tap or click No Spacing in the Styles 
gallery (HOME tab | Styles group) 
to apply the selected style to the 
current paragraph (Figure 3 – 39).

WD 166   Word Chapter 3   Creating a Business Letter with a Letterhead and Table
Using Tab Stops to Align Text
A tab stop is a location on the horizontal ruler that tells Word where to position 
the insertion point when you press the tab key on the keyboard. Word, by default, 
places a tab stop at every one-half inch mark on the ruler. You also can set your own 
custom tab stops. Tab settings are a paragraph format. Thus, each time you press the 
enter key, any custom tab stops are carried forward to the next paragraph.
To move the insertion point from one tab stop to another, press the tab key on 
the keyboard. When you press the tab key, a tab character formatting mark appears 
in the empty space between the tab stops.
When you set a custom tab stop, you specify how the text will align at a tab stop. 
The tab marker on the ruler reflects the alignment of the characters at the location 
of the tab stop. Table 3 – 3 shows types of tab stop alignments in Word and their 
corresponding tab markers. 
What elements should a business letter contain?
Be sure to include all essential business letter elements, properly spaced, in your letter:
•	The date line, which consists of the month, day, and year, is positioned two to six lines below the letterhead.
•	The inside address, placed three to eight lines below the date line, usually contains the addressee’s courtesy title plus full 
name, job title, business affiliation, and full geographical address.
•	The salutation, if present, begins two lines below the last line of the inside address. If you do not know the recipient’s 
name, avoid using the salutation “To whom it may concern” — it is impersonal. Instead, use the recipient’s title in the saluta-
tion, e.g., Dear Personnel Director. In a business letter, use a colon (:) at the end of the salutation; in a personal letter, use a 
comma.
•	The body of the letter, the message, begins two lines below the salutation. Within the message, paragraphs are single-
spaced with one blank line between paragraphs.
•	Two lines below the last line of the message, the complimentary close is displayed. Capitalize only the first word in a 
complimentary close.
•	Type the signature block at least four blank lines below the complimentary close, allowing room for the author to sign his 
or her name.
What are the common styles of business letters?
Three common business letter styles are the block, the modified block, and the modified semi-block. Each style specifies 
different alignments and indentations. 
•	In the block letter style, all components of the letter begin flush with the left margin.
•	In the modified block letter style, the date, complimentary close, and signature block are positioned approximately one-half 
inch to the right of center or at the right margin. All other components of the letter begin flush with the left margin.
•	In the modified semi-block letter style, the date, complimentary close, and signature block are centered, positioned 
approximately one-half inch to the right of center or at the right margin. The first line of each paragraph in the body of the 
letter is indented one-half to one inch from the left margin. All other components of the letter begin flush with the left margin.
The business letter in this project follows the modified block style.

To Set Custom Tab Stops
The first required element of the business letter is the date line, which in this letter is positioned two 
lines below the letterhead. The date line contains the month, day, and year, and begins four inches from the left 
margin. Why? Business letter guidelines specify to begin the date line approximately one-half inch to the right of center. 
Thus, you should set a custom tab stop at the 4" mark on the ruler. The following steps set a left-aligned tab stop.
•	With the insertion point on the paragraph mark below the border (shown in Figure 3 – 39 on page WD 165), press 
the enter key so that a blank line appears above the insertion point.
•	If you are using a touch screen, proceed to Step 3 on the next page because you have to use a different method to set 
custom tabs.
•	If you are using a mouse, if necessary, click the tab selector at the left edge of the horizontal ruler until it displays 
the type of tab you wish to use, which is the Left Tab icon in this case.

•	If you are using a mouse, position 
the pointer on the 4" mark on 
the ruler, which is the location 
of the desired custom tab stop 
(Figure 3 – 40).
What is the purpose of the 
tab selector?
Before using the ruler to set a tab 
stop, ensure the correct tab stop 
icon appears in the tab selector. 
Each time you click the tab selector, 
its icon changes. The Left Tab icon 
is the default. For a list of the types 
of tab stops, see Table 3 – 3.

To Create a Building Block
If you use the same text or graphic frequently, you can store the text or graphic as a building block and 
then insert the stored building block entry in the open document, as well as in future documents. That is, you 
can create the entry once as a building block and then insert the building block when you need it. In this way, 
you avoid entering text or graphics inconsistently or incorrectly in different locations throughout the same or 
multiple documents.
The following steps create a building block for the volunteer organization name, Washington Volunteer 
Foundation. Why? Later, you will insert the building block in the document instead of typing the volunteer organization 
name.

Building Blocks versus AutoCorrect
In Chapter 2, you learned how to use the AutoCorrect feature, which enables 
you to insert and create AutoCorrect entries, similarly to how you created and inserted 
building blocks in this chapter. The difference between an AutoCorrect entry and 
a building block entry is that the AutoCorrect feature makes corrections for you 
automatically as soon as you press the spacebar or type a punctuation mark, whereas 
you must instruct Word to insert a building block. That is, you enter the building block 
name and then press the f3 key, or tap or click the Explore Quick Parts button and 
select the building block from one of the galleries or the Building Blocks Organizer.

To Insert a Nonbreaking Space
Some compound words, such as proper nouns, dates, units of time and measure, abbreviations, and 
geographic destinations, should not be divided at the end of a line. These words either should fit as a unit at the 
end of a line or be wrapped together to the next line.
Word provides two special characters to assist with this task: the nonbreaking space and the nonbreaking 
hyphen. A nonbreaking space is a special space character that prevents two words from splitting if the first 
word falls at the end of a line. Similarly, a nonbreaking hyphen is a special type of hyphen that prevents two 
words separated by a hyphen from splitting at the end of a line. 
The following steps insert a nonbreaking space between the two words in the city name, Branch Center. 
Why? You want these two words in the city name to appear on the same physical line.
•	With the insertion point at the end of the first sentence in the body of the letter (as shown in Figure 3 – 50), press 
the spacebar.
•	Type   I truly enjoyed our conversation and am excited about the possibility of 
volunteering with your Branch   and then press ctrl+shift+spacebar to insert a nonbreaking 
space after the 
entered word 
(Figure 3 – 51).

To Save an Existing Document with the Same File Name
You have made several modifications to the document since you last saved it. 
Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the document again. 
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Word now. To resume at a later time, run Word, 
open the file called Samaras Thank You Letter, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Tables
The next step in composing the business letter is to place a table listing the 
volunteer service background (shown in Figure 3 – 1 on page WD 139). A Word table 
is a collection of rows and columns. The intersection of a row and a column is called a 
cell, and cells are filled with data.
The first step in creating a table is to insert an empty table in the document. 
When inserting a table, you must specify the total number of rows and columns 
required, which is called the dimension of the table. The table in this project has 
three columns. You often do not know the total number of rows in a table. Thus, many 
Word users create one row initially and then add more rows as needed. In Word, the 
first number in a dimension is the number of columns, and the second is the number 
of rows. For example, in Word, a 3 3 1 (pronounced “three by one”) table consists of 
three columns and one row.
To Insert an Empty Table
The next step is to insert an empty table in the letter. The following steps insert a table with three 
columns and one row at the location of the insertion point. Why? The first column will identify the organization, the 
second will identify the primary responsibility, and the third will identify the term of service in years. You will start with one 
row and add them as needed.
•	Scroll the document so that you 
will be able to see the table in the 
document window.
•	Display the insert tab.
•	With the insertion point 
positioned as shown in 
Figure 3 – 53, tap or click the ‘Add 
a Table’ button (INSERT tab |

What are the 
small circles in 
the table cells?
Each table cell has an 
end-of-cell  
mark, 
which is a 
formatting  
mark that assists you with selecting and formatting cells. Similarly, each row has an end-of-row mark, which you can 
use to add columns to the right of a table. Recall that formatting marks do not print on a hard copy. The end-of-cell 
marks currently are left-aligned, that is, positioned at the left edge of each cell.

To Enter Data in a Table
The next step is to enter data in the cells of the empty table. The data you enter in a cell wordwraps just as 
text wordwraps between the margins of a document. To place data in a cell, you tap or click the cell and then type.
To advance rightward from one cell to the next, press the tab key. When you are at the rightmost cell in 
a row, press the tab key to move to the first cell in the next row; do not press the enter key. Why? The enter 
key is used to begin a new paragraph within a cell. One way to add new rows to a table is to press the tab key when 
the insertion point is positioned in the bottom-right corner cell of the table. The step on the next page enters 
data in the first row of the table and then inserts a blank second row.

For simple tables, such as 
the one just created, Word 
users often select the table 
dimension in the Add a Table 
gallery to create the table. 
For a more complex table, 
such as one with a varying 
number of columns per 
row, Word has a Draw Table 
feature that allows users to 
draw a table in the document 
using a pencil pointer. To use 
this feature, click the ‘Add a

To Apply a Table Style
Word provides a gallery of more than 90 table styles, which include a variety of colors and shading. Why? 
Table styles allow you to change the basic table format to a more visually appealing style. The following steps apply a 
table style to the table in the letter.
•	If the First Column check box in the Table Style Options group (TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab) contains a check mark, 
tap or click the check box to remove the check mark. Be sure the remaining check marks match those in the Table 
Style Options group (TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab) as shown in Figure 3 – 58.
What if the TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab no longer is the active tab?
Tap or click in the table and then display the TABLE TOOLS DESIGN tab.
What do the options in the Table Style Options group mean?
When you apply table styles, if you want the top row of the table (header row), a row containing totals (total row), 
first column, or last column to be formatted differently, select those check boxes. If you want the rows or columns  
to alternate with colors, select Banded Rows or Banded Columns, respectively.
•	With the insertion point in the table, 
tap or click the More button in the 
Table Styles gallery (TABLE TOOLS 
DESIGN tab | Table Styles  
group), shown in Figure 3 – 57,  
to expand the gallery.
•	If you are using a mouse, scroll 
and then point to ‘Grid Table 6 
Colorful - Accent 1’ in the Table 
Styles gallery to display a live 
preview of that style applied 
to the table in the document 
(Figure 3 – 58).
 Experiment
•	If you are using a mouse, point to 
various styles in the Table Styles 
gallery and watch the format of 
the table change in the document 
window.

•	Tap or click AutoFit Contents on 
the AutoFit menu, so that Word 
automatically adjusts the widths 
of the columns based on the text 
in the table (Figure 3 – 61). 
Can I resize columns manually?
Yes, you can drag a column 
boundary, the border to the right 
of a column, until the column is 
the desired width. Similarly, you 
can resize a row by dragging the 
row boundary, the border at the bottom of a row, until the row is the desired height. 
You also can resize the entire table by dragging the table resize handle, which is a small 
square that appears when you point to a corner of the table.
What causes the table move handle and table resize handle to appear and disappear 
from the table?
They appear whenever you position the pointer in the table.

Q&A
To Resize Table Columns to Fit Table Contents
The table in this project currently extends from the left margin to the right margin of the document. 
The following steps instruct Word to fit the width of the columns to the contents of the table automatically. 
Why? You want each column to be only as wide as the longest entry in the table. That is, the first column must be wide 
enough to accommodate the words, Newton County Youth Groups, and the second column should be only as wide as the title, 
Special Events Vocalist, and so on.
•	With the insertion point in the 
table, display the TABLE TOOLS 
LAYOUT tab.
•	Tap or click the AutoFit button 
(TABLE TOOLS LAYOUT tab | Cell

To Align Data in Cells
The next step is to change the alignment of the data in cells in the third column of the table. In addition 
to aligning text horizontally in a cell (left, center, or right), you can align it vertically within a cell (top, center, 
bottom). When the height of the cell is close to the same height as the text, however, differences in vertical 
alignment are not readily apparent, which is the case for this table. The following step centers data in cells. 
Why? The column containing the term of service would look better if its contents are centered.
•	With the cells 
selected, as shown in 
Figure 3 – 62 on the 
previous page, tap 
or click the desired 
alignment, in this 
case the ‘Align Top 
Center’ button 
(TABLE TOOLS

to center the 
contents of the 
selected cells  
(Figure 3 – 63).

To Center a Table
When you first create a table, it is left-aligned; that is, it is flush with the left margin. In this letter, the 
table should be centered between the margins. To center a table, you first select the entire table. The following 
steps select and center a table using the mini toolbar. Why? Recall that you can use buttons and boxes on the mini 
toolbar instead of those on the ribbon.
•	If you are using a mouse, position the pointer in the table so that the table move handle appears (shown in 
Figure 3 – 63). 
What if the table move handle does not appear?
You also can select a table by clicking the Select Table button (TABLE TOOLS LAYOUT tab | Table group) and then 
clicking Select Table on the menu.
•	If you are using a 
mouse, click the 
table move handle 
to select the entire 
table (Figure 3 – 64).
•	If you are using a 
touch screen, tap the 
Select Table button 
(TABLE TOOLS

To Insert a Row in a Table
The next step is to insert a row at the top of the table. Why? You want to place a title on the table. As 
discussed earlier, you can insert a row at the end of a table by positioning the insertion point in the bottom-right 
corner cell and then pressing the tab key. You cannot use the tab key to insert a row at the beginning or middle 
of a table. Instead, you use the ‘Insert Rows Above’ or ‘Insert Rows Below’ command or the Insert Control 
(shown in Figure 3 – 70 on page WD 183). The following steps insert a row to the top of a table.
•	Position the insertion 
point somewhere in 
the first row of the 
table because you

To Insert a Column in a Table
If you wanted to insert a column in a table, instead of inserting rows, you would 
perform the following steps.
1.	 If you are using a mouse, point above the table and then click the desired 
Insert Control.
or
1.	 Position the insertion point in the column to the left or right of where you 
want to insert the column.
2.	 Tap or click the ‘Insert Columns to the Left’ button (TABLE TOOLS 
LAYOUT tab | Rows & Columns group) to insert a column to the left of 
the current column, or tap or click the ‘Insert Columns to the Right’ button

column to the right of the current column. 
or
1.	 Press and hold or right-click the table, tap Insert Table button on mini 
toolbar or point to Insert on the shortcut menu, and then tap Insert Left or 
Insert Right or click ‘Insert Columns to the Left’ or ‘Insert Columns to the 
Right’ on the Insert submenu.
To Merge Cells
The row just inserted has one cell for each column, in this case, three cells (shown in Figure 3 – 67). 
The top row of the table, however, is to be a single cell that spans all rows. Why? The top row contains the table 
title, which should be centered above the columns of the table. Thus, the following steps merge the three cells into a 
single cell.
•	With the cells to 
merge selected 
(as shown in 
Figure 3 – 67 on the 
previous page), tap 
or click the Merge 
Cells button (TABLE

To Split Table Cells
Instead of merging multiple cells into a single cell, sometimes you want to split 
a single cell into multiple cells. If you wanted to split cells, you would perform the 
following steps.
1.	 Position the insertion point in the cell to split.
2.	 Tap or click the Split Cells button (TABLE TOOLS LAYOUT tab | Merge group); 
or tap ‘Show Context Menu’ button on mini toolbar or right-click the cell and then

To Split a Table 
Instead of splitting table cells into multiple cells, sometimes you want to split a 
single table into multiple cells. If you wanted to split a table, you would perform the 
following steps.
1.	 Position the insertion point in the cell where you want the table to be split.
2.	 Tap or click the Split Table button (TABLE TOOLS LAYOUT tab | Merge group) 
to split the table into two tables at the location of the insertion point.
To Change the Font of Text in a Table Row
When you added a row to the top of the table for the title, Word moved the 
bold format from the column headings (which originally were in the first row of the 
table) to the title row (which now is the first row). Because you would like the columns 
headings bold also, the following steps select a table row and bold its contents. 
	1	
Select the row containing the column headings (Figure 3 – 70).
	2	
With the text selected, tap or click the Bold button (HOME tab | Font group) to bold 
the selected text.
What is the symbol that appeared to the left of the table?
When you use a mouse to select a row or column in a table, Word displays an Insert 
Control. You can click the Insert Control to add a row or column to the table at that 
location.

To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of the 
account from the Account gallery in the Backstage view before exiting Word. Signing 
out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can access SkyDrive 
files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following steps sign out of a 
Microsoft account from Word. For a detailed example of the procedure summarized 
below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.

If you wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, tap or click FILE on the ribbon to 
open the Backstage view and then tap or click the Account tab to display the Account 
gallery.
	2	
Tap or click the Sign out link, which displays the Remove Account dialog box. If a Can’t 
remove Windows accounts dialog box appears instead of the Remove Account dialog 
box, tap or click the OK button and skip the remaining steps.
Why does a Can’t remove Windows accounts dialog box appear? 
If you signed in to Windows using your Microsoft account, then you also must sign 
out from Windows, rather than signing out from within Word. When you are finished 
using Windows, be sure to sign out at that time. 
	3	
Tap or click the Yes button (Remove Account dialog box) to sign out of your Microsoft 
account on this computer.
Should I sign out of Windows after signing out of my Microsoft account? 
When you are finished using the computer, you should sign out of your account for 
maximum security.
	4	
Tap or click the Back button in the upper-left corner of the Backstage view to return 
to the document.
To Exit Word
This project now is complete. The following steps exit Word. For a detailed 
example of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter 
at the beginning of this book.
	1a	 If you have one Word document open, tap or click the Close button on the right side 
of the title bar to close the open document and exit Word.
	1b	 If you have multiple Word documents open, press and hold or right-click the Word 
app button on the taskbar and then tap or click ‘Close all windows’ on the shortcut 
menu to close all open documents and exit Word.

Introduction
A PowerPoint presentation, also called a slide show, can help you deliver a dynamic, 
professional-looking message to an audience. PowerPoint allows you to produce slides 
to use in an academic, business, or other environment. The collection of slides in a 
presentation is called a deck, resembling a deck of cards that are stacked on top of each 
other. A common use of slide decks is to enhance an oral presentation. A speaker might 
desire to convey information, such as urging students to volunteer at a fund-raising 
event, explaining changes in employee compensation packages, or describing a new 
laboratory procedure. The PowerPoint slides should reinforce the speaker’s message 
and help the audience retain the information presented. Custom slides can fit your 
specific needs and contain diagrams, charts, tables, pictures, shapes, video, sound, and 
animation effects to make your presentation more effective. An accompanying handout 
gives audience members reference notes and review material for your presentation.
Project — Presentation with a Bulleted List, 
Photos, and an Illustration
In this chapter’s project, you will follow proper design guidelines and learn to use 
PowerPoint to create, save, and print the slides shown in Figures 1 – 1a through 1 – 1e. 
The objective is to produce a presentation, titled Keeping Hydrated, to help athletes 
understand the need to drink water before, during, and after a workout. This slide 
show has a variety of pictures and visual elements to add interest and give facts 
about proper hydration. Some of the text has formatting and color enhancements. 
Transitions help one slide flow gracefully into the next during a slide show. In addition, 
you will print a handout of your slides to distribute to audience members.

Roadmap 
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the slides shown in Figure 1 – 1 on 
the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform 
as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 insert the four presentation slides, using various layouts.
2.	 enter the text for the slides.
3.	 format the text on each slide.
4.	 insert graphical elements, including photos and an illustration.
5.	 size and position the graphical elements.
6.	 enhance the slide show by adding a closing slide and transition.
7.	 display and print the slides and a handout.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity; blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 5 Size & Position activity.
1 insert presentation slides | 2 enter text | 3 format text | 4 insert graphical elements
5 size & position | 6 enhance slide show | 7 display & print slides
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through the 
instructions in this chapter.
To Run PowerPoint
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter 
and you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change 
your screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a 
computer’s resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning  
of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start 
screen or the search box to run PowerPoint based on a typical installation. You 
may need to ask your instructor how to run PowerPoint on your computer. For 
a detailed example of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter.
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for a PowerPoint 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains a 
PowerPoint 2013 tile, tap or click it to run PowerPoint and then proceed to Step 5; if 
the Start screen does not contain the PowerPoint 2013 tile, proceed to the next step 
to search for the PowerPoint app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of the 
screen to display the Charms bar and then tap or click the Search charm on the Charms 
bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   PowerPoint   as the search text in the Search box and watch the search results 
appear in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click PowerPoint 2013 in the search results to run PowerPoint.
	5	
If the PowerPoint window is not maximized, tap or click the Maximize button on its 
title bar to maximize the window.
For an introduction to 
Windows and instruction 
about how to perform 
basic Windows tasks, 
read the Office and 
Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this 
book, where you can 
learn how to resize 
windows, change screen 
resolution, create folders, 
move and rename files, 
use Windows Help, and 
much more.
One of the few 
differences between 
Windows 7 and 
Windows 8 occurs 
in the steps to run 
PowerPoint. If you 
are using Windows 7, 
click the Start button, 
type   PowerPoint   in 
the ‘Search programs 
and files’ box, click 
PowerPoint 2013, 
and then, if necessary, 
maximize the PowerPoint 
window. For detailed 
steps to run PowerPoint 
in Windows 7, refer 
to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book. 
For a summary of the 
steps, refer to the Quick 
Reference located at the 
back of this book.

Choosing a Document Theme and Variant
You easily can give the slides in a presentation a professional and integrated appearance 
by using a theme. A document theme is a specific design with coordinating colors, fonts, 
and special effects such as shadows and reflections. Several themes are available when 
you run PowerPoint, each with a specific name. Using one of the formatted themes 
makes creating a professional-looking presentation easier and quicker than using the 
Blank Presentation template, where you would need to make all design decisions.
Each theme has a set of four alternate designs, called variants. Each variant has 
the same overall composition, but the colors, fonts, and design elements differ. Once you 
select a theme, you then can select a variation that best fits your overall design needs. If 
you later decide that another theme or variant would better fit the presentation’s general 
theme, you can change these elements while you are developing slides.

When you begin creating a new PowerPoint presentation, you need to select a theme. You either can 
start with no design elements by using the Blank Presentation, or you select one of the available professionally 
designed themes. The following steps apply the Ion theme and then change the variant. Why? The title slide will 
have text and a photo, so you want to select a theme, like Ion, with an uncluttered background. The presentation discusses 
the importance of drinking water while exercising, and blue is the color commonly associated with water in lakes and 
oceans. The default Ion theme is predominantly green and white, but one of its variants is blue and is an appropriate choice 
to relate to the water concept.

PowerPoint Chapter 1
Creating and Editing a Presentation with Pictures   PowerPoint Chapter 1   PPT 7
Creating a Title Slide
When you open a new presentation, the default Title Slide layout appears. The 
purpose of this layout is to introduce the presentation to the audience. PowerPoint 
includes other standard layouts for each of the themes. The slide layouts are set up in 
landscape orientation, where the slide width is greater than its height. In landscape 
orientation, the slide size is preset to 10 inches wide and 7.5 inches high when printed 
on a standard sheet of paper measuring 11 inches wide and 8.5 inches high.
Placeholders are boxes with dotted or hatch-marked borders that are displayed 
when you create a new slide. Most layouts have both a title text placeholder and at 
least one content placeholder. Depending on the particular slide layout selected, title 
and subtitle placeholders are displayed for the slide title and subtitle; a content text 
placeholder is displayed for text, art, or a table, chart, picture, graphic, or movie. The 
title slide has two text placeholders where you can type the main heading, or title, of a 
new slide and the subtitle.
With the exception of the Blank slide layout, PowerPoint assumes every new 
slide has a title. To make creating a presentation easier, any text you type after a new 
slide appears becomes title text in the title text placeholder. The following steps create 
the title slide for this presentation.
CONSIDER THIS
Choose the words for the slide.
All presentations should follow the 7 3 7 rule, which states that each slide should have a maximum of seven lines, and each 
line should have a maximum of seven words. PowerPoint designers must choose their words carefully and, in turn, help viewers 
read the slides easily.
Avoid line wraps. Your audience’s eyes want to stop at the end of a line. Thus, you must plan your words carefully or adjust the 
font size so that each point displays on only one line.

Correcting a Mistake When Typing
If you type the wrong letter, press the backspace key to erase all the characters 
back to and including the one that is incorrect. If you mistakenly press the enter 
key after typing the title and the insertion point is on the new line, simply press the 
backspace key to return the insertion point to the right of the letter in the word, Water.
When you install PowerPoint, the default setting allows you to reverse up to the 
last 20 changes by tapping or clicking the Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar. 
The ScreenTip that appears when you point to the Undo button changes to indicate 
the type of change just made. For example, if you type text in the title text placeholder 
and then point to the Undo button, the ScreenTip that appears is Undo Typing. For 
clarity, when referencing the Undo button in this project, the name displaying in the 
ScreenTip is referenced. You can reapply a change that you reversed with the Undo 
button by tapping or clicking the Redo button on the Quick Access Toolbar. Tapping 
or clicking the Redo button reverses the last undo action. The ScreenTip name reflects 
the type of reversal last performed.
Paragraphs
Text in the subtitle text placeholder supports the title text. It can appear on 
one or more lines in the placeholder. To create more than one subtitle line, you press 
the enter key after typing some words. PowerPoint creates a new line, which is the 
second paragraph in the placeholder. A paragraph is a segment of text with the same 
format that begins when you press the enter key and ends when you press the enter 
key again. This new paragraph is the same level as the previous paragraph. A level 
is a position within a structure, such as an outline, that indicates the magnitude of 
importance. PowerPoint allows for five paragraph levels.

Q&A
Formatting Characters in a Presentation
Recall that each document theme determines the color scheme, font set, and layout of 
a presentation. You can use a specific document theme and then change the characters’ 
formats any time before, during, or after you type the text.
Fonts and Font Styles
Characters that appear on the screen are a specific shape and size. Examples of 
how you can modify the appearance, or format, of these typed characters on the screen 
and in print include changing the font, style, size, and color. The font, or typeface, 
defines the appearance and shape of the letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and 
symbols. Style indicates how the characters are formatted. PowerPoint’s text font styles 
include regular, italic, bold, and bold italic. Size specifies the height of the characters 
and is gauged by a measurement system that uses points. A point is 1/72 of an inch in 
height. Thus, a character with a font size of 36 is 36/72 (or 1/2) of an inch in height. 
Color defines the hue of the characters.

This presentation uses the Ion document theme, which has particular font styles 
and font sizes. The Ion document theme default title text font is named Century 
Gothic. It has no special effects, and its size is 54 point. The Ion default subtitle text 
font also is Century Gothic with a font size of 18 point.

You can use many techniques to format characters. When you want to apply the same formats to multiple 
words or paragraphs, it is helpful to select these words. Why? It is efficient to select the desired text and then make the 
desired changes to all the characters simultaneously. The first formatting change you will make will apply to the title 
slide subtitle. The following step selects this paragraph.

Different font styles often are used on slides. Why? These style changes make the words more appealing to the 
reader and emphasize particular text. Italicized text has a slanted appearance. Used sparingly, it draws the readers’ 
eyes to these characters. The following step adds emphasis to the line of the subtitle text by changing regular 
text to italic text.

•	With the subtitle text still 
selected, tap or click the Italic 
button on the mini toolbar to 
italicize that text on the slide

PowerPoint designers use many techniques to emphasize words and characters on a slide. To accentuate 
the word, Water, on your slide, you want to increase the font size and change the font color to dark blue for the 
word, WATER, in the subtitle text. To make these changes, you should begin by selecting the word, WATER. 
Why? You could perform these actions separately, but it is more efficient to select the word and then change the font 
attributes. The following steps select a word.

•	Tap or click Dark Blue in the Standard Colors row on the mini toolbar (second color from right) to change the font 
color to Dark Blue (Figure 1 – 16).
Why did I select the color Dark Blue?
Dark Blue is one of the 10 standard colors associated with every document theme, and it is a universal color 
representing the natural resource of water. The color will emphasize the fact that the presentation focuses on 
water.
What is the difference between the colors shown in the Theme Colors area and the Standard Colors?
The 10 colors in the top row of the Theme Colors area are two text, two background, and six accent colors in the 
Ion theme; the five colors in each column under the top row display different transparencies. The Standard Colors

To Save a Presentation with a New File Name
You have performed many tasks while creating this presentation and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the presentation 
on your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation.
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your 
files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains a PowerPoint folder 
(for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the presentation in the PowerPoint

Organizing Files  
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 101, 
a good practice would be to 
save all PowerPoint files in 
a PowerPoint folder in a CIS 
101 folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to the 
Office and Windows chapter 
at the beginning of this book.

Adding a New Slide to a Presentation
With the text for the title slide for the presentation created, the next step is to add the 
first text slide immediately after the title slide. Usually, when you create a presentation, 
you add slides with text, pictures, graphics, or charts. Some placeholders allow you 
to double-tap or double-click the placeholder and then access other objects, such as 
videos, charts, diagrams, and organization charts. You can change the layout for a slide 
at any time during the creation of a presentation.
To Add a New Text Slide  
with a Bulleted List
1 insert presentation slides | 2 enter text | 3 format text | 4 insert graphical elements
5 size & position | 6 enhance slide show | 7 display & print slides
When you add a new slide, PowerPoint uses the Title and Content slide layout. This layout provides a 
title placeholder and a content area for text, art, charts, and other graphics. A vertical scroll bar appears in the 
Slide pane when you add the second slide. Why? The scroll bar allows you to move from slide to slide easily. A small 
image of this slide also appears in the Thumbnail pane. The step on the next page adds a new slide with the 
Title and Content slide layout.
BTW
The Ribbon and 
Screen Resolution
PowerPoint may change 
how the groups and buttons 
within the groups appear on 
the ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than

Creating and Editing a Presentation with Pictures   PowerPoint Chapter 1   PPT 17
Creating a Text Slide with a Multilevel  
Bulleted List
The information in the Slide 2 text placeholder is presented in a bulleted list with 
three levels. A bulleted list is a list of paragraphs, each of which may be preceded by 
a bullet character, such as a dot, arrow, or checkmark. Some themes, such as the Ion 
theme, do not display a bullet character at the start of a paragraph by default. A slide 
that consists of more than one level of bulleted text is called a multilevel bulleted list 
slide. In a multilevel bulleted list, a lower-level paragraph is a subset of a higher-level 
paragraph. It usually contains information that supports the topic in the paragraph 
immediately above it.
As you can see in Figure 1 – 1b on page PPT 3, two of the Slide 2 paragraphs 
appear at the same level, called the first level: Cushions and protects vital organs, and 
Regulates body temperature. Beginning with the second level, each paragraph indents 
to the right of the preceding level and is pushed down to a lower level. For example, if 
you increase the indent of a first-level paragraph, it becomes a second-level paragraph. 
The second, fourth, and fifth paragraphs on Slide 2 are second-level paragraphs. The 
last paragraph, Can cause muscle fatigue and heat stroke, is a third-level paragraph.
Creating a text slide with a multilevel bulleted list requires several steps. Initially, 
you enter a slide title in the title text placeholder. Next, you select the content text 
placeholder. Then, you type the text for the multilevel bulleted list, increasing and 
decreasing the indents as needed. The next several sections add a slide with a multilevel 
bulleted list.
To Enter a Slide Title

PowerPoint assumes every new slide has a title. Why? The audience members read the title and then can begin 
to focus their attention on the information being presented on that slide. The title for Slide 2 is Water: Your Essential 
Nutrient. The following step enters this title.

•	Tap or click the label, 
‘Tap to add title’, 
or, ‘Click to add

Why? Before you can type text into a content placeholder, you first must select it. The following step selects the 
text placeholder on Slide 2.

To Type a Multilevel Bulleted List

5 size & position | 6 enhance slide show | 7 display & print slides
The content placeholder provides an area for the text characters. When you tap or click inside a 
placeholder, you then can type or paste text. As discussed previously, a bulleted list is a list of paragraphs, each 
of which is preceded by a bullet. A paragraph is a segment of text ended by pressing the enter key. The theme 
determines the bullets for each level. Why? The bullet variations are determined by the specific paragraph levels, and 
they generally vary in size, shape, and color.
The content text placeholder is selected, so the next step is to type the multilevel bulleted list that consists 
of six paragraphs, as shown in Figure 1 – 1b on page PPT 3. Creating a lower-level paragraph is called demoting 
text; creating a higher-level paragraph is called promoting text. The following steps create a multilevel bulleted 
list consisting of three levels.

PowerPoint designers use many techniques to emphasize words and characters on a slide. To highlight 
your slide show’s concept of the dangers of not drinking water while exercising, you want to bold and increase 
the font size of the words, cannot cool itself, in the body text. The following steps select three words. Why? You 
could perform these actions separately, but it is more efficient to select the words and then change the font attributes.

Adding New Slides, Changing Slide Layouts, 
and Changing the Theme
Slide 3 in Figure 1 – 1c on page PPT 3 contains an illustration of a character drinking 
water and does not contain a bulleted list. When you add a new slide, PowerPoint 
applies the Title and Content layout. This layout, along with the Title Slide layout for 
Slide 1, are the default styles. A layout specifies the arrangement of placeholders on a 
slide. These placeholders are arranged in various configurations and can contain text, 
such as the slide title or a bulleted list, or they can contain content, such as SmartArt 
graphics, photos, charts, tables, and shapes. The placement of the text, in relationship 
to content, depends on the slide layout. You can specify a particular slide layout when 
you add a new slide to a presentation or after you have created the slide.
Using the layout gallery, you can choose a slide layout. The nine layouts in 
this gallery have a variety of placeholders to define text and content positioning and 
formatting. Three layouts are for text: Title Slide, Section Header, and Title Only. 
Five are for text and content: Title and Content, Two Content, Comparison, Content 
with Caption, and Picture with Caption. The Blank layout has no placeholders. If none 
of these standard layouts meets your design needs, you can create a custom layout. 
A custom layout specifies the number, size, and location of placeholders, background 
content, and optional slide and placeholder-level properties.
When you change the layout of a slide, PowerPoint retains the text and 
objects and repositions them into the appropriate placeholders. Using slide 
layouts eliminates the need to resize objects and the font size because PowerPoint 
automatically sizes the objects and text to fit the placeholders. At any time when 
creating the slide content, you can change the theme and variant to give the 
presentation a different look and feel.
BTW
Customizing  
a Slide Layout
PowerPoint provides a wide 
variety of slide layouts for 
each theme, but you can 
customize the layouts to 
make your deck unique. 
Display the VIEW tab, tap or 
click Slide Master (VIEW tab | 
Master Views group), select

A theme provides consistency in design and color throughout the entire presentation by setting the color 
scheme, font set, and layout of a presentation. This collection of formatting choices includes a set of colors (the 
Theme Colors group), a set of heading and content text fonts (the Theme Fonts group), and a set of lines and 
fill effects (the Theme Effects group). These groups allow you to choose and change the appearance of all the 
slides or individual slides in your presentation. Why? At any time while creating the slide deck, you may decide to 
switch the theme so that the slides have a totally different appearance. The following steps change the theme for this 
presentation from Ion to Facet.

PowerPoint Views
The PowerPoint window display varies depending on the view. A view is the mode 
in which the presentation appears on the screen. You will use some views when you 
are developing slides and others when you are delivering your presentation. When 
creating a presentation, you most likely will use Normal, Slide Sorter, Notes Page, and 
Outline views. When presenting your slides to an audience, you most likely will use 
Slide Sorter, Presenter, and Reading views. 
The default view is Normal view, which is composed of three areas that allow 
you to work on various aspects of a presentation simultaneously. The large area in 
the middle, called the Slide pane, displays the slide you currently are developing and 
allows you to enter text, tables, charts, graphics, pictures, video, and other elements. 
As you create the slides, miniature views of the individual slides, called thumbnails, 
are displayed in the Thumbnail pane. You can rearrange the thumbnails in this pane. 
The Notes pane, by default, is hidden at the bottom of the window. If you want to 
type notes to yourself or remarks to share with your audience, you can click the Notes 
button in the status bar to open the Notes pane. After you have created at least two 
slides, a scroll bar containing scroll arrows and scroll boxes will appear on the right 
edge of the window.

Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit PowerPoint now (refer to page PPT 55 for 
instructions). To resume at a later time, run PowerPoint (refer to page PPT 4 for instructions), open the file called Keeping Hydrated, 
and continue following the steps from this location forward.
To Save an Existing Presentation with the Same File Name
You have made several modifications to the presentation since you last saved it. 
Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the presentation again. For 
an example of the step listed below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

If you are designing a slide in 
your deck other than Slide 1 
and then save and close the 
document, PowerPoint’s 
new Welcome back! feature 
allows you to continue 
where you left off at the last 
save when you open the 
document. You may need to 
adjust the zoom if you are 
working at a different level 
than the default setting.

Inserting Photos and Illustrations into Slides
A clip is a single media file, such as a photo, illustration, sound, or video. Adding a 
clip can help increase the visual and audio appeal of many slides and can offer a quick 
way to add professional-looking graphics and multimedia to a presentation without 
creating these files yourself. This material is contained in the Office.com Clip Art 
collection of drawings, photos, sounds, and other media files shared among Microsoft 
Office applications.
You also can add your own clips to slides. These images may include scanned 
photos, illustrations, and artwork from storage media, such as USB flash drives, hard 
disks, and memory cards. If you have a Microsoft account, you can add photos from 
other websites, including Flickr and SkyDrive.
You can add images from Office.com to your presentation in two ways. One 
way is by selecting one of the slide layouts that includes a content placeholder with 
an Online Pictures button. A second method is by tapping or clicking the Online 
Pictures button in the Images area on the INSERT tab. Tapping or clicking the Online 
Pictures button opens the Insert Pictures dialog box. The Insert Pictures dialog box 
allows you to search for clip art by using descriptive keywords. Clips have one or more 
keywords associated with various entities, activities, labels, and emotions.

PowerPoint Chapter 1
Creating and Editing a Presentation with Pictures   PowerPoint Chapter 1   PPT 31
How can you design a title slide that holds your audience’s attention?
Develop a slide that reflects the content of your presentation but does so in a thought-provoking way. A title, at the very least, 
should prepare your audience for the material they are about to see and hear. Look for ways to focus attention on your theme 
and the method in which you plan to present this theme. A unique photograph or graphic can help generate interest. You may 
decide to introduce your topic with a startling fact, a rhetorical question, or a quotation. The device you choose depends upon 
your audience, the occasion, and the presentation’s purpose.

Slide 1 uses the Title Slide layout, which has two placeholders for text but none for graphical content. You 
desire to place a graphic on Slide 1. Why? It is likely that your viewers will see an image on this slide before they read 
any text, so you want to include a photo to create interest in the presentation and introduce your audience to the topic. For 
this presentation, you will locate a photo of a person holding a water bottle and then insert this photo in this slide. 
Later in this chapter, you will resize and position the photo in an appropriate location. The following steps add a 
photo to Slide 1.

Resizing Photos and Illustrations
Sometimes it is necessary to change the size of photos and illustrations. Resizing 
includes enlarging or reducing the size of a graphic. You can resize these images 
using a variety of techniques. One method involves changing the size of a picture 
by specifying exact dimensions in a dialog box. Another method involves sliding or 
dragging one of the graphic’s sizing handles to the desired location. A selected graphic 
appears surrounded by a selection rectangle, which has small squares and circles, 
called sizing handles or move handles, at each corner and middle location.

Q&A
To Proportionally Resize Pictures
1 insert presentation slides | 2 enter text | 3 format text | 4 insert graphical elements
5 size & position | 6 enhance slide show | 7 display & print slides
Why? On Slides 1, 2, and 3, the photo and illustration sizes are either too small or too large to display aesthetically 
on the slides. The photo and illustration on Slides 1 and 3 are too small, and the photo on Slide 2 is too large. The photo 
on Slide 1 is of a person, so it generally is important to maintain the proportions. To change the size of a photo 
and keep the width and height in proportion to each other, drag the corner sizing handles to view how the image 
will look on the slide. Using these corner handles maintains the graphic’s original proportions. If, however, the 
proportions do not need to be maintained, as with the water bottle on Slide 2, drag the square sizing handles 
to alter the proportions so that the graphic’s height and width become larger or smaller. The following steps 
proportionally increase the size of the Slide 1 photo using a corner sizing handle.
2
•	Drag the sizing handle diagonally 
toward the upper-right corner 
of the slide until the upper-right 
sizing handle or the crosshair 
is positioned approximately as 
shown in Figure 1 – 53.
What if the illustration is not the 
same size as the one shown in 
Figure 1 – 53?
Repeat Steps 1 and 2.

Why? The height of the water bottle photo in Slide 2 extends from the top to the bottom of the slide. The width, 
however, will cover some of the text when the photo is positioned on the right side of the slide. The width of this photo 
can be decreased slightly without negatively distorting the original image. You can decrease the width of a photo 
by sliding or dragging one of the square sizing handles on the sides of the image. The following steps resize the 
width of the water bottle photo using a sizing handle along the side of the image.

5 size & position | 6 enhance slide show | 7 display & print slides
Why? After you insert a photo or an illustration on a slide, you might want to reposition it. The female athlete photo 
on Slide 1 could be moved to the left side of the slide, the water bottle on Slide 2 could be moved to the right side of the 
slide, and the illustration on Slide 3 could be positioned in the center of the slide. PowerPoint displays Smart Guides 
automatically when a photo, illustration, shape, or other object is close to lining up with another slide element. 
For example, a Smart Guide will display to help you align the right or left edge of a picture in relation to a 
text placeholder or to another picture. The following steps move the photos on Slides 1 and 2 and center the 
illustration on Slide 3.

Q&A
Ending a Slide Show with a Closing Slide
All the text for the slides in the Healthy Hydration slide show has been entered. This 
presentation thus far consists of a title slide, one text slide with a multilevel bulleted 
list, a third slide for a photo, and a fourth slide with a Comparison layout. A closing 
slide that resembles the title slide is the final slide to create.
What factors should you consider when developing a closing slide for the presentation?
After the last slide appears during a slide show, the default PowerPoint setting is to end the presentation with a black slide. 
This black slide appears only when the slide show is running and concludes the slide show, so your audience never sees the 
PowerPoint window. It is a good idea, however, to end your presentation with a final closing slide to display at the end of the 
presentation. This slide ends the presentation gracefully and should be an exact copy, or a very similar copy, of your title slide. 
The audience will recognize that the presentation is drawing to a close when this slide appears. It can remain on the screen 
when the audience asks questions, approaches the speaker for further information, or exits the room.

The athlete photo is too wide and is covering some of the text on the slide. What should I do?
Changing the width of a photo showing a person generally is not advisable because the altered proportions 
make the person appear tall and thin or short and overweight. In this case, move the photo to the left so that it is 
hanging slightly off the side of the slide, as shown in Figure1 – 61.

Why? When two slides contain similar information and have the same format, duplicating one slide and then 
making minor modifications to the new slide saves time and increases consistency.
Slide 5 will have the same layout and design as Slide 1. The most expedient method of creating this slide is 
to copy Slide 1 and then make minor modifications to the new slide. The following steps duplicate the title slide.

slide needs to display at the end of the presentation directly after the final title and content slide. Why? It is a 
closing slide that reinforces the concept presented in Slide 1 and indicates to your audiences that your presentation is ending.
Changing slide order is an easy process and is best performed in the Thumbnail pane. When you tap or 
click the thumbnail and begin to drag it to a new location, the remaining thumbnails realign to show the new 
sequence. When you release, the slide drops into the desired location. Hence, this process of sliding or dragging 
and then dropping the thumbnail in a new location is called drag and drop. You can use the drag-and-drop 
method to move any selected item, including text and graphics. The following step moves the new Slide 2 to the 
end of the presentation so that it becomes a closing slide.
1
•	With Slide 2 selected, drag the 
Slide 2 slide thumbnail below the 
last slide in the Thumbnail pane 
(Figure 1 – 64).

Making Changes to Slide Text Content
After creating slides in a presentation, you may find that you want to make changes 
to the text. Changes may be required because a slide contains an error, the scope of 
the presentation shifts, or the style is inconsistent. This section explains the types of 
changes that commonly occur when creating a presentation.
You generally make three types of changes to text in a presentation: additions, 
replacements, and deletions.
•	Additions are necessary when you omit text from a slide and need to add it later. 
You may need to insert text in the form of a sentence, word, or single character. 
For example, you may want to add the presenter’s middle name on the title slide.
•	Replacements are needed when you want to revise the text in a presentation. For 
example, you may want to substitute the word, their, for the word, there.
•	Deletions are required when text on a slide is incorrect or no longer is relevant to the 
presentation. For example, a slide may look cluttered. Therefore, you may want to 
remove one of the bulleted paragraphs to add more space.
Editing text in PowerPoint basically is the same as editing text in a word 
processing program. The following sections illustrate the most common changes made 
to text in a presentation.

Wrapping Text 
around a Photo
PowerPoint 2013 does 
not allow you to wrap text 
around a picture or other 
graphics, such as tables, 
shapes, and charts. This 
feature, however, is available 
in Word 2013.

Replacing Text in an Existing Slide
When you need to correct a word or phrase, you can replace the text by selecting 
the text to be replaced and then typing the new text. As soon as you press any key on 
the keyboard, the selected text is deleted and the new text is displayed.
PowerPoint inserts text to the left of the insertion point. The text to the 
right of the insertion point moves to the right (and shifts downward if necessary) to 
accommodate the added text.
Deleting Text
You can delete text using one of many methods. One is to use the backspace 
key to remove text just typed. The second is to position the insertion point to the 
left of the text you want to delete and then press the delete key. The third method 
is to drag through the text you want to delete and then tap or click the Cut button on 
the mini toolbar, press delete or backspace key, or press ctrl + x. Use the third 
method when deleting large sections of text.
To Delete Text in a Placeholder

Why? To keep the ending slide clean and simple, you want to delete a few words in the slide title and subtitle 
text. The following steps change Healthy Hydration to Be Healthy and then change Drinking Water While 
Exercising to Drink Water.
1
•	With Slide 5 selected, position the pointer immediately to the right of the last character of the text to be selected 
in the title text placeholder (in this case, the n in the word, Hydration).
•	Drag the pointer through the first character of the text to be selected (in this case, the space after the word, Healthy) 
(Figure 1 – 65).
I am having difficulty selecting the required text. Can I drag from left to right or right to left?
Yes. You may need several attempts to select the correct characters.
Could I also have selected the word, Hydration, by double-tapping or double-clicking it?
Yes. Either method works to select a word.

Adding a Transition
PowerPoint includes a wide variety of visual and sound effects that can be applied to text 
or content. A slide transition is a special effect used to progress from one slide to the 
next in a slide show. You can control the speed of the transition effect and add a sound.
To Add a Transition between Slides

Why? Transitions add interest when you advance the slides in a presentation and make a slide show presentation look 
professional. In this presentation, you apply the Switch transition in the Exciting category to all slides and change 
the transition speed from 1.25 seconds to 2 seconds. The following steps apply this transition to the presentation.

Document Properties
PowerPoint helps you organize and identify your files by using document 
properties, which are the details about a file such as the project author, title, and subject. 
For example, a class name or presentation topic can describe the file’s purpose or content.
Why would you want to assign document properties to a presentation?
Document properties are valuable for a variety of reasons:
•	Users can save time locating a particular file because they can view a file’s document properties without opening the 
presentation.
•	By creating consistent properties for files having similar content, users can better organize their presentations.
•	Some organizations require PowerPoint users to add document properties so that other employees can view details about 
these files.
CONSIDER THIS
The more common document properties are standard and automatically updated 
properties. Standard properties are associated with all Microsoft Office files and 
include author, title, and subject. Automatically updated properties include file system 
properties, such as the date you create or change a file, and statistics, such as the file size.
To Change Document Properties
To change document properties, you would follow these steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view and then, if necessary, 
tap or click the Info tab in the Backstage view to display the Info gallery.
2.	 If the property you wish to change is displayed in the Properties list in the right 
pane of the Info gallery, try to tap or click to the right of the property. If a box 
appears to the right of the property, type the text for the property in the box, and 
then tap or click the Back button in the upper-left corner of the Backstage view to 
return to the PowerPoint window. Skip the remaining steps.
3.	 If the property you wish to change is not displayed in the Properties list in the right 
pane of the Info gallery or you cannot change it in the Info gallery, tap or click the 
Properties button in the right pane to display the Properties menu, and then tap 
or click ‘Show Document Panel’ on the Properties menu to close the Backstage 
view and display the Document Information Panel in the PowerPoint presentation 
window.
Why are some of the document properties in my Document Information Panel already 
filled in?
The person who installed Office 2013 on your computer or network may have set or 
customized the properties.
4.	 Type the desired text in the appropriate property boxes.
What if the property I want to change is not displayed in the Document Information 
Panel?
Tap or click the Document Properties button in the Document Information Panel and 
then tap or click Advanced Properties on the menu to display the Properties dialog box. 
If necessary, tap or click the Summary tab (Properties dialog box) to display the Summary 
sheet, fill in the appropriate boxes, and then tap or click the OK button.
5.	 Tap or click the ‘Close the Document Information Panel’ button at the right edge 
of the Document Information Panel so that the panel no longer appears in the 
PowerPoint presentation window.

Why? You run a presentation in for your audience so they can see the slides in their entirety and view any transitions 
or other effects added to the slides. When making a presentation, you use Slide Show view. You can start Slide 
Show view from Normal view or Slide Sorter view. Slide Show view begins when you tap or click the Start From 
Beginning button or the Slide Show button. The following steps start Slide Show view starting with Slide 1.

•	If you are using a touch screen, proceed to Step 2. If you are using a mouse, point to the Start From Beginning 
button (Figure 1 – 74).
What would have displayed if I had tapped or clicked the Slide Show button instead of the Start From Beginning button?
When you tap or click the Slide Show button to start the presentation, PowerPoint begins the show with the 
currently displayed slide, which in this case is Slide 5. Only Slide 5 would display during the slide show.

The Start From Beginning button, located in the Quick Access Toolbar, allows you 
to show a presentation using a computer. As the name implies, the first slide to be 
displayed always will be Slide 1. You also can run a presentation starting with the 
slide currently displaying when you tap or click the Slide Show button on the status 
bar. In either case, PowerPoint displays the slides on the full screen without any of 
the PowerPoint window objects, such as the ribbon. The full-screen slide hides the 
toolbars, menus, and other PowerPoint window elements.

What is the best method for distributing a presentation?
The traditional method of distributing a presentation uses a printer to produce a hard copy. A hard copy or 
printout is information that exists on a physical medium such as paper. Hard copies can be useful for the 
following reasons:
•	Some people prefer proofreading a hard copy of a presentation rather than viewing it on the screen to check 
for errors and readability.
•	Hard copies can serve as a backup reference if your storage medium is lost or becomes corrupted and you 
need to recreate the presentation.
Instead of distributing a hard copy of a presentation, users can distribute the presentation as an electronic 
image that mirrors the original presentation’s appearance. The electronic image of the presentation can be sent 
as an email attachment, posted on a website, or copied to a portable storage medium such as a USB flash drive. 
Two popular electronic image formats, sometimes called fixed formats, are PDF by Adobe Systems and XPS by 
Microsoft. In PowerPoint, you can create electronic image files through the Save As dialog box and the Export, 
Share, and Print tabs in the Backstage view. Electronic images of presentations, such as PDF and XPS, can be 
useful for the following reasons:
•	Users can view electronic images of presentations without the software that created the original presentation 
(e.g., PowerPoint). Specifically, to view a PDF file, you use a program called Adobe Reader, which can be 
downloaded free from Adobe’s website. Similarly, to view an XPS file, you use a program called XPS Viewer, 
which is included in the latest versions of Windows and Internet Explorer.
•	Sending electronic presentations saves paper and printer supplies. Society encourages users to contribute to 
green computing, which involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste generated 
when using computers, mobile devices, and related technologies.
CONSIDER THIS
To Print a Presentation

With the completed presentation saved, you may want to print it. Why? You could distribute a handout of the 
slides to your audience members, or you might want to keep a printed copy as a backup in the event you experience technical 
difficulties before or during your speech. You, therefore, will print a hard copy on a printer. The following steps print a 
hard copy of the contents of the saved Keeping Hydrated presentation.
Other Ways
1.	 Press page down to advance one slide 
at a time, or press page up to go back

Printing a Presentation
After creating a presentation, you may want to print it. Printing a presentation enables 
you to distribute it to others in a form that can be read or viewed but typically not 
edited. It is a good practice to save a presentation before printing it, in the event you 
experience difficulties printing.

To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of the 
account from the Accounts gallery in the Backstage view before exiting PowerPoint. 
Signing out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can 
access SkyDrive files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following 
steps sign out of a Microsoft account from PowerPoint. For a detailed example of 
the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.
	1	
If you wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open 
the Backstage view and then tap or click the Account tab to display the Account gallery.
	2	
Tap or click the Sign out link, which displays the Remove Account dialog box. If a Can’t 
remove Windows accounts dialog box appears instead of the Remove Account dialog 
box, click the OK button and skip the remaining steps.
Why does a Can’t remove Windows accounts dialog box appear?
If you signed in to Windows using your Microsoft account, then you also must sign out 
from Windows, rather than signing out from within PowerPoint. When you are finished 
using Windows, be sure to sign out at that time. 
	3	
Tap or click the Yes button (Remove Account dialog box) to sign out of your Microsoft 
account on this computer.
Should I sign out of Windows after signing out of my Microsoft account?
When you are finished using the computer, you should sign out of your account for 
maximum security.

 Consider This: Your Turn
Apply your creative thinking and problem-solving skills to design and  
implement a solution.
1. Design and Create a Presentation about Mars Exploration
Personal
Part 1:  Your astronomy class is studying the solar system, and you have been assigned the topic 
of the Mars Curiosity rover and its exploration of that planet. You have learned that the rover was 
launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on November 26, 2011, and landed in the Gale Crater 
on Mars on August 6, 2012. The mission was scheduled to last two years and had the major goal 
of assessing whether Mars was or is capable of supporting life. The Curiosity rover is the size of 
a car and has a MastCam equipped with two camera systems to take photos of the landscape as it 
maneuvers around the rocky surface. The rover also can scoop up samples of the Martian soil, fire a 
laser at rocks as far away as nine feet (2.7 meters), and make weather station readings. Use the con-
cepts and techniques you learned in the chapter to create a PowerPoint presentation with a suitable 
theme, a title slide, and three text slides with bulleted lists. Add pictures from Office.com and apply 
a transition. Submit your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: what theme 
to use, where to place text, how to format the text (font, font size, paragraph alignment, bulleted para-
graphs, italics, bold, color). You also decided which graphical images to use, where to position the 
graphical images, if a closing slide would be useful, and which transition would be most effective. What 
was the rationale behind each of these decisions? When you proofed the document, what further revi-
sions did you make and why? Where would you recommend showing this slide show?

local hardware store. The chief has asked you to prepare a slide show promoting the event, which 
will be held from noon to 5 p.m. A wide variety of demonstrations and informational booths 
will be present. They include: firefighters from your community’s fire department, who will 
discuss home emergency planning, proper car seat installation, and fire extinguisher use; a local 
insurance agent, who will distribute tote bags filled with materials regarding adequate home 
and rental insurance coverage and also a nine-volt battery for a smoke alarm; and a children’s 
workshop, where participants under 10 years of age can build a picture frame. Use the concepts 
and techniques presented in this chapter to develop and format this slide show with at least 
four slides with bulleted lists. Add pictures from Office.com and apply a transition. Submit your 
assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: what 
theme to use, where to place text, how to format the text (font, font size, paragraph alignment, bul-
leted paragraphs, italics, bold, color). You also decided which graphical images to use, where to po-
sition the graphical images, if a closing slide would be useful, and which transition would be most 
effective. What was the rationale behind each of these decisions? When you proofed the document, 
what further revisions did you make and why? Where would you recommend showing this slide 
show?
3. Design and Create a Presentation about Commemorative Postage Stamps
Research and Collaboration
Part 1:  Stamp collecting is one of the world’s more popular indoor hobbies. Collectors often seek 
postage stamps pertaining to a particular interest, such as birds, flowers, famous people, or ships. 
Have each member of your team gather information on these topics: stamp collecting equipment, 
popular commemorative stamps issued, current commemorative stamps for sale at your local post 
office, and rare stamps. After coordinating these facts, use the concepts and techniques presented 
in this chapter to prepare a presentation with a minimum of four slides that explore the subject of 
stamp collection. Select a suitable theme and include a title slide, bulleted lists, and a closing slide. 
Add pictures from Office.com and apply a transition. Submit your assignment in the format speci-
fied by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: what 
theme to use, where to place text, how to format the text (font, font size, paragraph alignment, 
bulleted paragraphs, italics, bold, color). You also decided which graphical images to use, where 
to position the graphical images, if a closing slide would be useful, and which transition would 
be most effective. What was the rationale behind each of these decisions? When you proofed the 
document, what further revisions did you make and why? Where would you recommend showing 
this slide show?

Introduction
In our visually oriented culture, audience members enjoy viewing effective graphics. 
Whether reading a document or viewing a PowerPoint presentation, people 
increasingly want to see photographs, artwork, graphics, and a variety of typefaces. 
Researchers have known for decades that documents with visual elements are more 
effective than those that consist of only text because the illustrations motivate 
audiences to study the material. People remember at least one-third more information 
when the document they are seeing or reading contains visual elements. These 
graphics help clarify and emphasize details, so they appeal to audience members with 
differing backgrounds, reading levels, attention spans, and motivations.
Project — Presentation with Pictures,  
Shapes, and WordArt
The project in this chapter focuses on helping families plan for emergencies. Children 
need to prepare for the unexpected by collecting supplies to make an emergency 
supply kit, developing a communication plan, and realizing the need to be ready 
for any unexpected situation that may arise. The presentation shown in Figure 2 – 1 
follows graphical guidelines and has a variety of illustrations and visual elements 
that are colorful and appealing to children. For example, the pictures have particular 
shapes and effects. The enhanced type has a style that blends well with the formatted 
background and illustrations. Pictures and type are formatted using picture styles 
and WordArt, which give the presentation a professional look. You plan to present 
the material during community safety open houses at fire stations and local hardware 
stores, so you want to add notes explaining concepts you will be discussing during the 
meeting.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the slides shown in Figure 2 – 1 on 
the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform 
as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 download a theme and select slides for the presentation.
2.	 insert and format pictures for the slides.
3.	 insert and format shapes on one slide.
4.	 insert and format wordart by changing the shape, fill, and outline.
5.	 format slide backgrounds with a gradient, texture, and picture fill.
6.	 review and revise slides by finding a synonym and checking spelling.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity; blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 5 FORMAT SLIDE BACKGROUNDS activity.
1 download & select slides | 2 insert & format pictures | 3 insert & format shapes
4 insert & format wordart | 5 format slide backgrounds | 6 review & revise slides
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter.
To Run PowerPoint
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the search box to run PowerPoint based on a typical installation. You may need to 
ask your instructor how to run PowerPoint on your computer. For a detailed example 
of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter.

Downloading a Theme and Editing Slides
In Chapter 1, you selected a theme and then typed the content for the title and text 
slides. In this chapter, you will type the slide content for the title and text slides, select 
a background, insert and format pictures and shapes, and then insert and format 
WordArt. To begin creating the four slides in this presentation, you will download a 
theme, delete unneeded slides in this downloaded presentation, and then enter text in 
three of the four slides.
To Search for and Download  
an Online Theme
PowerPoint displays many themes that are varied and appealing and give you an excellent start at 
designing a presentation. At times, however, you may have a specific topic and design concept and could use 
some assistance in starting to develop the presentation. Microsoft offers hundreds of predesigned themes and 
templates that could provide you with an excellent starting point. Why? You can search for one of these ready-made 
presentations, or you can browse one of the predefined categories, such as business, medical, education, and nature. The 
themes and templates can save you time and help you develop content. The following steps search for a theme that has 
an educational concept and is oriented toward children.

To Create a Title Slide
Recall from Chapter 1 that the title slide introduces the presentation to the 
audience. In addition to introducing the presentation, this project uses the title slide 
to capture the audience’s attention by using title text and an illustration. Why? The 
presentation focuses on families and their need to work together to develop an emergency plan. 
The illustration of a fire truck and firefighter help introduce the concept. The following steps 
rearrange Slide 1 and Slide 2 and then create the slide show’s title slide.
	1	
Move Slide 2 in the Thumbnail pane above Slide 1 so that it becomes the first slide in 
the deck.
	2	
Type   Prepare   as the first text paragraph in the title text placeholder.
	3	
Press the enter key and then type   for the Unexpected   as the second 
paragraph in the title text placeholder.
	4	
Tap or click the subtitle text placeholder and then type   Plan for a Disaster   
as the subtitle text (Figure 2 – 10).

To Create the First Text Slide
The first text slide you create in Chapter 2 emphasizes the need to make an 
emergency supply kit that contains supplies and other necessities for survival. The 
following steps create the Slide 2 text slide using the Picture with Caption layout.
	1

To Save a Presentation
You have performed many tasks while creating this presentation and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the presentation 
on your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation.
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your 
files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains a PowerPoint folder 
BTW
The Ribbon and 
Screen Resolution
PowerPoint may change 
how the groups and buttons 
within the groups appear on 
the ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than 
1366 3 768.

(for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the presentation in the PowerPoint 
folder in the CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of 
the procedure for saving a file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the 
Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book. 
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, which depending on 
settings, will display either the Save As gallery in the Backstage view or the Save As 
dialog box.
	2	
To save on a hard disk or other storage media on your computer, proceed to Step 2a. 
To save on SkyDrive, proceed to Step 2b. 
	2a	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on storage media on 
your computer, tap or click Computer in the left pane, if necessary, to display options 
in the right pane related to saving on your computer. If your screen already displays 
the Save As dialog box, proceed to Step 3.
	2b	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on SkyDrive, tap or click 
SkyDrive in the left pane to display SkyDrive saving options or a Sign In button. If your 
screen displays a Sign In button, tap or click it and then sign in to SkyDrive.
	3	
Tap or click the Browse button in the right pane to display the Save As dialog box 
associated with the selected save location (i.e., Computer or SkyDrive).
	4	
Type   Emergency Plan   in the File name box to change the file name. Do not 
press the enter key after typing the file name because you do not want to close the 
dialog box at this time.
	5	
Navigate to the desired save location (in this case, the PowerPoint folder in the CIS 
101 folder [or your class folder] on your computer or SkyDrive).
	6	
Tap or click the Save button (Save As dialog box) to save the presentation in the 
selected folder on the selected save location with the entered file name.
Inserting and Formatting Pictures  
in a Presentation
With the text entered in three of the four slides, the next step is to insert pictures into 
Slides 1 and 2 and then format the pictures. These graphical images draw the viewers’ 
eyes to the slides and help them retain the information presented.
In the following pages, you will perform these tasks:
1.	 Insert the illustration into Slide 1.
2.	 Resize the illustration.
3.	 Change the Slide 2 photo.
4.	 Change the photo’s brightness and contrast.
5.	 Change the photo’s style and effect.
6.	 Add and modify the photo’s border.
To Insert a Picture into a Slide  
without a Content Placeholder
In Chapter 1, you inserted photos and an illustration into slides without a content placeholder. Why? 
Some slide layouts do not have a content placeholder, so you must insert and move the pictures to appropriate locations 
on the slide. The illustration for Slide 1 is available on the Data Files for Students. Visit www.cengage.com/
ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for information about accessing the

Organizing Files  
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 101, 
a good practice would 
be to save all PowerPoint 
files in a PowerPoint folder 
in a CIS 101 folder. For a 
discussion of folders and 
detailed examples of creating 
folders, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the

To Correct a Picture
A photo’s color intensity can be modified by changing the brightness and contrast. Brightness determines 
the overall lightness or darkness of the entire image, whereas contrast is the difference between the darkest 
and lightest areas of the image. The brightness and contrast are changed in predefined percentage increments. 
The following step increases the brightness and decreases the contrast. Why? Altering the photo’s brightness will 
coordinate with the vibrant colors in the slide design while decreasing the contrast will soften the image. It is important for 
the audience to recognize the first aid kit but not focus on each individual supply in the kit.

Q&A
To Apply a Picture Style
A style is a named group of formatting characteristics. The picture on Slide 2 emphasizes the concept of 
assembling a supply kit, and you can increase its visual appeal by applying a style. Why? PowerPoint provides more 
than 25 picture styles that enable you easily to change a picture’s look to a more visually appealing style, including a variety 
of shapes, angles, borders, and reflections. You want to use a style that applies a shadow to the First Aid Kit photo. 
The following steps apply a picture style to the Slide 2 photo.

To Add a Picture Border
The next step is to add a border to the Slide 2 picture. Why? Some picture styles do not have a border; others, 
such as the Center Shadow Rectangle style you applied to this picture, do have this edging. This border is small, and you 
want a larger edge around the photo to draw attention to the graphic. The following steps add a border to the First Aid 
Kit picture.

PPT 90   PowerPoint Chapter 2   Enhancing a Presentation with Pictures, Shapes, and WordArt
To Apply Picture Effects
Why? The picture effect allows you to further customize a picture. PowerPoint provides a variety of picture 
effects, including shadows, reflections, glow, soft edges, bevel, and 3-D rotation. The difference between the 
effects and the styles is that each effect has several options, providing you with more control over the exact look 
of the image.
In this presentation, the photo on Slide 2 has a blue glow effect and a bevel applied to its edges. The 
following steps apply picture effects to the selected picture.

Inserting and Formatting a Shape
One method of getting the audience’s attention and reinforcing the major concepts 
being presented is to have graphical elements on the title slide. PowerPoint provides a 
wide variety of predefined shapes that can add visual interest to a slide. Shape elements 
include lines, basic geometrical shapes, arrows, equation shapes, flowchart symbols, 
stars, banners, and callouts. After adding a shape to a slide, you can change its default 
characteristics by adding text, bullets, numbers, and styles. You also can combine 
multiple shapes to create a more complex graphic.
Slide 3 in this presentation is enhanced in a variety of ways. First, a scroll and a 
plus shape are inserted on Slide 4. Then, a rectangle is added and copied, and text is 
added to each rectangle and then formatted.

Formatting text in a shape follows the same techniques as formatting text in a placeholder. You can change 
font, font color and size, and alignment. You later will add contact information to the scroll, but now you want to 
apply a shape style to the scroll. Why? The style will give depth to the object so that it appears three-dimensional. The 
Quick Styles gallery has a variety of styles that change depending upon the theme applied to the presentation. 
The following steps apply a style to the Vertical Scroll shape.

two shapes and the vertical Smart Guide is displayed between the two shapes, as shown 
in Figure 2 – 33, and then release.

The default theme font is Segoe Print. To draw more attention to text in the shapes and to help 
differentiate these slide elements from the title text, you want to change the font to Courier New. Why? This font 
resembles the letters that typewriters produced. To change the font, you must select the letters you want to format. 
In Chapter 1, you selected a paragraph and then formatted the characters, and you follow the same procedure to 
change the font. The following steps change the text font in the shape.

When developing a communication plan, family members need to determine two meeting places: one near 
the house and a second outside the neighborhood. You already have created the shape stating the first meeting 
location. You now need to create a second shape with the instruction to decide where to meet away from the 
house. The following steps copy the Rectangle shape and then move the copy. Why? You could repeat all the steps 
you performed to create the first rectangle, but it is much more efficient to duplicate the shape and then edit the text.

Inserting and Formatting WordArt
One method of adding appealing visual elements to a presentation is by using 
WordArt styles. This feature is found in other Microsoft Office applications, including 
Word and Excel. This gallery of decorative effects allows you to type new text or 
convert existing text to WordArt. You then can add elements such as fills, outlines, and 
effects.
WordArt fill in the interior of a letter can consist of a solid color, texture, 
picture, or gradient. The WordArt outline is the exterior border surrounding each 
letter or symbol. PowerPoint allows you to change the outline color, weight, and style. 
You also can add an effect, which helps add emphasis or depth to the characters. Some 
effects are shadows, reflections, glows, bevels, and 3-D rotations.

Having a communication plan is of utmost importance to prepare for the unexpected. You want to 
emphasize this concept, and the last slide in the presentation is an excellent location to urge your audience to 
take action. Why? Audience members remember the first and last things they see and hear. You quickly can add a visual 
element to the slide by selecting a WordArt style from the WordArt Styles gallery and then applying it to some 
text. The following steps insert WordArt.

The letters in the WordArt style applied have an outline around the edges. You can increase the width of 
the lines. Why? The thicker line will emphasize this characteristic and add another visual element. As with fonts, lines 
also are measured in point size, and PowerPoint gives you the option to change the line weight, or thickness, 
starting with ¼ point (pt) and increasing in one-fourth-point increments. Other outline options include 
modifying the color and the line style, such as changing to dots or dashes or a combination of dots and dashes.

Formatting Slide Backgrounds
A slide’s background is an integral part of a presentation because it can generate 
audience interest. Every slide can have the same background, or different backgrounds 
can be used in a presentation. This background is considered fill, which is the content 
that makes up the interior of a shape, line, or character. Four fills are available: solid, 
gradient, picture or texture, and pattern. Solid fill is one color used throughout the 
entire slide. Gradient fill is one color shade gradually progressing to another shade of 
the same color or one color progressing to another color. Picture or texture fill uses 
a specific file or an image that simulates a material, such as cork, granite, marble, or 
canvas. Pattern fill adds designs, such as dots or diamonds, that repeat in rows across 
the slide.
Once you add a fill, you can adjust its appearance. For example, you can adjust 
its transparency, which allows you to see through the background, so that any text 
on the slide is visible. You also can select a color that is part of the theme or a custom 
color. You can use offsets, another background feature, to move the background away 
from the slide borders in varying distances by percentage. Tiling options repeat the 
background image many times vertically and horizontally on the slide; the smaller the 
tiling percentage, the greater the number of times the image is repeated.

The Emergency Collage illustration on Slide 4 has vibrant colors and conflicts with the WordArt. One 
method of reducing this richness is to change the transparency. The Transparency slider indicates the amount 
of opaqueness. The default setting is 0, which is fully opaque. The opposite extreme is 100%, which is fully 
transparent. To change the transparency, you can move the Transparency slider or enter a number in the box 
next to the slider. The following step adjusts the transparency of the background picture to 60%.

The Bouquet texture on Slide 3 may detract from the three shapes because it does not offer sufficient

Although you selected Bouquet texture fill on Slide 3 and changed the transparency, you decide that another 
type of background may be more suitable for your presentation. Why? The Bouquet texture is very colorful and may detract 
from the messages presented in the symbols. For each theme, PowerPoint provides 30 preset gradient fills with five designs 
for each of the six major theme colors. Each fill has one dark color shade that gradually lightens to either another 
shade of the same color or another color. The following steps replace the texture fill on Slide 3 to a preset gradient fill.

Reviewing and Revising Individual Slides
The text, pictures, and shapes for all slides in the Emergency Plan presentation have 
been entered. Once you complete a slide show, you might decide to change elements. 
PowerPoint provides several tools to assist you with making changes. They include 
finding and replacing text, inserting a synonym, and checking spelling. The following 
pages discuss these tools.
Replace Dialog Box
At times, you might want to change all occurrences of a word or phrase to 
another word or phrase. For example, an instructor may have one slide show to 
accompany a lecture for several introductory classes, and he wants to update slides with 
the particular class name and section that appear on several slides. He manually could 
change the characters, but PowerPoint includes an efficient method of replacing one 
word with another. The Find and Replace feature automatically locates specific text 
and then replaces it with desired text.
In some cases, you may want to replace only certain occurrences of a word or 
phrase, not all of them. To instruct PowerPoint to confirm each change, click the 
Find Next button in the Replace dialog box instead of the Replace All button. When 
PowerPoint locates an occurrence of the text, it pauses and waits for you to click either 
the Replace button or the Find Next button. Clicking the Replace button changes the 
text; clicking the Find Next button instructs PowerPoint to disregard that particular 
instance and look for the next occurrence of the Find what text.
To Find and Replace Text

4 insert & format wordart | 5 format slide backgrounds | 6 review & revise slides
While reviewing your slides, you realize that the word, Emergency, would be a better choice than the 
word, Disaster. To change these words throughout a presentation, you could view each slide, look for the word, 
Disaster, delete the word, and then type the replacement word, Emergency. A more efficient and effective 
method of performing this action is to use PowerPoint’s Find and Replace feature, which automatically locates 
each occurrence of a word or phrase and then replaces it with specified text. The word, Disaster, displays twice 
in the presentation. The following steps use Find and Replace to replace all occurrences of the words, a Disaster, 
with the words, an Emergency.

•	Display the HOME tab and then 
tap or click the Replace button 
(HOME tab | Editing group) to 
display the Replace dialog box.
•	Type   a Disaster   in the Find 
what box (Replace dialog box).

and then type   an Emergency

To Find and Insert a Synonym

4 insert & format wordart | 5 format slide backgrounds | 6 review & revise slides
When reviewing your slide show, you may decide that a particular word does not express the exact usage 
you intended or that you used the same word on multiple slides. In these cases, you could find a synonym, or 
word similar in meaning, to replace the inappropriate or duplicate word. PowerPoint provides a thesaurus, 
which is a list of synonyms and antonyms, to help you find a replacement word.
In this project, you want to find a synonym to replace the words, stay alive, on Slide 2. The following steps 
locate an appropriate synonym and replace the word.
1
•	Display Slide 2 and then select the 
words, stay alive.
•	If you are using a mouse, right-
click to display a shortcut menu 
related to the words you right-
clicked. Then, point to Synonyms 
on the shortcut menu to display a 
list of synonyms for these words 
(Figure 2 – 70).
If I want to locate a synonym for 
only one word, do I need to select it?
No. You simply need to place the 
insertion point in the word and 
then press and hold or right-click 
to display the shortcut menu.
•	If you are using a touch screen, 
tap the Thesaurus button (REVIEW 
Q&A
tab | Proofing group) to display the Thesaurus task pane for the selected words. Then, in  
the task pane, tap the arrow next to the word survive if necessary to display a shortcut menu.

Finding and Replacing Text
When finding and replacing text, you do 
not need to display the slide that contains 
the word for which you are searching. You 
can perform this action when any slide is 
displayed. To see the results of the search and 
replace action, however, you need to display

Checking Spelling
After you create a presentation, you should check it visually for spelling errors 
and style consistency. In addition, you use PowerPoint’s Spelling tool to identify 
possible misspellings on the slides and in the notes. Do not rely on the spelling checker 
to catch all your mistakes. Although PowerPoint’s spelling checker is a valuable tool, it 
is not infallible. You should proofread your presentation carefully by pointing to each 
word and saying it aloud as you point to it. Be mindful of commonly misused words 
such as its and it’s, through and though, and to and too.
PowerPoint checks the entire presentation for spelling mistakes using a standard 
dictionary contained in the Microsoft Office group. This dictionary is shared with the 
other Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel. A custom dictionary is 
available if you want to add special words such as proper names, cities, and acronyms. 
When checking a presentation for spelling errors, PowerPoint opens the standard 
dictionary and the custom dictionary file, if one exists. When a word appears in the 
Spelling pane, you can perform one of several actions, as described in Table 2–1.
The standard dictionary contains commonly used English words. It does 
not, however, contain many proper names, abbreviations, technical terms, poetic 
contractions, or antiquated terms. PowerPoint treats words not found in the 
dictionaries as misspellings.
BTW
Formatting Notes 
Pane Text
You can format text in the 
Notes pane in the same 
manner you format text on 
a slide. For example, you can 
bold key words or change 
the font size and color to add 
emphasis.
BTW
Detecting Spelling 
Errors
The x in the Spell Check 
icon indicates PowerPoint 
detected a possible spelling 
error. A check mark in the 
icon indicates the entered 
text contains no spelling 
errors.

To Insert a Slide Number

PowerPoint can insert the slide number on your slides automatically to indicate where the slide is 
positioned within the presentation. The number location on the slide is determined by the presentation theme. 
You have the option to not display this slide number on the title slide. The following steps insert the slide 
number on all slides except the title slide.

then display the INSERT tab.
•	Tap or click the Slide Number

Why might I need to tap or click 
the Thumbnail pane?
If the final flagged word had been 
located in the Notes pane during 
the spell check, the insertion 
point would have been in the 
Notes pane. The page number, 
consequently, would have been 
inserted in the Notes pane instead 
of on the slide.

occurrences of the misspelled word. The misspelled word, wistle, appears only once in the presentation, so tapping 
or clicking the Change or the Change All button in this instance produces identical results.
Occasionally a correctly spelled word is flagged as a possible misspelled word. Why?
Your custom dictionary does not contain the word, so it is seen as spelled incorrectly. You can add this word to a 
custom dictionary to prevent the spelling checker from flagging it as a mistake.

Q&A
Figure 2 – 80
How can I use handouts to organize my speech?
As you develop a lengthy presentation with many visuals, handouts may help you organize your material. Print handouts with 
the maximum number of slides per page. Use scissors to cut each thumbnail and then place these miniature slide images adja-
cent to each other on a flat surface. Any type on the thumbnails will be too small to read, so the images will need to work with 
only the support of the verbal message you provide. You can rearrange these thumbnails as you organize your speech. When 
you return to your computer, you can rearrange the slides on your screen to match the order of your thumbnail printouts. Begin 
speaking the actual words you want to incorporate in the body of the talk. This process of glancing at the thumbnails and hear-
ing yourself say the key ideas of the speech is one of the best methods of organizing and preparing for the actual presentation. 
Ultimately, when you deliver your speech in front of an audience, the images on the slides or on your note cards should be suf-
ficient to remind you of the accompanying verbal message.

Design and/or create a presentation using the guidelines, concepts, and skills presented 
in this chapter. Labs 1 and 2, which increase in difficulty, require you to create solutions 
based on what you learned in the chapter; Lab 3 requires you to create a solution, which 
uses cloud and web technologies, by learning and investigating on your own from general 
guidance.
Lab 1: Creating a Presentation Inserting Photos, 
Applying Picture Styles, and Inserting Shapes
Problem:  Your creative cooking class has volunteered to manage a bake sale to raise funds for 
victims of a tornado in a neighboring town. To encourage more students to participate in the bake 
sale, you decide to put together a presentation that would run in the cafeteria. You want to show 
your audience how easy it is to make an apple pie. Create the slides shown in Figure 2 – 87.
Instructions:  Perform the following tasks:
	 1.	Create a new presentation using the Retrospect theme. Do not change the brown variant.
	 2.	On Slide 1, create a background by inserting the photo called Apple Pie from the Data Files for 
Students, as shown in Figure 2 – 87a. Change the transparency to 53%.
	 3.	Type   Homemade Apple Pie   as the Slide 1 title text. Press the enter key after the word, 
Homemade, so the text is on two lines, and then center the text. Apply the WordArt style 
Fill – Orange, Accent 2, Outline – Accent 2 (the third style in the first row). Change the text 
fill to Dark Red (the first color in the Standard Colors row), and then change the text outline 
color to Green (the sixth color in the Standard Colors row) and the text outline weight to 3 pt. 
Also, apply the Transform text Effect, Chevron Up (the first effect in the second Warp row), to 
this text. Position this WordArt, as shown in Figure 2 – 87a. Type   BAKE SALE – SATURDAY 
JANUARY 20   in the subtitle placeholder. Change the font to MV Boli, increase the font size 
to 30 point, bold this text, and then center the text, as shown in the figure.
	 4.	Create Slides 2 through 4 with the Two Content layout, Slide 5 with the Content with Caption 
layout, and Slide 6 with the Picture with Caption layout.

 Consider This: Your Turn
Apply your creative thinking and problem-solving skills to design  
and implement a solution.
1. Design and Create a Presentation about Skydiving from New Heights
Personal
Part 1:  Members of your skydiving club are discussing free-falling records of new heights reached by 
skydivers over the past years. They’ve been following the news reports about the man from Austria, 
43-year-old Felix Baumgartner, who broke a record by completing the highest skydive and traveling 
faster than the speed of sound without being in an aircraft. At a recent meeting with your fellow sky-
divers, many questions arose as to how this man was able to accomplish this, what risks were involved, 
and how long he trained for this venture. You researched facts about this record-breaking skydive 
and learned that the height he dove from (128,100 feet above Earth) was more than three times the 
cruising altitude of a passenger jet (hitting Mach 1.24 or 833.9 mph). It was the height at which wa-
ter boils. If his pressurized spacesuit had malfunctioned, it would have been disastrous: a leak in his 
spacesuit would have caused his blood to boil instantly. Half of his nine-minute descent was a free fall 
of 119,846 feet. He trained for seven years. Use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter 
to prepare a presentation with a minimum of four slides that explores this subject. Select a suitable 
theme, and include a title slide, bulleted lists, shapes, and WordArt. The presentation should contain 
photos and illustrations appropriately resized. Eight photos and illustrations are available on the Data 
Files for Students: Skydiving1, Skydiving2, Skydiving3, Skydiving4, Skydiving5, Skydiving6, Skydiv-
ing7, and Skydiving8. You can add your own digital photos or photos from Office.com if they are ap-
propriate for this topic. Apply picture styles and effects. Add a title slide and closing slide to complete 
your presentation. Format the title slide with a shape. Format the background with at least one photo 
and apply a background texture to at least one slide. Review and revise your presentation as needed. 
Submit your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: where to 
place text, how to format the text (such as font, font size, and where to use WordArt), which graphi-
cal image(s) to use, what styles and effects to apply, where to position the graphical image, how to 
format the graphical images, and which shapes to use to add interest to the presentation. What was 
the rationale behind each of these decisions? When you reviewed the document, what further revi-
sions did you make and why? Where would you recommend showing this slide show?
2. Design and Create a Presentation about Teaching Geometry  
to Elementary Students
Professional
Part 1:  You work part time for a tutoring agency. Because you are majoring in math, your boss 
asked if you would put together a teaching aid for teaching geometry to the elementary students. 
You decide to create a presentation with some basic shapes: squares, circles, and triangles. To make 
the slides appeal to your young students, you decide to use shapes and add photos and illustra-
tions. Geometry for elementary students also can cover parallel lines, intersecting lines, and how 
intersecting lines form angles. You can show them shapes such as pentagons, heptagons, and octa-
gons. They can look for shapes in their environment and draw them. You can teach them that even 
though a shape is turned upside down or rotated, it is still the same shape even if it looks different. 
Use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter to create a presentation with at least four 
slides. Select a suitable theme, include a title slide, and add WordArt. Review and revise your pre-
sentation as needed. Submit your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: where 
to place text, how to format the text (such as font, font size, and where to use WordArt), which

3. Design and Create a Presentation about Coyotes Roaming  
in Your Neighborhood
Research and Collaboration
Part 1:  Many of your neighbors are concerned about the coyotes that have been spotted in your 
neighborhood. With the help of a friend who works part time at a local wildlife refuge, you suggest 
that each of you do some research about coyotes and discuss your findings and put together a pre-
sentation to share at the next town hall meeting. Your main concern is that the coyotes are finding 
outdoor food sources such as pet food, uncovered garbage cans, and areas near homes where rodents 
may be nesting. You want to make suggestions to your neighbors about how to deter the coyotes 
from staying in your neighborhood. You ask your friend who works at the wildlife refuge to research 
the habits of coyotes. You will gather information from the local newspaper where there have been 
articles written about the coyotes and your other neighbor will talk to other people in the neigh-
bor about sightings of coyotes and possible photographs. After coordinating all the facts about the 
coyotes, use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter to prepare a presentation with a 
minimum of four slides that explores the subject of coyotes. Summarize your research findings and 
type this information in the Notes pane of each slide. Select a suitable theme, include a title slide, 
bulleted lists, shapes, and WordArt. Seven photos and illustrations are available on the Data Files 
for Students: Coyote1, Coyote2, Coyote3, Coyote4, Coyote5, Coyote6, and Coyote7. Change the 
brightness and contrast for at least one photo. Insert shapes and WordArt to enhance your presenta-
tion. Apply a transition in the Subtle area to all slides and increase the duration. Review and revise 
your presentation as needed. Submit your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: where to 
place text, how to format the text (such as font, font size, and where to use WordArt), which graphi-
cal image(s) to use, what styles and effects to apply, where to position the graphical image, what 
shapes to use to add interest to the presentation. What was the rationale behind each of these deci-
sions? When you reviewed the document, what further revisions did you make and why? Where 
would you recommend showing this slide show?

Introduction
At times, you will need to revise a PowerPoint presentation. Changes may include 
inserting and adding effects to photos, altering the colors of photos and illustrations, 
and updating visual elements displayed on a slide. Applying a different theme, changing 
fonts, and substituting graphical elements can give a slide show an entirely new look. 
Adding media, including sounds, video, and music, can enhance a presentation and 
help audience members retain the information being presented. Adding animation can 
reinforce important points and enliven a presentation.
Project — Presentation with Video, Audio,  
Animation, and Photos with Effects
The project in this chapter follows graphical guidelines and uses PowerPoint 
to create the presentation shown in Figure 3 – 1. The slides in this revised 
presentation, which discusses Watch for Motorcycles, have a variety of audio and 
visual elements. For example, the photos have artistic effects applied that soften 
the photos and help the audience focus on other elements on the slides. The car 
clip has colors that blend well with the background. The bullet list is animated 
with entrance, emphasis, and exit effects. The video has been edited to play only 
the portion with Watch for Motorcycles and has effects to add audience interest. 
Motorcycle sounds integrate with the visual elements. Overall, the slides have 
myriad media elements and effects that are exciting for your audience to watch and 
hear.

BTW
Using Media in 
Presentations
PowerPoint makes it easy 
to insert media into a 
presentation. Well-produced 
video clips add value when 
they help explain a procedure 
or show movement that 
cannot be captured in a 
photo or illustration. A sound 
can emphasize an action. 
Before you insert these files 
on a slide, however, consider 
whether they really add any 
value to your overall slide 
show. If you are inserting 
them just because you 
can, you might want to 
reconsider your decision. 
Audiences quickly tire of 
extraneous movement and 
sounds on slides, and they 
will find these media clips 
annoying. Keep in mind that 
the audience’s attention 
should focus primarily on 
the presenter; extraneous or 
inappropriate media files may 
divert their attention and, in 
turn, decrease the quality of 
the presentation.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create the slides shown in Figure 3 – 1 on 
the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform 
as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 insert and add effects to photos, including changing colors and styles.
2.	 modify placeholders on the slides by moving and changing sizes.
3.	 modify and copy an illustration to customize its appearance.
4.	 add media files to slides.
5.	 animate slide content with entrance, emphasis, and exit effects.
6.	 customize slide elements by changing a theme and variant on one slide and 
changing the theme colors.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity; blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 5 ANIMATE SLIDE CONTENT activity.
1 insert & add effects | 2 modify placeholders | 3 modify & copy illustrations
4 add media | 5 animate slide content | 6 customize slide elements
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter.
To Run PowerPoint
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the search box to run PowerPoint based on a typical installation. You may need to 
ask your instructor how to run PowerPoint on your computer. For a detailed example 
of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter.
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for a PowerPoint 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains a 
PowerPoint 2013 tile, tap or click it to run PowerPoint and then proceed to Step 5; if 
the Start screen does not contain the PowerPoint 2013 tile, proceed to the next step 
to search for the PowerPoint app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of the 
screen to display the Charms bar and then tap or click the Search charm on the Charms 
bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   PowerPoint   as the search text in the Search text box and watch the search 
results appear in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click PowerPoint 2013 in the search results to run PowerPoint.
	5	
If the PowerPoint window is not maximized, tap or click the Maximize button on its 
title bar to maximize the window.
For an introduction to 
Windows and instruc-
tion about how to 
perform basic Windows 
tasks, read the Office 
and Windows chapter 
at the beginning of 
this book, where you 
can learn how to resize 
windows, change screen 
resolution, create fold-
ers, move and rename 
files, use Windows Help, 
and much more.
One of the few differ-
ences between Win-
dows 7 and Windows 
8 occurs in the steps to 
run PowerPoint. If you 
are using Windows 7, 
click the Start button, 
type   PowerPoint   
in the ‘Search programs 
and files’ box, click 
­PowerPoint 2013, and 
then, if necessary, maxi-
mize the PowerPoint 
window. For detailed 
steps to run PowerPoint 
in Windows 7, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the begin-
ning of this book. For a 
summary of the steps, 
refer to the Quick Refer-
ence located at the back 
of this book.

Save the presentation using the file name, Watch for Motorcycles.
Inserting Photos and Adding Effects
The Watch for Motorcycles presentation consists of three slides that have some text, 
a clip art image, a formatted background, and a transition applied to all slides. You will 
insert a photo into one slide and then modify it and another photo by adding artistic 
effects and recoloring. You also will copy the clip art from Slide 2 to Slide 1 and modify 
the objects in this clip. In Chapter 2, you inserted photos, made corrections, and added 
styles and effects; the new effects you apply in this chapter will add to your repertoire 
of photo enhancements that increase interest in your presentation.
In the following pages, you will perform these tasks:
1.	 Insert the first photo into Slide 1.
2.	 Recolor the Slide 1 photo.
3.	 Add an artistic effect to the Slide 3 photo.
4.	 Send the Slide 1 photo back behind all other slide objects.
To Insert and Resize a Photo into a Slide  
without Content Placeholders
The first step is to insert a photo into Slide 1. This photo is available on the Data 
Files for Students. Visit www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions 
or contact your instructor for information about accessing the required file.
The following steps insert a photo into Slide 1.
	1	
With Slide 1 displaying, tap or click INSERT on the ribbon to display the INSERT tab 
and then tap or click the Pictures button (INSERT tab | Images group) to display the 
Insert Picture dialog box.
	2	
If necessary, navigate to the photo location (in this case, the PowerPoint folder in the 
CIS 101 folder [or your class folder]).
	3	
Tap or click Highway Motorcycle to select the file.
	4	
Tap or click the Insert button (Insert Picture dialog box) to insert the photo into 
Slide 1.
	5	
Drag the sizing handles to resize the photo so that it covers the entire slide. You can 
tap or click the Height and Width arrows (PICTURE TOOLS FORMAT tab | Size group) to 
adjust the picture size (Figure 3 – 2 on the next page).
For an introduction to 
Office and instruction 
about how to perform 
basic tasks in Office 
apps, read the Office 
and Windows chapter 
at the beginning of this 
book, where you can 
learn how to run an ap-
plication, use the ribbon, 
save a file, open a file, 
exit an application, use 
Help, and much more.
BTW
Organizing Files  
and Folders
You should organize 
and store files in folders 
so that you easily can 
find the files later. For 
example, if you are taking 
an introductory computer 
class called CIS 101, a good 
practice would be to save 
all PowerPoint files in a 
PowerPoint folder in a CIS 
101 folder. For a discussion 
of folders and detailed 
examples of creating folders, 
refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

Adjusting Photo Colors
PowerPoint allows you to adjust colors to match or add contrast to slide 
elements by coloring photos. The Color gallery has a wide variety of preset formatting 
combinations. The thumbnails in the gallery display the more common color 
saturation, color tone, and recolor adjustments. Color saturation changes the intensity 
of colors. High saturation produces vivid colors; low saturation produces gray tones. 
Color tone affects the coolness, called blue, or the warmness, called orange, of photos. 
When a digital camera does not measure the tone correctly, a color cast occurs, and, 
as a result, one color dominates the photo. Recolor effects convert the photo into a 
wide variety of hues. The more common are grayscale, which changes the color photo 
into black, white, and shades of gray, and sepia, which changes the photo colors into 
brown, gold, and yellow, reminiscent of a faded photo. You also can fine-tune the color 
adjustments by tapping or clicking the Picture Color Options and More Variations 
commands in the Color gallery.

Figure 3 – 2
To Color a Photo
The Office theme and text on Slides 1 and 2 are simple and fulfill the need to communicate the 
presentation’s safety message. The photos on Slides 1 and 3, in contrast, help set the tone of riding on an open 
road and enjoying the freedom that biking brings. You may want to add an effect to photos. Why? An effect 
adds variety to the presentation and helps enhance ordinary photos. The following steps recolor the Slide 1 photo to 
coordinate with the brown colors of a highway and barren desert landscape.
1 insert & add effects | 2 modify placeholders | 3 modify & copy illustrations
4 add media | 5 animate slide content | 6 customize slide elements 
Note: To help you locate screen 
elements that are referenced in the 
step instructions, such as buttons and 
commands, this book uses red boxes 
to point to these screen elements.

To Add an Artistic Effect to a Photo
Artists use a variety of techniques to create effects in their paintings. They can vary the amount of 
paint on their brushstroke, use fine bristles to add details, mix colors to increase or decrease intensity, and 
smooth their paints together to blend the colors. You, likewise, can add similar effects to your photos using 
PowerPoint’s built-in artistic effects. Why? The completed Slide 3 will have both the photo and a video, so applying an 
artistic effect to the photo will provide a contrast between the two images. The following steps add an artistic effect to 
the Slide 3 photo.

To Change the Stacking Order
The objects on a slide stack on top of each other, much like individual cards in a deck. To change the order 
of these objects, you use the Bring Forward and Send Backward commands. Bring Forward moves an object 
toward the top of the stack, and Send Backward moves an object underneath another object. When you tap 
or click the Bring Forward arrow, PowerPoint displays a menu with an additional command, Bring to Front, 
which moves a selected object to the top of the stack. Likewise, when you tap or click the Send Backward arrow, 
the Send to Back command moves the selected object underneath all objects on the slide. The following steps 
arrange the Slide 1 photo. Why? On this slide, the photo is on top of the placeholders, so you no longer can see the text. 
If you send the photo to the bottom of the stack on the slide, the letters will become visible.

Modifying Placeholders
You have become familiar with inserting text and graphical content in the three types 
of placeholders: title, subtitle, and content. These placeholders can be moved, resized, 
and deleted to meet desired design requirements. In addition, placeholders can be 
added to a slide when needed. After you have modified the placeholder locations, you 
can view thumbnails of all your slides simultaneously by changing views.
In the following pages, you will perform these tasks:
1.	 Resize the Slide 1 title placeholder.
2.	 Align the Slide 1 title text.
3.	 Move the Slide 1 title placeholder.
4.	 Delete the Slide 1 subtitle placeholder.
5.	 Change views.

To Align Paragraph Text
The presentation theme determines the formatting characteristics of fonts and colors. It also establishes 
paragraph formatting, including the alignment of text. Some themes center the text paragraphs between the 
left and right placeholder borders, while others left-align the paragraph so that the first character of a text 
line is near the left border or right-align the paragraph so that the last character of a text line is near the right 
border. The paragraph also can be justified so that the text is aligned to both the left and right borders. When 
PowerPoint justifies text, it adds extras spaces between the words to fill the entire line.
The words, Watch for Motorcycles, are left-aligned in the Slide 1 title placeholder. Later, you will add an 
illustration below the words, for Motorcycles, so you desire to center the paragraph. Why? Both the text and the 
picture will be centered, so the alignments complement each other. The following steps change the alignment of the 
Slide 1 title placeholder.
1 insert & add effects | 2 modify placeholders | 3 modify & copy illustrations
4 add media | 5 animate slide content | 6 customize slide elements
To Resize a Placeholder
The AutoFit button displays on the left side of the Slide 1 title placeholder because the two lines of text 
exceed the placeholder’s borders. PowerPoint attempts to reduce the font size when the text does not fit, and 
you can tap or click this button to resize the existing text in the placeholder so the spillover text will fit within 
the borders. The following step increases the Slide 1 title placeholder size. Why? The two lines of text exceed the 
placeholder’s borders, so you can resize the placeholder and fit the letters within the rectangle.

Why? If you desire to have a placeholder appear in a different area of the slide, you can move it to a new location. 
The theme layouts determine where the text and content placeholders display on the slide. The Slide 1 title 
placeholder currently displays in the upper third of the slide, but the text in this placeholder would be more 
aesthetically pleasing if it were moved to the upper-right corner of the slide. The following step moves the 
Slide 1 title placeholder.

•	Tap or click the border of the 
Slide 1 title placeholder to select it.
•	With the title placeholder border 
displaying as a solid line or fine dots, 
point to an area of the left border

sizing handles so that the pointer 
changes to a four-headed arrow.
Can I tap or click any part of the 
border to select it?
Yes. You can tap or click any of 
the four border lines.
How do I know if the placeholder 
is selected?
The selection handles are displayed.

To Add a Text Box
You occasionally may need to insert a small amount of text in an area of a slide 
where no content placeholder is located. A text box allows you to emphasize or set off 
text that you consider important for your audience to read. To add a text box to a slide, 
you would perform the following steps.
1.	 Tap or click the Text Box button (INSERT tab | Text group), click or tap the slide, 
and then drag the object to the desired location on the slide.
2.	 Click inside the text box to add or paste text.

placeholder on Slide 1 is not required for this presentation, so you can remove it. The following steps remove 
the Slide 1 subtitle placeholder.

Changing Views
You have been using Normal view to create and edit your slides. Once you 
completed your slides, you reviewed the final products by displaying each slide in 
Slide Show view, which occupies the full computer screen. You were able to view how 
the transitions, graphics, and effects will display in an actual presentation before an 
audience.
PowerPoint has other views to help review a presentation for content, 
organization, and overall appearance. Slide Sorter view allows you to look at several 
slides at one time. Reading view is similar to Slide Show view because each slide 
displays individually, but the slides do not fill the entire screen. Using this view, you 
easily can progress through the slides forward or backward with simple controls at 
the bottom of the window. Switching between Slide Sorter view, Reading view, and 
Normal view helps you review your presentation, assess whether the slides have an 
attractive design and adequate content, and make sure they are organized for the most 
impact. After reviewing the slides, you can change the view to Normal so that you may 
continue working on the presentation.
To Change Views
Why? You have made several modifications to the slides, so you should check for balance and consistency. The following 
steps change the view from Normal view to Slide Sorter view, then Reading view, and back to Normal view.

Modifying and Copying an Illustration
Slides 1 and 2 (shown in Figures 3 – 1a and 3 – 1b on PPT 147) contain an illustration 
of a car that was downloaded from Office.com and then modified. You may want to 
modify an illustration for various reasons. Many times, you cannot find an illustration 
that precisely represents your topic. For example, you want a picture of a person 
wearing a red sweater, but the only available picture has a person with a blue sweater.
Occasionally, you may want to remove or change a portion of an illustration or 
you might want to combine two or more illustrations. For example, you can use one 
illustration for the background and another photo as the foreground. Other times, you 
may want to combine an illustration with another type of object. In this presentation, 
the tires on the car are orange, and you want to change the color to black. In addition, 
the car illustration has a highway below the tires and a colorful background, which are 
not required to display on the slide, so you will ungroup the illustration, change the 
color of the tires, and remove the highway and the background.
Modifying the clip on Slide 2 and then copying it to Slide 1 requires several 
steps. In the following pages, you will perform these tasks:
1.	 Zoom Slide 2 to examine the illustration.
2.	 Ungroup the illustration.
3.	 Change a color.
4.	 Delete objects.
5.	 Regroup the illustration.
6.	 Copy the illustration from Slide 2 to Slide 1.
To Zoom a Slide
You will be modifying small areas of the illustration, so it will help you select 
the relevant pieces if the graphic is enlarged. The following step changes the zoom to 
200 percent.
	1	
Display Slide 2 and then drag the Zoom slider or tap or click the Zoom level button or 
the Zoom In button to change the zoom level to 200% (Figure 3 – 17).

To Ungroup an Illustration
The next step is to ungroup the car illustration, also called a clip, on Slide 2. When you ungroup an 
illustration, PowerPoint breaks it into its component objects. A clip may be composed of a few individual objects 
or several complex groups of objects. These groups can be ungrouped repeatedly until they decompose into 
individual objects. Why? Because an illustration is a collection of complex groups of objects, you may need to ungroup a 
complex object into less complex objects before being able to modify a specific object. When you ungroup a clip and tap 
or click the Yes button in the Microsoft PowerPoint dialog box, PowerPoint converts the clip to a PowerPoint 
object. The following steps ungroup an illustration.

When you ungrouped the car clip, you eliminated the embedding data or linking information that tied 
all the individual pieces together. If you attempt to move or size this clip now, you might encounter difficulties 
because it consists of hundreds of objects and is no longer one unified piece. Dragging or sizing affects only a 
selected object, not the entire collection of objects, so you must use caution when objects are not completely 
regrouped. All of the ungrouped objects in the car clip must be regrouped. Why? So they are not accidentally moved 
or manipulated. The following steps regroup these objects into one object.

•	If necessary, select the clip, tap 
or click the DRAWING TOOLS

Adding Media to Slides
Media files can enrich a presentation if they are used correctly. Movie files can be 
produced with a camera and editing software, and sound files can come from the Office.
com Clip Art collection, files stored on your computer, or an audio track on a CD. To 
hear the sounds, you need a sound card and speakers or headphones on your system.
Once an audio or video clip is inserted into a slide, you can specify options that 
affect how the file is displayed and played. For example, you can have the video play 
automatically when the slide is displayed, or you can tap or click the video frame when 
you are ready to start the playback. You also can have the video fill the entire slide, which 
is referred to as full screen. If you decide to play the slide show automatically and have 
it display full screen, you can drag the video frame to the gray area off the slide so that it 
does not display briefly before going to full screen. You can select the Loop until Stopped 
option to have the video repeat until you tap or click the next slide, or you can choose to 
not have the video frame display on the slide until you tap or click the slide.
If your video clip has recorded sounds, the volume controls give you the option 
to set how loudly this audio will play. They also allow you to mute the sound so that 
your audience will hear no background noise or music.
In the following pages, you will perform these tasks:
1.	 Insert a video file into Slide 3.
2.	 Trim the video file to shorten the play time.
3.	 Add video options that determine the clip’s appearance and playback.
4.	 Insert an audio file into Slide 1.
5.	 Add audio options that determine the clip’s appearance and playback.
6.	 Add a video style to the Slide 3 clip.
7.	 Resize the video.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. Be sure to save the Watch for Motorcycles file again 
and then you can quit PowerPoint. To resume at a later time, start PowerPoint, open the file called Watch for Motorcycles, and 
continue following the steps from this location forward.
To Insert a Video File
Slide 3 has another photo of a motorcyclist, and you have a video clip of a person mounting a motorcycle, 
putting the bike into gear, and riding out of the scene. You want to use a majority of the clip and eliminate a 
few seconds from the end. PowerPoint allows you to insert this clip into your slide and then trim the file. Why? 
Just a portion will play when you preview the clip or run the slide show. This clip is available on the Data Files for 
Students. See the inside back cover of this book for instructions on downloading the Data Files for Students, or 
contact your instructor for more information about accessing the required file. The following steps insert this 
video clip into Slide 3.

To Trim a Video File
Why? The Motorcycle Rider video has a running time of slightly more than 14 seconds. Near the end of the clip, the 
motorcyclist rides out of the frame, so you delete a few seconds from that portion of the file. PowerPoint’s Trim Video feature 
allows you to trim the beginning and end of your clip by designating your desired Start Time and End Time. These 
precise time measurements are accurate to one-thousandth of a second. The start point is indicated by a green 
marker, and the end point is indicated by a red marker. The following steps trim the Motorcycle Rider video clip.

•	With the video clip selected on 
Slide 3, tap or click the Play/Pause 
button to play the entire video.
Can I play the video by tapping 
or clicking the Play button in the

To Add Video Options
Once the video clip is inserted into Slide 3, you can specify that the video plays automatically when the 
slide is displayed. Why? When you are giving your presentation, you do not want to click the mouse or tap the screen

To Insert an Audio File
If you have an active Internet connection, you can search Office.com to locate several motorcycle sounds 
in audio files that you can download and insert into your presentation. The following steps insert an audio clip 
into Slide 1. Why? Avid motorcyclists enjoy hearing the sounds of their engines and often can identify a bike by the engine 
sounds it makes. A clip of a motorcycle engine adds interest to the start of your presentation when Slide 1 is displayed.

•	Tap or click the Insert button in the dialog box 
to insert that file into Slide 1 (Figure 3 – 45).
Why does a sound icon display on the slide?
The icon indicates an audio file is inserted.
Do the audio control buttons have the same 
functions as the video control buttons that 
displayed when I inserted the Motorcycle 
Rider clip?
Yes. The controls include playing and 
pausing the sound, moving back or forward 
0.25 seconds, audio progress, elapsed time, and 
muting or unmuting the sound.
Q&A
Figure 3 – 46
6
•	Drag the sound icon to the lower-left corner of the 
slide (Figure 3 – 46).
Must I move the icon on the slide?
No. Although your audience will not see the 
icon when you run the slide show, it is easier for 
you to see the audio controls in the dark area 
of this slide.
Q&A
To Add Audio Options
 Once an audio clip is inserted into a slide, you can specify options that control playback and appearance. 
As with the video options you applied to the Motorcycle Rider clip, the audio clip can play either automatically 
or when tapped or clicked, it can repeat the clip while a particular slide is displayed, and you can drag the sound 
icon off the slide and set the volume. The following steps add the options of starting automatically, playing until 
the slide no longer is displayed, and hiding the sound icon on the slide. Why? You do not want to tap or click the 
screen to start the sound, so you do not need to see the icon. In addition, you want the engine sound to repeat while the slide 
is displayed to coordinate with the motorcycle picture prominently shown and to keep the audience’s attention focused on the 
topic of listening for motorcycles while operating a vehicle.

What is the difference between the ‘Loop until Stopped’ option and the ‘Play Across 
Slides’ option?

displayed. In contrast, the ‘Play Across Slides’ option would play the clip only once, but 
it would continue to play while other slides in the presentation are displayed. Once the 
end of the clip is reached, the sound would end and not repeat.

Animating Slide Content
Animation includes special visual and sound effects applied to text or other content. 
You already are familiar with one form of animation: transitions between slides. To 
add visual interest and clarity to a presentation, you can animate various parts of an 
individual slide, including pictures, shapes, text, and other slide elements. For example, 
each paragraph on the slide can spin as it is displayed. Individual letters and shapes also 
can spin or move in various motions. PowerPoint has a variety of built-in animations 
that will fade, wipe, or fly-in text and graphics.
Custom Animations
You can create your own custom animations to meet your unique needs. Custom 
animation effects are grouped in categories: entrance, exit, emphasis, and motion 
paths. Entrance effects, as the name implies, determine how slide elements first appear 
on a slide. Exit animations work in the opposite manner as entrance effects: They 
determine how slide elements disappear. Emphasis effects modify text and objects 
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. Be sure to save the Watch for Motorcycles file again 
and then you can quit PowerPoint. To resume at a later time, start PowerPoint, open the file called Watch for Motorcycles, and 
continue following the steps from this location forward.
BTW
Animation Effect 
Icon Colors
Animation effects allow you 
to control how objects enter, 
move on, and exit slides. 
Using a traffic signal analogy 
may help you remember the 
sequence of events. Green 
icons indicate when the 
animation effect starts on the 
slide. Yellow icons represent 
the object’s motion; use them 
with caution so they do not 
distract from the message 
you are conveying to your 
audience. Red icons indicate 
when the object stops 
appearing on a slide.

The car you modified will not appear on Slide 1 when you display the slide. Instead, it will enter the 
slide from the upper-left corner. Why? To give the appearance it is driving toward the motorcycle photo. It will then 
continue downward until it reaches the lower-left side of the photo. Entrance effects are colored green in the 
Animation gallery. The following step applies an entrance effect to the car illustration.

To Animate an Illustration Using  
an Exit Effect
The animated car will enter the slide from the upper-left corner, stop beside the motorcycle photo, and 
then teeter. It then will continue across the slide and exit in the lower-right corner. To continue this animation 
sequence, you first need to apply an exit effect. As with the entrance and emphasis effects, PowerPoint provides a 
wide variety of effects that you can apply to remove an illustration from a slide. These exit effects are colored red 
in the Animation gallery. You already have applied the Fly In entrance effect, so you will apply the Fly Out exit 
effect. Why? It would give continuity to the animation sequence. The following steps add this exit effect to the car 
illustration after the emphasis effect.

presentation, you want the car to exit in the lower-right corner. Why? To give the 
impression it is continuing down an invisible highway. The following steps change the exit 
animation direction from To Bottom to To Bottom-Right.

To Preview an Animation Sequence
Why? Although you have not completed developing the presentation, you should view the animation you have added 
to check for continuity and verify that the animation is displaying as you expected. By default, the entrance, emphasis, 
and exit animations will be displayed when you run the presentation and tap or click the slide. The following 
step runs the presentation and displays the three animations.
To Modify Entrance Animation Timing
The three animation effects are displayed quickly. To create a dramatic effect, you can change the timing. 
The default setting is to start each animation with a tap or click, but you can change this setting so that the 
entrance effect is delayed until a specified number of seconds has passed. The following steps modify the start, 
delay, and duration settings for the entrance animation. Why? You want the slide title text to display and then, a few 
seconds later, the car to start to drive down the slide slowly.

•	Tap or click After Previous to change the start option.
Why did the numbered tags change from 1, 2, 3 to 0, 1, 2?
The first animation now occurs automatically without a tap or click. The first and second 
taps or clicks now will apply the emphasis and exit animations.
What is the difference between the With Previous and After Previous settings?
The With Previous setting starts the effect simultaneously with any prior animation; 
the After Previous setting starts the animation after a prior animation has ended. If the 
prior animation is fast or a short duration, it may be difficult for a viewer to discern the 
difference between these two settings.

•	Tap or click the Duration up arrow (ANIMATIONS tab | Timing group) several times to 
increase the time from 00.50 second to 02.00 seconds (Figure 3 – 62).
•	Tap or click the Preview button to view the animations.
What is the difference between the duration time and the delay time?
The duration time is the length of time in which the animation occurs; the delay time is 
the length of time that passes before the animation begins.
Can I type the speed in the Duration box instead of tap or clicking the arrow to adjust 
the speed?
Yes. Typing the numbers allows you to set a precise timing.

To Modify Emphasis and Exit Timings
Now that the entrance animation settings have been modified, you then can 
change the emphasis and exit effects for the car illustration. The emphasis effect can 
occur once the entrance effect has concluded, and then the exit effect can commence. 
With gravity’s effect, the car should be able to roll more quickly down the lower part of 
the slide, so you will shorten the duration of the exit effect compared with the duration 
of the entrance effect. The animation sequence should flow without stopping, so you 
will not change the default delay timing of 00.00 seconds. The following steps modify 
the start and duration settings for the emphasis and exit animations.
	1	
Tap or click the tag numbered 1, which represents the emphasis effect, on the left side 
of the car illustration.
	2	
Tap or click the Start arrow (ANIMATIONS tab | Timing group) to display the Start 
menu and then tap or click After Previous to change the start option.
	3	
Tap or click the Duration up arrow (ANIMATIONS tab | Timing group) several times to 
increase the time to 03.00 seconds.

Tap or click the tag numbered 1, which now represents the exit effect, tap or click the 
Start arrow, and then tap or click After Previous.

Customizing Slide Elements
PowerPoint’s varied themes and layouts help give presentations a unified and 
aesthetically pleasing look. You may, however, desire to modify the default settings to 
give your slides a unique quality. One of the easier methods of developing a custom 
show is to change a theme for one or more slides, not an entire presentation. Similarly, 
you can change the variant for one or more slides to give a coordinating look to the 
slides in your deck. One other method of altering your slides slightly is to change the 
default colors associated with a particular theme.
The animated elements on Slide 2 help emphasize the need for drivers to pay 
particular attention to motorcyclists. Changing the theme colors for that slide to red 
calls even more attention to the importance of following the guidelines expressed in 
the bulleted list.
To Change the Theme and Variant  
on One Slide
The Office theme applied to the presentation is appropriate for this topic. The font and placeholder locations 
are simple and add variety without calling attention to the design elements. The following steps change the theme 
and variant for Slide 2. Why? To call attention to the important material in the bulleted list on Slide 2, you can apply an 
equally effective theme that has a few design elements. You then can modify this new theme by changing the variant on one slide.

Printing handouts is useful for reviewing a presentation. You can analyze several slides displayed 
simultaneously on one page. Additionally, many businesses distribute handouts of the slide show before or after 
a presentation so attendees can refer to a copy. Each page of the handout can contain reduced images of one, 
two, three, four, six, or nine slides. The three-slides-per-page handout includes lines beside each slide so that 
your audience can write notes conveniently. The following steps preview and print a presentation handout with 
two slides per page. Why? Two of the slides are predominantly pictures, so your audience does not need full pages of those 
images. The five bulleted paragraphs on Slide 2 can be read easily on one-half of a sheet of paper.

PPT 192   PowerPoint Chapter 3   Reusing a Presentation and Adding Media and Animation
What decisions will you need to make when creating your next presentation?
Use these guidelines as you complete the assignments in this chapter and create your own slide show decks outside  
of this class.
1.	Determine if adjusting photo colors and effects can increase visual appeal.
a)	Change color saturation.
b)	Change tones.
c)	Recolor the image.
2.	Vary paragraph alignment.
a)	Themes dictate whether paragraph text is aligned left, center, or right in a placeholder, but you can modify these 
design decisions when necessary. Moving placeholders and changing paragraph alignment can help create a 
unique slide.
b)	Different effects are achieved when text alignment shifts in a presentation.
3.	Use multimedia selectively.
a)	Locate video, music, and sound files that are appropriate for your audience and that you have permission to use.
b)	Use media files only when necessary, however, because they draw the audience’s attention away from the presenter 
and toward the slides.
c)	Using too many multimedia files can be overwhelming.
4.	Use animation sparingly.
a)	PowerPoint audience members usually take notice the first time an animation is displayed on the screen, so 
be certain the animation will help focus on the precise points being presented during a particular time of the 
presentation.
b)	Avoid using animation for the sake of using animation. Use animation only when necessary to add emphasis.
c)	Animation overuse annoys and desensitizes audience members.
d)	Carefully decide how text or a slide element enters and exits a slide and how it is displayed once it is present on the 
slide.
5.	Use handouts to organize your speech and to distribute to audiences.
a)	Determine if a handout with two slides per page will help unify your message when you distribute copies to an 
audience.

and implement a solution.
1. Design and Create a Presentation about Canal Locks
Personal
Part 1:  Your family belongs to a small boat club with 10 members. The club has planned a canal 
cruise next summer. Everyone knows there are different water levels on this canal. As the president 
of your club, you were asked to get all the information necessary about how the 10 boats will pass 
through the locks. Some of the members of your club have admitted they know very little about ca-
nal or river locks. Last summer when you went to one of the lock sites, you took a video and asked 
the person manning the locks some questions. You learned that the locks are manned 24 hours a 
day between May and October. He explained how the locks are similar to a flight of stairs. There 
are two sets of gates (top and bottom) and the chamber where your boat enters. The gates close and 
water is added or drained to meet the next level. Use the concepts and techniques presented in this 
chapter to prepare a presentation with a minimum of four slides that explores this subject. Select a 
suitable theme, add media including the video named Locks Video available in the Data Files for 
Students and search for an appropriate audio file to add interest to your presentation. The presen-
tation should also contain photos and illustrations. The Data Files for Students contains five photos 
and illustrations called Locks1, Locks2, Locks3, Locks4, and Locks5. You can add your own digital 
photos or videos or photos from Office.com if they are appropriate for this topic. Apply picture 
styles and effects. Add a title slide and closing slide to complete your presentation. Submit your as-
signment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: where 
to place text, how to format the text (for example, font, font size, and adding font effects), which 
graphical image(s) to use, what styles and effects to apply, where to position the graphical image, 
how to format the graphical images, and which shapes to use to add interest to the presentation. 
What was the rationale behind each of these decisions? When you reviewed the document, what 
further revisions did you make and why? Where would you recommend showing this slide show?
2. Design and Create a Presentation about Garter Snakes
Professional
Part 1:  You work part-time as a teacher’s assistant in an elementary school science class. The 
teacher decided that a garter snake would make an excellent reptile addition to the classroom. She 
assigned you the task of getting a garter snake and setting up its habitat. You learned that they are 
harmless and non-venomous, they eat bugs and small rodents, they can grow to between 1 foot 
(0.3048 m) and 2 feet (0.6096 m) long. They can help control mice or insect problems. You will 
need a container with a secure lid, preferably a glass aquarium. You decide to put together a pre-
sentation to teach the class about garter snakes and how to care for them. Use the concepts and 
techniques presented in this chapter to create a presentation with at least four slides. Select a suit-
able theme and then include a title slide, photos, illustrations, and an audio file to add interest to 
the presentation. The Data Files for Students contains a video called Snake1 and five photos and il-
lustrations called Snake2, Snake3, Snake4, Snake5, and Snake6. One or more of the illustrations can 
be ungrouped, and you can change the color to add some visual interest to the presentation. Submit 
your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.

3. Design and Create a Presentation about Bird Watching
Research and Collaboration
Part 1:  Millions of people across the country enjoy watching birds. Some belong to clubs, and 
some join bird watching tours in their cities and also in other states and countries. Some plan holi-
days and family trips around the migration habits of their favorite birds. It is an inexpensive hobby 
and a good reason to get some exercise outdoors and enjoy nature. The activity is very relaxing and 
is a great social activity. You have decided to start a bird watching club with some of your friends 
and neighbors. There are 12 members of your club, so you divide into three groups of four mem-
bers. One group will go to the library and do some research on the various species of birds in your 
area. The second group will research what kind of binoculars are best for beginners. The third 
group will take some video and photos at the local nature center so that you can put together a pre-
sentation about bird watching to share with your new club members. After gathering all the infor-
mation and photos about bird watching, use the concepts and techniques presented in this chapter 
to prepare a presentation with a minimum of four slides that explore the subject of bird watching. 
Select a suitable theme, include a title slide, bulleted lists, shapes, and WordArt. The Data Files for 
Students contains one video called Bird Watching and six photos and illustrations called Birds1, 
Birds2, Birds3, Birds4, Birds5, and Birds6. Change the color for at least one photo. Apply a transi-
tion in the Subtle area to all slides and increase the duration. Submit your assignment in the format 
specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the presentation in this assignment: where 
to place text, how to format the text (such as font, font size, and where to use WordArt), which 
image(s) to use, what styles and effects to apply, where to position the images, which styles to use, 
and which shapes to use to add interest to the presentation. What was the rationale behind each of 
these decisions? When you reviewed the document, what further revisions did you make and why? 
Where would you recommend showing this slide show?

1 Creating a Worksheet  
and a Chart
Introduction
Almost any organization collects vast amounts of data. Often, data is consolidated 
into a summary so that people in the organization better understand the meaning of 
the data. An Excel worksheet allows data to be summarized and charted easily. A chart 
conveys a visual representation of data. In this chapter, you will create a worksheet 
that includes a chart. The data in the worksheet and chart includes data for a personal 
budget worksheet that contains monthly estimates on budget amounts.
Project — Worksheet and a Chart
The project in this chapter follows proper design guidelines and uses Excel to create 
the worksheet and chart shown in Figure 1 – 1a and Figure 1 – 1b. The worksheet 
contains budget data for Bob Gleamin. He wants to estimate what his personal budget 
will look like for the year, so he has gathered together the information on how much 
he pays for various expenses and has a list of his current incomes. Now, he wants an 
easy-to-read worksheet using this information to see how much he will be ahead or 
behind each month to aid him in planning his budget. In addition, a 3-D pie chart is 
required that shows the estimated expenses portion for each of the 12 months.

Figure 1 – 1 (b) Pie Chart Showing Monthly Expenses by Category
The first step in creating an effective worksheet is to make sure you 
understand what is required. The person or persons requesting the worksheet 
should supply their requirements in a requirements document. A requirements 
document includes a needs statement, a source of data, a summary of calculations, 
and any other special requirements for the worksheet, such as charting and web 
support. Figure 1 – 2 shows the requirements document for the new workbook to be 
created in this chapter.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to perform basic workbook tasks using Excel. 
The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform as you progress 
through this chapter:
Descriptive, Overview Roadmap
1.	 enter text in a blank worksheet.
2.	 calculate sums and use formulas in the worksheet.
3.	 save the workbook using the file name, Bob Gleamin Budget.
4.	 format text in the worksheet.
5.	 insert a pie chart into the worksheet.
6.	 Assign a name to the worksheet tab.
7.	 preview and print the worksheet.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the Save Workbook activity.
1 enter text | 2 calculate sums & use formulas | 3 save workbook | 4 format text 
5 insert chart | 6 name tab | 7 preview & print worksheet 
The key to developing a useful worksheet is careful planning. Careful planning can reduce your effort significantly and result in 
a worksheet that is accurate, easy to read, flexible, and useful. When analyzing a problem and designing a worksheet solution, 
what steps should you follow?  
•	Define the problem, including need, source of data, calculations, charting, and web or special requirements.
•	Design the worksheet.
•	Enter the data and formulas.
•	Test the worksheet. 
CONSIDER THIS
After carefully reviewing the requirements document (Figure 1⁜– 2 on the 
previous page) and making the necessary decisions, the next step is to design a solution 
or draw a sketch of the worksheet based on the requirements, including titles, column 
and row headings, the location of data values, and the 3-D pie chart, as shown in 
Figure 1⁜– 3. The dollar signs and commas that you see in the sketch of the worksheet 
indicate formatted numeric values.
With a good understanding of the requirements document, an understanding of 
the necessary decisions, and a sketch of the worksheet, the next step is to use Excel to 
create the worksheet and chart.

To Run Excel and Create a Blank Workbook
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and you 
want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your screen’s 
resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s resolution, 
refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows is running, use the Start screen 
or the Search box to run Excel based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Excel on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter. 
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for an Excel 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains an Excel 2013 
tile, tap or click it to run Excel and then proceed to Step 5; if the Start screen does not 
contain the Excel 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search for the Excel app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of the 
screen to display the Charms bar and then tap or click the Search charm on the Charms 
bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   Excel   as the search text in the Search box and watch the search results 
appear in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click Excel 2013 in the search results to run Excel.
	5	
Tap or click the Blank workbook thumbnail on the Excel start screen to create a blank 
workbook and display it in the Excel window.
	6	
If the Excel window is not maximized, tap or click the Maximize button on its title bar 
to maximize the window.

One of the few  
differences between 
Windows 7 and  
Windows 8 occurs in the  
steps to run Excel. If you  
are ­using Windows 7, 
click the Start button, 
type Excel in the 
‘Search programs and 
files’ text box, click Excel 
2013, and then, if neces-
sary, maximize the Excel 
window. For detailed 
steps to run Excel in  
Windows 7, refer to the

If you are using your 
finger on a touch screen 
and are having difficulty 
completing the steps in 
this chapter, consider 
using a stylus. Many 
people find it easier to be 
precise with a stylus than 
with a finger. In addition, 
with a stylus you see the 
pointer. If you still are 
having trouble complet-
ing the steps with a sty-
lus, try using a mouse.

EX 6   Excel Chapter 1   Creating a Worksheet and a Chart 
Selecting a Cell
To enter data into a cell, you first must select it. The easiest way to select a cell (make 
it active) is to tap it or use the mouse to move the block plus sign pointer to the cell 
and then click.
An alternative method is to use the arrow keys that are located just to the right 
of the alphanumeric keys on a standard keyboard. An arrow key selects the cell adjacent 
to the active cell in the direction of the arrow on the key.
You know a cell is selected, or active, when a heavy border surrounds the cell and 
the active cell reference appears in the Name box on the left side of the formula bar. 
Excel also changes the active cell’s column heading and row heading to a shaded color.
Entering Text
In Excel, any set of characters containing a letter, hyphen (as in a telephone number), 
or space is considered text. Text is used to place titles, such as worksheet titles, column 
titles, and row titles, on the worksheet. 
Worksheet titles and subtitles should be as brief and meaningful as possible. 
A worksheet title could include the name of the organization, department, or a 
description of the content of the worksheet. A worksheet subtitle, if included, could 
include a more detailed description of the content of the worksheet. Examples of 
worksheet titles are December 2014 Payroll and Year 2015 Projected Budget, and 
examples of subtitles are Marketing Department and Rent and Utilities, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 1⁜– 4, data in a worksheet often is identified by row and 
column titles so that the user of a worksheet easily can identify the meaning of the 
data. Rows typically contain information that is similar to items in a list. Columns 
typically contain descriptive information about items in rows or contain information 
that helps to group the data in the worksheet. Examples of row titles are Income and 
Total, and examples of column titles are Wages and Gas.

A1 and then point 
to the Enter box in 
the formula bar to 
prepare to enter 
text in the active cell 
(Figure 1⁜– 6).
Why did the 
appearance of the 
formula bar change?
Excel displays the 
title in the formula 
bar and in cell A1. 
When you begin 
typing a cell entry, 
Excel displays two 
additional boxes in 
the formula bar: the 
Cancel box and the 
Enter box. Tapping or 
clicking the Enter box completes an 
entry. Tapping or clicking the Cancel 
box cancels an entry.
Q&A
To Enter the Worksheet Titles
As shown in Figure 1⁜– 4, the worksheet title, Personal Budget Worksheet, identifies the purpose for which 
the worksheet is being created in Chapter 1. The worksheet subtitle, Monthly Estimates, identifies the type of data 
contained in the worksheet. Why? A title and subtitle help the reader to understand clearly what the worksheet contains.
The following steps enter the worksheet titles in cells A1 and A2. Later in this chapter, the worksheet titles 
will be formatted so that they appear as shown in Figure 1⁜– 4.

in three cells?
When the text is 
longer than the 
width of a cell, 
Excel displays the 
overflow characters 
in adjacent cells to 
the right as long as 
those adjacent cells 
contain no data. If 
the adjacent cells 
contain data, Excel 
hides the overflow 
characters. Excel displays the overflow  
characters in the formula bar whenever  
that cell is the active cell.

AutoCorrect
The AutoCorrect feature of Excel works behind the scenes, correcting 
common mistakes when you complete a text entry in a cell. AutoCorrect makes three 
types of corrections for you:
1.	 Corrects two initial uppercase letters by changing the second letter to lowercase.
2.	 Capitalizes the first letter in the names of days.
3.	 Replaces commonly misspelled words with their correct spelling. For example, 
it will change the misspelled word recieve to receive when you complete the entry. 
AutoCorrect will correct the spelling of hundreds of commonly misspelled 
words automatically.
To Enter Column Titles
The column titles in row 3 shown in Figure 1⁜– 4 (Income, January, February, March, April, May, June, 
July, August, September, October, November, December, and Total) identify the numbers in each column in the 
first part of the worksheet. The column titles in row 8 (Expenses, January, February, March, April, May, June, 
July, August, September, October, November, December, and Total) identify the numbers in each column in the 
second part of the worksheet. In the case of the Personal Budget Worksheet data, the month names identify the 
estimates for the budget for each month using the income or expense type, depending on which part you are 
reviewing. 
To enter the column titles in row 3, select the appropriate cell and then enter the text. The following steps 
enter the column titles in row 3. Why? Data entered in columns should be identified using column titles to identify what 
the column contains.

 What is the vertical 
line in cell A1?
The text in cell A1 
is followed by the 
insertion point. The 
insertion point is 
a blinking vertical 
line that indicates 
where the next 
typed character will 
appear.

The Ribbon and 
Screen Resolution
Excel may change how the 
groups and buttons within 
the groups appear on the 
ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than 
1366 3 768.

To Enter Row Titles
The next step in developing the worksheet for this project is to enter the row titles in column A. For 
the Personal Budget Worksheet data, the list of income types and expense types make up the row titles. It is 
likely that in the future, Bob Gleamin may add more income or expense items. Each income or expense item, 
therefore, should be placed in its own row. The row titles in column A for income (Wages, Dividends, and Total), 
expenses (Rent, Food, Tuition, Books, Entertainment, Car Payment, Gas, Miscellaneous, and Total), and net 
income (Net) identify the numbers in each row.
This process for entering row titles is similar to the process for entering column titles. The following steps 
enter the row titles in the worksheet.

Why is the text left-aligned in the cells?
When you enter text, Excel automatically left-aligns the text in the cell. Excel treats any 
combination of numbers, spaces, and nonnumeric characters as text. For example, Excel 
recognizes the following entries as text: 401AX21, 921–231, 619 321, 883XTY
You can change the text alignment in a cell by realigning it. Other alignment techniques 
are discussed later in this chapter.

Entering Numbers
In Excel, you can enter numbers into cells to represent amounts. A number can 
contain only the following characters:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + – ( ) , / . $ % E e
If a cell entry contains any other keyboard character (including spaces), Excel 
interprets the entry as text and treats it accordingly. The use of special characters is 
explained when they are used in this book.
To Enter Numbers
The Personal Budget Worksheet numbers used in Chapter 1 are summarized in Table 1⁜– 1. These 
numbers, which represent yearly income and expenses amounts, must be entered in rows 4–5 and 9–16.

the worksheet (Figure 1⁜– 15).
Why are the numbers right-aligned?
When you enter numeric data in a cell, Excel recognizes the values as numbers and right-aligns the values in order 
to properly vertically align decimal and integer values. For example, values entered below those entered in this 
step automatically will be right-aligned so that the decimals of the values properly align.

•	Tap or click cell B6 to make it the active cell and complete the entry in the previously selected cell. 
•	Tap or click the Sum button (HOME tab | Editing group) to display a formula in the formula bar and in the 
active cell (Figure 1⁜– 17).
What if my screen displays a Sum menu?
If you are using a touch screen, you may not have a separate Sum button and Sum arrow. In this case, 
select the desired option on the Sum menu.
How does Excel know which cells to sum?
When you enter the SUM function using the Sum button on the ribbon, Excel automatically selects what it 
considers to be your choice of the range to sum. When proposing the range to sum, Excel first looks for a 
range of cells with numbers above the active cell and then to the left. If Excel proposes the wrong range, 
you can correct it by dragging through the correct range before pressing the enter key. You also can enter 
the correct range by typing the beginning cell reference, a colon (:), and the ending cell reference.
Q&A
Calculating a Sum
The next step in creating the worksheet is to perform any necessary calculations, such 
as calculating the column and row totals. When you use functions, Excel performs the 
calculations for you, which helps to prevent errors and allows you to work more efficiently.
To Sum a Column of Numbers
As stated in the requirements document in Figure 1⁜– 2 on page EX 3, totals are required for each month 
and each budget item. The first calculation is to determine the total income for the Wages and Dividends in the 
month of January in column B. To calculate this value in cell B6, Excel must add, or sum, the numbers in cells 
B4 and B5. The SUM function adds all the numbers in a range of cells. Why? Excel’s SUM function provides a 
convenient means to accomplish this task.
A range is a series of two or more adjacent cells in a column or row or a rectangular group of cells. 
For example, the group of adjacent cells B4 and B5 is called a range. Many Excel operations, such as summing 
numbers, are performed on a range of cells. 
After the total income for a month in column B is determined, the totals for the remaining months for 
income, the totals for the expenses, and the totals for budget item will be determined. The following steps sum 
the numbers in column B.

•	Tap or click the Enter box in the formula bar to enter a sum in the active cell.
What is the purpose of the Sum arrow?
If you tap or click the Sum arrow on the right side of the Sum button (HOME tab | Editing group) 
(shown in Figure 1⁜– 17), Excel displays a list of often-used functions from which you can choose. The list 
includes functions that allow you to determine the average, the number of items in the selected range, 
the maximum value, or the minimum value of a range of numbers.

Using the Fill Handle to Copy a

Excel also must calculate the totals for income during each month in cells C6:M6. 
Table 1⁜–⁜2 on the next page illustrates the similarities between the entry in cell B6 and 
the entries required to sum the totals in cells C6, D6, E6, F6, G6, H6, I6, J6, K6, L6, 
and M6.
To place the SUM functions in range C6:M6, you could follow the same steps 
shown previously in Figure 1⁜– 17 and Figure 1⁜– 18. A second, more efficient method, 
however, is to copy the SUM function from cell B6 to the range C6:M6. The cell 
being copied is called the source area or copy area. The range of cells receiving the 
copy is called the destination area or paste area.

Although the SUM function entries in Table 1⁜– 2 are similar, they are not 
exact copies. The range in each SUM function entry uses cell references that are one 
column to the right of the previous column. When you copy formulas that include cell 
references, Excel automatically adjusts them for each new position, resulting in the 
SUM function entries illustrated in Table 1⁜– 2. Each adjusted cell reference is called a 
relative reference.

To Copy a Cell to Adjacent Cells in a Row
The easiest way to copy the SUM formula from cell B6 to cells C6:M6 is to use the fill handle. Why? 
Using the fill handle means that Excel creates the formulas for you. The fill handle is the small black square located in 
the lower-right corner of the heavy border around the active cell. The following steps use the fill handle to copy 
cell B6 to the adjacent cells C6:M6.

•	With cell B6 active, 
if you are using a 
touch screen, press 
and hold cell B6 
to display the mini

AutoFill on the 
mini toolbar; if you

point to the fill 
handle to activate 
it (Figure 1⁜– 19).
Why is my fill handle 
not a black square?
If you are using a 
touch screen, the fill

To Determine Multiple Totals  
at the Same Time
The next step in building the worksheet is to determine the budget item totals for each budget item and 
total income and expenses in column N. To calculate these totals, you can use the SUM function much as it was 
used to total the budget items for each month in rows 6 and 17. 
In this example, however, Excel will determine totals for all of the rows at the same time. Why? By 
determining multiple totals at the same time, the number of steps to add totals is reduced. The following steps sum 
multiple totals at once.

To Enter a Formula Using the Keyboard
The formulas needed in the worksheet are noted in the requirements document as follows:
Net (row 19) = Income – Expenses 
The net for each month, which appears in row 19, is equal to the income total in row 6 minus the expense 
total in row 17. The following steps enter the initial net formula in cell B19 using the keyboard. Why? Sometimes 
a predefined function does not fit your needs; therefore, you enter a formula of your own.
1
•	Select cell B19 to 
deselect the selected 
range.
•	Type   =b6-b17  
in the cell to display 
the formula in the 
formula bar and in 
the current cell and 
to display colored 
borders around the 
cells referenced 
in the formula 
(Figure 1⁜–⁜27).
What occurs on the 
worksheet as I enter 
the formula?
The equal sign (=) 
preceding b6–b17 in 
the formula alerts Excel 
that you are entering a 
formula or function and not text. Because the most common error when entering a formula is to reference  
the wrong cell in a formula, Excel colors the borders of the cells referenced in the formula. The coloring helps  
in the reviewing process to ensure the cell references are correct. The minus sign (–) following b6 in the formula is 
the arithmetic operator that directs Excel to perform the subtraction operation.

To Save a Workbook with a New File Name
You have performed many tasks while creating this workbook and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the workbook on 
your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation.
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your 
files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains an Excel folder 
(for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the workbook in the Excel folder in the 
CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of the procedure 
for saving a file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.

The key to formatting a worksheet is to consider the ways you can enhance the worksheet so that it appears professional. When 
formatting a worksheet, what steps should you consider? 
•	Identify how to format various elements of the worksheet.
•	Increase the font size of cells.
•	Change the font color of cells. 
•	Center the worksheet titles, subtitles, and column headings. 
•	Modify column widths to best fit text in cells. 
•	Change the font style of cells. 
CONSIDER THIS
To change the unformatted worksheet in Figure 1⁜– 29a so that it appears like the 
formatted worksheet in Figure 1⁜– 29b, the following tasks must be completed:
1.	 Change the font, change the font style to bold, increase the font size, and change 
the font color of the worksheet titles in cells A1 and A2. 
2.	 Center the worksheet titles in cells A1 and A2 across columns A through N.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Excel. To resume at a later time, 
run Excel, open the file called Bob Gleamin Budget, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Formatting the Worksheet
The text, numeric entries, and functions for the worksheet now are complete. The next 
step is to format the worksheet. You format a worksheet to emphasize certain entries 
and make the worksheet easier to read and understand.
Figure 1⁜– 29a shows the worksheet before formatting. Figure 1⁜– 29b shows the 
worksheet after formatting. As you can see from the two figures, a worksheet that is 
formatted not only is easier to read but also looks more professional.

3.	 Format the body of the worksheet. The body of the worksheet, range A3:N19, 
includes the column titles, row titles, and numbers. Formatting the body of the 
worksheet changes the numbers to use a dollars-and-cents format, with dollar signs 
in rows 4 and 9 and the total rows (row 6 and 17); changes the styles of some rows; 
adds underlining that emphasizes portions of the worksheet; and modifies the column 
widths to fit the text in the columns and make the text and numbers readable.
The remainder of this section explains the process required to format the 
worksheet. Although the formatting procedures are explained in the order described 
above, you should be aware that you could make these format changes in any order. 
Modifying the column widths, however, usually is done last because other formatting 
changes may affect the size of data in the cells in the column. 
Font Style, Size, and Color
The characters that Excel displays on the screen are a specific font, style, size, and 
color. The font, or font face, defines the appearance and shape of the letters, numbers, 
and special characters. Examples of fonts include Calibri, Cambria, Times New Roman, 
Arial, and Courier. Font style indicates how the characters are emphasized. Common 
font styles include regular, bold, underline, and italic. The font size specifies the size 
of the characters on the screen. Font size is gauged by a measurement system called 
points. A single point is about 1/72 of one inch in height. Thus, a character with a point 
size of 10 is about 10/72 of one inch in height. The font color defines the color of the 
characters. Excel can display characters in a wide variety of colors.
When Excel first runs, the preset font for the entire workbook is Calibri, with a font 
size, font style, and font color of 11–point regular black. Excel allows you to change the font 
characteristics in a single cell, a range of cells, the entire worksheet, or the entire workbook.

Organizing Files  
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 101, 
a good practice would be  
to save all Excel files in a 
Excel folder in a CIS 101 
folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of 
this book.

To Change a Cell Style
Excel includes the capability of changing several characteristics of a cell, such as the font, font size, and 
font color, all at once by assigning a predefined cell style to a cell. Why? Using the predefined styles that Excel 
includes provides a consistent appearance to common portions of your worksheets, such as worksheet titles, worksheet subtitles, 
column headings, and total rows. The following steps assign the Title cell style to the worksheet title in cell A1.

To Center Cell Entries across Columns  
by Merging Cells
The final step in formatting the worksheet title and subtitle is to center them across columns A through N.  
Why? Centering a title across the columns used in the body of the worksheet improves the worksheet’s appearance. To do 
this, the 14 cells in the range A1:N1 are combined, or merged, into a single cell that is the width of the columns 
in the body of the worksheet. The 14 cells in the range A2:N2 are merged in a similar manner. Merging cells 
involves creating a single cell by combining two or more selected cells. The following steps center the worksheet 
title and subtitle across columns by merging cells.
1
•	Select cell A1 and 
then if you are using 
a touch screen, drag 
the selection handles 
as necessary to cell N1; 
if you are using a 
mouse, drag to cell 
N1 to highlight the 
range to be merged 
and centered 
(Figure 1⁜– 40).
What if a cell in 
the range B1:N1 
contains data?
For the ‘Merge &  
Center’ button 
(HOME tab | Alignment 
group) to work properly, all the cells except the  
leftmost cell in the selected range must be empty.

If you are using a 
touch screen, you 
may not have a

select the desired option on the Merge & Center menu.
What happened to cells B1 through N1?
After the merge, cells B1 through N1 no longer exist.  
The new cell A1 now extends across columns A through N.

to merge and center

subtitle across cells 
A2 through N2 
(Figure 1⁜– 42).
Are cells B1 through 
N1 and B2 through 
N2 lost forever?
No. The opposite 
of merging cells is 
splitting a merged cell. 
After you have merged multiple cells to create one merged cell, you can unmerge, or split, the merged cell to 
display the original cells on the worksheet. You split a merged cell by selecting it and tapping or clicking the 
‘Merge & Center’ button. For example, if you tap or click the ‘Merge & Center’ button a second time in Step 2, 
it will split the merged cell A1 into cells A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, I1, J1, K1, L1, M1, and N1.

To Format Rows Using Cell Styles
The next step to format the worksheet is to format the rows. Why? Row titles and the total row should be 
formatted so that anyone who views the worksheet can distinguish quickly the column titles and total row from the data in 
the body of the worksheet. Data rows can be formatted to make them easier to read, as well. The following steps format 
the column titles and total row using cell styles in the default worksheet theme.

To Format Numbers in the Worksheet
Why? As previously noted, the numbers in the first row and last row of each section should be formatted to use a 
dollar-and-cents format, while the others use a comma format. Excel allows you to format numbers in a variety of 
ways, and these methods are discussed in other chapters in this book. The following steps use buttons on the 
ribbon to format the numbers in the worksheet.
1
•	Select the range B4:N4.
•	Tap or click the 
‘Accounting Number 
Format’ button 
(HOME tab | Number 
group) to apply the 
accounting number 
format to the cells in 
the selected range.
What if my 
screen displays an 
Accounting Number 
Format menu?
If you are using a 
touch screen, you may 
not have a separate  
‘Accounting Number Format’ button and ‘Accounting Number Format’ arrow.  
In this case, select the desired option on the Accounting Number Format menu.
•	Select the range B5:N5 (Figure 1⁜– 47). 
What effect does the accounting number format have on the selected cells?
The accounting number format causes the cells to be displayed with two decimal places so that decimal places in cells 
below the selected cells align vertically. Cell widths are adjusted automatically to accommodate the new formatting.

To Adjust the Column Width
The last step in formatting the worksheet is to adjust the width of the columns so that all the titles can 
be seen clearly. Why? To make a worksheet easy to read, the column widths should be adjusted appropriately. Excel 
includes several methods for adjusting cell widths and row heights, and these methods are discussed later in 
this book. The following steps adjust the width of columns A through N so that the contents of the columns 
are seen clearly.
1
•	If you are using a mouse, point 
to the boundary on the right side 
of the column A heading above 
row 1 to change the pointer to a 
split double arrow (Figure 1⁜– 50).

2
•	If you are using a mouse, double-
click the boundary to adjust the 
width of the column to the width 
of the largest item in the column 
(Figure 1⁜– 51).
What if none of the items in 
column A extends through the 
entire width of the column?
If all of the items in column A 
were shorter in length than 
the width of the column when 
you double-tap or double-click 
the right side of the column A 
heading, then Excel still would 
adjust the column width to the 
largest item in the column. That is, 
Excel would reduce the width of 
the column to the largest item.

To Use the Name Box to Select a Cell
The next step is to chart the monthly expenses. To create the chart, you first must select the cell in 
the upper-left corner of the range to chart (cell A3). Rather than tapping or clicking cell A3 to select it, the 
next section describes how to use the Name box to select the cell. The Name box is located on the left side of 
the formula bar. Why? To select any cell, tap or click the Name box and enter the cell reference of the cell you want to 
select. The following steps select cell A3 using the Name box.

•	Tap or click the Name box in the 
formula bar and then type   a3   
as the cell you want to select 
(Figure 1⁜–⁜53).

Excel Chapter 1
Creating a Worksheet and a Chart    Excel Chapter 1   EX 37
Adding a Pie Chart to the Worksheet
Excel includes 10 chart types from which you can choose, including column, line, pie, 
bar, area, X Y (scatter), stock, surface, bubble, and radar. The type of chart you choose 
depends on the type of data that you have, how much data you have, and the message 
you want to convey. 
A line chart often is used to illustrate changes in data over time. Pie charts show 
the contribution of each piece of data to the whole, or total, of the data. Area charts, 
like line charts, illustrate changes over time, but often are used to compare more than 
one set of data, and the area below the lines is filled in with a different color for each 
set of data. An X Y (scatter) chart is used much like a line chart, but each piece of 
data is represented by a dot and is not connected with a line. A stock chart provides a 
number of methods commonly used in the financial industry to show stock market data. 
A surface chart compares data from three columns and/or rows in a three-dimensional 
manner. A bubble chart is much like an X Y (scatter) chart, but a third set of data results 
indicates how large each individual dot, or bubble, is on the chart. A radar chart can 
compare several sets of data in a manner that resembles a radar screen, with each set 
of data represented by a different color. A column or cylinder chart is a good way to 
compare values side by side. A pie chart can go even further in comparing values across 
categories by showing each pie piece in comparison with the others. 
As outlined in the requirements document in Figure 1⁜– 2 on page EX 3, the 
worksheet should include a pie chart to represent graphically the yearly expenses 
totals for the expenses budget items for Bob Gleamin’s budget. The pie chart shown in 
Figure 1⁜– 55 is on its own sheet in the workbook. The pie chart resides on a separate 
sheet, called a chart sheet, which contains only the chart.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. Be sure to save the Bob Gleamin Budget file 
again and then you can exit Excel. To resume at a later time, run Excel, open the file called Bob Gleamin Budget, 
and continue following the steps from this location forward.

In this worksheet, the ranges to chart are the nonadjacent ranges A9:A16 
(category names) and N9:N16 (yearly expense totals). The expense titles in the range 
A9:A16 will identify the slices of the pie chart; these entries are called category 
names. The range N9:N16 contains the data that determines the size of the slices in 
the pie; these entries are called the data series. Because eight budget items are being 
charted, the 3-D pie chart contains eight slices.
To Add a 3-D Pie Chart
Why? When you want to see how each part relates to the whole, you use a pie chart. The following steps draw the 
3-D pie chart.

multiple titles in multiple sections of the worksheet, use a sheet tab name that encompasses the meaning of all of the sections.
The following steps rename the worksheet tab.
1
•	Double-tap or double-click the sheet tab labeled Sheet1 in the lower-left corner of the window.
•	Type   Monthly Budget Planner   as the worksheet tab name and then press the enter key to display the 
new worksheet tab name on the sheet tab (Figure 1⁜–⁜63).
What is the maximum length for a sheet tab name?
Worksheet tab names can be up to 31 characters (including spaces) in length. Longer worksheet names,  
however, mean that fewer sheet tabs will show. If you have multiple sheets, you will be able to scroll  
through sheet tabs.

Document Properties
Excel helps you organize and identify your files by using document properties, 
which are the details about a file such as the project author, title, and subject. For 
example, a class name or workbook topic can describe the file’s purpose or content.
The more common document properties are standard and automatically updated 
properties. Standard properties are associated with all Microsoft Office files and 
include author, title, and subject. Automatically updated properties include file 
system properties, such as the date you create or change a file, and statistics, such as the 
file size.
To Change Document Properties
To change document properties, you would follow these steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view and then, 
if ­necessary, tap or click the Info tab in the Backstage view to display the Info 
gallery.
2.	 If the property you wish to change is displayed in the Properties list in the 
right pane of the Info gallery, try to tap or click to the right of the ­property. 
If a text box appears to the right of the property, type the text for the prop-
erty in the text box and then tap or click the Back button in the ­upper-left 
­corner of the Backstage view to return to the Excel window. Skip the 
remaining steps.
3.	 If the property you wish to change is not displayed in the Properties list in 
the right pane of the Info gallery or you cannot change it in the Info gallery, 
tap or click the Properties button in the right pane to display the Properties 
menu, and then tap or click ‘Show Document Panel’ on the Properties menu 
to close the Backstage view and display the Document Information Panel in 
the Excel workbook window.
Why are some of the document properties in my Document Information Panel 
already filled in? 
The person who installed Office 2013 on your computer or network may have set 
or customized the properties. 
Q&A
Why would you want to assign document properties to a workbook?
Document properties are valuable for a variety of reasons:
•	Users can save time locating a particular file because they can view a file’s document properties without opening  
the workbook.
•	By creating consistent properties for files having similar content, users can better organize their workbooks.
•	Some organizations require Excel users to add document properties so that other employees can view details about  
these files.

To Save an Existing Workbook with the Same File Name
You have made several modifications to the workbook since you last saved it. 
Thus, you should save it again. The following step saves the workbook again. For 
an example of the step listed below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this book.
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to overwrite the previously 
saved file.
Printing a Worksheet
After creating a worksheet, you may want to print it. Printing a worksheet enables you 
to distribute the worksheet to others in a form that can be read or viewed but typically 
not edited. It is a good practice to save a workbook before printing a worksheet, in the 
event you experience difficulties printing.
Q&A
BTW
Conserving Ink 
and Toner
If you want to conserve ink 
or toner, you can instruct 
Excel to print draft quality 
documents by tapping or 
clicking FILE on the ribbon 
to open the Backstage view, 
tapping or clicking Options in 
the Backstage view to display 
the Excel Options dialog 
box, tapping or clicking 
Advanced in the left pane 
(Excel Options dialog box), 
sliding or scrolling to the 
Print area in the right pane, 
placing a check mark in the 
‘Use draft quality’ check box, 
and then tapping or clicking 
the OK button. Then, use the 
Backstage view to print the 
document as usual.
What is the best method for distributing a workbook?
The traditional method of distributing a workbook uses a printer to produce a hard copy. A hard copy or printout is 
information that exists on a physical medium such as paper. Hard copies can be useful for the following reasons:
•	Some people prefer proofreading a hard copy of a workbook rather than viewing it on the screen to check for errors and 
readability.
•	Hard copies can serve as a backup reference if your storage medium is lost or becomes corrupted and you need to recreate 
the workbook. 
Instead of distributing a hard copy of a workbook, users can distribute the workbook as an electronic image that mirrors 
the original workbook’s appearance. The electronic image of the workbook can be sent as an email attachment, posted on a 
website, or copied to a portable storage medium such as a USB flash drive. Two popular electronic image formats, sometimes 
called fixed formats, are PDF by Adobe Systems and XPS by Microsoft. In Excel, you can create electronic image files through 
the Save As dialog box and the Export, Share, and Print tabs in the Backstage view. Electronic images of workbooks, such as 
PDF and XPS, can be useful for the following reasons:
•	Users can view electronic images of workbooks without the software that created the original workbook (e.g., Excel). 
Specifically, to view a PDF file, you use a program called Adobe Reader, which can be downloaded free from Adobe’s website. 
Similarly, to view an XPS file, you use a program called XPS Viewer, which is included in the latest versions of Windows and 
Internet Explorer.
•	Sending electronic workbooks saves paper and printer supplies. Society encourages users to contribute to green computing, 
which involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste generated when using computers, mobile devices, 
and related technologies.

Correcting Errors
You can correct errors on a worksheet using one of several methods. The method you

Correcting Errors while Entering Data into a Cell
If you notice an error while you are entering data into a cell, press the backspace 
key to erase the incorrect character(s) and then enter the correct character(s). If the 
error is a major one, tap or click the Cancel box in the formula bar or press the esc key 
to erase the entire entry and then reenter the data from the beginning.
Correcting Errors after Entering Data into a Cell
If you find an error in the worksheet after entering the data, you can correct the 
error in one of two ways:
1.	 If the entry is short, select the cell, retype the entry correctly, and then tap or click 
the Enter box or press the enter key. The new entry will replace the old entry.
2.	 If the entry in the cell is long and the errors are minor, using Edit mode may 
be a better choice than retyping the cell entry. Use Edit mode as described below.
	
a.  Double-tap or double-click the cell containing the error to switch Excel to 
Edit mode. In Edit mode, Excel displays the active cell entry in the formula 
bar and a flashing insertion point in the active cell. With Excel in Edit mode, 
you can edit the contents directly in the cell — a procedure called in-cell 
editing (Figure 1⁜– 71). 
Figure 1⁜– 71
in-cell editing
	
b.  Make changes using in-cell editing, as indicated below.
	
(1)  To insert new characters between two characters, place the insertion 
point between the two characters and begin typing. Excel inserts the 
new characters to the left of the insertion point.
	
(2)  To delete a character in the cell, move the insertion point to the left of the 
character you want to delete and then press the delete key, or place 
the insertion point to the right of the character you want to delete and 
then press the backspace key. You also can drag to select the character or 
adjacent characters you want to delete and then press the delete key or 
ctrl+x, or tap or click the Cut button (HOME tab | Clipboard group).
	
(3)  When you are finished editing an entry, tap or click the Enter box or 
press the enter key.
When Excel enters Edit mode, the keyboard usually is in Insert mode. In Insert 
mode, as you type a character, Excel inserts the character and moves all characters to 
the right of the typed character one position to the right. You can change to Overtype 
mode by pressing the insert key. In Overtype mode, Excel overtypes, or replaces, 
the character to the right of the insertion point. The insert key toggles the keyboard 
between Insert mode and Overtype mode.
While in Edit mode, you may have reason to move the insertion point to various 
points in the cell, select portions of the data in the cell, or switch from inserting 
characters to overtyping characters. Table 1⁜– 5 summarizes the more common tasks 
performed during in-cell editing.

Clearing a Cell or Range of Cells
If you enter data into the wrong cell or range of cells, you can erase, or clear, 
the data using one of the first four methods listed below. The fifth method clears the 
formatting from the selected cells. To clear a cell or range of cells, you would perform 
the following steps:
To Clear Cell Entries Using the Fill Handle
1.	 Select the cell or range of cells and then point to the fill handle so that the 
pointer changes to a crosshair.
2.	 Drag the fill handle back into the selected cell or range until a shadow covers 
the cell or cells you want to erase.
To Clear Cell Entries Using the Shortcut Menu
1.	 Select the cell or range of cells to be cleared.
2.	 Press and hold or right-click the selection.
3.	 Tap or click Clear Contents on the shortcut menu.
To Clear Cell Entries Using the Delete Key
1.	 Select the cell or range of cells to be cleared.
2.	 Press the delete key.
To Clear Cell Entries and Formatting Using the Clear Button
1.	 Select the cell or range of cells to be cleared.
2.	 Tap or click the Clear button (HOME tab | Editing group).
3.	 Tap or click Clear Contents on the menu.
To Clear Formatting Using the Cell Styles Button
1.	 Select the cell or range of cells from which you want to remove the 
formatting.
2.	 Tap or click the Cell Styles button (HOME tab | Styles group) and point to 
Normal.
3.	 Tap or click Normal in the Cell Styles gallery.
The Clear All command on the Clear menu is the only command that clears 
both the cell entry and the cell formatting. As you are clearing cell entries, always 
remember that you should never press the spacebar to clear a cell. Pressing the 
spacebar enters a blank character. A blank character is text and is different from an 
empty cell, even though the cell may appear empty.
Clearing the Entire Worksheet
If the required worksheet edits are extremely extensive or if the requirements 
drastically change, you may want to clear the entire worksheet and start over. To clear 
the worksheet or delete an embedded chart, you would use the following steps.
To Clear the Entire Worksheet
1.	 Tap or click the Select All button on the worksheet.
2.	 Tap or click the Clear button (HOME tab | Editing group) and then tap or 
click Clear All on the menu to delete both the entries and formats.

The new topics covered in this chapter include using formulas and functions 
to create a worksheet. A function is a prewritten formula that is built into Excel. 
Other new topics include option buttons, verifying formulas, applying a theme to a 
worksheet, borders, formatting numbers and text, conditional formatting, changing the 
widths of columns and heights of rows, spell checking, alternative types of worksheet 
displays and printouts, and adding page headers and footers to a worksheet. One 
alternative worksheet display and printout shows the formulas in the worksheet instead 
of the values. When you display the formulas in the worksheet, you see exactly what 
text, data, formulas, and functions you have entered into it. 
Project — Worksheet with Formulas  
and Functions
The project in this chapter follows proper design guidelines and uses Excel to create 
the worksheet shown in Figure 2 – 1. HyperMass Online Storage established its 
online website to provide online storage for its customers. The owners pay employees 
to maintain the servers and handle customer requests. Before the owners pay the 
employees, they summarize the hours worked, pay rate, and tax information for 
each employee to ensure that the business properly compensates its employees. This 
summary includes information such as the employee names, number of dependents, 
hours worked, hourly pay rate, tax information, net pay, and hire date. As the 
complexity of the task of creating the summary increases, the owners want to use  
Excel to create a salary report.

Recall that the first step in creating an effective worksheet is to make sure you 
understand what is required. The people who will use the worksheet usually provide 
the requirements. The requirements document for the HyperMass Online Storage 
Salary Report worksheet includes the following needs: source of data, summary of 
calculations, and other facts about its development (Figure 2 – 2). 
Figure 2 – 1
Worksheet Title
HyperMass Online Storage Salary Report
Needs
An easy-to-read worksheet that summarizes the company’s salary report (Figure 2 – 3 on the next page).  
For each employee, the worksheet is to include the employee’s name, dependents, hours worked, hourly 
pay rate, gross pay, federal tax, state tax, total tax percent, net pay, and hire date. The worksheet also should 
include totals and the highest value, lowest value, and average for the columns of numbers specified below.
Source of Data
The data supplied includes the employee names, dependents, hours worked, hourly pay rate, and  
hire dates.
Calculations
The following calculations must be made for each of the employees:
1.  Gross Pay = Hours Worked 3 Hourly Pay Rate
2.  Federal Tax = 0.22 3 (Gross Pay 2 Dependents * 24.32)
3.  State Tax = 0.04 3 Gross Pay
4.  Tax % = (Federal Tax + State Tax) / Gross Pay
5.  Net Pay = Gross Pay 2 (Federal Tax + State Tax)
6.  Compute the totals for hours worked, gross pay, federal tax, state tax, and net pay
7.  Compute the total tax percent
8.  Use the MAX and MIN functions to determine the highest and lowest values for dependents, hours 
worked, hourly pay rate, gross pay, federal tax, state tax, total tax percent, and net pay
9.  Use the AVERAGE function to determine the average for hours worked, dependents, hourly pay rate, 
gross pay, federal tax, state tax, and net pay

In addition, using a sketch of the worksheet can help you visualize its design. The 
sketch for the HyperMass Online Storage Salary Report worksheet includes a title, a 
subtitle, column and row headings, and the location of data values (Figure 2 – 3). It also 
uses specific characters to define the desired formatting for the worksheet, as follows:
1.	 The row of Xs below the leftmost column heading defines the cell entries as text, 
such as employee names.
2.	 The rows of Zs and 9s with slashes, dollar signs, decimal points, commas, and 
percent signs in the remaining columns define the cell entries as numbers. 
The Zs indicate that the selected format should instruct Excel to suppress 
leading 0s. The 9s indicate that the selected format should instruct Excel to 
display any digits, including 0s. 
3.	 The decimal point means that a decimal point should appear in the cell entry 
and indicates the number of decimal places to use.
4.	 The slashes in the last column identify the cell entry as a date.
5.	 The dollar signs that are adjacent to the Zs below the totals row signify a 
floating dollar sign, or one that appears next to the first significant digit.
6.	 The commas indicate that the selected format should instruct Excel to display 
a comma separator only if the number has sufficient digits (values in the 
thousandths) to the left of the decimal point.
7.	 The percent sign (%) in the Tax % column indicates a percent sign should 
appear after the number.
Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to use functions and create formulas.

To Enter the Salary Data
The salary data in Table 2⁜–⁜1 includes a hire date for each employee. Excel 
considers a date to be a number and, therefore, it displays the date right-aligned in the 
cell. The following steps enter the data for each employee: name, dependents, hours 
worked, hourly pay rate, and hire date. 
	1	
Select cell A4. Type   Carl, Michael   and then press the right arrow key to enter 
the employee name. 
	2	
Type   3   in cell B4 and then press the right arrow key to enter a number in the 
selected cell.
	3	
Type   60.45   in cell C4 and then press the right arrow key to enter a number in the 
selected cell.
	4	
Type   19.50   in cell D4 and then press the right arrow key to enter a number in the 
selected cell. 
	5	
Type   4/5/10   in cell J4 and then tap or click cell A5 to select the cell.
	6	
Enter the payroll data in Table 2 – 1 for the eight remaining employees in rows 5 
through 12 (shown in Figure 2 – 4 on page 72).
In Step 5, why did the date that was entered change from 4/5/10 to 4/5/2010?
When Excel recognizes that you entered a date in mm/dd/yy format, it automatically 
formats the date as mm/dd/yyyy for you. Most professionals prefer to view dates in  
mm/dd/yyyy format as opposed to mm/dd/yy format because the latter can cause confusion 
regarding the intended year. For example, a date displayed as 3/3/50 could imply a date 
of 3/3/1950 or 3/3/2050. The use of a four-digit year eliminates this confusion.

Entering Formulas
One of the reasons Excel is such a valuable tool is that you can assign a formula to a cell, 
and Excel will calculate the result. Consider, for example, what would happen if you had 
to multiply 60.45 by 19.5 and then manually enter the product for Gross Pay, 1,178.78, in 
cell E4. Every time the values in cells C4 or D4 changed, you would have to recalculate 
the product and enter the new value in cell E4. By contrast, if you enter a formula in cell 
E4 to multiply the values in cells C4 and D4, Excel recalculates the product whenever 
new values are entered into those cells and displays the result in cell E4. 
A formula in a cell that contains a reference back to itself is called a circular 
reference. Excel often warns you when you create a circular reference. In almost all 
cases, circular references are the result of an incorrect formula. A circular reference 
can be direct or indirect. For example, placing the formula =A1 in cell A1 results in 
a direct circular reference. An indirect circular reference occurs when a formula 
in a cell refers to another cell or cells that include a formula that refers back to the 
original cell. 
To Enter a Formula Using the Keyboard
The formulas needed in the worksheet are noted in the requirements document as follows:
1.	 Gross Pay (column E) = Hours Worked × Hourly Pay Rate
2.	 Federal Tax (column F) = 0.22 × (Gross Pay – Dependents × 24.32)
3.	 State Tax (column G) = 0.04 × Gross Pay
4.	 Tax % (column H) = (Federal Tax + State Tax) / Gross Pay 
5.	 Net Pay (column I) = Gross Pay – (Federal Tax + State Tax)

EX 74   Excel Chapter 2   Formulas, Functions, and Formatting  
The gross pay for each employee, which appears in column E, is equal to hours worked in column C times 
hourly pay rate in column D. Thus, the gross pay for Michael Carl in cell E4 is obtained by multiplying 60.45 
(cell C4) by 19.50 (cell D4) or =C4 × D4. The following steps enter the initial gross pay formula in cell E4 using 
the keyboard. Why? In order for Excel to perform the calculations, you must create formulas.

•	With cell E4 selected, 
type   =c4*d4   in 
the cell to display 
the formula in the 
formula bar and in 
the current cell and 
to display colored 
borders around the 
cells referenced 
in the formula 
(Figure 2 – 5).
What occurs on the 
worksheet as I enter 
the formula?
The equal sign (=) 
preceding c4*d4 
alerts Excel that 
you are entering 
a formula or 
function and not 
text. Because the 
most common error 
when entering a formula is to reference the wrong cell in a formula mistakenly, Excel colors the borders of the cells 
referenced in the formula. The coloring helps in the reviewing process to ensure the cell references are correct. 
The asterisk (*) following c4 is the arithmetic operator that directs Excel to perform the multiplication operation.

arithmetic operations easily and efficiently. Table 2⁜–⁜2 describes multiplication and 
other valid Excel arithmetic operators.

Subtracts the contents of cell F15 from 22
Order of Operations
When more than one arithmetic operator is involved in a formula, Excel follows 
the same basic order of operations that you use in algebra. Moving from left to right in a 
formula, the order of operations is as follows: first negation (–), then all percentages (%), 
then all exponentiations (^), then all multiplications (*) and divisions (/), and finally, all 
additions (+) and subtractions (–).
As in algebra, you can use parentheses to override the order of operations. 
For example, if Excel follows the order of operations, 8 * 3 + 2 equals 26. If you use 
parentheses, however, to change the formula to 8 * (3 + 2), the result is 40, because the 
parentheses instruct Excel to add 3 and 2 before multiplying by 8. Table 2⁜–⁜3 illustrates 
several examples of valid Excel formulas and explains the order of operations.

Assigns 100 plus the contents of cell D2 to the active cell. 
=25% * 40
Assigns the product of 0.25 times 40 (or 10) to the active cell.
– (K15 * X45)
Assigns the negative value of the product of the values contained in cells K15 
and X45 to the active cell. You do not need to type an equal sign before an 
expression that begins with minus signs, which indicates a negation.

A5 = 6, G9 = 2, J7 = 6, L7 = 4, M6 = 5, and Z2 = 2, then Excel assigns the 
active cell the value –5; that is, 6 / 6 + 2 * 5 – 2 ^ 4 = –5.

To Enter Formulas Using Point Mode
The sketch of the worksheet in Figure 2 – 3 on page EX 68 calls for the federal tax, state tax, tax percent, 
and net pay for each employee to appear in columns F, G, H, and I, respectively. All four of these values are 
calculated using formulas in row 4: 
Federal Tax (cell F4) = 0.22 × (Gross Pay – Dependents × 24.32) or =0.22 * (E4 – B4 * 24.32)
State Tax (cell G4) = 0.04 × Gross Pay or =0.04 * E4
Tax % (cell H4) = (Federal Tax + State Tax) / Gross Pay or =(F4 + G4)/E4
Net Pay (cell I4) = Gross Pay – (Federal Tax + State Tax) or =E4 – (F4 + G4)
An alternative to entering the formulas in cells F4, G4, H4, and I4 using the keyboard is to enter the 
formulas using the pointer and Point mode. Point mode allows you to select cells for use in a formula by using 
your finger or the pointer. The following steps enter formulas using Point mode. Why? Using Point mode makes it 
easier to create formulas without worrying about typographical errors when entering cell references.

Using Point mode 
to enter formulas 
often is faster and 
more accurate 
than using the 
keyboard to type 
the entire formula when the cell you want to select does not require you to scroll. In many instances, as in these 
steps, you may want to use both the keyboard and touch gestures or the pointer when entering a formula in a cell. 
You can use the keyboard to begin the formula, for example, and then use touch gestures or the pointer to select a 
range of cells.

To Copy Formulas Using the Fill Handle
The five formulas for Michael Carl in cells E4, F4, G4, H4, and I4 now are 
complete. The next step is to copy them to the range E5:I12. When performing 
copying operations in Excel, the source area is the cell, or range, from which data or 
formulas are being copied. When a range is used as a source, it sometimes is called 
the source range. The destination area is the cell, or range, to which data or formulas 
are being copied. When a range is used as a destination, it sometimes is called the 
destination range. Recall from Chapter 1 that the fill handle is a small black square in 
the lower-right corner of the active cell or active range. The following steps copy the 
formulas using the fill handle.
	1	
Select the source range, E4:I4 in this case, activate the fill handle, drag the fill handle 
down through cell I12, and then continue to hold your finger or the mouse button to 
select the destination range.
	2	
Lift your finger or release the mouse button to copy the formulas to the destination 
range (Figure 2 – 12).
How does Excel adjust the cell references in the formulas in the destination area?
Recall that when you copy a formula, Excel adjusts the cell references so that the new 
formulas contain references corresponding to the new location and perform calculations 
using the appropriate values. Thus, if you copy downward, Excel adjusts the row portion 
of cell references. If you copy across, then Excel adjusts the column portion of cell 
references. These cell references are called relative cell references.

Option Buttons
Excel displays Option buttons in a workbook while you are working on it to indicate 
that you can complete an operation using automatic features such as AutoCorrect, 
Auto Fill, error checking, and others. For example, the ‘Auto Fill Options’ button 
shown in Figure 2 – 12 appears after a fill operation, such as dragging the fill handle. 
When an error occurs in a formula in a cell, Excel displays the Trace Error button next 
to the cell and identifies the cell with the error by placing a green triangle in the upper 
left of the cell.
Table 2 – 4 summarizes the Option buttons available in Excel. When one of these 
buttons appears on your worksheet, tap or click its arrow to produce the list of options 
for modifying the operation or to obtain additional information.

To Determine Totals Using the Sum Button
The next step is to determine the totals in row 13 for the hours worked in 
column C, gross pay in column E, federal tax in column F, state tax in column G, and 
net pay in column I. To determine the total hours worked in column C, the values in 
the range C4 through C12 must be summed. To do so, enter the function =sum(c4:c12) 
in cell C13 or select cell C13, tap or click the Sum button (HOME tab | Editing 
group), and then press the enter key. Recall that a function is a prewritten formula that 
is built into Excel. Similar SUM functions can be used in cells E13, F13, G13, and I13 
to total gross pay, federal tax, state tax, and net pay, respectively. The following steps 
determine totals in cell C13, the range E13:G13, and cell I13.
	1	
Select the cell to contain the sum, cell C13 in this case. Tap or click the Sum button 
(HOME tab | Editing group) to sum the contents of the range C4:C12 in cell C13 and 
then tap or click the Enter box to display a total in the selected cell. 
	2	
Select the range to contain the sums, range E13:G13 in this case. Tap or click the Sum 
button (HOME tab | Editing group) to display totals in the selected range.

Select the cell to contain the sum, cell I13 in this case. Tap or click the Sum button 
(HOME tab | Editing group) to sum the contents of the range I4:I12 in cell I13 and then 
tap or click the Enter box to display a total in the selected cell (Figure 2 – 13).
Why did I have to tap or click the Enter box? 
When creating a sum for a single column, you tap or click the Enter box. If you are 
calculating the sum for multiple ranges, you tap or click the Sum button.
Q&A
The Paste Options button provides powerful functionality. When performing copy and paste operations, the button allows you 
great freedom in specifying what it is you want to paste. You can choose from the following options:
•	Paste an exact copy of what you copied, including the cell contents and formatting. 
•	Copy only formulas.
•	Copy only formatting.
•	Copy only values.
•	Copy a combination of these options.
•	Copy a picture of what you copied.

With the totals in row 13 determined, the next step is to copy the tax percentage 
formula in cell H12 to cell H13. The following step copies the tax percentage formula.

Select the cell to be copied, H12 in this case, and then drag the fill handle down 
through cell H13 to copy the formula (Figure 2 – 14).
Why was the SUM function not used for tax percentage in H13? 
The tax percentage is based off of the totals, not the sum, of the tax percentage column; 
therefore, there was no need to use the SUM function.

Using the AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN Functions
The next step in creating the HyperMass Online Storage Salary Report worksheet 
is to compute the highest value, lowest value, and average value for the number of 
dependents listed in the range B4:B12 using the MAX, MIN, and AVERAGE functions 
in the range B14:B16. Once the values are determined for column B, the entries can be 
copied across to the other columns. 
With Excel, you can enter functions using one of five methods: (1) keyboard, 
touch gesture, or pointer; (2) the Insert Function box in the formula bar; (3) the Sum 
menu; (4) the Sum button (FORMULAS tab | Function Library group); and (5) the 
Name box area in the formula bar. The method you choose will depend on your typing 
skills and whether you can recall the function name and required arguments. 
In the following sections, three of these methods will be used. The Insert 
Function box in the formula bar method will be used to determine the highest number 
of dependents (cell B14). The Sum menu will be used to determine the lowest number 
of dependents (cell B15). The keyboard and pointer will be used to determine the 
average number of dependents (cell B16).

To Determine the Highest Number in a Range  
of Numbers Using the Insert Function Box
The next step is to select cell B14 and determine the highest (maximum) number in the range B4:B12. 
Excel includes a function called the MAX function that displays the highest value in a range. The following 
steps use the Insert Function box in the formula bar to enter the MAX function. Why? Although you could enter 
the MAX function using the keyboard and Point mode as described previously, an alternative method to entering the 
function is to use the Insert Function box in the formula bar.
1
•	Select the cell to contain the maximum number, cell B14 in this case.
•	Tap or click the Insert Function box in the formula bar to display the Insert Function dialog box.
•	If necessary, scroll to and then tap or click MAX in the Select a function list (Insert Function dialog box) to select it 
(Figure 2 – 15).

Click the ‘Or select a category’ arrow to display the list of function categories, select All, and then scroll down and 
select the MAX function in the Select a function list.
How can I learn about other functions?
Excel has more than 400 additional functions that perform nearly every type of calculation you can imagine. 
These functions are categorized in the Insert Function dialog box shown in Figure 2 – 15. To view the categories,  
tap or click the ‘Or select a category’ arrow. To obtain a description of a selected function, select its name in the

Select cell H16 and then press the delete key to delete the average of the tax % 
(Figure 2 – 25).
Why delete the formula in cell H16?
The average of the tax percentage in cell H16 is deleted because an average of 
percentages of this type is mathematically invalid.
How can I be sure that the function arguments are proper for the cells in range C14:I16?
Remember that Excel adjusts the cell references in the copied functions so that each 
function refers to the range of numbers above it in the same column. Review the numbers 
in rows 14 through 16 in Figure 2 – 25. You should see that the functions in each column 
return the appropriate values, based on the numbers in rows 4 through 12 of that column.

Verifying Formulas Using Range Finder
One of the more common mistakes made with Excel is to include an incorrect cell 
reference in a formula. An easy way to verify that a formula references the cells you 
want it to reference is to use Range Finder. Range Finder checks which cells are 
referenced in the formula assigned to the active cell. 
To use Range Finder to verify that a formula contains the intended cell 
references, double-tap or double-click the cell with the formula you want to check. 
Excel responds by highlighting the cells referenced in the formula so that you can 
verify that the cell references are correct. 
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Excel now. To resume at a later 
time, run Excel, open the file called HyperMass Online Storage Salary Report, and continue following the steps from 
this location forward.

To Verify a Formula Using Range Finder
Why? Range Finder allows you to make immediate changes to the cells referenced in a formula. The following 
steps use Range Finder to check the formula in cell H4.
1
•	Double-tap or 
double-click cell H4 
to activate Range 
Finder (Figure 2 – 26).
2
•	Press the esc key to 
quit Range Finder 
and then tap or click 
anywhere in the 
worksheet, such as 
cell A18, to deselect 
the current cell.

Formatting the Worksheet
Although the worksheet contains the appropriate data, formulas, and functions,  
the text and numbers need to be formatted to improve their appearance and 
readability.

(b) Formatted Worksheet
(a) Unformatted Worksheet
In Chapter 1, cell styles were used to format much of the worksheet. This 
section describes how to change the unformatted worksheet in Figure 2 – 27a to the 
formatted worksheet in Figure 2 – 27b using a theme and other commands on the 
ribbon. The colors and fonts that are used in the worksheet shown in Figure 2 – 27b 
are those that are associated with the Basis theme. 
The following outlines the formatting suggested in the sketch of the worksheet 
in Figure 2 – 3 on page EX 68.
1.	 Workbook theme — Basis
2.	 Worksheet title and subtitle
a.	 Alignment — center across columns A through J 
b.	 Cell style — Title
c.	 Font size — title 18; subtitle 16
d.	 Background color (range A1:J2) — Green, Accent 1, Lighter 60%
e.	 Border — thick box border around range A1:J2
3.	 Column titles
a.	 Cell style — Heading 3
b.	 Alignment — center
4.	 Data
a.	 Dates in column J — mm/dd/yy format
b.	 Alignment — center data in range B4:B16
c.	 Numbers in column C — comma style and two decimal places; if a cell in 
range C4:C12 is greater than 70, then cell appears with background color of 
orange and a font color of white
d.	 Numbers in top row (D4:G4, I4) — accounting number format
e.	 Numbers below top row (D5:G12) — comma style and decimal places

To Change the Workbook Theme
Why? The Basis theme includes fonts and colors that provide the worksheet with a professional and subtly colored 
appearance. The following steps change the workbook theme to the Basis theme.
1
•	Display the PAGE 
LAYOUT tab.
•	Tap or click the 
Themes button 
(PAGE LAYOUT 
tab | Themes 
group) to display 
the Themes gallery 
(Figure 2 – 28).
 Experiment
•	Point to several 
themes in the 
Themes gallery to 
see a live preview of 
the themes.
Why should I change 
the theme of a 
workbook?
A company or 
department may 
standardize with 
a specific theme so that all of their documents have a similar appearance. Similarly, an individual may want to 
have a theme that sets his or her work apart from the work of others. Other Office programs, such as Word and 
PowerPoint, include the same themes included with Excel, meaning that all of your Microsoft Office documents can 
share a common theme.

•	Tap or click Basis in 
the Themes gallery 
to change the 
workbook theme 
(Figure 2 – 29).
Why did the cells 
in the worksheet 
change?
The cells in the 
worksheet originally 
were formatted with 
the default font for 
the default Office 
theme. The default 
font for the Basis 
theme is different 
from that of the 
default font for the 
Office theme and, 
therefore, changed 
on the worksheet 
when you changed 
the theme. If you had 
modified the font for any of the cells, those cells would  
not be formatted with the default font for the Basis theme.

To Format the Worksheet Titles
The following steps merge and center the worksheet titles, apply the Title cells 
style to the worksheet titles, and decrease the font of the worksheet subtitle.
	1	
Display the HOME tab.
	2	
Select the range to be merged, A1:J1 in this case, and then tap or click the ‘Merge & 
Center’ button (HOME tab | Alignment group) to merge and center the text in the 
selected range.
	3	
Select the range A2:J2 and then tap or click the ‘Merge & Center’ button (HOME tab |

	4	
Select the range to contain the Title cell style, in this case A1:A2, tap or click the Cell 
Styles button (HOME tab | Styles group) to display the Cell Styles gallery, and then tap 
or click the Title cell style in the Cell Styles gallery to apply the Title cell style to the 
selected range.
	5	
Select cell A2 and then tap or click the ‘Decrease Font Size’ button (HOME tab | Font 
group) to decrease the font size of the selected cell to the next lowest font size 
(Figure 2 – 30).
What is the effect of tapping or clicking the ‘Decrease Font Size’ button?
When you tap or click the ‘Decrease Font Size’ button, Excel assigns the next lowest font 
size in the Font Size gallery to the selected range. The ‘Increase Font Size’ button works 
in a similar manner, but causes Excel to assign the next highest font size in the Font Size 
gallery to the selected range.

To Change the Background Color and Apply  
a Box Border to the Worksheet Title and Subtitle
Why? A background color and border can draw attention to the title of a worksheet. The final formats assigned 
to the worksheet title and subtitle are the green background color and thick box border (Figure 2 – 27b on  
page EX 90). The following steps complete the formatting of the worksheet titles.

Which colors should you select when formatting your worksheet?
Knowing how people perceive colors helps you emphasize parts of your worksheet. Warmer colors (red and orange) tend to 
reach toward the reader. Cooler colors (blue, green, and violet) tend to pull away from the reader. Bright colors jump out of a 
dark background and are easiest to see. White or yellow text on a dark blue, green, purple, or black background is ideal.

Formatting Numbers Using the Ribbon
As shown in Figure 2 – 27b on page EX 90, the worksheet is formatted to 
resemble an accounting report. For example, in columns D through G and I, the 
numbers in the first row (row 4), the totals row (row 13), and the rows below the 
totals (rows 14 through 16) have dollar signs, while the remaining numbers (rows 5 
through 12) in columns D through G and column I do not. 
To Apply an Accounting Number Format and  
Comma Style Format Using the Ribbon
The following steps assign formats using the ‘Accounting Number Format’ button and the Comma Style 
button. The accounting number format is applied to the currency amounts in rows 4 and 13. The comma style 
format is applied to the range E5:G12 and to range I5:I12, and to column C (Hours Worked). Why? This gives 
the worksheet a more professional look.
1
•	Select the range to contain the 
accounting number format, cells 
D4:G4 in this case.
•	While holding down the ctrl 
key, select cell I4, the range 
E13:G13, and cell I13 to select the 
nonadjacent ranges and cells.
•	Tap or click the ‘Accounting 
Number Format’ button (HOME 
tab | Number group) to apply the 
accounting number format with 
fixed dollar signs to the selected 
nonadjacent ranges (Figure 2 – 38).
What is the effect of applying the 
accounting number format?
The ‘Accounting Number Format’ 
button assigns a fixed dollar sign 
to the numbers in the ranges. In each 
cell in these ranges, Excel displays the dollar sign to the  
far left with spaces between it and the first digit in the cell.

•	Select the ranges to contain the 
comma style format, cells D5:G12 
and I5:I12 in this case.
•	Tap or click the Comma Style

To Apply a Currency Style Format with a Floating  
Dollar Sign Using the Format Cells Dialog Box
Why? The Format Cells dialog box can be used to apply formatting that is not available directly on the ribbon. 
The following steps use the Format Cells dialog box to apply the currency style format with a floating dollar 
sign to the numbers in the ranges D14:G16 and I14:I16.
1
•	Select the ranges (D14:G16 and 
I14:I16) and then tap or click 
the Number Format Dialog Box 
Launcher (HOME tab | Number 
group) to display the Format Cells 
dialog box.
•	If necessary, tap or click the 
Number tab to display the Number 
sheet (Format Cells dialog box).
•	Tap or click Currency in the 
Category list to select the 
necessary number format category 
and then tap or click the third 
style ($1,234.10) in the Negative 
numbers list to select the desired 
currency format for negative 
numbers (Figure 2 – 41).
How do I select the proper 
format?
You can choose from 12 categories 
of formats. Once you select a 
category, you can select the number 
of decimal places, whether or not a dollar sign should be displayed, and how negative numbers should appear. 
Selecting the appropriate negative numbers format is important, because doing so adds a space to the right of 
the number in order to align the numbers in the worksheet on the decimal points. Some of the available negative 
number formats do not align the numbers in the worksheet on the decimal points.

To Apply a Percent Style Format and  
Use the Increase Decimal Button
The next step is to format the tax percentage in column H. Why? Currently, Excel displays the numbers 
as decimal fractions when they should appear as percentages. The following steps format the range H4:H16 to the 
percent style format with two decimal places.
1
•	Select the range to format, cells 
H4:H16 in this case.
•	Tap or click the Percent Style 
button (HOME tab | Number 
group) to display the numbers in 
the selected range as a rounded 
whole percent.
What is the result of tapping or 
clicking the Percent Style button?
The Percent Style button instructs 
Excel to display a value as a 
percentage, determined by 
multiplying the cell entry by 100, 
rounding the result to the nearest 
percent, and adding a percent 
sign. For example, when cell H4 is 
formatted using the Percent Style 
buttons, Excel displays the actual 
value 0.246383 as 25%.

Changing Column Width and Row Height
When Excel starts and displays a blank worksheet on the screen, all of the 
columns have a default width of 8.43 characters, or 64 pixels. These values may change 
depending on the theme applied to the workbook. For example, in this chapter, the 
Basis theme was applied to the workbook, resulting in columns having a default width 
of 8.38 characters. A character is defined as a letter, number, symbol, or punctuation 
mark in 11-point Calibri font, the default font used by Excel. An average of 8.43 
characters in 11-point Calibri font will fit in a cell. 
Another measure of the height and width of cells is pixels. A pixel, which is short 
for picture element, is a dot on the screen that contains a color. The size of the dot is based 
on your screen’s resolution. At the resolution of 1366 3 768 used in this book, 1366 pixels 
appear across the screen and 768 pixels appear down the screen for a total of 1,049,088 
pixels. It is these 1,049,088 pixels that form the font and other items you see on the screen.
The default row height in a blank worksheet is 15 points (or 20 pixels). Recall 
from Chapter 1 that a point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Thus, 15 points is equal to 
about 1/5 of an inch. You can change the width of the columns or height of the rows at 
any time to make the worksheet easier to read or to ensure that Excel displays an entry 
properly in a cell.

Conditional Formatting Operators
As shown in Figure 2 – 48, the second text box in the Edit the Rule Description 
area in the New Formatting Rule dialog box allows you to select a relational operator, 
such as less than, to use in the condition. The eight different relational operators from 
which you can choose for conditional formatting in the New Formatting Rule dialog 
box are summarized in Table 2 – 5.
To Change Column Width
When changing the column width, you can set the width manually or you can instruct Excel to size the 
column to best fit. Best fit means that the width of the column will be increased or decreased so that the widest 
entry will fit in the column. Why? Sometimes, you may prefer more or less white space in a column than best fit provides. 
To change the white space, Excel allows you to change column widths manually.
When the format you assign to a cell causes the entry to exceed the width of a column, Excel automatically 
changes the column width to best fit. If you do not assign a format to a cell or cells in a column, the column 
width will remain 8.43 characters. To set a column width to best fit, double-tap or double-click the right 
boundary of the column heading above row 1.
The steps on the following pages change the column widths as follows: column A and B to best fit; column G 
to 10.25 characters; columns C, D, and H to 7.50 characters; and columns E, F, and I to 10.50 characters.

What happens if I change the column width to zero (0)?
If you decrease the column width to 0, the column is hidden. Hiding cells is a technique you can use to hide data 
that might not be relevant to a particular report or sensitive data that you do not want others to see. To instruct 
Excel to display a hidden column, position the mouse pointer to the right of the column heading boundary where

To Change Row Height
Why? You also can increase or decrease the height of a row manually to improve the appearance of the worksheet. 
When you increase the font size of a cell entry, such as the title in cell A1, Excel automatically increases the row 
height to best fit so that it can display the characters properly. Recall that Excel did this earlier when multiple 
lines were entered in a cell in row 3, and when the cell style of the worksheet title and subtitle was changed. The 
following steps improve the appearance of the worksheet by increasing the height of row 3 to 48.00 points and 
increasing the height of row 14 to 27.00 points.

•	Tap or point to the 
boundary below row 
heading 3 until the

Checking Spelling
Excel includes a spell checker you can use to check a worksheet for spelling errors. 
The spell checker looks for spelling errors by comparing words on the worksheet 
against words contained in its standard dictionary. If you often use specialized terms 
that are not in the standard dictionary, you may want to add them to a custom 
dictionary using the Spelling dialog box.
When the spell checker finds a word that is not in either dictionary, it displays 
the word in the Spelling dialog box. You then can correct it if it is misspelled.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. Be sure to save the HyperMass Online Storage 
Salary Report file again and then you can exit Excel. To resume at a later time, run Excel, open the file called 
HyperMass Online Storage Salary Report, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Does the spell checker catch all spelling mistakes?
While Excel’s spell checker is a valuable tool, it is not infallible. You should proofread your workbook carefully by pointing to 
each word and saying it aloud as you point to it. Be mindful of misused words such as its and it’s, through and though, and to 
and too. Nothing undermines a good impression more than a professional looking report with misspelled words.

EX 108   Excel Chapter 2   Formulas, Functions, and Formatting  
To Check Spelling on the Worksheet
Why? Everything on a worksheet should be spell checked to make sure it is as accurate as possible. To illustrate how 
Excel responds to a misspelled word, the following steps purposely misspell the word, Employee, in cell A3 as 
the word, Empolyee, as shown in Figure 2 – 57.
1
•	Tap or click cell A3 and then type   Empolyee   to misspell the word, Employee.
•	Select cell A2 so that the spell checker begins checking at the selected cell.
•	Tap or click REVIEW on the ribbon to display the REVIEW tab.
•	Tap or click the Spelling button (REVIEW tab | Proofing group) to run the spell checker and display  
the misspelled word in the Spelling dialog box (Figure 2 – 57).
What happens when the spell checker finds a misspelled word?
When the spell checker identifies that a cell contains a word not in its standard or custom dictionary, it selects that 
cell as the active cell and displays the Spelling dialog box. The Spelling dialog box lists the word not found in the 
dictionary and a list of suggested corrections (Figure 2 – 58).

•	Tap or click anywhere in the worksheet, such as cell A18, to deselect the current cell.
•	Display the HOME tab.
•	Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to save the workbook.
What other actions can I take in the Spelling dialog box?
If one of the words in the Suggestions list is correct, tap or click it and then tap or click the Change button. If 
none of the suggestions is correct, type the correct word in the Not in Dictionary text box and then tap or click the 
Change button. To change the word throughout the worksheet, tap or click the Change All button instead of the 
Change button. To skip correcting the word, tap or click the Ignore Once button. To have Excel ignore the word for 
the remainder of the worksheet, tap or click the Ignore All button.

Additional Spell Checker Considerations
Consider these additional guidelines when using the spell checker:
•	To check the spelling of the text in a single cell, double-tap or double-click the 
cell to make the formula bar active and then tap or click the Spelling button 
(REVIEW tab | Proofing group).
•	If you select a single cell so that the formula bar is not active and then start the 
spell checker, Excel checks the remainder of the worksheet, including notes and 
embedded charts.
•	If you select a cell other than cell A1 before you start the spell checker, Excel will 
display a dialog box when the spell checker reaches the end of the worksheet, 
asking if you want to continue checking at the beginning.
•	If you select a range of cells before starting the spell checker, Excel checks the 
spelling of the words only in the selected range.
•	To check the spelling of all the sheets in a workbook, press and hold or right-click 
any sheet tab, tap or click ‘Select All Sheets’ on the sheet tab shortcut menu, and 
then start the spell checker. 
•	To add words to the dictionary, such as your last name, tap or click the ‘Add to 
Dictionary’ button in the Spelling dialog box (shown in Figure 2 – 58) when Excel 
flags the word as not being in the dictionary.
•	Tap or click the AutoCorrect button (shown in Figure 2 – 58) to add the 
misspelled word and the correct version of the word to the AutoCorrect list. For 
example, suppose that you misspell the word, do, as the word, dox. When the 
spell checker displays the Spelling dialog box with the correct word, do, in the 
Suggestions list, tap or click the AutoCorrect button. Then, anytime in the future 
that you type the word, dox, Excel automatically will change it to the word, do.

EX 110   Excel Chapter 2   Formulas, Functions, and Formatting  
Printing the Worksheet
Excel allows for a great deal of customization in how a worksheet appears when 
printed. For example, the margins on the page can be adjusted. A header or footer 
can be added to each printed page, as well. A header is text and graphics that print at 
the top of each page. Similarly, a footer is text and graphics that print at the bottom 
of each page. Excel also has the capability to work on the worksheet in Page Layout 
view. Page Layout view allows you to create or modify a worksheet while viewing how 
it will look in printed format. The default view that you have worked in up until this 
point in the book is called Normal view.
To Change the Worksheet’s Margins, Header,  
and Orientation in Page Layout View
The following steps change to Page Layout view, narrow the margins of the worksheet, change the 
header of the worksheet, and set the orientation of the worksheet to landscape. Why? Often, you may want to 
reduce margins so that the printed worksheet better fits the page. Changing the header helps to identify the content on 
each page, and changing the orientation can help you fit wider printouts across a sheet of paper. Margins are those 
portions of a printed page outside the main body of the printed document and always are blank when printed. 
The current worksheet is too wide for a single page and requires landscape orientation to fit on one page in a 
readable manner.
1
•	Tap or click the Page Layout button on the status bar to view the worksheet in Page Layout view (Figure 2 – 59).
What are some key features of Page Layout view?
Page Layout view shows the worksheet divided into pages. A gray background separates each page. The white 
areas surrounding each page indicate the print margins. The top of each page includes a Header area, and the 
bottom of each page includes a Footer area. Page Layout view also includes a ruler at the top of the page that 
assists you in placing objects on the page, such as charts and pictures.

To Print a Section of the Worksheet
You can print portions of the worksheet by selecting the range of cells to print and then tapping or 
clicking the Selection option button in the Print what area in the Print dialog box. Why? To save paper, you only 
want to print the portion of the worksheet you need, instead of printing the entire worksheet. The following steps print 
the range A3:E16.
1
•	Select the range to print, cells A3:E16 in this case.
•	Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view.
•	Tap or click the Print tab to display the Print gallery.
•	Tap or click ‘Print Active Sheets’ in the Settings area (Print tab | Print gallery) to display a list of options that 
determine what Excel should print (Figure 2 – 65).
Figure 2 – 65

•	Tap or click Print Selection to instruct Excel to print only the selected range.
•	Tap or click the Print button in the Print gallery to print the selected range of the worksheet on the currently 
selected printer (Figure 2 – 66).
•	Tap or click the Normal button on the status bar to return to Normal view. 
•	Tap or click cell A18 to deselect the range A3:E16.
What are my options for telling Excel what to print?
Excel includes three options to allow you to determine what should be printed (Figure 2 – 65). As shown in the 
previous steps, the Print Selection option instructs Excel to print the selected range. The ‘Print Active Sheets’ option 
instructs Excel to print the active worksheet (the worksheet currently on the screen) or the selected worksheets. 
Finally, the ‘Print Entire Workbook’ option instructs Excel to print all of the worksheets in the workbook.

Displaying and Printing the Formulas Version  
of the Worksheet
Thus far, you have been working with the values version of the worksheet, which 
shows the results of the formulas you have entered, rather than the actual formulas. 
Excel also can display and print the formulas version of the worksheet, which shows 
the actual formulas you have entered, rather than the resulting values. 
The formulas version is useful for debugging a worksheet. Debugging is the 
process of finding and correcting errors in the worksheet. Viewing and printing the 
formulas version instead of the values version makes it easier to see any mistakes in 
the formulas.
When you change from the values version to the formulas version, Excel 
increases the width of the columns so that the formulas and text do not overflow into 
adjacent cells on the right. The formulas version of the worksheet, thus, usually is 
significantly wider than the values version. To fit the wide printout on one page, you 
can use landscape orientation, which already has been selected for the workbook, and 
the Fit to option in the Page sheet in the Page Setup dialog box.

To Display the Formulas in the Worksheet

To Change the Print Scaling Option Back to 100%
Depending on your printer, you may have to change the Print Scaling option 
back to 100% after using the Fit to option. Doing so will cause the worksheet to print 
at the default print scaling of 100%. The following steps reset the Print Scaling option 
so that future worksheets print at 100%, instead of being resized to print on one page.
	1	
If necessary, display the PAGE LAYOUT tab and then tap or click the Page Setup Dialog Box 
Launcher (PAGE LAYOUT tab | Page Setup group) to display the Page Setup dialog box.
	2	
Tap or click Adjust to in the Scaling area to select the Adjust to setting.
	3	
If necessary, type   100   in the Adjust to box to adjust the print scaling to a new percentage.
	4	
Tap or click the OK button (Page Setup dialog box) to set the print scaling to normal.
	5	
Display the HOME tab.
What is the purpose of the Adjust to box in the Page Setup dialog box?
The Adjust to box allows you to specify the percentage of reduction or enlargement in 
the printout of a worksheet. The default percentage is 100%. When you tap or click the 
Fit to option, this percentage automatically changes to the percentage required to fit 
the printout on one page.
To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of the 
account from the Account gallery in the Backstage view before exiting Excel. Signing 
out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can access SkyDrive 
files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following steps sign out of a 
Microsoft account from Excel. For a detailed example of the procedure summarized 
below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.

spelling mistakes found in the worksheet title.
b.  The averages in several columns do not include the product in row 4. Adjust the functions in 
these cells so that all products are included in the calculation.
c.  The total profit calculations should be Total Profit = Items Sold * Profit. Adjust the formulas 
in the range F4:F12 so that the correct formula is used.
d.  The values for the total row were entered without using a function. Replace the values with 
the appropriate function.
e.  The currency values in rows 4 and 14 through 16 should be formatted with the ‘Accounting 
Number Format’ button (HOME tab | Number group). They are currently formatted with the 
Currency format (floating dollar sign). The accounting number format displays a fixed dollar sign.
f.  Delete the function in the cell containing the average of % Profit.
2. Improve 
a.  Add a thick box border around the title and subtitle so that they appear more separated from 
the rest of the worksheet.
b.  Adjust the column widths of columns A, D, and F to best fit.

Problem:  You have been asked to build a worksheet for 
a start-up company, TravelUS Campers, that analyzes 
the financing needs for the company’s first year in busi-
ness. The company plans to begin operations in January 
with an initial investment of $700,000.00. The expected 
revenue and costs for the company’s first year are shown 
in Table 2 – 7. The desired worksheet is shown in Fig-
ure 2–74. The initial investment is shown as the starting 
balance for January (cell B4). The amount of financing 
required by the company is shown as the lowest ending 
balance (cell F18).

Introduction
This chapter introduces you to techniques that will enhance your ability to create 
worksheets and draw charts. This chapter also covers other methods for entering 
values in cells, such as allowing Excel to enter values for you based on a pattern of 
values that you create, and formatting these values. In addition, you will learn how to 
use absolute cell references and how to use the IF function to assign a value to a cell 
based on a logical test.
When you set up a worksheet, you should use cell references in formulas 
whenever possible, rather than constant values. The use of a cell reference allows you 
to change a value in multiple formulas by changing the value in a single cell. The cell 
references in a formula are called assumptions. Assumptions are values in cells that 
you can change to determine new values for formulas. This chapter emphasizes the use 
of assumptions and shows how to use assumptions to answer what-if questions, such 
as what happens to the six-month operating income if you decrease the Equipment 
Repair and Maintenance expenses assumption by 1%. Being able to analyze quickly 
the effect of changing values in a worksheet is an important skill in making business 
decisions. 
Worksheets normally are much larger than those created in the previous chapters, 
often extending beyond the size of the Excel window. When you cannot see the entire 
worksheet on the screen at one time, working with a large worksheet can be frustrating. 
This chapter introduces several Excel commands that allow you to control what is 
displayed on the screen so that you can view critical parts of a large worksheet at 
one time. One command allows you to freeze rows and columns so that Excel always 
displays them on the screen. Another command splits the worksheet into separate panes 
so that you can view different parts of a worksheet on the screen at one time. Another 
changes the magnification to allow you to see more content at a smaller magnification. 
This is useful for reviewing the general layout of content on the worksheet.
From your work in Chapter 1, you are aware of how easily you can create charts. 
This chapter covers additional charting techniques that allow you to convey a message 
in a pictorial fashion, such as by using sparkline charts and a clustered column chart.

for the upcoming season to use for procuring partial financing and for determining 
staffing needs. The worksheet should allow for quick analysis if projections for certain 
numbers change, such as the percentage of expenses allocated to commission or 
the cost of the kiosk rentals. In addition, a column chart is required that shows the 
breakdown of expenses into categories for each month in the season.

summary of calculations, and chart requirements.
Figure 3 – 2
Worksheet Title
FroYoToGo Six-Month Financial Projection
Needs
•	 A worksheet that shows FroYoToGo’s projected monthly sales, cost of goods 
sold, gross margin, expenses, and operating income for a six-month period.
•	 A clustered column chart that shows the expected contribution of each 
expense category to total expenses.
Source of Data
Data supplied by the business owner includes projections of the monthly sales 
and expenses based on prior year figures (see Table 3 – 1 on page EX 133). 
Remaining numbers in the worksheet are based on formulas.
Calculations
The following calculations are needed for each month:
•	 Cost of Goods Sold = Revenue − Revenue × Margin
•	 Gross Margin = Revenue − Cost of Goods Sold
•	 Bonus Expense = $5,000.00 if Revenue exceeds the Revenue for Bonus, 
otherwise Bonus = 0
•	 Commission expense = Commission percentage × Revenue
•	 Kiosk Rental expense = Kiosk Rental Percentage × Revenue
•	 Marketing expense = Marketing percentage × Revenue
•	 Equipment Repair and Maintenance expense = Equipment Repair and 
Maintenance percentage × Revenue
•	 Total expenses = sum of Expenses
•	 Operating Income = Gross Margin − Total expenses
Chart Requirements
•	 Show sparkline charts for revenue and each of the items noted in the 
calculations area above.
•	 Show a clustered column chart that shows the contributions of each month’s 
expense categories to the total monthly expense figure.
Using a sketch of the worksheet can help you visualize its design. The sketch 
of the worksheet consists of titles, column and row headings, location of data values, 
calculations, and a rough idea of the desired formatting (Figure 3 – 3a). The sketch of 
the clustered column chart shows the expected contribution of each month’s operating 
income to the six-month operating income (Figure 3 – 3b). The assumptions about 
income and expenses will be entered at the bottom of the worksheet (Figure 3 – 3a). 
The projected monthly sales revenue will be entered in row 4 of the worksheet. The 
projected monthly sales revenue and the assumptions shown in Table 3 – 1 will be used 
to calculate the remaining numbers in the worksheet.

Screen Resolution
Excel may change how the 
groups and buttons within 
the groups appear on the 
ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than 
1366 3 768.
One of the few 
­differences between 
­Windows 7 and 
­Windows 8 ­occurs in  
the steps to run Excel.  
If you are using 
­Windows 7, click 
the Start button, 
type   ­Excel   in the 
‘Search programs 
and files’ box, click 
­Excel 2013, and then, 
if necessary, ­maximize 
the Excel ­window. For 
detailed steps to run 
Excel in Windows 7, 
refer to the Office and 
­Windows chapter at the 
­beginning of this book.

To Enter the Worksheet Titles and Apply a Theme
The worksheet contains two titles, initially in cells A1 and A2. In the previous 
chapters, titles were centered across the worksheet. With large worksheets that extend 
beyond the size of a window, it is best to enter titles left-aligned, as shown in the sketch 
of the worksheet in Figure 3 – 3a on page EX 133 because the worksheet prints with 
the title on the first page if the worksheet requires multiple pages. This allows the user 
to find more easily the worksheet title when necessary. The following steps enter the 
worksheet titles and change the workbook theme to Slice.
	1	
Select cell A1 and then type   FroYoToGo   as the worksheet title.

Rotating Text and Using the Fill Handle  
to Create a Series
The data on the worksheet, including month names and the What-If Assumptions 
section, now can be added to the worksheet.
To Rotate Text in a Cell
The design of the worksheet calls specifically for data for the six months of the selling season. Because 
there always will be only six months of data in the worksheet, place the months across the top of the worksheet 
as column headings rather than as row headings. Place in rows the categories of income and expenses, which are 
more numerous than the number of months. This layout allows you to navigate the worksheet easily. A proper 
layout ideally will create a worksheet that is longer than it is wide.
1 enter headings & data | 2 enter formulas & functions | 3 create sparkline charts
4 format worksheet | 5 create column chart | 6 change views | 7 ask what-if questions
What should you take into account when planning worksheet layout?
Excel allows you to apply many formatting changes to text and numbers to affect the visual impact. Rotated text often provides 
a strong visual appeal. Rotated text also allows you to fit more text into a smaller column width. When laying out a worksheet, 
keep in mind the content you want to emphasize and the length of the cell entry titles relative to the numbers.
CONSIDER THIS
BTW
Rotating Text in a 
Cell
In Excel, you use the 
Alignment sheet in the 
Format Cells dialog box 
(shown in Figure 3–5 on page 
EX 136) to position data in a 
cell by centering, left-aligning, 
or right-aligning; indenting; 
aligning at the top, bottom, 
or center; and rotating. If you 
enter 90 in the Degrees box 
in the Orientation area, the 
text will appear vertically and 
read from bottom to top in 
the cell.

EX 136   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
When you first enter text, its angle is zero degrees (0°), and it reads from left to right in a cell. Excel allows 
you to rotate text in a cell counterclockwise by entering a number between 1° and 90°. Why? Rotating text is one 
method of making column headings visually distinct.
The following steps enter the month name, April, in cell B3 and format cell B3 by rotating the text.

To Use the Fill Handle to  
Create a Series of Month Names
Why? Once the first month in the series has been entered and formatted, you can complete the data series using the 
fill handle rather than typing and formatting all the entries.
The following steps use the fill handle and the entry in cell B3 to create a series of month names in cells 
C3:G3.
1
•	If you are using a 
touch screen, tap 
cell B3, tap AutoFill 
on the mini toolbar 
and then drag the 
AutoFill icon below 
cell B3 to the right 
to select the range 
to fill, C3:G3 in this 
case. Do not lift your 
finger.
•	If you are using a 
mouse, drag the 
fill handle on the 
lower-right corner of 
cell B3 to the right 
to select the range 
to fill, C3:G3 in this 
case. Do not release 
the mouse button 
(Figure 3 – 7).
3
•	Tap or click the OK 
button to rotate the 
text in the active cell 
and automatically 
increase the height 
of the current row to 
best fit the rotated 
text (Figure 3 – 6).

EX 138   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
What if I do not 
want to copy the 
format of cell B3 
during the auto fill 
operation?
In addition to creating a series of values, dragging the fill handle instructs Excel to copy the format of cell B3 to the 
range C3:G3. With some fill operations, you may not want to copy the formats of the source cell or range to the 
destination cell or range. If this is the case, tap or click the ‘Auto Fill Options’ button after the range fills and then 
select the option you desire on the Auto Fill Options menu (Figure 3 – 8).
Using the Auto Fill Options Menu
As shown in Figure 3 – 8, Fill Series is the default option that Excel uses to fill an 
area, which means it fills the destination area with a series, using the same formatting 
as the source area. If you choose another option on the Auto Fill Options menu, then 
Excel immediately changes the contents of the destination range. Following the use of 
the fill handle, the ‘Auto Fill Options’ button remains active until you begin the next 
Excel operation. Table 3 – 2 summarizes the options on the Auto Fill Options menu.
2
•	Lift your finger or 
release the mouse 
button to create a 
month name series 
in the selected range 
and copy the format 
of the selected cell 
to the selected 
range.
•	Tap or click the ‘Auto 
Fill Options’ button 
below the lower-
right corner of the 
fill area to display 
the Auto Fill Options 
menu (Figure 3 – 8).
3
•	Tap or click the ‘Auto Fill Options’ button to hide the Auto Fill Options menu.
•	Select cell H3, type   Total,  and then tap cell I3 or press the right arrow key to enter a column heading.
•	Type   Chart   in cell I3 and then tap cell J3 or press the right arrow key to enter a column heading.
Figure 3 – 8
Q&A
Why is the word, Total, automatically formatted with a 45° rotation?
Excel tries to save you time by automatically recognizing the adjacent cell format in cell G3 and applying it to  
cell H3. Such behavior also occurs when typing the column heading in cell I3.
Q&A
Other Ways
1.	 Type text in cell, apply formatting, right-drag fill handle in direction 
to fill, tap or click Fill Months on shortcut menu
2.	 Type text in cell, apply formatting, select range, tap or click Fill button

The Fill Handle
If you drag the fill handle 
to the left or up, Excel will 
decrement the series rather 
than increment the series. To 
copy a word, such as January 
or Monday, which Excel 
might interpret as the start of 
a series, hold down the ctrl 
key while you drag the fill 
handle to a destination area. 
If you drag the fill handle 
back into the middle of a cell, 
Excel erases the contents of 
the cell.

To Increase Column Widths
Why? In Chapter 2, you increased column widths after the values were entered into the worksheet. Sometimes, you 
may want to increase the column widths before you enter the values and, if necessary, adjust them later. The following 
steps increase the column widths.
1
•	Move the pointer to the boundary 
between column heading A and 
column heading B so that the 
pointer changes to a split double 
arrow in preparation of adjusting 
the column widths.
•	Drag the pointer to the right until 
the ScreenTip displays the desired 
column width, Width: 38.00 (309 
pixels) in this case. Do not lift 
your finger or release the mouse 
button (Figure 3 – 9).

Fill Months
Fill destination area with series of months using format of source area. Same as Fill Series and shows  
as an option only if source area contains the name of a month.
You can create several different types of series using the fill handle. Table 3 – 3 
illustrates several examples. Notice in examples 4 through 7, 9, and 11 that, if you use the 
fill handle to create a series of numbers or nonsequential months, you must enter the first 
item in the series in one cell and the second item in the series in an adjacent cell. Excel still 
creates the series, however, if the first two items are in a range and the cells between the 
items are empty. Next, select both cells and drag the fill handle through the destination area.

Custom Fill 
Sequences
You can create your own

use with the fill handle. For 
example, if you often type 
the same list of products 
or names in Excel, you 
can create a custom fill 
sequence. You then can 
type the first product or 
name and then use the fill 
handle automatically to fill 
in the remaining products or 
names. To create a custom 
fill sequence, display the 
Excel Options dialog box by 
tapping or clicking Options 
in the Backstage view. Tap or 
click the Advanced tab (Excel

To Enter and Indent Row Titles
Excel allows you to indent text in cells. The following steps enter the row titles in column A and indent 
several of the row titles to create a visual hierarchy. Why? Often, indentation sets off titles, such as row titles, from 
other titles to create a hierarchy, such as you may find in a table of contents in a book.
1
•	If necessary, scroll the worksheet 
so that column A and row 4 are 
visible and then enter the row 
titles in the range A4:A16 but 
without the indents, as shown in 
Figure 3 – 11.
•	Select cell A5 and then tap or 
click the Increase Indent button 
(HOME tab | Alignment group) to 
increase the indentation of the 
text in the selected cell.
•	Select the range A9:A13 
and then tap or click the Increase 
Indent button (HOME tab | 
Alignment group) to increase the 
indentation of the text in the 
selected range (Figure 3 – 11).
2
•	Select cell A18 to finish entering 
the row titles and deselect the current cell.
2
•	Lift your finger or release the 
mouse button to change the 
width of the column.
•	Tap or click column heading B 
to select the column and then 
drag through column heading G 
to select the range in which to 
change the widths.
•	Move the pointer to the boundary 
between column headings B and 
C in preparation of resizing column B and then drag the pointer to the right until the ScreenTip displays the desired 
width, Width: 14.50 (121 pixels) in this case. Do not lift your finger or release the mouse button (Figure 3 – 10).
3
•	Lift your finger or release the mouse button to change the width of the selected columns.
•	If necessary, scroll the worksheet so that column H is visible and then use the technique described in Step 1 to 
increase the width of column H to 18.00.

Why do I not need to select the 
entire destination area?
You are not required to select the 
entire destination area (range 
A19:23) before tapping or clicking 
the Paste button (HOME tab | 
Clipboard group). Excel needs to 
know only the upper-left cell of 
the destination area. In the case 
of a single column range, such as 
A19:A23, the top cell of the destination  
area (cell A19) also is the upper-left cell of the destination area.
To Copy a Range of Cells to a  
Nonadjacent Destination Area
The Copy button copies the contents and format of the source area to the Office Clipboard, a temporary 
storage area in the computer’s memory that allows you to collect text and graphics from an Office document and 
then paste them into almost any other type of document. The Paste button pastes a copy of the contents of the 
Office Clipboard in the destination area. Why? Copying the range of cells rather than reentering the content assures 
consistency within the worksheet.
The following steps enter the what-if area row heading and use the Copy and Paste buttons to copy the 
range A9:A13 to the nonadjacent range A19:A23.
1
•	With cell A18 selected, type   
What-If Assumptions   as 
the new row title and then tap or 
click the Enter box.
•	Select the range A9:A13 and 
then tap or click the Copy button 
(HOME tab | Clipboard group) to 
copy the values and formats of 
the selected range, A9:A13 in this 
case, to the Office Clipboard.
•	Select cell A19, the top cell in the 
destination area (Figure 3 – 12).
Copying a Range of Cells to a Nonadjacent 
Destination Area
The What-If Assumptions section should be placed in an area of the worksheet that is 
accessible easily yet does not impair the view of the main section of the worksheet. As 
shown in Figure 3 – 3a on page EX 133, the What-If Assumptions will be placed below 
the calculations in the worksheet. This will allow the reader to see the main section 
of the worksheet when first opening the workbook. Additionally, the row titles in the 
Expenses area are the same as the row titles in the What-If Assumptions table, with the 
exception of the two additional entries in cells A19 (Margin) and A21 (Sales Revenue 
for Bonus). Hence, the What-If Assumptions table row titles can be created by copying 
the range A9:A13 to the range A19:A23 and then inserting two rows for the additional 
entries in cells A19 and A21. The source area (range A9:A13) is not adjacent to the 
destination area (range A19:A23). Thus, you cannot use the fill handle to copy the area.
A more versatile method of copying a source area is to use the Copy button and 
Paste button (HOME tab | Clipboard group). You can use these two buttons to copy a 
source area to an adjacent or nonadjacent destination area.

Using the Paste Options Menu
After you tap or click the Paste button, Excel immediately displays the Paste 
Options button, as shown in Figure 3 – 13. If you tap or click the Paste Options arrow 
and select an option in the Paste Options gallery, Excel modifies the most recent paste 
operation based on your selection. Table 3 – 4 summarizes the options available in the 
Paste Options gallery. When the Paste Options button is visible, you can use keyboard 
shortcuts to access the paste commands available in the Paste Options gallery. 
Additionally, you can use combinations of the options in the Paste Options gallery to 
customize your paste operation. That is, after tapping or clicking one of the icons in 
the Paste Options gallery, you can display the gallery again to further adjust your paste 
operation. The Paste button (HOME tab | Clipboard group) includes an arrow that, 
when tapped or clicked, displays the same options as the Paste Options button.
What if data already existed in the destination area?
When you complete a copy, the values and formats in the destination area are replaced with the values and formats 
of the source area. Any data contained in the destination area prior to the copy and paste is lost. If you accidentally 
delete valuable data, immediately tap or click the Undo button on the Quick Access Toolbar or press ctrl+z.

Copying and Pasting 
from Other Programs
If you need data in Excel that 
is stored in another program, 
copying and pasting likely 
will help you. You might 
need to experiment before 
you are successful, because 
Excel might attempt to 
copy formatting or other 
information that you did not 
intend to paste from the other 
program. Using the various 
Paste Option buttons likely will 
solve most of such problems.

An alternative to tapping or clicking the Paste button is to press the enter key. 
The enter key completes the paste operation, removes the marquee from the source 
area, and disables the Paste button so that you cannot paste the copied source area to 
other destination areas. The enter key was not used in the previous set of steps so 
that the capabilities of the Paste Options button could be discussed. The Paste Options 
button does not appear on the screen when you use the enter key to complete the 
paste operation.
Using Drag and Drop to Move or Copy Cells
You also can use a touch screen or the mouse to move or copy cells. First, you 
select the source area and point to the border of the cell or range. You know you are 
pointing to the border of the cell or range when the pointer changes to a block arrow. 
To move the selected cell or cells, drag the selection to the destination area. To copy 
a selection, hold down the ctrl key while dragging the selection to the destination 
area. You know Excel is in Copy mode when a small plus sign appears next to the block 
arrow pointer. Be sure to release the mouse button before you release the ctrl key. 
Using touch or the mouse to move or copy cells is called drag and drop.

Move It or Copy It
Contrary to popular belief, 
move and copy operations 
are not the same. When you 
move a cell, the data in the 
original location is cleared 
and the format of the cell is 
reset to the default. When 
you copy a cell, the data 
and format of the copy area 
remains intact. In short, you 
should copy cells to duplicate 
entries and move cells to 
rearrange entries.

What is the resulting format of 
the new row?
The cells in the new row inherit 
the formats of the cells in the 
row above them. You can change 
this behavior by tapping or clicking the Insert Options button that appears immediately below the inserted row. 
Following the insertion of a row, the Insert Options button allows you to select from the following options: (1) 
‘Format Same As Above’, (2) ‘Format Same As Below’, and (3) Clear Formatting. The ‘Format Same as Above’ option 
is the default. The Insert Options button remains active until you begin the next Excel operation. Excel does not 
display the Insert Options button if the initial row does not contain any formatted data.

Using Cut and Paste to Move Cells
Another way to move cells is to select them, tap or click the Cut button (HOME 
tab | Clipboard group) (Figure 3 – 12 on page EX 141) to remove them from the 
worksheet and copy them to the Office Clipboard, select the destination area, and then tap 
or click the Paste button (HOME tab | Clipboard group) or press the enter key. You also 
can use the Cut command on the shortcut menu, instead of the Cut button on the ribbon.
Inserting and Deleting Cells in a Worksheet
At any time while the worksheet is on the screen, you can insert cells to enter new  
data or delete cells to remove unwanted data. You can insert or delete individual cells;  
a range of cells, rows, or columns; or entire worksheets.

Cutting
When you cut a cell or range of 
cells using the Cut command 
on a shortcut menu or Cut

the Office Clipboard; it does not 
remove the cells from the source 
area until you paste the cells in 
the destination area by either 
tapping or clicking the Paste 
button (HOME tab | Clipboard 
group) or pressing the enter key. 
When you complete the paste, 
Excel clears the cell’s or range of 
cell’s entries and their formats 
from the source area.

Inserting Columns
You insert columns into a worksheet in the same way you insert rows. To insert 
columns, select one or more columns immediately to the right of where you want 
Excel to insert the new column or columns. Select the number of columns you want to 
insert, tap or click the Insert arrow (HOME tab | Cells group), and then tap or click 
‘Insert Sheet Columns’ in the Insert list; or press and hold or right-click the selected 
column(s) and then tap or click Insert on the shortcut menu. The Insert command on 
the shortcut menu requires that you select an entire column (or columns) to insert a 
column (or columns). Following the insertion of a column, Excel displays the Insert 
Options button, which allows you to modify the insertion in a fashion similar to that 
discussed earlier when inserting rows.
Inserting Single Cells or a Range of Cells
You can use the Insert command on the shortcut menu or the Insert Cells command 
on the Insert menu — produced by tapping or clicking the Insert button (HOME tab | 
Cells group) — to insert a single cell or a range of cells. You should be aware that if you 
shift a single cell or a range of cells, however, it no longer lines up with its associated cells. 
To ensure that the values in the worksheet do not get out of order, spreadsheet experts 
recommend that you insert only entire rows or entire columns. When you insert a single 
cell or a range of cells, Excel displays the Insert Options button so that you can change the 
format of the inserted cell, using options similar to those for inserting rows and columns.
What would happen if cells in the shifted rows were included in formulas?
If the rows that shift down included cell references in formulas located in the 
worksheet, Excel automatically would adjust the cell references in the formulas to their 
new locations. Thus, in Step 2, if a formula in the worksheet referenced a cell in row 19 
before the insert, then Excel would adjust the cell reference in the formula to row 20 
after the insert.

EX 146   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
Deleting Columns and Rows
The Delete button (HOME tab | Cells group) or the Delete command on 
the shortcut menu removes cells (including the data and format) from the worksheet. 
Deleting cells is not the same as clearing cells. The Clear Contents command, described 
in Chapter 1 on page EX 52, clears the data from the cells, but the cells remain in the 
worksheet. The Delete command removes the cells from the worksheet and shifts the 
remaining rows up (when you delete rows) or shifts the remaining columns to the left 
(when you delete columns). If formulas located in other cells reference cells in the deleted 
row or column, Excel does not adjust these cell references. Excel displays the error 
message #REF! in those cells to indicate a cell reference error. For example, if cell A7 
contains the formula =A4+A5 and you delete row 5, Excel assigns the formula =A4+#REF! 
to cell A6 (originally cell A7) and displays the error message, #REF!, in cell A6. Excel also 
displays an Error Options button when you select the cell containing the error message, 
#REF!, which allows you to select options to determine the nature of the problem.
To Save a Workbook with a New File Name
You have performed many tasks while creating this workbook and do not want 
to risk losing work completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the workbook on 
your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation.
The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your 
files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains an Excel folder 
(for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the workbook in the Excel folder in the 
CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of the procedure 
for saving a file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
	1	
Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar, which depending on 
settings, will display either the Save As gallery in the Backstage view or the Save As 
dialog box.
	2	
To save on a hard disk or other storage media on your computer, proceed to Step 2a. 
To save on SkyDrive, proceed to Step 2b.
	2a	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on storage media on 
your computer, tap or click Computer in the left pane, if necessary, to display options 
in the right pane related to saving on your computer. If your screen already displays 
the Save As dialog box, proceed to Step 3.
	2b	 If your screen opens the Backstage view and you want to save on SkyDrive, tap or click 
SkyDrive in the left pane to display SkyDrive saving options or a Sign In button. If your 
screen displays a Sign In button, tap or click it and then sign in to SkyDrive.
	3	
Tap or click the Browse button in the right pane to display the Save As dialog box 
associated with the selected save location (i.e., Computer or SkyDrive).
	4	
Type   FroYoToGo Financial Projection   in the File name box to change the 
file name. Do not press the enter key after typing the file name because you do not 
want to close the dialog box at this time.
	5	
Navigate to the desired save location (in this case, the Excel folder in the CIS 101 
folder [or your class folder] on your computer or SkyDrive).
	6	
Tap or click the Save button (Save As dialog box) to save the document in the selected 
folder on the selected save location with the entered file name.
BTW
Ranges and Undo
The incorrect use of copying, 
deleting, inserting, and 
moving ranges of cells have 
the potential to render a 
worksheet useless. Carefully 
review the results of these 
actions before continuing 
on to the next task. If you 
are not sure the result of 
the action is correct, tap or 
click the Undo button on the 
Quick Access Toolbar.
BTW
Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 
101, a good practice would 
be to save all Excel files in 
an Excel folder in a CIS 101 
folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of 
this book.

To Enter Numbers with Format Symbols
The next step in creating the Financial Projection worksheet is to enter the what-if assumptions values 
in the range B19:B25. The numbers in the table can be entered and then formatted using techniques from 
Chapters 1 and 2, or each number can be entered with format symbols, symbols which assign a format to 
numbers as they are entered. When a number is entered with a format symbol, Excel immediately displays it 
with the assigned format. Valid format symbols include the dollar sign ($), comma (,), and percent sign (%).
If you enter a whole number, it appears without any decimal places. If you enter a number with one 
or more decimal places and a format symbol, Excel displays the number with two decimal places. Table 3 – 5 
illustrates several examples of numbers entered with format symbols. The number in parentheses in column 4 
indicates the number of decimal places.
1 enter headings & data | 2 enter formulas & functions | 3 create sparkline charts
4 format worksheet | 5 create column chart | 6 change views | 7 ask what-if questions
Why? In some cases, using a format symbol is the most efficient method for entering and formatting data. 
The following step enters the numbers in the What-If Assumptions table with format symbols.

Figure 3 – 18
To Enter and Format the System Date
Why? The sketch of the worksheet in Figure 3 – 3a on page EX 133 includes a date stamp on the right side of 
the heading section. A date stamp shows the date a workbook, report, or other document was created or the time period 
it represents. In business, a report often is meaningless without a date stamp. For example, if a printout of the 
worksheet in this chapter were distributed to the company’s analysts, the date stamp would show when the  
six-month projections were made, as well as what time period the report represents.
A simple way to create a date stamp is to use the NOW function to enter the system date tracked by your 
computer in a cell in the worksheet. The NOW function is one of 24 date and time functions available in Excel. 
When assigned to a cell, the NOW function returns a number that corresponds to the system date and time 
beginning with December 31, 1899. For example, January 1, 1900 equals 1, January 2, 1900 equals 2, and so on. 
Noon equals .5. Thus, noon on January 1, 1900 equals 1.5 and 6:00 p.m. on January 1, 1900 equals 1.75. If the 
computer’s system date is set to the current date, which normally it is, then the date stamp is equivalent to the 
current date.
The following steps enter the NOW function and then change the format from mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm to 
mm/dd/yyyy.

Q&A
Q&A
How does Excel format a date?
In Figure 3 – 22, the date is displayed right-aligned in the cell because Excel treats a date as a number formatted to display 
as a date. If you assign the General format (Excel’s default format for numbers) to a date in a cell, the date is displayed as 
a number with two decimal places. For example, if the system time and date is 9:00 a.m. on October 14, 2014, and the cell 
containing the NOW function is assigned the General format, then Excel displays the following number in the cell:
	
41926.375
Q&A
Number of days since	
Time of day is 9:00 a.m. 
December 31, 1899	
(portion of day complete)
The whole number portion of the number (41926) represents the number of days since December 31, 1899. The decimal 
portion of the number (.375) represents 9:00 a.m. as the time of day, at which point 37.5% of the day is complete. To 
assign the General format to a cell, tap or click General in the Category list in the Format Cells dialog box (Figure 3 – 21).

Absolute Versus Relative Addressing
The next sections describe the formulas and functions needed to complete the 
calculations in the worksheet.
As you learned in Chapters 1 and 2, Excel modifies cell references when copying 
formulas. While copying formulas, however, sometimes you do not want Excel to 
change cell references. To keep a cell reference constant when copying a formula or 
function, Excel uses a technique called absolute cell referencing. To specify an absolute 
cell reference in a formula, enter a dollar sign ($) before any column letters or row 
numbers you want to keep constant in formulas you plan to copy. For example, $B$4 
is an absolute cell reference, whereas B4 is a relative cell reference. Both reference 
the same cell. The difference becomes apparent when they are copied to a destination 
area. A formula using the absolute cell reference $B$4 instructs Excel to keep the 
cell reference B4 constant (absolute) in the formula as it copies it to the destination 
area. A formula using the relative cell reference B4 instructs Excel to adjust the cell 
reference as it copies it to the destination area. A cell reference with only one dollar sign 
before either the column or the row is called a mixed cell reference. When planning 
formulas, be aware of when you need to use absolute, relative, and mixed cell references. 
Table 3 – 6 provides some additional examples of each of these types of cell references.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Excel now. To resume at a later 
time, run Excel, open the file called FroYoToGo Financial Projection, and continue following the steps from this 
location forward.
When would you not want to use the system date?
Using the system date results in the data value being updated whenever the worksheet is opened. Think carefully about 
whether or not this is the result you want. If you want the date to reflect the current date, using the system date is appro-
priate. If you want to record when the worksheet was created, using a hard-coded date makes more sense. If both pieces 
of ­information may be important, consider two date entries in the worksheet: a nonvolatile entry identifying the date the 
­worksheet was created and the system date.
CONSIDER THIS
Table 3 – 6 Examples of Absolute, Relative, and Mixed Cell References
Cell Reference
Type of Reference
Meaning
$B$4
Absolute cell reference
Both column and row references remain the same when you copy this cell, because the cell 
references are absolute.
B4
Relative cell reference
Both column and row references are relative. When copied to another cell, both the column and 
row in the cell reference are adjusted to reflect the new location.
B$4
Mixed reference
This cell reference is mixed. The column reference changes when you copy this cell to another 
column because it is relative. The row reference does not change because it is absolute.
$B4
Mixed reference
This cell reference is mixed. The column reference does not change because it is absolute. The row 
reference changes when you copy this cell reference to another row because it is relative.
BTW
Your Age in Days
How many days have you been 
alive? Enter today’s date (e.g., 
10/9/2014) in cell A1. Next, 
enter your birth date (e.g., 
6/22/1996) in cell A2. Select 
cell A3 and enter the formula 
= A1-A2. Format cell A3 to the 
General style using the Format 
Cells dialog box, and cell A3 
will display your age in days.
BTW
Absolute 
Referencing
Absolute referencing is 
one of the more difficult 
worksheet concepts to 
understand. One point to 
keep in mind is that the 
paste operation is the only 
operation affected by an 
absolute cell reference. 
An absolute cell reference 
instructs the paste operation 
to keep the same cell 
reference as it copies a 
formula from one cell to 
another.

EX 152   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
Figure 3 – 23 illustrates how the type of cell reference used affects the results of 
copying a formula to a new place in a worksheet. In Figure 3 – 23a, cells D6:D9 contain 
formulas. Each formula multiplies the content of cell A2 by 2; the difference between 
formulas lies in how cell A2 is referenced. Cells C6:C9 identify the type of reference: 
absolute, relative, or mixed.
Figure 3 – 23b shows the values that result from copying the formulas in cells 
D6:D9 to ranges E6:E9, F7:F10, and G11:G14. Figure 3 – 23c shows the formulas that 
result from copying the formulas. While all formulas started out multiplying the content 
of cell A2 by 2 originally, the values and formulas in the destination ranges illustrate how 
Excel adjusts cell references according to how you reference cells in formulas.
(a)
In the worksheet, you need to enter formulas that calculate the following values 
for April: cost of goods sold (cell B5), gross margin (cell B6), expenses (range B9:B13), 
total expenses (cell B14), and operating income (cell B16). The formulas are based on 
the projected monthly revenue in cell B4 and the assumptions in the range B19:B25.
The calculations for each column (month) are the same, except for the reference 
to the projected monthly revenue in row 4, which varies according to the month 
(B4 for April, C4 for May, and so on). Thus, the formulas for April can be entered in

To Enter a Formula Containing  
Absolute Cell References
Why? As the formulas are entered as shown in Table 3 – 7 in column B for April and then copied to columns C 
through G (May through September) in the worksheet, Excel will adjust the cell references for each column automatically. 
After the copy, the May Commission expense in cell C10 would be =C4 * C22. While the cell reference C4 (May 
Revenue) is correct, the cell reference C22 references an empty cell. The formula for cell C10 should read =C4 * B22, 
rather than =C4 * C22, because B22 references the Commission % value in the What-If Assumptions table. In 
this instance, a way is needed to keep a cell reference in a formula the same, or constant, when it is copied.
The following steps enter the cost of goods formula =B4 * (1 – B19) in cell B5 using Point mode. To enter 
an absolute cell reference, you can type the dollar sign ($) as part of the cell reference or enter it by pressing the 
f4 key with the insertion point in or to the right of the cell reference to change it to absolute.

Is an absolute reference required in this formula?
No, because a mixed cell reference could have been used. The formula in cell B5 will be copied across columns, 
rather than down rows. So, the formula entered in cell B5 in Step 1 could have been entered as =B4*(1–$B19), 
rather than =B4*(1–$B$19). That is, the formula could have included the mixed cell reference $B19, rather than the 
absolute cell reference $B$19. When you copy a formula across columns, the row does not change anyway. The key 
is to ensure that column B remains constant as you copy the formula across columns. To change the absolute cell 
reference to a mixed cell reference, continue to press the f4 key until you achieve the desired cell reference.

Making Decisions — The IF Function
In addition to calculations that are constant across all categories and observations, 
you may need to make calculations that will differ depending on whether or not a 
particular condition or set of conditions are met. In this project, you need to be able 
to vary compensation according to how much revenue is generated in any particular 
month. According to the requirements document in Figure 3 – 2 on page EX 132, a 
bonus will be paid in any month where revenue is greater than the revenue for bonus. 
If the projected April revenue in cell B4 is greater than or equal to the sales revenue for 
bonus in cell B21 (60,000.00), then the projected April bonus value in cell B9 is equal 
to the bonus value in cell B20 (5,000.00); otherwise, cell B9 is equal to 0. One way 
to assign the projected April bonus value in cell B9 is to check to see if the projected 
revenue in cell B4 equals or exceeds the sales revenue for the bonus amount in cell B21 
and, if so, then to enter 5,000.00 in cell B9. You can use this manual process for all six 
months by checking the values for the corresponding months.
Because the data in the worksheet changes each time a report is prepared or the 
figures are adjusted, however, it is preferable to have Excel assign the monthly bonus 
to the entries in the appropriate cells automatically. To do so, cell B9 must include a 
formula or function that compares the projected revenue with the sales revenue for 
bonus value, and displays 5,000.00 or 0.00 (zero), depending on whether the projected 
April revenue in cell B4 is greater than, equal to, or less than the sales revenue for 
bonus value in cell B21. This decision-making process is a logical test. It can be 
represented in diagram form, as shown in Figure 3 – 27.

Logical Operators in 
IF Functions
IF functions can use logical 
operators, such as AND, 
OR, and NOT. For example, 
the three IF functions 
=IF(AND(A1>C1, B1<C2), 
“OK”, “Not OK”) and 
=IF(OR(K5>J5, C3<K6), 
“OK”, “Not OK”) and 
=IF(NOT(B10<C10), “OK”, 
“Not OK”) use logical 
operators. In the first 
example, both logical tests 
must be true for the value_if_
true OK to be assigned to the 
cell. In the second example, 
one or the other logical tests 
must be true for the value_if_
true OK to be assigned to the 
cell. In the third example, the 
logical test B10<C10 must be 
false for the value_if_true OK 
to be assigned to the cell.

Excel Chapter 3
Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis   Excel Chapter 3   EX 155
In Excel, you can use the IF function when you want to assign a value to a cell 
based on a logical test. For example, using the IF function, cell B9 can be assigned the 
following IF function:
=IF(B4>=$B$21, $B$20, 0)
logical_test           value_if_true     value_if_false
The IF function instructs Excel that, if the projected April revenue in cell B4 
is greater than or equal to the sales revenue for bonus value in cell B21, then Excel 
should display in cell B9 the bonus value found in cell B20. If the projected April 
revenue in cell B4 is less than the sales revenue for bonus value in cell B21, then Excel 
displays a 0 (zero) in cell B9.
The general form of the IF function is:
=IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)
The argument, logical_test, is made up of two expressions and a comparison 
operator. Each expression can be a cell reference, a number, text, a function, or a 
formula. In this example, the logical test compares the projected revenue with the 
sales revenue for bonus, using the comparison operator greater than or equal to. Valid 
comparison operators, their meanings, and examples of their use in IF functions are 
shown in Table 3 – 8. The argument, value_if_true, is the value you want Excel to 
display in the cell when the logical test is true. The argument, value_if_false, is the 
value you want Excel to display in the cell when the logical test is false.

Why is the value 0 displayed in 
cell B9?
The value that Excel displays in 
cell B9 depends on the values 
assigned to cells B4, B20, and B21. 
For example, if the value for April 
revenue in cell B4 is increased 
above 60,000.00, then the IF 
function in cell B9 will cause Excel 
to display 5,000.00. If you change the sales revenue for bonus in cell B21 from 60,000.00 to another number and 
the value in cell B4 is greater than or equal to the value in cell B21, it also will change the results in cell B9.
To Enter an IF Function
Why? Use an IF function to determine the value for a cell based on a logical test. The following steps assign the 
IF function =IF(B4>=$B$21,$B$20,0) to cell B9. This IF function determines whether or not the worksheet

To Enter the Remaining April Formulas
The April commission expense in cell B10 is equal to the revenue in cell B4 
times the commission assumption in cell B22 (30.00%). The April kiosk rental expense 
in cell B11 is equal to the projected April revenue in cell B4 times the kiosk rental 
assumption in cell B23 (10.00%). Similar formulas determine the remaining April 
expenses in cells B12 and B13.
The total expenses value in cell B14 is equal to the sum of the expenses in the 
range B9:B13. The operating income in cell B16 is equal to the gross margin in cell B6 
minus the total expenses in cell B14. The formulas are short, and therefore, they are 
typed in the following steps, rather than entered using Point mode.

Nested Forms of the IF Function
A nested IF function is one in which the action to be taken for the true or 
false case includes yet another IF function. The second IF function is considered to 
be nested, or layered, within the first. You can use a nested IF function to add another 
condition to the decision-making process. Study the nested IF function below, which 
would add another level of bonus to the compensation at FroYoToGo. In this case, 
FroYoToGo assigns a bonus for sales of $60,000 and above. For months where sales 
make that level, additional bonus money is available for sales of $75,000 and above. 
In this case, three outcomes are possible, two of which involve paying a bonus.

Assume the following in this example: (1) the nested IF function is assigned 
to cell B9, which instructs Excel to display one of three values in the cell; (2) cell B4 
contains a sales revenue; (3) cell B21 contains the sales revenue for a bonus of $5,000; 
and cell B22 contains the sales revenue for a bonus of $6,500.
=IF(B4>=B21, IF(B4>=B22,6500,5000),0)
The nested IF function instructs Excel to display one, and only one, of the 
following three values in cell B9: (1) 6,500, (2) 5,000, or (3) 0.
You can nest IF functions as deep as you want, but after you get beyond a nest of 
three IF functions, the logic becomes difficult to follow and alternative solutions, such 
as the use of multiple cells and simple IF functions, should be considered.
Adding and Formatting Sparkline Charts
Sometimes you may want to condense a range of data into a small chart in order to show 
a trend or variation in the range. Excel’s standard charts may be too large or extensive 
for your needs. An Excel sparkline chart provides a simple way to show trends and 
variations in a range of data within a single cell. Excel includes three types of sparkline 
charts: line, column, and win/loss. Because they exist in only one cell, you should use 
sparkline charts to convey succinct, eye-catching summaries of the data they represent.
To Add a Sparkline Chart  
to the Worksheet
Each of the rows of monthly data, including those containing formulas, provides useful information easily 
summarized by a line sparkline chart. Why? A line sparkline chart is a good choice because it shows trends over the six-
month period for each row of data.
The following steps add a line sparkline chart to cell I4 and then use the fill handle to create line sparkline 
charts in the range I5:I16 that represent the monthly data in rows 9 through 16.
1
•	If necessary, scroll the worksheet so that both columns B and I and row 3 are displayed on the screen.
•	Select cell I4 to prepare to insert a sparkline chart in the cell.
•	Display the INSERT tab and then tap or click the Line Sparkline button (INSERT tab | Sparklines group) to display the 
Create Sparklines dialog box (Figure 3 – 36).

Using IFERROR
Similar to the IF function, the 
IFERROR function checks a 
formula for correctness. For 
example, =IFERROR(formula, 
“Error Message”) examines 
the formula argument. If 
an error appears (such as 
#N/A), Excel displays the Error 
Message text in the cell instead 
of the Excel #N/A error.

Why do sparkline charts not appear in cells I7, I8, and I15?
Excel does not draw sparkline charts if the range for the sparkline chart contains no data. In this case, the ranges 
B7:G7, B8:G8, and B15:G15 do not contain data, so Excel draws no sparkline chart. If you add data to cells in those 
ranges, then Excel automatically would draw line sparkline charts for the rows to which you added data because 
the sparkline charts were defined for cells I7, I8, and I15 by the drag operation.

Formatting the Worksheet
The worksheet created thus far shows the financial projections for the six-month period, 
from April to September. Its appearance is uninteresting, however, even though some 
minimal formatting (formatting assumptions numbers, changing the column widths, 
formatting the date, and formatting the sparkline chart) was performed earlier. This 
section completes the formatting of the worksheet to make the numbers easier to read 
and to emphasize the titles, assumptions, categories, and totals, as shown in Figure 3 – 42 
on the next page.
How should you format various elements of the worksheet?
A worksheet, such as the one presented in this chapter, should be formatted in the following manner: (1) format the numbers;  
(2) format the worksheet title, column titles, row titles, and total rows; and (3) format an assumptions table. Numbers in heading 
rows and total rows should be formatted with a currency symbol. Other dollar amounts should be formatted with a comma style. An 
­assumptions table should be diminished in its formatting so that it does not distract from the main calculations and data in the worksheet. 
­Assigning the data in an assumptions table a smaller font size would set it apart from other data formatted with a larger font size.

To Assign Formats  
to Nonadjacent Ranges
The numbers in the range B4:H16 are to be formatted as follows:
	1.	 Assign the currency style with a floating dollar sign to rows 4, 6, 9, 14, and 16.
	2.	 Assign a comma style to rows 5 and 10 through 13.
Why? These formats increase the readability of the data. The following steps assign formats to the numbers in 
rows 4 through 16.
1
•	Select the range B4:H4 as the first range to format.
•	While holding down the ctrl key, select the nonadjacent ranges B6:H6, B9:H9, B14:H14, and B16:H16, and then 
release the ctrl key to select nonadjacent ranges.
•	Tap or click the Number Format Dialog Box Launcher (HOME tab | Number group) to display the Format Cells dialog box.
•	Tap or click Currency in the Category list (Format Cells dialog box), if necessary select 2 in the Decimal places 
box, if necessary select $ in the Symbol list to ensure a dollar sign shows in the cells to be formatted, and select 
the black font color ($1,234.10) in the Negative numbers list to specify the desired currency style for the selected 
ranges (Figure 3 – 43).
Figure 3 – 42
Why was the particular style chosen for the negative numbers?
In accounting, negative numbers often are shown with parentheses surrounding the value rather than with a 
negative sign preceding the value. Thus, the format (1,234.10) in the Negative numbers list was tapped or clicked. 
The data being used in this chapter contains no negative numbers. You must select a format for negative numbers, 
however, and you must be consistent if you are choosing different formats in a column; otherwise, the decimal 
points may not line up.
Why is the Format Cells dialog box used to create the format for the ranges in this step?
The requirements for this worksheet call for a floating dollar sign. To assign a currency style with a floating dollar 
sign, use the Format Cells dialog box rather than the ‘Accounting Number Format’ button (HOME tab | Number 
group), which assigns a fixed dollar sign.

Why is the Format 
Cells dialog box used 
to create the style 
for the ranges in Steps 2 and 3?
The Format Cells dialog box is used to assign the comma style, because the Comma Style button (HOME tab |

worksheet call for displaying a value of 0 as 0.00 (see cell B9 in Figure 3 – 45) rather than as a dash. To create a

Why does the currency style need to be reapplied to the range B16:H16?
Sometimes, the use of the format painter results in unintended outcomes. In this case, the changing of the 
background fill color and font color for the range B16:H16 resulted in the loss of the currency style because the 
format being copied did not include the currency style. Reapplying the currency style to the range results in 
the proper number style, fill color, and font color.
Q&A
What happens when I tap or click the Italic and Underline buttons?
Recall that when you assign the italic font style to a cell, Excel slants the characters slightly 
to the right, as shown in cell A18 in Figure 3 – 50. The underline format underlines only 
the characters in the cell, rather than the entire cell, as is the case when you assign a cell a 
bottom border.

Selecting 
Nonadjacent Ranges
One of the more difficult 
tasks to learn is selecting 
nonadjacent ranges. To 
complete this task, do 
not hold down the ctrl 
key when you select the 
first range because Excel 
will consider the current 
active cell to be the first 
selection, and you may not 
want the current active cell 
in the selection. Once the 
first range is selected, hold 
down the ctrl key and drag 
through the nonadjacent 
ranges. If a desired range is 
not visible in the window, 
use the scroll arrows to view 
the range. You need not hold 
down the ctrl key while you 
scroll.

Adding a Clustered Column Chart 
to the Workbook
The next step in the chapter is to draw a clustered column chart on a separate sheet 
in the workbook, as shown in Figure 3 – 51. Use a clustered column chart to compare 
values side by side, broken down by category. Each column shows the value for a 
particular category, by month in this case.
The clustered column chart in Figure 3 – 51 shows the projected expense 
amounts, by category, for each of the six months that FroYoToGo will be operating. 
The clustered column chart allows the user to see how the various expense categories 
compare with each other each month, and across months.
Recall that charts can either be embedded in a worksheet or placed on a separate 
chart sheet. The clustered column chart will reside on its own sheet, because if placed on 
the worksheet, it would not be visible when the worksheet first opens, and could be missed.
In this worksheet, the ranges to chart are the nonadjacent ranges B3:G3 (month 
names) and A9:G13 (monthly projected expenses, by category). The month names in 
the range B3:G3 will identify the major groups for the chart; these entries are called 
category names. The range A9:G13 contains the data that determines the individual 
columns in each month cluster, and the names of each columns; these entries are called 
the data series. Because six months of five expense categories are being charted, the 
chart will contain six clusters of five columns each, unless a value for any category in 
any month is equal to zero.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Excel now. To resume at a later 
time, run Excel, open the file called FroYoToGo Financial Projection, and continue following the steps from this 
location forward.

Charts
When you change a value on 
which a chart is dependent, 
Excel immediately redraws

to change the corresponding 
value in the worksheet.

Chart Items
When you rest the pointer

Why do April and 
May have only four 
columns charted?
Both April and May 
have a value of $0

zero are not charted

What happens as I 
remove the check 
marks from Bonus 
and Commission?
When you remove 
the check marks 
from Bonus and 
Commission and apply these actions, Excel filters the deselected  
series out, redrawing the chart without these series.
2
•	Tap or click the Chart Filters button to close the gallery.
To Apply Chart Filters
Why? With some data, you may find that certain data series or categories make it difficult to examine differences 
and patterns between other series or categories. Excel allows you to easily filter data series and categories to allow more 
in-depth examinations of subsets of data. In this case, filters can be used to remove temporarily the compensation 
categories Bonus and Commission from the chart, to allow a comparison across the noncompensation expenses.
The following steps apply filters to the clustered column chart.
1
•	Tap or click the Chart 
Filters button (on 
the chart) to display 
the Chart Filters 
gallery.
•	In the SERIES 
section, tap or click 
the Bonus and 
Commission check 
boxes to remove 
their check marks 
and then tap or click 
the Apply button 
to filter these series 
from the chart 
(Figure 3 – 58).
To Add an Axis Title to the Chart
Why? Often the unit of measurement or categories for the charted data is not obvious. You can add an axis title or 
titles for both axes for clarity or completeness. The following steps add an axis title for the vertical axis.
1
•	If necessary, tap or click anywhere in the chart area outside the chart to select the chart.
•	Tap or click the Chart Elements button to display the CHART ELEMENTS gallery. Point to Axis Titles to display an 
arrow and then tap or click the arrow to display the Axis Titles fly-out menu.

•	Point to each option on the fly-out menu to see a live preview of the axes’ titles.
•	Tap or click Primary Vertical on the Axis Titles fly-out menu to add an axis title to the vertical axis (Figure 3 – 59).

Organizing the Workbook
Once the content of the workbook is complete, address the organization of the 
workbook. If the workbook has multiple worksheets, place the worksheet on top that 
you want the reader to see first. Default sheet names in Excel are not descriptive. 
Renaming the sheets with descriptive names helps the reader to find information he 
or she is looking for. Modifying the tabs through the use of color further distinguishes 
multiple sheets from each other.
To Rename and Color Sheet Tabs
The following steps rename the sheets and color the sheet tabs.
	1	
Change the color of the Clustered Column Chart sheet tab to Dark Green, Accent 3 
(column 7, row 1).
	2	
Double-tap or double-click the sheet tab labeled Sheet1 at the bottom of the screen.

Type   Six-Month Financial Projection   as the new sheet tab name and 
then press the ENTER key.

To Reorder the Sheet Tabs
Why? Change the order of sheets in a workbook so that they appear with the most important worksheets first. The 
following step reorders the sheets so that the worksheet precedes the chart sheet in the workbook.
1
•	Drag the Six-Month 
Financial Projection 
tab to the left so 
that it precedes the 
Clustered Column 
Chart sheet tab 
to rearrange the 
sequence of the 
sheets (Figure 3 – 68).
Other Ways
1.	 To move sheet, press and hold or right-click sheet tab, tap or click 
Move or Copy on shortcut menu, tap or click OK button
To Check Spelling in Multiple Sheets
By default, the spell checker checks the spelling only in the selected sheets. 
It will check all the cells in the selected sheets, unless you select a range of two or 
more cells. Before checking the spelling, the following steps select both sheets in the 
workbook so that both worksheets in the workbook are checked for spelling errors.
	1	
With the Six-Month Financial Projection sheet active, press CTRL+HOME to select cell 
A1. Hold down the CTRL key and then tap or click the Clustered Column Chart tab to 
select both sheets.
	2	
Display the REVIEW tab and then tap or click the Spelling button (REVIEW tab | 
Proofing group) to check spelling in the selected sheets.
	3	
Correct any errors and then tap or click the OK button (Spelling dialog box or 
Microsoft Excel dialog box) when the spell check is complete.
To Preview and Print the Workbook
After checking the spelling, the next step is to preview and print the sheets. As 
with spelling, Excel previews and prints only the selected sheets. In addition, because 
the worksheet is too wide to print in portrait orientation, the orientation must be 
changed to landscape. The following steps adjust the orientation and scale, preview the 
workbook, and then print the workbook.
	1	
If both sheets are not selected, hold down the CTRL key and then tap or click the tab 
of the inactive sheet.
	2	
Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view.
	3	
Tap or click the Print tab in the Backstage view to display the Print gallery.
	4	
If necessary, tap or click the Portrait Orientation button in the Settings area and then 
select Landscape Orientation to select the desired orientation.

Changing the View of the Worksheet
With Excel, you easily can change the view of the worksheet. For example, you can 
magnify or shrink the worksheet on the screen. You also can view different parts of the 
worksheet through panes.
To Shrink and Magnify the View  
of a Worksheet or Chart
You can magnify (zoom in) or shrink (zoom out) the appearance of a worksheet or chart by using the 
Zoom button (VIEW tab | Zoom group). Why? When you magnify a worksheet, Excel enlarges the view of the 
characters on the screen, but displays fewer columns and rows. Alternatively, when you shrink a worksheet, Excel is able 
to display more columns and rows. Magnifying or shrinking a worksheet affects only the view; it does not change 
the window size or printout of the worksheet or chart. The following steps shrink and magnify the view of the 
worksheet.

•	If cell A1 is not active, press ctrl+home.
•	Display the VIEW tab and then tap or click the Zoom button (VIEW tab | Zoom group) to display a list of

To Split a Window into Panes
When working with a large worksheet, you can split the window into two or four panes to view different 
parts of the worksheet at the same time. Why? Splitting the Excel window into four panes at cell E8 allows you to view 
all four corners of the worksheet easily. The following steps split the Excel window into four panes.
1
•	Select cell E8, the intersection of the four proposed panes, to select the cell at which to split the window.
•	If necessary, display the VIEW tab (Figure 3 – 73).
2
•	Tap or click the Split button (VIEW tab | Window group) to divide the window into four panes.
•	Use the scroll arrows to show the four corners of the worksheet at the same time (Figure 3 – 74).

upper-right pane; (3) range A17:D25 in the lower-left pane; and (4) range E17:J25 in the lower-right pane. The 
vertical split bar is the vertical bar running up and down the middle of the window. The horizontal split bar is the 
horizontal bar running across the middle of the window. If you use the scroll bars below the window and to the 
right of the window to scroll the window, you will see that the panes split by the horizontal split bar scroll together 
vertically. The panes split by the vertical split bar scroll together horizontally. To resize the panes, drag either split 
bar to the desired location in the window.

To Freeze Worksheet Columns  
and Rows
Why? Freezing worksheet columns and rows is a useful technique for viewing large worksheets that extend beyond 
the window. Normally, when you scroll down or to the right, the column content in the top rows and the 
row content in the leftmost columns no longer appear on the screen. When the content of these rows and/
or columns helps to identify or define other content still visible on the worksheet, it can make it difficult to 
remember what the numbers in the visible cells represent. To alleviate this problem, Excel allows you to freeze 
columns and rows, so that Excel displays their content on the screen, no matter how far down or to the right 
you scroll. Content often is a title, such as the content in Column A of the current worksheet. You may also wish 
to keep visible numbers that you need always to see when making changes to content in another part of the 
worksheet, such as the revenue, cost of goods sold, and gross margin information in rows 4 through 6.
The following steps use the Freeze Panes button (VIEW tab | Window group) to freeze the worksheet 
title and column titles in row 3, and the row titles in column A.

EX 186   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
Why should I ensure that row 3 
is the first row displayed?
Before freezing the titles, it is important that Excel display the first row that you want frozen as the first row 
displayed. For example, if cell B4 was selected while displaying row 1, then Excel would freeze the worksheet title 
and subtitle and show only a few rows of data in the Six-Month Financial Project area of the worksheet. To ensure 
that you can view as much data as possible, always scroll to a row that maximizes the view of your important data 
before freezing panes.
1
•	Scroll the worksheet to ensure 
that Excel displays row 3 as the 
first row and column A on the 
screen.
•	Select cell B4 to select the cell on 
which to freeze panes.
•	If necessary, display the VIEW tab 
and then tap or click the Freeze 
Panes button (VIEW tab | Window 
group) to display the Freeze Panes 
gallery (Figure 3 – 75).

•	Tap or click Freeze Panes in the Freeze Panes gallery to freeze rows and columns to the left and above the selected 
cell, column A and row 3 in this case.
•	Scroll down in the worksheet until row 9 is displayed immediately below row 3 (Figure 3 – 76).
Figure 3 – 76
What happens after I tap or click the Freeze Panes command?
Excel displays a thin, dark gray line on the right side of column A, indicating the split between the frozen row 
titles in column A and the rest of the worksheet. It also displays a thin, dark gray line below row 3, indicating the 
split between the frozen column titles in row 3 and the rest of the worksheet. Scrolling down or to the right in the 
worksheet will not scroll the content of row 3 or column A off the screen (Figure 3 – 76).

allow you to work with the worksheet without frozen rows and columns, or to freeze 
the worksheet at a different location.

To Analyze Data in a Worksheet  
by Changing Values
Why? A what-if question for the worksheet in this chapter allows you to ask what the effects are of changing one or 
more values in the What-If Assumptions table, providing you with the results of different scenarios. In this case, you are 
going to examine what would happen to the six-month operating income in cell H16 if the following changes 
were made in the What-If Assumptions table: Bonus $5,000.00 to $5,500.00; Commission 30.00% to 27.50%; 
Equipment Repair and Maintenance 4.00% to 5.00%. To answer a question like this, you need to change only 
the second, fourth, and seventh values in the What-If Assumptions table. The step on the following page changes 
values in the worksheet to answer a what-if question and splits the screen to allow you to see income and 
expense figures simultaneously when changing assumptions. Excel instantaneously recalculates the formulas in 
the worksheet and redraws the clustered column chart to answer the question.
Why does pressing ctrl+home select cell B4?
When the titles are frozen and you press ctrl+home, Excel selects the upper-left cell 
of the unfrozen section of the worksheet. For example, in Step 1 of the previous steps, 
Excel selected cell B4. When the titles are unfrozen, pressing ctrl+home selects cell A1.
What-If Analysis
The automatic recalculation feature of Excel is a powerful tool that can be used to 
analyze worksheet data. Using Excel to scrutinize the impact of changing values in 
cells that are referenced by a formula in another cell is called what-if analysis or 
sensitivity analysis. When new data is entered, Excel not only recalculates all formulas 
in a worksheet, but also redraws any associated charts.
In the workbook created in this chapter, many of the formulas are dependent 
on the assumptions in the range B19:B25. Thus, if you change any of the assumption 
values, Excel immediately recalculates all formulas. Excel redraws the clustered column 
chart as well, because it is based on these numbers.

Freezing Titles
If you want to freeze only 
column headings, select the 
appropriate cell in column 
A before you tap or click the 
Freeze Panes button (VIEW 
tab | Window group). If you 
want to freeze only row titles, 
select the appropriate cell in 
row 1 before you tap or click 
the Freeze Panes button. To 
freeze both column headings 
and row titles, select the cell 
that is the intersection of the 
column and row titles before 
you tap or click the Freeze 
Panes button.

•	Scroll the worksheet so that row 4 is the first row visible on the worksheet.
•	Tap or click in cell A7 to select the row above which to split the window.
•	Tap or click the Split button (VIEW tab | Window group) to split the window after row 6.
•	Use the scroll arrows in the lower-right pane to scroll the window content until row 8 is the first row visible in the 
lower part of the screen, as shown in Figure 3 – 77.
•	Enter   5,500   in cell B20,   27.50%   in cell B22, and   5.00%   in cell B25 (Figure 3 – 79), which causes the six-
month operating income in cell H16 to increase from $92,788.75 to $96,725.00.
Figure 3 – 77
To Goal Seek
Why? If you know the result you want a formula to produce, you can use goal seeking to determine the value of a cell 
on which the formula depends. The previous step, which made changes to the What-If Assumptions table, resulted 
in an operating income that approaches but does not reach $100,000.00. The following steps use the Goal 
Seek command (DATA tab | Data Tools group) to determine the Kiosk Rental percentage in cell B8 that, in 
conjunction with the previous assumption changes, will yield a six-month operating income of $100,000 in cell 
H16, rather than the $96,725.00 from the previous set of steps.

•	Tap or click the OK button (Goal Seek dialog box) to goal seek for the sought-after value in the To value text box, 
$100,000.00 in cell H16 in this case (Figure 3 – 80).
Goal Seeking
Goal seeking assumes you can change the value of only one cell referenced 
directly or indirectly to reach a specific goal for a value in another cell. In this example, 
to change the six-month operating income in cell H16 to $100,000.00, the Kiosk 
Rental percentage in cell B23 must decrease by 0.83% from 10.00% to 9.17%.
You can see from this goal seeking example that the cell to change (cell B23) 
does not have to be referenced directly in the formula or function. For example, 
the six-month operating income in cell H16 is calculated by the function 
=SUM(B16:G16). Cell B23 is not referenced in this function. Instead, cell B23 is 
referenced in the formulas in row 11, on which the monthly operating incomes in 
row 16 are based. Excel thus is capable of goal seeking on the six-month operating 
income by varying the value for the Kiosk Rental assumption.

What happens when I tap or click the OK button?
Excel immediately changes cell H16 from $96,725.00 to the desired value of $100,000.00. More importantly, Excel 
changes the Kiosk Rental assumption in cell B23 from 10.00% to 9.17% (Figure 3 – 80). Excel also displays the Goal 
Seek Status dialog box. If you tap or click the OK button, Excel keeps the new values in the worksheet. If you tap or 
click the Cancel button, Excel redisplays the original values.

www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Instructions Part 1:  Run Excel. Open the workbook Extend 3-1 Fill and IF. Make Fill the active sheet.
	 1.	Use the fill handle and, where necessary, a key, on one column at a time to propagate the 
12 series through row 14, as shown in Figure 3 – 82. (Hint: Search in Help to learn more about 
the fill handle and AutoFill.) In cells O2:O13, indicate the actions used with the fill handle to 
propagate the series. For instance, in cell O2, enter   Drag.   For instances where you need 
to use a key in combination with the Drag, you would enter the key+drag,   Ctrl+Drag   for 
example. For instances where you need to select something other than the cell in row 2 prior to 
using the fill handle, enter the selection and then the drag action,   A1:A2 Drag   for example.
	 2.	Select cell D20. While holding down the ctrl key, one at a time drag the fill handle three cells 
to the right, to the left, up, and down to generate four series of numbers beginning with zero 
and incremented by one.
	 3.	Select cell H20. Point to the cell border so that the pointer changes to a plus sign with four arrows. 
Drag the pointer down to cell H22 to move the contents of cell H20 to cell H22.
	 4.	If necessary, select cell H22. Point to the cell border so that the pointer changes to a plus sign 
with four arrows. While holding down the ctrl key, drag the pointer to cell K22 to copy the 
contents of cell H22 to cell K22.

	 1.	Correct
	a.	 For each contract, the Transportation Costs figure in column C is computed by multiplying 
the Sales for the contract by the Transportation percentage found in the assumptions table. 
For Media Outlets, the transportation cost would be found by multiplying the sales in 
cell B4 by the transportation percent found in cell B12. Similar formulas are used in cells 
C5, C6, and C7. The formula in cell C4 was entered and copied to cells C5, C6, and C7. 
Although the result in cell C4 is correct, the results in cells C5, C6, and C7 are incorrect. 
Edit the formula in cell C4 so that copying the edited formula in cell C4 to cells C5, C6, and 
C7 will result in correct calculations in these cells. After completing the copy, tap or click the 
Auto Fill Options arrow that is displayed below and to the right of cell C7 and choose Fill 
Without Formatting.
	b.	The Discount amounts in cells D4, D5, D6, and D7 are computed using the IF function. 
The Discount amount in column D should equal the Discount % from the assumptions 
area multiplied by the Sales figure from column B if the corresponding Sales in column B 
is greater than or equal to $300,000. If the corresponding Sales in column B is less than 
$300,000, then the Discount amount is calculated using 5% as the discount percentage. 
The IF function in cell D4 was entered and copied to cells D5, D6, and D7. The current 
IF functions in cells D4, D5, D6, and D7 are incorrect. Edit and correct the IF function in 
cell D4. Copy the corrected formula in cell D4 to cells D5, D6, and D7 and then choose 
‘Fill Without Formatting’ from the Auto Fill Options menu.
	c.	 The Maintenance Costs in cell E4 is computed using the formula =B14*B4 (Maint. Costs % × 
Sales). The formula in cell E4 was entered and copied to cells E5, E6, and E7. Although the 
result in cell E4 is correct, the results in cells E5, E6, and E7 are incorrect. Edit and correct 
the formula in cell E4 so that copying the formula to E4 to cells E5, E6, and E7 will result 
in a correct computation. Ensure that the range B5:E7 is formatted with the accounting 
number format with no symbol.
	 2.	Improve
	a.	 Change the design of the worksheet by moving the assumptions table in the range A11:B14 
to the range A1:B4. (Hint: You will need to insert enough blank lines to ensure that you will 
be moving the table to blank cells, to avoid overwriting data.) If the steps in the Correct 
section of this exercise were done correctly, the results of the formulas will not change when 
the move is done. Use the Undo button and Redo button on the Quick Access Toolbar to 
check, moving the assumptions table back and forth while the results of the formulas remain 
the same.
	b.	Apply a theme to the worksheet. Use fill, font colors, spacing, and other skills used in this 
chapter to format the worksheet to make headings and the assumptions table visually distinct 
from the rest of the worksheet. Add two blank lines after the assumptions table to further 
distinguish it from the rest of the worksheet contents.
	c.	 Apply a worksheet name and color to the sheet tab.
	d.	If requested by your instructor, add your surname as the first word in the Contract entry, 
Publishers.
	e.	 Save the workbook using the file name, Analyze 3-1 WheelsAboutTown.com Annual 
Projected Net Income Complete. Submit the revised workbook as specified by your 
instructor.
	f.	
 What decisions did you make to visually distinguish the headings and assumptions table 
from the rest of the worksheet. How did you determine which formatting changes to make?

EX 206   Excel Chapter 3   Working with Large Worksheets, Charting, and What-If Analysis
Part 1:  Create a Sales Projection worksheet using the data in Table 3 – 13. To complete the 
­worksheet, you will need to make the following calculations:
Sales = Prior Year’s Sales * (1 + Annual Growth Rate)
Cost of Goods:
If Annual Growth Rate is negative, Cost of Goods = Sales * (Annual Cost Rate + Premium)
If Annual Growth Rate is not negative, Cost of Goods = Sales * Annual Cost Rate.
Gross Margin = Sales – Cost of Goods.
Use a 3-D pie chart to illustrate the contribution of each year’s Gross Margin to the Total Gross 
Margin over the five-year period.
Use Goal Seek to determine the Year 3 Annual Growth Rate that will generate a Total Gross 
­Margin of 7,500,000.
Part 2: 
 How else might you graphically represent the Gross Margin figures to illustrate the 
contributions of each year to Total Gross Margin?
3: Transportation Costs
Research and Collaboration
Part 1:  You are thinking about buying a new vehicle, and you want to make sure that you buy one 
that offers the highest fuel savings. You know that hybrid vehicles are available, so you decide to 
research them as well as gas-only cars. Your friends also are interested in the results. Together, you 
decide to research the fuel costs associated with various types of vehicles. Research the gas mileage 
for six vehicles: three should run only on gas, and the others should be hybrid vehicles, combin-
ing gas and battery power. After you find the gas mileage for each vehicle, you will use formulas 
to calculate the fuel cost for one month, one year, and three years. Assume that in a typical month, 
you will drive 1200 miles. Develop a worksheet following the general layout in Table 3 – 14 that 
shows the fuel cost analysis. Use the formulas listed in Table 3 – 15 and the concepts and techniques 
presented in this chapter to create the worksheet. You will need to find the average price of gas for 
your market. Add a chart showing the cost comparisons as an embedded chart.

Microsoft Access 2013
Introduction
The term database describes a collection of data organized in a manner that allows 
access, retrieval, and use of that data. Microsoft Access 2013, usually referred to as 
simply Access, is a database management system. A database management system is 
software that allows you to use a computer to create a database; add, change, and delete 
data in the database; ask and answer questions concerning the data; and create forms 
and reports using the data.
Project — Database Creation
Bavant Publishing Inc. is a publishing company that specializes in foreign language 
textbooks. Bavant sells in both the K-12 and the higher education markets. Recently, 
Bavant purchased a small, private publisher of Arabic, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese 
language textbooks. These languages are increasing in popularity with college 
students. All textbooks are available in hardcover and some are available as e-books. 
Bavant Publishing also provides ancillary materials, such as workbooks and laboratory 
manuals, video resources, audio resources, and companion websites. 
Bavant representatives visit campuses and meet with faculty, describing the 
features and strengths of the textbooks and providing review materials for instructors. 
Bavant pays a base salary to its book reps, who can earn bonus pay based on exceeding 
sales goals. Customers place orders with the publisher following the organization’s 
procedures; for example, colleges and universities place orders through their 
bookstores. Because institutions can cancel classes due to low enrollments, customers 
sometimes return unused books. At the end of an accounting period, these returns are 
subtracted from the current amount due.
Bavant wants to maintain records on the sales of textbooks from the newly 
acquired publisher separately from their other foreign language textbooks to better 
track profitability and market potential. Bavant organizes this data on its customers and 
book representatives in a database managed by Access. In this way, Bavant keeps its data 
current and accurate and can analyze it for trends and produce a variety of useful reports.
In a relational database such as those maintained by Access, a database consists 
of a collection of tables, each of which contains information on a specific subject. 
Figure 1–1 shows the database for Bavant Publishing. It consists of two tables: the 
Customer table (Figure 1–1a) contains information about Bavant customers, and the 
Book Rep table (Figure 1–1b) contains information about the book reps to whom these 
customers are assigned.

The rows in the tables are called records. A record contains information 
about a given person, product, or event. A row in the Customer table, for example, 
contains information about a specific customer, such as the customer’s name, address 
information, and other data.
The columns in the tables are called fields. A field contains a specific piece of 
information within a record. In the Customer table, for example, the fourth field, City, 
contains the name of the city where the customer is located.
The first field in the Customer table is CU #, which is an abbreviation for 
Customer Number. Bavant Publishing assigns each customer a number; the Bavant 
customer numbers consist of three uppercase letters followed by a two-digit number.
The customer numbers are unique; that is, no two customers have the 
same number. Such a field is a unique identifier. A unique identifier, as its name 
suggests, is a way of uniquely identifying each record in the database. A given 
customer number will appear only in a single record in the table. Only one record 
exists, for example, in which the customer number is TSC02. A unique identifier 
also is called a primary key. Thus, the Customer Number field is the primary key 
for the Customer table.

AC 4   Access Chapter 1   Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction
The next eight fields in the Customer table are Customer Name, Street, City, 
State, Postal Code, Amount Paid, Current Due, and Returns. The Amount Paid 
column contains the amount that the customer has paid Bavant Publishing year 
to date (YTD) prior to the current period. The Current Due column contains the 
amount due to Bavant for the current period. The Returns column contains the 
dollar value of the books or other products the customer was unable to sell and has 
returned to Bavant in the current period. For example, customer TSC02 is Tri-State 
Consortium. The address is 3400 Metro Pkwy., in Adelphia, Pennsylvania. The postal 
code is 19156. The customer has paid $34,578.90 for products purchased so far. The 
amount due for the current period is $9,432.56. The customer has returned products 
worth $943.34.
Bavant assigns a single book rep to work with each customer. The last column in 
the Customer table, BR # (an abbreviation for Book Rep Number) gives the number of 
the customer’s book rep. The book rep number for Tri-State Consortium is 65.
The first field in the Book Rep table is also BR #, for Book Rep Number. The 
book rep numbers are unique, so the Book Rep Number field is the primary key of the 
Book Rep table.
The other fields in the Book Rep table are Last Name, First Name, Street, 
City, State, Postal Code, Start Date, Salary, and Bonus Rate. The Start Date field 
gives the date the rep began working for Bavant. The Salary field gives the salary paid 
to the rep thus far this year. The Bonus Rate gives the potential bonus percentage 
based on personal performance. The bonus rate applies when the book rep exceeds a 
predetermined sales goal. For example, book rep 65 is Tracy Rogers. Her address is 
1827 Maple Ave., in Adelphia, Pennsylvania. The postal code is 19159. Tracy started 
working for Bavant on July 1, 2014. So far this year, she has been paid $7,750.00 in 
salary. Her bonus rate is 0.18 (18%).
The book rep number appears in both the Customer table and the Book Rep 
table, and relates customers and book reps. Book rep 48, Michael Statnik, recently 
transferred from another division of the company and has not yet been assigned 
any customers. His book rep number, therefore, does not appear on any row in the 
Customer table.
How would you find the name of the book rep for Tri-State Consortium?
In the Customer table, you see that the book rep number for customer Tri-State Consortium is 65. To find the name of this 
book rep, look for the row in the Book Rep table that contains 65 in the BR # column. After you have found it, you know that 
the book rep for Tri-State Consortium is Tracy Rogers.
How would you find all the customers assigned to Tracy Rogers?
First, look in the Book Rep table to find that her number is 65. You would then look through the Customer table for all the 
customers that contain 65 in the BR # column. Tracy’s customers are DCC34 (Dartt Community College), FSC12 (First State 
­College), KCC78 (Key Community College System), SEC19 (Seaborn College), and TSC02 (Tri-State Consortium).

Roadmap 
In this chapter, you will learn how to create and use the database shown in 
Figure 1–1 on page AC 3. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will 
perform as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 create the first table, Book Rep, using Datasheet view.
2.	 add records to the Book Rep table.
3.	 print the contents of the Book Rep table.
4.	 import records into the second table, Customer.
5.	 modify the second table using Design view.
6.	 create a query for the Customer table.
7.	 create a form for the Customer table.
8.	 create a report for the Customer table.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 3 PRINT CONTENTS activity.

AC 6   Access Chapter 1   Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction
Creating a Database
In Access, all the tables, reports, forms, and queries that you create are stored in a 
single file called a database. Thus, you first must create the database to hold the tables, 
reports, forms, and queries. You can use either the Blank desktop database option or a 
template to create a new database. If you already know the tables and fields you want in 
your database, you would use the Blank desktop database option. If not, you can use a 
template. Templates can guide you by suggesting some commonly used databases.
To Create a Database
Because you already know the tables and fields you want in the Bavant 
Publishing database, you would use the Blank desktop database option rather than 
using a template. The following steps assume you already have created folders for 
storing your files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains an Access 
folder (for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the database in the Access folder 
in the CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of the 
procedure for saving a file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book. 
	1	
Tap or click the ‘Blank desktop database’ thumbnail to select the database type.
	2	
Type   Bavant Publishing   in the File Name text box to enter the new file 
name. Do not press the enter key after typing the file name because you do not want 
to create the database at this time.
	3	
Tap or click the ‘Browse for a location to put your database’ button to display the File 
New Database dialog box.
	4	
Navigate to the location for the database, for example, the Documents library, the My 
Documents folder, the folder identifying your class (CIS 101, in this case), and then to 
the Access folder. 
	5	
Tap or click the OK button (File New Database dialog box) to select the location for 
the database and close the dialog box.
	6	
Tap or click the Create button to create the database on the selected drive in the 
selected folder with the file name, Bavant Publishing (Figure 1–2).
The title bar for my Navigation Pane contains All Tables rather than All Access Objects, 
as in the figure. Is that a problem?
It is not a problem. The title bar indicates how the Navigation Pane is organized. You 
can carry out the steps in the text with either organization. To make your screens match 
the ones in the text, tap or click the Navigation Pane arrow and then tap or click Object 
Type.
I do not have the Search bar that appears on the figure. Is that a problem?
It is not a problem. If your Navigation Pane does not display a Search bar and you want 
your screens to match the ones in the text, press and hold or right-click the Navigation 
Pane title bar arrow to display a shortcut menu, and then tap or click Search Bar.
Q&A
One of the few 
­differences between 
Windows 7 and  
Windows 8 occurs 
in the steps to run 
­Access. If you are using 
­Windows 7, click the 
Start button, type    
Access   in the `Search 
programs and files’ box, 
click ­Access 2013, and 
then, if necessary, maxi-
mize the Access window. 
For detailed steps to run 
Access in Windows 7, 
refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book. 
For a summary of the 
steps, refer to the Quick 
Reference located at the 
back of this book. 
BTW
Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called 
CIS 101, a good practice 
would be to save all Access 
files in an Access folder 
in a CIS 101 folder. For a 
discussion of folders and 
detailed examples of creating 
folders, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

Access Chapter 1
Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction   Access Chapter 1   AC 7
To Create a Database Using a Template
Ideally, you will design your own database, create a blank database, and then 
create the tables you have determined that your database should contain. If you are 
not sure what database design you will need, you could use a template. Templates can 
guide you by suggesting some commonly used databases. To create a database using a 
template, you would use the following steps.
1.	 If you have another database open, close it without exiting Access by tapping or 
clicking FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view and then tapping or 
­clicking Close.
2.	 If you do not see a template that you want, you can search Microsoft Office online 
for additional templates.
3.	 Tap or click the template you want to use. Be sure you have selected one that 
­indicates it is for a desktop database.
4.	 Enter a file name and select a location for the database.
5.	 Tap or click the Create button to create the database.
The Access Window
The Access window consists of a variety of components to make your work more 
efficient. These include the Navigation Pane, Access work area, ribbon, shortcut 
menus, and Quick Access Toolbar. Some of these components are common to other 
Microsoft Office apps; others are unique to Access.

area. In the work area in Figure 1–2 on the previous page, a single table, Table1, 
is open in the work area. Object tabs for the open objects appear at the top of the 
work area. If you have multiple objects open at the same time, you can select one 
of the open objects by tapping or clicking its tab. To the left of the work area is 
the Navigation Pane. The Navigation Pane contains a list of all the objects in the 
database. You use this pane to open an object. You also can customize the way objects 
are displayed in the Navigation Pane.
The status bar, located at the bottom of the Access window, presents 
information about the database object, the progress of current tasks, and the status of 
certain commands and keys; it also provides controls for viewing the object. As you 
type text or perform certain commands, various indicators may appear on the status 
bar. The left edge of the status bar in Figure 1–2 shows that the table object is open in 
Datasheet view. In Datasheet view, the table is represented as a collection of rows and 
columns called a datasheet. Toward the right edge are View buttons, which you can 
use to change the view that currently appears.
Determining Tables and Fields
Once you have created the database, you need to create the tables and fields that your 
database will contain. Before doing so, however, you need to make some decisions 
regarding the tables and fields.
Naming Tables and Fields
In creating your database, you must name tables and fields. Before beginning the 
design process, you must understand the rules Access applies to table and field names. 
These rules are:
1.	 Names can be up to 64 characters in length.
2.	 Names can contain letters, digits, and spaces, as well as most of the punctuation 
symbols.
3.	 Names cannot contain periods (.), exclamation points (!), accent graves (`), or 
square brackets ([ ]).
4.	 Each field in a table must have a unique name.
The approach to naming tables and fields used in this text is to begin the names 
with an uppercase letter and to use lowercase for the other letters. In multiple-word 
names, each word begins with an uppercase letter, and there is a space between words 
(for example, Customer Number). 
Determining the Primary Key
For each table, you need to determine the primary key, the unique identifier. In 
many cases, you will have obvious choices, such as Customer Number or Book Rep 
Number. If you do not have an obvious choice, you can use the primary key that Access 
creates automatically. It is a field called ID. It is an autonumber field, which means that 
Access will assign the value 1 to the first record, 2 to the second record, and so on. 
BTW
The Ribbon and 
Screen Resolution
Access may change how the 
groups and buttons within 
the groups appear on the 
ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than 
1366 3 768.
BTW
Naming Tables
Database users typically have 
their own guidelines for 
naming tables. Some use the 
singular version of the object 
being described while others 
use the prefix tbl with a table 
name. This book uses the 
singular version of the object 
(Customer, Book Rep).
BTW
Multiple-Word 
Names
There are several ways to 
handle multiple word names. 
You can omit the space 
(CustomerNumber) or use an 
underscore in place of the 
space (Customer_Number). 
Another option is to use 
an underscore in place 
of a space, but use the 
same case for all letters 
(CUSTOMER_NUMBER or 
customer_number).

Determining Data Types for the Fields
For each field in your database, you must determine the field’s data type, that is, 
the type of data that can be stored in the field. Four of the most commonly used data 
types in Access are: 
1.	 Short Text — The field can contain any characters. A maximum number of 
255 characters is allowed in a field whose data type is Short Text.
2.	 Number — The field can contain only numbers. The numbers can be either 
positive or negative. Fields assigned this type can be used in arithmetic 
operations. You usually assign fields that contain numbers but will not be used 
for arithmetic operations (such as postal codes) a data type of Short Text.
3.	 Currency — The field can contain only monetary data. The values will appear 
with currency symbols, such as dollar signs, commas, and decimal points, and 
with two digits following the decimal point. Like numeric fields, you can use 
currency fields in arithmetic operations. Access assigns a size to currency fields 
automatically.
4.	 Date & Time — The field can store dates and/or times.
Table 1–1 shows the other data types that are available in Access.
Table 1–1 Additional Data Types
Data Type
Description
Long Text
Field can store a variable amount of text or combinations of text and numbers where the 
total number of characters may exceed 255.
AutoNumber
Field can store a unique sequential number that Access assigns to a record. Access will 
increment the number by 1 as each new record is added.
Yes/No
Field can store only one of two values. The choices are Yes/No, True/False, or On/Off.
OLE Object
Field can store an OLE object, which is an object linked to or embedded in the table.
Hyperlink
Field can store text that can be used as a hyperlink address.
Attachment
Field can contain an attached file. Images, spreadsheets, documents, charts, and other 
elements can be attached to this field in a record in the database. You can view and edit 
the attached file.
Calculated
Field specified as a calculation based on other fields. The value is not actually stored.
In the Customer table, because the Customer Number, Customer Name, Street, 
City, and State all can contain letters, their data types should be Short Text. The data 
type for Postal Code is Short Text instead of Number because you typically do not use 
postal codes in arithmetic operations; you do not add postal codes or find an average 
postal code, for example. The Amount Paid, Current Due, and Returns fields contain 
monetary data, so their data types should be Currency. The Book Rep Number field 
contains numbers, but you will not use these numbers in arithmetic operations, so its 
type should be Short Text.
Similarly, in the Book Rep table, the data type for the Book Rep Number, Last 
Name, First Name, Street, City, State, and Postal Code fields all should be Short Text. 
The Start Date field should be Date & Time. The Salary field contains monetary 
amounts, so its data type should be Currency. The Bonus Rate field contains numbers 
that are not dollar amounts, so its data type should be Number.
For fields whose type is Short Text, you can change the field size, that is, the 
maximum number of characters that can be entered in the field. If you set the field size 
for the State field to 2, for example, Access will not allow the user to enter more than 
two characters in the field. On the other hand, fields whose data type is Number often

BTW
Data Types
Different database 
management systems have 
different available data 
types. Even data types that 
are essentially the same can 
have different names. The 
Currency data type in Access, 
for example, is referred to as 
Money in SQL Server.
BTW
AutoNumber Fields
AutoNumber fields also are 
called AutoIncrement fields. 
In Design view, the New 
Values field property allows 
you to increment the field 
sequentially (Sequential) or 
randomly (Random). The 
default is sequential.
BTW
Text Data Types
Short Text replaces the Text 
data type in previous editions 
of Access. Long Text replaces 
the Memo data type in 
previous editions.

require you to change the field size, which is the storage space assigned to the field by 
Access. Table 1–2 shows the possible field sizes for Number fields. 
Table 1–2 Field Sizes for Number Fields 
Field Size
Description
Byte
Integer value in the range of 0 to 255
Integer
Integer value in the range of -32,768 to 32,767
Long Integer
Integer value in the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
Single
Numeric values with decimal places to seven significant digits — requires 4 bytes of storage
Double
Numeric values with decimal places to more accuracy than Single — requires 8 bytes of 
storage
Replication ID
Special identifier required for replication
Decimal
Numeric values with decimal places to more accuracy than Single or Double — requires 
12 bytes of storage
What is the appropriate size for the Bonus Rate field?
If the size were Byte, Integer, or Long Integer, only integers could be stored. If you try to store a value that has decimal places, 
such as 0.18, in fields of these sizes, the portion to the right of the decimal point would be removed, giving a result of 0. To 
­address this problem, the bonus rate should have a size of Single, Double, or Decimal. With such small numbers involved, 
Single, which requires the least storage of the three, is the appropriate choice.
When would you want to use a caption? 
You would use a caption whenever you want something other than the field name displayed. One common example is when 
the field name is relatively long and the data in the field is relatively short. In the Book Rep table, the name of the first field 
is Book Rep Number, but the field contains data that is only two characters long. You will change the caption for this field to 
BR #, which is much shorter than Book Rep Number yet still describes the field. Doing so will enable you to greatly reduce the 
width of the column.

Creating a Table
To create a table in Access, you must define its structure. That is, you must define all 
the fields that make up the table and their characteristics. You also must indicate the 
primary key.
In Access, you can use two different views to create a table: Datasheet view 
and Design view. In Datasheet view, the data in the table is presented in rows and 
columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Although the main reason to use Datasheet view 
is to add or update records in a table, you also can use it to create a table or to later 
modify its structure. The other view, Design view, is only used to create a table or to 
modify the structure of a table.
As you might expect, Design view has more functionality for creating a table than 
Datasheet view. That is, there are certain actions that only can be performed in Design 
view. One such action is assigning Single as the field size for the Bonus Rate field. In this 
chapter, you will create the first table, the Book Rep table, in Datasheet view. Once you 
have created the table in Datasheet view, you will use Design view to change the field size. 
Whichever view you choose to use, before creating the table, you need to know 
the names and data types of the fields that will make up the table. You also can decide 
to enter a description for a particular field to explain important details about the 
field. When you select this field, this description will appear on the status bar. You also 
might choose to assign a caption to a particular field. If you assign a caption, Access 
will display the value you assign, rather than the field name, in datasheets and in forms. 
If you do not assign a caption, Access will display the field name.

The results of these decisions for the fields in the Book Rep table are shown in 
Table 1–3. The table also shows the data types and field sizes of the fields as well as any 
special properties that need to be changed. The Book Rep Number field has a caption 
of BR #, enabling the width of the Book Rep Number column to be reduced in the 
datasheet.

How do you determine the field size?
You need to determine the maximum number of characters that can be entered in the field. In some cases, it is obvious. Field 
sizes of 2 for the State field and 5 for the Postal Code field are certainly the appropriate choices. In other cases, you need 
to ­determine how many characters you wish to allow. In the list shown in Table 1–3, Bavant evidently decided allowing 
15 characters was sufficient for last names. This field size can be changed later if it proves to be insufficient.
What is the purpose of the Format and Decimal Places properties?
The format guarantees that bonus rates will be displayed with a fixed number of decimal places. Setting the decimal places 
property to 2 guarantees that the rates will be displayed with precisely two decimal places. Thus, a bonus rate of 0.2 will be 
displayed as 0.20.

To Modify the Primary Key
When you first create your database, Access automatically creates a table for you. You can immediately 
begin defining the fields. If, for any reason, you do not have this table or inadvertently delete it, you can 
create the table by tapping or clicking CREATE on the ribbon and then tapping or clicking the Table button 
(CREATE tab | Tables group). In either case, you are ready to define the fields.
The steps on the next page change the name, data type, and other properties of the first field to match the 
Book Rep Number field in Table 1–3, which is the primary key. Why? Access has already created the first field as the 
primary key field, which it has named ID. Book Rep Number is a more appropriate choice.

Making Changes to the Structure
When creating a table, check the entries carefully to ensure they are correct. 
If you discover a mistake while still typing the entry, you can correct the error by 
repeatedly pressing the backspace key until the incorrect characters are removed. 
Then, type the correct characters. If you do not discover a mistake until later, you can 
use the following techniques to make the necessary changes to the structure:
•	To undo your most recent change, tap or click the Undo button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar. If there is nothing that Access can undo, this button will be dim, 
and tapping or clicking it will have no effect.
•	To delete a field, press and hold or right-click the column heading for the field 
(the position containing the field name), and then tap or click Delete Field on the 
shortcut menu.
•	To change the name of a field, press and hold or right-click the column heading 
for the field, tap or click Rename Field on the shortcut menu, and then type the 
desired field name.
•	To insert a field as the last field, tap or click the ‘Click to Add’ column heading, 
tap or click the appropriate data type on the menu of available data types, type the 
desired field name, and, if necessary, change the field size.
•	To insert a field between existing fields, press and hold or right-click the column 
heading for the field that will follow the new field, and then tap or click Insert

To View the Table in Design View
Even when creating a table in Datasheet view, Design view can be helpful. Why? You easily can view the 
fields, data types, and properties to ensure you have entered them correctly. It is also easier to determine the primary key 
in Design view. The following steps display the structure of the Book Rep table in Design view so that you can 
verify the design is correct.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report
Other Ways
1.	 Tap or click Design View button on status bar
•	Tap or click the View 
arrow (Table Tools 
Fields tab | Views 
group) to display 
the View menu 
(Figure 1–14).
Could I just tap or 
click the View button 
rather than the 
arrow?
Yes. Tapping or 
clicking the button 
is equivalent to 
tapping or clicking 
the command 
represented by 
the icon currently

Checking the Structure in Design View
You should use Design view to carefully check the entries you have made. In 
Figure 1–15 on the previous page, for example, you can see that the Book Rep Number 
field is the primary key of the Book Rep table by the key symbol in front of the field 
name. If your table does not have a key symbol, you can tap or click the Primary Key 
button (Table Tools Design tab | Tools group) to designate the field as the 
primary key. You also can check that the data type, description, field size, and caption 
are all correct.
For the other fields, you can see the field name, data type, and description 
without taking any special action. To see the field size and/or caption for a field, tap or 
click the field’s row selector, the small box that precedes the field. Tapping or clicking 
the row selector for the Last Name field, for example, displays the properties for the 
field. You then can check to see that the field size is correct. In addition, if the field has 
a caption, you can check to see if that is correct. If you find any mistakes, you can make 
the necessary corrections on this screen. When you have finished, you would tap or 
click the Save button to save your changes.
To Change a Field Size in Design View
Most field size changes can be made in either Datasheet view or Design view. However, changing the 
field size for Number fields, such as the Bonus Rate field, can only be made in Design view. Because the values 
in the Bonus Rate field have decimal places, only Single, Double, or Decimal would be possible choices for the 
field size. The difference between these choices concerns the amount of accuracy. Double is more accurate than 
Single, for example, but requires more storage space. Because the rates are only two decimal places, Single is an 
acceptable choice.
The following steps change the field size of the Bonus Rate field to Single, the format to Fixed, and the 
number of decimal places to 2. Why change the format and number of decimal places? To ensure that each value 
will appear with precisely two decimal places.

To Add Records to a Table
Creating a table by building the structure and saving the table is the first step in the two-step process of 
using a table in a database. The second step is to add records to the table. To add records to a table, the table 
must be open. When making changes to tables, you work in Datasheet view. 
You often add records in phases. Why? You might not have enough time to add all the records in one session, or 
you might not have all the records currently available. The following steps open the Book Rep table in Datasheet 
view and then add the first two records in the Book Rep table (Figure 1–20).

•	Press the tab key to 
move to the next 
field.
•	Enter the last name, 
first name, street, 
city, state, and postal 
code by typing the 
following entries, 
pressing the tab 
key after each one:   
Chin   as the last 
name,   Robert   
as the first name,   
265 Maxwell 
St.   as the street,   
Gossett   as the 
city,   PA   as the 
state, and   19157   as the postal code.
•	 If requested by your instructor, enter your address instead of 265 Maxwell St. as the 
street. If your address is longer than 20 characters, enter the first 20 characters.
•	Type   6/1/2013   in the Start Date field (Figure 1–24).
•	Press the tab key and 
then type   26250   
in the Salary field.
Do I need to type a 
dollar sign?
You do not need to 
type dollar signs or 
commas. In addition, 
because the digits 
to the right of the 
decimal point are 
both zeros, you do 
not need to type 
either the decimal 
point or the zeros.
•	Press the tab key to 
complete the entry 
for the Salary field.
•	Type   0.19   in the 
Bonus Rate field, and then press the tab key to complete the entry of the first record 
(Figure 1–25).
Do I need to type the leading zero for the Bonus Rate?
Typing the leading zero is not necessary. You could type .19 if you prefer. In addition, 
you would not have to type any final zeros. For example, if you needed to enter 0.20, 
you could simply type .2 as your entry.
How and when do I save the record?
As soon as you have entered or modified a record and moved to another record, Access 
saves the original record. This is different from other applications. The rows entered in 
an Excel worksheet, for example, are not saved until the entire worksheet is saved.

•	Use the techniques 
shown in Steps 3 
through 5 to enter the 
data for the second 
record (Figure 1–26).
Does it matter that I 
entered book rep 42 
after I entered book 
rep 53? Should the 
book rep numbers 
be in order?
The order in which you enter the records is not important. When you close and later reopen the table, the records 
will be in book rep number order, because the Book Rep Number field is the primary key.
When I entered the Salary field and changed the data type to Currency, I noticed that the word Currency appeared 
twice. Why?
The second Currency is the format, which indicates how the data will be displayed. For the Currency data type, 
Access automatically sets the format to Currency, which is usually what you would want. You could change it to 
something else, if desired, by tapping or clicking the arrow and selecting the desired format.
 Experiment
•	Tap or click the Salary field on either of the records. Be sure the Table Tools Fields tab is selected. Tap or click the 
Format arrow, and then tap or click each of the formats in the Format box menu to see the effect on the values in 
the Salary field. When finished, tap or click Currency in the Format box menu.

Making Changes to the Data
As you enter data, check your entries carefully to ensure they are correct. If you 
make a mistake and discover it before you press the tab key, correct it by pressing the 
backspace key until the incorrect characters are removed, and then type the correct 
characters. If you do not discover a mistake until later, you can use the following 
techniques to make the necessary corrections to the data:
•	To undo your most recent change, tap or click the Undo button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar. If there is nothing that Access can undo, this button will be 
dimmed, and tapping or clicking it will have no effect.
•	To add a record, tap or click the New (blank) record button, tap or click the 
position for the Book Rep Number field on the first open record, and then add the 
record. Do not worry about it being in the correct position in the table. Access will 
reposition the record based on the primary key, in this case, the Book Rep Number.
•	To delete a record, tap or click the record selector, shown in Figure 1–26, for the 
record to be deleted. Then press the delete key to delete the record, and tap or click 
the Yes button when Access asks you to verify that you want to delete the record.
•	To change the contents of one or more fields in a record, the record must be on the 
screen. If it is not, use any appropriate technique, such as the up arrow and down 
arrow keys or the vertical scroll bar, to move to the record. If the field you want to 
correct is not visible on the screen, use the horizontal scroll bar along the bottom 
of the screen to shift all the fields until the one you want appears. If the value in the 
field is currently highlighted, you can simply type the new value. If you would rather 
edit the existing value, you must have an insertion point in the field. You can place 
the insertion point by tapping or clicking in the field or by pressing the f2 key. You 
then can use the arrow keys, the delete key, and the backspace key for making the 
correction. You also can use the insert key to switch between Insert and Overtype 
mode. When you have made the change, press the tab key to move to the next field.
BTW
AutoCorrect Feature
The AutoCorrect feature of 
Access corrects common data 
entry errors. AutoCorrect 
corrects two capital letters by 
changing the second letter 
to lowercase and capitalizes 
the first letter in the names 
of days. It also corrects 
more than 400 commonly 
misspelled words.

Other AutoCorrect 
Options
Using the Office AutoCorrect

If you cannot determine how to correct the data, you may find that you are 
“stuck” on the record, in which case Access neither allows you to move to another 
record nor allows you to close the table until you have made the correction. If you 
encounter this situation, simply press the esc key. Pressing the esc key will remove 
from the screen the record you are trying to add. You then can move to any other 
record, close the table, or take any other action you desire.
To Close a Table
Now that you have created and saved the Book Rep table, you can close it. The 
following step closes the table.

To Add Records to a Table  
that Contains Data
You can add records to a table that already contains data using a process almost identical to that used to 
add records to an empty table. The only difference is that you place the insertion point after the last record 
before you enter the additional data. To position the insertion point after the last record, you can use the 
Navigation buttons, which are buttons used to move within a table, found near the lower-left corner of the 
screen when a table is open. Why not just tap or click the Book Rep Number (BR #) on the first open record? 
You could do this, but it is a good habit to use the New (blank) record button. Once a table contains more records than will 
fit on the screen, it is easier to tap or click the New (blank) record button. The purpose of each Navigation button is 
described in Table 1–4.

To Resize Columns in a Datasheet
Access assigns default column sizes, which do not always provide space to display all the data in the field. 
In some cases, the data might appear but the entire field name will not. You can correct this problem by resizing 
the column (changing its size) in the datasheet. In some instances, you may want to reduce the size of a column. 
Why? Some fields, such as the State field, are short enough that they do not require all the space on the screen that is 
allotted to them. Changing a column width changes the layout, or design, of a table. The following steps resize 
the columns in the Book Rep table and save the changes to the layout.
•	Point to the right 
boundary of the 
field selector for 
the Book Rep 
Number (BR #) field 
(Figure 1–34) so that 
the pointer becomes 
a two-headed arrow.
I am using touch 
and I cannot see 
the pointer. Is this a 
problem?
It is not a problem. Remember that if you are using your finger on a touch screen, you 
will not see the pointer.
1
Q&A
•	Double-tap or 
double-click the right 
boundary of the field 
selector to resize the 
field so that it best 
fits the data.
•	Use the same 
technique to resize 
all the other fields to 
best fit the data.
•	Save the changes to 
the layout by tapping 
or clicking the Save 
button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar 
(Figure 1–35).
•	Tap or click the table’s Close button (shown in Figure 1–33 on the previous page) to close 
the table.
What if I closed the table without saving the layout changes?
You would be asked if you want to save the changes.

contents. Figure 1–36 shows a printed copy of the contents of the Book Rep table. 
(Yours may look slightly different, depending on your printer.) Because the Book 
Rep table is substantially wider than the screen, it also will be wider than the normal 
printed page in portrait orientation. Portrait orientation means the printout is 
across the width of the page. Landscape orientation means the printout is across the 
height of the page. To print the wide database table, you might prefer to use landscape 
orientation. A convenient way to change to landscape orientation is to preview what 
the printed copy will look like by using Print Preview. This allows you to determine 
whether landscape orientation is necessary and, if it is, to change the orientation easily 
to landscape. In addition, you also can use Print Preview to determine whether any 
adjustments are necessary to the page margins.

What is the best method for distributing database objects?
The traditional method of distributing database objects such as tables, reports, and forms uses a printer to produce a hard 
copy. A hard copy or printout is information that exists on a physical medium such as paper. Hard copies can be useful for the 
­following reasons:
•	Some people prefer proofreading a hard copy of a document rather than viewing it on the screen to check for errors and 
readability.
•	Hard copies can serve as a backup reference if your storage medium is lost or becomes corrupted and you need to recreate 
the document. 
Instead of distributing a hard copy, users can distribute the document as an electronic image that mirrors the original 
­document’s appearance. The electronic image of the document can be emailed, posted on a website, or copied to a portable 
storage medium such as a USB flash drive. Two popular electronic image formats, sometimes called fixed formats, are PDF by 
Adobe Systems and XPS by Microsoft. In Access, you can create electronic image files through the EXTERNAL DATA tab on the 
ribbon. Electronic images of documents, such as PDF and XPS, can be useful for the following reasons:
•	Users can view electronic images of documents without the software that created the original document (e.g., Access). 
­Specifically, to view a PDF file, you use a program called Adobe Reader, which can be downloaded free from Adobe’s 
­website. Similarly, to view an XPS file, you use a program called XPS Viewer, which is included in the latest versions of 
­Windows and Internet Explorer.
•	Sending electronic documents saves paper and printer supplies. Society encourages users to contribute to green ­computing, 
which involves reducing the electricity consumed and environmental waste generated when using computers, mobile devices, 
and related technologies.

To Preview and Print  
the Contents of a Table
The following steps use Print Preview to preview and then print the contents of the Book Rep table. Why? 
By previewing the contents of the table in Print Preview, you can make any necessary adjustments to the orientation or to 
the margins before printing the contents.
•	If the Navigation Pane is closed, 
open the Navigation Pane by 
tapping or clicking the Shutter 
Bar Open/Close Button.
•	Be sure the Book Rep table is 
selected.
Why do I have to be sure the 
Book Rep table is selected? It is 
the only object in the database.
When the database contains 
only one object, you do not 
have to worry about selecting 
the object. Ensuring that the 
correct object is selected is a 
good habit to form, however, 
to make sure that the object 
you print is the one you want.
•	Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view.
•	Tap or click the Print tab in the Backstage view to display the Print gallery (Figure 1–37).

Importing or Linking Data from Other 
Applications to Access
If your data for a table is stored in an Excel worksheet, you can import the data, which 
means to make a copy of the data as a table in the Access database. In this case, any 
changes to the data made in Access would not be reflected in the Excel worksheet. 
Figure 1–41, which contains the Customer data, is an example of the type of 
worksheet that can be imported. In this type of worksheet, the data is stored as a list, 
that is, a collection of rows and columns in which all the entries in a column represent 
the same type of data. In this type of list, the first row contains column headings, 
that is, descriptions of the contents of the column, rather than data. In the worksheet 
in Figure 1–41, for example, the entry in the first column of the first row is Customer 
Number. This indicates that all the other values in this column are customer numbers. 
The fact that the entry in the second column of the first row is Customer Name 
indicates that all the other values in the second column are customer names.
Figure 1–41
Does it matter how the data in the Excel workbook is formatted? If so, how can you be sure the Excel 
data is formatted in such a way you can import it?
The format of data in an Excel workbook is important when you want to import it into Access. To ensure the data is in an 
­appropriate format:
1.	Make sure the data is in the form of a list, a collection of rows and columns in which all the entries in a column represent 
the same type of data.
2.	Make sure there are no blank rows within the list. If there are, remove them prior to importing or linking.
3.	Make sure there are no blank columns within the list. If there are, remove them prior to importing or linking.
4.	Determine whether the first row contains column headings that will make appropriate field names in the resulting table. 
If not, you might consider adding such a row. In general, the process is simpler if the first row in the worksheet contains 
appropriate column headings.

Importing Data 
in Other Formats
You can import data into a 
table from Excel workbooks, 
Access databases, XML files, 
ODBC databases such as 
SQL Server, text files, HTML 
documents, Outlook folders, 
and SharePoint lists.
BTW
Linking Versus 
Importing
When you link to the data 
in the worksheet, the data 
appears as a table in the 
Access database but it is 
maintained in its original 
form in Excel. Any changes to 
the Excel data are reflected 
when the linked table is 
viewed in Access. In this 
arrangement, Access would 
typically be used as a vehicle 
for querying and presenting 
the data, with actual updates 
being made in Excel.

The Import process will create a table. In this table, the column headings in the 
first row of the worksheet become the field names. The rows of the worksheet, other than 
the first row, become the records in the table. In the process, each field will be assigned 
the data type that seems the most reasonable, given the data currently in the worksheet. 
When the Import process is finished, you can use Datasheet or Design view to modify 
these data types or to make any other changes to the structure you feel are necessary.
To Import an Excel Worksheet
You import a worksheet by using the Import Spreadsheet Wizard. In the process, you will indicate that the 
first row in the worksheet contains the column headings. Why? You are indicating that Access is to use those column 
headings as the field names in the Access table. In addition, you will indicate the primary key for the table. As part of the 
process, you could, if appropriate, choose not to include all the fields from the worksheet in the resulting table. 
The following steps import the Customer worksheet.

Correcting Errors in the Structure
Whenever you create or modify a table in Design view, you should check the 
entries carefully to ensure they are correct. If you make a mistake and discover it 
before you press the tab key, you can correct the error by repeatedly pressing the 
backspace key until the incorrect characters are removed. Then, type the correct 
characters. If you do not discover a mistake until later, you can tap or click the entry, 
type the correct value, and then press the enter key. You can use the following 
techniques to make changes to the structure: 
•	If you accidentally add an extra field to the structure, select the field by tapping or 
clicking the row selector (the leftmost column on the row that contains the field 
to be deleted). Once you have selected the field, press the delete key. This will 
remove the field from the structure.
•	If you forget to include a field, select the field that will follow the one you want 
to add by tapping or clicking the row selector, and then press the insert key. The 
remaining fields move down one row, making room for the missing field. Make 
the entries for the new field in the usual manner.
•	If you made the wrong field a primary key field, tap or click the correct primary 
key entry for the field and then tap or click the Primary Key button (Table 
Tools Design tab | Tools group).
•	To move a field, tap or click the row selector for the field to be moved to select 
the field, and then drag the field to the desired position.
As an alternative to these steps, you may want to start over. To do so, tap or click 
the Close button for the window containing the table, and then tap or click the No 
button in the Microsoft Access dialog box. You then can repeat the process you used 
earlier to define the fields in the table.
To Close the Table
Now that you have completed and saved the Customer table, you can close it. 
The following step closes the table.
	1	
Tap or click the Close button for the Customer table (see Figure 1–52) to close the 
table.
To Resize Columns in a Datasheet
You can resize the columns in the datasheet for the Customer table just as you 
resized the columns in the datasheet for the Book Rep table. The following steps resize 
the columns in the Customer table to best fit the data.
	1	
Open the Customer table in Datasheet view.
	2	
Double-tap or double-click the right boundary of the field selectors of each of the 
fields to resize the columns so that they best fit the data.
	3	
Save the changes to the layout by tapping or clicking the Save button on the Quick 
Access Toolbar.
	4	
Close the table.
BTW
Resizing Columns
To resize all columns in 
a datasheet to best fit 
simultaneously, select the 
column heading for the 
first column, hold down the 
shift key and select the last 
column in the datasheet. 
Then, double-tap or double-
click the right boundary of 
any field selector.

Importing Data to an 
Existing Table
When you create a new 
table in Design view, you 
can import data from other 
sources into the table using

AC 40   Access Chapter 1   Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction
Additional Database Objects
A database contains many types of objects. Tables are the objects you use to store and 
manipulate data. Access supports other important types of objects as well; each object 
has a specific purpose that helps maximize the benefits of a database. Through queries 
(questions), Access makes it possible to ask complex questions concerning the data in 
the database and then receive instant answers. Access also allows the user to produce 
attractive and useful forms for viewing and updating data. Additionally, Access 
includes report creation tools that make it easy to produce sophisticated reports for 
presenting data.
Creating Queries
Queries are simply questions, the answers to which are in the database. Access 
contains a powerful query feature that helps you find the answers to a wide variety of 
questions. Once you have examined the question you want to ask to determine the 
fields involved in the question, you can begin creating the query. If the query involves 
no special sort order, restrictions, or calculations, you can use the Simple Query 
Wizard.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Access now. To resume at a later time, run 
Access, open the database called Bavant Publishing, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
To Use the Simple Query Wizard  
to Create a Query
The following steps use the Simple Query Wizard to create a query that Bavant Publishing might use 
to obtain financial information on its customers. Why? The Simple Query Wizard is the quickest and easiest way to

Access Help
At any time while using 
Access, you can find answers 
to questions and display 
information about various topics 
through Access Help. Used 
properly, this form of assistance 
can increase your productivity 
and reduce your frustrations by 
minimizing the time you spend 
learning how to use Access. For 
instruction about Access Help 
and exercises that will help you 
gain confidence in using it, read 
the Office and Windows chapter 
at the beginning of this book.

Datasheet view.
•	To print the results with the query open in either Design view or Datasheet view, 
tap or click FILE on the ribbon, tap or click the Print tab, and then tap or click 
either Print or Quick Print.
•	To print the query without first opening it, be sure the query is selected in the 
Navigation Pane and tap or click FILE on the ribbon, tap or click the Print tab, 
and then tap or click either Print or Quick Print.
You can switch between views of a query using the View button (home tab | 
Views group). Tapping or clicking the arrow in the bottom of the button produces the 
View button menu. You then tap or click the desired view in the menu. The two query 
views you will use in this chapter are Datasheet view (which displays the query results) 
and Design view (for changing the query design). You also can tap or click the top part 
of the View button, in which case, you will switch to the view identified by the icon on 
the button. In the figure, the button contains the icon for Design view, so tapping or 
clicking the button would change to Design view. For the most part, the icon on the 
button represents the view you want, so you can usually simply tap or click the button.
Figure 1–59
To Use a Criterion in a Query
After you have determined the fields to be included in a query, you will determine whether you need to 
further restrict the results of the query. For example, you might want to include only those customers whose 
book rep number is 53. In such a case, you need to enter the number 53 as a criterion for the book rep field. 
Why? A criterion is a condition that the records must satisfy in order to be included in the query results. To do so, you 
will open the query in Design view, enter the criterion below the appropriate field, and then view the results of 
the query. The following steps enter a criterion to include only the customers of book rep 53 and then view the 
query results.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report

Creating Queries
Although the Simple Query

to create straightforward 
queries, you will find that 
many of the queries you 
create require more control 
than the wizard provides. 
In Chapter 2, you will 
use Design view to create 
customized queries.

Creating and Using Forms
In Datasheet view, you can view many records at once. If there are many fields, 
however, only some of the fields in each record might be visible at a time. In Form 
view, where data is displayed in a form on the screen, you usually can see all the fields, 
but only for one record.
To Create a Form
Like a paper form, a form in a database is a formatted document with fields that contain data. Forms allow 
you to view and maintain data. Forms also can be used to print data, but reports are more commonly used for that 
purpose. The simplest type of form in Access is one that includes all the fields in a table stacked one above the 
other. The following steps use the Form button to create a form. Why? Using the Form button is the simplest way to 
create this type of form. The steps then use the form to view records and then save the form.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report
•	Select the Customer table in the 
Navigation Pane.

What is the difference between Layout view and Form view?
Layout view allows you to make changes to the look of the form. Form view is the view you use to examine or 
make changes to the data.
How can I tell when I am in Layout view?
Access identifies Layout view in three ways. The left side of the status bar will contain the words Layout View; 
shading will appear around the outside of the selected field in the form; and the Layout View button will be 
selected on the right side of the status bar.

After you have saved a form, you can use it at any time by pressing and holding or 
right-clicking the form in the Navigation Pane and then tapping or clicking Open on the 
shortcut menu. In addition to viewing data in the form, you also can use it to enter or update 
data, a process that is very similar to updating data using a datasheet. If you plan to use the 
form to enter or revise data, you must ensure you are viewing the form in Form view.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can exit Access now. To resume at a later time, run

Creating and Printing Reports
Bavant Publishing wants to create the Customer Financial Report shown in 
Figure 1–67. To create this report, you will first create a simple report containing all 
records. Then, you will modify the report to match the one shown in Figure 1–67.
Figure 1–67
To Create a Report
You will first create a report containing all fields. Why? It is easiest to create a report with all the fields and 
then delete the fields you do not want. The following steps create and save the initial report. They also modify the 
report title.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report
•	Be sure the Customer table is 
selected in the Navigation Pane.
•	Tap or click CREATE on the

(Figure 1–68).
Do I need to select the Customer 
table prior to tapping or clicking 
CREATE on the ribbon?
You do not need to select the 
table at that point. You do need 
to select a table prior to tapping 
or clicking the Report button, 
because Access will include all the 
fields in whichever table or query 
is currently selected.

AC 50   Access Chapter 1   Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction
Using Layout View in a Report
Access has four different ways to view reports: Report view, Print Preview, 
Layout view, and Design view. Report view shows the report on the screen. Print 
Preview shows the report as it will appear when printed. Layout view is similar to 
Report view in that it shows the report on the screen, but also allows you to make 
changes to the report. Layout view is usually the easiest way to make such changes. 
Design view also allows you to make changes, but does not show you the actual report. 
Design view is most useful when the changes you need to make are especially complex. 
In this chapter, you will use Layout view to modify the report.
To Modify Report Column Headings  
and Resize Columns
To make the report match the one shown in Figure 1–67 on page AC 48, you need to change the title, 
remove some columns, modify the column headings, and also resize the columns. The following steps use 
Layout view to make the necessary modifications to the report. Why? Working in Layout view gives you all the tools 
you need to make the desired modifications. You can view the results of the modifications immediately.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report
•	Press and hold or 
right-click Customer 
Financial Report in

and then tap or click 
Layout View on the

•	If a Field list appears, 
tap or click the Add 
Existing Fields button 
(Report Layout

remove the Field list 
from the screen.
•	Close the Navigation 
Pane.
•	Tap or click the 
report title once to 
select it.
•	Tap or click the 
report title a second 
time to produce 
an insertion point 
(Figure 1–72).
My insertion point is in the middle of Customer. How do I produce an insertion point at 
the position shown in the figure?
You can use the right arrow key to move the insertion point to the position in the 
figure, or you can tap or click the desired position.

To Add Totals to a Report
The report in Figure 1–67 contains totals for the Amount Paid, Current Due, and Returns columns. You 
can use Layout view to add these totals. The following steps use Layout view to include totals for these three 
columns. Why? In Layout view you can tap or click a single button to add totals. This button sums all the values in the field.
1 create first table | 2 add records | 3 print contents | 4 import records | 5 modify second table
6 create query | 7 create form | 8 create report
•	Tap or click the Amount Paid field 
heading (shown in Figure 1–77) to 
select the field.
Do I have to tap or click the 
heading? Could I tap or click the 
field on one of the records?
You do not have to tap or click 
the heading. You also could tap or 
click the Amount Paid field on any 
record.
•	Tap or click DESIGN on the ribbon 
to display the DESIGN tab.
•	Tap or click the Totals button 
(REPORT LAYOUT TOOLS DESIGN 
tab | Grouping & Totals group) to display the Totals menu containing a list of available calculations (Figure 1–78).
•	Tap or click Sum to calculate the 
sum of the amount of paid values.
•	Using the same technique, add 
totals for the Current Due and 
Returns columns.
When I clicked the Totals button 
after selecting the Returns 
field heading, Sum was already 
checked. Do I still need to tap or 
click Sum?
No. In fact, if you do tap or click it, 
you will remove the check mark, 
which will remove the total from 
the column.
•	Scroll down to the bottom of the report to verify that the totals are included. If necessary, expand the size of 
the total controls so they appear completely by dragging the lower boundary of the controls to the approximate 
position shown in Figure 1–79.
•	Tap or click the page number to select it, and then drag it to the approximate position shown in Figure 1–79.
Why did I need to move the page number?
The dotted line near the right-hand edge of the screen indicates the right-hand border of the available space 
on the printed page, based on whatever margins and orientation are currently selected. A portion of the page 
number extends beyond this border. By moving the page number, it no longer extends beyond the border.
•	Tap or click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar to save your changes to the report layout.
•	Close the report.

To Print a Report
The following steps print the report.
	1	
Open the Navigation Pane if necessary, confirm that the Customer Financial Report is 
selected, and then tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view.
	2	
Tap or click the Print tab in the Backstage view to display the Print gallery.
	3	
Tap or click the Quick Print button to print the report.
When I print the report, I have pound signs (####) rather than numbers where the totals 
should be for the Amount Paid and Current Due columns. The report looked fine on the 
screen. How can I correct it?
The columns are not wide enough to display the complete number. Open the report 
in Layout view and slightly increase the width of the Amount Paid and Current Due 
columns by dragging the right boundary of the column headings.
How can I print multiple copies of my report?
Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view. Tap or click the Print tab, tap 
or click Print in the Print gallery to display the Print dialog box, increase the number in 
the Number of Copies box, and then tap or click the OK button (Print dialog box).
How can I print a range of pages rather than printing the whole report?
Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view. Tap or click the Print tab, tap 
or click Print in the Print gallery to display the Print dialog box, tap or click the Pages 
option button in the Print Range area, enter the desired page range, and then tap or 
click the OK button (Print dialog box).
Database Properties
Access helps you organize and identify your databases by using database properties, 
which are the details about a file. Database properties, also known as metadata, can 
include such information as the project author, title, or subject. Keywords are words or 
phrases that further describe the database. For example, a class name or database topic 
can describe the file’s purpose or content.
Five different types of database properties exist, but the more common ones used 
in this book are standard and automatically updated properties. Standard properties 
are associated with all Microsoft Office documents and include author, title, and 
subject. Automatically updated properties include file system properties, such as the 
date you create or change a file, and statistics, such as the file size.
Q&A
Why would you want to assign database properties to a database?
Database properties are valuable for a variety of reasons:
•	Users can save time locating a particular file because they can view a file’s database properties without opening the database.
•	By creating consistent properties for files having similar content, users can better organize their databases.
•	Some organizations require Access users to add database properties so that other employees can view details about these 
files.

Special Database Operations
Additional operations involved in maintaining a database are backup, recovery, 
compacting, and repairing.
Backup and Recovery
It is possible to damage or destroy a database. Users can enter data that is 
incorrect; programs that are updating the database can end abnormally during an 
update; a hardware problem can occur; and so on. After any such event has occurred, 
the database may contain invalid data or it might be totally destroyed.
Obviously, you cannot allow a situation in which data has been damaged or 
destroyed to go uncorrected. You must somehow return the database to a correct state. 
This process is called recovery; that is, you recover the database.
The simplest approach to recovery involves periodically making a copy of the 
database (called a backup copy or a save copy). This is referred to as backing up 
the database. If a problem occurs, you correct the problem by overwriting the actual 
database — often referred to as the live database — with the backup copy.
To back up the database that is currently open, you use the Back Up Database 
command on the Save As tab in the Backstage view. In the process, Access suggests a 
name that is a combination of the database name and the current date. For example, if 
you back up the Bavant Publishing database on October 20, 2014, Access will suggest 
the name, Bavant Publishing_2014-10-20. You can change this name if you desire, 
although it is a good idea to use this name. By doing so, it will be easy to distinguish 
between all the backup copies you have made to determine which is the most recent. 
In addition, if you discover that a critical problem occurred on October 18, 2014, you 
may want to go back to the most recent backup before October 18. If, for example, 
the database was not backed up on October 17 but was backed up on October 16, you 
would use Bavant Publishing_2014-10-16. 
To Back Up a Database
You would use the following steps to back up a database to a file on a hard disk 
or high-capacity removable disk.
1.	 Open the database to be backed up.
2.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view, and then tap or click 
the Save As tab.
3.	 With Save Database As selected in the File Types area, tap or click ‘Back Up Data-
base’ in the Save Database As area, and then tap or click the Save As button.
4.	 Navigate to the desired location in the Save As box. If you do not want the name 
Access has suggested, enter the desired name in the File name text box.
5.	 Tap or click the Save button to back up the database.

Access Chapter 1
Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction   Access Chapter 1   AC 57
Access creates a backup copy with the desired name in the desired location. 
Should you ever need to recover the database using this backup copy, you can simply 
copy it over the live version. 
Compacting and Repairing a Database
As you add more data to a database, it naturally grows larger. When you delete 
an object (records, tables, forms, or queries), the space previously occupied by the 
object does not become available for additional objects. Instead, the additional objects 
are given new space; that is, space that was not already allocated. To remove this 
empty space from the database, you must compact the database. The same option 
that compacts the database also repairs problems that might have occurred in the 
database.
To Compact and Repair a Database
You would use the following steps to compact and repair a database.
1.	 Open the database to be compacted.
2.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view, and then, if necessary, 
select the Info tab.
3.	 Tap or click the Compact & Repair Database button in the Info gallery to compact 
and repair the database.
The database now is the compacted form of the original.
Additional Operations
Additional special operations include opening another database, closing 
a database without exiting Access, and saving a database with another name. 
They also include deleting a table (or other object) as well as renaming an 
object. 
When you open another database, Access will automatically close the database 
that previously was open. Before deleting or renaming an object, you should ensure 
that the object has no dependent objects; that is, other objects that depend on the 
object you want to delete.
To Close a Database without Exiting Access
You would use the following steps to close a database without exiting Access.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view.
2.	 Tap or click Close.
To Save a Database with Another Name
To save a database with another name, you would use the following steps.
1.	 Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view, and then select the 
Save As tab.
2.	 With Save Database As selected in the Database File Types area and Access Data-
base selected in the Save Database As area, tap or click the Save As button.
3.	 Enter a name and select a location for the new version.
4.	 Tap or click the Save button.

To Delete a Table or Other Object in the Database
You would use the following steps to delete a database object.
1. Press and hold or right-click the object in the Navigation Pane.
2. Tap or click Delete on the shortcut menu.
3. Tap or click the Yes button in the Microsoft Access dialog box.
To Rename an Object in the Database
You would use the following steps to rename a database object.
1. Press and hold or right-click the object in the Navigation Pane.
2. Tap or click Rename on the shortcut menu.
3. Type the new name and press the enter key.
Database Design
This section illustrates the database design process, that is, the process of determining 
the tables and fields that make up the database. It does so by showing how you would 
design the database for Bavant Publishing from a set of requirements. In this section, 
you will use commonly accepted shorthand to represent the tables and fields that make 
up the database as well as the primary keys for the tables. For each table, you give the 
name of the table followed by a set of parentheses. Within the parentheses is a list 
of the fields in the table separated by commas. You underline the primary key. For 
example, 
Product (Product Code, Description, On Hand, Price) represents a table called 
Product. The Product table contains four fields: Product Code, Description, On Hand, 
and Price. The Product Code field is the primary key.
Database Requirements
The Bavant Publishing database must maintain information on both customers 
and book reps. The business currently keeps this data in two Word tables and 
two Excel workbooks, as shown in Figure 1–80. They use Word tables for address 
information and Excel workbooks for financial information.
•	For customers, Bavant needs to maintain address data. It currently keeps this data 
in a Word table (Figure 1–80a). 
•	Bavant also maintains financial data for each customer. This includes the amount 
paid, current amount due, and return amount for the customer. It keeps these 
amounts, along with the customer name and number, in the Excel worksheet 
shown in Figure 1–80b.
•	Bavant keeps book rep address data in a Word table, as shown in Figure 1–80c. 
•	Just as with customers, it keeps financial data for book reps, including their start date, 
salary, and bonus rate, in a separate Excel worksheet, as shown in Figure 1–80d.
If you want to make a backup, could you just save the database with another name?
You could certainly do that. Using the backup procedure discussed earlier has the advantage that it automatically includes the 
current database name and the date in the name of the file it creates.
CONSIDER THIS
BTW
Database Design 
Language (DBDL)
Database Design Language 
(DBDL) is a commonly 
accepted shorthand 
representation for showing 
the structure of a relational 
database. You write the 
name of the table and then 
within parentheses you list 
all the columns in the table. 
If the columns continue 
beyond one line, indent the 
subsequent lines.
BTW
Determining 
Database 
Requirements
The determination of 
database requirements is 
part of a process known as 
systems analysis. A systems 
analyst examines existing 
and proposed documents, 
and examines organizational 
policies to determine exactly 
the type of data needs the 
database must support.

•	Finally, Bavant keeps track of which customers are assigned to which book reps. 
Each customer is assigned to a single book rep, but each book rep might be assigned 
many customers. Currently, for example, customers ASU37 (Applewood State 
University), BCJ21 (Brodkin Junior College), FSU23 (Farnham State University), 
MEC56 (Mehitable College), and SCC77 (Stallone Community College) are 
assigned to book rep 42 (Melina Perez). Customers CSD25 (Cowpens ISD), 
CSU10 (Camellia State University), HSD05 (Hammonds County ISD), MCC45 
(Mauldin Community College), and PLI22 (PrattLast Institute) are assigned to 
book rep 53 (Robert Chin). Customers DCC34 (Dartt Community College), 
FSC12 (First State College), KCC78 (Key Community College System), SEC19 
(Seaborn College), and TSC02 (Tri-State Consortium) are assigned to book rep 65 
(Tracy Rogers). Bavant has an additional book rep, Michael Statnik, whose number 
has been assigned as 48, but who has not yet been assigned any customers.
Database Design Process
The database design process involves several steps.
What is the first step in the process?
Identify the tables. Examine the requirements for the database to identify the main objects that are involved. There will be a 
table for each object you identify.
In a database for one organization, for example, the main objects might be departments and employees. This would re-
quire two tables: one for departments and the other for employees. In the database for another organization, the main objects 
might be customers and book reps. In this case, there also would be two tables: one for customers and the other for book reps. 
In still another organization’s database, the main objects might be books, publishers, and authors. This database would require 
three tables: one for books, a second for publishers, and a third for authors.
After identifying the tables, what is the second step in the database design process?
Determine the primary keys. Recall that the primary key is the unique identifier for records in the table. For each table, 
­determine the unique identifier. In a Department table, for example, the unique identifier might be the Department Code. For a 
Book table, the unique identifier might be the ISBN (International Standard Book Number).
CONSIDER THIS
CONSIDER THIS
Identifying the Tables
For the Bavant Publishing database, the main objects are customers and book 
reps. This leads to two tables, which you must name. Reasonable names for these two 
tables are:
Customer
Book Rep
Determining the Primary Keys
The next step is to identify the fields that will be the unique identifiers, or 
primary keys. Customer numbers uniquely identify customers, and book rep numbers 
uniquely identify book reps. Thus, the primary key for the Customer table is the 
customer number, and the primary key for the Book Rep table is the book rep number. 
Reasonable names for these fields would be Customer Number and Book Rep 
Number, respectively. Adding these primary keys to the tables gives:
Customer (Customer Number)
Book Rep (Book Rep Number)

Access Chapter 1
Databases and Database Objects: An Introduction   Access Chapter 1   AC 61
Determining Additional Fields
After identifying the primary keys, you need to determine and name the 
additional fields. In addition to the customer number, the Customer Address 
Information shown in Figure 1–80a on page AC 59 contains the customer name, 
street, city, state, and postal code. These would be fields in the Customer table. The 
Customer Financial Information shown in Figure 1–80b on page AC 59 also contains 
the customer number and customer name, which are already included in the Customer 
table. The financial information also contains the amount paid, current due, and 
returns. Adding the amount paid, current due, and returns fields to those already 
identified in the Customer table and assigning reasonable names gives:
Customer (Customer Number, Customer Name, Street, City, State, Postal Code, 
  Amount Paid, Current Due, Returns)
Similarly, examining the Book Rep Address Information in Figure 1–80c on 
page AC 59 adds the last name, first name, street, city, state, and postal code fields to 
the Book Rep table. In addition to the book rep number, last name, and first name, the 
Book Rep Financial Information in Figure 1–80d on page AC 59 would add the start 
date, salary, and bonus rate. Adding these fields to the Book Rep table and assigning 
reasonable names gives:
Book Rep (Book Rep Number, Last Name, First Name, Street, City, State, Postal
  Code, Start Date, Salary, Bonus Rate)
What is the third step in the database design process after determining the primary keys?
Determine the additional fields. The primary key will be a field or combination of fields in a table. A table typically will 
contain many additional fields, each of which contains a type of data. Examine the project requirements to determine these 
­additional fields. For example, in an Employee table, additional fields might include Employee Name, Street Address, City, State, 
Postal Code, Date Hired, and Salary.
What happens as the fourth step, after determining additional fields?
Determine relationships between the tables. A relationship is an association between objects. In a database ­containing 
information about departments and employees, there is an association between the departments and the ­employees. A depart-
ment is associated with all the employees in the department, and an employee is associated with the department to which he 
or she is assigned. Technically, you say that a department is related to all the employees in the ­department, and an employee is 
related to his or her department.
The relationship between department and employees is an example of a one-to-many relationship because one 
­employee is associated with one department, but each department can be associated with many employees. The Department 
table would be the “one” table in the relationship. The Employee table would be the “many” table in the relationship.
When you have determined that two tables are related, follow these general guidelines:
Identify the “one” table.
Identify the “many” table.
Include the primary key from the “one” table as a field in the “many” table.

Additional Data for 
Bavant Publishing
Bavant could include other 
types of data in the database. 
The Customer table could 
include data on a contact 
person at each organization, 
such as, name, telephone 
number, and email address. 
The Book Rep table could 
include the mobile telephone 
number, email address, 
and emergency contact 
information for the book rep.

Determining and Implementing Relationships 
Between the Tables
According to the requirements, each customer has one book rep, but each book 
rep can have many customers. Thus, the Book Rep table is the “one” table, and the 
Customer table is the “many” table. To implement this one-to-many relationship 
between book reps and customers, add the Book Rep Number field (the primary key of 
the Book Rep table) to the Customer table. This produces:
Customer (Customer Number, Customer Name, Street, City, State, Postal Code, 
  Amount Paid, Current Due, Returns, Book Rep Number)
Book Rep (Book Rep Number, Last Name, First Name, Street, City, State, Postal 
  Code, Start Date, Salary, Bonus Rate)
After creating relationships between tables, what is the fifth step in the database design process?
Determine data types for the fields, that is, the type of data that can be stored in the field.
CONSIDER THIS
Determining Data Types for the Fields
See Pages AC 9 through AC 10 for a discussion of the available data types and 
their use in the Bavant Publishing database. That section also discusses other properties 
that can be assigned, such as captions, field size, and the number of decimal places.
Identifying and Removing Redundancy
Redundancy means storing the same fact in more than one place. It usually results 
from placing too many fields in a table — fields that really belong in separate tables — 
and often causes serious problems. If you had not realized there were two objects, such 
as customers and book reps, you might have placed all the data in a single Customer 
table. Figure 1–81 shows an example of a table that includes both customer and book rep 
information. Notice that the data for a given book rep (number, name, address, and so 
on) occurs on more than one record. The data for rep 42, Melina Perez, is repeated in 
the figure. Storing this data on multiple records is an example of redundancy.

What problems does this redundancy cause?
Redundancy results in several problems, including:
1.	Wasted storage space. The name of book rep 42, Melina Perez, for example, should be stored only once. Storing this fact 
several times is wasteful.
2.	More complex database updates. If, for example, Melina Perez’s name is spelled incorrectly and needs to be changed in 
the database, her name would need to be changed in several different places.
3.	Possible inconsistent data. Nothing prohibits the book rep’s last name from being Perez on customer ASU37’s record and 
Perret on customer BCJ21’s record. The data would be inconsistent. In both cases, the book rep number is 42, but the last 
names are different.
How do you eliminate redundancy?
The solution to the problem is to place the redundant data in a separate table, one in which the data no longer will be 
­redundant. If, for example, you place the data for book reps in a separate table (Figure 1–82), the data for each book rep will 
appear only once.

Notice that you need to have the book rep number in both tables. Without it, there would be no way to tell which book 
rep is associated with which customer. The remaining book rep data, however, was removed from the Customer table and 
placed in the Book Rep table. This new arrangement corrects the problems of redundancy in the following ways:
1.	Because the data for each book rep is stored only once, space is not wasted.
2.	Changing the name of a book rep is easy. You need to change only one row in the Book Rep table.
3.	Because the data for a book rep is stored only once, inconsistent data cannot occur.

Designing to omit redundancy will help you to produce good and valid database 
designs. You should always examine your design to see if it contains redundancy. If it does, 
you should decide whether you need to remove the redundancy by creating a separate table.
If you examine your design, you will see that there is one area of redundancy 
(see the data in Figure 1–1 on page AC 3). Cities and states are both repeated. Every 
customer whose postal code is 19158, for example, has Greer as the city and PA as the 
state. To remove this redundancy, you would create a table with the primary key Postal 
Code and City and State as additional fields. City and State would be removed from the 
Customer table. Having City, State, and Postal Code in a table is very common, however, 
and usually you would not take such action. No other redundancy exists in your tables.
Book Rep 
numbers are 42
name of Book Rep 
42 appears only once
BTW
Postal Codes
Some organizations with 
customers throughout the 
country have a separate 
table of postal codes, cities, 
and states. When placing an 
order, you typically are asked 
for your postal code (or ZIP 
code), rather than city, state, 
and postal code. You then 
are asked to confirm that the 
city and state correspond to 
that postal code.

Adding a Caption, Changing a Data Type, Creating a Query, a Form, and a Report
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for infor-
mation about accessing the required files.
Instructions:  Cosmetics Naturally Inc. manufactures and sells beauty and skin care products made 
with only natural ingredients. The company’s products do not contain any synthetic chemicals, arti-
ficial fragrances, or chemical preservatives. Cosmetics Naturally has a database that keeps track of its 
sales representatives and customers. Each customer is assigned to a single sales rep, but each sales rep 
may be assigned to many customers. The database has two tables. The Customer table contains data 
on the customers who purchase Cosmetics Naturally products. The Sales Rep table contains data on 
the sales reps. You will add a caption, change a data type, create two queries, a form, and a report, as 
shown in Figure 1–83 on the next page.
Perform the following tasks: 
	 1.	Start Access, open the Apply Cosmetics Naturally database from the Data Files for Students, and 
enable the content. 
	 2.	Open the Sales Rep table in Datasheet view, add SR # as the caption for the Sales Rep Number 
field, and resize all columns to best fit the data. Save the changes to the layout of the table and 
close the table.
	 3.	Open the Customer table in Design view and change the data type for the Postal Code field to Short 
Text. Change the field size for the field to 5. Save the changes to the table and close the table.
	 4.	Use the Simple Query Wizard to create a query for the Customer table that contains the 
Customer Number, Customer Name, Amount Paid, Balance, and Sales Rep Number. The query 
is a detail query. Use the name Customer Query for the query and close the query.
	 5.	Create a simple form for the Sales Rep table. Save the form and use the name Sales Rep for the 
form. Close the form.
	 6.	Create the report shown in Figure 1–83 for the Customer table. The report includes totals for 
both the Amount Paid and Balance fields. Be sure the totals appear completely. You might need 
to expand the size of the total controls. Move the page number so that it is within the margins. 
Save the report as Customer Financial Report.
	 7.	If requested by your instructor, add your last name to the title of the report, that is, change the title 
to Customer Financial Report LastName where LastName is your actual last name. 
	 8.	Compact and repair the database.
	 9.	Submit the revised database in the format specified by your instructor.
	10.	 
 How would you change the field name of the Balance field in the Customer table to 
Current Balance?
How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with  
a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require 
you to think beyond the assigned database. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your 
instructor. Possible formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that 
contains the answer; present your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio 
or video using a webcam, smartphone, or portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.

Correcting Errors in the Table Structure
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Instructions:  Analyze SciFi Movies is a database containing information on classic science 
­fiction movies that your film professor would like to use for teaching. The Movie table shown in 
­Figure 1–85 contains errors to the table structure. Your professor has asked you to correct the 
­errors and make some improvements to the database. Start Access and open the Analyze SciFi 
Movies database from the Data Files for Students.
1. Correct  Movie Number should be the primary key for the Movie table. The ID field should 
not be a field in the table. The Rating field represents a numerical rating system of one to four to 
indicate the quality of the movie. Your instructor wants to be able to find the average rating for 
films directed by a particular director. Only integers should be stored in both the Rating and the 
Length (Minutes) fields.
2. Improve  The default field size for Short Text fields is 255. Changing the field size to more 
accurately represent the maximum number of characters that can be stored in a field is one way to 
improve the accuracy of the data. The Movie Number, Director Number, and Awards fields should 
have a maximum size of 3 characters. The Year Made field should have a maximum field size of 4. 
The Movie Name and Studio fields should have a maximum field size of 50. If instructed to do 
so by your instructor, rename the Movie table as Movie Last Name where Last Name is your last 
name. Submit the revised database in the format specified by your instructor.
3.	 
 The Awards field currently has a data type of Short Text, but the only values that will be 
stored in that field are Yes and No to indicate whether the movie won any awards. What would be a 
more appropriate data type for this field?

Lab 1: Creating Objects for the Dartt Offsite Services 
Database
Problem:  Dartt Offsite Services is a local company that provides offsite data services and ­solutions. 
The company provides remote data backup, disaster recovery planning and services, website backup, 
and offsite storage of paper documents for small businesses and nonprofit organizations. Service rep-
resentatives are responsible for communicating data solutions to the client, scheduling backups and 
other tasks, and resolving any conflicts. The company recently decided to store its ­client and service 
rep data in a database. Each client is assigned to a single service rep, but each ­service rep may be 
assigned many clients. The database and the Service Rep table have been ­created, but the Monthly 
Salary field needs to be added to the table. The records shown in Table 1–6 must be added to the 
Service Rep table. The company plans to import the Client table from the Excel worksheet shown in 
Figure 1–86. Dartt would like to finish storing this data in a database and has asked you to help.

Lab 2: Creating the Tennis Logos Database
Problem:  Tennis Logos supplies customized tennis clothing and accessories for clubs and tourna-
ments. The company purchases these items from suppliers at wholesale prices and adds the custom-
er’s logo. The final item price is determined by marking up the wholesale price and adding a fee that 
is based on the complexity of the logo. Tennis Logos also does graphic design work for customers. 
Currently, the information about the items and the suppliers is stored in two Excel workbooks. Each 
item is assigned to a single supplier, but each supplier may be assigned many items. You are to create 
a database that will store the item and supplier information. You already have determined that you 
need two tables, a Supplier table and an Item table, in which to store the information.
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.

the new table. Assign the name Client to the table. Save the Import steps, and assign the name 
Import-Client Data to the steps. Assign Import Client Data as the description.
	 6.	Open the Client table in Design view and make the following changes:
a.	 Change the field size for the Client Number field to 5. Change the field size for the Client 
Name field to 30. Change the field size for the Street and City fields to 20. Change the 
field size for the State field to 2 and the field size for the Postal Code field to 5. Change the 
field size for the Service Rep Number field to 2.
b.	 Add the caption CL # to the Client Number field.
c.	 Add the caption SR # to the Service Rep Number field.
	 7.	Save the changes to the Client table. If a Microsoft Access dialog box appears with the ‘Some 
data may be lost’ message, click the Yes button.
	 8.	Open the Client table in Datasheet view and resize all columns to best fit the data. Save the 
changes to the layout of the table.
	 9.	Create a query using the Simple Query Wizard for the Client table that displays the Client Number, 
Client Name, Amount Paid, Balance Due, and Service Rep Number. Save the query as Client Query.
	10.	Create the report shown in Figure 1–87 for the Client table. The report should include the 
Client Number, Client Name, Amount Paid, Balance Due, and Service Rep Number fields. 
Include totals for the Amount Paid and Balance Due fields. Be sure to change the column 
headings to those shown in Figure 1–87. Save the report as Client Financial Report.

www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for in-
formation about accessing the required files.
Personal/Academic
Part 1:  You attend a college that is renowned for its school of arts and crafts. Students who major 
in arts and crafts can sell their designs online through the college bookstore. The bookstore has 
used an Excel workbook to store data on wood-crafted items as well as the students who created 
the items. Because you are a major in computer science and also are studying woodworking, your 
senior project is to create a database of these wood-crafted items. The database must keep track of 
the wood-crafted items for sale and maintain data on the students who created the items. Each item 
is created by a single student, but each student may have created several items.
Based on the information in the Your Turn 1–1 Craft workbook, use the concepts and tech-
niques presented in this chapter to design and create a database to store the craft data. Create a 
Wood Crafts for Sale report that lists the item number, description, price, and student code. Submit 
your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while determining the table structures and adding data to 
the tables in this assignment. What method did you use to add the data to each table? Are there any 
other methods that also would have worked?

Research and Collaboration
Part 1:  In today’s world, most college students will own at least one electronic device, such as a cell 
phone. Many students have multiple electronic devices. Microsoft Access includes a desktop Asset 
tracking template that you can modify to keep track of your electronic devices, such as cell phone, 
MP3 player, and computer. Get together with your group and make a list of the electronic ­devices 
that each of you own. Use the desktop Asset tracking template to create an Electronic ­Assets 
­database. Watch the video to learn how the database works. As a team, review the fields in the 
­Assets table and decide which fields to include in the database. Delete any unwanted fields. Decide 
how you will describe each device, for example, will you use the term cell phone, smartphone, or 
mobile phone? Have each team member enter at least two devices. Create a query to find one type 
of device, such as cell phone. Submit your assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Part 2: 
 You made several decisions while creating the Electronic Assets database. Which fields 
did you decide to delete from the Assets table? What terms did you use to describe each device?

Introduction
One of the primary benefits of using a database management system such as Access is 
having the ability to find answers to questions related to data stored in the database. 
When you pose a question to Access, or any other database management system, the 
question is called a query. A query is simply a question presented in a way that Access 
can process.
To find the answer to a question, you first create a corresponding query using 
the techniques illustrated in this chapter. After you have created the query, you instruct 
Access to run the query, that is, to perform the steps necessary to obtain the answer. 
Access then displays the answer in Datasheet view.
Project — Querying a Database
One of the most important benefits of using Access to manage a database is 
easily finding the answers to questions and requests. Figure 2–1 presents examples of 
such queries, which concern the data in the Bavant Publishing database.
In addition to these questions, Bavant Publishing managers need to find 
information about customers located in a specific city, but they want to enter a 
different city each time they ask the question. The company can use a parameter query 
to accomplish this task. Bavant Publishing managers also want to summarize data in a 
specific way, which might involve performing calculations, and they can use a crosstab 
query to present the data in the desired form.

Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to create and use the queries shown in 
Figure 2–1 on the previous page. The following roadmap identifies general activities 
you will perform as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 create queries in Design view.
2.	 use criteria in queries.
3.	 sort data in queries.
4.	 join tables in queries.
5.	 export query results.
6.	 perform calculations in queries.
7.	 create a crosstab query.
8.	 customize the navigation pane.
At the beginning of the step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see 
an abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 3 SORT DATA activity.
1 create queries | 2 use criteria | 3 sort data | 4 join tables | 5 export results
6 perform calculations | 7 create crosstab | 8 customize navigation pane
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter.
To Run Access
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter 
and you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change 
your screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a 
computer’s resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of 
this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows is running, use the Start 
screen or the search box to run Access based on a typical installation. You may 
need to ask your instructor how to run Access on your computer. For a detailed 
example of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows 
chapter. 
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for an Access 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains an Access 
2013 tile, tap or click it to run Access and then proceed to Step 5; if the Start screen 
does not contain the Access 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search for the 
Access app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of 
the screen to display the Charms bar, and then tap or click the Search charm on the 
Charms bar to display the Search menu.

To Open a Database from Access
In the previous chapter, you created the Bavant Publishing database in an 
appropriate storage location. The following steps open the database from the location 
you specified when you first created it (for example, the Access folder in the CIS 101 
folder). For a detailed example of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.

Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view, if necessary.
	2	
If the database you want to open is displayed in the Recent list, tap or click the file 
name to open the database and display the opened database in the Access window; 
then skip to Step 7. If the database you want to open is not displayed in the Recent 
list or if the Recent list does not appear, tap or click ‘Open Other Files’ to display the 
Open Gallery.
	3	
If the database you want to open is displayed in the Recent list in the Open gallery, 
tap or click the file name to open the database and display the opened database in 
the Access window; then skip to Step 7.
	4	
Tap or click Computer, SkyDrive, or another location in the left pane and then 
navigate to the location of the database to be opened (for example, the Access folder 
in the CIS 101 folder).
	5	
Tap or click Bavant Publishing to select the database to be opened.
	6	
Tap or click the Open button (Open dialog box) to open the selected file and display 
the opened database in the Access window.
	7	
If a Security Warning appears, tap or click the Enable Content button.
Creating Queries
As you learned in Chapter 1, you can use queries in Access to find answers to questions 
about the data contained in the database. Note: In this chapter, you will save each 
query example. When you use a query for another task, such as to create a form or 
report, you will assign a specific name to a query, for example, Rep-Customer Query. 
In situations in which you will not use the query again, you will assign a name using 
a convention that includes the chapter number and a query number, for example, 
Ch2q01. Queries are numbered consecutively.
One of the few 
­differences between 
Windows 7 and 
­Windows 8 occurs 
in the steps to run 
Access. If you are 
­using Windows 7, 
click the Start button, 
type   ­Access   in the 
‘Search programs and 
files’ box, click Access 
2013, and then, if nec-
essary, maximize the 
Access window. For 
detailed steps to run 
Access in Windows 7, 
refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this 
book. For a summary 
of the steps, refer to 
the Quick Reference 
located at the back of 
this book.

To Create a Query in Design View
In Chapter 1, you used the Simple Query Wizard to create a query. Most of the time, however, you will 
use Design view, which is the primary option for creating queries. Why? Once you have created a new query in 
Design view, you have more options than with the wizard and can specify fields, criteria, sorting, calculations, and so on. 
The following steps create a new query in Design view.

To Add Fields to the Design Grid
Once you have a new query displayed in Design view, you are ready to make entries in the design grid, 
the portion of the window where you specify fields and criteria for the query. The design grid is located in the 
lower pane of the window. You add the fields you want included in the query to the Field row in the grid. Why 
add fields to the grid? Only the fields that appear in the design grid will be included in the query results. The following 
step begins creating a query that Bavant Publishing might use to obtain the customer number, customer name, 
amount paid, and current due for a particular customer.

Determining Criteria
When you use queries, usually you are looking for those records that satisfy 
some criterion. In the simple query you created in the previous chapter, for example, 
you entered a criterion to restrict the records to those with the book rep number 53. 
In another query, you might want the name, amount paid, and current due amounts 
for the customer whose number is CSU10, for example, or for those customers whose 
names start with the letters, Gr. You enter criteria in the Criteria row in the design grid 
below the field name to which the criterion applies. For example, to indicate that the 
customer number must be CSU10, you first must add the Customer Number field to 
the design grid. You then would type CSU10 in the Criteria row below the Customer 
Number field.
Running the Query
After adding the appropriate fields and defining the query’s criteria, you 
must run the query to get the results. To view the results of the query from 
Design view, tap or click the Run button to instruct Access to run the query, 
that is, to perform the necessary actions to produce and display the results in 
Datasheet view.

To Use Text Data in a Criterion
To use text data (data in a field whose data type is Short Text) in criteria, simply type the text in the 
Criteria row below the corresponding field name, just as you did in Chapter 1. In Access, you do not need to 
enclose text data in quotation marks as you do in many other database management systems. Why? Access will 
enter the quotation marks automatically, so you can simply type the desired text. The following steps finish creating 
a query that Bavant Publishing might use to obtain the customer number, customer name, amount paid, and 
current due amount of customer CSU10. These steps add the appropriate criterion so that only the desired 
customer will appear in the results. The steps also save the query.

Using Saved Queries
After you have created and saved a query, you can use it in a variety of ways:
•	To view the results of a query that is not currently open, open it by pressing 
and holding or right-clicking the query in the Navigation Pane and tapping or 
clicking Open on the shortcut menu.
•	If you want to change the design of a query that is already open, return to Design 
view and make the changes.
•	If you want to change the design of a query that is not currently open, press and 
hold or right-click the query in the Navigation Pane and then tap or click Design 
View on the shortcut menu to open the query in Design view.
•	To print the results with a query open, tap or click File on the ribbon, tap or 
click the Print tab in the Backstage view, and then tap or click Quick Print.
•	To print a query without first opening it, be sure the query is selected in the 
Navigation Pane and tap or click File on the ribbon, tap or click the Print tab in 
the Backstage view, and then tap or click Quick Print.
•	You can switch between views of a query using the View button (home tab | 
Views group). Tapping or clicking the arrow at the bottom of the button produces 
the View button menu. You then tap or click the desired view in the menu. The 
two query views you use in this chapter are Datasheet view (to see the results)

simply tap or click the button.
Wildcards
Microsoft Access supports wildcards. Wildcards are symbols that represent any 
character or combination of characters. One common wildcard, the asterisk (*), represents 
any collection of characters. Another wildcard symbol is the question mark (?), which 
represents any individual character. 
What does S* represent? What does T?m represent?
S* represents the letter, S, followed by any collection of characters. T?m represents the letter, T, followed by any single 
­character, followed by the letter, m. A search for T?m might return the names Tim or Tom.
CONSIDER THIS
To Use a Wildcard
The following steps modify the previous query to use the asterisk wildcard so that Bavant Publishing can 
select only those customers whose names begin with S. Why? Because you do not know how many characters will 
follow the S, the asterisk wildcard symbol is appropriate. The steps also save the query with a new name using the 
Save As command.

If you tapped or clicked the Save 
button, you would replace the 
previous query with the version 
you just created. Because you 
want to save both the previous 
query and the new one, you need 
to save the new version with a different name. To do so, you must use Save Object As, 
which is available through the Backstage view.

Although you usually would want 
to save the query as another

To Use Criteria for a Field Not  
Included in the Results
In some cases, you might require criteria for a particular field that should not appear in the results of the 
query. For example, you may want to see the customer number, customer name, address, and amount paid for all 
customers located in Gaston. The criteria involve the City field, but you do not want to include the City field in 
the results.
To enter a criterion for the City field, it must be included in the design grid. Normally, it would then 
appear in the results. To prevent this from happening, remove the check mark from its Show check box in the 
Show row of the grid. Why? A check mark in the Show Check box instructs Access to show the field in the result. If you 
remove the check mark, you can use the field in the query but not display it in the query results.
The following steps modify the previous query so that Bavant Publishing can select only those customers 
located in Gaston. Bavant does not want the city to appear in the results, however. The steps also save the query 
with a new name.

Criteria including wildcards need 
to be preceded by the word, 
Like. However, you do not have 
to type it; Access adds the word 
automatically to any criterion 
involving a wildcard.
•	Erase the criterion in the Criteria 
row of the Customer Name field.

Creating a Parameter Query
If you wanted to find customers located in Adelphia instead of Gaston, you 
would either have to create a new query or modify the existing query by replacing 
Gaston with Adelphia as the criterion. Rather than giving a specific criterion when 
you first create the query, occasionally you may want to be able to enter part of the 
criterion when you run the query and then have the appropriate results appear. For 
example, you might want a query to return the customer number, customer name, and 
amount paid for all customers in a specific city, specifying a different city each time you 
run the query. A user could run the query, enter Adelphia as the city, and then see all 
the customers in Adelphia. Later, the user could use the same query but enter Gaston 
as the city, and then see all the customers in Gaston.
To enable this flexibility, you create a parameter query, which is a query that 
prompts for input whenever it is used. You enter a parameter (the prompt for the user), 
rather than a specific value as the criterion. You create the parameter by enclosing a 
value in a criterion in square brackets. It is important that the value in the brackets 
does not match the name of any field. If you enter a field name in square brackets, 
Access assumes you want that particular field and does not prompt the user for input. 
To prompt the user to enter the city name as the input, you could place [Enter City] 
as the criterion in the City field.

Designing Queries
Before creating queries, 
examine the contents of the 
tables involved. You need 
to know the data type for 
each field and how the data 
for the field is stored. If a 
query includes a state, for 
example, you need to know 
whether state is stored as the  
two-character abbreviation or 
as the full state name.

Querying a Database   Access Chapter 2   AC 87
To Create and View a Parameter Query
The following steps create a parameter query. Why? The parameter query will give users at Bavant the ability 
to enter a different city when they run the query rather than having a specific city as part of the criterion in the query. 
The steps also save the query with a new name.

What is the purpose of the square 
brackets?
The square brackets indicate that 
the text entered is not text that the 
value in the column must match. 
Without the brackets, Access 
would search for records on which 
the city is Enter City.
What if I typed a field name in the square brackets?
Access would simply use the value in that field. To create a parameter 
query, you must not use a field name in the square brackets.

To Use a Parameter Query
You use a parameter query like any other saved query. You can open it or you can print the query results. In 
either case, Access prompts you to supply a value for the parameter each time you use the query. If changes have 
been made to the data since the last time you ran the query, the results of the query may be different, even if you 
enter the same value for the parameter. Why? As with other queries, the query always uses the data that is currently in 
the table. The following steps use the parameter query named Customer-City Query. 
•	Open the Navigation Pane.
•	Press and hold or right-click the 
Customer-City Query to produce a

To Use a Number in a Criterion
To enter a number in a criterion, type the number without any dollar signs or commas. Why? If you 
enter a dollar sign, Access assumes you are entering text. If you enter a comma, Access considers the criterion invalid. The 
following steps create a query that Bavant Publishing might use to display all customers whose current due 
amount is $0. The steps also save the query with a new name.
•	Close the Navigation Pane.
•	Tap or click CREATE on the ribbon 
to display the CREATE tab.
•	Tap or click the Query Design 
button (CREATE tab | Queries 
group) to create a new query.
•	Tap or click the Customer table 
(Show Table dialog box) to select 
the table.
•	Tap or click the Add button to add the selected table to the query.
•	Tap or click the Close button to remove the dialog box from the screen.
•	Drag the lower edge of the field list down far enough so all fields in the list are displayed.
•	Include the Customer Number, Customer Name, Amount Paid, and Current Due fields in the query.
•	Type   0   as the criterion for the Current Due field (Figure 2–23).
Do I need to enter a dollar sign and decimal point?
No. Access will interpret 0 as $0 because the data type for the Current Due field is currency.
•	Run the query (Figure 2–24).
Why did Access display the results 
as $0.00 when I only entered 0?
Access uses the format for the 
field to determine how to display 
the result. In this case, the format 
indicated that Access should 
include the dollar sign, decimal 
point, and two decimal places.
•	Save the query as Ch2q03.
How do I know when to use the 
Save button to save a query or use 
the Backstage view to perform a Save As?
If you are saving a new query, the simplest way is to use the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you are 
saving changes to a previously saved query but do not want to change the name, use the Save button. If you want 
to save a previously saved query with a new name, you must use the Backstage view and perform a Save Object As.
•	Close the query.

might want to find a range of results; for example, you could request customers whose 
current due is greater than $1,000.00. If you want a query to return something other 
than an exact match, you must enter the appropriate comparison operator. The 
comparison operators are > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), 
<= (less than or equal to), and NOT (not equal to).
To Use a Comparison Operator in a Criterion
The following steps use the > operator to create a query that Bavant Publishing might use to find all book 
reps whose start date is after 1/1/2013. Why? A date greater than 1/1/2013 means the date comes after 1/1/2013. 
The steps also save the query with a new name.
•	Start a new query using the Book 
Rep table.
•	Include the Book Rep Number, 
Last Name, First Name, and Start 
Date fields.
•	Type   >1/01/2013   as the 
criterion for the Start Date field 
(Figure 2–25).
Did I have to type the leading zero in the Day portion of the date?
No. You could have typed 1/1/2013. Some people often type the day using two digits,  
such as 1/01/2013. You also could have typed a leading zero in the month, 01/01/2013.
•	Run the query (Figure 2–26).
 Experiment
•	Return to Design view. Try a 
different criterion involving a 
comparison operator in the Start 
Date field and run the query. 
When finished, return to Design 
view, enter the original criterion 
(>1/01/2013) in the Start Date field, and run the query.
I returned to Design view and noticed that Access changed 1/01/2013 to #1/01/2013#. Why does the date now have 
number signs around it? 
This is the date format in Access. You usually do not have to enter the number signs because in most cases Access 
will insert them automatically.
My records are in a different order. Is this a problem?
No. The important thing is which records are included in the results. You will see later in this chapter how you can 
specify the specific order you want for cases when the order is important.
Can I use the same comparison operators with text data? 
Yes. Comparison operators function the same whether you use them with number fields, currency fields, date fields, 
or text fields.
•	Save the query as Ch2q04.

Access Chapter 2
Querying a Database   Access Chapter 2   AC 91
Using Compound Criteria
Often your search data must satisfy more than one criterion. This type of 
criterion is called a compound criterion and is created using the words AND or OR.
In an AND criterion, each individual criterion must be true in order for the 
compound criterion to be true. For example, an AND criterion would allow you to 
find customers that have returns greater than $0.00 and whose book rep is book rep 42.
An OR criterion is true if either individual criterion is true. An OR criterion 
would allow you to find customers that have returns greater than $0.00 as well 
as customers whose book rep is book rep 42. In this case, any customer who has 
returns greater than $0.00 would be included in the answer, regardless of whether 
the customer’s book rep is book rep 42. Likewise, any customer whose book rep 
is book rep 42 would be included, regardless of whether the customer has returns 
greater than $0.00.
To Use a Compound Criterion Involving AND
To combine criteria with AND, place the criteria on the same row of the design grid. Why? Placing the 
criteria in the same row indicates that both criteria must be true in Access. The following steps use an AND criterion 
to enable Bavant to find those customers who have returns greater than $0.00 and whose book rep is rep 42. 
The steps also save the query.

Query-By-Example, often 
referred to as QBE, was 
a query language first 
proposed in the mid-1970s. 
In this approach, users asked 
questions by filling in a table 
on the screen. The Access 
approach to queries is based 
on Query-By-Example.

Why? Placing criteria on separate rows indicates at least one criterion must be true in Access. The following steps use an 
OR criterion to enable Bavant to find those customers who have returns greater than $0.00 or whose book rep is 
rep 42 (or both). The steps also save the query with a new name.
1 create queries | 2 use criteria | 3 sort data | 4 join tables | 5 export results
6 perform calculations | 7 create crosstab | 8 customize navigation pane
•	Return to Design view.
•	If necessary, tap or click the 
Criteria entry for the Book Rep 
Number field and then use the 
backspace key or the delete key to 
erase the entry (“42”).
•	Tap or click the or row (the row 
below the Criteria row) for the 
Book Rep Number field, and 
then type   42   as the entry 
(Figure 2–29).

•	Run the query (Figure 2–30).

Special Criteria
You can use three special criteria in queries:
1.	 If you want to create a criterion involving a range of values in a single field, you 
can use the AND operator. You place the word AND between the individual 
conditions. For example, if you wanted to find all customers whose amount paid is 
greater than or equal to $20,000.00 and less than or equal to $40,000.00, you would 
enter   >= 20000 AND <= 40000   as the criterion in the Amount Paid column.
2.	 You can select values in a given range by using the BETWEEN operator. This is 
often an alternative to the AND operator. For example, to find all customers whose 
amount paid is between $20,000.00 and $40,000.00, inclusive, you would enter   
BETWEEN 20000 AND 40000   as the criterion in the Amount Paid column.
3.	 You can select a list of values by using the IN operator. You follow the word IN 
with the list of values in parentheses. For example, to find customers whose book 
rep number is 42 and customers whose book rep is 65 using the IN operator, you 
would enter   IN (“42”,”65”)   on the Criteria row in the Book Rep Number 
column. Unlike when you enter a simple criterion, you must enclose text values 
in quotation marks.

Sorting
In some queries, the order in which the records appear is irrelevant. All you need to be 
concerned about are the records that appear in the results. It does not matter which 
one is first or which one is last.
In other queries, however, the order can be very important. You may want to see 
the cities in which customers are located and would like them arranged alphabetically. 
Perhaps you want to see the customers listed by book rep number. Further, within all 
the customers of any given book rep, you might want them to be listed by amount paid 
from largest amount to smallest.
To order the records in a query result in a particular way, you sort the records. 
The field or fields on which the records are sorted is called the sort key. If you are 
sorting on more than one field (such as sorting by amount paid within book rep 
number), the more important field (Book Rep Number) is called the major key (also 
called the primary sort key) and the less important field (Amount Paid) is called the 
minor key (also called the secondary sort key).
To sort in Microsoft Access, specify the sort order in the Sort row of the design 
grid below the field that is the sort key. If you specify more than one sort key, the sort 
key on the left will be the major sort key, and the one on the right will be the minor key.
How would you find customers whose book rep number is 42 or 65 without using the IN operator?
Place the number 42 in the Criteria row of the Book Rep Number column. Place the number 65 in the or row of the Book Rep 
Number column.
CONSIDER THIS
To Clear the Design Grid
Why? If the fields you want to include in the next query are different from those in the previous query, it is usually 
simpler to start with a clear grid, that is, one with no fields already in the design grid. You always can clear the entries in 
the design grid by closing the query and then starting over. A simpler approach to clearing the entries is to select 
all the entries and then press the delete key. The following steps return to Design view and clear the design grid.
1 create queries | 2 use criteria | 3 sort data | 4 join tables | 5 export results
6 perform calculations | 7 create crosstab | 8 customize navigation pane
•	Return to Design view.
•	Tap or click just above the 
Customer Number column heading 
in the grid to select the column.
I clicked above the column 
heading, but the column is not 
selected. What should I do?
You did not point to the correct 
location. Be sure the pointer 
changes into a down-pointing 
arrow and then tap or click again.
•	Hold the shift key down and tap 
or click just above the Book Rep 
Number column heading to select 
all the columns (Figure 2–31).
•	Press the delete key to clear the design grid.

Sorting Data  
in a Query
When sorting data in a query, 
the records in the underlying 
tables (the tables on which the 
query is based) are not actually 
rearranged. Instead, the DBMS 
determines the most efficient 
method of simply displaying 
the records in the requested 
order. The records in the 
underlying tables remain in 
their original order.
BTW
Clearing the Design Grid
You also can clear the design grid 
using the ribbon. To do so, tap or

the Advanced menu, and then

To Sort Data in a Query
If you determine that the query results should be sorted, you will need to specify the sort key. The following 
steps sort the cities in the Customer table by indicating that the City field is to be sorted. The steps specify 
Ascending sort order. Why? When sorting text data, Ascending sort order arranges the results in alphabetical order.

To Omit Duplicates
When you sort data, duplicates normally are included. In the query shown in Figure 2–34, for example, 
Adelphia appears three times. Several other cities appear twice. You eliminate duplicates using the query’s 
property sheet. A property sheet is a window containing the various properties of the object. To omit duplicates, 
you will use the property sheet to change the Unique Values property from No to Yes.

To Sort on Multiple Keys
The following steps sort on multiple keys. Specifically, Bavant needs the data to be sorted by amount paid 
(low to high) within book rep number, which means that the Book Rep Number field is the major key and the 
Amount Paid field is the minor key. The steps place the Book Rep Number field to the left of the Amount Paid 
field. Why? In Access, the major key must appear to the left of the minor key. The steps also save the query with a 
new name.

for Book Rep Number and

each case, run the query to see 
the effect of the changes. When 
finished, select Ascending as the 
sort order for both fields.
What if the Amount Paid field 
is to the left of the Book Rep 
Number field?
It is important to remember that 
the major sort key must appear to the left of the minor sort key in the design grid. If you attempted to sort by 
amount paid within book rep number, but placed the Amount Paid field to the left of the Book Rep Number field, 
your results would be incorrect.
•	Save the query as Ch2q08.

Q&A

Figure 2–39
Is there any way to sort the records in this same order, but have the Amount Paid field appear to the 
left of the Book Rep Number field in the query results?
Yes. Remove the check mark from the Book Rep Number field, and then add an additional Book Rep Number field at the end 
of the query. The first Book Rep Number field will be used for sorting but will not appear in the results. The second will appear 
in the results, but will not be involved in the sorting process.
How do you approach the creation of a query that might involve sorting?
Examine the query or request to see if it contains words such as order or sort. Such words imply that the order of the query 
­results is important. If so, you need to sort the query.
If sorting is required, identify the field or fields on which the results are to be sorted. In the request, look for language such as 
ordered by or sort the results by, both of which would indicate that the specified field is a sort key.
If using multiple sort keys, determine the major and minor keys. If you are using two sort keys, determine which one is the 
more important, or the major key. Look for language such as sort by amount paid within book rep number, which implies that 
the overall order is by book rep number. In this case, the Book Rep Number field would be the major sort key and the Amount 
Paid field would be the minor sort key.
Determine sort order. Words such as increasing, ascending, or low-to-high imply Ascending order. Words such as decreasing, 
descending, or high-to-low imply Descending order. Sorting in alphabetical order implies Ascending order. If there were no 
words to imply a particular order, you would typically use Ascending.
Examine the query or request to see if there are any special restrictions. One common restriction is to exclude duplicates. 
­Another common restriction is to list only a certain number of records, such as the first five records.

To Create a Top-Values Query
Rather than show all the results of a query, you may want to show only a specified number of records or 
a percentage of records. Why? You might not need to see all the records, just enough to get a general idea of the results. 
Creating a top-values query allows you to restrict the number of records that appear. When you sort records, 
you can limit results to those records having the highest (descending sort) or lowest (ascending sort) values. To 
do so, first create a query that sorts the data in the desired order. Next, use the Return box on the Design tab 
to change the number of records to be included from All to the desired number or percentage. 
The following steps create a query for Bavant Publishing that shows only the first five records that were 
included in the results of the previous query. The steps also save the resulting query with a new name.

Return menu (Figure 2–40).
1
•	Tap or click 5 in the Return menu 
to specify that the query results 
should contain the first five rows.
Could I have typed the 5? What 
about other numbers that do not 
appear in the list?
Yes, you could have typed the 5. 
For numbers not appearing in the 
list, you must type the number.
•	Run the query (Figure 2–41).
•	Save the query as Ch2q09.
•	Close the query.
Do I need to close the query 
before creating my next query?
Not necessarily. When you use a top-values query, however, it is important to change the value in the Return 
box back to All. If you do not change the Return value back to All, the previous value will remain in effect. 
Consequently, you might not get all the records you should in the next query. A good practice whenever you use 
a top-values query is to close the query as soon as you are done. That way, you will begin your next query from 
scratch, which guarantees that the value is reset to All.

Joining Tables
In designing a query, you need to determine whether more than one table is required. 
For example, if the question being asked involves data from both the Customer and 
Book Rep tables, then both tables are required for the query. A query might require 
listing the number and name of each customer (from the Customer table) along with 
the number and name of the customer’s book rep (from the Book Rep table). Both 
the Customer and Book Rep tables are required for this query. You need to join the 
tables to find records in the two tables that have identical values in matching fields 
(Figure 2–42). In this example, you need to find records in the Customer table and the 
Book Rep table that have the same value in the Book Rep Number fields.

Ad Hoc Relationships
When you join tables in a 
query, you are creating an 
ad hoc relationship, that 
is, a relationship between 
tables created for a specific 
purpose. In Chapter 3, you 
will create general-purpose 
relationships using the 
Relationships window.
BTW
Join Line
If you do not get a join line 
automatically, there may 
be a problem with one of 
your table designs. Open 
each table in Design view 
and make sure that the data 
types are the same for the 
matching field in both tables 
and that one of the matching 
fields is the primary key in a 
table. Correct these errors 
and create the query again.

AC 100   Access Chapter 2   Querying a Database
To Join Tables
If you have determined that you need to join tables, you first will bring field lists for both tables to the 
upper pane of the Query window while working in Design view. Access will draw a line, called a join line, 
between matching fields in the two tables, indicating that the tables are related. You then can select fields from 
either table. Access joins the tables automatically.
The first step is to create a new query and add the Book Rep table to the query. Then, add the Customer 
table to the query. A join line should appear, connecting the Book Rep Number fields in the two field lists. Why 
might the join line not appear? If the names of the matching fields differ from one table to the other, Access will not 
insert the line. You can insert it manually, however, by tapping or clicking one of the two matching fields and dragging the 
pointer to the other matching field.
The following steps create a query to display information from both the Customer table and the Book Rep 
table.

•	Tap or click the Add button (Show 
Table dialog box) to add a field

•	Close the Show Table dialog box 
by tapping or clicking the Close 
button.
•	Expand the size of the two field 
lists so all the fields in the Book 
Rep and Customer tables appear 
(Figure 2–44).
I did not get a join line. What should I do?
Ensure that the names of the matching fields are the same, the data types are the same, and the matching field is 
the primary key in one of the two tables. If all of these factors are true and you still do not have a join line, you can 
produce one by pointing to a matching field and dragging to the other matching field.

such a record to be displayed, you need to change the join properties, which are the properties that indicate 
which records appear in a join. The following steps change the join properties of the Rep-Customer Query so 
that Bavant can include all book reps in the results, rather than only those reps who have already been assigned 
customers.

To Create a Report from a Query  
You can use queries in the creation of reports. The report in Figure 2–50 involves data from more than 
one table. Why? The Last Name and First Name fields are in the Book Rep table. The Customer Number and Customer 
Name fields are in the Customer table. The Book Rep Number field is in both tables. The easiest way to create such a 
report is to base it on a query that joins the two tables. The following steps use the Report Wizard and the ­ 
Rep-Customer Query to create the report.

Access Chapter 2
Querying a Database   Access Chapter 2   AC 105
How would you approach the creation of a query that might involve multiple tables?
Examine the request to see if all the fields involved in the request are in one table. If the fields are in two (or more) tables, you 
need to join the tables.
If joining is required, identify the matching fields in the two tables that have identical values. Look for the same column name 
in the two tables or for column names that are similar.
Determine whether sorting is required. Queries that join tables often are used as the basis for a report. If this is the case, it 
may be necessary to sort the results. For example, the Rep-Customer Report is based on a query that joins the Book Rep and 
­Customer tables. The query is sorted by book rep number and customer number.
Examine the request to see if there are any special restrictions. For example, the user only may want customers whose current 
due amount is $0.00.
Examine the request to see if you only want records from both tables that have identical values in matching fields. If you want 
to see records in one of the tables that do not have identical values, then you need to change the join properties.

Creating a Form for a Query
In the previous chapter, you created a form for the Customer table. You also can create 
a form for a query. Recall that a form in a database is a formatted document with fields 
that contain data. Forms allow you to view and maintain data.
To Create a Form for a Query
The following steps create a form, then save the form. Why? The form will be available for future use in 
viewing the data in the query.

To Export Data to Excel
For Bavant Publishing to make the Rep-Customer Query available to Excel users, it needs to export the 
data. To export data to Excel, select the table or query to be exported and then tap or click the Excel button in 
the Export group on the External Data tab. The steps on the next page export the Rep-Customer Query 
to Excel and save the export steps. Why save the export steps? By saving the export steps, you could easily repeat the 
export process whenever you like without going through all the steps. You would use the saved steps to export data in 
the future by tapping or clicking the Saved Exports button (External Data tab | Export group) and then 
selecting the steps you saved.

Using a Form
After you have saved a form, you can use it at any time by pressing and holding 
or right-clicking the form in the Navigation Pane and then tapping or clicking Open 
on the shortcut menu. If you plan to use the form to enter data, you must ensure you 
are viewing the form in Form view.
Exporting Data from Access to Other 
Applications
You can export, or copy, tables or queries from an Access database so that another 
application (for example, Excel or Word) can use the data. The application that 
will receive the data determines the export process to be used. You can export to 
text files in a variety of formats. For applications to which you cannot directly 
export data, you often can export an appropriately formatted text file that the 
other application can import. Figure 2–56 shows the workbook produced by 
exporting the Rep-Customer Query to Excel. The columns in the workbook have 
been resized to best fit the data.
BTW
Distributing 
a Document
Instead of printing and 
distributing a hard copy of a 
document, you can distribute 
the document electronically. 
Options include sending the 
document via email; posting 
it on cloud storage (such as 
SkyDrive) and sharing the 
file with others; posting it 
on a social networking site, 
blog, or other website; and 
sharing a link associated 
with an online location of 
the document. You also can 
create and share a PDF or 
XPS image of the document, 
so that users can view the 
file in Acrobat Reader or XPS 
Viewer instead of in Access.

To Export Data to Word
It is not possible to export data from Access to the standard Word format. It is 
possible, however, to export the data as a rich text format (RTF) file, which Word can use. 
To export data from a query or table to an RTF file, you would use the following steps.
1.	 With the query or table to be exported selected in the Navigation Pane, tap or click 
the More button (External Data tab | Export group) and then tap or click 
Word on the More menu to display the Export-RTF File dialog box.
2.	 Navigate to the location in which to save the file and assign a file name.
3.	 Tap or click the Save button, and then tap or click the OK button to export the data.
4.	 Save the export steps if you want, or simply tap or click the Close button in the 
Export-RTF File dialog box to close the dialog box without saving the export steps.
Text Files
You also can export Access data to text files, which can be used for a variety of 
purposes. Text files contain unformatted characters, including alphanumeric characters, 
and some special characters, such as tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds.
In delimited files, each record is on a separate line and the fields are separated 
by a special character, called the delimiter. Common delimiters are tabs, semicolons, 
commas, and spaces. You also can choose any other value that does not appear within 
the field contents as the delimiter. The comma-separated values (CSV) file often used 
in Excel is an example of a delimited file.
In fixed-width files, the width of any field is the same on every record. For 
example, if the width of the first field on the first record is 12 characters, the width of 
the first field on every other record also must be 12 characters.
To Export Data to a Text File
When exporting data to a text file, you can choose to export the data with 
formatting and layout. This option preserves much of the formatting and layout in 
tables, queries, forms, and reports. For forms and reports, this is the only option for 
exporting to a text file.
If you do not need to preserve the formatting, you can choose either delimited 
or fixed-width as the format for the exported file. The most common option, especially 
if formatting is not an issue, is delimited. You can choose the delimiter. You also can 
choose whether to include field names on the first row. In many cases, delimiting with 
a comma and including the field names is a good choice.
To export data from a table or query to a comma-delimited file in which the first 
row contains the column headings, you would use the following steps.
1.	 With the query or table to be exported selected in the Navigation Pane, tap or 
click the Text File button (External Data tab | Export group) to display the 
Export-Text File dialog box.
2.	 Select the name and location for the file to be created.
3.	 If you need to preserve formatting and layout, be sure the ‘Export data with 
­formatting and layout’ check box is checked. If you do not need to preserve 
­formatting and layout, make sure the check box is not checked. Once you have 
made your selection, tap or click the OK button in the Export-Text File dialog box.
4.	 To create a delimited file, be sure the Delimited option button is selected in the 
Export Text Wizard dialog box. To create a fixed-width file, be sure the Fixed Width 
option button is selected. Once you have made your selection, tap or click the Next 
button.
BTW
Exporting Data
You frequently need to 
export data so that it can be 
used in other applications 
and by other users in an 
organization. For example, 
the Accounting department 
might require financial data 
in an Excel format to perform 
certain financial functions. 
Marketing might require 
a list of customer names 
and addresses in Word or 
RTF format for marketing 
campaigns.
BTW
Saving Export Steps
Because query results are 
based on the data in the 
underlying tables, a change 
to an underlying table would 
result in a new query answer. 
For example, if the last name 
for book rep 42 changed 
from Perez to Smith, the 
change would be made in 
the Book Rep table. If you 
run the Rep-Customer Query 
again and export the query 
using the saved export steps, 
the Excel workbook would 
show the changed name.
BTW
Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 
101, a good practice would 
be to save all Access files in 
an Access folder in a CIS 101 
folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of 
this book.

Adding Criteria to a Join Query
Sometimes you will want to join tables, but you will not want to include all possible 
records. For example, you would like to create a report showing only those customers 
whose amount paid is greater than $20,000.00. In this case, you would relate the tables 
and include fields just as you did before. You also will include criteria. To include only 
those customers whose amount paid is more than $20,000.00, you will include >20000 
as a criterion for the Amount Paid field.
To Restrict the Records in a Join
The following steps modify the Rep-Customer Query so that the results for Bavant Publishing include a 
criterion. Why? Bavant wants to include only those customers whose amount paid is more than $20,000.00.
•	Open the Navigation Pane, if 
necessary, and then press and hold 
or right-click the Rep-Customer 
Query to produce a shortcut 
menu.
•	Tap or click Design View on the 
shortcut menu to open the Rep-
Customer Query in Design view.
•	Close the Navigation Pane.
•	Add the Amount Paid field to the 
query.
•	Type   >20000   as the criterion 
for the Amount Paid field 
(Figure 2–61).

Join Types
The type of join that finds 
records from both tables 
that have identical values in 
matching fields is called an 
inner join. An inner join is the 
default join in Access. Outer 
joins are used to show all the 
records in one table as well 
as the common records; that 
is, the records that share the 
same value in the join field. 
In a left outer join, all rows 
from the table on the left are 
included. In a right outer join, 
all rows from the table on the 
right are included.

Figure 2–62
Calculations
If a special calculation is required for a query, you need to determine whether the 
calculation is an individual record calculation (for example, adding the values in 
two fields) or a group calculation (for example, finding the total of the values in a 
particular field on all the records).
Bavant Publishing might want to know the total amount (amount paid and 
current due) from each customer. This would seem to pose a problem because the 
Customer table does not include a field for total amount. You can calculate it, however, 
because the total amount is equal to the amount paid plus the current due. A field that 
can be computed from other fields is called a calculated field or a computed field. 
A calculated field is an individual record calculation because each calculation only 
involves fields in a single record.
Bavant also might want to calculate the average amount paid for the customers 
of each book rep. That is, they may want the average for customers of book rep 42, the 
average for customers of book rep 53, and so on. This type of calculation is called a 
group calculation because each calculation involves groups of records. In this example, 
the customers of book rep 42 would form one group, the customers of book rep 53 
would be a second group, and the customers of book rep 65 would form a third group.
To Use a Calculated Field in a Query
If you need a calculated field in a query, you enter a name, or alias, for the calculated field, a colon, and 
then the calculation in one of the columns in the Field row of the design grid for the query. Any fields included 
in the expression must be enclosed in square brackets ([ ]). For example, for the total amount, you will type Total 
Amount:[Amount Paid]+[Current Due] as the expression.
You can type the expression directly into the Field row. The preferred method, however, is to select the 
column in the Field row and then use the Zoom command on its shortcut menu. When Access displays the 
Zoom dialog box, you can enter the expression. Why use the Zoom command? You will not be able to see the entire 
entry in the Field row, because the space available is not large enough.
You can use addition (1), subtraction (2), multiplication (*), or division (/) in calculations. If you have 
multiple calculations in an expression, you can include parentheses to indicate which calculations should be 
done first.

To Change a Caption
In Chapter 1, you changed the caption for a field in a table. When you assigned a caption, Access displayed 
it in datasheets and forms. If you did not assign a caption, Access displayed the field name. You also can change a 
caption in a query. Access will display the caption you assign in the query results. When you omitted duplicates, 
you used the query property sheet. When you change a caption in a query, you use the property sheet for the 
field. In the property sheet, you can change other properties for the field, such as the format and number of 
decimal places. The following steps change the caption of the Amount Paid field to Paid and the caption of the 
Current Due field to Due. Why? These changes give shorter, yet very readable, column headings for the fields. The steps 
also save the query with a new name.

•	If necessary, tap or click DESIGN on the ribbon to display the QUERY TOOLS DESIGN tab.
•	Tap or click the Amount Paid field in the design grid, and then tap or click the Property Sheet button

To Calculate Statistics
For group calculations, Microsoft Access supports several built-in statistics: COUNT (count of the 
number of records), SUM (total), AVG (average), MAX (largest value), MIN (smallest value), STDEV (standard 
deviation), VAR (variance), FIRST (first value), and LAST (last value). These statistics are called aggregate 
functions. An aggregate function is a function that performs some mathematical function against a group of 
records. To use an aggregate function in a query, you include it in the Total row in the design grid. In order to 
do so, you must first include the Total row by tapping or clicking the Totals button on the DESIGN tab. Why? 
The Total row usually does not appear in the grid. 
The following steps create a new query for the Customer table. The steps include the Total row in the 
design grid, and then calculate the average amount paid for all customers.

To Use Criteria in Calculating Statistics
Why? Sometimes calculating statistics for all the records in the table is appropriate. In other cases, however, you will 
need to calculate the statistics for only those records that satisfy certain criteria. To enter a criterion in a field, first you 
select Where as the entry in the Total row for the field, and then enter the criterion in the Criteria row. Access 
uses the word, Where, to indicate that you will enter a criterion. The following steps use this technique to 
calculate the average amount paid for customers of book rep 42. The steps also save the query with a new name.

AC 118   Access Chapter 2   Querying a Database
To Use Grouping
Why? Statistics often are used in combination with grouping; that is, statistics are calculated for groups of records. 
For example, Bavant could calculate the average amount paid for the customers of each book rep, which would require the 
average for the customers of book rep 42, the average for customers of book rep 53, and so on. Grouping means creating 
groups of records that share some common characteristic. In grouping by Book Rep Number, for example, the 
customers of book rep 42 would form one group, the customers of book rep 53 would form a second, and the 
customers of book rep 65 would form a third group. The calculations then are made for each group. To indicate 
grouping in Access, select Group By as the entry in the Total row for the field to be used for grouping.
The following steps create a query that calculates the average amount paid for customers of each book rep 
at Bavant Publishing. The steps also save the query with a new name.
1 create queries | 2 use criteria | 3 sort data | 4 join tables | 5 export results
6 perform calculations | 7 create crosstab | 8 customize navigation pane
•	Return to Design view and clear 
the design grid.
•	Include the Book Rep Number 
field in the query.
•	Include the Amount Paid field in 
the query.
•	Select Avg as the calculation in 
the Total row for the Amount Paid 
field (Figure 2–76).
Why was it not necessary to 
change the entry in the Total row 
for the Book Rep Number field?
Group By, which is the initial entry 
in the Total row when you add a field, is correct. Thus, you did not need to change the entry.

Crosstab Queries
A crosstab query, or simply, crosstab, calculates a statistic (for example, sum, 
average, or count) for data that is grouped by two different types of information. One 
of the types will appear down the side of the resulting datasheet, and the other will 
appear across the top. Crosstab queries are useful for summarizing data by category 
or group.

Access Chapter 2
Querying a Database   Access Chapter 2   AC 119
For example, if a query must summarize the sum of the returns grouped by both 
state and book rep number, you could have states as the row headings, that is, down the 
side. You could have book rep numbers as the column headings, that is, across the top. 
The entries within the datasheet represent the total of the returns. Figure 2–78 shows 
a crosstab in which the total of returns is grouped by both state and book rep number, 
with states down the left side and book rep numbers across the top. For example, the 
entry in the row labeled DE and in the column labeled 42 represents the total of the 
returns by all customers of book rep 42 who are located in Delaware.
Figure 2–78
Figure 2–79
How do you know when to use a crosstab query?
If data is to be grouped by two different types of information, you can use a crosstab query. You will need to identify the two 
types of information. One of the types will form the row headings and the other will form the column headings in the query 
results.
CONSIDER THIS
To Create a Crosstab Query
The following steps use the Crosstab Query Wizard to create a crosstab query. Why? Bavant Publishing

Customizing the Navigation Pane
Currently, the entries in the Navigation Pane are organized by object type. That is, 
all the tables are together, all the queries are together, and so on. You might want to 
change the way the information is organized. For example, you might want to have 
the Navigation Pane organized by table, with all the queries, forms, and reports 
associated with a particular table appearing after the name of the table. You also can 
use the Search bar to restrict the objects that appear to only those that have a certain 
collection of characters in their name. For example, if you entered the letters, Cu, only 
those objects containing Cu somewhere within the name will be included.

To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of the 
account from the Account gallery in the Backstage view before exiting Access. Signing 
out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can access SkyDrive 
files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following steps sign out of a 
Microsoft account from Access. For a detailed example of the procedure summarized 
below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
	1	
If you wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open 
the Backstage view and then tap or click the Account tab to display the Account gallery.

remove Windows accounts dialog box appears instead of the Remove Account dialog 
box, click the OK button and skip the remaining steps.
Why does a Can’t remove Windows accounts dialog box appear?
If you signed in to Windows using your Microsoft account, then you also must sign out 
from Windows, rather than signing out from within Access. When you are finished using 
Windows, be sure to sign out at that time.

What decisions will you need to make when creating queries?
Use these guidelines as you complete the assignments in this chapter and create your own queries outside of this class.
1.	Identify the fields by examining the question or request to determine which fields from the tables in the database are 
involved.
2.	Identify restrictions or the conditions that records must satisfy to be included in the results.
3.	Determine whether special order is required. 
a)	Determine the sort key(s). 
b)	If using two sort keys, determine the major and minor key.
c)	Determine sort order. If there are no words to imply a particular order, you would typically use Ascending.
d)	Determine restrictions, such as excluding duplicates.
4.	Determine whether more than one table is required. 
a)	Determine which tables to include.
b)	Determine the matching fields. 
c)	Determine whether sorting is required.
d)	Determine restrictions. 
e)	Determine join properties.
5.	Determine whether calculations are required. 
a)	For individual record calculations, determine the calculation and a name for the calculated field.
b)	For group calculations, determine the calculation as well as the field to be used for grouping.
6.	If data is to be summarized and the data is to be grouped by two different types of information, create a crosstab query.

How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require you to 
think beyond the assigned database. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your instructor. Possible 
formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that contains the answer; present 
your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio or video using a webcam, smartphone, or 
­portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.

Introduction
Once you have created a database and loaded it with data, you must maintain it. 
Maintaining the database means modifying the data to keep it up to date by adding 
new records, changing the data for existing records, and deleting records. Updating 
can include mass updates or mass deletions, that is, updates to, or deletions of, many 
records at the same time.
Maintenance of a database also can involve the need to restructure the 
database periodically, that is, to change the database structure. Restructuring can 
include adding new fields to a table, changing the characteristics of existing fields, and 
removing existing fields. Restructuring also includes the creation of validation rules 
and referential integrity. Validation rules ensure the validity of the data in the database, 
whereas referential integrity ensures the validity of the relationships. Maintaining a 
database also can include filtering records, a process that ensures that only the records 
that satisfy some criterion appear when viewing and updating the data in a table. 
Changing the appearance of a datasheet is a maintenance activity.
Project — Maintaining a Database
Bavant Publishing faces the task of keeping its database up to date. As the company 
takes on new customers and book reps, it will need to add new records, make changes 
to existing records, and delete records. Bavant believes that it can serve its customers 
better by changing the structure of the database to categorize the customers by type. 
The company will do this by adding a Customer Type field to the Customer table. 
Book reps believe they can maintain better customer relationships if the database 
includes the list of resources that are of interest to each customer. The company will 
do so by adding a Resources Needed field to the Customer table. Because customers 
may need more than one resource, this field will be a multivalued field, which is a field 
that can store multiple values or entries. Along with these changes, Bavant staff wants 
to change the appearance of a datasheet when displaying data.
Bavant would like the ability to make mass updates, that is, to update or delete 
many records in a single operation. It wants rules that make sure users can enter only 
valid, or appropriate, data into the database. Bavant also wants to ensure that the 
database cannot contain the name of a customer who is not associated with a specific 
book rep.
Figure 3–1 summarizes some of the various types of activities involved in 
maintaining the Bavant Publishing database.

Roadmap 
In this chapter, you will learn how to maintain a database by performing the 
tasks shown in Figure 3–1. The following roadmap identifies general activities you will 
perform as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 update records using a form.
2.	 filter records using various filtering options.
3.	 change the structure of a table.
4.	 Make mass changes to a table.
5.	 Create validation rules.
6.	 change the appearance of a datasheet.
7.	 Specify referential integrity.
8.	 order records in a datasheet.
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity; blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the 3 CHANGE STRUCTURE activity.
1 update records | 2 filter records | 3 change structure | 4 mass changes | 5 validation rules
6 change appearance | 7 referential integrity | 8 order records
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter.

To Run Access
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the search box to run Access based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Access on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter. 
	1	
Scroll the Start screen for an Access 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains an Access 
2013 tile, tap or click it to run Access and then proceed to Step 5; if the Start screen 
does not contain the Access 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search for the 
Access app.
	2	
Swipe in from the right edge of the screen or point to the upper-right corner of 
the screen to display the Charms bar, and then tap or click the Search charm on the 
Charms bar to display the Search menu.
	3	
Type   Access   as the search text in the Search text box and watch the search results 
appear in the Apps list.
	4	
Tap or click Access 2013 in the search results to run Access.
	5	
If the Access window is not maximized, tap or click the Maximize button on its title 
bar to maximize the window.
To Open a Database from Access
The following steps open the Bavant Publishing database from the location 
you specified when you first created it (for example, the Access folder in the CIS 101 
folder). For a detailed example of the procedure summarized below, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
	1	
Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view, if necessary.
	2	
If the database you want to open is displayed in the Recent list, tap or click the file 
name to open the database and display the opened database in the Access window; 
then skip to Step 7. If the database you want to open is not displayed in the Recent 
list or if the Recent list does not appear, tap or click ‘Open Other Files’ to display the 
Open Gallery.
	3	
If the database you want to open is displayed in the Recent list in the Open gallery, 
tap or click the file name to open the database and display the opened database in 
the Access window; then skip to Step 7.
	4	
Tap or click Computer, SkyDrive, or another location in the left pane and then 
navigate to the location of the database to be opened (for example, the Access folder 
in the CIS 101 folder).
	5	
Tap or click Bavant Publishing to select the database to be opened.
	6	
Tap or click the Open button (Open dialog box) to open the selected file and display 
the opened database in the Access window.
	7	
If a SECURITY WARNING appears, tap or click the Enable Content button.
One of the few 
­differences between 
Windows 7 and 
­Windows 8 occurs 
in the steps to run 
­Access. If you are ­using 
­Windows 7, click the 
Start button, type    
Access   in the 
‘Search programs and 
files’ box, click ­Access 
2013, and then, if 
­necessary, maximize 
the Access window. For 
detailed steps to run 
Access in Windows 7, 
refer to the Office and 
Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book. 
For a summary of the 
steps, refer to the Quick 
Reference located at the

To Create a Split Form
The following steps create a split form. Why? With a split form, you have the advantage of seeing a single 
record in a form, while simultaneously viewing several records in a datasheet.
Updating Records
Keeping the data in a database up to date requires updating records in three ways: 
adding new records, changing the data in existing records, and deleting existing 
records. In Chapter 1, you added records to a database using Datasheet view; that 
is, as you added records, the records appeared on the screen in a datasheet. The data 
looked like a table. When you need to add additional records, you can use the same 
techniques.
In Chapter 1, you used a simple form to view records. You also can use a split 
form, a form that allows you to simultaneously view both simple form and datasheet 
views of the data. You can use either portion of a split form to add or update records. 
To add new records, change existing records, or delete records, you use the same 
techniques you used in Datasheet view.
•	Open the Navigation Pane if it is 
currently closed.
•	If necessary, tap or click the 
Customer table in the Navigation 
Pane to select it.
•	Tap or click CREATE on the ribbon 
to display the CREATE tab.
•	Tap or click the More Forms 
button (CREATE tab | Forms group) 
to display the More Forms menu 
(Figure 3–2).

BTW
The Ribbon and 
Screen Resolution
Access may change how the 
groups and buttons within 
the groups appear on the 
ribbon, depending on the 
computer’s screen resolution. 
Thus, your ribbon may look 
different from the ones in 
this book if you are using a 
screen resolution other than 
1366 3 768.

Q&A
•	Tap or click the Form View button 
on the Access status bar to display 
the form in Form view rather than 
Layout view (Figure 3–4).
What is the difference between 
Form view and Layout view?
Form view is the view you use 
to view, enter, and update data. 
Layout view is the view you use to 
make design changes to the form. 
It shows you the form with data in 
it so you can immediately see the 
effects of any design changes you 
make, but is not intended to be 
used to enter and update data.

•	Tap or click the various  
Navigation buttons (First record, 
Next record, Previous record, Last

To Use a Form to Add Records
Once a form or split form is open in Form view, you can add records using the same techniques you used 
to add records in Datasheet view. In a split form, the changes you make on the form are automatically made on 
the datasheet. You do not need to take any special action. The following steps use the split form that you just 
created to add records. Why? With a split form, as you add a record, you can immediately see the effect of the addition 
on the datasheet.

a split form, in Datasheet view, 
or in Form view.
•	Tap or click the Cancel button (Find and Replace dialog box) to remove the dialog box from the screen.
Why does the button in the dialog box read, Find Next, rather than simply Find?
In some cases, after locating a record that satisfies a criterion, you might need to find the next record that satisfies 
the same criterion. For example, if you just found the first customer whose book rep number is 42, you then may 
want to find the second such customer, then the third, and so on. To do so, tap or click the Find Next button. You 
will not need to retype the value each time.

To Update the Contents of a Record
The following step uses Form view to change the name of customer PLI22 from PrattLast Institute 
to Pratt-Last Institute. Why? Bavant determined that this customer’s name was missing the hyphen. After locating 
the record to be changed, select the field to be changed by clicking the field. You also can press the tab key 
repeatedly until the desired field is selected. Then make the appropriate changes. (Clicking the field 
automatically produces an insertion point. If you use the tab key, you will need to press f2 to produce an 
insertion point.)
Can you replace one value with another using the Find and Replace dialog box?
Yes. Either tap or click the Replace button (HOME tab | Find group) or tap or click the Replace tab in the Find and Replace 
­dialog box. You then can enter both the value to find and the new value.

•	Type a hyphen (   -   ) before Last.
•	Press the tab key to complete the 
change and move to the next field 
(Figure 3–9).
Could I have changed the contents 
of the field in the datasheet 
portion of the split form?
Yes. You will first need to ensure 
the record to be changed appears 
in the datasheet. You then can 
change the value just as in the 
form.
Do I need to save my change?
No. Once you move to another 
record or close this form, the 
change to the name will become 
permanent.

Filtering Records
You can use the Find button in either Datasheet view or Form view to locate a record 
quickly that satisfies some criterion (for example, the customer number is PLI22). 
All records appear, however, not just the record or records that satisfy the criterion. 
To have only the record or records that satisfy the criterion appear, use a filter. Four 
types of filters are available: Filter By Selection, Common Filters, Filter By Form, and 
Advanced Filter/Sort. You can use a filter in either Datasheet view or Form view.

To Toggle a Filter
The Toggle Filter button toggles between filtered and unfiltered displays of the records in the table. That 
is, if only filtered records currently appear, clicking the Toggle Filter button will redisplay all records. If all 
records are currently displayed and there is a filter that is in effect, clicking the Toggle Filter button will display 
only the filtered records. If no filter is active, the Toggle Filter button will be dimmed, so clicking it would have 
no effect.
The following step toggles the filter. Why? Bavant wants to once again view all the records.
To Use a Common Filter
If you have determined you want to include those customers whose city begins with G, Filter By 
Selection would not be appropriate. Why? None of the options within Filter by Selection would support this type 
of criterion. You can filter individual fields by clicking the arrow to the right of the field name and using one 
of the common filters that are available for the field. You can modify a common filter by customizing it for 
the specific field. The following steps customize a common filter to include only those customers whose city 
begins with G.

To Use Filter By Form
Filter By Selection and the common filters method you just used are quick and easy ways to filter by the 
value in a single field. For filters that involve multiple fields, however, these methods are not appropriate, so you 
would use Filter By Form. Why? Filter By Form allows you to filter based on multiple fields and criteria. For example, 
Filter By Form would allow you to find only those customers whose returns are $0.00 and whose book rep 
number is 42. The following steps use Filter By Form to restrict the records that appear. 
1 update records | 2 filter records | 3 change structure | 4 mass changes | 5 validation rules
6 change appearance | 7 referential integrity | 8 order records
•	Tap or click the Advanced button 
(HOME tab | Sort & Filter group) 
to display the Advanced menu 
(Figure 3–19).

•	Tap or click ‘Clear All Filters’ on 
the Advanced menu to clear the 
existing filter.
•	Tap or click the Advanced button 
again to display the Advanced 
menu a second time.
•	Tap or click ‘Filter By Form’ on the 
Advanced menu.
•	Tap or click the blank row in the 
Returns field, tap or click the 
arrow that appears, and then tap 
or click 0 to specify the value in 
the Returns field.
•	Tap or click the Book Rep Number 
(BR #) field, tap or click the arrow 
that appears, and then tap or click 
42 (Figure 3–20).
Is there any difference in the 
process if I am viewing a table 
in Form view rather than in 
Datasheet view?
In Form view, you will make your 
entries in a form rather than a 
datasheet. Otherwise, the process 
is the same.

To Use Advanced Filter/Sort
In some cases, your criteria will be too complex even for Filter By Form. You might decide you want to 
include any customer whose returns are 0 and whose book rep number is 42. Additionally, you might want to 
include any customer whose returns are greater than $4,000, no matter who the customer’s book rep is. Further, 
you might want to have the results sorted by name. The following steps use Advanced Filter/Sort to accomplish 
this task. Why? Advanced Filter/Sort supports complex criteria as well as the ability to sort the results.

Q&A
Filters and Queries
Now that you are familiar with how filters work, you might notice similarities between 
filters and queries. Filters and queries are related in three ways.
1.	 You can apply a filter to the results of a query just as you can apply a filter to a 
table.
2.	 Once you create a filter using Advanced Filter/Sort, you can save the filter 
settings as a query by using the ‘Save as Query’ command on the Advanced 
menu.
3.	 You can restore filter settings that you previously saved in a query by using the 
‘Load from Query’ command on the Advanced menu.

Using Wildcards 
in Filters
Both the question mark(?) 
and the asterisk (*) wildcards 
can be used in filters created 
using Advanced Filter/Sort.

Access Chapter 3
Maintaining a Database   Access Chapter 3   AC 153
Changing the Database Structure
When you initially create a database, you define its structure; that is, you assign names 
and types to all the fields. In many cases, the structure you first define will not continue 
to be appropriate as you use the database.
Perhaps a field currently in the table no longer is necessary. If no one ever uses a 
particular field, it is not needed in the table. Because it is occupying space and serving 
no useful purpose, you should remove it from the table. You also would need to delete 
the field from any forms, reports, or queries that include it.
More commonly, an organization will find that it needs to maintain additional 
information that was not anticipated at the time the database was first designed. The 
organization’s own requirements may have changed. In addition, outside regulations 
that the organization must satisfy may change as well. Either case requires the addition 
of fields to an existing table.
Although you can make some changes to the database structure in Datasheet 
view, it is usually easier and better to make these changes in Design view.
To Delete a Field
If a field in one of your tables no longer is needed, you should delete the field; 
for example, it may serve no useful purpose, or it may have been included by mistake. 
To delete a field, you would use the following steps.
1. Open the table in Design view.
2. Tap or click the row selector for the field to be deleted.
3. Press the delete key.
4. When Access displays the dialog box requesting confirmation that you want to 
delete the field, tap or click the Yes button.
How do you determine whether to use a query or a filter?
The following guidelines apply to this decision.
If you think that you will frequently want to display records that satisfy this exact criterion, you should consider creating a query 
whose results only contain the records that satisfy the criterion. To display those records in the future, simply open the query.
If you are viewing data in a datasheet or form and decide you want to restrict the records to be included, it is easier to create 
a filter than a query. You can create and use the filter while you are viewing the data. 
If you have created a filter that you would like to be able to use again, you can save the filter as a query.
Once you have decided to use a filter, how do you determine which type of filter to use?
If your criterion for filtering is that the value in a particular field matches or does not match a certain specific value, you can use 
Filter By Selection.
If your criterion only involves a single field but is more complex (for example, the criterion specifies that the value in the field 
begins with a certain collection of letters) you can use a common filter.
If your criterion involves more than one field, use Filter By Form.
If your criterion involves more than a single And or Or, or if it involves sorting, you will probably find it simpler to use 
­Advanced Filter/Sort.
CONSIDER THIS
CONSIDER THIS
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can quit Access now. To resume at a later time, start 
Access, open the database called Bavant Publishing, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
BTW
Changing Data Types
It is possible to change the 
data type for a field that 
already contains data. Before 
doing so, you should consider 
the effect on other database 
objects, such as forms, 
queries, and reports. For 
example, you could convert 
a Short Text field to a Long 
Text field if you find that you 
do not have enough space 
to store the data that you 
need. You also could convert 
a Number field to a Currency 
field or vice versa.
BTW
Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called 
CIS 101, a good practice 
would be to save all Access 
files in an Access folder 
in a CIS 101 folder. For a 
discussion of folders and 
detailed examples of creating 
folders, refer to the Office 
and Windows chapter at the 
beginning of this book.

To Move a Field
If you decide you would rather have a field in one of your tables in a different 
position, you can move it. To move a field, you would use the following steps.
1.	 Open the table in Design view.
2.	 Tap or click the row selector for the field to be deleted.
3.	 Drag the field to the desired position.
4.	 Release the mouse button or lift your finger to place the field in the new position.
To Add a New Field
You can add fields to a table in a database. The following steps add the Customer Type field to the 
Customer table immediately after the Postal Code field. Why? Bavant Publishing has decided that it needs to 
categorize its customers by adding an additional field, Customer Type. The possible values for Customer Type are HS 
(which indicates the customer is a high school or an intermediate school district), COM (which indicates the customer is 
a community college), or UNI (which indicates the customer is a university or four-year college). 
•	If necessary, open the Navigation 
Pane, open the Customer table in 
Design view, and then close the 
Navigation Pane.
•	Tap or click the row selector for 
the Amount Paid field, and then 
press the insert key to insert a 
blank row above the selected field 
(Figure 3–24).
•	Tap or click the Field Name 
column for the new field to 
produce an insertion point.
•	Type   Customer Type   as 
the field name and then press the

select from the list of values, in 
which case they can only select 
items in the list. They can also type 
their entry, in which case they are not necessarily limited to items in the list. If you check the ‘Limit To List’ check box, 
users would be limited to items in the list, even if they type their entry. You will accomplish this same restriction later

To Add a Multivalued Field
Normally, fields contain only a single value. In Access, it is possible to have 
multivalued fields, that is, fields that can contain more than one value. Bavant 
Publishing wants to use such a field to store the abbreviations of the various resources its 
customers need (see Table 3–1 for the resource abbreviations and descriptions). Unlike 
the Customer Type, where each customer only had one type, customers can require 
multiple resources. One customer might need Audio, PrMan, PrWrk, and Txt (Audio 
CD, Printed Laboratory Manual, Printed Workbook, and Printed Textbook). Another 
customer might only need CustD and Ebook (Custom Digital and Electronic Textbook).
Creating a multivalued field uses the same process as creating a lookup field, 
with the exception that you check the ‘Allow Multiple Values’ check box. The following 
steps create a multivalued field.

To Modify Single or Multivalued Lookup Fields
At some point you might want to change the list of choices in a lookup field. 
If you need to modify a single or multivalued lookup field, you would use the 
following steps.
1.	 Open the table in Design view and select the field to be modified.
2.	 Tap or click the Lookup tab in the Field Properties pane.
3.	 Change the list in the Row Source property to the desired list of values.

BTW
Modifying Table 
Properties
You can change the 
properties of a table by 
opening the table in Design 
view and then clicking the 
Property Sheet button. To 
display the records in a 
table in an order other than 
primary key (the default 
sort order), use the Order 
By property. For example, to 
display the Customer table 
automatically in Customer 
Name order, change the 
Order By property setting to 
Customer. Customer Name 
in the property box, close 
the property sheet, and save 
the change to the table 
design. When you open the 
Customer table in Datasheet 
view, the records will be 
sorted in Customer Name 
order.
BTW
Multivalued Fields
Do not use multivalued fields 
if you plan to move your 
data to another relational 
database management 
system, such as SQL Server 
at a later date. SQL Server 
and other relational DMBSs 
do not support multivalued 
fields.

To Add a Calculated Field
A field that can be computed from other fields is called a calculated field or a computed field. In 
Chapter 2, you created a calculated field in a query that provided total amount data. In Access 2013, it is also 
possible to include a calculated field in a table. Users will not be able to update this field. Why? Access will 
automatically perform the necessary calculation and display the appropriate value whenever you display or use this field in 
any way. The following steps add to the Customer table a field that calculates the sum of the Amount Paid and 
Current Due fields.
•	Tap or click the row selector for 
the Returns field, and then press 
the insert key to insert a blank 
row above the selected field.
•	Tap or click the Field Name 
column for the new field.

Mass Changes
In some cases, rather than making individual changes to records, you will want to 
make mass changes. That is, you will want to add, change, or delete many records in a 
single operation. You can do this with action queries. Unlike the select queries that you 
created in Chapter 2, which simply presented data in specific ways, an action query 
adds, deletes, or changes data in a table. An update query allows you to make the same 
change to all records satisfying some criterion. If you omit the criterion, you will make 
the same changes to all records in the table. A delete query allows you to delete all 
the records satisfying some criterion. You can add the results of a query to an existing 
table by using an append query. You also can add the query results to a new table by 
using a make-table query.
To Use an Update Query
The new Customer Type field is blank on every record in the Customer table. One approach to entering 
the information for the field would be to step through the entire table, assigning each record its appropriate 
value. If most of the customers have the same type, it would be more convenient to use an update query to assign 
a single value to all customers and then update the Customer Type for those customers whose type differs. An 
update query makes the same change to all records satisfying a criterion.
In the Bavant Publishing database, for example, most customers are type UNI. Initially, you can set all the 
values to UNI. Later, you can change the type for community colleges and high schools.
The following steps use an update query to change the value in the Customer Type field to UNI for all the 
records. Because all records are to be updated, criteria are not required. Why? If there is a criterion, the update only 
takes place on those records that satisfy the criterion. Without a criterion, the update applies to all records.

6 change appearance | 7 referential integrity | 8 order records

To Use a Delete Query
In some cases, you might need to delete several records at a time. If, for example, 
all high school customers are to be serviced by another publisher, the customers with 
this customer type can be deleted from the Bavant Publishing database. Instead of 
deleting these customers individually, which could be very time-consuming in a large 
database, you can delete them in one operation by using a delete query, which is a 
query that deletes all the records satisfying the criteria entered in the query. To create a 
delete query, you would use the following steps.
1.	 Create a query for the table containing the records to be deleted.
2.	 In Design view, indicate the fields and criteria that will specify the records to delete.
3.	 Tap or click the Delete button (Query Tools Design tab | Query Type 
group).
4.	 Run the query by clicking the Run button (Query Tools Design tab |

To Use an Append Query
An append query adds a group of records from one table, called the Source table, 
to the end of another table, called the Destination table. For example, suppose that 
Bavant Publishing acquires some new customers and a database containing a table with 
those customers. To avoid entering all this information manually, you can append it 
to the Customer table in the Bavant Publishing database using the append query. To 
create an append query, you would use the following steps.
1.	 Create a query for the Source table.
2.	 In Design view, indicate the fields to include, and then enter any necessary criteria.
3.	 View the query results to be sure you have specified the correct data, and then 
return to Design view.
4.	 Tap or click the Append button (Query Tools Design tab | Query Type group).
5.	 When Access displays the Append dialog box, specify the name of the Destination 
table and its location. Run the query by clicking the Run button (Query Tools 
Design tab | Results group).
6.	 When Access indicates the number of records to be appended, tap or click the OK button.
To Use a Make-Table Query
In some cases, you might want to create a new table that contains only records 
copied from an existing table. If so, use a make-table query to add the records to a new 
table. To create a make-table query, you would use the following steps.
1.	 Create a query for the Source table.
2.	 In Design view, indicate the fields to include, and then enter any necessary criteria.
3.	 View the query results to be sure you have specified the correct data, and then 
return to Design view.
4.	 Tap or click the Make Table button (Query Tools Design tab | Query Type 
group).
5.	 When Access displays the Make Table dialog box, specify the name of the 
Destination table and its location. Run the query by clicking the Run button 
(Query Tools Design tab | Results group).
6.	 When Access indicates the number of records to be inserted, tap or click the OK button.
Break Point: If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can quit Access now. To resume at a later time, start 
Access, open the database called Bavant Publishing, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Validation Rules
You now have created, loaded, queried, and updated a database. Nothing you have 
done so far, however, restricts users to entering only valid data, that is, data that follows 
the rules established for data in the database. An example of such a rule would be that 
customer types can only be HS, COM, or UNI. To ensure the entry of valid data, you 
create validation rules, that is, rules that a user must follow when entering the data. As 
you will see, Access will prevent users from entering data that does not follow the rules. 
The steps also specify validation text, which is the message that will appear if a user 
attempts to violate the validation rule.
Validation rules can indicate a required field, a field in which the user must 
enter data; failing to enter data into a required field generates an error. Validation rules 
can restrict a user’s entry to a certain range of values; for example, the values in the 
Returns field must be between $0 and $30,000. They can specify a default value, that 
BTW
Archive Tables
You can use a make table 
query to create an archive 
table. An archive table is 
a table that contains data 
that is no longer used in 
operations but that might 
still be needed by the 
organization.
BTW
Database Design: 
Validation
In most organizations, 
decisions about what is 
valid and what is invalid 
data are made during the 
requirements gathering 
process and the database 
design process.

is, a value that Access will display on the screen in a particular field before the user 
begins adding a record. To make data entry of customer numbers more convenient, 
you also can have lowercase letters appear automatically as uppercase letters. Finally, 
validation rules can specify a collection of acceptable values.
To Change a Field Size
The Field Size property for text fields represents the maximum number of 
characters a user can enter in the field. Because the field size for the Customer Number 
field is five, for example, a user would not be able to enter a sixth character in the field. 
Occasionally, you will find that the field size that seemed appropriate when you first 
created a table is no longer appropriate. In the Customer table, there is a street name that 
needs to be longer than 20 characters. To allow this name in the table, you need to change 
the field size for the Street field to a number that is large enough to accommodate the 
new name. The following step changes the field size for the Street field from 20 to 25.
	1	
Open the Customer table in Design view and close the Navigation Pane.
	2	
Select the Street field by clicking its row selector.
	3	
Tap or click the Field Size property to select it, delete the current entry (20), and then 
type   25   as the new field size.
To Specify a Required Field
To specify that a field is to be required, change the value for the Required property from No to Yes. The 
following step specifies that the Customer Name field is to be a required field. Why? Users will not be able to leave 
the Customer Name field blank when entering or editing records.
•	Select the Customer Name field by clicking its row selector.
•	Tap or click the Required property box in the Field Properties pane, and then tap or click the down arrow that appears.
•	Tap or click Yes in the list to make Customer Name a required field (Figure 3–36).

Using Wildcards in 
Validation Rules
You can include wildcards in 
validation rules. For example, 
if you enter the expression, 
like T?, in the Validation Rule 
for the State field, the only 
valid entries for the field will 
be TN or TX.

To Specify a Range
The following step specifies that entries in the Returns field must be between $0 and $30,000. To indicate 
this range, the criterion specifies that the returns amount must be both >= 0 (greater than or equal to 0) and 
<= 30000 (less than or equal to 30,000). Why? Combining these two criteria with the word, and, is logically equivalent 
to being between $0.00 and $30,000.00.
To Specify a Default Value
To specify a default value, enter the value in the Default Value property box. The following step specifies 
UNI as the default value for the Customer Type field. Why? More customers at Bavant have type UNI than either of 
the other types. By making it the default value, if users do not enter a customer type, the type will be UNI.
•	Select the Returns field by clicking 
its row selector, tap or click the 
Validation Rule property box to 
produce an insertion point, and 
then type   >=0 and <=30000  
as the rule.
•	Tap or click the Validation Text 
property box to produce an 
insertion point, and then type   
Must be at least $0.00 
and at most $30,000.00   
as the text (Figure 3–37).
What is the effect of this change?
Users now will be prohibited from 
entering a returns amount that is 
either less than $0.00 or greater than $30,000.00 when they  
add records or change the value in the Returns field.

To Specify a Collection of Legal Values
The only legal values, or allowable values, for the Customer Type field are HS, COM, and UNI. The 
following step creates a validation rule to specify these as the only legal values for the Customer Type field. 
Why? The validation rule prohibits users from entering any other value in the Customer Type field.
To Specify a Format
To affect the way data appears in a field, you can use a format. To use a format with a Short Text field, you 
enter a special symbol, called a format symbol, in the field’s Format property box. The Format property uses 
different settings for different data types. The following step specifies a format for the Customer Number field 
using the > symbol. Why? The > format symbol causes Access to display lowercase letters automatically as uppercase letters, 
which is appropriate for the Customer Number field. There is another symbol, the < symbol, which causes Access to 
display uppercase letters automatically as lowercase letters.

Updating a Table that Contains Validation Rules
Now that the Bavant database contains validation rules, Access restricts the user 
to entering data that is valid and is formatted correctly. If a user enters a number that is 
out of the required range, for example, or enters a value that is not one of the possible 
choices, Access displays an error message in the form of a dialog box. The user cannot 
update the database until the error is corrected.
If the customer number entered contains lowercase letters, such as wip22 
(Figure 3–42), Access will display the data automatically as WIP22 (Figure 3–43).

Making Additional Changes to the Database
Now that you have changed the structure and created validation rules, there are 
additional changes to be made to the database. You will use both the lookup and 
multivalued lookup fields to change the contents of the fields. You also will update 
both the form and the report to reflect the changes in the table.
When entering invalid data into a field with a validation rule, is it possible that you could not enter the 
data correctly? What would cause this? If it happens, what should you do?
If you cannot remember the validation rule you created or if you created the rule incorrectly, you might not be able to enter 
the data. In such a case, you will be unable to leave the field or close the table ­because you have entered data into a field that 
­violates the validation rule.
If this happens, first try again to type an acceptable entry. If this does not work, repeatedly press the backspace key to erase 
the contents of the field and then try to leave the field. If you are unsuccessful using this procedure, press the esc key until the 
record is removed from the screen. The record will not be added to the database.
Should the need arise to take this drastic action, you probably have a faulty validation rule. Use the techniques of the 
­previous sections to correct the existing validation rules for the field.

To Change the Contents of a Field
Now that the size for the Street field has been increased, you can change the name for customer TSC02 
from 3400 Metro Pkwy. to 3400 Metropolitan Pkwy. and then resize the column, just as you resized columns in 
Chapter 1 on page AC 28. Why? Changing the field size for the field does not automatically increase the width of the 
corresponding column in the datasheet. The following steps change the Street name and resize the column in the 
datasheet to accommodate the new name.
•	Open the Customer table in 
Datasheet view and ensure the 
Navigation Pane is closed.
•	Tap or click in the Street field for 
customer TSC02 immediately to 
the right of the letter, o, of Metro 
to produce an insertion point.
•	Change the street from 3400 
Metro Pkwy. to 3400 Metropolitan 
Pkwy. by typing   politan   and 
pressing the tab key.
I cannot add the extra characters. 
Whatever I type replaces what 
is currently in the cell. What 
happened and what should I do?
You are in Overtype mode, not 
Insert mode. Press the insert key and correct the entry.
•	Resize the Street column to best fit the new data by double-tapping or double-clicking the right boundary of the 
field selector for the Street field, that is, the column heading (Figure 3–47).
•	Save the changes to the layout by clicking the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
•	Close the Customer table.

To Use a Lookup Field
Earlier, you changed all the entries in the Customer Type field to UNI. You have created a rule that will 
ensure that only legitimate values (HS, COM, or UNI) can be entered in the field. You also made Customer 
Type a lookup field. Why? You can make changes to a lookup field for individual records by simply clicking the field to 
be changed, clicking the arrow that appears in the field, and then selecting the desired value from the list. The following 
steps change the incorrect Customer Type values to the correct values.
•	Open the Customer 
table in Datasheet 
view and ensure the 
Navigation Pane is 
closed.
•	Tap or click in the 
Customer Type field on 
the second record to 
display an arrow.
•	Tap or click the 
arrow to display the drop-down list of available choices for the Customer Type field (Figure 3–48).
I got the drop-down list as soon as I clicked. I did not need to tap or click the arrow. What happened?
If you tap or click in the position where the arrow would appear, you will get the drop-down list. If you tap or click 
anywhere else, you would need to tap or click the arrow.
Could I type the value instead of selecting it from the list?
Yes. Once you have either deleted the previous value or selected the entire previous value, you can begin typing. 
You do not have to type the full entry. When you begin with the letter, C, for example, Access will automatically 
add the OM.

To Use a Multivalued Lookup Field
Using a multivalued lookup field is similar to using a regular lookup field. The difference is that when 
you drop down the list, the entries all will be preceded by check boxes. Why? Having the check boxes allows you to 
make multiple selections. You check all the entries that you want. The appropriate entries are shown in Figure 3–50. As 
indicated in the figure, the resources needed for customer ASU37 are CDVD, Ebook, OlMan, OlWrk, SDVD, 
and Txt.
The following steps make the appropriate entries for the Resources Needed field.

To Update a Form to Reflect the Changes in the Table
In the first chapter, on page AC 46, you clicked the Form button (CREATE  
tab | Forms group) to create a simple form that contained all the fields in the 
Customer table. Now that you have added fields, the form you created, Customer 
Form, no longer contains all the fields in the table. The steps on the next page delete 
the Customer Form and then create it a second time.
•	Tap or click the CDVD, Ebook, 
OlMan, OlWrk, SDVD, and 
Txt check boxes to select the 
resources for the first customer 
(Figure 3–52).

•	Tap or click the OK button to 
complete the selection.
•	Using the same technique, enter 
the resources given in Figure 3–50 
for the remaining customers.
•	Double-tap or double-click the 
right boundary of the field 
selector for the Resources Needed 
field to resize the field so that it

To Update a Report to Reflect the  
Changes in the Table
You also may want to include the new fields in the Customer Financial Report you created earlier. Just 
as you did with the form, you could delete the current version of the report and then create it all over again. It 
would be better, however, to modify the report in Layout view. Why? There are several steps involved in creating the 
Customer Financial report, so it is more complicated than the process of re-creating the form. In Layout view, you easily 
can add new fields. The following steps modify the Customer Financial Report by adding the Customer Type 
and Total Amount fields. To accommodate the extra fields, the steps also change the orientation of the report 
from Portrait to Landscape.

To Include Totals in a Datasheet
The following steps first include an extra row, called the Total row, in the datasheet for the Book Rep 
table. Why? It is possible to include totals and other statistics at the bottom of a datasheet in the Total row. The steps then 
display the total of the salary for all the book reps.
•	Open the Book Rep table in 
Datasheet view and close the 
Navigation Pane.
•	Tap or click the Totals button 
(HOME tab | Records group) 
to include the Total row in the 
datasheet.
•	Tap or click the Total row in the 
Salary column to display an arrow.
•	Tap or click the arrow to display 
a menu of available calculations 
(Figure 3–58).

To Close the Datasheet without Saving the Format Changes
The following steps close the datasheet without saving the changes to the 
format. Because the changes are not saved, the next time you open the Book Rep table 
in Datasheet view, it will appear in the original format. If you had saved the changes, 
the changes would be reflected in its appearance.
	1	
Close the Book Rep table.
	2	
Tap or click the No button in the Microsoft Access dialog box when asked if you want 
to save your changes.
What kind of decisions should I make in determining whether to change the format of a datasheet?
•	Would totals or other calculations be useful in the datasheet? If so, include the Total row and select the appropriate 
computations.
•	Would another gridline style make the datasheet more useful? If so, change to the desired gridlines.
•	Would alternating colors in the rows make them easier to read? If so, change the alternate fill color.
•	Would a different font and/or font color make the text stand out better? If so, change the font color and/or the font.
•	Is the font size appropriate? Can you see enough data at one time on the screen and yet have the data be readable? If not, 
change the font size to an appropriate value.
•	Is the column spacing appropriate? Are some columns wider than they need to be? Do some columns not display all the 
data? Change the column sizes as necessary.
As a general guideline, once you have decided on a particular look for a datasheet, all datasheets in the database should have 
the same look, unless there is a compelling reason for a datasheet to differ.

Multivalued Fields in Queries
You can use multivalued fields in queries in the same way you use other fields in 
queries. You can choose to display the multiple values either on a single row or on 
multiple rows in the query results.

6 change appearance | 7 referential integrity | 8 order records
To Include Multiple Values on  
One Row of a Query
To include a multivalued field in the results of a query, place the field in the query design grid just like 
any other field. Why? When you treat the multivalued field like any other field, the results will list all of the values for 
the multivalued field on a single row. The following steps create a query to display the customer number, customer 
name, customer type, and resources needed for all customers.
•	Create a query for the Customer 
table and close the Navigation 
Pane.
•	Include the Customer Number, 
Customer Name, Customer Type, 
and Resources Needed fields 
(Figure 3–66).

Criteria row.

Figure 3–67
To Include Multiple Values on  
Multiple Rows of a Query
You may want to see the multiple resources needed for a customer on separate rows rather than a single 
row. Why? Each row in the results will focus on one specific resource that is needed. To do so, you need to use the Value 
property of the Resources Needed field, by following the name of the field with a period and then the word, 
Value. The following steps use the Value property to display each resource on a separate row. 
•	Return to Design view and ensure 
that the Customer Number, 
Customer Name, Customer Type, 
and Resources Needed fields are 
included in the design grid.
•	Tap or click the Resources Needed 
field to produce an insertion 
point, press the right arrow key 
as necessary to move the insertion 
point to the end of the field 
name, and then type a period.
•	If the word, Value, did not 
automatically appear after the 
period, type the word   value   
after the period following the 
word, Needed, to use the Value property (Figure 3–68).
I do not see the word, Resources. Did I do something wrong?
No. There is not enough room to display the entire name. If you wanted to see it, you could point to the right 
boundary of the column selector and then either drag or double-tap or double-click.
I see Resources Needed.Value as a field in the field list. Could I have deleted the Resources Needed field and added 
the Resources Needed.Value field?
Yes. Either approach is fine.

Break Point:  If you wish to take a break, this is a good place to do so. You can quit Access now. To resume at a later time, start 
Access, open the database called Bavant Publishing, and continue following the steps from this location forward.
Referential Integrity
When you have two related tables in a database, it is essential that the data in the 
common fields match. There should not be a customer in the Customer table whose 
book rep number is 42, for example, unless there is a record in the Book Rep table 
whose number is 42. This restriction is enforced through referential integrity, which 
is the property that ensures that the value in a foreign key must match that of another 
table’s primary key.
A foreign key is a field in one table whose values are required to match the 
primary key of another table. In the Customer table, the Book Rep Number field is a 
foreign key that must match the primary key of the Book Rep table; that is, the book 
rep number for any customer must be a book rep currently in the Book Rep table. 
A customer whose book rep number is 92, for example, should not be stored because 
no such book rep exists.
In Access, to specify referential integrity, you must explicitly define a relationship 
between the tables by using the Relationships button. As part of the process of defining 
a relationship, you indicate that Access is to enforce referential integrity. Access then 
prohibits any updates to the database that would violate the referential integrity.
The type of relationship between two tables specified by the Relationships 
command is referred to as a one-to-many relationship. This means that one record 
in the first table is related to, or matches, many records in the second table, but each 
record in the second table is related to only one record in the first. In the Bavant 
Publishing database, for example, a one-to-many relationship exists between the Book 
Rep table and the Customer table. One book rep is associated with many customers, 
but each customer is associated with only a single book rep. In general, the table 
containing the foreign key will be the many part of the relationship.
each row contains 
only one resource
the six resources needed 
by Customer ASU37 
now appear on six rows
BTW
Relationships
You also can use the 
Relationships window 
to specify a one-to-one 
relationship. In a one-to-one 
relationship, the matching 
fields are both primary 
keys. If Bavant Publishing 
maintained a company car 
for each book rep, the data 
concerning the cars might be 
kept in a Car table, in which 
the primary key is Book Rep 
Number — the same primary 
key as the Book Rep table. 
Thus, there would be a one-
to-one relationship between 
book reps and cars.

AC 182   Access Chapter 3   Maintaining a Database
When specifying referential integrity, what special issues do you need to address?
You need to decide how to handle deletions. In the relationship between customers and book reps, for example, deletion of a 
book rep for whom customers exist, such as book rep number 42, would violate referential integrity. Customers for book rep 
42 no longer would relate to any book rep in the database. You can handle this in two ways. For each relationship, you need to 
decide which of the approaches is appropriate.
•	The normal way to avoid this problem is to prohibit such a deletion.
•	The other option is to cascade the delete. This means that Access would allow the deletion but then delete all related re-
cords. For example, it would allow the deletion of the book rep from the Book Rep table but then automatically delete any 
customers related to the deleted book rep. In this example, cascading the delete would obviously not be appropriate.
You also need to decide how to handle the update of the primary key. In the relationship between book reps and customers, 
for example, changing the book rep number for book rep 42 to 43 in the Book Rep table would cause a problem because some 
customers in the Customer table have book rep number 42. These customers no longer would relate to any book rep. You can 
handle this in two ways. For each relationship, you need to decide which of the approaches is appropriate.
•	The normal way to avoid this problem is to prohibit this type of update.
•	The other option is to cascade the update. This means to allow the change, but make the corresponding change in the 
foreign key on all related records. In the relationship between customers and book reps, for example, Access would allow the 
update but then automatically make the corresponding change for any customer whose book rep number was 42. It now 
will be 43.
CONSIDER THIS
To Specify Referential Integrity
The following steps use the Relationships button on the DATABASE TOOLS tab to specify referential 
integrity by explicitly indicating a relationship between the Book Rep and Customer tables. The steps also 
ensure that updates will cascade, but that deletes will not. Why? By specifying that updates will cascade, it will be 
possible to change the Book Rep Number for a book rep, and the same change will automatically be made for all customers of 
that book rep. By not specifying that deletes will cascade, it will not be possible to delete a book rep who has related customers.

Effect of Referential Integrity
Referential integrity now exists between the Book Rep and Customer tables. 
Access now will reject any number in the Book Rep Number field in the Customer 
table that does not match a book rep number in the Book Rep table. Attempting to 
change the book rep number for a customer to one that does not match any book 
rep in the Book Rep table would result in the error message shown in Figure 3–75. 
Similarly, attempting to add a customer whose book rep number does not match 
would produce the same error message.

Access also will reject the deletion of a book rep for whom related customers 
exist. Attempting to delete book rep 42 from the Book Rep table, for example, would 
result in the message shown in Figure 3–76.
Access would, however, allow the change of a book rep number in the Book Rep 
table. Then it automatically makes the corresponding change to the book rep number 
for all the book rep’s customers. For example, if you changed the book rep number 
of book rep 42 to 24, the same 24 would appear in the book rep number field for 
customers whose book rep number had been 42.

To Use a Subdatasheet
It is possible to view the customers of a given book rep when you are viewing the datasheet for the Book 
Rep table. Why is data from one table visible when viewing the other table? The Book Rep table is now explicitly 
related to the Customer table. One consequence of the tables being explicitly related is that the customers for a 
book rep can appear below the book rep in a subdatasheet. The availability of such a subdatasheet is indicated 
by a plus sign that appears in front of the rows in the Book Rep table. The steps on the next page display the 
subdatasheet for book rep 53.

Handling Data Inconsistency
In many organizations, databases evolve and change over time. One 
department may create a database for its own internal use. Employees in another 
department may decide they need their own database containing much of the same 
information. For example, the Purchasing department of an organization may create 
a database of products that it buys and the Receiving department may create a 
database of products that it receives. Each department is keeping track of the same 
products. When the organization eventually merges the databases, they may find 
inconsistencies and duplication. The Find Duplicates Query Wizard and the Find 
Unmatched Query Wizard can assist in clearing the resulting database of duplication 
and errors.

To Find Duplicate Records
One reason to include a primary key for a table is to eliminate duplicate records. 
A possibility still exists, however, that duplicate records can get into your database. 
You would use the following steps to find duplicate records using the Find Duplicates 
Query Wizard.
1.	 Tap or click Create on the ribbon, and then tap or click the Query Wizard 
button (Create tab | Queries group).
2.	 When Access displays the New Query dialog box, tap or click the Find Duplicates 
Query Wizard and then tap or click the OK button.
3.	 Identify the table and field or fields that might contain duplicate information.
4.	 Indicate any other fields you want displayed.
5.	 Finish the wizard to see any duplicate records.
To Find Unmatched Records
Occasionally, you might need to find records in one table that have no matching 
records in another table. For example, you may want to determine which book reps 
currently have no customers. You would use the following steps to find unmatched 
records using the Find Unmatched Query Wizard.
1.	 Tap or click CREATE on the ribbon, and then tap or click the Query Wizard 
button (CREATE tab | Queries group).
2.	 When Access displays the New Query dialog box, tap or click the Find Unmatched 
Query Wizard and then tap or click the OK button.
3.	 Identify the table that might contain unmatched records, and then identify the 
related table.
4.	 Indicate the fields you want displayed.
5.	 Finish the wizard to see any unmatched records.
Ordering Records
Normally, Access sequences the records in the Customer table by customer number 
whenever listing them because the Customer Number field is the primary key. You can 
change this order, if desired.
To Use the Ascending Button  
to Order Records
To change the order in which records appear, use the Ascending or Descending buttons. Either button 
reorders the records based on the field in which the insertion point is located.
The steps on the next page order the records by city using the Ascending button. Why? Using the Ascending 
button is the quickest and easiest way to order records.

Just as you are able to sort the answer to a query on multiple fields, you also can 
sort the data that appears in a datasheet on multiple fields. To do so, the major and 
minor keys must be next to each other in the datasheet with the major key on the left. 
(If this is not the case, you can drag the columns into the correct position. Instead of 
dragging, however, usually it will be easier to use a query that has the data sorted in the 
desired order.)

To Sign Out of a Microsoft Account
If you are signed in to a Microsoft account and are using a public computer 
or otherwise wish to sign out of your Microsoft account, you should sign out of 
the account from the Account gallery in the Backstage view before exiting Access. 
Signing out of the account is the safest way to make sure that nobody else can access 
SkyDrive files or settings stored in your Microsoft account. The following steps sign 
out of a Microsoft account from Access. For a detailed example of the procedure 
summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of 
this book.

Tap or click the Sign out link, which displays the Remove Account dialog box. If a Can’t 
remove Windows accounts dialog box appears instead of the Remove Account dialog 
box, click the OK button and skip the remaining steps.
Why does a Can’t remove Windows accounts dialog box appear? 
If you signed in to Windows using your Microsoft account, then you also must sign out 
from Windows, rather than signing out from within Access. When you are finished using 
Windows, be sure to sign out at that time.

What decisions will you need to make when maintaining your own databases?
Use these guidelines as you complete the assignments in this chapter and maintain your own ­databases outside of this class.
1.	Determine when it is necessary to add, change, or delete records in a database.
2.	Determine whether you should filter records. 
a)	If your criterion for filtering is that the value in a particular field matches or does not match a certain specific value, 
use Filter By Selection.
b)	If your criterion only involves a single field but is more complex, use a common filter.
c)	If your criterion involves more than one field, use Filter By Form.
d)	If your criterion involves more than a single And or Or, or if it involves sorting, use Advanced Filter/Sort.
3.	Determine whether additional fields are necessary or whether existing fields should be deleted.
4.	Determine whether validation rules, default values, and formats are necessary.
a)	Can you improve the accuracy of the data entry process by enforcing data validation? 
b)	What values are allowed for a particular field? 
c)	Are there some fields in which one particular value is used more than another? 
d)	Are there some fields for which special formats would be appropriate?
5.	Determine whether changes to the format of a datasheet are desirable.
a)	Would totals or other calculations be useful in the datasheet? 
b)	Would different gridlines make the datasheet more useful? 
c)	Would alternating colors in the rows make them easier to read? 
d)	Would a different font and/or font color make the text stand out better? 
e)	Is the font size appropriate? 
f)	 Is the column spacing appropriate? 
6.	Identify related tables in order to implement relationships between the tables.
a)	Is there a one-to-many relationship between the tables? 
b)	If so, which table is the one table? 
c)	Which table is the many table?
7.	When specifying referential integrity, address deletion and update policies.
a)	Decide how to handle deletions. Should deletion be prohibited or should the delete cascade?
b)	Decide how to handle the update of the primary key. Should the update be prohibited or should the update 
cascade?
CONSIDER THIS
How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require you to

In this chapter, you will learn how to perform basic email messaging tasks. 
The following roadmap identifies general activities you will perform as you progress 
through this chapter:
  1.	 configure the account options
  2.	 compose and send an email message
  3.	 view and print an email message
  4.	 reply to an email message
  5.	 attach a file to an email message
  6.	 organize email messages in folders
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the View and Print activity.

Introduction to Outlook
Outlook 2013 helps you organize and manage your communications, contacts, 
schedules, and tasks. Email (short for electronic mail) is the transmission of messages 
and files between computers or smart devices over a network. An email client, such 
as Microsoft Outlook 2013, is an app that allows you to compose, send, receive, store, 
and delete email messages. Outlook can access mail servers in a local network, such as 
your school’s network, or a remote network, such as the Internet. Finally, you can use 
Outlook to organize messages so that you easily can find and respond to them later.
To use Outlook, you must have an email account. An email account is 
an electronic mailbox you receive from an email service provider, which is an 
organization that provides servers for routing and storing email messages. Your 
employer or school could set up an email account for you, or you can do so yourself

Microsoft account, Google Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, or iCloud Mail. Outlook does not 
create or issue email accounts; it merely provides you with access to them. When you 
have an email account, you also have an email address, which identifies your email 
account on a network so you can send and receive email messages.
Project — Composing and Sending Email Messages
The project in this chapter follows the general guidelines for using Outlook to 
compose, open, and reply to email messages, as shown in Figure 1 – 1. To communicate 
with individuals and groups, you typically send or receive some kind of message. Phone 
calls, letters, texting, and email are examples of ways to communicate a message. Email 
is a convenient way to send information to multiple people at once.
(a) Compose a message
(b) Display the Inbox
(c) Reply and attach a file to a message

Microsoft Outlook 2013 to compose, send, read, reply to, and forward email messages 
regarding an upcoming Summer Study Abroad program. As club president, Dylan’s 
responsibilities include collecting information about the Summer Study Abroad 
program, coordinating the marketing of the informational meeting, and sharing 
information with students who are interested in studying abroad. Using Outlook, 
Dylan reads email messages from instructors and students regarding the Summer 
Study Abroad program. He replies to email messages and includes a document 
containing a flyer about the informational meeting. To organize messages, he also 
creates folders and then stores the messages in the folders.
Setting Up Outlook
Many computer users have an email account from an online email service provider 
such as Outlook.com or Gmail.com and another email account at work or school. 
Instead of using a web app for your online email account and another app for your 
school account, you can use Outlook 2013 to access all of your email messages in a 
single location. When you access your email in Outlook 2013, you can take advantage 
of a full set of features that include social networking, translation services, and file 
management. You can read your downloaded messages offline and set options to 
organize your messages in a way that is logical and convenient for you. 
The first time you start Outlook on a personal computer, the Auto Account 
Setup feature guides you to provide information that Outlook needs to send and 
receive email messages (Figure 1–2). First, the setup feature prompts you to provide 
your name, which will appear in email messages that you send to other people. Next, 
the setup feature requests your email address and a password. 
What should you do if you do not have an email address?
• Use a browser such as Internet Explorer to go to the Outlook.com or Gmail.com website. Look for a Create an Account link 
or button, tap or click it, and then follow the instructions to create an account, which includes creating an email address.

Parts of an Email Address
An email address is divided into two parts. The first part contains a user name, 
which is a combination of characters, such as letters of the alphabet and numbers, that 
identifies a specific user. The last part is a domain name, which is the name associated 
with a specific Internet address and is assigned by your email service provider. A user 
name must be different from other user names in the same domain. For example, 
the outlook.com domain can have only one user named dylan.cruz. An email address 
contains an @ (pronounced at) symbol to separate the user name from the domain 
name. Figure 1–3 shows an email address for Dylan Cruz, which would be read as 
dylan dot cruz at outlook dot com.

to Windows and 
instruction about 
how to perform 
­basic ­Windows tasks, 
read the Office and 
Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this 
book, where you can 
learn how to resize 
windows, change 
screen resolution, 
create folders, move 
and rename files, use 
Windows Help, and 
much more.
One of the few 
­differences between 
Windows 7 and 
­Windows 8 occur 
in the steps to run 
­Outlook. If you are 
­using Windows 7, 
click the Start button, 
type   Outlook   in 
the `Search programs 
and files’ text box,

window. For detailed 
steps to run Outlook 
in ­Windows 7, refer 
to the Office and 
­Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this 
book. For a summary 
of the steps, refer to 
the Quick Reference 
­located at the back of 
this book.
To Run Outlook
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your

resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or the search box to run Outlook based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Outlook on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter.

Scroll the Start screen for an Outlook 2013 tile. If your Start screen contains an 
Outlook 2013 tile, tap or click it to run Outlook and then proceed to Step 5; if the 
Start screen does not contain the Outlook 2013 tile, proceed to the next step to search 
for the Outlook app.

the screen to display the Charms bar, and then tap or click the Search charm on the 
Charms bar to display the Search menu.

To Change the Navigation Bar Options
The first time you start Outlook, the lower-left corner of the screen provides compact navigation by 
default. To change the Navigation bar from displaying small icons representing Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and 
Task to a text view, you can disable the compact navigation setting on the Navigation bar. The following steps 
change the Navigation bar options. Why? Instead of small icons, you can display the Mail, Calendar, Contacts, and Task 
text labels.

Touch Screen 
Differences
The Office and Windows 
interfaces may vary if you are 
using a touch screen. For this 
reason, you might notice that 
the function or appearance 
of your touch screen differs 
slightly from this chapter’s 
presentation.

The Ribbon and Screen Resolution
Outlook may change how the groups and buttons within the groups appear on the ribbon, depending on the computer’s screen resolution.  
Thus, your ribbon may look different from the ones in this book if you are using a screen resolution other than 1366 x 768.

To Open an Outlook Data File
Microsoft Outlook uses a special file format called a personal storage table (.pst file) to save your 
email files, calendar entries, and contacts. The email messages with which you work in this chapter are stored 
in a personal storage table file named Dylan.pst, which is an Outlook mailbox available on the Data Files for 
Students. To complete this chapter project, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit www.
cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for information about 
accessing the required files. In this example, the Dylan mailbox is located in the Chapter 01 folder in the 
Outlook folder in the Data Files for Students folder. The following steps open the Dylan.pst file in Outlook, 
display the Inbox for the Dylan file, and then make your Dylan mailbox match the figures in this chapter. Why? 
Importing a .pst file allows you to move your email and other Outlook information to another computer.

OUT 12   Outlook Chapter 1   Managing Email Messages with Outlook
Composing and Sending Email messages
Composing an email message is the most frequent personal and business task you 
perform in Microsoft Outlook. Composing an email message consists of four basic 
steps: open a new message window, enter message header information, enter the 
message text, and add a signature. When composing an email message, it is best to 
keep your message text short and to the point.
An email message is organized into two areas: the message header and the 
message area. The information in the message header routes the message to its 
recipients and identifies the subject of the message. The message header identifies 
the primary recipient(s) in the To box. If you have multiple recipients in the To box, 
you can separate each email address with a semicolon. Recipients in the Cc (courtesy 
copy or carbon copy) and Bcc (blind courtesy copy) boxes, if displayed, also receive the 
message; however, the names of the recipients in the Bcc box are not visible to other 
recipients. The subject line states the purpose of the message.
The message area, where you type an email message, consists of a greeting line 
or salutation, the message text, an optional closing, and one or more signature lines as 
shown in Table 1–1.
Table 1–1 Message Area Parts
Part
Description
Greeting line or 
salutation
Sets the tone of the message and can be formal or informal, depending on the 
nature of the message. You can use a colon (:) or comma (,) at the end of the 
greeting line.
Message text
Informs the recipient or requests information.
Closing
Informs the recipient or requests information. A closing signals an end to the 
message using courtesy words such as Thank you or Regards. Because the closing is 
most appropriate for formal email messages, it is optional.
Signature line(s)
Identifies the sender and may contain additional information, such as a job title, 
business name, and phone number(s). In a signature, the name usually is provided 
on one line followed by other information listed on separate lines.
To Compose an Email Message
An email message from Dylan Cruz, the International Club student president, requests information about 
the Summer Study Abroad program from an instructor named Jacob Thompson. The following steps compose 
a new email message. Why? Composing email messages is a quick and efficient method to connect with personal and 
professional contacts. 
•	Tap or click the New  
Email button (home tab | 
New group) to open the 
Untitled – Message (HTML) 
window (Figure 1 – 14).
What does HTML mean in the 
title bar?
HTML is the format for the new 
email message. Outlook messages 
can use two other formats: Rich 
Text Format (RTF) and Plain Text. 
All of these formats are discussed 
later in this chapter.

Why? After you complete a message, send it to the recipient, who typically receives the message in seconds. The 
following step sends the completed email message to the recipient.
•	Tap or click the Send button in the message header to send the email message and close the message window.
What happened to the email message?
Outlook automatically sends email messages to their recipient(s) when you tap or click Send in a new message 
window if you have your own email account set up.
Why did I get an error message that stated that ‘No valid email accounts are configured. Add an account to send

How Email Messages Travel from Sender to Receiver
When you send someone an email message, it travels across the Internet to 
the computer at your email service provider that handles outgoing email messages. 
This computer, called the outgoing email server, examines the email address on 
your message, selects the best route for sending the message across the Internet, and 
then sends the email message. Many outgoing email servers use SMTP (Simple 
Mail Transfer Protocol), which is a communications protocol, or set of rules for 
communicating with other computers. An email program such as Outlook contacts 
the outgoing email server and then transfers the email message(s) in its Outbox to 
that server. If the email program cannot contact the outgoing email server, the email 
message(s) remains in the Outbox until the program can connect to the server.
As an email message travels across the Internet, routers direct the email message 
to a computer at your recipient’s email service provider that handles incoming email 
messages. A router is a device that forwards data on a network. The computer 
handling incoming email messages, called the incoming email server, stores the email 
message(s) until your recipient uses an email program such as Outlook to retrieve the 
email message(s). Some email servers use POP3, the latest version of Post Office 
Protocol (POP), a communications protocol for incoming email. Figure 1 – 21 shows 
how an email message may travel from a sender to a receiver.
How can you create your own theme for your messages?
• Format a message with a customized font, colors, and background.
• Tap or click the Themes button (options tab | Themes group) to display the Themes gallery.
• Tap or click Save Current Theme to display the Save Current Theme dialog box.
• Type a name in the File name text box to name your new theme.
• Tap or click the Save button to save your new theme.

Working with Incoming Messages
When you receive email messages, Outlook directs them to your Inbox and 
displays them in the message pane, which lists the contents of the selected folder 
(Figure 1 – 23). The list of messages displayed in the message pane is called the 
message list. An unread (unopened) email message in the message list includes a blue 
vertical bar in front of the message and displays the subject text and time of arrival in 
a blue bold font. An open envelope icon indicates a previously read (opened) message. 
The blue number next to the Inbox folder shows how many unread messages are 
stored in the Inbox. The email messages on your computer may be different.
You can read incoming messages in three ways: in an open window, in the 
Reading Pane, or as a hard copy. A hard copy (printout) is information presented on a 
physical medium such as paper.

To View an Email Message in the  
Reading Pane
Why? You can preview messages in your Inbox without opening them by using the Reading Pane. The Reading 
Pane appears on the right side of the Outlook window by default and displays the contents of a message without 
requiring you to open the message. An advantage of viewing messages in the Reading Pane is that if a message 
includes content that could be harmful to your computer, such as a malicious script or an attachment containing 
a virus, the Reading Pane does not activate the harmful content. An attachment is a file such as a document or 
picture you send along with an email message. The instructor Jacob Thompson has sent a response to Dylan 
concerning the Summer Study Abroad program. The following step displays an email message from a sender. 
•	Tap or click the message header from Jacob Thompson in the Inbox message list to select the email message and 
display its contents in the Reading Pane (Figure 1 – 24). 
What happens to the message header when I select another message?
Outlook automatically marks messages as read after you preview the message in the Reading Pane and select 
another message to view. A read message is displayed in the message list without a vertical blue line or bold text.

OUT 20   Outlook Chapter 1   Managing Email Messages with Outlook
Opening Attachments
Email messages that include attachments are identified by a paper clip icon in 
the message list. Users typically attach a file to an email message to provide additional 
information to the recipient. An attachment in a message can appear in a line below the 
subject line or in the message body. To help protect your computer, Outlook does not allow 
you to receive files as attachments if they are a certain file type, such as .exe (executable) 
or .js (JavaScript), because of their potential for introducing a virus into your computer. 
When Outlook blocks a suspicious attachment in a message, the blocked file appears in the 
InfoBar at the top of your message. An InfoBar is a banner displayed at the top of an email 
message that indicates whether an email message has been replied to or forwarded.
The Attachment Preview feature in Outlook allows you to preview an 
attachment you receive in an email message from either the Reading Pane in an 
unopened message or the message area of an opened message. Outlook has built-in 
previewers for several file types, such as other Office programs, pictures, text, and 
webpages. Outlook includes attachment previewers that work with other Microsoft 
Office programs so that users can preview an attachment without opening it. These 
attachment previewers are turned on by default. To preview an attached file created in 
an Office application, you must have Office installed on your computer. For example, to 
preview an Excel attachment in Outlook, you must have Excel installed. If an attachment 
cannot be previewed, you can double-tap or double-click the attachment to open the file.
To Preview and Save an Attachment
Why? When you receive a message with an attachment, you can preview the attached file without opening it if you are 
not sure of the contents. The following steps preview and save an attachment without opening the file. You should 
save the attachment on your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is most appropriate to your situation. These 
steps assume you already have created folders for storing your files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) 
that contains an Outlook folder (for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the attachment in the Outlook 
folder in the CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of the procedure for saving a 
file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.

Organizing Files 
and Folders
You should organize and 
store files in folders so that 
you easily can find the files 
later. For example, if you 
are taking an introductory 
computer class called CIS 
101, a good practice would 
be to save all Outlook files 
in an Outlook folder in a CIS 
101 folder. For a discussion of 
folders and detailed examples 
of creating folders, refer to 
the Office and Windows 
chapter at the beginning of

Using the Outlook Social Connector
Outlook provides a means of communicating 
with the personal and business contacts in your social 
networks. The Social Connector is a feature designed to 
link Outlook to your social networks such as Facebook, 
LinkedIn, My Site (SharePoint), and other social 
networks, as shown in Figure 1–31. The Outlook Social 
Connector displays the communication you have had 
with someone from your social network, along with their 
photo. The People Pane accesses information that the 
Outlook Social Connector displays from social networks. 
If you enable these connections, the People Pane can 
display information such as Facebook status updates, 
tagged photos, and profile photos. For example, in the 
chapter project, the People Pane at the bottom of the 
Reading Pane displays the photos of the email sender 
and recipient. If you connect to your social networks, the 
People Pane, depending on a sender’s privacy settings on 
their social network accounts, can display your friend’s 
photos and contact information in one location.

Responding to Messages
When you receive a message, you can send a reply to the sender. You also have the 
option to forward the message to additional people.
How should a formal business response differ from a close friend’s response?
• An email response you send to an instructor, coworker, or client should be more formal than the one you send to a close 
friend. For example, conversational language to a friend, such as “Can’t wait to see you!” is not appropriate in professional 
email messages. 
• A formal email message should be business-like and get to the point quickly. An informal email is more conversational and 
friendly.
• All standard grammar rules apply, such as punctuation, capitalization, and spelling, no matter the audience.

Message Formats
As shown in Figure 1 – 42, Outlook’s default (preset) message format is HTML 
(Hypertext Markup Language), which is a format that allows you to view pictures 
and text formatted with color and various fonts and font sizes. Formatting refers to 
changing the appearance of text in a document such as the font (typeface), font size, 
color, and alignment of the text in a document.
Before you send an email message, reply to an email message, or forward an email 
message, consider which message format you want to use. A message format determines 
whether an email message can include pictures or formatted text, such as bold, italic, and 
colored fonts. Select a message format that is appropriate for your message and your 
recipient. Outlook offers three message formats: HTML, Plain Text, and Rich Text, 
as summarized in Table 1 – 3. If you select the HTML format, for example, the email 
program your recipient uses must be able to display formatted messages or pictures. If 
your recipient does not have high speed connectivity, a Plain Text format is displayed 
quickly, especially on a device such as a smartphone.  Reading email in plain text offers 
important security benefits, reducing the possibility of a virus within the email.
Table 1–3 Message Formats
Message Format
Description
HTML
HTML is the default format for new messages in Outlook. HTML lets you include pictures and basic formatting, such 
as text formatting, numbering, bullets, and alignment. HTML is the recommended format for Internet mail because 
the more popular email programs use it.
Plain Text
Plain Text format is recognized by all email programs and is the most likely format to be allowed through a company’s 
virus-filtering program. Plain Text does not support basic formatting, such as bold, italic, colored fonts, or other text 
formatting. It also does not support pictures displayed directly in the message.
Rich Text
Rich Text Format (RTF) is a Microsoft format that only the latest versions of Microsoft Exchange (a Microsoft message 
system that includes an email program and a mail server) and Outlook recognize. RTF supports more formats than 
HTML or Plain Text; it also supports hyperlinks. A hyperlink can be text, a picture or other object that is displayed in an 
email message.
To Change the Message Format
Why? You want to make sure that your reply message is not blocked by an antivirus program, so you will change the 
message format to Plain Text. The following steps change the message format to Plain Text.
•	Tap or click FORMAT 
TEXT on the ribbon 
in the message 
window to display

Using Plain Text Formatting to Guard Against Email Viruses
HTML-formatted messages can contain viruses. To minimize the risk of receiving a virus infected email message, change the format of messages 
you read. You can configure Outlook to format all opened messages in Plain Text. Tap or click FILE on the ribbon to open the Backstage view. Tap 
or click the Options tab. Tap or click the Trust Center option in the Outlook Options dialog box, and then tap or click the Trust Center Settings 
button to display the Trust Center dialog box. Tap or click E-mail Security (Trust Center dialog box), and in the Read as Plain Text section, tap or

To Check the Spelling of a Correctly Typed Word
Dylan adds one more sentence to his email document, recalling that Mia is interested in studying in a 
city named Vught in the Netherlands. In the email message, the city of Vught has a red wavy line below it even 
though it is spelled correctly, indicating the word is not in Outlook’s main dictionary. The following steps ignore 
the error and remove the red wavy line. Why? The main dictionary contains most common words, but does not include 
most proper names, technical terms, or acronyms that you use. 
•	Tap or click the 
Plain Text button 
(FORMAT TEXT tab |

message format, 
which removes all

Checking Spelling and Grammar
Outlook checks your message for possible spelling and grammar errors as you 
type and flags any potential errors in the message text with a red, green, or blue wavy 
underline. A red wavy underline means the flagged text is not in Outlook’s main 
dictionary because it is a proper name or misspelled. A green wavy underline indicates 
the text may be incorrect grammatically. A blue wavy underline indicates the text may 
contain a contextual spelling error such as the misuse of homophones (words that are 
pronounced the same but have different spellings or meanings, such as one and won). 
Although you can check the entire message for spelling and grammar errors at once, 
you also can check these flagged errors as they appear on the screen. 
A flagged word is not necessarily misspelled. For example, many names, 
abbreviations, and specialized terms are not in Outlook’s main dictionary. In these 
cases, you instruct Outlook to ignore the flagged word. As you type, Outlook also 
detects duplicate words while checking for spelling errors. For example, if your email 
message contains the phrase to the the store, Outlook places a red wavy underline below 
the second occurrence of the word, the.

Saving and Closing an Email Message
Occasionally, you begin composing a message but cannot complete it. You may 
be waiting for information from someone else to include in the message, or you might 
prefer to rewrite the message later after you have time to evaluate its content. One 
option is to save the message, which stores the message in the Drafts folder for your 
email account until you are ready to send it. The Drafts folder is the default location for 
all saved messages. Later, you can reopen the message, finish writing it, and then send it.
To Check the Spelling of Misspelled Text 
In the following steps, the word program is misspelled intentionally as profram to illustrate Outlook’s check 
spelling as you type feature. If you are performing the steps in this project, your email message may contain 
different misspelled words, depending on the accuracy of your typing. The following steps check the spelling of 
a misspelled word. Why? The way that you present yourself in email messages contributes to the way you are perceived, so 
you should be sure to spell check and proofread all communications.
•	Tap or click after the 
second sentence in the 
email message to Mia 
to place the insertion 
point, and then press 
the spacebar to insert 
a space.
•	Type   Let 
Mr. Thompson know if you have any questions about the profram.   to complete the 
message text, and then press the spacebar so that a red wavy line appears below the misspelled word (Figure 1 – 48). 
•	Press and hold 
or right-click the 
flagged word 
(profram, in this 
case) to display a 
shortcut menu that 
presents a list of 
suggested spelling 
corrections for the 
flagged word (Figure 1 – 49). 
What should I do if the correction I want to use is not listed on the shortcut menu?
You can tap or click outside the shortcut menu to close it and then retype the correct word.
•	Tap or click the 
correct spelling on 
the shortcut menu (in 
this case, program) to 
replace the misspelled 
word in the email 
message with the 
correctly spelled word

To Save and Close an Email Message  
without Sending It
The Summer Study Abroad program information that Mia James requested has been drafted, but Dylan 
is not ready to send it yet. The following steps save a message in the Drafts folder for completion at a later time. 
Why? If you are in the middle of composing a lengthy or important email and get called away, you can save your work so 
you can resume it later.
•	Tap or click the Save button 
on the Quick Access Toolbar 
to save the message in the Drafts 
folder (Figure 1 – 51).
How does Outlook know where 
to store the saved message?
By default, Outlook stores saved 
messages in the Drafts folder for 
your email account.
Can I save the message to a location other than the Drafts folder?
To save the message to the Outlook student folder, tap or click the FILE tab on the ribbon to open the Backstage 
view, and then tap or click Save As in the Backstage view to display the Save As dialog box. Navigate to the Outlook 
student folder. In the File name text box, type the name of the message file and then tap or click the Save button. 
The message is saved with the extension .msg, which represents an Outlook message.
What should I do if Outlook did not save the message in the Drafts folder?

File, and then click the OK button.

To Attach a File to an Email Message
To share a file such as a photo, announcement, or business document through email, you attach the 
file to an email message. Outlook does not have a predefined file size limit for attachments, but an email 
service provider may restrict the size of incoming attachments or the size of the email mailbox. Very large 
email attachments may be rejected by the recipient’s email service provider and returned to the sender as 
undeliverable. Consider the size of a file before attaching it to an email message.

To Set Message Importance  
and Send the Message
Why? When you have a message that requires urgent attention, you can send the message with a high importance 
level. Outlook provides the option to assign an importance level to a message, which indicates to the recipient 
the priority level of an email message. The default importance level for all new messages is normal importance, 
but you can change the importance level to high or low, depending on the priority level of the email message. 
A message sent with high importance displays a red exclamation point in the message header and indicates to 
the recipient that the message requires a higher priority than other messages he or she might have received. The 
low importance option displays a blue arrow and indicates to the recipient a low priority for the message. The 
following steps set the high importance option for a single email message and to send the message.
•	Tap or click the High 
Importance button 
(MESSAGE tab |

a high importance 
level (a red 
exclamation point)

point appear in a

A message appeared that states ‘No valid email accounts are configured. Add an account to send email’. What does 
this mean?
The Dylan.pst data file is an Outlook Data File, which cannot send an email message. If you are using the Dylan.pst

After Outlook closes the message window, it stores the email message reply in the Outbox folder while it sends the 
message to the recipient. You might not see the message in the Outbox because Outlook usually stores it there only 
briefly. Next, Outlook moves the message to the Sent Items folder. The original message in the message list now

Organizing Messages with Outlook Folders 
To keep track of your email messages effectively, Outlook provides a basic set of 
folders, which are containers for storing Outlook items of a specific type, such as 
messages, appointments, or contacts. Email is supposed to help you be more efficient 
and save time, but if you do not manage it effectively, you can quickly become 
overloaded with messages. The Inbox is an email folder that stores your incoming 
email messages. Instead of leaving all of your incoming messages in the Inbox, you 
can create additional folders and then move messages to these new folders so you can 
organize and locate your messages easily.

To Move an Email Message to a Folder
Organizing important email messages about the Summer Study Abroad program into the Study Abroad 
folder saves time when you search through hundreds or thousands of email messages later. Specifically, you will 
move the message from Jacob Thompson from the Inbox folder to the Study Abroad folder. In this case, the 
Inbox folder is called the source folder, and the Study Abroad folder is called the destination folder. A source 
folder is the location of the document or message to be moved or copied. A destination folder is the location 
where you want to move or copy the file or message. The following steps move an email message into a folder. 
Why? By organizing your emails into topical folders, you can access your messages easily.
•	In the Inbox folder (source folder), tap or click the Jacob Thompson message header in the Inbox message list to 
select the email message.
•	Tap or click HOME on the ribbon to display the HOME tab.
•	Tap or click the Move button (HOME tab | Move group) to display the Move menu (Figure 1 – 66).

Working with the Mailbox
The system administrator who manages a company’s or school’s email system 
may set limits for the size of the Outlook mailbox due to limited space on the server. 
Some email service providers may not deliver new mail to a mailbox that exceeds the 
limit set by the system administrator. You can determine the total size of your mailbox 
and other details about individual folders.

mail items are contained in the new folders.
	 4.	The Favorites section is at the top of the Folder Pane on the left. Display a duplicate of the 
River Rafting folder in the Favorites section. 
	 5.	To the message regarding the Riverfront Campground, assign a flag for follow-up for tomorrow.
	 6.	Based on the message headers and content of the email messages in the Extend 1-1 mailbox, 
move each message to the appropriate folders you created. Figure 1 – 78 shows the mailbox 
with the messages moved to the new folders.
	 7.	Export the Inbox mailbox to an Outlook Data File (.pst). Navigate to the Outlook folder in the 
Documents library, save the document using the file name Extend 1-1 River Rafting.pst, and 
then submit it in the format specified by your instructor.

Microsoft Outlook 2013
This introductory chapter covers features and functions common to managing 
calendars in Outlook 2013.
Roadmap
In this chapter, you will learn how to perform basic calendar tasks. The following 
roadmap identifies general activities you will perform as you progress through this chapter:
1.	 configure the calendar options
2.	 create and manipulate appointments 
3.	 schedule events
4.	 schedule meetings
5.	 print a calendar
6.	 save and share a calendar
At the beginning of step instructions throughout the chapter, you will see an 
abbreviated form of this roadmap. The abbreviated roadmap uses colors to indicate 
chapter progress: gray means the chapter is beyond that activity, blue means the 
task being shown is covered in that activity, and black means that activity is yet to be 
covered. For example, the following abbreviated roadmap indicates the chapter would 
be showing a task in the Schedule Meetings activity.
1 configure calendar options | 2 create & manipulate appointments | 3 schedule events
4 schedule meetings | 5 print calendar | 6 save & share calendar
Use the abbreviated roadmap as a progress guide while you read or step through 
the instructions in this chapter.
Introduction to the Outlook Calendar
Plan your day, keep track of your deadlines, and increase your daily productivity. 
Whether you are a student, club organizer, or business professional, you can take 
advantage of the Outlook Calendar to schedule and manage appointments, events, and 
meetings. In particular, you can use Calendar to keep track of your class schedule and 
appointments and to schedule meetings. If you are traveling and do not have electronic 
access to your calendar, you can print a copy to keep with you. You can use Outlook to 
view a daily, weekly, or monthly calendar. 
In addition to using Calendar in your academic or professional life, you will find 
it helpful for scheduling personal time. Most people have multiple appointments to 
keep each day, week, or month. Calendar can organize activity-related information in 
a structured, readable manner. You can create a calendar folder for a specific project 
and share it with your friends and co-workers.

Project — Appointments, Events,  
and Meetings in Calendar
By creating a daily time management schedule, you can stay organized and reduce your 
stress level. Managing your schedule using a calendar can increase productivity while 
maximizing free time. Outlook is the perfect tool to maintain both a professional and 
a personal schedule. The Calendar is the Outlook folder that contains your personal 
schedule of appointments, events, and meetings. In this project, you use the basic 
features of Calendar to create a calendar for appointments, classes, work schedules, and 
meetings for a student (Figure 2–1).
Figure 2–1
People use a calendar to keep track of their schedule and to organize and 
manage their time. For students, a class list with room numbers and class times would 
be a good start toward managing their school schedule. For business professionals, 
the calendar is a dynamic tool that requires frequent updating to keep track of 
appointments and meetings. You also may want to keep track of personal items, such as 
doctor appointments, birthdays, and family gatherings. 
Configuring the Outlook Calendar
When you start Outlook, the Mail view appears. The Navigation Bar displays four 
views — Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks. You changed the Navigation Bar icons 
to text in Chapter 1. By selecting Calendar, you can create a customized calendar to 
assist in scheduling your day, week, and month. Before scheduling your first calendar 
appointment, you can add a personal calendar and customize your settings to fit the

way you work. Each day as you check your calendar for the day’s events, the Weather 
Bar displays your local weather so you can plan whether you need an umbrella or not. 
By adding national holidays to your Outlook calendar, you can make sure these dates 
are prominent in your calendar. 
For an introduction 
to Windows 8 and 
­instruction about how 
to perform basic  
Windows 8 tasks, read 
the Office 2013 and 
Windows 8 chapter at 
the beginning of this 
book, where you can 
learn how to resize  
windows, change screen 
resolution, create  
folders, move and rename 
files, use Windows Help, 
and much more.
What advantages does a digital calendar like Outlook provide instead of using a paper planner or wall 
calendar?
A digital calendar provides access from any location by synching your computer or smartphone with the cloud to view your 
­appointments and meetings. You can view your schedule within an email meeting invitation. You can view more than one 
­calendar at a time, share others’ calendars, and overlay calendars to plan a meeting date with colleagues.

Calendar Window
The Calendar - Outlook Data File - Microsoft Outlook window shown in 
Figure 2–2 includes a variety of features to help you work efficiently. It contains many 
elements similar to the windows in other Office programs, as well as some that are 
unique to Outlook. The main elements of the Calendar window are the Navigation 
Pane and the appointment area.
The Navigation Pane includes two panes: the Date Navigator and the My 
Calendars pane. The Date Navigator includes the present month’s calendar in 
Figure 2–2. The calendar displays the current month with a blue box around the 
current date, scroll arrows to advance from one month to another, and any date 
on which an item is scheduled in bold. The My Calendars pane includes a list of 
available calendars where you can view a single calendar or view additional calendars 
side by side. The appointment area contains a date banner and a Weather Bar that 
displays today’s weather in the selected city. The appointment area displays one-hour 
time slots split in half hours by default when viewing Calendar in Day, Work Week, or

Calendar Items
An item is any element in Outlook that contains information. Examples 
of calendar items include appointments, events, and meetings. All calendar items 
start as an appointment. Outlook defines an appointment, such as a doctor’s 
appointment, as an activity that does not involve other people or resources, such 
as conference rooms. Outlook defines an event, such as a seminar or vacation, as 
an activity that occurs at least once and lasts 24 hours or longer. An appointment 
becomes an event when you schedule it for the entire day. An annual event, such as 
a birthday, anniversary, or holiday, occurs yearly on a specific date. Events do not 
occupy time slots in the appointment area and, instead, are displayed in a banner 
below the day heading when viewing the calendar in Day, Work Week, or Week 
view. An appointment becomes a meeting when people and other resources, such as 
meeting rooms, are invited. 
When you create items on your calendar, it is helpful to show your time using 
the appointment status information. You set the appointment status for a calendar item 
using the Show As button, which provides four options for showing your time on the 
calendar: Free, Tentative, Busy, and Out of Office. For example, if you are studying 
or working on a project, you might show your time as busy because you are unable to 
perform other tasks at the same time. On the other hand, a dental appointment or a 
class would show your time as Out of Office because you need to leave your home or 
office to attend. Table 2–1 describes the items you can schedule on your calendar and 
the appointment status option associated with each item. Each calendar item also can 
be one-time or recurring.
To Run Outlook
If you are using a computer to step through the project in this chapter and 
you want your screens to match the figures in this book, you should change your 
screen’s resolution to 1366 3 768. For information about how to change a computer’s 
resolution, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at the beginning of this book.
The following steps, which assume Windows 8 is running, use the Start screen 
or search box to run Outlook based on a typical installation. You may need to ask 
your instructor how to run Outlook on your computer. For a detailed example of the 
procedure summarized below, refer to the Office and Windows chapter.

To Create a Personal Calendar Folder
When you schedule an appointment, Outlook adds the appointment to the Calendar folder by default. 
If you are creating personal, academic, and business items, you may want to create a separate calendar for each 
group. Users often create multiple calendars to keep personal items separate from academic or business items. As 
in other Outlook folders, such as the Inbox, you can create multiple folders within the Calendar folder that each 
contain one or more calendars. The following steps create a calendar to store your personal and school-related 
information separate from your default Calendar within the same calendar group. Why? In certain situations, you 
may need to keep more than one calendar, such as one for business items and another for personal items.

Navigating the Calendar
Each Microsoft Outlook folder displays the items it contains in a layout called 
a view. The calendar view is the arrangement and format of the folder contents by 
day, work week, week, month, or schedule, which is a horizontal layout. Recall that 
the default view of the Calendar folder is Month view. Some people prefer a different 
view of their calendar, such as weekly or daily. For instance, you might want to view 
all the items for a day at one time, in which case Day view would work best. Although 
the Outlook window looks different in each view, you can accomplish the same tasks in 
each view: you can add, edit, or delete appointments, events, and meetings. 
To Go to a Specific Date
To display a date that is not visible in the current view so that you can view that date in the appointment 
area, one option is to use the Go to Date Dialog Box Launcher. The following steps display a specific date in the 
appointment area in a calendar. Why? Rather than scrolling through your calendars in Outlook to find a specific date, 
you can quickly find a date in Outlook by using the Go To Date dialog box.

To Display the Calendar in Month View
Month view resembles a standard monthly calendar page and displays a schedule for an entire month. 
Appointments can be displayed in each date in the calendar. The following step displays the calendar in Month 
view. Why? By viewing the entire month without scrolling through individual appointments, you can see when you have an 
open day.

To Display the Calendar  
in Schedule View
The Schedule View allows you to view multiple calendars over the course of a single day in a horizontal 
layout to make scheduling meetings easier. The following steps display the default Calendar and the Personal 
calendar in Schedule View. Why? Schedule View is useful when trying to see multiple calendars so that you can check for 
overlapping items.

To Add Holidays to the Default Calendar
Before you add appointments to a calendar, you can mark the standard holidays for one or more countries. 
You can add holidays to your default calendar folder only, not to a public folder or nondefault calendar such as 
the Personal calendar. However, you can drag holidays from your default calendar to nondefault calendars. Why? 
International businesses should be aware of national holidays within each country where they do business. The following 
steps add national holidays to the default calendar.

Q&A
Figure 2–23
Creating and Editing Appointments
An appointment is an activity that you schedule in your Outlook calendar that does 
not require an invitation to others. Recall that every calendar item you schedule in 
Outlook Calendar begins as an appointment. In Outlook, you easily can change an 
appointment to an event or a meeting. Scheduling a dental visit, your best friend’s 
birthday, or a class schedule as recurring appointments helps you successfully manage 
your activities and obligations. To better organize your appointments and meetings 
in your Outlook calendar, you can add color categories that let you scan and visually 
associate similar items. For example, you can set the color blue to represent your 
academic classes and the color green for doctor’s appointments. 
Creating Appointments in the Appointment Area
A one-time appointment, such as a concert event, conference call, or course 
exam date is an appointment that occurs only once on a calendar. A recurring 
appointment, such as a class throughout an academic course, repeats on the calendar 
at regular intervals. Appointments can be created in two ways: using the appointment 
area, where you enter the appointment directly in the appropriate time slot, or using 
the Untitled – Appointment window, where you can enter more specific details about 
the appointment such as the location or address of the activity.

Organize the Calendar with Color Categories
As you add appointments to the Outlook Calendar, you can use categories to 
color-code the appointments by type. Adding color categories allows you to quickly 
scan and visually group similar items such as classes or work-related appointments. For 
example, you can assign your classes to a blue category, work appointments to orange, 
doctor’s appointments to green, and all friends- and family-related activities to purple. 
After you associate each category with a color, you can categorize each appointment. 
The associated color is used as the item’s background color on the calendar in the 
appointment area.

Creating Appointments Using the Appointment 
Window
Another way to create an appointment is by using the Appointment window, 
which provides additional options for entering an appointment, such as the location 
of the appointment and a recurrence pattern. When you set a recurrence pattern, 
Outlook schedules the appointment on the calendar at regular intervals for a 
designated period of time, such as a class that you take for an entire semester on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Outlook also allows you to configure a reminder, similar to an alarm clock 
reminder, which is an alert window that briefly appears on your screen to remind you 
of an upcoming appointment. You also can set a chime or other sound to play as part of 
the reminder. 
Another option when creating an appointment is to set the appointment status, 
which is how the time for a calendar item is marked on your calendar. The default 
appointment status setting is Busy, as indicated in the previous steps, but you can 
change the status to reflect your availability as appropriate.
To Create an Appointment Using  
the Appointment Window
Why? Instead of directly entering an appointment in the appointment area, you can specify various details such as the 
location by using the Appointment window. To schedule an appointment such as a CIS 101 computer class that meets 
repeatedly over the semester in a particular room on campus, you decide to use the Appointment window. The 
following steps create an appointment using the Appointment window. 
•	Tap or click home on the ribbon to display the home tab.
•	Tap or click the New Appointment button (home tab | New group) to open the Untitled – Appointment window 
(Figure 2–34).

Why did the title of the window change from Untitled – Appointment to CIS 101 – Appointment?
The title bar displays the name of the appointment. Because the name of the appointment has changed, the name 
on the title bar also changes.

Creating Recurring Appointments
Many appointments are recurring appointments, meaning they happen 
at regular intervals for a designated period of time. The recurring appointment is 
configured with a recurrence pattern designating the rate of recurrence, for example, 
weekly, and on what day(s) of the week the appointment occurs.
Can you customize the sound that is played when a reminder is displayed?
•	When you tap or click the Reminder box arrow (CALENDAR TOOLS APPOINTMENT tab | Options group), tap or click Sound to 
open the Reminder Sound dialog box.
•	Tap or click the Browse button, and then select the sound .wav file that you want played.
•	Tap or click the Open button. Tap or click the OK button to select the custom reminder sound.
•	A reminder time must be selected before the Sound command appears.

Using Natural Language Phrasing
In the previous steps, you entered dates and times in the Appointment window 
using standard numeric entries, such as 9/08/2014. You also can specify appointment 
dates and times using natural language. A natural language phrase is a phrase closely 
resembling how people speak during normal conversation. For example, you can type 
a phrase, such as “next Thursday” or “two weeks from yesterday,” or you can type a 
single word, such as “midnight,” and Outlook will calculate the correct date and time 
relative to the current date and time on the computer’s system clock.
Outlook also can convert abbreviations and ordinal numbers into complete 
words and dates. For example, you can type “Feb” instead of “February” or “the first of 
May” instead of “5/1”. Outlook’s Calendar also can convert words such as “yesterday” 
and “tomorrow” and the names of holidays that occur on the same date each year, such 
as Valentine’s Day. Table 2–5 lists various natural language options.

Time Using Natural Language Phrases
Using a natural language phrase, you can make an appointment for your best friend’s birthday party next

To Move an Appointment  
to a Different Date
Why? If you are moving an appointment to a new date at the same time, you can drag the appointment to the new 
date on the Date Navigator instead of retyping it. The following step moves an appointment to a new date in the 
same time slot.
Figure 2–54
Editing Appointments
Schedules often need to be rearranged, so Outlook provides several ways to 
edit appointments. You can change the subject or location by tapping or clicking the 
appointment and editing the information directly in the appointment area. You can 
change the subject, location, date, or time by double-tapping or double-clicking the 
appointment and making corrections using the Appointment window. You can specify 
whether all occurrences in a series of recurring appointments need to be changed, or 
only a single occurrence should be altered.
To Move an Appointment to a Different  
Time on the Same Day
Suppose that you cannot attend the Dentist appointment at 10:00 am on September 24, 2014. The 
appointment needs to be rescheduled to 11:00 am for the same amount of time. Why? Instead of deleting and then 
retyping the appointment, you can drag it to a new time slot. The following step moves an appointment to a new time 
slot.

Scheduling Events
Similar to appointments, events are activities that last 24 hours or longer. Examples 
of events include seminars, vacations, birthdays, and anniversaries. Events can be one-
time or recurring, and differ from appointments in one primary way — they do not 
appear in individual time slots in the appointment area. Instead, the event description 
appears in a small banner below the day heading. As with an appointment, the event 
status can be free, busy, tentative, or out of the office and categorized according to the 
type of event. An all-day appointment displays your time as busy when viewed by other 
people, but an event or annual event displays your time as free. By default, all-day 
events occur from midnight to midnight. 
To Create a One-Time Event in the  
Appointment Window
Why? An event represents an appointment that is scheduled over a period of days such as a conference. A Career 
Fair is being held at the Chamber of Commerce from November 3, 2014 through November 5, 2014, and you 
want to attend. Because the Career Fair will last for several days, Outlook will schedule the conference as an 
event. You are not certain you can attend the fair, so you decide to show your time for the event as Tentative. 
The following steps create an event on the calendar.
1 configure calendar options | 2 create & manipulate appointments | 3 schedule events
4 schedule meetings | 5 print calendar | 6 save & share calendar
•	Tap or click the New Items button (home tab | New group) to display the New Items list (Figure 2–59).

•	Type   Chamber of Commerce   as

•	Tap or click the Start time calendar

Fair begins (Figure 2–60).

•	Tap or click the Categorize button (EVENT tab | Tags group) to display the Categorize list of color categories.
•	Tap or click Work to assign the event to a category (Figure 2–61).
Why does the Show As box originally display the time as Free?
The default Show As appointment status for events is Free because events do not occupy blocks of time during the 
day on the calendar.

•	Tap or click the Save & Close button (EVENT tab | Actions group) to save the event and close the window.
•	Tap or click 3 in the November 2014 calendar on the Date Navigator to display the selected date in the appointment

Why is the Career Fair event displayed at the top of the Day view of the calendar?
Events do not occupy time slots on the Day view of the calendar, so they appear as banners at the top of the 
calendar on the day they occur.
Why is the Appointment area filled with slashed bars?
The slashed bars identify the time as a tentative event.

To Create a Recurring Event Using  
the Appointment Window
A recurring event is similar to a recurring appointment in that it occurs at regular intervals on your 
calendar. However, editing a recurring event is slightly different from editing one-time events. You can specify 
whether all occurrences in a series of recurring events need to be changed or if a single occurrence should be 
altered.
You want to add your pay schedule to the calendar to keep track of when you receive a paycheck. The 
following steps create a recurring event for your pay schedule. Why? To keep up with a periodic event such as your 
pay date, the recurring event feature gives you a way to remind yourself of important dates.
•	Tap or click the New Items button (home tab | New group) to display the New Items list.
•	Tap or click All Day Event to open the Untitled – Event window. 
•	In the Subject text box, type   Payday   as the subject.
•	In the first Start time text box, type   9/19/2014   as the first payday, and then press the enter key (Figure 2–64).
Do I need to add a location to the Payday event?
No, an event such as a payday, birthday, or anniversary does not have a location.

Scheduling Meetings
As defined earlier, a meeting is an appointment that you invite other people to attend. 
Each person who is invited can accept, accept as tentative, or decline a meeting 
request. A meeting also can include resources such as conference rooms. The person 
who creates the meeting and sends the invitations is known as the meeting organizer. 
The meeting organizer schedules a meeting by creating a meeting request, which is 
an email invitation to the meeting and arrives in each attendee’s Inbox. Responses to

a meeting request arrive in the Inbox of the meeting organizer. To create a meeting 
request, you use the Untitled – Meeting request window, which is similar to the 
Untitled – Appointment window with a few exceptions. The meeting request window 
includes the To text box, where you enter an email address for attendees, who are 
people invited to the meeting, and the Send button, which sends the invitation for the 
meeting to the attendees. When a meeting request arrives in the attendee’s Inbox, it 
displays an icon different from an email message icon.
Before you invite others to a meeting, confirm that the meeting date and 
time are available. Your school or business may have shared calendars that can be 
downloaded to your Outlook calendar. This shared calendar may be an iCalendar with 
an .ics file extension. An iCalendar represents a universal calendar format used by 
several email and calendar programs, including Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, 
and Apple iCal. The iCalendar format enables users to publish and share calendar 
information on the Web and by email.
Before you send out a meeting request, how can you set the groundwork for an effective meeting?
•	Import other calendars to compare everyone’s schedule.
•	Prepare an agenda stating the purpose of the meeting.
•	Be sure you include everyone who needs to attend the meeting. Invite only those people whose attendance is absolutely 
­necessary to ensure that all of the agenda items can be addressed at the meeting.
•	Confirm that the location of the meeting is available and that the room is the appropriate size for the number of people 
­invited. Also, make sure the room can accommodate any multimedia equipment that might be needed for the meeting, such 
as a projector or telephone.

To Import an iCalendar File
Before scheduling a meeting, you can open your school’s calendar to view your availability. Your school has

The Outlook navigation bar provides a Peek feature, a pop-up access to email, calendar, people, and tasks. 
Why? Using the Peek feature, you can take a quick glance at your schedule without having to rearrange windows or lose

To Create and Send a Meeting Request 
Why? To find the best time to meet with other people, request a meeting, and keep track of the meeting date in your 
Inbox, you can send a meeting request in Outlook. You want to meet with the financial aid office to discuss your 
financial aid for next semester. Rather than send an email message requesting the meeting, you decide to use 
Outlook Calendar to create this meeting. Meetings can be scheduled on your default calendar or supplemental 
calendars. The following steps display the default calendar, create a meeting request, and send an invitation to 
the financial aid office. If you are completing this project on a personal computer, your email address must be 
set up in Outlook (see Chapter 1) so you can send an email meeting invitation. Use the email address of your 
instructor instead of the financial aid email address.

To Change the Time of a Meeting

Your schedule has changed, which means you need to change the time of the meeting with the financial aid 
office and send an update about the change. Though the invitee can propose a new time, only the originator can 
change or delete the meeting. Why? You can update any meeting request to add or remove attendees or resources, change 
the meeting to a recurring series, or move the meeting to a different date or time. The following steps change the time 
of the meeting and send an update to the attendee. If you are completing this project on a personal computer, 
your email account must be set up in Outlook (see Chapter 1) to be able to view the meeting request.

file with others; posting it 
on a social networking site, 
blog, or other website; and 
sharing a link associated 
with an online location of 
the calendar. You also can 
create and share a PDF or 
XPS image of the calendar, 
so that users can view the 
file in Acrobat Reader or XPS 
Viewer instead of in Outlook.

OUT 116   Outlook Chapter 2   Managing Calendars with Outlook
Saving and Sharing the Calendar
For security and convenience, you can save your Outlook calendar by backing up 
your entire Outlook personal folder files (.pst) or an individual calendar (.ics). As a 
reminder, in Chapter 1 you saved the Outlook .pst file, which contained a backup of 
your email, calendar, and contacts. Saving your calendar file allows you to back up your 
appointments, events, and meetings in a single file. You can then move your calendar 
to another computer, for example, and continue to schedule items there. Besides saving 
your calendar, you can share it with others, whether they use Outlook or not. Finally, 
scheduling a meeting with someone who cannot see your calendar can be difficult, so 
you can share your calendar through email. 
With Outlook, each appointment, task, or contact can be saved as a separate 
iCalendar file or you can save the whole calendar to your local computer or external 
storage device. An iCalendar file with the .ics file extension can be imported by 
other programs such as Google Calendar. Instead of emailing an iCalendar file as an 
attachment to share your calendar, you can share portions of your entire calendar 
through a built-in function in Outlook.
Figure 2–92
To Save a Calendar as an iCalendar File
You have performed many tasks while creating this calendar and do not want to risk losing work 
completed thus far. Accordingly, you should save the calendar on your hard disk, SkyDrive, or a location that is 
most appropriate to your situation.
   The following steps assume you already have created folders for storing your files, for example, a 
CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains an Outlook folder (for your assignments). Thus, these steps save the 
calendar in the Outlook folder in the CIS 101 folder on your desired save location. For a detailed example of the 
procedure for saving a file in a folder or saving a file on SkyDrive, refer to the Office and Windows chapter at 
the beginning of this book. 
Why? By saving a copy of your calendar to an iCalendar format, you can back up or share your calendar with your 
business colleagues or friends. The following steps save a calendar. They assume you already have created folders 
for storing your files, for example, a CIS 101 folder (for your class) that contains an Outlook folder (for your 
assignments).

Creating and Sharing a Calendar
Instructions:  Start Outlook. You are assisting with a local Little League baseball team. Create a 
new calendar to share the practice and game dates with the team. Use Outlook Help to learn how 
to create a calendar group, change the color of the calendar, and create a private appointment. 
Perform the following tasks:
	 1.	Run Outlook and create a new calendar group called Community Calendars.
	 2.	Create a blank calendar named Tigers Baseball and then move it to the Community Calendars 
calendar group.
	 3.	Change the color of the entire calendar to the team’s color, orange.
	 4.	Create an appointment named Coaches Summit for March 3, 2014 at Lopez Field from  
7:00 pm for 2 hours. Mark the appointment as private so that others will not see details of this 
calendar item.
	 5.	Add a recurring Baseball Practice appointment from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm on Tuesday and 
Thursday beginning on March 4 and continuing for 20 occurrences at Lopez Field. 
	 6.	Add a recurring Game Day as an All Day event starting on March 8 and lasting for 10 weeks.
	 7.	If requested by your instructor, change the Weather Bar to display weather information for 
your hometown. The completed calendar is shown in Figure 2–98.

 Think about the reason you might share your Outlook Calendar. In the case of sharing a 
Little League baseball calendar with the players’ parents, why would a digital calendar be more 
helpful to the parents instead of a paper schedule?

Correcting Errors in Calendar Appointments
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Instructions:  Start Outlook. Open the Analyze Correct Improve 2-1 file from the Data Files for 
Students. While reviewing your Outlook calendar, you realize that you created several appoint-
ments incorrectly. You will identify and open the incorrect appointments, edit them so that they 
reflect the correct information, improve the organization by adding categories, and then save all 
changes.
1. Correct  Display only the Analyze Correct Improve 2-1 Exercise Calendar in the Outlook 
Calendar window. The Kickboxing class scheduled for Wednesday, October 1, 2014 is a recurring 
appointment on your calendar. Change the appointment to reflect the Kickboxing class meeting 
every Thursday starting October 2, 2014 through the end of November from 7:30 pm until 
9:00 pm. The class will not meet on Thanksgiving. While adding an appointment for your yearly 
physical to the Calendar, you inadvertently recorded the appointment time as 3:00 am instead of 
3:00 pm. Edit the appointment on October 7, 2014, and change the Start time to 3:00 pm. The 
appointment still lasts one hour.
2. Improve  Add reminders 30 minutes before each of the Kickboxing classes. Create a red 
category for Exercise and a new blue category for Medical. Add the correct category to each of 
the appointments. If requested by your instructor, add your birthday as an All Day event in 2014. 
Save the Calendar as Analyze Correct Improve 2-1 Exercise Calendar Updated, as shown in Figure 
2–99, and submit the iCalendar in the format specified by your instructor.

Capstone Project 1: 
Hammonds County  
Dog Park
The Capstone Project consists of an integrated, comprehensive set of problems related to a single 
scenario. Students apply concepts and skills presented in this book to create solutions to the 
problems using Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and Outlook.
RescuePets Animal Shelter, which is located in Hammonds County in Florida, received 
a donation of land for a county dog park, to be called the Hammonds County Dog Park. The 
donation stipulated that the animal shelter must raise the necessary funds to build and maintain 
the dog park without using government funding. The board of directors for RescuePets already 
has a strategic plan and a master design for the dog park that builds the park in phases. Fund-
ing for Phase 1 is almost completed, and pet owners are eager to begin using the park. Not 
only will the park be a place where dogs can run off leash, but there is enough space for a small 
educational building. The animal shelter can use the dog park and building to provide obedi-
ence training and classes on pet care to children and adults. To raise funds to complete the dog 
park, the animal shelter put together a committee of interested and committed individuals to run 
a fundraising campaign. The campaign’s theme is Together we can make it happen! The committee 
holds fundraisers, solicits donations from businesses and individuals, and applies for founda-
tion grants. Because you have a job at the animal shelter helping with community involvement 
and public relations, you have been providing support to the committee.

Creating, Querying, and Maintaining the Friends of Dog Park Database
Problem:  Misty Vern, the animal shelter director, has asked you to work on a special project for the 
new dog park. Because the dog park will not receive any county funding for maintenance, the shelter 
has created a Friends group. Friends are dog owners who pay a membership fee and dog fees to use 
the park. Membership fees are based on (a) whether the owner is a county resident and (b) whether 
they are over 65 years of age or disabled. Dog fees vary depending on the number of dogs as well 
as residency and age of owner. Currently, the shelter director has the information about dogs and 
owners stored in the two Excel workbooks shown in Figure 1 – 7. Each dog has only one owner, but 
an owner may have more than one dog. Alyssa Kelly has applied at the shelter to adopt a dog but does 
not yet have one.
Instructions Part 1:  Using the data shown in Figure 1 – 7, design and create the dog park member-
ship database. Use the database guidelines provided in Access Chapter 1 to help you in the design 
process. Call the database Capstone 1 Membership.

for Membership Fee, and DP Fee for Dog Park Fee. Resize the columns to best fit the data. Save 
the changes to the layout of the table.
Import the Capstone 1 Dog Data workbook shown in Figure 1 – 7 (b) into the database. Use 
the name Dog for the table. Be sure to determine the primary key. Use Design view to adjust the 
data types and field sizes. The Age field is an integer field. Use the caption Lic # for License Num-
ber and Own # for the Owner Number field. In Datasheet view, resize the columns to best fit the 
data and save the changes to the layout of the table.
Use the Simple Query Wizard to create a query that displays the owner number, last and first 
names, street, city, postal code, and date joined. Save the query as Owner Query. Open the Owner 
Query and add a criterion to restrict the postal code to those owners who live in postal code 32765. 
Save the query as Owner Postal Code Query.
Create a simple form for the Owner table. Save the form as Owner Form. Use the Report 
button to create the report shown in Figure 1 – 8 for the Owner table. Be sure to change the col-
umn headings for the Owner Number, Membership Fee, and Dog Park Fee fields and adjust the 
column widths. You may need to move the page control and expand the size of the total controls. 
Save the report as Owner ­Financial Report.
Figure 1 – 8
Instructions Part 2:  Answer the following questions using the Owner table, and include the owner’s 
number, last and first names, city, membership fee, and dog park fee fields. Save each query using a 
format similar to the following: Part 2 Step a Query, Part 2 Step b Query, and so on.
	a.	 Which owners are located in Lewiston?
	b.	 Which owners’ last names begin with A?
	c.	 Which owners joined the Friends group before June 1, 2014? (Date Joined should not appear in 
the results.)
	d.	 Which owners have dog park fees of $0.00?
	e.	 Which owners have membership fees greater than $100 and dog fees  
greater than $50?
	 f.	 Which owners have membership fees greater than $100 or live in Rivard?

	g.	 Sort the owners so that those owners with the highest membership fees and the highest dog 
park fees appear at the top, and then display only the first five records.
	h.	 Create a parameter query that requests the owner’s last name and then displays the owner’s 
number, last and first names, membership fee, and dog park fee.
Misty Vern wants to view information about the owners and their dogs. Join the Owner and 
Dog tables, including the owner’s number, last and first names from the Owner table. Include the 
license number, dog’s name and park fee from the Dog table. Sort the results in ascending order by 
Owner Number and License Number. Save the query as Owners and Dogs Query. She would like 
the results to include all owners even if they currently have no dogs registered to use the park. Ex-
port the Owners and Dogs Query to Excel, and save the export steps. 
Use the Report Wizard to create a report based on the query. Include all fields in the report 
except Park Fee and save the report as Owners and Dogs Report. Use the Form button to create a 
form for the query. Name the form Owners and Dogs Form.
Using the Owner table, create a query that includes a calculated field for the  
total of membership fee and dog park fee. Assign the caption Fee Total to the field. Display the 
owner’s number, last name and first name, membership fee, dog park fee, and Fee Total field in the 
results. Name the query Fee Total Query.
Create queries to calculate the following statistics (a) What are the total membership fees and 
the total dog park fees for all owners? (b) What is the average membership fee for all owners who 
live in Rivard? (c) What is the average dog park fee by postal code? Save each query.
Instructions Part 3:  Misty has provided you with data to update some owner and dog information. 
Create a split form for the Owner table with the name Owner Split Form. Mike and Jane Robinson 
joined the Friends group on September 25, 2014. Their owner number is RO123 and they live 
at 900 Ocean Dr., Glander Bay, FL 31044. They paid $50 for a membership and $25 for the dog 
park fee. Currently, they do not have a dog, but they have applied at the shelter to adopt one. Add 
the Robinsons’ data to the Owner table. Use the Owner Split Form and the Find button to locate 
owner TR222, and change the address to 922 Crestwood St. Use a common filter to find all records 
in the Owner table where the dog park fee is $0.00. Change the fee to $25.00.
Bruce and Jean Adney’s daughter has just graduated from college and has a new job in 
­Illinois. Oscar is her dog and she is taking him with her. Open the Dog table in Datasheet view, 
and use Filter by Form to find the record where the dog’s name is Oscar and the owner’s number is 
AD057. Delete the record. Alyssa Kelly adopted a dog from the animal shelter. Bella is a 2-year old 
female. Her license number is T0128 and her park fee is $25. Add Bella’s information to the 
Dog table. 
Because there are only two choices for the Gender field in the Dog table, changing this field 
to a lookup field would make it easier to enter data. Also, the group would like you to add a field 
that gives an idea of the physical size of each dog. The values in this field will be Small, Medium, 
and Large. Small dogs weigh 30 pounds or less, large dogs weigh 80 pounds or more, and medium 
dogs are between 30 and 80 pounds. Using Design view, change the Gender field to a lookup field 
with only two values; Female and Male. Add a Size Category lookup field with the values, Small, 
Medium, and Large. The Size Category field should appear before the Park Fee field. For both 
lookup fields, limit the list to only those choices. Use an update query to assign all dogs to the 
Medium category and save the query. Make the following changes to the Dog table:
Change the Size Category for dogs A1111, B3456, E1515, H2978, P5444, and S0078 
to Large.
Change the Size Category for dogs D8877, G4389, H1565, J2727, M2222, and P3211 
to Small.

In the Owner table, specify that Last Name is a required field and use FL as the default value 
for the State field. In the Dog table, specify that Dog Name is a required field and that Park Fee 
must be greater than $0 and less than or equal to $50. Test the validation rules in each table and 
save the changes.
After reviewing the database, the committee would like to make sure that no dog is assigned 
to an owner that is not in the database. They also want the ability to change an Owner Number in 
the Owner table and have the change applied to the Dog table.
Using the Owner table, add a Total row that includes the total for the Membership 
Fee and the Dog Park Fee. Change the font for the datasheet to Arial and the font size to 10. 
Change the alternate row color to Brown 3 (row 4 last column of Standard colors). If requested 
by your instructor, change the last name and first name for owner AD057 to your last and first 
name. Save your changes to the database and submit the database in the format specified by 
your instructor.

you to think beyond the assigned project. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your 
instructor. Possible formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that 
contains the answer; present your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio 
or video using a webcam, smartphone, or ­portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.
1.	Why do you think the Pet Party in the Park flyer used the Red Orange theme colors?
2.	The Dog Park presentation used the Parallax theme with the brown variant. Is there another theme that also 
would work for the presentation? Why?
3.	The worksheet shown in Figure 1 – 5 uses the Currency Number format in the range B2:G2 and the Accounting 
format in the range B3:G6. What other format(s) could you use for these values in the worksheet? Why?
4.	The Membership database included several fields, such as Owner Number, that had captions. Why would you 
use a caption for a field name?
5.	The email message in Figure 1 – 9 uses Hello as the greeting for the email. Are there any greetings you should 
not use in a professional email? List several and describe why they are not appropriate.

Instructions Part 2:  Alyssa Kerry has given you the following corrections to the data: Publications 
in Q3 should be $380, and Client Fees in Q1 should be $15,275. 
Apply the Metropolitan theme to the Yearly Revenue worksheet. Change the font and font 
size in cell A1 to Century, 20 point. Change the font size in cell A2 to 16 point. Remove the merge 
of cells A1 and A2, and then merge and center the range A1:H1 and the range A2:H2.

Average   in cells B14 through D14. Use the Format Painter to copy the format in cell A14 to the 
range B14:D14. In cell B15, determine the maximum of client fees in the cell range B4:E4 and copy 
the formula to cells B16:B19. In cell C15, determine the minimum of client fees in the cell range 
B4:E4 and copy to cells C16:C19. In cell D15, determine the average of client fees in the cell range 
B4:E4 and copy to cells D16:D19.  Change the background color of the range A14:D19 to Dark 
Teal, Text 2, Lighter 75%, and draw a thick box border around the range.
In cell H3, type   Percent of Total   and wrap the text. Use the Format Painter to apply 
the formatting from cell F3 to cell H3. Use a formula to determine what percentage each revenue 
source is of the yearly revenue total. In cell H4, the Client Fees Percent of Total Revenue equals 
the Total Client Fees Revenue (cell F4) divided by the Total Revenue (cell F9), or =F4/F9. Copy 
the formula from cell H4 to the range H5:H8. Be sure to use absolute cell references as needed. 
Format the range H4:H8 as Percentage number format with one decimal place. Set the width of 
column G to 43 pixels and the width of column H to 97 pixels.
Select the ranges A4:A8 and H4:H8, and then insert a 3-D Pie chart as shown in Figure 2 – 7. 
Move the chart to a new sheet with the name, Revenue by Source. Change the tab color to the Blue 
standard color and drag the tab to the right of Yearly Revenue. Insert the chart title, Revenue by 
Source, above the chart, and change the font size to 24 point. Add custom data labels to the chart 
that include the category name and leader lines and position the labels with best fit. Change the 
font size of the data labels to 16 point and bold the labels. Rotate the chart so that the Y rotation is 
40 degrees and the Perspective is 15 degrees.
Compare your chart to Figure 2 – 7 and make any necessary corrections. Use Range Finder to 
check your formulas, and then save your workbook.

Instructions Part 3:  Alyssa Kerry wants you to project revenue for next year using the 
Yearly Revenue worksheet. Use the Format Painter to apply the formatting from cell H3 
to I3. Add the column label, Revenue Trends in cell I3 and set the width of the column to 
96 pixels. Insert a sparkline chart for the range B4:E4 in cell I4. Copy the chart in cell I4 to the 
range I5:I8.
In cell J1, enter the phrase,   Percent Change,  and wrap the text. Enter   .035   in cell 
J2, and then format the cell as a percentage with one decimal place. Apply the Green, Accent 6, 
Lighter 40% fill color and a thick box border to the range J1:J2.
In cell J3, enter the text   Next Year’s Revenue   and wrap the text. Use a formula to 
determine next year’s revenues. In cell J4, the Next Year Client Fees Revenue equals the Total 
Client Fees Revenue (cell F4) plus the Total Client Fees Revenue (cell F4) multiplied by the 
Percent Change value (cell J2), or =F4+(F4*J2). Copy the formula from cell J4 to the range J5:J8 
using absolute cell referencing as needed, and then total the results in cell J9. Use the Format 
Painter to apply the formatting of the range F3:F9 to the range J3:J9.
Alyssa is disappointed that the 3.5% increase will not result in revenues of $500,000 in the 
next year. Use what-if analysis to determine what the percentage change would be for the practice 
to reach a total revenue of $500,000 in the next year.
Use the Replace command to replace all occurrences of the word, Revenue, with Income. 
Review the worksheet and check your spelling. 
Add a header that has the text, SKL Music Therapy Associates on the left, the current date 
in the center, and a page number on the right. If requested by your instructor, replace SKL Music 
Therapy Associates with your first and last name.
Save the workbook and submit it in the format specified by your instructor.
Access Capstone Project 2
Creating Forms, Queries, and Reports for Therapists and Clients
Alyssa Kerry has asked you to design an Access database to track clients and the music 
therapists responsible for the clients. You want to make sure that you follow standard database 
guidelines so that additional clients served by part-time therapists can be imported at a  
later date.
Alyssa keeps client and therapist addresses in Word tables, while maintaining financial 
information in Excel worksheets. She also has a list of which therapists are responsible for which 
clients. Alyssa is responsible for Darren Blackbird, Denton ISD, Maun Hospital, Nurture Group 
Homes, and George Smith. Therapist 34 is the primary therapist for Berls Hospital, Family 
Health Clinic, Fort Stewart ISD, and Allison Kirby. Alice Pediatric Services, Thomas Jones, 
Respite Day Care, and Tarleton ISD are clients of therapist 37. Mariana Silva (therapist 49) 
treats John Rogers, and the twins, Susan and Mark Winn. Therapist 51 treats Clark Childs, 
Joanne Leamon, Emma Peel, and the residents of Western Group Homes. Jan Lee does not have 
any assigned clients.
Instructions Part 1:  Using the data shown in Figure 2 – 8 and the information in the previous 
paragraph, design and create the SKL Music Therapy database. Use the ­database design guidelines 
provided in Access Chapter 1 to assist you in the design process.
When you have completed the database design, create the database using the name 
Capstone 2 SKL Music Therapy, create the tables, and then add the data to the appropriate tables. 
(Hint: There should be two tables in the database. For the first table, you can enter the data shown 
in Figure 2 – 8. For the second table, import the data from the Capstone 2 Client Data workbook.) 
Be sure to determine the correct data types and field sizes. Change the caption of Client Number 
to CL # and the caption for Therapist Number to TH #. After adding the records, be sure to resize 
the columns in the datasheets to best fit the data.

report title and delete the address-related columns (Street, City, State, and Postal Code). Modify 
the column headings to match those shown in Figure 2 – 10. Add totals for the Amount Paid and 
Current Due fields. Make sure the totals controls appear completely, and move the page number so 
that it is within the margins.
Instructions Part 2:  Answer the following questions using the Client table and including the Client 
Number, Client Name, City, Amount Paid, and Current Due fields in the query results. Save each 
query using a format similar to the following: Part 2 Step a Query, Part 2 Step b Query, and so on.
	a.	 Which clients are located in Denton?
	b.	 Which clients have names beginning with the letter W? 
	c.	 Which clients have a postal code of 80416? (The Postal Code field should not appear in the 
results.)
	d.	 Which clients have an amount paid amount of 0? 
	e.	 Which clients have current due amounts greater than $3,000? 
	f  .	 Which clients have current due amounts greater than $3,000 and are located in Denton?
	g.	 Which clients have current due amounts less than $300 or are located in Berls? 
	h.	 Sort the clients in ascending order by City and descending by Current Due. 
	 i.	 Sort the clients so that those with the greatest amount paid appear at the top and then display 
only the top 25 percent in the query results. 
	 j.	 Create a query that allows the user to enter a different city each time the query is run. 
Create a query that lists, in alphabetical order, the cities where clients are located that SKL 
serves. Each city should appear only once. Save the query as City Query.
Join the Client and Therapist tables. Include the Therapist Number, Last Name, and First 
Name fields from the Therapist table. Include the Client Number and Client Name fields from 
the Client table. Sort the records in ascending order by Therapist Number and Client Number. 
Make sure all therapists are included, regardless of whether they have any clients. Save the query as 
Therapist-Client Query. Export the Therapist-Client Query to Excel and save the export steps.
Restrict the records in the Therapist-Client Query to only those therapists who started after 
January 1, 2013. Do not display the date in the results. Save the query as Therapist-Client Date 
Query.
Create a form for the Therapist-Client Query, and save the form as Therapist-Client Form. 
Use the same query and the Report Wizard to create a report. Save the report as Therapist-Client 
Report.
Create a query using the Client table that includes the Client Number, Client Name, 
Amount Paid, and Current Due fields. Create a calculated field named Total Amount that adds the 
Amount Paid and Current Due fields. Change the captions for the Amount Paid and Current Due 
fields to Paid and Owe, respectively. Save the query as Client Total Amount Query.
Calculate the average amount paid and average current due grouped by therapist. Save the 
query as Client Average Query.
Calculate the minimum and the maximum current due amount for the city of Denton. Save 
the query as Client MinMax Query.
Using the Client table, create a crosstab query that has City as the row header and Therapist 
Number as the column header. Count the number of clients using the Client Number field. Save 
the query as City-Client Crosstab.
Instructions Part 3:  You have been asked to update some client and therapist information. Create a 
split form using the Client table, and save the form as Client Split Form. 
Jan Lee (Therapist 44) has acquired two new clients. Use the split form to add the following 
records: Wood, Thomas (WT44) lives at 200 Lincoln St., Tarleton, CO 80409. Thomas’s parents

already have paid $500 for services and currently owe $165. Dara Young (YD12) lives at 345 
Liatris Ave., Tourin, CO 80416. Her parents have paid $350 for her assessment and owe $400 for 
treatment planning and individual sessions. 
The address for client JT34 is incorrect. Find the client and change the street name to 
Oakton St. Clark Childs (CC89) has settled his account and moved from the area. Delete Clark’s 
record.
Using the Client table, filter the table to display all the clients located in Tarleton. Clear the 
filter, and then filter the table to display all clients located in cities that begin with, Be. Use Filter 
By Form to display all clients located in Fort Stewart who have a 0 amount paid amount. Finally, 
display in ascending order by client name, all clients located in postal code 80349 who currently 
owe more than $1,000.
Alyssa would like to add more details about the clients to the Client table. It would be 
beneficial for planning purposes to know the type of client and the services that a client might 
need. Add a lookup field named Client Type to the Client table immediately following the Postal 
Code field. The lookup field has the following values: MED (hospital or medical facility), PRI 
(private patient) and SCH (school, day care, or group home). 
Add a multivalued lookup field named Services following the Client Type field. Services 
has the following values: ASM (assessment), FLW (follow up), GRP (group session), IEP 
(individualized education plan), IND (individual session), and TRT (treatment plan).
Use an update query to assign the value PRI to the Client Type field. Save the query as 
Update Query. Using Datasheet view, change clients AP01, BH23, 
FH11, and MH25 to MED. Change clients DS01, FS34, NG46, 
RD04, TS02, and WG10 to SCH.
Add the services shown in Figure 2 – 11 to the Services field. 
Resize the column to best fit.
Create a calculated field named Total Amount to sum the 
Amount Paid and Current Due fields. Place the field after the 
Current Due field. Be sure to assign the value Currency to the 
Result type field property.
In the Client table, specify the following: Client Number field 
displays uppercase letters automatically; Client Name is a required 
field, and CO is the default value for the State field. Add a rule that 
the only allowable values in the Client Type field are MED, PRI, or 
SCH. Assign PRI as the default value for Client Type. Add a rule that 
the current due amount must be between $0.00 and $10,000.
Update the Client Form to reflect the changes in the Client 
table. Update the Client Financial Report to include the Client Type 
and Total Amount fields. Client Type should appear after Client 
Name, and Total Amount should appear after the Current Due field. 
Change the orientation to landscape.
Using the Client table, add a total row that sums the Amount Paid, Current Due, and Total 
Amount fields. Using the Therapist table, add a total row that sums the Salary field. Then, display 
only the horizontal gridlines, change the alternate row color to Blue-Gray, Text 2, Lighter 60%, 
and change the font and font size to Arial 10. Save the change to the layout of the Therapist table. 
If requested by your instructor, change the first and last name for therapist 44 to your first and last 
name. Return to the Client table and remove the totals.
After reviewing the database, Alyssa would like to make sure that no client is assigned a 
therapist who is not in the database. Additionally, make sure any therapist changes in the Therapist 
table are applied to the Client table.
Submit the database in the format specified by your instructor.

Organizing Email Messages and Calendar Events
Problem:  The music therapists at SKL are conducting a workshop at a regional meeting of music 
therapists. Planning a workshop involves many tasks, so the SKL staff holds regular meetings to 
discuss progress, resolve problems, and make decisions. You are using Outlook to keep track of 
meetings and send out reminders. You need to organize your messages and update events in the 
calendar.
Instructions Part 1:  Create the email message shown in Figure 2 – 12. Send the message to yourself 
with a copy to your instructor. Then, open the SKL Music Therapy mailbox file from the Data File 
for Students. Create two new folders within the Inbox folder. Name the first folder Community 
and the second folder Workshops. Move the messages in the Outlook Data File Inbox as well as the 
message you just sent yourself into the appropriate folders. Export the data file as Capstone 2.pst, 
and then submit it in the format specified by your instructor.

You also need to update some calendar items. By mistake, you enter your October 2nd 
dentist appointment in the wrong calendar. Delete this appointment. The staff is meeting every 
two weeks to discuss the workshop but they cannot meet on October 28. Delete this entry. Instead, 
the staff is going to be at a seminar on October 28. Add this all-day event. The community college 
is hosting the seminar. Central Hotel has notified you that the Workshop event on December 5 
will be in Ballroom D. Add that information to the description for the event. Save the calendar as 
an iCalendar named Capstone 2 SKL Workshops Calendar. Submit your assignment in the format 
specified by your instructor.
Instructions Part 2:  Open the Workshops Calendar.ics file from the Data Files for Students and 
create the appointments shown in Table 2 – 2. Use 2014 as the year for all calendar entries.

How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require 
you to think beyond the assigned project. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your 
instructor. Possible formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that 
contains the answer; present your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio 
or video using a webcam, smartphone, or portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.
1.	Is it important that all documents for SKL Music Therapy use the same theme? Why?
2.	What are the advantages of an organization, such as SKL Music Therapy having a beginning PowerPoint 
presentation that all music therapists can use?
3.	You created a 3-D Clustered Column chart for SKL Music Therapy. Would another chart type display the same 
data to better advantage? Why?
4.	In the Access database for SKL Music Therapists, private patients, hospitals, group homes, and educational 
institutions were in one table. What are the disadvantages of having all these client types in one table?
5.	Why is it important to include both your name and your organization in an email signature for a professional 
email? What other information would you include?

Capstone Project 3: 
Cloud and Web 
Technologies
The Capstone Project consists of an integrated, comprehensive set of problems related to a single 
scenario. Students apply concepts and skills presented in this book to create solutions to the 
problems using Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, and Outlook. In this project, you will use cloud 
and web technologies to create a solution.
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will be required to use the Data Files for Students. Visit 
www.cengage.com/ct/studentdownload for detailed instructions or contact your instructor for 
information about accessing the required files.
Note:  To complete this assignment, you will need to sign in to your Microsoft account, upload 
files to your SkyDrive and use the Office Web apps. To complete the Outlook assignment, you will 
need a Microsoft account at outlook.com. You will use the Google account that you used in Word 
Chapter 3, and you also will use the Office desktop apps. Because you will save these assignments to 
your SkyDrive, you should create a folder named Capstone 3 in which to store the assignments. 
Problem:  RescuePets Animal Shelter has enough funds to begin Phase 1 construction of the 
Hammonds County Dog Park. The shelter intends to start Phase 2 of the project shortly. Because 
you know you will be busy with other tasks in addition to supporting the fundraising efforts, you 
decide to do a little advance planning using web tools and desktop applications. You also need to 
finish up some items related to Phase 1.
Word Instructions:  Jackie Jones is an active 4-H member and has won numerous awards showing 
her dog, Teddy. Jackie helped with the Pet Party in the Park, and she will demonstrate obedience 
training at various future fundraisers. You would like to prepare a simple flyer to advertise these 
demonstrations using the Word Web App and save it to your SkyDrive to share with the committee. 
Use the text shown in Figure 3 – 1 on the next page to create the flyer. Insert into the flyer the 
picture named Dog Show 4 from the Data File for Students. Use the features available in the Word 
Web App to format this flyer. Be sure to change the font and font size of text, center a paragraph(s), 
italicize text, color text, underline text, and apply a picture style. Resize the picture if necessary. 
Save the document as Capstone 3 Flyer 1.docx on your SkyDrive, and submit the document in the 
format specified by your instructor.

CAP 30   Capstone Project 3   Cloud and Web Technologies
One of the committee members prefers to use Google Docs, so you decide to modify the 
flyer in Google Docs. Upload the Capstone 3 Flyer 1 document to your Google Drive, and open 
the flyer with Google Docs. If necessary, reinsert the picture. Apply a different bullet list style to 
the bulleted list. Replace the phrase, obey your commands, with the word, obedient. Save the flyer 
in Google Docs format with the name Capstone 3 Flyer 2. Submit the document in the format 
specified by your instructor.
PowerPoint Instructions:  Members of the fundraising committee have given several presentations 
to groups about the dog park. Presenters are frequently asked about pet ownership statistics, such 
as how many people actually own dogs? Use your favorite search engine to research the topic, 
pet ownership statistics. Select a reputable website (Hint: American Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals and the United States Humane Society have reputable websites) and find four 
facts on pet ownership. Using the PowerPoint Web App, create a Two Content slide that uses the 
Parallax theme and brown variant. Add a title to the slide, and list the four facts. Insert the image, 
Pet Picture 1, from the Data Files for Students, into the slide. Include a shape at the bottom of the 
slide that contains the name of the website from which you obtained your facts. Save the presentation 
on your SkyDrive as Capstone 3 Presentation.pptx.
Dog park etiquette is another topic of interest to audiences. Open the presentation 
in the desktop version of PowerPoint. Add a second slide with a title and content layout to 
the presentation, and format the slide background with a gradient or texture fill. Adjust the 
transparency, if necessary. Add an appropriate title to the slide, and format the title by changing 
the font and font size. Search YouTube to find a video to fit the topic and insert the video. Add a 
style to the video, and resize the frame. Save the presentation to your SkyDrive, and submit the 
assignment in the format specified by your instructor.
Instructions Excel:  You realize that the shelter needs to track corporate donors and foundation 
grants in a more organized manner and have created an Excel workbook to do so. You need to 
modify this workbook, and you want to be able to share the workbook with committee members, 
who may need quick access to the data. Upload the Donor.xlsx file from the Data Files for Students 
to your SkyDrive. Open the file in the Excel Web App, and delete the DonorID column. Add title 
and heading information that clearly identifies the purpose of the worksheet. Use the features of 
the Web app to change the font, font color, and font size of text, merge and center text, and adjust

donation. Identify all calculation results with appropriate formatting and text. Save the workbook as 
Capstone 3 Donations.xlsx on your SkyDrive. Submit the workbook in the format specified by your 
instructor.
Because construction on the dog park will begin shortly, you want to create a log in which 
to track purchases, such as fencing for the dog park. You decide to use one of Excel’s templates to 
create your worksheet. Open the desktop version of Excel, and search for Purchases in the online 
templates search box. Download the Business purchases log template. Modify the template by 
changing the theme of the template to one that coordinates with the other dog park files, replace 
the headings at the top of the worksheet with ones appropriate for the dog park, change the 
colors, and change the font and style of the column headings. Delete the last four columns of the 
worksheet. Format the Paid column with an appropriate Number style. Enter the text   Fencing   
in the Product column and enter   20000   in column G. Save the workbook as Capstone 3 
Purchase Log.xlsx on your SkyDrive. Submit the workbook in the format specified by your 
instructor.
Instructions Access:  The fundraising committee has planned several events for the next few months. 
You realize that you need to keep better track of these events but do not have the time to develop 
your own database. Start Access and search for events in the online templates search box. Down-
load the Desktop event management template, and save it as Capstone 3 Events.accdb. Open the 
database and review the database objects that are included in the template. To become familiar with 
the database, you want to enter four fundraising events. Use the Event List form, and enter the data 
shown in Table 3 – 1. You do not need to enter any data in the Description or Attachments columns. 
Close the Event List form, and organize the Navigation Pane by Tables and Related Views. Open 
the Events table and resize the Location column to best fit. Save the changes.
The template includes an All Events report. Open the All Events report and change the 
title to one that more accurately reflects the contents and purpose of the database. Save the report 
and rename the report as Capstone 3 Dog Park Report. Export the report in pdf format. Upload 
the pdf file to your SkyDrive so you can share the report with committee members. Submit the 
database and the report in the format specified by your instructor.
Instructions Outlook:  The fundraising committee had requested information on estimated expenses 
for Phase 2. Compose a new email message from the desktop version of Outlook. Address the mes-
sage to your Microsoft account with the message text,   The attached document contains 
estimated expenses for Phase 2.   Be sure to include an appropriate subject heading 
with your name and RescuePets Animal Shelter as the signature. Attach the Capstone 3 Phase 2 
Estimated Expenses file (Word document) from the Data Files for Students, and send the message 
with high importance. Open your Microsoft account at outlook.com, open the email message you 
sent, and then view the attachment online. Edit the document in the Word Web App by adding a 
title above the Estimated Expenses to indicate that the expenses are for the dog park. Center the title

and change the font color. Share the Word document with your instructor. Include a short message 
to indicate that you have completed the assignment. Include your name at the end of the message.
You want to understand how the online calendar works so you can better manage your time 
when you are not in the office. Access your Microsoft account at outlook.com, and then add a 
calendar named Dog Park Events. Assign the Orange color (row 3 column 1) to the calendar and 
enter the following description,   A calendar to record fundraising events.   To this 
new calendar, add the same events that you added to the Access database (see Table 3 – 1 on the 
previous page). Be sure to use 2014 as the year. Share the calendar with your instructor by sending 
a view-only link to access the calendar online.
How should you submit solutions to questions in the assignments identified with a 
 symbol?
Every assignment in this book contains one or more questions identified with a 
 symbol. These questions require 
you to think beyond the assigned project. Present your solutions to the questions in the format required by your 
instructor. Possible formats may include one or more of these options: write the answer; create a document that 
contains the answer; present your answer to the class; discuss your answer in a group; record the answer as audio 
or video using a webcam, smartphone, or portable media player; or post answers on a blog, wiki, or website.

Windows 7
Important Notes for 
Windows 7 Users
The screen shots in this book show Microsoft Office 2013 running in Windows 8. If you are using 
Microsoft Windows 7, however, you still can use this book because Office 2013 runs virtually the 
same way on both platforms. You will encounter only minor differences if you are using Windows 7. 
Read this section to understand the differences.
Dialog Boxes
If you are a Windows 7 user, the dialog boxes shown in this book will look slightly different than 
what you see on your screen. Dialog boxes for Windows 8 have a title bar with a solid color, and 
the dialog box name is centered on the title bar. Beyond these superficial differences in appearance, 
however, the options in the dialog boxes across both platforms are the same. For instance, Figures 1 
and 2 show the Font dialog box in Windows 7 and the Font dialog box in Windows 8.
Figure 1  Font Dialog Box in Windows 7 
Figure 2  Font Dialog Box in Windows 8

W7 2   Windows 7   Important Notes for Windows 7 Users
Alternate Steps for Running an App  
in Windows 7
Nearly all of the steps in this book work exactly the same way for Windows 7 users; 
however, running an app (or program/application) requires different steps for 
Windows 7. The following steps show how to run an app in Windows 7. 
Running an App (or Program/Application) 
Using Windows 7 
1.	 Click the Start button on the taskbar to display the Start menu.
2.	 Click All Programs and then click the Microsoft Office 2013 folder (Figure 3).
3.	 If necessary, click the name of the folder containing the app you want to run.
4.	 Click the name of the app you want to run (such as Excel 2013).
